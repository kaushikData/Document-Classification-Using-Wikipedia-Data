      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16785">'''Precision''' is a description of ''[[random errors]]'', a measure of [[statistical variability]].

'''Accuracy''' has two definitions:
# More commonly, it is a description of ''[[systematic errors]]'', a measure of [[statistical bias]]; as  these cause a difference between a result and a "true" value, [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] calls this ''trueness''.
# Alternatively, ISO defines accuracy as describing a combination of both types of [[observational error]] above (random and systematic), so high accuracy requires both high precision and high trueness.

In simplest terms, given a set of data points from repeated measurements of the same quantity, the set can be said to be ''precise'' if the values are close to each other, while the set can be said to be ''accurate'' if their average is close to the ''true value'' of the quantity being measured.  In the first, more common definition above, the two concepts are independent of each other, so a particular set of data can be said to be either accurate, or precise, or both, or neither.

==Common technical definition==
[[Image:Accuracy and precision.svg|thumb|300px|Accuracy is the proximity of measurement results to the true value; precision, the repeatability, or reproducibility of the measurement]]

In the fields of [[science]] and [[engineering]], the accuracy of a [[measurement]] system is the degree of closeness of measurements of a [[quantity]] to that quantity's true [[value (mathematics)|value]].&lt;ref name=metrology_terms&gt;''[http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/documents/jcgm/JCGM_200_2008.pdf JCGM 200:2008 International vocabulary of metrology] — Basic and general concepts and associated terms (VIM)&lt;/ref&gt; The precision of a measurement system, related to [[reproducibility]] and [[repeatability]], is the degree to which repeated measurements under unchanged conditions show the same [[result]]s.&lt;ref name=metrology_terms /&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite book  |title=An Introduction to Error Analysis: The Study of Uncertainties in Physical Measurements |first= John Robert |last= Taylor |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=giFQcZub80oC&amp;pg=PA128 |pages=128–129 |isbn=0-935702-75-X |year=1999 |publisher=University Science Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the two words precision and accuracy can be [[synonymous]] in [[colloquial]] use, they are deliberately contrasted in the context of the [[scientific method]].

The field of [[statistics]], where the interpretation of measurements plays a central role, prefers to use the terms ''[[Bias (statistics)|bias]]'' and ''[[Variability (statistics)|variability]]'' instead of accuracy and precision: bias is the amount of inaccuracy and variability is the amount of imprecision.

A measurement system can be accurate but not precise, precise but not accurate, neither, or both. For example, if an experiment contains a [[systematic error]], then increasing the [[sample size]] generally increases precision but does not improve accuracy. The result would be a consistent yet inaccurate string of results from the flawed experiment.  Eliminating the systematic error improves accuracy but does not change precision.

A measurement system is considered ''valid'' if it is both ''accurate'' and ''precise''. Related terms include ''bias'' (non-[[random]] or directed effects caused by a factor or factors unrelated to the [[independent variable]]) and ''error'' (random variability).

The terminology is also applied to indirect measurements—that is, values obtained by a computational procedure from observed data.

In addition to accuracy and precision, measurements may also have a [[Sensor#Resolution|measurement resolution]], which is the smallest change in the underlying physical quantity that produces a response in the measurement.

In [[numerical analysis]], accuracy is also the nearness of a calculation to the true value; while precision is the resolution of the representation, typically defined by the number of decimal or binary digits.

In military terms, accuracy refers primarily to the accuracy of fire (or "justesse de tir"), the precision of fire expressed by the closeness of a grouping of shots at and around the centre of the target.&lt;ref&gt;North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Nato Standardization Agency AAP-6 - Glossary of terms and definitions, p 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantification===
{{see also|False precision}}
In industrial instrumentation, accuracy is the measurement tolerance, or transmission of the instrument and defines the limits of the errors made when the instrument is used in normal operating conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Creus, Antonio. ''Instrumentación Industrial''{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideally a measurement device is both accurate and precise, with measurements all close to and tightly clustered around the true value. The accuracy and precision of a measurement process is usually established by repeatedly measuring some [[traceability|traceable]] reference [[Technical standard|standard]]. Such standards are defined in the [[SI|International System of Units]] (abbreviated SI from French: Système international d'unités) and maintained by national [[standards organization]]s such as the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] in the United States.

This also applies when measurements are repeated and averaged. In that case, the term [[standard error (statistics)|standard error]] is properly applied: the precision of the average is equal to the known standard deviation of the process divided by the square root of the number of measurements averaged. Further, the [[central limit theorem]] shows that the [[probability distribution]] of the averaged measurements will be closer to a normal distribution than that of individual measurements.

With regard to accuracy we can distinguish:
*the difference between the [[mean]] of the measurements and the reference value, the [[bias of an estimator|bias]]. Establishing and correcting for bias is necessary for [[calibration]].
*the combined effect of that and precision.

A common convention in science and engineering is to express accuracy and/or precision implicitly by means of [[significant figures]]. Here, when not explicitly stated, the margin of error is understood to be one-half the value of the last significant place. For instance, a recording of 843.6&amp;nbsp;m, or 843.0&amp;nbsp;m, or 800.0&amp;nbsp;m would imply a margin of 0.05&amp;nbsp;m (the last significant place is the tenths place), while a recording of 8436&amp;nbsp;m would imply a margin of error of 0.5&amp;nbsp;m (the last significant digits are the units).

A reading of 8,000&amp;nbsp;m, with trailing zeroes and no decimal point, is ambiguous; the trailing zeroes may or may not be intended as significant figures. To avoid this ambiguity, the number could be represented in scientific notation: 8.0&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m indicates that the first zero is significant (hence a margin of 50&amp;nbsp;m) while 8.000&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m indicates that all three zeroes are significant, giving a margin of 0.5&amp;nbsp;m. Similarly, it is possible to use a multiple of the basic measurement unit: 8.0&amp;nbsp;km is equivalent to 8.0&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m. In fact, it indicates a margin of 0.05&amp;nbsp;km (50&amp;nbsp;m). However, reliance on this convention can lead to [[false precision]] errors when accepting data from sources that do not obey it. For example, a source reporting a number like 153,753 with precision +/- 5,000 looks like it has precision +/- 0.5. Under the convention it would have been rounded to 154,000.

Precision includes:
*''repeatability'' &amp;mdash; the variation arising when all efforts are made to keep conditions constant by using the same instrument and operator, and repeating during a short time period; and
*''reproducibility'' &amp;mdash; the variation arising using the same measurement process among different instruments and operators, and over longer time periods.

=={{visible anchor|ISO definition (ISO 5725)|ISO_Definition_.28ISO_5725.29}}==
[[File:Accuracy (trueness and precision).svg|300px|thumb|right|According to ISO 5725-1, Accuracy consists of Trueness (proximity of measurement results to the true value) and Precision (repeatability or reproducibility of the measurement)]]
A shift in the meaning of these terms appeared with the publication of the ISO 5725 series of standards in 1994, which is also reflected in the 2008 issue of the "BIPM International Vocabulary of Metrology" (VIM), items 2.13 and 2.14.&lt;ref name="metrology_terms"/&gt;

According to ISO 5725-1,&lt;ref&gt;BS ISO 5725-1: "Accuracy (trueness and precision) of measurement methods and results - Part 1: General principles and definitions.", p.1 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; the general term "'''accuracy'''" is used to describe the closeness of a measurement to the true value. When the term is applied to sets of measurements of the same ''measure''and, it involves a component of random error and a component of systematic error. In this case '''trueness''' is the closeness of the mean of a set of measurement results to the actual (true) value and '''precision''' is the closeness of agreement among a set of results.

ISO 5725-1 and VIM also avoid the use of the term "[[Bias (statistics)|bias]]", previously specified in BS 5497-1,&lt;ref&gt;BS 5497-1: "Precision of test methods. Guide for the determination of repeatability and reproducibility for a standard test method." (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; because it has different connotations outside the fields of science and engineering, as in medicine and law.

==In binary classification==
{{main|Evaluation of binary classifiers}}
''Accuracy'' is also used as a statistical measure of how well a [[binary classification]] test correctly identifies or excludes a condition. That is, the accuracy is the proportion of true results (both [[true positive]]s and [[true negative]]s) among the total number of cases examined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url= http://www.umich.edu/~ners580/ners-bioe_481/lectures/pdfs/1978-10-semNucMed_Metz-basicROC.pdf |last= Metz |first= CE |title= Basic principles of ROC analysis |journal= Semin Nucl Med.| year= October 1978 |volume= 8| number=4 |pages=283–98|pmid= 112681 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To make the context clear by the semantics, it is often referred to as the "Rand accuracy" or "[[Rand index]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alta.asn.au/events/altss_w2003_proc/altss/courses/powers/ALTSS2003-Val+Eval-L3.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311073014/http://alta.asn.au/events/altss_w2003_proc/altss/courses/powers/ALTSS2003-Val+Eval-L3.pdf |archivedate=2015-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=1503.06410|title=What the F-measure doesn't measure|last1=Powers|first1=David M. W|class=cs.IR|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anthology.aclweb.org/E/E12/E12-1035.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Problem with Kappa|author=David M W Powers|website=Anthology.aclweb.org|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a parameter of the test.
The formula for quantifying binary accuracy is:

Accuracy = (TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN)

where:  TP = True positive; FP = False positive; TN = True negative; FN = False negative

==In psychometrics and psychophysics==
In [[psychometrics]] and [[psychophysics]], the term ''accuracy'' is interchangeably used with [[Validity (statistics)|validity]] and ''constant error''. ''Precision'' is a synonym for [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] and ''variable error''. The validity of a measurement instrument or psychological test is established through experiment or correlation with behavior. Reliability is established with a variety of statistical techniques, classically through an internal consistency test like [[Cronbach's alpha]] to ensure sets of related questions have related responses, and then comparison of those related question between reference and target population.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

==In logic simulation==
In [[logic simulation]], a common mistake in evaluation of accurate models is to compare a [[electronic circuit simulation|logic simulation model]] to a [[transistor]] [[transistor models|circuit simulation model]]. This is a comparison of differences in precision, not accuracy. Precision is measured with respect to detail and accuracy is measured with respect to reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=none| first= John M. |last= Acken |work= Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Technology |volume= 36 |year= 1997| pages= 281–306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title= 1990 Workshop on Logic-Level Modelling for ASICS |first1= Mark |last1= Glasser |first2= Rob |last2= Mathews |first3= John M. |last3= Acken |journal= SIGDA Newsletter |volume= 20 |number=  1 |date= June 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In information systems==

Information retrieval systems, such as [[database]]s and [[web search engine]]s, are evaluated by [[Evaluation measures (information retrieval)|many different metrics]], some of which are derived from the [[confusion matrix]], which divides results into true positives (documents correctly retrieved), true negatives (documents correctly not retrieved), false positives (documents incorrectly retrieved), and false negatives (documents incorrectly not retrieved). Commonly used metrics include the notions of [[precision and recall]].  In this context, precision is defined as the fraction of retrieved documents which are relevant to the query (true positives divided by true+false positives), using a set of [[ground truth]] relevant results selected by humans.  Recall is defined as the fraction of relevant documents retrieved compared to the total number of relevant documents (true positives divided by true positives+false negatives).  Less commonly, the metric of accuracy is used, is defined as the total number of correct classifications (true positives plus true negatives) divided by the total number of documents.

None of these metrics take into account the ranking of results. Ranking is very important for web search engines because readers seldom go past the first page of results, and there are too many documents on the web to manually classify all of them as to whether they should be included or excluded from a given search.  Adding a cutoff at a particular number of results takes ranking into account to some degree. The measure [[precision at k]], for example, is a measure of precision looking only at the top ten (k=10) search results. More sophisticated metrics, such as [[discounted cumulative gain]], take into account each individual ranking, and are more commonly used where this is important.

The '''blue field [[entoptic phenomenon]]''' or '''Scheerer's phenomenon''' (after the German ophthalmologist Richard Scheerer, who first drew clinical attention to it in 1924&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Blom | first1 = J. D. | chapter = B | doi = 10.1007/978-1-4419-1223-7_2 | title = A Dictionary of Hallucinations | pages = 59–80 | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-1-4419-1222-0 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the appearance of tiny bright dots (nicknamed '''blue-sky sprites''') moving quickly along squiggly lines in the visual field, especially when looking into bright blue light such as the sky.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Scheerer |first=Richard |title=Die entoptische Sichtbarkeit der Blutbewegungen im Auge und ihre klinische Bedeutung |language=German |journal=[[Klinische Monatsblätter für Augenheilkunde]] |year=1924 |volume=73 |pages=67–107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dots are short-lived, visible for a second or less, and traveling short distances along seemingly random, curvy paths. Some of them follow the same path as predecessors. The dots may be elongated along the path like tiny worms. The speed of the dots varies in sync with the [[pulse]]; they briefly accelerate at each heart beat.&lt;ref name="Riva"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Riva | first1 = C.E. | last2 = Petrig | first2 = B. | doi = 10.1364/JOSA.70.001234 | title = Blue field entoptic phenomenon and blood velocity in the retinal capillaries  | journal = Journal of the Optical Society of America | volume = 70 | pages = 1234–1238 | year = 1980 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dots appear in the central field of view, within 15 degrees from the fixation point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hafez|first=Ali|editor=R.N. Weinreb|title=Ocular Blood Flow in Glaucoma|chapter=Blue Field Entoptic Simulation|publisher=Kugler Publications|year=2009|pages=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6GXgLSSbTDoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The left and right eye see different dots; someone looking with both eyes sees a mixture.

Most people are able to see this phenomenon in the sky, although it is rather weak, and many people do not notice it until asked to pay attention. The dots are highly conspicuous against a monochromatic blue background (~430&amp;nbsp;nm) instead of the sky.

==Explanation==
[[File:Fundus of eye normal.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fundus photography|Ophthalmogram]] showing blood vessels in front of the [[retina]]. Their shadow is the cause of the blue field entoptic phenomenon.]]
The dots are [[white blood cell]]s moving in the [[capillary|capillaries]] in front of the [[retina]] of the [[human eye|eye]].&lt;ref name="Sinclair"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sinclair, S.H. |author2=Azar-Cavanagh, M. |author3=Soper, K.A. |author4=Tuma, R.F. |author5= Mayrovitz, H.N. |year=1989|title=Investigation of the source of the blue field entoptic phenomenon.|journal=Investigative Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Science|volume=30|issue=4|pages=668–673|pmid=2703307|url=http://www.iovs.org/cgi/reprint/30/4/668.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Blue light (optimal [[wavelength]]: [[1 E-7 m|430 nm]]) is absorbed by the [[red blood cell]]s that fill the capillaries. The eye and brain "edit out" the shadow lines of the capillaries, partially by [[adaptation (eye)|dark adaptation]] of the [[photoreceptor cells|photoreceptors]] lying beneath the capillaries. The white blood cells, which are much rarer than the red ones and do not absorb blue light, create gaps in the blood column, and these gaps appear as bright dots. The gaps are elongated because a spherical white blood cell is too wide for the capillary. Red blood cells pile up behind the white blood cell, showing up like a dark tail.&lt;ref name="Snodderly"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Snodderly, D.M. |author2=Weinhaus, R.S. |author3= Choi, J.C. |year=1992|title=Neural-vascular relationships in central retina of Macaque monkeys (Macaca fascicularis)|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|volume=12|issue=4|pages=1169–1193|url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/reprint/12/4/1169.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This behavior of the blood cells in the capillaries of the retina has been directly observed in human subjects by [[adaptive optics]] [[scanning laser ophthalmoscopy]], a real time imaging technique for examining retinal blood flow.&lt;ref name="Akihito"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Uji | first1 = A. | last2 = Hangai | first2 = M. | last3 = Ooto | first3 = S. | last4 = Takayama | first4 = K. | last5 = Arakawa | first5 = N. | last6 = Imamura | first6 = H. | last7 = Nozato | first7 = K. | last8 = Yoshimura | first8 = N. | doi = 10.1167/iovs.11-8192 | title = The Source of Moving Particles in Parafoveal Capillaries Detected by Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy | journal = Investigative Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Science | volume = 53 | pages = 171–8 | year = 2011 | pmid =  22159004| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The dots will not appear at the very centre of the visual field, because there are no blood vessels in the [[Fovea centralis|fovea]]l avascular zone.

==Blue field entoptoscopy==
In a technique known as '''blue field entoptoscopy''', the effect is used to estimate the blood flow in the retinal capillaries. The patient is alternatingly shown blue light and a computer generated picture of moving dots; by adjusting the speed and density of these dots, the patient tries to match the computer generated picture to the perceived entoptic dots.

==Difference from other entoptic phenomena==
Scheerer’s phenomenon can be easily distinguished from [[floater]]s (''muscae volitantes''). 
Scheerer’s phenomenon consists of corpuscles of identical diameter and visual sharpness, of a simple dot or worm-like shape, brighter than the background. If the eye stops moving, the dots keep darting around. If the eye moves, the dots follow instantaneously, because they are contained in the retina. In contrast, floaters are specks or threads of variable diameter and variable visual sharpness, some of complex shape, darker than the background. If the eye stops moving, the floaters settle down. If the eye moves, the floaters follow sluggishly, because they are contained in the [[vitreous humor]] which is subject to inertia.

Scheerer's phenomenon can be distinguished from [[visual snow]] because it appears only when looking into bright light, whereas visual snow is constantly present in all light conditions including the dark.

==History==
===Portuguese overseas colonies===
====Goa====
Following the Portuguese seizure of [[Goa]] in 1510, the Portuguese became familiar with the cannabis customs and trade in India. [[Garcia da Orta]], a botanist and doctor, wrote about the uses of cannabis in his 1534 work ''Colloquies on the Simples and Drugs and Medicinal Matters of India and of a Few Fruits''. Fifteen years later [[Cristobal Acosta]] produced the work ''A Tract about the Drugs and Medicines of the East Indies'', outlining recipes for bhang.&lt;ref name="Booth2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Booth|title=Cannabis: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ecITBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74|date=16 June 2015|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-1-250-08219-0|pages=74–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1919 work ''Glossário luso-asiatico'' noted the use of cannabis in Portugal's Indian colony of [[Goa]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''O bangue é formado por folhas secas e hastes tentras de cânhamo (Canabis sativa, Lin.) que se fumam o mascam e que embriaga como o ópio.''&lt;br /&gt;
(''[[Bhang|Bangue]]'' is made of dry leaves and tender stemps of hemp, which they smoke or chew, and it intoxicates like opium.)&lt;ref name="TorresPortugueses1994"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ana María (ed.) Carabias Torres|author2=Comissão Nacional para as Comemorações dos Descobrimentos Portugueses|title=Las relaciones entre Portugal y Castilla en la época de los descubrimientos y la expansión colonial|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t2Zyi4lXfN0C&amp;pg=PA284|year=1994|publisher=Universidad de Salamanca|isbn=978-84-7481-792-8|pages=284–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Brazil====
Cannabis was introduced to Brazil by the Portuguese colonists in the early 1800s. Their intent may have been to cultivate hemp fiber, but the slaves the Portuguese imported from Africa were familiar with cannabis and used it psychoactively, leading the Municipal Council of Rio de Janeiro in 1830 to prohibit bringing cannabis into the city, and punishing its use by any slave.&lt;ref name="ClarkeMerlin2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Clarke|author2=Mark Merlin|title=Cannabis: Evolution and Ethnobotany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=poenY6QMq8UC&amp;pg=PA182|date=1 September 2013|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-95457-1|pages=182–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decriminalization==
Possession of cannabis in Portugal is decriminalized in amounts for personal use, considered to be up to 25 grams of plant material or 5 grams of [[hashish]].  In 2001 [[Drug policy of Portugal|Portugal decriminalized all illegal drugs]], meaning that possession of personal amounts (a 10 day supply) is not subject to any penalties for a first-time offense.

A '''canned hunt''' is a [[trophy hunting|trophy hunt]] in which an animal is kept in a confined area, such as in a fenced-in area, increasing the likelihood of the [[hunter]] obtaining a kill. According to one dictionary, a canned hunt is a "hunt for animals that have been raised on game ranches until they are mature enough to be killed for trophy collections."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexic.us/definition-of/canned_hunt |title=Canned hunt: Definition with Canned hunt Pictures and Photos |publisher=Lexic.us |date= |accessdate=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There have been criticisms of this method of hunting from both hunters and animal welfare advocacy groups. This is also sometimes referred to as [[vanity hunting]].

== Legislation in the U.S. ==
Canned hunting has been banned or restricted in 20 states of the USA, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christinabush.com/cannedhunting.html |title=Canned Hunting |publisher=Christinabush.com |date= |accessdate=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Alabama was the most recent state to pass legislation banning many forms of canned hunting.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hsus.org The Humane Society of the United States&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, a bill in the [[New York State Legislature]] to ban all canned hunting of certain "exotic" animals was defeated by legislative inaction.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Klein, [http://www.legislativegazette.com/Articles-c-2007-06-25-61997.113122-Bill-to-ban-canned-hunts-falls-prey-to-the-legislative-clock.html ''Bill to ban canned hunts falls prey to the legislative clock''], Legislative Gazette, June 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
A number of groups object to the practice of canned hunting for reasons such as cruelty to animals or that it takes away what is known as "[[fair chase]]."

The [[Humane Society of the United States]] (HSUS) criticizes canned hunting. In a statement, the HSUS called canned hunts "cruel and brutal activities," in which the hunted animal has "absolutely no chance of escape." It went on to say that animals have been "psychologically conditioned to behave as a target by life in captivity," among other objections.&lt;ref name="hsus"&gt;{{cite web

Some hunting groups, especially those who focus on hunters' ethics, also object to canned hunting.&lt;ref name="page"&gt;{{cite news

| accessdate = August 4, 2006, unarchived report found on bigcatrescue.org on 2011-12-2, dead link under article }}&lt;/ref&gt; These objections are on the grounds of "[[fair chase]]", the idea that an animal has a fair chance of escaping the hunter, and it's not too easy for the hunter to kill the animal. It is believed that canned hunts remove these elements.

Hunting groups such as the [[Pope and Young Club]] and the [[Boone and Crockett Club]] do not accept animals killed in canned hunts for inclusion in their record books. [[Boone and Crockett Club]] refers to the activity as a "canned shoot", as they claim that there is no hunting involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boone and Crockett Club Position Statement|url=http://www.boone-crockett.org/huntingEthics/ethics_cannedshoot.asp?area=huntingEthics|website=Boone and Crockett Club}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Safari Club International]] no longer accepts animals killed in canned hunts for inclusion in its record books and award categories.

In 2014, 62 cities across the globe participated in the first-ever global march against canned hunting. The march was organized by Campaign Against Canned Hunting. People from many parts of the world took part: Africa, Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe, Middle East, New Zealand, South America and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Your African Safari, [http://www.yourafricansafari.com/articles/campaign-against-canned-hunting-in-south-africa-interview-with-chris-mercer "Campaign against canned hunting in South Africa: interview with Chris Mercer"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Canned hunting in the news ==

In 2005, [[internet hunting]] became a major news story when a man in Texas set up a webcam and remotely controlled gun to allow hunters to shoot from their computers. According to the [[Humane Society]], most internet hunts involve game ranches where animals are kept penned, making them essentially canned hunts.&lt;ref name=HSUS-FactSheet&gt;Humane Society Wildlife Abuse Campaign, {{cite web |url=http://www.hsus.org/wildlife_abuse/campaigns/internet/fact_sheet_internet_hunting.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028202802/http://www.hsus.org/wildlife_abuse/campaigns/internet/fact_sheet_internet_hunting.html |archivedate=October 28, 2008 |title=Fact sheet on Internet Hunting }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 15, 2006, [[Troy Gentry]], half of the country music singing duo [[Montgomery Gentry]], appeared in federal court in [[Duluth, Minnesota]] charged with canned hunting. Federal prosecutors allege that Gentry bought a bear named "Cubby" from Lee Marvin Greenly, then shot the tame bear while it was in an enclosed pen, tagged the bear as if it had been killed in the wild, then arranged for the editing of a videotape of the alleged "wild" kill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/08/16/people.troyleegentry.ap/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821012617/http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/08/16/people.troyleegentry.ap/index.html |archivedate=August 21, 2006 |title=Country star accused of illegally killing tame bear |accessdate=August 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gentry and Greenly are said to face a maximum penalty of five years in federal prison and a $20,000 fine if convicted. On November 27, 2006, Gentry pleaded guilty to a charge of falsely tagging the bear. Under the plea agreement, he agreed to pay a $15,000 fine, give up hunting, fishing and trapping in Minnesota for 5 years, and forfeit both the stuffed bear and the bow used to shoot the animal in 2004. Gentry posted a statement on the duo's website on November 9, 2010, apologizing for his actions.

Another less well-known incident occurred two years prior to the [[Dick Cheney hunting incident]] when the vice president participated in a canned hunt at the Rolling Rock Club in [[Ligonier Township, Pennsylvania]]. Cheney and nine companions killed 417 out of 500 [[ringneck pheasant]]s, of which the Vice President himself is credited with killing 70, and an unknown number of [[mallard duck]]s.&lt;ref name="walls"&gt;{{cite web

In South Africa, the Minister of Environmental Affairs, Mr. [[Marthinus van Schalkwyk]], in 2006, announced new laws to stop the practise of "canned hunting"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huntersouthafrica.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023145325/http://www.huntersouthafrica.com/ |archivedate=October 23, 2006 |title=Huntersouthafrica supports Dart safaris|accessdate=October 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in his country. South Africa environment minister announced long-awaited restrictions on lion hunting, declaring he was sickened by wealthy tourists shooting tame lions from the back of a truck and felling rhinos with a bow and arrow. This comes in response to the imbroglio created over the potential canned hunt of the African [[rhinoceros]] 'Baixinha.'{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

Dismissing threats of legal action by the hunting industry, Marthinus Van Schalkwyk said the new law would ban "canned" hunting of big predators and rhinos in small enclosures that offer them no means of escape.
In addition, lions bred in captivity would have to be released into the open for at least two years before they could be hunted. Van Schalkwyk said a previously proposed six-month delay would not give lions enough time to develop self-defence instincts.
"Hunting should be about fair chase ... testing the wits of a hunter against that of the animal," he told a press conference. "Over the years that got eroded and now we are trying to re-establish that principle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nullis|first=Clare|title=South Africa bans hunting caged lions|url=http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/news/1058/south-africa-bans-hunting-caged-lions|accessdate=October 26, 2011|date=February 22, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401192134/http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/news/1058/south-africa-bans-hunting-caged-lions#|archive-date=April 1, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This measure was later overturned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=
South Africa Resumes Canned Hunting|url=http://www.care2.com/causes/south-africa-resumes-canned-hunting.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007 a much-reported hunting trip involved the killing of 1,051&amp;nbsp;pound pet pig in an alleged canned hunt. The pig was named "[[Monster Pig]]" by the media and it was believed that the pig was a feral hog. It was soon discovered that the pig, previously named "Fred," had been someone's pet and was then sold to a hunting facility only a brief time before he was killed. On May 3, paying customers Mike Stone and his 11-year-old son, Jamison, hunted him in a {{convert|150|acre|km2}} fenced enclosure. Jamison shot Fred a total of eight times over a period of three hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hsus.org/wildlife/wildlife_news/monster_pig_canned_hunt.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606151221/http://www.hsus.org/wildlife/wildlife_news/monster_pig_canned_hunt.html |archivedate=June 6, 2007 |title=Eight Shots, Three Hours, One Death: The Story of a Canned Hunt |accessdate=June 1, 2007 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

A June 2007 story on CNN detailed canned hunting in South Africa and includes a video of a canned lion hunt where the animal is shot against a fence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/exchange/blogs/in.the.field/2007/06/shooting-lions.html |title=CNN "Shooting Lions in South Africa" |publisher=Cnn.com |date=2007-06-08 |accessdate=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On November 30, 2014, CBS 60 Minutes broadcast a story ("The Lion Whisperer") about one man's sanctuary in South Africa for 26 lions, raised in captivity, who he rescued from the fate of canned lion hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Clarissa Ward |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-lion-whisperer/ |title=The lion whisperer |publisher=CBS News |date= |accessdate=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In November 2015, the Professional Hunters' Association of South Africa (PHASA) voted to disassociate itself from the practice of canned lion hunting in South Africa. Unless the conservation value of canned lion hunting is demonstrated to PHASA, the organization will remain against the practice and, under penalty of expulsion, no PHASA members will be permitted to participate canned lion hunts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=

In November 2017 PHASA came under fire over the body's reversal of its 2015 policy against the hunting of captive-bred lions.

'''Cetyl myristoleate''' is a chemical compound which is a type of [[fatty acid ester]] or, more specifically, a [[cetylated fatty acid]] (CFA).  It is the [[cetyl alcohol|cetyl]] [[ester]] of [[myristoleic acid]].  Although it is used as a dietary supplement, there is little clinical evidence to support a benefit for any medical condition.&lt;ref name=Ameye&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1186/ar2016 | year = 2006 | last1 = Ameye | first1 = Laurent G | last2 = Chee | first2 = Winnie SS | journal = [[Arthritis Research &amp; Therapy]] | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = R127 | title = From nutraceuticals to functional foods | pmid=16859534 | pmc=1779427}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless there are some clinical trials appearing to show benefit for inflammation due to arthritis which should be taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;cetyl-myristoleate.com/clinical-studies/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthesis==
Cetyl myristoleate has been prepared by an [[esterification]] reaction between myristoleic acid and cetyl alcohol, catalyzed by [[p-Toluenesulfonic acid|''p''-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate]].&lt;ref name=Hunter&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S1043-6618(02)00239-6 | title = Synthesis of cetyl myristoleate and evaluation of its therapeutic efficacy in a murine model of collagen-induced arthritis | year = 2003 | last1 = Hunter | first1 = Kenneth W | last2 = Gault | first2 = Ruth A | last3 = Stehouwer | first3 = Jeffrey S | last4 = Tam-Chang | first4 = Suk-Wah | journal = Pharmacological Research | volume = 47 | pages = 43–7 | pmid = 12526860 | issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal pharmacology==
In animal studies, cetyl myristoleate was first reported to block inflammation and prevent adjuvant-induced arthritis at very high doses in rats.&lt;ref name=Hunter/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = H.W Diehl, E.L May | title = Cetyl myristoleate isolated from Swiss albino mice: an apparent protective agent against adjuvant arthritis in rats | journal = J Pharm Sci | volume = 83 | year = 1994 | pages = 296–9 | doi = 10.1002/jps.2600830307 | pmid = 8207671 | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other studies using identical and similar methods have failed to replicate this effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 17638102 | year = 1999 | last1 = Whitehouse | first1 = MW | last2 = McGeary | first2 = RP | title = Concerning the anti-arthritic action of cetyl myristoleate in rats: An interim report | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 303–10 | doi = 10.1007/s10787-999-0014-z | journal = Inflammopharmacology}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In follow-up studies in mice, a modest anti-inflammatory effect was observed.&lt;ref name=Hunter/&gt;

==Study in humans==
Although cetyl myristoleate is sold as a dietary supplement, its possible benefits in the treatment of any medical condition are largely unknown&lt;ref name=Ameye/&gt; and the [[Federal Trade Commission]] has taken legal action against supplement manufacturers for exaggerated claims.&lt;ref&gt;See for example:&lt;br&gt;• [http://www.ftc.gov/os/1999/09/arthritiscmp.htm DOCKET NO. C-3896] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421040131/http://www.ftc.gov/os/1999/09/arthritiscmp.htm |date=April 21, 2013 }}, [[Federal Trade Commission]]&lt;br&gt;• [http://www.ftc.gov/os/2000/05/ehpcmp.htm FTC Complaint against EHP Products, Inc.]&lt;br&gt;• [http://www.ftc.gov/os/2000/05/cmocmp.htm FTP Complaint against CMO Distribution Centers of America, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some clinical evidence for the benefits of CFAs, which may contain cetyl myristoleate, in arthritic patients.&lt;ref&gt;See cetyl-myristoleate.com/clinical-studies; and {{cite journal | pmid = 12180734 | year = 2002 | last1 = Hesslink Jr | first1 = R | last2 = Armstrong d | first2 = 3rd | last3 = Nagendran | first3 = MV | last4 = Sreevatsan | first4 = S | last5 = Barathur | first5 = R | title = Cetylated fatty acids improve knee function in patients with osteoarthritis | volume = 29 | issue = 8 | pages = 1708–12 | journal = The Journal of Rheumatology}}&lt;/ref&gt; One pilot study found that cetyl myristoleate may be beneficial against fibromyalgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = A.M Edwards | title = CMO (cerasomol-cis-9-cetyl myristoleate) in the treatment of fibromyalgia: an open pilot study | journal = J.

        The '''China Welfare Institute''' (CWI) (中国福利会) was founded by [[Soong Ching-ling|Soong Ching Ling]], Honorary [[President of the People's Republic of China|President of the People’s Republic of China]] and wife of [[Sun Yat-sen]], in [[Hong Kong]] on June 14,1938. It is one of the oldest and most influential NGOs nationwide in China. 

        CWI was originally named the [[China defense League]] (CDL). In December 1941, CDL was moved to [[Chongqing]], and it fully rallied support for the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|War of Chinese People against Japanese Aggression]]. In November 1945, it was renamed the [[China Welfare Found]] (CWF) with its headquarters moved to [[Shanghai]] to support the great cause of liberation of the Chinese people. Meanwhile, it was active in promoting children welfare through cultural and educational programs. In August 1950, the name was changed to the China Welfare Institute (CWI), with its guidelines set to run experimental and demonstrative projects in women and children's health care and children’s culture, education and welfare, enhance scientific researches, and continue international exchanges and cooperation. 

        Soong Ching Ling personally initiated many cultural, educational and healthcare institutions for women and children, including the [[CWI Children's Art Theatre]], the [[CWI International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital]], the [[CWI Children's Palace]], the [[CWI Nursery]], the [[CWI Kindergarten]], the [[CWI Children's Epoch Publishing House]], and the [[Children's Art Playhouse]]. This has made her a paragon of commitment to the welfare of children in China after 1949.

        In the past 80 years, CWI has received great support and encouragement from many CPC and national government leaders, including [[Mao Zedong]], [[Zhou Enlai]], [[Zhu De]], [[Liu Shaoqi]], [[Deng Xiaoping]], [[Jiang Zemin]], [[Hu Jintao]] and [[Xi Jinping]]. CWI was successively chaired by Soong Ching Ling, [[Liao Chengzhi]], [[Kang Keqing]], [[Huang Hua]], and [[Hu Qili]], followed by [[Wang Jiarui]] who has taken over the office since 2017. All CWI chairmen or chairwomen are the [[List of national leaders of the People's Republic of China|Party and State Leaders]] of China. Its executive board consists of members from departments of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|CPC Central Committee]], ministries under the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]], departments of the CPC Shanghai Committee and the municipal government, as well as other NGOs.

        Currently, CWI runs many institutions specialized in areas of 1) maternal and child health, 2) school education, 3) out-of- school education, 3) children's play, 4) children's book publication, 5) senior citizen welfare, and 6) social welfare fund. Committed to the mandate of "being experimental and demonstrative" proposed by Soong Ching Ling and Premier Zhou Enlai, CWI has carried forward Soong's initiative to be fully dedicated to the welfare of women and children. Based in Shanghai with a vow of serving the whole nation and the world, it has made outstanding achievements in the process of institute development and has been widely recognized by the society. CWI has now become important organization working for the welfare of women and children.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4318">'''Choroidal neovascularization''' ('''CNV''') is the creation of new blood vessels in the [[choroid]] layer of the [[human eye|eye]]. Choroidal neovascularization is a common cause of neovascular degenerative maculopathy (i.e. 'wet' [[macular degeneration]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Spalton DJ, Hitchings RA, Hunter PA | title = Atlas of Clinical Ophthalmology | edition = 3rd | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; commonly exacerbated by extreme myopia, malignant myopic degeneration, or age-related developments.

==Causes==
CNV can occur rapidly in individuals with defects in [[Bruch's membrane]], the innermost layer of the [[choroid]]. It is also associated with excessive amounts of [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF). As well as in wet macular degeneration, CNV can also occur frequently with the rare genetic disease [[pseudoxanthoma elasticum]] and rarely with the more common [[optic disc drusen]].  CNV has also been associated with extreme myopia or malignant myopic degeneration, where in choroidal neovascularization occurs primarily in the presence of cracks within the retinal (specifically) macular tissue known as lacquer cracks.

==Symptoms==
CNV can create a sudden deterioration of central vision, noticeable within a few weeks. Other symptoms which can occur include colour disturbances, and [[metamorphopsia]] (distortions in which straight lines appears wavy). Hemorrhaging of the new blood vessels can accelerate the onset of symptoms of CNV. CNV may also include the feeling of pressure behind your eye.

==Identification==
CNV can be detected by using a type of [[perimetry]] called [[preferential hyperacuity perimetry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ophsource.org/periodicals/ophtha/article/S0161-6420(05)00815-8/abstract |title=Elsevier |publisher=Ophsource.org |accessdate=2012-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of [[fluorescein angiography]], CNV may be described as classic or occult. Two other tests that help identify the condition include [[indocyanine green]] angiography and [[optical coherence tomography]].&lt;ref name="Reddy"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Reddy U, Krzystolik M |title= Antiangiogenic therapy with interferon alfa for neovascular age-related macular degeneration |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=1 |pages= CD005138 |date=2006 |pmid= 16437522|doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD005138.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
CNV is conventionally treated with [[vitreous body|intravitreal]] injections of [[angiogenesis inhibitors]] (also known as "anti-VEGF" drugs) to control neovascularization and reduce the area of fluid below the retinal pigment epithelium.  Angiogenesis inhibitors include [[pegaptanib]], [[ranibizumab]] and [[bevacizumab]] (known by a variety of trade names, such as Macugen, Avastin or Lucentis). These inhibitors slow or stop the formation of new blood vessels ([[angiogenesis]]), typically by binding to or deactivating the transmission of [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] ('VEGF'), a signal protein produced by cells to stimulate formation of new blood vessels. The effectiveness of angiogenesis inhibitors has been shown to significantly improve visual prognosis with CNV, the recurrence rate for these neovascular areas remains high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Takeda|first=AL|author2=Colquitt, J |author3=Clegg, AJ |author4= Jones, J |title=Pegaptanib and ranibizumab for neovascular age-related macular degeneration: a systematic review.|journal=The British Journal of Ophthalmology|date=Sep 2007|volume=91|issue=9|pages=1177–82|pmid=17475698|doi=10.1136/bjo.2007.118562|pmc=1954893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CNV may also be treated with [[photodynamic therapy]] coupled with a photosensitive drug such as [[verteporfin]] (Visudyne). The drug is given [[intravenously]]. It is then activated in the eye by a laser light. The drug destroys the new blood vessels, and prevents any new vessels forming by forming [[thrombi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Donati|first=Guy|title=Emerging Therapies for Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration: State of the Art|journal=Ophthalmologica|year=2007|volume=221|issue=6|pages=366–377|doi=10.1159/000107495|pmid=17947822}}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 December 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2954">'''Clinical documentation improvement''' ('''CDI''') is the recognized process of improving healthcare records to ensure improved patient outcomes, data quality and accurate reimbursement. The profession was developed in response to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Diagnostic-Related Group (DRG) system, and gained greater notice around 2007.&lt;ref name="life"/&gt;

CDI professionals act as intermediaries between [[Clinical coder|Inpatient coders]] who translate diagnoses into data and healthcare providers and nurses. As many clinical coders don't have patient care backgrounds, and healthcare providers might not realize the importance of accurate documentation, the CDI professional serves to make the connection between these two groups.&lt;ref name="life"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nursingcenter.com/lnc/JournalArticle?Article_ID=1493953&amp;Journal_ID=54016&amp;Issue_ID=1493946 |title=The secret life of a clinical documentation improvement specialist |last=Brown |first=Linda Renee |journal=Nursing |volume=43 |issue=2)(Supplement 1 |date=February 2013|pages=10–12|doi=10.1097/01.NURSE.0000426541.97687.87}}&lt;/ref&gt;
CDI professionals should be familiar with [[Diagnosis-related group|Medicare Severity DRGs (MS-DRG)]] [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|ICD-9 to ICD-10]] coding.

The Association of Clinical Documentation Improvement Specialists (ACDIS), part of HCPro, Inc., is a provider of integrated information, education, training, and consulting products and services in healthcare regulation and compliance.

The Association for Integrity in Health Care Documentation (AIHCD) offers a C-CDI certification. The American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA), which also offers the certified documentation improvement professional (CDIP) credential.&lt;ref name="life"/&gt;

Healthcare documentation serves as a legal document, validates the patient care provided, facilitates claims processing, coding, billing and reimbursement, and facilitates quality reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihs.gov/california/assets/File/GPRA/BP2012-ClinicalDocumentationImprovement-Hailes.pdf|title=Truly Understanding Clinical Documentation Improvement for ICD-10|last=Hailes|first=John|year=2012|website=U.S. Indian Health Service|accessdate=17 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Constrictive pericarditis.jpg|thumb|Constrictive pericarditis]]
'''Constrictive pericarditis''' is a medical condition characterized by a thickened, fibrotic [[pericardium]], limiting the heart's ability to function normally.&lt;ref name="NIH2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=Contrictive pericarditis|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001103.htm|website=Medline Plus|publisher=NIH|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, the condition continues to be difficult to diagnose and therefore benefits from a good understanding of the underlying cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwefer|first1=Markus|last2=Aschenbach|first2=Rene|last3=Heidemann|first3=Jan|last4=Mey|first4=Celia|last5=Lapp|first5=Harald|title=Constrictive pericarditis, still a diagnostic challenge: comprehensive review of clinical management|journal=European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery|date=September 2009|volume=36|issue=3|pages=502–510|doi=10.1016/j.ejcts.2009.03.004|url=http://ejcts.oxfordjournals.org/content/36/3/502.long|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms of constrictive pericarditis are consistent with the following: [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], swollen abdomen, difficulty breathing ([[dyspnea]]), swelling of legs and general weakness. Related conditions are bacterial pericarditis, pericarditis and pericarditis after a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]].&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt;

==Causes==
The cause of constrictive pericarditis in the developing world are idiopathic in origin, though likely infectious in nature.  In regions where [[tuberculosis]] is common, it is the cause in a large portion of cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunn|first1=editor, Brian P. Griffin ; associate editors, Thomas D.

Murphy, Margaret A.|title=Mayo Clinic cardiology : concise textbook|date=2013|publisher=Mayo Clinic Scientific Press/Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-199915712|page=718|edition=4th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WSCRAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA718&amp;dq=pulmonary+asbestos++constrictive+pericarditis&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAGoVChMI9JvQ8pqIyAIViJ2ACh3Lzgdx#v=onepage&amp;q=pulmonary%20asbestos%20%20constrictive%20pericarditis&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pathophysiology ==
The pathophysiological characteristics of constrictive pericarditis are due to a thickened, [[fibrotic pericardium]] that forms a non-compliant shell around the heart.  This shell prevents the heart from expanding when blood enters it.  This results in significant respiratory variation in blood flow in the chambers of the heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crouch|first1=[edited by] Michael A.|title=Cardiovascular pharmacotherapy : a point-of-care guide|date=2010|publisher=American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|location=Bethesda, Md.|isbn=978-1-58528-215-9|page=376|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U5MZBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT388&amp;dq=constrictive+pericarditis+mechanism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAjgKahUKEwjsqIP8vojIAhXL1IAKHY_iB6Q#v=onepage&amp;q=constrictive%20pericarditis%20mechanism&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During inspiration, pressure in the [[thoracic cavity]] decreases but is not relayed to the [[left atrium]], subsequently a reduction in flow to the left atrium and ventricle happens. During diastole, less blood flow in left ventricle allows for more room for filling in right ventricle and therefore a septal shift occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Camm|first1=Demosthenes G. Katritsis, Bernard J. Gersh, A. John|title=Clinical cardiology : current practice guidelines|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-968528-8|page=388|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ZjrAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA388&amp;lpg=PA388&amp;dq=constrictive+pericarditis+definition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_ufHtxkAli&amp;sig=BmRWeAGaa8kLw1K1PwHMhQ6Y-jE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBDgKahUKEwjF9bGpwYjIAhUI04AKHfC6BSc#v=onepage&amp;q=constrictive%20pericarditis%20definition&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During expiration, the amount of blood entering the right ventricle will decrease, allowing the [[interventricular septum]] to bulge towards the right ventricle, and increased filling of the [[left ventricle and subsequent increased pressure generated by the left ventricle during systole.This is known as [[ventricular interdependence]], since the amount of blood flow into one ventricle is dependent on the amount of blood flow into the other ventricle.{{medical citation needed|date=September 2015}}

== Diagnosis ==
The diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis is often difficult to make.  In particular, [[restrictive cardiomyopathy]] has many similar clinical features to constrictive pericarditis, and differentiating them in a particular individual is often a diagnostic dilemma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Restrictive pericarditis|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/153062-differential|website=eMedicine|publisher=MedScape|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Chest X-Ray]] - pericardial calcification (common but not specific), pleural effusions are common findings.&lt;ref name="peri2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=Imaging in Constrictive pericarditis|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/348883-overview|website=eMedicine|publisher=MedScape|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Echocardiography]] - the principal echographic finding is changes in cardiac chamber volume.&lt;ref name=peri2015/&gt;
* CT and [[MRI]] - useful in select cases.&lt;ref name=peri2015/&gt;
*BNP blood test -  tests for the existence of the cardiac hormone [[brain natriuretic peptide]], which is only present in RCMP but not in CP&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Semrad|first1=Michal|title=Cardiovascular Surgery|date=2014|publisher=Charles University|isbn=978-80-246-2465-5|page=114|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VaVxBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA114&amp;dq=BNP+blood+test+constrictive+pericarditis&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAGoVChMIxKi106yIyAIVCpqACh0jjg1s#v=onepage&amp;q=BNP%20blood%20test%20constrictive%20pericarditis&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==
The definitive treatment for constrictive pericarditis is [[pericardiectomy|pericardial stripping]], which is a surgical procedure where the entire pericardium is peeled away from the heart.  This procedure has significant risk involved,&lt;ref name="Cinar-2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cinar B, Enc Y, Goksel O, Cimen S, Ketenci B, Teskin O, Kutlu H, Eren E | title=Chronic constrictive tuberculous pericarditis: risk factors and outcome of pericardiectomy | journal=Int J Tuberc Lung Dis | year=2006 | volume=10 | issue=6 | pages=701–6 | pmid=16776460}}&lt;/ref&gt; with mortality rates of 6% or higher in major referral centers.&lt;ref name="Chowdhury-2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chowdhury UK, Subramaniam GK, Kumar AS, Airan B, Singh R, Talwar S, Seth S, Mishra PK, Pradeep KK, Sathia S, Venugopal P | title=Pericardiectomy for constrictive pericarditis: a clinical, echocardiographic, and hemodynamic evaluation of two surgical techniques | journal=Ann Thorac Surg | year=2006 | volume=81 | issue=2 | pages=522–9 | pmid=16427843 | doi=10.1016/j.athoracsur.2005.08.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A poor outcome is almost always the result after a pericardiectomy is performed for constrictive pericarditis whose origin was radiation-induced, further some patients may develop heart failure post-operatively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greenberg|first1=editors, Jeffrey D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2026">'''Da'ud Abu al-Fadl''' (1161–1242) was a [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] [[Jew]]ish physician who lived in the [[Ayyubid Sultanate|Ayyubid Egypt]] in the twelfth century CE. He born in [[Cairo]] in 1161 and died there about 1242. Having studied medicine under the Jewish physician [[Hibat Allah ibn Jami]], and under [[Abu al-Fafa'il ibn Naqid]], he became the court physician of the sultan [[Al-Adil I|al-Malik al-'Adil Abu Bakr ibn Ayyub]], the brother and successor of [[Saladin]]. He was also chief professor at the [[al-Nasiri Hospital]] at Cairo, where he had a great many pupils, among them being the historian [[ibn Abi Usaibiyyah]]. The latter declared that Abu al-Fadl was the most skillful physician of the time and that his success in curing the sick was miraculous. Abu al-Fadl was the author of an Arabic pharmacopoeia in twelve chapters, entitled ''Aḳrabadhin'', and treating chiefly of antidotes.

There are at least two hundred and twelve detailed '''drawings by Douglas Hamilton''' of [[South India]]n [[Landscape art|landscapes]], [[game (food)|game animals]] and [[Forest management|forestry operations]].  Eighty seven of Hamilton's careful [[drawing]]s of the [[Annaimalai Hills]], [[Palani Hills]] and [[Shevaroy Hills]] are in the [[British Library]],&lt;ref name="BLB"/&gt;  ninety six drawings were published in his autobiography, ''Records of Sport in Southern India...'' and an additional thirty one were published in ''Forests and Gardens of South India''.

Lieutenant-Colonel [[Douglas Hamilton]] (1818 – 1892) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Presidency armies|Indian Army]] officer, gazetted to the 21st Regiment of the [[Madras Army|Madras Native Infantry]] from 1837 to 1871.&lt;ref name="Ham"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamilton|first=General Douglas|title=Records of sport in southern India chiefly on the Annamullay, Nielgherry and Pulney mountains, also including notes on Singapore, Java and Labuan, from journals written between 1844 and 1870|editor=Hamilton, Edward|publisher= R.

He was an acute observer of [[nature]] and a [[Gentleman#Modern usage|gentleman]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, p. xxxviii&lt;/ref&gt;

Though executed only in [[pen and ink]] or pencil, these drawings have [[artistic merit]] due to the artists skillful use of [[hatching]] and [[stippling]] to achieve [[Realism (arts)|realistic]] [[Texture (visual arts)|texture]], [[Shading#Drawing|shading]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]].  Hamilton's illustration of subjects and backgrounds that are unfamiliar to most people, creates initial interest in his drawings. His effective portrayal of actual or implied recent or future dramatic [[Action (philosophy)|action]] heightens the viewers interest in his subjects. Hamilton selected his sketches that best illustrate scenes in his writing.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, p. v.&lt;/ref&gt; This implies there were also additional drawings, however their existence is now unknown.

==Government drawings==
[[File:Douglas_Hamilton,_1870.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Douglas Hamilton, 1870, age 52]]
In 1862 Colonel Hamilton was relieved of routine regimental Army duties and given a [[roving commission]] by [[Sir Charles Trevelyan, 1st Baronet|Sir Charles Trevelyan]], the Finance Minister of India and former [[Governors_Of_Madras#Governors_.28of_British_India.29|Governor]] of [[Madras Presidency]], to conduct surveys and make drawings for the Government of all the [[Hill_station#India_.28by_state.29|hill plateau]]s in Southern India that might suit as Sanitaria, or quarters for European troops. Thereafter, Douglas Hamilton was on "special duty" with the 44th Regiment, Madras Native Infantry.&lt;ref name="PP"&gt;{{cite book|authors= Great Britain Parliament.

A series of five albums of careful drawings of the [[Annaimalai Hills]], [[Palani Hills]] and [[Shevaroy Hills]] was the result of this commission. While at work on this commission he had great opportunities to follow his favorite pursuit of [[big game hunting]], and also to observe the habits of the various animals inhabiting the different districts. These well-known drawings showed him as an accurate observer and a careful draughtsman. Each series of drawings was accompanied by a [[Survey article]] describing all aspects of the district.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, p.xiii&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of his publications about these surveys include:

== ''Records of Sport'' ==
[[File:Douglas Hamilton, Records of Sport in Southern India.jpg|thumb|200px|Leather cover of ''Records of Sport in Southern India...'']]Hamilton's brother Edward was the editor of Douglas Hamilton's 1892 autobiography, ''"Records of Sport in Southern India, Chiefly on the Annamullay, Nielgherry and Pulney Mountains, also Including Notes on Singapore, Java and Labuan, ..."''. It is about "years long gone by when the [[muzzle loader]], with all its drawbacks, was the chief weapon in use."&lt;ref name="Ham"/&gt;  All ninety five drawings in ''Records of Sport...''  (with the exception of three) were taken from his sketch books. All scenes illustrated in these drawings are based on the actual hunting experiences of Colonel Hamilton described in full detail in his Autobiography.

Those he drew in [[Indian ink]] were transferred as [[facsimile]]s by means of [[Etching|photo-etching]]. The others, sketched in pencil, were copied by Mr. J. T. Smit with such care and accuracy that the touch, as well as the spirit, of the original sketches was fully retained. The three plates of the two species of [[Bustard|florican]] and of the [[jungle cat]] are from drawings made expressly for ''Records of Sport''  by Mr. Smit. Several types of [[Big-game hunting|big game]] are the primary subject of most of these Drawings. Only a few of the drawings overlap with those in the India Office collection. He also drew several landscapes of [[Singapore]], [[Java]] and [[Labuan]] during his visit there in 1848. The Drawings are:

==''Forests and Gardens of South India''==
In 1861, 13 plates and 17 figures of drawings by Douglas Hamiton were published in [[Hugh Francis Cleghorn#Forests and gardens of South India|''The Forests and Gardens of South India'']] written by his friend and co-conservator [[Hugh Francis Cleghorn]]. Several of the drawings were [[lithograph]]ed by Mr. W. H. Macfarane, Edinburgh. Most of the drawings were technical illustrations of forestry operations, though some depicted landscapes of forested areas.&lt;ref name="Cleghorn"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cleghorn|first=Hugh Francis Clarke |title=The Forests and Gardens of South India |publisher=W.

==Self-portraits==
Hamilton often portrayed himself in his drawings. He is shown at different times with [[sideburns|mutton chop sideburns]] or a [[full beard]]. He is almost always shown holding his rifle and facing to the right. These self-portraits are cropped from drawings in ''Records of Sport...'':

{{Ebola virus disease epidemic}}
In 2014, '''Ebola virus disease in Spain''' occurred due to two patients with cases of the disease contracted during the [[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa]]; they were [[medical evacuation|medically evacuated]].&lt;ref name=spa/&gt;&lt;ref name=spa1/&gt; A failure in infection control in the treatment of the second patient led to an isolated infection of Ebola virus disease in a health worker in Spain itself. The health worker survived her Ebola infection, and has since been declared infection-free.&lt;ref name=ABC2014 /&gt;

== Initial medevac cases ==
{{Main|West African Ebola virus epidemic}}
On 5 August 2014, the [[Brothers Hospitallers of St. John of God]] confirmed that Brother Miguel Pajares, who had been volunteering in Liberia, had become infected. He was evacuated to Spain on 6 August 2014, and subsequently died on 12 August.&lt;ref name="spa"&gt;{{cite web |title=Muere el religioso español Miguel Pajares a causa del ébola |url=http://www.rtve.es/noticias/20140812/muere-religioso-espanol-miguel-pajares-causa-del-ebola/991420.shtml |publisher=RTVE |date=12 August 2014 |accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 September it was announced that Brother Manuel García Viejo, another Spanish citizen who was medical director at the [[San Juan de Dios Hospital]] in [[Lunsar]], had been evacuated to Spain from Sierra Leone after being infected with the virus. His death was announced on 25 September.&lt;ref name="spa1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/ebola-outbreak-spanish-missionary-manuel-garcia-viejo-dies-deadly-virus-madrid-1467233|title=Ebola Outbreak: Spanish Missionary Manuel Garcia Viejo Dies of Deadly Virus in Madrid|date=25 September 2014|accessdate=25 September 2014|work=International Business Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these cases were treated at the [[Hospital Carlos III]] in Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Una auxiliar de enfermería que atendió al misionero fallecido García Viejo, contagiada de ébola|url=http://www.elmundo.es/madrid/2014/10/06/5432bb62e2704e347a8b4577.html|publisher=El Mundo|accessdate=6 October 2014|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medical personnel infection ===
[[File:Excalibur (24).jpg|thumb|left|Protest against euthanasia of Romero Ramos' pet dog]]
In October 2014, María Teresa Romero Ramos, an [[healthcare assistant|auxiliary nurse]] who had cared for Manuel García Viejo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2014/1006/650268-ebola/|title=Spanish nurse tests positive for Ebola|publisher=RTE|date=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Hospital Carlos III had become unwell and on 6 October tested positive for Ebola at her local hospital in [[Alcorcón]], the [[Hospital Universitario Fundación Alcorcón]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/10/08/world/europe/ebola-spain/|title=Hospital worker: Spaniard exposed in ER for 8 hours after positive Ebola test|publisher=CNN|author1=Greg Botelho |author2=Laura Smith-Spark |author3=Laura Perez Maestro |date=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nurse 'infected with Ebola' in Spain|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29514920|accessdate=6 October 2014|agency=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MinderNYT9Oct/&gt; A second test confirmed the diagnosis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cadenaser.com/sociedad/articulo/enfermera-ingresada-alcorcon-da-positivo-ebola/csrcsrpor/20141006csrcsrsoc_5/Tes|title=La enfermera ingresada en Alcorcón da positivo por ébola -- La segunda prueba ha dado positivo y confirma el diagnóstico |publisher=Cadena Ser|date=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; making this the first confirmed case of Ebola transmission outside Africa. Following testing, she was transferred to the [[Hospital Carlos III]] in Madrid for treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La segunda enfermera ingresada da negativo en la prueba del virus|url=http://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2014-10-07/la-segunda-enfermera-ingresada-da-negativo-en-la-prueba-del-virus_229489/|date=2014-10-07|publisher=El Confidencial|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 7, 50 contacts were being monitored, with 7 kept in isolation at the Hospital Carlos III, and an investigation was under way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/08/world/europe/after-its-first-ebola-case-spain-seeks-to-prevent-spread-of-virus.html|title=Demands for an Explanation Grow After a Nurse in Spain Contracts Ebola|publisher=New York Times|date=2014-10-07|author=Raphael Minder}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/World/News/More-health-workers-hospitalised-in-Spain-Ebola-scare-20141009|title=More health workers hospitalised in Spain Ebola scare|work=News24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 October, Madrid's regional government got a court order to euthanize Romero's pet dog, Excalibur, concerned that it posed a risk as a [[reservoir host]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/science/ebola-dog-excalibur-nurse-spain.html&lt;/ref&gt;  By the afternoon there were over 30 animal rights activists who had barricaded the apartment to prevent officials from removing the dog.  A number of online petitions were started rallying to save the dog, garnering hundreds of thousands of indications of support.  Ramos' quarantined husband, Javier, called on a veterinarian radio show host, and recorded a video appeal, for help to save his dog.  On 8 October, Spanish authorities removed, sedated and euthanized the dog and arranged for the safe disposal of its remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/World/News/Spanish-Ebola-nurses-pet-dog-put-down-20141008|title=Spanish Ebola nurse's pet dog put down|work=News24|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 October the Spanish health ministry quarantined three more people.&lt;ref name=MinderNYT9Oct&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/world/europe/ebola-spain-nurse-hospital.html|title=Spain Quarantines 3 More Over Ebola|author=Raphael Minder|date=9 October 2014|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The health authorities announced that Maria Teresa Romero Ramos' condition had worsened significantly.&lt;ref name=minder9octworsened&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/world/europe/ebola-spain-nurse-hospital.html|title=Condition of Spanish Nurse With Ebola Worsens, Officials Say|author=Raphael Minder|date=9 October 2014|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 12, she began to show some improvement. 
According to one report, the improvement may be attributed to Romero's having received the experimental drug [[ZMab]] which is similar to [[ZMapp]], which has been used to treat several Ebola patients.   However, according to information released by Spain's Centre for Health and Emergency Alerts, the nurse did not receive ZMab due to concerns over possible side-effects.&lt;ref name="experintal_zmap_1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/ebola-infected-spanish-nurse-improving-health-source-article-1.1970896|title=Ebola-infected Spanish nurse improving after dose of experimental drug ZMapp: health source |publisher=NEW YORK DAILY NEWS|date=October 11, 2014|accessdate=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="experintal_zmap"&gt;{{cite news|title=Public Health Agency gives Spain, Norway ZMapp-like drug to treat Ebola cases|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/health/public-health-agency-gives-spain-norway-zmapp-like-drug-to-treat-ebola-cases-1.2053402|publisher=The Local Europe|date=16 October 2014 |accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romero, however, was given the experimental antiviral drug [[Favipiravir]], and it was reported that the dosages used were much higher than those used in the treatment of other patients.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.es/sociedad/20141024/abci-ebola-dosis-antiviral-teresa-201410241656.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical staff in Madrid protested about the lack of effective protective equipment and safety precautions.&lt;ref name=minder9octworsened/&gt; It was reported on October 17 that all the other people suspected of being infected in Spain had tested negative for the Ebola virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/17/two-suspected-ebola-cases-spain-test-negative-disease|title=All four suspected Ebola cases in Spain test negative for the disease|date=17 October 2014|publisher=The Guardian|author=Ashifa Kassam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 20 it was announced that Teresa Romero had tested negative for the Ebola virus,&lt;ref name=ABC2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-10-20/spanish-nurse-infected-with-ebola-no-longer-has-virus/5825720|title=Ebola crisis: Tests show Spanish nurse Teresa Romero no longer has the virus|publisher = ABC News|date= 20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting she may have cleared the virus from her system. On November 1, it was announced that she was Ebola-free, and had been moved out of the isolation ward into a normal hospital bed to finish the process of recuperation from her illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/spanish-woman-cured-ebola-moves-normal-room-26624899|title=Spanish Woman Cured of Ebola Moves to Normal Room|author=Harold Heckle|date=1 November 2014|publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO declared Spain Ebola-free on 2 December, 42 days after Teresa Romero was shown to be free of Ebola on 21 October.&lt;ref name ="Spain_Ebola_outbreak_2_Dec"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/spain-ebola-free-nurse-recovery-27300284|title=WHO Says Spain Ebola-Free Following Nurse Recovery|date=2 December 2014|accessdate=2 December 2014|publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, a Spanish team from the [[:es:Hospital 12 de Octubre|October 12 Hospital]] in [[Madrid]] announced the discovery of an [[antibody]] and the development of a prototype vaccine against five strains of Ebola, including the most common and deadliest.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thelocal.es/20180712/spanish-researchers-develop-five-strain-vaccine-ebola&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.euroweeklynews.com/news/on-euro-weekly-news/spain-news-in-english/1473157-vaccine-for-killer-ebola-virus-being-developed-by-spanish-researchers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.redaccionmedica.com/autonomias/madrid/el-12-de-octubre-descubre-unicornio-el-anticuerpo-contra-el-ebola--3299&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20178">The '''Ecclesia Athletic Association''' (EAA) was an organization founded by [[Eldridge Broussard]] in 1975, with the stated mission of helping children escape the dangers of [[Downtown Los Angeles|inner-city Los Angeles]] through strict discipline and [[athletic training]]. In 1987, the group moved from its headquarters in the [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]] neighborhood of Los Angeles to [[Sandy, Oregon]]. The group sometimes attracted accusations that it was a [[cult]], often from neighbors or the family of members inside the group.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Broussard publicly denied the label, including in 1984 and in a 1988 appearance on the [[The Oprah Winfrey Show]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-10-20/local/me-5471_1_fatal-beating|title=Ecclesia Children Saw Fatal Beating, Oregon D.A.

The EAA became defunct in October 1988 after the death of Eldridge's daughter, Dayna Broussard, prompted the removal of the remaining 53 children in the organization's care and an investigation into the group. The investigation found that the children were subject to extreme fitness training and physical punishments, including [[Flagellation|floggings]]. Four EAA staff members were convicted of manslaughter, while Broussard and seven others were charged with child slavery by the Federal government. Broussard died before the trial, while the other seven pleaded guilty to lesser charges. 
 
== Founding ==
The Ecclesia Athletic Association (EAA) was founded in the [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]] neighborhood of [[Los Angeles]] in 1975 as a sister organization to the Watts Christian Center, a church.&lt;ref name="LAT"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-09-06/news/mn-1749_1_cult-leader-broussard|title=Indicted Cult Leader Broussard Dies: Commune: Ex-Watts minister faced charges of enslaving children at Oregon farm|last=Stolberg|first=Sheryl|date=1991-09-06|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-09-29|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.apnews.com/bc9be8e44a2fdcf11ea69b1659c0cf83|title=Founder of Ecclesia Assn, Where Girl Beaten To Death in 1988, Dies At 39|last=McCall|first=William|date=2018-09-05|work=AP News|access-date=2018-09-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broussard had been a basketball star at [[Pacific University]], was drafted by the [[Portland Trail Blazers]], and was ordained a minister.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; He founded the Ecclesia Athletic Association with the goal to "lift children out of the dead-end ghetto life through athletic training and strict discipline".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With the help of donations which for some members amounted to their entire salaries, the church was able to buy an Avalon Boulevard bakery to serve as a commune.&lt;ref name="LAT" /&gt;

In 1977 Broussard shifted his focus from the Watts Christian Center, which had lost most of its membership, to the Ecclesia Athletic Association, founded by Broussard and the few remaining members of the Christian Center.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-11-01/news/mn-636_1_miracle-child|title=Miracle Child Was Messiah to Followers in Watts Group|last=Murphy|first=Kim|date=1988-11-01|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecclesia sponsored a successful 32-team basketball league, the largest in Los Angeles at the time, and Broussard's sister ran a school focusing on nutrition;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.oregonlive.com/clackamascounty/index.ssf/1988/10/ecclesia_death_and_contradicti.html|title=Ecclesia: Death and contradictions in Oregon compound|last=Ellis|first=Barnes|date=1988-10-23|work=OregonLive.com|access-date=2018-09-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; children in the care of the Ecclesia Athletic Association stopped receiving formal schooling in 1984.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-11-15/local/me-255_1_reform-schools|title=Children of Ecclesia Slow to Cut Ties to Past|last=Stolberg|first=Sheryl|date=1988-11-15|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, accusations that the group was a cult were being made publicly.

== Move to Oregon ==
The bulk of the group's members moved to [[Sandy, Oregon]], in 1987,&lt;ref name="WaPo"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1988/10/25/ecclesia-group-was-a-mystery-to-community_until-girl-died/b337131c-6fec-44e4-a1c8-479dfcff12a2/|title=Ecclesia Group was a Mystery to Community until Girl Died|last=Parker|first=Laura|date=1988-10-25|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-09-29|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; though they did maintain their Avalon Boulevard headquarters.&lt;ref name="LAT" /&gt; The Sandy property offered a lot more space–{{convert|18.5|acre}}–on which Broussard told neighbors they planned to build pools and gymnasiums.&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt;  Broussard told the neighbors of their "plan for the welfare of a lost generation".&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt; Ecclesia bragged of the extensive calisthenics, including one to five thousand continuous [[jumping jack]]s that the children in its care could do as part of the goal of training them to be Olympic athletes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt;

By late 1988 Ecclesia housed 53 children ranging in age from six weeks to sixteen years,&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt; and the group had a second house in [[Clackamas County, Oregon|Clackamas]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The parents of these children were all members of the group; they had been forced to sign a vow of poverty upon joining the group which put themselves, their children, and their assets under Broussard's control.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt; The life of residents in Oregon was highly regimented, with the children training under the supervision of Broussard's oldest son, Eldridge Broussard III, who had been born in 1976.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; During a reporter's visit to Oregon, teens and adults were observed working long days in the fields, unable to talk or sing because it would, according to a group spokeswoman, lower productivity.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Jackson, who was 18 and a trainer when the EAA moved to Oregon, described the conditions as basic.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Neighbors did not notice any signs of bruising or other scars when they saw the children, and lent advice and equipment to Ecclesia for their farming activities.&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some neighbors did experience unusual interactions with the children, not seeing them play, and once one of the children explained she was unable to speak to a neighbor who should instead talk to Ecclesia's minister of external affairs. Some neighbors feared the group was a cult reminiscent of the followers of [[Rajneesh]].&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt;  Their suspicions grew when Ecclesia began planting more crops, claimed to have grown {{convert|91000|lb}} of produce, and attempted to secure permission to place more tents and outdoor toilets across its property in order to legally house 100 people.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-06-29/news/mn-233_1_vow|title=Ecclesia to Drop Housing Proposal|last=From United Press International|first=|date=1987-06-29|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Neighbors who suspected that the children were being abused repeatedly called authorities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A deputy who was dispatched after several complaints found 50 children living in a sweltering garage but took no action, with the Oregon Children's Services Division also declining to investigate, as association members explained the children were in a training session.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt; Following an outcry at the zoning application by its neighbors, which included the public release of the vow of poverty, Ecclesia withdrew its application and seemingly abandoned the property in October 1987.&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The group had also faced resistance from neighbors in Clackamas, where Broussard was informed his land was zoned for farming, not for housing large numbers of children.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Death of Dayna Broussard ==
On October 14, 1988, four members of Ecclesia, Willie K. Chambers, Brian James Brinson, Constance Zipporah Jackson, and Frederick Paul Doolittle, brought the body of Dayna Broussard, Eldrige's 8-year-old daughter and the second oldest of five children, to the Sandy fire station.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt; The four were arrested and charged with [[Manslaughter (United States law)|manslaughter]].&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt; Eldridge had been in Los Angeles at the time of his daughter's death,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but members of Ecclesia had begun returning to Sandy two months earlier.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While investigating the death of Dayna, child welfare officials learned that 42 of the 53 children, all those who were older than five, were subjected to beatings of at least 100 lashes with paddles and an electrical cord and had been scarred.&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The children were also regularly forced to watch others being punished; many had watched the punishment of Dayna which led to her death.&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt; In an [[affidavit]], officials described a "cruel and terrifying experience, giving rise to mental injury".&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt; The children were also regularly forced to go with limited food, sleep on the floor, and share only one or two working bathrooms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt; Authorities explained that no children had attempted to run away because Ecclesia was the only life they knew.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Broussard said that the conditions authorities found were due to inexperienced members being placed in charge of the children while he was away. He defended the punishments while talking about the beatings he had experienced from his father and the cultural differences between Watts and Oregon.&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1988/10/20/A-Los-Angeles-ghetto-pastor-said-Thursday-allegations-of/3854593323200/|title=A Los Angeles ghetto pastor said Thursday allegations of...|last=Lesar|first=Jack|date=1988-10-20|work=UPI|access-date=2018-09-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his daughter's death, Broussard announced he was going to shut down both the Ecclesia Athletic Association and the Watts Christian Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-07-25/news/mn-1036_1_broussard|title=Ecclesia Leader Tells Mourners He'll Suspend Group's Activities|last=Press|first=From Associated|date=1987-07-25|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ecclesia continued to operate.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-07-08/local/me-2678_1_children-returned-plan|title=Plan for Return of Children Rejected|date=1989-07-08|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath, Broussard's brother Alvin was arrested for beating a 10-year-old boy at their Watts headquarters but prosecutors declined to charge Alvin with a felony.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Oregon Children's Services Division defended their failure to investigate, stating: "The issues raised were not neglect or child abuse, which is the only reasons we can go out in an investigation. They felt that the kids weren't being parented properly and that's not something we go out on. If we went out on every case of parenting skills, first of all we couldn't do it, and second, people would be angry at us".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Removal of children to state care ==
Once in state care, most of the children were placed in two [[reform schools]], with the remainder being placed in [[foster care]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; During this time, the children expressed more of a desire to see Broussard than their own parents.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The children acted much younger than their age and had little in the way of traditional schooling, instead having biblical and fitness knowledge.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The children were "abnormally quiet and compliant" when initially entering care, but became more rowdy when they discovered they would not be beaten for misbehaving.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The state attempted to recoup over $30,000 (${{Inflation|index=US|value=30,000|start_year=1988|fmt=c}} in present US dollars) in costs of caring for the children removed from their parents,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-11-13/local/me-4426_1_oregon-attorney|title=Oregon Has Difficulty Obtaining Child Care Debt|date=1990-11-13|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the overall costs of the care were substantially more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-01-12/local/me-314_1_ecclesia-founder|title=Local News in Brief :  Funds for Care of Ecclesia Youths OKd|date=1989-01-12|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the end of 1988, Oregon state officials wanted to return some children to California to live with relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-12-03/local/me-919_1_oregon-authorities|title=Oregon Prepares to Return Some Ecclesia Children to California|last=Stolberg|first=Sheryl|date=1988-12-03|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; These plans were complicated a few weeks later when the children's parents, who had been visiting their children, announced that they would stop visiting as they refused to renounce their connection to Ecclesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-01-25/news/mn-1040_1_parents-letter|title=Ecclesia Parents Cut Off Visits to Their Children|last=Services|first=From Times Wire|date=1989-01-25|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecclesia faced its own roadblocks in reunification when a judge blocked its request in July 1989 to let the children participate in a summer camp.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Officials also tried, unsuccessfully, to prevent the children from meeting with defense lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-12-08/local/me-1162_1_ecclesia-children|title=Local News in Brief: Ecclesia Children to Be Questioned|date=1988-12-08|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal proceedings==
The trial of Chambers, Brinson, Jackson, and Doolittle lasted three weeks. Many were angry that the defendants were only charged with manslaughter in Dayna's death, which the prosecutor explained by stating that more serious charges would have required more evidence of intent.&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt; During the trial, prosecutors said that Dayna's punishment stemmed from her stealing zucchini from another child and escalated from there.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1989/05/12/Four-Ecclesia-defendants-convicted-of-manslaughter/6721610948800/|title=Four Ecclesia defendants convicted of manslaughter|last=Mosier|first=Laura|date=1989-05-12|work=UPI|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the Ecclesia children testified that Dayna had been beaten 200 to 845 times, while children and adults testifying for the defense said it was 50 to 100 times.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; After a day of deliberation, the jury found all four defendants guilty of first-degree manslaughter.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; At the sentencing, Broussard asked the judge for [[clemency]], but the four were sentenced to the maximum 20 years. Brinson and Doolittle were eligible for parole in 40 months, Chambers and Jackson were eligible for parole in 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1989/06/23/Ecclesia-members-get-20-years-in-beating-death/8133614577600/|title=Ecclesia members get 20 years in beating death|last=Dipietro|first=Benji|date=|work=UPI|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 7, 1991, Federal prosecutors indicted Broussard, his brother, Chambers, Jackson, and four others for [[child slavery]] under the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]], and denying children their civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/10/us/commune-chief-charged-with-child-slavery.html|title=Commune Chief Charged With Child Slavery|last=AP|access-date=2018-09-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.questia.com/read/117457302/cults-in-our-midst|title=Cults in Our Midst|last=Singer|first=Margaret Thaler|date=2003|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=|isbn=0-7879-6741-6|edition= Rev.|location=San Francisco, CA|pages=85|oclc=50803257|subscription=yes|via=Questia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1991-02-09-9101070722-story.html|title=L.S.

Brinson was released early from his 20-year prison sentence. In 2002 he was charged with several counts of sexual abuse and found guilty of one count. The charges were unrelated to his involvement in Ecclesia. In May 2013, he was shot to death by two teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://katu.com/archive/man-convicted-in-1988-ecclesia-death-shot-to-death|title=Man convicted in 1988 'Ecclesia' death shot to death|work=KATU|access-date=2018-09-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally founded in 1988 by Mark Miller in [[Vancouver, Washington]], '''First Aid Only''' was a solution to produce a better [[first aid kit]] for the average consumer than the options available at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/company/first-aid-only |title=First Aid Only |publisher=linkedin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== History ==

=== 1988 - 1997 ===

After noticing the lack of quality of first aid kits available for home and business use, First Aid Only was founded in 1988. The first products were all-purpose kits that were made available to small businesses and consumers across the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akama.com/company/First_Aid_Only_Inc_a9849451579.html |title=First Aid Only, Inc. |publisher=akama.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company’s initial first aid kit, coined FAO-134, remains successful today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walmart.com/ip/First-Aid-Only-FAO-134-All-Purpose-First-Aid-Kit-Large-Pls-200-Pieces-Each/21782944 |title=First Aid Only FAO-134 All-Purpose First Aid Kit |publisher=walmart.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In years thereafter, the company continued to expand the number of offerings. By 1992, First Aid Only was generating $3.4 million in sales and moved to a modern 50,000 square-feet facility in Vancouver, Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/company/first-aid-only |title=First Aid Only |publisher=linkedin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1998 – 2014 ===

After 10 years, the company started focusing on [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration (OSHA)]] compliance products for the workspace. As part of this business expansion, the company thoughtfully decided to continue to do all of its assembly and distribution work in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbian.com/news/2012/jan/30/firm-retains-local-focus/ |title=First Aid Only retains local focus |publisher=columbian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its search for product innovation and improvement of delivery mechanisms for first aid products, First Aid Only acquired First Aid Exchange in 2006. First Aid Exchange owned the rights to SmartCompliance, a first aid solution that makes it convenient for organizations to remain compliant with OSHA as well as [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI standards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/company/first-aid-only |title=First Aid Only |publisher=linkedin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, [[Acme United Corporation]] acquired First Aid Only for $13.8 million. First Aid Only had revenues in 2013 of $17.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbian.com/news/2014/jun/05/rival-buys-first-aid-only-vancouver |title=Rival buys First Aid Only for $13.8M |publisher=columbian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the acquisition, Acme United started making capital investments in First Aid Only’s Vancouver facility, both through mechanization and staffing increases.

== First Aid Only as an Acme United Brand ==

Acme United has been in the first aid business for over 40 years and was a competitor of First Aid Only with its PhysiciansCare and [[Pac-Kit First Aid Kits|Pac-Kit]] brands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbian.com/news/2014/jun/05/rival-buys-first-aid-only-vancouver |title=Rival buys First Aid Only for $13.8M |publisher=columbian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined, the three brands are among the top-10 producers of first aid kits in the United States, and they accounted for 35% of Acme United’s total sales in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20140602-910225.html |title=Acme United Corporation Acquires Assets of First Aid Only, Inc  |publisher=wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Acme United consolidated its production facilities. As such, the Pac-Kit production was moved from [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Connecticut]] to the First Aid Only plant in Washington state. This resulted in production efficiencies and cost savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/3578736-acme-united-corporations-acu-ceo-walter-johnsen-on-q3-2015-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single |title=Acme United Corporation's Q3 2015 Earnings Call Transcript |publisher=seekingalpha.com.}} Retrieved on December 21, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, First Aid Only is will known for its SmartCompliance kits. Most businesses are federally mandated to have first aid solutions that are compliant with OSHA as well as ANSI standards. These SmartCompliance first aid supply cabinets ensure that a business is covered.

The discipline of '''forensic epidemiology (FE)''' is a hybrid of principles and practices common to both [[forensic medicine]] and [[epidemiology]]. FE is directed at filling the gap between clinical judgment and epidemiologic data for determinations of causality in civil [[lawsuits]] and criminal prosecution and defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freeman|first1=Michael|last2=Zeegers|first2=Maurice|title=Forensic Epidemiology: Principles and Practices|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780124045842|url=http://store.elsevier.com/product.jsp?isbn=9780124045842}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koehler|first=Steven A.|last2=Freeman|first2=Michael D.|date=2014-06-01|title=Forensic epidemiology: a method for investigating and quantifying specific causation|journal=Forensic Science, Medicine, and Pathology|volume=10|issue=2|pages=217–222|doi=10.1007/s12024-013-9513-8|issn=1556-2891|pmid=24272789}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freeman|first=Michael D.|last2=Rossignol|first2=Annette M.|last3=Hand|first3=Michael L.|date=2009-02-01|title=Applied forensic epidemiology: the Bayesian evaluation of forensic evidence in vehicular homicide investigation|journal=Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine|volume=16|issue=2|pages=83–92|doi=10.1016/j.jflm.2008.08.017|issn=1752-928X|pmid=19135003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freeman|first=Michael D.|last2=Rossignol|first2=Annette M.|last3=Hand|first3=Michael L.|date=2008-07-01|title=Forensic Epidemiology: a systematic approach to probabilistic determinations in disputed matters|journal=Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine|volume=15|issue=5|pages=281–290|doi=10.1016/j.jflm.2007.12.009|issn=1752-928X|pmid=18511002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forensic epidemiologists formulate [[evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] probabilistic conclusions about the type and quantity of causal association between an antecedent harmful exposure and an injury or disease outcome in both populations and individuals. The conclusions resulting from an FE analysis can support legal decision-making regarding guilt or innocence in criminal actions, and provide an evidentiary support for findings of [[causation (law)|causal association]] in civil actions.

Applications of forensic epidemiologic principles are found in a wide variety of types of civil litigation, including cases of medical negligence, toxic or mass tort, pharmaceutical adverse events, medical device and consumer product failures, traffic crash-related injury and death, person identification and life expectancy.

== History of FE ==
The term Forensic Epidemiology was first associated with the investigation of bioterrorism in 1999, and coined by Dr. Ken Alibek, the former chief deputy of the Soviet bioweapons program. The scope of FE at that time was confined to the investigation of epidemics that were potentially man-made. After the US Anthrax attacks of 2001 the CDC defined forensic epidemiology as a means of investigating possible acts of bioterrorism.

At the present time FE is more widely known and described as the systematic application of epidemiology to disputed issues of causation that are decided in (primarily) civil, but also criminal courts. The use of epidemiologic data and analysis as a basis for assessing general causation in US courts, particularly in toxic tort cases, has been described for more than 30 years, beginning with the investigation of the alleged relationship between exposure to the Swine Flu vaccine in 1976 and subsequent cases of Guillain–Barré syndrome.[http://www.fjc.gov/public/pdf.nsf/lookup/SciMan3D12.pdf/$file/SciMan3D12.pdf]

More recently FE has also been described as an evidence-based method of quantifying the probability of specific causation in individuals. The approach is particularly helpful when a clinical differential diagnosis approach to causation is disputed. Examples covering a wide variety of applications of FE are listed below under Examples of Investigative Questions Addressed by Forensic Epidemiologists.

== FE Methods and Principles ==

=== Comparative Risk Ratio ===
The metric of a case-specific FE analysis of cause is the comparative risk ratio (CRR).  The CRR is a unique metric to FE; it allows for the comparison of probabilities applicable to the investigated circumstances of an individual injury or disease.  Because a CRR is based on the unique circumstances surrounding the injury or disease of an individual, it may or may not be derived from a population-based [[relative risk]] (RR) or [[odds ratio]] (OR). An example of an RR analysis that could be used as a CRR  is as follows: for an unbelted driver who was seriously injured in a traffic crash, an important causal question might be what role the failure to use a seat belt played in causing his injury. A relevant RR analysis would consist of the examination of the frequency of serious injury in 1000 randomly selected unbelted drivers exposed to a 20&amp;nbsp;mph frontal collision versus the frequency of serious injury in 1000 randomly selected restrained drivers exposed to the same collision severity and type. If the frequency of serious injury in the group exposed to the presumptive hazard (failure to use a seat belt) was 0.15 and the frequency in the unexposed (belted) group was 0.05, then the CRR would be the same thing as the RR of 0.15/0.05. The RR design of the analysis dictates that the populations that the numerator and denominator of the CRR  are substantially similar in all respects, with the exception of the exposure to the investigated hazard, which was the failure to use a seat belt in the example.

In some instances encountered in a legal setting, however, the numerator and denominator risk must be derived from dissimilar populations in order to fit the circumstances of an investigated injury or disease. In such a case the CRR cannot be derived from either an RR or OR. An example of such a situation occurs when the numerator is a per event risk, and the denominator is a per-time risk (also known as a cumulative risk). An example of this type of analysis would be the investigation of a pulmonary embolism (PE) that occurred a week after a patient sustained a lower extremity fracture in a traffic crash. Such complications often result from blood clots forming in the legs and then traveling to the lungs. If the patient had a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremities prior to the crash, then a CRR might consist of the comparison between the risk of a PE following a lower extremity fracture (a per event rate) and  the 1-week risk of PE in a patient with DVT (a time-dependent probability).

Another example of a CRR based on dissimilar populations is when there are only a limited number of potential causes to be compared. An example is the investigation of the cause of an adverse reaction in a person who took two different drugs at the same time, both of which could have caused the reaction (and which, for the example, do not interact with each other). In such a situation, the CRR applicable to the unique circumstances experienced by the individual could be estimated by comparing the adverse reaction rate for the two drugs.

=== Attributable Proportion Under the Exposed ===
The attributable proportion under the exposed (AP&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; ) is an indication of the proportion of patients who were exposed to the potential cause and got sick because of this exposure. It can only be used if the RR &gt;1 and can be calculated by [(RR-1)/RR X 100%]. When the CRR is based on an RR, these formulae also apply to the CRR. The result of the analysis, given as an RR, CRR, or AP&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; , meets the legal standard of what is “''[[Legal burden of proof|more likely true than not]]'',”  when the RR or CRR is &gt;2.0 (with a 95% confidence interval lower boundary of &gt;1.0), or the AP&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is &gt;50%. The AP&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is also known as the "''Probability of Causation'' (PC)" a term that is defined in the US Code of Federal Regulations ([https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ocas/pdfs/42cfr81/42cfr81.pdf Federal Register / Vol. 67, No. 85 / Thursday, May 2, 2002 / Rules and Regulations p. 22297]) and elsewhere.

=== Causal Methodology ===
Analysis of causation, particularly for injury or other conditions with a relatively short latency period between exposure and outcome, is accomplished using a 3-step approach, as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freeman|first=Michael D.|last2=Centeno|first2=Christopher J.|last3=Kohles|first3=Sean S.|date=2009-10-01|title=A systematic approach to clinical determinations of causation in symptomatic spinal disk injury following motor vehicle crash trauma|journal=PM &amp; R: the journal of injury, function, and rehabilitation|volume=1|issue=10|pages=951–956|doi=10.1016/j.pmrj.2009.07.009|issn=|pmid=19854423|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Plausibility: This first step addresses whether it is biologically ''possible'' for the injury event to have caused the condition (a.k.a. general causation), and follows a special application of the viewpoints set forth by Hill (see below). A finding of plausibility is unrelated to the ''frequency'' of the injury, because even if the injury occurs in only 1 in 100 or fewer cases of exposure to the event, it is still ''plausibly'' caused by the event. Plausibility is a relatively low hurdle to clear in a causal analysis, and is largely satisfied by the lack of evidence of ''implausibility'' of the relationship. Plausibility is often, but not necessarily, established with epidemiologic data or information.
# Temporality: This second step examines the clinical and other evidence of the timing between the onset of the symptoms of injury and the injury event, and must be satisfied to assess specific causation. First, it must be established that the sequence of the injury and the event is appropriate; the symptoms cannot be identically present prior to the event. Further, the onset of the symptoms of injury cannot be either too latent or insufficiently latent, depending on the nature of the exposure and outcome.
# Lack of a more probable alternative explanation: This final step examines the probability of the injury condition occurring at the same point in time in the individual, given what is known about the individual from the review of medical records and other evidence, but in the absence of the injury event (a.k.a. differential diagnosis). First, evidence of competing injury events must be evaluated, and compared for risk (often via analysis of epidemiologic data). Then, the likelihood of the condition occurring spontaneously must be assessed, given the known history of the individual.

==== United States Case Law on Injury Causation Methodology ====
The 3-step methodology was challenged in United States District Court for the District of Colorado in ''Etherton v Auto-Owners Insurance Company.''[https://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/colorado/codce/1:2010cv00892/118960/145] The defendant challenged, among other things, the reliability and fit of the methods described by the expert. After an extensive examination and discussion of the 3-step process used by the expert, the Court found that the methodology appropriately fit the specific facts of the case, and that a population-based (epidemiologic) approach was an appropriate part of the causal methodology. The Court denied the Defendant’s motion to strike the expert’s testimony in the order, which was entered on 3/3l/l4.

The Defendant appealed the ruling from the District Court, and in July 2016, the Tenth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed the 3-step causal methodology as generally accepted and well established for assessing injury causation, under the [[Daubert standard]].  See ''Etherton v. Auto-Owners Insurance Company'', No. 14-1164 (10th Cir, 7/l9/l6)[https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/14/14-1164.pdf].

==== The Hill Viewpoints ====
[[Biological plausibility|Plausibility]] of an investigated association can be assessed in an FE investigation, in part, via application of the [[Bradford Hill criteria|Hill criteria]], named for a 1965 publication by Sir Austin Bradford-Hill, in which he described nine “viewpoints” by which an association described in an epidemiologic study could be assessed for causality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hill|first=A. B.|date=1965-05-01|title=THE ENVIRONMENT AND DISEASE: ASSOCIATION OR CAUSATION?|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine|volume=58|pages=295–300|issn=0035-9157|pmc=1898525|pmid=14283879}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill declined to call his viewpoints “criteria”  lest they be considered a checklist for assessing causation. The term “ Hill criteria”  is used widely in the literature, however, and for convenience is used in the present discussion. Of the nine criteria, there are seven that have utility for assessing the plausibility of an investigated specific causal relationship, as follows:
* Coherence: A causal conclusion should not contradict present substantive knowledge. It should “ make sense”  given current knowledge
* Analogy: The results of a previously described causal relationship may be translatable to the circumstances of a current investigation
* Consistency: The repeated observation of the investigated relationship in different circumstances or across a number of studies lends strength to a causal inference
* Specificity: The degree to which the exposure is associated with a particular outcome
* Biological plausibility: The extent to which the observed association can be explained by known scientific principles
* Experiment: In some cases there may be evidence from randomized experiments (''i.e.'', drug trials)
* Dose response: The probability, frequency, or severity of the outcome increases with increased amount of exposure
[[File:Assessing the role of a confounder.png|thumb|The triangular relationship between exposure, outcome, and confounder. When investigating whether there is a causal relationship between an exposure and outcome of interest, the influence of extraneous variables needs to be taken into account. A confounder is defined as a concurrent cause of the outcome under investigation that is related to, but not a consequence of, the exposure of interest.]]
Subsequent authors have added the feature of [[Challenge–dechallenge–rechallenge|Challenge/ Dechallenge/ Rechallenge]] for circumstances when the exposure is repeated over time and there is the ability to observe the associated outcome response, as might occur with an adverse reaction to a medication. Additional considerations when assessing an association are the potential impact of [[confounding]] and [[Bias of an estimator|bias]] in the data, which can obscure a true relationship. Confounding refers to a situation in which an association between an exposure and outcome is all or partly the result of a factor that affects the outcome but is unaffected by the exposure. Bias refers to a form of error that may threaten the validity of a study by producing results that are systematically different from the true results. Two main categories of bias in epidemiologic studies are [[selection bias]], which occurs when study subjects are selected as a result of another unmeasured variable that is associated with both the exposure and outcome of interest; and [[Information bias (epidemiology)|information bias]], which is systematic error in the assessment of a variable. While useful when assessing a previously unexplored association, there is no combination or minimal number of these criteria that must be met in order to conclude that a plausible relationship exists between a known exposure and an observed outcome.

In many FE investigations there is no need for a causal plausibility analysis if a general causal relationship is well established. In large part, plausibility of a relationship is entertained once implausibility has been rejected. The two remaining Hill criteria are temporality  and strength of association. While both criteria have utility in assessing specific causation, temporality is the feature of an association that must be present, at least with regard to sequence (''i.e.'', the exposure must precede the outcome), in order to consider a relationship causal. Temporal proximity can also be useful in some specific causation evaluations, as the closer the investigated exposure and the outcome are in time the less opportunity there is for an intervening cause to act. Another feature of temporality that may have a role in a specific causation evaluation is latency. An outcome may occur too soon or too long after an exposure to be considered causally related. As an example, some food borne illnesses must incubate for hours or days after ingestion, and thus an illness that begins directly following a meal, and which is later found to be caused by a food borne microorganism that requires &gt;12 h incubation, was not caused by the investigated meal, even if an investigation were to reveal the microorganism in the ingested food. Strength of association is the criterion that is used in general causation to assess the impact of the exposure on the population, and is often quantified in terms of RR. In a specific causation evaluation the strength of the association between the exposure and the outcome is quantified by the CRR, as described above.
[[File:Contingency table of test accuracy metrics.png|thumb|A contingency table, also called a crosstabulation, of possible test outcomes, and the associated equations for evaluating test accuracy.]]

=== Test Accuracy ===
Test accuracy investigation is a standard practice in clinical epidemiology. In this setting, a diagnostic test is scrutinized to determine by various measures how often a test result is correct. In FE the same principles are used to evaluate the accuracy of proposed tests leading to conclusions that are central to fact finder determinations of guilt or innocence in criminal investigations, and of causality in civil matters. The utility of a test is highly dependent on its accuracy, which is determined by a measure of how often a positive or negative test result truly represents the actual status that is being tested. For any test or criterion there are typically four possible results: (1) a true positive (TP), in which the test correctly identifies tested subjects with the condition of interest; (2) a true negative (TN), in which the test correctly identifies test subjects who do not have the condition of interest; (3) a false positive (FP), in which the test is positive even though condition is not present, and; (4) a false negative (FN) in which the test is negative even though the condition is present. Fig. 3.19 is a contingency table illustrating the relationships between test results and condition presence, as well as the following test accuracy parameters:
* [[Sensitivity and specificity|Sensitivity]] (the rate at which the test is positive when the condition is present) TP/(TP + FN)
* [[Sensitivity and specificity|Specificity]] (the rate at which the test is negative when the condition is absent) TN/(TN + FP)
* [[Positive and negative predictive values|Positive predictive value]] (the rate at which the condition is present when the test is positive) TP/(TP + FP)
* [[Positive and negative predictive values|Negative predictive value]] (the rate at which the condition is absent when the test is negative) TN/(TN + FN)

=== Bayesian Reasoning ===
Probability is used to characterize the degree of belief in the truth of an assertion. The basis for such a belief can be a physical system that produces outcomes at a rate that is uniform over time, such as a gaming device like a roulette wheel or a die. With such a system, the observer does not influence the outcome; a fair six-sided die that is rolled enough times will land on any one of its sides 1/6th of the time. An assertion of a probability based in a physical system is easily tested with sufficient randomized experimentation. Conversely, the basis for a high degree of belief in an asserted claim may be a personally held perspective that cannot be tested. This does not mean that the assertion is any less true than one that can be tested. As an example, one might truthfully assert that “if I eat a banana there is a high probability that it will make me nauseous” based upon experience unknown to anyone but one’s self. It is difficult to test such assertions, which are evaluated through collateral evidence of plausibility and analogy, often based on similar personal experience. In forensic settings, assertions of belief are often characterized as probabilities, that is, ''what is most likely'', for a given set of facts. For circumstances in which a variety of conditions exist that may modify or “ condition”  the probability of a particular outcome or scenario, a method of quantifying the relationship between the modifying conditions and the probability of the outcome employs [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian reasoning]], named for [[Bayes' theorem|Bayes’ Theorem]] or Law upon which the approach is based. Most simply stated, Bayes’ Law allows for a more precise quantification of the uncertainty in a given probability. As applied in a forensic setting, Bayes’ Law tells us what we want to know given what we do know. Although Bayes’  Law is known in forensic sciences primarily for its application to DNA evidence, a number of authors have described the use of Bayesian reasoning for other applications in forensic medicine, including identification and age estimation.

=== Post-test Probability and Positive Predictive Value ===
The [[Pre- and post-test probability|post-test probability]] is a highly useful Bayesian equation that allows for the calculation of the probability that a condition is present when the test is positive, conditioned by the pretest prevalence of the condition of interest. This equation is given in box to the right:
[[File:Post-test probability.png|thumb|Post-test probability equation]]
The equation results in a positive predictive value for a given pre-event or pretest prevalence. In a circumstance in which the pretest prevalence is considered “indifferent” the prevalence and (1-prevalence) values cancel out, and the calculation is a simplified to a positive predictive value.

[[File:Brie 01.jpg|thumb|right|Cheese, like this [[Brie de Meaux]], is high in saturated fats, and is a popular food in [[French cuisine]].]]
The '''French paradox'''  is a [[catchphrase]], first used in the late 1980s, that summarizes the apparently paradoxical [[epidemiological]] observation that [[French people]] have a relatively low [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of [[coronary heart disease]] (CHD), while having a diet relatively rich in [[saturated fat]]s,&lt;ref name="ferrieres"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ferrieres, J. | year = 2004 | url = http://heart.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/90/1/107 | title = The French Paradox; Lessons for other countries | journal = Heart | volume = 90 | pages = 107–111 | doi = 10.1136/heart.90.1.107 | pmid = 14676260 | issue = 1 | pmc = 1768013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in apparent contradiction to the [[Saturated fat and cardiovascular disease|widely held belief that the high consumption of such fats is a risk factor for CHD]].  The paradox is that if the thesis linking saturated fats to CHD is valid, the French ought to have a higher rate of CHD than comparable countries where the per capita consumption of such fats is lower.

The French paradox implies two important possibilities. The first is that the hypothesis linking saturated fats to CHD is not completely valid (or, at the extreme, is entirely invalid). The second possibility is that the link between saturated fats and CHD is valid, but that some additional factor in the French diet or lifestyle mitigates this risk—presumably with the implication that if this factor can be identified, it can be incorporated into the diet and lifestyle of other countries, with the same lifesaving implications observed in France. Both possibilities have generated considerable media interest, as well as some scientific research.

It has also been suggested that the French paradox is an illusion, created in part by differences in the way that French authorities collect health statistics, as compared to other countries, and in part by the long-term effects, in the coronary health of French citizens, of changes in dietary patterns which were adopted years earlier.&lt;ref name="Law &amp; Wald"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Law, M.  |author2=Wald, N. | year = 1999 | title = Why heart disease mortality is low in France: the time lag explanation | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 318 | pages = 1471–1480 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.318.7196.1471 | issue = 7196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identifying and quantifying the French paradox==
The term "French Paradox" was first used in ''The Letter'', the newsletter of the [[International Organisation of Vine and Wine]], in 1986. In 1989, theatre Professor George Riley Kernodle of the [[University of Arkansas]] used the term in a chapter in his book ''Theatre In History'', later republished as a separate academic paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George Riley Kernodle|title=Theatre In History|publisher=[[University of Arkansas]] Press|date=December 1, 1989|ISBN=978-1557280121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Serge Renaud, a scientist from [[Bordeaux University]], France—considered today the father of the phrase—presented the results of his scientific study into the term and actual scientific data behind the perception of the phrase.&lt;ref name=LancetSimini&gt;{{cite journal | title = Serge Renaud: from French paradox to Cretan miracle | journal = The Lancet | volume = 355 | issue = 9197 | pages = 48 | author = B. Simini | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)71990-5 | year = 2000 | pmid=10615898}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a public documentary broadcast on the American [[CBS News]] television channel, ''[[60 Minutes]]''.

Renaud's observations regarding the apparent disconnect between French patterns of high saturated fat consumption and their low rates of cardiovascular disease can be quantified using data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faostat.fao.org/faostat/servlet/XteServlet3?Areas=68&amp;Areas=231&amp;Items=2941&amp;Items=2740&amp;Items=2741&amp;Items=2901&amp;Items=2733&amp;Elements=684&amp;Years=2002&amp;Format=Table&amp;Xaxis=Years&amp;Yaxis=Countries&amp;Aggregate=&amp;Calculate=&amp;Domain=FS&amp;ItemTypes=FS.NonPrimaryLivestockAndProducts&amp;language=EN FAOSTAT] {{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=November 2015}} In 2002, the average French person consumed 108&amp;nbsp;grams per day of fat from animal sources, while the average American consumed only 72 grams. The French eat four times as much butter, 60 percent more cheese and nearly three times as much pork. Although the French consume only slightly more total fat (171 g/d vs 157 g/d), they consume much more saturated fat because Americans consume a much larger proportion of fat in the form of vegetable oil, with most of that being soybean oil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faostat.fao.org/faostat/servlet/XteServlet3?Areas=68&amp;Areas=231&amp;Items=2571&amp;Items=2573&amp;Items=2914&amp;Elements=684&amp;Years=2002&amp;Format=Table&amp;Xaxis=Years&amp;Yaxis=Countries&amp;Aggregate=&amp;Calculate=&amp;Domain=FS&amp;ItemTypes=FS.CropsAndProducts&amp;language=EN FAOSTAT] {{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to data from the [[British Heart Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heartstats.org/datapage.asp?id=744ytfytfy Tab 3.5 RSD web08: Age-standardised rate of finished consultant episodes for operations for CHD by sex and local authority, all ages and under 75 years, 2001/06, England (Table)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204082418/http://www.heartstats.org/datapage.asp?id=744ytfytfy |date=4 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1999, rates of death from [[coronary heart disease]] among males aged 35–74 years were 115 per 100,000 people in the U.S. but only 83 per 100,000 in France.

In 1991, Renaud extended his studies in partnership with then junior researchers, [[cardiologist]] Michel de Lorgeril and [[dietician]] Patricia Salen. The three enhanced Renaud's study, with their paper concluding that: a diet based on southwestern [[Mediterranean cuisine]]; which is high in [[omega-3]] oils, antioxidants and includes "moderate consumption" of [[red wine]]; created lower cases of [[cancer]], [[myocardial infarction]] and [[cardiovascular disease]]; partly through increasing HDL cholesterol whilst reducing LDL cholesterol.&lt;ref name=LancetSimini/&gt;

== Statistical illusion hypothesis ==
In 1999, Malcolm Law and Nicholas Wald published a study in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'',&lt;ref name="Law &amp; Wald" /&gt;  using data from a 1994 study of alcohol and diet to explain how the French paradox might actually be an illusion, caused by two statistical distortions.

First, Law and Wald attributed about 20% of the difference in the observed rates of CHD between France and the United Kingdom to the [[under-certification]] of CHD in France, relative to the UK.

Second, Law and Wald presented a time-lag hypothesis: if there were a delay in serum cholesterol concentrations increasing and a subsequent increase in [[ischaemic heart disease]] mortality, then the current rate of mortality from CHD is more likely to be linked to past levels of serum cholesterol and fat consumption than to current serum cholesterol levels and patterns of fat consumption. They wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;We propose that the difference is due to the time lag between increases in consumption of animal fat and serum cholesterol concentrations and the resulting increase in mortality from heart disease—similar to the recognised time lag between smoking and lung cancer. Consumption of animal fat and serum cholesterol concentrations increased only recently in France but did so decades ago in Britain.

Evidence supports this explanation: mortality from heart disease across countries, including France, correlates strongly with levels of animal fat consumption and serum cholesterol in the past (30 years ago)....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition, the French population has become increasingly overweight. A study published by the [[French Institute of Health and Medical Research]] (INSERM) revealed an increase in obesity from 8.5% in 1997 to 14.5% in 2009, with women showing a greater tendency toward obesity than men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Nestlé Bringing American-Style Diet Plans to Europe |author=Matthew Saltmarsh |date=7 March 2010 |newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/08/business/global/08diet.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
Much commentary has been based on the assumption that the French paradox is real and is not the statistical distortion posited by Law and Wald.  If the French paradox is regarded as real, the  most obvious implication is that under certain circumstances, it is possible for individuals to consume a diet rich in saturated fats, and nonetheless avoid cardiovascular disease. Therefore, proposed explanations for the paradox have attracted considerable interest in other countries, including the creation of considerable demand for foods or supplements said to explain the paradox. The search for an explanation for the paradox has also led to some additional research.

===Cultural impact===
The overall impact of the popular perception, in the English-speaking world, that the French paradox is a real phenomenon, has been to give added credibility to health claims associated with specific French dietary practices.

This was seen most dramatically when, in 1991, an early account of the then-novel concept of the French paradox was aired in the United States on ''[[60 Minutes]].'' The broadcast left the impression    that France's high levels of red wine consumption accounted for much of the country's lower incidence of cardiac disease. Within a year, the consumption of [[red wine]] in the United States had increased by 40%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Phillips | first = Rod | title = Alcohol: A History | publisher = University of North Carolina Press Books | year = 2014 | pages = 517 | isbn = 978-1-4696-1760-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some wine sellers began promoting their products as "[[health food]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1992-11-06/news/1992311065_1_french-paradox-alcohol-red-wine]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural impact of the French paradox can be seen in the large number of book titles in the diet-and-health field which purport to give the reader access to the secrets behind the paradox: 
*''The Fat Fallacy: The French Diet Secrets to Permanent Weight Loss'' (William Clower, 2003);
*''The French Don't Diet Plan: 10 Simple Steps to Stay Thin for Life'' (William Clower, 2006)
*''French Women Don't Get Fat'' (Mireille Guiliano, 2004, which became a #1 best-seller in 2006)
*''Cholesterol and The French Paradox'' (Frank Cooper, 2009);
*''The French Women Don't Get Fat Cookbook'' (Mireille Guiliano, 2010).

Other books sought to boost their credibility by reference to the French paradox.  The American edition of ''[[Dukan Diet|The Dukan Diet]]'', written by Pierre Dukan, a Paris-based doctor, is marketed with the subtitle, “The real reason the French stay thin.”

===Scientific impact===
The existence of the French paradox has caused some researchers to speculate that the link between dietary consumption of saturated fats and coronary heart disease might not be as strong as had previously been imagined. This has resulted in a review of the earlier studies which had suggested this link.

Some researchers have thrown into question the entire claimed connection between natural saturated fat consumption and cardiovascular disease. In 2006 this view received some indirect support from the results of the [[Nurses' Health Study]] run by the [[Women's Health Initiative]]. After accumulating approximately 8 years of data on the diet and health of 49,000 post-menopausal American women, the researchers found that the balance of saturated versus unsaturated fats did not appear to affect heart disease risk, whereas the consumption of [[trans fat]] was associated with significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Couzin, Jennifer | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/311/5762/755 | title = Women's Health: Study Yields Murky Signals on Low-Fat Diets and Disease | journal = Science | year = 2006 | volume = 311 | issue = 5762 | pmid = 16469884 | pages = 755 | doi = 10.1126/science.311.5762.755}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the authors of a 2009 review of dietary studies concluded that there was insufficient evidence to establish a causal link between consumption of saturated fats and coronary heart disease risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/169/7/659 | title = A Systematic Review of the Evidence Supporting a Causal Link Between Dietary Factors and Coronary Heart Disease |author1=Andrew Mente |author2=Lawrence de Koning |author3=Harry S.

==Possible explanations==

===Explanations based on the high per capita consumption of red wine in France===
It has been suggested that France's high [[red wine]] consumption is a primary factor in the trend. This hypothesis was expounded in a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' broadcast in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=4750380n The French Paradox], ''CBS News'', 23 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The program catalysed a large increase in North American demand for red wines from around the world. It is believed that one of the components of red wine potentially related to this effect is [[resveratrol]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/11/081126122203.htm Potentially Universal Mechanism Of Aging Identified], ''ScienceDaily'', 27 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  however, the authors of a 2003 study concluded that the amount of resveratrol absorbed by drinkers of red wine is small enough that it is unlikely to explain the paradox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0009-9120(02)00397-1 |title=Absorption of three wine-related polyphenols in three different matrices by healthy subjects |year=2003 |last1=Goldberg |first1=David M. |last2=Yan |first2=Joseph |last3=Soleas |first3=George J. |journal=Clinical Biochemistry |volume=36 |pages=79–87 |pmid=12554065 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Red Wine Glass.jpg|thumb|right|A glass of red wine]]

====Alcohol in wine====
{{Main|Alcohol and cardiovascular disease}}

Research suggests that moderate drinkers are less likely to suffer [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]]s than are abstainers or heavy drinkers (see [[alcohol and cardiovascular disease]] for details). Therefore, the alcohol in wine might be a factor in the French paradox.

However, the difference between U.S. annual ''per capita'' alcohol consumption (9.2 litres per year)&lt;ref&gt;WHO [http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/global_alcohol_report/profiles/usa.pdf report on alcohol consumption in the United States of America]&lt;/ref&gt; and French consumption (12.2 litres per year) is only 3 litres per year more.&lt;ref&gt;WHO [http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/global_alcohol_report/profiles/fra.pdf report on alcohol consumption in France]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a lack of medical consensus about whether moderate consumption of beer, wine, or distilled spirits has a stronger association with longevity. Of ten major studies, three found stronger evidence for wine, three for beer, three for liquor, and one study found no difference between alcoholic beverages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Edell | first = D. | title = Eat, Drink and be Merry: America’s Doctor Tells You Why the Health Experts are Wrong | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 1999 | pages = 191–192 | isbn = 0-06-019155-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Resveratrol====
{{Main|Resveratrol}}

Wines, particularly red wines, are a source of low levels of [[resveratrol]]. High doses of resveratrol have been linked to longevity and cancer prevention in other species.&lt;ref name=Liu2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=BL|author2=Zhang, X|author3= Zhang, W|author4= Zhen, HN|title=New enlightenment of French Paradox: resveratrol's potential for cancer chemoprevention and anti-cancer therapy.|journal=Cancer biology &amp; therapy|date=December 2007|volume=6|issue=12|pages=1833–6|pmid=18087218|url=http://www.landesbioscience.com/journals/cbt/article/5161/|doi=10.4161/cbt.6.12.5161}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although research continues on resveratrol, the concentration in wine seems too low to account for the French paradox.

====Polyphenols====
[[Oligomeric procyanidins]] have been proposed to offer protection to human vascular cells,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/444566a | title = Oenology: Red wine procyanidins and vascular health | year = 2006 | last1 = Corder | first1 = R. | last2 = Mullen | first2 = W. | last3 = Khan | first3 = N.

J. | last7 = Crozier | first7 = A. | journal = Nature | volume = 444 | issue = 7119 | pages = 566 | pmid = 17136085}}&lt;/ref&gt; with other research indicating that red wine polyphenols reduce absorption of [[malondialdehyde]] which is implicated in elevating levels of [[low-density lipoprotein]] in the onset of [[arteriosclerosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=22530973|year=2012|author1=Kanner|first1=J|title=Protection by polyphenols of postprandial human plasma and low-density lipoprotein modification: The stomach as a bioreactor|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|volume=60|issue=36|pages=8790–6|last2=Gorelik|first2=S|last3=Roman|first3=S|last4=Kohen|first4=R|doi=10.1021/jf300193g}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, once digested and metabolized, the role of polyphenols to assert possible health effects in humans cannot be determined.&lt;ref name="lpi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/phytochemicals/flavonoids|title=Flavonoids|publisher=Linus Pauling Institute, Micronutrient Information Center, Oregon State University|date=2015|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although polyphenols are speculated to be part of the health-promoting effects of wine consumption, no evidence exists to date that ingesting polyphenols from red wine or food sources actually provides health benefits.&lt;ref name="EFSA"&gt;{{cite journal|author=EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA)2, 3 European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), Parma, Italy|url=https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1489 |title=Scientific Opinion on the substantiation of health claims related to various food(s)/food constituent(s) and protection of cells from premature aging, antioxidant activity, antioxidant content and antioxidant properties, and protection of DNA, proteins and lipids from oxidative damage pursuant to Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/20061|journal= EFSA Journal|year= 2010|volume= 8|issue=2|page=1489|doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Explanations based on aspects of the French diet===

====The French diet is rich in short-chain saturated fatty acids and poor in trans fats====
In his 2009 book ''Cholesterol and The French Paradox'', Frank Cooper argues that the French paradox is due to the lack of hydrogenated and [[trans fats]] in the French diet.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Frank A. ''Cholesterol and The French Paradox''. Lulu.com Publishing, 2009, pp 136–149.&lt;/ref&gt; The French diet is based on natural [[saturated fats]] such as butter, cheese and cream that the human body finds easy to metabolize, because they are rich in shorter saturated fatty acids ranging from the 4-carbon [[butyric acid]] to the 16-carbon [[palmitic acid]]. But the American diet includes greater amounts of saturated fats made via [[hydrogenation|hydrogenating]] vegetable oils which include longer 18- and 20-carbon fatty acids.  In addition, these hydrogenated fats include small quantities of [[trans fats]] which may have associated health risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hu | first = FB |author2=van Dam RM |author3=Liu S.Hu FB |author4=van Dam RM |author5=Liu S

====Explanations relying on multiple factors====
In his 2003 book, ''The Fat Fallacy: The French Diet Secrets to Permanent Weight Loss'', Will Clower suggests the French paradox may be narrowed down to a few key factors, namely:
* Good fats versus bad fats — French people get up to 80% of their fat intake from dairy and vegetable sources, including [[whole milk]], cheeses, and whole milk [[yogurt]].
* Higher quantities of fish (at least three times a week).
* Smaller portions, eaten more slowly and divided among courses that let the body begin to digest food already consumed before more food is added.
* Lower sugar intake — American low-fat and no-fat foods often contain high concentrations of sugar. French diets avoid these products preferring full-fat versions without added sugar.
* Low incidence of snacks between meals.
* Avoidance of common American food items, such as soda, deep-fried foods, snack foods, and especially prepared foods which can typically make up a large percentage of the foods found in American grocery stores.

Clower tends to downplay the common beliefs that wine consumption and smoking are greatly responsible for the French paradox. While a higher percentage of French people smoke, this is not greatly higher than the U.S. (35% in France vs. 25% in U.S.) and is unlikely to account for the weight difference between countries.

[[Mireille Guiliano]], author of the 2006 bestseller ''French Women Don't Get Fat'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E3D71530F93AA35757C0A9609C8B63 Paperback best sellers], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 9 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; agrees that the weight differences are not due to French smoking habits.  She points out that the smoking rates for women in France and the U.S. are virtually identical.&lt;ref name=mireilleguiliano&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080124145431/http://www.mireilleguiliano.com/qanda.htm Arhive.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Guiliano explains the key factors to the French woman's ability to stay slim as:
* Smaller portion sizes: - she advocates the 50% rule, i.e. asking for half of whatever food one is offered, "la moitié, s'il vous plaît" in French [http://frenchwomendontgetfat.com/french_phrases/L]
* Savoring food to increase the feeling of satisfaction, choosing a small amount of high quality food rather than larger amounts of low quality food
* Eating 3 meals a day and not snacking
* Taking in plenty of liquid such as water, herbal tea and soup
* Sitting down and eating mindfully (no multitasking and eating while standing up, watching TV, or reading)
* Emphasizing freshness, variety, balance, and, above all, pleasure&lt;ref name=mireilleguiliano/&gt;

==== Whole diet ====
In his 2008 book ''[[In Defense of Food]]'', [[Michael Pollan]] suggests the explanation is not any single nutrient, but the combination of nutrients found in unprocessed food; not any one nutrient, nor the amount of carbohydrates or fats or proteins, but the whole length and breadth of nutrients found in "natural" foods as opposed to "processed" foods.&lt;ref&gt;Pollan, Michael ''In Defense of Food''. Penguin Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Higher fruit and vegetable intake ====
It has been suggested that a higher intake of fruit and vegetables in the diet may lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=23736950|year=2013|author1=Hartley|first1=L|title=Increased consumption of fruit and vegetables for the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=6|pages=CD009874|last2=Igbinedion|first2=E|last3=Holmes|first3=J|last4=Flowers|first4=N|last5=Thorogood|first5=M|last6=Clarke|first6=A|last7=Stranges|first7=S|last8=Hooper|first8=L|last9=Rees|first9=K|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009874.pub2|pmc=4176664}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Early life nutrition ====
One proposed explanation of the French paradox regards possible effects ([[epigenetic]] or otherwise) of dietary improvements in the first months and years of life, exerted across multiple generations. Following defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1871, the French government introduced an aggressive nutritional program providing high quality foods to pregnant women and young children with the aim of fortifying future generations of soldiers (the program was implemented about three decades prior to an analogous initiative in England in response to the [[Boer War]]). It has been suggested that the particular timing of this historical intervention  might help explain the relatively low rates of obesity and heart disease found in France.&lt;ref name=Newnham2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Newnham|first=JP|author2=Pennell, CE|author3= Lye, SJ|author4= Rampono, J|author5= Challis, JR|title=Early life origins of obesity|journal=Obstetrics and gynecology clinics of North America|date=June 2009|volume=36|issue=2|pages=227–44, xii|doi=10.1016/j.ogc.2009.03.004|pmid=19501311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4099">In [[Djibouti]], [[malnutrition]] is severe and the incidence of [[tuberculosis]] is high. [[Malaria]] is low.

==History==

The first health care facility in Djibouti was opened in 1897 by the Ethiopian Railways Company, which was later purchased by the state in 1901. It was expanded to include a facility for tuberculosis patients and included 12 new beds for the medically indigent. In 1949, the number of beds increased to 330. Additionally, a laboratory and the ability to treat patients with pulmonary diseases was added. The facility was expanded again in 1953, adding a surgical unit named after Guibert Germain and a blood transfusion unit. The hospital was renamed in 1955 after General Peltier to commemorate his service as a chief physician for 25 years. Additional operating theaters were added the same year. The facility expanded again in 1968 to include a 35 bed maternal ward and 30 beds for eye and ENT.&lt;ref name="who"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/documents/s17292e/s17292e.pdf|title=Health System Profile: Djibouti|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}}

==Health care==
In 2010 there were an estimated 23 physicians and 80 nurses per 100,000 people.&lt;ref name="worldbank" /&gt; Since healthcare in the region is so poor, more than a third of the healthcare recipients are migrants. Healthcare is best in the capital; outside the capital it is limited by poor infrastructure, equipment shortages, and a lack of qualified personnel.&lt;ref name="cia" /&gt;

==Issues==
===Geographic inequality===
A lack of infrastructure outside of cities means that rural residents have worse access to healthcare.

==Health status==


===Life, maternal, death, and birth rates===
Life expectancy has increased by 18 years since 1960.

Djibouti's birth rate is 23.6/1,000 inhabitants, while its death rate is 7.6 deaths/1,000 inhabitants. The maternal rate is 2.29 deaths/1,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref name="cia" /&gt; The death rate was 7.73 deaths per 1,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref name="worldbank" /&gt;

===HIV/AIDS===
The [[HIV/AIDS in Djibouti]] prevalence was 1.6% of the population for those aged 15–49 years old, as of 2015.&lt;ref name="worldbank" /&gt; As of 2015, there were approximately 9,400 people living with [[HIV/AIDS]] in the country.&lt;ref name="cia" /&gt; There were an estimated 600 deaths from AIDS in 2015.&lt;ref name="cia" /&gt;

===Women and children===
There were 1,007 cases of malaria in 1994. Between the mid-1970s and the mid-1990s, 23 percent of children under five were underweight. That number has risen to 29.8% in 2012.&lt;ref name="cia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/dj.html|title=Djibouti|access-date=October 15, 2016|date=October 7, 2016|website=CIA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Djibouti, 93.1% females had [[female genital mutilation]] as of 2006.&lt;ref name="worldbank" /&gt; Female genital mutilation is a leading cause of infant and maternal mortality, and it continues to be prevalent to this day, despite a 1995 law prohibiting the practice.&lt;ref name="cia" /&gt;

==Departmental mandate==
Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC) is one of the federal government departments responsible for meeting the Government of Canada's obligations and commitments to First Nations, Inuit and Métis, and for fulfilling the federal government's constitutional responsibilities in the North. INAC's responsibilities are largely determined by numerous statutes, negotiated agreements and relevant legal decisions. Most of the Department's programs, representing a majority of its spending - are delivered through partnerships with Aboriginal communities and federal-provincial or federal-territorial agreements. INAC also works with urban Indigenous people, Métis and Non-Status Indians (many of whom live in rural areas).&lt;ref name="aadnc-aandc.gc.ca"&gt;http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100010023/1100100010027&lt;/ref&gt;

Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC) supports indigenous peoples (First Nations, Inuit and Métis) and Northerners in their efforts to:
* improve social well-being and economic prosperity;
* develop healthier, more sustainable communities; and
* participate more fully in Canada's political, social and economic development to the benefit of all Canadians.&lt;ref name="aadnc-aandc.gc.ca"/&gt;

INAC also works with urban First Nations, Métis and [[Non-Status Indian]]s (many of whom live in rural areas) through the [[Federal Interlocutor for Métis and Non-Status Indians|Office of the Federal Interlocutor]].&lt;ref name="About INAC"&gt;[http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100010023/1100100010027 ''About INAC'']&lt;/ref&gt; INAC also manages the resources and lands of federal lands, including land and subsurface leases and resource royalties.

==History==
{{Indigenous Peoples of Canada}}

===Aboriginal Affairs===
{{Main article|The Canadian Crown and Aboriginal peoples}}
In 1755, the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British Crown]] established the [[Indian Department|British Indian Department]]. The Indian Governors General held control of Indian Affairs, but usually delegated much of their responsibility to a series of Civil Secretaries. In 1860, the responsibility for Indian affairs was transferred from the government of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] to the [[Province of Canada]] and the responsibility for Indian Affairs was given to the Crown Lands Department Commissions Responsible for Indian Affairs.

The federal government's legislative responsibilities for Indians and Inuit derive from section 91(24) of the [[Constitution Act, 1867]] and responsibility was given to the Secretary of State for the Provinces Responsible for Indian Affairs. In 1876, the Indian Act, which remains the major expression of federal jurisdiction in this area, was passed and a series of [[Treaty#Treaties and indigenous peoples|treaties]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://epe.lac-bac.gc.ca/100/205/301/ic/cdc/treaties/code/default.htm ''Selected Treaties from the National Archives of Canada'']&lt;/ref&gt; were concluded between Canada and the various [[First Nations government (Canada)|Indian bands]] across the country.

The responsibility for Indian Affairs and Northern Development rested with various government departments between 1873 and 1966. The [[Minister of the Interior (Canada)|Minister of the Interior]] also held the position of Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs after the Indian Affairs Department was established in 1880. In 1939, federal jurisdiction for Indian peoples was interpreted by the courts to apply to the Inuit. A revised Indian Act was passed in 1951.

From 1950 to 1965, the Indian Affairs portfolio was carried by the [[Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (Canada)|Minister of Citizenship and Immigration]]. On October 1, 1966, the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development was created as a result of the Government Organization Act, 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lac-bac.gc.ca/databases/indianaffairs/001074-200-e.html ''Departments that have been responsible for Indian Affairs''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706182158/http://www.lac-bac.gc.ca/databases/indianaffairs/001074-200-e.html |date=2011-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective June 13, 2011, the department began using the applied title Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada in addition to the legal name of the department.&lt;ref name=change/&gt;

====Northern Development====
The Northern Development part of the department has its origins in the [[Department of the Interior (Canada)|Department of the Interior]], a body created by then [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[John A. Macdonald]] for the purpose of administering the [[Dominion Lands Act]] of 1872. When the Department of the Interior dissolved in 1936 (with the [[Natural Resources Acts]] transferring control over natural resources to the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairie provinces]]), Indian Affairs fell under the purview of the [[Natural Resources Canada|Department of Mines and Resources]]. However, the need for social and health-care services in the North led to the establishment of the Northern Administration and Lands branch in 1951, which led to the creation of the Department of Northern Affairs and National Resources in 1953. This became the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development in 1966.&lt;ref name=change&gt;[http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ai/aand-eng.asp "Change to the Department's Name"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807075513/http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ai/aand-eng.asp |date=2011-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lac-bac.gc.ca/databases/indianaffairs/001074-200-e.html ''departments that have been responsible for Northern Affairs''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706182158/http://www.lac-bac.gc.ca/databases/indianaffairs/001074-200-e.html |date=2011-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Federal Identity Program]], the department is known as Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada.

====Annual Arctic expeditions====
Beginning in the early 20th century, the Canadian government sponsored annual expeditions to the [[northern Canada|Canadian North]]. These expeditions yielded extensive photographic documentation of the lives of northern indigenous peoples by participating explorers, engineers, scientists and medical staff.

Explorer, photographer, filmmaker, writer and lecturer Richard S. Finnie accompanied numerous expeditions to the North. His first voyage was aboard [[CGS Arctic|CGS ''Arctic'']], under the command of [[Joseph-Elzéar Bernier|Captain Bernier]] in 1924. During the 1930–1931 expedition to the Western Arctic, Finnie served as filmmaker. Lachlan T. Burwash, an exploratory engineer with the Department of the Interior, made a survey of the east coasts of [[Hudson Bay]] and [[James Bay]], and the [[Belcher Islands]] in the late 1920s.

[[Zoologist]] Joseph Dewey Soper travelled to the [[Baffin Island]] (Qikiqtaaluk) region in the late 1920s in order to document the landscape, as well as the plant and bird life. [[J.G. Wright]], Superintendent of Eastern Arctic Patrol and [[National Film Board of Canada|National Film Board]] photographer, served on the 1945–1946 expedition sponsored by the [[CNIB|Canadian National Institute for the Blind]]. As the Regional Director of [[Child benefit|Family Allowances]] for [[Yukon]] and the [[Northwest Territories]], S.J. Bailey served as part of the Eastern Arctic Patrol beginning in the late 1940s.

==Organization==
Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada has offices in ten (10) regions, at headquarters and to deal with oil and gas leases. The offices are further divided into the broad divisions of treaties and aboriginal government; lands and economic development and education and social development. Northern Development is represented in only the Northwest Territories (NWT) and Nunavut (NU) regional offices and headquarters.

=="The Nunavut Project"==
The [[Nunavut Land Claims Agreement]] was implemented in 1993 between the Inuit of the Nunavut Settlement Area and the Government of Canada subject to the [[Constitution Act, 1982|Constitution Act of 1982]]. The territory of Nunavut was formed in 1999. INAC has major responsibilities for managing the lands and resources of Nunavut.

With respect to the Inuit of [[Nunavut]], the department and its Minister have the challenge of implementing the Conciliator’s Final Report, dated March 1, 2006 on the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Implementation Contract Negotiations for the Second Planning Period 2003-2013 "The Nunavut Project" authored by [[Thomas R. Berger|Thomas Berger]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cba.org/nunavut/pdf/NU_finalreport.pdf ''The Nunavut Project''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205163724/http://www.cba.org/nunavut/pdf/NU_finalreport.pdf |date=2008-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This report recommends an increase in Inuit participation in Nunavut's federal and territorial public service.

==Community infrastructure==

By January 2012 there were two government audits that revealed that the federal government had earmarked about a billion dollars annually on constructing and/or maintaining First Nations infrastructure in First Nations communities.&lt;ref name=scoffield2012&gt;{{cite web

"Findings from the "AFN First Nations Regional Longitudinal Health Survey 2002/2003 study (March 2007) are notable: More than 1/5 of adult respondents report that they have no access to garbage collection services; Nine percent of homes do not have either sewage service or a septic tank; and Only 2/3 of respondents considered their water safe to drink: Over 60 percent of respondents obtain their drinking water from bottled water. To cite a 2003 INAC study, 39 percent of water systems exceeded one or more of the risk indicator thresholds occasionally or continuously. Among key informants, there was unanimous consensus that there is a clear infrastructure deficit on reserve and in the different categories, according to the community; investment needed in housing, school, water facilities, and roads were usually mentioned as examples."&lt;ref name=evaluationFNIF2010&gt;{{cite report |publisher=Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada |title=Implementation Evaluation of the First Nation Infrastructure Fund |date= February 2010 |url=http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1324657420031/1324657571041 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Community Infrastructure $1.028 billion

===First Nations Infrastructure Fund (FNIF)===
FNIF $234 million (lifespan)

The First Nations Infrastructure Fund (FNIF) was introduced in 2007 to improve the quality of life and the environment for First Nation communities. It is a targeted fund that accepted proposals for community projects under the following headings: 1) Planning and Skills Development, 2) Solid Waste Management, 3) Roads and Bridges 4) Energy Systems 5) Connectivity. The amount available to each community through the First Nations Infrastructure Fund (FNIF) was limited to a total of $10 million over a five-year period. By March 2008, a total of 262 proposals (out of the 714 submitted) were approved for FNIF funding. Nationally, $94.3 million of FNIF funding was dispersed.&lt;ref name="scoffield2012"/&gt;

==Infrastructure crisis in First Nations communities==

===Crisis in water supply, distribution systems and wastewater systems===

In 2005, the Office of the Auditor General of Canada "reported the lack of a legislative regime to ensure that water quality on reserves met the Guidelines for Canadian Drinking Water Quality, despite the existence of such a regime in every province and territory (OAG 2011 page 11)."&lt;ref name=reportOAG2011&gt;{{cite report |title=2011 June Status Report of the Auditor General of Canada |url=http://www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/docs/parl_oag_201106_04_e.pdf |format=PDF |chapter=Chapter 4: Programs for First Nations on Reserves |accessdate=January 12, 2013 |author=Office of the Auditor General of Canada }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The auditor general's report (2011-06) noted that INAC and Health Canada "do not ensure that drinking water is tested on a regular basis."&lt;ref name=reportOAG2011 /&gt;

====National assessment of water and wastewater systems in First Nation communities====

In 1991, less than 80% of on-reserve housing had basic water and sewer services. (NAWWSFNS 2003:26)

By 2001, about 98% of on-reserve houses had water and 94% had sewer services. (NAWWSFNS 2003:26)

The report dated May 2003 revealed that "of the 740 community water systems assessed, about 29% posed a potentially high risk that could negatively impact water quality (p. i. ) Only 25% were in the low or no risk category. Of the 462 community waterwater systems assessed, 16% (74) were classified at a potential high risk that could negatively impact wastewater effluent quality. (p. ii.) Circuit Rider Training Program began in 2000. "The capital cost to address deficiencies to water and wastewater systems was estimated between $475 million and $560 million in 2003. The capital investment to provide basic water and wastewater services to about 5,300 homes which did not have basic water and wastewater services would have cost $185 million in 2003. Support for normal recapitalization and expansion for growth was estimated at $90 million to $100 million annually. p.iii)&lt;ref name=water2003&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/DAM/DAM-INTER-HQ/STAGING/texte-text/watw_1100100016374_eng.pdf |format=PDF |title=National Assessment of Water and Wastewater Systems in First Nation Communities |date=May 2003 |publisher=Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada |pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The National Assessment released in April 2011 was the result of "the most rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of water and wastewater systems on reserve ever under taken.  Between July 2009 and spring 2011, independent engineers inspected 4000 on-reserve systems including 1,300 water and wastewater systems and more than 800 wells and 1,900 septic fields serving 571 First Nation communities."&lt;ref name=AANDC2011&gt;{{cite web

The National Assessment of Water and Wastewater Systems in First Nation Communities (2011) "found that 39 per cent of First Nations water systems were at high risk of being unsafe, affecting 25 per cent of people living on reserves. It said Ottawa would need $1.2 billion in repairs, better infrastructure and training to fix the problem, as well as an additional $4.7 billion over 10 years to keep pace with growing demand."&lt;ref name=scoffield2012 /&gt;

39% of the 807 water systems inspected were classified as high overall risk affecting 25 per cent of the on-reserve population base. The study found that "314 water systems were high risk, 161 water systems in 116 First Nation communities were under Health Canada Drinking-Water Advisories (DWA) as of February 2011. These DWAs may be impacting up to 18,900 people, which is approximately 3.9 percent of the total on-reserve population cited as 484,321 in the National Roll-up."&lt;ref name=AANDC201107&gt;{{cite web

The National Assessment of Water and Wastewater Systems in First Nation Communities 'suggests many communities remain vulnerable to the health and environmental problems that result from poor water quality and inadequate sanitation. The assessment, which was released in April 2011, looked at the water and sewer systems of 571 First Nations (with a total population of 484,321 and 112,836 "dwellings") and evaluated their water source and how well each system was designed, operated and monitored. It categorized 39 per cent of the water systems as "high risk," meaning they have "major deficiencies" that pose a high risk to water quality and could lead to potential health and safety or environmental concerns. Thirty-four per cent were assessed as posing medium risk to the quality of water and health and having deficiencies that "should be corrected to avoid future problems."

'''Intradialytic parenteral nutrition''' ('''IDPN''') is a nutritional support therapy ([[medical nutrition therapy]]) for people on [[hemodialysis]] who have a difficult time maintaining adequate nutrition. It is administered directly into the bloodstream of patients suffering from [[chronic kidney disease]] (CKD) in an effort to decrease the associated morbidity and mortality experienced in patients with [[renal failure]]. IDPN contains protein ([[amino acid]]s), [[carbohydrate]]s ([[dextrose]]), and [[fat]]s ([[lipids]]) in an attempt to meet a patient's weekly nutritional needs. Solutions can be individualized for each patient based on weight, needs, medical history and enteral intake.

==History==
Prior to 1990, traditional therapies for [[dialysis]] patients such as liberalized diet and oral supplements, led to protein malnutrition and/or calorie malnutrition.

Efforts to supplement nutritional intake by providing nutrients during the dialysis procedure were attempted. As a result, IDPN became an established therapy to replete malnourished CKD-5 dialysis patients in the early 1990s. Generally the patients received a set formulation containing standard amounts of dextrose, amino acids and lipids regardless of the patient's weight, dialysis time and complicating co-morbid conditions.

==New approach to IDPN therapy==
To address specific nutritional needs of individual patients, several providers of IDPN therapy developed formulations that take clinical variables into account in order to best fit the patient’s individual needs and condition. Specific formulations address distinct differences between nutritional needs of those patients who exhibit protein malnutrition and those patients who exhibit calorie malnutrition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6917">'''John Naysmith (or Naismyth or Nasmyth)''' (1556-16 September 1613) was a Scottish surgeon  who became  surgeon to King James VI of Scotland and was appointed  Royal Herbalist in London when the monarch became King James VI and I. He was Deacon (President) of the Incorporation of Surgeons and Barbers of Edinburgh.

== Early life and education ==
John Naysmith was the younger son of Sir Michael Naysmyth (or Nasmyth) of Posso (1516-1607), Chamberlain to [[John Hamilton (archbishop of St Andrews)|John Hamilton, the archbishop of St Andrews]].&lt;ref name=Comrie&gt;Comrie, J.D.  ''History of Scottish Medicine to 1860''. London, Wellcome Historical Medical Museum, 2nd ed, 1932 p 174 https://archive.org/details/b2045711x&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was Elizabeth,(1503-1606) daughter of John Baird of Posso (1483-1526), owner of the estate of that name in Peebles-shire.&lt;ref name=Comrie /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Naesmyth https://www.ancestry.co.uk/genealogy/records/michael-naesmyth_19269434&lt;/ref&gt; His elder brother James Naysmith inherited the Posso estate and became falconer to King James VI. John Naysmyth's early education was at [[St Mary's College, St Andrews]] after which he was apprenticed to the surgeon [[Gilbert Primrose (surgeon)|Gilbert Primrose]] in Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, William. ''The Scottish nation; or. The surnames, families, literature, honours, and biographical history of the people of Scotland''. Edinburgh, Fullarton and Co, 1867 https://archive.org/details/scottishnationo05andegoog&lt;/ref&gt; He was admitted to the Incorporation of Surgeons and Barbers of Edinburgh in 1588.&lt;ref name=Gairdner&gt;Gairdner, John. ''Historical sketch of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh''. Edinburgh, Sutherland and Knox, 1860. https://archive.org/details/b2145209x&lt;/ref&gt;

He married Helen Macmath in Edinburgh on 26 March 1600.&lt;ref&gt;OPR register indexes  NASMYTH, JOHNNE; HELENE MCMATHE/FR652 (FR652); 131; 26/03/1600; 685/1; 430 30; Edinburgh from https://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
He was elected [[List of Presidents of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh|Deacon (President)]] of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh|Incorporation of Surgeons and Barbers of Edinburgh]] in 1595.&lt;ref name=Dingwall /&gt;

Gilbert Primrose, his surgical master had been surgeon to [[King James VI]] and became [[Serjeant-Surgeon]] to King James VI and I when the King and his court moved to London. Presumably as a result of Primrose’s patronage Naysmith was made a surgeon to King James VI, and he too moved with the Court to London on the occasion of the Union of the Crowns. King James VI, now King James I made him Royal Herbalist for life. During his time in London he attended Prince Henry during his fatal illness.&lt;ref name=Dingwall&gt;Dingwall, Helen. ''A famous and flourishing Society ; The History of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, 1505-2005''. Edinburgh, Edinburgh University press, 2005. p15 {{ISBN|978-0748615674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political activity ==
Like his father he was an active supporter of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. It is thought that he was a member of Lord Seton's party, a small select group who were entrusted to journey to England in 1675, ostensibly to pay homage to Queen Elizabeth, but in reality to smuggle letters to the imprisoned [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary Queen of Scots]] from the then Scottish Regent, [[James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton]].&lt;ref name=Comrie /&gt; This was achieved successfully, and,  as a result of his part in this exploit he found favour with the teenage King James VI.  Yet in an era of plotting and conspiracy and vaccillating political loyalty he had been suspected of involvement in the 1591 plot against the King by [[Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell|Francis Stewart 5th Earl of Bothwell]]. He was imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle then Dumbarton Castle before being ordered by the privy council to go abroad under caution of 1000 merks (£666 Scots). The caution was subsequently deleted by warrant of the King on 1 August 1593.&lt;ref&gt;Dingwall, HM.  ‘Nasmyth ,  John  (1556/7–1613)’, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press,  2004 &lt;nowiki&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/19796, accessed 10 May 2017]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He fled to France where he became Chief Surgeon to the Scots Guards of the King of France.&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;Forbes-Leith, William. ''The Scots Men at Arms in France.'' Vol 2; Edinburgh,W. Patterson, 1882.p187&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to Scotland in 1599, he appears to have been forgiven for his earlier infidelity, and was accepted back into the Royal Court. He was among the retainers  with the King at Falkland Palace  on the occasion of the [[Gowrie Conspiracy]] in 1600.&lt;ref name=Dingwall /&gt;&lt;ref name=Comrie /&gt; Gilbert Primrose, his surgical master, had by now been made Serjeant-Surgeon (or Chief Surgeon) to King James VI. Naysmith became a surgeon to King James VI and, on the [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603, he travelled with the Court to London. King James, now King James I of England, made him Royal Herbalist for life.&lt;ref name=Dingwall /&gt;

== Death and burial ==
Naysmith died in London and  was buried in Greyfriars churchyard in Edinburgh where an elaborate monument marks his grave.&lt;ref name=Comrie /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, James ''Epitaphs in Greyfriars Churchyard''.Edinburgh, J. Moodie Miller, 1867. p10.https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=15EZAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;pg=GBS.PP1&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription in Latin is now almost obliterated but has been translated as follows; &lt;blockquote&gt;Here lies John Nasmyth, of the family of Posso, an honourable family of Tweedale, a citizen of Edinburgh, chief surgeon to his most Serene Majesty and to the King of France's troop of guards from Scotland - having excellently performedall the duties of a godly life; who dying at London to the grief of both nations, in the exercise of office with his Majesty, ordered his body to be conveyed hither (such was his love to his country), to be buried in this dormitory; acquiting himself to his King, his country and his friends by the utmost of his power and duty. He died in the 57th year of his age, the 10th of September 1613. Why is it grievous to return whence you came?&lt;ref name=Forbes /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;His testament was proved in the Edinburgh Commissary Court on 19 January 1614&lt;ref&gt;Nasmythe, Johne; 19/1/1614; chirurgeon to our Sovereign Lord, burgess of Edinburgh; Testament Testamentar and Inventory; Edinburgh Commissary Court; CC8/8/48 from https://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HollyMonument.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Monument at the crash site of the airplane carrying [[Buddy Holly]], [[The Big Bopper]], and [[Ritchie Valens]]; "[[The Day the Music Died]]".]]
&lt;!-- Only add names here if the person has their own Wiki article -- anything else will be removed --&gt;

The following is a list of notable performers of [[rock and roll]] music or [[rock music]], and others directly associated with the music as producers, songwriters or in other closely related roles, who have died. The list gives their date, cause and location of death, and their age.

Rock music developed from the rock and roll music that emerged during the 1950s, and includes a diverse range of subgenres. The terms "rock and roll" and "rock" each have a variety of definitions, some narrow and some wider. In determining criteria for inclusion, this list uses as its basis reliable sources listing "rock deaths" or "deaths in rock and roll", as well as such sources as the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

The '''Liujiaxia Reservoir''' ({{zh|s=刘家峡水库 |t=劉家峽水庫 |p=Liújiāxiá Shuǐkù}}) is a reservoir in China's [[Gansu]] Province, formed by the [[Liujiaxia Dam]] on the [[Yellow River]]. It occupies over {{Convert|130|km2|mi2|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=lvyou&gt;"临夏旅游" (Linxia Tourism), published by Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture Tourist Board, 2003. 146 pages. No ISBN. Pages 26=27.&lt;/ref&gt; and is located entirely within [[Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture]]. The reservoir's shores belong to the prefecture's [[Yongjing County]] (the narrow northern part, and the north shore of the wide southern part), [[Dongxiang Autonomous County]] (eastern part of the south shore), [[Linxia County]] (western part of the south shore), and [[Jishishan Bonan, Dongxiang and Salar Autonomous County]] (the small westernmost section of the south shore).

The [[Daxia River]] and the [[Tao River]] flow into the reservoirs, forming wide bays.

The water level in Liujiaxia Reservoir is usually reported as {{convert|1735|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above the sea level,&lt;ref name=iaeg&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1986|isbn=90-6191-662-3|volume=2|title= Proceedings, Fifth International Congress, International Association of Engineering Geology, International Association of Engineering Geology|author=International Association of Engineering Geology|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JSLSnc5a_osC|pages=1225–1228}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linxiaxian.gov.cn/typenews.asp?id=289 临夏县地理环境] (Linxia County geography and environment), at the county government site&lt;/ref&gt; but in practice it varies significantly, in accordance with the water flow and human needs.

The initial capacity of the reservoir was {{convert|5.7|km3|mi3|1|abbr=on}}, but after 10 years it lost 10% of its capacity due to [[silting]], and after 17 years, 17.4%. This silting rate is considered quite low, compared to other reservoirs on the Yellow River, such as the narrow Yanguoxia Reservoir just downstream, which lost 71.3% of its storage capacity between 1958 and 1964 (and 77%, by 1965), or [[Sanmenxia Reservoir]], which lost 96% of its storage capacity to sedimentation in just 4 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Dan G.|last=Batuca|first2= Jan M.|last2=Jordaan|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2000|isbn=90-5410-477-5|title=Silting and desilting of reservoirs|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4YoKrkuhXEQC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:6022-Vehicle-ferry-crossing-Liujiaxia-Reservoir.jpg|thumb|left|A ferry on the Liujiaxia Reservoir]]
The reservoir usually does not freeze over in winter, but during the [[2008 Chinese winter storms|unusually cold weather in early 2008]] over half of its surface froze, which necessitated taking measures to protect the turbines of the hydroelectric plant from floating ice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://french.peopledaily.com.cn/Economie/6362546.html La centrale hydroélectrique de Liujiaxia prend activement des mesures pour assurer la production électrique en cas de gel], People's Daily, 28.02.2008. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of watercraft operate on the reservoir. Vehicle ferries run frequently across the reservoir between docks in Linxia County (Lianhua Tai) and Yongjing County, providing a shorter and more pleasant route for travel between [[Linxia City]] and [[Yongjing County|Liujiaxia Town]] than [[China National Highway 213]] does. Recreational vessels and shuttle boats to  [[Bingling Temple]] operate from a number of docks, in particular the one in [[Yongjing County|Liujiaxia Town]] near the dam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.cri.cn/725/2005/12/05/202@34480.htm Bingling Temple Grottoes] CRIENGLISH.com, 2005-12-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually done through an internet [[webcast]] (such streaming platforms include [[Afreeca]], [[YouTube|Youtube]], [[Twitch.tv|Twitch]] and etc), mukbang became popular in [[South Korea]] in the 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cha|first=Frances|date=2 February 2014|title=South Korea's online trend: Paying to watch a pretty girl eat|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/29/world/asia/korea-eating-room/|publisher=[[CNN]]|access-date=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hu|first=Elise|date=24 March 2015|title=Koreans Have An Insatiable Appetite For Watching Strangers Binge Eat|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2015/03/24/392430233/koreans-have-an-insatiable-appetite-for-watching-strangers-binge-eat|publisher=[[NPR]]|access-date=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news |last=Evans|first=Stephen|date=5 February 2014|title=The Koreans who televise themselves eating dinner|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-31130947|publisher=[[BBC]]|access-date=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foods ranging from pizza to noodles are consumed in front of a camera for an internet audience (who pay or not, depending on which platform one is watching).

In each broadcast, a host will often interact with their viewers through [[online chat]]rooms. With the rising popularity of these eating shows, hosts have found lucrative ways of benefiting from the online show. Many hosts generate revenue through mukbang, by accepting donations or partnering with advertising networks.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;

The word mukbang is a [[portmanteau]] of the Korean words for "eating" ({{ko-hhrm|hangul=[[wikt:먹다|먹는]]|rr=meokneun|labels=no}}) and "broadcast" ({{ko-hhrm|hangul=[[wikt:방송|방송]]|rr=bangsong|labels=no}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ko:우리는 왜 '먹방'과의 사랑에 빠진 걸까?|trans-title=I Wonder Why we Fell in Love with "Muk-Bang"?|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20130426000792|accessdate=30 October 2015|work=[[The Korea Herald]]|date=26 April 2013|language=Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Meok-Bang Trend In South Korea Turns Binge Eating Into Spectator Sport|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/12/18/meok-bang-trend_n_4467240.html|accessdate=30 October 2015|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-31130947|title=The Koreans who televise themselves eating dinner|last=Evans|first=Stephen|date=2015-02-05|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The mukbang Internet culture began on [[AfreecaTV]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=우리나라 최초의 '먹방'을 아세요?|url=http://www.hankookilbo.com/v/46f6ed0fa3e14bd8920443a542920e4d|website=한국일보|accessdate=26 April 2017|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon of mukbang became more global interest after American entertainment duo "The Fine Brothers" created a video which shows the reaction of Western people to mukbang eating contests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/05/04/mukbang-how-koreans-become-stars-through-their-love-of-food.html|title=Koreans become stars by live-streaming dinner|last=Gibbs|first=Alexandra|date=2015-05-05|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reasons for popularity ==

There are several explanations given by various scholars. [[Jeff Yang]], an Asian-American cultural critic and senior vice president of the global research firm Kantar Futures, said that mukbang had its origins in "the loneliness of unmarried or uncoupled [South] Koreans, in addition to the inherently social aspect of eating in [South] Korea" during the interview with Quartz.&lt;ref&gt;Why some Koreans make $10,000 a month to eat on camera,http://qz.com/592710/why-some-koreans-make-10000-a-month-to-eat-on-camera/&lt;/ref&gt;

Kim-Hae Jin, Ph.D candidate from [[Chosun University]], argued that one can vicariously satisfy the desire for the food. The hosts, who call themselves BJs (Broadcast Jockeys), interact with the people who are watching the broadcast through chatting. BJs sometimes claim to be the audience's "avatar" and will exactly follow what people ask them to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim (김)|first=Hye Jin (혜진)|date=2015|title=문화학 : 하위문화로서의 푸드 포르노(Food Porn) 연구 - 아프리카TV의 인터넷 먹방을 중심으로 -|trans-title=A Study on Food Porn as a Sub-Culture - Centering on Internet "Meokbang" (eating scene) in Afreeca TV -|url=http://kiss.kstudy.com/thesis/thesis-view.asp?key=3370153|journal=인문학연구|language=ko-KR|volume=50|issue=0|pages=433–455|issn=1598-9259|via=RISS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adema contends in her article: "food television incorporates the vicarious pleasures of watching someone else cook and eat; the emulsion of entertainment and cooking; the jumbling of traditional gender roles; and ambivalence toward cultural standards of body, consumption, and health. ... simultaneously perpetuates the stress of social expectations. "&lt;ref&gt;Adema, Pauline. "Vicarious consumption: Food, television and the ambiguity of modernity." The Journal of American Culture 23.3 (2000): 113. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Varieties==
Other genres of mukbang include "cook-bang" (cooking and eating) shows. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ikunkang.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=22294|title=TV를 삼킨 먹방 &amp; 쿡방 열풍이 불편한 이유}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Korean video game players have sometimes broadcast mukbang as breaks during their overall streams. The popularity of this practice among local users led the video game streaming service [[Twitch.tv]] to begin trialling a dedicated "Social eating" category in July 2016; a representative of the service stated that this category is not necessarily specific to mukbang, but would leave the concept open to interpretation by streamers within its guidelines.&lt;ref name="polygon-eating"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/7/11/12149446/twitch-social-eating-interview|title=Why eating and gaming is a thing on Twitch|website=Polygon|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== On Media Platforms ==

The popularity of mukbang has inspired different variations and adaptions of the "Eating Broadcasting" concept. This trend has continued to gain viewers, create stars, and profit, catching the interest of mainstream media both domestically and internationally. 
In South Korea, there was a drama called ''[[Let's Eat (TV series)|Let's Eat]]'' (Hangul: 식샤를 합시다; RR: Siksareul Habsida) that focused on people who were brought together due to their love of food. In the drama, the characters explore various restaurants and after each episode, the featured foods became a hot topic among young adult viewers. Viewers sought out these restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kdramastars.com/articles/15816/20140214/let-s-eat-drama-creates-appetizing-dining-trend-among-singles.htm|title=“Let’s Eat” Drama Creates Appetizing Dining Trend Among Singles|first=|last=kdramastars.com|date=14 February 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadcasting stations are looking to capitalize on this interest in other ways as well. Happy Together, a popular entertainment show in South Korea, has a segment where their celebrity guests will cook and then share their favorite dishes with the rest of the cast.&lt;ref&gt;http://ttonl.org/mukbang-presents-diversion-from-traditional-online-entertainment-2/&lt;/ref&gt; JTBC, a South Korean general cable TV network is also looking to jump on the bandwagon with a new variety show in the works. They are planning on a food-centric variety show called ''[[We Will Eat Well|Girls Who Eat Well]]'' and are looking to cast girl group members from popular South Korean K-pop girl groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.soompi.com/2016/05/01/jtbc-announces-a-new-mukbang-show-featuring-girl-group-members/|title=JTBC Announces A New Mukbang Show Featuring Girl Group Members|first=K.|last=Zertuche|date=1 May 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular South Korean variety series ''[[Infinite Challenge]]'' has also showcased the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kdramastars.com/articles/104321/20151110/infinite-challenge-jung-joon-ha-and-haha-develop-a-muk-bang-tour.htm|title=‘Infinite Challenge’ Jung Joon Ha and Haha Develop A Muk-bang Tour|first=|last=kdramastars.com|date=10 November 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream media is not the only platform to showcase mukbang. For example, celebrities have done mukbang broadcasts as a CF to promote a food brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allkpop.com/article/2015/06/karas-youngji-has-the-cutest-mukbang-show-for-popeyes|title=KARA's Youngji has the cutest 'mukbang' show for 'Popeyes' - allkpop.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mukbang has also gained international interest as well. The popular YouTube series, Youtubers React, showed various YouTube stars reacting to the South Korean trend and ended with their own mini mukbang show.{{Cn|date=February 2018}}

{{nihongo|'''Nero'''|ネロ|lead=yes}} is a [[fictional character]] and one of the main [[protagonists]] of the ''[[Devil May Cry]]'' [[video game]] series, which was created and published by [[Capcom]]. He first appeared in ''[[Devil May Cry 4]]'' in 2008. Nero is a teenager working for the Order of the Sword; he uses his devil powers inherited from [[Characters of Devil May Cry#Sparda|Sparda]] to hunt enemies. In ''Devil May Cry 4'', Nero meets a demon hunter named [[Dante (Devil May Cry)|Dante]], the series' primary protagonist, to whom he learns he is related. Nero will return as one of the primary protagonists in the upcoming sequel, ''[[Devil May Cry 5]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/devil-may-cry-5s-coming-in-spring-2019-and-it-stars-nero-dante-and-a-wise-talking-mechanic/|title=Devil May Cry 5's coming in spring 2019 and it stars Nero, Dante, and a wise-talking mechanic|publisher=GamesRadar+|author=Connor Sheridan|date=10 June 2018|accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nero was created by [[Bingo Morihashi]] and designed by Tatsuya Yoshikawa, who wanted to make the character fit into the world while contrasting him with Dante. The character was redesigned for ''Devil May Cry 5'' to establish his relationship with Dante's father Sparda and Dante's brother [[Vergil (Devil May Cry)|Vergil]] based on their multiple physical similarities. Nero is voiced by [[Johnny Yong Bosch]] in English and [[Kaito Ishikawa]] in Japanese.

Critical reception to Nero has been mostly positive. While game journalists found that fans would miss playing as Dante during Nero's debut, his personality and abilities would be found as appealing. His new look and actions in the upcoming ''Devil May Cry 5'' have also been praised by critics.

==Creation and concept==

Nero was created by the Capcom staff as a new protagonist who would develop across the ''Devil May Cry'' series because Dante had become stronger with each game. Nero was created as a weak character who develops new powers in the story until he reaches Dante's level. This was mostly done through his "Devil Bringer" ability, which makes him stand out. Another reason for Nero's introduction was to attract new gamers to the franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/devil-may-cry-4-interview-the-men-behind-the-mayhem/4/|title=Devil May Cry 4 interview - the men behind the mayhem|publisher=GamesRadar|accessdate=June 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Devil Bringer was originally suited to be part of Dante's mechanics, but the staff found the games would be more interesting if a character who cannot transform into a demon would develop a demon arm. In the making of the game, Capcom wished to keep Nero's traits, except that Kyrie is his love interest,  under wraps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2007/10/interview-hiroy/|title=INTERVIEW: HIROYUKI KOBAYASHI TALKS DEVIL MAY CRY 4 STORYLINE|publisher=Wired|accessdate=June 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bingo Morihashi was inspired to write Nero's story by the writings of  late manga artist [[Ramo Nakajima]] in the series ''[[Amagasaki City]]''; "I love you, so I protect the city you love". Love is the focus of the ''Devil May Cry'' series; ''Devil May Cry 4'' focuses on Nero's love for Kyrie. While making ''Devil May Cry 4'' a simple story similar to Hollywood movies involving a [[damsel in distress]], the staff were satisfied with the story because it also carried Morihashi's ideas well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Devil May Cry: 3142 Graphic Arts|publisher=Capcom, Udon Entertainment|year=2015|isbn=978-1927925485|pages=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fearing negative feedback, as happened when [[Konami]]'s stealth game ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' introduced a new character, replacing protagonist [[Solid Snake]] with newcomer [[Raiden (Metal Gear)|Raiden]], producer [[Hiroyuki Kobayashi (producer)|Hiroyuki Kobayashi]] stated Capcom aimed to make Nero fun to play, even when compared to Dante; they said the team aimed to make him stronger at some point.&lt;ref name="comparison"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/devil-may-cry-4-interview-the-men-behind-the-mayhem/5/|title=Devil May Cry 4 interview - the men behind the mayhem|publisher=GamesRadar|accessdate=June 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kobayashi described Nero as "characteristically wild, quite immature, young, and very passionate. At the same time he is kind of a rebel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/devil-may-cry-4-interview|title=Devil May Cry 4|publisher=Eurogamer|accessdate=June 22, 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.li/czhbD|archivedate=February 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capcom originally planned to name their new character after the French sculptor [[Auguste Rodin]], who created  ''[[The Gates of Hell]]'' from ''[[Dante's Inferno]]''. This work is referenced in ''Devil May Cry 4''; it causes demons to spawn within the human world. The Capcom team, however, later wanted a simpler name similar to the ones from Dante and Vergil. Writer Morihashi Bingo persuaded the staff to use the name Nero from the [[Nero|Roman emperor with the same name]]; he said the similarities between Nero and the name of Vergil's alter-ego [[Nero Angelo]] were coincidental and there is no connection between these two characters. Most of Nero's moves were named after casino terms, which Morihashi believed would fit with the character's personality.&lt;ref name="novel2"/&gt;

===Design===
Nero was designed by Tatsuya Yoshikawa who did research for the entire ''Devil May Cry'' series when designing the new main character. Yoshikawa was satisfied with Nero's appearance and he believes he fits the ''Devil May Cry'' world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/previews/devil-cry-4_2?pager.offset=3|title=Devil May Cry 4|publisher=1UP.com|accessdate=22 June 2018|archivedate=October 24, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103190454/http://www.1up.com/previews/devil-cry-4_2?pager.offset=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nero's physical appearance underwent several changes during the development of ''Devil May Cry 4''; early designs looked more like Vergil until the final design that resembled Dante.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ricedigital.co.uk/devil-may-cry-3124-artbook-review/|title=Devil May Cry 3124 Artbook Review (Book)|publisher=Rice Digital|accessdate=June 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capcom wanted to balance the traits between Nero and Dante, the game's two playable characters. While Nero was created to be weak due to his young age, Dante comes across as a more experienced person based on his previous works. Existing fans would be pleased by Dante's characterization and would stop playing as Nero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/previews/devil-cry-4_2?pager.offset=1|title=Devil May Cry 4|publisher=1UP.com|accessdate=22 June 2018|archivedate=October 31, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103190600/http://www.1up.com/previews/devil-cry-4_2?pager.offset=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capcom had planned ideas for another ''Devil May Cry'' game, in which Nero would return and possibly team up with Dante. The company, however, first expected to see the fan response to ''Devil May Cry 4''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/previews/devil-cry-4_2?pager.offset=2|title=Devil May Cry 4|publisher=1UP.com|accessdate=22 June 2018|archivedate=October 31, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103190116/http://www.1up.com/previews/devil-cry-4_2?pager.offset=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yoshikawa also created another devil transformation, the Devil Trigger, for Nero. Unlike Dante's transformation that makes him look like a devil, Nero's Devil Trigger generates a creature situated behind his back. The one that did not appear in the game turned Nero into a demon like Dante. Nero's hood covers one eye as a form of symbolism, which was left up to the fans. Yoshikawa wanted to incorporate this into the game and hoped to make it into a figurine, but this was not possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Devil May Cry 4 Devil's Material Collection Art Book|publisher=Capcom|isbn=978-4862331854|year=2008|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nero's redesign for ''Devil May Cry 5'' was intended to contrast with Dante's older look.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gearnuke.com/devil-may-cry-5-interview-neros-lineage-design/|title=Devil May Cry 5 Director confirms Nero’s lineage and reason for new design|publisher=Gearnuke|author=Danial Arshad Khan|date=16 June 2018|accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capcom used an older incarnation of Nero so he would be "at the top of his game in body and mind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.siliconera.com/2018/07/18/devil-may-cry-5-devs-on-balancing-photorealism-with-action-the-mystery-3rd-hero-more |title= Devil May Cry 5 Devs On Balancing Photorealism With Action, The Mystery 3rd Hero, More |publisher= Siliconera |date= July 18, 2018 |accessdate= July 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the graphics of the game are meant to be as realistic as possible, Nero's face was modeled after an actor named Karlo Baker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/682955/Devil-May-Cry-5-Nero-Dante-DMC-News-2019-Release-Date-pegi-Devil-Trigger-Updates-August-13|title=Devil May Cry 5: Nero, Dante, new characters, 18+ rating and 2019 release date news reveal|publisher=Daily Star|accessdate=August 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fans of the series speculated whether Nero was related to Dante or Vergil, as in ''Devil May Cry 4''. Nero is said to be a descendant of Sparda, Dante's and Vergil's father, based on their similarities and Nero's power up, the Devil Trigger, which makes him look like Vergil's devil form. In June 2018, Capcom confirmed Nero is Vergil's son.&lt;ref name="Jane Flowers"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://us.blastingnews.com/gaming/2018/06/devil-may-cry-5-director-confirms-that-vergil-is-neros-father-possible-release-date-002630961.html |title='Devil May Cry 5' director confirms that Vergil is Nero's father; possible release date |publisher= Blasting News |author=Jane Flowers |date=19 June 2018 |accessdate= 20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Replacing his lost Devil Bringer, Capcom added Nero's prosthetic arm Devil Breaker, which will be important for the use of the character in combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.reddit.com/r/DevilMayCry/comments/8rjw7k/full_translation_of_famitsu_interview |title= Full translation of Famitsu interview |publisher= Reddit.com |accessdate= 22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Players who purchase the Deluxe Edition of ''Devil May Cry'' will receive four Devil Breaker weapons for Nero, including a Mega Buster based on ''[[Mega Man 11]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2018/09/19/devil-may-cry-5-shows-off-trish-lady-v-and-neros-mega-buster/|title=Devil May Cry 5 Shows Off Trish, Lady, V, And Nero’s Mega Buster|publisher=Siliconera|accessdate=September 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voice actors===
[[File:Johnny Yong Bosch.jpg|thumb|221x221px|[[Johnny Yong Bosch]] voices Nero.]]

Nero was voiced by [[Johnny Yong Bosch]]; while having played many characters—he enjoyed playing [[Ichigo Kurosaki]] from ''[[Bleach (manga)|Bleach]]'' and [[Vash the Stampede]] from ''[[Trigun]]''—Bosch felt Nero became his favorite. The actor stated that Nero was one of his favorite characters he has ever worked because of his story and because he went to Japan to do the [[motion capture]] for Nero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.halfkorean.com/?page_id=379 |title= Interview with Johnny Yong Bosch |publisher= HalfKorean.com |accessdate= June 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Japanese version of ''Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition'', an updated version of the original ''Devil May Cry 4'', Nero was given a Japanese actor; [[Kaito Ishikawa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Kaito-Ishikawa/|title=Kaito Ishikawa|publisher=Behind the Voice Actors|accessdate=June 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When dubbing the character, Ishikawa tried following Bosch's work so he could understand Nero's personality but he found this difficult because he did not know English. While Ishikawa had no previous experience with the series before working in ''Special Edition'', his friends gave him a positive outlook at it. During the recording of the series, Ishikawa met Dante's Japanese voice actor, [[Toshiyuki Morikawa]], with whom he interacted many times and helped him to understand the franchise. As he worked, Ishikawa gained a greater understanding of the game because it was translated in Japanese, which might attract more fans and was grateful for the experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://animeanime.jp/article/2015/06/29/23905.html|title=「デビル メイ クライ 4 スペシャルエディション」森川智之、石川界人インタビュー 遂に登場した日本語ボイス|publisher=Anime Anime|accessdate=June 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ishikawa said Nero is a character who encompasses the "naughty young boy" that everyone has experienced being. He noted Nero's interactions with the enemies show a big contrast between his and Dante's characterization. Of the two main characters, Ishikawa said he believed Nero is taking his own path rather than following Dante's steps; he enjoyed the relationship between the two characters, which he took into account when recording the game. He decided to "cheer" on Nero for trying to act stylishly when facing his enemies, unlike Dante, whom he took notes from seeing Morikawa's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.famitsu.com/news/201507/03082422.html|title=『デビル メイ クライ 4 SE』森川智之さんと石川界人さんがダンテとネロを語る！|publisher=Famitsu|accessdate=June 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==
In the fourth installment of the ''[[Devil May Cry]]'' series, having never knew his father, Nero's nature as Vergil's son begins to manifest when he injured himself protecting his childhood friend Kyrie from a pack of demons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.destructoid.com/let-s-discuss-devil-may-cry-4-319342.phtml|title=Let's discuss Devil May Cry 4|publisher=Destructoid|author=Voltech|date=8 November 2015|accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later while attending a mass at the Order of the Sword, Nero's injured arm mutated into the Devil Bringer as the result of seeing Kyrie endangered when Dante appeared and killed their religious leader Santus and what he learned were demons dressed as Order acolytes. As he made a reputation as a lone wolf, Nero is given a mission to find and capture Dante.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Devil May Cry 4|publisher=Capcom|year=2008|developer=Capcom|quote='''Nero:''' Guy just came from Hell, he's gotta hit up a couple tourist sites. /'''Credo:''' You jest so lightly in a time of crisis? You must capture him.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his journey, Nero learns that the influx of demons on the island were arranged by Sanctus and learns of his resurrect as a demon by the Order's scientist Agnus, who developed demons from reverse engineering the remains of Nelo Angelo and Vergil's Devil Arms sword {{nihongo|Yamato|閻魔刀}}. Nero escaped death as Yamato sensed its master blood in Nero, fully awakening his powers while revealing him as a descendant of Sparda.

This revelation convinces Sanctus into using Kyrie as bait to force Nero into assuming the role he intended Dante in animating the Savior colossus he created to wipe out all the demons and create a new utopia after destroying the world. But Dante sabotages Sanctus's plans and frees Nero so he can save Kyrie and destroy both Sanctus and the Savior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Devil May Cry 4|publisher=Capcom|year=2008|quote='''Sanctus:''' We had originally intended Dante to form the Savior's core. Perhaps it would have been wise to adhere to that choice. /'''Nero''': Too late for regrets.

A ''Devil May Cry 4'' novel by Bingo Morihashi expands Nero's background; he was found as a baby in Fortuna and was bullied by other children who claimed his mother was a prostitute. Nero was taken by Credo and Kyrie's family, and later joined the [[Order of the Sword]] to defeat demons, though Nero often worked alone. During the main story, Dante states he has fun interacting with Nero because Nero reminds him of his brother Vergil but cannot understand their connection.&lt;ref name="novel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capcom-fc.com/devil4column/2009/04/_deadly_fortune.html|title=デビルメイクライ４ -Deadly Fortune-1|publisher=Capcom|language=Japanese|accessdate=May 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="novel2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capcom-fc.com/devil4column/2009/07/_deadly_fortune_1.html |title=デビルメイクライ４ -Deadly Fortune-2 |publisher=Capcom |language=Japanese |accessdate=2 May 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602104915/http://www.capcom-fc.com/devil4column/2009/07/_deadly_fortune_1.html |archivedate= 2 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2018, Capcom confirmed Nero's father is Vergil.&lt;ref name="Jane Flowers"/&gt;

Nero will be one of the main protagonists of the upcoming game ''[[Devil May Cry 5]]''; he is depicted as being older than in the previous game and having lost his demonic arm, he wears a prosthetic arm to fight. Nero is shown to be a member of the mobile branch of Dante's "Devil May Cry" business and is working alongside a woman named Nico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/06/10/devi-may-cry-5-gives-dante-some-youtuber-swagger-and-a-robot-arm/|title=Devil May Cry 5 gives Nero some YouTuber swagger and a robot arm|publisher=Venture Beat|author=Stephanie Chan|date=10 June 2018|accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nero was also planned to appear in the [[fighting game]] ''[[Tatsunoko vs. Capcom]]'' but he was not available due to time constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2009/05/17/these-characters-didnt-make-the-tatsunoko-vs-capcom-cut/|title=These Characters Didn’t Make The Tatsunoko vs. Capcom Cut|publisher=Siliconera|accessdate=June 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is mentioned in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3]]'' by [[Deadpool]] while interacting with Dante.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds|publisher=Capcom|year=2011|quote='''Deadpool:''' Next time, maybe you should let Nero do your fightin', skippy.|developer=Capcom}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fighting game ''[[Street Fighter V]]'', Nero's original appearance serves an alternate design for Ed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dualshockers.com/street-fighter-v-getting-devil-may-cry-costumes-updated-survival-mode/|title=Street Fighter V Getting Devil May Cry Costumes, Updated Survival Mode and More|publisher=Dual Shockers|accessdate=June 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:Nero (Devil May Cry).jpg|thumb|right|Capcom stated fan response to Nero's ''Devil May Cry 4'' appearance has been positive.&lt;ref name="hobby"/&gt;]]

Nero has received many reviews from video game critics. Since his introduction in a demo, [[GameSpot]] felt the character would appeal to the series' fans, although Dante was more popular within the fandom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-07-devil-may-cry-4-hands-on-the-return-of-dante/1100-6169936/|title=E3 07: Devil May Cry 4 Hands-On - The Return of Dante|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=June 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dante's replacement with Nero as the new main character was the subject of controversy within the fandom; ''GameAxis Unwired'' expected he would play similarly to Dante and that his Devil Bringer power would satisfy newcomers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=sOoDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=nero+devil+may+cry&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjz_fCmrOjbAhXFlJAKHR_BA-0QuwUIOjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=nero%20devil%20may%20cry&amp;f=false|date=July 2007|pages=20–21|title=Game Axis Unwired|publisher=SPH Magazines|accessdate=June 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nero's gamplay style was praised by [[IGN]], which said he "strike[s] the right tone of gravity and sarcasm".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/02/04/devil-may-cry-4-review-2?page=4|title=Devil May Cry 4 Review|publisher=[[IGN]]|author=Jeff Haynes|date=4 February 2008|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Capsule Monster]] labeled Nero as "our anti-hero with a heart" and enjoyed the character's mechanics as much as Dante's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capsulecomputers.com.au/devil-may-cry-4-special-edition-review/|title=Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition Review|publisher=Capsule Monsters|author=|date=|accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite finding Nero a likable character due to his personality, GameSpot said players would also be pleased with the switch between Nero and Dante as ''Devil May Cry 4'' progresses. [[Den of Geek]] noted that while his debut might have surprised fans of Dante, his similar appearance and distinctive style might appeal to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/devil-may-cry-4-special-edition-review/1900-6416173/|title=Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition Review|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=June 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GameSpy]] described his combat by saying,  "He has a fuel injector built in, so that he can 'rev' up his blade for charged attacks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/devil-may-cry-4/843481p1.html|title=Devil May Cry 4 is one of early 2008's hottest titles|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|author=Sterling McGarvey|date=3 January 2008|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[US Gamer]] noted that despite Nero being one of the easiest characters from ''Special Edition'' to use, his combat still provides depth and that defeating the bosses was far more challenging using Nero than using Dante.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usgamer.net/articles/devil-may-cry-4-special-edition-xbox-one-review-in-the-details|title=Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition Xbox One Review: In the Details|publisher=[[US Gamer]]|accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While noting similarities between Nero and Dante, Metro said the former's other skills make him unique due to his swordsmanship and Devil Bringer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/2015/06/30/devil-may-cry-4-special-edition-review-the-real-dante-5272896/|title=Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition review – the real Dante|publisher=Metro|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; IGN also listed the Devil Bringer as the ninth-best weapon in the ''Devil May Cry'' series because Nero can attack any kind of enemy with his arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/videos/2013/01/22/dmc-top-10-devil-may-cry-weapons|title=DMC: DEVIL MAY CRY - TOP 10 DEVIL MAY CRY WEAPONS|publisher=IGN|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dual Shockers enjoyed Nero's combat, which it said added new depth to the series because it is different from Dante's. The website, however, dismissed Nero's story, finding it unappealing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dualshockers.com/2013/07/22/then-and-now-the-devil-may-cry-series/|publisher=Dual Shockers|accessdate=30 June 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.li/yMdO8#selection-1737.251-1737.341|archivedate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capcom said it would not make a bad protagonist similar to that of ''Metal Gear Solid 2''.&lt;ref name="comparison"/&gt; GameZone found Nero likable based on his actions in the plot and his powers.&lt;ref name="gamezone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xbox360.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r28090.htm|title=Devil May Cry 4|publisher=Game Zone|archiveurl=http://archive.li/4O0zc#selection-625.0-628.0|archivedate=February 25, 2013|accessdate=June 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Game Informer]] agreed with GameZone, stating that Nero is as likable as Dante because he "lives up to his legacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameinformer.com/Games/Review/200803/R08.0205.1105.44993.htm|title=Devil May Cry 4 Review|publisher=Game Informer|archiveurl=http://archive.li/8ZXma#selection-1055.470-1055.574|archivedate=February 24, 2014|accessdate=June 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' was more critical about his introduction because he replaced Dante while comparing him to ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'' protagonist [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]] based on personality traits that make him unlikable. Despite finding Nero's improvements in abilities less enjoyable, ''Edge'' still found that players will still find Dante more appealing in the progress of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/review/devil-may-cry-4-review/|title=Devil May Cry 4 Review|publisher=Edge|archiveurl=https://archive.is/rO3nH|archivedate=January 15, 2013|accessdate=June 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''[[1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die]]'', the author said the change to Nero from Dante was an attempt to please new gamers to the franchise because Nero performs simpler moves than Dante, who the writer said many players might have found boring due to the amount of moves and apparent decrease of sales in the series. The book describes Nero as a "a dead ringer" with moves similar to those of Kratos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die|publisher=Universe Publishing|year=2010|isbn=978-0-7893-2090-2|url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=olpPoAswgHoC&amp;pg=PT1601&amp;dq=nero+devil+may+cry&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiUtajuhvLbAhXFhpAKHSlEBFwQuwUIWzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=nero%20devil%20may%20cry&amp;f=false|chapter=Devil May Cry 4|author=Mott, Tony}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bosch's voice acting in the English-language version was also praised by GameZone for the way he portrays Nero,&lt;ref name="gamezone"/&gt; with GameSpot agreeing, calling Bosch's work "superb acting makes for one of the most appealing new game characters to be introduced in some time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/devil-may-cry-4-review/1900-6185608/|title=Devil May Cry 4 Review|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=June 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reaction to Nero's upcoming role in ''Devil May Cry 5'' has been mostly positive. [[GamesRadar]] found Nero's actions in the ''Devil May Cry 5'' trailer appealing due to the way his character engages demons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/devil-may-cry-5-release-date-trailer-gameplay-details-and-more/|title=Devil May Cry 5 release date, trailer, gameplay details and more|publisher=[[GamesRadar]]|author=Bradley, Alab|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While joking about Nero's new look, ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' enjoyed his actions in the trailer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/2018/06/10/software-shows-off-new-samurai-game-sekiro-shadows-die-twice-7620680/|title=From Software shows off new samurai game Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice|publisher=Metro|author=|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; IGN criticized Nero's appearance in ''Devil May Cry 5'', comparing it to the redesigned version of Dante by [[Ninja Theory]] as a desperate, failed attempt to appeal to gamers during the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2018]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/15/e3-2018-opinion-devil-may-cry-5-and-crackdown-3-are-suffering-from-a-similar-identity-crisis|title=E3 2018: OPINION: DEVIL MAY CRY 5 AND CRACKDOWN 3 ARE SUFFERING FROM A SIMILAR IDENTITY CRISIS|publisher=[[IGN]]|author=|accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Machitery Okabe from [[Capcom]], however, stated the response from gamers to Nero's new appearance was positive.&lt;ref name="hobby"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hobbyconsolas.com/noticias/director-devil-may-cry-5-habla-nuevo-diseno-nero-265107|title=El director de Devil May Cry 5 habla del nuevo diseño de Nero|publisher=[[Hobby Consolas]]|author=|accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a confusing scene in the trailer in which it appears Vergil cuts Nero's arm, [[Kotaku]] was looking forward for the return of the three main characters—Dante, Vergil and Nero—in the game based on the preview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/devil-may-cry-5-announced-for-next-year-1826713438|title=Devil May Cry 5 Is Coming Next Year|publisher=Kotaku|accessdate=June 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Kokatu writer praised Nero's new costume and his metallic arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/the-best-video-game-fashion-from-e3-2018-1826843507|title=The Best Video Game Fashion From E3 2018|publisher=Kotaku|accessdate=July 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daily Star found the character likable based on his personality which reminded him on the comic superhero [[Spider-man]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/682955/Devil-May-Cry-5-Nero-Dante-DMC-News-2019-Release-Date-Devil-Trigger-Updates-September-9|title=Devil May Cry 5 Is An Effortlessly Cool Masterclass In Hack N Slash|publisher=Daily Star|accessdate=September 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''nib health funds''' ('''nib''', formerly Newcastle Industrial Benefits) is an [[Australia]]n financier and facilitator of [[health care in Australia]]. It was established in the NSW Hunter Region in 1952 to provide health insurance for workers at the BHP Steelworks, and has since grown into a national and international operation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nib.com.au/home/newtonib/about/pages/companyhistory.aspx nib health funds ''Company History'']&lt;/ref&gt; providing health and medical insurance to more than one million Australian and New Zealand residents.

== History ==

===Privatisation===
In 2007, nib became the first private health insurance fund to list on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asx.com.au/asx/research/companyInfo.do?by=asxCode&amp;asxCode=NHF ASX ''nib holdings limited'']&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of meetings of eligible policyholders and company members held in Newcastle on 19 July 2007 voted overwhelmingly in favour of demutualisation of the health fund.&lt;ref name=premium&gt;{{cite news|title=nib shares debut at healthy premium|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/nib-shares-debut-at-healthy-premium/2007/11/05/1194117936643.html|accessdate=25 November 2014|newspaper=[[The Age]]|date=5 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal Court of Australia then approved the vote the following week with the demutualisation completed on 5 November 2007.

The share price opened at $AUD0.85.

===Diversification and Expansion===

In 2010, nib set about expanding the business globally, entering into the international workers and international students market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nib.com.au/overseas-students|title=OSHC|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nib.com.au/overseas-working-visitors|title=IMAN|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To support this expansion, nib purchased IMAN International Pty Ltd, a specialist provider of health cover for temporary migrant workers in Australia for approximately $25 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nib.com.au/nib-news/content/archive/2010/07/ASX%20Announcement_nib%20acquires%20IMAN_050710.pdf|title=IMAN announcement|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, nib acquired the New Zealand health insurer, TOWER Medical Insurance Limited (TOWER Medical), for approximately NZ$102 million (Au$80 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afr.com/business|title=AFR article|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  nib New Zealand is the country’s second largest health insurer, providing health and medical insurance to around 160,000 New Zealanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nib.com.au/nib-news/content/archive/2012/11/ASX%20Announcement_nib%20acquires%20TMIL%20NZ_021112.pdf|title=nib NZ|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

nib established its first whitelabelling partnership in May 2014, entering a strategic distribution alliance with Apia to sell private health insurance under the Apia brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nib.com.au/nib-news/media/2014/05/nib-and-apia-enter-distribution-alliance|title=Apia|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11774">'''Note by Note cuisine''' is a style of cooking based on [[molecular gastronomy]], created by [[Hervé This]]. [[Dish (food)|Dishes]] are made using [[Chemical compound|pure compounds]] instead of using animal or plant [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]]. Hervé This said the cuisine is like "a painter using primary colours, or a musician composing electroacoustic music, wave by  wave, using a computer".&lt;ref name="BBC1" /&gt;

==History==
[[File:Hervé This.jpg|thumbnail|Note by Note cuisine was created by Hervé This]]
According to [[Hervé This]], Note by Note cuisine began in 1994.&lt;ref name="BBC1" /&gt; In the French edition of ''[[Scientific American]]'', This wrote that he dreamt of the day when [[recipe]]s gave advice like "add to your [[Bouillon (broth)|bouillon]] two drops of a 0.001 percent solution of [[Benzyl mercaptan|benzylmercaptan]] in [[Ethanol|pure alcohol]]".&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24825582 | title=Is this what we'll eat in the future? | work=BBC News | date=6 November 2013 | accessdate=9 November 2013 | author=Gales, Alain}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Chemistry and Physics in the Kitchen |author1=Kurti, Nicholas |author2=This-Benckhard, Hervé | journal=Scientific American |date=April 1994 | pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; This said promoting the cuisine was a struggle, between 1994 and 1999 (he gave the name in 1997) and he got no [[remuneration]] out of it (and even today, he is not selling anything, nor products, or machine, or education).&lt;ref name="PBS" /&gt;  After 2006, he convinced his friend the French chef [[Pierre Gagnaire]] to develop Note by Note dishes, and after about one year of work, Pierre Gagnaire served the first Note  by  Note dish ever served in a restaurant.&lt;ref name="PBS" /&gt; They presented the first Note by Note dish ("Note à note N°1") in Hong Kong the 26th of April 2008.&lt;ref name="PBS" /&gt; Then, after more common work, Pierre Gagnaire named the second Note by Note dish called "Chick Corea", after the [[Chick Corea|jazz pianist of the same name]].&lt;ref name="PBS" /&gt;

In 2012, This published ''La cuisine note à note'', where the concept of Note by Note cuisine is discussed.&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/physics/synthetic-food-better-cooking-through-chemistry/ | title=Synthetic Food: Better Cooking Through Chemistry | work=PBS | date=5 June 2013 | accessdate=9 November 2013 | author=Ashley, Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since the proposal of note by note cooking, This succeeded having many places in world to organize Note by Note dinners of events. For example: 
- 2010 : lecture at the meeting of the  Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, in Strasbourg,  in order to invite two Alsatian cooks,  Hubert Maetz and Aline Kuntz, to make two note by note dishes, that they did in front of the audience.

- 2010 : at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Gastronomy, note by note educational dinner at the Ecole du Corbon bleu, in Paris. The chefs were Patrick Terrien, Patrick Caals, Frédéric Lesourd, Bruno Stril, Philippe Clergue, Marc Thivet, Franck Poupard, Patrick Lebouc, Jean-François Deguignet, Jean-Jacques Tranchant, Nicolas Bernardé (MOF), and Xavier Cotte. And the menu was the following: 
Royale de sous bois, blanc-manger truffé et bouillon légèrement mousseux
Profondeur iodée de poulpe et Saint-Pierre, écume et transparence de spaghettis aux cèpes
Pigeonneau en deux cuissons, sa compotée de cuisses, potimarron fondant, gelée aux polyphénols, asperges virtuelles
Mille-feuille de chèvre frais au siphon
Guimauve en deux textures
Ardoise « This »
Sucrette glacée au parfum de Menton

- 2011 : for the International Year of Chemistry, the official partner was the  Dow Chemicals Company, who accepted to fund a note by note banquet, the day before the official opening at  UNESCO, in Paris : the 26 th of January, the team of the catering company  Potel &amp; Chabot, under the direction of the chef  Jean-Pierre Biffi, served a wonderful menu  : 
Sur une idée d'huitres : huitres de tapioca, bavarois d'amylopectine, tapioca de citron vert, eau de mer gelée, crème d'huitres, vapeur cristallisée
Soufflé au homard, sauce wöhler et gelée de framboises
Fibres de bœuf, capellini, cylindres orange
Boule de cassis
This menu was also served at the Michelin Star Ceremony organized by the journal L'Hôtellerie-Restauration, the same year in Paris. 

- October 2011, another note by note dinner was served by the chefs-teachers of the Cordon bleu School, in Paris. The chefs were  Patrick Terrien, Patrick Caals, Philippe Clergue, Frédéric Lesourd, Patrick Lebouc, Franck Poupard, Bruno Stril and Marc Thivet,  Jean-François Deguignet, Xavier Cotte, Nicolas Jordan and Jean-Jacques Tranchant, and the menu was: 
Mille feuilles terre et mer trois couleurs, souligné des deux sauces Kientzheim et crustacés
Recherche note à note en pot-au-feu
Reconstitution d'une mozarella, huile d'olive et mâche
Le dessert Cordon bleu

- November 2011 : the Association  Toques blanches internationales was doing his first « Workshop innovation »,  on note by note cooking  :  Jean-Pierre Lepeltier (Hôtel Renaissance La Défense, Paris), David Desplanques (Hôtel Crowne Plazza République, Paris), Michael Foubert (Hôtel Renaissance Arc de Triomphe), Marie Soyez (Hôtel Renaissance La Défense, Paris), David Crenn (Hôtel Renaissance La Défense, Paris), Vincent Vitasse (Hôtel Concorde Lafayette, Paris), Julien Mercier (Hôtel Pullmann Bercy, Paris) were experimenting, after some products were shown. 

- December 2011 : This workshop led, this same year in December, on culinary courses given by the chefs of the same Association, during the raise funding event  Téléthon:  Jean-Pierre Lepeltier (Hôtel Renaissance La Défense, Paris), David Desplanques (Hôtel Crowne Plazza République, Paris), Michael Foubert (Hôtel Renaissance Arc de Triomphe), Marie Soyez (Hôtel Renaissance La Défense, Paris), David Crenn (Hôtel Renaissance La Défense, Paris), Vincent Vitasse (Hôtel Concorde Lafayette, Paris), Julien Mercier (Hôtel Pullmann Bercy, Paris) were educating public that had paid for the courses and taste the dishes. 

- April 2012, a series of lectures and press conferences were organized at the  Institut du Tourisme et d'Hôtellerie du Québec (ITHQ), in Montreal. For the first press conference, the chef Ismael Osorio and the scientist Erik Ayala Bribiesca,  along with chefs and students of  ITHQ, served four bouchées note by note to about  150 journalists. 
The next day, a note by note meal that was less  « art moderne » was served to international journalists, with comments. 

- 2012  was also the year in which the public and free Courses on molecular gastronomy discussed note by note cooking. During three podcasted days of lectures, chefs were invited : Philippe Clergue, from le Cordon bleu, and  Jean Pierre Lepeltier, the president of the Toques blanches internationales. The courses are on line on the internet site of AgroParisTech  http://www2.agroparistech.fr/podcast/-Cours-2012-La-cuisine-note-a-note-.html

- July 2012 :  at Euroscience Open Forum, Dublin, Ireland, a lecture by Hervé This was followed by the production of note by note food samples by the chef David Desplanques. 

-August 2012 :  note by note cooking was shown to the students of the Eramus Mundus Master Program Food Innovation and Product Design, at AgroParisTech, Paris. The chef Jean-Pierre Lepeltier (Hôtel Renaissance La Défense, Paris) came to show new note by note dishes. 

Later, there are too many things, such as a new workshop of the  Toques blanches internationales, in August 2012, a press conference with demonstrations when the book "La cuisine note à note en 12 questions souriantes" was shown to the press, with dishes prepared by  chefs  Jean-Pierre Lepeltier, chef Hôtel Renaissance Paris La Défense, Laurent Renouf, sous chef  Hôtel Renaissance Paris La Défense, Julien Lasry, chef de partie Hôtel Renaissance Paris La Défense, Marie Soyer, chef de partie Hôtel Renaissance Paris La Défense, Mickael Foubert, chef Hôtel Renaissance Arc de Triomphe, Lucille Bouche, sous chef Hôtel Renaissance Le parc Trocadéro, Yannick Jaouen (sous-chef Hôtel Mariott Rive Gauche Paris)

- In 2013, the first International Contest for Note by Note Cooking took place in Paris.  Pierre Gagnaire came and showed the dish named « Chick Corea », that was previously shown at the Book Fair of Paris, some weeks earlier. 
Now, the Contest is having its seventh event, after : 
- 2014 : using methional
- 2015,  playing with proteins, octenol
- 2016, using cellulose and trigeminal compounds
- 2017, fibrous consistencies and acidities
- 2018  : crackling

In July 2013 the Company Mane produced a box of about 20 compounds that was offered to some French chefs, allowing training chefs in the restaurant of Akrame, then at the  Plaza Athénée. 

Since, all went faster, with about  200 lectures per year, all over the world, showing note by note cooking. 
Some items only:  
- in Denmark, in   2014,the University of Aarhus and chefs produced a note by note meal served to the king family. 
- in Estoril, Portugal, in Boston and New York, in some French culinary schools, as well, note by note cooking is taught.
- in Japan, 2015, a collaboration of the  Corbon bleu and  Ritsumekan University led to showing note by note sushis to the press, by the  chef Guillaume Siegler. 
Then, in  2015, when a journalist of the  New York Times came to  Paris in order to make a piece on note by note cooking, the chef Pierre Gagnaire accepted to make  a whole menu in which all dishes were based on one single odorant compound.  The menu was :
''Amuses bouche
1-cis-hexen-3-ol
gaïacol et 2,4,6-triisobutyl-5-dihydro-4H-1,3,5-dithiazine
2-acétylthiazole
acétyl méthyl carbinol acétyl propionyl
pipérine
Chick Corea
benzaldéhyde''

Now, the most important : 
- in 2016, a lecture at the World Chefs Association, in Thessaloniki
- in 2017, a company was created by a young French entrepreneur to sell note by note compounds. 
- in May 2017, the chef Andrea Camastra moved to full Note by Note, in his restaurant Senses, in Warsaw, Poland
- in February 2018, a  100 % Note by Note Dinner served by the Alsatian chef Julien Binz (Michelin Star), in Ammerschwihr, Alsace (France)
- in  April 2018, a Note by Note Dinner at the Culinary School Le Monde, Athens, Greece
- in July 2018, two Note by Note Dinners served by chefs of the At-Sunrice Global Chef Academy, in Singapore, to Ministers, Ambassadors and other distinguished guests

Now,  note by note  is regularly taught in some universities, including AgroParisTech and the Dublin Institute of Technology, whereas the International contest goes on every year at AgroParisTech.

==Preparation==
Ingredients used in Note by Note cuisine are called compounds, which include [[water]], [[ethanol]], [[sucrose]], [[protein]], [[amino acids]] and [[lipids]].&lt;ref name="PBS" /&gt; For example, in the "wölher sauce" made by Note by Note cuisine, the following might be added: water, [[anthocyanin]]s (for colour), [[sugar]]s, ethanol, amino acids (for flavour), [[glycerol]], [[phenols]], [[quinones]], and [[organic acid]]s.&lt;ref name="PBS" /&gt;

'''Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency''' (or '''OTC deficiency''') is the most common [[urea cycle disorder]] in humans. It is an inherited disorder which causes toxic levels of [[ammonia]] to build up in the blood.&lt;ref name=GeneticsHomeReference&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/ornithine-transcarbamylase-deficiency|title=Ornithing transcarbamylase deficiency |date=22 May 2018 |accessdate=25 May 2018 |publisher=[[United States National Library of Medicine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ornithine transcarbamylase]], the defective [[enzyme]] in this disorder, is the final enzyme in the proximal portion of the [[urea cycle]]. It is responsible for converting [[carbamoyl phosphate]] and [[ornithine]] into [[citrulline]]. OTC deficiency is inherited in an [[X-linked recessive]] manner, meaning males are more commonly affected than females.

In severely affected individuals, [[hyperammonemia|ammonia concentrations]] increase rapidly, causing [[ataxia]], [[lethargy]], and death without rapid intervention. OTC deficiency is diagnosed using a combination of clinical findings and biochemical testing, while confirmation is often done using molecular genetics techniques.

Once an individual has been diagnosed, the treatment goal is to avoid precipitating episodes that can cause an increased ammonia concentration. The most common treatment combines a low protein diet with nitrogen scavenging agents. Liver transplant is considered curative for this disease. Experimental trials of [[gene therapy]] using adenoviral vectors resulted in the death of one participant, [[Jesse Gelsinger]], and have been discontinued.

==Signs and symptoms==
OTC deficiency can become apparent at any age. Early-onset OTC deficiency is most commonly found in males. Later in life, the disease may present in both males and females. 

In the classic presentation, a male infant appears well initially, but by the second day of life becomes irritable, lethargic, and stops feeding. Infants may have poorly-controlled body temperature and respiratory rates, and may experience [[seizure]]s.&lt;ref name=GeneticsHomeReference/&gt; Without urgent intervention, a metabolic [[encephalopathy]] develops; this can progress to [[coma]] and death within the first week of life.&lt;ref name=Wraith /&gt; High levels of ammonia cause preferential damage to the brain, leading to devastating consequences.&lt;ref name=Walker&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Walker | first1 = V. | title = Ammonia toxicity and its prevention in inherited defects of the urea cycle | doi = 10.1111/j.1463-1326.2009.01054.x | journal = Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism | volume = 11 | issue = 9 | pages = 823–835 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19531057 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later onset forms of OTC deficiency can have variable presentations. Although late onset forms of the disease are often considered milder than the classic infantile presentation, any affected individual is at risk for an episode of hyperammonemia that could still be life-threatening if presented with the appropriate stressors.&lt;ref name=genereviews&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lichter-Konecki | first1 = U. | last2 = Caldovic | first2 = L. | last3 = Morizono | first3 = H. | last4 = Simpson | first4 = K. | last5 = Pagon | first5 = R.

T. | last10 = Stephens | first10 = K. | title = Ornithine Transcarbamylase Deficiency | year = 1993 | pmid = 24006547}}&lt;/ref&gt; These patients will often present with headaches, nausea, vomiting, delirium, erratic behavior, or seizures.&lt;ref name = GeneticsHomeReference /&gt; A detailed dietary history of an affected individual with undiagnosed OTC deficiency will often reveal a history of protein avoidance.&lt;ref name = genereviews /&gt;

The prognosis of a patient with severe OTC deficiency is well correlated with the length of the hyperammonemic period rather than the degree of hyperammonemia or the presence of other symptoms, such as seizures.&lt;ref name=genereviews /&gt; Even for patients with late onset forms of the disease, their overall clinical picture is dependent on the extent of hyperammonemia they have experienced, even if it has remained unrecognized.&lt;ref name=Walker /&gt;

==Genetics==
[[Image:X-linked recessive.svg|thumb|right|OTC deficiency is inherited in a X-linked recessive manner]]

OTC deficiency is caused by mutations in the ''[[Ornithine transcarbamylase|OTC]]'' gene, which is located on the [[X chromosome]].&lt;ref name=omim&gt;{{cite web|title=#311250 - Ornithine Transcarbamylase Deficiency, Hyperammonemia Due To | url = http://omim.org/entry/311250 | publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University]] | accessdate = 2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''OTC'' codes for the [[mitochondria]]l enzyme [[ornithine transcarbamylase]], which is expressed only in liver. The functional enzyme consists of three identical subunits.&lt;ref name=genbank&gt;{{cite web|title = Human ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) mRNA, complete coding sequence | publisher = US National Library of Medicine  }}&lt;/ref&gt; OTC is the last enzyme in the proximal portion of the urea cycle, which consists of the reactions that take place in the mitochondria. The [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrates]] of the reaction catalyzed by ornithine transcarbamylase are [[ornithine]] and carbamyl phosphate, while the product is [[citrulline]].&lt;ref name=Walker /&gt;

There are no common mutations that cause disease, however 10 - 15% of disease causing mutations are deletions.&lt;ref name=omim /&gt; It is inherited in an [[X-linked recessive]] manner, meaning males are more commonly affected than females. Females who carry a defective copy of the gene can be severely affected or asymptomatic, largely depending on the random nature of [[X-inactivation]].&lt;ref name = omim /&gt; There is some degree of genotype - phenotype correlation with OTC deficiency, but this depends on a number of situations. Individuals with milder mutations, often associated with late onset disease can still present with severe illness when exposed to sufficient metabolic stress. Correlations are more difficult to ascertain in females, since the residual activity of OTC in the liver is impacted not only by the nature of the mutation, but also by the random pattern of X-inactivation.&lt;ref name=genereviews /&gt; OTC deficiency is estimated to be the most common [[urea cycle disorder]].&lt;ref name=genereviews /&gt; An exact incidence is difficult to calculate, due to the varying clinical presentations of later onset forms of the disease. Early estimates of the incidence were as high as 1:14,000 live births, however later studies have decreased these estimates to approximately 1:60,000 - 1:72,000.&lt;ref name = genereviews /&gt;

==Diagnosis==
In individuals with marked hyperammonemia, a urea cycle disorder is usually high on the list of possible causes. While the immediate focus is lowering the patient's ammonia concentrations, identifying the specific cause of increased ammonia levels is key as well.

Diagnostic testing for OTC deficiency, or any individual with hyperammonemia involves plasma and urine amino acid analysis, urine organic acid analysis (to identify the presence or absence of [[orotic acid]], as well as rule out an [[organic acidemia]]) and plasma acylcarnitines (will be normal in OTC deficiency, but can identify some other causes of hyperammonemia). An individual with untreated OTC deficiency will show decreased [[citrulline]] and [[arginine]] concentrations (because the enzyme block is proximal to these intermediates) and increased orotic acid. The increased orotic acid concentrations result from the buildup of [[carbamoyl phosphate]]. This biochemical phenotype (increased ammonia, low citrulline and increased orotic acid) is classic for OTC deficiency, but can also be seen in neonatal presentations of [[ornithine aminotransferase deficiency]].&lt;ref name= Wraith /&gt; Only severely affected males consistently demonstrate this classic biochemical phenotype.

Heterozygous females can be difficult to diagnose. With the rise of sequencing techniques, molecular testing has become preferred, particularly when the disease causing mutations in the family are known.&lt;ref name=omim /&gt; Historically, heterozygous females were often diagnosed using an [[allopurinol]] challenge. In a female with reduced enzyme activity, an oral dose of allopurinol would be metabolized to oxypurinol ribonucleotide, which blocks the [[pyrimidine]] biosynthetic pathway. When this induced enzymatic block is combined with reduced physiologic enzyme activity as seen in heterozygotes, the elevation of orotic acid could be used to differentiate heterozygotes from unaffected individuals. This test was not universally effective, as it had both [[false negative]] and [[false positive]] results.&lt;ref name=Walker /&gt;

[[Ornithine transcarbamylase]] is only expressed in the liver, thus performing an enzyme assay to confirm the diagnosis requires a liver biopsy. Before molecular genetic testing was commonly available, this was one of the only methods for confirmation of a suspected diagnosis. In cases where [[prenatal diagnosis]] was requested, a fetal liver biopsy used to be required to confirm if a fetus was affected.&lt;ref name = Wraith/&gt; Modern molecular techniques have eliminated this need, and gene sequencing is now the preferred method of diagnosis in asymptomatic family members after the diagnosis has been confirmed in a [[proband]].&lt;ref name=genereviews /&gt;&lt;ref name=omim /&gt;

==Treatment==
The treatment goal for individuals affected with OTC deficiency is the avoidance of hyperammonemia. This can be accomplished through a strictly controlled low-protein diet, as well as preventative treatment with nitrogen scavenging agents such as [[sodium benzoate]]. The goal is to minimize the nitrogen intake while allowing waste nitrogen to be excreted by alternate pathways.&lt;ref name=omim /&gt; [[Arginine]] is typically supplemented as well, in an effort to improve the overall function of the urea cycle.&lt;ref name=omim /&gt; If a hyperammonemic episode occurs, the aim of treatment is to reduce the individual's ammonia levels as soon as possible. In extreme cases, this can involve [[hemodialysis]].&lt;ref name=Wraith&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wraith | first1 = J. E. | title = Ornithine carbamoyltransferase deficiency | journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood | volume = 84 | issue = 1 | pages = 84–88 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11124797 | pmc = 1718609 | doi = 10.1136/adc.84.1.84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gene therapy]] had been considered a possibility for curative treatment for OTC deficiency, and [[clinical trials]] were taking place at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in the late 1990s. These were halted after the death of [[Jesse Gelsinger]], a young man taking part in a phase I trial using an [[adenovirus]] vector.&lt;ref name=Deakin2009&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Deakin | first1 = C.

== Prognosis ==
A 1999 retrospective study of 74 cases of neonatal onset found that 32 (43%) patients died during their first hyperammonemic episode. Of those who survived, less than 20% survived to age 14. Few of these patients received liver transplants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maestri|first=N. E.|last2=Clissold|first2=D.|last3=Brusilow|first3=S.

Even with proper identification and treatment, the majority of patients who present in the neonatal period have severe neurological and intellectual impairments. Liver transplantation cannot cure brain damage which has already occurred, but it will prevent future hyperammonemic episodes and prevent further damage.&lt;ref name=Wraith/&gt;

'''Photokeratitis''' or '''ultraviolet keratitis''' is a painful eye condition caused by exposure of insufficiently protected [[Human eye|eyes]] to the [[ultraviolet]] (UV) rays from either natural (e.g. intense [[sunlight]]) or artificial (e.g. the [[electric arc]] during [[welding]]) sources. Photokeratitis is akin to a [[sunburn]] of the [[cornea]] and [[conjunctiva]], and is not usually noticed until several hours after exposure. Symptoms include increased tears and a feeling of pain, likened to having sand in the eyes.

The injury may be prevented by wearing eye protection that blocks most of the ultraviolet radiation, such as [[welding goggles]] with the proper filters, a welder's helmet, sunglasses rated for sufficient UV protection, or appropriate snow goggles. The condition is usually managed by removal from the source of ultraviolet radiation, covering the corneas, and administration of pain relief. Photokeratitis is known by a number of different terms including: '''snow blindness''', '''[[electric arc|arc]] eye''', '''welder's flash''', '''bake eyes''', '''corneal flash burns''', '''sand man's eye''', '''flash burns''', '''niphablepsia''',  '''potato eye''', or '''keratoconjunctivitis photoelectrica'''.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Common symptoms include pain, intense [[lacrimation|tears]], [[Blepharospasm|eyelid twitching]], [[Photophobia|discomfort]] from bright light,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/cache/389349390.htm |title=Arc eye – General Practice Notebook |date=2007-03-25 |accessdate=2012-02-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070325003031/http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/cache/389349390.htm |archivedate=2007-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[constricted pupils]].

== Cause ==
Any intense exposure to UV light can lead to photokeratitis.  Common causes include [[welder]]s who have failed to use adequate eye protection such as an appropriate welding helmet or welding goggles. This is termed ''arc eye'', while photokeratitis caused by exposure to sunlight reflected from ice and snow, particularly at elevation, is commonly called ''snow blindness''. It can also occur due to using [[tanning beds]] without proper eyewear. Natural sources include bright [[sunlight]] [[Reflection (physics)|reflected]] from [[snow]] or [[ice]] or, less commonly, from sea or sand.&lt;ref name="gpn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/simplepage.cfm?ID=-268042203|title=Snow blindness|publisher=General Practice Notebook|accessdate=November 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fresh snow reflects about 80% of the UV radiation compared to a dry, sandy [[beach]] (15%) or [[sea foam]] (25%). This is especially a problem in [[polar regions]] and at high altitudes,&lt;ref name="eMedicine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic759.htm|title=Ultraviolet Keratitis|last=Brozen |first=Reed |author2=Christian Fromm |date=February 4, 2008|publisher=eMedicine|accessdate=November 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; as with every thousand feet (approximately 305 meters) of elevation (above sea level), the intensity of [[UV rays]] increases by four percent.&lt;ref name="berkeley"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uhs.berkeley.edu/home/healthtopics/sunsafety.shtml|title=Sun Safety|date=April 2005|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|accessdate=November 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
[[Fluorescein]] dye staining will reveal punctate areas of uptake under ultraviolet light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/799025-overview#a0104 |title=Ultraviolet Keratitis |author=Reed Brozen |date=15 April 2011 |work= |publisher=Medscape.com |accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevention ==
[[File:Inuit snow goggles.jpg|thumb|[[Snow goggles]] traditionally used by the [[Inuit]]]]
Photokeratitis can be prevented by using [[sunglasses]] or eye protection that transmits 5–10% of visible light and absorbs almost all UV rays. Additionally, these glasses should have large lenses and side shields to avoid incidental light exposure. Sunglasses should always be worn, even when the sky is overcast, as UV rays can pass through clouds.&lt;ref name="basecampmd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basecampmd.com/expguide/snowblind.shtml|title=Base Camp MD – Guide to High Altitude Medicine|last=Butler Jr |first=Frank |accessdate=November 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Inuit]], [[Yupik peoples|Yupik]], and other [[Arctic peoples]] carved [[snow goggles]] from materials such as [[driftwood]] or [[caribou]] [[antler]]s to help prevent snow blindness.  Curved to fit the user's face with a large groove cut in the back to allow for the nose, the goggles allowed in a small amount of light through a long thin slit cut along their length.  The goggles were held to the head by a cord made of caribou [[sinew]].&lt;ref name="maritime"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouvermaritimemuseum.com/modules/vmmuseum/treasures/?artifactid=77|title=Inuit Snow Goggles|publisher=Vancouver Maritime Museum|accessdate=November 19, 2008}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event of missing sunglass lenses, emergency lenses can be made by cutting slits in dark fabric or tape folded back onto itself.&lt;!--check source--&gt; The ''[[Special Air Service|SAS]] Survival Guide'' recommends blackening the skin underneath the eyes with [[charcoal]] (as the [[ancient Egypt]]ians did) to avoid any further reflection.&lt;ref name="sassurvivalguide"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wiseman |first=John |title=SAS Survival Guide: How to survive in the wild, in any climate on land or at sea |publisher=Harper Collins |year=2004 |page=45 |chapter=Climate &amp; Terrain |isbn=0-00-718330-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.king-tut.org.uk/ancient-egyptians/egyptian-make-up.htm |title=Egyptian Make Up |publisher=King-tut.org.uk |date=2007-05-29 |accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==
The pain may be temporarily alleviated with anaesthetic [[eye drop]]s for the examination; however, they are not used for continued treatment, as anaesthesia of the eye interferes with corneal healing, and may lead to [[corneal ulcer]]ation and even loss of the eye. Cool, wet [[compress (medical)|compress]]es over the eyes and [[artificial tears]] may help local symptoms when the feeling returns. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ([[NSAID]]) eyedrops are widely used to lessen inflammation and eye pain, but have not been proven in rigorous trials. Systemic (oral) pain medication is given if discomfort is severe. Healing is usually rapid (24–72 hours) if the injury source is removed. Further injury should be avoided by isolation in a dark room, removing contact lenses, not rubbing the eyes, and wearing sunglasses until the symptoms improve.&lt;ref name="eMedicine" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12390">[[Image:Pill splitter 2.jpg|right|thumb|upright|A pill-splitter holding a tablet ready to split.]]

'''Pill-splitting''' refers to the practice of splitting a [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablet]] or [[Pill (pharmacy)|pill]] to provide a lower dose of the active ingredient, or to obtain multiple smaller doses, either to reduce cost or because the pills available provide a larger dose than required.  Many pills that are suitable for splitting ([[aspirin]] tablets for instance) come pre-scored so that they may easily be halved.

It is unsafe to split some [[prescription medication]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pharmacytimes.com/news/FDA-Takes-on-Unsafe-Pill-Splitting/ FDA viewpoint on pill splitting]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Pill splitter 1.jpg|right|thumb|Blade (right of center) and V-shaped pill positioner.]]

== Pill splitters ==
A pill-splitter is a simple and inexpensive device to split medicinal pills or [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]], comprising some means of holding the tablet in place, a blade, and usually a compartment in which to store the unused part. The tablet is positioned, and the blade pressed down to split it. With care it is often possible to cut a tablet into [[4 (number)|quarters]]. Also available as consumer items are ''multiple pill splitters'', which cut numerous round or oblong pills in one operation.

==Pill scoring==
A [[Pharmaceutical industry|drug manufacturer]] may score pills with a [[Groove (engineering)|groove]] to both indicate that a pill may be split and to aid the practice of splitting pills. When manufacturers do create grooves in pills, the groove must be consistent for consumers to be able to use them effectively. Many manufacturers choose to not use grooves. The United States government [[Center for Drug Evaluation and Research]] makes the following recommendations for manufacturers when scoring pills with grooves:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
 | author	= Center for Drug Evaluation and Research
 | authorlink	= Center for Drug Evaluation and Research
 | date		= March 2013
 | title		= Guidance for Industry — Tablet Scoring: Nomenclature, Labeling, and Data for Evaluation
 | publisher	= Food and Drug Administration
 | publication-place = Silver Spring, MD
 | page		= 
 | url		= http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM269921.pdf
 | accessdate	= 3 August 2016
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Pills should only have grooves if the split dosage is at least the minimum therapeutic dosage of the medication
# The split pill should not create a [[toxicity]] hazard
# Drugs which should not be split should not be scored with a groove
# The split pill should be stable for the expected temperature and humidity
# The split pill should have an equivalent effect to a full pill at an equivalent dose

== Dosage uniformity ==
In the U.S. "uniformity of dosage units" is defined by the [[United States Pharmacopeia]] (USP), which describes itself as "the official public standards-setting authority for all prescription and over-the-counter medicines, dietary supplements, and other healthcare products manufactured and sold in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usp.org/aboutUSP/ About USP], USP web site, undated, accessed 25 Nov 2007&lt;/ref&gt; More than 140 countries develop or rely upon US pharmaceutical standards according to the USP.&lt;!-- June 2013: ref says "[USP's] standards are developed and relied upon in more than 140 countries." --&gt;

The USP standard for dosage uniformity expresses statistical criteria in the complex language of [[sampling (statistics)|sampling protocols]].  The pharmaceutical dosage literature sometimes boils this down as requiring a [[standard deviation]] in dosage weight of less than 6%, which roughly corresponds to the weaker rule-of-thumb offered for public consumption that the vast majority of dosage units should be within 15% of the dosage target.  "Dosage unit" is a technical term which covers oral medications (tablets, pills, capsules), as well as non-oral delivery methods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usp.org/USPNF/notices/generalChapter905.html Explanatory Note: USP–NF General Chapter &lt;905&gt; Uniformity of Dosage Units], United States Pharmacopeial Convention, 20 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2002 study of pill-splitting as conducted in four American long-term care facilities determined that 15 of the 22 dispensed prescriptions evaluated (68%) had fragment weight variance in excess of USP standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rosenberg JM, Nathan JP, Plakogiannis F |title=Weight variability of pharmacist-dispensed split tablets |journal=J Am Pharm Assoc (Wash) |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=200–5 |year=2002 |pmid=11926663 |url=http://japha.metapress.com/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,10,24;journal,7,9;linkingpublicationresults,1:120081,1 |doi=10.1331/108658002763508498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cost savings ==
Pill-splitting can be used to save money on pharmaceutical costs, as many prescription pharmaceuticals are sold at prices less than proportional to the dose.  For example, a 10&amp;nbsp;mg tablet of a drug might be sold for the same or nearly the same price as a 5&amp;nbsp;mg tablet. Splitting 10&amp;nbsp;mg tablets allows the patient to purchase half the number of tablets at a lower price than the same weight of 5&amp;nbsp;mg tablets.

Both specialist and generalist physicians are not sufficiently aware of and do not communicate with patients about the cost to them of medication.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander GC, Casalino LP, Metlzer DO. Physician strategies to reduce patients’ out-of-pocket prescription costs. Archives of Internal Medicine. 2005;165:633-636 [alexander.uchicago.edu/publications/image/.../OOPC%20mail%20survey.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Some potentially suitable medications ===
Randall Stafford of the [[Stanford School of Medicine]] published a study in 2002 of common prescription medications in the United States in which he evaluates pill splitting for "potential cost savings and clinical appropriateness".  The study identifies eleven prescription medications that satisfied the study criteria, based on the American pharmaceutical cost structure, pill formulation, and dosages of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stafford RS, Radley DC |title=The potential of pill splitting to achieve cost savings |journal=Am J Manag Care |volume=8 |issue=8 |pages=706–12 |date=August 2002 |pmid=12212758 |url=http://www.ajmc.com/pubMed.php?pii=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the medications listed in the table from the psychiatric drug class are [[antidepressant]]s.

=== Uniformity of split ===
Not all tablets split equally well.  In a 2002 study, [[Paxil]], [[Zestril]] and [[Zoloft]] split cleanly with 0% rejects.  [[Glucophage]] was described as a hard tablet, requiring significant force, causing tablet halves to fly.  [[Glyburide]] exhibited very poor splitting with many splitting into multiple pieces.  [[Hydrodiuril]] and [[Oretic]] crumbled.  [[Lipitor]] did not split cleanly, and the coating peeled.  The diamond shaped [[Viagra]] tablets made location of the midline difficult.  The worst result reported was Oretic 25&amp;nbsp;mg in which 60% of tablets failed to split to within 15% of target weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cross M |title=Two for the price of one beauty of pill-splitting catches on |journal=Manag Care |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=36–8 |date=February 2003 |pmid=12658856 |url=http://www.managedcaremag.com/archives/0302/0302.pillsplitting.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cohen JS |title=Tablet splitting: imperfect perhaps, but better than excessive dosing |journal=J Am Pharm Assoc (Wash) |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=160–2 |year=2002 |pmid=11926659 |url=http://www.medicationsense.com/about_cohen.html |doi=10.1331/108658002763508443 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014010300/http://www.medicationsense.com/about_cohen.html |archivedate=2007-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alternative purpose ===
Some drugs have few different uses, and are usually sold in different packages and different doses for different applications. The price for some applications may be very different from that for other purposes.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} One example is [[Minoxidil]], which is well known as a hair-growth stimulant; the same drug under the name Loniten is used for blood pressure control in much larger doses at a much lower price per unit weight.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

== Risks ==
The [[Food and Drug Administration]] has called pill splitting "risky".&lt;ref name="FDA 2009"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Food and Drug Administration|authorlink1=Food and Drug Administration|title=Tablet Splitting: A Risky Practice|url=http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm171492.htm|website=fda.gov|accessdate=3 August 2016|date=21 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the FDA approves the manufacture of pills which are intended to be split.&lt;ref name="FDA 2009"/&gt;

Splitting pills may result in uneven splitting and creating pieces which will not deliver accurate dosage.&lt;ref name="FDA 2009"/&gt; Pills which are split might not be correctly halved, making the cut pieces unequal in size.&lt;ref name="FDA 2009"/&gt; Some pills are difficult to split.&lt;ref name="FDA 2009"/&gt; Some pills (particularly some [[time release drug]]s)&lt;ref&gt;[[Modified-release dosage#Pill_splitting|See here]] for more info and references&lt;/ref&gt; are unsafe to split, and there could be mistakes in identifying when pills should not be split.&lt;ref name="FDA 2009"/&gt;

==Lawsuits==
In a [[California]] court filing dated April 2001, [[Trial Lawyers for Public Justice]] (TLPJ) brought a class-action lawsuit against [[Kaiser Permanente]] (''Timmis v. Kaiser Permanente'') on the grounds that "Kaiser's mandatory pill-splitting policy endangers patients' health solely to enhance the HMO's profits" in violation of the [[California Unfair Competition Law]] (UCL) and the [[California Consumer Legal Remedies Act]] (CLRA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tlpj.org/pr/kaiser_split.htm TLPJ — Press — Timmis v. Kaiser Permanente (pill splitting) - Dec. 6, 2000&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tlpj.org/briefs/timmis_kaiser.htm TLPJ — Briefs — Timmis v. Kaiser Permanente (pill splitting) - April 22, 2001&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2004, the [[California Court of Appeal]] affirmed the trial court ruling that Kaiser's policy did not violate UCL or CLRA, noting the suit had failed to present evidence that the policy was unsafe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aishealth.com/ManagedCare/HMOLawsuitWatch/TimmisvKaiser.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pulse''''' is a monthly news [[magazine]] and website on British primary care. It has been distributed without charge to [[general practitioner]]s in the United Kingdom since 1960. Its stories are regularly picked up by national and regional newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pulse in the news|url=http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/about-pulse/pulse-in-the-news/#.VVJ6Hoq4_eM|website=Pulse|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is one of a number of magazines often referred to by GPs as "the comics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Do GPs with special interests have a future in the NHS?|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/resource-centre/do-gps-with-special-interests-have-a-future-in-the-nhs/946600.article#.VVJ684q4_eM|first=Daloni |last=Carlisle |accessdate=12 May 2015|work=Health Service Journal|date=7 April 2008|registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2000, the title was owned by [[Miller Freeman, Inc.|Miller Freeman UK]] which went through some restructuring; the part of the business that continued to own Pulse was known as [[UBM plc|United Business Media]] (UBM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/article/66337/miller-freeman-split-magazines-web-brands |title=Miller Freeman to split magazines and web brands |first=Imelda |last=Michalczyk |work=[[Marketing (magazine)|Marketing]] |date=8 June 2000 |accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2012, UBM sold its agriculture and medical portfolios, including Pulse Media Ltd, to the founders of Briefing Media for £10{{nbsp}}million, with the new business being known as Briefing Media Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/9065028/Farmers-Guardian-is-sold-as-UBM-shifts-from-print.html |title=Farmers Guardian is sold as UBM shifts from print |first=Katherine |last=Rushton |work=The Telegraph |date=6 February 2012 |accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19896">The '''Royal Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada''', also known as the '''Romanow Report''', is a committee study led by [[Roy Romanow]] on the future of [[Medicare (Canada)|health care]] in [[Canada]].  It was delivered in December 2002.

Romanow recommended sweeping changes to ensure the long-term sustainability of Canada's health care system.  The proposed changes were outlined in the Commission's Final Report, Building on Values: The Future of Health Care in Canada, which was tabled in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] on 28 November 2002.

Although the Report of the [[Royal Commission]] dealt with a wide range of issues,  much of the early attention was paid to the recommendations with respect to the financing of health care in Canada and especially transfers from the federal government to provincial and territorial governments.

The Report set the stage for another round of federal-provincial/territorial bargaining leading to a significant agreement in September 2004 whereby the Government of Canada agreed to transfer an additional $41 billion over the next 10 years in support of an action plan on health.  The new funding is meant to strengthen ongoing federal health support provided through the Canada Health Transfer (CHT) as well as focus resources on addressing the fact that Canadians, like citizens in other [[OECD]] countries, often have significant wait times for access to essential health care services.

==Issues highlighted by the Romanow Report==

&lt;!--I plan to fully detail this section in the future - Sdason --&gt;

===Aboriginal issues===
The report identifies significant problems in the way that aboriginal health is managed. Surprisingly, this is largely not due to a lack of funding; there is simply a mismanagement of assets. Funding sources are fragmented and there is no established system to provide care. In addition, there are extensive equity concerns due to this fragmentation of funding and differential care available to different Aboriginal communities.

As a result, the report suggests that new administration procedures be put in place. Integration of on-reserve healthcare into the current system is not a popular option amongst aboriginal leaders, although serves as a reasonable option for urban aboriginal healthcare. Specifically, the report suggests the formation of Aboriginal Partnerships that are an administrative authority composed of representatives from different levels of government and the aboriginal community.

These partnerships may work in a method similar to a regional health authority. They will serve as an organization with a specific health goal, such as organizing the public health and primary care for a community. The partnership will be granted federal funds to pursue these health goals in a manner that Partnership executives agree upon. Aboriginal representation in the Partnership ensures that these services are fitting with the cultural needs of the Aboriginal community. Partnerships will also interface with the existing health system to coordinate access to resources such as diagnostics and specialized care.

In an urban setting, the Partnership will serve as a voluntary health organization that coordinates access to specific health facilities such as primary care and diagnostics. The Partnership will have similar representation from Aboriginal community ensuring that services provided in the urban environment are still sensitive to Aboriginal cultural and linguistic concerns. Partnerships are especially needed in urban settings due to the specific needs of urban Aboriginals for problems such as diabetes and addiction. Furthermore, Partnerships may serve as an additional urban community organization that interfaces with other such Aboriginal organizations to serve as activists for the socioeconomic status of Aboriginals.

An important point stressed by the Romanow report is that healthcare initiatives must be accountable towards the taxpayer and consumer. Aboriginal health is no different; Partnerships must be closely monitored and their effect on health outcomes determined. Changes in policy may be necessitated as this is a new approach.&lt;ref&gt;The Romanow Report: A new approach to aboriginal health.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romanow's recommendations==
The conclusion of the Report set out 47 recommendations along with a timetable for their implementation.

'''Recommendation 1''' – A new Canadian Health Covenant should be established as a common declaration of Canadians’ and their governments’ commitment to a universally accessible, publicly funded health care system. To this end, First Ministers should meet at the earliest opportunity to agree on this Covenant.

'''Recommendation 2''' – A [[Health Council of Canada]] should be established by the provincial, territorial and federal governments to facilitate co-operation and provide national leadership in achieving the best health outcomes in the world. The Health Council should be built on the existing infrastructure of the [[Canadian Institute for Health Information]] (CIHI) and the [[Canadian Coordinating Office of Health Technology Assessment]] (CCOHTA).

'''Recommendation 3''' – On an initial basis, the [[Health Council of Canada]] should: Establish common indicators and measure the performance of the health care system; Establish benchmarks, collect information and report publicly on efforts to improve quality, access and outcomes in the health care system; and coordinate existing activities in health technology assessment and conduct independent evaluations of technologies, including their impact on rural and remote delivery and the patterns of practice for various health care providers.

'''Recommendation 4''' – In the longer term, the Health Council of Canada should provide ongoing advice and coordination in transforming primary health care, developing national strategies for Canada’s health workforce, and resolving disputes under a modernized [[Canada Health Act]].

'''Recommendation 5''' – The [[Canada Health Act]] should be modernized and strengthened by: Confirming the principles of public administration, universality and accessibility, updating the principles of portability and comprehensiveness, and establishing a new principle of accountability; Expanding insured health services beyond hospital and physician services to immediately include targeted home care services followed by prescription drugs in the longer term; Clarifying coverage in terms of diagnostic services; Including an effective dispute resolution process; and Establishing a dedicated health transfer directly connected to the principles and conditions of the [[Canada Health Act]].

'''Recommendation 6''' – To provide adequate funding, a new dedicated cash-only [[Canada Health Transfer]] should be established by the federal government. To provide long-term stability and predictability, the Transfer should include an escalator that is set in advance for five year periods.

'''Recommendation 7''' – On a short-term basis, the federal government should provide targeted funding for the next two years to establish: a new Rural and Remote Access Fund; a new Diagnostic Services Fund; a Primary Health Care Transfer; a Home Care Transfer; and a Catastrophic Drug Transfer

'''Recommendation 8''' – A personal electronic health record for each Canadian that builds upon the work currently underway in provinces and territories.

'''Recommendation 9''' – [[Canada Health Infoway]] should continue to take the lead on this initiative and be responsible for developing a pan-Canadian electronic health record framework built upon provincial systems, including ensuring the interoperability of current electronic health information systems and addressing issues such as security standards and harmonizing privacy policies.

'''Recommendation 10''' – Individual Canadians should have ownership over their personal health information, ready access to their personal health records, clear protection of the privacy of their health records, and better access to comprehensive and credible information about health, health care and the health system.

Dugger|date=2007-05-08|publisher=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rankings are presented in the Mothers’ Index, which has been produced annually since the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.savethechildren.org/site/c.8rKLIXMGIpI4E/b.8585863/k.9F31/State_of_the_Worlds_Mothers.htm] for links to all of the annual SOWM reports.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2014 report focuses on saving mothers and children in humanitarian crises. It finds that over half the 800 maternal and 18,000 child deaths every day take place in fragile settings which are at high risk of conflict and are particularly vulnerable to the effects of natural disasters.&lt;ref name="savethechildren.org"&gt;http://www.savethechildren.org/site/c.8rKLIXMGIpI4E/b.8585863/k.9F31/State_of_the_Worlds_Mothers.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2014 report ranks [[Finland]] the number one place to be a mother. [[Somalia]] in the [[Horn of Africa]] replaced [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (ranking 178th) as the worst place in the world to be a mother. The United States is down one spot from 2013, ranking 31st. Statistics show that 1 in 27 women from the bottom ranking countries will die from pregnancy-related causes. In addition, 1 in 7 children will die before his or her fifth birthday.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://www.savethechildren.org/atf/cf/%7B9def2ebe-10ae-432c-9bd0-df91d2eba74a%7D/SOWM_2014_MOTHERS_INDEX.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

==2014 SOWM Report: Key Findings==

*More than 60 million women and children are in need of humanitarian assistance this year.
*Violence and conflict have uprooted more families than at any time on record.
*Since the Mothers’ Index was launched in 2000, the majority of the bottom 10 countries have been in the midst of, or emerging from, a recent humanitarian emergency.
*Civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has led to horrific abuses against women and children, and claimed more than 5.4 million lives. But less than 10 percent of these deaths have occurred in combat. Most deaths have been due to preventable or treatable causes such as malaria, diarrhea, pneumonia, newborn causes and malnutrition.
*Syria’s civil war has had a devastating impact on mothers and children. At least 1.3 million children and 650,000 women have fled the conflict and become refugees in neighboring countries, while over 9 million people inside Syria are in need of lifesaving humanitarian assistance.
*The Philippines’ resiliency is being tested by more frequent and increasingly severe emergencies. [[Typhoon Haiyan]] on November 8, 2013 was one of the most destructive typhoons to ever hit land. It killed more than 6,000 people, devastated more than 2,000 hospitals and health clinics and destroyed countless health records and computer systems.  
*In the United States, despite the lessons learned from [[Hurricane Katrina]] and other recent disasters, many gaps remain in emergency planning and preparedness. While the conditions facing mothers and children in the U.S. are very different from those in developing or middle-income countries, there are common challenges, including the resilience of health care and other essential services, and the extent to which humanitarian response reaches those mothers and children in greatest need.

==2013 SOWM Report: Key Findings==

An original analysis by Save the Children estimates that within the first month of life, more than 1 million babies could be saved each year with universal access to these products, which cost between 13 cents and $6 each and are ready for rapid scale-up now. The products are: 
* steroid injections for women in preterm labor (to reduce deaths due to premature babies’ breathing problems); 
* resuscitation devices (to save babies who do not breathe at birth); 
* chlorhexidine cord cleansing (to prevent umbilical cord infections); and 
* injectable antibiotics (to treat newborn sepsis and pneumonia).&lt;ref name="savethechildren.org"/&gt;

==2012 SOWM Report: Key Findings==

*Many children in many countries are not getting adequate nutrition during their first 1000 days of life.
*The malnutrition of children is widespread and limits the future success of both children and their countries.
*Malnutrition cannot be solved by economic growth alone.
*Health workers save millions of children.
*The United States has the least favorable environment for breastfeeding mothers (in the industrialized world).
*The top 10 countries in the 2012 SOWM Report are: Norway, Iceland, Sweden, New Zealand, Denmark, Finland, Australia, Belgium, Ireland, Netherlands and UK (tied). 
*The bottom 10 countries (ranked 155-164) in the 2012 SOWM Report are: Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, Sudan, Chad, Eritrea, Mali, Guinea-Bissau, Yemen, Afghanistan, and Niger.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Vital Statistics===
*More than 2.6 million child deaths each year are caused by malnutrition.
*Stunted (bodies and minds have suffered permanent, irreversible damage from malnutrition) children make up approximately 27% of all children globally (or about 171 million).
*Breastfed children in developing countries are a minimum of 6 times more likely to survive in the early months of life than children who are not breastfed.
*Stunting rates at 12 months could be cut by around 20% if all children in the developing world were to receive adequate nutrition and feeding of solid foods with breastfeeding.
*If breastfeeding were practiced optimally, it could prevent approximately 1 million deaths each year. This is because breastfeeding is the single most effective nutrition intervention for saving lives. 
*On average, adults who were malnourished as children can earn an estimated 20% less than those who weren't malnourished as children. 
*Due to the effects of malnutrition in developing countries, losses in GDP can add up to 2-3% annually.
*Malnutrition is estimated to cost $20–$30 billion per year globally.
*Thirty counties have stunting rates of 40% or more.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====Types of Malnutrition====
[[Stunted growth|Stunting]] - Stunting is when a child is too short for their age. It is caused by poor diet and frequent infections. Generally, stunting occurs before the age of 2, with largely irreversible effects. These effects include: delayed motor development, impaired cognitive function, and poor performance in school.
*27% of all children globally are stunted.

[[Wasting]] - Wasting is when a child's weight is too low for their height. Wasting is caused by acute malnutrition. It is a strong predictor of mortality for children under 5 years old. Usually, it is caused by either food shortage or disease.
*10% of all children globally are wasted.

[[Underweight]] - When a child is underweight, the child's weight is too low for their age. Being underweight can mean the child is stunted, wasted or both. Weight is an indicator of short-term undernutrition. A deficit in height (i.e. stunting) is difficult to correct but a deficit in weight (i.e. underweight) can be resolved if nutrition and health are improved later in childhood.
*More than 100 million children are underweight worldwide.
*19% of child deaths are associated with being underweight.

[[Micronutrient deficiency]] - Micronutrient deficiency is when a child is lacking essential vitamins or minerals such as Vitamin A, iron, and zinc. These deficiencies are caused by a long-term lack of nutritious food or they can be caused by infections such as worms.
*10% of all children's deaths are associated with micronutrient deficiencies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====Nutrition in the First 1000 Days====
There are 171 million children (17%) globally who do not have the opportunity to reach their full potential. This is due to not only the physical, but the mental effects of poor nutrition in the earliest months of life. 
*More than 2.6 million children and 100,000 mothers die every year as a result of under nutrition. 
*Poor nutrition can weaken immune systems which can make both children and adults more likely to die of diarrhea or pneumonia. It can also impair the effectiveness of life saving medications. 
*During the critical 1000-day window, good nutrition is crucial to develop a child's cognitive capacity and his or her physical growth.
*1 in 4 of the world's children are chronically malnourished (stunted).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====Children's Wellbeing of the Mother's Index====
Out of 171 countries, Iceland is first and Somalia is last.
*Every child in Iceland enjoys both good education and good health.
*In Somalia, children face the highest risk of death in the world. On average, more than one in six children will die before the age of 5.
*Nearly 1/3 of Somali children are malnourished.
*70% of children in Somalia lack access to safe water.
*Less than 1 in 3 Somali children are enrolled in school and boys outnumber girls almost 2 to 1.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===="Lifesaving Six"====
More than half of the world's children do not have access to the "Lifesaving Six": iron folate, breastfeeding, complementary feeding, vitamin A, zinc, and hygiene. 
*Globally, more than 2 million children's lives could be saved each year if the "Lifesaving Six" could be implemented.
*Malnutrition rates usually peak during the time of complementary feeding.

'''Vitamin A'''
*Approximately 190 million preschool-age children don't get enough vitamin A.
*Approximately 19 million (15%) of pregnant women don't get enough vitamin A.
*Vitamin A deficiencies are a contributing factor each year in 1.3 million deaths due to diarrhea and almost 118,000 deaths from measles.
*Vitamin A deficiencies can lead to partial and total blindness.
*Vitamin A costs 2 cents a dose and could reduce about 2% of child deaths yearly if children were given two doses a year.

'''Zinc'''
*Zinc costs 2 cents a tablet and a full life-saving course of zinc treatment (for diarrhea) would cost less than 30 cents.
*It is estimated that 4% of child deaths could be prevented if diarrhea could be treated with zinc.

'''Hygiene'''
*Washing hands with soap could prevent diarrheal disease and pneumonia, which combined are responsible for 2.9 million child deaths every year. 
*It is estimated that 3% of child deaths could be prevented if children had access to safe drinking water, improved sanitation facilities, and good hygiene (especially hand washing).

'''Breastfeeding'''
*Breastfeeding is the single most effective nutrition intervention for saving the lives of children. It could prevent close to 1 million deaths each year.
*In developing countries, children who are breastfed are at least six times more likely to survive the early months of life that children who are not breastfed.
*It is estimated that in the United States alone, low rates of breastfeeding add $13 billion to medical costs yearly.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==2012 Mothers' Index==
'''Norway''' &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
*In Norway, a skilled health professional is present at virtually every birth.
*Typically, a girl in Norway can expect to receive 18 years of formal education and live to be 83 years of age on average.
*82% of Norwegian women use some method of birth control or other form of contraception.
*In Norway, only 1 in 175 families will lose a child before his or her fifth birthday.

'''Niger''' &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
*In Niger only a third of births are attended by some sort of health personnel. 
*Typically, a girl in Niger can expect to receive only 4 years of education and live to be 56 years of age on average. 
*Only 5% of women in Niger use some method of birth control or other form of contraception.
*In Niger, approximately 1 in 7 children die before his or her fifth birthday. According to these statistics, every mother is likely to lose a child.

==2011 Mothers' Index==
'''Norway''' &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;http://www.savethechildren.org/atf/cf/%7B9def2ebe-10ae-432c-9bd0-df91d2eba74a%7D/SOWM2011_FULL_REPORT.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;
*In Norway, a skilled health professional is present at virtually every birth compared to Afghanistan where only 14% of births are attended.
*Typically, a girl in Norway can expect to receive 18 years of formal education and live to be 83 years of age on average.
*82% of Norwegian women use some method of birth control or other form of contraception.
*In Norway, only 1 in 175 families will lose a child before his or her fifth birthday.

'''Afghanistan''' &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
*In Afghanistan, a woman generally has less than five years of education and will probably not live to be 45 years old.
*Less than 16% of Afghan women use some method of birth control or other form of contraception.
*In Afghanistan, approximately 1 in 5 children die before his or her fifth birthday. According to these statistics, every mother in Afghanistan is likely to lose a child.

==2010 SOWM Report: Key Findings==
*A large number of countries are not able to provide basic health care that could save mothers' and children's lives.
*Female health workers play a critical role in saving the lives of women, newborns, and young children.
*Small investments in female health workers can have a measurable impact on survival rates in more isolated rural communities.
*The most effective health care can begin at home.
*Countries with more front-line female health workers have seen considerable declines in maternal, newborn, and child mortality.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;http://www.savethechildren.org/atf/cf/%7B9def2ebe-10ae-432c-9bd0-df91d2eba74a%7D/SOWM-2010-Women-on-the-Front-Lines-of-Health-Care.pdf?msource=weefuchc0711&lt;/ref&gt;

==2010 Mothers' Index==
'''Norway''' &lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;
*In Norway, a skilled health professional is present at virtually every birth compared to Afghanistan where only 14% of births are attended.
*Typically, a girl in Norway can expect to receive 18 years of formal education and live to be 83 years of age on average.
*82% of Norwegian women use some method of birth control or other form of contraception.
*In Norway, only 1 in 132 families will lose a child before his or her fifth birthday.

'''Afghanistan''' &lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;
*In Afghanistan, a woman generally has a little more than four years of education and will probably live to be around 44 years old.
*Less than 16% of Afghan women use some method of birth control or other form of contraception.
*In Afghanistan, approximately 1 in 4 children die before his or her fifth birthday. According to these statistics, every mother in Afghanistan is likely to lose a child.

==Press coverage==
The reports have been widely covered in the world press, with attention for local strengths and weaknesses. For example, in 2010 ''[[USA Today]]'' focused on the low ranking of the U.S. (28th place, below Estonia, Latvia, and Croatia) due to high rates of maternal and infant mortality, low preschool enrollment, and a particularly weak maternal leave benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2010/05/survey-ranks-norway-best-for-mothers-us-28th/1?csp=34|title=Survey ranks Norway best for mothers, U.S. 28th|author=Michael Winter|date=2010-05-04|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; It quoted the report:&lt;ref&gt;SOWM 2010 report, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; {{quotation|"A woman in the United States is more than five times as likely as a woman in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece or Italy to die from pregnancy-related causes in her lifetime and her risk of maternal death is nearly 10-fold that of a woman in Ireland."}} ''[[ABC News]]'' interviewed physicians and nonprofit leaders who questioned whether global comparisons could be made reliably, due to possible differences in the definition of ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, and abortion statistics. Relevant factors may include lack of health insurance, [[illegal immigration]] by women with poor prenatal care, and maternal obesity statistics. According to Michael Katz, a senior vice president at the [[March of Dimes]] Foundation, "The major question I would ask is, 'Why do African American populations have worse results than the white population?'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/ReproductiveHealth/us-ranks-28th-best-worst-places-mother/story?id=10576232&amp;page=3|title=Where's the Best Place to be a Mom?|date=2010-05-08|publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pravda|Pravda.ru]] and [[Sify]] picked up an [[Indo-Asian News Service|IANS]]/[[EFE]] report focusing on Cuba's rating as the best place to be a mother in the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.pravda.ru/news/world/05-05-2010/113269-motherhood-0|title=Cuba Provides Best Conditions for Motherhood in the World|publisher=Pravda.ru|date=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sify.com/news/cuba-rated-best-place-to-be-a-mother-in-developing-world-news-international-kffhEcadffc.html|title=Cuba rated best place to be a mother in developing world|date=2010-05-05 |author=IANS/EFE|publisher=Sify.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Herald Sun]]'' boasted Australia's second-best placement for mothers, quoting a happy mother about hospital, maternal and child health support, and 12-month workplace maternal leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/we-are-great-for-mothers/story-e6frf7l6-1225862297390?from=public_rss|title=We are great for mothers|author=Marianne Betts|publisher=Herald Sun|date=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''[[Adelaide Advertiser]]'' focused on Australia's lower [28th] ranking on the Children's Index, due in part to a child mortality rate three times higher for aboriginal infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/australia-second-best-country-in-world-to-be-a-mum-report/story-e6frea8c-1225861980491?from=public_rss|title=Australia second best country in world to be a mum - report|author=Edwina Scott|date=2010-05-04|publisher=AdelaideNow}}&lt;/ref&gt; It quoted Save The Children's Annie Pettitt:
{{quotation|An important first step would be to tackle the shortfall of almost 2000 midwives in Australia, especially in remote and rural areas where we know the shortage is greatest.}}
An editorial in the ''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]'' discussed explanations for the Philippine's 48th-place ranking in the second tier. The column attributed much of the problem to a "brain drain", though it described as "much too high" the SOWM report's figure that 85% of Filipino nurses leave to pursue better pay and standards of living overseas. It questioned standards at "[[diploma mill]]s" and called for incentives to bring health professionals into poor communities, while criticizing the chilling effects of a "raid on a training session of health-care workers" as subversives in [[Morong, Rizal]]. The Philippines local chapter of Save the Children produced a ''State of Filipino Mothers'' report in 2008 with rankings by province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/columns/view/20100511-269487/Mothers-and-elections|title=Mothers and elections|author=Michael Tan|date=2010-05-11|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Times of India]]'' lamented India's 73rd of 77th place in the second tier, describing a critical shortage of 74,000 [[accredited social health activist]]s and 21,066 [[auxiliary nurse midwife|auxiliary nurse midwives]] below governmental norms and that thousands of women were dying because they could not access the most basic healthcare facilities or that, if they were available, they were low quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/India-among-worst-places-to-become-a-mother-Survey/articleshow/5887980.cms|title=India among worst places to become a mother: Survey|author=[[Times News Network]] |publisher=The Times of India|date=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though data for some countries are not known with much certainty, the ''SOWM 2010'' report had many findings in common with a recent study published in ''[[The Lancet]]'', which found that 23 of 181 countries are on track to achieve [[Millennium Development Goal]] 5 of a 75% reduction in maternal mortality rate between 1990 and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/the-toughest-kind-of-labour-20100507-ujtn.html |title=The toughest kind of labour|author=[[Jo Chandler]]|date=2005-05-08 |publisher=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60518-1 |pmid=20382417 |title=Maternal mortality for 181 countries, 1980–2008: A systematic analysis of progress towards Millennium Development Goal 5 |journal=The Lancet |volume=375 |issue=9726 |pages=1609–23 |year=2010 |last1=Hogan |first1=Margaret C |last2=Foreman |first2=Kyle J |last3=Naghavi |first3=Mohsen |last4=Ahn |first4=Stephanie Y |last5=Wang |first5=Mengru |last6=Makela |first6=Susanna M |last7=Lopez |first7=Alan D |last8=Lozano |first8=Rafael |last9=Murray |first9=Christopher JL }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
The 2010 report was released by Save the Children in Canada on May 4, 10:00 a.m., as a part of an action directed toward members of Parliament in support of an announcement by [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] that child and maternal health would be the top priority at the [[36th G8 summit]] in [[Huntsville, Ontario]] in June.  As described in the press release:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/April2010/30/c7095.html|title=Media Advisory - A week to save moms and their kids|author=World Vision Canada|publisher=[[CNW Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RobFordCrackHouse.jpg|thumb|upright=2|Photograph given to Gawker and the ''Toronto Star'' providing "[[bonafide]]s" for the video transaction.&lt;br&gt;'''From left to right:''' Anthony Smith, Rob Ford, Monir Kassim and Muhammad Khattak.]]
In May 2013, the American website [[Gawker]] and the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' reported that they had viewed a cellphone video that showed [[Toronto]] Mayor [[Rob Ford]] smoking [[crack cocaine]] and commenting on political issues.  Gawker raised money to buy the video, but were unable to acquire the video when the seller broke off contact. On October 31, 2013, [[Toronto Police Service|Toronto Police]] announced that they were in possession of the video, "and at least one other".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Star Investigations |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2013/10/31/rob_ford_crack_cocaine_scandal_police_photographed_mayor_in_multiple_meetings_with_alleged_drug_dealer.html |title=Rob Ford video scandal: Police have the video that appears to show mayor smoking crack, Blair says|publisher=Toronto Star |date=October 31, 2013 |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thestar2018-09-22/&gt; The video was retrieved in the course of an investigation of drug gangs, entitled "Project Traveller". Ford's associate Sandro Lisi was charged with extortion for attempting to retrieve the video, in exchange for marijuana.

An image was provided to Gawker and ''Toronto Star'' reporters depicting Ford posing with three individuals outside the house where the alleged video was recorded. The individuals standing with Ford were later identified as Anthony Smith, Muhammad Khattak and Monir Kassim, three alleged members of a local gang. The location was later identified as a house on Windsor Road in the [[Etobicoke]] area of Toronto. Khattak and Kassim were both arrested in a sweep of an apartment complex near the home in June 2013. Smith was killed in a shooting on the streets of downtown Toronto in March 2013. The home was identified as the residence of a friend of Ford's from his high school days.&lt;ref name="macleans-dots"/&gt; The home was attacked in a home invasion days after Gawker and the ''Toronto Star'' published the video story.&lt;ref name="macleans-dots"/&gt;

Ford consistently denied the existence of the video, and denied that he uses crack cocaine.

''' The Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition ''' was adopted on 16 November 1974, by governments who attended the 1974 World Food Conference that was convened under General Assembly resolution 3180 (XXVIII) of 17 December 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition|url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/publications/universal-declaration-on-the-eradication-of-hunger-and-malnutrition.htm|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=9 April 2016|author=World Food Conference General Assembly|year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later endorsed by General Assembly resolution 3348 (XXIX), of 17 December 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition|url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/publications/universal-declaration-on-the-eradication-of-hunger-and-malnutrition.htm|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=9 April 2016|author=World Food Conference General Assembly|year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Declaration combined discussions of the ''' international human right''' to adequate food and nutrition with an acknowledgement of the various economic and political issues that can affect the production and distribution of food related products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition|url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/publications/universal-declaration-on-the-eradication-of-hunger-and-malnutrition.htm|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=9 April 2016|author=World Food Conference General Assembly|year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this Declaration, it is recognised that it is the common purpose of all nations to work together towards eliminating [[hunger]] and [[malnutrition]].&lt;ref&gt;Ahluwalia, Pooja (2004) "The Implementation of the Right to Food at the National Level: A Critical Examination of the Indian Campaign on the Right to Food as an Effective Operationalization of Article 11 of ICESCR", Centre for Human Rights and Global Justice Working Paper No. 8, 2004: 12. NYU School of Law, New York&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the Declaration explains how the welfare of much of the world’s population depends on their ability to adequately produce and distribute food. In doing so, it emphasises the need for the international community to develop a more adequate system to ensure that the right to food for all persons is recognised. The opening paragraph of the Declaration, which remains to be the most recited paragraph of the Declaration today, reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“Every man, woman and child has the inalienable right to be free from hunger and malnutrition in order to develop fully and maintain their physical and mental faculties.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/malnutrition.htm|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=18 June 2012|author=World Food Conference General Assembly|year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition affirmed that it is a fundamental [[human right]] to be free from hunger and malnutrition, so that one can develop both their mental and physical faculties fully. This Declaration arose out of ever-growing concerns regarding worldwide [[famine]], and in doing so, stressed that every country that is in a position to be able to assist developing nations to gain access to more, better quality food, has the responsibility to ensure that this right to food is realized.

==History==

===Precursors===
The prevalence of hunger and malnutrition is an issue that has long been of international concern. Although it has been accepted that obtaining exact statistics regarding world hunger is difficult, it is believed that in the early 1960s, there were approximately 900 million undernourished individuals worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Jason|title=World Hunger Statistics|url=http://www.povertyliving.com/2013/05/world-hunger-statistics/|website=Poverty Living|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of these individuals were located in developing nations such as Africa, Asia and Latin America. It is believed that today, one in every nine individuals do not have an adequate access to food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=World Food Programme|title=Hunger|url=https://www.wfp.org/hunger|website=World Food Programme|accessdate=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hunger and malnutrition have now been identified as the cause of more deaths worldwide than AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stop Hunger Now|title=Hunger Facts|url=http://www.stophungernow.org/learn/hunger-facts/|website=Stop Hunger Now.|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today it is estimated that there are approximately 1.02 billion people across the world living in conditions of extreme hunger, 1 billion of whom live in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=International Human Rights Clinic|title=End Hunger Through Law: An International Food Security Treaty|url=https://willamette.edu/law/pdf/clp/FinalEndHungerByLawEHTL5-8-10.pdf|website=Willamette University College of Law for the International Food Security Treaty Campaign|accessdate=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hunger and malnutrition have been of growing concern throughout the international community, despite a number of intervention attempts from the likes of States and non-government organisations. The right to food, for example, was asserted in the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]](UDHR), and was again recognised in 1966 through Article 11 of the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]].

Leading up to the drafting and formation of the Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition, the international community as a whole was becoming increasingly aware of the severity of the worldwide issue of hunger and malnutrition, and identified an immediate need for some form of action to combat this. This growing concern was an important factor leading to the first [[World Food Conference]] convening in Rome in 1974&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Langley|first1=Winston|title=Encyclopedia of Human Rights Since 1945|date=1999|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=Connecticut|page=303|accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to uncover an adequate solution in order to combat this issue.

===Adoption===
Representatives from 135 countries attended the 1974 World Food Conference where this Declaration was adopted. As well as these State representatives, a number of libertarian movements, [[United Nations]] bodies and [[intergovernmental organisations]] were also present at this Conference. Representatives from the following countries were present for the formation of the Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the World Food Conference|url=http://www.gloobal.net/iepala/gloobal/fichas/ficha.php?entidad=Textos&amp;id=5197&amp;opcion=documento|website=Gloobal|accessdate=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{columns-list|colwidth=20em|

==Structure==
The Declaration in itself is 12 paragraphs. Many of these paragraphs have now been elaborated on in subsequent international human rights treaties and regional human rights instruments. Throughout these paragraphs, the intended purposes, functions and goals of this Declaration are set out. A number of these paragraphs are worth further consideration. 
*Paragraph A) brings attention to the grave nature of the international food crisis, and highlights the vast imbalance between the resources found in developing countries and those found in developed countries.  
*Paragraph C) recognises that this international food crises arose from various historical circumstances, such as colonisation and racial discrimination.
*Paragraph D) expands on this point about historical circumstances and discusses how recent international economic crises have worked to further prolong and aggravate this problem. 
*Paragraph F) recognises that all countries, regardless of their size, population or economic status must be considered equal. 
*Paragraph I) identifies that any lasting solution to this food crises is also going to need to attempt to decrease the ever-growing gap between developed and developing countries, in order to bring about a “new international economic order."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition|url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/publications/universal-declaration-on-the-eradication-of-hunger-and-malnutrition.htm|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=9 April 2016|author=World Food Conference General Assembly|year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Paragraph K) of the Declaration recognises that developing countries are not always able to meet the food requirements of their people of their own merits, and therefore acknowledges that urgent and effective action needs to be taken by the international community, and this should be free from political pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition|url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/publications/universal-declaration-on-the-eradication-of-hunger-and-malnutrition.htm|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=9 April 2016|author=World Food Conference General Assembly|year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The Declaration itself identifies that the key purpose in its adoption was to develop more adequate means for the international community as a whole, to take action to resolve the world hunger problem. It was further outlined that this Declaration was adopted to encourage and further develop international economic co-operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition|url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/publications/universal-declaration-on-the-eradication-of-hunger-and-malnutrition.htm|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=9 April 2016|author=World Food Conference General Assembly|year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, this Declaration sought to develop a series of ways that the international community in its entirety, could work towards combatting, and ultimately overcoming, the growing issue of hunger and malnutrition. This Declaration highlighted the urgency of attending to this matter and called for rapid and sustained action to bring an end to this menacing problem of world hunger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nanda|first1=Vep|title=The World Food Crisis and the Role of Law in Combating Hunger and Malnutrition|journal=International Law and Economics|date=1975|volume=10|page=725}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another crucial reason underlying the adoption of this Declaration was the need to remind the world’s population that freedom from hunger, and the right to food, is an inalienable human right that needs to be protected. It also sought to remind the world that the access to adequate food is an essential factor in the full development of an individual’s physical and mental faculties.

In 2014, the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations recognised that the Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition was one of the key non-binding human rights instruments in relation to the right to food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Food and Agriculture Organization|title=The Right to Food Within the International Framework of Human Rights and Country Constitutions|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3448e.pdf|website=Food and Agriculture Organization|accessdate=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A non-binding international instrument such as this Declaration outlines the guidelines and principles, imposing moral, but not legal, obligations on party states. The United Nations, in its description of the purpose of a Declaration, stated that the intention here is not to create binding obligations to be enforced on states, but rather to declare certain aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=United Nations Treaty Collection|title=Definitions of Key Terms Used in the UN Treaty Collection|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/overview.aspx?path=overview/definition/page1_en.xml#declarations|website=United Nations Treaty Collection|accessdate=April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520185430/https://treaties.un.org/Pages/Overview.aspx?path=overview%2Fdefinition%2Fpage1_en.xml#declarations|archive-date=2015-05-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although states whom are party to a Declaration of this kind are not legally bound, non-binding Declarations are well accepted to be crucial in the development of international human rights law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Food and Agriculture Organization|title=The Right to Food Within the International Framework of Human Rights and Country Constitutions|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3448e.pdf|website=Food and Agriculture Organization|accessdate=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This Declaration has been crucial in the growing knowledge, support and aid of food and agriculture to developing nations. Research has identified that the number of people across the world who are chronically malnourished has decreased by 167 million over the past decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stop Hunger Now|title=Hunger Facts|url=http://www.stophungernow.org/learn/hunger-facts/|website=Stop Hunger Now|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1996 the World Food Summit called for the need for a 50% reduction in the amount of malnourished people by the year 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stop Hunger Now|title=Hunger Facts|url=http://www.stophungernow.org/learn/hunger-facts/|website=Stop Hunger Now|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a goal that was not achieved. Because of this, a number of human rights advocates such as the United Nations and the World Food Summit have since been calling for further action in the attempt to end this crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=International Human Rights Clinic|title=End Hunger Through Law: An International Food Security Treaty|url=https://willamette.edu/law/pdf/clp/FinalEndHungerByLawEHTL5-8-10.pdf|website=Willamette University College of Law for the International Food Security Treaty Campaign|accessdate=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These organisations now believe that the best way to bring an end to this crisis is through the implementation of enforceable international laws that guarantee the right for people to be free from hunger. Such organisations believe that the international community needs to create some enforceable legal document such as an International Food Security Treaty&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=International Human Rights Clinic|title=End Hunger Through Law: An International Food Security Treaty|url=https://willamette.edu/law/pdf/clp/FinalEndHungerByLawEHTL5-8-10.pdf|website=Willamette University College of Law for the International Food Security Treaty Campaign|accessdate=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that ensures the right to food is recognised, and imposes obligations on countries to develop their own national law on the issue.

'''Water management in Dhaka''', the capital of [[Bangladesh]] and a city with 20 million inhabitants, faces numerous challenges such as flooding, poor service quality, [[Overdrafting|groundwater depletion]], inadequate sanitation, polluted river water, unplanned urban development, and the existence of large slums where more than one third of its population lives. Residents of Dhaka enjoy one of the lowest water tariffs in the world, which limits the utility's capacity to invest. The utility in charge of water and sanitation in [[Dhaka]], DWASA, addresses these challenges with a number of measures. It says that in 2011 it achieved a continuous water supply 24 hours per day 7 days a week, an increase in revenues so that operating costs are more than covered, and a reduction of water losses from 53% in 2003 to 29% in 2010.&lt;ref name=Khan&gt;Taqsem Khan:The performance challenges of Dhaka WASA, in Global Water Intelligence:Focusing on performance, Global Water Summit 2011, p. 50-52.&lt;/ref&gt; For these achievements DWASA, got a "Performer of the Year Award" at the Global Water Summit 2011 in Berlin.&lt;ref name=Award&gt;{{cite news |date=26 April 2011 |title=Wasa awarded for improved management |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=183276 |newspaper=The Daily Star |location=Dhaka |accessdate=13 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the future DWASA plans massive investment to replace dwindling groundwater resources with treated surface water from less polluted rivers located up to 160&amp;nbsp;km from the city.&lt;ref name=Khan/&gt; In 2011 Bangladesh's capital development authority, [[Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha]], made rainwater harvesting for new houses mandatory in an effort to address [[water scarcity]] and reduce flooding.&lt;ref name="Rainwater harvesting"/&gt;

[[Image:Baridhara DOHS during 2004 flood.JPG|250px|thumb|A street in Dhaka during a flood in 2004]]

==History==
The first piped drinking water system in Dhaka was established in 1874 by [[Khwaja Abdul Ghani]], the aristocrat that ruled Dhaka under the British colonial authorities. The system was fed by a [[water treatment plants|water treatment plant]] in Chadnighat near the bank of the river [[Buriganga]]. After independence from the British in 1948 the Department of Public Health Engineering of the Pakistani government was in charge of drinking water supply as well as sanitary sewers and storm-water drainage. Dhaka WASA (Water Supply &amp; Sewerage Authority) was established in 1963. In 1989, the storm-water drainage system of Dhaka city was handed over to DWASA. In 1990, the service area was extended to include [[Narayanganj]] city. In the early 1990s the [[World Bank]] had said it would only provide a loan for water supply in Dhaka if the utility would enter into a [[water privatization|public-private partnership]] with an international water company. When this was rejected, it asked that revenue billing and collection should be outsourced to a private company for at least one service area on a pilot basis, and that DWASA should be transformed into a commercially oriented utility.&lt;ref name="Water Commons"/&gt; The outsourcing in one service area was done in 1997, but the pilot project was not deemed successful and was stopped. DWASA's activities have been reorganised by the Dhaka WASA Act, 1996 that transformed DWASA into a service-oriented commercial organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DWASA|title=History|url=http://www.dwasa.org.bd/index.php?type_name=visitor&amp;page_name=history&amp;panel_index=1019 |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BD Map Central Bangladesh.jpg|thumb|[[Dhaka]] lies on the banks of the [[Buriganga River]] in central Bangladesh.]]

==Service area==
The service area of DWASA covers more than 360 square km with a population of about 12 million. It extends from [[Mirpur Thana|Mirpur]] and [[Uttara (Dhaka)|Uttara]] in the North to [[Narayanganj]] in the South. Buriganga river and many canals flow through the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DWASA|title=Dhaka Water Supply and Sewer Authority|url=http://www.dwasa.org.bd/index.php |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tropical vegetation and moist soils characterise the land, which is flat. The elevation of Greater Dhaka is 2 to 13 meters above the mean sea level, and most of the urbanised areas are at elevation of 6 to 8 metres. This leaves Dhaka susceptible to flooding during the [[monsoon]] seasons owing to heavy rainfall and [[cyclone]]s.&lt;ref name=Huq&gt;{{cite web|title=Flood Management and Vulnerability of Dhaka City|url=http://www.bvsde.paho.org/bvsacd/cd46/cap9-flood.pdf|work=Alcira Kreimer; Margaret Arnold and Anne Carlin (eds.) Building Safer Cities: The Future of Disaster  Risk|publisher=World Bank |author=Saleemul Huq|author2=Mozaharul Ala |pages=121–135|year=2003 |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
Water management in Dhaka faces numerous challenges such as flooding, poor service quality, groundwater depletion, inadequate sanitation, polluted river water, unplanned urban development, and the existence of large slums where more than one third of its population lives. Every year during the dry season, people demonstrate in Dhaka's streets demanding an uninterrupted supply of clean water. In 2010, Bangladesh's government had to even deploy troops to guard water pumps following angry protests.&lt;ref name="Rainwater harvesting"/&gt;

===Flooding===
{{See also|Floods in Bangladesh}}
Bangladesh has been repeatedly exposed to severe flooding. Dhaka was particularly hit by the floods of 1970, 1974, 1980, 1987, 1988, 1996, 1998, 2004, 2007 and 2009, some of which such as the ones in 1988 and 1998 were catastrophic with flood levels of up to 4.5m in parts of the city.  During the 1998 flood about 56 percent of the city was inundated, including most of the eastern and 23 percent of the western parts of the city.&lt;ref name=Huq/&gt; During non-catastrophic floods some streets are inundated for up to 60&amp;nbsp;cm for several days. Flooding in Dhaka is caused by high rainfall in the city and/or by flooding from the surrounding rivers and canals. The western and most densely settled part of Dhaka is protected from river flooding by raised roads and an encircling embankment built after the 1988 flood. The eastern part of the city where most of the expansion takes place consists of low-lying floodplains that are submerged during the monsoon season.&lt;ref name=Huq/&gt; When high rainfall coincides with a high water level in the river, stormwater cannot be naturally evacuated through the drainage system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Modelling of Urban Flooding in Dhaka City|url=http://www.dhigroup.com/upload/publications/mouse/Apirumanekul_Modelling_of_Urban.pdf|work=4 th DHI Software Conference |author=Chusit Apirumanekul|author2=Ole Mark |pages=102|year=2001 |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Retention areas are supposed to mitigate flooding and pumping stations have been set up to evacuate floodwater. However, encroachment of natural runoff detention areas, lack of maintenance of storm sewers and pumps, and a lack of co-ordination among responsible organisations hamper efforts at flood management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=M. Shah Alam Khan|title=Stormwater Flooding in Dhaka City: Causes and Management|url=http://teacher.buet.ac.bd/diriwfm/flood/doc/Abstract_StormwaterFloodingDhaka.pdf|publisher=Institute of Water and Flood Management, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Dhaka |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four organisations are in charge of various aspects of stormwater management in Dhaka: The Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) is in charge of operating regulators and gates in the embankment; DWASA is in charge of the larger open drainage canals and pipes; [[Dhaka City Corporation]] (DCC) operates smaller underground and surface drains; and the [[Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha|Capital Development Authority]] (RAJUK) constructs underground roadside drainage lines during the construction of new roads. Stormwater pumping stations of various sizes are operated by BWDB, DWASA and the Dkaha City Corporation. After the catastrophic 1998 flood caused by high river levels, it turned out that there was neither an operating policy nor person assigned to operate an important regulator, the Rampura Regulator. Many gates that were supposed to be closed to keep the water from the rising rivers out had not been closed.&lt;ref name=Huq/&gt; Furthermore, in 2002 it was noted that the existing earthen embankment was unstable and cracking in large sections. Also, construction of embankments through low-lying areas without providing adequate drainage facilities had caused internal flooding.

===Poor service quality===
According to background information for a representative survey conducted for the [[Asian Development Bank]] in 2005, out of the 12 million inhabitants of Dhaka, the Dhaka water utility provided drinking water for 9&amp;nbsp;million through house connections, as well as for an additional 600,000 through 1700 standpipes and 100,000 through bulk connections. Bulk connections are located in slums and are known as "Water Points". NGOs are responsible for the installation, operation, maintenance as well as collection of revenues from these connections.&lt;ref name="ADB survey"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adb.org/water/Tools/pdf/Dhaka-Assessment-FULL.pdf |title=Dhaka Water Services Survey |date=October 2005 |website=Asian Development Bank |pages=5–6 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100708002642/http://www.adb.org/Water/Tools/pdf/Dhaka-Assessment-FULL.pdf |archive-date=8 July 2010 |access-date=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 39% of the residential customers surveyed reported having a continuous water supply. On average, customers received water 15 hours per day. 75% of residential and 85% of non-residential customers reported that they had water storage facilities at their premises. 62% of residential customers reported their water quality as good or fair, i.e. not smelly or dirty. Only 10% of residential customers reported drinking water directly from the tap. By far the most common treatment method was boiling. 75% of the domestic and 64% of the non-domestic households were willing to pay more for better services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adb.org/water/Tools/pdf/Dhaka-Assessment-FULL.pdf |title=Dhaka Water Services Survey |date=October 2005 |website=Asian Development Bank |pages=13–22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100708002642/http://www.adb.org/Water/Tools/pdf/Dhaka-Assessment-FULL.pdf |archive-date=8 July 2010 |access-date=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of the survey note a number of discrepancies between utility data and the results of the survey. The utility indicated at the time that 70% of its customers had continuous supply, that 63% had meters and that 97% of meters were in working condition. However, the survey indicated that 42% had continuous supply, that 76% were metered and that only 77% of meters were in working condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adb.org/water/Tools/pdf/Dhaka-Assessment-FULL.pdf |title=Dhaka Water Services Survey |date=October 2005 |website=Asian Development Bank |page=30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100708002642/http://www.adb.org/Water/Tools/pdf/Dhaka-Assessment-FULL.pdf |archive-date=8 July 2010 |access-date=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Groundwater overexploitation===
[[File:Dhaka-bangla-port.jpg|thumb|Although Dhaka is located on the banks of the [[Buriganga River]], only 18% of its drinking water supply comes from surface water because it is highly polluted.]]
82% of the city's water supply is abstracted from [[groundwater]] through 577 deep tube wells, while four relatively small surface water treatment plants provide the remaining 18%.&lt;ref name="Haq 296"&gt;{{cite journal

===Inadequate sanitation===
In Dhaka, nearly one third of domestic effluents does not receive any kind of treatment. About 38% of the population is covered by a sewerage system.&lt;ref name=Khan/&gt; There is one wastewater treatment plant with a capacity of 120,000 m³ per day. About 30% of the population uses conventional [[septic tank]]s and another 15% uses bucket and pit [[latrine]]s. During the rainy season, sewage overflows are common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Other issues==
===Low tariffs and cost recovery===
Residents of Dhaka enjoy one of the lowest water tariffs in the world. The Executive Head of DWASA lists provision of water at low cost as one of the achievements of the utility. However, low revenues limit the utility's capacity to make a higher contribution to investments.&lt;ref name=Khan/&gt;

According to DWASA's official website, in November 2011 the metered residential tariff was 6.6 Taka (US$0.09) per cubic meter. For households with sewer connections the tariff was 15.5 Taka (US$0.21) per cubic meter. Unmetered residential water connections were billed 128 Takas (US$1.72) per month. The commercial, industrial and institutional tariffs are more than three times higher.&lt;ref name="DWASA"&gt;DWASA:[http://www.dwasa.org.bd Water tariffs], retrieved on 17 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Total revenues were the equivalent of about US$70&amp;nbsp;million per annum in 2010 and, according to DWASA management, cover about 25% more than the operating costs of the utility (operating ratio of 0.79).&lt;ref name=Khan/&gt;

However, a recent study shows that for domestic water use slum dwellers in Dhaka Metropolitan Area are paying about 7 to 14 times higher than the legal connection holders covered by DWASA. Slum dwellers are spending about 12 to 15% of their average monthly income for domestic water supply, whereas in most of the countries, legal connection holders are spending less than 5% of their average monthly income for the same purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Muhammad Mizanur Rahaman, Tahmid Saif Ahmed|title=Affordable Water Pricing for Slums Dwellers in Dhaka Metropolitan Area: The Case of Three Slums|journal=Journal of Water Resource Engineering and Management|date=2016|volume=3|issue=1|page=15-33|url=http://stmjournals.com/tech/index.php?journal=JoWREM&amp;page=article&amp;op=view&amp;path%5B%5D=1350|accessdate=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overstaffing===
[[File:Dhaka (62).JPG|thumb|In Dhaka a single water connection often serves an entire high-rise building.]]
A common indicator of whether water utilities are overstaffed is the ratio of employees per 1,000 connections. Using this indicator, DWASA appears to be overstaffed: According to DWASA, the utility had 3,566 employees and served 325,717 connections in 2013, resulting in 10.9 employees per 1,000 connections.&lt;ref name="AnnualReport2012-2013"&gt;{{cite web

  | date = 2013

Thus, for a city of 12&amp;nbsp;million the utility is not necessarily overstaffed.&lt;ref name="Haq 296"/&gt; For example, the city of Berlin, Germany, also had 3,948 employees in 2009, but served less than 4&amp;nbsp;million people.&lt;ref&gt;Joerg Simon, Berliner Wasserbetriebe: Delivering performance amidst austerity, in:Global Water Summit 2011, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Given low salaries in Bangladesh, it is also appropriate to use more labour-intensive approaches than in richer countries, and the staffing level should thus probably not be considered to be overly high.

==Achievements and response to challenges==
In 2010 the Dhaka water utility, DWASA, embarked on a "Turnaround Plan" for the period 2010–12. The Turnaround Plan includes capacity building, more transparency and accountability, and better customer orientation. According to the Executive Head of DWASA, as of early 2011 achievements are a continuous water supply 24 hours per day 7 days a week, an increase in revenues so that operating costs are more than covered, and a reduction of water losses.&lt;ref name="Khan"/&gt; For these achievements DWASA, got a "Performer of the Year Award" at the Global Water Summit 2011 in Berlin, an event organised by an industry magazine. The award selection was made by participants based on presentations by the managers of seven invited utilities from Algeria, Bangladesh, Brazil, Poland, Romania and the United States.&lt;ref name=Award/&gt;

===Water loss reduction===
In Dhaka, the share of [[Non-revenue water|non-revenue water (NRW)]], water which is not billed, e.g., due to leakage and illegal connections, has been reduced substantially. According to DWASA, system losses have been reduced from 36% in 2007–08 to 27% in 2012–13. Their goal is to continue reducing system loss by two percent per year.&lt;ref name="AnnualReport2012-2013" /&gt; The average level of NRW in 17 other major Asian cities, as estimated by the ADB in 2004, was 34%.&lt;ref name="Asian Cities 3"&gt;{{cite journal

===Improved billing and customer service===
DWASA introduced a computerised billing system including the ability of customers to pay bills via SMS. Through this system and other measures revenues increased by 20% in a year and a half from 2009 on,&lt;ref name=Khan/&gt; while tariffs went up by only about 5% in July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DWASA|title=Water tariff:Metered connections|url=http://www.dwasa.org.bd/index.php?type_name=tariff&amp;panel_index=601 |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DWASA has eleven revenue zones. It sets a zone-wide annual target for billing, collection and reduction of non-revenue water. In at least three revenue zones utility staff are in charge of billing and collection directly, while in the other revenue zones this is done by an employees' cooperative, the Employees' Consumers Supplies Cooperative Society Ltd. (ECSCSL), under contract with the utility. Most of the workers at ECSCSL are seconded from Dhaka WASA. They receive salaries that are up to three times higher than at Dhaka WASA. Non-performing employees can be sent back to Dhaka WASA and ECSCSL can recruit new employees on its own. Workers also undertake water connections in informal houses, which Dhaka WASA rules do not normally permit.

The system was introduced in 1997 in the context of privatisation efforts (see history section) which were opposed by employees. It was thus decided that one zone would be privatised and another one would be given to the employees' cooperative, experimentally, for one year. The private company and ECSCSL started in September 1997. In 1998 a monitoring committee found that ECSCSL had out-performed the private company in revenue collection increases and [[non-revenue water]] reductions. Subsequently, Dhaka WASA asked ECSCSL to take over two more of its revenue zones. The cooperative made sure that consumers receive bills monthly rather than bimonthly. The Cooperative has met its contractual targets every year. However, an independent study conducted in 2004 found that Dhaka WASA tends to choose deliberately low financial targets in the Cooperative zones. Moreover, the cost of revenue collection in the cooperative zones has almost doubled.&lt;ref name="Water Commons"&gt;[http://www.ourwatercommons.org/about-us Our Water Commons]:[http://www.ourwatercommons.org/water-solutions/case-12-employee-cooperatives-water-case-dhaka-wasa Water Solutions – Case 12: Employee Cooperatives in Water: The Case of Dhaka WASA], retrieved on 7 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaching the poor===
A project provided water to hitherto unserved slum areas through community-based organisations with the assistance of the NGO Dushtha Shasthya Kendra (DSK) and [[WaterAid]] from the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/mdgs-in-focus-mdg-4-reduce-child-mortality |title=MDGs in focus – MDG 4: Reduce child mortality: How a slum community in Bangladesh has improved access to clean water and sanitation and reduced killer diseases |date=7 September 2010 |website=Department for International Development (DFID)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jacobs |first=Bel |date=20 March 2008 |title=Slums top water agenda |url=http://www.wateraid.org/documents/metro_march_20__2008.pdf |newspaper=Metro |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205063954/http://www.wateraid.org/documents/metro_march_20__2008.pdf |archive-date=5 February 2009 |access-date=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the utility refused to provide water connections, saying that slum dwellers would not be able or not be willing to pay water bills. DSK, which knew the community-based organisations in the slums well due to its previous work on health issues there, gave financial guarantees in case the community failed to pay. On that basis, the utility provided water points. The communities paid their bills on time, so that the guarantee never had to be called. From 2008 onwards, the utility provided water points to the slums without requiring a guarantee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Albuquerque|first=Catarina|title=On the Right Track.

A pilot project for a [[simplified sewerage|small-bore sewer system]] in the Mirpur area of Dhaka was implemented several years ago, with financing from the Asian Development Bank.  This scheme was never commissioned and is now completely non-functional.

==Plans==
===Developing surface water===
The utility plans to substitute surface water for groundwater through the construction of four large water treatment plants until 2020 at a cost of US$1.8bn (Saidabad Phase II and III, Padma/Pagla and Khilkhet). The treatment plants will draw water from more distant and less polluted rivers up to 160&amp;nbsp;km from the city. The four plants are expected to have a combined capacity of 1.63&amp;nbsp;million cubic meters per year, compared to a 2010 supply of 2.11&amp;nbsp;million cubic meter per year that is mainly from groundwater. As of 2011, funding had been secured for the first plant which is under construction thanks to a USD250&amp;nbsp;million contribution from Danish development assistance.&lt;ref name=Khan/&gt; In 2012 the government signed a contract with a Chinese company to build a water treatment plant at [[Munshiganj]] on the Padma River. The project costs USD407&amp;nbsp;million, of which USD290.8&amp;nbsp;million is financed by a soft loan from the Chinese government, the remainder coming from the Bangladeshi government.&lt;ref&gt;OOSKAnews, 19 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Promotion of rainwater harvesting===
To alleviate the water scarcity, in 2011 the city of Dhaka announced it would amend its building code to require rooftop [[rainwater harvesting]] systems in new buildings. The measure aims to address the city's worsening water shortages and curb drops in groundwater levels. Collecting rainwater also will help avoid flooding problems in Dhaka during the monsoon season.&lt;ref name="Rainwater harvesting"/&gt;

==Corporate governance==
DWASA is under the authority of the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives. DWASA's Board consists of 13 members and is chaired by a customer representative. The Ministry is represented by a Joint Secretary from the Local Government Division. Two board members are appointed by the municipal authority and one by the Minister of Finance. The Executive Head of DWSASA is also an ex officio member of the Board. Other Board members are appointed by professional associations and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DWASA|title=Members of Dhaka WASA Board|url=http://www.dwasa.org.bd/index.php?type_name=visitor&amp;page_name=member&amp;panel_index=1017 |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Album of 18 Daoist Paintings - 14.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Zhang Lu (painter)|Zhang Lu]]'s painting of Zhongli Quan, early 16th century]]
'''Zhongli Quan''' ({{zh|t=鐘離權|s=钟离权|p=Zhōnglí Quán|w=Chung-li Chüan}}), [[courtesy name]] '''Jidao''' ({{zh|c=寂道|p=Jìdào|w=Chi-tao}}), is a [[Chinese mythology|Chinese mythological]] figure and one of the [[Eight Immortals]] in the [[Taoism|Taoist]] pantheon. He is also known as '''Han Zhongli''' ({{zh|t=漢鍾離|s=汉钟离|p=Hàn Zhōnglí|w=Han Chung-Li}}) because he was said to have been born in the [[Han dynasty]]. In legend, he wields a large [[Fan (implement)|fan]] which can resurrect the dead and transform stones into silver or gold.

==Life==
[[File:Zhongli Quan Seeking the Dao.jpg|thumb|The painting ''Zhongli Quan Seeking the Dao'', 15th century]]
[[File:Östasiatisk keramik. Helgonet ZhongliQuan - Hallwylska museet - 95629.tif|thumb|Porcelain figure of Zhongli Quan decorated in underglaze cobalt blue, Wanli period (1573-1620), Ming dynasty, [[Hallwyl Museum]], Sweden]] 
Zhongli was born in [[Yanjing]]. According to legend, bright beams of light filled the labour room during his birth. After he was born, he did not stop crying until seven full days had passed. He was destined for greatness from the day he was born by showing features such as a broad forehead, thick ears, long eyebrows, deep eyes, red nose, square mouth, high cheeks, and scarlet lips. Stories depict that either seven days or seven years later, he began to speak, and the first sentence he uttered was, “my feet have wandered in the purple palace of the [immortals], my name is recorded in the capital of the jade emperor." Later Taoists celebrate his birthday on the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the [[Chinese calendar]]. Following his father's example, he became a member of the court, advancing to be general of one of the armies of the [[Han dynasty]]. During his time as a general, his army fought against Tibet. In his last battle he was beaten by the Tibetans, forcing him to flee into the mountainous areas surrounding him. There he came across an old man who led him to a spiritual sanctuary where he was welcomed in and told that he could stay as long as was needed. There he learned the ways of the immortal rituals and extensive amounts of alchemy. After three hard days of teaching, he was dismissed and told to use his newfound powers to serve his people. When he turned back to talk to the man, he and his home had vanished. Using his power of alchemy and his magical fan, he created silver and gold coins from stones and saved people from poverty and famine.

There are two stories that depict how he became one of the immortals. In the first, it was in his continuous use of the immortal powers and his magical fan that eventually caused his descent into the shimmering cloud of the immortals. In the second, he was meditating near a wall of his hermitage when all of a sudden it collapsed. Behind the wall was a jade vessel that took him as an immortal to the shimmering cloud.

In Taoism, he is known as "Zhengyang Zushi" ({{zh|t=正陽祖師|s=正阳祖师|p=Zhèngyáng Zǔshī}}), literally "True-[[yin and yang|Yang]] Ancestor-Master". He is also called "Master of the Cloud-Chamber" ({{zh|t=雲房先生|s=云房先生|p=Yúnfáng Xiānshēng}}) in accounts describing his encounter with [[Lü Dongbin]] before achieving immortality.

==Depiction==
Usually depicted with his chest and belly bare and holding a fan made of feathers or horse hair, Zhongli is often set apart from the other immortals in pictures by wisps of hair on his temples and a beard down to his navel. He is known for his pleasing disposition, and is often painted or drawn drinking wine.

==Modern depiction==
In the television show ''[[Jackie Chan Adventures]]'', Zhongli was shown to be the Immortal who sealed away [[List of Jackie Chan Adventures characters#Xiao Fung|Xiao Fung, The Wind Demon]].
