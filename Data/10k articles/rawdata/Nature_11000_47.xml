'''Alain Colas''' (16 September 1943 – 16 November 1978)) was a French sailor, the first to complete a solitary round-the-world race in a multihull.&lt;ref name="CapHornHommeSeul"&gt;{{cite book|last=Colas|first=Alain|title=Cap Horn pour un homme seul|year=1977|publisher=Flammarion|location=[Paris]|isbn=978-2080650092}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Colas|first=Alain|title=Cap Horn pour un homme seul|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HTgNAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=alain+colas&amp;dq=alain+colas&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=usSMUfX3FtOUhQem04HACw&amp;redir_esc=y|accessdate=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He met [[Éric Tabarly]] in [[Sydney]] in 1967, and bought [[Manureva|Pen Duick IV]] from him in 1970, and won the [[Single-Handed Trans-Atlantic Race|"Transat"]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Colas|first=Alain|title=Un tour du monde pour une victoire|year=2003|publisher=Arthaud|location=Paris|isbn=978-2700395969|edition=Nouv. éd.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, he started the construction of a 72m (236 feet) 4 masted monohull for the 1976 [[Single-Handed Trans-Atlantic Race|"Transat"]].&lt;ref name="CapHornHommeSeul" /&gt; He broke his right ankle, underwent 22 surgeries, and got back on his feet for the solitary transatlantic race.

{{Anti-nuclear movement sidebar}}
More than 80 [[anti-nuclear]] groups are operating, or have operated, in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Many of these groups are listed at "Protest movements against nuclear energy" in Wolfgang Rudig (1990). ''Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy'', Longman, pp. 381–403.&lt;/ref&gt; These include [[Abalone Alliance]], [[Clamshell Alliance]], [[Greenpeace|Greenpeace USA]],  [[Institute for Energy and Environmental Research]], [[Musicians United for Safe Energy]], [[Nevada Desert Experience]], [[Nuclear Control Institute]], [[Nuclear Information and Resource Service]], [[Public Citizen|Public Citizen Energy Program]], [[Shad Alliance]], and the [[Sierra Club]]. These are [[direct action]], environmental, health, and public interest organizations who oppose [[nuclear weapons]] and/or [[nuclear power]]. In 1992, the chairman of the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] said that "his agency had been pushed in the right direction on safety issues because of the pleas and protests of nuclear watchdog groups".&lt;ref&gt;Matthew L. Wald. [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/23/us/nuclear-agency-s-chief-praises-watchdog-groups.html?pagewanted=1 Nuclear Agency's Chief Praises Watchdog Groups], ''The New York Times'', June 23, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most influential groups in the anti-nuclear movement have had members who included Nobel Laureates (e.g., [[Linus Pauling]] and [[Hermann Joseph Muller]]). These scientists have belonged primarily to two groups: the [[Federation of American Scientists]], and the [[Committee for Nuclear Responsibility]].&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Price (1982).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5677">'''Aspersion''' ([[Latin|la.]] ''aspergere/aspersio''), in a [[religious]] context, is the act of sprinkling with [[water]], especially [[holy water]]. Aspersion is a method used in [[baptism]] as an alternative to immersion or [[affusion]]. The word is formed of the [[Latin]] ''aspergere'', 'to sprinkle', of ''ad'', 'to', and ''spargo'', 'I scatter' ({{bibleverse||Ezekiel|36:25-26|KJV}}, 1 Corinthians 10:2, cf. Psalm 77:16-20).

In addition, aspersion is performed as part of certain rites to remind people of their baptism, such as the renewal of baptismal vows performed by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] on [[Easter]].

==Apostolic times ==
{{see also|Apostolic Age}}

[[St. Peter]] is said to have once baptized five thousand people in one day; this was most likely accomplished by aspersion or [[affusion]].&lt;ref&gt;Maskell, William. 1846. ''Monumenta ritualia ecclesiæ anglicanæ''. I. 209. [http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50013095]&lt;/ref&gt; Baptism by affusion (pouring) was certainly in practice in Apostolic times, being prescribed by the ''[[Didache]]''

:And concerning baptism, baptize this way: Having first said all these things, baptize into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, in living water. But if you have no living water, baptize into other water; and if you cannot do so in cold water, do so in warm. But if you have neither, ''pour out water three times upon the head'' into the name of Father and Son and Holy Spirit.

but there are no accounts that clearly show sprinkling rather than pouring or immersion was used.

==Early Christianity ==
{{see also|Early Christianity}}

The normal form of baptism for the first centuries&amp;mdash;until at least the twelfth century&amp;mdash;was immersion.  However, when a person could not be immersed, baptism by aspersion or affusion was performed.  There are records of people receiving baptism in prison, awaiting martyrdom, where immersion would be difficult or impossible, but the most common use was for a person who was ill and could not be removed from the bed; it therefore received the name "baptism of the sick."  Because of its rarity, doubts arose about its validity, as is shown by St. [[Cyprian]]'s affirming it in the face of questioning.

:You have asked also, dearest son, what I thought of those who obtain God's grace in sickness and weakness, whether they are to be accounted legitimate Christians, for that they are not to be washed, but sprinkled, with the saving water. In this point, my diffidence and modesty prejudges none, so as to prevent any from feeling what he thinks right, and from doing what he feels to be right. As far as my poor understanding conceives it, I think that the divine benefits can in no respect be mutilated and weakened; nor can anything less occur in that case, where, with full and entire faith both of the giver and receiver, is accepted what is drawn from the divine gifts&amp;hellip;nor ought it to trouble any one that sick people seem to be sprinkled or affused, when they obtain the Lord's grace, when Holy Scripture speaks by the mouth of the prophet [[Ezekiel]], and says, "Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness and from all your idols will I cleanse you. And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit will I put within you." (Ez 36,25) Also in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]]: "And the man that shall be unclean until the evening shall be purified on the third day, and on the seventh day shall be clean: but if he shall not be purified on the third day, on the seventh day he shall not be clean. And that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of sprinkling hath not been sprinkled upon him." (Nm 19,12-13) And again: "And the Lord spake unto [[Moses]] saying, Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them. And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: thou shall sprinkle them with the water of purification." (Nm 8,6-7) And again: "The water of sprinkling is a purification." Whence it appears that the sprinkling also of water prevails equally with the washing of salvation; and that when this is done in the Church, where the faith both of receiver and giver is sound, all things hold and may be consummated and perfected by the majesty of the Lord and by the truth of faith.

At the time, baptism by aspersion, as by affusion, was regarded as a bar to Holy Orders; this appears to spring from the baptized person having put off baptism until he was in danger of death.

==Later developments==
In the West, baptism by aspersion and affusion slowly became the common practice in later centuries.

In aspersion, an [[aspergilium]] may be used to place the water on the skin.

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] regards baptism by aspersion as valid only if the water actually flows on the person's skin and is thus equivalent to pouring ("affusion").&lt;ref&gt;"It is not sufficient for the water to merely touch the candidate; it must also flow, otherwise there would seem to be no real ablution" ([[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Baptism]])&lt;/ref&gt; If there is doubt about this, [[conditional baptism]] is administered.

While the root of the word "baptize" can mean "to immerse", the word is used in the New Testament also of a mere partial washing ({{bibleverse||Luke|11:38}}). Nevertheless, some [[Christian denomination]]s have taught that baptism not only by aspersion but even by [[affusion]] is invalid.

The '''Association for Decentralised Energy''' ('''ADE'''), formerly the '''Combined Heat and Power Association''', is an advocate of an integrated approach to delivering energy locally. The ADE was founded in 1967 as the District Heating Association, becoming the Combined Heat and Power Association in 1983, and was then renamed to the Association for Decentralised Energy on the 12 January 2015. The ADE has over 90&amp;nbsp;members.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

The ADE acts as an advocate for its members by engaging with Government and key decision makers to support cost effective and efficient [[solution]]s to industry, businesses and householders by:

* Developing a policy which puts the energy user’s needs first
* Delivering a local, low carbon energy system at lowest cost
* Ensuring an understanding of heat, which makes up half of our energy use
* Taking an integrated and 'systems thinking' approach
* Helping users manage energy demand to limit the need for new generation capacity
* Strengthening the sector’s reputation through industry standards and best practice{{cn|date=November 2016}}

The Association also provide secretariat for the Independent Heat Customer Protection Scheme.

In the background, walls of a great church are visible.|A [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] priest places the badnjak on a fire during a Christmas Eve celebration at the [[Cathedral of Saint Sava]] in [[Belgrade]].]]

The '''badnjak''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]]: бадњак, {{IPA-sh|bǎdɲaːk|sr}}), also called '''veseljak''' (весељак, {{IPA|[ʋɛˈsɛ̌ʎaːk]}}, literally "jovial one" in [[Serbian language|Serbian]]), is a tree branch or young tree brought into the house and placed on the fire on the evening of [[Christmas Eve]], a central tradition in [[Serbian Christmas traditions|Serbian Christmas celebration]]s{{r|group=Note|refa}}. The tree from which the badnjak is cut, preferably a young and straight [[Quercus cerris|Austrian oak]], is ceremonially felled early on the morning of Christmas Eve. The felling, preparation, bringing in, and laying on the fire, are surrounded by elaborate rituals, with many regional variations. The burning of the log is accompanied by prayers that the coming year brings food, happiness, love, luck, and riches. The log burns on throughout [[Christmas|Christmas Day]], when the first visitor strikes it with a poker or a branch to make sparks fly, while wishing that the family's happiness and prosperity be as abundant as the sparks. As most [[Serbs]] today live in towns and cities, the badnjak is often symbolically represented by a cluster of oak twigs with brown leaves attached, with which the home is decorated on Christmas Eve.

Since the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century, the Serbian badnjak tradition has also been celebrated more publicly. Before [[World War I]], soldiers of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] developed the custom of laying a badnjak on a fire in their [[barracks]]. In the succeeding [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], the military badnjak ceremony was further elaborated and standardized in army service regulations, but the tradition ended at the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Since the early 1990s, the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] has, together with local communities, organized public celebrations on Christmas Eve in which the badnjak plays a central role. Parishioners festively cut the sapling to be used as the badnjak and take it to their church, where it is consecrated by a priest before it is ceremonially placed on a fire built in the churchyard.

The festive kindling of the badnjak commemorates the fire that—according to Serbian folk tradition—the shepherds of [[Bethlehem]] built in the cave where [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] was [[Nativity of Jesus|born]], to warm the Baby Jesus and [[Theotokos|his mother]] throughout the night. The badnjak may also be seen as a [[Christian symbolism|symbol]] of the cross upon which Christ was [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucified]], the warmth of its fire symbolizing the [[Atonement in Christianity#Eastern Christianity|salvation]] which, in the [[Christianity|Christian belief]], the crucifixion made possible for mankind. Scholars regard the tradition as inherited from the [[Slavic mythology|old Slavic religion]]. They interpret the badnjak as an incarnation of the spirit of vegetation, and as a divinity who dies by burning to be reborn, to whom sacrifices and prayers were offered for the fertility of fields, the health and happiness of the family. The burning symbolized sunshine, securing the vitalizing power of the sun in the coming year. Other [[South Slavs|South Slavic peoples]] have similar traditions, and the custom that a family brings a log into the house and burns it on Christmas Eve has also been recorded in other parts of Europe.

Depending on the local custom, [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] Serbs may fell two, three, an arbitrary number greater than two, or the number equal to the male members of household plus one. The latter means that each of the males has a log associated with him, with the thickest log representing the head of household and the thinnest linked to the family's prosperity. If there is only one man in the household, three rather than two logs are prepared. The logs may be cut from different species of tree.&lt;ref name=vukmanovic/&gt; In parts of the [[Bay of Kotor]], each household prepares four sets of badnjaks, as they are burned there not only on Christmas Eve, but also on the eves of [[New Years Day]], [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], and the Feast of [[Saint Sava]].&lt;ref name=kulisic&gt;Kulišić, Špiro (1970).

In Grbalj, south-west of [[Kotor]], the number of the logs is equal to the number of people in the household. A [[Pistacia terebinthus|terebinth]] is cut down for the badnjak associated with the woman of the house, called the ''badnjačica'' ({{IPA|[badˈɲatʃitsa]}}), meaning she-badnjak.&lt;ref name=vukmanovic/&gt; The same term is also used in other areas where only a pair of oak logs is cut, in which case ''badnjačica'' refers to the smaller of the two.

When the head of household finds a suitable tree, he stands in front of it facing east. After throwing grain at the tree, he greets it with the words "Good morning and happy Christmas Eve to you", makes the [[Sign of the Cross]], says a prayer, and kisses the tree.&lt;ref name=vukmanovic/&gt;&lt;ref name=djurdjev/&gt; He may also explain to the badnjak why it will be cut: "I have come to you to take to my home, to be my faithful helper to every progress and improvement, in the house, in the pen, in the field, and in every place."&lt;ref name=kulisic/&gt; He then cuts it slantwise on its eastern side, using an axe. Some men put gloves on before they start to cut the tree, and from then on never touch the badnjak with their bare hands. The tree should fall to the east, unhindered by surrounding trees. It must not be left half-cut, as then it will curse the house of the man.&lt;ref name=kulisic/&gt; In some regions, if the tree is not cut down after the third blow of the axe, then it must be pulled and twisted until its trunk breaks. The resulting badnjak has a so-called "beard", the part of the trunk at which it broke off from the base of the tree.&lt;ref name=vukovic/&gt; In [[Šumadija]], half of a circular loaf of bread is left on the stump, the other half being eaten on the way back home.&lt;ref name=tolstoy/&gt; In Zagarač, the stump is covered with moss or dry leaves, and it will be visited again in spring: the stump sprouting through the cover is an omen of good luck and prosperity.&lt;ref name=dragovic/&gt;

The first splinter from the tree is taken home and placed where prosperity is especially desired, such as beside the [[beehive]]s, in the hen roost, or between milk basins in the [[dairy|dairy room]], in the hope that the coming year's [[kaymak]] will clot to form thick layers in the basins. It may also be placed beneath some [[baker's yeast]], so that the prosperity of the household may grow like yeast.&lt;ref name=vukovic/&gt; In [[Semberija]], a piece of the splinter is put in the dough for the [[česnica]], a round loaf of bread prepared specially for Christmas dinner. This is done "because of bees", as the reason is traditionally termed.&lt;ref name=cajkanovic2/&gt;

The top of the felled tree is removed, leaving the badnjak of such a length that allows it to be carried on a man's shoulder, up to about {{convert|2.5|m|ft|sp=us}} long.&lt;ref name=vukmanovic/&gt; Its branches may be lopped off, or not, depending on the local custom. Once in the home, each badnjak is leaned vertically against the house beside the entrance door.&lt;ref name=vukovic/&gt; In Montenegrin Littoral, each should be adorned with leaved bay laurel, olive, [[juniper]], and [[rosemary]] twigs, which are tied to the trunk's top, middle, and base with [[ivy]] or red silken or woolen threads.&lt;ref name=vukmanovic/&gt; In parts of eastern Serbia and [[Kosovo]] the badnjak is wrapped in a man's shirt.&lt;ref name=cajkanovic2/&gt;

In west Serbia's region of Rađevina, centered on the town of [[Krupanj]], the badnjak prepared for each household is cut into three logs, the most important of which is the ''dozemak''—the log that comes from the part of the trunk that grew nearest to the ground.&lt;ref name=djurdjev/&gt; In Resava, [[Levač]], Temnić, and [[Jadar (Serbia)|Jadar]] of Serbia, as well as in [[Ozren (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Ozren]] and [[Romanija]] of Bosnia, the badnjak is cut into three logs associated respectively with the men, the women, and the children.&lt;ref name=tolstoy/&gt;

===Bringing in and burning===
In the evening, a man of the family brings their badnjak into the house. If there is more than one badnjak, the thickest of them is regarded as the main one, and is brought in first. Stepping across the threshold, right foot first, the man greets his gathered family with the words "Good evening and happy Christmas Eve to you." The woman of the house greets him back, saying "May God give you well-being, and may you have good luck", or "Good luck to you, and together with you for many years to come [may we be]", or similar, before throwing grain from a sieve at the man and the badnjak he carries. In the [[Serb clans|clan]] of [[Kuči]], the woman touches the "beard" of the main badnjak with a whole loaf of bread.&lt;ref name=kulisic/&gt; In Montenegro, two women holding lighted candles stand one on either side of the house door as the badnjaks are carried in.&lt;ref name=vukovic/&gt;&lt;ref name=vukmanovic/&gt;
[[File:Ложење Бадњака.ogv|thumb|Burning of the badnjak]]
Upon entering the house the man approaches the fireplace, called ''ognjište'' ({{IPA|[ˈɔɡɲiːʃtɛ]}})—the hearth of an ''ognjište'' is similar to a [[campfire]], in that it has no vertical surround. He lays the badnjak down on the fire and moves it a little forward, to summon prosperity for the household.&lt;ref name=vukovic/&gt; Any other logs are brought in by other males and laid on the fire parallel or perpendicular to the first.&lt;ref name=vukmanovic/&gt; In a family with the tradition of burning the badnjak and ''badnjačica'', they are laid one across the other; the males then kiss the former, and the females the latter.&lt;ref name=vukovic/&gt; In Bukovica the two thicker logs are placed side by side, and the thinner one (trinity) is placed in parallel on top.&lt;ref name=ardalic/&gt; In 19th-century [[Herzegovina]], families with large houses would load their logs onto three or four pairs of oxen, which were then led into the house. The logs were unloaded and laid on the fire, and the oxen driven out through the back door.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Immediately after the badnjak has been brought in, or immediately before in some places, an armful of straw is spread over the floor. The straw is usually brought in with the same greetings and throwing of grain as the badnjak. The person spreading it may imitate a hen clucking to call her chicks, "''Kvo'', ''kvo'', ''kvo''", with the family's children imitating chicks, "''Piju'', ''piju'', ''piju''", while they pick at the straw.&lt;ref name=vukovic/&gt; In [[Čečava]], northern Bosnia, the children then lie down on the straw, before closing their eyes and picking a stalk with their lips: the child that picked the longest stalk will supposedly be the luckiest in the following year.&lt;ref name=peric&gt;{{Cite book

The thicker end of the log, the end that was nearest to the tree's roots, may have a special significance.

The badnjak should not be jumped over or trodden upon, and blowing on its fire is avoided. It should not be moved when about to burn through, lest the log break at the place most consumed by the fire, which is usually strongest at the center of the fireplace; the separation of the log should be a result of the fire only. None of the family members should fall asleep before the log splits, otherwise some of them may die in the coming year, without warning.&lt;ref name=vukovic/&gt;

The moment when the badnjak burns through may be marked with festivities, such as the log being kissed by the head of household,&lt;ref name=cajkanovic2/&gt; and wine being poured over it accompanied by toasts.&lt;ref name=karadzic/&gt; A reward may be given to the family member who was the first to notice the event, and in the past the men would go outside and fire their guns in celebration. There is a special verb ''preveseliti'' used instead of the common ''pregoreti'' to express "to burn through" when referring to the badnjak, which has the same [[root (linguistics)|root]] as the noun ''veseljak''. Once the log has burnt through, some families let the fire go out, while in others the men keep watch in shifts during the night to keep the badnjak burning.&lt;ref name=vukovic/&gt;

Once the badnjak has burnt through, the thicker end is often taken out of the fire and used according to the local custom. It may be carried around the beehives, extinguished, and placed between the branches of a young plum or apple tree.&lt;ref name=cajkanovic2/&gt; The men may make crosses from it and put them under the eaves, on the fields, meadows, vineyards, and [[apiary|apiaries]], so that the coming year may be happy and fruitful.&lt;ref name=vukovic/&gt; It may also be set aside for next Christmas Eve, to be placed on the fire immediately before the new badnjak, as a symbol of continuity.&lt;ref name=vukmanovic/&gt; In Kosovo, a part of the badnjak is preserved and burned again on New Years Day and Epiphany.&lt;ref name=kulisic/&gt;

The badnjak burns on through Christmas Day, whether rekindled or kept burning from the Eve. The first visit the family receives that day is considered important, comparable to New Years Day [[first-foot]]ing in the [[British Isles]]. The family may choose someone, usually a young male, to be their first visitor, known as a ''polaznik'', before the arrival of whom no outsider is allowed to enter the house. Early on the morning of Christmas Day he steps into the house, right foot first, and greets the family with "Christ is Born", to which they reply "Truly He is Born." The ''polaznik'' then approaches the ''ognjište'' and repeatedly strikes the burning log with a poker or a branch to make sparks fly.&lt;ref name=miles/&gt; At the same time he utters a wish that the happiness and prosperity of the household be as abundant as the sparks:&lt;ref name=vukovic/&gt;

{|

:How many sparks, that many sheep in the pen.
:How many sparks, that many pigs and lambs.

:and most of all, health and joy.

The wording of this well-wishing may vary, but its intention is always the same, to invoke happiness and prosperity. The ''polaznik'' will then throw a coin into the fire before being presented with a round loaf of bread, the traditional gift for the ''polaznik'', usually accompanied by some other present. The custom to use a domestic animal as a ''polaznik'' was kept in some regions until the first half of the 20th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name=vukovic/&gt; In Rađevina, the head of the household would lead a sheep into the house, place it between the ''ognjište'' and himself, and utter the wishes while striking the badnjak with a branch cut from it, before saying: "We passed one fire, we are not afraid of another." His wife would then kiss him over the sheep after saying "may the ewes kiss the lambs as we kiss each other."&lt;ref name=djurdjev/&gt;

Embers of the badnjak may be used for [[divination]] in Jadar. The number of these equal to the sum of grain and livestock sorts grown by the family are taken out from the ''ognjište'' and placed on the [[česnica]]. Each of the sorts is associated with its own ember on that loaf. The sort whose ember retains its glow longer than the others should be the most productive in the coming year. The log sparking by itself presages a rich harvest of honey. Cooled coals of the badnjak may be placed between the branches of fruit trees; the young trees may be provided also with twigs from the badnjak. Its ash may be spread over the fields and mixed with fodder.&lt;ref name=cajkanovic2/&gt; Some of the ash may be set aside to be taken with water as a remedy for headache.&lt;ref name=tolstoy/&gt; There are also numerous other regional practices connected with the badnjak.&lt;ref name=cajkanovic2/&gt;

[[Image:Badnjak saleswoman.jpg|thumb|right|300px|alt=Photograph of a young woman in winter clothes arranging variously sized oak tree branches laid out around two sides of a small square. The square is surrounded by a row of trees through which large buildings of a city can be seen.|Badnjaks on sale at [[Kalenić (Belgrade)#Kalenić market|Kalenić Market]], [[Belgrade]]]]

These ancient traditions have modern, reduced versions. Modern houses usually have no ''ognjište'' on which to burn a badnjak, but it may be symbolically represented by several oak twigs, some of which are burnt in a wood-burning kitchen stove and the others placed beside it. Some people chop the badnjak into shorter logs so that they can be put into the hearth and burnt.&lt;ref name=djurdjev/&gt; The most prevalent custom, however, is to place a cluster of oak twigs, with their brown leaves still attached, in whichever location in the home the family feels is appropriate. This cluster is also called the badnjak, and it is usually kept in the home until next Christmas Eve. For the convenience of those living in towns and cities, such little badnjaks can be bought at marketplaces or distributed in churches. In a common arrangement, the cluster of oak twigs is bound together with twigs of [[European Cornel]]{{r|group=Note|refb}} and several stalks of straw.&lt;ref name=vukovic/&gt;

The laying of a badnjak on the fire was considered the least a Serbian family could do to show their devotion to Serbian tradition. In [[Petar II Petrović-Njegoš]]'s poem ''[[The Mountain Wreath]]'', the plot of which takes place in 18th-century Montenegro, [[Voivode]] Batrić urges converts to [[Islam]] to return to Christianity and Serbdom: "[...] Lay the Serbian Christmas-log [badnjak] on the fire, paint the [[Easter egg]]s various colours, observe with care the [[Lent]] and [[Nativity Fast|Christmas fasts]]. As for the rest, do what your heart desires!"&lt;ref name=njegos&gt;[[Petar II Petrović-Njegoš|Petrović-Njegoš, Petar II]] (1986). Vasa D. Mihailovich. ed.

==Public celebration==
The badnjak ceremony, originally performed only within the family, became a more public celebration. A custom developed before World&amp;nbsp;War&amp;nbsp;I in the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] to lay the badnjak on a fire built in military barracks, so that the soldiers stationed there over Christmas could share in the holiday atmosphere. In the succeeding [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], the military badnjak ceremony was standardized in army service regulations. On Christmas Eve, under the command of a specially appointed officer, the representatives of military units of a garrison formed a festive procession on horses, accompanied with music. Members of citizens' associations and other civilians of the garrison town usually joined the procession as it proceeded to the nearest wood to collect the badnjak. They felled a set number of trees, dedicated respectively to the [[Royal Compound|Royal Palace]], the military command of the town, the respective commands of units of the garrison, its oldest officer, and its officers' assembly house. The procession brought the trees to the barracks, in whose yard an open fire was built. The garrison commander then placed the trees ceremonially on the fire, and gave an appropriate address.&lt;ref name=vesna&gt;{{cite journal

More and more state institutions, private firms, organizations, and clubs joined the procession each year, and the event began to take on the character of a public holiday. During the 1930s, the laying of badnjak on the fire became a court ritual. It was performed, in the presence of the [[House of Karađorđević|royal family]], by representatives of the army in the Royal Palace's room with a fireplace. At the end of the 1930s in some parts of Yugoslavia, especially [[Vojvodina]] and Montenegro, the military badnjak ceremony was performed not in the barracks yard but in a square in the garrison town. An open fire was built, on which the badnjak was placed by an Orthodox priest in the presence of soldiers and citizens. This tradition, symbolizing the unity of state, church, and people, was ended by the outbreak of World&amp;nbsp;War&amp;nbsp;II.&lt;ref name=vesna/&gt;

[[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia's socialist government]] suppressed or discouraged public religious celebrations until the early 1990s. Since then, the Serbian Orthodox Church has, together with local communities, organized public celebrations on Christmas Eve. There are typically three elements to such celebrations: the preparation, the ritual, and the festivity. The preparation consists of cutting down the oak sapling to be used as the badnjak, taking it to the church yard, and preparing drink and food for the assembled parishioners. The ritual includes [[Vespers]], placing the badnjak on the open fire built in the church yard, blessing or consecrating the badnjak, and an appropriate program with songs and recitals. In some parishes they build the fire on which to burn the badnjak not in the church yard but at some other suitable location in their town or village. The festivity consists of gathering around the fire and socializing. Each particular celebration has its own specific traits however, reflecting the traditions of the local community.&lt;ref name=vesna/&gt;

The expedition to cut down the badnjak is the basic activity in the preparation part of the celebration. It can be performed by an individual, but it is usually a collective act accompanied by a festive procession that may include [[carriage]]s and horsemen. After the tree to be used as the badnjak is cut down, it is adorned with straw, ribbons, oranges, apples, and sometimes with the [[Flag of Serbia|Serbian flag]]. In some parishes more than one badnjak is used in the celebration, and a different tree is felled for each. Often bunches of leaved oak twigs are prepared to be distributed to the congregation gathered at the church. Each badnjak is festively taken to the church gate, often transported on carriages. The badnjak may be taken into the churchyard without any ceremony, or it may be followed by a procession, as is the case in parts of [[Republika Srpska]] and the [[Bay of Kotor]].&lt;ref name=vesna/&gt;

The ritual is the central part of the celebration. Vespers vary from place to place with respect to the time of the beginning of the service, its length and structure. The laying of badnjak on the fire usually comes after the service, and is done by a priest or by a respected parishioner. Before the burning, the tree may be processionally carried around the church. In the case of more than one badnjak, the trees are placed in the shape of a cross. The assembled devotees throw then into the fire their twig bunches, each representing a small badnjak. The consecration or blessing is performed by a priest: he strews wheat grains over the badnjak, [[Thurible|censes]] it while singing the [[Troparion|Troparion of the Nativity]], and as he intones prayers, he pours wine and spreads honey on it. Instead of applying wine and honey, [[Holy water in Eastern Christianity|holy water]] may be sprinkled on the tree by dipping a bunch of [[basil]] into a bowl with the water. This rite is generally performed after the placing on the fire, although it may happen before, in which case the consecration may be performed in the church itself or in its yard.&lt;ref name=vesna/&gt;&lt;ref name=marshall&gt;{{cite journal

After the ritual the priest delivers a short sermon, followed by the church choir singing Christmas songs; poems that praise the Nativity of Jesus Christ may be recited. In Montenegro, [[decasyllable]] [[Serbian epic poetry|Serbian epics]] are sung to an accompaniment played on the [[gusle]], a traditional Serbian bowed string instrument. The celebration ends with parishioners gathered around the fire, served with cooked [[rakia]], wine, or tea, and the food allowed during the [[Nativity Fast]].&lt;ref name=vesna/&gt; Parishioners may pick a twig from the badnjak and take it home to place in front of their [[icon]], or at another appropriate location.&lt;ref name=marshall/&gt;

Although Serbian public religious celebrations, as those of other peoples, were discouraged in Socialist Yugoslavia until the early 1990s, they continued among [[Serbian American]]s.

The [[Theotokos]] and the [[Child Jesus|Christ Child]], who lies in the manger in the cave, are at the center. Two shepherds are on the right, one of them sitting and playing music for his flock.]]

The origin of the badnjak is explained by the events surrounding the Nativity of Jesus Christ. According to the [[Gospel of Luke]] [[s:Bible (King James)/Luke|2:1–20]], [[Theotokos|Mary Theotokos]] gave birth to Christ at Bethlehem, wrapped him in cloths and laid him in a manger. By [[Holy Tradition]], the manger was located in a [[Church of the Nativity|cave near that town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

They went there and found the baby lying in the manger, as the angel described to them. By folk tradition, the shepherds brought firewood to the cave and built a fire to warm the newborn Christ and his mother throughout the night. The burning of the badnjak commemorates this event.&lt;ref name=vukovic/&gt;&lt;ref name=ardalic/&gt;

While blessing the badnjak, some priests chant the following prayer: "O Lord Jesus Christ, our God, who did plant the [[Tree of Life (Judeo-Christian)#Eastern Christianity|Tree of Life]] in paradise so that it might bestow upon us eternal blessedness, bless also now this tree which is a [[Christian symbolism|symbol]] of [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Thy cross]] and the Tree of Life in paradise, and which reminds us of Thy holy birth and of the logs which the shepherds of Bethlehem kindled to warm themselves when they came to worship Thee, the divine infant, and thereby prefigured Thy salvation-bearing cross."&lt;ref name=marshall/&gt;

Scholars regard the badnjak customs as practises inherited from the [[Slavic mythology|old Slavic religion]]. In the pre-Christian religion of the Serbs, as shown by Serbian scholar [[Veselin Čajkanović]], there were trees seen as dwelling places of spirits or divinities. Čajkanović argues that there were also trees seen as divinities ''per se''. He considers the badnjak as a convincing example of the latter. Salutations, prayers, and sacrifices such as grain, wine, and honey are offered to him (the name ''badnjak'' is of masculine gender in [[Serbian language|Serbian]]); he is consistently treated not as a tree but as a person.&lt;ref name=cajkanovic&gt;{{cite book

German scholar and folklorist [[Wilhelm Mannhardt]] holds that the log represented an incarnation of the spirit of vegetation.&lt;ref name=miles/&gt; The sacrifices offered to the badnjak were meant to guarantee the fertility of fields, the health and happiness of the family.&lt;ref name=janicijevic&gt;{{cite book

He also proposes that the crosses made from the thicker end of the log may have originated from [[Idolatry|idols]] representing deities comparable with the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] [[Lares]], the cruciform having developed from an [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] shape of the idols. The badnjak is preferably cut from an oak, which was the most respected tree in the old Slavic religion, associated with the supreme god [[Perun]].&lt;ref name=cajkanovic/&gt;

Archaeologist [[Arthur Evans|Sir Arthur Evans]] was a guest in a Serbian highlander family in the region of [[Krivošije]], Montenegrin Littoral. Analyzing the practices, he concluded that the badnjak customs were connected with [[ancestor worship]]. The lighting of the log on the ''ognjište'' could be seen as a solemn annual rekindling of the sacred hearth fire, regarded as the center of the family life and the seat of the ancestors. The belief that ancestral spirits dwell in the domestic hearth was attested among Slavic and other peoples.&lt;ref name=miles/&gt; Fire worship in the old Slavic religion was mostly transformed into the cult of domestic fire, and thus joined with ancestor worship. A trace of sacrifice to the fire is the coin thrown into it by the ''polaznik'' after the ritual of making sparks fly from the badnjak.&lt;ref name=janicijevic/&gt;

Fire from the domestic hearth was under no circumstances given out of the house on Christmas Eve, not even to a neighbor whose fire had gone out. The reason for this prohibition, according to Čajkanović, was the belief that the Eve is a time when the ancestral spirits, guardians of the family's happiness and prosperity, are especially active in this world. Christmas Eve dinner is a feast prepared in their honor, and they join the family at it. They gather on the straw spread over the floor, and on the hearth. These spirits could be removed from the family if any piece of their fire were taken away by an outsider.&lt;ref name=cajkanovic4&gt;{{cite book

Referring to the latter explanation, Čajkanović argues that, in the old religion of the Serbs, the bees were regarded as pure and sacred insects, in whom ancestral spirits could dwell.&lt;ref name=cajkanovic4/&gt; The same explanation, "because of bees", is also given for the aforementioned custom of putting a piece of the badnjak's first splinter in the dough for the česnica.

Russian philologist [[Vladimir Toporov]] has proposed that the felling of the badnjak was originally a reenactment of the mythical fight in which ''Mladi Božić'' ("young god") slew his father ''Stari Badnjak'' ("old Badnjak").&lt;ref name=watkins&gt;{{cite book

He regards ''Stari Badnjak'' and ''Mladi Božić'' as originating from respectively the dragon and the dragon slayer of the [[Proto-Indo-European mythology#Dragon or Serpent|Proto-Indo-European mythology]].{{r|group=Note|refc}} ''Stari Badnjak'' would be related to both the [[Vedas|Vedic]] serpent ''Ahi Budhnya'' ("the Dragon of the Deep") killed by [[Indra]], and the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] dragon [[Python (mythology)|Python]] killed by [[Apollo]].{{r|group=Note|refd}} The words ''badnjak'', ''budhnya'', and ''python'' stem from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] [[root (linguistics)|root]] [[Asterisk#Historical linguistics|*]]''bhudh-'', denoting bottom, foundation, depths, and related notions.&lt;ref name=watkins/&gt;

According to Russian philologist and mythographer [[Boris Uspensky]], ''Stari Badnjak'' and ''Mladi Božić'' have analogues in [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] tradition—Nikola's Dad and Nikola. The name Nikola is a popular reference to [[Saint Nicholas|Saint Nicholas of Myra]], whose feast falls nineteen days before Christmas, on 6 December, his "dad" being celebrated the day before. Nikola is portrayed in East Slavic folklore as merciful and protective towards the common people, patron of animals and agriculture, connected with riches, abundance, and fertility. Uspensky argues that this saint took on attributes of the serpentine god [[Veles (god)|Volos]], whose cult was very strong among East Slavs before Christianization. He was the adversary of the dreadful thunder-god Perun, who is in this case reflected in Nikola's Dad.&lt;ref name=uspensky&gt;{{cite book

The notion of a quarrel between Nikola and his "dad" is present in a number of legends. The connection between the father–son pairs of ''Stari Badnjak''–''Mladi Božić'' and Nikola's Dad–Nikola is corroborated by the fact that, in many East Slavic regions, practices characteristic for Christmas have been transferred to the Feast of Saint Nicholas. There is, however, an inversion in the comparison between these two pairs. In the former pair, the first stems from the mythical dragon, and the second from the dragon fighter, while in the latter pair it is vice versa. This inversion explains, by Uspensky, the fact that in some areas Nikola's Dad is celebrated on the day after his son's feast, rather than on the eve of it. In that way, the "dragon" (Nikola) comes before the "dragon fighter" (Nikola's Dad), as is the case with ''Stari Badnjak'' and ''Mladi Božić''.&lt;ref name=uspensky/&gt;

Serbian ethnologist Petar Vlahović has proposed that the noun ''badnjak'' and the related adjective ''badnji'' (attributive "Christmas Eve") are derived from the root of the verb ''bdeti'' ("to be awake"), referring to a custom of staying awake through the night before Christmas Day.&lt;ref name=djurdjev/&gt; The same etymology of the adjective ''badnji'' has also been proposed by [[Vuk Stefanović Karadžić]], 19th-century Serbian philologist, systematizer of [[oral literature]], and ethnographer.&lt;ref name=karadzic/&gt;

All are dressed according to British fashion of the 19th century.|An illustration of people collecting a [[Yule log]] from the ''[[Chambers Book of Days]]'']]
The custom that a family solemnly brings a log into the house and lights it on the hearth on Christmas Eve has been recorded in various parts of Europe. In England, a [[Yule log]] used to be festively kindled on the domestic hearth so "that sweet luck may come while the log is a-teending", as described by 17th-century poet [[Robert Herrick (poet)|Robert Herrick]]. In France, the log had different regional names: ''chalendal'', ''calignaou'', ''tréfoir'', and ''tréfouet''. In [[Provence]], it had to be cut from a fruit tree; it was brought in by the whole family while they sang a carol praying for blessing on the house, that the women might bear children, the nanny-goats kids, and the ewes lambs, and that their grain and wine might abound. Before the log was placed on the fire, the youngest child in the family poured wine on it. Logs were devotionally laid on the domestic fire on Christmas Eve in various parts of Italy; in [[Tuscany]], Christmas is called ''Festa di Ceppo'', literally "feast of log". In the [[Valdichiana|Val di Chiana]], the children of the family were blindfolded and commanded to beat the burning log with tongs. Traces of Christmas-log customs can also be found in Germany and Scandinavia. In [[Thuringia]] the family placed a ''Christklotz'' (Christ log) on the fire before going to bed, so that it might burn all through the night.&lt;ref name=miles/&gt;

In [[Croats|Croatian]] tradition, objects of two different types are referred to as ''badnjak''. The first type includes leaved branches cut from Turkey oaks or [[hazel|hazel trees]], up to {{convert|2|m|ft|sp=us}} long with as many [[catkin]]s as possible. Such a branch used to be placed on Christmas Eve morning above the house door, under the eaves, or on the roof, and had an aesthetic role. The other type includes logs cut usually from oak trunks. In the evening the family used to ritually bring three such logs into the house and burn them on the hearth. These practices are no longer performed, but in some places a modified form of badnjak is used: a cross is carved into the bark of pieces of firewood which are burned in kitchen stoves on Christmas Eve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

After the man brings it into the house, a hole is bored in one end of the ''badnik'' and filled with wine, cooking oil, and [[incense]]. The hole is plugged, and that end of the log is wrapped with a white linen cloth before the ''badnik'' is festively burned on the hearth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In Greece, a large log was lit on the hearth on Christmas Eve and kept burning or smoldering through the [[Twelve Days of Christmas]]. This was done as a protection against the demons called ''[[Kallikantzaros|Kallikantzaroi]]'', believed to be emerging from their dens at night during that period to attack people and damage their property. The fire and smoke from the log was thought to prevent the ''Kallikantzaroi'' from entering the house down the chimney.&lt;ref name=miles/&gt; The ritual burning of logs on the Eve was also carried out in Albania. When the ''buzm'', as the log was called there, was about to be brought into the house, a member of the family would go out into the yard, shout the name of the household's head, and proclaim that the ''buzm'' was coming and bringing all kinds of delicious things. The head of the household would respond by saying "You are welcome!" and the ''buzm'' would be ceremonially brought in, greeted by the family and treated with great respect. The log would be placed on the hearth, and often a significant part of all food and drink in the house would be put on the log and burned together with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;ref name=refa&gt;Christmas Eve does not fall on the same day for the [[Serbs]] as for the [[Western Christianity|Western Christians]], although they celebrate it on the same date—24&amp;nbsp;December. This is because the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] uses the [[Julian calendar]] rather than the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] used in the West.

Little is known of the man Barley Barber except that he left the region after he had "trouble with the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Florida Power &amp; Light |url=http://www.fpl.com/environment/swamp/history_of_the_barely_barber_swamp.shtml |title=History of Barley Barber Swamp |accessdate=2009-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104085349/http://www.fpl.com/environment/swamp/history_of_the_barely_barber_swamp.shtml |archivedate=2010-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location and History==

Historically, Barley Barber Swamp connected regional [[wetland]]s, including the Allapatah Marsh, to [[Lake Okeechobee]], ultimately feeding the [[Everglades]] ecosystem further south.

The region was once a center of trading for the [[Native Americans in the United States|indigenous people]] of the Lake Okeechobee area. A {{convert|16|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=on}} tall [[Mound builder (people)|sand mound]] with ramp extensions sits in what remains today of the Barley Barber Swamp. [[Anthropology|Anthropologists]] contend that the indigenous culture of the area converged on the mound to trade in pottery. [[Pottery]] shards and human remains found on the mound are 300 to 900 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Willie |last=Howard |title=Swamp Seduces Sightseers |work=The Palm Beach Post |date=1999-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant [[Hydrology|hydrological]] changes occurred in Barley Barber starting in the late 19th century with the construction of [[Henry Flagler]]'s [[Florida East Coast Railway]]. Regional drainage projects, highways, and the construction of the [[Herbert Hoover Dike]] around Lake Okeechobee altered and disrupted the natural flow. Today the Barley Barber waterway is diverted through the L-65 canal into the St. Lucie canal before it reaches Lake Okeechobee. Nevertheless it remains navigable and interconnected.

==Flora and fauna==
[[Image:Shoestring fern.jpg|thumb|Shoestring fern In Barley Barber]]
One of the oldest bald cypress (''[[Taxodium distichum]]'') trees in the entire Southeastern U.S. sits in Barley Barber Swamp. It is estimated at over 1,000 years old, stands {{convert|88|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall, and has a circumference of {{convert|33|ft|m|abbr=on}}. There are also Florida strangler figs (''[[Ficus aurea]]''), swamp maples (''[[Acer rubrum]]''), and pond apples (''[[Annona glabra]]''). Barley Barber is home to a pair of nesting [[bald eagle]]s, [[American alligator]]s, [[North American river otter]]s, [[bobcat]]s, [[white-tailed deer]] and numerous unique plant species, including giant leather ferns (''[[Acrostichum]] [[Acrostichum danaeifolium|danaeifolium]]''), shoestring ferns (''[[Vittaria]] [[Vittaria lineata|lineata]]'') and whisk ferns (''[[Psilotum]]'' species), which are fern-like vascular plants. Many species of migratory and [[Wader|wading birds]], such as [[egret]]s, [[ibis]]es, [[limpkin]], and the endangered [[wood stork]], can be seen in the swamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ann |last=Carter |title=Swamped by Nature |work=South Florida Sun-Sentinel |date=1998-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourism==

[[Florida Power &amp; Light]] acquired the land surrounding the Barley Barber Swamp in 1972 in order to construct the [[Martin County, Florida|Martin County]] power plant. In the 1973 [[Environmental Impact Statement]] (EIS) Florida Power &amp; Light states that "FPL has designated the facilities of this project so that the swamp, containing several of Florida's endangered species, will not only be saved but will be preserved and enhanced."&lt;ref&gt;Florida Power &amp; Light,"Environmental Impact Statement Martin Plant," February 1973&lt;/ref&gt; After the plant's opening, the company constructed and opened a {{convert|1.9|mi|km|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[boardwalk]] for tours in Barley Barber Swamp. Local businesses in [[Indiantown, Florida|Indiantown]], such as the historic [[Seminole Inn]], coordinated tourism for the swamp. Barley Barber served as an environmental and economic asset to the small, rural community.

Following [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001]], FPL closed off all access to the Barley Barber Swamp citing security concerns.

Florida Power &amp; Light Company along with the Treasured Lands Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to protecting, restoring and maintaining land for the public’s enjoyment,  worked together to restore the Barley Barber Swamp and re-open this environmental asset to the public.  The Barley Barber Swamp currently invites the public to get a glimpse of the stunning old-growth cypress community with its free guided tours.

Tours of Barley Barber Swamp are offered October through May  All groups are accompanied by a tour guide along the 5,800 foot boardwalk. Individual tours are by reservation only and must be booked through the historic Seminole Inn. They are offered Wednesday through Sunday at either 8:30 a.m. or 1:30 p.m. Call 772-597-3777 to book a tour or visit http://treasuredlands.org/

==Controversy==
[[Image:Reopen5 main.JPG|thumb|Barley Barber Swamp protesters entering swamp through waterway]]
[[Image:Stevie Lowe Barley Barber Swamp Sitter.JPG|thumb|Martin County sheriff's officer climbs tree to bring out tree sitter Stevie Lowe in Barley Barber Swamp]]
Beginning on 5 January 2009, 30 environmental activists staged a five-day vigil along the Barley Barber Swamp to draw attention to what they claimed were damages being wrought by the power company's 3,705&amp;nbsp;[[megawatt]] Martin County plant. They also claimed that the swamp and its waterway is not a part of [[Florida Power &amp; Light]] property but rather Waters of the State and Waters of the U.S, held for use by the public.  The activists claim that the Martin County power plant is drawing water from the aquifer below the swamp causing the soil to subside below the root systems of the trees, resulting in declining forest health. On January 10, seventeen of the activists were arrested for [[trespassing]]. Florida Power &amp; Light has since stated that the company will reopen the Barley Barber Swamp by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/content/local_news/epaper/2009/01/10/0110protest.html?cxtype=rss&amp;cxsvc=7&amp;cxcat=76 |title=17 protesters arrested at Barley Barber swamp, demand FPL open area to the public |work=The Palm Beach Post|date=2009-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the evidence behind claims of the Martin Plant's detrimental impacts on the Barley Barber Swamp come from research conducted by Hydro-ecologist Dr. Sydney Bacchus. Dr. Bacchus has stated that the power plant's [[cooling pond]] and water use have caused "surficial aquifer draw down." Through the lowering of the water table, Dr. Bacchus argues, the ecosystem, including wildlife and the ancient cypress trees, is dying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eco-Watch-Martin |url=http://www.averyvoice.com/barleybarber.html |publisher=AveryVoice.com |accessdate=2009-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 July 2009, Stevie Lowe, one of the seventeen activists arrested at the Barley Barber protest, stood trial for trespassing into Barley Barber Swamp where she chained herself to a swamp maple. The jury found Stevie "[[Acquittal|not guilty]]" of trespassing. She was however convicted of "resisting arrest without violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mellisa |last=Holsman |title=Woman gets 90 days in jail for resisting during Martin environmental protest |work=TCPalm |date=2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; That the State Attorney's office of Martin County did not prove FPL's ownership of Barley Barber Swamp has led the activists to further their claim that the Barley Barber Swamp is Waters of the United States held for the use of the public rather than FPL's [[private property]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Everglades Earth First |url=http://miami.indymedia.org/news/2009/07/13483.php |title=Barley Barber Swamp Defender Takes on FPL's Property Claims and Wins |work=Miami Independent Media Center |date=2009-07-24 |accessdate=2009-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801044241/http://miami.indymedia.org/news/2009/07/13483.php |archivedate=2009-08-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ile de ré.JPG|thumb|300px|Cross swell at [[Île de Ré]] ]]
In surface [[navigation]], a '''cross sea''' is a [[sea state]] with two [[wind wave|wave system]]s traveling at [[oblique angle]]s.&lt;ref name=AMS&gt;{{cite web | url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=cross-sea1 |work=Glossary of Meteorology | publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]| title=Cross Sea |accessdate=2007-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may occur when [[water waves]] from one [[weather system]] continue despite a shift in [[wind]]. Waves generated by the new wind run at an angle to the old, creating a shifting, dangerous pattern. Two weather systems that are far from each other may create a cross sea when the waves from the systems meet, usually at a place far from either weather system. Until the older waves have dissipated, they create a sea hazard among the most perilous. This sea state is fairly common and a larger percentage of ship accidents were found to have occurred in this state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Is the Cross Sea Dangerous?|publisher=[[European Space Agency]]|date=2010|accessdate=5 June 2016|url=http://earth.eo.esa.int/cgi-bin/confsea10.pl?abstract=349|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503193016/http://earth.eo.esa.int/cgi-bin/confsea10.pl?abstract=349|archivedate=3 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vessels fare better against large waves when perpendicular to the wave. In a cross sea, vessels are much more likely to be struck in a dangerous way.

A '''cross swell''' is generated when the wave systems are longer period [[Swell (ocean)|swell]], rather than short period wind generated waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Nathaniel | last=Bowditch | authorlink = Nathaniel Bowditch | title=[[The American Practical Navigator]] | publisher=[[National Imagery and Mapping Agency]]|chapter=Glossary C| chapterurl=http://www.irbs.com/bowditch/pdf/glossary/gloss-c.pdf| location= Bethesda, MD | year=1995 | isbn=0-403-09895-5 | page=758 }}

[[File:Cryosphere Fuller Projection.png|thumb|right|300px|Overview of the Cryosphere and its larger components, from the [http://maps.grida.no/go/graphic/cryosphere UN Environment Programme Global Outlook for Ice and Snow].]]
The '''cryosphere''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|κρύος}} ''kryos'', "cold", "frost" or "ice" and {{lang|grc|σφαῖρα}} ''sphaira'', "globe, ball"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsfai%3Dra^ σφαῖρα], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;) is those portions of [[Earth]]'s surface where [[water]] is in [[solid]] form, including [[sea ice]], lake ice, river [[ice]], [[snow]] cover, [[glacier]]s, [[ice cap]]s, [[ice sheet]]s, and frozen ground (which includes [[permafrost]]). Thus, there is a wide overlap with the [[hydrosphere]]. The cryosphere is an integral part of the [[global climate]] system with important linkages and [[feedback]]s generated through its influence on surface energy and moisture fluxes, [[cloud]]s, [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], [[hydrology]], atmospheric and oceanic circulation. Through these [[feedback]] processes, the cryosphere plays a significant role in the [[global climate]] and in [[climate model]] response to global changes. The term [[deglaciation]] describes the retreat of cryospheric features. Cryology is the study of cryospheres.

== Structure ==
[[File:Components of the Cryosphere.tif|thumb|300px|Extent of the regions affected by components of the cryosphere around the world from the [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]]]]
[[Ice|Frozen water]] is found on the [[Earth]]’s surface primarily as [[snow]] cover, [[freshwater]] [[ice]] in [[lake]]s and [[rivers]], [[sea ice]], [[glaciers]], [[ice sheets]], and frozen ground and [[permafrost]] (permanently frozen ground). The residence time of water in each of these cryospheric sub-systems varies widely. Snow cover and freshwater ice are essentially seasonal, and most sea ice, except for ice in the central [[Arctic]], lasts only a few years if it is not seasonal. A given water particle in [[glaciers]], [[ice sheets]], or ground ice, however, may remain frozen for 10-100,000 years or longer, and deep ice in parts of [[East Antarctica]] may have an age approaching 1 million years.

Most of the world’s ice volume is in [[Antarctica]], principally in the [[East Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. In terms of areal extent, however, [[Northern Hemisphere]] winter snow and ice extent comprise the largest area, amounting to an average 23% of hemispheric surface area in January. The large areal extent and the important climatic roles of [[snow]] and [[ice]], related to their unique physical properties, indicate that the ability to observe and model snow and ice-cover extent, thickness, and [[Properties of water#Physics and chemistry|physical properties]] (radiative and thermal properties) is of particular significance for [[climate research]].

There are several fundamental physical properties of snow and ice that modulate energy exchanges between the surface and the [[atmosphere]]. The most important properties are the surface reflectance ([[albedo]]), the ability to transfer heat (thermal diffusivity), and the ability to change state ([[latent heat]]). These physical properties, together with surface roughness, [[emissivity]], and [[dielectric]] characteristics, have important implications for observing [[snow]] and [[ice]] from space. For example, surface roughness is often the dominant factor determining the strength of [[radar]] [[backscatter]] .&lt;ref name="hall"&gt;
Hall, D. K., 1996: Remote sensing applications to hydrology: imaging radar. Hydrological Sciences, 41, 609-624.
&lt;/ref&gt; Physical properties such as [[crystal]] structure, density, length, and liquid water content are important factors affecting the transfers of heat and water and the scattering of [[microwave]] [[energy]].

The surface reflectance of incoming [[solar radiation]] is important for the surface energy balance (SEB). It is the ratio of reflected to incident solar radiation, commonly referred to as [[albedo]]. [[Climatologists]] are primarily interested in [[albedo]] integrated over the [[Shortwave radiation|shortwave]] portion of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] (~300 to 3500&amp;nbsp;nm), which coincides with the main solar energy input. Typically, [[albedo]] values for non-melting snow-covered surfaces are high (~80-90%) except in the case of forests. The higher [[albedo]]s for snow and ice cause rapid shifts in surface [[reflectivity]] in autumn and spring in high latitudes, but the overall climatic significance of this increase is spatially and temporally modulated by [[cloud cover]]. (Planetary [[albedo]] is determined principally by [[cloud cover]], and by the small amount of total [[solar radiation]] received in high [[latitudes]] during winter months.) Summer and autumn are times of high-average cloudiness over the [[Arctic Ocean]] so the [[albedo]] [[feedback]] associated with the large seasonal changes in [[sea-ice]] extent is greatly reduced. Groisman ''et al.''&lt;ref name="groisman" /&gt; observed that snow cover exhibited the greatest influence on the [[Earth]] [[Irradiance|radiative balance]] in the spring (April to May) period when incoming [[solar radiation]] was greatest over snow-covered areas.&lt;ref name="groisman"&gt;Groisman, P. Ya, T. R. Karl, and R. W. Knight, 1994a: Observed impact of snow cover on the heat balance and the rise of continental spring temperatures. Science, 363, 198-200.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[thermal]] properties of cryospheric elements also have important climatic consequences. [[Snow]] and [[ice]] have much lower [[thermal]] diffusivities than [[air]]. [[Thermal diffusivity]] is a measure of the speed at which temperature waves can penetrate a substance. [[Snow]] and [[ice]] are many [[orders of magnitude]] less efficient at diffusing heat than [[air]]. Snow cover insulates the ground surface, and sea ice insulates the underlying ocean, decoupling the surface-atmosphere interface with respect to both heat and moisture fluxes. The flux of moisture from a water surface is eliminated by even a thin skin of ice, whereas the flux of heat through thin ice continues to be substantial until it attains a thickness in excess of 30 to 40&amp;nbsp;cm. However, even a small amount of snow on top of the ice will dramatically reduce the heat flux and slow down the rate of ice growth. The insulating effect of snow also has major implications for the [[hydrological cycle]]. In non-permafrost regions, the insulating effect of snow is such that only near-surface ground freezes and deep-water drainage is uninterrupted.&lt;ref name="lynch"&gt;Lynch-Stieglitz, M., 1994: The development and validation of a simple
snow model for the GISS GCM. J. Climate, 7, 1842-1855.&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[snow]] and [[ice]] act to insulate the surface from large energy losses in winter, they also act to retard warming in the spring and summer because of the large amount of energy required to melt ice (the [[latent heat]] of fusion, 3.34 x 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; J/kg at 0&amp;nbsp;°C). However, the strong static stability of the [[atmosphere]] over areas of extensive snow or ice tends to confine the immediate cooling effect to a relatively shallow layer, so that associated atmospheric anomalies are usually short-lived and local to regional in scale.&lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;Cohen, J., and D. Rind, 1991: The effect of snow cover on the climate.
J. Climate, 4, 689-706.&lt;/ref&gt; In some areas of the world such as [[Eurasia]], however, the cooling associated with a heavy snowpack and moist spring soils is known to play a role in modulating the summer [[monsoon]] circulation.&lt;ref name="vernekar"&gt;Vernekar, A. D., J. Zhou, and J. Shukla, 1995: The effect of Eurasian snow cover on the Indian monsoon. J. Climate, 8, 248-266.&lt;/ref&gt; Gutzler and Preston (1997) recently presented evidence for a similar snow-summer circulation [[feedback]] over the southwestern [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gutzler|first=David S.|last2=Preston|first2=Jessica W.|date=1997-09-01|title=Evidence for a relationship between spring snow cover in North America and summer rainfall in New Mexico|url=https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/97GL02099|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|language=en|volume=24|issue=17|pages=2207–2210|doi=10.1029/97gl02099|issn=1944-8007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of [[snow]] cover in modulating the monsoon is just one example of a short-term cryosphere-climate [[feedback]] involving the land surface and the [[atmosphere]]. From Figure 1 it can be seen that there are numerous cryosphere-climate feedbacks in the [[global climate]] system. These operate over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales from local seasonal cooling of air temperatures to hemispheric-scale variations in [[ice sheet]]s over time-scales of thousands of years. The [[feedback]] mechanisms involved are often complex and incompletely understood. For example, Curry ''et al.'' (1995) showed that the so-called “simple” sea ice-albedo feedback involved complex interactions with lead fraction, melt ponds, ice thickness, snow cover, and sea-ice extent.

=== Snow ===
[[Snow]] cover has the second-largest areal extent of any component of the cryosphere, with a mean maximum areal extent of approximately 47 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Most of the Earth’s snow-covered area (SCA) is located in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and [[Time|temporal]] variability is dominated by the seasonal cycle; [[Northern Hemisphere]] snow-cover extent ranges from 46.5 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in January to 3.8 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in August.&lt;ref name="robinson"&gt;Robinson, D.

Ya, and D. R. Easterling, 1994: Variability and trends of total precipitation and snowfall over the United States and Canada. J. Climate, 7, 184-205.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the available [[satellite]] data show that the hemispheric winter snow cover has exhibited little interannual variability over the 1972-1996 period, with a coefficient of variation (COV=s.d./mean) for January [[Northern Hemisphere]] [[snow]] cover of &lt; 0.04. According to Groisman ''et al.''&lt;ref name="groisman" /&gt; [[Northern Hemisphere]] spring snow cover should exhibit a decreasing trend to explain an observed increase in [[Northern Hemisphere]] spring [[air temperature]]s this century. Preliminary estimates of SCA from historical and reconstructed [[in situ]] snow-cover data suggest this is the case for [[Eurasia]], but not for [[North America]], where spring snow cover has remained close to current levels over most of this century.&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;Brown, R. D., 1997: Historical variability in Northern Hemisphere spring snow covered area. Annals of Glaciology, 25, 340-346.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the close relationship observed between hemispheric air temperature and snow-cover extent over the period of [[satellite]] data (IPCC 1996), there is considerable interest in monitoring [[Northern Hemisphere]] snow-cover extent for detecting and monitoring [[climate change]].

[[Snow]] cover is an extremely important storage component in the water balance, especially seasonal [[snowpack]]s in mountainous areas of the world. Though limited in extent, seasonal [[snowpack]]s in the [[Earth]]’s mountain ranges account for the major source of the runoff for stream flow and [[groundwater]] recharge over wide areas of the midlatitudes. For example, over 85% of the annual runoff from the [[Colorado River]] basin originates as snowmelt. [[Snowmelt]] [[Surface runoff|runoff]] from the Earth’s mountains fills the rivers and recharges the aquifers that over a billion people depend on for their water resources. Further, over 40% of the world’s protected areas are in mountains, attesting to their value both as unique [[ecosystem]]s needing protection and as recreation areas for humans. Climate warming is expected to result in major changes to the partitioning of snow and rainfall, and to the timing of snowmelt, which will have important implications for water use and management. These changes also involve potentially important decadal and longer time-scale [[feedback]]s to the climate system through temporal and spatial changes in [[soil moisture]] and runoff to the [[ocean]]s.(Walsh 1995). Freshwater fluxes from the snow cover into the marine environment may be important, as the total flux is probably of the same magnitude as desalinated ridging and rubble areas of sea ice.&lt;ref name="prinsenberg"&gt;Prinsenberg, S. J. 1988: Ice-cover and ice-ridge contributions to the freshwater contents of Hudson Bay and Foxe Basin. Arctic, 41, 6-11.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there is an associated pulse of precipitated pollutants which accumulate over the Arctic winter in snowfall and are released into the ocean upon [[ablation]] of the [[sea-ice]] .

=== Sea ice ===
[[Sea ice]] covers much of the polar oceans and forms by freezing of sea water. [[Satellite]] data since the early 1970s reveal considerable seasonal, regional, and interannual variability in the [[sea-ice]] covers of both hemispheres. Seasonally, sea-ice extent in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] varies by a factor of 5, from a minimum of 3-4 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in February to a maximum of 17-20 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in September.&lt;ref name="zwally"&gt;Zwally, H. J., J. C. Comiso, C. L. Parkinson, W. J. Campbell, F. D. Carsey, and P. Gloersen, 1983: Antarctic Sea Ice, 1973-1976: Satellite Passive-Microwave Observations. NASA SP-459, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington, D.C., 206 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gloersen"/&gt; The seasonal variation is much less in the Northern Hemisphere where the confined nature and high latitudes of the [[Arctic Ocean]] result in a much larger perennial ice cover, and the surrounding land limits the equatorward extent of wintertime ice. Thus, the seasonal variability in [[Northern Hemisphere]] ice extent varies by only a factor of 2, from a minimum of 7-9 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in September to a maximum of 14-16 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in March.&lt;ref name="gloersen"&gt;Gloersen, P., W. J. Campbell, D. J. Cavalieri, J. C. Comiso, C. L. Parkinson, and H. J. Zwally, 1992: Arctic and Antarctic Sea Ice,

Campbell, 1987: Arctic Sea Ice, 1973-1976: Satellite Passive-Microwave Observations, NASA SP-489, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington, D.C., 296 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ice cover exhibits much greater regional-scale interannual variability than it does hemispherical. For instance, in the region of the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] and [[Japan]], maximum ice extent decreased from 1.3 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 1983 to 0.85 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 1984, a decrease of 35%, before rebounding the following year to 1.2 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="gloersen"/&gt; The regional fluctuations in both hemispheres are such that for any several-year period of the [[satellite]] record some regions exhibit decreasing ice coverage while others exhibit increasing ice cover.&lt;ref name="parkinson1995"&gt;Parkinson, C. L., 1995: Recent sea-ice advances in Baffin Bay/Davis Strait and retreats in the Bellinshausen Sea. Annals of Glaciology, 21, 348-352.&lt;/ref&gt; The overall trend indicated in the passive microwave record from 1978 through mid-1995 shows that the extent of [[Arctic sea ice]] is decreasing 2.7% per decade.&lt;ref name="johannessen"&gt;Johannessen, O. M., M. Miles, and E. Bjørgo, 1995: The Arctic’s shrinking sea ice. Nature, 376, 126-127.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent work with the satellite passive-microwave data indicates that from late October 1978 through the end of 1996 the extent of [[Arctic]] [[sea ice]] decreased by 2.9% per decade while the extent of [[Antarctic]] [[sea ice]] increased by 1.3% per decade.&lt;ref name="cavalieri"&gt;Cavalieri, D.

=== Lake ice and river ice ===
[[Ice]] forms on [[rivers]] and [[lake]]s in response to seasonal cooling. The sizes of the ice bodies involved are too small to exert other than localized climatic effects. However, the freeze-up/break-up processes respond to large-scale and local weather factors, such that considerable interannual variability exists in the dates of appearance and disappearance of the ice. Long series of lake-ice observations can serve as a proxy climate record, and the monitoring of freeze-up and break-up trends may provide a convenient integrated and seasonally specific index of climatic perturbations. Information on river-ice conditions is less useful as a climatic proxy because ice formation is strongly dependent on river-flow regime, which is affected by precipitation, snow melt, and watershed runoff as well as being subject to human interference that directly modifies channel flow, or that indirectly affects the runoff via land-use practices.

[[Lake]] freeze-up depends on the heat storage in the lake and therefore on its depth, the rate and temperature of any [[inflow (hydrology)|inflow]], and water-air energy fluxes. Information on lake depth is often unavailable, although some indication of the depth of shallow lakes in the [[Arctic]] can be obtained from airborne [[radar imagery]] during late winter (Sellman ''et al.'' 1975) and spaceborne optical imagery during summer (Duguay and Lafleur 1997). The timing of breakup is modified by snow depth on the ice as well as by ice thickness and freshwater inflow.

=== Frozen ground and permafrost ===
Frozen ground (permafrost and seasonally frozen ground) occupies approximately 54 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the exposed land areas of the Northern Hemisphere (Zhang et al., 2003) and therefore has the largest areal extent of any component of the cryosphere. [[Permafrost]] (perennially frozen ground) may occur where mean annual air temperatures (MAAT) are less than -1 or -2&amp;nbsp;°C and is generally continuous where MAAT are less than -7&amp;nbsp;°C. In addition, its extent and thickness are affected by ground moisture content, [[vegetation]] cover, winter snow depth, and aspect. The global extent of permafrost is still not completely known, but it underlies approximately 20% of [[Northern Hemisphere]] land areas. Thicknesses exceed 600 m along the Arctic coast of northeastern Siberia and Alaska, but, toward the margins, permafrost becomes thinner and horizontally discontinuous. The marginal zones will be more immediately subject to any melting caused by a warming trend. Most of the presently existing permafrost formed during previous colder conditions and is therefore relic. However, permafrost may form under present-day polar climates where glaciers retreat or land emergence exposes unfrozen ground. Washburn (1973) concluded that most continuous permafrost is in balance with the present climate at its upper surface, but changes at the base depend on the present climate and geothermal heat flow; in contrast, most discontinuous permafrost is probably unstable or "in such delicate equilibrium that the slightest climatic or surface change will have drastic disequilibrium effects".&lt;ref name="washburn"&gt;Washburn, A. L., 1973: Periglacial processes and environments. Edward
Arnold, London, 320 pp. p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

Under warming conditions, the increasing depth of the summer [[active layer]] has significant impacts on the [[hydrologic]] and [[geomorphic]] regimes. Thawing and retreat of [[permafrost]] have been reported in the upper [[Mackenzie Valley]] and along the southern margin of its occurrence in [[Manitoba]], but such observations are not readily quantified and generalized. Based on average latitudinal gradients of air temperature, an average northward displacement of the southern [[permafrost]] boundary by 50-to-150&amp;nbsp;km could be expected, under equilibrium conditions, for a 1&amp;nbsp;°C warming.

Only a fraction of the permafrost zone consists of actual ground ice. The remainder (dry permafrost) is simply soil or rock at subfreezing temperatures. The ice volume is generally greatest in the uppermost permafrost layers and mainly comprises pore and segregated ice in [[Earth]] material. Measurements of bore-hole temperatures in permafrost can be used as indicators of net changes in temperature regime. Gold and Lachenbruch (1973) infer a 2-4&amp;nbsp;°C warming over 75 to 100 years at [[Cape Thompson]], [[Alaska]], where the upper 25% of the 400-m thick [[permafrost]] is unstable with respect to an equilibrium profile of temperature with depth (for the present mean annual surface temperature of -5&amp;nbsp;°C). [[Maritime climate|Maritime]] influences may have biased this estimate, however. At [[Prudhoe Bay]] similar data imply a 1.8&amp;nbsp;°C warming over the last 100 years (Lachenbruch ''et al.'' 1982). Further complications may be introduced by changes in snow-cover depths and the natural or artificial disturbance of the surface vegetation.

The potential rates of permafrost thawing have been established by Osterkamp (1984) to be two centuries or less for 25-meter-thick permafrost in the discontinuous zone of interior [[Alaska]], assuming warming from -0.4 to 0&amp;nbsp;°C in 3–4 years, followed by a further 2.6&amp;nbsp;°C rise. Although the response of permafrost (depth) to temperature change is typically a very slow process (Osterkamp 1984; Koster 1993), there is ample evidence for the fact that the [[active layer]] thickness quickly responds to a temperature change (Kane ''et al.'' 1991). Whether, under a warming or cooling scenario, global climate change will have a significant effect on the duration of frost-free periods in both regions with seasonally  and perennially frozen ground.

=== Glaciers and ice sheets ===
[[Ice sheet]]s and [[glacier]]s are flowing ice masses that rest on solid land. They are controlled by snow accumulation, surface and basal melt, calving into surrounding oceans or lakes and internal dynamics. The latter results from gravity-driven creep flow ("[[Ice flow dynamics|glacial flow]]") within the ice body and sliding on the underlying land, which leads to thinning and horizontal spreading.&lt;ref name="GreveBlatter2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Greve, R. |author2=Blatter, H. |year=2009|title=Dynamics of Ice Sheets and Glaciers|publisher=Springer|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-03415-2|isbn=978-3-642-03414-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any imbalance of this dynamic equilibrium between mass gain, loss and transport due to flow results in either growing or shrinking ice bodies.

Ice sheets are the greatest potential source of global freshwater, holding approximately 77% of the global total. This corresponds to 80 m of world sea-level equivalent, with [[Antarctica]] accounting for 90% of this. [[Greenland]] accounts for most of the remaining 10%, with other ice bodies and glaciers accounting for less than 0.5%. Because of their size in relation to annual rates of snow accumulation and melt, the residence time of water in ice sheets can extend to 100,000 or 1 million years. Consequently, any climatic perturbations produce slow responses, occurring over glacial and interglacial periods. Valley glaciers respond rapidly to climatic fluctuations with typical response times of 10–50 years.&lt;ref name="oerlemans"&gt;
Oerlemans, J., 1994: Quantifying global warming from the retreat of
glaciers. Science, 264, 243-245.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the response of individual glaciers may be asynchronous to the same climatic forcing because of differences in glacier length, elevation, slope, and speed of motion. Oerlemans (1994) provided evidence of coherent global [[glacier retreat]] which could be explained by a linear warming trend of 0.66&amp;nbsp;°C per 100 years.&lt;ref name="oerlemans"/&gt;

While glacier variations are likely to have minimal effects upon [[global climate]], their recession may have contributed one third to one half of the observed 20th Century rise in sea level (Meier 1984; IPCC 1996). Furthermore, it is extremely likely that such extensive glacier recession as is currently observed in the Western Cordillera of North America,&lt;ref name="pelto"&gt;Pelto, M. S., 1996: Annual net balance of North Cascade Glaciers, 1984-94. J. Glaciology, 42, 3-9.&lt;/ref&gt; where runoff from glacierized basins is used for [[irrigation]] and [[hydropower]], involves significant hydrological and [[ecosystem]] impacts. Effective water-resource planning and impact mitigation in such areas depends upon developing a sophisticated knowledge of the status of glacier ice and the mechanisms that cause it to change. Furthermore, a clear understanding of the mechanisms at work is crucial to interpreting the global-change signals that are contained in the time series of [[glacier mass balance]] records.

Combined [[glacier mass balance]] estimates of the large ice sheets carry an uncertainty of about 20%. Studies based on estimated snowfall and mass output tend to indicate that the ice sheets are near balance or taking some water out of the oceans.&lt;ref name="bentley"&gt;Bentley, C. R., and M. B. Giovinetto, 1991: Mass balance of Antarctica and sea level change. In: G. Weller, C. L. Wilson and B. A. B. Severin (eds.), Polar regions and climate change. University of Alaska, Fairbanks, p. 481-488.&lt;/ref&gt; Marinebased studies &lt;ref name="jacobs"&gt;
Jacobs, S. S., H. H. Helmer, C. S. M. Doake, A. Jenkins, and R. M. Frohlich, 1992: Melting of ice shelves and the mass balance of Antarctica. J. Glaciology, 38, 375-387.&lt;/ref&gt; suggest sea-level rise from the Antarctic or rapid ice-shelf basal melting. Some authors (Paterson 1993; Alley 1997) have suggested that the difference between the observed rate of sea-level rise (roughly 2&amp;nbsp;mm/y) and the explained rate of sea-level rise from melting of mountain glaciers, thermal expansion of the ocean, etc. (roughly 1&amp;nbsp;mm/y or less) is similar to the modeled imbalance in the [[Antarctic]] (roughly 1&amp;nbsp;mm/y of sea-level rise; Huybrechts 1990), suggesting a contribution of sea-level rise from the Antarctic.

Relationships between global climate and changes in ice extent are complex. The mass balance of land-based glaciers and ice sheets is determined by the accumulation of snow, mostly in winter, and warm-season [[ablation]] due primarily to net radiation and turbulent heat fluxes to melting ice and snow from warm-air advection,&lt;ref name="paterson"&gt;

Van den Broeke, M. R., 1996: The atmospheric boundary layer over ice sheets and glaciers. Utrecht, Universitiet Utrecht, 178 pp..&lt;/ref&gt;(Munro 1990). However, most of [[Antarctica]] never experiences surface melting.&lt;ref name="vandenbroeke2"&gt;Van den Broeke, M. R., and R. Bintanja, 1995: The interaction of katabatic wind and the formation of blue ice areas in East Antarctica. J. Glaciology, 41, 395-407&lt;/ref&gt; Where ice masses terminate in the [[ocean]], iceberg [[Ice calving|calving]] is the major contributor to mass loss. In this situation, the ice margin may extend out into deep water as a floating [[ice shelf]], such as that in the [[Ross Sea]]. Despite the possibility that global warming could result in losses to the [[Greenland ice sheet]] being offset by gains to the [[Antarctic ice sheet]],&lt;ref name="ohmura"&gt;Ohmura, A., M. Wild, and L. Bengtsson, 1996: A possible change in mass balance of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets in the coming century. J. Climate, 9, 2124-2135.&lt;/ref&gt; there is major concern about the possibility of a [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]] collapse. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is grounded on bedrock below sea level, and its collapse has the potential of raising the world sea level 6–7 m over a few hundred years.

Most of the discharge of the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]] is via the five major ice streams (faster flowing ice) entering the [[Ross Ice Shelf]], the [[Rutford Ice Stream]] entering [[Ronne-Filchner shelf]] of the [[Weddell Sea]], and the Thwaites Glacier and [[Pine Island Glacier]] entering the [[Amundsen Ice Shelf]]. Opinions differ as to the present mass balance of these systems (Bentley 1983, 1985), principally because of the limited data. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is stable so long as the [[Ross Ice Shelf]] is constrained by drag along its lateral boundaries and pinned by local grounding.

'''Dixon Springs State Park''' is an [[List of Illinois state parks|Illinois state park]] in [[Pope County, Illinois|Pope County]], [[Illinois]], United States, and is one of several [[state parks]] in the [[Shawnee Hill|Illinois Shawnee Hills]].  The park is on a giant block of rock which was dropped {{convert|200|ft}} along a [[Fault (geology)|fault]] that extends northwesterly across [[Pope County, Illinois|Pope County]]. The {{convert|801|acre|sing=on}} park is about {{convert|10|mi}} west of [[Golconda, Illinois|Golconda]] on [[Illinois Route 146]] near its junction with [[Illinois Route 145]].  The first land acquisition was in 1946.

== History ==
The area around the park was occupied by various tribes of [[Algonquins]] who, after the [[Shawnee]] had been driven from [[Tennessee]], had settled near the mouth of the [[Wabash River]]. Dixon Springs was one of their favorite camping grounds and was called "Kitchemuske-nee-be" for the Great Medicine Waters. One of the better known [[Indian American|Indian]] trails, which the early French called the "Grand Trace," passed to the west of the park and south to [[Fort Massac]], then branched out into lesser trails. Much of the "Grand Trace" is [[Illinois Route 145]] and runs nearly all of its length south from [[Harrisburg, Illinois]] through the [[Shawnee National Forest]]. This section of the state was part of an [[Indian reservation]] occupied for a time by about 6,000 [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].  Like the [[American Bison|buffalo]], most of the Indians were gone by the early 1830s.

Dixon Springs takes its name from William Dixon, one of the first white [[settlers]] to build a home in this section, who obtained a school land warrant in 1848 from Governor [[Augustus C. French]].  His cabin was a landmark for many years,{{fact|date=July 2017}} as was an old log church on the adjoining knoll. A small community grew up at Dixon Springs with a [[general store]], [[post office]], [[blacksmith]] shop, [[grist mill]], and several churches. Dixon Springs became a 19th-century health [[destination spa|spa]] which attracted hundreds to the seven springs of mineral-enriched water.  A [[Public bathing|bathhouse]] provided mineral or soft water baths, hot or cold, available at any time.  The natural environment of the area and its stone formations helped to give the park valley a more equable temperature in the summer than most of southern Illinois.{{fact|date=July 2017}}  This made the resort so popular that people came by [[steamboat]] excursions from as far away as [[Paducah, Kentucky]], [[Evansville, Indiana]], and [[Cairo, Illinois|Cairo]] to Golconda.  They then traveled by train to within a couple of miles of the park.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4626">'''Ecological triage''' refers to the decision-making of environmental conservation using the concepts of medical [[triage]]. In medicine, the allocation of resources in an urgent situation is prioritized for those with the greatest need and those who would receive the greatest benefit. Similarly, the two parameters of ecological triage are the level of threat and the probability of recovery. Because there are limitations to resources such as time, money, and manpower, it is important to prioritize specific efforts and distribute resources efficiently. Ecological triage differentiates between areas with an attainable emergent need, those who would benefit from preventative measures, and those that are beyond repair.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hobbs|first=Richard J.|last2=Kristjanson|first2=Linda J.|date=2003-02-01|title=Triage: How do we prioritize health care for landscapes?|journal=Ecological Management &amp; Restoration|language=en|volume=4|pages=S39–S45|doi=10.1046/j.1442-8903.4.s.5.x|issn=1442-8903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
Ecological triage is not simple, dichotomous decision making. It involves an array of complex factors including assumptions, mathematical calculations, and planning for uncertainties. When assessing an ecosystem, there are a myriad of factors conservationists consider, but there are also variables which they are unable to account for. Conservationists and scientists often have incomplete understanding of population dynamics, impacts of external threats, and efficacy of different conservation tactics.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDonald-Madden|first=Eve|last2=Baxter|first2=Peter W.J.|last3=Possingham|first3=Hugh P.|date=2008-12-01|title=Making robust decisions for conservation with restricted money and knowledge|journal=Journal of Applied Ecology|language=en|volume=45|issue=6|pages=1630–1638|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2664.2008.01553.x|issn=1365-2664}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to incorporate these unknowns when assessing a population or ecosystem. By following the principles of triage, we are able to allow for the efficient allocation of resources as conservationists continue to develop the best options for ecological preservation and restoration.

=== Info-Gap Decision Model&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ===
Due to the multitude of variables within a population or ecosystem, it is important to address the unknown factors which may not initially be accounted for. Many ecologists utilize the [[Info-gap decision theory]], which focuses on strategies that are most likely to succeed despite uncertainties. This process is composed of three main elements:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burgman|first=M. A.|last2=Lindenmayer|first2=D. B.|last3=Elith|first3=J.|date=2005-08-01|title=Managing Landscapes for Conservation Under Uncertainty|journal=Ecology|language=en|volume=86|issue=8|pages=2007–2017|doi=10.1890/04-0906|issn=1939-9170|citeseerx=10.1.1.477.4238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Mathematical calculations which assess performance as a result of management.''' This step determines the number of management options, evaluates the existing subpopulations, estimates the management period, and assesses the impact of inaction. 
# '''Expectations of performance.''' To evaluate performance, an extinction-investment curve is utilized. It evaluates data regarding the probability of species extinction (without intervention), budget allocation, and budget required to halve probability of extinction. This step sets forth a threshold below which performance is considered unacceptable. 
# '''A model describing uncertainty.''' The [[Info-gap decision theory#Uncertainty models|uncertainty model]] examines the possible values which may render the extinction-investment curve incorrect. It considers how factors may vary in dynamic situations and creates a function of uncertainty.                              

== Criticisms ==
Some critics of environmental triage believe the process chooses "winners" and "losers" and therefore abandons certain demographics. Other criticism argues that ecological triage allows for the government to justify under-funding environmental programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pannelldiscussions.net/2014/03/262/|title=Pannell Discussions " 262 – Environmental triage|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; By utilizing a formal decision-making model, the government can deem certain projects as a lost cause and choose to withhold funding. Critics and supporters alike stress the necessity of expanding the environmental budget to provide the best conservation and restoration efforts.

The '''energy mix''' is a group of different [[primary energy|primary]] [[Source of energy|energy sources]] from which [[secondary energy]] for direct use - usually [[electricity]] - is [[energy production|produced]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planete-energies.com/en/medias/explanations/about-energy-mix|title=About the Energy Mix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary energy in the form of fossil fuels is nowadays still mostly used directly for [[motor]]-driven [[vehicle]]s, i.e. [[transport]]. Further [[energy conversion]] of the co-produced [[waste heat]] after burning is not possible.

In 2007, the [[World energy consumption|global primary energy use]] corresponded to {{convert|12.5|e6t}} [[oil equivalent]] corresponding to {{convert|145,375|GWh}}). According to the [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA) 13,6% of that was used by the [[EU]]. Within the EU, 75.9% came from [[fossil fuel]]s, 14.1% from [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]], 7% from [[biofuel]]s, 2.9 from [[renewable energy]] resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpb.de/nachschlagen/zahlen-und-fakten/europa/75140/themengrafik-energiemix-nach-staaten|title=Energiemix nach Staaten (Energy mix by country)|language=German|publisher=Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall primary energy consumption in the U.S. in 2015 relied most on [[petroleum]] ([[orders of magnitude (energy)|{{convert|35|e15BTU}}]]), natural gas ({{convert|29|e15BTU|abbr=on}}) and coal ({{convert|16|e15BTU|abbr=on}}). Renewables contributed {{convert|9|e15BTU|abbr=on}} and nuclear power {{convert|8|e15BTU|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=July 21, 2016|title=Changing U.S. energy mix reflects growing use of natural gas, petroleum, and renewables|url=https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=27172|accessdate=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the same year, about 4 million GWh of [[electricity generation|electricity were generated]] in the U.S., 67% of which was generated from fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, and &lt; 1% petroleum), 20% from nuclear power, 6% [[hydropower]] and 7% other renewables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=427&amp;t=3|title=FAQ: What is U.S. electricity generation by energy source?|accessdate=2016-08-15|publisher=[[U.S. Energy Information Administration|EIA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the rise of global [[energy consumption]] with the global [[population growth]] cannot immediately be counteracted, the [[sustainable growth|sustainability of growth]] can partially be improved by changing the energy mix towards renewables. The main forces in this process are national and transnational [[energy policy]] and the [[energy industry]] together with their [[energy lobby|lobbyists]].

The '''European Geosciences Union''' ('''EGU''') is a [[nonprofit organization|non-profit]] [[learned society|international union]] in the fields of [[Earth science|Earth]], [[planetary science|planetary]], and [[space science]]s. The organisation has headquarters in [[Munich]] (Germany). Membership is open to individuals who are professionally engaged in or associated with these fields and related studies, including students and retired seniors.

The EGU publishes 17 [[open-access]] [[scientific journal]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.egu.eu/publications/open-access-journals/ |title=EGU Open Access Peer-Reviewed Journals |publisher=European Geosciences Union |work=Homepage |accessdate=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of other science publications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.egu.eu/publications/other-publications/ |title=Other EGU publications |publisher=European Geosciences Union |work=Homepage |accessdate=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It also organises a number of topical meetings, as well as education and outreach activities. Its most prominent event is the EGU General Assembly, an annual conference that brings together over 14,000 scientists from all over the world. The meeting’s sessions cover a wide range of topics, including [[volcanology]], planetary exploration, the Earth’s internal structure and atmosphere, [[climate change]], and [[renewable energy|renewable energies]].

The EGU has 22 scientific divisions that reflect the interdisciplinary nature of the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.egu.eu/structure/divisions-and-present-officers/ |title=EGU Scientific Divisions and Division Presidents |publisher=European Geosciences Union |work=Homepage |accessdate=2013-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The EGU was established by the merger of the European Geophysical Society (EGS) and the European Union of Geosciences (EUG) on 7 September 2002. Council members of the two organisations came together at Hotel Platzl in Munich, Germany, to sign the Union into existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.egu.eu/newsletter/geoq/04/articles.pdf |title=GeoQ, issue 4: Articles |publisher=European Geosciences Union |work=EGU Newsletter}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final stages of the merger were completed on 31 December 2003.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.egu.eu/about/historical-highlights/ |title=EGU Historical Highlights |publisher=European Geosciences Union |work=Homepage |accessdate=2013-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EGU founding members were: Jan Backman, Jonathan Bamber, Ray Bates, Günter Blöschl, Lars Clemmensen, Max Coleman, Peter Fabian, Gerald Ganssen, Jean-Pierre Gattuso, David Gee, Fausto Guzzetti, Albrecht Hofmann, Jürgen Kurths, Yves Langevin, John Ludden, Arne Richter, Michael Rycroft, W. Schlager, Roland Schlich, Isabella Premovi Silva, Christopher Spotl, Håkan Svedhem, Hans Thybo, Bert Vermeersen, David Webb, Jerzy Weber, Richard Worden. On 12 February 2004, the EGU signed the Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities.

The EGU Executive office moved to [[Munich]] on 1 August 2010, and expanded by hiring six more staff members in addition to the EGU Executive Secretary, Philippe Courtial. In August 2011, the EGU signed an agreement with the [[American Geophysical Union]] (AGU) and with the [[Aisa Oceania Geosciences Society]] (AOGS) with the aim to promote the cooperation between the institutions.

== Conferences and meetings ==
The European Geosciences Union convenes a yearly General Assembly. The first EGU General Assembly took place From 25 to 30 April 2004, in [[Nice]], with the aim to gather together EGU members and other planetary, space and Earth scientists from all around the world. On this occasion the EGU also celebrated researchers for their contribution, with 21 Union and division prizes and medals. The EGU General Assembly moved to Vienna in April 2005 where it has since taken place annually. The assembly is arranged at the [[Austria Center Vienna]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The first EGU co-sponsored geoscience meeting (the first [[Alexander von Humboldt|Alexander van Humbolt]] conference) was held in [[Guayaquil]]. Afterwards, the  co-sponsored programme expanded into conference series, meetings, workshops and training schools. The EGU [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] Conferences cycle started in 2015 when the first call for proposals was launched.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

At the 2017 meeting in [[Vienna]], there were 4,849 oral, 11,312 poster presentations and 1,238 interactive content (PICO) presentations. Over 14,000 scientists from 107 countries participated in the conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.egu2017.eu/ |title=EGU 2017 General Assembly website |publisher=Copernicus |work=Homepage |accessdate=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abstracts of presentations are published in the ''Geophysical Research Abstracts'' (print: {{ISSN|1029-7006}}, online: {{ISSN|1607-7962}}). The 2018 EGU General Assembly hosted 15,075 scientists from 106 countries participated, of which 53% were under the age of 35 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.egu2018.eu/ |title=EGU 2018 General Assembly website |publisher=Copernicus |work=Homepage |accessdate=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 17,000 abstracts were presented at the meeting.

==Publications==
The first EGU newsletter came out in November 2002. The ''Eggs'' magazine became the EGU newsletter after the completing of the merging between EGS and EUG in 2003. The three-monthly newsletter was modernised in late 2012 and both its format and its name were changed in GeoQ. The necessity to gave reports of its activities on a more regular basis, led the EGU to further change its newsletter name (now [[EGU newsletter]]) in January 2015. The actual newsletter is an e-mail version, having a monthly frequency.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2010 the EGU released its official blog,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.egu.eu/|title=EGU Blogs|website=EGU Blogs|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; which soon became a quick-to-read source of information about the EGU activities and on research in the Earth, planetary and space sciences fields. The blog has now grown to include division blogs and network blogs. 

EGU publishes books and other materials available in paper and online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.egu.eu/publications/other-publications/ |title=Other EGU publications |publisher=European Geosciences Union |work=Homepage |accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://static.egu.eu/static/latest/publications/statement/A_short_History_of_Interactive_Open_Access_Publishing.pdf |title=10 Years of Interactive Open Access Publishing - A short History of Interactive Open Access Publishing |publisher=European Geosciences Union |work=Homepage |accessdate=2015-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; the EGU and [[Copernicus Publications]] have published a growing number of [[peer-reviewed]] [[open-access]] [[scientific journal]]s:&lt;ref name="open access publications"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.egu.eu/publications/open-access-journals/ |title=Open Access Peer-Reviewed Journals |publisher=European Geosciences Union |work=Homepage |accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In October 2002 the first EGU journals were published by transferring the property of the EGS publications – ''Advances in Geosciences'' (''ADGEO''), ''[[Annales Geophysicae]]'' (''ANGEO''), ''[[Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics]]'' (''ACP''), ''[[Hydrology and Earth System Sciences]]'' (''HESS''), ''Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences'' (''NHESS'') and ''[[Nonlinear Processes in Geophysics]]'' (''NPG'') – to the EGU. The open access journals ''[[Biogeosciences]]'' (''BG'') and ''[[Ocean Science (journal)|Ocean Sciences]]'' (''OS'') had been launched via [[Copernicus Publications]] in March and November 2004, respectively. In 2005, EGU launched the open access journals ''[[Climate of the Past]]'' (''CP'') and ''eEarth'' in July and October, respectively through Copernicus Publications. The latter was replaced by ''[[Solid Earth (journal)|Solid Earth]]'' journal in 2009. The open access journals ''[[The Cryosphere]]'' (''TC'') and ''[[Geoscientific Model Development]]'' (''GMD'') were released in 2007 via [[Copernicus Publications]]. In June 2007, the EGU launched Imaggeo,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://imaggeo.egu.eu/|title=Imaggeo|website=imaggeo.egu.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; an open access database featuring photos and videos relating geosciences. In August 2008, the ''[[Atmospheric Measurement Techniques]]'' (''AMT'') journal was first published, and the journals ''Solid Earth'' (''SE'') and ''[[Earth System Dynamics]]'' (''ESD'') began publication in February and March 2010 respectively. In 2011, ''[[Geoscientific Instrumentation, Methods and Data Systems]]'' (''GI'') was first published.  On 7 April 2013 the open access journals ''[[Earth Surface Dynamics]]'' (''ESurf'') and ''SOIL'' were launched via Copernicus Publications. In April 2018, EGU launched the open access journal ''[[Geoscience Communication]]'' (''GC'') and the compilation ''[[Encyclopedia of Geosciences]]'' (''EG''), a collection of articles in between traditional review articles and online encyclopediae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.egu.eu/about/historical-highlights/ |title=Historical highlights |publisher=European Geosciences Union |work=Homepage |accessdate=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Explorer 50''', also known as '''IMP-J''' or '''IMP-8''', was a [[NASA]] [[satellite]] launched to study the [[magnetosphere]]. It was the eighth and last in a series of the '''Interplanetary Monitoring Platform'''.&lt;ref name="gunter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/explorer_imp-h.htm|title=IMP H, I, J|work=Gunter's Space Page|publisher=Gunter Dirk Krebs|accessdate=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Launch==
Explorer 50 was launched on 23 October 1973 at 02:26:03 UTC, by a [[Delta (rocket family)|Delta 1604]] [[rocket]] from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral AFS]], [[Florida]].&lt;ref name="jonathan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1873&amp;dat=19731026&amp;id=8m8eAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dskEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=730,3516839|title= Explorer 50 Rockets Into Orbit|work=Daytona Beach Morning Journal|publisher=9B|date=October 26, 1973|accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spacecraft functioned nominally until 7 October 2006. The satellite orbited the [[Earth]] once every 12 days, at an inclination of 28.6 degrees. Its [[perigee]] was 22 [[earth radii]] and [[apogee]] was 45 earth radii.&lt;ref name="nssdc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lib"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lib.cas.cz/space.40/1973/078A.HTM|title=1973-078A - Explorer 50|work=Space 40|publisher=Antonín Vítek|language=Czech|date=2005-09-04|accessdate=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spacecraft and mission==
Explorer 50 was a drum-shaped spacecraft, {{convert|135.6|cm}} across and {{convert|157.4|cm}} [[height]], with [[propulsion]] '''Star-17A''', instrumented for [[Interplanetary space|interplanetary]] and [[magnetotail]] studies of [[cosmic ray]]s, energetic solar particles, [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], and [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s. Its initial orbit was more elliptical than intended, with apogee and perigee distances of about 45 earth radii and 25 earth radii. Its [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] decreased after launch. Its orbital inclination varied between 0° and about 55° with a periodicity of several years. The spacecraft spin axis was normal to the [[ecliptic]] plane, and the spin rate was 22.3 [[rpm]]. The data [[telemetry]] rate was 1600 [[Bits per second|bps]]. The spacecraft was in the [[solar wind]] for 7 to 8 days of every 12 days orbit. 

Telemetry coverage was 90% in the early years, but only 60-70% through most of the 1980s and early 1990s. Coverage returned to the 90% range in the mid to late 1990's. The objectives of the extended Explorer 50 operations were to provide solar wind parameters as input for [[magnetospheric]] studies and as a 1 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] baseline for deep space studies, and to continue solar cycle variation studies with a single set of well-calibrated and understood instruments. In October, 2001, Explorer 50 was terminated as an independent mission. The last useful science data from Explorer 50 was acquired on 7 October 2006.&lt;ref name="nssdc"/&gt;

==Instruments==
* '''MAG''' ('''[[Magnetic Field]]s Experiment'''). This instrument studied of the [[interplanetary space]], [[geomagnetic]] tail, and boundary magnetic fields. The resolution per sensor is ± 0.3 [[Nanotesla|nT]].

* '''GAF''' ('''[[Direct current|DC Electric]] Fields Investigation'''). This instrument utilizes two {{convert|200|ft|m}} wire [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]s to measure DC electric fields in the [[solar wind]] and [[magnetosheath]].

* '''IOF''' ('''[[Alternating current|AC Electric]] and [[Magnetic Field]]s Experiment'''). The plasma wave instrumentation consists of a {{convert|400|ft|m}} tip-to-tip [[dipole]] antenna for electric field measurements (in the S/C spin plane) and a triaxial search coil for magnetic field measurements.&lt;ref name="eo"/&gt;

;Plasma

* '''LAP''' ('''[[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] [[Plasma (physics)|Plasma]] Experiment'''). The instrument consists of a hemispherical plate [[electrostatic]] analyzer for the measurement of [[ion]] and electron distributions. 

* '''IOE''' ('''Low Energy Particles Investigation'''). The instrument consists of a ''Low-Energy Proton and Electron Differential Energy Analyzer'' (''LEPEDA'') and a [[Geiger tube]]. 

'''PLA''' ('''Plasma Faraday Cup Assembly'''). The objective is to study the positive ions and electrons in the [[solar wind]], transition region, and [[magnetotail]]. Parameters derived on a routine basis are [[proton]] [[velocity]], number density, and [[temperature]].&lt;ref name="eo"/&gt;
 
;Energetic particles

* '''EPE''' ('''Energetic Particle Experiment'''). EPE is a solid-state [[telescope]] which measures fluxes of ions in four energy channels ranging from 0.05 [[MeV]] - 0.20 MeV to 2.1 MeV - 4.5 MeV, and [[electron]]s in the ranges 30-90 [[keV]] and 100-200 keV.

* '''EECA''' ('''Electrostatic Energy-Charge Analyzer'''). This instrument consists of 2 detector systems. An ''electrostatic deflection [[spectrometer]]'' (''EDS'') measures the energy per charge of incident ions in several ranges between 100 keV and 1000 keV.

* '''CPME''' ('''Charged Particle Measurement Experiment'''). The instrument is a solid-state [[telescope]] measuring fluxes of protons in 11 energy channels between 0.29 and 140 MeV, and [[alpha particle]]s in 6 channels between 0.64 and 52 MeV/n. Time resolution for the measurement cycle is 10.24 seconds.&lt;ref name="eo"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1926">The '''Fraser Plateau''' is an [[Intermontane Plateaus|intermontane plateau]]. It is one of the main subdivisions of the [[Interior Plateau]] located in the [[British Columbia Interior|Central Interior of British Columbia]].

==Geography==
The region includes the [[Cariboo Plateau]] and [[Chilcotin Plateau]], and the adjoining [[Marble Range|Marble]], [[Clear Range|Clear]] and [[Camelsfoot Range]]s on its southwestern edge.  

It is defined as lying between the [[Bonaparte River]] on its southeast, beyond which is the [[Bonaparte Plateau|Bonaparte or Kamloops Plateau]], part of the [[Thompson Plateau]], and by a line formed by the [[Dean River|Dean]] and [[West Road River]]s on its northwest (the [[Nechako Plateau]] lies to the north of the West Road).  

Also included in the Fraser Plateau are the [[Itcha Range|Itcha]] and [[Ilgachuz Range]]s and the adjoining [[Rainbow Range (Coast Mountains)|Rainbow Range]], which adjoin the [[Coast Mountains]]. 

==Geology==
The Fraser Plateau consists of [[basalt]]ic lava of the [[Chilcotin Group]], a group of related volcanic rocks that is nearly parallel with the Fraser Plateau.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/collection_2007/nrcan-rncan/M44-2007-A5E.pdf Chasm and Dog Creek lithofacies, Chilcotin Group basalt, Bonaparte Lake map area, British Columbia]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Zoroastrianism}}
'''Haurvatat [[Help:IPA/English|/ˈhəʊrvətət/]]''' (Avestan: ''𐬵𐬀𐬎𐬬𐬀𐬙𐬁𐬙‎ {{lang|ae-Latn|haurvatāt}}'') is the [[Avestan language]] word for the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] concept of "wholeness" or "perfection."
In post-Gathic Zoroastrianism,  Haurvatat was the [[Amesha Spenta]] associated with water (''cf.'' ''[[aban|apo]]''), prosperity, and health.

Etymologically, Avestan ''haurvatat'' derives from an [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Indo-Iranian]] root and is linguistically related to [[Vedic Sanskrit]] ''sarvatāt'' "intactness, perfection". The Indo-Iranian root has in turn [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] origins. In [[Common Era]] Zoroastrian tradition, Haurvatat appears as [[Middle Persian]] ''Hordad'', continuing in [[Persian language|New Persian]] as ''Khordad''. The [[Iranian calendar|Iranian civil calendar]] of 1925, which adopted [[Zoroastrian calendar]] month names, has ''Khordad'' as the name of the 3rd month of the year.&lt;!-- Contrary to folk etymology, ''khordad'' is not related to ''khorshid'', which derives (via Middle Persian ''khwarshed'') from Avestan [[Hvare-khshaeta]] "radiant sun." --&gt; 

The Avestan language noun ''haurvatat'' is grammatically feminine and in scripture the divinity Haurvatat is a female entity. However, in tradition (K)Hordad was/is considered male; this development is attributed to the loss of grammatical gender in Middle Persian. In ''Isis and Osiris'' 46, [[Plutarch]] translates Haurvatat as Πλοῦτος ''ploutos'' "wealth, riches" and equates the divinity with "[[Plutus]]," the Greek god of riches.

==Scripture==
===Gathas===
Like the other [[Amesha Spenta]]s also, Haurvatat is already attested in the [[Gathas]], the oldest texts of the Zoroastrianism and considered to have been composed by [[Zoroaster]] himself. And like most other principles, Haurvatat is not unambiguously an entity in those hymns. Unlike four of the other Amesha Spentas, Haurvatat does not have a standing epithet that in later Avesta texts becomes an element of her proper name.

Already in the Gathas, Haurvatat is closely allied with [[Ameretat]], the Amesha Spenta of "Immortality". Addressing [[Ahura Mazda]] in ''[[Yasna]]'' 34.11, the prophet [[Zoroaster]] exclaims that "both Wholeness and Immortality are for sustenance" in the Kingdom of God. In the same verse, as also in ''Yasna'' 45.10 and 51.7, parallels are drawn between Ameretat and Haurvatat on the one hand and "endurance and strength" on the other.

===Younger Avesta===
The relationship between Ameretat and Haurvatat is carries forward into the Younger Avesta (''[[Yasna]]'' 1.2; 3.1; 4.1; 6.17; 7.26; 8.1 etc.; ''[[Yasht]]'' 1.15; 10.92). The Younger Avestan texts allude to their respective guardianships of plant life and water (comparable with the Gathic allusion to sustenence), but these identifications are only properly developed in later tradition (see below). These associations with also reflect the Zoroastrian cosmological model in which each of the Amesha Spentas is identified with one aspect of creation.

The antithetical counterpart of Haurvatat is demon (''[[daeva]]'') ''Tarshna'' "thirst," while Ameretat's is ''Shud'' "hunger." Ameretat and Haurvatat are the only two Amesha Spentas who are not already assigned an antithetical counterpart in the Gathas. In the eschatological framework of ''Yasht'' 1.25, Ameretat and Haurvatat represent the reward of the righteous after death (''cf.'' [[Ashi]] and ''[[ashavan]]''). Haurvatat and Ameretat will destroy the demons of hunger and thirst at the final renovation of the world (''Yasht'' 19.95-96).

Unlike Ameretat, Haurvatat has a ''Yasht'' consecrated to her (''Yasht 4''), and is invoked as the protector of the seasons and years (''Yasht'' 4.0, ''Siroza'' 1.6, 2.6&lt;!-- dhalla 172 --&gt;). In ''Yasht'' 4.1, Haurvatat is described as having been created by [[Ahura Mazda]] for "the help, joy, comfort, and pleasure of the ''[[ashavan]]''." The righteous can put demons to flight by invoking the name of Haurvatat (''Yasht'' 4.2). In ''Yasht'' 4.4, Haurvatat is implored to give mankind the power to withstand the seductive attacks of the ''Pairikas'', the devilish sprites of [[Angra Mainyu]].

==Tradition==
&lt;!-- and into the texts of Zoroastrian tradition where Ameretat is characterized as the guardian of plant life and Haurvatat is the guardian of water. --&gt;
Through the association with plants and water, Ameretat (MP: ''Amurdad'') and Haurvatat (MP: ''Hordad'') are consequently identified with food and drink (''cf.'' sustenance in the Gathas, above), and traditionally it was out of respect for these two Amesha Spentas (MP: ''Ameshaspand'') that meals were to be taken in silence. In ''[[Book of Arda Viraf]]'' 23.6–8, the righteous Viraz sees a man punished in hell "for consuming Hordad and Amurdad while unlawfully chattering while he chewed."

In the ''[[Bundahishn]]'', a Zoroastrian account of creation completed in the 12th century, Ameretat and Haurvatat appear—together with [[Armaiti|Spenta Armaiti]] (MP: ''Spendarmad''), the third female Amesha Spenta—on the left hand of Ahura Mazda (''Bundahishn'' 26.8). Throughout Zoroastrian scripture and tradition, these three principles are most consistently identified with the creations that they represent: respectively plant life, water, and earth.  In ''Arda Viraf'' 35.13, the three daughters of [[Zoroaster]] are described to be in the image of Armaiti, Ameretat, and Haurvatat. 

In the hierarchy of [[yazata|''yazata''s]], Haurvatat has as her assistants or cooperators (''hamkars'') three lesser ''yazata''s: ''[[Vata-Vayu]]'' of the wind and atmosphere, ''Manthra Spenta'' of "bountiful spells" and the [[Fravashi]]s, the hordes of guardian spirits.

In the day-name and month-name dedications of the [[Zoroastrian calendar]] (that makes the basis for the [[Jalali calendar]]), the sixth day of the month and third month of the year are named after Haurvatat/Hordad/Khordad/Xordad and are under her protection. The [[Iranian calendar|Iranian civil calendar]] of 1925 reinstated Zoroastrian month-name conventions and hence also has ''Khordad''  as the third month of the year, beginning at May 22 (21. in leap years). This calendar is thus the one with which western astrology is most accurately corresponding. Khordad confers exactly with [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]], the passage of the [[sun]] through the [[ecliptic]]al segment of 60 - 90 degrees from [[vernal equinox]].

==Religiosity==
Haurvatat-Ameretat ([[Pahlavi script|Pahlavi]] ''hrwdʼd'' ''ʼmwrdʼd'') appears in [[Sogdian language]] texts&lt;!-- Manichean? Buddhist? --&gt; as ''hrwwt mrwwt''. A relationship to [[Armenian language|Armenian]] ''hawrot'' ''mawrot'' has been suggested but is not confirmed. According to Islam tradition, Al-Quran mentions two entities sent to Babil (Babylon) named Harut and Marut, to test people faith because they teach witchcraft and sorcery. These entities stated that they were sent to test the faith of the people before teaching them.

{{Thermodynamics|expanded=Potentials}}

In [[thermodynamics]], the '''internal energy''' of a [[thermodynamic system|system]] is the [[energy]] contained within the system, excluding the [[kinetic energy]] of motion, of the system as a whole and the potential energy of the system as a whole due to external force fields. It keeps account of the gains and losses of energy of the system that are due to changes in its internal state.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, F. H. (1963), pp. 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haase, R. (1971), pp. 24–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The internal energy of a system can be changed by transfers of [[matter]] or [[heat transfer|heat]] or by doing [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]].&lt;ref name="Born 146"&gt;[[Max Born|Born, M.]] (1949), Appendix 8, [https://archive.org/stream/naturalphilosoph032159mbp#page/n157/mode/2up pp. 146–149].&lt;/ref&gt; When matter transfer is prevented by impermeable containing walls, the system is said to be [[Closed system|closed]]. Then the [[first law of thermodynamics]] states that the increase in internal energy is equal to the total heat added plus the work done on the system by its surroundings. If the containing walls pass neither matter nor energy, the system is said to be isolated and its internal energy cannot change. The first law of thermodynamics may be regarded as establishing the existence of the internal energy.

The internal energy is one of the two cardinal [[state function]]s of the state variables of a [[thermodynamic system]].

==Introduction==

The internal energy of a given state of a system cannot be directly measured. It is determined through some convenient chain of [[thermodynamic operation]]s and [[thermodynamic process]]es by which the given state can be prepared, starting with a reference state which is customarily assigned a reference value for its internal energy. Such a chain, or path, can be theoretically described by certain [[Thermodynamics#States and processes|extensive]] state variables of the system, namely, its [[entropy]], {{math|''S''}}, its volume, {{math|''V''}}, and its mole numbers, {{math|{''N&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}}}. The internal energy, {{math|''U''(''S'',''V'',{''N&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''})}}, is a function of those. Sometimes, to that list are appended other extensive state variables, for example [[electric dipole moment]]. For practical considerations in thermodynamics and engineering it is rarely necessary or convenient to consider all energies belonging to the total intrinsic energy of a system, such as the energy given by the equivalence of mass. Customarily, thermodynamic descriptions include only items relevant to the processes under study. Thermodynamics is chiefly concerned only with ''changes'' in the internal energy, not with its absolute value.

The internal energy is a state function of a system, because its value depends only on the current state of the system and not on the path taken or processes undergone to prepare it. It is an [[extensive quantity]]. It is the one and only ''cardinal'' [[thermodynamic potential]].&lt;ref name ="Tschoegl 17"/&gt; Through it, by use of [[Legendre transformation|Legendre transforms]], are mathematically constructed the other thermodynamic potentials. These are functions of variable lists in which some extensive variables are replaced by their [[Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|conjugate]] [[Thermodynamics#States and processes|intensive variables]]. Legendre transformation is necessary because mere substitutive replacement of extensive variables by intensive variables does not lead to thermodynamic potentials. Mere substitution leads to a less informative formula, an equation of state.

Though it is a [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] quantity, internal energy can be explained in microscopic terms by two theoretical virtual components. One is the microscopic kinetic energy due to the microscopic motion of the system's particles ([[translation (physics)|translations]], [[rotation]]s, [[oscillation|vibrations]]). The other is the potential energy associated with the microscopic forces, including the [[chemical bonds]], between the particles; this is for ordinary physics and chemistry. If thermonuclear reactions are specified as a topic of concern, then the static [[mass-energy equivalence|rest mass energy]] of the constituents of matter is also counted. There is no simple universal relation between these quantities of microscopic energy and the quantities of energy gained or lost by the system in work, heat, or matter transfer.

The [[SI]] unit of [[energy]] is the [[joule]] (J). Sometimes it is convenient to use a corresponding density called ''specific internal energy'' which is internal energy per unit of mass ([[kilogram]]) of the system in question. The SI unit of specific internal energy is J/kg.  If the specific internal energy is expressed relative to units of [[amount of substance]] ([[Mole (unit)|mol]]), then it is referred to as ''molar internal energy'' and the unit is J/mol.

From the standpoint of [[statistical mechanics]], the internal energy is equal to the [[ensemble average]] of the sum of the microscopic kinetic and potential energies of the system.

===Cardinal functions===

The internal energy, {{math|''U''(''S'',''V'',{''N&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''})}}, expresses the thermodynamics of a system in the ''energy-language'', or in the ''energy representation''. Its arguments are exclusively extensive variables of state. Alongside the internal energy, the other cardinal function of state of a thermodynamic system is its entropy, as a function, {{math|''S''(''U'',''V'',{''N&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''})}}, of the same list of extensive variables of state, except that the entropy, {{math|''S''}}, is replaced in the list by the internal energy, {{math|''U''}}. It expresses the ''entropy representation''.&lt;ref name ="Tschoegl 17"&gt;Tschoegl, N.W. (2000), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Callen Ch 5"&gt;[[Herbert Callen|Callen, H.B.]] (1960/1985), Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Münster, A. (1970), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each cardinal function is a monotonic function of each of its ''natural'' or ''canonical'' variables. Each provides its ''characteristic'' or ''fundamental'' equation, for example {{math|''U'' {{=}} ''U''(''S'',''V'',{''N&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''})}}, that by itself contains all thermodynamic information about the system. The fundamental equations for the two cardinal functions can in principle be interconverted by solving, for example, {{math|''U'' {{=}} ''U''(''S'',''V'',{''N&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''})}} for {{math|''S''}}, to get {{math|''S'' {{=}} ''S''(''U'',''V'',{''N&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''})}}.

In contrast, Legendre transforms are necessary to derive fundamental equations for other thermodynamic potentials and [[Massieu function]]s. The entropy as a function only of extensive state variables is the one and only ''cardinal function'' of state for the generation of Massieu functions. It is not itself customarily designated a 'Massieu function', though rationally it might be thought of as such, corresponding to the term 'thermodynamic potential', which includes the internal energy.&lt;ref name="Callen Ch 5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Münster, A. (1970), Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, M. (1994), pp. 206–209.&lt;/ref&gt;

For real and practical systems, explicit expressions of the fundamental equations are almost always unavailable, but the functional relations exist in principle. Formal, in principle, manipulations of them are valuable for the understanding of thermodynamics.

==Description and definition==
The internal energy {{math|''U''}} of a given state of the system is determined relative to that of a standard state of the system, by adding up the macroscopic transfers of energy that accompany a change of state from the reference state to the given state:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta U = \sum_i  E_i\,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|Δ''U''}} denotes the difference between the internal energy of the given state and that of the reference state,
and the {{math|''E&lt;sub&gt;i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the various energies transferred to the system in the steps from the reference state to the given state.
It is the energy needed to create the given state of the system from the reference state.

From a non-relativistic microscopic point of view, it may be divided into microscopic potential energy, {{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;micro pot&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and microscopic kinetic energy, {{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;micro kin&lt;/sub&gt;}}, components:
:&lt;math&gt;U = U_{\mathrm{micro\,pot}} + U_{\mathrm{micro\,kin}}&lt;/math&gt;

The microscopic kinetic energy of a system arises as the sum of the motions of all the system's particles with respect to the center-of-mass frame, whether it be the motion of atoms, molecules, atomic nuclei, electrons, or other particles. The microscopic potential energy algebraic summative components are those of the [[Chemical energy|chemical]] and [[Nuclear potential energy|nuclear]] particle bonds, and the physical force fields within the system, such as due to internal [[electrostatic induction|induced]] electric or [[magnetism|magnetic]] [[dipole]] [[moment (physics)|moment]], as well as the energy of [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]] of solids ([[stress (physics)|stress]]-[[strain (materials science)|strain]]). Usually, the split into microscopic kinetic and potential energies is outside the scope of macroscopic thermodynamics.

Internal energy does not include the energy due to motion or location of a system as a whole. That is to say, it excludes any kinetic or potential energy the body may have because of its motion or location in external [[gravitation]]al, [[electrostatics|electrostatic]], or [[electromagnetics|electromagnetic]] [[field (physics)|field]]s. It does, however, include the contribution of such a field to the energy due to the coupling of the internal degrees of freedom of the object with the field. In such a case, the field is included in the thermodynamic description of the object in the form of an additional external parameter.

For practical considerations in thermodynamics or engineering, it is rarely necessary, convenient, nor even possible, to consider all energies belonging to the total intrinsic energy of a sample system, such as the energy given by the equivalence of mass. Typically, descriptions only include components relevant to the system under study.  Indeed, in most systems under consideration, especially through thermodynamics, it is impossible to calculate the total internal energy.&lt;ref name=klotz&gt;I. Klotz, R. Rosenberg, ''Chemical Thermodynamics - Basic Concepts and Methods'', 7th ed., Wiley (2008), p.39&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a convenient null reference point may be chosen for the internal energy.

The internal energy is an [[extensive variable|extensive property]]: it depends on the size of the system, or on the [[amount of substance]] it contains.

At any temperature greater than [[absolute zero]], microscopic potential energy and kinetic energy are constantly converted into one another, but the sum remains constant in an [[isolated system]] (cf. table). In the classical picture of thermodynamics, kinetic energy vanishes at zero temperature and the internal energy is purely potential energy. However, quantum mechanics has demonstrated that even at zero temperature particles maintain a residual energy of motion, the [[zero point energy]]. A system at absolute zero is merely in its quantum-mechanical ground state, the lowest energy state available. At absolute zero a system of given composition has attained its minimum attainable [[entropy]].

The microscopic kinetic energy portion of the internal energy gives rise to the temperature of the system. [[Statistical mechanics]] relates the pseudo-random kinetic energy of individual particles to the mean kinetic energy of the entire ensemble of particles comprising a system. Furthermore, it relates the mean microscopic kinetic energy to the macroscopically observed empirical property that is expressed as temperature of the system. This energy is often referred to as the ''thermal energy'' of a system,&lt;ref name=hyperphysics&gt;[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/kinetic/eqpar.html#c2 Thermal energy] – Hyperphysics&lt;/ref&gt; relating this energy, like the temperature, to the human experience of hot and cold.

Statistical mechanics considers any system to be statistically distributed across an ensemble of ''N'' [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]. Each microstate has an energy ''E''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and is associated with a probability ''p''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. The internal energy is the [[mean]] value of the system's total energy, i.e., the sum of all microstate energies, each weighted by their probability of occurrence:
:&lt;math&gt;U = \sum_{i=1}^N p_i \,E_i\ .&lt;/math&gt;
This is the statistical expression of the [[first law of thermodynamics]].

===Internal energy changes===
{| align="right" border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0
|-
|{{table of thermodynamic systems}}
|}
Thermodynamics is chiefly concerned only with the changes, {{math|Δ''U''}}, in internal energy.

For a closed system, with matter transfer excluded, the changes in internal energy are due to heat transfer {{math|''Q''}} and due to work. The latter can be split into two kinds, pressure-volume work {{math|''W''&lt;sub&gt;pressure-volume&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and frictional and other kinds, such as [[electrical polarization]], which do not alter the volume of the system, and are called isochoric, {{math|''W''&lt;sub&gt;isochoric&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Accordingly, the internal energy change {{math|Δ''U''}} for a process may be written&lt;ref name="Born 146"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta U = Q + W_{\mathrm{pressure-volume}} + W_{\mathrm{isochoric}}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\mathrm{(closed\,\,system,\,\,no\,\,transfer\,\,of\,\,matter)}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=signconvention group=note&gt;In this article we choose the sign convention of the mechanical work as typically defined in chemistry, which is different from the convention used in physics. In chemistry, work performed by the system against the environment, e.g., a system expansion, is negative, while in physics this is taken to be positive.&lt;/ref&gt;

When a closed system receives energy as heat, this energy increases the internal energy. It is distributed between microscopic kinetic and microscopic potential energies. In general, thermodynamics does not trace this distribution.  In an ideal gas all of the extra energy results in a temperature increase, as it is stored solely as microscopic kinetic energy; such heating is said to be ''[[Sensible heat|sensible]]''.

A second mechanism of change of internal energy of a closed system is the doing of [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] on the system, either in mechanical form by changing pressure or volume, or by other perturbations, such as directing an electric current through the system.

If the system is not closed, the third mechanism that can increase the internal energy is transfer of matter into the system. This increase, {{math|Δ''U''&lt;sub&gt;matter&lt;/sub&gt;}} cannot be split into heat and work components. If the system is so set up physically that heat and work can be done on it by pathways separate from and independent of matter transfer, then the transfers of energy add to change the internal energy:
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta U = Q + W_{\mathrm{pressure-volume}} + W_{\mathrm{isochoric}} + \Delta U_{\mathrm{matter}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{(separate\,\,pathway\,\,for\,\,matter\,\,transfer\,\,from\,\,heat\,\,and\,\,work\,\,transfer\,\,pathways)}.&lt;/math&gt;

If a system undergoes certain phase transformations while being heated, such as melting and vaporization, it may be observed that the temperature of the system does not change until the entire sample has completed the transformation. The energy introduced into the system while the temperature did not change is called a ''latent energy'', or [[latent heat]], in contrast to sensible heat, which is associated with temperature change.

==Internal energy of the ideal gas==
Thermodynamics often uses the concept of the [[ideal gas]] for teaching purposes, and as an approximation for working systems. The ideal gas is a gas of particles considered as point objects that interact only by elastic collisions and fill a volume such that their free mean path between collisions is much larger than their diameter. Such systems are approximated by the [[monatomic]] gases, [[helium]] and the other [[noble gas]]es. Here the kinetic energy consists only of the [[translation (physics)|translational]] energy of the individual atoms. Monatomic particles do not rotate or vibrate, and are not [[energy level|electronically excited]] to higher energies except at very high [[temperature]]s.

Therefore, internal energy changes in an ideal gas may be described solely by changes in its kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is simply the internal energy of the perfect gas and depends entirely on its [[pressure]], [[volume]] and [[thermodynamic temperature]].

The internal energy of an ideal gas is proportional to its mass (number of moles) ''n'' and to its temperature ''T''
: &lt;math&gt; U = c n T, &lt;/math&gt;

where  ''c'' is the heat capacity (at constant volume) of the gas. The internal energy may be written as a function of the three extensive properties ''S'', ''V'', ''n'' (entropy, volume, mass) in the following way &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=van Gool |first1=W. |last2=Bruggink |first2=J.J.C. (Eds) |url= |title=Energy and time in the economic and physical sciences |publisher=North-Holland |year=1985 |pages=41–56 |quote= |isbn=0444877487}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Grubbström | first1 = Robert W. | doi = 10.1016/j.apenergy.2007.01.003 | title = An Attempt to Introduce Dynamics Into Generalised Exergy Considerations| journal = Applied Energy| volume = 84| pages = 701–718 | year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;U(S,V,n) = \mathrm{const}  \cdot  e^\frac{S}{cn}    V^\frac{-R}{c}  n^\frac{R+c}{c},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''const'' is an arbitrary positive constant and where ''R'' is the [[Gas constant|universal gas constant]]. It is easily seen that ''U'' is a linearly [[homogeneous function]] of the three variables (that is, it is ''extensive'' in these variables), and that it is weakly [[convex function|convex]]. Knowing temperature and pressure to be the derivatives 
&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{\partial U}{\partial S},&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;p = -\frac{\partial U}{\partial V},&lt;/math&gt; the [[ideal gas law]] &lt;math&gt;PV = nRT&lt;/math&gt; immediately follows.

==Internal energy of a closed thermodynamic system==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
This above summation of all components of change in internal energy assume that a positive energy denotes heat added to the system or work done on the system, while a negative energy denotes work of the system on the environment.

Typically this relationship is expressed in [[infinitesimal]] terms using the differentials of each term. Only the internal energy is an [[exact differential]]. For a system undergoing only thermodynamics processes, i.e. a closed system that can exchange only heat and work, the change in the internal energy is
:&lt;math&gt; d U = \delta Q + \delta W \, &lt;/math&gt;
which constitutes the [[first law of thermodynamics]].&lt;ref name=signconvention group=note/&gt; It may be expressed in terms of other thermodynamic parameters. Each term is composed of an [[intensive variable]] (a generalized force) and its [[Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|conjugate]] infinitesimal [[extensive variable]] (a generalized displacement).

For example, for a non-viscous fluid, the mechanical work done on the system may be related to the [[pressure]] ''p'' and [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]] ''V''. The pressure is the intensive generalized force, while the volume is the extensive generalized displacement:
:&lt;math&gt;\delta W = - p \mathrm{d}V\,&lt;/math&gt;.
This defines the direction of work, ''W'', to be energy flow from the working system to the surroundings, indicated by a negative term.&lt;ref name=signconvention group=note/&gt; Taking the direction of heat transfer ''Q'' to be into the working fluid and assuming a [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible process]], the heat is
:&lt;math&gt;\delta Q = T \mathrm{d}S\,&lt;/math&gt;.
::&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is [[temperature]]
::&lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is [[entropy]]

and the change in internal energy becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U = T\mathrm{d}S-p\mathrm{d}V \!&lt;/math&gt;

===Changes due to temperature and volume===
The expression relating changes in internal energy to changes in temperature and volume is
:&lt;math&gt;dU =C_{V}dT +\left[T\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial T}\right)_{V}  - p\right]dV\,\,\text{   (1)}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

This is useful if the [[equation of state]] is known.

In case of an ideal gas, we can derive that &lt;math&gt;dU = C_V dT&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the internal energy of an ideal gas can be written as a function that depends only on the temperature.

{{hidden begin|border=1px solid lightgray; width: 60%;|title=Proof of pressure independence for an ideal gas}}

The expression relating changes in internal energy to changes in temperature and volume is

:&lt;math&gt;dU =C_{V}dT +\left[T\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial T}\right)_{V}  - p\right]dV.\,&lt;/math&gt;

The equation of state is the ideal gas law

:&lt;math&gt;p V = n R T.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Solve for pressure:

:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{n R T}{V}.&lt;/math&gt;

Substitute in to internal energy expression:

:&lt;math&gt;dU =C_{V}dT +\left[T\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial T}\right)_{V}  - \frac{n R T}{V}\right]dV.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Take the derivative of pressure with respect to temperature:

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{\partial p}{\partial T} \right)_{V} = \frac{n R}{V}.&lt;/math&gt;

Replace:

:&lt;math&gt;dU = C_{V}dT + \left[ \frac{n R T}{V}  - \frac{n R T}{V} \right] dV.&lt;/math&gt;

And simplify:

:&lt;math&gt;dU =C_{V}dT.\,&lt;/math&gt;

{{hidden end}}

{{hidden begin|border=1px solid lightgray; width: 60%;|title=Derivation of dU in terms of dT and dV}}
To express dU in terms of dT and dV, the term

:&lt;math&gt;dS = \left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}\right)_{V}dT + \left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial V}\right)_{T}dV \,&lt;/math&gt;

is substituted in the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]]

:&lt;math&gt;dU = T dS - p dV.\,&lt;/math&gt;

This gives:

:&lt;math&gt;dU = T\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}\right)_{V}dT +\left[T\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial V}\right)_{T} - p\right]dV.\,&lt;/math&gt;

The term &lt;math&gt;T\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}\right)_{V}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Specific heat capacity#Heat capacity of compressible bodies|heat capacity at constant volume]] &lt;math&gt;C_{V}.&lt;/math&gt;

The partial derivative of ''S'' with respect to ''V'' can be evaluated if the equation of state is known.  From the fundamental thermodynamic relation, it follows that the differential of the [[Helmholtz free energy]] A is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;dA = -S dT - p dV.\,&lt;/math&gt;

The [[symmetry of second derivatives]] of ''A'' with respect to ''T'' and ''V'' yields the [[Maxwell relation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial V}\right)_{T} = \left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial T}\right)_{V}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

This gives the expression above.
{{hidden end}}

===Changes due to temperature and pressure===
When dealing with fluids or solids, an expression in terms of the temperature and pressure is usually more useful:

:&lt;math&gt;dU = \left(C_{p}-\alpha p V\right)dT +\left(\beta_{T}p-\alpha T\right)Vdp\,&lt;/math&gt;

where it is assumed that the heat capacity at constant pressure is [[Relations between specific heats|related]] to the heat capacity at constant volume according to:

:&lt;math&gt;C_{p} = C_{V} + V T\frac{\alpha^{2}}{\beta_{T}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

{{hidden begin|border=1px solid lightgray; width: 60%;|title=Derivation of dU in terms of dT and dP}}
The partial derivative of the pressure with respect to temperature at constant volume can be expressed in terms of the [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] 
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \equiv \frac{1}{V}\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_{p}\,&lt;/math&gt;

and the isothermal [[compressibility]]

:&lt;math&gt;\beta_{T} \equiv -\frac{1}{V}\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial p}\right)_{T}\,&lt;/math&gt;

by writing:

:&lt;math&gt;dV = \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial p}\right)_{T}dp + \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_{p} dT = V\left(\alpha dT-\beta_{T}dp \right)\,\,\text{  (2)} \,&lt;/math&gt;

and equating dV to zero and solving for the ratio dp/dT. This gives:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial T}\right)_{V}= -\frac{\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_{p}}{\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial p}\right)_{T}}= \frac{\alpha}{\beta_{T}}\,\,\text{   (3)}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting (2) and (3) in (1) gives the above expression.
{{hidden end}}

===Changes due to volume at constant temperature===
The [[internal pressure]] is defined as a [[partial derivative]] of the internal energy with respect to the volume at constant temperature:
:&lt;math&gt; \pi _T  = \left ( \frac{\partial U}{\partial V} \right )_T  &lt;/math&gt;

==Internal energy of multi-component systems==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
In addition to including the entropy ''S'' and volume ''V'' terms in the internal energy, a system is often described also in terms of the number of particles or chemical species it contains:

:&lt;math&gt;U = U(S,V,N_1,\ldots,N_n)\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''N''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; are the molar amounts of constituents of type ''j'' in the system. The internal energy is an [[extensive variable|extensive]] function of the extensive variables ''S'', ''V'', and the amounts ''N''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, the internal energy may be written as a linearly [[homogeneous function]] of first degree:
: &lt;math&gt;U(\alpha S,\alpha V,\alpha N_{1},\alpha N_{2},\ldots )
 = \alpha U(S,V,N_{1},N_{2},\ldots)\,&lt;/math&gt;
where &amp;alpha; is a factor describing the growth of the system. The differential internal energy may be written as
: 
&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d} U = \frac{\partial U}{\partial S}  \mathrm{d} S  + \frac{\partial U}{\partial V} \mathrm{d} V + \sum_i\ \frac{\partial U}{\partial N_i} \mathrm{d} N_i\ = T \,\mathrm{d} S - p \,\mathrm{d} V + \sum_i\mu_i \mathrm{d} N_i\,&lt;/math&gt;

which shows (or defines) temperature ''T'' to be the partial derivative of ''U'' with respect to entropy ''S'' and pressure ''p'' to be the negative of the similar derivative with respect to volume ''V''
:
&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{\partial U}{\partial S},&lt;/math&gt;
:
&lt;math&gt;p = -\frac{\partial U}{\partial V},&lt;/math&gt;

and where the coefficients &lt;math&gt;\mu_{i}&lt;/math&gt; are the [[chemical potential]]s for the components of type i in the system. The chemical potentials are defined as the partial derivatives of the energy with respect to the variations in composition:
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_i = \left( \frac{\partial U}{\partial N_i} \right)_{S,V, N_{j \ne i}}&lt;/math&gt;
As conjugate variables to the composition &lt;math&gt;\lbrace N_{j} \rbrace&lt;/math&gt;, the chemical potentials are [[intensive and extensive properties|intensive properties]], intrinsically characteristic of the qualitative nature of the system, and not proportional to its extent. Under conditions of constant ''T'' and ''p'', because of the extensive nature of U and its independent variables, using [[Homogeneous function|Euler's homogeneous function theorem]], the differential d''U'' may be integrated and yields an expression for the internal energy:
:&lt;math&gt;U = T S - p V + \sum_i \mu_i N_i\,&lt;/math&gt;.

The sum over the composition of the system is the [[Gibbs free energy]]:
:&lt;math&gt;G = \sum_i \mu_i N_i\,&lt;/math&gt;
that arises from changing the composition of the system at constant temperature and pressure. For a single component system, the chemical potential equals the Gibbs energy per amount of substance, i.e. particles or moles according to the original definition of the unit for &lt;math&gt;\lbrace N_{j} \rbrace&lt;/math&gt;.

==Internal energy in an elastic medium==
For an [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] medium the mechanical energy term of the internal energy must be replaced by the more general expression involving the [[Stress (physics)|stress]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; and strain &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;. The infinitesimal statement is:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U=T\mathrm{d}S+V\sigma_{ij}\mathrm{d}\varepsilon_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

where [[Einstein notation]] has been used for the tensors, in which there is a summation over all repeated indices in the product term. 
The Euler theorem yields for the internal energy:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;U=TS+\frac{1}{2}\sigma_{ij}\varepsilon_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

For a linearly elastic material, the stress is related to the strain by:

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij}=C_{ijkl} \varepsilon_{kl}&lt;/math&gt;
where the ''C''&lt;sub&gt;ijkl&lt;/sub&gt; are the components of the 4th-rank elastic constant tensor of the medium.

==History==
[[James Prescott Joule|James Joule]] studied the relationship between heat, work, and temperature. He observed that if he did mechanical work on a fluid, such as water, by agitating the fluid, its temperature increased. He proposed that the mechanical work he was doing on the system was converted to ''[[thermal energy]]''. Specifically, he found that 4185.5 joules of energy were needed to raise the temperature of a kilogram of water by one degree Celsius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Joule|first=J.P.|authorlink=James Prescott Joule|title=On the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat| journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]] | publisher=[[Royal Society]]|year=1850| volume=140|pages=61–82| url=http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/140/61 |accessdate=4 June 2016| doi=10.1098/rstl.1850.0004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a list of [[South-West Indian Ocean tropical cyclone climatology|South-West Indian Ocean]] [[tropical cyclones]] before [[1962–63 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season|1963]].

==Storms==
===1848===
On January&amp;nbsp;11, 1848, the first tropical cyclone on record was observed in the basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|author=Philippe Caroff|date=June 2011|title=Operational procedures of TC satellite analysis at RSMC La Reunion|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|accessdate=2013-04-22|url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/tcp/documents/RSMCLaReunionforIWSATC.pdf|format=PDF|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===April 1892 Mauritius cyclone===
{{main|1892 Mauritius cyclone}}
1200 deaths - 50,000 homeless. The most dramatic and the most devastating cyclone in the history of the country. Sugar production fell 42%. A third of the city of Port Louis was destroyed in a few hours.

===February 1899 Madagascar cyclone===
On February 4, a cyclone hit [[Vohemar]] in northeastern Madagascar, producing a minimum pressure of 972&amp;nbsp;mbar (28.69&amp;nbsp;inHg).&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=8kXwskQHBLoC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=madagascar+1899+pressure&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qEKb-I571S&amp;sig=zQUujxd2_ejSJSV4stzbBIi6x2g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiRnvGkjKjOAhXj5oMKHX28B_MQ6AEIJDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=madagascar%201899%20pressure&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

===1904 &amp; 1905 Comoros cyclones===
On December&amp;nbsp;14, a cyclone moved through the Comoros, causing damage to the island's vanilla and coffee plantations. Crop production declined by 9% as a result of the storm, causing food shortages after little rainfall in 1905. On December&amp;nbsp;16, 1905, another cyclone moved struck the island group, killing 30&amp;nbsp;people and injuring 150. Responding to the two cyclones, the French government provided [[French franc|Fr.]]360,000 to the island group toward rebuilding and assistance for residents.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eird.org/esp/cdcapra/pdf/eng/doc2246/doc2246-1ane.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===March 1927 cyclone===

===Cyclone of 1948===
On January&amp;nbsp;22, a tropical disturbance formed northeast of Mauritius. Initially it moved to the southwest, but turned to the south on January&amp;nbsp;26. The next day, the storm passed just west of Réunion with winds estimated at around 300&amp;nbsp;km/h (187&amp;nbsp;mph), and later dissipated on January&amp;nbsp;28.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|author=Kenneth R.

===Cyclone Astrid===
Lasting from December 1957 until early in January 1958, Cyclone Astrid struck Mozambique and later produced torrential rainfall in northern South Africa, reaching over {{convert|500|mm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="dwaf"&gt;{{cite report|title=Documentation of the 1984 Domoina Floods|url=http://www.dwaf.gov.za/iwqs/reports/tr/TR_122_1984_Domoina_floods.pdf|publisher=Department of Water Affairs (South Africa)|author=Z.P.

===March 1959 Madagascar cyclone===
A series of cyclones killed 100 people in Madagascar, causing widespread flooding.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1l9kAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KHwNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2825,6366245&amp;dq=africa+floods&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyclone Alix (19 January 1960)===
Cyclone Alix struck [[Mauritius]] Island in February 1960. The island suffered a devastating wind from 160&amp;nbsp;km/h to 200&amp;nbsp;km/h for nearly 20 hours.

===Cyclone Carol (28 February 1960)===
Carol directly hit [[Mauritius]] where its eye passed over the island and it is assumed to be the most powerful cyclone ever recorded in the South-West Indian Ocean with wind gust of 160&amp;nbsp;km/h to 256&amp;nbsp;km/h, making at least 300,000 people homeless and destroying 40% of Mauritian main economy at that time, which was the sugar cane crop. It left 42 deaths.

===Cyclone Jenny (27–28 February 1962)===
Cyclone Jenny started to develop on 26 February 1962 at around 22hr &lt;!-- What does "22hr" mean?--&gt;, moving in a southeasterly direction. On 27 February 1962, the cyclone passed 30&amp;nbsp;km off the north coast of [[Mauritius]] with a maximum wind speed of 235&amp;nbsp;km/h, causing 14 deaths, injuring hundreds, leaving 8,000 homeless, and considerable damage in the northern portion of the island. Afterwards, Cyclone Jenny moved towards Mauritius at an average speed of 40 km/h. Next, it moved to the north of [[Reunion Island]] on 28 February 1962, where it killed 37 people and injured a further 150.

As such, the values are based on the nominal calculations. Considering a fireball would likely be noticed if it had collided with the Moon, as it would have created a crater over 150 meters in diameter, it can probably be concluded that the actual orbit was not too far from the nominal one- with a closest approach somewhere between 0.5 and 0.8 lunar distances.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a '''list of exoplanetary host stars'''. The table contains information about the coordinates, spectral and physical properties, and number of confirmed [[exoplanet|planets]]. The two most important stellar properties are [[mass]] and [[metallicity]] because they determine how these [[planetary system]]s form. Stars of higher mass and metallicity tend to have more numerous and more massive planets.

Most of the stars below are [[solar analog|solar-type]], mainly in the [[spectral class]]es F, G, and K, because astronomers tend to look for planets around stars similar to the Sun. Others are [[giant star|giants]], which have used up all the hydrogen in their cores. Finding planets around giant stars gives clues as to how planetary systems evolve and how the properties of planets change with the evolution of the stars.

As of April 2018, there are 2816 stars with at least one confirmed planet, of which 628 stars have two or more confirmed planets; that is, 22% of all confirmed exoplanetary host stars have two or more confirmed planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Extrasolar Planet Encyclopaedia — Catalog Listing|url=http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/|website=exoplanet.eu|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, the star with the most confirmed planets is [[Kepler-90]], with eight planets, although [[HD 10180]] may have nine (two are unconfirmed). The most massive exoplanetary host star is [[Omicron Ursae Majoris]] ({{Solar mass|3.09}}),&lt;ref name="exoplanets.org" /&gt;  while the least massive is [[2M J044144]] ({{Solar mass|0.021}}). The most metal-rich star is [[NN Serpentis]] (1.744, 55.5 × Sun), while the most metal-poor is [[BD+20°2457]] (−0.999, 0.100 × Sun). The nearest exoplanetary host star is [[Proxima Centauri]] (4.25 ly), while the most distant is [[NY Virginis]] (26940 ly). Visually, the [[apparent magnitude|brightest]] exoplanetary host star seen from Earth is [[Pollux (star)|Pollux]] (1.15), while the faintest is [[OGLE-2005-BLG-390L]] (27.98).&lt;ref name="exoplanets.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Exoplanets Data Explorer {{!}} Table|url=http://exoplanets.org/table|website=exoplanets.org|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="136228">This is a list of [[molecule]]s that have been detected in the [[interstellar medium]] and [[circumstellar envelope]]s, grouped by the number of component [[atom]]s. The [[chemical formula]] is listed for each detected compound, along with any ionized form that has also been observed.

==Detection==
The molecules listed below were detected by [[spectroscopy]]. Their spectral features are generated by transitions of component [[electron]]s between different energy levels, or by rotational or vibrational spectra. Detection usually occurs in [[radio]], [[microwave]], or [[infrared]] portions of the spectrum.&lt;ref name=shu82/&gt;

Interstellar molecules are formed by chemical reactions within very sparse interstellar or circumstellar clouds of dust and gas. Usually this occurs when a molecule becomes ionized, often as the result of an interaction with a [[cosmic ray]]. This positively charged molecule then draws in a nearby reactant by electrostatic attraction of the neutral molecule's electrons. Molecules can also be generated by reactions between neutral atoms and molecules, although this process is generally slower.&lt;ref name=pnas103d/&gt; The dust plays a critical role of shielding the molecules from the ionizing effect of ultraviolet radiation emitted by stars.&lt;ref name=brown_pais95/&gt;

===History===
The [[Biochemistry|chemistry of life]] may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, [[Age of the universe|13.8 billion years ago]], during a habitable epoch when the [[Universe]] was only 10–17 million years old.&lt;ref name="IJA-2014October"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Loeb |title=The Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9371049&amp;fileId=S1473550414000196 |date=October 2014 |journal=[[International Journal of Astrobiology]] |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=337–339 |doi=10.1017/S1473550414000196 |accessdate=15 December 2014 |arxiv=1312.0613|bibcode = 2014IJAsB..13..337L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20141202"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dreifus |first=Claudia |authorlink=Claudia Dreifus |title=Much-Discussed Views That Go Way Back - Avi Loeb Ponders the Early Universe, Nature and Life |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/02/science/avi-loeb-ponders-the-early-universe-nature-and-life.html |date=2 December 2014 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=3 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first carbon-containing molecule detected in the interstellar medium was the [[methylidyne radical]] (CH&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;) in 1937.&lt;ref name=woon05/&gt; From the early 1970s it was becoming evident that interstellar dust consisted of a large component of more complex organic molecules (COMs),&lt;ref name="AXV-20141219"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ruaud |first1=M. |last2=Loison |first2=J.C. |last3=Hickson |first3=K.M. |last4=Gratier |first4=P. |last5=Hersant |first5=F. |last6=Wakelam |first6=V. |title=Modeling Complex Organic Molecules in dense regions: Eley-Rideal and complex induced reaction |year=2015 |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=447 |issue=4 |pages=4004–4017 |arxiv=1412.6256 |doi=10.1093/mnras/stu2709 |bibcode=2015MNRAS.447.4004R}}&lt;/ref&gt; probably polymers.  [[Chandra Wickramasinghe]] proposed the existence of polymeric composition based on the molecule [[formaldehyde]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO).&lt;ref&gt;N.C. Wickramasinghe, Formaldehyde Polymers in Interstellar Space, Nature,  252, 462, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Fred Hoyle]] and Chandra Wickramasinghe later proposed the identification of bicyclic aromatic compounds from an analysis of the ultraviolet extinction absorption at 2175&amp;nbsp;Å,&lt;ref&gt;F. Hoyle and N.C. Wickramasinghe, Identification of the lambda 2200Å interstellar absorption feature, Nature, 270, 323, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; thus demonstrating the existence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules in space.

In 2004, scientists reported&lt;ref name="Battersby"&gt;{{cite news |last=Battersby |first=S.|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4552-space-molecules-point-to-organic-origins.html |title=Space molecules point to organic origins|publisher=[[New Scientist]] |date=2004 |accessdate=11 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; detecting the [[spectral signature]]s of [[anthracene]] and [[pyrene]] in the [[ultraviolet light]] emitted by the [[Red Rectangle nebula]] (no other such complex molecules had ever been found before in outer space). This discovery was considered a confirmation of a hypothesis that as nebulae of the same type as the Red Rectangle approach the ends of their lives, convection currents cause carbon and hydrogen in the nebulae's core to get caught in stellar winds, and radiate outward.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20053738|title=Estimated IR and phosphorescence emission fluxes for  specific polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the Red Rectangle|date=2006|last1=Mulas|first1=G.|last2=Malloci|first2=G.|last3=Joblin|first3=C.|last4=Toublanc|first4=D.|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=446|issue=2|pages=537–549|bibcode=2006A&amp;A...446..537M|arxiv = astro-ph/0509586 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As they cool, the atoms supposedly bond to each other in various ways and eventually form particles of a million or more atoms. The scientists inferred&lt;ref name="Battersby"/&gt; that since they discovered [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAHs) — which may have been vital in the formation of early life on Earth — in a nebula, by necessity they must originate in nebulae.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 2010, [[fullerenes]] (or "[[Buckyball (molecule)|buckyballs]]") were detected in nebulae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/2041-8205/724/1/L39|title=Formation Of Fullerenes In H-Containing Planetary Nebulae|last1=García-Hernández|first1=D.

In October 2011, scientists found using [[spectroscopy]] that [[cosmic dust]] contains complex [[organic compound|organic]] compounds ("amorphous organic solids with a mixed [[aromatic]]-[[aliphatic]] structure") that could be created naturally, and rapidly, by [[stars]].&lt;ref name="Space-20111026"&gt;{{cite web |last=Chow|first=Denise |title=Discovery: Cosmic Dust Contains Organic Matter from Stars|url=http://www.space.com/13401-cosmic-star-dust-complex-organic-compounds.html |date=26 October 2011|publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=2011-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ScienceDaily-20111026"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[ScienceDaily]] Staff |title=Astronomers Discover Complex Organic Matter Exists Throughout the Universe| url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111026143721.htm |date=26 October 2011 |publisher=[[ScienceDaily]] |accessdate=2011-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature-20111026"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kwok|first1=Sun |last2=Zhang |first2=Yong |title=Mixed aromatic–aliphatic organic nanoparticles as carriers of unidentified infrared emission features |date=26 October 2011 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|doi=10.1038/nature10542 |volume=479 |issue=7371 |pages=80–3 |bibcode = 2011Natur.479...80K|pmid=22031328}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compounds are so complex that their chemical structures resemble the makeup of [[coal]] and [[petroleum]]; such chemical complexity was previously thought to arise only from living organisms.&lt;ref name="Space-20111026"/&gt;  These observations suggest that organic compounds introduced on Earth by interstellar dust particles could serve as basic ingredients for life due to their [[catalysis|surface-catalytic]] activities.&lt;ref name=Lincei&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gallori |first=Enzo |title=Astrochemistry and the origin of genetic material |journal=Rendiconti Lincei |date=November 2010 |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=113–118 |id= |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/x332837483630g24/ |accessdate=2011-08-11 |doi=10.1007/s12210-011-0118-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martins |first=Zita |title=Organic Chemistry of Carbonaceous Meteorites |journal=Elements |date =February 2011 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=35–40|id=|url=http://elements.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/7/1/35 |accessdate=2011-08-11|doi=10.2113/gselements.7.1.35}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the scientists suggested that these compounds may have been related to the development of life on Earth and said that, "If this is the case, life on Earth may have had an easier time getting started as these organics can serve as basic ingredients for life."&lt;ref name="Space-20111026"/&gt;

In August 2012, astronomers at [[Copenhagen University]] reported the detection of a specific sugar molecule, [[glycolaldehyde]], in a distant star system. The molecule was found around the [[protostar|protostellar]] binary ''IRAS 16293-2422'', which is located 400 light years from Earth.&lt;ref name="NG-20120829"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sugar Found In Space|journal=National Geographic |last=Than |first=Ker |date=August 29, 2012|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/08/120829-sugar-space-planets-science-life/|accessdate=August 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP-20120829"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Sweet!

In September 2012, [[NASA|NASA scientists]] reported that PAHs, subjected to [[interstellar medium|interstellar medium (ISM)]] conditions, are transformed, through [[hydrogenation]], [[oxygenate|oxygenation]], and [[hydroxylation]], to more complex [[organic compound|organics]] — "a step along the path toward [[amino acids]] and [[nucleotides]], the raw materials of [[proteins]] and [[DNA]], respectively".&lt;ref name="Space-20120920"&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff|title=NASA Cooks Up Icy Organics to Mimic Life's Origins|url=http://www.space.com/17681-life-building-blocks-nasa-organic-molecules.html|date=September 20, 2012|publisher=[[Space.com]]|accessdate=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AJL-20120901"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gudipati|first1=Murthy S.|last2=Yang|first2=Rui|title=In-Situ Probing Of Radiation-Induced Processing Of Organics In Astrophysical Ice Analogs—Novel Laser Desorption Laser Ionization Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectroscopic Studies|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/2041-8205/756/1/L24|date=September 1, 2012|journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Letters]]|volume=756|number=1|doi=10.1088/2041-8205/756/1/L24|accessdate=September 22, 2012|bibcode = 2012ApJ...756L..24G|pages=L24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, as a result of these transformations, the PAHs lose their [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic signature]] which could be one of the reasons "for the lack of PAH detection in [[interstellar ice]] [[cosmic dust#Dust grain formation|grains]], particularly the outer regions of cold, dense clouds or the upper molecular layers of [[protoplanetary disks]]."&lt;ref name="Space-20120920" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AJL-20120901" /&gt;

In 2013, Dwayne Heard at the University of Leeds suggested&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/351444/description/Interstellar_chemistry_makes_use_of_quantum_shortcut#comment_351468 Interstellar chemistry makes use of quantum shortcut | Science News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; that quantum mechanical tunneling could explain a reaction his group observed taking place, at a significantly higher than expected rate, between cold (around 63 [[kelvin]]s) hydroxyl and methanol molecules, apparently bypassing intramolecular energy barriers which would have to be overcome by thermal energy or ionization events for the same rate to exist at warmer temperatures. The proposed tunneling mechanism may help explain the common observation of fairly complex molecules (up to tens of atoms) in interstellar space.

A particularly large and rich region for detecting interstellar molecules is [[Sagittarius B2]] (Sgr B2). This giant [[molecular cloud]] lies near the center of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy and is a frequent target for new searches. About half of the molecules listed below were first found near Sgr B2, and nearly every other molecule has since been detected in this feature.&lt;ref name=ajss60/&gt; A rich source of investigation for circumstellar molecules is the relatively nearby star [[CW Leonis]] (IRC +10216), where about 50 compounds have been identified.&lt;ref name=kaler2002/&gt;

In March 2015, NASA scientists reported that, for the first time, complex [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] [[organic compound]]s of [[life]], including [[uracil]], [[cytosine]] and [[thymine]], have been formed in the laboratory under [[outer space]] conditions, using starting chemicals, such as [[pyrimidine]], found in [[meteorite]]s. Pyrimidine, like [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs), the most carbon-rich chemical found in the [[Universe]], may have been formed in [[red giant]]s or in [[Cosmic dust|interstellar dust]] and gas clouds, according to the scientists.&lt;ref name="NASA-20150303"&gt;{{cite web |last=Marlaire |first=Ruth |title=NASA Ames Reproduces the Building Blocks of Life in Laboratory |url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-ames-reproduces-the-building-blocks-of-life-in-laboratory |date=3 March 2015 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=5 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, astronomers reported that the very basic chemical ingredients of [[life]]&amp;mdash;the [[Carbon-hydrogen bond|carbon-hydrogen molecule]] (CH&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;, or [[methylidyne radical]]), the carbon-hydrogen positive ion (CH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation) and the carbon ion (C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation)&amp;mdash;are the result, in large part, of [[ultraviolet light]] from [[star]]s, rather than in other ways, such as the result of turbulent events related to [[supernovae]] and [[young star]]s, as thought earlier.&lt;ref name="NASA-20161012"&gt;{{cite web |last=Landau |first=Elizabeth |title=Building Blocks of Life's Building Blocks Come From Starlight |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6645 |date=12 October 2016 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=13 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3847/0004-637X/829/1/15|bibcode=2016ApJ...829...15M|title=Herschel/HIFI Spectral Mapping of C+, CH+, and CH in Orion BN/Kl: The Prevailing Role of Ultraviolet Irradiation in CH+ Formation|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=829|pages=15|year=2016|last1=Morris|first1=Patrick W.|last2=Gupta|first2=Harshal|last3=Nagy|first3=Zsofia|last4=Pearson|first4=John C.|last5=Ossenkopf-Okada|first5=Volker|last6=Falgarone|first6=Edith|last7=Lis|first7=Dariusz C.|last8=Gerin|first8=Maryvonne|last9=Melnick|first9=Gary|last10=Neufeld|first10=David A.|last11=Bergin|first11=Edwin A.|arxiv = 1604.05805 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical models==
To explain the observed ratios of isomeric compounds, the minimum energy principle has been used. In the majority of cases, it explains that some organic entities have greater abundance than their isomers due to the lower total energies of the first one. However, a few exceptions where the principle fails are also known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lattelais|first1=M.|last2=Pauzat|first2=F.|last3=Ellinger|first3=Y.|last4=Ceccarelli|first4=C.|title=Interstellar Complex Organic Molecules and the Minimum Energy Principle|journal=Astrophysical Journal Letters|date=2009|volume=696|issue=2|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/696/2/L133|bibcode=2009ApJ...696L.133L|pages=L133–L136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach ignores energy and deals only with the molecular complexity estimated by the information entropy index. It speculates that the points of several natural compounds (urea, pyrimidine, dihydroxyacetone, uracil, cytosine, glycine, and alanine) fall into the range of the values typical for the known interstellar molecules that indicates high probability of their detection in interstellar environment. Additionally the molecules with maximal information entropy, i.e. the most complex compounds, make up approximately a half of the interstellar set and their percentage is decreased with the size. This trend may be associated with the different stabilities of the molecules with uniform (usually more stable) and diversified (usually less stable) chemical structures, so the detectable molecules with a large size must possess symmetric structure more probably than non-symmetric. The remarkable detection of low-entropy (highly symmetric) fullerene molecules supports this assumption. It is also noted that information entropy reflects the depth of hydrogenation of interstellar entities: the molecules with maximal information entropy are hydrogen-poor whereas the others are mainly hydrogen-rich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sabirov|first1=Denis|title=Information entropy of interstellar and circumstellar carbon-containing molecules: Molecular size against structural complexity|journal=Computational and Theoretical Chemistry|date=1 December 2016|volume=1097|issue=1|pages=83–91|doi=10.1016/j.comptc.2016.10.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Molecules==
The following tables list molecules that have been detected in the interstellar medium, grouped by the number of component [[atom]]s. If there is no entry in the molecule column, only the ionized form has been detected. For molecules where no designation was given in the scientific literature, that field is left empty. Mass is given in [[atomic mass unit]]s. The total number of unique species, including distinct ionization states, is listed in parentheses in each section header.

Most of the molecules detected so far are [[organic molecule|organic]]. Only one inorganic species has been observed in molecules which contain at least five atoms, SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Klemperer2011"/&gt; Larger molecules have so far all had at least one carbon atom, with no N−N or O−O bonds.&lt;ref name="Klemperer2011"/&gt;

[[Image:Melt inclusions 2.jpg|thumb|Multiple melt inclusions in an olivine crystal. Individual inclusions are oval or round in shape and consist of clear glass, together with a small round vapor bubble and in some cases a small square [[spinel]] crystal. The black arrow points to one good example, but there are several others. The occurrence of multiple inclusions within a single crystal is relatively common]]
A '''melt inclusion''' is a small parcel or "blobs" of melt(s) that is entrapped by crystals growing in [[magma]] and eventually forming [[igneous rocks]]. In many respects it is analogous to a [[fluid inclusion]]. 

==Characteristics==
Melt inclusions are generally small - most are less than 80 [[micrometre]]s across (a micrometre is one thousandth of a millimeter, or about 0.00004&amp;nbsp;inches). They may contain a number of different constituents, including glass (which represents melt that has been quenched by rapid cooling), small crystals and a separate vapour-rich bubble. They occur in the crystals that can be found in igneous rocks, such as for example [[quartz]], [[feldspar]], [[olivine]], [[pyroxene]], [[nepheline]], [[magnetite]], [[perovskite]] and [[apatite]]. Melt inclusions can be found in both [[volcanic]] and [[pluton]]ic rocks. In addition, melt inclusions can contain immiscible (non-miscible) melt phases. Their study is an exceptional way to find direct evidences for presence of two or more melts at entrapment.

==Analysis==
Although they are small, melt inclusions can provide an abundance of useful information. Using microscopic observations and a range of chemical [[microanalysis]] techniques [[geochemist]]s and [[igneous petrology|igneous petrologists]] can obtain a range of unique information from melt inclusions. The most common uses of melt inclusions is studying the composition and compositional evolution of magmas existed in the history of specific magma systems. This is because inclusions can act like "fossils" - trapping and preserving these melts before they are modified by later processes. In addition, because they are trapped at high pressures (P) and temperatures (T) many melt inclusions also provide important information about the entrapping conditions (P-T) and their volatile content (such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, S and Cl) that drive explosive [[volcano|volcanic eruptions]].

==History==
[[Henry Clifton Sorby]], in 1858, was the first to document microscopic melt inclusions in crystals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sorby |first1=H. C. |date=1858 |title=On the microscopic structures of crystals, indicating the origin of minerals and rocks |journal=Geological Society of London Quarterly Journal |volume=14|pages=453–500}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The study of melt inclusions has been driven more recently by the development of sophisticated chemical analysis techniques. Scientists from the former Soviet Union lead the study of melt inclusions in the decades after [[World War II]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Sobolev |last1=V. S. |first2= V. P. |last2=Kostyuk |date=1975 |title=Magmatic crystallization based on a study of melt inclusions |journal=Fluid Inclusion Research |volume=9 |pages=182–235}}&lt;/ref&gt; and developed methods for heating melt inclusions under a microscope, so changes could be directly observed.

A '''meteorite''' is a solid piece of debris from an object, such as a [[comet]], [[asteroid]], or [[meteoroid]], that originates in [[outer space]] and survives its passage through the [[atmosphere]] to reach the surface of a planet or [[Natural satellite|moon]]. When the object enters the atmosphere, various factors such as [[friction]], [[pressure]], and [[chemical interaction]]s with the atmospheric gases cause it to heat up and radiate that [[energy]]. It then becomes a [[meteor]] and forms a [[Meteoroid#Fireball|fireball]], also known as a '''shooting star''' or '''falling star'''; astronomers call the brightest examples "[[Bolide#Astronomy|bolides]]". Meteorites vary greatly in size. For geologists, a [[Bolide#Geology|bolide]] is a meteorite large enough to create a crater.&lt;ref name="WoodsHoleUSGS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://woodshole.er.usgs.gov/epubs/bolide/introduction.html|title=Introduction: What is a Bolide?|last=Editors|first=|date=1 April 1998|website=Woodshole.er.usgs.gov|publisher=US Geological Survey, Woods Hole Field Center|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=| accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meteorites that are recovered after being observed as they transit the atmosphere and [[Impact event|impact the Earth]] are called [[meteorite falls]]. All others are known as [[meteorite finds]]. {{As of|2018|08}}, there were about 1,412 witnessed falls that have specimens in the world's collections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meteor/metbull.php Meteoritical Bulletin Database].

Meteorites have traditionally been divided into three broad categories: stony meteorites that are rocks, mainly composed of [[silicate minerals]]; [[iron meteorite]]s that are largely composed of metallic iron-nickel; and stony-iron meteorites that contain large amounts of both metallic and rocky material. Modern [[Meteorite classification|classification]] schemes divide meteorites into groups according to their structure, chemical and isotopic composition and mineralogy. Meteorites smaller than 2&amp;nbsp;mm are classified as [[micrometeorites]]. Extraterrestrial meteorites are such objects that have impacted other celestial bodies, whether or not they have passed through an atmosphere. They have been found on the [[Moon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Naming==
Meteorites are always named for the places they were found,&lt;ref&gt;[http://meteoriticalsociety.org/simple_template.cfm?code=pub_bulletinguidelines Meteoritical Society Guidelines for Meteorite Nomenclature]. Meteoriticalsociety.org. Retrieved on 17 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; usually a nearby town or geographic feature. In cases where many meteorites were found in one place, the name may be followed by a number or letter (e.g., Allan Hills 84001 or Dimmitt (b)). The name designated by the [[Meteoritical Society]] is used by scientists, catalogers, and most collectors.

==Fall phenomena==
{{see also|Atmospheric entry|Meteorite fall}}
Most meteoroids disintegrate when entering the Earth's atmosphere. Usually, five to ten a year are observed to fall and are subsequently recovered and made known to scientists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meteor/metbull.php?sea=%2A&amp;sfor=names&amp;ants=&amp;falls=yes&amp;valids=&amp;stype=contains&amp;lrec=50&amp;map=ge&amp;browse=&amp;country=All&amp;srt=year&amp;categ=All&amp;mblist=All&amp;rect=&amp;phot=&amp;snew=0&amp;pnt=Normal%20table&amp;dr=&amp;page=1 Meteoritical Bulletin]&lt;/ref&gt; Few meteorites are large enough to create large [[impact crater]]s. Instead, they typically arrive at the surface at their [[terminal velocity]] and, at most, create a small pit.

[[File:Novato Meteorite Impact Pit.jpg|thumb|right|The 'crater' made by a 61.9-gram [[Novato meteorite]] when it hit the roof of a house on October 17, 2012.]]

Large meteoroids may strike the earth with a significant fraction of their [[escape velocity]] (second cosmic velocity), leaving behind a [[hypervelocity]] impact crater. The kind of crater will depend on the size, composition, degree of fragmentation, and incoming angle of the impactor. The force of such collisions has the potential to cause widespread destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Clark R. |last1=Chapman |first2=Daniel D. |last2=Durda |first3=Robert E. |last3=Gold |title=The Comet/Asteroid Impact Hazard: A Systems Approach |year=2001 |url=http://www.internationalspace.com/pdf/NEOwp_Chapman-Durda-Gold.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002442/http://www.internationalspace.com/pdf/NEOwp_Chapman-Durda-Gold.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/impacteffects/ Make your own impact at the University of Arizona]. Lpl.arizona.edu. Retrieved on 17 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The most frequent hypervelocity cratering events on the Earth are caused by iron meteoroids, which are most easily able to transit the atmosphere intact. Examples of craters caused by iron meteoroids include [[Barringer Meteor Crater]], [[Odessa Meteor Crater]], [[Wabar craters]], and [[Wolfe Creek crater]]; iron meteorites are found in association with all of these craters. In contrast, even relatively large stony or icy bodies like small [[comet]]s or [[asteroid]]s, up to millions of tons, are disrupted in the atmosphere, and do not make impact craters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bland|first=P.A. |last2= Artemieva |year=2006 |first2=Natalya A. |title=The rate of small impacts on Earth |journal= Meteoritics and Planetary Science |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=607–631 |bibcode=2006M&amp;PS...41..607B |doi=10.1111/j.1945-5100.2006.tb00485.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although such disruption events are uncommon, they can cause a considerable concussion to occur; the famed [[Tunguska event]] probably resulted from such an incident. Very large stony objects, hundreds of meters in diameter or more, weighing tens of millions of [[ton]]s or more, can reach the surface and cause large craters, but are very rare. Such events are generally so energetic that the impactor is completely destroyed, leaving no meteorites. (The very first example of a stony meteorite found in association with a large impact crater, the [[Morokweng crater]] in South Africa, was reported in May 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maier |first1=W.D.

Various colors have been reported, including yellow, green, and red. Flashes and bursts of light can occur as the object breaks up. Explosions, detonations, and rumblings are often heard during meteorite falls, which can be caused by [[sonic boom]]s as well as [[shock wave]]s resulting from major fragmentation events. These sounds can be heard over wide areas, with a radius of a hundred or more kilometers. Whistling and hissing sounds are also sometimes heard, but are poorly understood. Following passage of the fireball, it is not unusual for a dust trail to linger in the atmosphere for several minutes.

[[File:Oriented Taza Meteorite.jpg|thumb|right|NWA 859 iron meteorite showing effects of atmospheric ablation]]
As meteoroids are heated during [[atmospheric entry]], their surfaces melt and experience [[ablation]]. They can be sculpted into various shapes during this process, sometimes resulting in shallow thumbprint-like indentations on their surfaces called [[wikt:regmaglypt|regmaglypt]]s. If the meteoroid maintains a fixed orientation for some time, without tumbling, it may develop a conical "nose cone" or "heat shield" shape. As it decelerates, eventually the molten [[surface layer]] solidifies into a thin fusion crust, which on most meteorites is black (on some [[achondrite]]s, the fusion crust may be very light colored). On stony meteorites, the [[heat-affected zone]] is at most a few mm deep; in iron meteorites, which are more thermally conductive, the structure of the metal may be affected by heat up to {{Convert|1|cm}} below the surface. Reports vary; some meteorites are reported to be "burning hot to the touch" upon landing, while others are alleged to have been cold enough to condense water and form a frost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meteor/metbull.php?code=16885 Fall of the Muzaffarpur iron meteorite].

Meteoroids that experience disruption in the atmosphere may fall as meteorite showers, which can range from only a few up to thousands of separate individuals. The area over which a meteorite shower falls is known as its [[strewn field]]. Strewn fields are commonly [[ellipse|elliptical]] in shape, with the major axis parallel to the direction of flight. In most cases, the largest meteorites in a shower are found farthest down-range in the strewn field.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Most meteorites are stony meteorites, classed as [[chondrite]]s and [[achondrite]]s. Only about 6% of meteorites are [[iron meteorite]]s or a blend of rock and metal, the [[Pallasite|stony-iron meteorite]]s. Modern classification of meteorites is complex. The review paper of Krot et al. (2007)&lt;ref name="Krot:2007"&gt;{{cite book |volume=1 |title=Treatise on Geochemistry |chapter=1.05 Classification of Meteorites |doi=10.1016/B0-08-043751-6/01062-8 |isbn=978-0-08-043751-4 |first1=A.N. |last1=Krot |first2=K. |last2=Keil |first3=E.R.D. |last3=Scott |first4=C.A. |last4=Goodrich |first5=M.K. |last5=Weisberg |editor-last=Holland| editor-first=Heinrich D. |editor2-first=Karl K.|editor2-last=Turekian |pages=83–128 |publisher=Elsevier Ltd |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; summarizes modern meteorite taxonomy.

About 86% of the meteorites are chondrites,&lt;ref name="mbdb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://internt.nhm.ac.uk/jdsml/research-curation/projects/metcat// The NHM Catalogue of Meteorites]. Internt.nhm.ac.uk. Retrieved on 17 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metbase.de/ MetBase]. Metbase.de. Retrieved on 17 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; which are named for the small, round particles they contain. These particles, or [[chondrule]]s, are composed mostly of silicate minerals that appear to have been melted while they were free-floating objects in space. Certain types of chondrites also contain small amounts of [[Organic material|organic matter]], including [[amino acid]]s, and [[presolar grains]]. Chondrites are typically about 4.55 billion years old and are thought to represent material from the [[asteroid belt]] that never coalesced into large bodies. Like [[comet]]s, chondritic asteroids are some of the oldest and most primitive materials in the solar system. Chondrites are often considered to be "the building blocks of the planets".

About 8% of the meteorites are [[achondrite]]s (meaning they do not contain chondrules), some of which are similar to terrestrial [[igneous rock]]s. Most achondrites are also ancient rocks, and are thought to represent crustal material of differentiated planetesimals. One large family of achondrites (the [[HED meteorite]]s) may have originated on the parent body of the [[Vesta family|Vesta Family]], although this claim is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/dawn/ceresvesta/ |title=Dawn's Targets – Vesta and Ceres |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=12 July 2011 |accessdate=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X13004986 |title=Vesta and extensively melted asteroids: Why HED meteorites are probably not from Vesta |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |date=1 November 2013 |accessdate=1 December 2013 |doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2013.09.002 |bibcode=2013E&amp;PSL.381..138W |volume=381 |pages=138–146|last1=Wasson |first1=John T. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others derive from unidentified asteroids. Two small groups of achondrites are special, as they are younger and do not appear to come from the asteroid belt. One of these groups comes from the Moon, and includes rocks similar to those brought back to Earth by [[Apollo program|Apollo]] and [[Luna programme|Luna]] programs. The other group is almost certainly from [[Mars]] and constitutes the only materials from other planets ever recovered by humans.

About 5% of meteorites that have been seen to fall are [[iron meteorite]]s composed of iron-[[nickel]] [[alloy]]s, such as [[kamacite]] and/or [[taenite]]. Most iron meteorites are thought to come from the cores of planetesimals that were once molten. As with the Earth, the denser metal separated from silicate material and sank toward the center of the planetesimal, forming its core. After the planetesimal solidified, it broke up in a collision with another planetesimal. Due to the low abundance of iron meteorites in collection areas such as Antarctica, where most of the meteoric material that has fallen can be recovered, it is possible that the percentage of iron-meteorite falls is lower than 5%. This would be explained by a recovery bias; laypeople are more likely to notice and recover solid masses of metal than most other meteorite types. The abundance of iron meteorites relative to total Antarctic finds is 0.4% &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meteor/metbull.php?sea=%2A&amp;sfor=names&amp;ants=&amp;falls=&amp;valids=&amp;stype=contains&amp;lrec=50&amp;map=ge&amp;browse=&amp;country=Antarctica&amp;srt=name&amp;categ=Iron+meteorites&amp;mblist=All&amp;rect=&amp;phot=&amp;snew=0&amp;pnt=Normal%20table&amp;dr=&amp;page=1 Meteoritical Bulletin: Antarctic Iron Meteorites]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meteor/metbull.php?sea=%2A&amp;sfor=names&amp;ants=&amp;falls=&amp;valids=&amp;stype=contains&amp;lrec=50&amp;map=ge&amp;browse=&amp;country=Antarctica&amp;srt=name&amp;categ=All&amp;mblist=All&amp;rect=&amp;phot=&amp;snew=0&amp;pnt=Normal%20table&amp;dr=&amp;page=1 Meteoritical Bulletin: All Antarctic Meteorites]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stony-iron meteorites constitute the remaining 1%. They are a mixture of iron-nickel metal and [[silicate]] minerals. One type, called [[pallasite]]s, is thought to have originated in the boundary zone above the core regions where iron meteorites originated. The other major type of stony-iron meteorites is the [[mesosiderite]]s.

[[Tektites]] (from Greek ''tektos'', molten) are not themselves meteorites, but are rather natural glass objects up to a few centimeters in size that were formed—according to most scientists—by the impacts of large meteorites on Earth's surface. A few researchers have favored tektites originating from the [[Moon]] as volcanic ejecta, but this theory has lost much of its support over the last few decades.

==Meteorite chemistry==
In March 2015, NASA scientists reported that, for the first time, complex [[organic compound]]s found in [[DNA]] and [[RNA]], including [[uracil]], cytosine and [[thymine]], have been formed in the laboratory under [[outer space]] conditions, using starting chemicals, such as [[pyrimidine]], found in meteorites. Pyrimidine, like [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs), the most carbon-rich chemical found in the [[Universe]], may have been formed in [[red giant]]s or in [[Cosmic dust|interstellar dust]] and gas clouds, according to the scientists.&lt;ref name="NASA-20150303"&gt;{{cite web |last=Marlaire |first=Ruth |title=NASA Ames Reproduces the Building Blocks of Life in Laboratory |url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-ames-reproduces-the-building-blocks-of-life-in-laboratory |date=3 March 2015 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=5 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, researchers found that 4.5 billion-year-old meteorites found on Earth contained liquid water along with prebiotic complex organic substances that may be ingredients for life.&lt;ref name="EA-20180110"&gt;{{cite news |author=Lawrence Berkeley National laboratory Staff |title=Ingredients for life revealed in meteorites that fell to Earth - Study, based in part at Berkeley Lab, also suggests dwarf planet in asteroid belt may be a source of rich organic matter |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-01/dbnl-ifl010918.php |date=10 January 2018 |work=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS-Eureka Alert]] |accessdate=11 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SA-20180110"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chan, Queenie H.

===Falls===
{{see also|Meteorite fall|Impact event}}

[[File:Benldmeteorite.jpg|thumb|Car seat and muffler hit by the [[Benld, Illinois|Benld]] meteorite in 1938, with the meteorite inset. An observed fall.]]
Most [[meteorite falls]] are recovered on the basis of eyewitness accounts of the fireball or the impact of the object on the ground, or both. Therefore, despite the fact that meteorites fall with virtually equal probability everywhere on Earth, verified meteorite falls tend to be concentrated in areas with high [[World population|human population]] densities such as Europe, Japan, and [[North India|northern India]].

A small number of meteorite falls have been observed with automated cameras and recovered following calculation of the impact point. The first of these was the [[Přibram meteorite]], which fell in [[Czechoslovakia]] (now the Czech Republic) in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ceplecha |first=Z. |year=1961 |title=Multiple fall of Příbram meteorites photographed |journal=Bull. Astron. Inst. Czechoslovakia |volume=12 |pages=21–46 |bibcode=1961BAICz..12...21C }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, two cameras used to photograph [[meteor]]s captured images of the fireball. The images were used both to determine the location of the stones on the ground and, more significantly, to calculate for the first time an accurate orbit for a recovered meteorite.

Following the Pribram fall, other nations established automated observing programs aimed at studying infalling meteorites. One of these was the ''Prairie Network'', operated by the [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]] from 1963 to 1975 in the [[Midwestern United States|midwestern US]]. This program also observed a meteorite fall, the ''Lost City'' chondrite, allowing its recovery and a calculation of its orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McCrosky |first1=R.E. |first2=A. |last2=Posen |first3=G. |last3=Schwartz |first4=C.-Y. |last4=Shao |title=Lost City Meteorite–Its Recovery and a Comparison with Other Fireballs |year=1971 |journal=J.

===Finds===
{{see also|Meteorite find}}

Until the twentieth century, only a few hundred meteorite finds had ever been discovered. More than 80% of these were iron and stony-iron meteorites, which are easily distinguished from local rocks. To this day, few stony meteorites are reported each year that can be considered to be "accidental" finds. The reason there are now more than 30,000 meteorite finds in the world's collections started with the discovery by [[Harvey H. Nininger]] that meteorites are much more common on the surface of the Earth than was previously thought.

====The Great Plains of the US====
Nininger's strategy was to search for meteorites in the [[Great Plains]] of the United States, where the land was largely cultivated and the soil contained few rocks. Between the late 1920s and the 1950s, he traveled across the region, educating local people about what meteorites looked like and what to do if they thought they had found one, for example, in the course of clearing a field. The result was the discovery of over 200 new meteorites, mostly stony types.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meteoritearticles.com/mitterlingmain.html Website by A. Mitterling]. Meteoritearticles.com. Retrieved on 17 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s, [[Roosevelt County, New Mexico]] in the Great Plains was found to be a particularly good place to find meteorites. After the discovery of a few meteorites in 1967, a public awareness campaign resulted in the finding of nearly 100 new specimens in the next few years, with many being by a single person, Ivan Wilson. In total, nearly 140 meteorites were found in the region since 1967. In the area of the finds, the ground was originally covered by a shallow, loose soil sitting atop a [[hardpan]] layer. During the [[dustbowl]] era, the loose soil was blown off, leaving any rocks and meteorites that were present stranded on the exposed surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Huss |first1=G.I. |last2=Wilson |first2=I.E. |year=1973 |title=A census of the meteorites of Roosevelt County, New Mexico |journal=Meteoritics |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=287–290 |bibcode=1973Metic...8..287H |doi=10.1111/j.1945-5100.1973.tb01257.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few meteorites were found in [[Antarctica]] between 1912 and 1964. In 1969, the 10th Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition found nine meteorites on a [[Blue ice (glacial)|blue ice field]] near the [[Yamato Mountains]]. With this discovery, came the realization that movement of [[ice sheet]]s might act to concentrate meteorites in certain areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yoshida|first=Masaru|date=2010|title=Discovery of the Yamato Meteorites in 1969|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1873965209000589|journal=Polar Science|volume=3|issue=4|pages=272–284|doi=10.1016/j.polar.2009.11.001|issn=1873-9652|via=|bibcode=2010PolSc...3..272Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a dozen other specimens were found in the same place in 1973, a Japanese expedition was launched in 1974 dedicated to the search for meteorites. This team recovered nearly 700 meteorites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Meteorites: A Journey Through Space and Time|last=Bevan|first=Alex|last2=De Laeter|first2=John|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=Washington DC|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly thereafter, the United States began its own program to search for Antarctic meteorites, operating along the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] on the other side of the continent: the Antarctic Search for Meteorites ([[ANSMET]]) program. European teams, starting with a consortium called "EUROMET" in the late 1980s, and continuing with a program by the Italian Programma Nazionale di Ricerche in Antartide have also conducted systematic searches for Antarctic meteorites.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The Antarctic Scientific Exploration of China has conducted successful meteorite searches since 2000. A Korean program (KOREAMET) was launched in 2007 and has collected a few meteorites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 2nd KOREAMET found 16 meteorites |url=http://fireball.snu.ac.kr/koreamet/ |publisher=KORea Expedition for Antarctic METeorites (KOREAMET) |date=19 February 2008 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414211419/http://fireball.snu.ac.kr/koreamet/ |archive-date=14 April 2008 |access-date=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combined efforts of all of these expeditions have produced more than 23,000 classified meteorite specimens since 1974, with thousands more that have not yet been classified. For more information see the article by Harvey (2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harvey |first=Ralph |year=2003 |title=The origin and significance of Antarctic meteorites |journal=Chemie der Erde |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=93–147 |doi=10.1078/0009-2819-00031|bibcode = 2003ChEG...63...93H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Australia====
At about the same time as meteorite concentrations were being discovered in the cold desert of Antarctica, collectors discovered that many meteorites could also be found in the hot [[deserts of Australia]]. Several dozen meteorites had already been found in the [[Nullarbor]] region of [[Western Australia|Western]] and [[South Australia]]. Systematic searches between about 1971 and the present recovered more than 500 others,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bevan |first1=A.W.R. |last2=Binns |first2=R.A.|year=1989 |title=Meteorites from the Nullarbor region, Western Australia: I.

The meteorites can be found in this region because the land presents a flat, featureless, plain covered by [[limestone]]. In the extremely arid climate, there has been relatively little [[weathering]] or [[sedimentation]] on the surface for tens of thousands of years, allowing meteorites to accumulate without being buried or destroyed. The dark colored meteorites can then be recognized among the very different looking limestone pebbles and rocks.

====The Sahara====
[[File:NWA869Meteorite.jpg|thumb|This small meteorite is from the NWA 869 strewn field, near [[Tindouf]], [[Algeria]]. Currently classified as an L3.8-6 [[ordinary chondrite]] it shows [[breccia]]tion and abundant [[chondrule]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Meteoritical Bulletin Database [http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meteor/metbull.php?code=31890 www.lpi.usra.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 1986–87, a German team installing a network of seismic stations while prospecting for oil discovered about 65 meteorites on a flat, desert plain about {{Convert|100|km}} southeast of Dirj (Daraj), [[Libya]]. A few years later, a desert enthusiast saw photographs of meteorites being recovered by scientists in Antarctica, and thought that he had seen similar occurrences in [[North Africa|northern Africa]]. In 1989, he recovered about 100 meteorites from several distinct locations in Libya and Algeria. Over the next several years, he and others who followed found at least 400 more meteorites. The find locations were generally in regions known as [[desert|regs]] or [[hamada]]s: flat, featureless areas covered only by small pebbles and minor amounts of sand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bischoff |first1=A. |last2=Geiger |first2=T.|year=1995 |title=Meteorites from the Sahara: find locations, shock classification, degree of weathering and pairing |journal=Meteoritics |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=113–122 |bibcode=1995Metic..30..113B |doi=10.1111/j.1945-5100.1995.tb01219.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dark-colored meteorites can be easily spotted in these places. In the case of several meteorite fields, such as [[Dar el Gani]], Dhofar, and others, favorable light-colored geology consisting of [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] rocks (clays, [[dolomite]]s, and [[limestone]]s) makes meteorites particularly easy to identify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2002M&amp;PS...37.1079S |last1=Schlüter |first1=J. |last2=Schultz |first2=L. |last3=Thiedig |first3=F. |last4=Al-Mahdi |first4=B.

Although meteorites had been sold commercially and collected by hobbyists for many decades, up to the time of the Saharan finds of the late 1980s and early 1990s, most meteorites were deposited in or purchased by museums and similar institutions where they were exhibited and made available for [[Scientific method|scientific research]]. The sudden availability of large numbers of meteorites that could be found with relative ease in places that were readily accessible (especially compared to Antarctica), led to a rapid rise in commercial collection of meteorites. This process was accelerated when, in 1997, meteorites coming from both the Moon and Mars were found in Libya. By the late 1990s, private meteorite-collecting expeditions had been launched throughout the Sahara. Specimens of the meteorites recovered in this way are still deposited in research collections, but most of the material is sold to private collectors. These expeditions have now brought the total number of well-described meteorites found in Algeria and Libya to more than 500.&lt;ref&gt;Meteoritical Bulletin Database [http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meteor/index.php?sea=sahara&amp;sfor=names&amp;ants=&amp;falls=&amp;valids=&amp;stype=contains&amp;lrec=50&amp;map=ge&amp;browse=&amp;country=All&amp;srt=name&amp;categ=All&amp;mblist=All&amp;rect=&amp;phot=&amp;snew=0&amp;pnt=Normal%20table&amp;dr=&amp;page=1 www.lpi.usra.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Northwest Africa=====
{{anchor|NWA}}&lt;!-- Used by incoming redirects --&gt;
Meteorite markets came into existence in the late 1990s, especially in [[Morocco]]. This trade was driven by Western commercialization and an increasing number of collectors. The meteorites were supplied by nomads and local people who combed the deserts looking for specimens to sell. Many thousands of meteorites have been distributed in this way, most of which lack any information about how, when, or where they were discovered. These are the so-called "Northwest Africa" meteorites. When they get classified, they are named "Northwest Africa" (abbreviated NWA) followed by a number.&lt;ref&gt;[http://meteoriticalsociety.org/?page_id=59 Guidelines for Meteorite Nomenclature]&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally accepted that NWA meteorites originate in Morocco, Algeria, Western Sahara, Mali, and possibly even further afield. Nearly all of these meteorites leave Africa through Morocco. Scores of important meteorites, including Lunar and Martian ones, have been discovered and made available to science via this route. A few of the more notable meteorites recovered include [[Tissint meteorite|Tissint]] and [[Northwest Africa 7034]]. Tissint was the first witnessed Martian meteorite fall in over fifty years; NWA 7034 is the oldest meteorite known to come from Mars, and is a unique water-bearing regolith breccia.

====Arabian Peninsula====
[[File:Meteoritenfund auf Wüstenpflaster.jpg|thumb|Meteorite find in situ on [[desert pavement]], [[Rub' al Khali]], Saudi Arabia. Probable [[chondrite]], weight 408.5 grams.]]
In 1999, meteorite hunters discovered that the desert in southern and central [[Oman]] were also favorable for the collection of many specimens. The gravel plains in the [[Dhofar]] and [[Al Wusta Region (Oman)|Al Wusta]] regions of Oman, south of the sandy deserts of the [[Empty Quarter|Rub' al Khali]], had yielded about 5,000 meteorites as of mid-2009. Included among these are a large number of [[lunar meteorite|lunar]] and [[mars meteorite|Martian]] meteorites, making Oman a particularly important area both for scientists and collectors. Early expeditions to Oman were mainly done by commercial meteorite dealers, however international teams of Omani and European scientists have also now collected specimens.

The recovery of meteorites from Oman is currently prohibited by national law, but a number of international hunters continue to remove specimens now deemed national treasures. This new law provoked a small [[international incident]], as its implementation preceded any public notification of such a law, resulting in the prolonged imprisonment of a large group of meteorite hunters, primarily from Russia, but whose party also consisted of members from the US as well as several other European countries.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==Meteorites in history==
Meteorite falls may have been the source of [[Temple of Artemis#Ephesian Artemis|cultish worship]]. The cult in the [[Temple of Artemis|Temple of Artemis at Ephesus]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], possibly originated with the observation and recovery of a meteorite that was understood by contemporaries to have fallen to the earth from [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the principal Roman deity.&lt;ref&gt;"And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?" {{bibleverse||Acts|19:35|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are reports that a sacred stone was enshrined at the temple that may have been a meteorite. The [[Black Stone]] set into the wall of the [[Kaaba]] has often been presumed to be a meteorite, but the little available evidence for this is inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1980Metic..15...87T ''New Light on the Origin of the Holy Black Stone of the Ka'ba''].

The oldest known iron artifacts are nine small beads hammered from meteoritic iron. They were found in northern Egypt and have been securely dated to 3200 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Thilo Rehren and 14 others (2013), "5,000 years old Egyptian iron beads made from hammered meteoritic iron", ''Journal of Archaeological Science'', [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2013.06.002 doi]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, a stone meteorite was uncovered during an archaeological dig at Danebury Iron Age hillfort, Danebury England. It was found deposited part way down in an [[Iron Age]] pit (c. 1200 BC). Since it must have been deliberately placed there, this could indicate one of the first (known) human finds of a meteorite in Europe.

Some Native Americans treated meteorites as ceremonial objects. In 1915, a {{convert|135|lb|adj=on|order=flip}} iron meteorite was found in a [[Sinagua]] (c. 1100–1200 AD) burial cyst near [[Camp Verde, Arizona]], respectfully wrapped in a feather cloth.&lt;ref name="Nininger"&gt;H. H. Nininger, 1972, ''Find a Falling Star'' (autobiography), New York, Paul S. Erikson.&lt;/ref&gt; A small pallasite was found in a pottery jar in an old burial found at [[Pojoaque Pueblo]], [[New Mexico]]. Nininger reports several other such instances, in the Southwest US and elsewhere, such as the discovery of Native American beads of [[meteoric iron]] found in Hopewell [[Tumulus|burial mounds]], and the discovery of the Winona meteorite in a Native American stone-walled crypt.&lt;ref name="Nininger"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.

[[File:Meteorite iron harpoon.jpg|thumb|A lance made from a [[Narwhal]] [[tusk]] with a meteorite iron head]]
[[Indigenous peoples]] often prized iron-nickel meteorites as an easy, if limited, source of iron metal. For example, the Inuit used chips of the [[Cape York meteorite]] to form cutting edges for tools and spear tips.

Two of the oldest recorded [[meteorite falls]] in Europe are the [[Elbogen (meteorite)|Elbogen]] (1400) and [[Ensisheim (meteorite)|Ensisheim]] (1492) meteorites. The German physicist, [[Ernst Florens Chladni]], was the first to publish (in 1794) the then audacious idea that meteorites were rocks from space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Henry Smith|title=A history of science|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hNEFAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA168|volume=3|year=1904|publisher=Harper|page=168ff|chapter=5|isbn=0-250-40142-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; His booklet was ''"On the Origin of the Iron Masses Found by [[Peter Simon Pallas|Pallas]] and Others Similar to it, and on Some Associated Natural Phenomena"''.&lt;ref&gt;Chladni, Ernst Florens Friedrich, ''Über den Ursprung der von Pallas gefundenen und anderer ihr ähnlicher Eisenmassen und über einige damit in Verbindung stehende Naturerscheinungen'' [On the origin of the iron masses found by [[Peter Simon Pallas|Pallas]] and others similar to it, and on some natural phenomena associated with them] (Riga, Latvia: Johann Friedrich Hartknoch, 1794).

One of the leading [[theory|theories]] for the cause of the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] that included the [[dinosaur]]s is a large meteorite impact. The [[Chicxulub Crater]] has been identified as the site of this impact. There has been a lively scientific debate as to whether other major extinctions, including the ones at the end of the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event|Permian]] and [[Triassic-Jurassic extinction event|Triassic]] periods might also have been the result of large impact events, but the evidence is much less compelling than for the end Cretaceous extinction.

There are several reported instances of falling meteorites having killed people and livestock, but a few of these appear more credible than others. The most infamous reported fatality from a meteorite impact is that of an Egyptian dog that was killed in 1911, although this report is highly disputed. This meteorite fall was identified in the 1980s as [[Mars|Martian]] in origin. There is substantial evidence that the meteorite known as Valera (Venezuela 1972, see [[Meteorite fall]]) hit and killed a cow upon impact, nearly dividing the animal in two, and similar unsubstantiated reports of a horse being struck and killed by a stone of the New Concord fall also abound. Throughout history, many first- and second-hand reports of meteorites falling on and killing both humans and other animals abound. One example is from 1490 AD in China, which purportedly killed thousands of people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.tpg.com.au/horsts/spacegd2.html#china1490AD E-mail] from Dr Jin Zhu, Beijing Astronomical Observatory&lt;/ref&gt; John Lewis has compiled some of these reports, and summarizes, "No one in recorded history has ever been killed by a meteorite in the presence of a meteoriticist and a medical doctor" and "reviewers who make sweeping negative conclusions usually do not cite any of the primary publications in which the eyewitnesses describe their experiences, and give no evidence of having read them".&lt;ref&gt;''Rain of Iron and Ice'' by John Lewis, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0201154948}}, p. 162-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another claim was put forth by a young boy who stated that he had been hit by a small (~3-[[gram]]) stone of the Mbale meteorite fall from [[Uganda]], and who stood to gain nothing from this assertion. The stone reportedly fell through banana leaves before striking the boy on the head, causing little to no pain, as it was small enough to have been slowed by both [[friction]] with the atmosphere as well as that with banana leaves, before striking the boy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jenniskens|first=Peter|title=The Mbale Meteorite Shower|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1994Metic..29..246J|volume=29|issue=2|journal=Meteoritics|pages=246–254 |bibcode=1994Metic..29..246J |doi=10.1111/j.1945-5100.1994.tb00678.x|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meteorite weathering==
{{see also|Meteorite weathering}}
Most meteorites date from the oldest times in the solar system and are by far the oldest material available on the planet. Despite their age, they are fairly vulnerable to terrestrial environment: water, salt, and oxygen attack the meteorites as soon they reach the ground.

The terrestrial alteration of meteorites is called [[meteorite weathering|weathering]]. In order to quantify the degree of alteration that a meteorite experienced, several qualitative weathering indices have been applied to Antarctic and desertic samples.&lt;ref name=weatheringofchondritic&gt;P. A. Bland, M. E. Zolensky, G. K. Benedix, M. A. Sephton. ''"[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/books/MESSII/9041.pdf Weathering of Chondritic Meteorites]"''&lt;/ref&gt;

The most known weathering scale, used for [[ordinary chondrite]]s, ranges from [[Meteorite weathering scales#Weathering scales|W0]] (pristine state) to [[Meteorite weathering scales|W6]] (heavy alteration).

==Fossil meteorites==
"Fossil" meteorites are sometimes discovered by geologists. They represent the deeply weathered remains of meteorites that fell to Earth in the remote past and were preserved in sedimentary deposits sufficiently well that they can be recognized through mineralogical and geochemical studies. One limestone quarry in Sweden has produced an anomalously large number (more than a hundred) fossil meteorites from the [[Ordovician]], nearly all of which are deeply weathered L-chondrites that still resemble the original meteorite under a  petrographic microscope, but which have had their original material almost entirely replaced by terrestrial secondary mineralization. The extraterrestrial provenance was demonstrated in part through isotopic analysis of relict [[spinel]] grains, a mineral that is common in meteorites, is insoluble in water, and is able to persist chemically unchanged in the terrestrial weathering environment. One of these fossil meteorites, dubbed Österplana 065, appears to represent a distinct type of meteorite that is "extinct" in the sense that it is no longer falling to Earth, the parent body having already been completely depleted from reservoir of Near Earth Objects.&lt;ref name="New Material"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmitz|first1=B.|last2=Yin|first2=Q. -Z|last3=Sanborn|first3=M.E.|last4=Tassinari|first4=M.|last5=Caplan|first5=C.E.|last6=Huss|first6=G.R.|title=A new type of solar-system material recovered from Ordovician marine limestone|journal=Nature Communications|date=14 June 2016|volume=7|doi=10.1038/ncomms11851|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms11851|accessdate=9 September 2017|bibcode=2016NatCo...711851S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pan American Day''' is a holiday observed by several countries in North and South America. It commemorates the [[First International Conference of American States]] which concluded on April 14, 1890, creating the International Union of American Republics, the forerunner to the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS).&lt;ref name=Osmanczyk&gt;{{cite book|last=Osmańczyk|first=Edmund Jan|title=Encyclopedia of the United Nations and International Agreements|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0415939216|page=1759|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The holiday was originally proposed by the organization in 1930, and was first observed on April 14, 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DeConde|first=Alexander|title=Herbert Hoover's Latin-American Policy|year=1951|publisher=Stanford University Press|pages=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Customs/Traditions:
Parades are held, some schools put on plays, the orchestra plays music, people set up exhibits, and pageants are sometimes held.

==Belize==
In [[Belize]] "Pan American Day" refers to October 12, which is celebrated as [[Columbus Day]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Belize celebrates Pan American Day|url=http://www.breakingbelizenews.com/2016/10/10/belize-celebrates-pan-american-day/|accessdate=12 October 2016|work=Breaking Belize News|date=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phenylalanine''' (symbol '''Phe''' or '''F''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/AminoAcid/AA1n2.html | title = Nomenclature and Symbolism for Amino Acids and Peptides | publisher = IUPAC-IUB Joint Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature | year = 1983 | accessdate = 5 March 2018| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081009023202/http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/AminoAcid/AA1n2.html| archivedate= 9 October 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an essential α-[[amino acid]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] {{chem|C|9|H|11|N|O|2}}. It can be viewed as a [[benzyl]] group [[substituent|substituted]] for the [[methyl group]] of [[alanine]], or a [[phenyl]] group in place of a terminal hydrogen of alanine. This [[essential amino acid]] is classified as neutral, and [[chemical polarity|nonpolar]] because of the inert and [[hydrophobic]] nature of the [[benzyl]] side chain. The [[chirality (chemistry)#Naming conventions|&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-isomer]] is used to biochemically form [[protein]]s, coded for by [[DNA]]. Phenylalanine is a precursor for [[tyrosine]], the [[monoamine neurotransmitter]]s [[dopamine]], [[norepinephrine]] (noradrenaline), and [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline), and the skin [[pigment]] [[melanin]]. It is [[Genetic code|encoded]] by the [[codons]] UUU and UUC.

Phenylalanine is found naturally in the [[breast milk]] of [[mammal]]s. It is used in the manufacture of food and drink products and sold as a nutritional supplement for its reputed [[analgesic]] and [[antidepressant]] effects.  It is a direct precursor to the [[neuromodulation|neuromodulator]] [[phenethylamine]], a commonly used [[dietary supplement]]. As an essential amino acid, phenylalanine is not synthesized [[De novo synthesis|de novo]] in humans and other animals, who must ingest phenylalanine or phenylalanine-containing proteins.

==History==
The first description of phenylalanine was made in 1879, when Schulze and Barbieri identified a compound with the [[empirical formula]], C&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, in [[Lupinus luteus|yellow lupine]] (''Lupinus luteus'') seedlings. In 1882, [[Emil Erlenmeyer|Erlenmeyer]] and Lipp first synthesized phenylalanine from [[phenylacetaldehyde]], hydrogen cyanide, and ammonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | vauthors = Thorpe TE | authorlink = Thomas Edward Thorpe | title = A Dictionary of Applied Chemistry | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6uVYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA191 | accessdate = 2012-06-04 | year = 1913 | publisher = Longmans, Green, and Co. | pages = 191–193 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | vauthors = Plimmer RH | veditors = Plimmer RH,  Hopkins FG | title = The Chemical Composition of the Proteins | url = https://books.google.com/?id=7JM8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA93 | accessdate = 2012-06-04 | edition = 2nd | series = Monographs on Biochemistry | volume = Part I. Analysis | origyear = 1908 | year = 1912 | publisher = Longmans, Green and Co. | location = London | pages = 93–97 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genetic [[codon]] for phenylalanine was first discovered by [[J. Heinrich Matthaei]] and [[Marshall W. Nirenberg]] in 1961. They showed that by using [[messenger RNA|mRNA]] to insert multiple [[uracil]] repeats into the [[genome]] of the [[bacterium]] ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', they could cause the bacterium to produce a [[peptide|polypeptide]] consisting solely of repeated phenylalanine amino acids. This discovery helped to establish the nature of the [[coding strand|coding]] relationship that links information stored in [[genome|genomic]] nucleic acid with [[proteome|protein expression]] in the living cell.

==Dietary sources==
Good sources of phenylalanine are eggs, chicken, liver, beef, milk, and soybeans.&lt;ref name="RossRoth1991"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Harvey M. | last1 = Ross | first2 = June | last2 = Roth | name-list-format = vanc | title = The Mood Control Diet: 21 Days to Conquering Depression and Fatigue | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hHWQCZvGUMEC | date = 1 April 1991 | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster | isbn = 978-0-13-590449-7 | page = 59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dietary recommendations==
The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the U.S. Institute of Medicine set Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for [[essential amino acid]]s in 2002. For phenylalanine plus tyrosine, for adults 19 years and older, 33&amp;nbsp;mg/kg body weight/day.&lt;ref name="DRItext"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = [[Institute of Medicine]] | title = Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrates, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids | chapter = Protein and Amino Acids | publisher = The National Academies Press | year = 2002 | location = Washington, DC | pages = 589–768 | url = https://www.nap.edu/read/10490/chapter/12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other biological roles==
&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-Phenylalanine is biologically converted into &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-[[tyrosine]], another one of the DNA-encoded amino acids.  &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-tyrosine in turn is converted into [[L-DOPA]], which is further converted into [[dopamine]], [[norepinephrine]] (noradrenaline), and [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline). The latter three are known as the [[catecholamines]].

Phenylalanine uses the same active transport channel as [[tryptophan]] to cross the [[blood–brain barrier]]. In excessive quantities, supplementation can interfere with the production of [[serotonin]] and other [[aromatic amino acid]]s as well as [[nitric oxide]] due to the overuse (eventually, limited availability) of the associated cofactors, [[iron]] or [[tetrahydrobiopterin]].{{mcn|date=January 2018}} The corresponding enzymes in for those compounds are the [[aromatic amino acid hydroxylase]] family and [[nitric oxide synthase]].{{Phenylalanine biosynthesis|caption=Phenylalanine in humans may ultimately be metabolized into a range of different substances.}}&lt;!--
--&gt;

===In plants===
Phenylalanine is the starting compound used in the [[biosynthesis|synthesis]] of  [[flavonoid]]s.  [[Lignan]] is derived from phenylalanine and from [[tyrosine]]. Phenylalanine is converted to [[cinnamic acid]] by the enzyme [[phenylalanine ammonia-lyase]].&lt;ref name=Nelson&gt;{{ cite book | vauthors = Nelson DL, Cox MM | title = Lehninger, Principles of Biochemistry | edition = 3rd | publisher = Worth Publishing | location = New York | year = 2000 | isbn = 1-57259-153-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phenylketonuria==
{{main|Phenylketonuria}}
The genetic disorder [[phenylketonuria]] (PKU) is the inability to metabolize phenylalanine because of a lack of the enzyme [[phenylalanine hydroxylase]]. Individuals with this disorder are known as "phenylketonurics" and must regulate their intake of phenylalanine. Phenylketonurics often use blood tests to monitor the amount of phenylalanine in their blood.  Lab results may report phenylalanine levels using either mg/dL and μmol/L. One mg/dL of phenylalanine is approximately equivalent to 60 μmol/L.

A (rare) "variant form" of phenylketonuria called [[hyperphenylalaninemia]] is caused by the inability to synthesize a [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] called [[tetrahydrobiopterin]], which can be supplemented. Pregnant women with hyperphenylalaninemia may show similar symptoms of the disorder (high levels of phenylalanine in blood) but these indicators will usually disappear at the end of gestation.  Pregnant women with PKU must control their blood phenylalanine levels even if the fetus is heterozygous for the defective gene because the fetus could be adversely affected due to hepatic immaturity.{{medcn|date=April 2016}}

A non-food source of phenylalanine is the artificial sweetener [[aspartame]]. This compound is metabolized by the body into several chemical byproducts including phenylalanine. The breakdown problems phenylketonurics have with the buildup of phenylalanine in the body also occurs with the ingestion of aspartame, although to a lesser degree. Accordingly, all products in Australia, the U.S. and Canada that contain aspartame must be labeled: "Phenylketonurics: Contains phenylalanine." In the UK, foods containing aspartame must carry ingredient panels that refer to the presence of "aspartame or E951"&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/chemsafe/additivesbranch/sweeteners/55174#h_4 | title = Aspartame | publisher = Food Standards Agency | location = UK }}&lt;/ref&gt; and they must be labeled with a warning "Contains a source of phenylalanine." In Brazil, the label "Contém Fenilalanina" (Portuguese for "Contains Phenylalanine") is also mandatory in products which contain it. These warnings are placed to help individuals avoid such foods.

Geneticists sequenced the genome of [[macaques]] in 2007. Their investigations found "some instances where the normal form of the macaque protein looked like the diseased human protein" including markers for PKU.&lt;ref name = "Gibbs_2007"/&gt;

==&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-, &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;- and &lt;small&gt;DL&lt;/small&gt;-phenylalanine==
The [[stereoisomer]] &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-phenylalanine (DPA) can be produced by conventional [[organic synthesis]], either as a single [[enantiomer]] or as a component of the [[racemic]] mixture. It does not participate in [[protein biosynthesis]] although it is found in proteins in small amounts - particularly aged proteins and food proteins that have been [[processed food|processed]]. The biological functions of &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids remain unclear, although &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-phenylalanine has [[pharmacological activity]] at [[niacin receptor 2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=D-phenylalanine|url=http://www.iuphar-db.org/DATABASE/LigandDisplayForward?tab=biology&amp;ligandId=5797|website=IUPHAR|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;small&gt;DL&lt;/small&gt;-Phenylalanine (DLPA) is marketed as a nutritional supplement for its purported [[analgesic]] and [[antidepressant]] activities.  &lt;small&gt;DL&lt;/small&gt;-Phenylalanine is a mixture of &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-phenylalanine and &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-phenylalanine. The reputed analgesic activity of &lt;small&gt;DL&lt;/small&gt;-phenylalanine may be explained by the possible blockage by &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-phenylalanine of [[enkephalin]]  [[Chemical decomposition|degradation]] by the [[enzyme]] [[carboxypeptidase A]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Christianson DW, Mangani S, Shoham G, Lipscomb WN | title = Binding of D-phenylalanine and D-tyrosine to carboxypeptidase A | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 264 | issue = 22 | pages = 12849–53 | date = August 1989 | pmid = 2568989 | url = http://www.jbc.org/content/264/22/12849.full.pdf | format = pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism of &lt;small&gt;DL&lt;/small&gt;-phenylalanine's supposed antidepressant activity may be accounted for by the [[protein precursor|precursor]] role of &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-phenylalanine in the synthesis of the [[neurotransmitters]] [[norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]]. Elevated brain levels of norepinephrine and dopamine are thought to have an antidepressant effect.  &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-Phenylalanine is absorbed from the small intestine and transported to the liver via the [[portal circulation]]. A small amount of &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-phenylalanine appears to be converted to &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-phenylalanine. &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-Phenylalanine is distributed to the various tissues of the body via the [[systemic circulation]]. It appears to cross the [[blood–brain barrier]] less efficiently than &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-phenylalanine, and so a small amount of an ingested dose of &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-phenylalanine is excreted in the [[urine]] without penetrating the central nervous system.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Commercial synthesis==
&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-Phenylalanine is produced for medical, feed, and nutritional applications, such as [[aspartame]], in large quantities by utilizing the bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', which naturally produces [[aromatic amino acids]] like phenylalanine.  The quantity of &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-phenylalanine produced commercially has been increased by [[genetic engineering|genetically engineering]] ''E. coli'', such as by altering the regulatory [[Promoter (biology)|promoters]] or amplifying the number of [[genes]] controlling enzymes responsible for the synthesis of the amino acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last = Sprenger  | first = G.

'''''Picea glauca''''', the '''white spruce''',&lt;ref&gt;{{PLANTS|id=PIGL|taxon=Picea glauca|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a species of [[spruce]] native to the northern temperate and [[boreal forest]]s in North America. ''Picea glauca'' was originally native from central Alaska all through the east, across southern/central Canada to the [[Avalon Peninsula]] in Newfoundland. It now has become naturalized southward into the far northern United States border states like Montana, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine; there is also an isolated population in the [[Black Hills]] of South Dakota and Wyoming.&lt;ref name=farjonrushforthc&gt;{{cite book |last=Farjon |first=A. |date=1990 |title=Pinaceae.

== Description ==
The white spruce is a large [[coniferous]] [[evergreen]] [[tree]] which grows normally to {{Convert|15|to|30|m|ft|round=5|abbr=on}} tall, but can grow up to {{Convert|40|m|ft|round=5|abbr=on}} tall with a trunk [[Diameter at breast height|diameter]] of up to {{Convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The [[Bark (botany)|bark]] is thin and scaly, flaking off in small circular plates {{convert|5|to|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} across. The crown is narrow – conic in young trees, becoming cylindric in older trees. The shoots are pale buff-brown, [[glabrous]] (hairless) in the east of the range, but often [[Pubescent (botany)|pubescent]] in the west, and with prominent [[pulvini]]. The [[leaf|leaves]] are needle-like, {{Convert|12|to|20|mm|in|frac=16|abbr=on}} long, rhombic (diamond-shaped) in cross-section, [[glaucous]] blue-green above (whence ''glauca'') with several thin lines of [[stomata]], and blue-white below with two broad bands of stomata.&lt;ref name=farjonrushforthc/&gt;

The [[conifer cone|cones]] are pendulous, slender, cylindrical, {{Convert|3|to|7|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1.5|cm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}} wide when closed, opening to {{Convert|2.5|cm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}} broad. They have thin, flexible scales {{Convert|15|mm|in|abbr=on}} long, with a smoothly rounded margin. They are green or reddish, maturing to pale brown 4 to 8 months after pollination. The [[seed]]s are black, {{Convert|2|to|3|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} long, with a slender, {{Convert|5|to|8|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} long pale brown wing.&lt;ref name=farjonrushforthc/&gt;

=== Seeds ===
[[File:Picea glauca seeds pigl 001 php.jpg|thumb|Seeds]]
[[Seed]]s are small ({{convert|2.5|to|5.0|mm|in|disp=or|frac=32|abbr=in}} long), oblong, and acute at the base. Determinations of the average number of sound seeds per white spruce cone have ranged from 32 to 130 (Waldron 1965, Zasada and Viereck 1970).&lt;ref name="waldron2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Waldron |first=R.M. |date=1965 |title=Cone production and seedfall in a mature white spruce stand |journal=For. Chron. |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=314–329}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zas1"&gt;Zasada, J.C.; Viereck, L.A. 1970. White spruce cone and seed production in interior Alaska, 1957–68. USDA, For. Serv., Pacific NW For. Range Exp. Sta., Portland OR, Res. Note PNW-129. 11 p. [Coates et al. 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;

Common causes of empty seed are lack of [[pollination]], abortion of the [[ovule]], and insect damage.

The average weight per individual seed varies from 1.1&amp;nbsp;mg to 3.2&amp;nbsp;mg (Hellum 1976, Zasada et al. 1978).&lt;ref&gt;Hellum, A.K. 1976. Grading seed by weight in white spruce. USDA, For. Serv., Tree Plant. Notes 27(1):16–17, 23–24. (Cited in Coates et al. 1994).&lt;br&gt;- Zasada, J.C.; Foote, M.J.; Deneke, F.J.; Parkerson, R.H. 1978. Case history of an excellent white spruce cone and seed crop in interior Alaska: cone and seed production, germination and seedling survival. USDA, For. Serv., Pacific NW For. Range Exp. Sta., Portland OR, Gen. Tech. Rep. PNW-65. 53 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each seed is clasped by a thin wing 2 to 4 times as long as the seed. Seed and wing are appressed to the cone scale. Embryo and [[Gametophyte|megagametophyte]] are soft and translucent at first; later the endosperm becomes firm and milky white, while the embryo becomes cream-colored or light yellow. At maturity, the testa darkens rapidly from light brown to dark brown or black (Crossley 1953).&lt;ref name="cross2"&gt;Crossley, D.I. 1953. Seed maturity in white spruce. Canada Dep. Resour. and Devel., For. Branch, For. Res. Div., Ottawa ON, Silv. Res. Note 104. 16 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Mature seed “snaps in two” when cut by a sharp knife on a firm surface (Crossley 1953).&lt;ref name="cross2" /&gt;

White spruce cones reach their maximum size after 800 growing degree days (GDD). Cone moisture content decreases gradually after about 1000 GDD (Cram and Worden 1957)&lt;ref name="cram2"&gt;Cram, W.H.; Worden, H.A. 1957. Maturity of white spruce cones and seed. For. Sci. 3:263–269.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cone colour also can be used to help determine the degree of maturation, but cones may be red, pink or green (Teich 1970).&lt;ref name="teich"&gt;Teich, A.H. 1970. Genetic control of female flower color and random mating in white spruce. Can. Dep. Fish. For., Can. For. Serv., Ottawa ON, Bi-mo. Res. Notes 26:2.&lt;/ref&gt; Collection and storage dates and conditions influence [[germination]] requirements and early seedling growth (Zasada 1973, Edwards 1977, Winston and Haddon 1981).&lt;ref name="zas2"&gt;Zasada, J.C. 1973. Effect of cone storage method and collection date on Alaskan white spruce (''Picea glauca'') seed quality. p. 1–10 (paper 19) ''in'' Proc. Seed Problems. IUFRO Symp. Seed Processing, Bergen, Norway.  Working Party S2.01, Royal Coll. For., Bergen, Norway, Vol. 1. [Coates et al. 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="edwards2"&gt;Edwards, I.K. 1977. Fertility of transplant fields at the Prince Albert Forest Nursery. Can. Dep. Fish. Environ., Can. For. Serv., Northern For. Res. Centre, Edmonton AB, Inf. Rep. NOR-X-189. 21 p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wins"&gt;Winston, D.A.; Haddon, B.D. 1981. Effects of early cone collection and artificial ripening on white spruce and red pine germination. Can. J. For. Res. 11:817–826.&lt;/ref&gt;

A bushel (35 L) of cones, which may contain 6500 to 8000 cones, yields {{convert|6|to|20|oz|g}} of clean seed (USDA Forest Service 1948).&lt;ref name="usda"&gt;USDA Forest Service. 1948. Woody-plant Seed Manual. USDA, For. Serv., Washington DC, Misc. Publ. 654. 416 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seed dispersal begins after cone scales reflex with cone maturation in the late summer or early fall of the year of formation. Cones open at moisture contents of 45% to 70% and specific gravities of 0.6 to 0.8 (Cram and Worden 1957, Zasada 1973, Winston and Haddon 1981).&lt;ref name="cram2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="zas2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wins" /&gt; Weather affects both the initiation and pattern of seed dispersal (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990),&lt;ref name="SilvicsNA" /&gt; but cone opening and the pattern of seed dispersal can vary among trees in the same stand (Zasada 1986). Even after dispersal has begun, cold, damp weather will cause cone scales to close; they will reopen during dry weather. Most seed falls early rather than late, but dispersal may continue through fall and winter (Zasada 1986),&lt;ref name="zas5"&gt;Zasada, J. 1986. Natural regeneration of trees and tall shrubs on forest sites in interior Alaska. p. 44–73'' in'' Van Cleve, K.; Chapin, F.S.; Flanagan, P.W.; Viereck, L.A.; Dyrness, C.T. (Eds.). Forest Ecosystems in the Alaskan [[Taiga]]: a Synthesis of Structure and Function. Springer-Verlag New York NY.&lt;/ref&gt; even into the next growing season (Rowe 1953).&lt;ref name="rowea"&gt;Rowe, J.S. 1953. Viable seed on white spruce trees in midsummer. Can. Dep. Northern Affairs and National Resources, For. Branch, For. Res. Div., Ottawa ON, Silv. Leafl. 99. 2 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Seed dispersal occurs mainly in late summer or early fall (Waldron 1965).&lt;ref name="waldron2" /&gt;

White spruce seed is initially dispersed through the air by wind. Both the initiation and pattern of seed dispersal depend on the weather (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990),&lt;ref name="SilvicsNA" /&gt; but these can vary among trees in the same stand (Zasada 1986).&lt;ref name="zas5" /&gt; Small amounts of white spruce seed are normally dispersed beyond 100&amp;nbsp;m from the seed source, but exceptionally seeds have been found more than 300–400 m from the nearest seed source (Zasada 1986).&lt;ref name="zas5" /&gt;

=== Root system ===
[[File:Photograph of Nursery Stock at Cass Lake Nursery - NARA - 2128140.tif|thumb|left|Nursery seedlings showing roots]]
The [[Root|root system]] of white spruce is highly variable and adaptable (Wagg 1964, 1967),&lt;ref name="wagg1"&gt;Wagg, J.W.G. 1964. White spruce regeneration on the Peace and Slave River lowlands. Can. Dep. For., For. Res. Branch, Ottawa ON, Publ. 1069. 35 p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wagg2"&gt;Wagg, J.W.B. 1967. Origin and development of white spruce root-forms. Can. Dep. For. Rural Devel., For. Branch, Ottawa ON, Publ. 1192. 45 p.&lt;/ref&gt; responding to a variety of edaphic factors, especially soil moisture, soil fertility, and mechanical impedance. On soils that limit rooting depth, the root system is plate-like, but it is a common misconception to assume that white spruce is genetically constrained to develop plate-like root systems irrespective of [[soil]] conditions (Sutton 1969).&lt;ref name="sutton3"&gt;Sutton, R.F. 1969. Form and development of conifer root systems. Commonw. For. Bureau, Oxford, U.K., Tech. Communication No. 7. 131 p.&lt;/ref&gt; In the nursery, or naturally in the forest, white spruce usually develops several long “running” roots just below the ground surface (Mullin 1957).&lt;ref name="mullin1"&gt;Mullin, R.E. 1957. Experiments with root and top pruning of white spruce nursery stock. Ont. Dep. Lands For., Res. Div., Toronto ON, Res. Rep. 36. 31 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure of the tracheids in the long lateral roots of white spruce varies with soil [[nitrogen]] availability (Krasowski and Owens 1999).&lt;ref name="kraso"&gt;Krasowski, M.J.; Owens, J.N. 1999. Tracheids in white spruce seedling’s long lateral roots in response to nitrogen availability. Plant and Soil 217(1/2):215–228.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stem ===
[[File:White Spruce bark detail, Chalco Hills.jpg|thumb|Trunk; bark is scaly or flaky and grey-brown]]
White spruce can live for several hundred years. Ages of 200 to 300 years are commonly attained throughout much of the range, and Dallimore and Jackson (1961)&lt;ref name="dall"&gt;Dallimore, W.; Jackson, A.B. 1961. A Handbook of Coniferae including Ginkgoaceae, 3rd (1948) ed. reprinted with corrections. Arnold, London, U.K. 686 p.&lt;/ref&gt; estimated the normal lifespan of white spruce at 250 to 300 years.

Slow-growing trees in rigorous [[climate]]s are also capable of great longevity. White spruce {{convert|6|to|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} high on the shore of Urquhart Lake, Northwest Territories, were found to be more than 300 years old (Hare and Ritchie 1972),&lt;ref name="hare"&gt;Hare, F.K.; Ritchie, J. 1972. The boreal bioclimates. Geogr. Rev. 62:333–365.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bark ===
The bark of mature white spruce is scaly or flaky, grey-brown (Brayshaw 1960)&lt;ref name="bray"&gt;Brayshaw, T.C. 1960. Key to the native trees of Canada. Canada Dep. For., Bull. 125. 43 p.&lt;/ref&gt; or ash-brown (Harlow and Harrar 1950),&lt;ref name="harlow"&gt;Harlow, W.M.; Harrar, E.S. 1950. Textbook of Dendrology, 3rd ed. McGraw-Hill, New York NY. 555 p.&lt;/ref&gt; but silvery when freshly exposed. Resin blisters are normally lacking, but the Porsild spruce ''Picea glauca'' var. ''porsildii'' Raup has been credited with having smooth resin-blistered bark (Hosie 1969).&lt;ref name="hosie"&gt;Hosie, R.C. 1969. Native Trees of Canada, 7th ed. Can. Dep. Fish. For., Can. For. Serv., Ottawa ON. 380 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

White spruce bark is mostly less than {{convert|8|mm|in|disp=or|frac=16|abbr=on}} (Hale 1955)&lt;ref name="hale3"&gt;Hale, J.D. 1955. Thickness and density of bark. Pulp and Paper Mag.

White spruce has a transcontinental range in North America. In Canada, its [[contiguous distribution]] encompasses virtually the whole of the [[Boreal forest of Canada|Boreal]], Subalpine, Montane, Columbia, Great Lakes – St. Lawrence, and [[Acadian Forest]] Regions (Rowe 1972),&lt;ref name="rowe"&gt;Rowe, J.S 1972.

It reaches within 100&amp;nbsp;km of the [[Pacific Ocean]] in the [[Skeena Valley]], overlapping with the range of [[Sitka spruce]] (''Picea sitchensis'' [Bong.] Carr.), and almost reaching the [[Arctic Ocean]] at latitude 69° N in the [[District of Mackenzie]], with white spruce up to 15&amp;nbsp;m high occurring on some of the islands in the Delta near [[Inuvik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enr.gov.nt.ca/programs/forest-resources/inventory-and-analysis |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120135805/http://www.enr.gov.nt.ca/programs/forest-resources/inventory-and-analysis |archive-date=2015-01-20 |title=Inventory and Analysis |publisher=Environment and Natural Resources, Government of Northwest Territories}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The wide variety of ecological conditions in which 4 Quebec [[conifers]], including white spruce, are able to establish themselves, was noted by Lafond (1966),&lt;ref name="lafond"&gt;Lafond, A. 1966.

In the United States, the range of white spruce extends into Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Alaska (Sargent 1922, Harlow and Harrar 1950),&lt;ref name="harlow"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sargent2"&gt;Sargent, C.S. 1922.

White spruce is the northernmost tree species in North America, reaching just north of 69°N latitude in the Mackenzie River delta.&lt;ref&gt;Arno, S. F. &amp; Hammerly, R. P. (1984). ''Timberline. Mountain and Arctic Forest Frontiers''. The Mountaineers, Seattle. {{ISBN|0-89886-085-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It grows between [[sea level]] and an [[elevation]] of {{Convert|1520|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Its northern distribution roughly correlates to the location of the [[tree line]], which includes an [[isotherm (contour line)|isothermic]] value of {{Convert|10|C|F}} for mean [[temperature]] in July, as well as the position of the [[Arctic front]]; cumulative summer degree days, mean net radiation, and the amount of light intensities also figure. White spruce is generally found in regions where the [[growing season]] exceeds 60 days annually.&lt;ref name="SilvicsNA" /&gt;

[[File:Mt Bigelow West Peak Maine.JPG|thumb|Mixed forest with balsam fir (''[[Abies balsamea]]'') at the southern edge of the white spruce range in [[Maine]] on the West Peak of [[Mount Bigelow (Maine)|Mount Bigelow]]]]
The southern edge of the zone in which white spruce forms 60% or more of the total stand corresponds more or less to the July isotherm of {{Convert|18|C|F}} around the [[Great Lakes]]; in the [[Prairie Provinces]] its limit is north of this isotherm. During the [[summer solstice]], [[day length]] values range from 17 hours at its southern limits to 24 hours above the [[Arctic Circle]].&lt;ref name="SilvicsNA" /&gt;

One of the hardiest [[conifers]], white spruce in parts of its range withstands mean daily January temperature of {{convert|-6.7|C|F}} and extreme minimum temperatures as low as {{convert|-56.5|C|F}}; minimum temperatures of {{convert|-50|C|F}} are general throughout much of the range except the southernmost and southeasternmost parts (Fowells 1965).&lt;ref name="fowells"&gt;Fowells, H.A. 1965. ''Picea ''(spruces). p. 287–327'' in'' Silvics of Forest Trees of the United States. H.A. Fowells (Compiler), USDA, Forest Service, Washington DC, Agric. Handbook No. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; By itself, or with black spruce and [[tamarack]] (''Larix laricina''), white spruce forms the northern boundary of tree-form growth (Sutton 1969).&lt;ref name="sutton2"&gt;Sutton, R.F. 1969. Silvics of white spruce (''Picea glauca'' [Moench] Voss). Can. Dep. Fish. For., For. Branch, Ottawa ON, Publ. 1250. 57 p. (Cited in Coates et al. 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; White spruce up to 15&amp;nbsp;m in height occur at 69°N on islands in the Mackenzie Delta near Inuvik in the Northwest Territories. Hustich (1966)&lt;ref name="hust2"&gt;Hustich, I. 1966. On the forest–tundra and the northern tree-lines. Annales Univ. Turku A.II, Vol. 36:7–47.&lt;/ref&gt; depicted ''Picea'' spp. as forming the northernmost limit of tree growth in North America.

The [[arctic]] or northern timberline in North America forms a broad transition zone from Labrador to northern Alaska. In Labrador, white spruce is not abundant and constitutes less than 5% of the forest, with a range that coincides very closely with that of black spruce but extending slightly further north (Wilton 1964).&lt;ref name="wilton"&gt;Wilton, R.F. 1964. The forests of Labrador. Can. Dep. For., For. Res. Branch, Ottawa ON, Publ. 1066. 72 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

The range of white spruce extends westwards from Newfoundland and Labrador, and along the northern limit of trees to Hudson Bay, Northwest Territories, Yukon, and into northwestern Alaska (Fowells 1965).&lt;ref name="fowells" /&gt; Although Bell (1881)&lt;ref name="bell" /&gt; was emphatic that it “nowhere reaches the Atlantic coast [from which it recedes] further and further in going north”. Across western Canada and Alaska, white spruce occurs further north than [[Picea mariana|black spruce]], and, while [[Populus|poplar]] (''Populus''), [[willow]], and [[birch]] may occur along streams well into the tundra beyond the limits of spruce, the hardwoods are usually no more than scrub (Hustich 1953).&lt;ref name="hust1"&gt;Hustich, I. 1953. The boreal limits of conifers. Arctic 6:149–162.&lt;/ref&gt; Spruce characteristically occurs in fingers of tree-form forest, extending far down the northern rivers and as scattered clumps of dwarfed “bush” spruce on intervening lands (Munns 1938, Halliday and Brown 1943).&lt;ref name="munns" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hall2"&gt;Halliday, W.E.D.; Brown, A.W.A. 1943. The distribution of some important forest trees in Canada. Ecology 24:353–373.&lt;/ref&gt; In Manitoba, Scoggan (1957, citing a 1951 but otherwise unreferenced report by Baldwin)&lt;ref name="scoggan" /&gt; noted that the northernmost collection of white spruce was at latitude 59°48’N, but Bryson et al. (1965)&lt;ref name="bryson"&gt;Bryson, R.A.; Irving, W.H.; Larson, J.A. 1965. Radiocarbon and soil evidence of former forest in the southern Canadian tundra. Science 147(3653):46–48.&lt;/ref&gt; found white spruce in the northern edge of continuous forest in central Canada at Ennadai Lake, about 60°45′ N, 101°’W, just north of the northwest corner of Manitoba. Bryson et al. (1965)&lt;ref name="bryson" /&gt; noted that the forest retained “the same general characteristics as when it was first described [by Tyrrell (1897)&lt;ref name="tyrell"&gt;Tyrell, J.B. 1897. Geol. Surv. Can., Ottawa ON, Ann. Rep. 1896, Vol. 9. (Cited by Bryson et al. 1965, orig. not seen)&lt;/ref&gt;] in 1896”. Collins and Sumner (1953)&lt;ref name="collins" /&gt; reported finding white spruce within 13&amp;nbsp;km of the Arctic coast in the Firth valley, Yukon, at about 69°30′ N, 139°30′ W, and Sargent (1922)&lt;ref name="sargent2" /&gt; noted that white spruce in Alaska “reached Behring Strait in 66°44′ N”.

[[File:Extracts from reports on the district of Ungava, recently added to the province of Quebec under the name of the territory of New Quebec (1915) (14760113996).jpg|thumb|left|White spruce in the former [[District of Ungava]], dwarfed (note seated human in white for scale, center)]]
[[Climate]], especially temperature, is obviously a factor in determining distributions of northern [[flora]]. Halliday and Brown (1943)&lt;ref name="hall2" /&gt; suggested that white spruce’s northern limit corresponds “very closely” with the July mean monthly isotherm of 10&amp;nbsp;°C in Ungava, but that the northern limit west of Hudson Bay was south of that isotherm. Other climatic factors that have been suggested as affecting the northern limit of white spruce include: cumulative summer degree days, position of the Arctic front in July, mean net radiation especially during the growing season, and low light intensities (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990).&lt;ref name="SilvicsNA" /&gt; Topography, soil conditions, and glaciation may also be important in controlling northern limits of spruce (Drew and Shanks 1965).&lt;ref name="drew"&gt;Drew, J.V.; Shanks, R.E. 1965. Landscape relationships of soils and vegetation in the forest–tundra ecotone, Upper Firth River Valley, Alaska–Canada. Ecol. Monogr. 35:285–306.&lt;/ref&gt;

The southern limit of distribution of white spruce is more complex. From east of the main range of coastal mountains in British Columbia, the southern continuous limit of white spruce is the forest/prairie interface through Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, the northern parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin, central Michigan, northeastern New York, and Maine (Fowells 1965).&lt;ref name="fowells" /&gt; Sargent (1922)&lt;ref name="sargent2" /&gt; and Harlow and Harrar (1950)&lt;ref name="harlow" /&gt; also included Vermont and New Hampshire; and, while Dame and Brooks (1901)&lt;ref name="dame"&gt;Dame, L.L.; Brooks, H. 1901. Handbook of the Trees of New England. Ginn, Boston MA. 196 p.&lt;/ref&gt; excluded New York and states further west, they included Massachusetts as far south as Amherst and Northampton, “probably the southern limit of the species” in that area. Nisbet (1905)&lt;ref name="nisbet"&gt;Nisbet, J. 1905. The Forester. Blackwood and Sons, Edinburgh and London, U.K., Vol. 1. 506 p.&lt;/ref&gt; gave the range of white spruce as extending to “Carolina”, but he did not recognize red spruce as a species and presumably included it with white spruce.

Towards the southern parts of its range, white spruce encounters increasingly effective [[ecological]] competition from [[hardwood]]s, some of which may reinforce their growth-rate or sprouting competitiveness with [[allelopathic]] depredation of [[coniferous]] [[regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] (Tubbs 1976).&lt;ref name="tubbs"&gt;Tubbs, C.H. 1976. Effect of sugar maple root exudate on seedlings of northern conifer species. USDA, For. Serv., Res. Note NC-213. 2 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Further southward extension of the distribution is inhibited by white spruce’s cold requirement.

=== White spruce as an exotic species ===
As an exotic, white spruce is widespread but uncommon. It was introduced into England (Hereman 1868)&lt;ref name="hereman"&gt;Hereman, S. 1868. Paxton’s Botanical Dictionary (Revised and corrected), Bradbury, Evans, London, U.K. 623 p.&lt;/ref&gt; and parts of continental Europe (Nisbet 1905, Jackson 1948)&lt;ref name="nisbet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jackson"&gt;Jackson, A.B. 1948. The Identification of Conifers. Arnold, London, U.K. 152 p.&lt;/ref&gt; in or soon after the year 1700, into Denmark about 1790 (Sabroe 1954),&lt;ref name="sabroe"&gt;Sabroe, A.S. 1954. Forestry in Denmark, 3rd ed. Danish Heath Soc., Copenhagen. 118 p.&lt;/ref&gt; and into [[Tasmania]] and [[Ceylon]] shortly before 1932 (Troup 1932).&lt;ref name="troup"&gt;Troup, H.S. 1932. Exotic Forest Trees in the British Empire. Clarendon Press, Oxford, U.K. 268 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nisbet (1905)&lt;ref name="nisbet" /&gt; noted that firmly-rooted white spruce served very well to stabilize windswept edges of woods in Germany. In a narrow belt of mixed Norway and white spruces over an extremely exposed hilltop crest at high elevation in northern England, the Norway spruce were “completely dwarfed” whereas the white spruce had reached heights of between 3 and 4.3 m (Guillebaud et al. 1920).&lt;ref name="guill"&gt;Guillebaud, W.H.; Steven, H.M.; Marsden, R.E. 1920. Rate of growth of conifers in the British Isles. Forestry Commission, HMSO, London, U.K.,  Bull. 3. 84 p.&lt;/ref&gt; The age of the belt was not recorded, but adjoining 66-year-old stands may have been of the same vintage.

White spruce has also been used as a minor [[plantation]] species in England (Selby 1842, Anon. 1879)&lt;ref name="selby"&gt;Selby, P.J. 1842. A history of British forest-trees. Van Voorst, London. 540 p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="anon"&gt;Anon. (C.P.J.) 1879. Fir. pp. 222–225 ''in'' vol IX. Encyclopædia Britannica, 9th ed.&lt;/ref&gt; and Scotland (United Kingdom Forestry Commission 1920).&lt;ref name="united"&gt;United Kingdom Forestry Commission. 1920. Beaufort estate. p. 57–62 ''in'' Programme, British Empire For. Conf., London, U.K.&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland, at Corrour, Inverness-shire, Sir John Stirling Maxwell in 1907 began using white spruce in his pioneering plantations at high elevations on deep peat. However, plantations in Britain have generally been unsatisfactory (Edlin 1962),&lt;ref name="edlin"&gt;Edlin, H.L. 1962. A modern sylva or a discourse of forest trees. 3. The spruces. Quart J. For. 56:292–300.&lt;/ref&gt; mainly because of damage by spring frosts after mild weather had induced flushing earlier in the season. However, the species is held in high regard in the Belgian peat region, where it grows better than do the other spruces (Fraser 1933).&lt;ref name="fraser"&gt;Fraser, G.K. 1933. Studies of certain Scottish Moorlands in relation to tree growth. For. Commission, HMSO, London, U.K. 112 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Treeless bogs interspersed with spruce.jpg|thumb|upright=2|White spruce growing in the [[riparian zone]] amid treeless bogs]]
White spruce is a climax canopy tree in the boreal forests of Canada and Alaska. It generally occurs on well-drained [[soil]]s in [[alluvial zone|alluvial]] and [[riparian zone]]s, although it also occurs in soils of [[glacial]] and [[Lake|lacustrine]] origin.&lt;ref name="SilvicsNA" /&gt; The [[understory]] is dominated by [[feather moss]]es (''[[Hylocomium splendens]]'' and ''[[Pleurozium schreberi]]'', ''[[Ptilium crista-castrensis]]'', and ''[[Dicranum]] spp.''), and occasionally [[peat moss]].&lt;ref name="Trainor"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Trainor  | first = Sarah | title = Meeting Alaska’s Fire Science and Climate Information Needs for Forest Managers | journal = Forest Wisdom | volume =  | issue = 16 | pages = 4–5 | publisher = Forestry Guild | location = Santa Fe, NM | date = 2010-11-02 | url = http://www.forestguild.org/publications/forest_wisdom/Wisdom16.pdf | accessdate = 2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the far north, the total depth of the moss and underlying [[humus]] is normally between {{Convert|25|to|46|cm|in|abbr=on}}, although it tends to be shallower when [[hardwood]]s are present in the stand.&lt;ref name="SilvicsNA" /&gt;

White spruce grows in soils with [[pH]] values of 4.7–7.0, although they have been found in soils as acidic as 4.0 in [[Abies lasiocarpa|subalpine fir]] forests in the Northwest Territories. A presence of [[calcium]] in the soil is common to white spruce found in northern New York. White spruce most commonly grows in the soil orders of [[Alfisols]] and [[Inceptisols]]. [[Soil]] properties such as fertility, temperature, and structural stability are partial determinants of the ability of white spruce to grow in the extreme northern latitudes.&lt;ref name="SilvicsNA" /&gt; In the northern limits of its range, white spruce is the [[climax species]] along with [[Picea mariana|black spruce]]; [[birch]] and [[aspen]] are the [[primary succession|early succession]] species.&lt;ref name="Trainor" /&gt;
[[Wildfire]]s typically occur every 60 to 200 years, although they have been known to occur as infrequently as every 300 years.&lt;ref name="Trainor" /&gt;

White spruce will grow in USDA Growing Zones 3-7, but is not adapted to heat and humidity and will perform poorly in a hot climate.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} The tree attains its greatest longevity and growth potential in Zones 3-4.

[[File:Riviere Sautauriski PJC.jpg|thumb|left|White spruce growing in the [[riparian zone]] of the [[Sautauriski River]], [[Québec]]]]
White spruce occurs on a wide variety of [[soil]]s, including soils of glacial, lacustrine, marine, and alluvial origins; overlying basic dolomites, limestones and acidic Precambrian and Devonian granites and gneisses; and Silurian sedimentary schists, shales, slates, and conglomerates (Halliday 1937).&lt;ref name="hall"&gt;Halliday, W.E.D.

Podzolized, brunisolic, luvisolic, gleysolic, and regosolic (immature) soils are typical of those supporting white spruce throughout the range of the species (Nienstaedt 1957).&lt;ref name="nien1" /&gt; Soils supporting white spruce are most commonly Alfisols or Inceptisols (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990).&lt;ref name="SilvicsNA" /&gt; In the podzol region of Wisconsin, white spruce occurs on [[loam]] podzols, podzolized gley loams, strongly podzolized clays, gley-podzol clays, stream-bottom soils, and wood peat (Wilde et al. 1949).&lt;ref name="wilde1" /&gt; Moist sandy loams also support good growth (Harlow and Harrar 1950).&lt;ref name="harlow"/&gt; On sandy podzols (Wilde et al. 1949),&lt;ref name="wilde1" /&gt; it is usually a minor species (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990).&lt;ref name="SilvicsNA" /&gt; Good development occurs on moist alluvium (Seeley, cited by Nienstaedt 1957; Jeffrey 1961, 1964; Lacate et al. 1965; Viereck 1973)&lt;ref name="nien1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jeff1"&gt;Jeffrey, W.W.

White spruce becomes less accommodating of soil with increasing severity of [[climate]]. The distribution of white spruce in Labrador seems to depend almost entirely on the character of the soil (Sargent 1898),&lt;ref name="sargent" /&gt; and between the southwestern shores of Hudson Bay and the northeastern regions of Saskatchewan, white spruce is confined to very local physiographic features, characterized by well-drained or fertile soils (Ritchie 1956).&lt;ref name="ritch"&gt;Ritchie, J.C. 1956. The vegetation of northern Manitoba. I. Studies in the southern spruce forest zone. Can. J. Bot. 34(4):523–561.&lt;/ref&gt;

On dry, deep, outwash deposits in northern Ontario, both white spruce and [[aspen]] grow slowly (MacLean 1960).&lt;ref name="macl"&gt;MacLean, D.W. (1960).

Forest floors under stands dominated by white spruce respond in ways that vary with site conditions, including the disturbance history of the site (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990).&lt;ref name="SilvicsNA" /&gt; Composition, [[biomass]], and mineral soil physical and chemical properties are affected. In Alaska, the accumulation of organic layers (to greater thicknesses in mature stands of spruce than those in hardwood stands on similar sites) leads to decreased soil temperatures, in some cases leading to the development of permafrost (Viereck 1970a, b, Viereck et al. 1983).&lt;ref name="viera"&gt;Viereck, L.A.

Res.'' 13(5):703–720.&lt;/ref&gt; Acidity of the mineral soil sampled at an average depth of 17&amp;nbsp;cm in 13 white spruce stands on abandoned farmland in Ontario increased by 1.2 pH units over a period of 46 years (Brand et al. 1986).&lt;ref name="brand"&gt;Brand, D.G.; Kehoe, P.; Connors, M. (1986). "[[Pinophyta|Coniferous]] afforestation leads to soil acidification in central Ontario." ''Can. J. For. Res.'' 16(6):1389–1391.&lt;/ref&gt;

A considerable range of soil pH is tolerated by white spruce (Nienstaedt 1957).&lt;ref name="nien1" /&gt; Thrifty stands of white spruce in Manitoba have developed on soils of pH 7.6 at only 10&amp;nbsp;cm below the surface, and pH 8.4 at 43&amp;nbsp;cm below the surface (Stoeckeler 1938, USDA Forest Service 1938);&lt;ref name="stoe"&gt;Stoeckeler, J.H.

Sta., St. Paul MN, Tech. Note 134. 1 p.&lt;/ref&gt; rooting depth in those soils was at least 81&amp;nbsp;cm. An abundant calcium supply is common to most white spruce locations in New York state (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990).&lt;ref name="SilvicsNA" /&gt; [[Chlorosis]] was observed in young white spruce in heavily limed nursery soils at about pH 8.3 (Stone, cited by Nienstaedt 1957).&lt;ref name="nien1" /&gt; Wilde (1966)&lt;ref name="wilde3" /&gt; gave 4.7 to 6.5 as the approximate optimum range of pH for white spruce in Wisconsin, but optimum growth seems possible at pH levels up to 7.0 and perhaps higher (Sutton 1968).&lt;ref name="sutton" /&gt; Alluvium on the floodplains of northern rivers shows pH levels from 5.0 to 8.2 (Zasada et al. 1977).&lt;ref name="zasada"&gt;Zasada, J.C.; Van Cleve, K.; Werner, R.A.; McQueen, J.A.; Nyland, E.

Mature stands of white spruce in boreal regions often have well-developed [[moss]] layers dominated by feather mosses, e.g., ''Hylocomium splendens'' (Hedw.) B.S.G., ''Pleurozium schreberi'' (Brid.) Mitt., ''Ptlium crista-castrensis'' (Hedw.) De Not., and ''Dicranum'' Hedw. spp. rather than ''Sphagnum'' Dill. spp. (La Roi and Stringer 1976, Viereck 1987).&lt;ref name="laroi"&gt;La Roi, G.H.; Stringer, M.H. (1976).

[Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990]&lt;/ref&gt; The thickness of the moss–organic layer commonly exceeds 25&amp;nbsp;cm in the far north and may approach twice that figure. The mosses compete for nutrients and have a major influence on soil temperatures in the rooting zone. Permafrost development in parts of Alaska, Yukon, and the Northwest Territories is facilitated by the insulative organic layer (Viereck 1970a, b, Gill 1975, Van Cleve and Yarie 1986).&lt;ref name="viera" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vierb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gill"&gt;Gill, D.

=== Cold hardiness ===
[[File:White Spruce, Brampton, Ontario (5322599282).jpg|thumb|left|Young tree with light snowcover]]
White spruce is extremely hardy to low temperatures, provided the plant is in a state of winter [[dormancy]]. Throughout the greater part of its range, white spruce routinely survives and is undamaged by winter temperatures of {{convert|−50|C|F}}, and even lower temperatures occur in parts of the range (Fowells 1965, Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990).&lt;ref name="SilvicsNA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fowells"/&gt; [[Taiga|Boreal]] ''Picea'' are among the few extremely hardy [[Pinophyta|conifers]] in which the bud primordia are able to survive temperatures down to {{convert|-70|C|F|disp=comma}} (Sakai and Larcher 1987).&lt;ref name="sakai4"&gt;Sakai, A.; Larcher, W. (Eds.) (1987). ''Frost Survival of Plants.'' Springer-Verlag, New York NY. 321 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially important in determining the response of white spruce to low temperatures is the physiological state of the various tissues, notably the degree of "hardening" or dormancy. A natural progression of hardening and dehardening occurs in concert with the seasons (Glerum 1985).&lt;ref name="glerum1"&gt;Glerum, C. (1985). "Frost hardiness of coniferous [[seedling]]s: principles and applications." p. 107–123 ''in ''Duryea, M.L. (Ed.). Proceedings: Evaluating seedling quality: principles, procedures, and predictive abilities of major tests. Workshop, October 1984, Oregon State Univ., For. Res. Lab., Corvallis OR.&lt;/ref&gt; While different tissues vary in ability to tolerate exposure to stressful temperatures, white spruce, as with woody plants in general, has necessarily developed sufficient winter hardiness in its various tissues to enable them to survive the minimum temperatures experienced in the distribution range.

White spruce is subject to severe damage from spring frosts. Newly flushed shoots of white spruce are very sensitive to spring frost (Smith 1949, Rowe 1955, McLeod 1964).&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;Smith, B.J. (1949). "Silvicultural work at the Sault Ste.

== Forest succession ==
[[File:Fireweed Yukon.jpg|thumb|Disturbed roadside blooms with early-succession [[fireweed]]; behind, late-succession Alaskan white spruce forest, [[Yukon]]]]
Forest succession in its traditional sense implies two important features that resist direct examination (Solomon et al. 1981).&lt;ref name="solo"&gt;Solomon, A.M.; West, D.C., and Solomon, J.A. 1981. Simulating the role of climate change and species imiigration in forest succession. p. 154–178 ''in'' West, D.C.; Shugart, H.H.; Botkin, D.B. (Eds.). Forest Succession: Concepts and Application. Springer-Verlag, New York NY.&lt;/ref&gt; First, classical definitions generally connote directional changes in species composition and community structure through time, yet the time frame needed for documentation of change far exceeds an average lifespan (Solomon et al. 1981).&lt;ref name="solo" /&gt; The second feature that defies quantitative description is the end point or climax.

Floodplain deposits in the Northwest Territory, Canada, are important in relation to the development of productive forest types with a component of [[white spruce]] (Jeffrey 1964).&lt;ref name="jeff2"/&gt; The most recently exposed surfaces are occupied by sandbar vegetation or riparian shrub willows and alder (''Alnus incana''); with increasing elevation, the shrubs give way successively to [[Populus balsamifera|balsam poplar]] and white spruce forest. In contrast, older floodplains, with predominantly brown wooded soils, typically carry white spruce–[[Populus tremuloides|trembling aspen]] mixedwood forest.

Interrelationships among nutrient cycling, regeneration, and subsequent forest development on floodplains in interior Alaska were addressed by Van Cleve et al. (1980),&lt;ref name="van1"&gt;Van Cleve, K.; Dyrness, R.; Viereck, L. 1980. Nutrient cycling in interior Alaska flood plains. p. 11–18 ''in'' Murray, M.; Van Veldhuizen, R.M. (Eds.). Proc. Workshop, Fairbanks, Alaska, Nov. 1979. USDA, For. Serv., Pacific Northwest For. Exp. Sta., Portland OR, Gen. Tech. Rep., PNW-107. 52 p.&lt;/ref&gt; who pointed out that the various stages in primary succession reflect physical, chemical, and biological controls of ecosystem structure and function. Thus, each successional stage has a species combination in harmony with site quality. Short-circuiting succession by planting a late successional species such as white spruce on an early successional surface may result in markedly reduced growth rates because of [[Nitrogen deficiency|nitrogen insufficiency]]. Without application of substantial amounts of fertilizer, use would have to be made of early successional alder and its site-ameliorating additions of nitrogen.

[[File:Old_Growth_White_Spruce_in_Whitehorse.jpg|thumb|left|Old-growth Alaskan white spruce, [[Yukon]]]]
Neiland and Viereck noted that “the slow establishment and growth of spruce under birch stands [in Alaska] may be partially due to effects of shading and general competition for water and nutrients, but may also be more directly related to the [[birch]] itself. Heikinheimo (1915 cited by Lutz 1956),&lt;ref name="heik"&gt;Heikinheimo, O. 1915. Der einfluss der brandwirtschaft auf die Wälder Finnlands. Kaskiviljelyksen Vaikutus Suomen Metsin. Acta Forest.

Serv., Washington DC, Tech. Bull. 1133. 121 p.&lt;/ref&gt; found that birch ash inhibited white spruce seedlings, and Gregory (1966)&lt;ref name="greg"&gt;Gregory, R.A. 1966. The effect of leaf litter upon establishment of white spruce beneath paper birch. For. Chron. 42:251–255.&lt;/ref&gt; found that birch litter has a smothering effect on spruce seedlings” (Neiland and Viereck 1977).&lt;ref name="neil"&gt;Neiland, B.J.; Viereck, L.A. 1977. Forest types and ecosystems. p. 109–136 ''in'' North American Forest Lands at Latitudes North of 60 Degrees, Proc. sympos., Univ. Alaska, Fairbanks AK, Sept. 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

On dry upland sites, especially south-facing slopes, the mature vegetation is white spruce, white birch, trembling aspen, or a combination of these species. Succession follows in one of two general patterns. In most cases, aspen and birch develop as a successional stage after [[Wildfire|fire]] before reaching the spruce stage. But, occasionally, with optimal site conditions and a source of seed, white spruce will invade with the [[hardwood]]s or within a few years thereafter, thereby producing even-aged white spruce stands without an intervening hardwood stage.

== Associated forest cover ==
[[File:Gaspé taiga.jpg|thumb|upright=3|[[Taiga]] in the [[Gaspésie]], [[Québec]], including other species]]
The White Spruce Cover Type may include other species in small numbers. In Alaska, associates include paper birch, trembling aspen, balsam poplar, and black spruce; in western Canada, additional associates are subalpine fir, balsam fir, Douglas-fir, jack pine, and lodgepole pine (Dyrness 1980).&lt;ref name="vier1"&gt;Dyrness, C.T. 1980. Western forest cover types, Northern Interior (Boreal): White spruce. p.81; White spruce–Aspen. p.82; Black spruce–White spruce. p.84; and Black spruce–Paper birch. p.85. ''in'' Eyre, F.H. (Ed.). Forest Cover Types of the United States and Canada. Soc. Amer. Foresters, Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt; Seral species giving way to white spruce include [[Betula papyrifera|paper birch]], [[aspen]], [[Populus balsamifera|balsam poplar]], [[jack pine]], and [[Pinus contorta|lodgepole pine]]. On certain river bottom sites, however, black spruce may replace white spruce (Viereck 1970a).&lt;ref name="vier1"/&gt; Earlier successional stages leading to the white spruce climax are the white spruce–paper birch, white spruce–aspen, balsam poplar, jack pine, and lodgepole pine types. The type shows little variation. The forest is generally closed and the trees well formed, other than those close to the timberline. Lesser vegetation in mature stands is dominated by [[moss]]es. [[Vascular plant]]s are typically few, but [[shrub]]s and [[herb]]s that occur “with a degree of regularity” include: alder, willows, mountain cranberry, red-fruit bearberry, black crowberry, prickly rose, currant, buffaloberry, blueberry species, bunchberry, twinflower, tall lungwort, northern comandra, horsetail, bluejoint grass, sedge species, as well as ground-dwelling [[moss]]es and [[lichen]]s. Several white spruce communities have been identified in interior Alaska: white spruce/feathermoss; white spruce/dwarf birch/feathermoss; white spruce/dwarf birch/sphagnum; white spruce/avens/moss; and white spruce/alder/bluejoint (Viereck 1975, Dyrness 1980).&lt;ref&gt;Viereck, L.A. 1975.

Of the Eastern Forest Cover Types recognized by the Society of American Foresters (Eyre 1980),&lt;ref name="eyre" /&gt; only one, White Spruce, names that species in its title. The eastern White Spruce Cover Type, as defined, encompasses white spruce both in pure stands, and in mixed stands “in which white spruce is the major [undefined] component” (Payette 1980).&lt;ref name="payette1"&gt;Payette, S. 1980. Eastern forest cover types, Boreal Forest Region: white spruce. p.15 ''in'' Eyre, F.H. (Ed.). Forest Cover Types of the United States and Canada. Soc. Amer. Foresters, Washington DC. 148 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

In most of its range, white spruce occurs more typically in association with trees of other species than in pure stands.

White spruce is an associated species in the following Eastern Forest cover types, by the Society of American Foresters: In the [[Taiga|Boreal Forest]] Region: (1) jack pine, (5) balsam fir, (12) black spruce, (16) aspen, (18) paper birch, and (38) tamarack.

A number of sawflies feed on spruce trees. Among them European spruce sawfly, yellow-headed spruce sawfly, green-headed spruce sawfly and the spruce webspinning sawfly (Rose and Lindquist 1985).&lt;ref name="rose" /&gt;

More than a dozen kinds of looper feed on the spruces, fir, and hemlock in eastern Canada. The full-grown larvae of the larvae vary in length from 15&amp;nbsp;mm to 35&amp;nbsp;mm. Some feed briefly in the fall and complete their feeding in the spring; others feed mainly in the summer; still others feed mainly in the late summer and fall.

The fall and spring feeding group includes the [[Protoboarmia porcelaria|dash-lined looper]] (''Protoboarmia porcelaria indicataria'' Walker), the diamond-backed looper (''Hypagyrtis piniata'' Packard), the fringed looper (''Campaea perlata'' Guenée), and the [[Syngrapha abstrusa|false loopers]] (''Syngrapha'' species). The summer feeding group includes the [[Nepytia canosaria|false hemlock looper]] (''Nepytia canosaria'' Walker), occasionally occurring in large numbers and usually in conjunction with the [[Lambdina fiscellaria|hemlock looper]] (''Lambdina fiscellaria fiscellaria'' Guenée), the [[Eupithecia|small spruce loopers]] ''Eupithecia'' species, the yellowlined conifer looper (''Cladara limitaria'' Walker), and the [[Engrailed (moth)|saddleback looper]] (''Ectropis crepuscularia'' Denis and Schiffermüller).

The late summer and fall group includes the common [[Macaria signaria|spruce-fir looper]] (''Semiothisa signaria dispuncta'' Walker) and the similar ''Semiothisa fissinotata'' Walker on hemlock, the small spruce loopers ''[[Eupithecia]]'' species, the spruce looper ''Caripeta divisata'' Walker, occasionally abundant, the transversebanded looper (''Hydriomena divisaria'' Walker), and the whitelined looper (''Eufidonia notataria'' Walker).

White spruce is of major economic importance in Canada for its [[wood]], harvested for [[paper]]-making and construction. It is also used to a small extent as a [[Christmas tree]].

The wood is also exported to [[Japan]] where, known as "shin-kaya", it is used to make [[go board]]s as a substitute for the rare [[Torreya nucifera|kaya]] wood.

Black Hills Spruce (''Picea glauca'' var. ''densata'') is used for [[bonsai]] (see image).

Several geographical [[variety (biology)|varieties]] have been described, but are not accepted as distinct by all authors. These comprise, from east to west:&lt;ref name=farjonrushforthc/&gt;
*''Picea glauca'' var. ''glauca'' (typical or eastern white spruce). From Newfoundland west to eastern Alberta, on lowland plains.
*''Picea glauca'' var. ''densata'' (Black Hills white spruce). The Black Hills in South Dakota.
*''Picea glauca'' var. ''albertiana'' (Alberta white spruce). The [[Rocky Mountains]] in Alberta, British Columbia and northwest Montana.
*''Picea glauca'' var. ''porsildii'' (Alaska white spruce). Alaska and Yukon.

The two western varieties are distinguished by pubescent (downy) shoots, and may be related to extensive [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridisation]] and/or [[intergradation]] with the closely related [[Engelmann spruce]] found further south in the Rocky Mountains. White spruce also hybridises readily with the closely related [[Sitka spruce]] where they meet in southern Alaska; this hybrid is known as ''[[Picea × lutzii]]''.&lt;ref name=farjonrushforthc/&gt;

== Cultivars ==
[[File:Dwarf Albert Spruce foliage with reversion.jpg|thumbnail|right|A dwarf Alberta white spruce, with [[Reversion (botany)|reversion]] in one branch]]
Numerous [[cultivars]] of various sizes, colours and shapes have been selected for use in parks and gardens. The following have gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/pdfs/agm-lists/agm-ornamentals.pdf | title = AGM Plants - Ornamental | date = July 2017 | page = 78 | publisher = Royal Horticultural Society

'Conica' is a dwarf conifer with very slender leaves, like those normally found only on one-year-old [[seedling]]s, and very slow growth, typically only {{Convert|2|-|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} per year. Older specimens commonly '[[Reversion (botany)|revert]]', developing normal adult foliage and starting to grow much faster; this 'reverted' growth must be [[pruning|pruned]] if the plant is to be kept [[dwarfing|dwarf]].

[[World War I]] was the first war in which [[mass media]] and [[propaganda]] played a significant role in keeping the people at home informed about what was occurring on the battlefields.&lt;ref name="Propaganda for patriotism and nationalism"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Welch|first1=David|title=Propaganda for patriotism and nationalism|url=http://www.bl.uk/world-war-one/articles/patriotism-and-nationalism|website=British Library|accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also the first war in which the government systematically produced propaganda as a way to target the public and alter their opinion.
[[File:World War I propaganda stamp.jpg|thumb|World War I propaganda stamp]]

External propaganda to other countries was an integral part of the [[diplomatic history of World War I]] and was designed to build support for the cause, or to undermine support for the enemy.

==The United States==

The [[United States]] entered World War I in 1917 as an associated power on the allied side of [[Great Britain|Britain]] and [[France]].&lt;ref name="US propaganda"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Messinger|first1=Gary|title=British Propaganda and the State in the First World War|date=January 1, 1992|publisher=Manchester University Press|pages=20–30|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time that World War I came around, the United States was a leader in the art of [[Filmmaking|movie making]] and the new profession of [[commercial advertising]].&lt;ref name="US propaganda" /&gt; Such newly discovered technologies played an instrumental role in the shaping of the American mind and the altering of [[public opinion]] into a pro-war position. Perhaps the most influential man behind propaganda in the United States during World War I was President [[Woodrow Wilson]]. In one of Wilson's most famous declarations, he outlined the "[[Fourteen Points]]" which he said the United States would fight to defend.&lt;ref name="14 points" /&gt; Aside from the restoration of freedom in [[Europe|European]] countries suppressed by the power of [[German Empire|Germany]], Wilson's Fourteen Points called for lack of transparency regarding discussion of [[Diplomacy|diplomatic matters]], free navigation of the seas both in peace and war time, and equal trade conditions among all nations.&lt;ref name="14 points"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Woodrow|title=President Wilson's Message to Congress|publisher=Records of the United States Senate|date=January 8, 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fourteen Points would serve as a blueprint for world peace to be used for peace negotiations after [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="US propaganda" /&gt; Wilson's points inspired audiences around the world and greatly strengthened the belief that Britain, France and America were fighting for noble goals.&lt;ref name="US propaganda" /&gt;

=== Committee on Public Information===
In 1917 Wilson created the [[Committee on Public Information]] which was made up by the [[Secretaries of State]], the [[United States Army|Army]], and the [[United States Navy|Navy]].&lt;ref name="US propaganda" /&gt; The committee would report directly to President Wilson and was essentially a massive generator of propaganda.&lt;ref name="US propaganda" /&gt; The Committee on Public Information was responsible for producing films, commissioning posters, publishing numerous books and pamphlets, purchasing advertisements in major newspapers, and recruiting businessmen, preachers and professors to serve as public speakers in charge of altering public opinion at the communal level.&lt;ref name="US propaganda" /&gt; The committee, headed by former investigative journalist [[George Creel]], emphasized the message that America's involvement in the war was entirely necessary in achieving the salvation of Europe from the German and enemy forces.&lt;ref name="US propaganda" /&gt; In his book titled ''How we Advertised America'', Creel states that the committee was called into existence to make World War I a fight that would be a "verdict for mankind."&lt;ref name=Creel&gt;{{cite book|last1=Creel|first1=George|title=How We Advertised America: The First Telling of the Amazing Story of the Committee on Public Information that Carried the Gospel of Americanism to Every Corner of the Globe|date=1920|publisher=Harper and Brothers|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called the committee a voice that was created to plead the justice of America's cause before the jury of public opinion.&lt;ref name=Creel /&gt; Creel also refers to the committee as a "vast enterprise in salesmenship" and "the world's greatest adventure in advertising."&lt;ref name=Creel /&gt; The committee's message resonated deep within every American community and also served as an organization responsible for carrying the full message of American ideals to every corner of the civilized globe.&lt;ref name=Creel /&gt; Creel and his committee utilized every possible mode to get their message across, including; printed word, spoken word, the motion picture, the telegraph, the poster and the sign board.&lt;ref name=Creel /&gt; All forms of communication were put to use in order to justify the causes that compelled America to take arms.

Creel set out to systematically reach every person in the United States multiple times with patriotic information about how the individual could contribute to the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Vaughn, ''Holding Fast the Inner Lines: Democracy, Nationalism, and the Committee on Public Information'' (1980). [https://www.questia.com/library/1664084/holding-fast-the-inner-lines-democracy-nationalism online]&lt;/ref&gt; The CPI also worked with the post office to censor seditious counter-propaganda. Creel set up divisions in his new agency to produce and distribute innumerable copies of pamphlets, newspaper releases, magazine advertisements, films, school campaigns, and the speeches of the [[Four Minute Men]]. The CPI created colorful posters that appeared in every store window, catching the attention of the passersby for a few seconds.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine H. Adams, ''Progressive Politics and the Training of America’s Persuaders'' (1999) &lt;/ref&gt; Movie theaters were widely attended, and the CPI trained thousands of volunteer speakers to make patriotic appeals during the four-minute breaks needed to change reels.  They also spoke at churches, lodges, fraternal organizations, labor unions, and even logging camps. Creel boasted that in 18 months his 75,000 volunteers delivered over 7.5 million four minute orations to over 300 million listeners, in a nation of 103 million people.  The speakers attended training sessions through local universities, and were given pamphlets and speaking tips on a wide variety of topics, such as buying [[Liberty bond|Liberty Bonds]], registering for the [[Military Draft|draft]], rationing food, recruiting unskilled workers for munitions jobs, and supporting [[Red Cross]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Mastrangelo,  "World War I, public intellectuals, and the Four Minute Men: Convergent ideals of public speaking and civic participation." ''Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs'' 12#4 (2009): 607-633.&lt;/ref&gt;  Historians were assigned to write pamphlets and in-depth histories of the causes of the European war. &lt;ref&gt;George T. Blakey, ''Historians on the Homefront: American Propagandists for the Great War'' (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Committee on public information, ''Complete Report of the Committee on Public Information: 1917, 1918, 1919'' (1920) [https://archive.org/details/CompleteReportCommitteeOnPublicInformation191719181919 online free]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Atrocity propaganda==
[[File:Atrocity Propaganda used against the Germans in WWI.jpg|thumb|Anti-German atrocity propaganda]]
[[Atrocity propaganda]] was a form of [[advertising]] used during World War I which focused on and embellished the most violent acts committed by the German and [[Austro-Hungarian]] armies.&lt;ref name="Atrocity Propaganda"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fox|first1=Jo|title=Atrocity Propaganda|url=http://www.bl.uk/world-war-one/articles/atrocity-propaganda|website=British Library|accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Germans and Austro-Hungarian soldiers were depicted as inhumane savages with their barbarity being emphasized as a way to provide justification for the war. In 1914, prominent forensic scientist, [[Archibald Reiss|R.A. Reiss]] was commissioned by the Serbian Prime Minister to conduct an investigation regarding war crimes.&lt;ref name="Atrocity Propaganda" /&gt; This was done as a way to depict the multiple acts of violence committed against civilians by the occupying Austro-Hungarian forces in [[Serbia]] in 1914. These reports were written in vivid detail and described individual acts of violence against civilians, soldiers and prisoners of war.&lt;ref name="Atrocity Propaganda" /&gt; Some of these actions included the use of forbidden weapons, the demolition of ancient libraries and cathedrals, as well as the rape and torture of civilians.&lt;ref name="Atrocity Propaganda" /&gt; Graphic illustrations, accompanied by first hand testimonies that described these crimes as savagely unjust served as a compelling reminder for the justification of war.&lt;ref name="Atrocity Propaganda" /&gt; Other forms of atrocity propaganda depicted an alternative to war which involved German occupation and domination.&lt;ref name=pierre /&gt; This was regarded as unacceptable across the political spectrum. As the [[Socialist]] Pioneer of Northampton put it in 1916, there could “be no peace while the frightful menace of world domination by force of German armed might looms about and above us”.&lt;ref name=pierre /&gt;

[[Propaganda]] was used in [[World War One]] as in any war - and the truth suffered. Propaganda ensured that the people only got to know what their [[governments]] wanted them to know. In World War One, the lengths to which governments would go to in an effort to blacken the enemy’s name reached a new level. To ensure that everybody [[thought]] in the way the government wanted, all forms of information were controlled. Newspapers were expected to print what the government wanted the reader to read. In fact, though this would appear to be a form of [[censorship]], the newspapers of Britain, effectively controlled by the [[Broadcast media|media]] barons of the time, were happy to play ball. They printed headlines that were designed to stir up emotions regardless of whether they were accurate or not. The most infamous headlines included “Belgium child’s hands cut off by Germans” and “Germans crucify Canadian officer”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trueman|first1=Chris|title=Propaganda and World War]] One|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/propaganda_and_world_war_one.htm|website=History Learning Site}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Propaganda playing on patriotism and nationalism==
[[File:Uncle sam propaganda in ww1.jpg|thumb|[[Uncle Sam]]'s call to arms]]

According to scholar [[David Welch (historian)|David Welch]], [[patriotism]] and [[nationalism]] were two of the most important themes played on by the [[propaganda]] of the time.&lt;ref name="Propaganda for patriotism and nationalism" /&gt; In 1914, the British army was made up of professionals as well as volunteers, causing the government to rely heavily on propaganda as a tool to justify war to the public eye.&lt;ref name="Propaganda for patriotism and nationalism" /&gt; This propaganda was used to promote recruitment into the armed forces as well as to convince civilians that if they joined, their sacrifices would be rewarded.&lt;ref name="Propaganda for patriotism and nationalism" /&gt; One of the most impressionable images of this First World War is the “Your Country Needs You” poster, a distinctive recruitment poster of [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] (similar to the later [[Uncle Sam]] poster) pointing at his British audience, convincing them to join the war effort.&lt;ref name="Propaganda for patriotism and nationalism" /&gt; Another message deeply embedded in national sentiment was one where the religious symbolism of [[St George]] was shown slaying a [[dragon]] which represented the German forces.&lt;ref name="Propaganda for patriotism and nationalism" /&gt; Images of enthusiastic patriotism seemed to encapsulate the tragedy of European and imperial populations.&lt;ref name=pierre /&gt; Such images were able to conjure up feelings of required patriotism and activism among those influenced.&lt;ref name=pierre&gt;{{cite web|last1=Purseigle|first1=Pierre|title=Inside the First World War|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-one/inside-first-world-war/part-three/10417056/world-war-one-propaganda.html|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Propaganda as a weapon==
The non-military diplomatic and propaganda interactions during the war were designed to build support for the cause, or to undermine support for the enemy.&lt;ref&gt; David Stevenson, ''The First World War and International Politics'' (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Z.A.B. Zeman, ''Diplomatic History of the First World War'' (1971)&lt;/ref&gt; Wartime diplomacy focused on five issues: propaganda campaigns to shape news reports and commentary; defining and redefining the war goals, which became harsher as the war went on; luring neutral nations ([[Italy]], [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]]) into the coalition by offering slices of enemy territory; and encouragement by the Allies of nationalistic minority movements inside the Central Powers, especially among [[Czech Republic|Czechs]], [[Poland|Poles]], and Arabs.  In addition, there were multiple peace proposals coming from neutrals, or from one side or the other;  none of them progressed very far. Some were neutral efforts to end the horrors. Others were propaganda ploys to show one side was being reasonable and the other was obstinate. &lt;ref&gt;See Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ''Official Statements of War Aims and Peace Proposals: December 1916 to November 1918'', edited by James Brown Scott. (1921) 515pp [https://archive.org/details/cu31924016943106 online free] &lt;/ref&gt;

As soon as the war began Britain cut Germany’s under-sea communication cables as a way to ensure that the Allies had a monopoly on the most expedient means of transmitting news from Europe to press outlets in the United States.&lt;ref name="Propaganda as a Weapon"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cooke|first1=Ian|title=Propaganda as a weapon? Influencing international opinion|url=http://www.bl.uk/world-war-one/articles/propaganda-as-a-weapon|website=British Library|accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was done as a way to influence reporting of the war around the world and to gain sympathy and support from the other nations.&lt;ref name="Propaganda as a Weapon" /&gt; In 1914, a secret British organization by the name of [[Wellington House]] was set up, calling for journalists and newspaper editors to write articles which sympathized with Britain as a way to counter the statements being made by the enemy.&lt;ref name="Propaganda as a Weapon" /&gt; Wellington House implemented this action not only through favorable reports in the press of neutral countries, but also by publishing its own newspapers for circulation around the globe.&lt;ref name="Propaganda as a Weapon" /&gt; Wellington House was so secret, in fact, that Parliament was often not aware of them. Wellington House had a staff of 54 people, which made it the largest British foreign propaganda organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Epstein|first1=Jonathan|title=German and English Propaganda in World War I|url=http://bobrowen.com/nymas/propagandapaper.html|website=bobrowen.com|publisher=NYMAS|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the Wellington House came the publication The War Pictorial, which by December 1916 reached a circulation of 500,000, covering 11 languages. The War Pictorial was deemed to have such a powerful effect on different masses that it could turn countries, like China, against Germany.&lt;ref name="Propaganda as a Weapon" /&gt;

'''Scientific drilling''' into the Earth is a way for scientists to probe the Earth's [[sediment]]s, [[Crust (geology)|crust]], and [[upper mantle]]. In addition to rock samples, drilling technology can unearth samples of [[connate fluids]] and of the subsurface [[biosphere]], mostly [[microbial life]], preserved in drilled samples.  Most of the technology used for drilling come from advances in the [[oil and gas industry]].  Scientific drilling is carried out on land by the [[International Continental Scientific Drilling Program]] (ICDP) and at sea by the [[Integrated Ocean Drilling Program]] (IODP).  Scientific drilling on the continents includes drilling down into solid ground as well as drilling from small boats on lakes. Sampling thick [[glacier]]s and [[ice sheet]]s to obtain [[ice core]]s is related but will not be described further here.

Like probes sent into [[outer space]], scientific drilling is a technology used to obtain samples from places that people cannot reach.  Human beings have descended as deep as 2,080 m (6,822 ft) in [[Voronya Cave]], the world's deepest known cave, located in the [[Caucasus mountains]] of the country of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Gold miners in [[South Africa]] regularly go deeper than 3,400 m, but no human has ever descended to greater depths than this below the Earth's solid surface. As depth increases into the Earth, temperature and pressure rise. Temperatures in the crust increase about 15°C per kilometer, making it impossible for humans to exist at depths greater than several kilometers, even if it was somehow possible to keep shafts open in spite of the tremendous pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wn.com/connate_fluids|title=Connate Fluids|website=World News|language=en|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Scientific drilling is interdisciplinary and international in scope. Individual scientists cannot generally undertake scientific drilling projects alone. Teamwork between scientists, engineers, and administrators is often required for success in planning and in carrying out a drilling project, analyzing the samples, and interpreting and publishing the results in scientific journals.

==Purposes==
Scientific drilling is used to address a wide range of problems, which cannot be addressed using rocks exposed on the surface or on the seafloor.  The [[Integrated Ocean Drilling Program]] has a broad set of research objectives, which can be divided into three principal themes: 
#The nature of the deep [[biosphere]] and the oceanic sub-seafloor  
#Understanding environmental change, processes and effects 
#Cycles and geodynamics of the solid Earth

ICDP focuses on scientific drilling to address the following questions about the history, chemistry, and physics of Earth and the biosphere:
#What are the physical and chemical processes responsible for [[earthquakes]] and [[volcanic]] eruptions, and what are the best ways minimize their effects?
#How has Earth's [[climate change]]d in the recent past and what are the reasons for such changes?
#What have been the effects of meteorite impacts ([[bolide]]s) on climate and [[mass extinction]]s of life?
#What is the nature of the deep biosphere and its relation to geologic processes such as [[hydrocarbon]] maturation, [[ore]] deposition and [[evolution]] of [[life|life on Earth]]?
#What are ways to safely dispose of [[radioactive waste|radioactive]] and other [[toxic waste]] materials?
#How do [[sedimentary basin]]s and [[fossil fuel]] resources originate and evolve? 
#How do [[Ore|mineral and metal ore]] deposits form?
#What are the fundamental physics of [[plate tectonics]] and heat, mass and fluid transfer through Earth's crust?
#How can people better interpret [[geophysics|geophysical]] data used to determine the structure and properties of Earth's crust?

==Deepest drillings==
The [[Kola Superdeep Borehole]] on the Kola peninsula of Russia reached {{convert|12262|m}} and is the deepest penetration of the Earth's solid surface.  The [[German Continental Deep Drilling Program]] at {{convert|9.1|km}} has shown the earth crust to be mostly porous. Drillings as deep as {{convert|2.1|km}} into the seafloor were achieved at [[Deep_Sea_Drilling_Program|DSDP]]/[[Ocean_Drilling_Program|ODP]]/[[Integrated_Ocean_Drilling_Program|IODP]] Hole 504B.{{cn|date=May 2015}} Because the [[continental crust]] is about 45 km thick on average, whereas [[oceanic crust]] is 6-7 km thick, deep drillings have penetrated only the upper 25-30% of both crusts.

==Ocean drilling==
[[File:Riserless and mudlift drilling.png|thumb|Riserless and mudlift drilling]]
The [[drillship]] that has been used for the past 20 and more years, the [[JOIDES Resolution]], drills without a riser.  Riser-less drilling uses seawater as its primary drilling fluid, which is pumped down through the drill pipe. This cleans and cools the drill bit and lifts cuttings out of the hole, piling them in a cone around the hole.  Japan's new drillship, the [[Chikyu]], uses a riser for drilling.  The riser system includes an outer casing that surrounds the drill pipe, to provide return-circulation of drilling fluid for maintaining pressure balance within the borehole. A [[blowout preventer]] (BOP) protects the vessel and the environment from any unexpected release of gas and oil. This technology is necessary for drilling several thousand meters into the Earth and for drilling into thick sediments where oil and gas might reside.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

'''Shower trains''' or '''bathing trains''' were specialized [[train]]s or [[train car]]s used throughout [[Europe]] to provide bathing facilities to troops stationed along the [[battlefront]] during the [[First World War]].

== Switzerland==
[[File:Armeebadezug - CH-BAR - 3240833.tif|thumbnail|left|The Swiss army shower train at a station.]]
[[File:Die Wasserleitung im Duschenraum des Armeebadezuges - CH-BAR - 3240838.tif|thumbnail|right|Shower room in a Swiss train.]]
Shower trains (known as '''''Armeebadezug''''') were used in [[Switzerland]]. Each train consisted of old [[rolling stock]] from private railway companies: a [[locomotive]], a [[tank car]] and converted [[Passenger car (rail)|passenger cars]], each with a shower room and two [[cloakroom]]s. The water was taken from the tank car and heated by the locomotive.

This train served the thousands of [[Swiss Armed Forces|Swiss militia]] protecting Switzerland's borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.drehscheibe-foren.de/foren/read.php?17,6339279|title= 04 - Historische Bahn|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=2013-03-24 |website=Drehscheibe Online |publisher= |language=German |trans-title=04 - Historic Path |accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Imperial Russia ==
Similar bathing trains were used in the [[Russian Empire]] in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b69331711.r=train-bains.langEN|title= Inauguration d'un train-bain à Petrograd [novembre 1914 ?] : [photographie de presse] / [Agence Rol] |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=BNF Gallica|publisher= |language=French |trans-title=Opening ceremony of a bath train at Petragrad [November 1914?]: [Photography of the press] / [King Agency] |accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spatial Data Transfer Standard''', or '''SDTS''', is a [[standardization|standard]] used to describe earth-referenced spatial data. It was designed to easily transfer and use spatial data on different computer platforms. The FGDC has proposed to withdraw the standard. 

The USGS made an effort to promulgate the standard by making a large volume of data available at no cost and many companies supported the standard by writing translators to transform the data into different formats.

{{Greek myth (Hades)}}
[[File:Idata Stigos.jpg|thumb|The waters of one Styx in the '''[[Aroania (mountain)|Aroanian mountains]]''']]
In [[Greek mythology]], '''Styx''' ({{IPAc-en|'|s|t|ɪ|k|s}}; {{lang-grc|Στύξ}} {{IPA-el|stýkʰs|}}{{citation_needed|reason=I have not seen any Greek reconstruction besides Wiktionary argue for a pronunciation of double consonants ψ and ξ as aspirates /pʰs/ and /kʰs/. Shouldn't they pronounce as in Modern Greek, /ps, ks/? They were alternatively spelt φσ/χσ ''and'' πσ/κσ. It would seem to me, and Horrocks's ''Greek: A history of the language and its speakers'' would agree, that /s/ would block aspiration.|date=April 2013}}) is a [[deity]] and a [[river]] that forms the boundary between [[Earth]] and the [[Greek underworld|Underworld]], often called "[[Hades]]", which is also the name of its ruler. The rivers Styx, [[Phlegethon]], [[Acheron]], [[Lethe]], and [[Cocytus]] all converge at the center of the underworld on a great [[swamp|marsh]], which sometimes is also called the Styx. According to [[Herodotus]], the river Styx originates near [[Feneos]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], Histories 6. 74. 1, http://www.theoi.com/Khthonios/PotamosStyx.html&lt;/ref&gt; Styx is also a goddess with prehistoric roots in Greek mythology as a daughter of [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]], after whom the river is named and because of whom it had miraculous powers.

==Significance==
The deities of the Greek pantheon swore all their oaths upon the river Styx because, according to [[Greek mythology|classical mythology]], during the [[Titanomachy|Titan war]], Styx, the goddess of the river, sided with Zeus. After the war, Zeus declared that every oath must be sworn upon her.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], Theogony 383 ff (trans. Evelyn-White)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zeus]] swore to give [[Semele]] whatever she wanted and was then obliged to follow through when he realized to his horror that her request would lead to her death. [[Helios]] similarly promised his son [[Phaethon|Phaëton]] whatever he desired, also resulting in the boy's death. Myths related to such early deities did not survive long enough to be included in historic records, but tantalizing references exist among those that have been discovered.

According to some versions, Styx had miraculous powers and could make someone invulnerable. According to one tradition, [[Achilles]] was dipped in the waters of the river by his mother during his childhood, acquiring invulnerability, with exception of his heel, by which his mother held him. The only spot where Achilles was vulnerable was therefore that heel, where he was struck and killed by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris's arrow]] during the Trojan War. This is the source of the expression ''[[Achilles' heel]]'', a metaphor for a vulnerable spot.

Styx was primarily a feature in the [[Afterlife|afterworld]] of classical Greek mythology, similar to the [[Christian]] area of [[Hell]] in texts such as ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'' and ''[[Paradise Lost]]''. The ferryman [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] often is described as having transported the souls of the newly dead across this river into the underworld. Dante put [[Phlegyas]] as ferryman over the Styx and made it the fifth circle of Hell, where the wrathful and sullen are punished by being drowned in the muddy waters for eternity, with the wrathful fighting each other. 
In ancient times some believed that a coin ([[Charon's obol]]) placed in the mouth of a dead person&lt;ref&gt;No ancient source says that the coins were placed on the dead person's eyes; see [[Charon's obol#Coins on the eyes?]].&lt;/ref&gt;  would pay the toll for the ferry across the river to the entrance of the underworld. It was said that if someone could not pay the fee, they would never be able to cross the river. The ritual was performed by the relatives of the dead.

The variant spelling '''Stix''' was sometimes used in translations of Classical Greek before the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iliad]](1-3), [[Homer]];  H. Travers, 1740&lt;/ref&gt; By [[metonymy]], the adjective ''stygian'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|ɪ|dʒ|i|ən}}) came to refer to anything dark, dismal, and murky.

==Goddess==
Styx was the name of an [[Oceanid]] nymph, one of the three thousand daughters of [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]] and [[Oceanus]], the goddess of the River Styx. In classical myths, her husband was [[Pallas (Titan)|Pallas]] and she gave birth to [[Zelus]], [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], [[Kratos (mythology)|Kratos]], and [[Bia (mythology)|Bia]] (and sometimes [[Eos]]). In these myths, Styx supported Zeus in the [[Titanomachy]], where she was said to be the first to rush to his aid. For this reason, her name was given the honor of being a binding oath for the deities. Knowledge of whether this was the original reason for the tradition did not survive into historical records following the religious transition that led to the pantheon of the classical era.

==Science==
As of 2 July 2013, Styx officially became the name of [[Styx (moon)|one of Pluto's moons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23146454|title=Pluto moons get mythical new names|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other moons of Pluto ([[Charon (moon)|Charon]], [[Nix (moon)|Nix]], [[Hydra (moon)|Hydra]], and [[Kerberos (moon)|Kerberos]]) also have names from [[classical mythology|Greco-Roman mythology]] related to the underworld.

'''''{{Lang|la|Systema Naturae}}''''' (originally in [[Latin language|Latin]] written '''''{{Lang|la|Systema Naturæ}}''''' with the [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] [[æ]]) is one of the major works of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] botanist, zoologist and physician [[Carl Linnaeus]] (1707–1778) and introduced the [[Linnaean taxonomy]]. Although the system, now known as [[binomial nomenclature]], was partially developed by the Bauhin brothers, [[Gaspard Bauhin|Gaspard]] and [[Johann Bauhin|Johann]], 200 years earlier,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Windelspecht|Windelspecht (2002)]], p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Linnaeus was first to use it consistently throughout his book. The first edition was published in 1735. The full title of the 10th edition (1758), which was the most important one, was ''{{Lang|la|Systema naturæ per regna tria naturæ, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis}}'' or translated: "System of nature through the three kingdoms of nature, according to classes, orders, genera and species, with characters, differences, synonyms, places".

The [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|tenth edition of this book]] (1758) is considered the starting point of [[zoological nomenclature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Bellows |editor1-first=T.

Another again enhanced work in the same style and entitled "''{{Lang|la|Systema Naturae}}''" was published by [[Johann Friedrich Gmelin]] between 1788 and 1793.

== Overview ==
Linnaeus (later known as "Carl von Linné", after his ennoblement in 1761)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stearn |first=W. T. |authorlink=William T. Stearn |contribution=An introduction to the Species Plantarum and cognate botanical works of Linnaeus |title=Species Plantarum |edition=1957 Ray Society facsimile |page=14 |year=1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; published the first edition of ''{{Lang|la|Systema Naturae}}'' in the year 1735, during his stay in the [[Netherlands]]. As was customary for the [[scientific literature]] of its day, the book was published in [[Latin]]. In it, he outlined his ideas for the hierarchical classification of the natural world, dividing it into the [[Animal|animal kingdom]] (''{{Lang|la|regnum animale}}''), the [[Plantae|plant kingdom]] (''{{Lang|la|regnum vegetabile}}''), and the "[[mineral|mineral kingdom]]" (''{{Lang|la|regnum lapideum}}'').

Linnaeus's ''Systema Naturae'' lists only about 10,000 species of organisms, of which about 6,000 are plants and 4,236 are animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stearn |first=William T. |year=1959 |title=The background of Linnaeus's contributions to the nomenclature and methods of systematic biology |journal=[[Systematic Zoology]] |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=4–22 |jstor=2411603 |url=http://cordyceps.us/files/stearn_1959_.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028133630/http://cordyceps.us/files/stearn_1959_.pdf |archivedate=2014-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the historian of botany [[William T. Stearn]], "Even in 1753 he believed that the number of species of plants in the whole world would hardly reach 10,000; in his whole career he named about 7,700 species of flowering plants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stearn |first=William T. |year=1959 |title=The background of Linnaeus's contributions to the nomenclature and methods of systematic biology |journal=[[Systematic Zoology]] |volume=8 |issue=1 |page=8 |jstor=2411603 |url=http://cordyceps.us/files/stearn_1959_.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028133630/http://cordyceps.us/files/stearn_1959_.pdf |archivedate=2014-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linnaeus developed his classification of the plant kingdom in an attempt to describe and understand the natural world as a reflection of the logic of [[God]]'s creation.&lt;ref name=NG&gt;{{cite web |last=Quammen |first=David |title=A Passion for Order |publisher=National Geographic Magazine |date=June 2007 |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/print/2007/06/linnaeus-name-giver/david-quammen-text |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Linnaean taxonomy#For plants|sexual system]], where species with the same number of [[stamen]]s were treated in the same group, was convenient but in his view artificial.&lt;ref name=NG /&gt; Linnaeus believed in [[God]]'s creation, and that there were no deeper relationships to be expressed. He is frequently quoted to have said: "God created, Linnaeus organized" (Latin: ''Deus creavit, Linnaeus disposuit'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Warne|first1=K.|title=Organization Man|journal=Smithsonian Magazine|date=May 2007|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/organization-man-151908042/|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classification of animals was more natural. For instance, [[human]]s were for the first time placed together with other [[primate]]s, as [[Anthropomorpha]].

As a result of the popularity of the work, and the number of new specimens sent to him from around the world,  Linnaeus kept publishing new and ever-expanding editions of his work.&lt;ref name="Everts"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Everts|first1=Sarah|title=Information Overload|journal=Distillations|date=2016|volume=2|issue=2|pages=26–33|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/information-overload|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It grew from eleven very large pages in the first edition (1735) to 2,400 pages in the [[12th edition of Systema Naturae|12th edition]] (1766–1768).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Londa |last=Schiebinger |year=1993 |title=Why mammals are called mammals: gender politics in eighteenth-century natural history |journal=[[The American Historical Review]] |volume=98 |issue=2 |pages=382–411 |jstor=2166840 |pmid=11623150 |url=http://courses.csusm.edu/hist460ae/whymamallsarecalled%20mammals.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002172030/http://courses.csusm.edu/hist460ae/whymamallsarecalled%20mammals.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, as the work progressed, he made changes: in the first edition, [[whale]]s were classified as [[fish]]es, following the work of Linnaeus' friend and "father of [[ichthyology]]" [[Peter Artedi]]; in the 10th edition, published in 1758, [[whale]]s were moved into the [[mammal]] class. In this same edition, he introduced two-part names (see [[binomen]]) for animal species, something that he had done for plant species (see [[binary name]]) in the 1753 publication of ''{{Lang|la|[[Species Plantarum]]}}''. The system eventually developed into modern [[Linnaean taxonomy]], a hierarchically organized [[biological classification]].

After Linnaeus' health declined in the early 1770s, publication of editions of ''Systema Naturae'' went in two directions. Another Swedish scientist, [[Johan Andreas Murray]] issued the ''Regnum Vegetabile'' section separately in 1774 as the ''Systema Vegetabilium'', rather confusingly labelled the 13th edition.{{sfn|Linné|1774}} Meanwhile, a 13th edition of the entire ''Systema'' appeared in parts between 1788 and 1793. It was as the ''Systema Vegetabilium'' that Linnaeus' work became widely known in England following translation from the Latin by the [[Lichfield Botanical Society]], as ''A System of Vegetables'' (1783–1785).{{sfn|Linné|1785}}

== Taxonomy ==
In his ''{{Lang|la|Imperium Naturæ}}'', Linnaeus established three kingdoms, namely ''{{Lang|la|Regnum Animale}}'', ''{{Lang|la|Regnum Vegetabile}}'' and ''{{Lang|la|Regnum Lapideum}}''. This approach, the Animal, Vegetable and Mineral Kingdoms, survives until today in the popular mind, notably in the form of parlour games: "Is it [[animal, vegetable or mineral]]?". The classification was based on five levels: [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]], [[class (biology)|class]], [[order (biology)|order]], [[genus]], and [[species]]. While species and genus was seen as God-given (or "natural"), the three higher levels were seen by Linnaeus as constructs. The concept behind the set ranks being applied to all groups was to make a system that was easy to remember and navigate, a task which most say he succeeded in.

[[File:Linnaeus - Regnum Animale (1735).png|thumb|upright=1.9|The 1735 classification of animals]]
Linnaeus's work had a huge impact on science; it was indispensable as a foundation for [[biological nomenclature]], now regulated by the [[Nomenclature Codes]]. Two of his works, the first edition of the ''{{Lang|la|[[Species Plantarum]]}}'' (1753) for plants and the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|10th edition of the ''Systema Naturæ'']] (1758), are accepted among the starting points of nomenclature. Most of his names for species and genera were published at very early dates, thus take priority over those of other, later works. In zoology there is one exception, which is a monograph on Swedish spiders, ''{{Lang|sv|[[Svenska Spindlar]]}}'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clerck |first=C. |authorlink=Carl Alexander Clerck |year=1757 |title=Svenska Spindlar / Aranei Svecici |pages=[1–8], 1–154, pl. 1–6 |location=[[Stockholm]] |publisher=Laurentius Salvius |url=http://resolver.sub.uni-goettingen.de/purl?PPN367246287}}&lt;/ref&gt; published by [[Carl Alexander Clerck|Carl Clerck]] in 1757, so the names established there take priority over the Linnean names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp ICZN Code] Art. 3.1&lt;/ref&gt; However, his impact on science was not because of the value of his taxonomy. His talent for attracting skillful young students and sending them abroad to collect made his work far more influential than that of his contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sörlin |first1=Sverker |last2=Fagerstedt |first2=Otto |year=2004 |title=Linné och hans apostlar |trans-title=Linnaeus and his apostles |language=Swedish |publisher=[[Natur &amp; Kultur]]/Fakta |location=Örebro, Sweden |isbn=978-91-27-35590-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the close of the 18th century, his system had effectively become the standard system for biological classification.

=== Animal Kingdom ===
Only in the Animal Kingdom is the higher taxonomy of Linnaeus still more or less recognizable and some of these names are still in use, but usually not quite for the same groups as used by Linnaeus. He divided the Animal Kingdom into six classes; in the tenth edition (1758), these were:

#'''[[Mammalia in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Mammalia]]''' comprised the [[mammal]]s. In the first edition, [[Cetacea|whales]] and the [[West Indian manatee]] were classified among the fishes.
#'''[[Aves in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Aves]]''' comprised the [[bird]]s. Linnaeus was the first to remove [[bat]]s from the birds and classify them under mammals.
#'''[[Amphibia in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Amphibia]]''' comprised [[amphibian]]s, [[reptile]]s, and assorted fishes that are not of [[Osteichthyes]].
#'''[[Pisces in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Pisces]]''' comprised the [[Osteichthyes|bony fishes]]. These included the spiny-finned fishes ([[Perciformes]]) as a separate order.
#'''[[Insecta in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Insecta]]''' comprised all [[arthropod]]s. [[Crustacean]]s, [[arachnid]]s and [[myriapod]]s were included as the order "Aptera".
#'''[[Vermes in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Vermes]]''' comprised the remaining [[invertebrate]]s, roughly divided into "worms", [[Mollusca|molluscs]], and hard-shelled organisms like [[echinoderm]]s.

=== Plant Kingdom ===
The orders and classes of plants, according to his ''{{Lang|la|Systema Sexuale}}'', were never intended to represent natural groups (as opposed to his ''{{Lang|la|[[ordo naturalis|ordines naturales]]}}'' in his ''{{Lang|la|Philosophia Botanica}}'') but only for use in identification. They were used in that sense well into the 19th century.
[[File:SN-p837.jpg|thumb|upright|Key to the Sexual System from the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|10th (1758) edition]] of ''{{Lang|la|Systema Naturæ}}'']]
The Linnaean classes for plants, in the Sexual System, were:
{{div col|colwidth=18em}}
* Classis 1. [[Monandria]]
* Classis 2. [[Diandria]]
* Classis 3. [[Triandria (plant group)|Triandria]]
* Classis 4. [[Tetrandria]]
* Classis 5. [[Pentandria]]
* Classis 6. [[Hexandria]]
* Classis 7. [[Heptandria]]
* Classis 8. [[Octandria]]
* Classis 9. [[Enneandria]]
* Classis 10. [[Decandria]]
* Classis 11. [[Dodecandria]]
* Classis 12. [[Icosandria]]
* Classis 13. [[Polyandra (plant group)|Polyandra]]
* Classis 14. [[Didynamia]]
* Classis 15. [[Tetradynamia]]
* Classis 16. [[Monadelphia]]
* Classis 17. [[Diadelphia]]
* Classis 18. [[Polyadelphia]]
* Classis 19. [[Syngenesia]]
* Classis 20. [[Gynandria (plant group)|Gynandria]]
* Classis 21. [[Monoecia]]
* Classis 22. [[Dioecia]]
* Classis 23. [[Polygamia]]
* Classis 24. [[Cryptogam]]ia
{{div col end}}

=== Mineral Kingdoms ===
Linnaeus's taxonomy of [[minerals]] has long since fallen out of use. In the 10th edition, 1758, of the ''{{Lang|la|Systema Naturæ}}'', the Linnaean classes were:

* Classis 1. Petræ ([[Rock (geology)|rocks]])
* Classis 2. Mineræ ([[mineral]]s and [[ore]]s)
* Classis 3. Fossilia ([[fossil]]s and [[sediments|aggregates]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linnaeus.uu.se/online/history/mineralog.html |title=Linnaeus as a mineralogist &lt;!-- website spelling corrected --&gt; |work=Linné on line |publisher=[[Uppsala University]] |year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Editions ==

The Gmelin thirteenth (''decima tertia'') edition of 1788–1793, is likely to be confused with another thirteenth edition prepared by [[Johan Andreas Murray]] in 1774, and then subsequently in further editions, all under a revised name of ''Systema Vegetabilium''.{{sfn|Linné|1774}}

A '''tepui''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɛ|p|w|i}}, or '''tepuy''' ({{IPA-es|teˈpui|lang}}), is a [[Table (landform)|table-top mountain]] or [[mesa]] found in the [[Guiana Highlands]] of [[South America]], especially in [[Venezuela]] and western [[Guyana]]. The word tepui means "house of the gods" in the native tongue of the [[Pemon]], the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] who inhabit the [[La Gran Sabana|Gran Sabana]].

Tepuis tend to be found as isolated entities rather than in connected ranges, which makes them the host of a unique array of [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] plant and animal species. Some of the most outstanding tepuis are [[Neblina massif|Neblina]], [[Cerro Autana|Autana]], [[Auyantepui]] and [[Mount Roraima]]. They are typically composed of sheer blocks of [[Precambrian]] [[quartz arenite]] [[sandstone]] that rise abruptly from the jungle, giving rise to spectacular natural scenery. Auyantepui is the source of [[Angel Falls]], the world's tallest [[waterfall]].

== Morphology ==

[[File:Roraima-Tepui Wand.jpg|thumb|right|The steep rock wall of Mount Roraima]]

These [[Table (landform)|table-top mountains]] are the remains of a large sandstone plateau that once covered the granite basement complex between the north border of the [[Amazon Basin]] and the [[Orinoco]], between the Atlantic coast and the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]]. This area is part of the remnants of the supercontinent [[Gondwana]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DÉSAMORÉ|first1=AURÉLIE|last2=VANDERPOORTEN|first2=ALAIN|last3=LAENEN|first3=BENJAMIN|last4=GRADSTEIN|first4=ROBBERT|last5=KOK|first5=PHILIPPE|title=Biogeography of the Lost World (Pantepui region, northeastern South America): Insights from bryophytes|date=September 2010|publisher=Magnolia Press|ISSN =1179-3163|page=255|url=https://www.biotaxa.org/Phytotaxa/article/view/phytotaxa.9.1.14|doi=10.11646/phytotaxa.9.1.14|volume=9|issue=30|accessdate=11 April 2018|journal=Phytotaxa}}&lt;/ref&gt;.Throughout the course of the [[history of Earth]], the plateau was eroded, and the tepuis were formed from the remaining [[monadnock]]s.
 
[[File:EL FOSO in Mt Roraima 001.JPG|thumb|right|[[Sinkhole]]]]

There are 115 such mesas in the [[La Gran Sabana|Gran Sabana]] in the south-east of Venezuela on the border with [[Guyana]] and [[Brazil]], where the highest concentration of tepuis is found. The precipitous [[mountain]]s tower over the surrounding area by up to {{Convert|1000|m||sp=us}}.

Tepuis range in elevation from {{convert|1,000 – 3,000|m|ft|sp=us}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=nt0169 |name=Tepuis|accessdate=2012-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total surface area of all 115 tepuis is approximately 5000 km2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rull|first1=Valenti|title=Biotic diversification in the Guayana Highlands: a proposal|journal=Journal of Biogeography|date=18 May 2005|volume=32|issue=6|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2699.2005.01252.x|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2005.01252.x|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or the size of [[Trinidad]].
 
Because of their great age, some tepuis exhibit surface features and subsurface caves typical of [[karst]] topography, formed in more water-soluble rocks such as [[limestone]]. Caves here include the {{convert|671|m||-deep|sp=us|adj=mid}} [[Abismo Guy Collet]], the deepest quartzite cave in the world. Some of the [[mesas]] are pocked with giant [[sinkhole]]s up to {{convert|300|meters|ft|sp=us}} in diameter and with sheer walls up to {{convert|300|m||sp=us}} deep. These sinkholes are formed when the roofs of tunnels carved by underground rivers collapse.

== Flora and fauna ==

The plateaus of the tepuis are completely isolated from the ground forest, making them [[ecological island]]s.&lt;ref name="NewYorkTimes-2012.05.07"&gt;Zimmer, Carl. [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/08/science/its-not-so-lonely-at-the-top-tepui-ecosystems-thrive-up-high.html It’s Not So Lonely at the Top: Ecosystems Thrive High in the Sky], [[The New York Times]] website, May 7, 2012, and published in the New York edition, p. D3 on May 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The altitude causes them to have a different climate from the ground forest. The top presents cool temperatures with frequent rainfall, while the bases of the mountains have a tropical, warm and humid climate. The isolation has led to the presence of [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] flora and fauna through evolution over millennia of a different world of animals and plants, cut off from the rest of the world by the imposing rock walls. Some tepui sinkholes contain species that have evolved in these "islands within islands" that are unique to that sinkhole. The tepuis are often referred to as the [[Galápagos Islands]] of the mainland, having a large number of unique plants and animals not found anywhere else in the World. The floors of the mesas are poor in nutrients, which has led to a rich variety of [[carnivorous plants]], as well as a wide variety of [[Orchidaceae|orchids]] and [[Bromeliaceae|bromeliads]]. The weathered, craggy nature of the rocky ground means no layers of [[humus]] are formed.

It has been hypothesized that endemics on tepuis represent [[relict]] fauna and flora that underwent [[vicariant speciation]] when the plateau got fragmented over geological time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chapman |first=F. M. |year=1931 |title=The upper zonal bird-life of Mts. Roraima and Duida. |journal=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History |volume=63 |pages=1–135 |url=http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/handle/2246/983}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent studies suggest that tepuis are not as isolated as originally believed. For example, an endemic group of treefrogs, ''[[Tepuihyla]]'', have diverged after the tepuis were formed, that is, speciation followed colonization from the lowlands.&lt;ref name=Tepuihyla&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Salerno | first1 = P.

The tepuis, also known as 'islands above the rainforest', are a challenge for researchers, as they are home to a high number of new species that have yet to be described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/travel/destinations/latin_america/article2837116.ece |title=Conquering a virgin Venezuelan tepui, The Sunday Times; November 2007 |publisher=Timesonline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few of these mountains are cloaked by thick clouds almost the whole year round. Their surfaces could previously only be photographed by helicopter radar equipment.

Many tepuis are in the [[Canaima National Park]] in Venezuela, which has been classified as a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]].

A few of the most notable of the 60 tepuis:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sarracenia.com/faq/faq5365.html |title=The Carnivorous Plant FAQ: Heliamphora ranges and tepuis |publisher=Sarracenia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popular culture ==
The hypothesis that endemic fauna and flora of tepuis represent remnants of ancient species was an inspiration to [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s novel ''[[The Lost World (Conan Doyle novel)|The Lost World]]'' (1912), which was set on a tepui.

Much of the story of [[Pixar]]–[[Disney]] film ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' takes place among the tepuis. The film also includes depictions of the numerous rock formations and an Angel Falls-like waterfall called "Paradise Falls".

[[Steve Backshall]] was part of the first expedition to successfully climb [[Mount Upuigma]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/travel/destinations/latin_america/article2837116.ece "Conquering a virgin"], ''The Times'', 11 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition was part of the program ''[[Lost Land of the Jaguar]]'' on [[BBC One]] in 2008. On the summit they discovered an endemic species of frog and mouse, and also footprints of an unidentified mammal.

{{About|the saying in cosmology|other uses|Turtles All the Way Down (disambiguation){{!}}Turtles All the Way Down}}

[[File:River terrapin.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Three turtles of varying sizes stacked on top of each other with the largest at the bottom|The saying holds that the world is supported by a chain of increasingly large turtles. Beneath each turtle is yet another: it is "turtles all the way down".]]

"'''Turtles all the way down'''" is an expression of the problem of [[infinite regress]]. The saying alludes to the mythological idea of a [[World Turtle]] that supports the earth on its back. It suggests that this turtle rests on the back of an even larger turtle, which itself is part of a column of increasingly large turtles that continues indefinitely (i.e., "turtles all the way down").  

The exact origin of the phrase is uncertain. In the form "rocks all the way down", the saying appears as early as 1838.&lt;ref name="Rocks" /&gt; References to the saying's mythological antecedents, the [[World Turtle]] and its counterpart the [[World Elephant]], were made by a number of authors in the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref name="Locke 1689" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hume 1779" /&gt; This mythology is frequently assumed to have originated in ancient [[India]] and other [[Hinduist]] beliefs.

The expression has been used to illustrate problems such as the "[[unmoved mover]]" paradox in [[cosmology]] and the [[regress argument]] in [[epistemology]].

===Background in Hindu mythology===
{{further information|World Turtle|World Elephant}}
[[File:PSM V10 D562 The hindoo earth.jpg|thumb|Four World Elephants resting on a World Turtle]]
Early variants of the saying do not always have explicit references to infinite regression (i.e., the phrase "all the way down"). They often reference stories featuring a [[World Elephant]], [[World Turtle]], or other similar creatures that are claimed to come from [[Hindu mythology]]. The first known reference to a Hindu source is found in a letter by [[Jesuit]]  Emanual de Veiga (1549–1605), written at Chandagiri on 18 September 1599, in which the relevant passage reads:
{{Verse translation|lang=la|Alii dicebant terram novem constare angulis, quibus cœlo innititur. Alius ab his dissentiens volebat terram septem elephantis fulciri, elephantes uero ne subsiderent, super testudine pedes fixos habere. Quærenti quis testudinis corpus firmaret, ne dilaberetur, respondere nesciuit.|Others hold that the earth has nine corners by which the heavens are supported. Another disagreeing from these would have the earth supported by seven elephants, and the elephants do not sink down because their feet are fixed on a tortoise.

Veiga's account seems to have been received by [[Samuel Purchas]], who has a close paraphrase in his ''Purchas His Pilgrims'' (1613/1626), &lt;!-- but note "tortoises" vs. the singular tortoise in Veiga--&gt;
"that the Earth had nine corners, whereby it was borne up by the Heaven. Others dissented, and said, that the Earth was borne up by seven Elephants; the Elephants' feet stood on Tortoises, and they were borne by they know not what."&lt;ref&gt;Will Sweetman, [http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind1004&amp;L=indology&amp;D=1&amp;O=D&amp;F=PP&amp;P=1005 Indology mailing list], citing Dieter Henrich, 'Die "wahrhafte Schildkröte"' ''Hegel-Studien'' 2 (1963), pp.  281-91, and J.

Bulletin of the School of Oriental Studies, University of London 3(2) (1924), pp. 317-342.&lt;/ref&gt; Purchas' account is again reflected by [[John Locke]] in his 1689 tract ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'', where Locke introduces the story as a trope referring to the problem of induction in philosophical debate. Locke compares one who would say that properties inhere in "Substance" to the Indian who said the world was on an elephant which was on a tortoise, "But being again pressed to know what gave support to the broad-back'd Tortoise, replied, something, he knew not what".&lt;ref name="Locke 1689"&gt;John Locke (1689). ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'', Book II, Chapter XXIII, section 2&lt;/ref&gt; The story is also referenced by [[Henry David Thoreau]], who writes in his journal entry of 4 May 1852: "Men are making speeches ... all over the country, but each expresses only the thought, or the want of thought, of the multitude. No man stands on truth. They are merely banded together as usual, one leaning on another and all together on nothing; as the Hindoos &lt;!--sic; a common 19th-century spelling--&gt;  made the world rest on an elephant, and the elephant on a tortoise, and had nothing to put under the tortoise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sniggle.net/Experiment/index.php?entry=excerpts04#04May52|title=TPL • Excerpts from H.D.

===Modern form===
In the form of "rocks all the way down", the saying dates to at least 1838, when it was printed in an unsigned anecdote in the ''[[New-York Mirror]]'' about a schoolboy and an old woman living in the woods:
{{quote|"The world, marm," said I, anxious to display my acquired knowledge, "is not exactly round, but resembles in shape a flattened orange; and it turns on its axis once in twenty-four hours."&lt;p&gt;"Well, I don't know anything about its ''axes''," replied she, "but I know it don't turn round, for if it did we'd be all tumbled off; and as to its being round, any one can see it's a square piece of ground, standing on a rock!"&lt;p&gt;"Standing on a rock! but upon what does that stand?"&lt;p&gt;"Why, on another, to be sure!"&lt;p&gt;"But what supports the last?"&lt;p&gt;"Lud! child, how stupid you are! There's rocks all the way down!"&lt;ref name="Rocks"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=New-York Mirror |date=September 15, 1838 |volume=16 |number=12 |page=91 |title=Unwritten Philosophy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4n1NAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA91}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A version of the saying in its "turtle" form appeared in an 1854 transcript of remarks by preacher Joseph Frederick Berg addressed to [[Joseph Barker (minister)|Joseph Barker]]:
{{quote|My opponent's reasoning reminds me of the heathen, who, being asked on what the world stood, replied, "On a tortoise." But on what does the tortoise stand? "On another tortoise." With Mr. Barker, too, there are tortoises all the way down. (Vehement and vociferous applause.)| "Second Evening: Remarks of Rev. Dr. Berg"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barker |first=Joseph |title=Great Discussion on the Origin, Authority, and Tendency of the Bible, between Rev. J. F. Berg, D.D., of Philadelphia, and Joseph Barker, of Ohio |publisher=J. B. Yerrinton &amp; Son, Printers |date=1854 |location=Boston |page=48 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SGtYAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA48}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:William James b1842c.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William James]]]]
Many 20th-century attributions claim that [[William James]] is the source of the phrase.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Anton Wilson]] (1983). [[Prometheus Rising]]. Phoenix, AZ: New Falcon Publishers. p. 25. {{ISBN|1-56184-056-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; James referred to the fable of the elephant and tortoise several times, but told the infinite regress story with "rocks all the way down" in his 1882 essay, "Rationality, Activity and Faith":
{{quote|Like the old woman in the story who described the world as resting on a rock, and then explained that rock to be supported by another rock, and finally when pushed with questions said it was "rocks all the way down," he who believes this to be a radically moral universe must hold the moral order to rest either on an absolute and ultimate ''should'' or on a series of ''shoulds'' "all the way down."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=James |first=William |title=Rationality, Activity and Faith |journal=The Princeton Review |page=82 |date=July 1882 |url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moajrnl/acf4325.3-01.010/86:6?page=root;size=100;view=image}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The linguist [[John R. Ross]] also associates James with the phrase:
{{quote|The following anecdote is told of William James. [...] After a lecture on cosmology and the structure of the solar system, James was accosted by a little old lady.&lt;p&gt;"Your theory that the sun is the centre of the solar system, and the earth is a ball which rotates around it has a very convincing ring to it, Mr. James, but it's wrong. I've got a better theory," said the little old lady.&lt;p&gt;"And what is that, madam?" inquired James politely.&lt;p&gt;"That we live on a crust of earth which is on the back of a giant turtle."&lt;p&gt;Not wishing to demolish this absurd little theory by bringing to bear the masses of scientific evidence he had at his command, James decided to gently dissuade his opponent by making her see some of the inadequacies of her position.&lt;p&gt;"If your theory is correct, madam," he asked, "what does this turtle stand on?"&lt;p&gt;"You're a very clever man, Mr. James, and that's a very good question," replied the little old lady, "but I have an answer to it. And it's this: The first turtle stands on the back of a second, far larger, turtle, who stands directly under him."&lt;p&gt;"But what does this second turtle stand on?" persisted James patiently.&lt;p&gt;To this, the little old lady crowed triumphantly,&lt;p&gt;"It's no use, Mr. James — it's turtles all the way down."|J.

==In epistemology and other disciplines==
The [[metaphor]] is used as an example of the problem of infinite regress in epistemology to show that there is a necessary foundation to knowledge, as written by Johann Gottlieb Fichte in 1794:&lt;ref name="Fichte 1794"&gt;Fichte, J. G. (1794). Ueber den Begriff der Wissenschaftslehre oder der sogenannten Philosophie (Concerning the Conception of the Science of Knowledge Generally) (A. E. Kroeger, Trans.).&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2017}}

{{quote|"If there is not to be any (system of human knowledge dependent upon an absolute first principle) two cases are only possible.  Either there is no immediate certainty at all, and then our knowledge forms many series or one infinite series, wherein each theorem is derived from a higher one, and this again from a higher one, et., etc.  We build our houses on the earth, the earth rests on an elephant, the elephant on a tortoise, the tortoise again--who knows on what?-- and so on ad infinitum.  True, if our knowledge is thus constituted, we can not alter it; but neither have we, then, any firm knowledge.  We may have gone back to a certain link of our series, and have found every thing firm up to this link; but who can guarantee us that, if we go further back, we may not find it ungrounded, and shall thus have to abandon it?  Our certainty is only assumed, and we can never be sure of it for a single following day."}}

[[David Hume]] references the story in his ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]'' when arguing against God as an unmoved mover:&lt;ref name="Hume 1779"&gt;David Hume (1779). ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]'', part 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote| How, therefore, shall we satisfy ourselves concerning the cause of that Being whom you suppose the Author of Nature, or, according to your system of Anthropomorphism, the ideal world, into which you trace the material? Have we not the same reason to trace that ideal world into another ideal world, or new intelligent principle? But if we stop, and go no further; why go so far? why not stop at the material world? How can we satisfy ourselves without going on in infinitum? And, after all, what satisfaction is there in that infinite progression? Let us remember the story of the Indian philosopher and his elephant. It was never more applicable than to the present subject. If the material world rests upon a similar ideal world, this ideal world must rest upon some other; and so on, without end. It were better, therefore, never to look beyond the present material world. By supposing it to contain the principle of its order within itself, we really assert it to be God; and the sooner we arrive at that Divine Being, so much the better. When you go one step beyond the mundane system, you only excite an inquisitive humour which it is impossible ever to satisfy.}}

[[Bertrand Russell]] also mentions the story in his 1927 lecture ''[[Why I Am Not a Christian]]'' while discounting the [[First Cause]] argument intended to be a proof of God's existence:

{{quote|If everything must have a cause, then God must have a cause. If there can be anything without a cause, it may just as well be the world as God, so that there cannot be any validity in that argument. It is exactly of the same nature as the Hindu's view, that the world rested upon an elephant and the elephant rested upon a tortoise; and when they said, 'How about the tortoise?' the Indian said, 'Suppose we change the subject.'}}

==Notable modern allusions or variations==
References to "turtles all the way down" have been made in a variety of modern contexts. For example, "[[Turtles All the Way Down (song)|Turtles All the Way Down]]" is the name of a song by country artist [[Sturgill Simpson]] that appears on his 2014 album ''[[Metamodern Sounds in Country Music]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hendrickson|first=Matt|title=Sturgill Simpson: Country Philosopher|url=http://gardenandgun.com/articles/sturgill-simpson-country-philosopher/|website=Garden &amp; Gun|date=2014|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Turtles All the Way Down (novel)|Turtles All The Way Down]]'' is also the title of a 2017 novel by [[John Green (author)|John Green]] about a teenage girl with obsessive compulsive disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Senior, Jennifer (October 10, 2017).  [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/books/review-john-green-turtles-all-the-way-down.html "In John Green’s ‘Turtles All the Way Down,’ a Teenager’s Mind Is at War With Itself."]  ''The New York Times''.  Retrieved October 29, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--The story can also be found in [[Bernard Nietschmann]]'s "When the Turtle Collapses, the World Ends", Natural History, 83(6):34 (June–July 1974).--&gt;

[[Stephen Hawking]] incorporates the saying into the beginning of his 1988 book ''[[A Brief History of Time]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Hawking, Stephen | title= A Brief History of Time | publisher=[[Bantam Books]] | date=1988 | isbn=978-0-553-05340-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|A well-known scientist (some say it was [[Bertrand Russell]]) once gave a public lecture on astronomy. He described how the earth orbits around the sun and how the sun, in turn, orbits around the center of a vast collection of stars called our galaxy. At the end of the lecture, a little old lady at the back of the room got up and said: "What you have told us is rubbish. The world is really a flat plate supported on the back of a giant tortoise." The scientist gave a superior smile before replying, "What is the tortoise standing on?" "You're very clever, young man, very clever," said the old lady. "But it's turtles all the way down!"}}

Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] of the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] discussed his "favored version" of the saying in a footnote to his plurality opinion in ''[[Rapanos v. United States]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rapanos v. United States |date=June 19, 2006 |at=Section VII, footnote 14 |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/04-1034.ZO.html#14 |via=Cornell Law School Legal Information Institute's Supreme Court collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In our favored version, an Eastern guru affirms that the earth is supported on the back of a tiger. When asked what supports the tiger, he says it stands upon an elephant; and when asked what supports the elephant he says it is a giant turtle. When asked, finally, what supports the giant turtle, he is briefly taken aback, but quickly replies "Ah, after that it is turtles all the way down."}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1884">'''Zanahary''' is the [[sky deity|personified sky]] of [[Malagasy mythology|Malagasy mythologies and folklores]]. He (usually male, but sometimes considered genderless&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Cotterell, A Dictionary of World Mythology, Oxford University Press, 17/04/1986&lt;/ref&gt;) is considered a creator god, having collaborated with the earth god [[Ratovantany]] to create humanity; upon death, the soul migrates to the firmament, while the body returns to the earth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scilt.org.uk/portals/24/passeport2/educationscotland/Images/MadagascarCreationMyth_tcm4-730169.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Cotterell, A Dictionary of World Mythology, Oxford University Press, 17/04/1986&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, Zanahary is closely associated with the soul in the indigenous theology as well as ancestor worship.&lt;ref&gt;Littleton, C. Scott (2005). Gods, goddesses, and mythology. Marshall Cavendish. p. 74. {{ISBN|9780761475590}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He is a national god of the [[Merina]] people, and frequently henceforth appealed to by Malagasy nationalist groups; most notably [[Ranavalona I]] promoted the worship of this god over [[Christianity]].

The [[Bara people]] and [[Betsimisaraka people]] possess a myth in which the role of Zanahary is taken by the [[solar deity|personified sun]], which accepts souls after death;&lt;ref&gt;"ASK BALLADEER: IS THERE A MALAGASY SOLAR DEITY?". Balladeer's Blog. 2018-06-03. Retrieved 2018-06-14.&lt;/ref&gt; however Zanahary is typically assumed to be devoid of solar characteristics. Similarly there is an "earth Zanahary" in contrast to the sky.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Cotterell, A Dictionary of World Mythology, Oxford University Press, 17/04/1986&lt;/ref&gt;
