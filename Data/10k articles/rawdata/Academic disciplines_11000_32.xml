[[File:Binary search vs Linear search example svg.svg|thumb|For looking up a given entry in a given ordered list, both the [[binary search algorithm|binary]] and the [[linear search]] algorithm (which ignores ordering) can be used. The analysis of the former and the latter algorithm shows that it takes at most log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') and ''n'' check steps, respectively, for a list of length ''n''. In the depicted example list of length 33, searching for ''"Morin, Arthur"'' takes 5 and 28 steps with binary (shown in {{color|#008080|cyan}}) and linear ({{color|#800080|magenta}}) search, respectively.]]
{{comparison computational complexity.svg|N=}}
In [[computer science]], the '''analysis of algorithms''' is the determination of the [[computational complexity]] of algorithms, that is the amount of time, storage and/or other resources necessary to [[computation|execute them]]. Usually, this involves determining a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] that relates the length of an algorithm's input to the number of steps it takes (its [[time complexity]]) or the number of storage locations it uses (its [[space complexity]]). An algorithm is said to be efficient when this function's values are small, or grow slowly compared to a growth in the size of the input. Different inputs of the same length may cause the algorithm to have different behavior, so [[best, worst and average case]] descriptions might all be of practical interest.  When not otherwise specified, the function describing the performance of an algorithm is usually an [[upper bound]], determined from the worst case inputs to the algorithm.

The term "analysis of algorithms" was coined by [[Donald Knuth]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160828152021/http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/news.html Donald Knuth, Recent News]&lt;/ref&gt; Algorithm analysis is an important part of a broader [[computational complexity theory]], which provides theoretical estimates for the resources needed by any algorithm which solves a given [[computational problem]]. These estimates provide an insight into reasonable directions of search for [[Algorithmic efficiency|efficient algorithms]].

In theoretical analysis of algorithms it is common to estimate their complexity in the asymptotic sense, i.e., to estimate the complexity function for arbitrarily large input. [[Big O notation]], [[Big-omega notation]] and [[Big-theta notation]] are used to this end. For instance, [[binary search]] is said to run in a number of steps proportional to the logarithm of the length of the sorted list being searched, or in O(log(n)), colloquially "in [[logarithmic time]]". Usually [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic]] estimates are used because different [[implementation]]s of the same algorithm may differ in efficiency. However the efficiencies of any two "reasonable" implementations of a given algorithm are related by a constant multiplicative factor  called a ''hidden constant''.

Exact (not asymptotic) measures of efficiency can sometimes be computed but they usually require certain assumptions concerning the particular implementation of the algorithm, called [[model of computation]]. A model of computation may be defined in terms of an [[abstract machine|abstract computer]], e.g., [[Turing machine]], and/or by postulating that certain operations are executed in unit time.
For example, if the sorted list to which we apply binary search has ''n'' elements, and we can guarantee that each lookup of an element in the list can be done in unit time, then at most log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''n'' + 1 time units are needed to return an answer.
&lt;!-- Exact measures of efficiency are useful to the people who actually implement and use algorithms, because they are more precise and thus enable them to know how much time they can expect to spend in execution. To some people (e.g. game programmers), a hidden constant can make all the difference between success and failure.--&gt;

== Cost models ==
Time efficiency estimates depend on what we define to be a step. For the analysis to correspond usefully to the actual execution time, the time required to perform a step must be guaranteed to be bounded above by a constant. One must be careful here; for instance, some analyses count an addition of two numbers as one step. This assumption may not be warranted in certain contexts. For example, if the numbers involved in a computation may be arbitrarily large, the time required by a single addition can no longer be assumed to be constant.

Two cost models are generally used:&lt;ref name="AhoHopcroft1974"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alfred V. Aho|author2=John E. Hopcroft|author3=Jeffrey D. Ullman|title=The design and analysis of computer algorithms|year=1974|publisher=Addison-Wesley Pub.

* the '''uniform cost model''', also called '''uniform-cost measurement''' (and similar variations), assigns a constant cost to every machine operation, regardless of the size of the numbers involved
* the '''logarithmic cost model''', also called '''logarithmic-cost measurement''' (and similar variations), assigns a cost to every machine operation proportional to the number of bits involved

The latter is more cumbersome to use, so it's only employed when necessary, for example in the analysis of [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic]] algorithms, like those used in [[cryptography]].

A key point which is often overlooked is that published lower bounds for problems are often given for a model of computation that is more restricted than the set of operations that you could use in practice and therefore there are algorithms that are faster than what would naively be thought possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/608/examples-of-the-price-of-abstraction Examples of the price of abstraction?], cstheory.stackexchange.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Run-time analysis==
Run-time analysis is a theoretical classification that estimates and anticipates the increase in ''[[DTIME|running time]]'' (or run-time) of an [[algorithm]] as its ''[[Information|input size]]'' (usually denoted as ''n'') increases.  Run-time efficiency is a topic of great interest in [[computer science]]:  A [[Computer program|program]] can take seconds, hours, or even years to finish executing, depending on which algorithm it implements. While [[software profiling]] techniques can be used to measure an algorithm's run-time in practice, they cannot provide timing data for all infinitely many possible inputs; the latter can only be achieved by the theoretical methods of run-time analysis.

===Shortcomings of empirical metrics===

Since algorithms are [[platform-independent]] (i.e. a given algorithm can be implemented in an arbitrary [[programming language]] on an arbitrary [[computer]] running an arbitrary [[operating system]]), there are additional significant drawbacks to using an [[empirical]] approach to gauge the comparative performance of a given set of algorithms.

Take as an example a program that looks up a specific entry in a [[collation|sorted]] [[list (computing)|list]] of size ''n''.  Suppose this program were implemented on Computer A, a state-of-the-art machine, using a [[linear search]] algorithm, and on Computer B, a much slower machine, using a [[binary search algorithm]].  [[benchmark (computing)|Benchmark testing]] on the two computers running their respective programs might look something like the following:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! ''n'' (list size)
! Computer A run-time&lt;br /&gt;(in [[nanosecond]]s)
! Computer B run-time&lt;br /&gt;(in [[nanosecond]]s)
|-

| 250
| 125 
| 200,000 
|-
| 1,000
| 500 
| 250,000 
|}

Based on these metrics, it would be easy to jump to the conclusion that ''Computer A'' is running an algorithm that is far superior in efficiency to that of ''Computer B''.  However, if the size of the input-list is increased to a sufficient number, that conclusion is dramatically demonstrated to be in error:

{| class="wikitable"

| 1,375,000 ns,&lt;br /&gt;or 1.375 milliseconds
|}

Computer A, running the linear search program, exhibits a [[linear]] growth rate.  The program's run-time is directly proportional to its input size.  Doubling the input size doubles the run time, quadrupling the input size quadruples the run-time, and so forth.  On the other hand, Computer B, running the binary search program, exhibits a [[logarithm]]ic growth rate.  Quadrupling the input size only increases the run time by a [[wiktionary:Constant|constant]] amount (in this example, 50,000 ns).  Even though Computer A is ostensibly a faster machine, Computer B will inevitably surpass Computer A in run-time because it's running an algorithm with a much slower growth rate.

===Orders of growth===
{{main|Big O notation}}
Informally, an algorithm can be said to exhibit a growth rate on the order of a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]] if beyond a certain input size ''n'', the function {{tmath|f(n)}} times a positive constant provides an [[Asymptotic analysis|upper bound or limit]] for the run-time of that algorithm.  In other words, for a given input size ''n'' greater than some ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and a constant ''c'', the running time of that algorithm will never be larger than {{tmath|c \times f(n)}}.  This concept is frequently expressed using Big O notation.  For example, since the run-time of [[insertion sort]] [[quadratic growth|grows quadratically]] as its input size increases, insertion sort can be said to be of order ''O''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

Big O notation is a convenient way to express the [[Best, worst and average case|worst-case scenario]] for a given algorithm, although it can also be used to express the average-case &amp;mdash; for example, the worst-case scenario for [[quicksort]] is ''O''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), but the average-case run-time is {{math|''O''(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'')}}.

===Empirical orders of growth===

Assuming the execution time follows power rule, ''{{math|t &amp;asymp; k n&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;}}'', the coefficient ''a'' can be found &lt;ref&gt;[http://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/07/24/how-to-avoid-o-abuse-and-bribes/ How To Avoid O-Abuse and Bribes], at the blog "Gödel’s Lost Letter and P=NP" by R. J. Lipton, professor of Computer Science at Georgia Tech, recounting idea by Robert Sedgewick&lt;/ref&gt; by taking empirical measurements of run time &lt;math&gt;\{t_1, t_2\}&lt;/math&gt; at some problem-size points &lt;math&gt;\{n_1, n_2\}&lt;/math&gt;, and calculating &lt;math&gt;t_2/t_1 = (n_2/n_1)^a&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;a = \log(t_2/t_1) / \log(n_2/n_1)&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, this measures the slope of the empirical line on the [[log–log plot]] of execution time vs. problem size, at some size point. If the order of growth indeed follows the power rule (and so the line on log–log plot is indeed a straight line), the empirical value of ''a'' will  stay constant at different ranges, and if not, it will change (and the line is a curved line) - but still could serve for comparison of any two given algorithms as to their ''empirical local orders of growth'' behaviour. Applied to the above table:

It is clearly seen that the first algorithm exhibits a linear order of growth indeed following the power rule. The empirical values for the second one are diminishing rapidly, suggesting it follows another rule of growth and in any case has much lower local orders of growth (and improving further still), empirically, than the first one.

=== Evaluating run-time complexity ===
The run-time complexity for the worst-case scenario of a given algorithm can sometimes be evaluated by examining the structure of the algorithm and making some simplifying assumptions.  Consider the following [[pseudocode]]:

 1    ''get a positive integer from input''
 2    '''if''' n &gt; 10
 3        '''print''' "This might take a while..."
 4    '''for''' i = 1 '''to''' n
 5        '''for''' j = 1 '''to''' i
 6            '''print''' i * j
 7    '''print''' "Done!"

A given computer will take a [[DTIME|discrete amount of time]] to execute each of the [[Instruction (computer science)|instructions]] involved with carrying out this algorithm.  The specific amount of time to carry out a given instruction will vary depending on which instruction is being executed and which computer is executing it, but on a conventional computer, this amount will be [[Deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]].&lt;ref&gt;However, this is not the case with a [[quantum computer]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Say that the actions carried out in step 1 are considered to consume time ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, step 2 uses time ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and so forth.

In the algorithm above, steps 1, 2 and 7 will only be run once.  For a worst-case evaluation, it should be assumed that step 3 will be run as well.  Thus the total amount of time to run steps 1-3 and step 7 is:

:&lt;math&gt;T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + T_7. \,&lt;/math&gt;

The [[program loop|loops]] in steps 4, 5 and 6 are trickier to evaluate.  The outer loop test in step 4 will execute ( ''n'' + 1 )
times (note that an extra step is required to terminate the for loop, hence n + 1 and not n executions), which will consume ''T''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;( ''n'' + 1 ) time.  The inner loop, on the other hand, is governed by the value of j, which [[iteration|iterates]] from 1 to ''i''.  On the first pass through the outer loop, j iterates from 1 to 1:  The inner loop makes one pass, so running the inner loop body (step 6) consumes ''T''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; time, and the inner loop test (step 5) consumes 2''T''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; time.  During the next pass through the outer loop, j iterates from 1 to 2:  the inner loop makes two passes, so running the inner loop body (step 6) consumes 2''T''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; time, and the inner loop test (step 5) consumes 3''T''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; time.

Altogether, the total time required to run the inner loop body can be expressed as an [[arithmetic progression]]:

:&lt;math&gt;T_6 + 2T_6 + 3T_6 + \cdots + (n-1) T_6 + n T_6&lt;/math&gt;

which can be [[factorization|factored]]&lt;ref&gt;It can be proven by [[Mathematical induction|induction]] that &lt;math&gt;1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + (n-1) + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt;T_6 \left[ 1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + (n-1) + n \right] = T_6 \left[ \frac{1}{2} (n^2 + n) \right] &lt;/math&gt;

The total time required to run the outer loop test can be evaluated similarly:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp; 2T_5 + 3T_5 + 4T_5 + \cdots + (n-1) T_5 + n T_5 + (n + 1) T_5\\
=\ &amp;T_5 + 2T_5 + 3T_5 + 4T_5 + \cdots + (n-1)T_5 + nT_5 + (n+1)T_5 - T_5
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

which can be factored as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp; T_5 \left[ 1+2+3+\cdots + (n-1) + n + (n + 1) \right] - T_5 \\
=&amp; \left[ \frac{1}{2} (n^2 + n) \right]  T_5 +  (n + 1)T_5 - T_5 \\
=&amp; T_5 \left[ \frac{1}{2} (n^2 + n) \right] + n T_5 \\
=&amp; \left[ \frac{1}{2} (n^2 + 3n) \right] T_5
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the total running time for this algorithm is:

:&lt;math&gt;f(n) = T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + T_7 + (n + 1)T_4 + \left[ \frac{1}{2} (n^2 + n) \right] T_6 + \left[ \frac{1}{2} (n^2+3n) \right] T_5 &lt;/math&gt;

which [[reduction (mathematics)|reduces]] to

:&lt;math&gt;f(n) = \left[ \frac{1}{2} (n^2 + n) \right] T_6 + \left[ \frac{1}{2} (n^2 + 3n) \right] T_5 + (n + 1)T_4 + T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + T_7
&lt;/math&gt;

As a [[rule-of-thumb]], one can assume that the highest-order term in any given function dominates its rate of growth and thus defines its run-time order.  In this example, n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the highest-order term, so one can conclude that f(n) = O(n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).  Formally this can be proven as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Prove that &lt;math&gt;\left[ \frac{1}{2} (n^2 + n) \right] T_6 + \left[ \frac{1}{2} (n^2 + 3n) \right] T_5 + (n + 1)T_4 + T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + T_7 \le cn^2,\ n \ge n_0&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp;\left[ \frac{1}{2} (n^2 + n) \right] T_6 + \left[ \frac{1}{2} (n^2 + 3n) \right] T_5 + (n + 1)T_4 + T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + T_7\\
\le &amp;( n^2 + n )T_6 + ( n^2 + 3n )T_5 + (n + 1)T_4 + T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + T_7 \ (\text{for } n \ge 0 )
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Let ''k'' be a constant greater than or equal to [''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;..''T''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp;T_6( n^2 + n ) + T_5( n^2 + 3n ) + (n + 1)T_4 + T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + T_7 \le k( n^2 + n ) + k( n^2 + 3n ) + kn + 5k\\
= &amp;2kn^2 + 5kn + 5k \le 2kn^2 + 5kn^2 + 5kn^2 \ (\text{for } n \ge 1) = 12kn^2
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Therefore &lt;math&gt;\left[ \frac{1}{2} (n^2 + n) \right] T_6 + \left[ \frac{1}{2} (n^2 + 3n) \right] T_5 + (n + 1)T_4 + T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + T_7 \le cn^2, n \ge n_0 \text{ for } c = 12k, n_0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A more [[elegance|elegant]] approach to analyzing this algorithm would be to declare that [''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;..''T''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;] are all equal to one unit of time, in a system of units chosen so that one unit is greater than or equal to the actual times for these steps.  This would mean that the algorithm's running time breaks down as follows:&lt;ref&gt;This approach, unlike the above approach, neglects the constant time consumed by the loop tests which terminate their respective loops, but it is [[Trivial (mathematics)|trivial]] to prove that such omission does not affect the final result&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;4+\sum_{i=1}^n i\leq 4+\sum_{i=1}^n n=4+n^2\leq5n^2 \ (\text{for } n \ge 1) =O(n^2).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Growth rate analysis of other resources===
The methodology of run-time analysis can also be utilized for predicting other growth rates, such as consumption of [[DSPACE|memory space]].  As an example, consider the following pseudocode which manages and reallocates memory usage by a program based on the size of a [[computer file|file]] which that program manages:

 '''while''' (''file still open'')
     '''let''' n = ''size of file''
     '''for''' ''every 100,000 [[kilobyte]]s of increase in file size''
         ''double the amount of memory reserved''

In this instance, as the file size n increases, memory will be consumed at an [[exponential growth]] rate, which is order O(2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;). This is an extremely rapid and most likely unmanageable growth rate for consumption of memory [[Resource (computer science)|resources]].

==Relevance==
Algorithm analysis is important in practice because the accidental or unintentional use of an inefficient algorithm can significantly impact system performance. In time-sensitive applications, an algorithm taking too long to run can render its results outdated or useless. An inefficient algorithm can also end up requiring an uneconomical amount of computing power or storage in order to run, again rendering it practically useless.

==Constant factors==
Analysis of algorithms typically focuses on the asymptotic performance, particularly at the elementary level, but in practical applications constant factors are important, and real-world data is in practice always limited in size. The limit is typically the size of addressable memory, so on 32-bit machines 2&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; = 4 GiB (greater if [[segmented memory]] is used) and on 64-bit machines 2&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt; = 16 EiB. Thus given a limited size, an order of growth (time or space) can be replaced by a constant factor, and in this sense all practical algorithms are O(1) for a large enough constant, or for small enough data.

This interpretation is primarily useful for functions that grow extremely slowly: (binary) [[iterated logarithm]] (log&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;) is less than 5 for all practical data (2&lt;sup&gt;65536&lt;/sup&gt; bits); (binary) log-log (log log ''n'') is less than 6 for virtually all practical data (2&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt; bits); and binary log (log ''n'') is less than 64 for virtually all practical data (2&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt; bits). An algorithm with non-constant complexity may nonetheless be more efficient than an algorithm with constant complexity on practical data if the overhead of the constant time algorithm results in a larger constant factor, e.g., one may have &lt;math&gt;K &gt; k \log \log n&lt;/math&gt; so long as &lt;math&gt;K/k &gt; 6&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n &lt; 2^{2^6} = 2^{64}&lt;/math&gt;.

For large data linear or quadratic factors cannot be ignored, but for small data an asymptotically inefficient algorithm may be more efficient. This is particularly used in [[hybrid algorithm]]s, like [[Timsort]], which use an asymptotically efficient algorithm (here [[merge sort]], with time complexity &lt;math&gt;n \log n&lt;/math&gt;), but switch to an asymptotically inefficient algorithm (here [[insertion sort]], with time complexity &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt;) for small data, as the simpler algorithm is faster on small data.

[[File:Andrews curve for Iris data set.png|thumb|360px|Andrews curve for Iris data set]]

In [[data visualization]], an '''Andrews plot''' or '''Andrews curve''' is a way to visualize structure in high-dimensional data. It is basically a rolled-down, non-integer version of the Kent–Kiviat [[radar chart|radar m chart]], or a smoothened version of a [[parallel coordinates|parallel coordinate plot]].

A value &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; is a [[Real coordinate space|high-dimensional datapoint]] if it is an element of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R ^d &lt;/math&gt;. We can represent high-dimensional data with a number for each of their dimensions,  &lt;math&gt;x = \left \{ x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_d \right \}&lt;/math&gt;.  To visualize them, the Andrews plot  defines a finite [[Fourier series]]:

: &lt;math&gt;f_x(t) = \frac{x_1}{\sqrt 2} + x_2 \sin(t) + x_3 \cos(t) + x_4 \sin(2t) + x_5 \cos(2t) + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

This function is then plotted for &lt;math&gt;-\pi &lt; t &lt; \pi&lt;/math&gt;. Thus each data point may be viewed as a line between &lt;math&gt;-\pi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;. This formula can be thought of as the projection of the data point onto the vector:

: &lt;math&gt;\left ( \frac 1 {\sqrt 2}, \sin(t), \cos(t), \sin(2t), \cos(2t), \ldots \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

If there is structure in the data, it may be visible in the Andrews' curves of the data.

These curves have been utilized in fields as different as [[biology]], [[neurology]], [[sociology]] and [[semiconductor]] manufacturing. Some of their uses include the [[quality control]] of products, the detection of period and [[outlier]]s in [[time series]], the visualization of learning in [[artificial neural network]]s, and correspondence analysis.

Theoretically, it is possible to project them onto an [[n-sphere|''n''-sphere]]. The projection onto the circle results in the aforementioned [[Radar chart]]. This could prove to be a powerful computer-aided multivariable visualization method if, upon projection onto the common tridimensional sphere, the layers are given some degree of transparency on their [[alpha channel]] so as to allow to see through.

The '''Center for Microbial Oceanography''' ('''C-MORE''') is a research and education organization established in 2006 as a [[National Science Foundation]] funded Science and Technology Center.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/programs/stc/2006.jsp NSF: Science and Technology Centers Program]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
It has been said that more is known about the surface of the moon than about the Earth’s oceans.&lt;ref&gt;Kettlewell, Julianna.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3210544.stm "Ocean census discovers new fish"], ''BBC'', October 23, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; C-MORE was designed to explore the largely unknown world of [[microorganisms]] in the sea and to educate the public and other scientists about these organisms. The motto of the center is “From [[genomes]] to [[biomes]]” meaning that the researchers want to look at how the [[Biodiversity|diversity]] of microbes in the ocean influences the [[structure]] and [[Function (biology)|function]] of the world’s largest biome, the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, Tim.[http://currents.ucsc.edu/06-07/08-14/microbes.asp "UCSC collaborates in interdisciplinary center to study marine microbes"], ''UC Santa Cruz Currents online'', August 14, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The center was initially proposed, and is now directed by Professor [[David Karl]], of the [[University of Hawai'i at Manoa]].  C-MORE has affiliated researchers working at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], the [[Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute]], [[Oregon State University]], the [[University of California Santa Cruz]], the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute]], and the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]].  C-MORE is the only one of NSF’s 17 Science and Technology Centers that focuses on [[Environmental microbiology|microbial oceanography]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/programs/stc/documents.jsp NSF: Science and Technology Centers Program]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
C-MORE scientists want to understand biological processes that begin at microscopic scales and are expressed in vitally significant issues such as [[climate change]].  Areas of research range from [[genomic]] surveys, to studies of the genetic basis of marine microbial [[biogeochemistry]] to building [[ecosystem models]].&lt;ref&gt;AP.[http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2006/08/03/hawaii_gets_19_million_for_oceanography_center/ "Hawaii gets $19 million for oceanography center"], ''Boston.com'', August 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;   One of the strengths of the Center is its seagoing capability, as well as the long term studies that have been conducted by the [[Hawaii Ocean Time-series]] (HOT) Program in the [[North Pacific Subtropical Gyre]].  In addition to extensive laboratory experimentation, C-MORE also stages cruises to examine marine microbes in their environment.  One example was the [[SUPER HI-CAT]] cruise, which was the first effort to study the microbiology associated with the plastic particles in the [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]].

==Education==
C-MORE is active in increasing [[scientific literacy]] about microbial oceanography among the general population, as well as training microbial oceanographers.  C-MORE has undergraduate internships &lt;ref&gt;http://cmore.soest.hawaii.edu/education/undergraduates/scholars_program.htm C-MORE: Undergraduate Internships&lt;/ref&gt;  as well as a summer graduate training course ([http://cmore.soest.hawaii.edu/agouron/index.htm the Agouron Course]). C-MORE also provides resources for K-12 educators, such as training workshops, science kits, and a teacher at sea program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mbari.org/news/news-briefs/briefs-2008.html "MBARI scientist leads cruise to study how changing ocean conditions affect marine algae"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630234450/http://www.mbari.org/news/news-briefs/briefs-2008.html |date=June 30, 2009 }}, ''MBARI News Briefs 2008'', July 31, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3002">The '''Central Register and Clearing House (CRCH)''' was an administrative organisation in teacher education in England and Wales which existed for almost sixty years.  It pre-dated by some thirty years a similar organisation for university courses ([[Universities Central Council on Admissions|UCCA]]).

By the late 1920s great confusion had developed in admissions to teacher training courses.  There were some fifty colleges. Potential students applied direct to each one and could receive an unlimited number of offers of places.  Colleges had no idea how many students would arrive, and applicants had no central source of vacancy information.  Problems were eased by ad hoc co-operation between the colleges and their joint Committee of Principals, but it became clear that an administrative solution was needed.  The Training Colleges Clearing House was the result and was founded in 1933.  Under the new system a candidate was considered in turn by only one college at a time, from a list chosen by each applicant, with forwarding of the application ceasing when a place was offered.&lt;ref&gt;Association of Teachers in Colleges and Departments of Education (ATCDE), Handbook of Colleges and Departments of Education.  Published every two years from 1954 then annually from 1967 to 1992.  The edition cited is 1973, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1943 the Committee of Principals became the [[Association of Teachers in Colleges and Departments of Education (ATCDE)]].  By 1944 there were some 55 colleges and about 5000 applicants.  There was a large post-war expansion in numbers being trained as teachers.  From 1960 the Clearing House worked in close co-existence with the new [[Graduate Teacher Training Registry]].  In 1962 the newly renamed Central Register and Clearing House was set up as a limited company but was still supervised by the ATCDE and was based at their offices in Crawford Place, London W1.  By 1972 the scheme had 160 member colleges and 56000 applicants.

The CRCH was involved in discussions with both UCCA and the polytechnics as early as 1972 about the future shape of higher education admissions.&lt;ref&gt;Kay, Ronald, "UCCA: Its Origins and Development 1950-85, UCCA, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;  

CRCH handled applications to non-teaching degree courses as these began to be introduced at its member colleges. The CRCH ceased to function after the cycle leading to admissions in 1992 and its responsibilities passed on to [[UCAS]].  Its records are lodged in the Library at the University of Warwick.  Some had already been published in an earlier document.&lt;ref&gt;Sowerbutts, Beryl, Record of the Clearing House 1960-1984, published privately, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuous [[pulse|pulsation]] of the common iliac artery may trigger an [[inflammatory response]] within the common iliac vein.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1734">In [[computational complexity theory]] the '''compression theorem''' is an important theorem about the complexity of [[computable function]]s. 

The theorem states that there exists no largest [[complexity class]], with computable boundary, which contains all computable functions.

A '''curtain wall''' system is an outer covering of a building in which the outer walls are non-structural, utilized to keep the weather out and the occupants in.  Since the curtain wall is non-structural, it can be made of lightweight materials, thereby reducing construction costs.  When [[architectural glass|glass]] is used as the curtain wall, an advantage is that natural light can penetrate deeper within the building. The curtain wall [[façade]] does not carry any [[dead and live loads|structural load]] from the building other than its own dead load weight.  The wall transfers lateral [[wind engineering|wind loads]] that are incident upon it to the main building structure through connections at floors or columns of the building. A curtain wall is designed to resist air and water infiltration, absorb sway induced by wind and [[earthquake engineering|seismic]] forces acting on the building, withstand wind loads, and support its own dead load weight forces.

Curtain wall systems are typically designed with [[aluminum extrusion|extruded aluminum]] framing members, although the first curtain walls were made with steel frames. The aluminum frame is typically infilled with glass, which provides an architecturally pleasing building, as well as benefits such as [[daylighting]]. However, the effects of light on visual comfort as well as solar heat gain in a building are more difficult to control when using large amounts of glass infill. Other common infills include: stone veneer, metal panels, [[louver|louvres]], and operable windows or vents.

Curtain walls differ from storefront systems in that they are designed to span multiple floors, taking into consideration design requirements such as: thermal expansion and contraction; [[tuned mass damper|building sway]] and movement; water diversion; and thermal efficiency for cost-effective heating, cooling, and lighting in the building.

==History==
Buildings have long been constructed with the exterior walls of the building supporting the load of the entire structure. The development and widespread use of [[structural steel]] and later [[reinforced concrete]] allowed relatively small [[columns]] to support large loads; hence, exterior walls of buildings were no longer required for structural support. The exterior walls could be non-[[load-bearing wall|load bearing]] and thus much lighter and more open than the masonry load-bearing walls of the past.  This gave way to increased use of glass as an exterior façade, and the modern-day curtain wall was born.

Early prototype versions of curtain walls may have existed in buildings of timber construction before the 19th century, should columns have been used to support the building rather than the walls themselves, particularly when large panels of glass infill were involved. When iron began to be used extensively in buildings in late 18th-century Britain such as at [[Ditherington Flax Mill]], and later when buildings of wrought iron and glass such as [[The Crystal Palace]] were built, the building blocks of structural understanding were laid for the development of curtain walls.

[[Oriel Chambers]] (1864) and [[16 Cook Street]] (1866), both built in [[Liverpool]], [[England]], by local architect and [[civil engineer]] [[Peter Ellis (architect)|Peter Ellis]], are characterised by their extensive use of glass in their facades. Towards the courtyards they even boasted metal-framed glass curtain walls, which makes them two of the world's first buildings to include this architectural feature. The extensive glass walls allowed light to penetrate further into the building, utilizing more floor space and reducing lighting costs. Oriel Chambers comprises {{convert|43000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} set over five floors without an [[elevator]], which had only recently been invented and was not yet widespread.&lt;ref name="Oriel Chambers History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orielchambers.co.uk/#/411|title=History|publisher=Oriel Chambers|accessdate=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example of an all-steel curtain wall used in the classical style is the ''{{lang|de|Kaufhaus Tietz}}'' department store on ''{{lang|de|[[Leipziger Straße]]}}'', [[Berlin]], built in 1901 (since demolished).&lt;ref name="Tietz"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/8725928@N02/9416991555/|title=History|publisher= janwillemsen|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the first curtain walls were made with steel [[mullions]], and the [[polished plate glass]] was attached to the mullions with asbestos- or fiberglass-modified glazing compound. Eventually [[silicone]] [[sealant]]s or glazing tape were substituted for the glazing compound. Some designs included an outer cap to hold the glass in place and to protect the integrity of the seals. The first curtain wall installed in [[New York City]], in the [[United Nations Secretariat Building]] building (Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill, 1952), was this type of construction. Earlier [[modernist]] examples are the [[Bauhaus]] in [[Dessau]] (1926) and the [[Hallidie Building]] in [[San Francisco]] (1918).

During the 1970s, the widespread use of aluminium [[extrusion]]s for mullions began. [[Aluminum alloy]]s offer the unique advantage of being able to be easily extruded into nearly any shape required for design and aesthetic purposes. Today, the design complexity and shapes available are nearly limitless. Custom shapes can be designed and manufactured with relative ease. The [[Omni San Diego Hotel]] curtain wall in California (developed by JMI Realty, designed by architectural firm Hornberger and Worstel, is an example of a unitized curtain-wall system with integrated sunshades.&lt;ref&gt;Wausau Press Releases, [http://www.wausauwindow.com/resources/pressReleases/Wausau_CA_Omni.pdf "Omni San Diego Hotel offers breathtaking Bay views through Wausau’s curtainwall"], ''Wausau Press Releases'', Retrieved 2 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Systems and principles==
===Stick systems===
The vast majority of ground-floor curtain walls are installed as long pieces (referred to as ''sticks'') between floors vertically and between vertical members horizontally. Framing members may be fabricated in a shop, but installation and [[glazing in architecture|glazing]] is typically performed at the jobsite.

===Ladder systems===
Very similar to a stick system, a ladder system has mullions which can be split and then either snapped or screwed together consisting of a half box and plate. This allows sections of curtain wall to be fabricated in a shop, effectively reducing the time spent installing the system on site. The drawbacks of using such a system is reduced structural performance and visible joint lines down the length of each mullion.

===Unitized systems===
Unitized curtain walls entail factory fabrication and assembly of panels and may include factory glazing. These completed units are installed on the building structure to form the building enclosure.  Unitized curtain wall has the advantages of: speed; lower field installation costs; and [[quality control]] within an interior climate-controlled environment. The economic benefits are typically realized on large projects or in areas of high field labor rates.

===Rainscreen principle===
A common feature in curtain wall technology, the [[rainscreen]] principle theorizes that equilibrium of air pressure between the outside and inside of the "rainscreen" prevents water penetration into the building. For example, the glass is captured between an inner and an outer gasket in a space called the glazing rebate. The glazing rebate is ventilated to the exterior so that the pressure on the inner and outer sides of the exterior gasket is the same. When the pressure is equal across this gasket, water cannot be drawn through joints or defects in the gasket.

==Design concerns==
Curtain wall systems must be designed to handle all loads imposed on it as well as keep air and water from penetrating the building envelope.

===Loads===
{{main|Structural load}}
The loads imposed on the curtain wall are transferred to the building structure through the anchors which attach the mullions to the building.

;Dead load
''Dead load'' is defined as the weight of structural elements and the permanent features on the structure.&lt;ref&gt;2006 International Building Code, Section 1602.1&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of curtain walls, this load is made up of the weight of the mullions, anchors and other structural components of the curtain wall, as well as the weight of the infill material.  Additional dead loads imposed on the curtain wall may include sunshades or signage attached to the curtain wall.

;Wind load
''Wind load'' is a normal force acting on the building as the result of [[wind]] blowing on the building.&lt;ref&gt;"Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures," American Society of Civil Engineers, 2005; Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; Wind pressure is resisted by the curtain wall system since it envelops and protects the building.  Wind loads vary greatly throughout the world, with the largest wind loads being near the coast in [[hurricane]]-prone regions. For each project location, [[building code]]s specify the required design wind loads. Often, a [[wind tunnel]] study is performed on large or unusually-shaped buildings. A scale model of the building and the surrounding vicinity is built and placed in a wind tunnel to determine the wind pressures acting on the structure in question. These studies take into account [[vortex shedding]] around corners and the effects of surrounding topography and buildings.

;Seismic load
''Seismic loads'' in curtain wall system are limited to the interstory drift induced on the building during an earthquake. In most situations, the curtain wall is able to naturally withstand [[seismology|seismic]] and wind induced building sway because of the space provided between the glazing infill and the mullion. In tests, standard curtain wall systems are typically able to withstand up to three inches (75&amp;nbsp;mm) of relative floor movement without glass breakage or water leakage.

;Snow load
''Snow loads'' and [[dead and live loads|live loads]] are not typically an issue in curtain walls, since curtain walls are designed to be vertical or slightly inclined. If the slope of a wall exceeds 20 degrees or so, these loads may need to be considered.&lt;ref&gt;"Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures," American Society of Civil Engineers, 2005; Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;

;Thermal load
''Thermal loads'' are induced in a curtain wall system because aluminum has a relatively high [[coefficient of thermal expansion]]. This means that over the span of a couple of floors, the curtain wall will expand and contract some distance, relative to its length and the temperature differential. This expansion and contraction is accounted for by cutting horizontal mullions slightly short and allowing a space between the horizontal and vertical mullions.  In unitized curtain wall, a gap is left between units, which is sealed from air and water penetration by gaskets. Vertically, anchors carrying wind load only (not dead load) are slotted to account for movement.  Incidentally, this slot also accounts for live load deflection and [[Creep (deformation)|creep]] in the floor slabs of the building structure.

;Blast load
Accidental explosions and terrorist threats have brought on increased concern for the fragility of a curtain wall system in relation to blast loads. The bombing of the [[Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building]] in [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]], has spawned much of the current research and mandates in regards to building response to blast loads. Currently, all new federal buildings in the U.S. and all U.S. embassies built on foreign soil must have some provision for resistance to bomb blasts.&lt;ref&gt;"Design of Buildings to Resist Progressive Collapse," UFC 4-023-03, U.S. Department of Defense, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the curtain wall is at the exterior of the building, it becomes the first line of defense in a bomb attack. As such, blast resistant curtain walls are designed to withstand such forces without compromising the interior of the building to protect its occupants. Since blast loads are very high loads with short durations, the curtain wall response should be analyzed in a [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] load analysis, with full-scale [[mock-up]] testing performed prior to design completion and installation.

Blast resistant glazing consists of [[laminated glass]], which is meant to break but not separate from the mullions. Similar technology is used in [[hurricane]]-prone areas for impact protection from wind-borne debris.

===Air Infiltration===
''Air infiltration'' is the air which passes through the curtain wall from the exterior to the interior of the building. The air is infiltrated through the gaskets, through imperfect joinery between the horizontal and vertical [[mullions]], through [[weep hole]]s, and through imperfect sealing. The [[American Architectural Manufacturers Association]] (AAMA) is an industry trade group in the U.S. that has developed voluntary specifications regarding acceptable levels of air infiltration through a curtain wall.&lt;ref&gt;Testing is typically conducted by an independent third party agency using the ASTM E-783 standard.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water penetration===
''Water penetration'' is defined as water passing from the exterior of the building to the interior of the curtain wall system. Sometimes, depending on the building [[specifications]], a small amount of controlled water on the interior is deemed acceptable. Controlled water penetration is defined as water that penetrates beyond the inner most vertical plane of the test specimen, but has a designed means of drainage back to the exterior. AAMA Voluntary Specifications allow for controlled water penetration while the underlying ASTM E1105 test method would define such water penetration as a failure. To test the ability of a curtain wall to withstand water penetration in the field, an ASTM E1105 water spray rack system is placed on the exterior side of the test specimen, and a positive air pressure difference is applied to the system. This set up simulates a wind driven rain event on the curtain wall to check for field performance of the product and of the installation.  Field quality control and assurance checks for water penetration has become the norm as builders and installers apply such quality programs to help reduce the number of water damage litigation suits against their work.

===Deflection===
One of the disadvantages of using aluminum for mullions is that its [[modulus of elasticity]] is about one-third that of steel. This translates to three times more [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection]] in an aluminum mullion compared to a similar steel section under a given load. Building specifications set deflection limits for perpendicular (wind-induced) and in-plane (dead load-induced) deflections. These deflection limits are not imposed due to strength capacities of the mullions.  Rather, they are designed to limit deflection of the glass (which may break under excessive deflection), and to ensure that the glass does not come out of its pocket in the mullion. Deflection limits are also necessary to control movement at the interior of the curtain wall. Building construction may be such that there is a wall located near the mullion, and excessive deflection can cause the mullion to contact the wall and cause damage. Also, if deflection of a wall is quite noticeable, public perception may raise undue concern that the wall is not strong enough.

Deflection limits are typically expressed as the distance between anchor points divided by a constant number. A deflection limit of L/175 is common in curtain wall specifications, based on experience with deflection limits that are unlikely to cause damage to the glass held by the mullion. Say a given curtain wall is anchored at 12 foot (144&amp;nbsp;in) floor heights.  The allowable deflection would then be 144/175 = 0.823&amp;nbsp;inches, which means the wall is allowed to deflect inward or outward a maximum of 0.823&amp;nbsp;inches at the maximum wind pressure.  However, some panels require stricter movement restrictions, or certainly those that prohibit a torque-like motion.

Deflection in mullions is controlled by different shapes and depths of curtain wall members. The depth of a given curtain wall system is usually controlled by the [[second moment of area|area moment of inertia]] required to keep deflection limits under the specification. Another way to limit deflections in a given section is to add steel reinforcement to the inside tube of the mullion. Since steel deflects at one-third the rate of aluminum, the steel will resist much of the load at a lower cost or smaller depth.

===Strength===
Strength (or maximum usable [[Stress (physics)|stress]]) available to a particular material is not related to its material stiffness (the material property governing deflection); it is a separate criterion in curtain wall [[structural design|design]] and [[structural analysis|analysis]].  This often affects the selection of materials and sizes for design of the system.  The allowable bending strength for certain aluminum alloys, such as those typically used in curtain wall framing, approaches the allowable bending strength of steel alloys used in building construction.

===Thermal criteria===
Relative to other building components, aluminum has a high heat transfer coefficient, meaning that aluminum is a very good [[heat conduction|conductor]] of heat. This translates into high heat loss through aluminum curtain wall mullions.
There are several ways to compensate for this heat loss, the most common way being the addition of thermal breaks. ''[[Thermal break]]s'' are barriers between exterior metal and interior metal, usually made of [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC). These breaks provide a significant decrease in the [[thermal conductivity]] of the curtain wall. However, since the thermal break interrupts the aluminum mullion, the overall moment of inertia of the mullion is reduced and must be accounted for in the structural analysis and deflection analysis of the system.

Thermal conductivity of the curtain wall system is important because of heat loss through the wall, which affects the heating and cooling costs of the building. On a poorly performing curtain wall, [[condensation]] may form on the interior of the mullions. This could cause damage to adjacent interior trim and walls.

Rigid [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] is provided in [[spandrel]] areas to provide a higher [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]] at these locations.

==Infills==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}

''Infill'' refers to the large panels that are inserted into the curtain wall between mullions. Infills are typically glass but may be made up of nearly any exterior building element. Some common infills include metal panels, louvers, a [[photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] panels.

===Glass===
[[File:Serre cactees JdP.jpg|thumb|left|The Mexican [[greenhouse|hothouse]] at the [[Jardin des Plantes]], built by [[Charles Rohault de Fleury]] from 1834 to 1836, is an early example of metal and glass curtain wall architecture.]]
By far the most common glazing type, [[float glass|glass]] can be of an almost infinite combination of color, thickness, and [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]].
For commercial construction, the two most common thicknesses are 1/4&amp;nbsp;inch (6&amp;nbsp;mm) monolithic and 1&amp;nbsp;inch (25&amp;nbsp;mm) [[Insulated glazing|insulating glass]]. Presently, 1/4&amp;nbsp;inch glass is typically used only in [[spandrel]] areas, while insulating glass is used for the rest of the building (sometimes spandrel glass is specified as insulating glass as well). The 1&amp;nbsp;inch insulation glass is typically made up of two 1/4-inch lites of glass with a 1/2&amp;nbsp;inch (12&amp;nbsp;mm) airspace. The air inside is usually atmospheric air, but some [[inert gas]]es, such as [[argon]] or [[krypton]] may be used to offer better [[thermal transmittance]] values.

In residential construction, thicknesses commonly used are 1/8&amp;nbsp;inch (3&amp;nbsp;mm) monolithic and 5/8&amp;nbsp;inch (16&amp;nbsp;mm) insulating glass. Larger thicknesses are typically employed for buildings or areas with higher thermal, [[relative humidity]], or [[Acoustic transmission|sound transmission]] requirements, such as laboratory areas or [[recording studio]]s.

Glass may be used which is [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]], [[translucent]], or opaque, or in varying degrees thereof. ''Transparent'' glass usually refers to ''vision'' glass in a curtain wall. Spandrel or vision glass may also contain translucent glass, which could be for security or aesthetic purposes.  ''Opaque'' glass is used in areas to hide a column or spandrel beam or shear wall behind the curtain wall. Another method of hiding spandrel areas is through ''shadow box'' construction (providing a dark enclosed space behind the transparent or translucent glass). Shadow box construction creates a perception of depth behind the glass that is sometimes desired.

===Fabric veneer===
Fabric is another type of material which is common for curtain walls. Fabric is often much less expensive and serves as a less permanent solution. Unlike glass or stone, fabric is much faster to install, less expensive, and often much easier to modify after it is installed.
Because of low density of fabrics total weight of structure is very low then strength consideration of structure is not too important.

===Stone veneer===
Thin blocks (3 to 4&amp;nbsp;inches (75–100&amp;nbsp;mm)) of stone can be inset within a curtain wall system. The type of stone used is limited only by the strength of the stone and the ability to manufacture it in the proper shape and size. Common stone types used are: [[calcium silicate]], [[granite]], [[marble]], [[travertine]], and [[limestone]]. To reduce weight and improve strength, the natural stone may be attached to an aluminum honeycomb backing.

===Panels===
Metal panels can take various forms including aluminum plate; [[aluminum composite panels]] consisting of two thin aluminum sheets sandwiching a thin plastic interlayer; [[Copper in architecture#Wall cladding|copper wall cladding]], and panels consisting of metal sheets bonded to rigid insulation, with or without an inner metal sheet to create a sandwich panel. Other opaque panel materials include [[fiber-reinforced plastic]] (FRP), stainless steel, and [[terracotta]]. Terracotta curtain wall panels were first used in Europe, but only a few manufacturers produce high quality modern terracotta curtain wall panels.

===Louvers===
A [[louver]] is provided in an area where mechanical equipment located inside the building requires ventilation or fresh air to operate. They can also serve as a means of allowing outside air to filter into the building to take advantage of favorable climatic conditions and minimize the usage of energy-consuming [[HVAC]] systems. Curtain wall systems can be adapted to accept most types of louver systems to maintain the same architectural sightlines and style while providing the functionality.

===Windows and vents===
Most curtain wall glazing is fixed, meaning there is no access to the exterior of the building except through doors. However, windows or vents can be glazed into the curtain wall system as well, to provide required ventilation or operable windows. Nearly any window type can be made to fit into a curtain wall system.

==Fire safety==
[[File:Curtain wall backpan styrofoam.jpg|thumb|right|Combustible [[polystyrene]] insulation in point contact with [[sheet metal]] backban. Incomplete [[firestop]] in the [[Joint (building)|perimeter slab edge]], made of [[Mineral wool|rockwool]] without topcaulking.]]
[[Firestop]]ping at the ''[[Joint (building)|perimeter slab edge]]'', which is a gap between the floor and the curtain wall, is essential to slow the passage of fire and combustion gases between floors. Spandrel areas must have non-combustible insulation at the interior face of the curtain wall. Some building codes require the mullion to be wrapped in heat-retarding insulation near the ceiling to prevent the mullions from melting and spreading the fire to the floor above. The firestop at the perimeter slab edge is considered a continuation of the [[fire-resistance rating]] of the floor slab. The curtain wall itself, however, is not ordinarily required to have a rating. This causes a quandary as [[Compartmentalization (fire protection)]] is typically based upon ''closed'' compartments to avoid fire and smoke migrations beyond each engaged compartment. A curtain wall by its very nature prevents the completion of the compartment (or envelope). The use of fire sprinklers has been shown to mitigate this matter. As such, unless the building is [[fire sprinkler system|sprinklered]], fire may still travel up the curtain wall, if the glass on the exposed floor is shattered from heat, causing flames to lick up the outside of the building.

Falling glass can endanger pedestrians, firefighters and firehoses below. An example of this is the 1988 [[First Interstate Tower fire]] in [[Los Angeles, California]]. The fire leapfrogged up the tower by shattering the glass and then consuming the aluminum framing holding the glass.&lt;ref name="TechReport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lafire.com/famous_fires/880504_1stInterstateFire/FEMA-TecReport/FEMA-report.htm|title=Technical Report, Interstate Bank Building Fire|publisher=[[United States Fire Administration]]|accessdate=21 November 2009|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lafire.com%2Ffamous_fires%2F880504_1stInterstateFire%2FFEMA-TecReport%2FFEMA-report.htm&amp;date=2010-07-13 |archivedate=2010-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aluminum's melting temperature is 660&amp;nbsp;°C, whereas building fires can reach 1,100&amp;nbsp;°C. The melting point of aluminum is typically reached within minutes of the start of a fire.

Fireman knock-out glazing panels are often required for venting and emergency access from the exterior. Knock-out panels are generally fully [[Architectural Glass|tempered]] glass to allow full fracturing of the panel into small pieces and relatively safe removal from the opening.

==Maintenance and repair==
Curtain walls and perimeter sealants require maintenance to maximize service life. Perimeter sealants, properly designed and installed, have a typical service life of 10 to 15 years. Removal and replacement of perimeter sealants require meticulous surface preparation and proper detailing.

Aluminum frames are generally painted or [[anodising|anodized]]. Care must be taken when cleaning areas around anodized material as some cleaning agents will destroy the finish. Factory applied [[fluoropolymer]] thermoset coatings have good resistance to environmental degradation and require only periodic cleaning. Recoating with an air-dry fluoropolymer coating is possible but requires special surface preparation and is not as durable as the baked-on original coating. Anodized aluminum frames cannot be "re-anodized" in place but can be cleaned and protected by proprietary clear coatings to improve appearance and durability.

Stainless steel curtain walls require no coatings, and embossed, as opposed to abrasively finished, surfaces maintain their original appearance indefinitely without cleaning or other maintenance. Some specially textured matte stainless steel surface finishes are hydrophobic and resist airborne and rain-borne pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, Michael F., "Stainless Steel for Design Engineers", ASM International, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been valuable in the American Southwest and in the Mideast for avoiding dust, as well as avoiding soot and smoke staining in polluted urban areas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16380">'''Cyber-collection''' refers to the use of [[cyber-warfare]] techniques in order to conduct [[espionage]].  Cyber-collection activities typically rely on the insertion of [[malware]] into a targeted network or computer in order to scan for, collect and exfiltrate sensitive information.

Cyber-collection started as far back as 1996, when widespread deployment of [[Internet connectivity]] to government and corporate systems gained momentum.  Since that time, there have been numerous cases of such activity.&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;Pete Warren, ''[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/30/state-sponsored-cyber-espionage-prevalent State-sponsored cyber espionage projects now prevalent, say experts]'', The Guardian, August 30, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimesfin"&gt;Nicole Perlroth, ''[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/13/elusive-finspy-spyware-pops-up-in-10-countries/ Elusive FinSpy Spyware Pops Up in 10 Countries]'', New York Times, August 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AolTech"&gt;Kevin G. Coleman, ''[http://gov.aol.com/2012/07/02/has-stuxnet-duqu-and-flame-ignited-a-cyber-arms-race/ Has Stuxnet, Duqu and Flame Ignited a Cyber Arms Race?]'', AOL Government, July 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the state sponsored examples, cyber-collection has also been used by organized crime for identity and e-banking theft and by corporate spies.  [[Operation High Roller]] used cyber-collection agents in order to collect PC and smart-phone information that was used to electronically raid bank accounts.&lt;ref name="HighRoller"&gt;Rachael King, ''[https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2012/06/26/operation-high-roller-targets-corporate-bank-accounts/ Operation High Roller Targets Corporate Bank Accounts]'', June 26, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Rocra]], aka Red October, collection system is an "espionage for hire" operation by organized criminals who sell the collected information to the highest bidder.&lt;ref name="CrunchOctober"&gt;Frederic Lardinois, ''[https://techcrunch.com/2013/01/21/eugene-kaspersky-and-mikko-hypponen-talk-red-october-and-the-future-of-cyber-warfare-at-dld/ Eugene Kaspersky And Mikko Hypponen Talk Red October And The Future Of Cyber Warfare At DLD]'', TechCrunch, January 21, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SundayOctober"&gt;Mark Prigg, ''[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2263322/Operation-Red-October-revealed-The-astonishing-hacker-attack-infiltrated-55-000-high-level-government-computers.html The hunt for Red October: The astonishing hacking ring that has infiltrated over 1,000 high level government computers around the world]'', Daily Mail, January 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Platforms and functionality==
Cyber-collection tools have been developed by governments and private interests for nearly every computer and smart-phone operating system.  Tools are known to exist for Microsoft, Apple, and Linux computers and iPhone, Android, Blackberry, and Windows phones.&lt;ref name="BloomFinFisher"&gt;Vernon Silver, ''[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-29/spyware-matching-finfisher-can-take-over-iphone-and-blackberry.html Spyware Matching FinFisher Can Take Over IPhones]'',, Bloomberg, August 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Major manufacturers of [[Commercial off-the-shelf]] (COTS) cyber collection technology include Gamma Group from the UK&lt;ref name="finfisher"&gt;[http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120731073430/http://www.finfisher.com/FinFisher/en/index.php FinFisher IT Intrusion]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hacking Team]] from Italy.&lt;ref name="hackingteam"&gt;[http://www.hackingteam.it/index.php/remote-control-system Hacking Team, Remote Control System]&lt;/ref&gt; Bespoke cyber-collection tool companies, many offering COTS packages of [[Zero-day attack|zero-day]] exploits, include [[Endgame, Inc.]] and Netragard of the United States and Vupen from France.&lt;ref name="iw"&gt;Mathew J. Schwartz, ''[https://www.informationweek.com/security/attacks/weaponized-bugs-time-for-digital-arms-co/240008564 Weaponized Bugs: Time For Digital Arms Control]'', Information Week, 9 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  State intelligence agencies often have their own teams to develop cyber-collection tools, such as [[Stuxnet]], but require a constant source of ''zero-day exploits'' in order to insert their tools into newly targeted systems.  Specific technical details of these attack methods often sells for six figure sums.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;Ryan Gallagher, ''[http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2013/01/zero_day_exploits_should_the_hacker_gray_market_be_regulated.html Cyberwar’s Gray Market]'', Slate, 16 Jan 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Common functionality of cyber-collection systems include:
*''Data scan'': local and network storage are scanned to find and copy files of interest, these are often documents, spreadsheets, design files such as Autocad files and system files such as the passwd file.
*''Capture location'': GPS, WiFi, network information and other attached sensors are used to determine the location and movement of the infiltrated device
*''[[Covert listening device|Bug]]'': the device microphone can be activated in order to record audio.  Likewise, audio streams intended for the local speakers can be intercepted at the device level and recorded.
* ''Hidden Private Networks'' that bypass the corporate network security.  A compute that is being spied upon can be plugged into a legitimate corporate network that is heavy monitored for malware activity and at same time belongs to a private wifi network outside of the company network that is leaking confidential information off of an employee's computer.  A computer like this is easily set up by a double-agent working in the IT department by install a second Wireless card in a computer and special software to remotely monitor an employee's computer through this second interface card without them being aware of a side-band communication channel pulling information off of his computer.
*''Camera'': the device cameras can be activated in order to covertly capture images or video.   
*''[[Keylogger]] and Mouse Logger'': the malware agent can capture each keystroke, mouse movement and click that the target user makes.  Combined with screen grabs, this can be used to obtain passwords that are entered using a virtual on-screen keyboard.
*''Screen Grabber'': the malware agent can take periodic screen capture images.  In addition to showing sensitive information that may not be stored on the machine, such as e-banking balances and encrypted web mail, these can be used in combination with the key and mouse logger data to determine access credentials for other Internet resources. 
*''Encryption'': Collected data is usually encrypted at the time of capture and may be transmitted live or stored for later exfiltration.  Likewise, it is common practice for each specific operation to use specific encryption and poly-morphic capabilities of the cyber-collection agent in order to ensure that detection in one location will not compromise others.
*''Bypass Encryption'': Because the malware agent operates on the target system with all the access and rights of the user account of the target or system administrator, encryption is bypassed.  For example, interception of audio using the microphone and audio output devices enables the malware to capture to both sides of an encrypted Skype call.&lt;ref name="Milan"&gt;Daniele Milan, [http://www.comm.rtaf.mi.th/Sitedirectory/124/3148/3148_2_6-Daniele-Milan.pdf The Data Encryption Problem], Hacking Team&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Exfiltration'': Cyber-collection agents usually exfiltrate the captured data in a discrete manner, often waiting for high web traffic and disguising the transmission as secure web browsing.  [[USB flash drive]]s have been used to exfiltrate information from [[Air gap (networking)|air gap]] protected systems.  Exfiltration systems often involve the use of reverse proxy systems that anonymize the receiver of the data.&lt;ref name="FlameUSB"&gt;Robert Lemos, ''[https://www.infoworld.com/t/malware/flame-stashes-secrets-in-usb-drives-195455 Flame stashes secrets in USB drives]'', InfoWorld, June 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Replicate'': Agents may replicate themselves onto other media or systems, for example an agent may infect files on a writable network share or install themselves onto USB drives in order to infect computers protected by an [[Air gap (networking)|air gap]] or otherwise not on the same network.
*''Manipulate Files and File Maintenance'': Malware can be used to erase traces of itself from log files.  It can also download and install modules or updates as well as data files.  This function may also be used to place "evidence" on the target system, e.g. to insert child pornography onto the computer of a politician or to manipulate votes on an electronic vote counting machine.
*''Combination Rules'': Some agents are very complex and are able to combine the above features in order to provide very targeted intelligence collection capabilities.  For example, the use of GPS bounding boxes and microphone activity can be used to turn a smart phone into a smart bug that intercepts conversations only within the office of a target.
*''Compromised cellphones''. Since, modern cellphones are increasingly similar to general purpose computer, these cellphones are vulnerable to the same cyber-collect attacks as computer systems, and are vulnerable to leak extremely sensitive conversational and location information to an attackers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elgj2ZFMZDE how to spy on a cell phone without having access]&lt;/ref&gt;  Leaking of cellphone GPS location and conversational information to an attacker has been reported in a number of recent [[cyber stalking]] cases where the attacker was able to use the victim's GPS location to call nearby businesses and police authorities to make false allegations against the victim depending on his location, this can range from telling the restaurant staff information to tease the victim, or making false witness against the victim.  For instance if the victim were parked in large parking lot the attackers may call and state that they saw drug or violence activity going on with a description of the victim and directions to their GPS location.

==Infiltration==
There are several common ways to infect or access the target:
*An ''[[Injection Proxy]]'' is a system that is placed upstream from the target individual or company, usually at the Internet service provider, that injects malware into the targets system.  For example, an innocent download made by the user can be injected with the malware executable on the fly so that the target system then is accessible to the government agents.&lt;ref name="Gloor"&gt;Pascal Gloor, ''[http://www.swinog.ch/meetings/swinog25/p/02_(Un)Lawful%20Intercept%202012-11-07%20SwiNOG25.pdf (Un)lawful Interception] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205065155/http://www.swinog.ch/meetings/swinog25/p/02_%28Un%29Lawful%20Intercept%202012-11-07%20SwiNOG25.pdf |date=2016-02-05 }}'', SwiNOG #25, 07 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Phishing|Spear Phishing]]'': A carefully crafted e-mail is sent to the target in order to entice them to install the malware via a [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan]] document or a [[Drive-by download|drive by attack]] hosted on a web server compromised or controlled by the malware owner.&lt;ref name="SpearTechWeb"&gt;Mathew J. Schwartz, ''[https://www.informationweek.com/security/attacks/operation-red-october-attackers-wielded/240146621 Operation Red October Attackers Wielded Spear Phishing]'', Information Week, January 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Black bag operation|Surreptitious Entry]]'' may be used to infect a system.  In other words, the spies carefully break into the target's residence or office and install the malware on the target's system.&lt;ref name="blackbagfbi"&gt;FBI Records: The Vault, ''[http://vault.fbi.gov/Surreptitious%20Entries%20%28Black%20Bag%20Jobs%29%20/ Surreptitious Entries]'', Federal Bureau of Investigation&lt;/ref&gt;
*An ''Upstream monitor'' or ''[[Packet analyzer|sniffer]]'' is a device that can intercept and view the data transmitted by a target system.  Usually this device is placed at the Internet service provider.  The [[Carnivore (software)|Carnivore]] system developed by the U.S. [[FBI]] is a famous example of this type of system.  Based on the same logic as a [[Lawful Interception|telephone intercept]], this type of system is of limited use today due to the widespread use of encryption during data transmission.  
*A ''wireless infiltration'' system can be used in proximity of the target when the target is using wireless technology.  This is usually a laptop based system that impersonates a WiFi or 3G base station to capture the target systems and relay requests upstream to the Internet. Once the target systems are on the  network, the system then functions as an ''Injection Proxy'' or as an ''Upstream Monitor'' in order to infiltrate or monitor the target system.
*A ''[[USB flash drive|USB Key]]'' preloaded with the malware infector may be given to or dropped at the target site.

Cyber-collection agents are usually installed by payload delivery software constructed using [[0-day attack|zero-day]] attacks and delivered via infected USB drives, e-mail attachments or malicious web sites.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Zetter, ''[http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/29/tech/web/iran-spyware-flame/index.html "Flame" spyware infiltrating Iranian computers]'', CNN - Wired, May 30, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DutchUSB"&gt;Anne Belle de Bruijn, ''[http://www.elsevier.nl/Tech/nieuws/2012/7/Cybercriminelen-doen-poging-tot-spionage-bij-DSM-ELSEVIER343610W/ Cybercriminelen doen poging tot spionage bij DSM]'', Elsevier, July 9, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  State sponsored cyber-collections efforts have used official operating system certificates in place of relying on security vulnerabilities.  In the Flame operation, [[Microsoft]] states that the Microsoft certificate used to impersonate a [[Windows Update]] was forged;&lt;ref name="MSCertForged"&gt;Mike Lennon, ''[https://www.securityweek.com/microsoft-unauthorized-certificate-was-used-sign-flame-malware Microsoft Certificate Was Used to Sign "Flame" Malware] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307131239/http://www.securityweek.com/microsoft-unauthorized-certificate-was-used-sign-flame-malware |date=2013-03-07 }}'', June 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; however, some experts believe that it may have been acquired through [[HUMINT]] efforts.&lt;ref name="MSCertStolen"&gt;Paul Wagenseil, ''[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/47675971/ns/technology_and_science-security/t/flame-malware-uses-stolen-microsoft-digital-signature/ Flame Malware Uses Stolen Microsoft Digital Signature]'', NBC News, June 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

An early life stage (ELS) test is a chronic toxicity test using sensitive early life stages like embryos or larvae to predict the effects of toxicants on organisms.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985"&gt;McKim JM. 1985. Early life stage toxicity tests. In Rand GM (1995). Fundamentals of Aquatic Toxicology: Effects, Environmental Fate, and Risk Assessment (2nd ed.). Boca Raton: CRC Press. pp 974–1010. {{ISBN|1-56032-091-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ELS tests were developed to be quicker and more cost-efficient than full life-cycle tests, taking on average 1–5 months to complete compared to 6–12 months for a life-cycle test. They are commonly used in [[aquatic toxicology]], particularly with fish. Growth and survival are the typically measured endpoints, for which a [[Maximum Acceptable Toxicant Concentration]] (MATC) can be estimated. ELS tests allow for the testing of fish species that otherwise could not be studied due to length of life, spawning requirements, or size. ELS tests are used as part of environmental risk assessments by regulatory agencies including the [[EPA|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and [[Environment Canada]], as well as the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD).&lt;ref name="EPAEEC"&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/oppefed1/ecorisk_ders/toera_analysis_eco.htm Technical Overview of Ecological Risk Assessment Analysis Phase: Ecological Effects Characterization.] US EPA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OECDFELS"&gt;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. 1992. Guideline 210: Fish early-life stage toxicity test. ''OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals''. Paris, France.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
ELS tests were adapted from full life-cycle toxicity tests, chronic tests that expose an organism to a contaminant for its entire life-cycle.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt; These are widely considered to be the best tests for estimating long-term "safe" concentrations of toxicants in aquatic organisms.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt; The first full life-cycle tests on fish were developed for the [[fathead minnow]] (''Pimephales promelas''),&lt;ref name="Mount Stephan"&gt;Mount DI, Stephan CE. 1967. A method for establishing acceptable limits for fish-Malathion and the butoxyethanol ester of 2,4-D. ''Trans Am Fish Soc'' 96:185-193.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benoit DA, Puglisi FA, Olson DL. 1982. A fathead minnow (''Pimephales promelas'') early life stage toxicity test method evaluation and exposure to four organic chemicals. ''Environ Pollution Series A, Ecological and Biological'' 28:189-197.&lt;/ref&gt; and later for [[bluegill]] (''Lepomis macrochirus''), [[brook trout]] (''Salvelinus fontinalis''), [[flagfish]] (''Jordanella floridae''), and [[sheepshead minnow]] (''Cyprinodon variegatus'').&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hansen DJ, Parrish PR, Schimmel SC, Goodman LR. 1978. Life-cycle toxicity test using sheepshead minnows (''Cyprinodon variegatus''). ''Bioassay Procedures for the Ocean Disposal Permit Program'', EPA-600/9-78-010.&lt;/ref&gt; While useful, full life-cycle tests require a high number of test organisms and extensive exposure time in the lab, especially for vertebrates.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt; Typically, life-cycle tests take 6–12 months for [[fathead minnow]] and 30 months for [[brook trout]].

Following the passage of the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] (TSCA) in the [[United States]] in 1976, there was an increased need for quicker, more efficient vertebrate toxicity tests.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt; The [[EPA]] was now required to assess the environmental effects of new chemicals before they could be commercially produced. Less costly and time-intensive tests were needed to evaluate a multitude of new chemicals. Researchers began developing toxicity tests that focused on early life stages, since these have been shown to be more sensitive to environmental stressors than later life stages.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt; Many critical events occur in a short period of time in the early stages of development.&lt;ref name="McKim 1977"&gt;McKim JM. 1977. Evaluation of tests with early life stages of fish for predicting long-term toxicity. ''J Fish Res Board Can'' 34:1148–1154.&lt;/ref&gt; If a stressor disrupts developmental events (including their timing), it could result in adverse effects that reduce the organism's chances of survival. Meta-analysis has found that early life-cycle portions of full life-cycle tests usually estimate an [[Maximum Acceptable Toxicant Concentration|MATC]] within a factor of 2 of full life-cycle estimates in saltwater and freshwater fish.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McKim 1977" /&gt; In 83% of 72 tests, the ELS portion resulted in the same [[Maximum Acceptable Toxicant Concentration|MATC]] as the full life-cycle estimate, and the remaining 17% were within a factor of 2.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt;

==Limitations==
There remain some limitations with early life stage toxicity testing. Although ELS tests are quicker and more cost-efficient than full life cycle tests, they remain resource- and time-intensive. Fish early life stage (FELS) tests require hundreds of fish and 1 to 5 months to complete.&lt;ref name="villeneuve"&gt;Villeneuve D, Volz DC, Embry MR, Ankley GT, Belanger SE, Léonard M, Schirmer K, Tanguay R, Truong L, Wehmas L. 2014. Investigating alternatives to the fish early-life stage test: a strategy for discovering and annotating adverse outcome pathways for early fish development. ''Environ Toxicol Chem'' 33:158-69.&lt;/ref&gt; Other issues include the lack of mechanistic information, differing sensitivities between species, and insensitivity to parental exposure. ELS tests don't provide information on the toxicant's [[mechanism of action]]. Sensitivity to specific toxicants varies with species, so the most sensitive or most important species should be tested in each case.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt; ELS tests appear to be insensitive to parental exposure, and [[Maximum Acceptable Toxicant Concentration|MATCs]] are generally the same for embryos of both exposed and unexposed parents. This could be due to the [[mode of action]] of the toxicant or the variability and insensitivity of ELS test design.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt; Additionally, growth response has been found to be an insensitive endpoint in ELS tests with fish, having little bearing on the estimation of an [[Maximum Acceptable Toxicant Concentration|MATC]].&lt;ref&gt;Woltering DM. 1984. The growth response in fish chronic and early life stage toxicity tests: A critical review. ''Aquat Toxicol'' 5:1–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Growth response could be omitted to reduce the duration and cost of screening tests.

==Methodology==
In a typical early life stage toxicity test, a flow-through dilutor system administers different concentrations of a toxicant to different test chambers.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt; At least five different concentrations of a toxicant are tested, plus controls, with at least two exposure chambers for each treatment. The length of the exposure depends on the test species. For example, [[fathead minnow]] tests are 1–2 months long, while [[brook trout]] tests are around 5 months long. Growth and survival are the typical endpoints, for which an [[Maximum Acceptable Toxicant Concentration|MATC]] can be found.

Standard methods for ELS tests have been established by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]],&lt;ref name="OECDFELS" /&gt; [[ASTM International]],&lt;ref&gt;ASTM International.

==Current developments==
An extended ELS test has been examined as a potential surrogate for a fish full life-cycle test to detect weak environmental estrogens.&lt;ref name="panter"&gt;Panter GH, Hutchinson TH, Hurd KS, Bamforth J, Stanley RD, Duffell S, Hargreaves A, Gimeno S, Tyler CR. 2006.

An extended fish early-life stage test for oestrogenic active chemicals in the fathead minnow (''Pimephales promelas'') ''Aquat Toxicol'' 77:279-290.&lt;/ref&gt; Endocrine active chemicals (EACs) are ubiquitous in the environment, prompting the need for better screening assays to predict their effects, especially in aquatic species. Slightly longer ELS tests could be used instead of full life-cycle tests, taking into account sensitive windows of exposure like sexual differentiation and early gonadal development. Extended ELS tests have proven successful in detecting the effects of weak estrogens in [[fathead minnow]]s.&lt;ref name="panter" /&gt;

Additionally, adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) are being used to develop an alternative to FELS testing.&lt;ref name="villeneuve" /&gt; Industry and regulatory agencies are increasingly interested in an animal-free, cost-efficient surrogate.&lt;ref&gt;Knapen D, Vergauwen L, Verstraelen S, Dardenne F, Witters H, Blust R, Villeneuve DL, Ankley GT. 2013.

''Toxicology Letters'' 221: S104.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers are developing FELS-related AOPs to create a high-throughput, less costly screening strategy for toxicants that takes the [[mechanism of action]] into account.&lt;ref name="villeneuve" /&gt;

The economics of [[information security]] addresses the economic aspects of [[privacy]] and [[computer security]]. Economics of information security includes models of the strictly rational “[[homo economicus]]” as well as [[behavioral economics]]. '''Economics of security''' addresses individual and organizational decisions and behaviors with respect to security and privacy as market decisions.

Economics of security addresses a core question: why do agents choose technical risks when there exists technical solutions to mitigate security and privacy risks?  Economics addresses not only this question, but also inform design decisions in [[security engineering]].

== Emergence of economics of security ==
[[National security]] is the canonical [[public good]]. The economic status of information security came to the intellectual fore around 2000. As is the case with innovations it arose simultaneously in multiple venues.

In 2000, [[Ross J. Anderson|Ross Anderson]] wrote, [http://www.acsac.org/2001/papers/110.pdf Why Information Security is Hard].  Anderson explained that a significant difficulty in optimal development of security technology is that incentives must be aligned with the technology to enable rational adoption. Thus, economic insights should be integrated into technical design. A security technology should enable the party at risk to invest to limit that risk. Otherwise, the designers are simply counting on [[altruism]] for adoption and diffusion. Many consider this publication the birth of economics of security.

Also in 2000 at Harvard, Camp at the School of Government and Wolfram in the Department of Economics argued that security is not a [[public good]] but rather each extant vulnerabilities has an associated negative [[externality]] value.  Vulnerabilities were defined in this work as tradable goods.  Six years later, [http://idefense.com/ iDEFENSE], [http://zerodayinitiative.com/  ZDI] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20071125104648/http://www.mozilla.org/security/bug-bounty.html Mozilla] have extant markets for vulnerabilities.

In 2000, the scientists at the Computer Emergency Response Team at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] proposed an early mechanism for risk assessment. The Hierarchical Holographic Model provided the first multi-faceted evaluation tool to guide security investments using the science of risk. Since that time, CERT has developed a suite of systematic mechanism for organizations to use in risk evaluations, depending on the size and expertise of the organization: [http://www.cert.org/octave OCTAVE]. The study of computer security as an investment in risk avoidance has become standard practice.

In 2001, in an unrelated development, [[Lawrence A. Gordon]] and [http://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/faculty/mloeb/ Martin P. Loeb] published [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=383709 Using information security as a response to competitor analysis systems]. A working paper of the published article was written in 2000. These professors, from Maryland's Smith School of Business, present a game-theoretic framework that demonstrates how information security can prevent rival firms from gaining sensitive information. In this context, the article considers the economic (i.e., cost-benefit) aspects of information security. 

The authors came together to develop and expand a series of flagship events under the name Workshop on the Economics of Information Security.

== Examples of findings in economics of security ==
Proof of work is a security technology designed to stop spam by altering the economics. An early paper in economics of information security argued that [[proof of work]] cannot work. In fact, the finding was that [[proof of work]] cannot work without [[price discrimination]] as illustrated by a later paper, [http://weis2006.econinfosec.org/docs/50.pdf Proof of Work can Work].

Another finding, one that is critical to an understanding of current American data practices, is that the opposite of [[privacy]] is not, in economic terms [[anonymity]], but rather [[price discrimination]]. [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.4.9746&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Privacy and price discrimination] was authored by [[Andrew Odlyzko]] and illustrates that what may appear as information pathology in collection of data is in fact rational organizational behavior.

[[Hal Varian]] presented three models of security using the metaphor of the height of walls around a town to show security as a normal good, public good, or good with externalities. [http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/resources/affiliates/workshops/econsecurity/econws/49.pdf Free riding] is the end result, in any case.

[[Lawrence A. Gordon]] and [http://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/faculty/mloeb/ Martin P. Loeb] wrote the [http://ns2.virusflags.dc.hu/~mfelegyhazi/courses/EconSec/readings/04_GordonL02economics_security_investment.pdf Economics of Information Security Investment]. The [[Gordon-Loeb Model]] is considered by many as the first economic model that determines the optimal amount to invest to protect a given set of information. The model takes into account the vulnerability of the information to a security breach and the potential loss should such a breach occur.

'''Freeset''' is a group of social enterprises focused on creating positive employment opportunities for women affected by [[sex trafficking]] in West Bengal, India. Freeset Bags &amp; Apparel manufactures bags and T-shirts, Freeset Fabrics is a weaving business and Freeset Business Incubator is focused on facilitating the establishment of new freedom businesses.

'''Freeset Bags &amp; Apparel''' is a [[fair trade]] freedom business offering employment to approximately 200 women who were trapped in [[Kolkata]]'s sex trade. Founded by Kerry and Annie Hilton in 2001, Freeset offers women of the [[Sonagacchi]] red-light district of Kolkata the opportunity to leave a profession they never chose.

Making [[jute]] and cotton bags as well as [[organic cotton]] T-shirts, the women of Freeset are empowered to choose a life free from prostitution. All profits from the business are used for the benefit of the women.

When they first start at Freeset, many women struggle to sew or even do simple tasks. It is not uncommon for new trainees to produce bags sewn inside out and upside down. The trauma they have experienced in their lives often makes learning difficult so they easily forget what they have learned.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/voices/20150720&lt;/ref&gt;

The jobs offered by Freeset allow women to experience financial independence and gain better access to both health care and educational opportunities for their children.

Freeset also employs a handful of men.

'''Freeset Business Incubator''' was created in 2011 to expand on the opportunities offered by Freeset Bags &amp; Apparel. This takes the form of nurturing new freedom businesses, providing capacity and expertise to existing freedom businesses and recruiting people to join or start these social businesses focused on freedom. The Freedom Encounter is a 3-week starter course offered by the Incubator to introduce participants to the idea of freedom business and to expose them to the realities and possibilities of running a freedom business.

Freeset Fabrics was the first freedom business begun under the guidance of the Incubator.

'''Freeset Fabrics''' is the first Freeset freedom business to be established in a rural context. It is strategically located in the [[Murshidabad district]] of West Bengal in an impoverished area known to be a source of young women trafficked for sex. The idea behind locating the business in this area is to provide economic opportunities for women who would otherwise be vulnerable to trafficking, thereby reducing their risk of being trafficked.

[[Weaving]] is a traditional skill among the people of the area and this influenced the decision to start a weaving business with an initial focus on making scarves. Training started in late 2014 and the first scarves came off the production line, mid 2015.

== Cinema ==

===Features===
Gross-out is a [[genre|subgenre]] of comedy movies in which the makers employ humor that is willfully "tasteless"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pryor]|first=Joe Garner ; foreword by Richard|title=Made you laugh! : the funniest moments in radio, television, stand-up, and movie comedy|year=2004|publisher=Andrews McMeel Pub.|location=Kansas City|isbn=0-7407-4695-2|pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or even downright disgusting. It usually involves gratuitous nudity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Capsuto|first=Steven|title=Alternate channels : the uncensored story of gay and lesbian images on radio and television|year=2000|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-345-41243-5|pages=250|edition=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; unrealistic aggressiveness towards property or [[Schadenfreude]]. The movies are generally aimed at a younger audience aged between 18 and 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Geoff|title=Film comedy|year=2002|publisher=Wallflower|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=1-903364-35-3|pages=73|edition=repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One boon of this genre is that it provides an inexpensive way to make a movie "edgy" and to generate media attention for it.

===History===
In the United States, following the abolition of the film industry's censorious [[Production Code]] and its replacement with the [[MPAA film rating system]] in the late 1960s, some filmmakers began to experiment with subversive&lt;ref name= "Mitchell03"&gt;{{cite news | last = Mitchell | first = Elvis | authorlink = Elvis Mitchell | title = Revisiting Faber College (Toga, Toga, Toga!) | work = [[The New York Times]] | pages =  | language = | publisher = | date=25 August 2003 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/25/movies/critic-s-notebook-revisiting-faber-college-toga-toga-toga.html | accessdate = 2011-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; film comedies, which explicitly dealt with taboo subjects such as sex and other bodily functions.  Noteworthy examples include 1972's ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'' (in which the central character eats dog excrement) and other films by [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]], and 1974's sketch comedy film ''[[The Groove Tube]]''. As these films emerged from the [[counterculture]] movement and gained a measure of audience success,&lt;ref name="Mitchell03"/&gt; they inspired more mainstream films to follow their example. However, long before the Production Code, early silent comedy film makers produced and attempted several 'gross-out' pictures to the disdain of early film reviewers. One such example is the [[lost film|lost]] ''[[Nell's Eugenic Wedding]]'' starring [[Fay Tincher]] and [[Tod Browning]].

The label "gross-out movie" was first applied by the mainstream media to [[1978 in film|1978]]'s ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'s [[Animal House]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bernheimer|first=Kathryn|title=The 50 funniest movies of all time : a critic's ranking|year=1999|publisher=Carol Pub. Group|location=Secaucus, N.J.|isbn=0-8065-2091-4|pages=109–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; a comedy about the [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] experience at [[Higher education in the United States|US colleges]].&lt;ref name="Mitchell03"/&gt; Its humor included not only explicit use of bodily functions (like projectile vomiting), but also references to topical political matters like [[Kent State shootings]], [[Richard Nixon]], the [[Vietnam war]], and the [[Civil rights movement#Civil rights movement in the United States|civil rights movement]].&lt;ref name= "Peterson"&gt;{{cite news | last = Peterson | first = Molly | title = ''National Lampoon's Animal House'' | work = [[National Public Radio]] | date = July 29, 2002 | url = https://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/patc/animalhouse/ | accessdate = 2010-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was a great [[box office]] success despite its limited production costs and thus started an industry trend.&lt;ref name="Mitchell03"/&gt; Since then, gross-out films increased in number, and became almost the norm for American comedy films. Some films of this genre could be aimed at teen audiences (such as ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]'', ''[[Porky's]]'', ''[[American Pie (series)|American Pie]]'' or ''[[Eurotrip]]''), while others are targeted at somewhat more mature audiences (such as ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'', ''[[The Hangover (film)|The Hangover]]'' or ''[[Wedding Crashers]]'').

== Television ==
{{advert|date=June 2012}}

''The Tom Green Show and [[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]'' and its UK cousin, ''[[Dirty Sanchez (television series)|Dirty Sanchez]]'', were the pioneers of "gross out television".  The shows featured dangerous [[stunts]], [[nudity]], [[profanity]], and action new to the television platform. Both series were featured on [[MTV]], and progressed to feature-length movies.  ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'', ''[[The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show]]'', [[Rugrats]], [[Rocko's Modern Life]],  [[Aaahh!!! Real Monsters]], and ''[[Animaniacs]]'' transferred the gross-out television genre to the medium of small screen [[animation]] largely in the early 1990s. Today this continues with such shows as ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Futurama]]'', ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', [[Regular Show]], [[American Dad!]] and ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''.

== Theater ==

Gross-out [[theater]] is increasingly practiced on stage, particularly in the [[Edinburgh Festival]]. However, it is also displayed in the larger and more adventurous [[United Kingdom|British]] theaters.

The prime examples of the above are the stage version of the contemporary drama ''[[Trainspotting (novel)#Stage adaptation|Trainspotting]]'' by bestselling playwright and author [[Irvine Welsh]]; the controversial New York musical ''[[Urinetown]]'' by Kotis and Hollmann; the outrageous [[anarchistic]] schlockomedy (shock horror comedy) musical about a Manchester jobcentre ''Restart'' by Komedy Kollective;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.komedykollective.com komedykollective.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and performances by another United Kingdom-based act, Forced Entertainment, who devised the [[iconic]] theatrical [[gorefest]] ''Bloody Mess''.

== Art ==

Controversial American cartoonist and vaudeville performer [[Basil Wolverton]] invented his trademark "[[spaghetti]] and [[meatball]]s" style of artwork.

Various artists helped create a flourishing gross-out art scene, which began mainly in the 1990s, the most famous of which were [[Damien Hirst]], known for encasing mutilated, rotting [[cattle]] in [[formaldehyde]], and making art of [[endangered]] [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[species]] such as [[shark]]s in formaldehyde tanks, and [[Tracey Emin]], whose [[Art exhibition|exhibit]] of an unmade [[bed]] featured used [[tampons]], [[condoms]] and blood-stained [[underwear]].

== Music ==

Gross out themes are common in popular music genres, such as [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[hard rock]], where shock value helps create marketable notoriety.  Bands include [[Blink-182]] famous for including [[breast]] and [[fart]] jokes in their songs, while bands such as [[Cannibal Corpse]] and [[Agoraphobic Nosebleed]] write extremely revolting lyrics designed to induce nausea and shock the music world.

Probably the biggest gross-out shock to the music world was the act of [[GG Allin]]. Allin was infamous for his transgressive music act, which included eating excrement, mutilating himself and attacking audience members.

Sometimes the line between truth and [[urban myth]] is blurred by the [[sensationalist]] sections of the media.  For example, [[Frank Zappa]] never ate steaming excrement live on-stage, and the famed incident involving [[Ozzy Osbourne]] biting a head off of a bat was actually unintentional (he thought the bat was a prop).

Similar themes are also sometimes conveyed in music videos, the aptly named Gross Out, a [[Single (music)|single]] from [[indie (music)|indie]]/[[garage rock]] band, [[The Vines (band)|The Vines]].

[[File:Regular_hexagon_as_intersection_of_two_triangles.png|thumb|A regular ''hexagram'', [[List_of_regular_polytopes_and_compounds#Two_dimensional_compounds|{6}[2{3}]{6}]], can be seen as a [[compound polygon|compound]] composed of an upwards (blue here) and downwards (pink) facing [[equilateral triangle]], with their intersection as a regular [[hexagon]] (in green).]]
A '''hexagram''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]) or '''sexagram''' ([[Latin language|Latin]]) is a six-pointed geometric [[star figure]] with the [[Schläfli symbol]] {6/2}, 2{3}, or &lt;nowiki&gt;{{3}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Since there are no true regular continuous hexagrams, the term is instead used to refer to the compound figure of two [[equilateral triangle]]s shown to the right. The intersection is a regular [[hexagon]].

The hexagram is part of an infinite series of shapes which are compounds of two n-dimensional [[simplex|simplices]]. In three dimensions, [[Compound of two tetrahedra|the analogous compound]] is the [[stellated octahedron]], and in four dimensions the [[compound of two 5-cells]] is obtained.

It has been historically used in religious and cultural contexts and as decorative motifs; for example by medieval [[Muslims]], especially [[Hanafi]] and [[Maliki]] dynasties,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Delhi: Adventures in a Megacity]]'' (PB) - Page 91, Sam Miller, Sam - 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and later in [[Judaism]] and [[occultism]]. The symbol was used merely as a decorative motif in medieval Christian churches many centuries before its first known use in a Jewish synagogue.{{sfn|Scholem|1949|p=244|ps=:"It is not to be found at all in medieval synagogues or on medieval ceremonial objects, although it has been found in quite a number of medieval Christian churches again, not as a Christian symbol but only as a decorative motif. The appearance of the symbol in Christian churches long before its appearance in our synagogues should warn the overzealous interpreters. "}} It was first used as a religious symbol by Arabs in the medieval period, known as the [[Seal of Solomon]], depicted as either a hexagram or [[pentagram]], and which was later adopted by Jewish [[Kabbalists]].{{sfn|Scholem|1949|p=246|ps=:"In the beginning these designs had no special names or terms, and it is only in the Middle Ages that definite names began to be given to some of those most widely used. There is very little doubt that terms like these first became popular among the Arabs, who showed a tremendous interest in all the occult sciences, arranging and ordering them systematically long before the Practical Cabalists thought of doing so.{{pb}}It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that for a long time both the five-pointed and the six-pointed stars were called by one name, the "Seal of Solomon," and that no distinction was made between them. This name is obviously related to the Jewish legend of Solomon's dominion over the spirits, and of his ring with the Ineffable Name engraved on it. These legends expanded and proliferated in a marked fashion during the Middle Ages, among Jews and Arabs alike, but the name, "Seal of Solomon," apparently originated with the Arabs."}}&lt;ref&gt;Leonora Leet, "The Hexagram and Hebraic Sacred Science" in :''The Secret Doctrine of the Kabbalah'', 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=61hpoogearsC&amp;pg=PA212 pp. 212-217].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Group theory==
In [[mathematics]], the [[root system]] for the simple [[Lie group]] [[G2 (mathematics)|G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] is in the form of a hexagram, with six long roots and six short roots.&lt;br/&gt;
[[File:Root system G2.svg|250px]]

== Construction by compass and a straight edge ==
A six-pointed star, like a [[regular hexagon]], can be created using a compass and a straight edge:
*Make a circle of any size with the compass.
*Without changing the radius of the compass, set its pivot on the circle's circumference, and find one of the two points where a new circle would intersect the first circle.
*With the pivot on the last point found, similarly find a third point on the circumference, and repeat until six such points have been marked.
*With a straight edge, join alternate points on the circumference to form two overlapping equilateral triangles.

== Construction by linear algebra ==
[[File:Hexagram-cube.png|thumb]]
A regular hexagram can be constructed by [[orthographic projection|orthographically projecting]] any [[cube]] onto a plane through three vertices that are all adjacent to the same vertex.  The twelve midpoints to edges of the cube form a hexagram.  For example, consider the projection of the unit cube with vertices at the eight possible binary vectors in three dimensions &lt;math&gt;(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1),(1,1,0),(1,0,1),(0,1,1),(1,1,1)&lt;/math&gt; onto the plane &lt;math&gt;x+y+z=1&lt;/math&gt;.  The midpoints are &lt;math&gt;(0,0,1/2),(0,1/2,1/2),(0,1,1/2),(1,1,1/2)&lt;/math&gt;, and all points resulting from these by applying a permutation to their entries.  These 12 points project to a hexagram: six vertices around the outer hexagon and six on the inner.

==Origins and shape==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2009}}
It is possible that as a simple geometric shape, like for example the triangle, circle, or square, the hexagram has been created by various peoples with no connection to one another.

The hexagram is a [[mandala]] symbol called ''satkona yantra'' or ''sadkona yantra'' found on ancient South [[India]]n [[Hindu]] temples. It symbolizes the [[nara-narayana]], or perfect [[meditative]] state of balance achieved between Man and God, and if maintained, results in "[[moksha]]," or "[[nirvana]]" (release from the bounds of the earthly world and its material trappings).{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Some researchers have theorized that the hexagram represents the [[astrological]] chart at the time of David's birth or [[anointment]] as king. The hexagram is also known as the "King's Star" in astrological circles.

In antique [[papyri]], [[pentagram]]s, together with stars and other signs, are frequently found on [[amulet]]s bearing the Jewish names of [[God]], and used to guard against fever and other diseases. Curiously the hexagram is not found among these signs. In the [[Greek Magical Papyri]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} (Wessely, l.c. pp.&amp;nbsp;31, 112) at Paris and London there are 22 signs side by side, and a circle with twelve signs, but neither a pentagram nor a hexagram.

==Usage in Dharmic religions==
{{refimprove|section|date=October 2018}}
[[File:Jain Cosmology0007small.JPG|thumb|Diagram showing the two mystic syllables Om and Hrim]]
Six-pointed stars have also been found in cosmological diagrams in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]]. The reasons behind this symbol's common appearance in Indic religions and the West are unknown. One possibility is that they have a common origin. The other possibility is that artists and religious people from several cultures independently created the hexagram shape, which is a relatively simple geometric design.

Within Indic lore, the shape is generally understood to consist of two triangles—one pointed up and the other down—locked in harmonious embrace. The two components are called "Om" and the "Hrim" in Sanskrit, and symbolize man's position between earth and sky. The downward triangle symbolizes [[Shakti]], the sacred embodiment of femininity, and the upward triangle symbolizes [[Shiva]], or [[Agni Tattva]], representing the focused aspects of masculinity. The mystical union of the two triangles represents Creation, occurring through the divine union of male and female. The two locked triangles are also known as 'Shanmukha'—the six-faced, representing the six faces of Shiva &amp; Shakti's progeny [[Kartikeya]]. This symbol is also a part of several yantras and has deep significance in Hindu ritual worship and history.

In [[Buddhism]], some old versions of the [[Bardo Thodol]], also known as The "Tibetan Book of the Dead", contain a hexagram with a [[Swastika]] inside. It was made up by the publishers for this particular publication. In Tibetan, it is called the "origin of phenomenon" (chos-kyi 'byung-gnas). It is especially connected with [[Vajrayogini]], and forms the center part of Her [[mandala]]. In reality, it is in three dimensions, not two, although it may be portrayed either way.

The [[Shatkona]] is a symbol used in [[Hindu]] [[yantra]] that represents the union of both the [[male]] and [[Female|feminine]] form. More specifically it is supposed to represent [[Purusha]] (the supreme being), and [[Prakriti]] (mother nature, or causal matter). Often this is represented as [[Shiva]] - [[Shakti]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sivasakti.com/articles/intro-yantra.html sivasakti.com: ''Iintroduction to Yantra'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shatkona is a hexagram and looks exactly like the [[Star of David]].

===Anahata: The Heart Chakra===

|width=170 valign=top|[[File:Anahata Mandala.svg|center|170px]]
|valign=top|'''[[Anahata]]''' (also known as '''Anahata-puri''', or '''Padma-sundara''') is symbolized by a lotus flower with twelve petals. (See also [[bodhicitta|heartmind]]). Anahata is related to the colors green or pink. Key issues involving Anahata involve complex emotions, compassion, tenderness, unconditional love, equilibrium, rejection and well-being. Physically Anahata governs circulation, emotionally it governs unconditional love for the self and others, mentally it governs passion, and spiritually it governs devotion.&lt;ref&gt;The Chakra Bible, Patricia Mercier, Octopus Publishing Group Ltd., 2007, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|}
In the [[endocrine system]], [[Anahata]] is associated with the [[thymus]] gland, located in the chest. This gland produces [[T-cells]], that combat disease, and bring equilibrium to the body. The functioning of the [[thymus]] is greatest before [[puberty]] and is impaired by the appearance of [[sex hormones]] in the blood stream from [[puberty]] onwards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

==Usage by the Abrahamic religions==

===Usage by Jews===
{{Main|Star of David}}
[[File:Leningrad Codex Carpet page e.jpg|thumb|The Star of David in the oldest surviving complete copy of the [[Masoretic text]], the [[Leningrad Codex]], dated 1008.]]
The ''Magen David'' is a generally recognized symbol of Judaism and Jewish identity and is also known colloquially as the Jewish Star or "Star of David." Its usage as a sign of Jewish identity began in the Middle Ages, though its religious usage began earlier, with the current earliest archeological evidence being a stone bearing the shield from the arch of a 3–4th century synagogue in the Galilee.&lt;ref&gt;"King Solomon's Seal", ''MFA'', [http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/2/King%20Solomon-s%20Seal King Solomon-s Seal].&lt;/ref&gt; A more enduring symbol of Judaism, the [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]], has been in use since about 1300 BC according to the [[Torah]] {{bibleverse||Exodus|25:31-40|HE}}.

===Usage by Christians===
The hexagram may be found in some Churches and stained-glass windows. In Christianity it is sometimes called the star of creation.  A very early example, noted by [[Nikolaus Pevsner]], can be found in [[Winchester Cathedral]], England in one of the canopies of the choir stalls, circa 1308.&lt;ref&gt;Buildings of England: Hampshire and the North (now second edition) {{ISBN|978 0 300 12084 4}}, p.604. &lt;/ref&gt;

In Balkan countries, hexagrams can be found more often in Orthodox Christian churches than in Roman Catholic churches.  
 
====Latter-day Saints (Mormons)====
[[File:Salt Lake Assembly Hall Star of David.jpg|thumb|Star of David on the [[Salt Lake Assembly Hall]]]]
{{Main|Mormonism and Judaism}}
The Star of David is also used less prominently by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], in the temples and in architecture. It symbolizes God reaching down to man and man reaching up to God, the union of Heaven and earth. It may also symbolize the [[Israelite|Tribes of Israel]] and friendship and their affinity towards the Jewish people. Additionally, it is sometimes used to symbolize the quorum of the twelve apostles, as in Revelation 12, wherein the Church of God is symbolized by a woman wearing a crown of twelve stars. It is also sometimes used to symbolize the Big Dipper, which points to the North Star, a symbol of Jesus Christ.

====Rastafari====
A black star of David is used to identify the black population, in Africa or otherwise, with one of the [[Israelite|Tribes of Israel]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
Due to the culture of Rastafari emerging out of the Judeo-Christian Ethiopian history, dating back to Solomonic dynastic rule, the star of David, or the Seal of Solomon is a prevalent symbol amongst its adherents. Rastafari has adherents from every race across the globe, rooted in Christian doctrine, it is not an African or bloodline doctrine.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The symbol is known in Arabic as ''Khātem Sulaymān'' ([[Seal of Solomon]]; {{lang|ar|خاتم سليمان}}) or ''Najmat Dāwūd'' ([[Star of David]]; {{lang|ar|نجمة داوود}}). The "Seal of Solomon" may also be represented by a five-pointed star or [[pentagram]].

In the [[Qur'an]], it is written that David and [[King Solomon]] (Arabic, ''Suliman'' or ''Sulayman'') were prophets and kings, and are figures revered by Muslims. The Medieval pre-Ottoman [[Hanafi]] [[Anatolian beyliks]] of the [[Karamanids]] and [[Jandarids]] used the star on their flag.&lt;ref name="Muwahhidists"&gt;The Muslim Empires of the Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals, By Stephen F. Dale, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol also used on [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] flag. Today the six-pointed star can be found in [[mosques]] and on other [[Arabic Art|Arabic]] and [[Islamic art]]ifacts.

Professor [[Gershom Sholem|Gershom Scholem]] theorizes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/the-curious-history-of-the-six-pointed-starhow-the-magen-david-became-the-jewish-symbol/|title=The Curious History of the Six-Pointed Star:How the “Magen David” Became the Jewish Symbol - Commentary Magazine|work=Commentary Magazine|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the "Star of David" originates in the writings of [[Aristotle]], who used triangles in different positions to indicate the different basic elements. The superposed triangles thus represented combinations of those elements. From Aristotle's writings those symbols made their ways into early, pre-Muslim Arab literature.

==Usage in heraldry==
In [[heraldry]] and [[vexillology]], a hexagram is a fairly common charge employed, though it is rarely called by this name. In Germanic regions it is known simply as a "star." In English and French heraldry, however, the hexagram is known as a "mullet of six points," where ''mullet'' is a French term for a [[spur|spur rowel]] which is shown with five pointed arms by default unless otherwise specified. In [[Albania]]n heraldry and vexillology, hexagram has been used since [[classical antiquity]] and it is commonly referred to as ''sixagram''. [[:File:Coa Kastrioti Family.svg|Coa Kastrioti Family]] of the [[House of Kastrioti]] depicts the hexagram on a '''[[pile (heraldry)|pile]]''' argent over the double headed eagle. A hexagram also appears on the '''Dardania''' Flag, proposed for [[Kosovo]] by the [[Democratic League of Kosovo]].

==Usage in theosophy==
The Star of David is used in the seal and the emblem of the [[Theosophical Society]] (founded in 1875). Although it is more pronounced, it is used along with other religious symbols. These include the [[Swastika]], the [[Ankh]], the [[Om|Aum]], and the [[Ouroboros]]. The star of David is also known as the Seal of Solomon that was its original name until around 50 years ago.

==Usage in occultism==
The hexagram, like the [[pentagram]], was and is used in practices of the [[occult]] and [[ceremonial magic]] and is attributed to the 7 "old" planets outlined in [[astrology]].

The six-pointed star is commonly used both as a [[talisman]]&lt;ref&gt;P299 (and throughout) of ''The Complete Goldendawn'' by Israel Regardie. {{ISBN|978-0875426631}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for conjuring spirits and spiritual forces in diverse forms of [[Magic (paranormal)|occult magic]]. In the book [[The History and Practice of Magic, Vol. 2]], the six-pointed star is called the talisman of Saturn and it is also referred to as the Seal of Solomon.&lt;ref&gt;"The History and Practice of Magic" (Secaucus, NJ: University Books, published by arrangement with Lyle Stewart, 1979), Vol. II, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; Details are given in this book on how to make these symbols and the materials to use.
[[File:Star of David GGNC grave marker engraving.JPG|thumb|200x200px|Double hexagram.]]
Traditionally, the Hexagram can be seen as the combination of the four elements. Fire is symbolized as an upwards pointing triangle, while Air (its elemental opposite) is also an upwards pointing triangle, but with a horizontal line through its center. Water is symbolized as a downwards pointing triangle, while Earth (its elemental opposite) is also a downwards pointing triangle, but with a horizontal line through its center. When you combine the symbols of Fire and Water, a hexagram (six-pointed star) is created. The same follows for when you combine the symbols of Air and Earth.  When you combine both hexagrams, you get the double-hexagram. Thus, a combination of the elements is created.&lt;ref&gt;P315-316 of ''The Wicca Bible'' by Ann-Marie Gallagher. {{ISBN|978-1-84181-250-2}}. Same information also found in many other books.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] and [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] Magic, the seven Traditional Planets correspond with the angles and the center of the Hexagram as follows, in the same patterns as they appear on the [[Sephiroth]] and on the [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]]. Saturn, although formally attributed to the Sephira of [[Binah (Kabbalah)|Binah]], within this frame work nonetheless occupies the position of [[Da'at (Kabbalah)|Daath]].&lt;ref&gt;P31 of ''The Ritual Magic Manual: A Complete Course in Practical Magic'' by David Griffin. {{ISBN|978-0965840897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage in Freemasonry==
{{quote|"The interlacing triangles or deltas symbolize the union of the two principles or forces, the active and passive, male and female, pervading the universe ... The two triangles, one white and the other black, interlacing, typify the mingling of apparent opposites in nature, darkness and light, error and truth, ignorance and wisdom, evil and good, throughout human life." –&amp;nbsp;Albert G. Mackey: ''Encyclopedia of [[Freemason]]ry''}}

The hexagram is featured within and on the outside of many [[Masonic temple]]s as a decoration. It may have been found within the structures of [[King Solomon]]'s temple, from which [[Freemasons]] are inspired in their philosophies and studies. Like many other symbols in Freemasonry, the deciphering of the hexagram is non-dogmatic and left to the interpretation of the individual.

* In [[alchemy]], the two triangles represent the reconciliation of the opposites of fire and water. Non-Jewish Kabbalah (also called Christian or Hermetic Kabbalah) interprets{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} the hexagram to mean the divine union of male and female energy, where the male is represented by the upper triangle and the female by the lower one. Moreover, it derives four triangular symbols from it (two triangles crossed like a capital letter A and two uncrossed) to represent the four elements: water, fire, air, and earth. This use of the symbol was used as an important plot point in [[Dan Brown]]'s popular novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' and [[Da Vinci Code (film)|the ''Da Vinci Code'' film]] cites this as the origin of the star.
* It was also used as a sign for [[Aether (classical element)#Fifth element|quintessence]], the fifth element.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
* In southern Germany the hexagram can be found as part of tavern anchors. It is symbol for the tapping of beer and sign of the brewer's guild. In German this is called "Bierstern" (beer star) or "[[:de:Brauerstern|Brauerstern]]" (brewer's star).

The Hubble constant, named for [[astronomer]] [[Edwin Hubble]], whose work made clear the [[Metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]], measures the rate at which expansion occurs. In accordance with the [[Copernican principle]] that the Earth is not in a central, specially favored position, one would expect that measuring this constant at any point in the universe would yield the same value. If, on the other hand, Earth were at or near the center of a very low-density region of [[interstellar space]] (a relative void), denser material in a shell around it would strongly&lt;!--is "strongly" necessary?--&gt; attract material away from the centerpoint. Thus, stars inside such a "Hubble bubble" would accelerate away from Earth much&lt;!--much?--&gt; faster than the general expansion of the universe.&lt;ref name = astronweb/&gt;&lt;ref name= moss/&gt; This situation would provide an alternative to [[dark energy]] in explaining the apparent [[accelerating universe]].&lt;ref name=moss/&gt;

==Hubble bubble proposed==
In 1998, Zehavi et al. reported evidence in support of a Hubble bubble.&lt;ref name=zehavi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zehavi|first=Idit|author2=Adam G Riess |author3=Robert P Kirshner |author4=Avishai Dekel |title=A Local Hubble Bubble from Type IA Supernovae?|journal=Astrophysical Journal|date=1998|volume=503|issue=2|page=483|doi=10.1086/306015|bibcode=1998ApJ...503..483Z|arxiv = astro-ph/9802252 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial suggestion that local [[redshift]] velocities differ from those seen elsewhere in the universe was based on observations of [[Type 1a supernova]]e, often abbreviated "SNe Ia." Such stars have been used as [[standard candle]] distance markers for 20 years, and were key to the first observations of [[dark energy]].&lt;ref name=overbye&gt;{{cite news|last=Overbye|first=Dennis|title=From the Clash of White Dwarfs, the Birth of a Supernova|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/23/science/space/23star.html?_r=1|accessdate=6 February 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=February 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zehavi ''et al.'' studied the peculiar velocites of 44 SNe Ia to test for a local void, and reported that Earth seemed to be inside a relative void of roughly 20% underdensity, surrounded by a dense shell, a "bubble".&lt;ref name=zehavi/&gt;

==Testing the hypothesis==

In 2007, Conley et al. examined the SNe Ia color data comparisons while taking into account the effect of cosmic dust in external galaxies. They concluded that the data did not support the existence of a local Hubble bubble.&lt;ref name=conley/&gt;

In 2010, Moss et al. analyzed the Hubble Bubble model although without using that name,&lt;ref name=astronweb/&gt; saying "The suggestion that we occupy a privileged position near the center of a large, nonlinear, and nearly spherical void has recently attracted much attention as an alternative to dark energy."&lt;ref name=moss&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moss|first=Adam|author2=James P Zibin |author3=Douglas Scott |title=Precision Cosmology Defeats Void Models for Acceleration|date=July 21, 2010|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.83.103515|journal=Physical Review D|volume=83|issue=10 |pages=103515|arxiv=1007.3725|bibcode = 2011PhRvD..83j3515M }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Looking not only at supernova data but also at the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|cosmic microwave background spectrum]], [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] and other factors, they concluded that "voids are in severe tension with the data. In particular, void models predict a very low local Hubble rate, suffer from an "old age problem", and predict much less local structure than is observed."&lt;ref name = moss/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7600">An '''Index of Biological Integrity''' ('''IBI'''), also called an '''Index of Biotic Integrity''', is a scientific tool used to identify and classify [[water pollution]] problems. An IBI associates [[Anthropogenic hazard|anthropogenic]] influences on a water body with biological activity in the water body, and is formulated using data developed from [[biosurvey]]s.

==Overview==
To quantitatively assess changes in the composition of biologic communities, IBIs are developed to accurately reflect the [[ecological complexity]] from statistical analysis. There is no one universal IBI, and developing metrics that consistently give accurate assessment of the monitored population requires rigorous testing to confirm its validity for a given subject.  Often IBIs are region-specific and require experienced professionals to provide sufficient quality data to correctly assess a score.  Because communities naturally vary as do samples collected from a larger population, identifying robust [[statistics]] with acceptable variance is an area of active research.

This is the most powerful tool existing to identify systemic impacts on the [[health]] of biological systems.  IBIs are increasingly involved in the identification of [[Clean Water Act#Water Quality Standards Program|impairment]], and confirmation of recovery of [[impaired water]]s, in the [[Total Maximum Daily Load]] process required by the [[Clean Water Act]] in the USA.  

Unlike [[Water pollution#Chemical testing|chemical testing]] of water samples, which gives brief snap-shots of chemical concentrations, an IBI captures an integrated net impact on a biological community structure.  While the complete absence, particularly sudden disappearance of, suits of [[indicator species]] can constitute powerful evidence of a specific pollutant or [[stress factor]], IBIs generally do not resolve a specific cause of impairment.

The IBI concept was formulated by Dr. James Karr in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Karr |first1=James R. |year=1981 |title=Assessment of biotic integrity using fish communities |journal=Fisheries |volume=6 |issue= |pages=21–27 |url= |doi=10.1577/1548-8446(1981)006&lt;0021:AOBIUF&gt;2.0.CO;2 |issn=1548-8446}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karr, James R. 1991. [http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.2307/1941848 "Biological integrity: A long-neglected aspect of water resource management."] [http://esapubs.org/esapubs/journals/applications.htm ''Ecological Applications''] 1:66–84.&lt;/ref&gt; To date IBIs have been developed for [[fish]], [[algae]], [[macroinvertebrate]]s, pupal [[exuvia]] (shed skins of [[chironomidae]]), [[vascular plants]], and combinations of these.

==Biosurvey protocols==
Biosurvey protocols have been published for use in different waterbody types and ecoregions. One such publication is the ''Rapid Bioassessment Protocol'' for streams and rivers, issued by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).&lt;ref&gt;Barbour, M.T., J. Gerritsen, B.D. Snyder, and J.B. Stribling. [http://www.epa.gov/owowwtr1/monitoring/rbp/ "Rapid Bioassessment Protocols for Use in Streams and Wadeable Rivers: Periphyton, Benthic Macroinvertebrates and Fish, Second Edition."] EPA, 1999. Document No. 841-B-99-002.&lt;/ref&gt; Such protocols provide a structure for developing an IBI, which may include measures such as richness of [[taxa]] (species, [[genera]], etc.) and proportion of pollution-tolerant or intolerant taxa.

==Development with volunteer and professional staff==
It is possible to create IBIs for use by minimally trained monitoring personnel, however the precision obtainable is lower than that conducted by trained professionals. Safeguards to assure robustness in spite of potential misidentifications or [[Protocol (natural sciences)|protocol]] variations require careful testing. Ongoing [[quality control]] by established experts is needed to maintain data integrity, and the analysis of IBI results becomes more complex.  Use of trained volunteers is being pioneered by government agencies responsible for monitoring large numbers of water bodies with limited resources, such as the [[Minnesota Pollution Control Agency]] (MPCA) and local volunteer stream monitoring programs supported by MPCA.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see the [http://www.mnwhep.org Wetland Health Evaluation Program (WHEP)] in the greater [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] area.&lt;/ref&gt; EPA has published guidance to assist volunteer programs in formulating IBIs and related findings.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, DC. [https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-06/documents/stream.pdf "Volunteer Stream Monitoring: A Methods Manual."] November 1997. Document No. EPA 841-B-97-003. Section 4.3.&lt;/ref&gt; While IBIs from such programs are legally admissible in [[Federal judiciary of the United States|US courts]], defending the validity of conclusions based solely on such results is unlikely to be feasible.

Agreement among multiple IBIs from data collected by established professionals can be more conclusive. A case in point is the phenomenon that stream IBI scores indicate significant impairment, or partial [[ecological collapse]] where more than 10 to 15 percent of the immediately surrounding [[drainage basin|watershed]] is [[impervious surface|impervious]] due to [[urbanization]].&lt;ref&gt;Schueler, Thomas R. [http://www.cwp.org/Resource_Library/Center_Docs/PWP/ELC_PWP1.pdf "The Importance of Imperviousness."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227110104/http://www.cwp.org/Resource_Library/Center_Docs/PWP/ELC_PWP1.pdf |date=2009-02-27 }} Reprinted in [http://www.cwp.org/Store/guidance.htm ''The Practice of Watershed Protection.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223004441/http://www.cwp.org/Store/guidance.htm |date=2008-12-23 }} 2000. Center for Watershed Protection. Ellicott City, MD.&lt;/ref&gt; Identifying reasons for such impairments, and possible exceptions to these trends, are major research challenges for academics studying [[cumulative watershed effects]], and the use of [[Low-impact development (Canada/US)|Low Impact Development]] techniques to mitigate the impacts of [[stormwater]] [[surface runoff|runoff]] pollution.

The Management Engine is often confused with [[Intel Active Management Technology|Intel AMT]]. AMT runs on the ME, but is only available on processors with [[vPro]].

However, the ME itself is built into all Intel chipsets since 2008, not only those with AMT. While AMT can be unprovisioned by the owner, there is no official, documented way to disable the ME.

The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) and security expert Damien Zammit accuse the ME of being a [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] and a privacy concern.&lt;ref name="softpediaME" /&gt;&lt;ref name=eff1 /&gt; Zammit states that the ME has full access to memory (without the parent CPU having any knowledge); has full access to the [[TCP/IP stack]] and can send and receive network packets independent of the operating system, thus bypassing its firewall.&lt;ref name="techrepublicME" /&gt; Intel asserts that it "does not put back doors in its products" and that its products do not "give Intel control or access to computing systems without the explicit permission of the end user."&lt;ref name="techrepublicME" /&gt;&lt;ref name="register_can_disable" /&gt;

Several weaknesses have been found in the ME. On May 1, 2017, Intel confirmed a Remote Elevation of Privilege bug (SA-00075) in its Management Technology.&lt;ref name="intelmay"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://security-center.intel.com/advisory.aspx?intelid=INTEL-SA-00075&amp;languageid=en-fr |title=Intel® Product Security Center |website=Security-center.intel.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every Intel platform with provisioned Intel Standard Manageability, Active Management Technology, or Small Business Technology, from [[Intel Nehalem|Nehalem]] in 2008 to [[Intel Kaby Lake|Kaby Lake]] in 2017 has a remotely exploitable security hole in the ME.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Charlie Demerjian |url=https://semiaccurate.com/2017/05/01/remote-security-exploit-2008-intel-platforms/ |title=Remote security exploit in all 2008+ Intel platforms |publisher=SemiAccurate |date=2017-05-01 |accessdate=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reg-2017-05-01"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/05/01/intel_amt_me_vulnerability/ |title=Red alert!

==Design==
===Hardware===
Starting with ME 11, it is based on the [[Intel Quark]] x86-based [[32-bit]] CPU and runs the [[MINIX 3]] operating system.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ptsecurity.com/2017/08/disabling-intel-me.html |title=Positive Technologies Blog: Disabling Intel ME 11 via undocumented mode |accessdate=2017-08-30 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; The ME state is stored in a partition of the [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|SPI flash]], using the [[Embedded Flash File System]] (EFFS).&lt;ref name="is"/&gt; Previous versions were based on an [[ARC (processor)|ARC core]], with the Management Engine running the [[ThreadX]] [[RTOS]] from [[Express Logic]]. Versions 1.x to 5.x of the ME used the ARCTangent-A4 (32-bit only instructions) whereas versions 6.x to 8.x used the newer ARCompact (mixed 32- and [[16-bit]] [[instruction set architecture]]). Starting with ME 7.1, the ARC processor could also execute signed [[Java applets]].

The ME has its own MAC and IP address for the out-of-band interface, with direct access to the Ethernet controller; one portion of the Ethernet traffic is diverted to the ME even before reaching the host's operating system, for what support exists in various Ethernet controllers, exported and made configurable via [[Management Component Transport Protocol]] (MCTP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/datasheets/i210-ethernet-controller-datasheet.pdf | title = Intel Ethernet Controller I210 Datasheet | format = PDF | year = 2013 | accessdate = 2013-11-09 | publisher = [[Intel]] | pages = 1, 15, 52, 621&amp;ndash;776 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/product-briefs/ethernet-x540-brief.pdf | title = Intel Ethernet Controller X540 Product Brief | format = PDF | year = 2012 | accessdate = 2014-02-26 | publisher = [[Intel]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ME also communicates with the host via PCI interface.&lt;ref name="is"&gt;Igor Skochinsky ([[Hex-Rays]]) [http://2012.ruxconbreakpoint.com/assets/Uploads/bpx/Breakpoint%202012%20Skochinsky.pdf Rootkit in your laptop], Ruxcon Breakpoint 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Under Linux, communication between the host and the ME is done via &lt;tt&gt;/dev/mei&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;ref name="meilnx"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/misc-devices/mei/mei.txt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 25, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101045709/https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/misc-devices/mei/mei.txt |archivedate=November 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the release of [[Nehalem (microarchitecture)|Nehalem]] processors, the ME was usually embedded into the motherboard's [[Northbridge (computing)|northbridge]], following the [[Memory Controller Hub]] (MCH) layout.&lt;ref name="quest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://invisiblethingslab.com/resources/misc09/Quest%20To%20The%20Core%20%28public%29.pdf |format=PDF |title=A Quest to the Core |author=Joanna Rutkowska |website=Invisiblethingslab.com |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the newer Intel architectures ([[Intel 5 Series]] onwards), ME is included into the [[Platform Controller Hub]] (PCH).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/datasheets/celeron-mobile-p4000-u3000-datasheet.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 26, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140211075753/http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/datasheets/celeron-mobile-p4000-u3000-datasheet.pdf |archivedate=February 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.nik.uni-obuda.hu/sima/letoltes/magyar/SZA2011_osz/nappali/Platforms-3_E_2011_12_14.ppt |format=PDF |title=Platforms II |website=Users.nik.uni-obuda.hu |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Firmware===
By Intel's current terminology as of 2017, ME is one of several firmware sets for the Converged Security and Manageability Engine (CSME). Prior to AMT version 11, CSME was called Intel Management Engine BIOS Extension (Intel MEBx).&lt;ref name=intelamt /&gt;

==Security vulnerabilities==
===Disabling the ME===
It is normally not possible for the user to disable the ME. Potentially risky, undocumented methods to do so were discovered, however.&lt;ref name=extreme1 /&gt; These methods are not supported by Intel. The ME's security architecture is supposed to prevent disabling, and thus its possibility is considered a security vulnerability. For example, a virus could abuse it to make the computer lose some of the functionality that the typical end-user  expects, such as the ability to play media with [[Digital rights management|DRM]]. Yet, critics consider the weaknesses not as bugs, but as features.

Strictly speaking, none of the known methods disables the ME completely, since it is required for booting the main CPU. All known methods merely make the ME go into abnormal states soon after boot, in which it seems not to have any working functionality. The ME is still physically connected to the current and its microprocessor is continuing to execute code.

====Undocumented methods====

=====Firmware neutering=====
In 2016, the me_cleaner project found that the ME's integrity verification is broken. The ME is supposed to detect that it has been tampered with, and, if this is the case, shut down the PC forcibly after 30 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/corna/me_cleaner&lt;/ref&gt; This prevents a compromised system from running undetected, yet allows the owner to fix the issue by flashing a valid version of the ME firmware during the grace period. As the project found out, by making unauthorized changes to the ME firmware, it was possible to force it into an abnormal error state that prevented triggering the shutdown even if large parts of the firmware had been overwritten and thus made inoperable.

====="High Assurance Platform" mode=====
In August 2017, Russian company Positive Technologies ([[Dmitry Sklyarov]]) published a method to disable the ME via an undocumented built-in mode. As Intel has confirmed&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/hardware/researchers-find-a-way-to-disable-much-hated-intel-me-component-courtesy-of-the-nsa/&lt;/ref&gt; the ME contains a switch to enable government authorities such as the [[NSA]] to make the ME go into High-Assurance Platform (HAP) mode after boot. This mode disables most of ME's functions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/08/29/intel_management_engine_can_be_disabled/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.ptsecurity.com/2017/08/disabling-intel-me.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is authorized for use by government authorities only and is supposed to be available only in machines produced for them. Yet it turned out that most machines sold on the retail market can be tricked into activating the switch.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.ptsecurity.com/2017/08/disabling-intel-me.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/corna/me_cleaner/wiki/HAP-AltMeDisable-bit&lt;/ref&gt;. Manipulation of the HAP bit was quickly incorporated into the me_cleaner project&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/corna/me_cleaner/commit/ced3b46ba2ccd74602b892f9594763ef34671652&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Commercial ME disablement====
In late 2017, several laptop vendors announced their intentions to ship laptops with the Intel ME disabled:

* [[Purism, SPC|Purism]] previously petitioned Intel to sell processors without the ME, or release its source code, calling it "a threat to users' digital rights"&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20160616070449/https://puri.sm/posts/petition-for-intel-to-release-an-me-less-cpu-design/&lt;/ref&gt;. In March 2017, Purism announced&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://puri.sm/posts/neutralizing-intel-management-engine-on-librem-laptops/|title=Neutralizing the Intel Management Engine on Librem Laptops|last=Alaoui|first=Youness|date=2017-03-09|website=puri.sm|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it had neutralized the ME by erasing the majority of the ME code from the flash memory. It further announced in October 2017&lt;ref&gt;https://puri.sm/posts/purism-librem-laptops-completely-disable-intel-management-engine/&lt;/ref&gt; that new batches of their [[Debian]]-based Librem line of laptops will ship with the ME neutralized (via erasing the majority of ME code from the flash, as previously announced), and additionally disabling most ME operation via the HAP bit. Updates for existing Librem laptops were also announced. 

* [[System 76]] announced in November 2017&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.system76.com/post/168050597573/system76-me-firmware-updates-plan&lt;/ref&gt; their plan to disable the ME on their new and recent [[Ubuntu_(operating_system)|Ubuntu]]-based machines via the HAP bit.

* [[Dell]], in December 2017,&lt;ref&gt;https://liliputing.com/2017/12/dell-also-sells-laptops-intel-management-engine-disabled.html&lt;/ref&gt; began showing certain laptops on its website that offered the "Systems Management" option "Intel vPro - ME Inoperable, Custom Order" for an additional fee. Dell has not announced or publicly explained the methods used. In response to press requests, Dell stated that those systems had been offered for quite a while, but not for the general public, and had found their way to the website only inadvertently.&lt;ref name=extremedell&gt;https://www.extremetech.com/computing/260219-dell-sells-pcs-without-intel-management-engine-tradeoffs&lt;/ref&gt; The laptops are available only by custom order and only to military, government and intelligence agencies.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Dell-schaltet-Intel-Management-Engine-in-Spezial-Notebooks-ab-3909860.html&lt;/ref&gt; They are specifically designed for covert operations, such as providing a very robust case and a "stealth" operating mode kill switch that disables display, LED lights, speaker, fan and any wireless technology&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dell.com/support/manuals/us/en/04/latitude-14-5414-laptop/5414_om/stealth-mode?guid=guid-3655713b-6a1b-46a8-ba69-eaa3c324b3cd&amp;lang=en-us&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Effectiveness against vulnerabilities====
None of the two methods to disable the ME discovered so far turned out to be an effective countermeasure against the SA-00086 vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/12/06/intel_management_engine_pwned_by_buffer_overflow/&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the vulnerability is in an early-loaded ME module that is essential to boot the main CPU.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/rootkovska/status/938458875522666497&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Ring -3}}Ring −3 rootkit===
A [[protection ring|ring]]&amp;nbsp;−3 rootkit was demonstrated by Invisible Things Lab for the Q35 chipset; it does not work for the later Q45 chipset as Intel implemented additional protections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://invisiblethingslab.com/press/itl-press-2009-03.pdf |format=PDF |title=Invisible Things Lab to present two new technical presentations disclosing system-level vulnerabilities affecting modern PC hardware at its core |website=Invisiblethingslab.com |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exploit worked by remapping the normally protected memory region (top 16&amp;nbsp;MB of RAM) reserved for the ME. The ME rootkit could be installed regardless of whether the AMT is present or enabled on the system, as the chipset always contains the ARC ME coprocessor. (The "−3" designation was chosen because the ME coprocessor works even when the system is in the [[Sleep mode|S3 state]], thus it was considered a layer below the [[System Management Mode]] rootkits.&lt;ref name="quest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://invisiblethingslab.com/resources/misc09/Quest%20To%20The%20Core%20%28public%29.pdf |format=PDF |title=A Quest to the Core |author=Joanna Rutkowska |website=Invisiblethingslab.com |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;) For the vulnerable Q35 chipset, a [[keystroke logger]] ME-based rootkit was demonstrated by Patrick Stewin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stewin.org/slides/pstewin-SPRING6-EvaluatingRing-3Rootkits.pdf |format=PDF |title=Berlin Institute of Technology : FG Security in telecommunications : Evaluating "Ring-3" Rootkits |website=Stewin.org |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stewin.org/slides/44con_2013-dedicated_hw_malware-stewin_bystrov.pdf |format=PDF |title=Persistent, Stealthy Remote-controlled Dedicated Hardware Malware |website=Stewin.org |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zero-touch provisioning===
Another security evaluation by Vassilios Ververis showed serious weaknesses in the GM45 chipset implementation. In particular, it criticized AMT for transmitting unencrypted passwords in the SMB provisioning mode when the IDE redirection and Serial over LAN features are used. It also found that the "zero touch" provisioning mode (ZTC) is still enabled even when the AMT appears to be disabled in BIOS. For about 60 euros, Ververis purchased from [[Go Daddy]] a certificate that is accepted by the ME firmware and allows remote "zero touch" provisioning of (possibly unsuspecting) machines, which broadcast their HELLO packets to would-be configuration servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.it.kth.se/~maguire/DEGREE-PROJECT-REPORTS/100402-Vassilios_Ververis-with-cover.pdf |format=PDF |title=Security Evaluation of Intel's Active Management Technology |website=Web.it.kth.se |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SA-00075 (aka Silent Bob is Silent)===
In May 2017, Intel confirmed that many computers with AMT have had an unpatched critical privilege escalation vulnerability ([[CVE-2017-5689]]).&lt;ref name="reg-2017-05-01"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2017-5689 |title=CVE - CVE-2017-5689 |website=Cve.mitre.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="intelmay"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.darknet.org.uk/2016/06/intel-hidden-management-engine-x86-security-risk/ |title=Intel Hidden Management Engine - x86 Security Risk? |publisher=Darknet |date=2016-06-16 |accessdate=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garrett |first=Matthew |url=https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/48429.html |title=Intel's remote AMT vulnerablity |website=mjg59.dreamwidth.org |date=2017-05-01 |accessdate=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vulnerability, which was nicknamed "Silent Bob is Silent" by the researchers who had reported it to Intel,&lt;ref name="ssh-com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ssh.com/vulnerability/intel-amt/|title=2017-05-05 ALERT!

In June 2017, the [[PLATINUM (cybercrime group)|PLATINUM]] cybercrime group became notable for exploiting the [[Serial over LAN|serial over LAN (SOL)]] capabilities of AMT to perform data exfiltration of stolen documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/06/sneaky-hackers-use-intel-management-tools-to-bypass-windows-firewall/|title=Sneaky hackers use Intel management tools to bypass Windows firewall|publisher=|accessdate=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-firewall-dodged-by-hot-patching-spies-using-intel-amt-says-microsoft/|title=Windows firewall dodged by 'hot-patching' spies using Intel AMT, says Microsoft - ZDNet|first=Liam|last=Tung|publisher=|accessdate=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="microsoft.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mmpc/2017/06/07/platinum-continues-to-evolve-find-ways-to-maintain-invisibility/|title=PLATINUM continues to evolve, find ways to maintain invisibility|publisher=|accessdate=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malware-uses-obscure-intel-cpu-feature-to-steal-data-and-avoid-firewalls/|title=Malware Uses Obscure Intel CPU Feature to Steal Data and Avoid Firewalls|publisher=|accessdate=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.itnews.com.au/news/hackers-abuse-low-level-management-feature-for-invisible-backdoor-464499|title=Hackers abuse low-level management feature for invisible backdoor|website=iTnews|accessdate=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/AMP/2017/06/08/vxers_exploit_intels_amt_for_malwareoverlan/|title=Vxers exploit Intel's Active Management for malware-over-LAN • The Register|website=www.theregister.co.uk|accessdate=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.heise.de/security/meldung/Intel-Fernwartung-AMT-bei-Angriffen-auf-PCs-genutzt-3739441.html|title=Intel-Fernwartung AMT bei Angriffen auf PCs genutzt|first=heise|last=Security|website=Security|accessdate=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Windows-Security-Blog/PLATINUM-activity-group-file-transfer-method-using-Intel-AMT-SOL|title=PLATINUM activity group file-transfer method using Intel AMT SOL|website=Channel 9|accessdate=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SA-00086===
Some months after the previous bugs, and subsequent warnings from the EFF,&lt;ref name=eff1 /&gt; security firm Positive Technologies claimed to have developed a working [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.blackhat.com/eu-17/briefings/schedule/#how-to-hack-a-turned-off-computer-or-running-unsigned-code-in-intel-management-engine-8668 How to Hack a Turned-Off Computer, or Running Unsigned Code in Intel Management Engine Black Hat Europe 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 November, 2017 Intel confirmed that a number of serious flaws had been found in the Management Engine (mainstream), Trusted Execution Engine (tablet/mobile), and Server Platform Services (high end server) firmware, and released a "critical firmware update".&lt;ref name=intel2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000025619/software.html|title=Intel® Management Engine Critical Firmware Update (Intel SA-00086)|publisher=Intel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wired1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/story/intel-management-engine-vulnerabilities-pcs-servers-iot/|title=Intel Chip Flaws Leave Millions of Devices Exposed|publisher=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially every Intel-based computer for the last several years, including most desktops and servers, were found to be vulnerable to having their security compromised, although all the potential routes of exploitation were not entirely known.&lt;ref name=wired1 /&gt; It is not possible to patch the problems from the operating system, and a firmware (UEFI, BIOS) update to the motherboard is required, which was anticipated to take quite some time for the many individual manufacturers to accomplish, if it ever would be for many systems.&lt;ref name=extreme1 /&gt;

====Affected systems&lt;ref name=intel2 /&gt;====
* [[Intel Atom]] – C3000 family
* Intel Atom – Apollo Lake E3900 series
* [[Intel Celeron]] – N and J series
* [[Intel Core]] (i3, i5, i7, i9) – 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th generation
* [[Intel Pentium]] – Apollo Lake
* [[Intel Xeon]] – E3-1200 v5 and v6 product family
* Intel Xeon – Scalable family
* Intel Xeon – W family

====Mitigation====
None of the known unofficial methods to disable the ME prevent exploitation of the vulnerability. A firmware update by the vendor is required. However, those who discovered the vulnerability note that firmware updates are not fully effective either, as an attacker with access to the ME firmware region can simply flash an old, vulnerable version and then exploit the bug.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/12/06/intel_management_engine_pwned_by_buffer_overflow/&lt;/ref&gt;

===SA-00112===
In July 2018 Intel announced that 3 vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-3628, CVE-2018-3629 and CVE-2018-3632) had been discovered and that a patch for the CSME firmware would be required. Intel indicated there would be no patch for 3rd generation Core processors or earlier despite chips or their chipsets as far back as Intel Core 2 Duo vPro and Intel Centrino 2 vPro being affected.&lt;ref name=SA-00112/&gt;

==Claims that ME is a backdoor==
Critics like the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) and security expert Damien Zammit accused the ME of being a [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] and a privacy concern.&lt;ref name="softpediaME"&gt;{{cite web |title=Intel x86 CPUs Come with a Secret Backdoor That Nobody Can Touch or Disable |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/intel-x86-cpus-come-with-a-secret-backdoor-that-nobody-can-touch-or-disable-505347.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eff1 /&gt; Zammit stresses that the ME has full access to memory (without the parent CPU having any knowledge); has full access to the TCP/IP stack and can send and receive network packets independently of the operating system, thus bypassing its firewall.&lt;ref name="techrepublicME" /&gt;

Intel responded by saying that "Intel does not put back doors in its products nor do our products give Intel control or access to computing systems without the explicit permission of the end user."&lt;ref name="techrepublicME" /&gt; and "Intel does not and will not design backdoors for access into its products. Recent reports claiming otherwise are misinformed and blatantly false. Intel does not participate in any efforts to decrease security of its technology."&lt;ref name="register_can_disable"&gt;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/08/29/intel_management_engine_can_be_disabled/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of criticism of the Intel ME and AMD Secure Technology it has been pointed out that the NSA budget request for 2013 contained a Sigint Enabling Project with the goal to "Insert vulnerabilities into commercial encryption systems, IT systems, …" and it has been conjectured that Intel ME and AMD Secure Technology might be part of that programme.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.heise.de/ct/ausgabe/2018-7-Briefe-E-Mail-Hotline-3992838.html#p_41&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
{{asof|2017}}, Google was attempting to eliminate [[proprietary software|proprietary]] firmware from its servers and found that the ME was a hurdle to that.&lt;ref name=extreme1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.extremetech.com/computing/259426-intel-patches-major-flaws-intel-management-engine|title=Intel Patches Major Flaws in the Intel Management Engine|publisher=Extreme Tech}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
===Reaction by AMD processor vendors===
Shortly after SA-00086 was patched, vendors for AMD processor mainboards started shipping BIOS updates that allow disabling the [[AMD Platform Security Processor|AMD Secure Technology]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/AMD-Secure-Processor-PSP-wohl-bei-einigen-Ryzen-Mainboards-abschaltbar-3913635.html&lt;/ref&gt; a subsystem with similar function as the ME.

'''Joint Forest Management''' often abbreviated as '''JFM''' is the official and popular term in [[India]] for partnerships in [[forest]] [[Social movement|movement]] involving both the state forest departments and local communities. The policies and objectives of Joint Forest Movement are detailed in the Indian comprehensive National Forest Policy of 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://moef.nic.in/downloads/about-the-ministry/introduction-nfp.pdf|title=National Forest Policy, 1988|last=|first=|date=|website=Ministry of Environment, Forests and climate change|access-date=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;http://www.manage.gov.in/managelib/extdig/Untitled-1.pdf#search=%22%22joint%20forest%20management%22%22&lt;/ref&gt; and the Joint Forest Management Guidelines of 1990 of the [[Government of India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fire.uni-freiburg.de/iffn/country/in/in_6.htm Lessons from Joint Forest Management&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although schemes vary from state to state and are known by different names in different [[Languages of India|Indian languages]], usually a village committee known as the Forest Protection Committee (FPC) and the Forest Department enter into a JFM agreement. Villagers agree to assist in the safeguarding of forest resources through protection from fire, grazing, and illegal harvesting in exchange for which they receive [[non-timber forest product]]s and a share of the revenue from the sale of [[timber]] products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.envfor.nic.in/divisions/forprt/terijfm.html Study on Joint Forest Management&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070111095120/http://envfor.nic.in/divisions/forprt/terijfm.html |date=2007-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Joint Forest Management originated in [[West Bengal]] in 1980's in Asia and Africa  . The major hardwood of Arabari is [[Sal tree|sal]], a commercially profitable forest crop. Ajit Kumar Banerjee, a [[Silviculture|silviculturalist]], working for the Forest Department as the Divisional Forest Officer, was conducting trials which were constantly being disturbed by grazing and illegal harvesting by the local populace. At the time there were no initiatives for sharing of forest resources between the government and the locals, with the government considering many of the locals no more than "thieves".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldbank.org/wbi/sourcebook/sb0207.pdf#search=%22arabari%20banerjee%22&lt;/ref&gt; The forest official, against the suggestions of his co-workers, sought out representatives of eleven local villages and negotiated the terms of a contract with an ''ad hoc'' Forest Protection Committee. The initial program involved 612 families managing 12.7 square kilometres of forests classified as "degraded". 25% of profits from the forests were shared with the villagers. The experiment was successful and was expanded to other parts of the state in 1987. JFM is still in force at Arabari.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

A few years later, Joint Forest Management was employed in the state of [[Haryana]] to prevent [[soil erosion]] and [[deforestation]]. In 1977, villagers were persuaded that instead of grazing on erosion-prone hills, building small dams would help agricultural output on areas currently under cultivation. The program led to reforestation of many hills in the state.However,officially the state of Odisha remains the first to pass the first resolution for JFM&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/1998/98sep27/haryana.htm#3 tribuneindia... Haryana&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==
After the initial successes in West Bengal and Haryana, the JFM schemes received national importance in the legislation of 1988 and thrust in the Guidelines of 1998. As of 2000 27 states of the Indian Union had various JFM schemes with over 63,000 FPCs involved in the joint management of over 140,000&amp;nbsp;km² of forested land.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rupfor.org/jfm.asp Resource Unit for Participatory Forestry (RUPFOR) - Joint Forest Management]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3075">'''Konrad Ott''' (born May 20, 1959) is a German [[philosopher]] with a special interest in [[discourse ethics]] and [[environmental ethics]]. Ott is currently Professor for Philosophy and Ethics of the Environment at [[Kiel University]]. From 2000 to 2008 he was a member of the [[:de:Sachverständigenrat für Umweltfragen|German Advisory Council on the Environment]]. From 1997 to 2012 Ott was professor for environmental ethics at the [[University of Greifswald]]. Ott is also known as a critic of mass migration to Europe. Regarding migration from Africa ''via'' the Mediterranean, Ott postulated in 2018 that "this route must be dried out"; the merit of Italy's Home Office Secretary [[Matteo Salvini]] should be acknowledged "at least [...] to have made this route less attractive".&lt;ref&gt;Konrad Ott: ''"NGOs sollen nicht moralisch überheblich werden"'' [''"NGOs should not revel in moral arrogance"'']. In: ''Der Standard'' (Vienna/Austria), 3/4 November 2018, p. 11: "diese Route auszutrocknen"; "immerhin [...] die Route unattraktiver gemacht".&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2447">'''Llinás's law''', or '''law of no interchangeability of neurons''', is a statement in [[neuroscience]] made by [[Rodolfo Llinás]] in 1989, during his Luigi Galvani Award Lecture at the Fidia Research Foundation Neuroscience Award Lectures .&lt;ref&gt;Llinás, Rodolfo (1990). "Intrinsic Electrical Properties of Mammalian Neurons and CNS Function". Fidia Research Foundation Neuroscience Award Lectures, 1988–1989 (Raven Press) 4:  p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A [[neuron]] of a given kind (e.g. a [[thalamus|thalamic]] cell) cannot be functionally replaced by one of another type (e.g. an [[Inferior olivary nucleus|inferior ollivary]] cell) even if their [[synapse|synaptic]] connectivity and the type of [[neurotransmitter]] outputs are identical. (The difference is that the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of thalamic cells are extraordinarily different from those of inferior olivary neurons).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Llinás|first=Rodolfo R.|date=2014|title=Intrinsic electrical properties of mammalian neurons and CNS function: a historical perspective|journal=Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience|volume=8|pages=320|doi=10.3389/fncel.2014.00320|issn=1662-5102|pmc=4219458|pmid=25408634}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The statement of this law is a consequence of an article written by Rodolfo Llinas himself in 1988 and published in [[Science (journal)|Science]] with the title "The Intrinsic Electrophysiological Properties of Mammalian Neurons: Insights into Central Nervous System Function",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Llinas|first=R. R.|date=1988-12-23|title=The intrinsic electrophysiological properties of mammalian neurons: insights into central nervous system function|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/242/4886/1654|journal=Science|language=en|volume=242|issue=4886|pages=1654–1664|doi=10.1126/science.3059497|issn=0036-8075|pmid=3059497}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is considered a watershed due to its more than 2000 citations in the scientific literature, marking a major shift in viewpoint in neuroscience around the functional aspect. Until then, the prevailing belief in neuroscience was that just the connections and [[neurotransmitters]] released by neurons was enough to determine their function. Research by Llinás and colleagues during the 80's with vertebrates revealed this previously held dogma was wrong.

The '''Master of Management: Co-operatives and Credit Unions''' ('''MMCCU''') is a [[master's degree]] in [[co-operative]] and [[credit union]] administration. The degree is currently offered solely through an international program at the Sobey School of Business at [[Saint Mary's University (Halifax)|Saint Mary's University]] in [[Halifax (former city), Nova Scotia|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref name="cg"&gt;Livingston, Jane. [http://www.cooperativegrocer.coop/articles/index.php?id=657 Co-op Management Master’s Degree Program: Lessons Learned.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920034748/http://cooperativegrocer.coop/articles/index.php?id=657 |date=2010-09-20 }} ''Cooperative Grocer.'' #124 May - June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The program is designed for students entering [[business management]] and degree applicants come from diverse academic disciplines.

The MMCCU degree is designed to improve students' understanding of management within the context of the [[Co-operative economics|co-operative economic model]].&lt;ref name="post"/&gt; Similar to the more traditional [[MBA]], students are introduced to economics, accounting, human resources, marketing, technology, [[best practice]]s and equity management. The MMCCU also teaches the history and philosophy of the co-operative management model and hosts international symposia.&lt;ref&gt;Crowell, Erbin.

Volume II, Issue 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The MMCCU degree program was created in 2002 by a partnership between Saint Mary's University and the Co-operative Management Education Co-operative (CMEC), a federation of over 50 cooperatives. This co-operative consists of co-operatives, individuals, as well as educational and support institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cooperativegrocer.coop/articles/index.php?id=944 A Cooperative Approach to Management Education.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100921055629/http://cooperativegrocer.coop/articles/index.php?id=944 |date=2010-09-21 }} ''Cooperative Grocer.'' #148 May - June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.victoria.coop/files/mmccu-newsletter%202010%20Jan.pdf Come Together, Right Now.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718162134/http://education.victoria.coop/files/mmccu-newsletter%202010%20Jan.pdf |date=2011-07-18 }} ''Cooperative Management Advantage.'' Volume 4, Issue 2. January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Members donated nearly $1 million to fund the program and the curriculum was approved by the Maritime Provinces' Higher Education Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Novkovic|first1=Sonja|last2=Holm|first2=Wendy|title=Co-operative networks as a source of organizational innovation|journal=International Journal of Co-operative Management|date=October 2012|volume=6|issue=1|page=55|url=http://theholmteam.ca/Co-operative.Mgmt.Journal.Oct.2012.pdf#page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was founded by Saint Mary's University Professor John Chamard&lt;ref name="post"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Mark|title=Consider your options|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/related/topics/Consider+your+options/2044603/story.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20101015161334/http://www.nationalpost.com/related/topics/Consider+your+options/2044603/story.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=October 15, 2010|work=[[National Post]]|date=September 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and took its first students in 2003.

Volume 40, Number 2. August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; While other methods of training in co-operatives exist,{{ref|a|1}} the MMCCU is the only English-language master's degree in co-operative management by a business school that is internationally accredited.&lt;ref name="Ratner"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ratner|first1=Carl|title=Cooperation, Community, and Co-ops in a Global Era|date=2013|publisher=Springer|location=New York, NY|isbn=1-4614-5825-0|page=156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g5WTgR3mN2oC&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;dq=%22master%20of%20management%22%20co-operatives&amp;pg=PA156#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sobey School of Business, the home of the MMCCU, has accreditation through the [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]] (AACSB).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aacsb.net/eweb/DynamicPage.aspx?Site=AACSB&amp;WebKey=00E50DA9-8BB0-4A32-B7F7-0A92E98DF5C6 List of Accredited Schools by Country] ''[[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Method of delivery===
The MMCCU is an on-line only program using the [[Blackboard Learning System]] virtual environment. With the exception of the orientation and field trip, the classes only meet on-line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Livingston|first1=Jane|title=Mastering Co-op Management|journal=[[Rural Cooperatives]]|date=March 2006|volume=73|issue=2|pages=23–25, 34|url=http://www.rd.usda.gov/files/CoopMag-mar06.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students move through the program as a cohort, so once a student starts they must commit to the entire program or drop-out.

==Program content==
The [[Cooperative Principles]] are central to MMCCU curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacPherson|first1=Ian|title=New Opportunities for Co-operatives: New Opportunities for People|date=2012|publisher=University of Helsinki|isbn=978-952-10-6514-9|page=366|chapter=Finding Traction on a Slippery Path: Teaching about Co-operatives, the Co-operative Movement, and Co-operation in Canada|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/ruralia/ica2011/presentations/MacPherson.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First year===
In the first semester, students complete the following:
*''Philosophical Philosophical Origins and Historical Evolution of Co-operative Governance and Business Practice'' offers a survey of the historical development of co-operation from the dawn of the Industrial Age and market capitalism to the present day. Students learn about and practice creating [[Social accounting|social audits]].
*''The Emerging Global Economy and Society from a Co-operative Perspective I'' provides an overview of globalization and its effect on the world economy. In addition, students examine examples of global co-operation.
*''Comparative Co-operative Practice I: Variety and Range of Co-operative Business''. This course builds off of the history of the first semester. Students learn about the different sectors of co-operation: consumer, producer, housing, financial and worker and multi-stakeholder co-operatives.
*''Co-operative Financial Analysis and Management I'' provides students with a basic understanding of [[managerial accounting]] and [[financial accounting]]. Students learn the basic of an income statement, balance statement, cash flow analysis and equity statement. Students also learn to conduct a financial analysis.

===Second year===
*''The Emerging Global Economy and Society from a Co-operative Perspective II''.
*''Field Research: Study Visits to Exemplars of Excellent Co-operative Business Practice''. Students learn about the region of the visit and the co-operative society prior to their visit. The remainder of the course examines the lessons learned during the trip and how it might relate to their co-operatives.
*''Comparative Co-operative Practice II: Co-operative Innovations and Best Practice'' considers different co-operatives on an individual level in order to understand how different co-operators solve similar problems.
*''Technology, Communication and Co-operation'' examines the role of technology in society and how co-operatives might use it to succeed.

====Field trip====
The field trip currently alternates between two locations. The first is the [[Mondragon Corporation|Mondragon Co-operative]] in northern [[Spain]].&lt;ref name="ica"&gt;Parnell, Edgar. [http://www.ica.coop/publications/digest/38-digest.pdf Masters of Management - Co-ops and Credit Unions.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231155736/http://www.ica.coop/publications/digest/38-digest.pdf |date=2010-12-31 }} ''[[International Co-operative Alliance|ICA Digest]].'' Issue 38. March 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Students spend 10 days studying the Mondragon Co-operative and learning about the culture of the region.

The second location involves the [[Emilia-Romagna]] region of [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="ica"/&gt; Students tour and study the worker co-operatives and co-operative federations of the region.

===Third year===
*''Marketing the Co-operative Advantage: Co-operative Education, Member Relations and Marketing''. This course examines basic [[Marketing strategy|marketing strategies]] and the [[Statement on the Co-operative Identity|co-operative identity]].
*''Co-operative Financial Analysis and Management II'', focuses on the role of equity in a co-operative. Students learn about equity development and how it interacts in a co-operative.
*''The Co-operative Management Approach I: Governance, Planning and Strategic Analysis''. Students learn about these three important areas of management through a co-operative lens.
*''The Co-operative Management Approach II: Leadership, Personnel and Management Style'', examines the role of [[human resources]] in a co-operative.

===Master's project===
The last year of the master's program has been dedicated to the project. Students are expected to develop a change in their co-operative based on the lessons learned through their program.

===Financial aid options===
The [[Sid Pobihushchy]] scholarship is available for students pursuing an MMCCU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frederictoncoop.nb.ca/eflyerforca.html Awards for 2010-2011.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526042343/http://www.frederictoncoop.nb.ca/eflyerforca.html |date=2011-05-26 }} ''Fredericton Co-op website.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Other means of financial aid will depend upon competitive grants and scholarships such as the Lemaire Scholarship provided by the [[Canadian Association for Study in Co-operatives]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usaskstudies.coop/teaching/scholarships/CASC.php#lemaire Lemaire Co-operative Studies Awards.] ''Centre for the Study of Co-operatives.'', private grants and the specific awards available in one's home country.

==Reception==
A survey of co-operative managers who completed the degree found that while they were satisfied with the program, only 40% of respondents were able to implement ideas they learned in their workplaces.&lt;ref name="Ratner"/&gt;

==Notes==
{{note|a}}[[CooperationWorks!]] trains cooperative developers in the United States. The [[University of Toronto]] offers an undergraduate program in co-operatives, the [[University of Wisconsin]] offers a survey course on co-operatives, and the [[University of Massachusetts]] offers an undergraduate certificate in applied economic research on cooperatives.

[[File:Ringside.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Class ring|graduation ring]] with the Master of Science designation]]

A '''Master of Science''' ({{lang-la|Magister Scientiae}}; abbreviated '''MS''', '''M.S.''', '''MSc''', '''M.Sc.''', '''SM''', '''S.M.''', '''ScM''' or '''Sc.M.''') is a [[master's degree]] in the field of science awarded by [[University|universities]] in many countries or a person holding such a degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/master_of_science|title=Master of Science|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|work=Oxford Living Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the [[Master of Arts]] degree, the Master of Science degree is typically granted for studies in sciences, engineering and medicine and is usually for programs that are more focused on scientific and mathematical subjects; however, different universities have different conventions and may also offer the degree for fields typically considered within the humanities and social sciences. While it ultimately depends upon the specific program, earning a Master of Science degree typically includes writing a [[thesis]].

==Algeria==
Algeria follows the [[Bologna Process]].

==Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Panamá, Perú and Uruguay==
In [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Ecuador]], [[Mexico]], [[Colombia]], [[Panamá]], [[Perú]] and [[Uruguay]], the Master of Science or Magister is a postgraduate degree of two to four years of duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2014-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The admission to a Master's program (Spanish: ''[[Maestría]]''; Portuguese: ''Mestrado'') requires the full completion of a four to five years long [[undergraduate degree]], [[bachelor's degree]] or a [[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate]]'s degree of the same length. Defense of a research thesis is required. All master's degrees qualify for a doctorate program.

==Australia==
Australian universities commonly have coursework or research-based Master of Science courses for graduate students. They typically run for 1–2 years full-time, with varying amounts of research involved.

==Bangladesh==
In Bangladesh, all universities, including [[Bangladesh Agricultural University]] [[Jagannath University]], [[Dhaka University]], [[University of Chittagong]], [[Jahangirnagar University]], [[Islamic University, Bangladesh]] and [[Rajshahi University]] have Master of Science courses as postgraduate degrees. After passing Bachelor of Science, any student becomes eligible to study in this discipline.

==Canada==
In Canada, Master of Science (MSc) degrees may be entirely course-based, entirely research-based or (more typically) a mixture. Master's programs typically take one to three years to complete and the completion of a scientific [[thesis]] is often required. Admission to a master's program is contingent upon holding a four-year university bachelor's degree. Some universities require a master's degree in order to progress to a doctoral program (PhD).

===Quebec===
In the province of Quebec, the Master of Science follows the same principles as in the rest of Canada. There is one exception, however, regarding admission to a master's program. Since Québécois students complete two to three years of [[College education in Quebec|college]] before entering university, they have the opportunity to complete a bachelor's degree in three years instead of four. Some undergraduate degrees such as the [[Bachelor of Education]] and the [[Bachelor of Engineering]] requires four years of studies. Following the obtention of their bachelor's degree, students can be admitted into a graduate program to eventually obtain a [[master's degree]].

==Chile==

Commonly the Chilean universities have used "Magíster" for a [[master degree]], but other than that is similar to the rest of South America.

==Czech Republic, Slovakia==
Like all EU member states, the Czech Republic and Slovakia follow the Bologna Process. The Czech Republic and Slovakia are using two master's degree systems. Both award a title of ''Mgr.'' or ''Ing.'' to be used before the name.
The older system requires a 5-year program. The new system takes only 2 years but requires a previously completed 3-year bachelor program (a ''Bc.'' title). It is required to write a thesis (in both master and bachelor program) and also to pass final exams. It is mostly the case that the final exams cover the main study areas of the whole study program, i.e. a student is required to prove his/her knowledge in many subjects he attended during the 2 resp. 3 years.

==Egypt==
The Master of Science (M.Sc.) is an academic degree for a post-graduate candidates or researchers, it usually takes from 4 to 7 years after passing the Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree. Master programs are awarded in many sciences in the [[Egyptian Universities]]. A completion of the degree requires finishing a [[pre-master]] studies followed by a scientific [[thesis]] or [[research]]. All M.Sc. degree holders are allowable to take a step forward in the academic track to get the [[PhD]] degree.

==Finland==
Like all EU member states, Finland follows the Bologna Process. The Master of Science (M.Sc.) academic degree usually follows the Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) studies which typically last five years. For the completion of both the bachelor and the master studies the student must accumulate a total of 300 ECTS credits, thus most Masters programs are two-year programs with 120 credits. The completion of a scientific [[thesis]] is required.

==Germany==
Like all EU member states, Germany follows the Bologna Process. The Master of Science (M.Sc.) academic degree replaces the once common ''[[Diplom]]'' or ''[[Magister (degree)|Magister]]'' programs that typically lasted four to five years. It is awarded in science related studies with a high percentage of mathematics. For the completion the student must accumulate 300 ECTS Credits, thus most Masters programs are two-year programs with 120 credits. The completion of a scientific [[thesis]] is required.

==Southeastern Europe==
In Slavic countries in European southeast (particularly former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavian]] republics), the education system was largely based on the German university system (largely due to the presence and influence of the [[Austria-Hungary Empire]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in the region). Prior to the implementation of the [[Bologna Process]], academic university studies comprised a 4-5 year long graduate ''[[Diplom]]'' program, which could have been followed by a 2-4 year long ''[[Magister (degree)|Magister]]'' program and then later with 2-4 year long ''[[Doctoral studies]]''.

After the Bologna Process implementation, again based on the German implementation, ''Diplom'' titles and programs were replaced by the M.Sc. and M.A. programs (depending on the field of study). The studies are structured such that a ''Master'' program lasts long enough for the student to accumulate a total of 300 ECTS credits, so its duration would depend on a number of credits acquired during the Bachelor studies. Pre-Bologna ''Magister'' programs were abandoned - after earning an M.Sc/M.A. degree and satisfying other academic requirements a student could proceed to earn a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree directly.

==Guyana==
In Guyana, all universities, including [[University of Guyana]], [[Texila American University]], [[American International School of Medicine]] have Master of Science courses as postgraduate degrees. Students who have completed undergraduate Bachelor of Science degree are eligible to study in this discipline

==Iran==
In Iran, similar to Canada, Master of Science (MSc) or in Iranian form ''[[Karshenasi-arshad]]'' degrees may be entirely course-based, entirely research-based or sometimes a mixture. Master's programs typically take two to three years to complete and the completion of a scientific [[thesis]] is often required.

==Ireland==
Like all EU member states, Ireland follows the Bologna Process. In Ireland, Master of Science (MSc) may be course-based with a research component or entirely research based. The program is most commonly a one-year program and a thesis is required for both course-based and research based degrees.

==Israel==
In Israel, Master of Science (MSc) may be entirely course-based or include research. The program is most commonly a two-year program and a thesis is required only for research based degrees.

==India==

In India, universities offer MSc programs usually in science subjects. Generally speaking, in India, post-graduate scientific courses lead to MSc degree while post-graduate engineering courses lead to ME or MTech degree. For example, a master's in automotive engineering would normally be an ME or MTech, while a master's in physics would be an MSc. A few top universities also offer undergraduate programs leading to a master's degree which is known as integrated masters.

A Master of Science in Engineering (M.Sc.Eng.) degree is also offered in India. It is usually structured as an engineering research degree, lesser than [[Ph.D.]] and considered to be parallel to [[M.Phil.]] degree in humanities and science. Some institutes such as [[IITs]] offer an MS degree for postgraduate engineering courses. This degree is considered a research-oriented degree where as MTech or ME degree is usually not a research degree in India. M.S. degree is also awarded by various [[IISER]]s which are one of the top institutes in India.

==Italy==
Like all EU member states, Italy follows the Bologna Process. The degree ''Master of Science'' is awarded in the Italian form, ''[[Laurea Magistrale]]'' (formerly ''Laurea specialistica''; before the introduction of the ''Laurea'' the corresponding degree was ''[[Laurea]] quinquennale'' or ''Vecchio Ordinamento'').

==Nepal==

In Nepal, universities offer the master of science degree usually in science and engineering areas. [[Tribhuvan University]] offers MSc degree for all the science and engineering courses. [[Pokhara University]] offers ME for engineering and MSc for science. [[Kathmandu University]] offers MS by Research and ME degrees for science and engineering.

==Netherlands==
Like all EU member states, the Netherlands follows the Bologna Process. A graduate who is awarded the title Master of Science (abbreviated as MSc) may still use the previously awarded Dutch title ''ingenieur'' (abbreviated as ir.) (for graduates who followed a technical or agricultural program), ''meester'' (abbreviated as mr.) (for graduates who followed an LLM law program) or ''doctorandus'' (abbreviated as drs.)(in all other cases).

==New Zealand==
New Zealand universities commonly have coursework or research-based Master of Science courses for graduate students. They typically run for 2 years full-time, with varying amounts of research involved.

==Norway==
Norway follows the Bologna Process. For engineering, the Master of Science academic degree has been recently introduced and has replaced the previous award forms "[[Sivilingeniør]]" (engineer, a.k.a. engineering master) and "Hovedfag" (academic master). Both were awarded after 5 years university-level studies and required the completion of a scientific thesis.

"Siv.ing", is a protected title exclusively awarded to engineering students who completed a five-year education at The Norwegian University of Science and Technology ({{lang-no|Norges teknisk-naturvitenskapelige universitet}}, NTNU) or other universities.  Historically there was no bachelor's degree involved and today's program is a five years master's degree education. The "Siv.ing" title is in the process of being phased out, replaced by (for now, complemented by) the "M.Sc." title. By and large, "Siv.ing" is a title tightly being held on to for the sake of tradition. In academia, the new program offers separate three-year bachelor and two-year master programs. It is awarded in the natural sciences, mathematics and computer science fields. The completion of a scientific thesis is required. All master's degrees are designed to certify a level of education and qualify for a doctorate program.

Master of Science in Business is the English title for those taking a higher business degree, "Siviløkonom" in Norwegian. In addition, there is, for example, the 'Master of Business Administration' (MBA), a practically oriented master's degree in business, but with less mathematics and econometrics, due to its less specific entry requirements and smaller focus on research.

==Pakistan==
Pakistan inherited its conventions pertaining to higher education from [[United Kingdom]] after [[Partition of India|independence in 1947]]. Master of Science degree is typically abbreviated as M.Sc. (as in the United Kingdom) and which is awarded after 16 years of education (equivalent with a bachelor's degree in the USA and many other countries). Recently, in pursuance to some of the reforms by the [[Higher Education Commission of Pakistan]] (the regulatory body of higher education in Pakistan), the traditional 2-year Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree has been replaced by the 4-year Bachelor of Science degree, which is abbreviated as B.S. to enable the Pakistani degrees with the rest of the world. Subsequently, students who pass 4-year B.S. degree that is awarded after 16 years of education are then eligible to apply for M.S. degree, which is considered at par with Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.) degree.

==Poland==
Like all EU member states, Poland follows the Bologna Process. The Polish equivalent of Master of Science is "magister" (abbreviated "mgr", written pre-nominally much like "Dr"). Starting in 2001, the MSc programs typically lasting 5 years began to be replaced as below:
* 3-year associates programs (termed "licencjat". No abbreviated pre-nominal or title.)
* 3.5-year engineer programs (termed "inżynier", utilizing the pre-nominal abbreviation "inż.")
* 2-year master programs open to both "licencjat" and "inż." graduates.
* 1.5-year master programs open only to "inż." graduates.
The degree is awarded predominantly in the natural sciences, mathematics, computer science, economics, as well as in the arts and other disciplines. Those who graduate from an engineering program prior to being awarded a master's degree are allowed to use the "mgr inż." pre-nominal ("master engineer"). This is most common in engineering and agricultural fields of study. Defense of a research [[thesis]] is required. All master's degrees in Poland qualify for a [[doctorate]] program.

==Russia==
The title of "master" was introduced by Alexander I at 24 January 1803. The Master had an intermediate position between the candidate and doctor according to the decree "About colleges structure". The master's degree was abolished from 1917 to 1934. Russia follows the [[Bologna Process]] for higher education in Europe since 2011.

==Spain==
Like all EU member states, Spain follows the Bologna Process. The Master of Science (MSc) degree is a program officially recognized by the [[Ministry of Education (Spain)|Spanish Ministry of Education]]. It usually involves 1 or 2 years of full-time study. It is targeted at pre-experience candidates who have recently finished their undergraduate studies. An MSc degree can be awarded in every field of study. An MSc degree is required in order to progress to a PhD. MSci, MPhil and DEA are equivalent in Spain.

==Sweden==
Like all EU member states, Sweden follows the Bologna Process. The Master of Science academic degree has, like in Germany, recently been introduced in Sweden. Students studying Master of Science in Engineering programs are rewarded both the English Master of Science Degree, but also the Swedish equivalent "Teknologisk masterexamen". Whilst "Civilingenjör" is an at least five year long education&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kth.se/utbildning/civilingenjor/datateknik|title=Datateknik, civilingenjör 300 hp  - KTH|author=|date=|website=www.kth.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;   .

==Syria==
The Master of Science is a degree that can be studied only in public universities. The program is usually 2 years, but it can be extended to 3 or 4 years, the student is required to pass a specific bachelor's degree to attend a specific master of science degree program, the master of science is mostly a research master (except for some types of programs held with cooperation of foreign universities), The student should attend some courses in the first year of the master then he/she should prepare a research thesis. Publishing two research papers is recommended and will increase the final evaluation grade.

==United Kingdom==
The Master of Science (MSc) is typically a taught postgraduate degree, involving lectures, examinations and a project dissertation (normally taking up a third of the program). Master's programs usually involve a minimum of 1 year of full-time study (180 UK credits, of which 150 must be at master's level) and sometimes up to 2 years of full-time study (or the equivalent period part-time).&lt;ref name="QAA master's"&gt;{{cite web|title=Master's Degree Characteristics Statement |publisher=[[Quality Assurance Agency]]|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/publications/information-and-guidance/publication?PubID=2977#.WK59n38WI2g|accessdate=23 February 2017|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taught master's degrees are normally classified into Pass, Merit and Distinction (although some universities do not give Merit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.postgrad.com/advice/masters_programs/msc_degree_classification/|title=MSc Classification|publisher=Postgrad.com|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some universities also offer MSc by research programs, where a longer project or set of projects is undertaken full-time; master's degrees by research are normally pass/fail, although some universities may offer a distinction.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.postgrad.com/advice/masters_programs/masters_degree_grades/|title=Masters Degree Grades|publisher=Postgrad.com|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-research-mathematics?wssl=1|title=MSc by Research in Mathematics|publisher=[[University of Oxford]]|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more recent Master ''in'' Science (MSci or M.Sci.) degree (Master of Natural Science at the [[University of Cambridge]]), is an undergraduate (UG) level integrated master's degree offered by UK institutions since the 1990s. It is offered as a first degree with the first three (four in Scotland) years similar to a BSc course and a final year (120 UK credits) at master's level, including a dissertation.&lt;ref name="QAA master's"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FHEQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Frameworks for Higher Education Qualifications of UK Degree-Awarding Bodies|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/publications/information-and-guidance/publication?PubID=2843#.WK5-J38WI2g|publisher=[[Quality Assurance Agency]]|accessdate=23 February 2017|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final MSci qualification is thus at the same level as a traditional MSc.

==United States==
The ''Master of Science'' (''Magister Scientiæ'') degree is normally a full-time two-year degree often abbreviated "MS" or "M.S." It is the primary type in most subjects and may be entirely course-based, entirely research-based or (more typically) a combination of the two. The combination often involves writing and defending a thesis or completing a research project which represents the culmination of the material learned.

Admission to a master's program is normally contingent upon holding a [[bachelor's degree]] and progressing to a [[doctorate|doctoral]] program may require a master's degree. In some fields or graduate programs, work on a doctorate can begin immediately after the bachelor's degree. Some programs provide for a joint bachelor's and master's degree after about five years. Some universities use the Latin degree names and due to the flexibility of [[Latin grammar|word order in Latin]], ''Artium Magister'' (A.M.) or ''Scientiæ Magister'' (S.M. or Sc.M.) may be used in some institutions.

Mathematicians seek and use [[patterns]]&lt;ref name=future/&gt;&lt;ref name=devlin/&gt; to formulate new [[conjecture]]s; they resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by [[mathematical proof]]. When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, then mathematical reasoning can provide insight or predictions about nature. Through the use of [[abstraction (mathematics)|abstraction]] and [[logic]], mathematics developed from [[counting]], [[calculation]], [[measurement]], and the systematic study of the [[shape]]s and [[motion (physics)|motions]] of physical objects. Practical mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as [[History of Mathematics|written records]] exist. The research required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry.

[[Logic|Rigorous arguments]] first appeared in [[Greek mathematics]], most notably in [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''. Since the pioneering work of [[Giuseppe Peano]] (1858–1932), [[David Hilbert]] (1862–1943), and others [[Foundations of mathematics|on axiomatic systems in the late 19th&amp;nbsp;century]], it has become customary to view mathematical research as establishing [[truth]] by [[Mathematical rigor|rigorous]] [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] from appropriately chosen [[axiom]]s and [[definition]]s. Mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the [[Renaissance]], when mathematical innovations interacting with new [[timeline of scientific discoveries|scientific discoveries]] led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has continued to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Eves, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematics is essential in many fields, including [[natural science]], engineering, medicine, finance and the [[social sciences]]. [[Applied mathematics]] has led to entirely new mathematical disciplines, such as statistics and [[game theory]]. Mathematicians engage in [[pure mathematics]], or mathematics for its own sake, without having any application in mind. Practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wigner1960 /&gt;

The history of mathematics can be seen as an ever-increasing series of [[abstraction (mathematics)|abstractions]]. The first abstraction, which is shared by many animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Abstract representations of numbers in the animal and human brain |journal=Trends in Neurosciences |volume=21 |issue=8 |date=Aug 1998 |pages=355–61 |doi=10.1016/S0166-2236(98)01263-6 |pmid=9720604 |ref=harv |last1=Dehaene |first1=Stanislas |last2=Dehaene-Lambertz |first2=Ghislaine |last3=Cohen |first3=Laurent}}&lt;/ref&gt; was probably that of numbers: the realization that a collection of two apples and a collection of two oranges (for example) have something in common, namely quantity of their members.

As evidenced by [[tally sticks|tallies]] found on bone, in addition to recognizing how to [[counting|count]] physical objects, [[prehistoric]] peoples may have also recognized how to count abstract quantities, like time&amp;nbsp;– days, seasons, years.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Raymond L. Wilder, ''Evolution of Mathematical Concepts; an Elementary Study'', ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence for more complex mathematics does not appear until around 3000&amp;nbsp;[[Before Christ|BC]], when the [[Babylonia]]ns and Egyptians began using [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]] and [[geometry]] for taxation and other financial calculations, for building and construction, and for [[astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Kline 1990, Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The most ancient mathematical texts from [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] are from 2000–1800 BC. Many early texts mention [[Pythagorean triple]]s and so, by inference, the [[Pythagorean theorem]] seems to be the most ancient and widespread mathematical development after basic arithmetic and geometry. It is in [[Babylonian mathematics]] that [[elementary arithmetic]] ([[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]] and [[division (mathematics)|division]]) first appear in the archaeological record. The Babylonians also possessed a place-value system, and used a [[sexagesimal]] numeral system, still in use today for measuring angles and time.{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc="Mesopotamia" p. 24–27}}

Beginning in the 6th century BC with the [[Pythagoreans]], the [[Ancient Greeks]] began a systematic study of mathematics as a subject in its own right with [[Greek mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heath |first=Thomas Little |url=https://books.google.com/?id=drnY3Vjix3kC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=A History of Greek Mathematics: From Thales to Euclid |location=New York |publisher=Dover Publications |date=1981 |orig-year=originally published 1921 |isbn=978-0-486-24073-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 300 BC, [[Euclid]] introduced the [[axiomatic method]] still used in mathematics today, consisting of definition, axiom, theorem, and proof. His textbook ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' is widely considered the most successful and influential textbook of all time.{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc="Euclid of Alexandria" p. 119}} The greatest mathematician of antiquity is often held to be [[Archimedes]] (c. 287–212 BC) of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]].{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc="Archimedes of Syracuse" p. 120}} He developed formulas for calculating the surface area and volume of [[solids of revolution]] and used the [[method of exhaustion]] to calculate the [[area]] under the arc of a [[parabola]] with the [[Series (mathematics)|summation of an infinite series]], in a manner not too dissimilar from modern calculus.{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc="Archimedes of Syracuse" p. 130}} Other notable achievements of Greek mathematics are [[conic sections]] ([[Apollonius of Perga]], 3rd century BC),{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc="Apollonius of Perga" p. 145}} [[trigonometry]] ([[Hipparchus of Nicaea]] (2nd century BC),{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc= "Greek Trigonometry and Mensuration" p. 162}} and the beginnings of algebra ([[Diophantus]], 3rd century AD).{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc= "Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics" p. 180}}

The [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]] and the rules for the use of its operations, in use throughout the world today, evolved over the course of the first millennium AD in [[Indian mathematics|India]] and were transmitted to the [[Western world]] via [[Islamic mathematics]]. Other notable developments of Indian mathematics include the modern definition of [[sine]] and [[cosine]], and an early form of [[infinite series]].

[[File:Image-Al-Kitāb al-muḫtaṣar fī ḥisāb al-ğabr wa-l-muqābala.jpg|left|thumb|200px|A page from al-Khwārizmī's ''Algebra'']]
During the [[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age of Islam]], especially during the 9th and 10th&amp;nbsp;centuries, mathematics saw many important innovations building on Greek mathematics. The most notable achievement of [[Islamic mathematics]] was the development of [[algebra]]. Other notable achievements of the Islamic period are advances in [[spherical trigonometry]] and the addition of the [[decimal point]] to the Arabic numeral system. Many notable mathematicians from this period were Persian, such as [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi|Al-Khwarismi]], [[Omar Khayyam]] and [[Sharaf al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī]]. 

During the [[early modern period]], mathematics began to develop at an accelerating pace in [[Western Europe]]. The development of [[calculus]] by Newton and Leibniz in the 17th century revolutionized mathematics. [[Leonhard Euler]] was the most notable mathematician of the 18th century, contributing numerous theorems and discoveries. Perhaps the foremost mathematician of the 19th century was the German mathematician [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], who made numerous contributions to fields such as [[algebra]], [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], [[differential geometry and topology|differential geometry]], [[matrix theory]],[[number theory]], and [[statistics]]. In the early 20th century, [[Kurt Gödel]] transformed mathematics by publishing his [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorems]], which show that any axiomatic system that is consistent will contain unprovable propositions.

Mathematics has since been greatly extended, and there has been a fruitful interaction between mathematics and science, to the benefit of both. Mathematical discoveries continue to be made today. According to Mikhail B. Sevryuk, in the January&amp;nbsp;2006 issue of the ''[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]]'', "The number of papers and books included in the ''[[Mathematical Reviews]]'' database since 1940 (the first year of operation of MR) is now more than 1.9&amp;nbsp;million, and more than 75&amp;nbsp;thousand items are added to the database each year. The overwhelming majority of works in this ocean contain new mathematical [[theorem]]s and their [[mathematical proof|proofs]]."{{sfn|Sevryuk|2006|pp=101–09}}

===Etymology===
The word ''mathematics'' comes from [[Ancient Greek]] μάθημα (''máthēma''), meaning "that which is learnt",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=mathematic |publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=mathematic&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307093926/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=mathematic&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |archivedate=March 7, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; "what one gets to know", hence also "study" and "science". The word for "mathematics" came to have the narrower and more technical meaning "mathematical study" even in Classical times.&lt;ref&gt;Both senses can be found in Plato. {{LSJ|maqhmatiko/s|μαθηματική|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its adjective is {{lang|grc|μαθηματικός}} (''mathēmatikós''), meaning "related to learning" or "studious", which likewise further came to mean "mathematical". In particular, {{lang|grc|μαθηματικὴ τέχνη}} (''mathēmatikḗ tékhnē''), {{lang-la|ars mathematica}}, meant "the mathematical art".

Similarly, one of the two main schools of thought in [[Pythagoreanism]] was known as the ''mathēmatikoi'' (μαθηματικοί)—which at the time meant "teachers" rather than "mathematicians" in the modern sense.

In Latin, and in English until around 1700, the term ''mathematics'' more commonly meant "astrology" (or sometimes "astronomy") rather than "mathematics"; the meaning gradually changed to its present one from about 1500 to 1800. This has resulted in several mistranslations. For example, [[Saint Augustine]]'s warning that Christians should beware of ''mathematici'', meaning astrologers, is sometimes mistranslated as a condemnation of mathematicians.&lt;ref name="Boas"&gt;{{cite book | title=Lion Hunting and Other Mathematical Pursuits: A Collection of Mathematics, Verse, and Stories by the Late Ralph P. Boas, Jr | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Boas, Ralph | authorlink=Ralph P. Boas Jr. | year=1995 | orig-year=1991 | page=257 | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f-EWj5WtQHgC&amp;pg=PA257 | chapter=What Augustine Didn't Say About Mathematicians}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The apparent plural form in English, like the French plural form {{lang|fr|les mathématiques}} (and the less commonly used singular derivative {{lang|fr|la mathématique}}), goes back to the Latin neuter plural {{lang|la|mathematica}} ([[Cicero]]), based on the Greek plural {{lang|el|τὰ μαθηματικά}} (''ta mathēmatiká''), used by [[Aristotle]] (384–322&amp;nbsp;BC), and meaning roughly "all things mathematical"; although it is plausible that English borrowed only the adjective ''mathematic(al)'' and formed the noun ''mathematics'' anew, after the pattern of ''[[physics]]'' and ''[[metaphysics]]'', which were inherited from Greek.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology]]'', ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', ''sub'' "mathematics", "mathematic", "mathematics"&lt;/ref&gt; In English, the noun ''mathematics'' takes a singular verb. It is often shortened to ''maths'' or, in North America, ''math''.&lt;ref name=maths&gt;[http://oed.com/view/Entry/114982 "maths, ''n.''"] and [http://oed.com/view/Entry/114962 "math, ''n.3''"].

Mathematics has [[definitions of mathematics|no generally accepted definition]].&lt;ref name=Mura/&gt;&lt;ref name=Runge/&gt; [[Aristotle]] defined mathematics as "the science of quantity", and this definition prevailed until the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Franklin"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mbn35b2ghgkC&amp;pg=PA104#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Philosophy of Mathematics |last=Franklin |first=James |date=2009-07-08 |isbn=9780080930589 |page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564–1642) said, "The universe cannot be read until we have learned the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is written. It is written in mathematical language, and the letters are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures, without which means it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word. Without these, one is wandering about in a dark labyrinth."&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus du Sautoy]], ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00sr3fm A Brief History of Mathematics: 1. Newton and Leibniz] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121206092629/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00sr3fm |date=December 6, 2012 }}'', [[BBC Radio 4]], September 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (1777–1855) referred to mathematics as "the Queen of the Sciences".&lt;ref name="Waltershausen"&gt;Waltershausen, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Peirce]] (1809–1880) called mathematics "the science that draws necessary conclusions".&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; David Hilbert said of mathematics: "We are not speaking here of arbitrariness in any sense. Mathematics is not like a game whose tasks are determined by arbitrarily stipulated rules. Rather, it is a conceptual system possessing internal necessity that can only be so and by no means otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;Hilbert, D. (1919–20), Natur und Mathematisches Erkennen: Vorlesungen, gehalten 1919–1920 in Göttingen. Nach der Ausarbeitung von Paul Bernays (Edited and with an English introduction by David E. Rowe), p. 14, Basel, Birkhäuser (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Einstein]] (1879–1955) stated that "as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality."&lt;ref name=certain/&gt;

Starting in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, when the study of mathematics increased in rigor and began to address abstract topics such as [[group theory]] and [[projective geometry]], which have no clear-cut relation to quantity and measurement, mathematicians and philosophers began to propose a variety of new definitions.&lt;ref name="Cajori"&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Mathematics |publisher=American Mathematical Society (1991 reprint) |author=Cajori, Florian |authorlink=Florian Cajori |year=1893 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mGJRjIC9fZgC&amp;pg=PA285 285–86] |isbn=978-0-8218-2102-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these definitions emphasize the deductive character of much of mathematics, some emphasize its abstractness, some emphasize certain topics within mathematics.

Three leading types of definition of mathematics are called [[logicist]], [[intuitionist]], and [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalist]], each reflecting a different philosophical school of thought.&lt;ref name=Snapper&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/2689412 |title=The Three Crises in Mathematics: Logicism, Intuitionism, and Formalism |journal=Mathematics Magazine |date=September 1979 |first=Ernst |last=Snapper |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=207–16 |id= |jstor=2689412 |ref=harv|bibcode=1975MathM..48...12G }}&lt;/ref&gt; All have severe problems, none has widespread acceptance, and no reconciliation seems possible.&lt;ref name=Snapper/&gt;

An early definition of mathematics in terms of logic was [[Benjamin Peirce]]'s "the science that draws necessary conclusions" (1870).&lt;ref name="Peirce"&gt;{{cite book |title=Linear Associative Algebra |author=Peirce, Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin Peirce |year=1882 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=De0GAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906135700/https://books.google.com/books?id=De0GAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=September 6, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] advanced the philosophical program known as [[logicism]], and attempted to prove that all mathematical concepts, statements, and principles can be defined and proved entirely in terms of [[symbolic logic]]. A logicist definition of mathematics is Russell's "All Mathematics is Symbolic Logic" (1903).&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kj0a_aV2mxIC&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=5|title=The Principles of Mathematics|year=1903|last1=Russell|first1=Bertrand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intuitionist]] definitions, developing from the philosophy of mathematician [[L. E. J. Brouwer]], identify mathematics with certain mental phenomena. An example of an intuitionist definition is "Mathematics is the mental activity which consists in carrying out constructs one after the other."&lt;ref name=Snapper/&gt; A peculiarity of intuitionism is that it rejects some mathematical ideas considered valid according to other definitions. In particular, while other philosophies of mathematics allow objects that can be proved to exist even though they cannot be constructed, intuitionism allows only mathematical objects that one can actually construct.

[[Formalism (mathematics)|Formalist]] definitions identify mathematics with its symbols and the rules for operating on them. [[Haskell Curry]] defined mathematics simply as "the science of formal systems".&lt;ref name="Curry"&gt;{{cite book |title=Outlines of a Formalist Philosophy of Mathematics |publisher=Elsevier |author=Curry, Haskell |authorlink=Haskell Curry |year=1951 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tZHrBQgp1bkC 56] |isbn=978-0-444-53368-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[formal system]] is a set of symbols, or ''tokens'', and some ''rules'' telling how the tokens may be combined into ''formulas''. In formal systems, the word ''axiom'' has a special meaning, different from the ordinary meaning of "a self-evident truth". In formal systems, an axiom is a combination of tokens that is included in a given formal system without needing to be derived using the rules of the system.

===Mathematics as science===
[[File:Carl Friedrich Gauss.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], known as the prince of mathematicians]]
The German mathematician [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] referred to mathematics as "the Queen of the Sciences".&lt;ref name="Waltershausen"/&gt; More recently, [[Marcus du Sautoy]] has called mathematics "the Queen of Science&amp;nbsp;... the main driving force behind scientific discovery".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Nicolas Bourbaki |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00stcgv |access-date=26 October 2017 |series=A Brief History of Mathematics |first=Marcus |last=du Sautoy |station=BBC Radio 4 |date=25 June 2010 |time=min. 12:50 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216050402/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00stcgv |archivedate=December 16, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the original Latin ''Regina Scientiarum'', as well as in German ''Königin der Wissenschaften'', the word corresponding to ''science'' means a "field of knowledge", and this was the original meaning of "science" in English, also; mathematics is in this sense a field of knowledge. The specialization restricting the meaning of "science" to ''[[natural science]]'' follows the rise of [[Baconian method|Baconian science]], which contrasted "natural science" to [[scholasticism]], the [[Organon|Aristotelean method]] of inquiring from [[first principles]]. The role of empirical experimentation and observation is negligible in mathematics, compared to natural sciences such as [[biology]], [[chemistry]], or [[physics]]. [[Albert Einstein]] stated that "as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality."&lt;ref name=certain&gt;Einstein, p. 28. The quote is Einstein's answer to the question: "How can it be that mathematics, being after all a product of human thought which is independent of experience, is so admirably appropriate to the objects of reality?" This question was inspired by [[Eugene Wigner]]'s paper "[[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences]]".&lt;/ref&gt;

Many philosophers believe that mathematics is not experimentally [[falsifiability|falsifiable]], and thus not a science according to the definition of [[Karl Popper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Out of Their Minds: The Lives and Discoveries of 15 Great Computer Scientists |author1=Shasha, Dennis Elliot |author2=Lazere, Cathy A. |publisher=Springer |year=1998 |page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 1930s [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] convinced many mathematicians{{Who|date=January 2011}} that mathematics cannot be reduced to logic alone, and Karl Popper concluded that "most mathematical theories are, like those of [[physics]] and [[biology]], [[hypothesis|hypothetico]]-[[deductive]]: pure mathematics therefore turns out to be much closer to the natural sciences whose hypotheses are conjectures, than it seemed even recently."&lt;ref&gt;Popper 1995, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Other thinkers, notably [[Imre Lakatos]], have applied a version of [[falsificationism]] to mathematics itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Imre Lakatos]] (1976), ''[[Proofs and Refutations]]''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hps.elte.hu/~kutrovatz/LakatosEng.pdf |title=Gábor Kutrovátz, "Imre Lakatos's Philosophy of Mathematics" |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative view is that certain scientific fields (such as [[theoretical physics]]) are mathematics with axioms that are intended to correspond to reality. Mathematics shares much in common with many fields in the physical sciences, notably the [[deductive reasoning|exploration of the logical consequences]] of assumptions. [[Intuition (knowledge)|Intuition]] and experimentation also play a role in the formulation of [[conjecture]]s in both mathematics and the (other) sciences. [[Experimental mathematics]] continues to grow in importance within mathematics, and computation and simulation are playing an increasing role in both the sciences and mathematics.

The opinions of mathematicians on this matter are varied. Many mathematicians&lt;ref&gt;See, for example [[Bertrand Russell]]'s statement "Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty ..." in his ''History of Western Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; feel that to call their area a science is to downplay the importance of its aesthetic side, and its history in the traditional seven [[liberal arts]]; others{{Who|date=August 2009}} feel that to ignore its connection to the sciences is to turn a blind eye to the fact that the interface between mathematics and its applications in science and engineering has driven much development in mathematics. One way this difference of viewpoint plays out is in the philosophical debate as to whether mathematics is ''created'' (as in art) or ''discovered'' (as in science). It is common to see universities divided into sections that include a division of ''Science and Mathematics'', indicating that the fields are seen as being allied but that they do not coincide. In practice, mathematicians are typically grouped with scientists at the gross level but separated at finer levels. This is one of many issues considered in the [[philosophy of mathematics]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Mathematics arises from many different kinds of problems. At first these were found in commerce, [[land measurement]], architecture and later [[astronomy]]; today, all sciences suggest problems studied by mathematicians, and many problems arise within mathematics itself. For example, the [[physicist]] [[Richard Feynman]] invented the [[path integral formulation]] of [[quantum mechanics]] using a combination of mathematical reasoning and physical insight, and today's [[string theory]], a still-developing scientific theory which attempts to unify the four [[Fundamental interaction|fundamental forces of nature]], continues to inspire new mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Feynman Integral and Feynman's Operational Calculus |journal=Physics Today |volume=54 |issue=8 |page=48 |author=Meinhard E. Mayer |year=2001 |bibcode=2001PhT....54h..48J |doi=10.1063/1.1404851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some mathematics is relevant only in the area that inspired it, and is applied to solve further problems in that area. But often mathematics inspired by one area proves useful in many areas, and joins the general stock of mathematical concepts. A distinction is often made between [[pure mathematics]] and [[applied mathematics]]. However pure mathematics topics often turn out to have applications, e.g. [[number theory]] in [[cryptography]]. This remarkable fact, that even the "purest" mathematics often turns out to have practical applications, is what [[Eugene Wigner]] has called "[[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences|the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics]]".&lt;ref name=wigner1960&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wigner |first=Eugene |year=1960 |title=The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html |journal=[[Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics]] |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=1–14 |doi=10.1002/cpa.3160130102 |ref=harv |bibcode=1960CPAM...13....1W |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228152633/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html |archivedate=February 28, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As in most areas of study, the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization: there are now hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the latest [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] runs to 46&amp;nbsp;pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classification2010.pdf |title=Mathematics Subject Classification 2010 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514091144/http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classification2010.pdf |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several areas of applied mathematics have merged with related traditions outside of mathematics and become disciplines in their own right, including statistics, [[operations research]], and [[computer science]].

For those who are mathematically inclined, there is often a definite aesthetic aspect to much of mathematics. Many mathematicians talk about the ''elegance'' of mathematics, its intrinsic [[aesthetics]] and inner beauty. [[Simplicity]] and generality are valued. There is beauty in a simple and elegant [[proof (mathematics)|proof]], such as [[Euclid]]'s proof that there are infinitely many [[prime number]]s, and in an elegant [[numerical method]] that speeds calculation, such as the [[fast Fourier transform]]. [[G. H. Hardy]] in ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]'' expressed the belief that these aesthetic considerations are, in themselves, sufficient to justify the study of pure mathematics. He identified criteria such as significance, unexpectedness, inevitability, and economy as factors that contribute to a mathematical aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Mathematician's Apology |author=Hardy, G. H. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1940 |isbn=978-0-521-42706-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematicians often strive to find proofs that are particularly elegant, proofs from "The Book" of God according to [[Paul Erdős]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Proof and Other Dilemmas: Mathematics and Philosophy |author1=Gold, Bonnie|author1-link=Bonnie Gold |author2=Simons, Rogers A. |publisher=MAA |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Proofs from ''The Book'' |last1=Aigner |first1=Martin |last2=Ziegler |first2=Günter&amp;nbsp;M. |authorlink2=Günter M. Ziegler |publisher=Springer |year=2001 |isbn=978-3-540-40460-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of [[recreational mathematics]] is another sign of the pleasure many find in solving mathematical questions.

==Notation, language, and rigor==
{{main|Mathematical notation}}
[[File:Leonhard Euler 2.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Leonhard Euler]], who created and popularized much of the mathematical notation used today]]

Most of the mathematical notation in use today was not invented until the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/mathsym.html |title=Earliest Uses of Various Mathematical Symbols |publisher= |accessdate=September 14, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220073955/http://jeff560.tripod.com/mathsym.html |archivedate=February 20, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before that, mathematics was written out in words, limiting mathematical discovery.&lt;ref&gt;Kline, p. 140, on [[Diophantus]]; p. 261, on [[Franciscus Vieta|Vieta]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] (1707–1783) was responsible for many of the notations in use today. Modern notation makes mathematics much easier for the professional, but beginners often find it daunting. According to [[Barbara Oakley]], this can be attributed to the fact that mathematical ideas are both more ''abstract'' and more ''encrypted'' than those of natural language.&lt;ref&gt;Oakley 2014, p. 16: "Focused problem solving in math and science is often more effortful than focused-mode thinking involving language and people. This may be because humans haven't evolved over the millennia to manipulate mathematical ideas, which are frequently more abstractly encrypted than those of conventional language."&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike natural language, where people can often equate a word (such as ''cow'') with the physical object it corresponds to, mathematical symbols are abstract, lacking any physical analog.&lt;ref&gt;Oakley 2014, p. 16: "What do I mean by abstractness? You can point to a real live ''cow'' chewing its cud in a pasture and equate it with the letters ''c–o–w'' on the page. But you can't point to a real live ''plus sign'' that the symbol '+' is modeled after – the idea underlying the plus sign is more ''abstract''."&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematical symbols are also more highly encrypted than regular words, meaning a single symbol can encode a number of different operations or ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Oakley 2014, p. 16: "By ''encryptedness'', I mean that one symbol can stand for a number of different operations or ideas, just as the multiplication sign symbolizes repeated addition."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Language of mathematics|Mathematical language]] can be difficult to understand for beginners because even common terms, such as ''or'' and ''only'', have a more precise meaning than they have in everyday speech, and other terms such as ''[[open set|open]]'' and ''[[Field (mathematics)|field]]'' refer to specific mathematical ideas, not covered by their laymen's meanings. Mathematical language also includes many technical terms such as ''[[homeomorphism]]'' and ''[[Integral|integrable]]'' that have no meaning outside of mathematics. Additionally, shorthand phrases such as ''iff'' for "[[if and only if]]" belong to [[mathematical jargon]]. There is a reason for special notation and technical vocabulary: mathematics requires more precision than everyday speech. Mathematicians refer to this precision of language and logic as "rigor".

[[Mathematical proof]] is fundamentally a matter of [[rigor]]. Mathematicians want their theorems to follow from axioms by means of systematic reasoning. This is to avoid mistaken "[[theorem]]s", based on fallible intuitions, of which many instances have occurred in the history of the subject.{{efn|See ''[[false proof]]'' for simple examples of what can go wrong in a formal proof.}} The level of rigor expected in mathematics has varied over time: the Greeks expected detailed arguments, but at the time of [[Isaac Newton]] the methods employed were less rigorous. Problems inherent in the definitions used by Newton would lead to a resurgence of careful analysis and formal proof in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century. Misunderstanding the rigor is a cause for some of the common misconceptions of mathematics&lt;!--This part needs improvement |&gt;&gt;--&gt;. Today, mathematicians continue to argue among themselves about [[computer-assisted proof]]s. Since large computations are hard to verify, such proofs may not be sufficiently rigorous.&lt;ref&gt;Ivars Peterson, ''The Mathematical Tourist'', Freeman, 1988, {{isbn|0-7167-1953-3}}. p. 4 "A few complain that the computer program can't be verified properly", (in reference to the Haken–Apple proof of the Four Color Theorem).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Axiom]]s in traditional thought were "self-evident truths", but that conception is problematic.&lt;ref&gt;"The method of 'postulating' what we want has many advantages; they are the same as the advantages of theft over honest toil." [[Bertrand Russell]] (1919), ''Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy'', New York and London, [http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Quotations/Russell.html p. 71.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620162751/http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Quotations/Russell.html |date=June 20, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At a formal level, an axiom is just a string of symbols, which has an intrinsic meaning only in the context of all derivable formulas of an [[axiomatic system]]. It was the goal of [[Hilbert's program]] to put all of mathematics on a firm axiomatic basis, but according to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] every (sufficiently powerful) axiomatic system has [[independence (mathematical logic)|undecidable]] formulas; and so a final [[axiomatization]] of mathematics is impossible. Nonetheless mathematics is often imagined to be (as far as its formal content) nothing but [[set theory]] in some axiomatization, in the sense that every mathematical statement or proof could be cast into formulas within set theory.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Suppes, ''Axiomatic Set Theory'', Dover, 1972, {{isbn|0-486-61630-4}}. p. 1, "Among the many branches of modern mathematics set theory occupies a unique place: with a few rare exceptions the entities which are studied and analyzed in mathematics may be regarded as certain particular sets or classes of objects."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fields of mathematics==
{{see also|Areas of mathematics|Glossary of areas of mathematics}}
[[File:Abacus 6.png|right|thumb|An [[abacus]], a simple calculating tool used since ancient times]]
Mathematics can, broadly speaking, be subdivided into the study of quantity, structure, space, and change (i.e. [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]], [[geometry]], and [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]). In addition to these main concerns, there are also subdivisions dedicated to exploring links from the heart of mathematics to other fields: to [[mathematical logic|logic]], to [[set theory]] ([[foundations of mathematics|foundations]]), to the empirical mathematics of the various sciences ([[applied mathematics]]), and more recently to the rigorous study of [[uncertainty]]. While some areas might seem unrelated, the [[Langlands program]] has found connections between areas previously thought unconnected, such as [[Galois groups]], [[Riemann surface]]s and [[number theory]].

===Foundations and philosophy===
In order to clarify the [[foundations of mathematics]], the fields of [[mathematical logic]] and [[set theory]] were developed. Mathematical logic includes the mathematical study of [[logic]] and the applications of formal logic to other areas of mathematics; set theory is the branch of mathematics that studies [[set (mathematics)|sets]] or collections of objects. [[Category theory]], which deals in an abstract way with [[mathematical structure]]s and relationships between them, is still in development. The phrase "crisis of foundations" describes the search for a rigorous foundation for mathematics that took place from approximately 1900 to 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Luke Howard Hodgkin &amp; Luke Hodgkin, ''A History of Mathematics'', Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Some disagreement about the foundations of mathematics continues to the present day. The crisis of foundations was stimulated by a number of controversies at the time, including the [[controversy over Cantor's theory|controversy over Cantor's set theory]] and the [[Brouwer–Hilbert controversy]].

Mathematical logic is concerned with setting mathematics within a rigorous [[axiom]]atic framework, and studying the implications of such a framework. As such, it is home to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] which (informally) imply that any effective [[formal system]] that contains basic arithmetic, if ''sound'' (meaning that all theorems that can be proved are true), is necessarily ''incomplete'' (meaning that there are true theorems which cannot be proved ''in that system''). Whatever finite collection of number-theoretical axioms is taken as a foundation, Gödel showed how to construct a formal statement that is a true number-theoretical fact, but which does not follow from those axioms. Therefore, no formal system is a complete axiomatization of full number theory. Modern logic is divided into [[recursion theory]], [[model theory]], and [[proof theory]], and is closely linked to [[theoretical computer science]],{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} as well as to [[category theory]]. In the context of recursion theory, the impossibility of a full axiomatization of number theory can also be formally demonstrated as a [[MRDP theorem#Further applications|consequence of the MRDP theorem]].

[[Theoretical computer science]] includes [[computability theory (computation)|computability theory]], [[computational complexity theory]], and [[information theory]]. Computability theory examines the limitations of various theoretical models of the computer, including the most well-known model&amp;nbsp;– the [[Turing machine]]. Complexity theory is the study of tractability by computer; some problems, although theoretically solvable by computer, are so expensive in terms of time or space that solving them is likely to remain practically unfeasible, even with the rapid advancement of computer hardware. A famous problem is the "[[P = NP problem|{{nowrap|'''P''' {{=}} '''NP'''?}}]]" problem, one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5Qj76uCbF?url=http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/ Clay Mathematics Institute], P=NP, claymath.org&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, information theory is concerned with the amount of data that can be stored on a given medium, and hence deals with concepts such as [[data compression|compression]] and [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]].

====Quantity====
{{Main|Arithmetic}}
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]--&gt;
The study of quantity starts with numbers, first the familiar [[natural number]]s and [[integer]]s ("whole numbers") and arithmetical operations on them, which are characterized in [[arithmetic]]. The deeper properties of integers are studied in [[number theory]], from which come such popular results as [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]. The [[twin prime]] conjecture and [[Goldbach's conjecture]] are two unsolved problems in number theory.

As the number system is further developed, the integers are recognized as a [[subset]] of the [[rational number]]s ("[[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]]"). These, in turn, are contained within the [[real number]]s, which are used to represent [[Continuous function|continuous]] quantities. Real numbers are generalized to [[complex number]]s. These are the first steps of a hierarchy of numbers that goes on to include [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s. Consideration of the natural numbers also leads to the [[transfinite number]]s, which formalize the concept of "[[infinity]]". According to the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] all solutions of equations in one unknown with complex coefficients are complex numbers, regardless of degree. Another area of study is the size of sets, which is described with the [[cardinal number]]s. These include the [[aleph number]]s, which allow meaningful comparison of the size of infinitely large sets.

====Structure====
{{Main|Algebra}}
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]--&gt;
Many mathematical objects, such as [[set (mathematics)|sets]] of numbers and [[function (mathematics)|functions]], exhibit internal structure as a consequence of [[operation (mathematics)|operations]] or [[relation (mathematics)|relations]] that are defined on the set. Mathematics then studies properties of those sets that can be expressed in terms of that structure; for instance [[number theory]] studies properties of the set of [[integer]]s that can be expressed in terms of [[arithmetic]] operations. Moreover, it frequently happens that different such structured sets (or [[mathematical structure|structures]]) exhibit similar properties, which makes it possible, by a further step of [[abstraction]], to state [[axiom]]s for a class of structures, and then study at once the whole class of structures satisfying these axioms. Thus one can study [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]] and other abstract systems; together such studies (for structures defined by algebraic operations) constitute the domain of [[abstract algebra]].

By its great generality, abstract algebra can often be applied to seemingly unrelated problems; for instance a number of ancient problems concerning [[compass and straightedge constructions]] were finally solved using [[Galois theory]], which involves field theory and group theory. Another example of an algebraic theory is [[linear algebra]], which is the general study of [[vector space]]s, whose elements called [[vector (geometric)|vectors]] have both quantity and direction, and can be used to model (relations between) points in space. This is one example of the phenomenon that the originally unrelated areas of [[geometry]] and [[algebra]] have very strong interactions in modern mathematics. [[Combinatorics]] studies ways of enumerating the number of objects that fit a given structure.

====Space====
{{Main|Geometry}}
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]--&gt;
The study of space originates with [[geometry]]&amp;nbsp;– in particular, [[Euclidean geometry]], which combines space and numbers, and encompasses the well-known [[Pythagorean theorem]]. [[Trigonometry]] is the branch of mathematics that deals with relationships between the sides and the angles of triangles and with the trigonometric functions. The modern study of space generalizes these ideas to include higher-dimensional geometry, [[non-Euclidean geometries]] (which play a central role in [[general relativity]]) and [[topology]]. Quantity and space both play a role in [[analytic geometry]], [[differential geometry]], and [[algebraic geometry]]. [[Convex geometry|Convex]] and [[discrete geometry]] were developed to solve problems in [[geometry of numbers|number theory]] and [[functional analysis]] but now are pursued with an eye on applications in [[convex optimization|optimization]] and [[computational geometry|computer science]]. Within differential geometry are the concepts of [[fiber bundles]] and calculus on [[manifold]]s, in particular, [[vector calculus|vector]] and [[tensor calculus]]. Within algebraic geometry is the description of geometric objects as solution sets of [[polynomial]] equations, combining the concepts of quantity and space, and also the study of [[topological groups]], which combine structure and space. [[Lie group]]s are used to study space, structure, and change. [[Topology]] in all its many ramifications may have been the greatest growth area in 20th-century mathematics; it includes [[point-set topology]], [[set-theoretic topology]], [[algebraic topology]] and [[differential topology]]. In particular, instances of modern-day topology are [[metrizability theory]], [[axiomatic set theory]], [[homotopy theory]], and [[Morse theory]]. Topology also includes the now solved [[Poincaré conjecture]], and the still unsolved areas of the [[Hodge conjecture]]. Other results in geometry and topology, including the [[four color theorem]] and [[Kepler conjecture]], have been proved only with the help of computers.

====Change====
{{Main|Calculus}}
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]--&gt;
Understanding and describing change is a common theme in the [[natural science]]s, and [[calculus]] was developed as a powerful tool to investigate it. [[Function (mathematics)|Functions]] arise here, as a central concept describing a changing quantity. The rigorous study of [[real number]]s and functions of a real variable is known as [[real analysis]], with [[complex analysis]] the equivalent field for the [[complex number]]s. [[Functional analysis]] focuses attention on (typically infinite-dimensional) [[Space#Mathematics|spaces]] of functions. One of many applications of functional analysis is [[quantum mechanics]]. Many problems lead naturally to relationships between a quantity and its rate of change, and these are studied as [[differential equation]]s. Many phenomena in nature can be described by [[dynamical system]]s; [[chaos theory]] makes precise the ways in which many of these systems exhibit unpredictable yet still [[deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]] behavior.

===Applied mathematics===
{{Main|Applied mathematics}}
[[Applied mathematics]] concerns itself with mathematical methods that are typically used in science, engineering, business, and industry. Thus, "applied mathematics" is a [[mathematical science]] with specialized knowledge. The term ''applied mathematics'' also describes the professional specialty in which mathematicians work on practical problems; as a profession focused on practical problems, ''applied mathematics'' focuses on the "formulation, study, and use of mathematical models" in science, engineering, and other areas of mathematical practice.

In the past, practical applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories, which then became the subject of study in pure mathematics, where mathematics is developed primarily for its own sake. Thus, the activity of applied mathematics is vitally connected with research in [[pure mathematics]].

====Statistics and other decision sciences====
{{Main|Statistics}}
Applied mathematics has significant overlap with the discipline of statistics, whose theory is formulated mathematically, especially with [[probability theory]]. Statisticians (working as part of a research project) "create data that makes sense" with [[random sampling]] and with randomized [[design of experiments|experiments]];&lt;ref&gt;[[C.R. Rao|Rao, C.R.]] (1997) ''Statistics and Truth: Putting Chance to Work'', World Scientific. {{isbn|981-02-3111-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the design of a statistical sample or experiment specifies the analysis of the data (before the data be available). When reconsidering data from experiments and samples or when analyzing data from [[observational study|observational studies]], statisticians "make sense of the data" using the art of [[statistical model|modelling]] and the theory of [[statistical inference|inference]]&amp;nbsp;– with [[model selection]] and [[estimation theory|estimation]]; the estimated models and consequential [[Scientific method#Predictions from the hypothesis|predictions]] should be [[statistical hypothesis testing|tested]] on [[Scientific method#Evaluation and improvement|new data]].{{efn|Like other mathematical sciences such as [[physics]] and [[computer science]], statistics is an autonomous discipline rather than a branch of applied mathematics. Like research physicists and computer scientists, research statisticians are mathematical scientists. Many statisticians have a degree in mathematics, and some statisticians are also mathematicians.}}

[[Statistical theory]] studies [[statistical decision theory|decision problems]] such as minimizing the [[risk]] ([[expected loss]]) of a statistical action, such as using a [[statistical method|procedure]] in, for example, [[parameter estimation]], [[hypothesis testing]], and [[selection algorithm|selecting the best]]. In these traditional areas of [[mathematical statistics]], a statistical-decision problem is formulated by minimizing an [[objective function]], like expected loss or [[cost]], under specific constraints: For example, designing a survey often involves minimizing the cost of estimating a population mean with a given level of confidence.&lt;ref name="RaoOpt"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Arthanari |editor1-first=T.S. |editor2-last=Dodge |editor2-first=Yadolah |editor2-link=Yadolah Dodge |last=Rao |first=C.R. |authorlink=C.R.

====Computational mathematics====
[[Computational mathematics]] proposes and studies methods for solving [[mathematical problem]]s that are typically too large for human numerical capacity. [[Numerical analysis]] studies methods for problems in [[analysis (mathematics)|analysis]] using [[functional analysis]] and [[approximation theory]]; numerical analysis includes the study of [[approximation]] and [[discretization]] broadly with special concern for [[rounding error]]s. Numerical analysis and, more broadly, scientific computing also study non-analytic topics of mathematical science, especially [[algorithm]]ic [[numerical linear algebra|matrix]] and [[graph theory]]. Other areas of computational mathematics include [[computer algebra]] and [[symbolic computation]].

==Mathematical awards==
Arguably the most prestigious award in mathematics is the [[Fields Medal]],{{sfn|Monastyrsky|2001|p=1|ps=: "The Fields Medal is now indisputably the best known and most influential award in mathematics."}}{{sfn|Riehm|2002|pp=778–82}} established in 1936 and awarded every four years (except around World War II) to as many as four individuals. The Fields Medal is often considered a mathematical equivalent to the Nobel Prize.

The [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics]], instituted in 1978, recognizes lifetime achievement, and another major international award, the [[Abel Prize]], was instituted in 2003. The [[Chern Medal]] was introduced in 2010 to recognize lifetime achievement. These accolades are awarded in recognition of a particular body of work, which may be innovational, or provide a solution to an outstanding problem in an established field.

A famous list of 23 [[open problem]]s, called "[[Hilbert's problems]]", was compiled in 1900 by German mathematician [[David Hilbert]]. This list achieved great celebrity among mathematicians, and at least nine of the problems have now been solved. A new list of seven important problems, titled the "[[Millennium Prize Problems]]", was published in 2000. Only one of them, the [[Riemann hypothesis]], duplicates one of Hilbert's problems. A solution to any of these problems carries a $1&amp;nbsp;million reward.

'''Mechanics''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|μηχανική}}) is that area of [[science]] concerned with the behaviour of [[physical body|physical bodies]] when subjected to [[force]]s or [[Displacement (vector)|displacements]], and the subsequent effects of the bodies on their environment.
The scientific discipline has its origins in [[Ancient Greece]] with the writings of [[Aristotle]] and [[Archimedes]]&lt;ref&gt;Dugas, Rene. A History of Classical Mechanics. New York, NY: Dover Publications Inc, 1988, pg 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rana, N.C., and Joag, P.S. Classical Mechanics. West Petal Nagar, New Delhi. Tata McGraw-Hill, 1991, pg 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renn, J., Damerow, P., and McLaughlin, P. Aristotle, Archimedes, Euclid, and the Origin of Mechanics: The Perspective of Historical Epistemology. Berlin: Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, 2010, pg 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;    (see [[History of classical mechanics]] and [[Timeline of classical mechanics]]). During the [[early modern period]], scientists such as [[Galileo]], [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]], and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] laid the foundation for what is now known as [[classical mechanics]].
It is a branch of [[Classical physics|classical physics]] that deals with particles that are either at rest or are moving with velocities significantly less than the speed of light. 
It can also be defined as a branch of science which deals with the motion of and forces on objects. The field is yet less widely understood in terms of quantum theory. 

== Classical versus quantum ==
{{Classical mechanics |branches}}
{{Quantum mechanics |background}}

Historically, [[classical mechanics]] came first and [[quantum mechanics]] is a comparatively recent development. Classical mechanics originated with [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]] in [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]; Quantum Mechanics was developed in the early 20th century. Both are commonly held to constitute the most certain knowledge that exists about physical nature. 

Classical mechanics has especially often been viewed as a model for other so-called [[exact science]]s. Essential in this respect is the extensive use of [[mathematics]] in theories, as well as the decisive role played by [[experiment]] in generating and testing them.

[[Quantum]] mechanics is of a bigger  scope, as it encompasses classical mechanics as a sub-discipline which applies under certain restricted circumstances. According to the [[correspondence principle]], there is no contradiction or conflict between the two subjects, each simply pertains to specific situations. The correspondence principle states that the behavior of systems described by quantum theories reproduces classical physics in the limit of large [[quantum numbers]]. Quantum mechanics has superseded classical mechanics at the foundation level and is indispensable for the explanation and prediction of processes at the molecular, atomic, and sub-atomic level. However, for macroscopic processes classical mechanics is able to solve problems which are unmanageably difficult in quantum mechanics and hence remains useful and well used.
Modern descriptions of such behavior begin with a careful definition of such quantities as displacement (distance moved), time, velocity, acceleration, mass, and force. Until about 400 years ago, however, motion was explained from a very different point of view. For example, following the ideas of Greek philosopher and scientist Aristotle, scientists reasoned that a cannonball falls down because its natural position is in the Earth; the sun, the moon, and the stars travel in circles around the earth because it is the nature of heavenly objects to travel in perfect circles.

Often cited as father to modern science, [[Galileo]] brought together the ideas of other great thinkers of his time and began to calculate motion in terms of distance traveled from some starting position and the time that it took. He showed that the speed of falling objects increases steadily during the time of their fall. This acceleration is the same for heavy objects as for light ones, provided air friction (air resistance) is discounted. The English mathematician and physicist [[Isaac Newton]] improved this analysis by defining force and mass and relating these to acceleration. For objects traveling at speeds close to the speed of light, Newton’s laws were superseded by [[Albert Einstein]]’s [[Special relativity|theory of relativity]]. [A sentence illustrating the computational complication of Einstein's theory of relativity.] For atomic and subatomic particles, Newton’s laws were superseded by [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]]. For everyday phenomena, however, Newton’s three laws of motion remain the cornerstone of dynamics, which is the study of what causes motion.

== Relativistic versus Newtonian ==

In analogy to the distinction between quantum and classical mechanics, [[Einstein]]'s [[General relativity|general]] and [[Special relativity|special]] theories of [[theory of relativity|relativity]] have expanded the scope of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Galileo]]'s formulation of mechanics. The differences between relativistic and Newtonian mechanics become significant and even dominant as the velocity of a massive body approaches the [[speed of light]]. For instance, in [[classical mechanics|Newtonian mechanics]], [[Newton's laws of motion]] specify that '''F''' = ''m'''''a''', whereas in [[relativistic mechanics]] and [[Lorentz transformations]], which were first discovered by [[Hendrik Lorentz]], '''F''' = &amp;gamma;''m'''''a''' (where γ is the [[Lorentz factor]], which is almost equal to 1 for low speeds).

==General relativistic versus quantum==

Relativistic corrections are also needed for quantum mechanics, although general relativity has not been integrated. The two theories remain incompatible, a hurdle which must be overcome in developing a [[theory of everything]].

==History==

{{Main|History of classical mechanics|History of quantum mechanics}}

===Antiquity===

{{Main|Aristotelian mechanics}}

The main theory of mechanics in antiquity was [[Aristotelian mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vPT-JubW-7QC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false A history of mechanics]''". René Dugas (1988). p.19. {{ISBN|0-486-65632-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later developer in this tradition is [[Hipparchus]].&lt;ref name="mechanics"&gt;"[http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/01/a_tiny_taste_of_the_history_of.html A Tiny Taste of the History of Mechanics]". The University of Texas at Austin.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval age===

{{Main|Theory of impetus}}
[[File:Arabic machine manuscript - Anonym - Ms. or. fol. 3306 c.jpg|thumb|small|200px|Arabic Machine Manuscript. Unknown date (at a guess: 16th to 19th centuries).]]
In the Middle Ages, Aristotle's theories were criticized and modified by a number of figures, beginning with [[John Philoponus]] in the 6th century. A central problem was that of [[projectile motion]], which was discussed by Hipparchus and Philoponus. This led to the development of the [[theory of impetus]] by 14th-century French priest [[Jean Buridan]], which developed into the modern theories of [[inertia]], [[velocity]], [[acceleration]] and [[momentum]]. This work and others was developed in 14th-century England by the [[Oxford Calculators]]  such as [[Thomas Bradwardine]], who studied and formulated various laws regarding falling bodies.

On the question of a body subject to a constant (uniform) force, the 12th-century Jewish-Arab [[Hibat Allah Abu'l-Barakat al-Baghdaadi|Nathanel]] (Iraqi, of Baghdad) stated that constant force imparts constant acceleration, while the main properties are uniformly accelerated motion (as of falling bodies) was worked out by the 14th-century Oxford Calculators.

===Early modern age===

Two central figures in the early modern age are [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Isaac Newton]]. Galileo's final statement of his mechanics, particularly of falling bodies, is his ''[[Two New Sciences]]'' (1638). Newton's 1687 ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' provided a detailed mathematical account of mechanics, using the newly developed mathematics of [[calculus]] and providing the basis of [[Newtonian mechanics]].&lt;ref name="mechanics"/&gt;

There is some dispute over priority of various ideas: Newton's ''Principia'' is certainly the seminal work and has been tremendously influential, and the systematic mathematics therein did not and could not have been stated earlier because calculus had not been developed. However, many of the ideas, particularly as pertain to inertia (impetus) and falling bodies had been developed and stated by earlier researchers, both the then-recent Galileo and the less-known medieval predecessors. Precise credit is at times difficult or contentious because scientific language and standards of proof changed, so whether medieval statements are ''equivalent'' to modern statements or ''sufficient'' proof, or instead ''similar'' to modern statements and ''hypotheses'' is often debatable.

===Modern age===

Two main modern developments in mechanics are [[general relativity]] of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], and [[quantum mechanics]], both developed in the 20th century based in part on earlier 19th-century ideas. The development in the modern continuum mechanics, particularly in the areas of elasticity, plasticity, fluid dynamics, electrodynamics and thermodynamics of deformable media, started in the second half of the 20th century.

==Types of mechanical bodies==

The often-used term '''[[Physical body|body]]''' needs to stand for a wide assortment of objects, including particles, [[projectiles]], [[spacecraft]], [[star]]s, parts of [[mechanical engineering|machinery]], parts of [[solids]], parts of [[fluids]] ([[gases]] and [[liquids]]), etc.

Other distinctions between the various sub-disciplines of mechanics, concern the nature of the bodies being described. Particles are bodies with little (known) internal structure, treated as mathematical points in classical mechanics. Rigid bodies have size and shape, but retain a simplicity close to that of the particle, adding just a few so-called [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]], such as orientation in space.

Otherwise, bodies may be semi-rigid, i.e. [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]], or non-rigid, i.e. [[fluid]]. These subjects have both classical and quantum divisions of study.

For instance, the motion of a spacecraft, regarding its [[orbit]] and attitude ([[rotation]]), is described by the relativistic theory of classical mechanics, while the analogous movements of an [[atomic nucleus]] are described by quantum mechanics.

== Sub - disciplines ==

The following are two lists of various subjects that are studied in mechanics.

Note that there is also the "[[Field theory (physics)|theory of fields]]" which constitutes a separate discipline in physics, formally treated as distinct from mechanics, whether [[Classical field theory|classical fields]] or [[quantum field theory|quantum fields]]. But in actual practice, subjects belonging to mechanics and fields are closely interwoven. Thus, for instance, forces that act on particles are frequently derived from fields ([[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] or [[gravitational]]), and particles generate fields by acting as sources. In fact, in quantum mechanics, particles themselves are fields, as described theoretically by the [[wave function]].

'''Neurocriminology''' is an emerging sub-discipline of biocriminology and criminology that applies brain imaging techniques and principles from neuroscience to understand, predict, and prevent crime.

== Concept ==

The main idea behind neurocriminology is that crime is only partially a social and environmental problem, and biological factors along with medical conditions play a significant role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rafter, Nicole Hahn |title=The Criminal Brain: Understanding Biological Theories of Crime |year=2008|page=217 |publisher=New York University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deviant brain theories have always been part of biocriminology, which explains crime with biological reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rafter, Nicole Hahn |title=The Criminal Brain: Understanding Biological Theories of Crime |year=2008|pages=19–121 |publisher=New York University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurocriminology has become mainstream during the past two decades,&lt;ref name="Raine, Adrian 2014 367"&gt;{{cite book |author=Raine, Adrian |title=The Anatomy of Violence: the Biological Roots of Crime |year=2014|page=367|publisher=Vintage Books }}&lt;/ref&gt; since contemporary biocriminologists focus almost exclusively on brain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rafter, Nicole Hahn |title=The Criminal Brain: Understanding Biological Theories of Crime |year=2008|page=241 |publisher=New York University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to significant advances in neuroscience. Even though neurocriminology is still at odds with traditional sociological theories of crime,&lt;ref name="Raine, Adrian 2014 367"/&gt; it is becoming more popular in the scientific community.&lt;ref name="SB10001424127887323335404578444682892520530"&gt;{{cite web |last=Raine |first=Adrian |title=The Criminal Mind |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323335404578444682892520530 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

The origins of neurocriminology go back to one of the founders of modern criminology, 19th-century Italian psychiatrist and prison doctor Cesare Lombroso, whose beliefs that the crime originated from brain abnormalities were partly based on phrenological theories about the shape and size of the human head. Lombroso conducted a postmortem on a serial killer and rapist, who had an unusual indentation at the base of the skull. Lombroso discovered a hollow part in the killer’s brain where the cerebellum would be. Lombroso’s theory was that crime originated in part from abnormal brain physiology and that violent criminals where throwbacks to less evolved human types identifiable by ape-like physical characteristics. Criminals, he believed, could be identified by physical traits, such as a large jaw and sloping forehead.&lt;ref name="SB10001424127887323335404578444682892520530" /&gt; The contemporary neuroscientists further developed his idea that physiology and traits of the brain underlie all crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Adams |first=Tim |title=How to Spot a Murderer's Brain |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/may/12/how-to-spot-a-murderers-brain}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term “neurocriminology” was first introduced by James Hilborn (Cognitive Centre of Canada) and adopted by the leading researcher in the field, Dr. Adrian Raine, the chair of the Criminology Department at University of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Seligman |first=Marty |title=Three Scholars Worth Your Time: Part 4 |url=http://lawmindscience.wordpress.com/2011/03/06/three-interesting-mind-scientists/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first to conduct brain imaging study on violent criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Criminologist Believes Violent Behavior Is Biological, Adrian Raine's Interview with NPR Fresh Air's Terry Gross |url=https://www.npr.org/2014/03/21/292375166/criminologist-believes-violent-behavior-is-biological}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major studies ==

Many recent studies have revealed that sometimes structural and functional abnormalities are so striking that anyone can see them. Some violent offenders, however, have subtle structural or functional abnormalities and even highly experienced neuroradiologists cannot detect these irregularities right away. Yet, the abnormalities can be detected using brain imaging and state-of-the-art analytic tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Raine, Adrian |title=The Anatomy of Violence: the Biological Roots of Crime |year=2014|page=136 |publisher=Vintage Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neurophysiological studies ==

Studies on structural deficiencies suggest that people consistently behaving antisocially have structurally impaired brains. The abnormalities can be either of general character or affect specific regions of the brain that control emotions, aggression or are responsible for ethical decisions:

''Low number of neurons in the prefrontal cortex''.
A study in 2000 determined that people with a history of persistent antisocial behavior had an 11 percent reduction in the volume of gray matter in the prefrontal cortex, while white matter volume was normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Reduced prefrontal gray matter volume and reduced autonomic activity in antisocial personality disorder |author=Raine, A., Lencz, T., Bihrle, S., Lacasse, L. &amp; Colletti, P.|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|year=2000 |volume=57 |pages=119–27 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.57.2.119}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, A 2009 meta-analysis study, which pooled together the findings of 12 anatomical brain-imaging studies conducted on offender populations, found that the prefrontal cortex of the brain is indeed structurally impaired in offenders.&lt;ref name="j.pscychresns.2009.03.012"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Prefrontal structural and functional brain imaging findings in antisocial, violent, and psychopathic individuals: A meta-analysis |author1=Yang, Y.  |author2=Raine, A. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging |year=2009 |volume=174 |pages=81–88 |doi=10.1016/j.pscychresns.2009.03.012 |pmid=19833485 |pmc=2784035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Underdeveloped amygdalae''. Two studies found that both the left and especially the right amygdalae are impaired in psychopaths. The psychopaths had on average 18 percent reduction in the volume of the right amygdala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Localization of deformations within the amygdala in individuals with psychopathy |author=Yang, Y., Raine, A., Karr, K. L., Colletti, P. &amp; Toga, A.|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |year=2009 |volume=66 |pages=986–94 |doi=10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2009.110 |pmid=19736355 |pmc=3192811}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Lower Amygdala Volume in Men is Associated with Childhood Aggression, Early Psychopathic Traits, and Future Violence |author=Pardini, Dustin A.|journal=Biological Psychiatry |volume=75 |pages=73–80 |issue=1 |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2013.04.003|display-authors=etal |pmid=23647988 |pmc=3751993 |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cavum septi pellucidi maldevelopment''. A study in 2010 suggested that people with [[Cave of septum pellucidum|cavum septi pellucidi]] were prone to psychopathy, antisocial personality disorder, and had more charges and convictions for criminal offenses. This brain maldevelopment was especially linked to lifelong antisocial behavior, i.e. a reckless disregarded for self and others, lack of remorse, and aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Presence of a neurodevelopmental marker for limbic maldevelopment in antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy |author=Raine, A., Lee, L., Yang, Y. &amp; Colletti, P. |journal=British Journal of Psychiatry |year=2010 |volume=197 |pages=186–92 |doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.110.078485 |pmid=20807962 |pmc=2930915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bigger right hippocampus''. A 2004 study suggested that the psychopaths’ right hippocampus that partially controls emotions and regulates aggression was significantly bigger than the left. This asymmetry was also true in normal people, but it was much more noticeable in psychopaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Hippocampal structural asymmetry in unsuccessful psychopaths |author=Raine, A., Ishikawa, S. S., Arce, E., Lencz, T., Knuth, K. H.|journal=Biological Psychiatry |year=2004 |volume=55 |pages=185–91 |doi=10.1016/s0006-3223(03)00727-3|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Increase in the volume of the striatum''. A study in 2010 found that psychopathic individuals showed a 10 percent increase in the volume of the striatum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Increased volume of the striatum in psychopathic individuals |author=Glenn, A. L., Raine, A., Yaralian, P. S. &amp; Yang, Y. |journal=Biological Psychiatry |year=2010 |volume=67 |pages=52–58 |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.06.018|pmc=2794920 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Damage by foreign objects''. A large number of studies on structural damage by foreign objects convincingly shows that adults suffering head injuries damaging the prefrontal cortex show impulsive and antisocial behavior that does not conform to the norms of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Glenn, A. L.  |author2=Raine, A.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Neural circuits underlying morality and antisocial behavior, in The Moral Brain |year=2009 |pages=45–68 |publisher=New York: Springer, J. Verplaetse and J. Braeckman (eds.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There is a number of famous life stories showing the same causal connection. For example, P. Gage was a well-respected, well-liked, and responsible gentleman. In 1848 because of a construction accident he suffered a serious damage to his brain when a metal rod propelled by an explosive entered his lower left cheek and exited from the top-middle part of his head. Gage healed quickly. After that accident, however, he became erratic, disrespectful, and vulgar. Gage had been transformed from a well-controlled, well-respected person to an individual with psychopathic traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Raine, Adrian |title=The Anatomy of Violence: the Biological Roots of Crime |year=2014|pages=143–45 |publisher=Vintage Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Damage by tumors''. There is also a number of famous U.S. criminal cases showing that damage of the brain by tumors can result in the same transformation as the damage by foreign objects. 
Charles Whitman, for instance, was a young man who studied architectural engineering at the University of Texas. Whitman had no history of violence or crime. As a child, he scored 138 on the Stanford-Binet IQ test, placing in the 99th percentile. He was an Eagle Scout, volunteered as a scoutmaster, and served in Marine Corps. In 1966 Whitman unexpectedly killed his mother as well as wife, ascended the belltower of the University of Texas, Austin, and fired a rifle at students below. He killed 15 people and wounding 31 more before police officers shot him. Whitman in his final note complained of inability to control his thoughts and requested an autopsy, which revealed a brain tumor in the hypothalamus region of his brain, a growth that, some hypothesized, put pressure on his amygdala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rafter, Nicole Hahn |title=The Criminal Brain: Understanding Biological Theories of Crime |year=2008|page=204 |publisher=New York University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Eagleman |first=David |title=The Brain on Trial |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/07/the-brain-on-trial/308520/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Michael Oft’s was a teacher in Virginia who had no prior psychiatric nor deviant behavior history. At the age of forty, his behavior suddenly changed. He began to frequent massage parlors, collect child pornography, abuse his step-daughter, and was soon found guilty of child molestation. Mr. Oft opted for a treatment program for pedophiles, but still couldn’t resist soliciting sexual favors from staff and other clients at the rehabilitation center. A neurologist advised a brain scan, which showed a tumor growing at the base of his orbitofrontal cortex, compressing the right prefrontal region of his brain. After the tumor was removed, Mr. Oft’s emotion, behavior and sexual activity returned to normal. But after several months of normal behavior Mr. Oft again began to collect child pornography. Neurologists rescanned his brain and found that the tumor had grown back. After the second surgery removing the tumor, his behavior have been totally appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Raine, Adrian |title=The Anatomy of Violence: the Biological Roots of Crime |year=2014|page=303 |publisher=Vintage Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neurofunctional studies ==

Similarly to neurophysiological studies neurofunctional showed that brains of criminals and psychopaths not only are structures differently but also operate in a different way. As you can see below, both structural and functional abnormalities tend to affect the same areas of the brain. These are the major abnormalities found:

''Lack of Activation in the Prefrontal Cortex''. A number of studies replicated the observance that violent criminals’ brains showed a significant reduction in prefrontal glucose metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Brain abnormalities in murderers indicated by positron emission tomography |author=Raine, A., Buchsbaum, M. S. &amp; LaCasse, L. |journal=Biological Psychiatry |year=1997 |volume=42|pages=495–508 |doi=10.1016/s0006-3223(96)00362-9 |pmid=9285085}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="j.pscychresns.2009.03.012" /&gt;

''Reduced Activity In The Amygdala''. A study found that individuals with high psychopathy scores showed reduced activity in the amygdala during emotional, personal moral decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The neural correlates of moral decision-making in psychopathy |author=Glenn, A. L., Raine, A. &amp; Schug, R. A. |journal=Molecular Psychiatry |year=2009|volume=14 |pages=5–6 |doi=10.1038/mp.2008.104}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
''Dysfunctional Posterior Cingulate''. Two studies found that posterior cingulate functions poorly in adult criminal psychopaths and aggressive patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Limbic abnormalities in affective processing by criminal psychopaths as revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging |author=Kiehl, K.

''Reduced Cerebral Blood Flow in Angular Gyrus''. A couple of studies found reduced cerebral blood flow in angular gyrus of murderers and impulsive, violent criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Reduced frontotemporal perfusion in psychopathic personality |author=Soderstrom, H., Hultin, L., Tullberg, M., Wikkelso, C., Ekholm, S.|journal=Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging |year=2002|volume=114 |pages=81–94 |doi=10.1016/s0925-4927(02)00006-9|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Neuroimaging studies of violence and antisocial behavior |author=Hoptman, M.

''Higher Activation of Subcortical Limbic Regions''. A 1998 study showed higher activation of subcortical limbic regions of two groups of reactive and proactive murderers, especially in the more “emotional” right hemisphere of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Reduced prefrontal and increased subcortical brain functioning assessed using positron emission tomography in predatory and affective murderers |author=Raine, A., Meloy, J.

''Functional Disturbances of the Hippocampus and Its Parahippocampal Gyrus''. A number of studies suggest that this region of the brain is not working properly in murders and violent offenders in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Disorder-specific dissociation of orbitofrontal dysfunction in boys with pure conduct disorder during reward and ventrolateral prefrontal dysfunction in boys with pure ADHD during sustained attention |author=Rubia, K., Smith, A. B., Halari, R., Matsukura, F., Mohammad, M.|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |year=2009 |volume=166 |pages=83–94 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2008.08020212|display-authors=etal |pmid=18829871}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Reduced regional cerebral blood flow in non-psychotic violent offenders |author=Soderstrom, H., Tullberg, M., Wikkelso, C., Ekholm, S. &amp; Forsman, A. |journal=Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging |year=2000 |volume=98 |pages=29–41 |doi=10.1016/s0925-4927(99)00049-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Free will ==

Unlike the founding father of criminology, Cesare Lombroso, who thought that crime was fundamentally biological in its origin and criminals lacked free will altogether, contemporary neurocriminologists seem to take the middle ground approach. They do not argue that biological factors alone cause behavioral problems, but recognize that behavior results from interaction between biology and environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rafter, Nicole Hahn |title=The Criminal Brain: Understanding Biological Theories of Crime |year=2008|page=244 |publisher=New York University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Raine, Adrian |title=The Anatomy of Violence: the Biological Roots of Crime |year=2014|pages=306–15 |publisher=Vintage Books }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors, however, are more determinist in their views. As one author writes: ''"Free will may exist (it may simply be beyond our current science), but one thing seems clear: if free will does exist, it has little room in which to operate. It can at best be a small factor riding on top of vast neural networks shaped by genes and environment. In fact, free will may end up being so small that we eventually think about bad decision-making in the same way we think about any physical process, such as diabetes or lung disease."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Eagleman |first=David |title=The Brain on Trial | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/07/the-brain-on-trial/308520/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal use ==

US legal defense teams increasingly use brain scans as mitigating evidence in trials of violent criminals and sex offenders. See [[Neurolaw]] for more. Here are some of the most famous cases:

===Herbert Weinstein===
In 1991, a sixty-five-year-old advertising executive with no prior history of crime or violence after an argument strangled his wife, opened the window and threw her out of their 12th-floor apartment. His defense team had a structural brain scan done using MRI and PET scan. The images showed a big piece missing from the prefrontal cortex of the brain, i.e., a subarachnoid cyst was growing in his left frontal lobe. The defense team used these images to argue that Weinstein had an impaired ability to regulate his emotions and make rational decisions. The team went with an insanity defense, and the prosecution and defense agreed to a plea of manslaughter. As a result, Weinstein was given a seven-year sentence in contrast to the twenty-five-year sentence he would have served if he had been convicted of second-degree murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rosen |first=Jeffrey |title=The Brain on the Stand |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/11/magazine/11Neurolaw.t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antonio Bustamante===
Bustamante was a well-behaved teenager who suddenly at the age of 22 became a career criminal. His crimes included theft, breaking and entering, drug offenses, and robbery. In 1990 Bustamante was charged with a homicide. The defense team discovered that the client had suffered a head injury from a crowbar at the age of twenty. Bustamante’s behavior changed fundamentally after that, transforming him from a normal individual into an impulsive and emotionally labile criminal. The defense team had his client’s brain scanned, which revealed malfunctioning of the prefrontal cortex. At the end the jury believed that Bustamante’s brain was not normal and spared him from the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Raine, Adrian |title=The Anatomy of Violence: the Biological Roots of Crime |year=2014|page=69 |publisher=Vintage Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Donta Page===
In 1999, Page robbed, raped and killed a female student in Denver. He later was found guilty of first-degree murder and was a candidate for the death penalty. Professor A. Raine from the University of Pennsylvania was an expert witness for defense and brought Page into a laboratory to assess his brain function. Brain imaging scans revealed a distinct lack of activation in the ventral prefrontal cortex. Professor Raine argued for a deep-rooted biological explanation for Mr. Page’s violence, who escaped death penalty partly on the basis of his brain pathology.&lt;ref name="SB10001424127887323335404578444682892520530" /&gt;

== Crime prevention ==

Even though currently there are no preventive programs in place utilizing the recent discoveries in neurocriminology, there are a number of offender rehabilitation programs (Cognitive Centre of Canada).

===Decisions based on brain imaging===
Some scientists propose using brain imaging to help decide which soon-to-be-released offenders are at greater risk for reoffending. The brain imaging data would be used along with common factors like age, prior arrests, and marital status.&lt;ref name="SB10001424127887323335404578444682892520530" /&gt; To support this idea, in a 2013 study, Professor Kent Kiehl from the University of New Mexico studying the population of 96 male offenders in the state’s prisons found that offenders with low activity in the anterior cingulate cortex where twice as likely to commit an offense in the four years after their release as those who had high activity in this region.&lt;ref name="SB10001424127887323335404578444682892520530" /&gt; Similarly, Dustin Pardini conducted that which shows that men with a smaller amygdala are three times more likely to commit violence three years after their release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Lower Amygdala Volume in Men is Associated with Childhood Aggression, Early Psychopathic Traits, and Future Violence|author=Pardini, Dustin A.|journal=Biological Psychiatry |year=2013|volume=75 |pages=73–80 |issue=1 |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2013.04.003|display-authors=etal |pmid=23647988 |pmc=3751993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurochemistry===
Trials demonstrated the efficacy of a number of medications, i.e. stimulants antipsychotics, antidepressants and mood stabilizers, in diminishing aggression in adolescents and children.&lt;ref name="SB10001424127887323335404578444682892520530" /&gt;
Even a simple omega-3 supplements in the diets of young offenders reduces offending and aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Effects of nutritional supplements on aggression, rule-breaking, and psychopathology among young adult prisoners |author=Zaalberg, A., Nijman, H., Bulten, E., Stroosma, L. &amp; Van der Staak, C. |journal=Aggressive Behavior |year=2010 |volume=36 |pages=117–26 |doi=10.1002/ab.20335}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cognitive and physiological effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation in healthy subjects |author=Fontani, G., Corradeschi, F., Felici, A., Alfatti, F., Migliorini, S.|journal=European Journal of Clinical Investigation |year=2005 |volume=35 |pages=691–99 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2362.2005.01570.x |pmid=16269019|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meditation===
Meditation can also affect brains, and even change them permanently. In 2003 Professor Richie Davidson from the University of Wisconsin performed a revolutionary study. People were randomly selected into either a mindfulness training group or a control group that was put on a waiting list for training. Davidson showed that even eight weekly sessions of meditation enhanced left frontal EEG functioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Alterations in brain and immune function produced by mindfulness meditation |author=Davidson, R.

[[File:Human embryo 8 weeks 2.JPG|thumb|300px|Parts of a human embryo]]

'''Ontogeny''' (also '''ontogenesis''' or '''[[morphogenesis]]''') is the origination and development of an [[organism]], usually from the time of [[fertilization]] of the [[ovum|egg]] to the organism's mature form—although the term can be used to refer to the study of the entirety of an organism's lifespan.

Ontogeny is the developmental history of an organism within its own lifetime, as distinct from [[phylogeny]], which refers to the [[evolution]]ary history of a species. In practice, writers on evolution often speak of species as "developing" traits or characteristics. This can be misleading. While developmental (i.e., ontogenetic) processes can influence subsequent evolutionary (e.g., phylogenetic) processes&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Jay Gould|Gould, S.J.]] (1977). ''Ontogeny and Phylogeny''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[evolutionary developmental biology]]), individual organisms develop (ontogeny), while species evolve (phylogeny).

Ontogeny, embryology and developmental biology are closely related studies and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably.  The term ontogeny has also been used in [[cell biology]] to describe the development of various [[cell types]] within an organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thiery|first=Jean Paul|title=Epithelial–mesenchymal transitions in development and pathologies|journal=Current Opinion in Cell Biology|date=1 December 2003|volume=15|issue=6|pages=740–746|doi=10.1016/j.ceb.2003.10.006|pmid=14644200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ontogeny is a useful field of study in many disciplines, including [[developmental biology]], [[developmental psychology]], [[developmental cognitive neuroscience]], and [[developmental psychobiology]].

Ontogeny is also a concept used in [[anthropology]] as "the process through which each of us embodies the history of our own making".&lt;ref name="Toren, Christina 2002"&gt;Toren, Christina. "Comparison and ontogeny." Anthropology, by comparison (2002): 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''ontogeny'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wiktionary:ὤν|ὄν]]&lt;!--[sic] (neuter), not ὤν (masculine)--&gt;, ''on'' ([[Genitive|gen.]] ὄντος, ''ontos''), i.e. "being; that which is", which is the [[Present tense|present]] [[participle]] of the [[verb]] [[wiktionary:εἰμί|εἰμί]], ''eimi'', i.e. "to be, I am", and from the suffix ''-geny'' from the Greek -γένεια -''geneia'', which expresses the concept of "mode of production".&lt;ref&gt;See ''-geny'' in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], second edition, 1989; online version March 2011, accessed 9 May 2011. Earlier version first published in ''New English Dictionary'', 1898.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature and nurture==
A seminal paper named ontogeny as one of the [[Tinbergen's four questions|four primary questions]] of biology, along with [[Julian Huxley|Huxley's]] three others: causation, survival value and evolution.&lt;ref name=Tinbergen/&gt;  [[Niko Tinbergen|Tinbergen]] emphasized that the change of behavioral ''machinery'' during development was distinct from the change in behavior during development. "We can conclude that the thrush itself, i.e. its behavioral machinery, has changed only if the behavior change occurred while the environment was held constant...When we turn from description to causal analysis, and ask in what way the observed change in behavior machinery has been brought about, the natural first step is to try and distinguish between environmental influences and those within the animal...In ontogeny the conclusion that a certain change is internally controlled (is "innate") is reached by ''elimination''. " (p. 424) Tinbergen was concerned that the elimination of environmental factors is difficult to establish, and the use of the word "innate" is often misleading.

==Ontogenetic allometry==

Most organisms undergo [[allometry|allometric]] changes in [[shape]] as they grow and [[Developmental biology|mature]], while others engage in [[metamorphosis]].  Even "reptiles" (non-avian sauropsids, e.g., [[crocodilians]], [[turtles]], [[snakes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pough | first1 = F. H. | year = 1978 | title = Ontogenetic changes in endurance in water snakes (''Natrix sipedon''): Physiological correlates and ecological consequences | url = | journal = Copeia | volume = 1978 | issue = | pages = 69–75 | doi=10.2307/1443823}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[lizards]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garland Jr | first1 = T. | authorlink = Theodore Garland, Jr. | year = 1985 | title = Ontogenetic and individual variation in size, shape and speed in the Australian [[agamid]] lizard ''Amphibolurus nuchalis'' | url = | journal = Journal of Zoology | volume = 207 | issue = | pages = 425–439 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1985.tb04941.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;), in which the offspring are often viewed as miniature adults, show a variety of ontogenetic changes in [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] and [[physiology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garland Jr. | first1 = T. | authorlink = Theodore Garland, Jr. | last2 = Else | first2 = P.

==Anthropological application==

Comparing ourselves to others is something humans do all the time. "In doing so we are acknowledging not so much our sameness to others
or our difference, but rather the commonality that resides in our difference. In other words, because each one of us is at once remarkably similar to, and remarkably different from, all other humans, it makes little sense to think of comparison in terms of a list of absolute similarities and a list of absolute differences. Rather, in respect of all other humans, we find similarities in the ways we are different from one another and differences in the ways we are the same. That we are able to do this is a function of the genuinely historical process that is human ontogeny".&lt;ref name="Toren, Christina 2002"/&gt;

The [[PageRank]] algorithm has several applications in  biochemistry. ("PageRank" is an [[algorithm]] used in [[Google Search]] for ranking websites in their results, but it has been adopted for other purposes also. According to Google, PageRank works by "counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is," the underlying assumption being that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/competition/howgooglesearchworks.html|title=Facts about Google and Competition |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104131332/https://www.google.com/competition/howgooglesearchworks.html|archivedate=4 November 2011|accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

== Application in analyzing protein networks ==

The relative importance-measuring property of the PageRank link analysis algorithm could be used to identify new possible drug targets in proteins.&lt;ref name="elso"&gt;Iván G, Grolmusz V (2011). "When the Web meets the cell: using personalized PageRank for analyzing protein interaction networks". Bioinformatics 27 (3): 405–7. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btq680]&lt;/ref&gt; A '''PageRank-based algorithm could identify important protein targets''' in the pathogen organism better than a method considering only the number of incoming edges (in-degree) of a node in the metabolic network. The reason for this is that some already known, important protein targets do not have a high degree (are not hubs) and also, perturbing some hubs could result in unwanted physiological effects.&lt;ref&gt;Russell RB, Aloy P (2008). "Targeting and tinkering with interaction networks". Nat Chem Biol 4: 666–673.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18936751]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

The clinical use of most antibiotics result in a mutation of the pathogen organism leading to their resistance against the drug. Therefore, development of new drugs is always needed. A potential first step in developing new drugs against currently threatening diseases (e.g. tubercolosis) is to find new drug targets in the causative agent of the disease, i.e. the pathogen microorganism, let it be either a bacterium, or a protozoan parasite. After finding the target protein in the bacterium (or protozoan parasite), one could design small molecular drug compounds that bind to the protein and inhibit it.

Public availability of biological network data&lt;ref&gt;Prasad TSK, Kandasamy K, Pandey A (2009). "Human protein reference database and human proteinpedia as discovery tools for systems biology". Methods Mol Biol 577: 67–79.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19718509]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zanzoni A, Montecchi-Palazzi L, Quondam M, Ausiello G, Helmer-Citterich M, et al. (2002). "Mint: a molecular interaction database". FEBS Lett 513: 135–140.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=FEBS+Lett+513%3A+135%E2%80%93140]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xenarios I, Salwinski L, Duan XJ, Higney P, Kim SM, et al. (2002). "Dip, the database of interacting proteins: a research tool for studying cellular networks of protein interactions". Nucleic Acids Res 30: 303–305.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC99070/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farkas IJ, Korcsmaros T, Kovacs IA, Mihalik A, Palotai R, et al. (2011). "Network-based tools for the identification of novel drug targets". Sci Signal 4: pt3.[http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;4/173/pt3/DC1]&lt;/ref&gt; makes the process of searching for new drug targets easier than it was before. By using the available metabolic networks, it is possible to find important nodes with link analysis algorithms, like PageRank. In a recently published paper,&lt;ref name="hetedik"&gt;Bánky D, Iván G, Grolmusz V (2013). "Equal Opportunity for Low-Degree Network Nodes: A PageRank-Based Method for Protein Target Identification in Metabolic Graphs". PLoS ONE 8(1): e54204.[http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0054204]&lt;/ref&gt; biochemical reactions are treated as nodes of the metabolic network. In this directed network, reaction A has a directed edge towards reaction B if the product of the former enters the latter reaction as a substrate or co-factor.

To select important nodes that could serve as drug targets, we might think of selecting high in-degree nodes (hubs; nodes with many incoming edges). It was shown however[2], that targeting hub proteins with many vital functions may unintentionally harm the living cell as well. A PageRank-based scoring method could detect important nodes that are not hubs and therefore might be better drug targets.

The PageRank of a node A is the stationary limit probability distribution that the random walker is at node A.&lt;ref name="elso" /&gt; In its original application, the personalization vector w captured the personal interest of a web-surfer: interesting websites to a surfer appeared with a higher probability in the distribution given in vector w.&lt;ref name="hetedik" /&gt; In this metabolic network, w is personalized to proteins; w is larger for those proteins that appear in higher concentrations in the proteomics analysis of certain diseases. This personalized PageRank may identify other related proteins to the disease.&lt;ref name="elso" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hetedik" /&gt;

However, by using only the personalized PageRank to identify important nodes, hubs still get a high score on average.&lt;ref&gt;Fortunato S, Boguna M, Flammini A, Menczer F (2008). "Approximating pagerank from in-degree". Lecture Notes in Computer Science  4936: 59–71.[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-540-78808-9_6]&lt;/ref&gt; To find non-hub important nodes instead, we should consider scoring the nodes by their "relativized personalized PageRank"; i.e. their personalized PageRank scores over the number of edges pointing towards them (over their in-degree):
The relativized personalized PageRank (rPPR(v)) for a node v is given by:

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
rPPR(v)=\frac{PPageRank(v)}{d_v}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

where PpageRank(v) is the personalized PageRank score of node v, and d_(v) is its in-degree. It was shown, that by using this method, numerous already validated drug targets can be found (e.g. in the Mycobacterium tubercolosis), therefore, new, currently unknown targets might be detected as well.&lt;ref name="hetedik" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6761">'''River Linking''' is project linking two or more [[river]]s by creating a network of manually created [[canal]]s, and providing land areas that otherwise does not have river water access and reducing the flow of water to sea using this means. It is based on the assumptions that surplus water in some rivers can be diverted to deficit rivers by creating a network of canals to interconnect the rivers.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:RiverLinkingMainMap.jpg|River linking map of India]] --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nwda.gov.in/index2.asp?slid=3&amp;sublinkid=3&amp;langid=1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons and motivations==
For an instance, in India the rainfall over the country is primarily orographic, associated with tropical depressions originating in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. The summer monsoon accounts for more than 85 per cent of the precipitation. The uncertainty of occurrence of rainfall marked by prolonged dry spells and fluctuations in seasonal and annual rainfall is a serious problem for the country. Large parts of Haryana, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are not only in deficit in rainfall but also subject to large variations, resulting in frequent droughts and causing immense hardship to the population and enormous loss to the nation. The water availability even for drinking purposes becomes critical, particularly in the summer months as the rivers dry up and the ground water recedes. Regional variations in the rainfall lead to situations when some parts of the country do not have enough water even for raising a single crop. On the other hand, excess rainfall occurring in some parts of the country creates havoc due to floods.
 
Irrigation using river water and ground water has been the prime factor for raising the food grain production in India from a mere 50 million tonnes in the 1950s to more than 200 million tonnes at present, leading India to attain self-sufficiency in food. Irrigated area has increased from 22 million hectares to 95 million hectares during this period. The population of India, which is around 1000 million at present, is expected to increase to 1500 to 1800 million in the year 2050 and that would require about 450 million tonnes of food grains. For meeting this requirement, it would be necessary to increase irrigation potential to 160 million hectares for all crops by 2050. India's maximum irrigation potential that could be created through conventional sources has been assessed to be about 140 million hectares. For attaining a potential of 160 million hectares, other strategies shall have to be evolved.
 
Floods are a recurring feature, particularly by the Brahmaputra and Ganga rivers, in which almost 60 per cent of the river flows of India country occur. Flood damages, which were Rs. 52 crores in 1953, have gone up to Rs. 5,846 crores in 1998 with annual average being Rs. 1,343 crores affecting the States of Assam, Bihar, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh along with untold human sufferings. On the other hand, large areas in the States of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu face recurring droughts. As much as 85 percentage of drought prone area falls in these States. One of the most effective ways to increase the irrigation potential for increasing the food grain production, mitigating floods and droughts and reducing regional imbalance in the availability of water is the Inter Basin Water Transfer (IBWT) from the surplus rivers to deficit areas. Brahmaputra and Ganga particularly their northern tributaries, Mahanadi, Godavari and West Flowing Rivers originating from the Western Ghats are found to be surplus in water resources. If we can build storage reservoirs on these rivers and connect them to other parts of the country, regional imbalances could be reduced significantly and lot of benefits could be gained by way of additional irrigation, domestic and industrial water supply, hydropower generation, navigational facilities etc.

== Benefits ==

===Irrigation===
By linking the rivers, vast amount of land areas which will not otherwise be [[Irrigation|irrigated]] and are unusable for [[agriculture]] become fertile.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;[http://www.the-south-asian.com/Aug2004/River-linking.htm Article at the-south-asian], additional text.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flood prevention===
During heavy [[rainy season]]s some areas can experience heavy [[flood]]s while other areas might be experiencing [[drought]] like situations. With network of rivers this problem can be greatly avoided by channeling excess water to areas that are not experiencing a flood or are dry.

===Generation of electricity===
With new canals built, feasibility of new [[Damages|dams]] to generate [[hydroelectric power]] becomes a possibility.

===Navigation===
Newly created network of canals opens up new routes and ways and routes of water navigation, which is generally more efficient and cheaper compared to [[road transport]].

==National River Linking Project in India==
{{main|Indian Rivers Inter-link}}
The National River Linking Project (NRLP) is designed to ease [[water shortage]]s in western and southern [[India]] while mitigating the impacts of recurrent floods in the eastern parts of the [[Ganga basin]]. The NRLP, if and when implemented, will be one of the biggest interbasin water transfer projects in the world.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

==Issues and Concerns==

=== Ecological issues ===

One of the major concerns is that rivers change their course in 70–100 years and thus once they are linked, future change of course could create huge practical problems for the project.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

===Aqua life===
A number of leading [[environmentalist]]s are of the opinion that the project could be an [[ecological disaster]]. There would be a decrease in downstream flows resulting in reduction of [[fresh water]] inflows into the seas seriously jeopardizing [[aquatic life]].&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

=== Deforestation ===
Creation of canals would need large areas of land resulting large scale [[deforestation]] in certain areas.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

===Areas getting submerged===
Possibility of new dams comes with the threat of large otherwise habitable or reserved land getting submerged under water or surface water.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

===Displacement of people===
As large strips of land might have to be converted to canals, a considerable population living in this areas must need to be rehabilitated to new areas.

The method was invented at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill by [[Ramesh Raskar]], Greg Welch, Kok-lim Low and Deepak Bandyopadhyay in 1999 [http://web.media.mit.edu/~raskar/Shaderlamps/] as a follow on to Spatial Augmented Reality [http://en.scientificcommons.org/42668071] also invented at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1998 by Ramesh Raskar, Greg Welch and Henry Fuchs.

A [[Rendering (computer graphics)|3D graphic rendering]] software is typically used to compute the deformation caused by the non perpendicular, non-planar or even complex projection surface.

Complex objects (or aggregation of multiple simple objects) create [[self shadows]] that must be compensated by using several projectors.

The objects are typically replaced by neutral color ones, the projection giving all its visual properties, thus the name shader lamps.

The technique can be used to create a sense of invisibility, by rendering transparency. The object is illuminated not by a replacement of its own visual properties, but by the corresponding visual surface placed behind the object as seen from an arbitrary viewing point. 

Police departments, exclusive private investigation firms and military units were the first to acquire this technology. As this level of technological support is unlikely to reach the public market any time soon. Its capabilities could be used for nefarious purposes, like one might expect. The liabilities this equipment holds are endless, and could lead to various criminal acts if placed in the wrong hands. One such example took place in the Augusta, GA area from October 2016 until June 2018, where a private citizen was stalked by a small group of ex-military hackers for a year and a half. It is documented that they had the support of local law enforcement. How they acquired this Shader Lamp technology is still to be determined. Their supposed objective was to test out this new technology in a civilian setting. A program was put in place to have complete access to the civilian target's home WiFi and mobile phone, in order to observe what degree of photographic evidence could be collected by a single, unsupport, non-tech savvy individual. Their target tried to collect as much evidence on the Shader Lamp's image projection, as well as the stalking and harassment taking place, but nearly all of the digital images taken for later evidence were digitally altered through an intrusive hack into the individual's mobile phone and home WiFi in order to erase or alter the images which contained visual evidence of his stalkers. In the end the Shader Lamp technology was a success, but the constant barrage of digital façades drove the individual to suicide. The police report states mental illness as the cause, but lack of Legislation in Georgia Law Code for the type of harassment a Shader Lamp can impose prevents criminal charges from being brought against these anonymous perpetrators. After searching through the late target's cloud storage files containing the altered evidence, researchers have concluded a Shader Lamp, as well as other forms of Holographic Laser projectors to be the tools used by these tech bullies. Since this type of technology has not yet hit the mainstream markets, thankfully, the victim was not likely to know such 3D image casting technology was possible. If he had known, his reality of the 18 month obtrusion of privacy may have resulted in a different outcome.{{Cn|date=June 2018}}

The '''sociology of space''' is a sub-discipline of [[sociology]] that mostly borrows from theories developed within the discipline of [[geography]], including the sub fields of [[human geography]], [[economic geography]], and [[feminist geography]]. The "sociology" of space examines the social and material constitution of spaces. It is concerned with understanding the social practices, institutional forces, and material complexity of how humans and spaces interact. The sociology of space is an inter-disciplinary area of study, drawing on various theoretical traditions including [[Marxism]], [[postcolonialism]], and [[Science and Technology Studies]], and overlaps and encompasses theorists with various academic disciplines such as [[geography]] and [[architecture]].  Edward T. Hall developed the study of [[Proxemics]] which concentrates on the empirical analysis of space in psychology.  

== Definition of space ==
Space is one of the most important concepts within the disciplines of social science as it is fundamental to our understanding of geography. The term "space" has been defined variously by scholars:

In general terms, the Oxford English Dictionary defines space in two ways;

1. A continuous extension viewed with or without reference to the existence of objects within it.  
2. The interval between points or objects viewed as having one, two or three dimensions.

However, the human geographers’ interest is in the objects within the space and their relative position, which involves the description, explanation and prediction of the distribution of phenomena. Thus, the relationships between objects in space is the central of the study.

[[Michel Foucault]] defines space as;
“The space in which we live, which draws us out of ourselves, in which the erosion of our lives, our time and our history occurs, the space that claws and gnaws at us, is also, in itself, a heterogeneous space…..we live inside a set of relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kham|first=Miriam|title=Tahiti Intertwined: Ancestral Land, Tourist Postcard, and Nuclear Test Site|journal=American Anthropologist|date=March 2000|volume= 102| issue = 1|series=New Series|pages=7–26|jstor=683535|doi=10.1525/aa.2000.102.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nigel Thrift]] also defines space as;
"The outcome of a series of highly problematic temporary settlements that divide and connect things up into different kinds of collectives which are slowly provided with the meaning which render them durable and sustainable." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thrift|first=Nigel|title=Key Concept in Geography|year=2003|location=London; SAGE|pages=95–107|editor=Sarah L. Hollaway |editor2=Stephen P. Rice |editor3=Gill Valentine|chapter=Space: The Fundamental Stuff of Human Geography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In short, "space" is the social space in which we live and create relationships with other people, societies and surroundings. Space is an outcome of the hard and continuous work of building up and maintaining collectives by bringing different things into alignments. All kinds of different spaces can and therefore do exist which may or may not relate to each other. Thus, through space, we can understand more about social action.

== History of the sociology of space ==

[[Georg Simmel]] has been seen as the classical sociologist who was most important to this field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation   | last1 = Urry | first1 = John | contribution = The Sociology of Space and Place  | series = Blackwell companion to sociology | pages = 5 | year = 2004|isbn=1-4051-2267-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Simmel wrote on "the sociology of space" in his 1908 book "Sociology: Investigations on the Forms of Sociation". His concerns included the process of metropolitanisation and the separation of leisure spaces in modern economic societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Theory and Method |last=Jary| first=David |url =http://www.reading.ac.uk/RevSoc/archive/volume10/number1/10-1b.htm | year=1997 |accessdate =2010-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The category of [[space]] long played a subordinate role in sociological theory formation. Only in the late 1980s did it come to be realised that certain changes in society cannot be adequately explained without taking greater account of the spatial components of life. This shift in perspective is referred to as the [[topological turn]]. The space concept directs attention to organisational forms of juxtaposition. The focus is on differences between places and their mutual influence. This applies equally for the micro-spaces of everyday life and the macro-spaces at the nation-state or global levels.

The theoretical basis for the growing interest of the social sciences in space was set primarily by English and French-speaking sociologists, philosophers, and human geographers. Of particular importance is [[Michel Foucault| Michel Foucault’s]] essay on “Of Other Spaces”,&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel (1991, orig. 1967), »Andere Räume«, in: Wentz, Martin (Hg.), Stadt-Räume, Frankfurt a. M./New York, S. 65–72&lt;/ref&gt; in which the author proclaims the “age of space”, and [[Henri Lefebvre| Henri Lefebvre’s]] seminal work “La production de l’espace”.&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, Henri (1991, orig. 1974), The Production of Space, D. Nicholson-Smith trans., Oxford: Basil Blackwell, {{ISBN|0-631-14048-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter provided the grounding for Marxist spatial theory on which [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]], [[Manuel Castells]], [[Edward Soja]], and others have built. Marxist theories of space, which are predicated on a structural, i.e., capitalist or global determinants of spaces and the growing homogenization of space, are confronted by action theoretical conceptions, which stress the importance of the corporeal placing and the perception of spaces as albeit habitually predetermined but subjective constructions. One example is the theory of space of the German sociologist [[Martina Löw]].&lt;ref&gt;Löw, Martina (2001), Raumsoziologie, Frankfurt a. M.&lt;/ref&gt; Approaches deriving from the [[Postcolonialism|post-colonialism]] discourse have attracted greater attention in recent years. Also in contrast to (neo)Marxist concepts of space, British geographer [[Doreen Massey (geographer)|Doreen Massey]]&lt;ref&gt;Massey, Doreen (1999a), Power-Geometries and the Politics of Space-Time, Heidelberg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massey, Doreen (1999b), »Spaces of Politics«, in: Massey, Doreen/Allen, John/Sarre, Philip (Hg.), Human Geography Today, Cambridge/Oxford/Malden, S. 279–294&lt;/ref&gt; and German sociologist [[Helmuth Berking]],&lt;ref&gt;Berking, Helmuth (1998), »›Global Flows and Local Cultures‹. Über die Rekonfiguration sozialer Räume im Globalisierungsprozeß«, in: Berliner Journal für Soziologie, 8, 3, S. 381–392&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, emphasise the heterogeneity of local contexts and the place-relatedness of our knowledge about the world.

== Duality of space ==

[[Martina Löw]] developed the idea of a "relational" model of space, which focuses on the “orderings”&lt;ref&gt;Löw, Martina (2008), »The Constitution of Space: The Structuration of Spaces Through the Simultaneity of Effects and Perception«, in: European Journal of Social Theory, 1, 11&lt;/ref&gt; of living entities and social goods, and examines how space is constituted in processes of perception, recall, or ideation to manifest itself as societal structure. From a social theory point of view, it follows on from the theory of structuration proposed by [[Anthony Giddens]],&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony (1984), The Constitution of Society. Outline of the Theory of Structuration. Cambridge: Polity&lt;/ref&gt; whose concept of the “duality of structure” Löw extends sociological terms into a “duality of space.” The basic idea is that individuals act as social agents (and constitute spaces in the process), but that their action depends on economic, legal, social, cultural, and, finally, spatial structures. Spaces are hence the outcome of action. At the same time, spaces structure action, that is to say spaces can both constrain and enable action.

With respect to the constitution of space, Löw distinguishes analytically between two, generally mutually determining factors: “spacing” and “synthesis.” Spacing refers to the act of placing or the state of being placed of social goods and people in places. According to Löw, however, an ordering created through placings is only effectively constituted as space where the elements that compose it are actively interlinked by people – in processes of perception, ideation, or recall. Löw calls this synthesis. This concept has been empirically tested in studies such as those by [[Lars Meier]] (who examined the constitution of space in the everyday life of financial managers in London and Singapore), [[Cedric Janowicz]] (who carried out an ethnographical-space sociological study of food supply in the Ghanaian city of [[Accra]]), and [[Silke Streets]] (who looked at processes of space constitution in the creative industries in Leipzig).

== Marxist approaches ==

The most important proponent of Marxist spatial theory was [[Henri Lefebvre]]. He proposed "social space" to be where the [[relations of production]] are reproduced and that dialectical contradictions were spatial rather than temporal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Lefebvre, Henri | title=The Survival of Capitalism: Reproduction of the Relations of Production | publisher=Allison &amp; Busby | year=1973 | isbn=0-85031-173-X}}, p17-19&lt;/ref&gt; Lefèbvre sees the societal production of space as a dialectical interaction between three factors. Space is constituted:

* by “spatial practice,” meaning space as reproduced in everyday life
* by the “representation of space”, meaning space as developed cognitively
* and by “spaces of representation,” by which Lefebvre means complex symbolisations and ideational spaces.

In Lefebvre’s view of the 1970s, this spatial production resulted in a space of non-reflexive everydayness marked by alienation, dominating through mathematical-abstract concepts of space, and reproduced in spatial practice. Lefebvre sees a line of flight from alienated spatiality in the spaces of representation – in notions of non-alienated, mythical, pre-modern, or artistic visions of space.

Marxist spatial theory was given decisive new impetus by [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]], in particular, who was interested in the effects of the transition from [[Fordism]] to “flexible accumulation” on the experience of space and time.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, David (1989), The Condition of Postmodernity, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; He shows how various innovations at the economic and technological levels have breached the crisis-prone inflexibility of the Fordist system, thus increasing the turnover rate of capital. This causes a general acceleration of economic cycles. According to Harvey, the result is “time-space compression.” While the feeling for the long term, for the future, for continuity is lost, the relationship between proximity and distance becomes more and more difficult to determine.

== Postcolonial theories of space ==

Theories of space that are inspired by the [[Postcolonialism|post-colonialism]] discourse focus on the heterogeneity of spaces. According to [[Doreen Massey (geographer)|Doreen Massey]], calling a country in Africa a “developing country” is not appropriate, since this expression implies that spatial difference is temporal difference (Massey 1999b). This logic treats such a country not as different but merely as an early version of countries in the “developed” world, a view she condemns as "Eurocentrism." In this vein, [[Helmuth Berking]] criticises theories that postulate the increasing homogenisation of the world through globalisation as “globocentrism.” He confronts this with the distinctiveness and importance of local knowledge resources for the production of (different and specific) places. He claims that local contexts form a sort of framework or filter through which global processes and globally circulating images and symbols are appropriated, thus attaining meaning. For instance, the film character [[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]] is a different figure in radical rightwing circles in Germany than in the black ghettoes of the Chicago Southside, just as [[McDonald’s]] means something different in Moscow than in Paris.

== Third Space ==
[[Henri Lefebvre]] (see also [[Edward Soja]]) says that (social) space is a (social) product, or a complex social construction (based on values, and the social production of meanings) which affects spatial practices and perceptions. He explains space embraces a multitude of intersection in his great book, “Production of Space”. That means that we need to consider how the various modes of spatial production relate to each other.

He argues that there are three aspects to our spatial existence, which exist in a kind of triad:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lefebvre|first=Henri|title=Marxist &amp; Social Constructivist Approaches to Place|url=http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~janzb/courses/hum3930b/lefebvre1.htm|publisher=Pegasus|accessdate=2013-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1. First Space
(Physical space/perceived space)
"The spatial practice of a society secretes that society's space; it propounds and presupposes it, in a dialectical interaction; it produces it slowly and surely as it masters and appropriates it."

2. Second Space
(Mental space/conceived space)
"Conceptualized space, the space of scientists, planners, urbanists, technocratic subdividers and social engineers, as of a certain type of artist with a scientific bent -- all of whom identify what is lived and what is perceived with what is conceived."

3. Third Space
(Social space/lived space)
"Space as directly lived through its associated images and symbols."

Even though there are many disciplines in the study of Human Geography, the most well-known approach is “The third space” formulated by [[Edward Soja]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=J. Smith|first=Susan|title=Introducing Human Geographies|year=1999|publisher=Arnold|location=London|pages=12–22|chapter=Society-Space|editor=Paul Cloke |editor2=Philip Crang |editor3=Mark Goodwin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In unitary theory, there are three approaches; first space, second space and third space. First space is physical space, and spaces are measurable and mappable. The second space is a mental or conceived space which comes from our thinking and ideas. However, the third space is a social space/lived space which is a social product that is a space created by society under oppression or marginalization that want to reclaim the space of inequality and make it into something else. Soja argues that our old ways to thinking about space (first and second space theories) can no longer accommodate the way the world works because he believed that spaces may not be contained within one social category, they may include different aspects of many categories or developed within the boundaries of a number of category. For instance, two different cultures combine together and emerge as a third culture. This third hybrid space displaces the original values that constitute it and set up new values and perspectives that is different from the first two spaces. Thus, the third space theory can explain some of the complexity of poverty, social exclusion and social inclusion, gender and race issues.

== Rational view of space ==
In the work of geographer and critical theorist [[Nigel Thrift]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thrift|first=Nigel|title=Key Concept in Geography|year=2003|location=London; SAGE|pages=95–107|editor=Sarah L. Hollaway |editor2=Stephen P. Rice |editor3=Gill Valentine|chapter=Space: The Fundamental Stuff of Human Geography}}&lt;/ref&gt; he wrote a rational view of space in which, rather than seeing space being viewed as a container within which the world proceeds, space should be seen as a co-product of these proceedings. He explained about four constructed space in modern human geography. 
There are four different kinds of space according to how modern geography thinks about space. They are 1. Empirical Construction of Space, 2. Unblocking space, 3. Image space and 4. Place Space.

'''First Space''' is the empirical construction of space. Empirical space refers to the process whereby the mundane fabric of daily life is constructed. These simple things like, cars, houses, mobiles, computers and roads are very simple but they are great achievements of our daily life and they play very important role in making up who we are today. For example, today’s technology such as GPS did not suddenly come into existence; in fact, it is laid down in the 18th century and developed throughout time. The first space is real and tangible, and it is also known as physical space.
'''Second space''' is the unblocking space. This type of space refers to the process whereby routine pathways of interaction as set up around which boundaries are often drawn. The routine may include the movement of office workers, the interaction of drunk teenagers, and the flow of goods, money, people, and information. Unlike the old time in geography when people accepted a space as blocked boundary (Example: A capitalist space, neoliberal space or city space), we began to realize that there is no such thing like boundaries in space. The space of the world is flowing and transforming continuously that it is very difficult to describe in a fixed way. The second space is ideology/conceptual and it is also known as mental space. For example, the second space will explain the behaviors of people from different social class and the social segregation among rich and poor people. 
'''Third space''' is the image space that refers to the process whereby the images has produced new kind of space. The images may be in different form and shape; ranging from painting to photograph, from portrait to post card, and from religious theme to entertainment. Nowadays, we are highly influenced by images in many ways and these certain images can tell us new social and cultures values, or something new about how we see the world. Images, symbols and sign do have some kind of spatial expression. 
'''Fourth space''' is the place that refers to the process whereby spaces are ordered in ways that open up affective and other embodied potentials. Place space has more meaning than a place, and it can represent as different type of space. This fourth type of space tries to understand that place is a vital actor in bringing up people's lives in certain ways and place will let us to understand all kind of things which are hidden form us..

==Scale: the local and the global==
Andrew Herod &lt;ref&gt;Harod, A. 2003. "Scale: the local and the global".  Key Concepts in Geography. London: SAGE.&lt;/ref&gt; mentioned that scale, within human geography, is typically seen in one of the two ways: either as a real material thing which actually exists and is the result of political struggle and/or social process, or as a way of framing our understanding of the world. People’s lives across the globe have been re-scaling by contemporary economic, political, cultural and social processes, such as [[globalization]], in complex ways. As a result, we have seen the creation of [[supra-national]] political bodies such as the [[European Union]], the devolution of political power from the nation-state to regional political bodies.&lt;ref&gt;PoliticalGeography. 1997. Special Issue on " The political geography of scale".Political Geography.&lt;/ref&gt; We have also experienced the increasing homogenization and ‘[[Americanization]]’ through the process of globalization while the locals’ tendencies (or counter force)among people who defend traditional ways of life increase around the world .The process of re-scaling people‘s lives and the relationship between the two extremes of our scaled lives- the ‘global’ and the ‘local’ were brought into question.

===Ontological status of the global and the local===
Until the 1980s, theorizing the concept of ‘scale’ itself was taken for granted although physical and human geographers looked at issues from ‘regional scale’ or‘national scale’. The questions such as whether scale is simply a mental device categorizing and ordering the world or whether scales really exists as material social products, particularly, were debated among [[materialists]] and [[idealists]]. Some geographers draw upon Immanuel Kant’s idealist philosophy that scales were handy conceptual mechanism for ordering the world while others, by drawing upon Marxist ideas of materialism, argue that scales really exist in the world and they were the real social products. For those idealists based on Kantian‘s inspiration, the ‘global’ is defined by the geologically given limits of the earth and the ‘local’ is defined as a spatial resolution useful for comprehending the process and practices. For materialists, the ‘national’ scale is a scale that had to be actively created through economic and political processes but not a scale existed in a logical hierarchy between global and the regional.

The notion of ‘becoming’ and the focus on the politics of producing scales have been central to materialist&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, P.J. 1982. "A materialist framework for political geography", Transactions, Institute of British Geographers.&lt;/ref&gt; arguments concerning the global scale. It is important to recognize that social actors may have to work just as hard to become ‘local’as they have to work to become ‘global’. People paid attention to how transnational corporations have ‘gone global’, how institutions of governance have‘become’ supra-national and how labour unions have sought to ‘globalize’ their operations to match those of an increasingly ‘globalized’ city.

For the scale ‘global’ and ‘local’, Kevin Cox mentioned that moving from the local to the global scale ‘is not a movement from one discrete arena to another’ but a process of developing networks of associations that allow actors to shift between various spaces of engagement. According to his view, ‘scale’ is seen as a process rather than as a fixed entity and, in other words, the global and the local are not static ’arenas’within which social life plays out but are constantly made by social actions.For example, a political organization might attempt to go ‘global’ to engage with actors or opportunities outside of its own space; likewise, a transnational corporation may attempt to ‘go local’ through tailoring its products and operations in different places.

===Discourses of the global and the local===
[[J. K. Gibson-Graham|Gibson-Graham]]&lt;ref&gt;Gibson-Graham, J.K. 2002. "Beyond global vs. local: economic politics outside the binary frame" in: A. Herold and M.W. Wright(eds) . Geographies of Power: Placing Scale. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; (2002) has identified at least six ways in which the relationship between the local and the global is often viewed.

1. The global and the local are seen as interpretive frames for analyzing situations

2. Drawing on Dirlik, Gibson-Graham suggests that in such a representation, the global is ‘something more than the national or regional ..anything other than the local’. Meaning that, the global and the local each derive meaning from what they are not.

3. According to French social theorist [[Bruno Latour]], the local and the global ‘offer different points of view on networks that are by nature neither local nor global, but are more or less long and more or less connected. Also, in Latour’s view, it is impossible to distinguish where the local ends and the global begins.

4. The concept ‘The global is local’ was proposed by Gibson-Graham. For instance, multinational firms are actually ‘multi local‘ rather than ‘global’.

5. The local is global. In this view, the local is an entry point to the world of global flows which encircle the planet.

6. The global and the local are actually the processes rather than the locations. All spaces are the hybrids of global and local; so they are ‘glocal.’

There are some western thoughts that greater size and extensiveness imply domination and superior power, such that the local is often represented as ‘small and relatively powerless, defined and confined by the global’. So, the global is a force and the local is its field of play. However, the local can serve as a powerful scale of political organization; the global is not a scale just controlled by capital – those who challenge capital can also organize globally( Herod, A). There has been the concept ‘Think globally and act locally’ viewed by [[neoliberals]].

===Metaphors of scale===
For representing how the world is scaled, there are five different and popular metaphors: they are the ladder, concentric circles, Matryoshka nesting dolls, earthworm burrows and tree roots. First, in using such a metaphor of hierarchical ladder, the global as the highest rung on the ladder is seen to be above the local and all other scales. Second, the use of concentric metaphor leaves us with a particular way of conceptualizing the scalar relationship between places. In this second metaphor, the local is seen as a relatively small circle, with the regional as a larger circle encompassing it, while the national and the global scales are still larger circles encompassing the local and the regional. For the hierarchy of Russian Matryoshka nesting dolls, the global can contain other scales but this does not work the other way round; for instance, the local cannot contain the global. For the fourth metaphor concerning with thinking on scale, what French social theorist [[Bruno Latour]] argued is that a world of places is ‘networked’ together. Such the metaphor leaves us with an image of scale in which the global and the local are connected together and not totally separated from each other.  For the tree roots metaphor similar with the earthworm burrow metaphor, as the earthworm burrows or tree roots penetrating different strata of the soil, it is difficult to determine exactly where one scale ends and another begins. When thinking about the use of metaphor, it should be aware that the choice of metaphor over another is not made on the basis of which is empirically a ‘more accurate’representation of something but, on the basis of how someone is attempting to understand a particular phenomenon.

Such an appreciation of metaphors is important because it suggests that how we talk about scale impacts upon the ways in which we engage socially and politically with our scaled world and that may impact on how we conduct our social, economic and political praxis and so make landscapes ( Herod,A&lt;ref&gt;Herod, A., Wright, M.W (eds). 2002. Geographies of Power: Placing Scale. Oxford: Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; )

Sparse languages are called ''sparse'' because there are a total of 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; strings of length ''n'', and if a language only contains polynomially many of these, then the proportion of strings of length ''n'' that it contains rapidly goes to zero as ''n'' grows. All [[unary language]]s are sparse. An example of a nontrivial sparse language is the set of binary strings containing exactly ''k'' 1 bits for some fixed ''k''; for each ''n'', there are only [[Binomial coefficient|&lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{k}&lt;/math&gt;]] strings in the language, which is bounded by ''n''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Relationships to other complexity classes ==

'''SPARSE''' contains '''TALLY''', the class of [[unary language]]s, since these have at most one string of any one length. Although not all languages in [[P/poly|'''P'''/poly]] are sparse, there is a [[polynomial-time Turing reduction]] from any language in '''P'''/poly to a sparse language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/CC/mahaney.pdf Jin-Yi Cai. Lecture 11: P=poly, Sparse Sets, and Mahaney's Theorem. CS 810: Introduction to Complexity Theory. The University of Wisconsin–Madison. September 18, 2003 (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt;
Fortune showed in 1979 that if any sparse language is [[co-NP-complete|'''co-NP'''-complete]], then [[P = NP problem|'''P''' = '''NP''']];&lt;ref&gt;S. Fortune. A note on sparse complete sets. ''SIAM Journal on Computing'', volume 8, issue 3, pp.431–433. 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;
Mahaney used this to show in 1982 that if any sparse language is [[NP-complete|'''NP'''-complete]], then '''P''' = '''NP''' (this is [[Mahaney's theorem]]).&lt;ref&gt;S. R. Mahaney. Sparse complete sets for NP: Solution of a conjecture by Berman and Hartmanis. ''Journal of Computer and System Sciences'' 25:130–143. 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;
A simpler proof of this based on left-sets was given by Ogihara and Watanabe in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;M. Ogiwara and O. Watanabe. On polynomial time bounded truth-table reducibility of NP sets to sparse sets. ''SIAM Journal on Computing'' volume 20, pp.471–483. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;
Mahaney's argument does not actually require the sparse language to be in NP, so there is a sparse [[NP-hard|'''NP'''-hard]] set if and only if '''P''' = '''NP'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Further, '''[[E (complexity)|E]]''' ≠ '''[[NE (complexity)|NE]]''' if and only if there exist sparse languages in '''NP''' that are not in '''P'''.&lt;ref&gt;Juris Hartmanis, Neil Immerman, Vivian Sewelson. Sparse Sets in NP-P: EXPTIME versus NEXPTIME. ''Information and Control'', volume 65, issue 2/3, pp.158–181. 1985. [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=808769 At ACM Digital Library]&lt;/ref&gt;
There is a [[Turing reduction]] (as opposed to the [[Karp reduction]] from Mahaney's theorem) from an '''NP'''-complete language to a sparse language if and only if &lt;math&gt;\textbf{NP}\subseteq \textbf{P}/\text{poly}&lt;/math&gt;.
In 1999, Jin-Yi Cai and D. Sivakumar, building on work by Ogihara, showed that if there exists a sparse [[P-complete|'''P'''-complete]] problem, then '''[[L (complexity)|L]]''' = '''[[P (complexity)|P]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;Jin-Yi Cai and D.

'''''{{lang|la|Species Plantarum}}''''' ([[Latin]] for "The Species of Plants") is a book by [[Carl Linnaeus]], originally published in 1753, which lists every [[species]] of [[plant]] known at the time, classified into [[genus|genera]]. It is the first work to consistently apply [[binomial nomenclature|binomial names]] and was the starting point for the [[botanical nomenclature|naming of plants]].

[[File:20120621Plantago lanceolata17.jpg|thumb|Before ''{{lang|la|Species Plantarum}}'', this plant was referred to as "''{{lang|la|Plantago foliis ovato-lanceolatis pubescentibus, spica cylindrica, scapo tereti}}''"; Linnaeus renamed it ''[[Plantago media]]''.]]
''{{lang|la|Species Plantarum}}'' was the first botanical work to consistently apply the [[binomial nomenclature]] system of naming to any large group of organisms (Linnaeus' [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|tenth edition]] of ''{{lang|la|[[Systema Naturae]]}}'' would apply the same technique to animals for the first time in 1758). Prior to this work, a plant species would be known by a long polynomial, such as ''{{lang|la|Plantago foliis ovato-lanceolatis pubescentibus, spica cylindrica, scapo tereti}}'' (meaning "[[Plantago|plantain]] with pubescent ovate-lanceolate leaves, a cylindrical spike and a terete scape")&lt;ref name="Cullen"/&gt; or ''{{lang|la|Nepeta floribus interrupte spicatis pedunculatis}}'' (meaning "''Nepeta'' with flowers in a stalked, interrupted spike").&lt;ref name="Spencer"/&gt; In ''{{lang|la|Species Plantarum}}'', these cumbersome names were replaced with two-part names, consisting of a single-word genus name, and a single-word [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] or "trivial name"; the two examples above became ''[[Plantago media]]'' and ''[[Nepeta cataria]]'', respectively.&lt;ref name="Cullen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spencer"&gt;{{cite book |author=Roger Spencer, Rob Cross &amp; Peter Lumley |year=2007 |title=Plant Names: a Guide to Botanical Nomenclature |edition=3rd |publisher=[[CSIRO Publishing]] |isbn=9780643099456 |chapter=Latin names, the binomial system and plant classification |pages=14–15 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wqTt-Oewk-8C&amp;pg=PA14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of binomial names had originally been developed as a kind of [[shorthand]] in a student project about the plants eaten by cattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Britannica Educational Publishing |year=2009 |title=The 100 Most Influential Scientists of All Time |publisher=[[Rosen Publishing Group]] |isbn=9781615300402 |chapter=Carolus Linnaeus |pages=93–97 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Aeu0s8TsbOoC&amp;pg=PA96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the specific epithet, Linnaeus gave a short description of each species, and a [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonymy]]. The descriptions were careful and terse, consisting of few words in small genera; in ''[[Glycyrrhiza]]'', for instance, the three species (''[[Glycyrrhiza echinata]]'', ''[[Glycyrrhiza glabra]]'' and "''Glycyrrhiza hirsuta''",{{#tag:ref|Now considered a synonym of ''G.&amp;nbsp;glabra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/research/projects/linnaean-typification/database/detail.dsml?ID=406900 |title=''Glycyrrhiza hirsuta'' Linnaeus |work=The Linnaean Plant Name Typification Project |publisher=[[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] |accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} respectively) were described as "''{{lang|la|leguminibus echinatis}}''", "''{{lang|la|leguminibus glabris}}''" and "''{{lang|la|leguminibus hirsutis}}''".&lt;ref name="Isely"&gt;{{cite book |author=Duane Isely |year=2002 |title=One Hundred and One Botanists |publisher=[[Purdue University Press]] |isbn=9781557532831 |chapter=Carl Linnaeus |pages=86–93 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=an6r8m0JfV8C&amp;pg=PA89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it is the first work in which binomial nomenclature was consistently applied, ''{{lang|la|Species Plantarum}}'' was chosen as the "starting point" for the [[botanical nomenclature|nomenclature]] of most plants (the nomenclature of some [[non-vascular plant]]s and all [[fungi]] uses later starting points).&lt;ref name="Cullen"&gt;{{cite book |author=Katherine E.

==Contents==
''{{lang|la|Species Plantarum}}'' contained descriptions of the thousands of plant species known to Linnaeus at the time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2534">The '''strict [[father]] model''' of parenting is one which values strict discipline, particularly by the father, in [[parenting]].

Ideas involved in this model include:
* That children learn through reward and [[Child discipline|punishment]], as in [[operant conditioning]]. [[Corporal punishment]], such as [[spanking]], is favored in this model relative to other models. 
* That children become more self-reliant and more [[self-discipline]]d by having strict parents.
* That the parent, particularly the father, is meant to mete out rewards for good behavior as well as punish bad behavior.

This model of child-rearing would involve, for example, [[Ferberization|allowing children to cry themselves to sleep]] on the grounds that picking up a child when it should be sleeping on its own improperly fosters dependence on the parents. In his book ''Dare to Discipline'', [[James Dobson]] advocates the strict father model.  However, some researchers have linked [[authoritarian parenting|authoritarian childrearing]] with children who withdraw, lack [[wikt:spontaneity|spontaneity]], and have lesser evidence of [[conscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Maccoby |first=E. E. |last2=Martin |first2=J. A.| year=1983 |chapter=Socialization in the context of the family: Parent-child interaction |title=Handbook of Child Psychology |volume=4 |editor-first=Paul.

The strict father model is discussed by [[George Lakoff]] in his books, including ''[[Moral Politics]],'' ''Don't Think of an Elephant,'' ''The Political Mind,'' and ''Whose Freedom?''. In these books, the strict father model is contrasted with the [[nurturant parent model]]. Lakoff argues that if the metaphor of nation as family and government as parent is used, then [[conservativism|conservative]] politics correspond to the strict father model. For example, conservatives think that adults should refrain from looking to the government for assistance lest they become dependent.

Since the mid-90's every year the law firm Surana and Surana International Attorneys have hosted, administered &amp; sponsored over a  hundred  moot court competitions (the count is till 2013 and continuing) in partnership with India's  leading law schools. This project is one of the largest of its kind in the world by any law firm. In the academic initiatives taken by corporates, Surana &amp; Surana stands as a benchmark in the whole legal fraternity. Probably this is what it means to be called as the "Pioneers of moot court competitions in India".

==History==
The '''Surana and Surana Moots''' project was initiated by the founder of Surana and Surana International Attorneys, P.S.Surana.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dtnext.in/News/City/2016/04/23234516/Dont-lose-principles-for-quick-money.vpf&lt;/ref&gt; One day in the late 80's, Honb'le Justice Krishna Iyer during his stay with the Surana family, spoke at length about the need to nurture young advocates with good advocacy skills. He was also concerned about the fact that bright young law graduates were joining the corporate sector, thereby depriving the Bar of a steady flow of good talent. This prompted  Mr. Surana  to plan  a well structured  &amp; transparent moot court competition platform for  law students  to develop skills in oral and  written  advocacy  as well as legal research. The cases prepared for the competitions are based on either emerging or unsettled areas of law. This requires participants to come up with innovative arguments which in turn helps develop new jurisprudence.

[[File:Digital Holographic Microscopy for measuring hip prosthesis roughness.png|thumb|Digital Holographic Microscope measuring hip prosthesis roughness]]
'''Surface roughness''' often shortened to '''roughness''', is a component of [[surface finish|surface texture]]. It is quantified by the deviations in the direction of the [[normal (geometry)|normal vector]] of a real surface from its ideal form. If these deviations are large, the surface is rough; if they are small, the surface is smooth. In [[surface metrology]], roughness is typically considered to be the high-frequency, short-wavelength component of a measured surface. However, in practice it is often necessary to know both the amplitude and frequency to ensure that a surface is fit for a purpose.

Roughness plays an important role in determining how a real object will interact with its environment. In [[tribology]], rough surfaces usually [[wear]] more quickly and have higher [[friction]] coefficients than smooth surfaces. Roughness is often a good predictor of the performance of a mechanical component, since irregularities on the surface may form nucleation sites for cracks or corrosion. On the other hand, roughness may promote [[adhesive|adhesion]]. Generally speaking, rather than scale specific descriptors, cross-scale descriptors such as [[fractal|surface fractality]] provide more meaningful predictions of mechanical interactions at surfaces including [[contact mechanics|contact stiffness]] &lt;ref name="surf"&gt;{{cite journal| last1= Zhai | first1=C. | last2= Gan |first2=Y. | last3= Hanaor | first3=D. | last4=Proust |first4=G. | last5=Retraint |first5=D. |title=  The Role of Surface Structure in Normal Contact Stiffness | journal= Experimental Mechanics  | year= 2016 |  volume=56 | issue=3 | pages=359–368| url= https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chongpu_Zhai/publication/283158084_The_Role_of_Surface_Structure_in_Normal_Contact_Stiffness/links/562d7b4b08ae04c2aeb4a68a.pdf | doi= 10.1007/s11340-015-0107-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[friction|static friction]].&lt;ref name="statfric"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Hanaor | first1= D. | last2=Gan |first2= Y. |last3=Einav | first3= I. | title= Static friction at fractal interfaces| journal= Tribology International | year=2016 | volume=93 | pages=229–238| url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283675011_Static_friction_at_fractal_interfaces}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a high roughness value is often undesirable, it can be difficult and expensive to control in [[manufacturing]]. For example, it is difficult and expensive to control surface roughness of fused deposition modelling (FDM) manufactured parts.&lt;ref&gt;http://manufacturingscience.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleid=2475087&lt;/ref&gt; 
Decreasing the roughness of a surface usually increases its manufacturing cost. This often results in a trade-off between the manufacturing cost of a component and its performance in application.

Roughness can be measured by manual comparison against a "surface roughness comparator" (a sample of known surface roughness), but more generally a [[surface profile measurement]] is made with a [[profilometer]]. These can be of the contact variety (typically a diamond stylus) or optical (e.g.: a white light [[interferometer]] or laser scanning confocal microscope).

However, controlled roughness can often be desirable. For example, a gloss surface can be too shiny to the eye and too slippery to the finger (a touchpad is a good example) so a controlled roughness is required. This is a case where both amplitude and frequency are very important.

==Parameters==
A roughness value can either be calculated on a profile (line) or on a surface (area). The profile roughness parameter (Ra, Rq,...) are more common. The area roughness parameters (Sa, Sq,...) give more significant values.

=== Profile roughness parameters ===
Each of the roughness parameters are calculated using a formula for describing the surface. Standard references that describe each in detail are Surfaces and their Measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitehouse|first=David|title=Surfaces and their Measurement|year=2012|location=Boston |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |isbn=978-0080972015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Roughness rus.png|600px|thumb]] The profile roughness parameters are included in BS EN ISO 4287:2000 British standard, identical with the ISO 4287:1997 standard.&lt;ref&gt;BS EN ISO 4287:2000, Geometrical product specification (GPS). Surface  texture. Profile method. Terms, definitions and surface texture parameters&lt;/ref&gt; The standard is based on the  ″M″ (mean line) system.
There are many different roughness parameters in use, but &lt;math&gt;Ra&lt;/math&gt; is by far the most common, though this is often for historical reasons and not for particular merit, as the early roughness meters could only measure &lt;math&gt;Ra&lt;/math&gt;. Other common parameters include &lt;math&gt;Rz&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Rq&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Rsk&lt;/math&gt;. Some parameters are used only in certain industries or within certain countries. For example, the &lt;math&gt;Rk&lt;/math&gt; family of parameters is used mainly for cylinder bore linings, and the ''Motif parameters'' are used primarily in the French automotive industry.&lt;ref&gt;Dietzsch M., Papenfluss K., Hartmann, T. ''The MOTIF method (ISO'' ''12085: 1996)- A suitable description for functional, manufactural and metrological requirements'', International Journal of Machine Tools and Manufacture, 1998, 38, No 5-6, pp. 625-632&lt;/ref&gt; The MOTIF method provides a graphical evaluation of a surface profile without filtering waviness from roughness. A ''motif'' consists of the portion of a profile between two peaks and the final combinations of these motifs eliminate ″insignificant″ peaks and retains ″significant″ ones.  Please note that &lt;math&gt;Ra&lt;/math&gt; is a dimensional unit that can be [[Micrometre|micrometer]] or [[microinch]].

Since these parameters reduce all of the information in a profile to a single number, great care must be taken in applying and interpreting them. Small changes in how the raw profile data is filtered, how the mean line is calculated, and the physics of the measurement can greatly affect the calculated parameter. With modern digital equipment, the scan can be evaluated to make sure there are no obvious glitches that skew the values.

Because it may not be obvious to many users what each of the measurements really mean, a simulation tool allows a user to adjust key parameters, visualizing how surfaces which are obviously different to the human eye are differentiated by the measurements. For example, &lt;math&gt;Ra&lt;/math&gt; fails to distinguish between two surfaces where one is composed of peaks on an otherwise smooth surface and the other is composed of troughs of the same amplitude. Such tools can be found in app format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SPE (Surface Profile Explorer) |url=http://www.stevenabbott.co.uk/AbbottApps/SPE/index.html |work=AbbottApps |publisher=Steven Abbott TCNF Ltd|first=Steven |last=Abbott|accessdate=January 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By convention every 2D roughness parameter is a capital R followed by additional characters in the subscript. The subscript identifies the formula that was used, and the R means that the formula was applied to a 2D roughness profile. Different capital letters imply that the formula was applied to a different profile. For example, Ra is the arithmetic average of the roughness profile, Pa is the arithmetic average of the unfiltered raw profile, and Sa is the arithmetic average of the 3D roughness.

Each of the formulas listed in the tables assume that the roughness profile has been filtered from the raw profile data and the mean line has been calculated. The roughness profile contains &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; ordered, equally spaced points along the trace, and &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; is the vertical distance from the mean line to the &lt;math&gt;i^\text{th}&lt;/math&gt; data point. Height is assumed to be positive in the up direction, away from the bulk material.

==== Amplitude parameters ====
Amplitude parameters characterize the surface based on the vertical deviations of the roughness profile from the mean line. Many of them are closely related to the parameters found in statistics for characterizing population samples. For example, &lt;math&gt;Ra&lt;/math&gt; is the [[arithmetic average]] value of filtered roughness profile determined from deviations about the center line within the evaluation length and &lt;math&gt;Rt&lt;/math&gt; is the [[range (statistics)|range]] of the collected roughness data points.

The arithmetic average roughness, &lt;math&gt;Ra&lt;/math&gt;, is the most widely used one-dimensional roughness parameter.

==== Slope, spacing, and counting parameters ====
Slope parameters describe characteristics of the slope of the roughness profile. Spacing and counting parameters describe how often the profile crosses certain thresholds. These parameters are often used to describe repetitive roughness profiles, such as those produced by [[turning]] on a [[lathe]].

&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Other "frequency" parameters are S&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;. S&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is the mean spacing between peaks. Just as with real mountains it is important to define a "peak". For S&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; the surface must have dipped below the mean surface before rising again to a new peak. The average wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; and the root mean square wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; are derived from &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;. When trying to understand a surface that depends on both amplitude and frequency it is not obvious which pair of metrics optimally describes the balance, so a statistical analysis of pairs of measurements can be performed (e.g.: R&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; or R&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; and Sm) to find the strongest correlation.

Common conversions:

==== Bearing ratio curve parameters ====
These parameters are based on the [[Abbott-Firestone curve|bearing ratio curve]] (also known as the Abbott-Firestone curve.) This includes the Rk family of parameters.

[[Image:Surface roughness skew2.svg|thumb|widthpx| Sketches depicting surfaces with negative and positive skew. The roughness trace is on the left, the amplitude distribution curve is in the middle, and the bearing area curve (Abbott-Firestone curve) is on the right.]]

==== Fractal theory ====
The mathematician [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] has pointed out the connection between surface roughness and [[fractal dimension]].&lt;ref name="Outeretal1995"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Den Outer |first1= A. |last2= Kaashoek |first2= J.F. |last3= Hack |first3= H.R.G.K. |year= 1995 |title= Difficulties of using continuous fractal theory for discontinuity surfaces |journal= International Journal of Rock Mechanics and Mining Science &amp; Geomechanics Abstracts |volume= 32 |number= 1 |pages= 3–9 |doi= 10.1016/0148-9062(94)00025-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The description provided by a [[fractal]] at the microroughness level may allow the control of the material properties and the type of the occurring chip formation. But fractals cannot provide a full-scale representation of a typical machined surface affected by tool feed marks, it ignores the geometry of the cutting edge. (J. Paulo Davim, 2010, ''op.cit''.).

===Areal roughness parameters===
{{further|ISO 25178{{!}}ISO 25178: Geometric Product Specifications (GPS) – Surface texture: areal}}
Areal roughness parameters are defined in the ISO 25178 series. The resulting values are Sa, Sq, Sz,... Many optical measurement instruments are able to measure the surface roughness over an area. Area measurements are also possible with contact measurement systems. Multiple, closely spaced 2D scans are taken of the target area. These are then digitally stitched together using relevant software, resulting in a 3D image and accompanying areal roughness parameters.

== Soil-surface roughness ==
Soil-surface roughness (SSR) refers to the vertical variations present in the micro- and macro-relief of a soil surface, as well as their stochastic distribution.  There are four distinct classes of SSR, each one of them representing a characteristic vertical length scale; the first class includes microrelief variations from individual soil grains to aggregates on the order of 0.053–2.0 mm; the second class consists of variations due to soil clods ranging between 2 and 100 mm; the third class of soil surface roughness is systematic elevation differences due to tillage, referred to as oriented roughness (OR), ranging between 100 and 300 mm;  the fourth class includes planar curvature, or macro-scale topographic features&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Römkens|first=M.J.M|last2=Helming|first2=K|last3=Prasad|first3=S.N|title=Soil erosion under different rainfall intensities, surface roughness, and soil water regimes|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0341816201001618|journal=CATENA|volume=46|issue=2-3|pages=103–123|doi=10.1016/s0341-8162(01)00161-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The two first classes account for the so-called microroughness, which has been shown to be largely influenced on an event and seasonal timescale by rainfall and tillage, respectively.  Microroughness is most commonly quantified by means of the Random Roughness, which is essentially the standard deviation of bed surface elevation data around the mean elevation, after correction for slope using the best-fit plane and removal of tillage effects in the individual height readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Total_Porosity_and_Random_Roughness_of_t.html?id=ipMYogEACAAJ|title=Total Porosity and Random Roughness of the Interrow Zone as Influenced by Tillage|last=Allmaras|first=R. R.|date=1966|publisher=Agricultural Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rainfall impact can lead to either a decay or increase in microroughnesss, depending upon initial microroughness conditions and soil properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=K. N. Potter|last2=Potter|first2=K.

However, a recent study which examined the response of smooth soil surfaces on rainfall showed that RR can considerably increase for low initial microroughness length scales in the order of 0 - 5 mm.  It was also shown that the increase or decrease is consistent among various SSR indices &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abban|first=B. K. B.|last2=Papanicolaou|first2=A. N.

==Practical effects==
Surface structure plays a key role in governing [[contact mechanics]],&lt;ref name="surf" /&gt; that is to say the mechanical behavior exhibited at an interface between two solid objects as they approach each other and transition from conditions of non-contact to full contact. In particular, [[normal contact stiffness]] is governed predominantly by asperity structures (roughness, surface slope and fractality) and material properties.

In terms of engineering surfaces, roughness is considered to be detrimental to part performance. As a consequence, most manufacturing prints establish an upper limit on roughness, but not a lower limit. An exception is in cylinder bores where oil is retained in the surface profile and a minimum roughness is required.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enginebuildermag.com/2000/09/cylinder-bore-surface-finishes/&lt;/ref&gt;

Surface structure is often closely related to the friction and wear properties of a surface.&lt;ref name="statfric" /&gt; A surface with a higher [[fractal dimension]], large &lt;math&gt;R_a&lt;/math&gt; value, or a positive &lt;math&gt;R_{sk}&lt;/math&gt;, will usually have somewhat higher friction and wear quickly. The peaks in the roughness profile are not always the points of contact. The form and waviness (i.e. both amplitude and frequency) must also be considered.

'''The Loft Literary Center''' is a nonprofit literary organization located in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]] incorporated in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Loft Literary Center: About the Loft |url=https://www.loft.org/about/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Loft is one of the nation’s largest and most comprehensive independent literary centers, and offers a variety of writing classes, conferences, grants, readings, writers' studios and other services to both established and emerging writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The New York Times: With Books as a Catalyst, Minneapolis Neighborhood Revives |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/30/realestate/commercial/30books.html?_r=3&amp;oref=slogin&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Loft Literary Center: Resources |url=https://www.loft.org/resources/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year the Loft hosts more than 400 writers and performers that draw more than 12,000 people, and collaborates with at least 30 local and national organizations. The Loft additionally claims to have more than 170,000 unique visitors through digital resources and online writing classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Loft Literary Center: Annual Report |url=https://www.loft.org/about/annual_report/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Inception===

Incorporated in 1975, the Loft started in a bookstore when a group of writers decided to offer classes and readings in the upstairs loft. Following a series of successful events held at Rusoff &amp; Co. Book Dealers in [[Dinkytown]], Minnesota, bookstore owner Marly Rusoff and writers Jim Moore, [[Patricia Hampl]], Phebe Hanson, and Michael Dennis Browne formed a ‘poets’ club’ with support from a fundraising party emceed by [[Garrison Keillor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Altered Scale: Rebecca Weaver on The Loft in the 70s |url=http://alteredscale.com/contentsandnavigation/rebecca-weaver-on-the-loft/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ‘poets’ club’ eventually became known as ‘The Loft,’ and in 1975 filed for nonprofit status and received a grant from the Minnesota State Arts Board to sponsor several writing workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Pioneer Press: Marly Rusoff: St. Paul native, Loft 'mother,' literary agent and now publisher |url=http://www.twincities.com/entertainment/ci_23974915/loft-mother-and-literary-agent-rusoff-is-now}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next two years, the Loft hosted a number of benefit readings that featured poets such as [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Robert Bly]], and [[Etheridge Knight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Minnesota Historical Society: Loft Literary Center |url=http://www2.mnhs.org/library/findaids/00213.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continued growth===

Over the years, the Loft grew organically as a community-based nonprofit to become one of the nation’s leading independent literary centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Minnesota Women's Press: A Home for Writers |url=http://www.womenspress.com/print.asp?ArticleID=2327&amp;SectionID=1&amp;SubSectionID=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; With support from the Jerome Foundation the Loft launched the Mentor Series in 1980, bringing together nationally prominent authors with promising local writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Jerome Foundation: The Loft Literary Center |url=http://www.jeromefdn.org/grantees/2008-loft-literary-center-mentor-series}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first year featured New York Times bestselling author [[Marge Piercy]] and Pulitzer Prize-winning poets [[Philip Levine (poet)|Philip Levine]] and [[Galway Kinnell]]. Other programs launched in the organization’s first decade include the McKnight Artist Fellowship in Creative Writing (1982), The Loft Scholarship Fund (1984), and a radio program in collaboration with [[Minnesota Public Radio]] (1985).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The McKnight Foundation: McKnight honors artists selected for fellowships and residencies in 30th year of fellowships program |url=http://www.mcknight.org/newsroom/news-releases/mcknight-honors-artists-selected-for-fellowships-and-residencies-in-30th-year-of-fellowships-program}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Loft membership passed the 2,000 mark, and in 1996 the Loft awarded more than $160,000 in grants to writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Loft Literary Center: History |url=https://www.loft.org/about/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social engagement===

The Loft initiated the Amnesty Action Project in 1988, which coordinated letter-writing campaigns on behalf of imprisoned writers as identified by [[Amnesty International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Minnesota Historical Society: Loft Literary Center |url=http://www2.mnhs.org/library/findaids/00213.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent Malawian poet [[Jack Mapanje]] was the first, followed by political prisoners Jaki Seroke, [[Zwelakhe Sisulu]], [[Nguyễn Chí Thiện]], [[Dai Qing]], Lee San-ha, and Bligesu Erenus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Minnesota Historical Society: Loft Literary Center |url=http://www2.mnhs.org/library/findaids/00213.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, WCCO anchor [[Dave Moore (newscaster)|Dave Moore]] read from [[Salman Rushdie]]’s Satanic Verses at the Loft in protest of [[Ayatollah Khomeini]]’s sentence of death on Rushdie. The reading was also a response from the Twin Cities Artistic Community Ad Hoc Committee in Protest of Censorship and Intimidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Loft Literary Center: History |url=https://www.loft.org/about/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the Loft hosted a week-long series of events celebrating freedom of expression that coincided with National Banned Books Week. The events included a dialogue with [[Kathy Acker]], [[Amiri Baraka]], and [[Nat Hentoff]]; a reading and forum with [[Lorrie Moore]] and [[Mona Simpson]]; free speech read-ins; and performance art with J. Otis Powell and Patrick Scully at the Rogue Nightclub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Loft Literary Center: History |url=https://www.loft.org/about/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000-present===

In 1999, the Loft joined forces with [[Minnesota Center for Book Arts]] and publisher [[Milkweed Editions]] to build the nonprofit literary and book arts center [[Open Book Minneapolis|Open Book]], which opened in May 2000 and is the current home of the Loft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=With Books as a Catalyst, Minneapolis Neighborhood Revives|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/30/realestate/commercial/30books.html|accessdate=2009-03-27 | work=The New York Times | first=Lisa | last=Chamberlain | date=2008-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This move was followed by the launch of the Loft Equilibrium Spoken Word Series in 2002, which was recognized with the Minnesota Nonprofit Anti-Racism Initiative Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Star Tribune:The Loft Literary Center awarded $150,000 grant for spoken word|url=http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/blogs/152329425.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the Loft hosted a reading by former senator and anti-war presidential candidate [[Eugene McCarthy]], and collaborated with the [[Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs]] and [[Minnesota International Center]] to host a discussion and book signing by former Secretary of State [[Madeleine Albright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Loft Literary Center: History |url=https://www.loft.org/about/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Loft celebrated its 35th anniversary with the publication release of ''Views from the Loft: A Portable Writer's Workshop'' and the launch of its online education program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Publishers Weekly: Views from the Loft: A Portable Writer's Workshop|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-57131-323-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Loft Literary Center: History |url=https://www.loft.org/about/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Loft now has an annual budget of over $2.4 million, and through contracts, awards, and grants pays writers more than $400,000 each year. The Loft annually serves thousands of writers by offering hundreds of classes, numerous fellowships, readings from award-winning authors, and literary resources such as a small library, writing studios, and a book club room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Loft Literary Center: Resources |url=https://www.loft.org/resources/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the Loft hired 227 writers to teach 323 classes and 5 conferences. In their evaluations, 96% of students reported that their class helped them improve their writing, 91% identified their next steps as a writer, and 94% would recommend their class to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Loft Literary Center: Annual Report |url=https://www.loft.org/about/annual_report/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jocelyn Hale has been Executive Director since 2007, when she replaced long-time leader Linda Myers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Loft Literary Center names new director |url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2007/07/20/loftdirector/|accessdate=2014-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Saga of Recluce''''' is a series of [[fantasy]] [[novel]]s written by [[L. E. Modesitt, Jr.]]. The initial novel in the series, ''The Magic of Recluce'' (from which the series derives its name), was published in 1991. The series is still in publication with the latest, ''Outcasts of Order'', published in June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Modesitt|first1=L.E.|title=Bibliography|url=http://www.lemodesittjr.com/the-books/saga-recluce/outcasts-of-order/|website=lemodesittjr.com|accessdate=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Modesitt stated that the then 20 novels in the ''Recluce'' series had sold nearly three million copies.&lt;ref name="3mil"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lemodesittjr.com/2015/04/21/perspective-on-the-hugos/ |title=Perspective on the Hugos |last=Modesitt, Jr. |first=L. E. |date=2015-04-21 |accessdate=2015-04-21 |publisher=lemodesittjr.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 20 books of the series describe the changing, often confrontational, relationship between the descendants of two technologically advanced cultures, representatives of whom have been marooned on a sparsely inhabited world and regressed to the level of the existing inhabitants' primitive technology. Themes of gender stereotyping, sexism, ageism, racism, ethics, economics, environmentalism and politics are explored in the course of the series, which examines the world through the eyes of its protagonists.

The series is published outside of internal chronological order. The first book published in the series occurs near the end of the overall story, with subsequent books jumping further into the past to expand on elements of history. The author recommends reading the books in publication order. As of the eighteenth novel, ''Heritage of Cyador'', the saga covers eight different time periods and eleven major story lines. The stories demonstrate the progression of real-life events into myth and legend over the progression of centuries, as the characters in one book will be known as heroes or mythical figures in other, chronologically later books. Additionally, certain characters appear in multiple books, the protagonists in one novel, appearing as a supporting characters in others.

Within the Recluce universe, all matter has inherent properties called "order" and "chaos".  Magic manifests as a person's ability to manipulate these properties through thought.  The feats which are feasible depend on the user's (genetically limited) potential, on developing those abilities, and on the laws that govern the interaction and balance between the two forces in nature.  Generally, those who manipulate order are called (black) mages.  Those who manipulate chaos are called (white) wizards.  Rare individuals (grays) can manipulate both.  There are personal costs to using magic, both immediate and long term.

*''Recluce Tales'' (January 3, 2017)

==Plot==
===Setting===
All of the novels take place in the same [[fantasy]] universe, spanning a time period of almost two thousand years.

Within this universe, all matter is made up of two competing forces: order and chaos.  In their natural state, these forces are equally matched, in a condition called Balance.  These two forces can be seen as fantasy representations of the natural entropy (chaos) that occurs in matter, balanced by the various molecular forces (order) that bind matter into structured forms.  These forces are understood, at a basic level, by all inhabitants of the world.  The colour white is identified with chaos; black with order.  The first published novel explains it this way: white is the chaotic combination of all wavelengths of visible light, while black is the absence of this light.

Rare individuals within the universe possess the inborn ability to manipulate these forces.  White wizards can draw chaos from a surrounding area and focus it into bolts of flame.  Black mages can concentrate order into matter, making it unnaturally strong.  Both forces can be used to kill or to shield.  Both types of wielders can, to a degree, discern the presence of both forces.  People who are being deceptive emanate chaos.

Gray mages are extremely rare.  They manipulate both order and chaos.  They are among the most powerful characters in the series.  They can prolong their lives and perform awesome magical feats.  "Grays" can choose the lifestyle of a Druid.  Druids live in seclusion and are far less known.  They exercise magic differently.

Part of the plot in each novel involves protagonists discovering novel ways to wield chaos and order.  Individuals vary significantly in innate magical strength and in skill at wielding it.  They improve through practice, personal experimentation, and by studying written lore (which is scant and cryptic).

The manipulation of chaos comes at a price: over time, it imbues a wizard, accelerating the deterioration of everything around him or her (example: wine turning to vinegar almost before the wizard can drink it).  Those wizards who channel chaos through their bodies (nearly all of them) have short lifespans, inversely proportional to the amount of chaos they raise.  Some have found ways to reduce this effect.  Additionally, any living being that is exposed to much chaos (such as the inhabitants of Fairhaven) experiences a burning sensation upon touching an ordered object, akin to touching an extremely cold object.  The effect's severity is proportional to the accumulated chaos.  For White Wizards, the result is often death.

The manipulation of order has costs too.  Wielding it carelessly can drain a mage of the order needed to sustain life (example: absent-mindedly stroking one's wooden staff).  Exceptional mages in the series discover ways to use order to funnel chaos, working around their inabilitity to manipulate chaos directly.  This is effective in combat but large actions backlash on the wielder because death itself releases chaos.  The unleashed chaos harms the mage.  It can cause disorientation, even sensory deprivation, for timespans proportional to the amount of destruction.

Most wielders of magic were marooned onto the world of Recluce from another universe. The new arrivals were not magical before arriving.  The influx of magic from the other universe occurred twice.  The ancestors of the people who wield white chaos were stranded first.  The ancestors of those who wield black order were marooned 600 years later.  Offspring can usually inherit magical abilities.

The native people have medieval technology.  Both groups of newcomers were space-farers but, in time, descend to the level of the locals.

Most of the novels take place long after these arrivals.  The reader discovers these matters through quotes and legends peppered throughout the series.  ''[[Fall of Angels]]'' provides a brief glimpse into that other universe.  Wizards descend from Rationalists ("Rats", "Demons").  Mages descend from Angels.  The Rationalists and Angels were separate cultures of a space-faring people in another universe.  The cultures were engaged in a war that spanned generations.  The technology, weaponry, and ideology of each culture is reflected in the magical abilities, hair colour, and world views of their descendants in the Recluce universe.

The arrival of the Angels is described in ''[[Fall of Angels]]'': a space warship, the ''Winterlance'', is part of an Angel fleet attacking a Rationalist blockade.  The Angels are losing.  During the battle, an exceptional event occurs: energy weapons of opposite types align and focus on the Winterlance.  The result is surprising: instead of being destroyed, the ship materializes elsewhere.  From various evidence, the crew concludes that they are in an alternate universe, ruled by different physical laws.  The ship no longer functions but it is close to a habitable planet, and the crew crash lands there.  Soon, individuals discover strange talents and physical changes (such as hair colour) that will ultimately become linked to order magic.  Upon contacting the planet's locals, they discover that Rationalists are also present on the planet.

===Chronology===
Chronologically, the series spans 1,855&amp;nbsp;years.{{efn|[http://www.travelinlibrarian.info/recluce/recluce/chronology.html Chronology] on the author's "Official Fan Site"}} The story actually begins well before even the earliest novel, with the arrival of the "demons of light" from another universe. Using their manifest chaos powers as well as their advanced technology, these people create an empire called Cyador, on the continent of Candar. While the series is named after Recluce, that island is uninhabited for the first millennium of the story.

The first two books, chronologically, are ''Magi'i of Cyador'' and ''Scion of Cyador'', which describe the operation of the Cyador army and its battles against the natives of Candar. These novels primarily serve to flesh out a formerly unknown part of the history of the universe. The story does establish one key element in the history of Cyador: the ultimate decline of the advanced technology of the Rationalists. Initially, upon landing on a mostly-uninhabited part of one of the world's continents, the Rationalists (later known as Demons) managed to create a number of advanced mechanical devices, powered by chaos. They also erected a number of collection towers that were used to focus chaos into these devices. By the time of the first novel, these towers are failing, and the empire is losing the ability to maintain its advanced technology. The opening of ''Magi'i of Cyador'' is usually considered "Year 1" in the history of Recluce.

''The Fall of Angels'', 400&amp;nbsp;years later, details the arrival of the Angels and the founding of the female-dominated city of Westwind. Unlike the Demons, the Angels manipulate order.  Of note are two specific angels, Nylan and Ryba, who would become legendary figures in coming novels. Ryba develops a talent for prophecy.  Her extensive writings are quoted by future generations as ''The Book of Ryba'', while Nylan develops the foundations of order magic. Nylan also fathers the child Weryl. In ''The Chaos Balance'', Nylan leaves Westwind for a more direct confrontation with Cyador. By this time, the fire-wagons and fire-lances that were once central to the empire have vanished, and the empire is fully dependent on its chaos wizards. The ultimate result of this confrontation is the founding of the Druids, which take up residence in a magically active forest called The Accursed Forest by the natives, but The Great Forest of Naclos in later generations.

Set ten years after the events in ''The Chaos Balance'', ''Arms-Commander'' follows the story of Saryn, the head of the guards of Westwind.  She tries to protect Westwind, as political and military problems build in the surrounding countries of Gallos, Lornth, and Suthya.  In this novel, characters indicate that almost 10 generations have passed since the reign of Lorn in Cyador.

Decades after the fall of Cyador, ''Cyador's Heirs'' finds its survivors have reestablished themselves in Cigoerne, a fertile country coveted by hostile neighbors in less hospitable lands. Young Lerial, the second son of Duke Kiedron, lives in the shadow of his older brother Lephi, the heir to their father's realm. Lerial's future seems preordained: He will one day command his brother's forces in defense of Cigoerne, serving at his older sibling's pleasure and no more. But when Lerial is sent abroad to be fostered by Major Altyrn to learn the skills and wisdom he will need to fulfill his future duties, he begins a journey into a much larger world that brings out his true potential. Lerial has talents that few, as yet, suspect: he is one of those rare beings who can harness both Order and Chaos, the competing natural forces that shape the world and define the magic that exists within it. And as war finally engulfs the fringes of Cigoerne, Lerial's growing mastery of Order and Chaos is tested to its limits
and his own.

Generations after the Angels reshaped the political climate in central Candar, the Prefect of Gallos seeks for an excuse to start another war with Westwind in the opening of ''The Mongrel Mage''. The Prefect sends three white mages with an escort to investigate 'raids' in the bordering plains between the two powers. Those mages are Beltur, his prominent white mage uncle, and his uncle's apprentice. After their findings displease the Prefect and his high mages, Beltur's uncle sacrifices himself so the young man can flee. With the aid of Jesslya, a young healer, Beltur travels to Elparta in Spidlar alongside a black mage named Athaal. Beltur, always considered weak as a white mage, is revealed to be a black, or possibly gray, mage. In Elparta he increases his skills in order magic, finds works serving in the city patrol and helping a coppersmith forge cupridium, and strives to recover from the turmoil of Gallos. Soon, however, he discovers he cannot escape his past, as the Prefect and his white mages decide to conquer Elparta with their powerful army. Recruited into Elparta's defense, Beltur excels as an arms-mage, bolstered by his desire to defend his new home and its people which now includes Jesslya, her mother, and many other recent friends. The victory of Elparta is marred by the loss of Athaal who Beltur was unable to save in battle. In ''Outcasts of Order'' Beltur attempts to return to his daily routine immediately after the war with Gallos but intrigue among the Trader's Council and the local group of black mages removes any chance he has to make Elparta his permanent home. He begins to train the young daughter of a black mage who is destined to be a powerful chaos wielder. Forced to flee after defending himself and his coppersmith partner from two murderous black mages, Beltur travels to Axalt as the request of the smith and with Jesslya as his new consort. Adjusting to a new life in Axalt grows increasingly complicated as once again the powerful are threatened by his presence. When his white mage apprentice and her family are exiled from Elparta they seek refuge with Beltur in Axalt. Despite assistance from the coppersmith's family Beltur, Jesslya and their guests are barely able to secure permission to stay. When he is unable to prevent a murder, Beltur tries to enact some justice for it, but ultimately is forced out of another city. Remembering an invitation from a mysterious trader in Montgren, Beltur and Jesslya travel with the young white mage and her family to the small duchy to seek a better life. Surviving bandit raids and surveying local power structures along the way, Beltur's followers arrive in Montgren to find themselves not only welcome, but expected. The Duchess offers them an enticing prospect - they can become the new council for a practically abandoned town, making it a home shaped in their own image. Beltur accepts and pledges to manage the town, Haven, as a place where mages of both chaos and order will be welcome. 

500&amp;nbsp;years after the arrival of the Angels, in ''The Towers of Sunset'', Cyador is long gone. But, half-way across the continent of Candar, towards the East, is Fairhaven: a city-state ruled by an oligarchy of white wizards.  Their prejudices and their written history imply that Fairhaven was founded by descendants of Cyador.  Westwind is the bulwark of the matriarchal societies of Western Candar which hold to the Legend of Ryba. Westwind is under threat from the white wizards of the city of Fairhaven, which exerts a great deal of influence over the male-dominated lands of Eastern Candar. A very strong order mage, Creslin, who is suggested to be the son of Weryl and grandson of the first "black mage" Nylan, flees female-dominated Westwind prior to an arranged marriage, only to be pursued by the white wizards who fear his strength. He ultimately escapes Candar, having married a chaos wizard in the process, and sails to the uninhabited island of Recluce. Here, Creslin begins a society based entirely on order magic. We also begin to learn the dangers of widespread order or chaos magic, as Creslin's unskilled efforts to make Recluce habitable cause severe weather elsewhere in the world, including massive storms, hurricanes, floods and droughts.

Several hundred years later, the chaos wizards in Candar have managed to conquer almost the entire continent. Beginning in the year 1190, ''The White Order'' and ''Colors of Chaos'' depict the progress of a young chaos wizard named Cerryl as he rises in the ranks of the white wizards. He is constantly fending off attempts on his life from the extremely powerful wizard Jeslek, who has begun to literally raise mountains from the ground to protect the paved highways the chaos wizards have been creating across Candar. At the same time, in the year 1200, ''The Magic Engineer'' details the journey of Dorrin, an order mage from Recluce. This is the point, both chronologically and to the reader, where the importance of balance between chaos and order starts to become apparent. (There are some hints in this regard in the first novel, but here the underlying causes are explained more fully.) Creslin's attempts to focus order around Recluce have led to an abundance of "free chaos" elsewhere in the world. This has led to increasingly stronger chaos wizards, ultimately leading to the formation of a 'chaos-focus' in the wizard Jeslek, granting him extraordinary strength. This, in turn, is allowing more order to be focused in Recluce, until something catastrophic happens to reset the balance.

Dorrin begins using order magic with his innate engineering talent to create steam-powered machines from order-infused wood and metal.  These are capable of containing large amounts of chaos energy. Of particular note are the extremely fast and powerful warships that Recluce begins to build, after Dorrin demonstrates their usefulness. The vast amount of order concentrated in these ships will accelerate the growth of chaos in the world. Dorrin spends some time in Candar fighting off the white wizards, then returns to Recluce to become the first "order engineer" and founds what later becomes the major city on Recluce, named after Nylan from "The Fall of Angels". Meanwhile, Jeslek is ultimately destroyed in his confrontation with Dorrin, leading to Cerryl becoming High Wizard and attempting some measure of truce with Recluce.

In 1500, the story continues with ''Natural Ordermage'' and ''Mage-Guard of Hamor''. It deals with the familiar motif of exile for a budding mage as yet unable and/or unwilling to control his newfound powers, this time on the continent-country of Hamor. The switch (which is a Modesitt trademark) from a pro-Recluce viewpoint to one inside the heretofore vilified Hamorian empire provides a probing look at prejudice, and also lays bare the conflict and corruption within the Recluce society and organizations at that time. Rahl, an apprentice scrivener with no taste for responsibility or accountability, is discovered by the magisters of Recluce to have an inordinately strong grasp of certain order abilities. As their methods are not suited to instruct one such as him he is exiled to Hamor. Caught in the middle of a conspiracy immediately after his arrival, Rahl soon finds himself in the infamous penal ironworks of Luba only to escape them when his abilities surface. As a mage-guard of the Empire he finds himself forced to become more than he was in order to survive first as a patroller and then as an officer in an army during a civil war.

After centuries of relative peace, in 1650, ''The Order War'' depicts the progress of two order mages from Recluce, Justen and Gunnar, as they attempt to defend the last free country in Candar from the white wizards, who have begun to use order-based soldiers to add to their own defense while simultaneously increasing their own chaos powers by increasing the amount of order in the world, as according to the plans of Cerryl from ''The White Order'' and ''Colors of Chaos''.  During their journey, Justen transitions himself into a gray mage, and is ultimately driven into the forest of Naclos, where he becomes a Druid. We also meet several legendary figures, including Ayrlyn (the wife of Nylan and one of the original angels) and the still alive Weryl, and learn how the Druids' mastery of both order and chaos has enabled them to keep their bodies alive for thousands of years. Justen leaves the forest and returns to fight the chaos wizards, and uses his newfound knowledge of order and chaos balance mastery to
form a tremendous weapon. This weapon unleashes the apocalyptic event that has been building for centuries, drawing on vast amounts of both order and chaos to utterly destroy the chaos wizards' capital city and kill nearly all of the powerful chaos wizards in the process. The result of this is a dramatic reduction in both free order and free chaos in the world.

Another diversionary storyline begins in 1710, with ''Wellspring of Chaos'' and ''Ordermaster'' depicting the life of an unlikely mage named Kharl. This storyline (which spans the continents of Nordla and Austra) tells the story of Kharl's transition from cooper to order-mage. Kharl becomes a powerful self-taught order-mage, an unlikely hero, and reputedly the most powerful black mage outside of Recluce during this time period. The two books flesh out the resistance of Nordla and Austra to the Empire of Hamor's attempts to expand their influence on the two continents. Notable characters from previous books of the series make brief appearances, including the gray wizard Justen. The two books flesh out two of the areas of the world that were mostly ignored in earlier novels and provides insight into the evolution of the Empire of Hamor, which plays a prominent part at the end of the series.

The final part of the saga occurs in the year 1850 and begins with ''The Magic of Recluce''. Gunnar, who has kept himself and his family alive using druidic techniques taught by his brother Justen, sends his son Lerris (who is unaware of his father's history and his own magical potential) to Candar to undertake a rite of passage commonly administered to dissatisfied individuals living in Recluce, especially those who have an affinity or ability for either order or chaos. While exiled to Candar, Lerris meets his uncle Justen, and comes to understand his father's ulterior motives for sending him off. Centuries of dominance by Recluce and their order engineers has once again led to increasingly more powerful chaos wizards in Candar, with one in particular threatening to cause trouble on the scale of the white council. Gunnar has sent Lerris to Candar with the suspicion that a strong order mage and strong chaos wizard will ultimately be drawn into direct conflict, and that Lerris would take care of the
problem without Recluce being directly involved. Lerris ultimately defeats the white wizard and settles down in Candar to live as a woodworker.

The climax of the story, 5 years later, in ''The Death of Chaos'' sees the powerful Empire of Hamor, the oldest inhabited continent in the world, has been using the relative instability of the rest of the world to consolidate its power. In the final climactic battle on the shores of Recluce, Lerris and his family use their mastery of order and chaos to forcibly impose a balance on the world, unleasing vast amounts of subterranean lava directly into the ocean beneath the invading Hamorian forces. In the end, Lerris uses the vast amounts of order in Recluce to bind all of the free chaos into small, balanced units (again, strongly reminiscent of particle physics). The result is the destruction of nearly all of the order and chaos magic in the world, including Lerris's family (which was being kept alive by magic) and even parts of the continent of Recluce itself.

==Reception==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2008}}
''The Magic of Recluce'' used a first-person viewpoint. The story is told from the perspective of the lead character, Lerris, but will switch to third person for any scenes in which Lerris is not involved. Many critics found this style of writing difficult to follow.

Some critics have become unhappy with perceived repetition; one fan sarcastically described the series as "[[Horatio Alger]] meets [[sword and sorcery]]." In particular, the stories of Lerris, Creslin, Dorrin, Cerryl, Lorn, and Rahl all seem to follow the same basic mold, of a young mage forced to "find himself" while learning to harness his power in ways other people discourage. Modesitt disputes this, claiming that (including his multiple non-Recluce novels) that "more than 60% of my books feature characters... older than 30 and more than 40% feature characters older than 40". He credits the criticism to a belief that "people confuse characters who learn something with young people discovering themselves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemodesittjr.com/blogs/monthly_question/2009/09/september-questions.html|title=Your Questions for the Author Answered - September Questions|last=Modesitt, Jr.|first=L. E.|date=September 2009|publisher=lemodesittjr.com|accessdate=5 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the elements of this series reappear in Modesitt's other  series, [[Spellsong Cycle|The Spellsong Cycle]], including the appearance of outsiders from other worlds with profound magical ability, as well as the reuse of the "ultimate weapon" used by both Justen and Secca in their respective climactic battles.

[[File:Piero della Francesca 042 Flagellation.jpg|thumb|upright=2.00|[[Piero della Francesca]], ''[[The Flagellation (Piero della Francesca)|The Flagellation of Christ]]''.]]
This article about '''the development of themes in Italian Renaissance painting''' is an extension to the article [[Italian Renaissance painting]], for which it provides additional pictures with commentary. The works encompassed are from [[Giotto]] in the early 14th century to [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|Last Judgement]]'' of the 1530s.

The themes that preoccupied painters of the Italian Renaissance were those of both subject matter and execution- what was painted and the style in which it was painted. The artist had far more freedom of both subject and style than did a [[Medieval]] painter. Certain characteristic elements of [[Renaissance]] painting evolved a great deal during the period. These include perspective, both in terms of how it was achieved and the effect to which it was applied, and realism, particularly in the depiction of humanity, either as symbolic, portrait or narrative element.

==Themes==
The ''[[The Flagellation (Piero della Francesca)|Flagellation of Christ]]'' by [[Piero della Francesca]] (above) demonstrates in a single small work many of the themes of Italian Renaissance painting, both in terms of compositional elements and subject matter. Immediately apparent is Piero's mastery of perspective and light. The architectural elements, including the tiled floor which becomes more complex around the central action, combine to create two spaces. The inner space is lit by an unseen light source to which Jesus looks. Its exact location can be pinpointed mathematically by an analysis of the diffusion and the angle of the shadows on the coffered ceiling. The three figures who are standing outside are lit from a different angle, from both daylight and light reflected from the pavement and buildings.

The religious theme is tied to the present. The ruler is a portrait of the visiting Emperor of [[Constantinople|Byzantium]].&lt;ref&gt;John VIII Palaeologus&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flagellation]] is also called "scourging". The term "scourge" was applied to the [[Plague (disease)|plague]]. Outside stand three men representing those who buried the body of Christ. The two older, [[Nicodemus]] and [[Joseph of Arimathaea]], are believed to be portraits of men who recently lost their sons, one of them to plague. The third man is the young disciple [[St. John the Evangelist|John]], and is perhaps a portrait of one of the sons, or else represents both of them in a single idealised figure, coinciding with the manner in which Piero painted angels.

==Elements of Renaissance painting==
Renaissance painting differed from the painting of the Late Medieval period in its emphasis upon the close observation of nature, particularly with regards to human anatomy, and the application of scientific principles to the use of perspective and light.
&lt;!---NOTE RE FORMAT: These galleries are carefully arranged in a 4 per row format. This has been done in order to facilitate comaparisons between adjacent paintings, both horizontally and vertically. In other words, they are laid out with the same care as the curator empoys in a realworld gallery exhibition. Please do not return them to the "single row" format, as it is counterproductive to this particular article.---&gt;

===Linear perspective===
The pictures in the gallery below show the development of linear perspective in buildings and cityscapes. 
* In [[Giotto]]'s fresco, the building is like a stage set with one side open to the viewer.
* In [[Paolo Uccello]]'s fresco, the townscape gives an impression of depth.
* [[Masaccio]]'s ''[[holy Trinity (Masaccio)|Holy Trinity]]'' was painted with carefully calculated mathematical proportions, in which he was probably assisted by the architect [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]].
* [[Fra Angelico]] uses the simple motif of a small [[loggia]] accurately drafted to create an intimate space.
* [[Gentile Bellini]] has painted a vast space, the [[Piazza San Marco]] in [[Venice]], in which the receding figures add to the sense of perspective.
* [[Leonardo da Vinci]] did detailed and measured drawings of the background Classical ruins preparatory to commencing the unfinished ''Adoration of the Magi''.
* [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] created an exceptionally complex and expansive setting on three levels, including a steeply descending ramp and a jutting wall. Elements of the landscape, such as the church on the right, are viewed partly through other structures.
* [[Raphael]]'s design for ''Fire in the Borgo'' shows buildings around a small square in which the background events are highlighted by the perspective.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Landscape===
The depiction of landscape was encouraged by the development of linear perspective and the inclusion of detailed landscapes in the background of many [[Early Netherlandish painting]]s of the 15th century. Also through this influence came an awareness of [[atmospheric perspective]] and the observation of the way distant things are affected by light. 
* Giotto uses a few rocks to give the impression of a mountain setting.
* Paolo Uccello has created a detailed and surreal setting as a stage for many small scenes.
* In [[Vittore Carpaccio|Carpaccio]]'s ''Deposition of the Body of Christ'', the desolate rocky landscape echoes the tragedy of the scene.
* [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]'s landscape has a sculptural, three-dimensional quality that is suggestive of a real physical space. The details of the rocks, their strata and fractures, suggest that he studied the [[geology|geological]] formations of the red [[limestone]] prevalent in areas of Northern Italy.
* [[Antonello da Messina]] sets the grim scene of the ''[[Crucifixion (Antonello da Messina)|Crucifixion]]'' in contrast to the placid countryside which rolls into the far distance, becoming paler and bluer as it recedes.
* [[Giovanni Bellini]] has created a detailed landscape with a pastoral scene between the foreground and background mountains. There are numerous levels in this landscape, making it the equivalent of Ghirlandaio's complex cityscape (above).
* [[Perugino]] has set the ''Adoration of the Magi'' against the familiar hilly landscape of [[Umbria]].
* Leonardo da Vinci, displays a theatrical use of [[atmospheric perspective]] in his view of the precipitous mountains around [[Lago di Garda]] at the foothills of the [[Alps]] in Northern Italy.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Light===
Light and shade exist in a painting in two forms. Tone is simply the lightness and darkness of areas of a picture, graded from white to black. Tonal arrangement is a very significant feature of some paintings. [[Chiaroscuro]] is the modelling of apparent surfaces within a picture by the suggestion of light and shadow. While tone was an important feature of paintings of the Medieval period, chiaroscuro was not. It became increasingly important to painters of the 15th century, transforming the depiction of three-dimensional space.
* [[Taddeo Gaddi]]'s ''Annunciation to the Shepherds'' is the first known large painting of a night scene. The internal light source of the picture is the angel.
* In [[Fra Angelico]]'s painting, daylight, which appears to come from the actual window of the friary cell which this fresco adorns, gently illuminates the figures and defines the architecture.
* In his [[Histories of the True Cross|''Emperor's Dream'']], [[Piero della Francesca]] takes up the theme of the night scene illuminated by an angel and applies his scientific knowledge of the diffusion of light. The tonal pattern thus created is a significant element in the composition of the painting.
* In his ''[[Agony in the Garden (Bellini)|Agony in the Garden]]'', [[Giovanni Bellini]] uses the fading sunset on a cloudy evening to create an atmosphere of tension and impending tragedy.
* In [[Domenico Veneziano]]'s formal portrait, the use of chiaroscuro to model the form is slight. However, the painting relies strongly on the tonal contrasts of the pale face, mid-tone background and dark garment with patterned bodice for effect.
* [[Botticelli]] uses chiaroscuro to model the face of the sitter and define the details of his simple garment. The light and shadow on the edge of the window define the angle of the light.
* The suggested authorship of this early-16th-century portrait {{Clarify |reason=Unclear which painting; refer to by name|date=October 2018}} includes [[Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio]], [[Mariotto Albertinelli]] and [[Giuliano Bugiardini]]. The painting combines many of the lighting effects of the other works in this gallery. The form is modelled by the light and shade, as if by a setting sun, which gives an element of drama, enhanced by the landscape. The tonal pattern created by the dark garment, the white linen and position of the hand is a compositional feature of the painting.
* In [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[St. John the Baptist (Leonardo)|John the Baptist]]'', elements of the painting, including the corners of the model's eyes and mouth, are disguised by shadow, creating an air of ambiguity and mystery.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Anatomy===
While remaining largely dependent upon topographic observation, the knowledge of anatomy was advanced by Leonardo da Vinci's meticulous dissection of 30 corpses. Leonardo, among others, impressed upon students the necessity of the close observation of life and made the drawing of live models an essential part of a student's formal study of the art of painting. 
* [[Cimabue]]'s ''[[Crucifix (Cimabue, Santa Croce)|Crucifixion]]'', extensively destroyed by flood in 1966, shows the formal arrangement, with curving body and drooping head that was prevalent in late Medieval art. The anatomy is strongly stylised to conform with traditional iconic formula.
* [[Giotto]] abandoned the traditional formula and painted from observation.
* [[Massacio]]'s figure of Christ is foreshortened as if viewed from below, and shows the upper torso strained as if with the effort of breathing.
* In [[Giovanni Bellini]]'s ''Deposition'' the artist, while not attempting to suggest the brutal realities of the crucifixion, has attempted to give the impression of death.
* In [[Piero della Francesca]]'s ''Baptism'', the robust figure of Jesus is painted with a simplicity and lack of sharply defined muscularity that belies its naturalism.
* The figure of Jesus in this painting, which is the combined work of [[Verrocchio]] and the young Leonardo, has in all probability been drafted by Verrocchio. The contours retain the somewhat contorted linearity of Gothic art. Much of the torso, however, is thought to have been painted by Leonardo and reveals a strong knowledge of anatomical form.
* Leonardo's picture of St. Jerome shows the results of detailed study of the shoulder girdle, known from a page of drawings.
* [[Michelangelo]] used human anatomy to great expressive effect. He was renowned for his ability in the creation of expressive poses and was imitated by many other painters and sculptors.

===Realism===
The observation of nature meant that set forms and symbolic gestures which in Medieval art, and particularly the Byzantine style prevalent in much of Italy, were used to convey meaning, were replaced by the representation of human emotion as displayed by a range of individuals. 
*In this ''Resurrection'', [[Giotto]] shows the sleeping soldiers with faces hidden by helmets or foreshortened to emphasise the relaxed posture.
*In contrast, [[Andrea Castagno]] has painted a life-sized image of the condotierre, Pippo Spano, alert and with his feet over the edge of the painted niche which frames him.
*[[Filippo Lippi]] in this early work shows a very naturalistic group of children crowding around the Virgin Mary, but looking with innocent curiosity at the viewer. One of the children has [[Down syndrome]].
* [[Masaccio]] depicts the grief resulting from loss of innocence as [[Adam and Eve]] are expelled from the presence of God.
* [[Antonello da Messina]] painted several versions of ''[[Ecce Homo (Antonello da Messina)|Ecce Homo]]'', the tormented Christ as he was presented to the people by the Roman Governor. Such paintings usually show Christ in a tragic but heroic role, minimising the depiction of suffering. Antonello's depictions are starkly realistic.
* In his ''[[Dead Christ (Mantegna)|Lamentation over the Dead christ]]'', [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] has here depicted the dead body of Jesus with daring foreshortening, as if the viewer were standing at the end of the slab.
* In this detail from a larger painting, Mantegna shows a little child, wearing a tummy-binder and holey slippers, turning away and chewing its fingers while the infant Christ is circumcised.
* [[Giorgione]] paints a natural and unglamorised portrait of an old woman, unusual in its depiction of her illkempt hair and open mouth with crooked teeth.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Figure composition===
Among the preoccupations of artists commissioned to do large works with multiple figures were how to make the subject, usually narrative, easily read by the viewer, natural in appearance and well composed within the picture space. 
* [[Giotto]] combines three separate narrative elements into this dramatic scene set against the dehumanising helmets of the guards. [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] betrays [[Jesus]] to the soldiers by kissing him. The High Priest signals to a guard to seize him. Peter slices the ear off the high priest's servant as he steps forward to lay hands on Jesus. Five figures dominate the foreground, surrounding Jesus so that only his head is visible. Yet by skillful arrangement of color and the gestures of the men, Giotto makes the face of Jesus the focal point of the painting.
* In ''The Death of Adam'', [[Piero della Francesca]] has set the dying patriarch so that he is cast into relief against the black garment worn by one of his family. His importance to the story is further emphasised by the arch of figures formed around him and the diagonals of the arms which all lead to his head. p
* ''The Resurrection of the Son of Theophilus'' is a remarkably cohesive whole, considering that it was begun by [[Masaccio]], left unfinished, vandalised, and eventually completed by [[Filippino Lippi]]. Masaccio painted the central section.
* [[Pollaiuolo]], in this highly systemised painting, has taken the [[cross-bow]] used by the archers in the foreground, as the compositional structure. Within this large triangular shape, divided vertically, he has alternated the figures between front and back views.
* [[Botticelli]]'s long, narrow painting of ''[[Venus and Mars (Botticelli)|Mars and Venus]]'' is based on a W with the figures mirroring each other. The lovers, who shortly before were united, are now separated by sleep. The three small fawns who process across the painting hold the composition together.
* [[Michelangelo]]s mastery of complex figure composition, as in his ''[[Deposition (Michelangelo)|The Entombment]]'' was to inspire many artists for centuries. In this panel painting the figure of Christ, though vertical, is slumped and a dead weight at the centre of the picture, while those who try to carry the body lean outwards to support it.
* At first glance, [[Signorelli]]'s ''Fall of the Damned'' is an appalling and violent jumble of bodies, but by the skilful placement of the figures so that the lines, rather than intersecting, flow in an undulating course through the picture, the composition is both unified and resolved into a large number of separate actions. The colours of the devils also serve to divide the picture into the tormentors and the tormented.
* ''The Battle of Ostia'' was executed by [[Raphael]]'s assistants, probably to his design. The foreground of the painting is organised into two overlapping arched shapes, the larger showing captives being subdued, while to the left and slightly behind, they are forced to kneel before the Pope. While the Pope rises above the second group and dominates it, the first group is dominated by a soldier whose colour and splendid headdress acts like a visual stepping stone to the Pope. At the edges of this group two stooping figures mirror each other, creating a tension in which one pushes away from the edge of the painting and the other pulls upward at its centre.

==Major works==

===Altarpieces===
Through the Renaissance period, the large [[altarpiece]] had a unique status as a commission.  An altarpiece was destined to become a focal point, not only visually in the religious building it occupied, but also in the devotions of the worshippers. [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''Madonna of the Rocks'', now in the [[National Gallery, London]] but previously in a chapel in [[Milan]], is one of many images that was used in the petitioning of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] against plague. The significance of these images to those who commissioned them, who worshipped in their location, and who created them is lost when they are viewed in an art gallery.

* The two ''Enthroned Madonnas'' by [[Cimabue]] and [[Duccio di Buoninsegna]] demonstrate the variations on a theme that was formalised and constrained by tradition. Although the positions of the Madonna and Child are very similar, the artists have treated most of the features differently. Cimabue's throne is front-on and uses perspective to suggest its solidity. The angels, their faces, wings and haloes, are arranged to form a rich pattern. The gold leaf detailing of the Madonna's garment picks out the folds in a delicate network. The Child sits regally, with his feet set at the same angle as his mother's.
* In Duccio's ''[[Rucellai Madonna]]'', the largest of its kind at 4.5 metres high, the throne is set diagonally and the Child, much more of a baby despite his gesture, sits diagonally opposed to his mother. While the positioning of the kneeling angels is quite simplistic, they have a naturalism in their repeated postures and are varied by the beautiful colour combinations of their robes. On the Madonna's robe the gold border makes a meandering line, defining the form and contours, and enlivening the whole composition with a single decorative detail.
* [[Giotto]]'s ''[[Ognissanti Madonna]]'' is now housed in the same room of the [[Uffizi]] as Cimabue's and Duccio's, where the advances that he made in both drawing from the observation of nature, and in his use of perspective can be easily compared with the earlier masters. While the painting conforms to the model of an altarpiece, the figures within it do not follow the traditional formula. The Madonna and Child are solidly three-dimensional. This quality is enhanced by the canopied throne which contributes the main decorative element, while gold borders are minimised. The angels, which mirror each other, each have quite individual drapery.
* A hundred years later, [[Masaccio]], still within the constraints of the formal altarpiece, confidently creates a three-dimensional figure draped in heavy robes, her chubby Christ Child sucking on his fingers. The lutes played by the little angels are both steeply foreshortened.
* In [[Fra Angelico]]'s painting the figures lack the emphasis on mass of Masaccio's. Angelico was renowned for his delicacy in depicting the Madonna. The appeal of such paintings is demonstrated in the way the adoring angels are clustered around. As in Masaccio's painting, the Madonna's halo is decorated with [[pseudo-kufic]] script, probably to suggest her [[Middle Eastern]] origin.
* In the hands of [[Piero della Francesca]] the formal gold frame is transformed into a classical niche, drawn in perfect linear perspective and defined by daylight. The assorted saints cluster round in a natural way, while the Madonna sits on a realistic throne on a small podium covered by an [[Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting|oriental carpet]], while the donor [[Federico da Montefeltro]] kneels at her feet. A concession to tradition is that the Madonna is of a larger scale than the other figures.
* In [[Giovanni Bellini|Bellini]]'s painting, while on one hand, the figures and the setting give the effect of great realism, Bellini's interest in Byzantine icons is displayed in the hierarchical enthronement and demeanour of the Madonna.
* The [[Milan]]ese painter [[Bergognone]] has drawn on aspects of the work of [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] and Bellini to create this painting in which the red robe and golden hair of Catherine of Alexandria are effectively balanced by the contrasting black and white of Catherine of Siena, and framed by a rustic arch of broken bricks.
* In [[Andrea Mantegna]]'s ''[[Madonna della Vittoria]]'', the Madonna may occupy the central position, framed in her garlanded gazebo, but the focus of attention is [[Francesco II Gonzaga]] whose achievements are acknowledged not only by the Madonna and Christ Child but by the heroic saints, Michael and George.
* [[Leonardo da Vinci]] abandoned any sort of formal canopy and surrounded the Madonna and Child with the grandeur of nature into which he set the figures in a carefully balanced yet seemingly informal trapezoid composition.
* The ''[[Sistine Madonna]]'' by [[Raphael]] uses the formula not of an altarpiece but the formal portrait, with a frame of green curtains through which a vision can be seen, witnessed by [[Pope Sixtus II]] for whom the work is named. The clouds around the Virgin are composed of cherubic faces, while the two iconic cherubs so beloved with the late 20th century fashion for angels, prop themselves on the sill. This work became the model for [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]] and many other painters.
* [[Andrea del Sarto]], while using figures to a very natural and lifelike effect, abandons in the ''Madonna of the Harpies'' practical reality by setting the Madonna on a Classical plinth as if she were a statue. Every figure is in a state of instability, marked by the forward thrust of the Madonna's knee against which she balances a book. This painting is showing the trends that were to be developed in [[Mannerism|Mannerist painting]].

===Fresco cycles===
The largest, most time-consuming paid work that an artist could do was a scheme of [[fresco]]es for a church, private palace or commune building. Of these, the largest unified scheme in Italy which remains more-or-less intact is that created by a number of different artists at the end of the Medieval period at the [[Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi]]. It was followed by [[Giotto]]'s Proto-Renaissance scheme at Padua and many others ranging from [[Benozzo Gozzoli]]'s [[Magi Chapel]] for the [[Medici]] to [[Michelangelo]]'s supreme accomplishment for [[Pope Julius II]] at the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling|Sistine Chapel]]. 
* [[Giotto]] painted the large, free-standing [[Scrovegni Chapel]] in [[Padua]] with the '' [[Life of the Virgin]]'' and the ''[[Life of Christ]]''. Breaking from medieval tradition, it set a standard of naturalism.
* The two large frescoes of ''Allegories of Good and Bad Government'' painted by [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]] for the Commune of Siena are completely secular and show detailed views of a townscape with citizens, emphasising the importance of civic order.
* By contrast, [[Andrea di Bonaiuto]], painting for the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]s at the new church of [[Santa Maria Novella]], completed a huge fresco of ''the Triumph of the Church'', which shows the role of the church in the work of [[Salvation]], and in particular, the role of the Dominicans, who also appear symbolically as ''the Hounds of Heaven'', shepherding the people of God. The painting includes a view of [[Florence Cathedral]].
* [[Masaccio]] and [[Masolino]] collaborated on the [[Brancacci Chapel]] fresco cycle which is most famous for Masaccio's lifelike innovations, Masolino's more elegant style is seen in this townscape which skillfully combines two episodes of ''the Life of St. Peter''.
* [[Piero della Francesca]]'s fresco cycle in the church of [[San Francesco, Arezzo]], closely follows the Legend of the True Cross as written by [[Jacopo da Varagine]] in the '' [[Golden Legend]]''. The pictures reveal his studies of light and perspective, and the figures have an almost monolithic solidity.
* [[Benozzo Gozzoli]]'s [[Magi Chapel|fresco cycle for the private chapel]] of the [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi|Medici Palace]] is a late work in the [[International Gothic]] style, a fanciful and richly ornamental depiction of the Medici with their entourage as the [[Three Wise Men]].
* The elaborate cycle for the [[House of Este]]'s [[Palazzo Schifanoia]] at Ferrara, executed in part by [[Francesco del Cossa]], was also fanciful in its depictions of Classical deities and Zodial signs which are combined with scenes of the life of the family.
* [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]'s paintings for the Gonzaga also show family life but have a preponderance of highly realistic elements and skillfully utilise the real architecture of the room they decorate, the mantelpiece forming a plinth for the figures and the real ceiling pendentives being apparently supported on painted pilasters.
* While in the Brancacci Chapel, historians seek to identify the faces of Masaccio, Masolino and perhaps Donatello among the apostles, [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] at the [[Sassetti Chapel]] makes no attempt to disguise his models. Each fresco in this religious cycle has two sets of figures: those who tell the story and those who are witness to it. In this scene of ''the Birth of the Virgin Mary'', a number of the noble women of Florence have come in, as if to congratulate the new mother.
* ''[[The Punishment of the Sons of Korah]]'' by [[Botticelli]] is one of episodes the ''Life of Moses'' series, which, together with ''The Life of Christ'', was commissioned in the 1480s as decoration to the [[Sistine Chapel]]. The artists [[Perugino]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] and [[Cosimo Rosselli]] all worked on the carefully designed and harmonious scheme.
* [[Michelangelo]]'s painting of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, which he executed alone over a period of five years, with narratives from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], prophetic figures and the Ancestors of Christ, was destined to become one of the most famous artworks in the world.
* Simultaneously, [[Raphael]] and a number of his assistants painted the papal chambers known as ''[[Raphael Rooms]]''. In ''[[The School of Athens]]'' Raphael depicts famous people of his day, including Leonardo, Michelangelo, Bramante and himself, as philosophers of ancient Athens.

==Subjects==
Devotional images of the ''[[Madonna and Child]]'' were produced in very large numbers, often for private clients. Scenes of ''the Life of Christ'', the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'',  or ''Lives of the Saints'' were also made in large numbers for churches, particularly scenes associated with the ''[[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity]]'' and ''the Passion of Christ''. ''The Last Supper'' was commonly depicted in religious refectories.

During the Renaissance an increasing number of patrons had their likeness committed to posterity in paint. For this reason there exists a great number of Renaissance portraits for whom the name of the sitter is unknown. Wealthy private patrons commissioned artworks as decoration for their homes, of increasingly secular subject matter.

===Devotional paintings===

====The Madonna====
These small intimate pictures, which are now nearly all in museums, were most often done for private ownership, but might occasionally grace a small altar in a chapel.

* ''The Madonna adoring the Christ Child with two Angels'' has always been particularly popular on account of the expressive little boy angel supporting the Christ Child. Paintings of [[Filippo Lippi]]'s such as this were to particularly influence [[Botticelli]].
* [[Verrocchio]] separates the Madonna and Christ Child from the viewer by a stone sill, also used in many portraits. The rose and the cherries represent spiritual love and sacrificial love.
* [[Antonello da Messina]]'s ''Madonna and Child'' is superficially very like that of Verrocchio, but it is much less formal and both the mother and the child appear to be moving rather than posing for the painter. The foreshortened elbow of the Child as he reaches for his mother's breast occurs in Raphael's work and can be seen in a different form in Michelangelo's ''Doni Tondo''.
* The figures placed at opposing diagonals seen in this early ''Madonna and Child'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] was a compositional theme that was to recur in many of his works and be imitated by his pupils and by Raphael.
* [[Giovanni Bellini]] was influenced by [[Greek Orthodox]] [[icon]]s. The gold cloth in this painting takes the place of the gold leaf background. The arrangement is formal, yet the gestures, and in particular the mother's adoring gaze, give a human warmth to this picture.
* [[Vittore Carpaccio]]'s ''Madonna and Child'' is very unusual in showing the Christ Child as a toddler fully dressed in contemporary clothing. The meticulous detail and domesticity are suggestive of [[Early Netherlandish painting]].
* [[Michelangelo]]'s Doni Tondo is the largest of these works, but was a private commission. The highly unusual composition, the contorted form of the Madonna, the three heads all near the top of the painting and the radical foreshortening were all very challenging features, and Agnolo Doni was not sure that he wished to pay for it.
* [[Raphael]] has skillfully set opposing forces into play, and united the Madonna and Child with a loving gaze.

===Secular paintings===

====Portraits====
During the latter half of the 15th century, there was a proliferation of portraits. Although the subjects of some of them were later remembered for their achievements or their noble lineage, the identities of many have been lost and that of even the most famous portrait of all time, [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', is open to speculation and controversy.

* The advantage of a profile portrait such as [[Piero della Francesca]]'s ''[[Portrait of Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta]]'' is that it identifies the subject like a facial signature. The proportions of the face, the respective angles of the forehead, nose and brow, the position and shape of the eye and the set of the jaw remain recognisable through life. Moreover, once a profile likeness has been taken, it can be used to cast a medal or sculpt an image in relief.
* [[Pollaiuolo]] has conformed to the formula, emphasising this young woman's profile with a fine line which also defines the delicate shape of her nostrils and the corners of her mouth. But he has added a three-dimensional quality by the subtle use of [[chiaroscuro]] and the treatment of the rich Florentine brocade of her sleeve.
* [[Alesso Baldovinetti]], on the other hand, has used the profile of this strong-featured girl to create a striking pattern of a highlighted contour against the darker background. The background is a lively shape adding to the compositional structure of the painting. The little black fillet on her forehead responds to the dynamic pattern of the embroidered sleeve.
* [[Botticelli]]'s portrait, although turned to three-quarter view with strong tonal modelling, has much to do with Baldovinetti's painting in its striking arrangement of shapes in the red garment, the hat and the dark hair and the pattern that they form against the background.
* [[Antonello da Messina]]'s portrait, some years earlier than Botticelli's, bears it a passing similarity. But this painting does not rely heavily on the skilful arrangement of clearly contoured shapes. Antonello has used the advantages of oil paint, as against Botticelli's [[tempera]], to achieve a subtle and detailed likeness in which the bushy eyebrows, the imperfections of the skin and the shadow of the beard have been rendered with photographic precision.
* [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]]'s tempera portrait of [[An Old Man and his Grandson|an old man with his grandson]] combines the meticulous depiction of the old man's enlarged nose and parchment-like skin with a tenderness usually reserved for portrayals of ''The Madonna and Child''. Ghirlandaio takes this analogy further by setting the scene against a window and landscape.
* [[Pintoricchio]]'s portrait of a boy sets him high in the picture frame, reducing his scale in proportion to the area in contrast to the usual way of showing adults. The painting is set against a landscape such as used by Leonardo and Bellini. Pinturicchio's main fame lay in his skillfully characterised portraits like this.
* In the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' Leonardo employed the technique of ''sfumato'', delicately graded chiaroscuro that models the surface contours, while allowing details to disappear in the shadows. The technique gives an air of mystery to this painting which has brought it lasting fame. The beautiful hands become almost a decorative element.
* [[Giovanni Bellini]]'s portrait of the elected Duke of Venice has an official air and could hardly be more formal. Yet the face is characterised with what one might hope for in the Doge, wisdom, humour and decisiveness. Although a more elaborate painting, it has much in common with Baldovinetti's sense of design.
* The subject of [[Titian]]'s portrait is unknown, and its considerable fame rests solely on its beauty and unusual composition in which the face is supported and balanced by the large blue sleeve of quilted satin. The sleeve is almost the same colour as the background; its rich tonality gives it form. The white linen of the shirt enlivens the composition, while the man's eyes pick up the colour of the sleeve with penetrating luminosity.
* Superficially, [[Andrea del Sarto]]'s portrait has many of the same elements as Titian's. But it is handled very differently, being much broader in treatment, and less compelling in subject. The painting has achieved an imediacy, as if the sitter has paused for a moment and is about to return to what he is doing.
* [[Raphael]], in this much-copied portrait of [[Pope Julius II]], set a standard for the painting of future popes. Unlike the contemporary portraits here by Bellini, Titian and del Sarto, Raphael has abandoned the placement of the figure behind a shelf or barrier and has shown the Pope as if seated in his own apartment. Against the green cloth decorated with the keys of [[St. Peter]], the red velvet papal garments make a rich contrast, the white beard being offset by the pleated white linen. On the uprights of the chair, the acorn finials are the symbol of the Pope's family, the ''[[della Rovere]]''.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====The nude====
These four famous paintings demonstrate the advent and acceptance of the nude as a subject for the artist in its own right. 
* In [[Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|Birth of Venus]]'', the nude figure, although central to the painting, is not of itself the subject. The subject of the painting is a story from [[Classical mythology]]. The fact that the Goddess Venus rose naked from the sea provides justification for the nude study that dominates the centre of the work.
* Painted thirty years later, the exact meaning of [[Giovanni Bellini]]'s picture is unclear. Had the subject been painted by an [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] painter, it would be quite unnecessary to ascribe a meaning. But in this Renaissance work, there is the presence of a mirror, an object that is usually symbolic and which suggests an allegory. The young lady's nakedness is a sign not so much of seduction, as innocence and vulnerability. However, she decks herself out in an extremely rich headdress, stitched with pearls, and having not one, but two mirrors, sees only herself reflected endlessly. The mirror, often a symbol of prophecy, here becomes an object of vanity, with the young woman in the role of [[narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]].
* [[Giorgione]]'s painting possibly predates Bellini's by ten years. It has always been known as ''[[Sleeping Venus (Giorgione)|The Sleeping Venus]]'' but there is nothing in the painting to confirm that it is, indeed, Venus. The painting is remarkable for its lack of symbolism and the emphasis on the body simply as an object of beauty. It is believed to have been completed by Titian.
* [[Titian]]'s ''[[Venus of Urbino]]'', on the other hand, was painted for the pleasure of the Duke of Urbino, and as in Botticelli's ''Birth of Venus'', painted for a member of the Medici family, the model looks directly at the viewer. The model may very well have been the mistress of the client. Venus of Urbino is not simply a body beautiful in its own right. She is an individual and highly seductive young woman, who is not in the nude state indicative of heavenly perfection, but is simply naked, having taken off her clothes but left on some of her jewellery.

File:Tizian 102.jpg|[[Titian]], ''[[Venus of Urbino]]'', 1530s.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Classical mythology====
Paintings of classical mythology were invariably done for the important salons in the houses of private patrons. Botticelli's most famous works are for the Medici, Raphael painted ''Galatea'' for Agostino Chigi and Bellini's ''[[Feast of the Gods (Bellini)|Feast of the Gods]]'' was, with several works by Titian, in the home of [[Alfonso I d'Este]]

* [[Pollaiuolo]]'s ''Hercules and the Hydra'' typifies many paintings of mythological subjects which lent themselves to interpretation that was both Humanist and Christian. In this work good overcomes evil, and courage is glorified. The figure of Hercules has resonances with the Biblical character of [[Samson]] who also was renowned for his strength and slew a lion.
* In [[Botticelli]]'s ''[[Pallas and the Centaur]]'', Wisdom,&lt;!---don't delete this capital---&gt; personified by Athena, leads the cowering Centaur by the forelock, so learning and refinement are able to overcome brute instinct, which is the characteristic symbolised by the centaur.
* [[Raphael]]'s ''[[Galatea (Raphael)|Galatea]]'', though Classical in origin, has a specifically Christian resonance that would have been recognised by those who were familiar with the story. It is about the nature of love. While all around her aspire to earthly love and succumb to the arrows shot by the trio of cupids, Galatea has chosen spiritual love and turns her eyes to Heaven.
* Three large works remain that were painted for a single room for the Este by [[Filippo Bellini|Bellini]] and his successor [[Titian]]. Of these, Titian's ''[[Bacchus and Ariadne]]'' represents a moment in a narrative. The other two paintings are jolly drinking scenes with a number of narrative elements introduced in a minor way, in order that characters might be identifiable. This painting does not appear to have any higher allegorical sentiment attached to it. It appears to be simply a very naturalistic portrayal of a number of the ancient gods and their associates, eating, drinking and enjoying the party.

'''''XMM-Newton''''', also known as the '''High Throughput X-ray Spectroscopy Mission''' and the '''X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission''', is an [[X-ray]] [[space observatory]] launched by the [[European Space Agency]] in December 1999 on an [[Ariane 5]] rocket. It is the second cornerstone mission of ESA's [[Horizon 2000]] programme. Named after physicist and astronomer Sir [[Isaac Newton]], the spacecraft is tasked with investigating interstellar X-ray sources, performing narrow- and broad-range [[spectroscopy]], and performing the first simultaneous imaging of objects in both X-ray and optical ([[visible spectrum|visible]] and [[ultraviolet]]) wavelengths.&lt;ref name="xmm-objectives"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/xmm-newton/31355-objectives/ |title=XMM-Newton: Objectives |publisher=European Space Agency |date=8 July 2011 |accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally scheduled for a two-year mission, the spacecraft remains in good health and has received repeated mission extensions, most recently for one year through 2016&lt;ref name="esa20141120"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/director-desk/54999-working-life-extensions-for-esas-science-missions/ |title=Working life extensions for ESA's science missions |publisher=European Space Agency |date=20 November 2014 |accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for two years through 2018.&lt;ref name="esa20161122"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/director-desk/58589-two-year-extensions-confirmed-for-esa-s-science-missions/ |title=Two-Year Extensions Confirmed for ESA's Science Missions |publisher=European Space Agency |first1=Martin |last1=Kessler |first2=Fabio |last2=Favata |first3=Markus |last3=Bauer |date=22 November 2016 |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESA plans to succeed ''XMM-Newton'' with the [[Advanced Telescope for High Energy Astrophysics]] (ATHENA), the second large mission in the [[Cosmic Vision]] 2015-2025 plan, to be launched in 2028.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Athena_to_study_the_hot_and_energetic_Universe |title=Athena to study the hot and energetic Universe |publisher=European Space Agency |first=Markus |last=Bauer |date=27 June 2014 |accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''XMM-Newton'' is similar to [[NASA]]'s [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]], also launched in 1999.

As of May 2018, close to 5,600 [[academic paper|papers]] have been published about either ''XMM-Newton'' or the scientific results it has returned.&lt;ref name="xmm-papers"&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://www.cosmos.esa.int/documents/332006/1713846/mission_status.pdf |title=XMM-Newton Overall Mission Status |conference=XMM-Newton Users' Group Meeting #19. 17-18 May 2018.

== Concept and mission history ==
The observational scope of ''XMM-Newton'' includes the [[X-ray astronomy|detection of X-ray]] emissions from astronomical objects, detailed studies of star-forming regions, investigation of the formation and evolution of [[galaxy cluster]]s, the environment of [[supermassive black hole]]s and mapping of the mysterious [[dark matter]].&lt;ref name="bulletin141"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://esamultimedia.esa.int/multimedia/publications/ESA-Bulletin-141/pageflip.html |title=10 years of discovery: Commemorating XMM-Newton's first decade |journal=ESA Bulletin |first1=Norbert |last1=Schartel |first2=María |last2=Santos-Lleo |first3=Arvind |last3=Parmar |first4=Jean |last4=Clavel |issue=141 |pages=2–9 |date=February 2010 |issn=0376-4265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, even before the launch of ''XMM-Newton''{{'s}} predecessor ''[[EXOSAT]]'' in 1983, a proposal was generated for a "multi-mirror" X-ray telescope mission.&lt;ref name="xmm-overview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/XMM-Newton_overview |title=XMM-Newton overview |publisher=European Space Agency |date=4 June 2013 |accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jansen2001"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2001/01/aaxmm39.pdf |title=XMM-Newton observatory.

In June 1989, the mission's instruments had been selected and work began on spacecraft hardware.&lt;ref name="xmm-overview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Palombara2010"/&gt; A project team was formed in January 1993 and based at the [[European Space Research and Technology Centre]] (ESTEC) in [[Noordwijk]], [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="aeat2000"/&gt; Prime contractor Dornier Satellitensysteme (a subsidiary of the former [[DaimlerChrysler Aerospace]]) was chosen in October 1994 after the mission was approved into the implementation phase, with development and construction beginning in March 1996 and March 1997, respectively.&lt;ref name="aeat2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lumb2012"/&gt; The XMM Survey Science Centre was established at the [[University of Leicester]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="xmm-overview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SSC-Leicester"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xmmssc-www.star.le.ac.uk/ |title=XMM-Newton Survey Science Centre |publisher=[[University of Leicester]] |accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three flight mirror modules for the X-ray telescopes were delivered by Italian subcontractor Media Lario in December 1998,&lt;ref name="Lumb2012"/&gt; and spacecraft integration and testing was completed in September 1999.&lt;ref name="aeat2000"/&gt;

''XMM'' left the ESTEC integration facility on 9 September 1999, taken by road to [[Katwijk]] then by the barge ''Emeli'' to [[Rotterdam]]. On 12 September, the spacecraft left Rotterdam for [[French Guiana]] aboard [[Arianespace]]{{'s}} transport ship MN ''Toucan''.&lt;ref name="esa19990913"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sci.esa.int/xmm-newton/13050-black-beauty-sails-to-the-tropics/ |title='Black Beauty' sails to the tropics |publisher=European Space Agency |date=13 September 1999 |accessdate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Toucan'' docked at the French Guianese town of [[Kourou]] on 23 September, and was transported to [[Guiana Space Centre]]{{'s}} Ariane 5 Final Assembly Building for final launch preparation.&lt;ref name="esa19990927"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sci.esa.int/xmm-newton/13062-xmm-arrives-in-french-guiana/ |title=XMM arrives in French Guiana |publisher=European Space Agency |date=27 September 1999 |accessdate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Launch of ''XMM'' took place on 10 December 1999 at 14:32&amp;nbsp;UTC from the Guiana Space Centre.&lt;ref name="nssdc-orbit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftOrbit.do?id=1999-066A |title=XMM-Newton: Trajectory Details |work=National Space Science Data Center |publisher=NASA |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''XMM'' was lofted into space aboard an [[Ariane 5]]04 rocket, and placed into a highly elliptical, 40-degree orbit that had a [[apsis|perigee]] of {{convert|838|km|mi|abbr=on}} and an [[apsis|apogee]] of {{convert|112473|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Wilson2005"/&gt; Forty minutes after being released from the Ariane upper stage, telemetry confirmed to ground stations that the spacecraft's solar arrays had successfully deployed. Engineers waited an additional 22 hours before commanding the on-board propulsion systems to fire a total of five times, which, between 10–16 December, changed the orbit to {{convert|7365|xx|113774|km|mi|abbr=on}} with a 38.9-degree inclination. This resulted in the spacecraft making one complete [[orbit|revolution]] of the Earth approximately every 48 hours.&lt;ref name="Wilson2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="xmm-orbit-nav"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/xmm-newton/31349-orbit-navigation/ |title=XMM-Newton: Orbit/Navigation |publisher=European Space Agency |date=19 September 2011 |accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after launch, ''XMM'' began its [[Launch and Early Orbit phase]] of operations.&lt;ref name="xmm-operations"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/XMM-Newton_operations |title=XMM-Newton Operations |publisher=European Space Agency |accessdate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 and 18 December 1999, the X-ray modules and Optical Monitor doors were opened, respectively.&lt;ref name="esa-1999-54"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://sci.esa.int/xmm-newton/13167-pr-54-1999-xmm-flying-beautifully/ |title=PR 54-1999: XMM flying beautifully |publisher=European Space Agency |date=20 December 1999 |accessdate=3 February 2016 |id=PR 54-1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instrument activation started on 4 January 2000,&lt;ref name="Wilson2005"/&gt; and the Instrument Commissioning phase began on 16 January.&lt;ref name="heasarc-new"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xmm/xmmhp_whatsnew.html |title=XMM-Newton What's New |publisher=NASA |accessdate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Optical Monitor (OM) attained first light on 5 January, the two European Photon Imaging Camera (EPIC) [[Metal Oxide Semiconductor|MOS]]-[[charge-coupled device|CCDs]] followed on 16 January and the EPIC [[p–n junction|pn]]-CCD on 22 January, and the Reflection Grating Spectrometers (RGS) saw first light on 2 February.&lt;ref name="heasarc-new"/&gt; On 3 March, the Calibration and Performance Validation phase began,&lt;ref name="Wilson2005"/&gt; and routine science operations began on 1 June.&lt;ref name="heasarc-new"/&gt;

During a press conference on 9 February 2000, ESA presented the first images taken by ''XMM'' and announced that a new name had been chosen for the spacecraft. Whereas the program had formally been known as the High Throughput X-ray Spectroscopy Mission, the new name would reflect the nature of the program and the originator of the field of spectroscopy. Explaining the new name of ''XMM-Newton'', Roger Bonnet, ESA's former Director of Science, said, "We have chosen this name because Sir Isaac Newton was the man who invented spectroscopy and XMM is a spectroscopy mission." He noted that because Newton is synonymous with gravity and one of the goals of the satellite was to locate large numbers of black hole candidates, "there was no better choice than XMM-Newton for the name of this mission."&lt;ref name="xmm-fact-sheet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/xmm-newton/31250-fact-sheet/ |title=XMM-Newton: Fact Sheet |publisher=European Space Agency |date=21 December 2012 |accessdate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Including all construction, spacecraft launch, and two years of operation, the project was accomplished within a budget of {{€|689 million|link=yes}} (1999 conditions).&lt;ref name="aeat2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lumb2012"/&gt;

Because of the spacecraft's good health and the significant returns of data, ''XMM-Newton'' has received several mission extensions by ESA's Science Programme Committee. The first extension came during November 2003 and extended operations through March 2008.&lt;ref name="xmm-extend-2003"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xmm.esac.esa.int/external/xmm_news/news_list/xmm_news-2003-12-01.shtml |title=XMM-Newton-NEWS #36 |publisher=European Space Agency |date=1 December 2003 |accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second extension was approved in December 2005, extending work through March 2010.&lt;ref name="xmm-extend-2005"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/xmm-newton/38397-mission-extension-approved/ |title=XMM-Newton Mission Extension Approved |publisher=European Space Agency |date=6 December 2005 |accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third extension was passed in November 2007, which provided for operations through 2012. As part of the approval, it was noted that the satellite had enough on-board consumables (fuel, power and mechanical health) to theoretically continue operations past 2017.&lt;ref name="xmm-extend-2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/xmm-newton/41772-xmm-newton-mission-extension-approved/ |title=XMM-Newton Mission Extension Approved |publisher=European Space Agency |date=15 November 2007 |accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth extension in November 2010 approved operations through 2014.&lt;ref name="esa20101122"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Europe_maintains_its_presence_on_the_final_frontier |title=Europe maintains its presence on the final frontier |publisher=European Space Agency |date=22 November 2010 |accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fifth extension was approved in November 2014, continuing operations through 2018.&lt;ref name="esa20141120"/&gt;

{{anchor|Cooling}}The spacecraft has the ability to lower the operating temperature of both the EPIC and RGS cameras, a function that was included to counteract the deleterious effects of ionising [[radiation]] on the camera [[pixel]]s. In general, the instruments are cooled to reduce the amount of [[dark current (physics)|dark current]] within the devices. During the night of 3–4 November 2002, RGS-2 was cooled from its initial temperature of {{convert|-80|C|F|0}} down to {{convert|-113|C|F|0}}, and a few hours later to {{convert|-115|C|F|0}}. After analysing the results, it was determined the optimal temperature for both RGS units would be {{convert|-110|C|F|0}}, and during 13–14 November, both RGS-1 and RGS-2 were set to this level. During 6–7 November, the EPIC MOS-CCD detectors were cooled from their initial operating temperature of {{convert|-100|C|F|0}} to a new setting of {{convert|-120|C|F|0}}. After these adjustments, both the EPIC and RGS cameras showed dramatic improvements in quality.&lt;ref name="xmm-cam-cooling"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xmm.esac.esa.int/external/xmm_news/items/cooling02/index.shtml |title=First results from XMM-Newton RGS and EPIC MOS instruments cooling |publisher=European Space Agency |date=11 November 2002 |accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 October 2008, ''XMM-Newton'' suffered an unexpected communications failure, during which time there was no contact with the spacecraft. While some concern was expressed that the vehicle may have suffered a catastrophic event, photographs taken by amateur astronomers at the [[Starkenburg Observatory]] in Germany and at other locations worldwide showed that the spacecraft was intact and appeared on course. A weak signal was finally detected using a {{convert|35|m|ft|adj=on}} antenna in [[New Norcia, Western Australia]], and communication with ''XMM-Newton'' suggested that the spacecraft's Radio Frequency switch had failed. After troubleshooting a solution, ground controllers used [[NASA]]'s {{convert|34|m|ft|adj=on|abbr=on}} antenna at the [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex]] to send a command that changed the switch to its last working position. ESA stated in a press release that on 22 October, a ground station at the [[European Space Astronomy Centre]] (ESAC) made contact with the satellite, confirming the process had worked and that the satellite was back under control.&lt;ref name="aero20081023"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aero-news.net/index.cfm?do=main.textpost&amp;id=11b62d59-623b-49f2-b8c1-f815b24f9738 |title=ESA Receives An Orbital Call For Help |work=Aero-News.net |date=23 October 2008 |accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="esa20081022"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/xmm-newton/43591-re-establishing-contact-with-xmm-newton/ |title=Re-establishing contact with XMM-Newton |publisher=European Space Agency |date=22 October 2008 |accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="esa20081023"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/XMM-Newton_talks_again_loud_and_clear |title=XMM-Newton talks again loud and clear |publisher=European Space Agency |date=23 October 2008 |accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spacecraft ==
[[File:XMM-Newton.jpg|thumb|Mock-up of ''XMM-Newton'' at the ''[[Cité de l'espace]]'', [[Toulouse]].]]
''XMM-Newton'' is a {{convert|10.8|m|ft|0|adj=on}} long space telescope, and is {{convert|16.16|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide with solar arrays deployed. At launch it weighed {{convert|3764|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref name="Wilson2005"/&gt; The spacecraft has three degrees of stabilisation, which allow it to aim at a target with an accuracy of 0.25 to 1 [[minute of arc|arcseconds]]. This stabilisation is achieved through the use of the spacecraft's [[#AOCS|Attitude &amp; Orbit Control Subsystem]]. These systems also allow the spacecraft to point at different celestial targets, and can turn the craft at a maximum of 90 degrees per hour.&lt;ref name="xmm-overview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="xmm-fact-sheet" /&gt; The instruments on board ''XMM-Newton'' are three European Photon Imaging Cameras (EPIC), two Reflection Grating [[Spectrometer]]s (RGS), and an Optical Monitor.

The spacecraft is roughly cylindrical in shape, and has four major components. At the fore of the spacecraft is the ''Mirror Support Platform'', which supports the X-ray telescope assemblies and grating systems, the Optical Monitor, and two [[star tracker]]s. Surrounding this component is the ''Service Module'', which carries various spacecraft support systems: [[Bus (computing)|computer]] and [[electric bus]]ses, consumables (such as fuel and [[coolant]]), [[photovoltaic system|solar arrays]], the Telescope Sun Shield, and two [[S band|S-band]] antennas. Behind these units is the ''Telescope Tube'', a {{convert|6.8|m|ft|adj=on}} long, hollow [[carbon fibre]] structure which provides exact spacing between the mirrors and their detection equipment. This section also hosts [[outgassing]] equipment on its exterior, which helps remove any contaminants from the interior of the satellite. At the aft end of spacecraft is the ''Focal Plane Assembly'', which supports the Focal Plane Platform (carrying the cameras and spectrometers) and the data-handling, power distribution, and radiator assemblies.&lt;ref name="bulletin100"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://esamultimedia.esa.int/multimedia/publications/ESA-Bulletin-100/ |title=An Overview of the XMM Observatory System |journal=Bulletin |publisher=European Space Agency |first1=H. |last1=Barré |first2=H. |last2=Nye |first3=G. |last3=Janin |issue=100 |pages=15–20 |date=December 1999 |bibcode=1999ESABu.100...15B |issn=0376-4265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Instruments ==

=== European Photon Imaging Cameras{{anchor|EPIC}} ===
The three ''European Photon Imaging Cameras'' (EPIC) are the primary instruments aboard ''XMM-Newton''. The system is composed of two [[Metal Oxide Semiconductor|MOS]]-[[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] cameras and a single [[p–n junction|pn]]-CCD camera, with a total field of view of 30 [[minute of arc|arcminutes]] and an energy sensitivity range between {{nowrap|0.15 and 15 [[electronvolt|keV]]}} ({{nowrap|82.7 to 0.83 [[ångström]]s}}). Each camera contains a six-position [[optical filter|filter wheel]], with three types of X-ray-transparent filters, a fully open and a fully closed position; each also contains a radioactive source used for internal calibration. The cameras can be independently operated in a variety of modes, depending on the image sensitivity and speed needed, as well as the intensity of the target.&lt;ref name="xmm-instruments-epic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/xmm-newton/31281-instruments/?fbodylongid=774 |title=XMM-Newton: Instruments: European Photon Imaging Camera (EPIC) |publisher=European Space Agency |date=18 August 2015 |accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="xmm-manual-332"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xmm.esac.esa.int/external/xmm_user_support/documentation/uhb/epicmode.html |title=Science modes of the EPIC cameras |work=XMM-Newton Users' Handbook |publisher=European Space Agency |page=3.3.2 |id=Issue 2.13 |date=20 July 2015 |accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner2001"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2001/01/aaxmm47.pdf |title=The European Photon Imaging Camera on XMM-Newton: The MOS cameras |journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]] |first1=M.

The two MOS-CCD cameras are used to detect low-energy X-rays. Each camera is composed of seven [[silicon chip]]s (one in the centre and six circling it), with each chip containing a matrix of 600×600 [[pixel]]s, giving the camera a total resolution of about 2.5 [[megapixel]]s. As [[#Cooling|discussed above]], each camera has a large adjacent [[radiator]] which cools the instrument to an operating temperature of {{convert|-120|C|F|0}}. They were developed and built by the [[University of Leicester]] Space Research Centre and [[English Electric Valve Company|EEV Ltd]].&lt;ref name="xmm-cam-cooling" /&gt;&lt;ref name="xmm-instruments-epic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner2001" /&gt;

The pn-CCD camera is used to detect high-energy X-rays, and is composed of a single silicon chip with twelve individual embedded CCDs. Each CCD is 64×189 pixels, for a total capacity of 145,000 pixels. At the time of its construction, the pn-CCD camera on ''XMM-Newton'' was the largest such device ever made, with a sensitive area of {{convert|36|cm2|abbr=on}}. A radiator cools the camera to {{convert|-100|C|F|0}}. This system was made by the [[University of Tübingen|Astronomisches Institut Tübingen]], the [[Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics]], and PNSensor, all of Germany.&lt;ref name="xmm-instruments-epic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pnsensor"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pnsensor.de/Welcome/Detectors/pn-CCD/index.php |title=Detector Concept of pn-CCDs |website=PNSensor.de |date=2 July 2008 |accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Struder2001"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2001/01/aaxmm35.pdf |title=The European Photon Imaging Camera on XMM-Newton: The pn-CCD camera |journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]] |first1=L. |last1=Strüder |first2=U. |last2=Briel |first3=K. |last3=Dennerl |first4=R. |last4=Hartmann |first5=E. |last5=Kendziorra |display-authors=etal |volume=365 |issue=1 |pages=L18-L26 |date=January 2001 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20000066 |bibcode=2001A&amp;A...365L..18S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPIC system records three types of data about every X-ray that is detected by its CCD cameras. The time that the X-ray arrives allows scientists to develop [[light curve]]s, which projects the number of X-rays that arrive over time and shows changes in the brightness of the target. Where the X-ray hits the camera allows for a visible image to be developed of the target. The amount of energy carried by the X-ray can also be detected and helps scientists to determine the physical processes occurring at the target, such as its temperature, its chemical make-up, and what the environment is like between the target and the telescope.&lt;ref name="leicaster-epic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.src.le.ac.uk/projects/xmm/instrument/ |title=The EPIC-MOS instruments on-board XMM-Newton |work=University of Leicester |first=Darren |last=Baskill |date=14 September 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701101611/http://www.src.le.ac.uk/projects/xmm/instrument/ |archivedate=1 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reflection Grating Spectrometers{{anchor|RGS}} ===
The ''Reflection Grating Spectrometers'' (RGS) are a secondary system on the spacecraft and are composed of two Focal Plane Cameras and their associated Reflection Grating Arrays. This system is used to build [[X-ray spectroscopy|X-ray spectral data]] and can determine the [[chemical element|elements]] present in the target, as well as the temperature, quantity and other characteristics of those elements. The RGS system operates in the {{nowrap|2.5 to 0.35 keV}} ({{nowrap|5 to 35 ångström}}) range, which allows detection of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, neon, magnesium, silicon and iron.&lt;ref name="denHerder2001"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2001/01/aaxmm19.pdf |title=The Reflection Grating Spectrometer on board XMM-Newton |journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]] |first1=J.

The Focal Plane Cameras each consist of nine MOS-CCD devices mounted in a row and following a curve called a [[Rowland circle]]. Each CCD contains 384×1024 pixels, for a total resolution of more than 3.5 megapixels. The total width and length of the CCD array was dictated by the size of the RGS spectrum and the wavelength range, respectively. Each CCD array is surrounded by a relatively massive wall, providing heat conduction and [[radiation]] shielding. Two-stage radiators cool the cameras to an operating temperature of {{convert|-110|C|F|0}}. The camera systems were a joint effort between [[Netherlands Institute for Space Research|SRON]], the [[Paul Scherrer Institute]], and [[Mullard Space Science Laboratory|MSSL]], with EEV Ltd and Contraves Space providing hardware.&lt;ref name="xmm-cam-cooling" /&gt;&lt;ref name="denHerder2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brinkman1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="xmm-support-tech-rgs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xmm.esac.esa.int/external/xmm_user_support/documentation/technical/RGS/index.shtml |title=The Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) onboard XMM-Newton |publisher=European Space Agency |accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="xmm-instruments-rgs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/xmm-newton/31281-instruments/?fbodylongid=797 |title=XMM-Newton: Instruments: Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) |publisher=European Space Agency |date=18 August 2015 |accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reflection Grating Arrays are attached to two of the primary telescopes. They allow approximately 50% of the incoming X-rays to pass unperturbed to the EPIC system, while redirecting the other 50% onto the Focal Plane Cameras. Each RGA was designed to contain 182 identical gratings, though a fabrication error left one with only 181. Because the telescope mirrors have already focused the X-rays to converge at the focal point, each grating has the same angle of incidence, and as with the Focal Plane Cameras, each grating array conforms to a Rowland circle. This configuration minimises focal aberrations. Each {{convert|10|xx|20|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} grating is composed of {{convert|1|mm|abbr=on}} thick [[silicon carbide]] substrate covered with a {{convert|2000|Å|adj=on|lk=in}} [[gold]] film, and is supported by five [[beryllium]] stiffeners. The gratings contain a large number of grooves, which actually perform the X-ray deflection; each grating contains an average of 646 grooves per millimetre. The RGAs were built by [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name="denHerder2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brinkman1998" /&gt;

=== Optical Monitor{{anchor|OM}} ===
The ''Optical Monitor'' (OM) is a {{convert|30|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} [[Ritchey–Chrétien telescope|Ritchey–Chrétien]] optical/ultraviolet telescope designed to provide simultaneous observations alongside the spacecraft's X-ray instruments. The OM is sensitive between {{nowrap|170 and 650}} nanometres in a 17×17 arcminute square field of view co-aligned with the centre of the X-ray telescope's field of view. It has a [[focal length]] of {{convert|3.8|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and a [[focal ratio]] of ƒ/12.7.&lt;ref name="xmm-instruments-om"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/xmm-newton/31281-instruments/?fbodylongid=798 |title=XMM-Newton: Instruments: Optical Monitor (OM) |publisher=European Space Agency |date=18 August 2015 |accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mason2001"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2001/01/aaxmm33.pdf |title=The XMM-Newton optical/UV monitor telescope |journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]] |first1=K.

The instrument is composed of the Telescope Module, containing the optics, detectors, processing equipment, and power supply; and the Digital Electronics Module, containing the instrument control unit and data processing units. Incoming light is directed into one of two fully redundant detector systems. The light passes through an 11-position [[optical filter|filter wheel]] (one opaque to block light, six broad band filters, one white light filter, one magnifier, and two [[grism]]s), then through an intensifier which amplifies the light by one million times, then onto the CCD sensor. The CCD is 384×288 pixels in size, of which 256×256 pixels are used for observations; each pixel is further subsampled into 8×8 pixels, resulting in a final product that is 2048×2048 in size. The Optical Monitor was built by the [[Mullard Space Science Laboratory]] with contributions from organisations in the United States and Belgium.&lt;ref name="xmm-instruments-om"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mason2001"/&gt;

The cameras are accompanied by the ''EPIC Radiation Monitor System'' (ERMS), which measures the radiation environment surrounding the spacecraft; specifically, the ambient proton and electron flux. This provides warning of damaging radiation events to allow for automatic shut-down of the sensitive camera CCDs and associated electronics. The ERMS was built by the [[Centre d'Etude Spatiale des Rayonnements]] of France.&lt;ref name="aeat2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="xmm-instruments-epic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner2001" /&gt;

=== Visual Monitoring Cameras{{anchor|VMC}} ===
The ''Visual Monitoring Cameras'' (VMC) on the spacecraft were added to monitor the deployment of solar arrays and the sun shield, and have additionally provided images of the thrusters firing and outgassing of the Telescope Tube during early operations. Two VMCs were installed on the Focal Plane Assembly looking forward. The first is FUGA-15, a black and white camera with high [[dynamic range]] and 290×290 pixel resolution. The second is IRIS-1, a colour camera with a variable [[exposure time]] and 400×310 pixel resolution. Both cameras measure {{convert|6|xx|6|xx|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} and weight {{convert|430|g|abbr=on}}. They use [[active pixel sensor]]s, a technology that was new at the time of ''XMM-Newton''{{'s}} development. The cameras were developed by {{abbr|OIC–Delft|Optronic Instruments and Products–Delft Sensor Systems}} and [[IMEC]], both of Belgium.&lt;ref name="esa19991217"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Habinc2000"&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://microelectronics.esa.int/vhdl/doc/MonCam.pdf |title=In-flight Results Using Visual Monitoring Cameras |conference=Data Systems in Aerospace. 22–26 May 2000.

== Ground systems ==
''XMM-Newton'' mission control is located at the [[European Space Operations Centre]] (ESOC) in [[Darmstadt]], Germany. Two [[ground station]]s, located in [[Perth]] and [[Kourou]], are used to maintain continuous contact with the spacecraft through most of its orbit. Back-up ground stations are located in [[Villanueva de la Cañada|Villafranca del Castillo]], [[Santiago]], and [[Dongara]]. Because ''XMM-Newton'' contains no on-board data storage, science data is transmitted to these ground stations in real time.&lt;ref name="xmm-orbit-nav"/&gt;

Data is then forwarded to the [[European Space Astronomy Centre]]{{'s}} Science Operations Centre in Villafranca del Castillo, Spain, where pipeline processing has been performed since March 2012. Data is archived at the ESAC Science Data Centre,&lt;ref name="irac"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nxsa.esac.esa.int/nxsa-web/ |title=Welcome to the XMM-Newton Science Archive |publisher=European Space Agency |date=6 August 2018 |accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and distributed to mirror archives at the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] and the XMM-Newton Survey Science Centre (SSC) at the [[L'Institut de Recherche en Astrophysique et Planétologie]]. Prior to June 2013, the SSC was operated by the [[University of Leicester]], but operations were transferred due to a withdrawal of funding by the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="SSC-Leicester"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SSC-IRAP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xmmssc.irap.omp.eu/ |title=XMM-Newton Survey Science Centre |publisher=L'Institut de Recherche en Astrophysique et Planétologie |accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Observations and discoveries ==
The space observatory was used to discover the [[galaxy cluster]] [[XMMXCS 2215-1738]], 10 billion light years away from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressrelease/media/media558.html |title=Massive galaxy cluster found 10 billion light years away |publisher=University of Sussex |first=Jacqui |last=Bealing |date=7 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The object [[SCP 06F6]], discovered by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST) in February 2006, was observed by ''XMM-Newton'' in early August 2006 and appeared to show an X-ray glow around it&lt;ref name="nature20080919"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080919/full/news.2008.1122.html |title=How they wonder what you are |work=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |first=Geoff |last=Brumfiel |date=19 September 2008 |accessdate=12 February 2016 |doi=10.1038/news.2008.1122}}&lt;/ref&gt; two orders of magnitude more luminous than that of [[supernova]]e.&lt;ref name="Gansicke2009"&gt;{{cite journal |title=SCP 06F6: A Carbon-rich Extragalactic Transient at Redshift ''Z'' ≃ 0.14? |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Letters]] |first1=Boris T. |last1=Gänsicke |first2=Andrew J. |last2=Levan |first3=Thomas R. |last3=Marsh |first4=Peter J. |last4=Wheatley |volume=697 |issue=2 |pages=L129-L132 |date=June 2009 |doi=10.1088/0004-637X/697/2/L129 |bibcode=2009ApJ...697L.129G |arxiv=0809.2562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, a team from the [[University of Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], reported ''XMM-Newton'' seeing a flare that lasted four hours at a peak intensity of 10,000 times the normal rate, from an observation of [[Supergiant Fast X-ray Transient]] [[IGR J18410-0535]], where a [[blue supergiant]] star shed a plume of matter that was partly ingested by a smaller companion [[neutron star]] with accompanying X-ray emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Neutron_star_bites_off_more_than_it_can_chew |title=Neutron star bites off more than it can chew |publisher=European Space Agency |date=28 June 2011 |accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bozzo2011"&gt;{{cite journal |title=XMM-Newton observations of IGR J18410-0535: the ingestion of a clump by a supergiant fast X-ray transient |journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]] |first1=E. |last1=Bozzo |first2=A. |last2=Giunta |first3=G. |last3=Cusumano |first4=C. |last4=Ferrigno |first5=R. |last5=Walter |first6=S. |last6=Campana |first7=M. |last7=Falanga |first8=G. |last8=Israel |first9=L. |last9=Stella |display-authors=5 |volume=531 |at=A130 |date=July 2011 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201116726 |bibcode=2011A&amp;A...531A.130B |arxiv=1106.5125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013 it was announced that ''XMM-Newton'' along with [[NuSTAR]] have for the first time measured the spin rate of a [[supermassive black hole]], by observing the black hole at the core of galaxy [[NGC 1365]]. At the same time, it verified the model that explains the distortion of X-rays emitted from a black hole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2013/feb/HQ_13-063_NuSTAR_Black_Hole_Spin.html |title=NASA's NuSTAR Helps Solve Riddle of Black Hole Spin |publisher=NASA |first1=J.D. |last1=Harrington |first2=Whitney |last2=Clavin |date=27 February 2013 |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Risaliti2013"&gt;{{cite journal |title=A rapidly spinning supermassive black hole at the centre of NGC 1365 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |first1=G. |last1=Risaliti |first2=F.

In February 2014, separate analyses extracted from the spectrum of X-ray emissions observed by ''XMM-Newton'' a monochromatic signal around 3.5 keV.&lt;ref name="Bulbul2014"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Detection of an Unidentified Emission Line in the Stacked X-Ray Spectrum of Galaxy Clusters |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |first1=Esra |last1=Bulbul |first2=Maxim |last2=Markevitch |first3=Adam |last3=Foster |first4=Randall K. |last4=Smith |first5=Michael |last5=Loewenstein |first6=Scott W. |last6=Randall |display-authors=5 |volume=789 |issue=1 |at=13 |date=July 2014 |doi=10.1088/0004-637X/789/1/13 |bibcode=2014ApJ...789...13B |arxiv=1402.2301}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Unidentified Line in X-Ray Spectra of the Andromeda Galaxy and Perseus Galaxy Cluster |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |first1=Alexey |last1=Boyarsky |first2=Oleg |last2=Ruchayskiy |first3=Dmytro |last3=Iakubovskyi |first4=Jeroen |last4=Franse |volume=113 |issue=25 |at=251301 |date=December 2014 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.251301 |bibcode=2014PhRvL.113y1301B |arxiv=1402.4119 |pmid=25554871}}&lt;/ref&gt; This signal is coming from different [[galaxy cluster]]s, and several scenarios of [[dark matter]] can justify such a line.
