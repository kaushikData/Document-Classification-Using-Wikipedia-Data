'''Abdi Warsame Isaq''' (d. September 10, 2011 in [[London, England|London]], [[England]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://beeshadireed.blogspot.com/2011/09/marxuum-col-cabdi-warsame-isaaq.html "The Somali Clan's History: The Voice of the Commander: Marxuum Col. Abdi Warsame Isaq" (Monday September 19, 2011)] Retrieved 5-4-2018.&lt;/ref&gt;, or more famously known as '''Colonel Abdi Warsame Isaq''', ({{lang-so|Cabdi Warsame Isaaq}}, {{lang-ar|عبدي ورسمة اساق}} ) was the chairman of the Southern Somali National Movement (SSNM), a military faction during the [[Somalia]] war. It consisted mainly of [[Bimaal|Biimaal]], [[Surre (clan)|Surre]] and other southern Mahad Dir clans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1993/jan/25/somalia|title=Somalia (Hansard, 25 January 1993)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Abdi Warsame Isaq hailed from the [[Bimaal|Biimaal]] clan of the [[Dir (clan)|Dir]] clan family, more importantly from the [[Gaadsen]] branch of [[Bimaal|Biimaal]]. Formally allied with Aideed, the chairmain of the SSNM, Colonel Abdi Warsame in 1993 broke with General Aideed and took part of the SSNM with him when he aligned himself with Ali Mahdi.&lt;ref&gt;Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada&lt;nowiki/&gt;http://www.ecoi.net/local_link/194849/313478_de.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=9fAjtruUXjEC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;lpg=PA213&amp;dq=southern+Dir+supported+SNM&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RdgrhhYb0k&amp;sig=BO_hadX5yDj46iLiyGEG2zLYXQU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjTmeirmc7RAhVMKsAKHYwPCuMQ6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=southern%20Dir%20supported%20SNM&amp;f=false|title=Blood and Bone: The Call of Kinship in Somali Society|last=Lewis|first=I.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5052">[[File:Aggregated distribution of parasites on hosts.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|Parasites are distributed very unevenly among their hosts, most hosts having no parasites, and a few hosts having many. This [[skewness|skewed]] distribution makes sampling difficult and requires careful use of statistics.]]
An '''aggregated distribution''', commonly found among [[predator]]s and [[parasite]]s, is a highly uneven ([[skewness|skewed]]) [[statistical distribution]] pattern in which they collect or aggregate in regions, which may be widely separated, where their prey or [[host (biology)|host]]s are at high density. This distribution makes sampling difficult and invalidates commonly-used [[parametric statistics]]. A similar pattern is found among predators that search for their prey.&lt;ref name=HassellMay1974&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hassell |first1=M. P. |last2=May |first2=R. M. |title=Aggregation of Predators and Insect Parasites and its Effect on Stability |journal=Journal of Animal Ecology |date=June 1974 |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=567-594 |jstor=3384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In predators==

When predators need to search for their prey, they could search at random, as has been assumed in models such as those made by Lotka in 1925 and Volterra in 1928. This would imply that they scatter themselves evenly across the environment.&lt;ref name=HassellMay1974/&gt; However, prey may be concentrated at high densities in some areas and scarce elsewhere. The zoologists M. P. Hassell and R. M. May noted that predators and parasites, too, might aggregate themselves where prey was abundant, choosing some response curve: they observed for example that [[common redshank|redshank]]s (predatory birds) adopted a sigmoid (s-shaped) response to the density of ''[[Corophium]]'' ([[amphipod]]) prey per square metre of [[mudflat]]s. They noted, too, that several different behaviours of predators or parasites could cause them to aggregate selectively in areas where prey are at high density: they could be attracted by a volatile substance liberated by prey or the plants they are feeding on; they could choose to spend more time in areas where they have caught prey, as many predators appear to do; or, predators could follow an individual predator which had located prey, as is seen in feeding [[Sterna|terns]]. Aggregated distributions of predators where they tend to spend time in areas where prey are concentrated have the effect of stabilising prey populations; when the time to travel between such concentrated areas is high; and when the prey populations too are more highly clumped.&lt;ref name=HassellMay1974/&gt;

==In parasites==

Parasite aggregation with respect to hosts is, according to Robert Poulin "a defining feature of [[metazoa]]n parasite populations."&lt;ref name="Poulin2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Poulin | first=Robert | title=Explaining variability in parasite aggregation levels among host samples | journal=Parasitology | volume=140 | issue=04 | date=January 2013 | doi=10.1017/s0031182012002053 | pages=541–546}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main reason for this is probably either that some hosts are more exposed to parasites, or that they are more susceptible to them.&lt;ref name="Poulin2013"/&gt;
Aggregation is seen in directly transmitted parasites (those not using a [[vector (epidemiology)|vector]]) from many groups: ectoparasites like [[louse|lice]] and mites, marine parasites like [[copepod]]s and [[Cyamidae|cyamid]] [[amphipod]]s, and many kinds of nematode, fungi, protozoa, bacteria, and viruses. It is widespread, too, in trophically transmitted parasites of animals. The observed pattern is that most individual [[host (biology)|hosts]] are free or almost free of parasites, while a minority carry a large number of parasites.&lt;ref name=PoulinRandhawa2015&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Poulin |first1=Robert |author1link=Robert Poulin (zoologist) |last2=Randhawa |first2=Haseeb S. |title=Evolution of parasitism along convergent lines: from ecology to genomics |journal=Parasitology |date=February 2015 |volume=142 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=S6-S15 |doi=10.1017/S0031182013001674 |pmc=4413784 |pmid=24229807}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantitative ecology===
Aggregated distribution of parasites across their hosts poses considerable problems for students of parasite ecology, as it renders [[parametric statistics]] as commonly used by biologists invalid. [[Data transformation (statistics)#Logarithmic transformation|Log-transformation]] of data before the application of parametric test, or the use of [[non-parametric statistics]] is recommended by several authors, but this can give rise to further problems, so quantitative parasitology is based on more advanced biostatistical methods.&lt;ref name="pmid10780537"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rózsa, L.; Reiczigel, J.; Majoros, G. | title=Quantifying parasites in samples of hosts | journal=J. Parasitol. | volume=86 | issue=2 | pages=228–32 | year=2000 | pmid=10780537 | doi=10.1645/0022-3395(2000)086[0228:QPISOH]2.0.CO;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alastair Arthur Windsor, 2nd Duke of Connaught and Strathearn''' (9 August 1914 – 26 April 1943) was a member of the [[British Royal Family]]. He was the only child of [[Prince Arthur of Connaught]] and [[Princess Alexandra, 2nd Duchess of Fife]]. He was a great-grandson of [[Queen Victoria]] through his father and also her great-great-grandson through his mother.

In 1942, he became the second [[Duke of Connaught and Strathearn]] and Earl of Sussex when he inherited his grandfather's title. In 1943, at the age of 28, he died in Canada of exposure, after falling out of a window in a state of inebriation.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Early life==
[[File:Princess Arthur of Connaught with Alastair.jpg|left|thumbnail|150px|Portrait with his mother]] 
Alastair was born on 9 August 1914 at his parents' home at 54 Mount Street, [[Mayfair]], [[London]] (now the Brazilian Embassy). His father was [[Prince Arthur of Connaught]], the only son of [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn]], and [[Princess Louise Margaret of Prussia]]. His mother was [[Princess Alexandra, 2nd Duchess of Fife]], the eldest daughter of [[Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife]], and [[Louise, Princess Royal]]. Alastair was thus a great-grandchild of [[Queen Victoria]] through his father and great-great grandchild of her through his mother.

The Prince was baptised on 1 September 1914 at his parents' home&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Prince Alastair |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001565/19140905/039/0002 |newspaper=Beverley and East Riding Recorder |location=England |date=5 September 1914 |access-date=23 April 2018 |via=British Newspaper Archive |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and his godparents were [[King George V]] (his maternal great-uncle), [[King Alfonso XIII of Spain]] (for whom [[Horace Farquhar, 1st Earl Farquhar|Lord Farquhar]], a [[Lord in Waiting]] to King George, stood proxy), [[Queen Alexandra]] (his maternal great-grandmother), the [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Duke of Connaught]] (his grandfather, for whom Major Malcolm Murray stood proxy), [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll]] (his great aunt), and [[Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood|Princess Mary]] (his cousin).&lt;ref name="Yvonne"&gt;[http://users.uniserve.com/~canyon/christenings.htm#Christenings Yvonne's Royalty Home Page — Royal Christenings]&lt;/ref&gt;

==House of Windsor==
[[File:Braemar, Mar Lodge Estate, St Ninian's Chapel - wall stone 01.JPG|thumb|left|[[St Ninian's Chapel, Braemar]] - inscription commemorating the 2nd Duke of Connaught (1914–1943)]]
Prince Alastair was born shortly after the [[First World War]] broke out, prompting strong anti-German feelings in the [[United Kingdom]]. [[George V]] eventually responded to this by changing the name of the [[Royal House]] from the [[House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]] to the [[House of Windsor]] and relinquishing all German titles belonging to members of the family who were British subjects.
{{House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (UK)|albertgg}}
In [[letters patent]] dated 20 November 1917, George V undertook further restructuring of the royal styles and titles by restricting the titles of Prince or Princess and the style of [[Royal Highness]] to the children of the sovereign, the children of the sovereign's sons, and the eldest living son of the eldest son of the [[Prince of Wales]]. This excluded Alastair, who was a great-grandson of a former sovereign but was not the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales. It further stated that all titles of "the grandchildren of the sons of any such Sovereign in the direct male line (save only the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales) shall have the style and title enjoyed by the children of Dukes."&lt;ref&gt;At that point, the three-year-old became known as ''Alastair Arthur Windsor, Earl of Macduff''. Although second in line to the dukedom of Connaught and Strathearn and the earldom of Sussex at the time of his birth, as heir of his father who was the [[heir apparent]], he was also the heir apparent to his mother's dukedom of Fife. Therefore, he used his mother's secondary peerage as a [[courtesy title]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
[[File:Braemar, Mar Lodge Estate, St Ninian's Chapel - floor slab 05.jpg|thumb|Braemar, Mar Lodge Estate, St Ninian's Chapel - Grave of the 2nd Duke of Connaught (1914–1943)]]
Lord Macduff received his education at [[Bryanston School|Bryanston]] and at the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]]. On 31 January 1935, he received a commission as a second lieutenant in the [[Royal Scots Greys]] (2nd Dragoons), his father's regiment,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=34129 |date=1 February 1935 |page=772 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was based in [[Egypt]] from 1936.  In 1939, Lord Macduff was promoted to lieutenant on 14 July,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=34651 |date=4 August 1931 |page=5396 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was assigned to Ottawa as aide-de-camp to his kinsman [[Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone|The Earl of Athlone]], then [[Governor General of Canada]]; his own grandfather had held the same post during the First World War.

He succeeded his grandfather as Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, and [[Earl of Sussex]], in 1942.&lt;ref name=APJ1942&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Death of Duke of Connaught |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000578/19420117/008/0001|newspaper=Aberdeen Press and Journal |location=Scotland |date=17 January 1942 |access-date=23 April 2018 |via=British Newspaper Archive |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he died in 1943 at the age of 28 "on active service" in [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]], Canada, in unusual circumstances. The diaries of [[Alan Lascelles|Sir Alan Lascelles]], King George VI's private secretary, published in 2006, recorded that both the regiment and Athlone had rejected him as incompetent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lascelles|first1=Alan|last2=Hart-Davis|first2=Duff|authorlink1=Alan Lascelles|title=King's counsellor: abdication and war: the diaries of Sir Alan Lascelles|date=2006|publisher=[[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]]|page=39|quote=...the wretched young Duke of Connaught, whom his regiment (Greys) have had to get rid of, as he is wholly incompetent.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he fell out of a window when drunk and perished of [[hypothermia]] overnight.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} [[Theo Aronson]], in his biography of [[Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone]], simply stated that the Duke "was found dead on the floor of his room at [[Rideau Hall]] on the morning of 26 April 1943. He had died, apparently, from hypothermia."&lt;ref name="aronson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aronson|first1=Theo|title=Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone|date=1981|publisher=Cassell|location=London|isbn=978-0304307579|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marlene Eilers Koenig, who wrote about the Duke's mother in an article for ''Majesty'' magazine, noted that he was found lying "near an open window."&lt;ref name="koenig"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koenig|first1=Marlene Eilers|title=Royal Musings: Princess Arthur of Connaught|url=http://royalmusingsblogspotcom.blogspot.com/2010/11/princess-arthur-of-connaught.html|accessdate=17 April 2018|date=2010-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers at the time cited the cause of death as "natural causes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article11349086 |title=DEATH OF DUKE OF CONNAUGHT IN CANADA |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)]] |issue=30,162 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=28 April 1943 |accessdate=17 April 2018 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His ashes were interred at [[St Ninian's Chapel, Braemar]], Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2458752/windsor,-alastair-arthur-duff/ CWGC entry].&lt;/ref&gt;

*16 January 1942 – 26 April 1943: ''His Grace'' The Duke of Connaught and Strathearn&lt;ref name=APJ1942/&gt;

Until the age of three, he was styled as ''Prince Alastair of Connaught''. However, in 1917, he lost the title of a British prince and the style of ''Highness''. After that, he was known as the ''Earl of Macduff'', this being the [[Courtesy titles in the United Kingdom|courtesy title]] he had as heir to his mother's [[Duke of Fife|Dukedom of Fife]].

===Arms===
In 1942, on the inheritance of his grandfather's dukedom, he was granted arms, being, quarterly, first and fourth his grandfather's arms (being the royal arms, differenced with a three-point label argent, the first and third points bearing [[fleurs-de-lys]] azure, the second a cross gules), second and third that of [[Dukedom of Fife|Fife]], and [[Earl Fife|Duff]].

Upon his death, the Dukedom of Connaught and Strathearn and the Earldom of Sussex became extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Dukedoms Pass |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001861/19430508/006/0004 |newspaper=The Sphere |location=England |date=8 May 1943 |access-date=23 April 2018 |via=British Newspaper Archive |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; His first cousin, [[James Carnegie, 3rd Duke of Fife|James Carnegie]] (23 September 1929 – 22 June 2015), succeeded as 3rd [[Duke of Fife]] and Earl of Macduff upon Princess Alexandra's death on 26 February 1959.

==Place in the line of succession==
Alastair was born ninth in the line of succession, behind the six children of George V, his grandmother and his mother. When he died, he was 12th in the line of succession. His mother and he were the first two people in line behind the descendants of George V.

'''Alberto Azzo II''' (997 or July 10, 1009, [[Modena]] – August 20, 1097, Modena), [[Margrave of Milan]], and [[Liguria]], Count of [[Gavello]] and [[Padua]], [[Rovigo]], [[Lunigiana]], [[Monselice]], and [[Montagnana]], was a powerful nobleman in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. He is considered the founder of Casa d'Este ([[House of Este]]), having been head of the first family to be master of Este, a town of Padua.&lt;ref name=diplomata&gt;[http://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb00000451_00007.html?sortIndex=030%3A040%3A0006%3A010%3A02%3A00&amp;zoom=0.50#ES ''Henrici IV diplomata'', no. 289 (1077), p. 377]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Alberto Azzo II was the only son of [[Albert Azzo I, Margrave of Milan]] and [[Adela of Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;Thiele, ''Erzählende genealogische Stammtafeln'', table 152.&lt;/ref&gt; He inherited his father's offices around 1029, and continually increased his properties in northern Italy. Around 1073 he made a castle at [[Este (city)|Este]] his residence, from which the [[House of Este]] took its name. Before his building project, Este was little more than a village.

In the [[Investiture Controversy]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]], and [[Pope Gregory VII]], Azzo attempted to mediate,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/goToPage/bsb00000741.html?pageNo=290&amp;sortIndex=010%3A070%3A0038%3A010%3A00%3A00 Lampert of Hersfeld, ''Annales'', a.1077, 290.]&lt;/ref&gt; but later he joined the side of the pope. 

==First marriage==
Azzo II married [[Kunigunde of Altdorf|Kunigunde]] (also called Chuniza), the daughter of [[Welf II, Count of Swabia|Welf II]], Count of Altdorf, in 1035/6.&lt;ref&gt;Thiele, ''Erzählende genealogische Stammtafeln'', table 152; [http://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/goToPage/bsb00000875.html?pageNo=734&amp;sortIndex=010%3A050%3A0013%3A010%3A00%3A00#ES ''Genealogia Welforum'', p. 764].&lt;/ref&gt; Azzo's son with Chuniza, [[Welf I, Duke of Bavaria|Welf]], moved first to Carinthia and then to Bavaria, giving rise to one of the most important families in European history, the [[Welfs|Guelphs]]. 

==Second marriage==
Around 1050, Azzo married again, to Garsende, daughter of [[Herbert I, Count of Maine]], around 1050. In 1069–1070, he tried to acquire [[Maine (province of France)|Maine]] for his son [[Hugh V of Maine|Hugh]], because his wife, Garsende, was a co-heiress of the previous counts of Maine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k736761/f4.image.r=.langFR, ''Actus Pontificum Cenomannis in urbe degentium'', chap. XXXII, p.377.]&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh was declared count, but he could not prevail against Robert, the Duke of Normandy, who had been betrothed to the last heiress. Another son from this marriage, [[Fulk I of Milan]], made the first documented use of the title "Marquis d'Este."

==Issue==
[[File:Albert Azzo II tomb - Vangadizza Abbey - Badia Polesine.jpg|thumb|Albert Azzo II's tomb at [[Vangadizza Abbey]]]]
With his first wife, Chuniza, Azzo had one known child:
* [[Welf I, Duke of Bavaria|Welf]] (died November 6, 1101, [[Paphos]]) Duke of Bavaria from 1070 to 1077 and from 1096 to his death who was the first member of the [[House of Welf|Welf]] branch of the [[House of Este]].&lt;ref&gt;Baaken, 'Herzog Welf VI,' p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

With his second wife, Garsende, Azzo had two known sons:
* [[Fulco I, Margrave of Milan]] (died 1128), ancestor of the Italian branch of the House of Este&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5533336m/f297.image.r=Orderic%20Vital.langFR#ES Orderic Vitalis, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', VIII, cap. XI, col. 589].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hugh V, Count of Maine]] (died 1131), had no issue.

Some sources say he also married Vitalia Orseolo, daughter of [[Peter Orseolo]]. They had a daughter: Itta.

He had an extra-marital affair with, or perhaps married,&lt;ref&gt;Bresslau, ''Jahrbücher des deutschen Reiches'', p. 421.&lt;/ref&gt; Matilda, sister of William/Guglielmo, Bishop of Pavia (r.1069-1102/3), with whom he had a daughter named Adelasia, who married Guglielmo Adelardi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/NORTHERN%20ITALY%20900-1100.htm#AlbertoAzzoIIdied1097A: Foundation for Medieval Genealogy: nobiltà del Nord Italia - ALBERTO Azzo (II)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Alberto Azzo II was extremely long-lived. He lived to at least his mid-80s and was perhaps one hundred years old when he died. He died in August 1097 at the monastery of [[Abbey of Vangadizza|Vangadizza]], near [[Legnago]], where he was buried.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/delleantichitaes01mura#page/316/mode/1up#ES L.A.

==Events==
[[File:Ann Lovett's resting place in Granard, Co. Longford.JPG|thumb|Ann Lovett's grave, Granardkill Graveyard.]]
Tuesday, 31 January 1984 was a cold, wet, winter's day in Granard, County Longford. That afternoon, the fifteen-year-old school girl left her [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Cnoc Mhuire Secondary School and made her way to a Grotto dedicated to the Virgin Mary at the top of her small hometown in the Irish midlands. It was here beneath the statue of Our Lady, that she gave birth, alone, to her infant son.

At around 4&amp;nbsp;pm that day some children on their way home from school saw Ann's schoolbag on the ground and discovered her lying in the Grotto.  They alerted a passing farmer who rushed to the nearby priest's house to inform him of the chilling discovery of Ann and her already deceased baby in the adjacent grotto. The priest's response to his request for help was;  "It's a doctor you need".&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|-LRvNDt4QII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ann, still alive but hemorrhaging heavily, was carried to the house of the Parish Priest from where a doctor was phoned. She was then driven in the doctor's car to her parents house in the centre of the town. By the point an ambulance arrived it was already too late.

Ann Lovett and her child were quietly buried three days later in Granardkill cemetery.

==Media reaction==
{{quote|A quarter of a century on from a tragedy that shocked the nation, many questions remain unanswered about the deaths of Ann Lovett and her infant child.|Ali Bracken|&lt;ref name="tribune-bracken"/&gt;}}

On Saturday night, 4 February 1984, Ireland's most popular television show was coming to an end, when the host read this headline from the next day's ''[[Sunday Tribune]]'' newspaper: "Girl, 15, Dies Giving Birth In A Field".

With the words "Nothing terribly exciting there", the newspaper was cast down on the studio floor by the ''[[The Late Late Show (Irish TV series)|Late Late Show]]'' host, [[Gay Byrne]].

This moment marked the first introduction the world had to the story of Ann Lovett and her newborn child.

A phonecall had been made to the Dublin newspaper by an anonymous caller from Granard and the story, broken in the ''Sunday Tribune'' by [[Emily O'Reilly]], drew the attention of the world to the tragic incident. The next day Granard was swamped with national and international media.

The story shocked the nation and left many asking how such a thing could happen. For others it was an opportunity to finally reveal similar stories that had remained hidden for decades. The Gay Byrne show on [[RTÉ Radio]] began to receive letters from all over the country – "Too many letters. They couldn't be ignored."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/the-ann-lovett-letters-sorrow-shame-anger-and-indignation-1.1673920|title=The Ann Lovett letters: sorrow, shame, anger and indignation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local reaction==
The local community and clergy, including the order of nuns at the school which Ann had attended remained tight lipped, apart from a terse statement, denying any knowledge of the teenager's pregnancy.

While the statement issued by the nuns, following legal advice, said they "did not know" about her pregnancy, they subsequently refused to confirm whether they had suspected it or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qZ6W1LiIyYYC&amp;pg=PA976&amp;lpg=PA976&amp;dq=The%20Field%20Day%20Anthology%20of%20Irish%20Writing:%20Politics%20and%20Sexuality&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Fy3jmNwr2D&amp;sig=mOHfgOv9qjB6TuRQ4KmmB-iR6qg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_WntUqi1Fa2U7Qb82oDoDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=ann%20lovett&amp;f=false|title=The Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing|first=Angela|last=Bourke|date=1 January 2002|publisher=NYU Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rumours also abounded about the identity of the child's father and the difficult family circumstances in which Ann herself was reared.&lt;ref&gt;"The Changing Face of Catholic Ireland: Conservatism and Liberalism in the Ann Lovett and Kerry Babies Scandal" by Moira Maguire in ''Feminist Studies, College Park'', Summer 2001, Vol 27, Issue 2 pg 335).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many residents of Granard, accused the media of being overly intrusive and of wrongly attaching blame to the community for the tragedy.

In [[National Archives of Ireland]] documents released in December 2014, a letter was revealed written by the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh]] to poet Christopher Daybell which claimed Lovett's "sad death reflects more on her immaturity than on any lack of Christian charity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gartland|first1=Fiona|title=Church said Ann Lovett's death was due to her 'immaturity'|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/state-papers/church-said-ann-lovett-s-death-was-due-to-her-immaturity-1.2041461|accessdate=27 December 2014|work=Irish Times|date=27 December 2014|ref=irishtimesdec2714}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An inquest was held in [[Mullingar]] a few weeks later and found that Ann's death was due to irreversible shock caused by haemorrhage and exposure during childbirth.&lt;ref name="tribune-bracken"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tribune.ie/news/article/2009/feb/01/vale-of-tears-veil-of-silence/ |title=Vale of tears, veil of silence |last=Bracken |first=Ali |newspaper=Sunday Tribune |date=1 February 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111024956/http://www.tribune.ie/news/article/2009/feb/01/vale-of-tears-veil-of-silence |archivedate=11 November 2010 |accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inquest also confirmed that, contrary to claims emanating from the local community, some people did indeed know about Ann's pregnancy before her death.

Subsequent enquiries by the Gardaí, the Department of Education and the Midlands Health Board have yet to be published leaving the tragic events of that day and the circumstances that forced a young girl to leave her classroom on a cold, wet winters day to give birth alone in a grotto, still shrouded in uncertainty.

==Aftermath==
Ann Lovett's death came just four months after the outcome of [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|a divisive abortion referendum]] in which a two-thirds majority voted to enshrine the right to life of the unborn in the constitution, creating confusion over where that left the rights of the mother.

In the ensuing public debate, the tragic events at Granard became symbolic of the emerging clash between church and state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://whistlinginthewind.org/2014/01/31/in-memory-of-ann-lovett/|title=In Memory Of Ann Lovett|date=31 January 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the run-up to the [[Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018 (Ireland)|2018 Irish abortion referendum]] the case was again remembered.  After publishing an extensive piece in March retracing the facts of the case,&lt;ref&gt;Rosita Boland, [https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/ann-lovett-death-of-a-strong-kick-ass-girl-1.3429792 Ann Lovett: Death of a ‘strong, kick-ass girl’], ''[[Irish Times]]'', 24 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt; on 5 May 2018 the ''[[Irish Times]]'' carried a detailed interview with Ricky McDonnell, Ann Lovett's former boyfriend, coming forward for the first time and discussing the circumstances of their lives and their relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Rosita Boland, [https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/i-was-ann-lovett-s-boyfriend-1.3484311 I was Ann Lovett’s boyfriend], ''[[Irish Times]]'', 5 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt; According to McDonnell, their close relationship had foundered when Lovett had found it difficult to continue, after she had come to him one night apparently having suffered a sexual assault. He did not know whether the child she had borne had been his, but he had lived with the tragic outcome for the rest of his life.

==Documentaries==
Twelve years after Ann's death, Lorelei Harris, a producer on the Gay Byrne programme, decided to make a radio documentary on the letters sent to the show in the immediate aftermath of the Granard tragedy.&lt;ref name="podcast-letter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/radio1/doconone/documentary-podcast-letter-ann-lovett-gay-byrne-granard-tribune.html|title=Letters to Ann|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She sought the opinions of local people on the pregnancy and death of Ann Lovett. Journalists and broadcasters also talked about their experiences at the time. Contributors to this documentary include Emily O'Reilly, Kevin O'Connor and people from Granard. The "Letters to Ann" were read by Aidan Matthews and John MacKenna, with Ann-Marie Horan reading from the original Gay Byrne show letters.&lt;ref name="podcast-letter"/&gt;

In 2004, TG4 produced a 30-minute documentary in their ''Scannal'' series about the tragedy.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

==Artistic response==
{{unsourced|section|date=August 2018}}
* In October 1987, [[Cry Before Dawn]] released a song titled "Girl in the Ghetto", which had been written as "Girl in the Grotto". It is a reflection on the Ann Lovett story.
* "Middle of the Island", by [[Christy Moore]], from his 1989 album ''Voyage'', is another song examining the society in which Ann Lovett lived and how she could have died in such circumstances. The song also appears in the Christy Moore Box Set under the title "Ann Lovett" and has also appeared on the ''[[Traveller (Christy Moore album)|Traveller]]'' album from 1999, where it was used to introduce "The Well Below The Valley", recorded live at [[Glastonbury]] festival. 
* In 2014, a song and video were released by Jj Kikola entitled "(They Were) Deaf To Her Child's Cries". The song is written in memory of Ann and her child, and was released two weeks before the 30th anniversary of the tragedy. Kikola, in a subsequent interview cited his inspiration for writing the song, as being the fact that the event has been largely unknown to the younger generation in Ireland.{{cn|date=August 2018}}
* The 2006 novel ''[[A Swift Pure Cry]]'' by Irish author [[Siobhan Dowd]] was partially inspired by Ann Lovett's death.
* The 2015 Poetry Competition "A Poem for Ireland" shortlisted the 1991 [[Paula Meehan]] poem "The Statue of the Virgin at Granard Speaks" which references the death of Ann Lovett.

Although Schmidt wrote [[poetry]], [[song]]s, [[book]]s, [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[Musical theatre|musicals]], and radio and television [[drama]] for adults, she is known best for [[children's books]]. Her best-known work for children may be the series ''[[Jip and Janneke]]''. Many of her books, such as ''[[Pluk van de Petteflet]]'', were illustrated by [[Fiep Westendorp]].

Schmidt received the 1988 [[Hans Christian Andersen Medal]] for her lasting contribution as a children's writer. The biennial award conferred by the [[International Board on Books for Young People]] is the highest recognition available to a writer or illustrator of children's books.&lt;ref name=andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=ibby-schmidt/&gt;

By the time she died in 1995 (of heart failure caused by [[euthanasia]]), she was an icon of the Dutch literary world, and even her death—peaceful, in the company of her friends and family—continues to be referenced in the Dutch media and played an important role in discussions of euthanasia.&lt;ref name=discussions-of-euthanasia/&gt;

== Early life ==
Anna Mannie Gannie "Annie" Schmidt was born on 20 May 1911 in [[Kapelle]], [[Zeeland]] in the Netherlands. She was the daughter of [[Dutch Reformed Church|Dutch Reformed]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] Johannes Daniel Schmidt (1871–1951) and school teacher Geertruida Maria Bouhuijs. She had an elder brother Wim and two older sisters also named Anna M.&amp;nbsp;G. who both died young and before she was born. She was called Zus ({{lang-en|Sis or Sister}}) by her family.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} Jeanne Roos, "[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_jaa003199601_01/_jaa003199601_01_0013.php Anna Maria Geertruida Schmidt]", ''Jaarboek van de Maatschappij der Nederlandse Letterkunde te Leiden, 1995-1996'', 1997.

Schmidt]", Vernoeming.nl, 2011. Retrieved on 2012-04-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

She was a  solitary child, who found an escape in writing poetry and fiction, even though she once received a grade of 2 (on a scale of 1 to 10) in Dutch class—she would later brag about the report card. Her mother encouraged her and sent some of her poetry to [[Willem Kloos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

After secondary school in [[Goes]] and working as an [[au pair]] in Germany, she began to study for a job as a librarian, an occupation she held until 1946.

==Career==
In 1947, she embarked upon her literary career while writing for the [[Amsterdam]] newspaper ''[[Het Parool]]'', and shortly after started writing songs and sketches for such luminaries as [[Wim Sonneveld]] and [[Wim Kan]].

Her literary career took off in the early 1950s, and included song- and playwriting for the theatre, scripts for radio and television shows, columns for newspapers, and children's books.

Her final book, ''Wat Ik Nog Weet'', a book of childhood memories, appeared in 1992. She used [[euthanasia]] a day after her 84th birthday&lt;ref name="janssen"&gt;{{cite news

She is included as one of the topics in the [[Canon of Dutch History]], which was prepared by a committee headed by [[Frits van Oostrom]] and presented to the Minister of Education, Culture and Science, [[Maria van der Hoeven]], in 2006; the Canon is a list of fifty topics that aims to provide a chronological summary of Dutch history to be taught in primary schools and the first two years of secondary school in the Netherlands. A revised version, which still includes her as one of the topics, was presented to the Dutch government on 3 October 2007.

[[File:Jip en Janneke Zaltbommel.png|thumb|left|180px|''[[Jip en Janneke]]'' in [[Zaltbommel]], Netherlands]]

Schmidt began writing ''[[Jip en Janneke]]'' while working in Amsterdam at ''Het Parool''. Jip and Janneke are two children who live next to each other, and engaged in short, self-contained adventures every week (apparently, some story lines were based on real adventures involving Schmidt's son Flip and the girl next door). The stories were illustrated by [[Fiep Westendorp]]. The first was published 13 September 1952, the last 7 September 1957; a total of eight book collections were published between 1953 and 1960. Jip and Janneke are among the best-known children's characters in the Netherlands—they were listed first on a list of "five typically Dutch phenomena"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Radio and television==
[[File:Ja zuster, nee zuster - Decorfoto 21.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Decor for ''Ja Zuster Nee Zuster'']]

In 1952 Schmidt began writing a radio show, the immensely popular ''De Familie Doorsnee'', which ran until 1958. In 1957 she began writing ''Pension Hommeles'', a [[musical comedy]] on [[Omroepvereniging VARA|VARA]] television.

===''Ja Zuster, Nee Zuster'' or ''Yes Nurse! No Nurse!''===
In the 1960s Schmidt wrote one of the most popular Dutch television series of all time, [[:simple:Ja zuster, nee zuster|''Ja zuster, nee zuster'']]&lt;ref name="trouw"/&gt; (English: ''Yes Nurse! No Nurse!''), later the inspiration for the 2002 film of [[Yes Nurse! No Nurse!|the same name]].

According to Rieks Swarte, who adapted her 1962 comic strip ''Tante Patent'' to a play (with music by Fay Lovski) in 2007, that story was the breeding ground for ''Ja Zuster, Nee Zuster.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12087">The '''April 27 demonstrations''' were massive student marches throughout major cities in [[China]] during the [[Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989]]. The students were protesting in response to the [[April 26 Editorial]] published by the ''[[People's Daily]]'' the previous day. The editorial asserted that the student movement was anti-party and contributed to a sense of chaos and destabilization.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang Liang, ''The Tiananmen Papers''. eds Perry Link and Andrew J. Nathan. New York: Public Affairs, 2001. p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; The content of the editorial incited the largest student protest of the movement thus far in Beijing: 50,000–200,000 students marched through the streets of Beijing before finally breaking through police lines into [[Tiananmen Square]].

==Events==
After the editorial was published, the students at [[Peking University]] in Beijing met during the night to discuss their plans for a march on April 27.&lt;ref&gt;Josephine T. Khu, "Student Organization in the Movement," ''Chinese Democracy and the Crisis of 1989: Chinese and American Reflections''. eds. Roger V. Des Forges, Luo Ning, Wu Yen-bo.Albany: State University of New York. p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig Calhoun, ''Neither Gods nor Emperors: Students and the Struggle for Democracy in China''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1994. p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the authorities in the school tried to coax the students into calling it off; they gave hints that if the students did not protest, then the school officials would use their government connections to begin dialogues.&lt;ref&gt;Li Lu, ''Moving the Mountain: My Life in China From the Cultural Revolution to Tiananmen Square''. London: Macmillan, 1990. p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Calhoun p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; But the students were too upset to stand down, and their enthusiasm to march could not be quelled. They compromised: they would only march part of the way, up to the [[3rd Ring Road (Beijing)|Third Ring Road]], but not all the way to Tiananmen Square itself. One scholar observed that the students thought it would show that they "rejected the April 26 editorial but would not constitute a major provocation," because the students were still scared of the government using retaliatory force.&lt;ref&gt;Calhoun p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

===Locations===
Although students had demonstrated before, the April 27 demonstrations were particularly significant, in part because their scale was the largest instance of defying the state since 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Schock, ''Unarmed Insurrections: People Power Movements in Nondemocracies''. Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press, 2005. p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; Students were protesting across China: "not only in cities where demonstrations had already taken place, such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Changchun, Xi'an, Wuhan, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Hefei, Changsha, Chengdu, and Chongqing, but also in cities where demonstrations now broke out for the first time: Shenyang, Dalian, Shijiazhuang, Nanning, Kunming, Shenzhen, Yinchuan, and Guilin." &lt;ref&gt;Zhang p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Beijing demonstration===
The Beijing demonstration was the largest, with one conservative estimate at 30,000 students marching, but most sources claim between 150,000-200,000 were present.&lt;ref&gt;Li p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult to ascertain the exact number of student protesters, however, because there were so many citizens from Beijing cheering them on and supporting them in solidarity.  This is another reason why this demonstration was significant. In the words of economist Chu-yuan Cheng, it was the first time that a "pro-democracy student protest campaign drew enthusiastic support from the masses."&lt;ref&gt;Chu-yuan Cheng. ''Behind the Tiananmen Massacre: Social, Political, and Economic Ferment in China''. Boulder: Westview Press, 1990.  p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; According to two Canadian journalists, the April 26 editorial had also "struck a raw nerve within the general populace" and the focus on themes like corruption and inflation stirred the people's sympathy.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Simmmie and Bob Nixon, ''Tiananmen Square''. Vancouver: Douglas &amp; MacIntyre, 1989. p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Many of students were carrying signs or banners, not advocating for overthrowing the CPC, which the April 26 editorial had accused them of, but rather focused on democracy and cracking down on corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Fang Deng, ''Unintended Outcomes of Social Movements: The 1989 Chinese Student movement''. London: Routledge, 2011. p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Chai Ling]], a student protester who would later become a leader of the Hunger Strike Group, the [[Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation]] had planned to stage a demonstration in the Square on April 27 even "before the government verdict appeared in the ''People's Daily''."&lt;ref&gt;Chai Ling, ''A Heart for Freedom: The Remarkable Journey of a Young Dissident, Her Daring Escape, and Her Quest to Free China's Daughters''. Tyndale House Publishers, 2011. p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interaction between students and the state===
Many officials were worried about the size and support of the demonstrations: [[Yang Shangkun]], with [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s permission, had five hundred troops of [[38th Army (People's Republic of China)|Beijing Military Region's Thirty-Eighth Army]] enter Beijing in case the demonstrations got out of hand.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; This was in addition to all the available Beijing police, which included students from the police academy.&lt;ref&gt;Zhou Dingxin, ''The Power of Tiananmen: State-Society Relations and the 1989 Beijing Student Movement''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2001. p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; But thousands of workers surrounded the soldiers and cut them off from the students; some of the workers even cleared aside police barricades to let the students march onward. The students, marching for fourteen hours, gained more support as they went on, and Canadian journalist Scott Simmie estimated that half a million citizens participated in the demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;Simmie, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the presence of police and military, there was little-to-no violence or altercations between them and the students.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Both sides were self-disciplined, and according to a few observing citizens, some of the students even shook officers' hands and chanted "the people's police love the people." &lt;ref&gt;Li p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;  The police did not resort to violence either; they temporarily slowed down the marchers before ultimately stepping aside and letting them pass.&lt;ref&gt;Fang, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;  There was also little-to-no vandalism or trouble from the students in general: one Chinese bystander remarked that "even the vagabonds and thieves were on their good behaviour this time. No one wanted to stir up trouble."&lt;ref&gt;Li p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; This only served to buoy the students' feelings of elation, and instead of abandoning the march at the Third Ring Road, as planned, their enthusiasm compelled them to continue all the way to [[Tiananmen Square]].&lt;ref&gt;Li p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
From the students' perspective, the April 27 demonstrations were a milestone in the student movement: they realized that they had the potential to make a difference.&lt;ref&gt;Khu p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time, the students were speaking for the people and workers; they did not focus solely on the interests of students and intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;Calhoun p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;  In one scholar's interpretation, the people were unable to protest and demonstrate, so the student demonstrations took on the "silent frustrations of the population."&lt;ref&gt;Frank Niming, "Learning How To Protest," ''The Chinese People's Movement: Perspectives on Spring 1989''. ed. Tony Saich. New York: M.E. Sharpe, Inc, 1990. P.90&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the first case of when the students faced official resistance, such as police lines and a military presence, whom they interacted with peacefully.  The government became more placatory and held dialogues with the students afterwards, which encouraged them to continue protesting.&lt;ref&gt;Schock, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; It served to revitalize the movement and inspired the students by showing that their actions had serious consequences. One [[big-character poster]] was put up on the next day at [[People's University]], explaining the attitude of the students in the aftermath: "those of us who went through the experience agree: the march was a great victory in the process of democratization in China."&lt;ref&gt;Calhoun p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; This was the immediate sensation of many of the students involved, but their elation was short-lived. The talks with the government would not go well, and the threat of violence would loom over the dialogues. Some observers even claim that these protests were not free from violence. A foreign medical student saw that "three or four students were brought into intensive care that evening, badly beaten, one allegedly with a broken back." &lt;ref&gt;Timothy Brook, ''Quelling The People: The Military Suppression of the Beijing Democracy Movement''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1992. p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;  After news of this, another student said that "'blood will be shed…'where this would happen, or how soon it might come, he could not say, but he felt that it was coming."&lt;ref&gt;Brook, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; While violence may not have been inevitable, the events after the April 27 demonstrations did not reflect the students' triumphant attitude at the time.

'''Ashraf Marwan''' ({{rtl-lang|ar|أشرف مروان}}&amp;lrm;, 2 February 1944 – 27 June 2007) was an Egyptian billionaire. Marwan spied for the Egyptian intelligence agency during the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]], feeding Egypt strategic information on the location of Israeli military assets

From 1969, Marwan served in the Presidential Office, first under Nasser and, then as a close aide to his successor, President [[Anwar Sadat]]. In 2002 it became known that, during the period leading up to the October 1973 Yom Kippur War, Marwan spied for Israel (under the Mossad code-name "The Angel"). However, some Egyptian sources claim he was a double agent working for the Egyptian intelligence, although this has never been confirmed. His warning on 5 October 1973 that "war will start tomorrow", triggered an emergency Israeli military mobilization and prevented both a complete surprise on 6 October and the complete occupation of the Golan Heights by the Syrian Army a day later.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Angel: The Egyptian Spy Who Saved Israel|last=Bar-Joseph|first=Uri|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2017|isbn=978-0-06-242010-7|location=New York|pages=227-232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marwan died under mysterious circumstances in June 2007, falling from the balcony of his expensive London house.

Maj. Gen. (ret.) [[Zvi Zamir]], the Mossad Chief who was one of Marwan's handlers, describes him as "the best source we have ever had".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=With Open Eyes |language=Hebrew |last=Zamir|first=Zvi|publisher=Kinneret-Zmora-Bitan|year=2011|isbn=978-965-552-134-4|location=Or Yehuda, Israel|pages=129–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simon Parkin, a British journalist who investigated the case, regards him as the "20th century's greatest spy".&lt;ref name=Parkin&gt;{{Cite news |last=Parkin |first=Simon |origyear=15 September 2015 |date=6 March 2018 |title=Who killed the 20th century’s greatest spy? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/15/who-killed-20th-centurys-greatest-spy-ashraf-marwan |work=The Guardian |location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others claim that Marwan was a "double-spy" who worked for Sadat and deceived the Israelis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Israel's Wars: A History of Israel Since 1947|last=Bregman|first=Ahron|publisher=Routledge|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=62–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent evidence has questioned this claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bar-Joseph|first=Uri|date=2014|title=A Question of Loyalty: Ashraf Marwan and Israel’s Intelligence Fiasco in the Yom Kippur War |url=|journal=Intelligence and National Security|volume=30|issue=|doi=10.1080/02684527.2014.887632|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Marwan was born in Egypt on 2 February 1944 to a respected family. His grandfather was the chief of the [[Sharia]] courts in Egypt, and his father, a military officer, reached the rank of General in the Egyptian Republican Guard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ashraf Marwan: Fact and Illusion|last=Thawrat|first=Muhammad|publisher=Madbuli|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, at the age of 21, Marwan graduated [[Cairo University]] with a degree in chemical engineering and was conscripted into the army. At the same year he met Mona Nasser, the president’s second daughter, who was 17 at the time. She fell in love with him, but her father suspected that Marwan’s interest in his daughter stemmed more from her political status than her personal charms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Opportunist: "The Bright Side of the Moon|last=|first=|publisher=Egyptian Chronicles, 28 June 2007|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, under her pressure, he agreed to the marriage, which took place in July 1966.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In 1968 Marwan started working in the Presidential Office under Sami Sharaf, Nasser’s aide-de-camp and the strong man of the Egyptian security service, who kept an eye on him. In late 1968 Marwan, Mona, and their new-born son, Gamal, left for London, allegedly for the continuation of Marwan’s studies. A few months later the young couple was ordered by Nasser, who was irritated by information concerning their lavish lifestyle, to return to Egypt, where Marwan continued working under Sami Sharaf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ashraf Marwan: The Dilemma Child|last=Halef al-Tawil|first=Kamal|publisher=Al-Akhbar al-Lebnaniya|date=7 February 2007|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Marwan's service at the Presidential Office lasted eight years (1968–1976). Although, under Nasser, he held only a junior position, the president used him sometimes for delicate missions such as calming the crisis that erupted following General [[Saad el-Shazly|Saad al Shazly’s]] resignation from the army when his rival was nominated as chief of staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=he Crossing of the Suez|last=el Shazly|first=Saad|publisher=San Francisco: American Mideast Research|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=184–185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Nasser's death in September 1970, Marwan became a close aide to President Sadat, who needed him by his side in order to demonstrate that he had the support of Nasser's family. In May 1971 Marwan played an important role in defeating an alleged coup attempt by Nasser's loyalists, including Sami Sharaf, against Sadat's rule. Following these events, known as the "[[Corrective Revolution (Egypt)|Corrective Revolution]]", Sharaf was arrested and Sadat nominated Marwan to replace him. Despite his official title, Marwan was actually Sadat's personal emissary, in charge of relations with Saudi Arabia and Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Angel: The Egyptian Spy Who Saved Israel|last=Bar-Joseph|first=Uri|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=76–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his new capacity, Marwan developed excellent relations with the Saudi and the Libyan leaderships. In Saudi Arabia he worked hand in hand with [[Kamal Adham]], King Feisal's brother-in-law, who established and supervised the Saudi security service. In Libya he was close to [[Muammar Gaddafi]], and his counterpart for many missions was the Libyan Prime Minister, [[Abdessalam Jalloud]]. Both Saudi Arabia and Libya provided Egypt with critical financial and military assistance before the Yom Kippur War. Libya delivered to Egypt [[Dassault Mirage 5|Mirage-5]] aircraft that were considered critical for the coming war and which, under the French embargo, could not be sold directly to Egypt. Marwan managed this Libyan-Egyptian deal as well as other highly sensitive issues.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Angel: The Egyptian Spy Who Saved Israel|last=Bar-Joseph |first=Uri |publisher=HarperCollins|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=34-43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secretary to the President of the Republic for Foreign Relations ===
After the 1973 war Marwan continued his way to the top. On 14 February 1974 he became Secretary to the President of the Republic for Foreign Relations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Al Ahram|last=|first=|date=15 February 1974|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a new position that reflected Sadat's ruling style. Given Sadat's dissatisfaction with the conduct of his Foreign Minister, [[Ismail Fahmi|Ismail Fahmy]], Marwan was considered as a candidate to replace him.

By this stage, however, he accumulated a considerable number of personal enemies, who accused him of using his position near Sadat to gain personal wealth. When these accusations gained momentum, Sadat had to yield to the pressure and in March 1976 he ended Marwan's service in the Presidential Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=I Knew Sadat: Half a Century of Secrets About Sadat and the [Muslim] Brotherhood|last=Jamaa|first=Mohamed|publisher=Cairo|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sadat: The Truth and the Legend|last=Sabri|first=Musa |location=Cairo |publisher=Al-Maktab al-Masry al-Hadeth|year=1985|isbn=|pages=651–662}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arab Organization for Industrialization ===
Marwan was nominated to head the [[Arab Organization for Industrialization]], an arms production complex in Cairo that was financed by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar. Following additional political pressures, Sadat had to relieve him from this position in October 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Al Ahram|last=|first=|date=13 October 1978|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Business ===
Following Sadat's assassination in October 1981, Marwan left Egypt and started a business career in London. He gained a reputation as a mysterious man who did not play according to the rules of the City. Among others he was involved in the failed attempt by [[Tiny Rowland]] to take over the [[House of Fraser]] – a group of department stores, whose jewel in the crown was Harrods, where the English aristocracy used to shop.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Marwan amassed significant wealth which has, to this day, never been disclosed. {{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Lead-up to Yom Kippur War ===
Egypt had begun preparing a war with the aim of retaking the Sinai Peninsula that it had lost to the Israelis in the 1967 [[Six-Day War|Six Day War]]. Marwan’s unparalleled access to his nation’s best-kept secrets, especially after his promotion in May 1971, allowed him to provide Israel with information about the coming war—including the full Egyptian war plans, detailed accounts of military exercises, original documentation of Egypt’s arm deals with the Soviet Union and other countries, the Egyptian military Order of Battle, the minutes from meetings of the high command, accounts of Sadat’s private conversations with other Arab leaders, and even the minutes of secret summit meetings in Moscow between Sadat and Soviet leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Angel: The Egyptian Spy Who Saved Israel|last=Bar-Joseph|first=Uri|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=100–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a senior Israeli intelligence officer had said, by providing these documents Marwan turned his country, Israel’s main enemy, into an open book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpW8MzbDdAA|title=CBS 60 Minutes|last=|first=|date=9 May 2009|work=The Perfect Spy|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The information Marwan provided made its way to the desks of Israeli Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]], Defense Minister [[Moshe Dayan]], and the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) chief of staff in raw form. It shaped Israel’s strategic and tactical approach to Egypt and allowed the Israelis a direct look at Egypt’s war calculus, including Sadat’s minimal requirements for launching a war. These were mainly long-range attack aircraft and Scud missiles, without which Egypt would not be able to overcome Israeli air superiority.

=== Yom Kippur War ===
In October 1973 Sadat decided to launch war without waiting for these arms and Egypt accelerated its war preparations. Marwan reported on Sadat's decision and the military preparations for war but personally he expressed the estimate that ultimately Egypt would be deterred from militarily challenging Israel. Nevertheless, in April he (as well as other Mossad sources), warned that Egypt planned to attack in mid-May. Israel raised its state-of military readiness, but war did not come, probably because [[Hafez al-Assad|President Assad]] of Syria convinced Sadat to delay it until Syria was better prepared to occupy the Golan Heights.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Assad: The Struggle for the Middle East|last=Seal|first=Patrick|publisher=University of California Press|year=1988|isbn=0-520-06976-5|location=Berkley|pages=192-193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known in Israel as "the Blue-White" alert, this episode eroded Israeli fear of an Arab attack. Consequently, by fall 1973, when Egypt and Syria geared to war, military intelligence leaders, including [[Eli Zeira]], refused to accept, despite numerous warnings and warning indicators, that the Arabs plan to attack. Accordingly, Israel’s leadership avoided the mobilization of the reserve army which in 1973 constituted 80% of the IDF ground forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Watchman Fell Asleep: The Surprise of Yom Kippur and its Sources|last=Bar-Joseph|first=Uri|publisher=Albany, NY: SUNY,|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=11–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Thursday, 4 October, about 44 hours before war launched, Marwan called Dubi, his Mossad handler in London, and asked to meet urgently the Mossad chief in order to talk about "a lot of chemicals" (code name for war). The meeting took place on Friday late at night in London and Marwan informed Zamir that "war would start tomorrow". As became evident recently, he did not know the exact D-Day when calling Dubi on Thursday and learned about it only after arriving in London on Friday morning. Because of this warning, Israel began mobilizing its forces on the morning of 6 October—hours before the attack was launched. Marwan's warning prevented a complete Egyptian surprise. Without it, the entire Golan Heights would have been lost, and the war likely would have ended with far greater Israeli losses of both territory and life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Angel: The Egyptian Spy Who Saved Israel|last=Bar-Joseph|first=Uri|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=194–232}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the war he met with Zamir once more in order to explain Sadat's warnings in a speech in the Egyptian Parliament, to launch missiles on Israel. The meeting took place in Paris on 18 October.

=== Post Yom Kippur War ===
On 28 October, a few days after the war ended and two days before Golda Meir started critical talks in the White House, Zamir conferred with "the Angel" once more to get information about Sadat's goals in the Egyptian-Israeli negotiations that were to start.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Marwan continued working for the Mossad until 1998 and was handled throughout this period by his single case officer, Dubi.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Angel: The Egyptian Spy Who Saved Israel|last=Bar-Joseph|first=Uri|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=239-242}}&lt;/ref&gt; His identity as a spy for Israel was revealed in December 2002, by the London-based Israeli historian [[Ahron Bregman]], who claimed that Marwan was a double-spy who deceived the Israelis. Bregman’s source was Maj. Gen. (ret.) Eli Zeira, the director of Israel’s Military Intelligence in the 1973 War and the main culprit in the intelligence fiasco prior to the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Intelligence Chief who Went Fishing in the Cold: How the Identity of Israel's Most Valuable Source in Egypt was Leaked by Maj.

== Personal life ==
Marwan married Mona Abdel Nasser in the 1960s. One of Marwan's sons was married to the daughter of former [[Arab League]] Secretary General [[Amr Moussa]]. His other son, Gamal, is the owner of the television group "Melody" and a close friend of Gamal Mubarak, the son of former Egyptian President [[Hosni Mubarak|Husni Mubarak]].

== Death ==
Marwan died on 27 June 2007 outside his flat in [[Carlton House Terrace]], London. The [[cause of death]] was [[traumatic aortic rupture]] following a fall from the balcony of his fifth-floor apartment. News reports indicate that the [[Metropolitan Police Service]] increasingly believe Marwan was murdered, a belief also held by Marwan's eldest son, Gamal. Marwan's funeral in Egypt was led by Egypt's highest-ranked religious leader, [[Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy]], and attended by, amongst others, [[Gamal Mubarak]], son of the former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, and intelligence chief [[Omar Suleiman]]. According to President Mubarak, "Marwan carried out patriotic acts which it is not yet time to reveal."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of the Egyptian Intelligence Service: A History of the Mukhabarat, 1910-2009|first=Owen L.|last=Sirrs|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2010|isbn=9780415569200|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_History_of_the_Egyptian_Intelligence_S.html?id=-yzCBmGHuzEC|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a case review in January 2008, the investigation was transferred to the Specialist Crime Directorate, both because of its public nature and because the shoes Marwan was wearing when he fell, key evidence in the case, had been lost.

One witness, who was on the third floor of a nearby building, told police that he saw two men "wearing suits and of Mediterranean appearance" appear on the balcony moments after Marwan's fall, look down, and then return inside the apartment. Police are also reported to have lost Marwan's shoes, which could hold clues on whether or not Marwan jumped from the balcony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K2FxDAAAQBAJ|title=Turnabout and Deception: Crafting the Double-Cross and the Theory of Outs|first=Barton|last=Whaley|publisher=[[Naval Institute Press]]|year=2016|isbn=9781682470299|pp=I94-I96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marwan is the fourth Egyptian of note to die in London in a similar manner.&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera-Goudsouzian"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/05/death-balcony-egypt-201452911215374449.html | title=Death by balcony in Egypt | work=[[Al Jazeera]] | date=1 June 2014 | accessdate=14 September 2017 | author=Goudsouzian, Tanya}}&lt;/ref&gt; The others, all of whom were involved in Egyptian politics between 1966 and 1971, are actress [[Suad Hosni]]; Egyptian ambassador to Greece Al-Leithy Nassif;&lt;ref name="Egyptian Chronicles"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://egyptianchronicles.blogspot.co.nz/2010/05/egyptian-x-file-stuart-tower-beginning.html | title=Egyptian X-File: Stuart Tower, The beginning | publisher=[[Blogspot]] | work=Egyptian Chronicles | date=21 May 2010 | accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ali Shafeek, secretary in the office of former Egyptian Vice President [[Abdel Hakim Amer]].&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera-Goudsouzian"/&gt;

At the time of the investigation, Marwan's wife said she believed that Mossad was behind his death. However, an analysis in ''[[The Guardian]]'' found this scenario to be unlikely: "For one thing, killing a former agent after his name is revealed would seem to be a major disincentive for new recruits. Even if Israel believed that Marwan was a double agent, working for the Egyptians, better to do nothing and, through their silence, imply he was faithful to their cause."&lt;ref name=Parkin/&gt; Further, Marwan was at least the third Egyptian living in London to die under similar circumstances, all of whom had ties with the Egyptian security services.&lt;ref name=Parkin/&gt;

Egyptian journalist [[Amr Ellissy]] conducted an investigation into Marwan's death for his documentary series ''Ekhterak'', broadcast on Egyptian television in six episodes on the first anniversary of Marwan's death. ''Ekhterak'' was filmed in Marwan's London apartment and included interviews with his son, a witness, and acquaintances of Marwan. Ellissy published his book ''The Agent Babel'' in Arabic through [[Dar Al Shorouq press]], and it was launched on 2 February 2009.

The British magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'' also followed the story closely and suggested that there was considerable cause for suspicion surrounding the circumstances of Marwan's death.

== Legacy ==
[[Ahron Bregman]], published in 2016 a book on his relationship with Ashraf Marwan, titled ''The Spy Who Fell to Earth''. In 2017, Salon Productions purchased the rights to turn the book into a feature documentary.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

Professor [[Uri Bar-Joseph]] wrote a book published in 2016 titled ''The Angel: The Egyptian Spy Who Saved Israel'', which was later used as the basis of a [[Netflix]] film, ''[[The Angel (2018 American film)|The Angel]]''. Bar-Joseph's book addresses whether Marwan was a genuine spy or a double agent. In a review of the book in the [[CIA]]'s ''[[Studies in Intelligence]]'', Thomas G. Coffey states that the book persuasively "argues that the nature of the intelligence Marwan gave the Israelis was simply too destructive of Egyptian interests" for Marwan to have been a double agent, and that it offers "a convincing defense" against the claim that the intelligence he provided was "late, flawed, and of little practical use."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol-60-no-4/the-angel.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1669">'''Autpert Ambrose (Ambroise)''' ({{lang-la|'''Ambrosius Autpertus'''}}) (ca. 730 – 784) was a [[Franks|Frankish]] [[Benedictine]] monk.

He became abbot of [[San Vincenzo al Volturno]] in South Italy in the time of [[Desiderius]], king of the [[Lombards]].  Autpert's election as [[abbot]] caused internal dissent at St. Vicenzo, and both [[Pope Stephen III]] and [[Charlemagne]] intervened.  The disagreement was based both on objections to Autpert's personality and to his Frankish origin.

He wrote a considerable number of works on the Bible and religious subjects generally. Among these are commentaries on the [[Apocalypse]], on the [[Psalms]], and on the [[Song of Solomon]]; ''Lives of Saints Paldo, Tuto and Vaso''; ''[[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]] of the Virgin''; and a ''Combat between the Virtues and the Vices''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Ambrose, Autpert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Pope [[Benedict XVI]] gave a homily about him in Saint Peter's square. In this homily, Autpert's death date is given as 784 (older scholarship had given a date between 778 and 779).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/article-25689?l=english On Ambrose Autpert, "1st Mariologist of the West"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427023703/http://www.zenit.org/article-25689?l=english |date=April 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Philippine mythology]], a '''Bal-Bal''' is an undead monster that steals corpses whether it is in a funeral or grave and feeds on them. It has a strong sense of smell for dead human bodies. It also has claws and teeth sharp enough to rip the clothing of the dead. Since it eats nothing but corpses, it has a foul breath. Once this monster has spotted and eaten the corpse, it will leave the trunk of a banana tree in the coffin creating an illusion of the stolen body to trick people.{{cn|date=February 2016}}

''Bal-Bal'' was also associated to ''[[Aswang]]'', ''[[Amalanhig]]'', and even to ''[[Busaw]]'', which were all flesh eaters. They were classified to one of the most fearful creatures in the [[Philippines]] because of their appearance. They were even described and compared to the [[vampire]] of the western continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =| first = | title = Amalanhig| url= http://ancientfiles.dumpshock.com/HMHVV.htm| accessdate = 2008-09-15 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080919073546/http://ancientfiles.dumpshock.com/HMHVV.htm| archivedate= 19 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; I

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14969">A '''binding neuron''' (BN) is an abstract mathematical model of the electrical activity of a neuron, closely related to well-known [[Biological neuron model#integrate-and-fire|integrate-and-fire]] model.  The BN model originated in a 1998 paper by A. K. Vidybida 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vidybida | first1 = A.K. | year = 1998 | title = Inhibition as binding controller at the single neuron level | url = | journal = BioSystems | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 263–267 | doi = 10.1016/S0303-2647(98)00073-2 | pmid = 9886656 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description of the concept ==

For a generic neuron the stimuli are excitatory impulses. Normally, more than single input impulse is necessary for exciting neuron up to the level when it fires and emits an output impulse.
Let the neuron receives &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; input impulses at consecutive moments of time &lt;math&gt;t_1,t_2,\dots,t_n&lt;/math&gt;. In the BN concept the temporal coherence &lt;math&gt;tc&lt;/math&gt; between input impulses is defined as follows

&lt;math&gt;tc = \frac{1}{t_n-t_1}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The high degree of temporal coherence between input impulses suggests that in external media all &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; 
impulses can be created by a single complex event. Correspondingly, if BN is stimulated by a highly coherent set of input impulses, it fires and emits an output impulse. In the BN terminology, BN binds the elementary events (input impulses) into a single event (output impulse). The binding happens if the input impulses are enough coherent in time, and does not happen if those impulses do not have required degree of coherence.

Inhibition in the BN concept (essentially, the slow somatic potassium inhibition) controls the degree of temporal coherence required for binding: the higher level of inhibition, the higher degree of temporal coherence is necessary for binding to occur.

[[File:Scheme Eng.svg|thumb|Scheme of signal processing in accordance with binding neuron concept. &lt;math&gt;t_1,t_2,\dots,t_n&lt;/math&gt; --- the moments of receiving of input impulses.]]

The emitted output impulse is treated as abstract representation of the compound event (the set of coherent in time input impulses), see Scheme.

== Origin ==
''"Although a neuron requires energy, its main function is to receive signals and to send them out that is, to handle information."'' --- this words by [[Francis Crick]] point at the necessity to describe neuronal functioning in terms of processing of abstract signals &lt;ref&gt;F. Crick. The Astonishing Hypothesis. Touchstone., 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The two abstract concepts, namely, the "coincidence detector" and "temporal integrator" are offered in this course,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abeles | first1 = M. | year = 1982 | title = Role of the cortical neuron: integrator or coincidence  detector? | url = | journal = Israel Journal of Medical Sciences | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 83–92 | pmid = 6279540 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = König | first1 = P. | last2 = Engel | first2 = A. K. | last3 = Singer | first3 = W. | year = 1996 | title = Integrator or coincidence detector? the role of the cortical neuron revisited | url = | journal = Trends in Neurosciences | volume = 19 | issue = 4| pages = 130–137 | doi = 10.1016/S0166-2236(96)80019-1 | pmid = 8658595 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first one expects that a neuron fires a spike if a number of input impulses are received at the same time. In the temporal integrator concept a neuron fires a spike after receiving a number of input impulses distributed in time.
Each of the two takes into account some features of real neurons since it is known that a realistic neuron can display
both coincidence detector and temporal integrator modes of activity depending on the stimulation applied,
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rudolph | first1 = M. | last2 = Destexhe | first2 = A. | year = 2003 | title = Tuning neocortical pyramidal neurons between integrators and coincidence detectors | url = | journal = Journal of Computational.Neuroscience | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 239–251 | doi = 10.1023/A:1023245625896 | pmid = 12766426 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the same time, it is known that a neuron together with excitatory impulses receives also inhibitory stimulation.
A natural development of the two above mentioned concepts could be a concept which endows inhibition with its own signal processing role.

In the neuroscience, there is an idea of [[binding problem]]. 
For example, during visual perception, such features as form, color and stereopsis are represented in the brain by 
different neuronal assemblies. The mechanism ensuring those features to be perceived as belonging to a single real object is called "feature binding",
.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Sougné. Binding problem. In Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
The experimentally approved opinion is that precise temporal coordination between neuronal impulses is required for the binding to occur,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Treisman | first1 = A. M. | last2 = Gelade | first2 = G. | year = 1980 | title = A feature-integration theory of attention | url = | journal = Cognitive Psychology | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 97–136 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0285(80)90005-5 | pmid = 7351125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This coordination mainly means that signals about different features must arrive to certain areas in the brain within a certain time window.

The BN concept reproduces at the level of single generic neuron the requirement, which is necessary for the feature binding to occur, and which was 
formulated earlier at the level of large-scale neuronal assemblies.
Its formulation is made possible by the analysis of response of the 
Hodgkin–Huxley model to stimuli similar to those the real neurons receive
in the natural conditions, see "Mathematical implementations", below.

== Mathematical implementations ==

=== Hodgkin–Huxley (H-H) model ===

[[Hodgkin–Huxley model]] — physiologically substantiated neuronal model, 
which operates in terms of
transmembrane ionic currents, and describes mechanism of generation of  [[action potential]].

In the paper
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vidybida | first1 = A. K. | year = 1996 | title = Neuron as time coherence discriminator | url = | journal = Biological Cybernetics | volume = 74 | issue = 6| pages = 537–542 | doi = 10.1007/BF00209424 | pmid = 8672560 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
the response of the H-H model was studied numerically to stimuli &lt;math&gt;U(t)&lt;/math&gt; composed of many
excitatory impulses distributed randomly within a time window &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;
U(t)=\sum_{k=1}^{NP} V(t-t_{k}),\qquad
t_{k} \in [0;W].
&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;V(t)&lt;/math&gt; denotes magnitude of 
[[excitatory postsynaptic potential]] at moment &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;; 
&lt;math&gt;t_k&lt;/math&gt; — is the moment of arrival of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-th impulse; &lt;math&gt;NP&lt;/math&gt; — is the total number of impulses the 
stimulus is composed of. The numbers &lt;math&gt;t_k&lt;/math&gt; are random, 
distributed uniformly within interval
&lt;math&gt;[0;W]&lt;/math&gt;. The stimulating current applied in the H-H equations 
is as follows

&lt;math&gt;
I(t)=-C_{M}\ \frac{d U(t)}{dt},
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;C_M&lt;/math&gt; — is the capacity of unit area of excitable membrane.
The probability to generate action potential was calculated as a function 
of the window width &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;.
Different constant potassium conductances were added to the H-H equations 
in order to create certain levels of 
inhibitory potential. The dependencies obtained, if recalculated as functions of &lt;math&gt;TC=\frac{1}{W}&lt;/math&gt;, 
which is analogous to temporal coherence of impulses in the compound stimulus, have step-like form.
The location of the step is controlled by the level of inhibition potential, 
see Fig. 1. 
Due to this type of dependence, the H-H equations can be treated as mathematical model of the BN concept.

[[File:Step Ukr.svg|thumb|Fig. 1. Firing probability (&lt;math&gt;fp&lt;/math&gt;) of Hodgkin–Huxley type neuron, 
stimulated with the set of &lt;math&gt;NP&lt;/math&gt; input impulses as a function of 
temporal coherence of the impulses. 
The curves from the left to the right correspond to increasing potassium 
conductance, that is to increasing degree of inhibition.]]

===Leaky integrate and fire neuron (LIF)===

[[Biological neuron model|Leaky integrate and fire neuron]] is a widely used  abstract neuronal model.
If to state a similar problem for the LIF neuron with appropriately chosen 
inhibition mechanism,
then it is possible to obtain step-like dependencies similar to the Fig. 1 
as well.
Therefore, the LIF neuron as well can be considered as mathematical model of the BN concept.

===Binding neuron model===

The binding neuron model implements the BN concept in the most refined form.
In this model each input impulse is stored in the neuron during fixed 
time &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; and then disappears.
This kind of memory serves as surrogate of the 
[[excitatory postsynaptic potential]].
The model has a threshold &lt;math&gt;N_{th}&lt;/math&gt;: if the number of stored in 
the BN impulses exceeds &lt;math&gt;N_{th}&lt;/math&gt;
then the neuron fires a spike and clears it internal memory. The presence of 
inhibition results in the decreased &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.

In the BN model, it is necessary to control the time to live of any stored 
impulse during calculation of the neuron's
response to input stimulation. This makes the BN model more complicated 
for numerical simulation than the LIF model.
On the other hand, any impulse spends finite time &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; 
in the BN model neuron. This is in contrast to the
LIF model, where traces of any impulse can be present infinitely long. 
This property of the BN model allows to
get precise description of output activity of BN stimulated with random 
stream of input impulses, see

The limiting case of BN with infinite memory, ''τ''→∞, corresponds to 
the temporal integrator.
The limiting case of BN with infinitely short memory, ''τ''→0, corresponds 
to the coincidence detector.

==Integrated circuit implementation==
The above-mentioned and other neuronal models and nets made of them can be implemented in microchips. Among different chips it is worth mentioning the [[field-programmable gate array]]s. These chips can be used for implementation of any neuronal model, but the BN model can be programmed most naturally because it can use only integers and do not need solving differential equations. Those features are used, e.g. in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosselló | first1 = J. L. | last2 = Canals | first2 = V. | last3 = Morro | first3 = A. | last4 = Oliver | first4 = A. | year = 2012 | title = Hardware implementation of stochastic spiking neural networks | url = | journal = International Journal of Neural Systems | volume = 22 | issue = 4| page = 1250014 | doi = 10.1142/S0129065712500141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = R. | last2 = Cohen | first2 = G. | last3 = Stiefel | first3 = K.

==Limitations==
As an abstract concept the BN model is subjected to necessary limitations. Among those are such as ignoring neuronal morphology, identical magnitude of input impulses, replacement of a set of transients with different relaxation times, known for a real neuron, with a single time to live, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, of impulse in neuron, the absence of refractoriness and fast (chlorine) inhibition. The BN model has the same limitations, yet some of them can be removed in a complicated model, see, e.g.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kravchuk | first1 = K. G. | last2 = Vidybida | first2 = A. K. | year = 2014 | title = Non-markovian spiking statistics of a neuron with delayed feedback in presence of refractoriness | doi = 10.3934/mbe.2014.11.81 | journal = Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 81–104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where the BN model is used with refractoriness and fast inhibition.

'''Bushwacker (Carl Burbank)''' is a [[fictional]] [[Character (arts)|character]], a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Primarily an enemy of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], he is also an enemy of the [[Punisher]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].

==Publication history==
{{expand-section|date=August 2016}}
Created by [[Ann Nocenti]] and [[Rick Leonardi]], the character made his first appearance in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #248 (November 1987).

==Fictional character biography==
Originally a [[priest]], Carl Burbank abandoned his vows following the drug-related deaths of young parishioners. He joined the [[C.I.A.]], which outfitted him with a cybernetic arm and made him an assassin under the codename "Bushwacker", but ultimately he became a freelancer.

At some point, an event took place that compelled Bushwacker to begin a war against all [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]]. Bushwacker began hunting and assassinating mutants, most often those mutants whose abilities Bushwacker perceived as making them especially talented in "the arts". Bushwacker also claimed that he was paid large sums of money to kill mutants, but this has yet to be verified. [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] learned of Bushwacker's activities and began to hunt the killer. At the same time, Bushwacker's wife Marilyn believed her husband was insane and needed to be placed in a hospital. She sought aid from lawyer Matt Murdock (secretly the hero Daredevil). Bushwacker was tracked down and defeated by the two heroes, which left the right side of his face horribly scarred, and he was placed in police custody.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' #249 (December 1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Bushwacker joined with [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid Mary]] and other enemies of Daredevil in a plan to kill their common foe. After the completion of the plan, Bushwacker was left to his own activities.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' #259-260 (October–November 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

Entering the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]'s employ, Burbank attacked the Punisher, but was left for dead. It was during this time that his wife finally left him.&lt;ref&gt;''The Punisher War Journal'' #12-13 (December 1989 – January 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; He reappeared in the employ of drug lord Nick Lambert, who hired Bushwacker to kill reporter [[Ben Urich]], who was about to run a story of his illegal activities. Instead, when Bushwacker learned the truth, he allowed Urich to live and to complete the exposé. However, the drug lord managed to bribe himself out of jail. Bushwacker then killed him.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil Annual'' #5 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Bushwacker was later freed by [[Deathlok#Michael Collins|Deathlok]] from captivity by [[Mecha Doom]].&lt;ref&gt;''Deathlok'' #5 (November 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent activities brought him into conflict with Daredevil, [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]], the Punisher, [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]], and [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]]. His clash with Nomad was over the life of a baby that Nomad had taken under his care whom Bushwacker believed to be the daughter of Troy Donohue, Burbank's ex-brother-in-law (she was in the fact the daughter of Nomad's foe, the drug lord Umberto Saffilios and a teenaged prostitute). Bushwacker hoped that his wife would approve of his "rescue" and welcome him back into her life.&lt;ref&gt;''Nomad'' #4-5 (August–September 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Imprisoned in the super-villain holding facility the Raft, Burbank escaped during the mass breakout engineered by [[Electro (comics)|Electro]]. Burbank was subsequently employed by the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]] to kill the Punisher, but was defeated once again by Daredevil.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil vs. Punisher'' #3 (October 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, Bushwacker created a disturbance in downtown Manhattan and took a woman hostage to lure the [[Punisher]] out of hiding and kill him. The Punisher showed up as expected. As it turns out, G.W. Bridge arranged the incident in Times Square with Bushwacker to ambush and capture The Punisher. Although complications arose by an on-site NYPD officer the incident fell through, the Punisher escaped, and Bushwacker was defeated by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] operative [[G. W. Bridge]] and put back in jail.&lt;ref&gt;''Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2, #5 (May 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] has hired him as part of his criminal organization to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act. He helped them fight the New Avengers but was taken down by Doctor Strange.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers Annual'' #2 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the Hood's gang, he later joins the fight against the Skrull invading force in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Invasion'' #6 (November 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; He was with the Hood when he presented the [[Mac Gargan#Scorpion|Scorpion costume]] to whichever crook impressed him until the party was crashed by [[Scorpion (Carmilla Black)|Scorpion]], who stole the costume.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #626 (May 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bushwacker was seen during the [[Siege (comics)|Siege]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] as part of the Hood crime syndicate.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' #63 (May 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[X-Force]]: Sex and Violence'' #2, Bushwacker was apparently killed by Wolverine after an assassination attempt on him and Domino. He was killed with a middle claw to the throat.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force: Sex and Violence'' #2 (October 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Civil War II]]'' storyline, Kingpin encounters Bushwacker in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;''Civil War II: Kingpin'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Bushwacker's right arm has been altered bionically so that it can function as a gun. He can fire bullets from his index finger as if his hand were a pistol. Using his left hand, he can alter the configuration of his right arm, allowing it to function in several modes that replicate the effects of a number of weapons, including a machine gun and a shotgun. He employs powerful gadgets and weapons, most notably a flamethrower, all of which can be created by the mechanical prostheses that have replaced his forearms. He manages to load the weapons by swallowing ammo, such as bullets or flamethrower fuel. Bushwacker's skin can liquefy to seal wounds. There are some versions that take this a step further, having Bushwacker be able to use highly concussive energy weaponry (very similar to that of Iron Man or War Machine), and even be able to morph his arm into blades as a last resort.

In the ''Daredevil vs. Punisher'' miniseries, it was implied that his powers are actually a natural mutation, making the assassin himself one of the mutants he hates so much.{{issue|date=May 2012}} However, this is contradicted by his other appearances which identify the origins of his powers as cybernetics.{{issue|date=May 2012}}

Bushwacker has been trained in CIA hand-to-hand combat techniques, and is trained in infiltration and assassination. He also has familiarity with the workings of international intelligence agencies and their methods.

==Other versions==
===House of M===
Bushwacker appeared in the [[House of M]] reality spin-off ''House of M: Masters of Evil''.&lt;ref&gt;''House of M: Masters of Evil'' #1-4 (October 2009 – January 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{short description|Christian church model}}
{{distinguish|Cafeteria Christianity}}
A '''cafe church''' is a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Church (building)|church]] centered in [[café]]s. These edifices are associated with [[alternative worship]] and the [[emerging church]] movements, and seek to find new forms and approaches to existing as a church in the 21st century. These churches are often focused on relationship aspects of Christian fellowship and outreach to their local community, and use the modern gathering place of a café in their ministry.

== Cafe Church philosophy and planting churches ==
The cafe church can be viewed as an organically based philosophy for [[Church planting|planting churches]], centered around the idea of making the message of Christ's love relevant to the needs of the local community that the church seeks to serve.

The ''Alma Mount Hope Coffeehouse Church'', of Alma, MI, says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The ministry statement for AMH Coffeehouse Church is found in Acts 2:42: 'And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, in the [[Eucharist|breaking of bread]], and in prayers.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The goal of cafe church endeavors is to impact their local community with a message of God's love and the transforming power of Christ's love.

Depending on the leadership, some cafe church leaders will provide a clear doctrinal perspective, while others may be more open-minded and comfortable with members and visitors asking questions of speakers.

For example, ''One World Coffeehouse'' in [[Owen Brown, Columbia, Maryland|Columbia, Maryland]] was founded by a church member who said, "I felt that our church needed an outreach effort ... and a way to express principles such as [[multiculturalism]] and acceptance of others different from yourself."&lt;ref name="baltimoresun" /&gt;

And the ''Glebe Café Church,'' in New South Wales, Australia states that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Café Church is a [[Glebe, New South Wales|Glebe-based]], non-traditional Christian faith community. We aim to provide an inclusive, accepting and welcoming space for everybody, no matter what their [[Spirituality|spiritual path]]. Café Church revolves around open discussion, [[creativity|creative expression]] and alternative approaches to worship. Our core values include [[hospitality]], creativity, [[Disciple (Christianity)|discipleship]] and [[Social justice|social]] and [[environmental justice]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Coffeehouse cafes vs. coffee as a Christian fellowship event ==
Churches using the cafe as a model for their organization can take different forms. Some cafe churches maintain a permanent cafe or [[restaurant]], which offers the local community a high-quality array of coffee,{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} sandwiches, and food, and provides a venue where the members of the church fellowship meet. Church members may also volunteer their time to support the enterprise.

Other churches simply use the cafe model as a way to [[Community building|build community]], facilitating variation within their normal service structure and within the confines of their building, by serving coffee after or during the service in a predesignated area, or holding a [[Coffeehouse (event)|coffeehouse event]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

== Churches which operate coffeehouses and cafes ==
''Ebenezer's Coffeehouse'', in Washington, DC, operated by the [[National Community Church]], is one example of a cafe church. Its website asks, "How much more comfortable can you get sipping a [[Masala chai|Chai]] in church?" This church is a [[multi-site church|multi-location]] church located at sites accessible by public transit, which links its indie music coffeehouse broadcasts to other locations via the [[Internet church|Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Also located in Washington is the ''Potters House,'' an outreach ministry of the [[Church of the Saviour (Washington, D.C.)|Church of the Savior]]. Its website states, "We, the members of that church, asked ourselves, '[[What would Jesus do?|Would Jesus want to hang out]] with folks at a traditional institutional church? or [[pub church|would he want to hang out over a beer]] in a bar or [[coffee]] in a restaurant?' The resounding answer was the latter. We chose coffee over beer because of our support for the budding [[Alcoholics Anonymous|AA movement]] in 1960."&lt;ref name="pottershouse"&gt;{{Cite web

== History of church-sponsored coffeehouses and American folk music ==
Church-sponsored [[coffeehouses]] have a long history in the United States. For example, [[Nameless Coffeehouse]] has operated for over 40 years (since 1966) on the site of The [[The First Parish in Cambridge|First Parish Unitarian Universalist Church]] in Cambridge, MA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Charles Clifford Ogle''' (January 21, 1923 &amp;ndash; [[circa|c.]] August 12, 1964?) was an American [[businessman]] and [[aviator]]. Charles Ogle was a businessman and developer in [[San Francisco]] and [[Oakland]], [[California]] at the time of his disappearance. He had worked as a loftsman for the [[Tampa Shipbuilding Company]] in [[Tampa, Florida]], before joining the U.S. Navy in 1943 during [[World War II]] where he received flight training in the CAA-WTS (Civil Aeronautics Administrative War Training Service). He also served on the [[USS John D. Ford (DD-228)|USS ''John D. Ford'']]. At the end of the war he worked as a securities salesman for the First California Company in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] until 1950 when he joined the United States Marine Corps at the beginning of the [[Korean War]]. Later becoming acting [[First Sergeant]], Headquarters Battery [[2nd Battalion, 11th Marines]] while serving in South and Central Korea. On separation from the Marine Corp he settled in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] where he was he was a developer and builder from 1954 till his disappearance in 1964

==Disappearance==
At 6 pm on August 12, 1964, Charles Ogle took off from [[Oakland International Airport]] in his [[Cessna 210]]A tail number N9492X. He did not file a flight plan and he did not radio the tower on takeoff. He was never seen or heard from again. It was originally reported that his planned flight destination was [[Reno, Nevada]]. A private investigator hired by his father later reported his actual destination was [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].

In 2007 with the disappearance of [[Steve Fossett]] and during the subsequent search approximately eight unidentified plane wrecks were discovered. It was speculated that one of these aircraft could be the Cessna 210A that Charles Ogle was flying, or one of several other aircraft that have disappeared flying over the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]. Only one aircraft was partially identified. With the rest there has been no follow up by the civil authorities. The fate of Charles Ogle remains a mystery.

'''Charles William Jones''' (December 24, 1834{{spaced ndash}}October 11, 1897) was a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Florida]]. He abandoned the seat after an apparent onset of mental illness.

==Early life, travel and career==
Jones was born in [[Balbriggan]], [[Ireland]]. His father was a British army surgeon who died when he was a child. In 1844, Jones and his mother immigrated to [[New York City]]. After attending school in New York City and [[St. Louis, Missouri]], Jones moved to [[Louisiana]] (in 1848) and [[Mississippi]] before settling in [[Santa Rosa County, Florida]] in 1854.

Jones was admitted to the [[Florida Bar]] in 1857, moved to [[Pensacola, Florida]] and was appointed [[tax]] [[assessor (property)|assessor]] for Santa Rosa and [[Escambia County, Florida|Escambia]] Counties. He married Mary Ada Quigley in 1861 and they had four children before her death in 1880.

==Politics==
[[File:CharlesWJones.jpg|frame|right|U.S. Senator Charles W. Jones (D-Florida)]]

In 1872, Jones decided to try his hand at [[politics]] as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] but was defeated by [[William Purman]] in a bid to become a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. representative]]. In 1874, Jones won a seat on the [[Florida House of Representatives]], winning by only five votes.

After gaining [[Independent (politician)|independent]] support, Jones made a second attempt at federal office and, this time, was successful.  He began his first Senate term in 1875 and was hailed as an early success and an example of resurgence for the Democratic party in the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] era. Although criticized for his speaking style, Jones was elected to a second term in 1881.

==Permanent vacation==
In the spring of 1885, Jones announced he was taking a vacation in [[Canada]] and [[Detroit, Michigan]]. When the Detroit vacation extended into early 1886, questions started to be asked and gossip ensued. The most popular story was that Jones was pursuing - or even stalking - a wealthy younger woman named Clothilde Palms and was refusing to leave Detroit without her.

By April 1886, the speculation was that Jones had become insane. Around that time, the Senate leadership started replacing him on various committees. Although that move drew vocal ire from Jones, he continued to live in Detroit. Florida newspapers were campaigning for Jones to be replaced but Florida's [[Governor]] [[Edward A. Perry]] refused to take any action, citing, among other things, the lack of concrete rules regarding a senator who would not work but had not been officially declared physically or mentally impaired. Instead, Jones' seat went unfilled until his term expired in March 1887.

==Later life and death==
After Jones' term – and salary – ended in 1887, his life quickly spiraled downward. By year's end, he had been evicted from his room in Detroit and reportedly became destitute. Doctors informed one of his sons that they would sign a certificate of insanity for legal purposes.

In spring of 1888, Jones had reportedly been reduced to common [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]]. In May 1890, Jones' son was granted permission to have him restrained and a probate court was told that he conclusively suffered from [[monomania]]. Shortly thereafter, Senator Jones was taken into custody and brought to an asylum for the insane in [[Dearborn, Michigan]] where he stayed until his death over seven years later.

Despite rampant gossip and speculation about both his mental state and Clothilde Palms, Jones himself never spoke publicly about either subject.  The cause of his sudden decline remains a mystery.

Clothilde Palms married a Detroit surgeon in 1889 shortly before Jones was committed.

Charles W. Jones is interred in Pensacola, Florida.

'''Connectionism''' is an approach in the fields of [[cognitive science]], that hopes to explain [[mind|mental]] phenomena using [[artificial neural networks]] (ANN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2018/entries/connectionism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=James|last=Garson|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=27 November 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Artificial_neural_network.svg|thumb|Connectionist (ANN) model with a hidden layer]]

==Basic principles==
The central connectionist principle is that mental phenomena can be described by interconnected networks of simple and often uniform units. The form of the connections and the units can vary from model to model. For example, units in the network could represent [[neurons]] and the connections could represent [[synapses]], as in the [[human brain]].

===Spreading activation===
{{Main|Spreading activation}}
In most connectionist models, networks change over time.  A closely related and very common aspect of connectionist models is ''activation''. At any time, a unit in the network has an activation, which is a numerical value intended to represent some aspect of the unit.  For example, if the units in the model are neurons, the activation could represent the [[probability]] that the neuron would generate an [[action potential]] spike. Activation typically spreads to all the other units connected to it.  Spreading activation is always a feature of neural network models, and it is very common in connectionist models used by [[cognitive psychology|cognitive psychologists]].

===Neural networks===
{{Main|Artificial neural networks}}
Neural networks are by far the most commonly used connectionist model today. Though there are a large variety of neural network models, they almost always follow two basic principles regarding the mind:

# Any mental state can be described as an (N)-dimensional [[Vector (mathematics)|vector]] of numeric activation values over neural units in a network.
# Memory is created by modifying the strength of the connections between neural units. The connection strengths, or "weights", are generally represented as an N×N [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]].

Most of the variety among neural network models comes from:
* ''Interpretation of units'': Units can be interpreted as neurons or groups of neurons.
* ''Definition of activation'': Activation can be defined in a variety of ways. For example, in a [[Boltzmann machine]], the activation is interpreted as the [[probability]] of generating an action potential spike, and is determined via a [[logistic function]] on the sum of the inputs to a unit.
* ''Learning algorithm'': Different networks modify their connections differently. In general, any mathematically defined change in connection weights over time is referred to as the "learning algorithm".

Connectionists are in agreement that [[recurrent neural networks]] (directed networks wherein connections of the network can form a directed cycle) are a better model of the brain than [[feedforward neural networks]] (directed networks with no cycles, called [[Directed acyclic graph|DAG]]). Many recurrent connectionist models also incorporate [[dynamical systems theory]]. Many researchers, such as the connectionist [[Paul Smolensky]], have argued that connectionist models will evolve toward fully [[Continuous function|continuous]], high-dimensional, [[non-linear]], [[dynamic systems]] approaches.

===Biological realism===
Connectionist work in general does not need to be biologically realistic and therefore suffers from a lack of neuroscientific plausibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encephalos.gr/48-1-01e.htm|title=Encephalos Journal|website=www.encephalos.gr|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s-OCCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT18&amp;lpg=PT18&amp;dq=%22accurate%22&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q=%22accurate%22&amp;f=false|title=Neural Geographies: Feminism and the Microstructure of Cognition|last=Wilson|first=Elizabeth A.|date=2016-02-04|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317958765|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e953/59bc80e624a963a3d8c943e3b2898a397ef7.pdf|title=Organismically-inspired robotics: homeostatic adaptation and teleology beyond the closed sensorimotor loop|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zorzi|first=Marco|last2=Testolin|first2=Alberto|last3=Stoianov|first3=Ivilin P.|date=2013-08-20|title=Modeling language and cognition with deep unsupervised learning: a tutorial overview|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00515|issn=1664-1078|pmc=3747356|pmid=23970869}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1015&amp;context=comparativephilosophy|title=ANALYTIC AND CONTINENTAL PHILOSOPHY|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uV9TZzOITMwC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=%22biological%20plausibility%22&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q=%22biological%20plausibility%22&amp;f=false|title=Neural Network Perspectives on Cognition and Adaptive Robotics|last=Browne|first=A.|date=1997-01-01|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780750304559|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7pPv0STSos8C&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=%22biological+realism%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22biological%20realism%22&amp;f=false|title=Connectionism in Perspective|last=Pfeifer|first=R.|last2=Schreter|first2=Z.|last3=Fogelman-Soulié|first3=F.|last4=Steels|first4=L.|date=1989-08-23|publisher=Elsevier|year=|isbn=9780444598769|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning===
The weights in a neural network are adjusted according to some [[learning rule]] or algorithm, such as [[Hebbian theory|Hebbian learning]]. Thus, connectionists have created many sophisticated learning procedures for neural networks. Learning always involves modifying the connection weights. In general, these involve mathematical formulas to determine the change in weights when given sets of data consisting of activation vectors for some subset of the neural units. Several studies have been focused on designing teaching-learning methods based on connectionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Novo|first=María-Luisa|last2=Alsina|first2=Ángel|last3=Marbán|first3=José-María|last4=Berciano|first4=Ainhoa|date=2017|title=Connective Intelligence for Childhood Mathematics Education|url=https://doi.org/10.3916/C52-2017-03|journal=Comunicar|language=es|volume=25|issue=52|pages=29–39|doi=10.3916/c52-2017-03|issn=1134-3478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By formalizing learning in such a way, connectionists have many tools. A very common strategy in connectionist learning methods is to incorporate [[gradient descent]] over an error surface in a space defined by the weight matrix. All gradient descent learning in connectionist models involves changing each weight by the [[partial derivative]] of the error surface with respect to the weight. [[Backpropagation]] (BP), first made popular in the 1980s, is probably the most commonly known connectionist gradient descent algorithm today.

==History==

Connectionism can be traced to ideas more than a century old, which were little more than speculation until the mid-to-late 20th century.

===Parallel distributed processing===

The prevailing connectionist approach today was originally known as '''parallel distributed processing''' (PDP). It was an [[artificial neural network]] approach that stressed the parallel nature of neural processing, and the distributed nature of neural representations.  It provided a general mathematical framework for researchers to operate in. The framework involved eight major aspects:

* A set of ''processing units'', represented by a [[set (computer science)|set]] of integers.
* An ''activation'' for each unit, represented by a vector of time-dependent [[Function (mathematics)|functions]].
* An ''output function'' for each unit, represented by a vector of functions on the activations.
* A ''pattern of connectivity'' among units, represented by a matrix of real numbers indicating connection strength.
* A ''propagation rule'' spreading the activations via the connections, represented by a function on the output of the units.
* An ''activation rule'' for combining inputs to a unit to determine its new activation, represented by a function on the current activation and propagation.
* A ''[[learning rule]]'' for modifying connections based on experience, represented by a change in the weights based on any number of variables.
* An ''environment'' that provides the system with experience, represented by sets of activation vectors for some [[subset]] of the units.

A lot of the research that led to the development of PDP was done in the 1970s, but PDP became popular in the 1980s with the release of the books ''Parallel Distributed Processing: Explorations in the Microstructure of Cognition - Volume 1 (foundations)'' and ''Volume 2 (Psychological and Biological Models)'', by [[James L. McClelland]], [[David E. Rumelhart]] and the PDP Research Group. The books are now considered seminal connectionist works, and it is now common to fully equate PDP and connectionism, although the term "connectionism" is not used in the books.

===Earlier work===
PDP's direct roots were the [[perceptron]] theories of researchers such as [[Frank Rosenblatt]] from the 1950s and 1960s. But perceptron models were made very unpopular by the book ''Perceptrons'' by [[Marvin Minsky]] and [[Seymour Papert]], published in 1969. It demonstrated the limits on the sorts of functions that single-layered (no hidden layer) perceptrons can calculate, showing that even simple functions like the [[exclusive disjunction]] (XOR) could not be handled properly. The PDP books overcame this limitation by showing that multi-level, non-linear neural networks were far more robust and could be used for a vast array of functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0893-6080(89)90020-8| title = Multilayer feedforward networks are universal approximators| journal = Neural Networks| volume = 2| issue = 5| pages = 359| year = 1989| last1 = Hornik | first1 = K. | last2 = Stinchcombe | first2 = M. | last3 = White | first3 = H. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many earlier researchers advocated connectionist style models, for example in the 1940s and 1950s, [[Warren McCulloch]] and [[Walter Pitts]] ([[Artificial neuron|MP neuron]]), [[Donald Olding Hebb]], and [[Karl Lashley]]. McCulloch and Pitts showed how neural systems could implement [[first-order logic]]: Their classic paper "A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity" (1943) is important in this development here. They were influenced by the important work of [[Nicolas Rashevsky]] in the 1930s.  Hebb contributed greatly to speculations about neural functioning, and proposed a learning principle, [[Hebbian learning]], that is still used today. Lashley argued for distributed representations as a result of his failure to find anything like a localized [[Engram (neuropsychology)|engram]] in years of [[lesion]] experiments.

===Connectionism apart from PDP===
Though PDP is the dominant form of connectionism, other theoretical work should also be classified as connectionist.

Many connectionist principles can be traced to early work in [[psychology]], such as that of [[William James]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Anderson  |first1= James A.|last2=Rosenfeld |first2= Edward |date= 1989|title= Neurocomputing: Foundations of Research|url= |location= |publisher= A Bradford Book |page= 1|chapter = Chapter 1: (1890) William James ''Psychology (Brief Course)'' |isbn=978-0262510486 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological theories based on knowledge about the human brain were fashionable in the late 19th century.  As early as 1869, the neurologist [[John Hughlings Jackson]] argued for multi-level, distributed systems. Following from this lead, [[Herbert Spencer]]'s ''Principles of Psychology'', 3rd edition (1872), and [[Sigmund Freud]]'s ''Project for a Scientific Psychology'' (composed 1895) propounded connectionist or proto-connectionist theories. These tended to be speculative theories. But by the early 20th century, [[Edward Thorndike]] was experimenting on learning that posited a connectionist type network.

In the 1950s, [[Friedrich Hayek]] proposed that spontaneous order in the brain arose out of decentralized networks of simple units{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}. Hayek's work was rarely cited in the PDP literature until recently{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}.

Another form of connectionist model was the [[Stratificational linguistics|relational network]] framework developed by the [[linguist]] [[Sydney Lamb]] in the 1960s. Relational networks have been only used by linguists, and were never unified with the PDP approach. As a result, they are now used by very few researchers.

There are also hybrid connectionist models, mostly mixing symbolic representations with neural network models.
The hybrid approach has been advocated by some researchers (such as [[Ron Sun]]).

==Connectionism vs. computationalism debate==
As connectionism became increasingly popular in the late 1980s, some researchers (including [[Jerry Fodor]], [[Steven Pinker]] and others) reacted against it.  They argued that connectionism, as then developing, threatened to obliterate what they saw as the progress being made in the fields of cognitive science and psychology by the classical approach of [[computationalism]]. Computationalism is a specific form of cognitivism that argues that mental activity is [[Computing|computational]], that is, that the mind operates by performing purely formal operations on symbols, like a [[Turing machine]].  Some researchers argued that the trend in connectionism represented a reversion toward [[associationism]] and the abandonment of the idea of a [[language of thought]], something they saw as mistaken. In contrast, those very tendencies made connectionism attractive for other researchers.

Connectionism and computationalism need not be at odds, but the debate in the late 1980s and early 1990s led to opposition between the two approaches.  Throughout the debate, some researchers have argued that connectionism and computationalism are fully compatible, though full consensus on this issue has not been reached.  Differences between the two approaches include the following:

* Computationalists posit symbolic models that are structurally similar to underlying brain structure, whereas connectionists engage in "low-level" modeling, trying to ensure that their models resemble neurological structures.
* Computationalists in general focus on the structure of explicit symbols ([[mental models]]) and [[syntactical]] rules for their internal manipulation, whereas connectionists focus on learning from environmental stimuli and storing this information in a form of connections between neurons.
* Computationalists believe that internal mental activity consists of manipulation of explicit symbols, whereas connectionists believe that the manipulation of explicit symbols provides a poor model of mental activity.
* Computationalists often posit [[domain specificity|domain specific]] symbolic sub-systems designed to support learning in specific areas of cognition (e.g., language, intentionality, number), whereas connectionists posit one or a small set of very general learning-mechanisms.

Despite these differences, some theorists have proposed that the connectionist architecture is simply the manner in which organic brains happen to implement the symbol-manipulation system. This is logically possible, as it is well known that connectionist models can implement symbol-manipulation systems of the kind used in computationalist models,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} as indeed they must be able if they are to explain the human ability to perform symbol-manipulation tasks. But the debate rests on whether this symbol manipulation forms the foundation of cognition in general, so this is not a potential vindication of computationalism. Nonetheless, computational descriptions may be helpful high-level descriptions of cognition of logic, for example.

The debate largely centred on logical arguments about whether connectionist networks could produce the syntactic structure observed in this sort of reasoning. This was later achieved,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} although using processes unlikely to be possible in the brain,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} thus the debate persisted. {{As of | 2016}}, progress in neurophysiology and general advances in the understanding of neural networks have led to the successful modelling of a great many of these early problems, and the debate about fundamental cognition has, thus, largely been decided among neuroscientists in favour of connectionism.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} However, these fairly recent developments have yet to reach consensus acceptance among those working in other fields, such as psychology or philosophy of mind.

Part of the appeal of computational descriptions is that they are relatively easy to interpret, and thus may be seen as contributing to our understanding of particular mental processes, whereas connectionist models are in general more opaque, to the extent that they may be describable only in very general terms (such as specifying the learning algorithm, the number of units, etc.), or in unhelpfully low-level terms. In this sense connectionist models may instantiate, and thereby provide evidence for, a broad theory of cognition (i.e., connectionism), without representing a helpful theory of the particular process that is being modelled. In this sense the debate might be considered as to some extent reflecting a mere difference in the level of analysis in which particular theories are framed.

The recent{{when|date=February 2016}} popularity of [[Cognitive Model#Dynamical systems|dynamical systems]] in [[philosophy of mind]] have added a new perspective on the debate; some authors{{which|date=February 2016}} now argue that any split between connectionism and computationalism is more conclusively characterized as a split between computationalism and [[Cognitive Model#Dynamical systems|dynamical systems]].

In 2014, [[Alex Graves (computer scientist)|Alex Graves]] and others from [[DeepMind]] published a series of papers describing a novel Deep Neural Network structure called the [[Neural Turing Machine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Graves|first1=Alex|title=Neural Turing Machines|arxiv=1410.5401}}&lt;/ref&gt; able to read symbols on a tape and store symbols in memory. Relational Networks, another Deep Network module published by DeepMind are able to create object-like representations and manipulate them to answer complex questions. Relational Networks and Neural Turing Machines are further evidence that connectionism and computationalism need not be at odds.

'''''Crysis 3''''' is a [[first-person shooter]] [[video game]] developed by [[Crytek]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Xbox 360]]. It is the third main installment of the [[Crysis|''Crysis'' series]], a sequel to the 2011 video game ''[[Crysis 2]]''. The multiplayer portion of the game was developed by [[Crytek UK]]. ''Crysis 3''{{'}}s story revolves around Prophet, a Nanosuit holder who is on a quest to take revenge on the Alpha Ceph, the leader of the Ceph alien race. The game's story serves as the end of the ''Crysis'' trilogy. Gameplay revolves around the use of the Nanosuit, which grants players a variety of abilities such as being invisible. New features introduced in ''Crysis 3'' include a new Nanosuit ability called "Rip &amp; Throw", a [[compound bow]] and the "hacking" feature, which allows players to hack into enemies' equipment, drones, and security defenses.

The game is set in a post-apocalyptic New York City, in an effort to combine the urban landscape of ''Crysis 2'' and the forest setting of the original ''[[Crysis (video game)|Crysis]]''. The game introduces the "Seven Wonders", with each wonder having its own unique landscape and tactical layout. Due to complaints about ''Crysis 2''{{'}}s linearity, the game's levels were opened up so as to grant players more freedom. The development team also put efforts into creating a more emotional story, and the story's protagonist was inspired by the lead character of ''[[District 9]]''. The game was developed by a team of 100 people during its 23-month development cycle. [[Crytek UK]] developed the game's multiplayer portion.

Officially announced in April 2012, ''Crysis 3'' received positive reviews upon release. Praise was directed at the weapon selection and customization, menus, visuals and multiplayer, while it was criticized for its story, level design, length, and outdated mechanics in comparison to its predecessors. With a budget of $66 million, the game sold 205,000 copies in its debut month, and became a commercial failure for Electronic Arts. The game was later included in ''The Crysis Trilogy'', a bundle released in February 2014.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Crysis 3 gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|A gameplay screenshot of the game. The screenshot shows Prophet using his compound bow, which is one of the new weapons introduced in ''Crysis 3''.]]
Similar to the earlier games in the ''Crysis'' series, ''Crysis 3'' is a [[first-person shooter]]. Players take control of Prophet as he progresses through [[New York City]] to defeat the Ceph, a technologically advanced alien race. Throughout the game, players can slide, sprint, jump and crouch. When encountering enemies, players can defeat them by using guns or a compound bow, utilizing explosives like [[grenades]] and [[C-4 (explosive)|C4]], or by performing a melee attack.&lt;ref name="Multi-tactics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/crysis-2-multiplayer-strategy-how-to-stop-dying-so-damn-much/|title=Crysis 2 multiplayer strategy &amp;#8211; how to stop dying so damn much|first=Jordan|last=Baughman|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=31 March 2011|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performing certain movements takes up energy from the Nanosuit, the armor worn by Prophet. Some abilities are not available for players to perform or utilize if the Nanosuit's energy is too low; they must wait until energy is refilled. As a result, players are tasked to manage the use of the energy.&lt;ref name="GZ"/&gt; The game's [[artificial intelligence]] was updated allowing enemies to react more quickly to players' attacks. Enemies can take cover when attacked, and can employ strategy to assist and support each other against attacks.&lt;ref name="Gamespy – review"/&gt;

The Nanosuit allows players to identify the threat level, and the weapons held by enemies. Players can tag enemies and items by enabling visor, and can spot enemies using Nano-Vision, which detects the heat of both enemies and allies.&lt;ref name="Multi-tactics"/&gt; Levels are more open-ended than in ''Crysis 2''. Players are given more freedom, and can choose a gameplay style based on direct confrontation, or a more discreet and stealthy approach, in order to deal with enemies and to complete their objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/12/10/crysis-3-a-sun-dappled-slice-of-shader-porn|title=Crysis 3: "A Sun Dappled Slice of Shader Porn"|first=Vincent|last=Ingentio|work=[[IGN]]|date=10 December 2012|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no definite way to beat the game's seven levels. Instead, players can take different alternate routes to reach their objectives.&lt;ref name="Complex review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2013/02/review-crysis-3-crytek-ea-gorgeous-nonsensical-masterpiece|title=Review: 'Crysis 3' is a Gorgeous, Nonsensical Masterpiece|first=Michael|last=Rougeau|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|date=19 February 2013|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Players can fight against enemies utilizing a wide array of gadgets and weapons, and by using the abilities granted by the Nanosuit. They can utilize an invisibility cloak to evade enemies, prevent themselves from being detected, or to perform silent takedowns.&lt;ref name="K1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5904595/the-big-new-things-in-crysis-3-are-deadly-bows-and-nano-domes|title=The Big New Things in Crysis 3 are Deadly Bows and Nano Domes|first=Dougless|last=C Perry|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=24 April 2012|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nanosuit also has an armor mode, which reduces the amount of damage taken, in exchange for slower movement speed. New weapons are introduced in ''Crysis 3'', such as a [[compound bow]]. Players can use the bow while in cloak mode. When using other firearms, the cloak is disrupted and can no longer function until it cools down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-04-24-crysis-3-preview-welcome-back-to-the-jungle|title=Crysis 3 Preview: Welcome (Back) To The Jungle|first=Will|last=Potter|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=24 April 2012|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrows can be collected by players after use.&lt;ref name="arrow"/&gt; Players can hack into enemies' technology, one of the game's new features. In addition, players can hack security codes, weapon boxes, Ceph technology, mines, lasers, and sentry turrets, which can all be used to fight against enemies.&lt;ref name="D1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/preview-our-first-look-at-crysis-3-226375.phtml|title=Preview: Our First Look at Crysis 3|first=Hamza|last=Aziz|work=[[Destructoid]]|date=24 April 2012|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Players can also upgrade and customize their weapons and the Nanosuit. They can change the attachment and ammo types for their weapons. For instance, players can change between explosive arrows and electric arrows for their bow.&lt;ref name="arrow"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/e3-getting-arrowed-in-crysis-3-229190.phtml|title=E3: Getting Arrowed in Crysis 3|first=Jim|last=Sterling|work=[[Destructoid]]|date=9 June 2012|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nanosuit can be upgraded by collecting different suit upgrade modules scattered across the world. These upgrades can increase the suit's properties, and strengthen or unlock new abilities for players as they progress through the game.&lt;ref name="GZ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamezone.com/originals/crysis-3-walkthrough-and-complete-guide|title=Crysis 3 walkthrough and complete guide|work=GameZone|date=25 February 2013|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multiplayer ===
Gameplay remains similar when playing the multiplayer mode. Unlike the single-player campaign, when players sprint or boost their armor in the multiplayer modes, it does not use any nanosuit energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/08/15/crysis-3s-multiplayer-makes-you-feel-hunted|title=Crysis 3 Multiplayer Makes You Feel Hunted|first=Keza|last=MacDonald|work=[[IGN]]|date=15 August 2012|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 8 different modes, with a total of 12 available maps to play on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/76119/crysis-3-trailer-gives-multiplayer-overview|title=Crysis 3 trailer gives multiplayer overview|first=Alice|last=O'Conner|work=[[Shacknews]]|date=9 October 2012|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are Team Deathmatch, Deathmatch, Crash Site / Spears, Capture the Relay / Extraction, Hunter, Assault, Cell Vs Rebel, Developers Choice, Maximum Team Deathmatch, and Maximum Deathmatch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/wikis/crysis-3/Game_Modes|title=Game Modes – Crysis 3 Wiki Guide – IGN|website=IGN|language=en|access-date=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scattered throughout each map are special alien weapons with scarce ammo and can be picked up by players.&lt;ref name="PCG – review" /&gt; Players also have a new passive ability called Rip and Throw,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-01-23-crysis-3-open-beta-for-pc-ps3-xbox-360-on-29th-january|title=Crysis 3 open beta for PC, PS3, Xbox 360 on 29th January|first=Robert|last=Purchese|date=23 January 2013|accessdate=19 July 2015|work=[[Eurogamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they interact with environmental objects to create obstacles for hostile players and tactical advantages for themselves.This interactibility with the environment was pushed heavily upon the team by their publisher, EA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mapcore.org/articles/interviews/interview-with-paul-paulh-haynes-homefront-the-revolution-senior-level-designer-r43/|title=Interview with Paul 'PaulH' Haynes, Homefront: The Revolution Senior Level Designer|website=MapCore|language=en-US|access-date=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A refined kill streak system is introduced in ''Crysis 3'', allowing players to gain rewards by killing hostile players simultaneously while collecting their dog tag.&lt;ref name="Multi-tactics" /&gt; This refined kill system involves collecting dog tags that are dropped by enemy players when killed. The perks gained from this vary from map to map. They are Maximum Radar, Swarmer, Gamma Burst, EMP, and Maximum Nanosuit, which reveals enemy players locations on the mini-map. 

In addition to traditional multiplayer modes, a new multiplayer mode, the Hunter mode, is featured in the game. It is an [[asymmetry|asymmetrical multiplayer]] mode which pits two teams of players, playing as either hunters, or troopers from CELL, against each other. The three CELL classes are equipped with completely different weapons, and defeated troopers respawn as hunters and have to defeat their former teammates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/crysis-3-preview-singleplayer-and-hunter-multiplayer-mode/|title=Crysis 3 preview – Hands-on singleplayer and Hunter multiplayer mode|first=Lorenzo |last=Veloria|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=6 December 2012|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hunters are equipped with the nanosuit and infinite cloak, as well as the Hunter Bow, which allows the hunter to fire while they're cloaked.

==Synopsis==

===Setting===
Players take on the role of Prophet as he returns to New York in 2047, 24 years after the events of ''Crysis 2''. He discovers the city has been encased in a giant [[Domed city|Nanodome]] created by the corrupt CELL corporation. The [[New York City]] Liberty Dome is a veritable urban rainforest teeming with overgrown trees, dense swamplands, and raging rivers. Within the Liberty Dome, seven distinct and treacherous environments are known as the Seven Wonders. Prophet is said to be on a "revenge mission" after uncovering the truth behind CELL's motives for building the quarantined Nanodome.

===Plot===
After the events of ''Crysis 2'', Psycho and Prophet travel the world looking for the Alpha Ceph, the ultimate Ceph leader. Prophet and Psycho finally trace the Alpha Ceph in [[Russia]] and imprison it. However, shortly afterwards CELL Corporation, now attempting global domination of land and technology, disables Prophet in Siberia and captures all the Nanosuit soldiers, skinning them of their suits to recover the Ceph genetics stored in them. CELL transfers Prophet to a facility to skin him. Locked in a storage device, Prophet is transported by CELL to New York, encased within a giant "Nanodome". He is saved by a resistance force, led by Claire Fontanelli and Jacob Hargreave's colleague, Karl Ernst Rasch, as Prophet is the only Nanosuit holder left who can stop CELL. Psycho, who was saved by Claire after being skinned, explains to Prophet that during his absence, CELL used Ceph technology to generate [[Renewable energy|unlimited energy]], and gained a monopoly over the world's power supply. Those who could not pay for energy were enslaved by debt to CELL. The source of CELL's power generation for the entire world, called System X, is located in now abandoned [[New York City|New York]]. The resistance group wants System X destroyed to free the world from CELL.

After Psycho and Prophet disable System X's core, it turns out that it is a system protocol designed to contain the Alpha Ceph while draining energy off of the alien. However, the secondary defense protocol was initiated, causing the power facility to self-destruct. The Alpha Ceph, free from containment, opens a [[wormhole]] to the Ceph homeworld. They plan to send an even larger force to invade Earth through the wormhole and [[Terraforming|terraform]] it at the expense of all local life's extinction. With the Alpha Ceph no longer dormant, the Ceph coordinator reactivates, and a coordinated Ceph attack ensues. Prophet decides to kill the Alpha Ceph and end the alien threat.

After unlocking his potential ability by removing some neural blocks in his suit, Prophet learns that CELL plans to use Archangel, a satellite-based energy distribution device that can draw power from the world's power grid, as a [[Directed-energy weapon|directed energy weapon]] to destroy the Alpha Ceph. Firing it would cause a chain reaction that would destroy Earth. They shut off the weapon before it has enough energy to fire. Along the way, Psycho discovers Claire was one of the scientists who reluctantly skinned him, causing friction in his previously romantic relationship with her. Unfortunately, Karl, who had secretly used Ceph technology to extend his lifespan, is possessed by the Ceph and critically wounds Claire while psychically crippling Prophet. Regaining control after Psycho shot him, he sacrifices himself to distract the Alpha Ceph. Prophet, Psycho, and Claire board the [[VTOL]] and engage in a massive air battle with Ceph ships, eventually crashing. Claire dies in the process. Psycho, saddened by her death, laments to Prophet that he is powerless because he no longer possesses a Nanosuit. Upon being told that his lack of a Nanosuit saved him from Karl's control earlier, Psycho, now going by his real name, Michael, finds another VTOL to take Prophet to the Ceph.

Michael and Prophet head towards the Alpha Ceph, but are bogged down by the Ceph Master Mind. Prophet finds his way through the Ceph Army hordes and kills the Alpha Ceph which in turn kills all other Ceph troopers in the area. However, they do not have enough time to destroy the Ceph wormhole structure and the beam powering the wormhole pulls Prophet into [[Outer space|space]]. Now in orbit around Earth, Prophet sees a massive Ceph warship coming through the wormhole. Initially, he has all but given up and begins shutting down. Recalling Archangel's power, Prophet wakes up and hacks into the satellite, and uses it to destroy the warship. The explosion collapses the wormhole and Prophet is pushed back to Earth. He crashlands in the water near the Lingshan Islands where the events of ''[[Crysis (video game)|Crysis]]'' took place 27 years earlier.

When Prophet wakes the next morning, he is in an abandoned hut in Lingshan, the same area Nomad initially encountered during the events of ''Crysis''. A television playing in the background informs him that CELL's assets were frozen by Senator Strickland as the corporation is under investigation. As the neural blocks are removed from the Nanosuit, the suit's outer layer is changed to reform Prophet's former physical body, resurrecting him. He walks out onto the beach and relinquishes his past by throwing his tags into the water. He then decides to use his actual name "Laurence Barnes" from then on. The game ends with Prophet walking back to the shed and activating his stealth ability.

Then a cutscene is played; beginning with a [[first-person view]] of a soldier on the chase, then changing to a free view of a total of 2 CELL soldiers rushing 3 "board members" inside of what seems like a bunker, added with a few seconds of a view from a [[night vision device]]. After entering "safehouse 4," the two soldiers are shot by the soldier, revealed to be Michael, who later claimed that he would like to make a complaint to the "board members" regarding his treatment at one of their "hospitals."

==Development==
''Crysis 3''{{'}}s development began in February 2011, two months before the release of ''Crysis 2''.&lt;ref name="D1"/&gt; The development of the game's campaign was handled by [[Crytek]]; its multiplayer was handled by [[Crytek UK]]. Its development budget was significantly smaller than that of ''Crysis 2'', as resources and manpower were relocated to develop ''[[Homefront 2]]''{{efn|''Homefront 2'' was later renamed ''[[Homefront: The Revolution]]'' and was no longer developed by Crytek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sarkar |first=Samit |date=30 July 2014 |url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/7/30/5951985/deep-silver-homefront-the-revolution-ip-dambuster-studios |title=Deep Silver buys Homefront from Crytek, moves Homefront: The Revolution to new studio |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} and ''[[Ryse: Son of Rome]]''. As a result, only about 100 people worked on the game during its 23 months development.&lt;ref name="crytek pdf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crytek.com/download/fmx2013_c3_art_tech_donzallaz_sousa.pdf |title=The Art and Technology behind Crysis 3|publisher=[[Crytek]] |year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The team size for ''Crysis 2'' is about 150 people and the development time is 38 months.&lt;ref name="crytek pdf"/&gt;}} The game's budget was about $66 million.&lt;ref name="budget"/&gt;

''Crysis 2'' was criticised for abandoning the island setting of the original ''Crysis''.&lt;ref name="au"/&gt;  The studio decided to recreate New York City and set the game in a post-apocalyptic environment.&lt;ref name="EuroG on Series"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-11-12-ditching-far-cry-piracy-gameplay-and-just-about-breaking-even-crytek-on-the-ups-and-downs-of-the-crysis-series|title=Ditching Far Cry, piracy, gameplay and just about breaking even: Crytek on the ups and downs of the Crysis series|first=Wesley|last=Yin-Poole|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=12 November 2014|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To do this, the company introduced a concept called "Nanodome", a dome set up by CELL to isolate New York City, which had fallen to ruins over the years. Plants have grown significantly, leading to an environment that is a mix between an urban environment and the jungle setting of the past two games.&lt;ref name="au"/&gt; The decision was made to create this environment as the team wanted to stay away from typical urban war field shown in other games of the same genre.&lt;ref name="K1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/1/24/3754708/crysis-3-interview-posthuman-interest|title=Crysis 3 Interview: Posthuman Interest|first=Arthur|last=Gies|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=24 April 2012|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of having a rainforest in the abandoned wasteland, the Nanodome is used to fix the shape of the forest, and Crytek hoped that it would define the atmosphere and the narrative of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2012/04/24/crysis-3-preview/|title=Crysis 3 first look: Bullets, bows, and the Big Apple (preview)|first=Omri|last=Petitte|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=24 April 2012|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game's main protagonist is Prophet, a nanosuit holder who had previously appeared in ''Crysis'' and ''Crysis 2''. He returns in ''Crysis 3'' as Crytek considered him as the most complex character who has the longest heritage in the series. When designing him, the team took inspiration from the protagonist of ''[[District 9]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/04/25/crytek-on-fusing-crysis-1-crysis-2-and-district-9/|title=Crytek On Fusing Crysis 1, Crysis 2, And District 9|first=Nathan|last=Grayson|work=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=25 April 2012|accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psycho from the original ''Crysis'' and ''[[Crysis Warhead]]'' returns as Prophet's companion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-vulnerable-side-of-crysis-3/1100-6400020/|title=The Vulnerable Side of Crysis 3|first=Shaun|last=McInnis |date=14 November 2012|accessdate=18 July 2015|work=[[GameSpot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game revolves around Prophet attempting to redeem himself by taking revenge after finding his former squad members are dead.&lt;ref name="K1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/crysis-3-preview-first-look-urban-jungle-bows-arrows-hacking/|title=Crysis 3 preview – First look at the urban jungle, bows, arrows, and hacking|first=Lorenzo |last=Veloria|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=24 April 2012|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story explores the themes of redemption and revenge as well as the relationship between humans and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2012/06/04/crysis-3-brings-the-jungle-gun-hacking-and-silent-stealth-kills-to-manhattan-hands-on-preview/|title=Crysis 3 brings the jungle, gun hacking, and silent stealth kills to Manhattan (hands-on preview)|first=Dean|last=Takahashi|date=4 June 2012|accessdate=18 July 2015|work=[[VentureBeat]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Read, the game's producer, summed up the game calling it "human".&lt;ref name="Human"/&gt; Unlike ''Crysis 2''{{'}}s protagonist Alcatraz who does not speak throughout the game, Prophet is voiced in ''Crysis 3'' in an effort to deliver more emotional connection.&lt;ref name="Human"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2013/02/08/crysis-3-were-only-human-after-all/|title=Crysis 3: we're only human, after all|first=Dave|last=Cook|work=[[VG247]]|date=8 February 2013|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company made use of [[performance capture]] to record actor's performance, body movements and facial expressions. According to Read, this helps the company to create a more affecting and emotional story. This was not done in the previous games due to technological limitations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/02/15/just-how-human-is-crysis-3|title=Just How Human Is Crysis 3|first=Colin|last=Campbell|work=[[IGN]]|date=15 February 2013|accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the original ''Crysis'', which gives players more freedom to explore, ''Crysis 2'' was criticized for being too linear.&lt;ref name="EuroG on Series"/&gt;  As a result, in developing the game's campaign, Crytek attempted to integrate the two major aspects of the previous installments, the freedom given in the original ''Crysis'' and the linearity of ''Crysis 2''. Despite not being as open as the first half of ''Crysis'', maps are significantly larger in this game than in previous installments. Several linear segments were preserved.&lt;ref name="MB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/crysis-3-creative-director-on-sandbox-play-versus-michael-bay-moments/|title=Crysis 3 creative director on sandbox play versus 'Michael Bay moments'|first=Tom|last=Francis|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=1 May 2012|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crytek referred to the game's map as "action bubbles", which do not necessarily fix players in a small place but allows them to move around freely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/gaming/2012/6/4/3057537/crysis-3-is-all-about-a-return-to-form-wide-open-spaces|title='Crysis 3' is all about a return to form: Wide open spaces|first=Russ|last=Frushtick|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=4 June 2012|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linearity was preserved as developers considered having such segments present could help players to experience "epic" moments and "massive [[Michael Bay]]" moments.&lt;ref name="au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/home-entertainment/crysis-3-will-learn-from-past-mistakes-and-success-says-rasmus-hojengaard/story-e6frfrt9-1226339023359|title=Crysis 3 will learn from past mistakes and success, says Rasmus Hojengaard|date=27 April 2012|work=[[News.com.au]]|accessdate=18 July 2015|first=Will|last=Colvin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MB"/&gt; Crytek hoped that by opening up levels they could give players a sense of control, allowing them to plan and execute strategy.&lt;ref name="MB"/&gt; The game's seven levels were developed simultaneously, and the focus phrases of gameplay, art and optimization of a level was about one to two weeks.&lt;ref name="crytek pdf"/&gt;

Another theme featured in the game is "hunt" and, as a result, many weapons were built around the concept. The studio wanted to stay away from typical weapon design and did not want a weapon to simply differentiate between ''Crysis 3'' and ''Crysis 2''. The team aimed to use weapons to create narrative. The game features a compound bow which is reminiscent of a weapon that a hunter often uses. The game's gameplay is built based on three pillars, access, adapt, and attack.&lt;ref name="K1"/&gt; Players are often tasked to do detect, spot, and to learn their enemies' behaviors and patterns before attacking. With the bow, players are encouraged to play the game [[stealth game|stealthily]], extending the game's combat. A new feature called "hacking" was developed. According to Crytek, hacking plays a huge role throughout the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/gaming/2012/4/24/2971119/crysis-3-offers-new-ways-to-survive|title=Crysis 3 is a study in hunting and being hunted|first=Emily|last=Gera|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=24 April 2012|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's combat was also made more fast-paced than that of its predecessors.&lt;ref name="au"/&gt;

The multiplayer portion of the game was created by [[Crytek UK]]. It was designed to improve the efficiency of the Nanosuit in an online environment. In an effort to create memorable maps, the team designed routes that can only be discovered after a player's first playthrough. Crytek UK hoped that this approach would help players to become more immersed in the game's universe. The Hunter mode, introduced in this game, originated from a ''[[TimeSplitters]]'''s Gladiator mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamestm.co.uk/discuss/crytek-uk-interview-crysis-3-multiplayer-free-radical-and-super-human-abilities/|title=Crysis 3: Crytek UK interview|work=[[GamesTM]]|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to make sprint energy separated from the nanosuit energy was due to the development team's desire to create larger levels, and help players to navigate the map in a faster way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamereactor.eu/news/42231/Crytek+on+Crysis+3+multiplayer/|title=Crytek on Crysis 3 multiplayer|first=Bengt|last=Lemne|work=[[Gamereactor]]|date=21 August 2011|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game's music was composed by Borislav Slavov, who had previously led the soundtrack development of ''Crysis 2''. New music was composed for the game, while some other themes from the past installments were rearranged. The theme of the game's music is changed so as to fit the game's post-apocalyptic setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crytek.com/blog/inside-crytek-interview-part-2-christian-schilling-answers-your-questions|title=Inside Crytek Interview Part 2: Christian Schilling answers your questions|date=22 June 2012|accessdate=22 July 2015|publisher=[[Crytek]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722222916/http://www.crytek.com/blog/inside-crytek-interview-part-2-christian-schilling-answers-your-questions|archivedate=22 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's music is dynamic and is designed to reflect players' gameplay style. As a result, when players use a radical approach to complete missions, more exciting background music will be played. In contrast, when players are playing stealthily, the background music will be relatively calmer and quieter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://speakhertz.com/7023/interview-crytek-audio-directors-and-composer-simon-pressey-florian-fusslin-boris-slavov|title=Interview: Crytek Audio Directors And Composer – Simon Pressey, Florian Füsslin &amp; Borislav Slavov|work=Sparkhertz|date=26 May 2014|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing and release==
In November 2010, Nathan Camarillo, an executive producer from Crytek, revealed that the ''Crysis'' series could potentially be a very long-running franchise,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/11/10/crytek-sees-a-very-long-running-franchise-in-crysis/|title=Crytek sees a 'very long-running' franchise in Crysis|first=Ben|last=Gilbert|work=[[Joystiq]]|date=10 November 2010|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the company considered the series' universe easy for players to get into and become invested in. He added: "As the franchise grows down the line, there's no reason it can't be as big [as ''[[Call of Duty]]'']".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2010-11-10-crytek-crysis-can-be-as-big-as-cod|title=Crytek: Crysis can be as big as COD|first=Wesley|last=Yin-Poole|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=10 November 2010|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story elements of the game had already been planned in January 2011.

''Crysis 3'' has received generally positive reviews from critics. Aggregating review websites [[Metacritic]] rated the Xbox 360 version 76/100,&lt;ref name="MC-X360" /&gt; the PlayStation 3 version 77/100&lt;ref name="MC-PS3" /&gt; and the PC version 76/100.&lt;ref name="MC-PC" /&gt;

The visuals and graphics of the game were widely praised by reviewers. Christian Donlan of [[Eurogamer]] praised the game's stable [[frame rate]]. Furthermore, he considered the game's environmental design "artful".&lt;ref name="EuroG- review"/&gt; Matthew Rorie of [[GameSpy]] thought that the game was visually stunning. He applauded the team at Crytek for creating an environment that is "both inhospitable and queerly beautiful".&lt;ref name="Gamespy – review"/&gt; Matt Bertz of ''[[Game Informer]]'' praised the visuals powered by CryEngine, and considered the game one of the best-looking games ever created. He especially praised its realistic environments, water effects, and character facial animation.&lt;ref name="GI- review"/&gt; Kevin VanOrd of [[GameSpot]] also praised the mix of the decayed urban environment and the rainforest, saying that it made the game striking to look at.&lt;ref name="Gamespot – review"/&gt;

The game's design was praised by various reviewers. Donlan considered the game's support of stealth a welcoming addition, despite calling the game's last level a forgettable experience.&lt;ref name="EuroG- review"/&gt; Rorie praised the game's map design; he opined that the opened-up levels encourage exploration.&lt;ref name="Gamespy – review"/&gt; Bertz considered the game's world had successfully captured a balance between the settings of its predecessors, and that the larger levels allowed players to deploy strategy before performing attacks. He added that some of the best missions were featured in the later stages of the game.&lt;ref name="GI- review"/&gt; Tristan Ogilvie of [[IGN]] thought that the control was almost perfect, despite criticizing the clumsy control of several segments which require players to control vehicles.&lt;ref name="IGN- review"/&gt; VanOrd criticized the game for being too easy for players to play.&lt;ref name="Gamespot – review"/&gt;

The game's online multiplayer received positive reviews from critics. Josh Harmon of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' thought that the game's multiplayer was better than the campaign, and that it made the overall experience more enjoyable.&lt;ref name="EGMreview"/&gt; Donlan praised the Hunter mode; he believed that it had delivered a tense experience.&lt;ref name="EuroG- review"/&gt; Bertz echoed similar thoughts, but felt that the mode's appeal was not as good as typical modes like Domination. As well, he criticized the multiplayer's respawn system and terrain-design.&lt;ref name="GI- review"/&gt; Lorenzo Veloria of [[GamesRadar]] thought that some of the game modes were unique and entertaining, despite noting some technical issues.&lt;ref name="GRadar- review"/&gt; Michael Rougeau of ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' criticized the Hunter mode, calling it "unbalanced". He furthered criticized the game for lacking a co-operative multiplayer mode.&lt;ref name="Complex review"/&gt; David Hinkle of ''[[Joystiq]]'' also noted some design errors in the Hunter mode.&lt;ref name="Joystiq"/&gt;

The story was disliked by critics compared to the game's other aspects. Harmon thought that several emotional segments of the game failed to deliver, as well as criticizing the forgettable storyline and plot twists. Despite that, he praised the game's finale and considered that it brought a proper closure to the ''Crysis'' trilogy.&lt;ref name="EGMreview"/&gt; In contrast, Donlan commented that it was not quite the conclusion the series deserved.&lt;ref name="EuroG- review"/&gt; Rorie thought that the story was more mature than its predecessors, despite having a relatively weak start and short length of about six hours.&lt;ref name="Gamespy – review"/&gt; Bertz opined that the story was the most cohesive of the titles in the series.&lt;ref name="GI- review"/&gt; Veloria, however, criticized the game's narrative; he added that it was uninspiring due to the lack of character development and interesting dialogue.&lt;ref name="GRadar- review"/&gt; In contrast, Ogilvie thought that the game's dialogue and voice-acting were excellent, citing the game's relateable characters that its predecessors failed to achieve. He considered the game's storytelling a massive improvement for the series.&lt;ref name="IGN- review"/&gt;

Many reviewers considered ''Crysis 3'' was an evolution of the series instead of a groundbreaking revolution. Rorie criticized the game for being unambitious, and that despite the game's overall refinements, it had not strayed far enough from its predecessors. He concluded that ''Crysis 3'' did not achieve the revolution brought by the original ''Crysis''.&lt;ref name="Gamespy – review"/&gt; Veloria thought that the title failed to bring any new element to the genre, but the overall experience delivered by the game was still satisfying.&lt;ref name="GRadar- review"/&gt;  Evan Lahti of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' commented that the game did not surprise players, and that the title presented a feeling of ''Crysis 2: Episode 2'' instead of a proper sequel.&lt;ref name="PCG – review"/&gt;

==Future==
With ''Crysis 3'' being the end of the ''Crysis'' trilogy, Crytek teased that the series would have a "radical future". Yerli confirmed that the next installment would not be called ''Crysis 4'', as he considered such a title "misleading".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-11-12-crytek-plots-much-more-radical-future-crysis-but-it-wont-be-called-crysis-4|title=Crytek plots "much more radical" future Crysis, but it won't be called Crysis 4|first=Wesley|last=Yin-Poole|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=12 November 2012|accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 June 2012, it was revealed that [[Crytek]] would focus only on [[free-to-play]] titles following the release of ''Crysis 3''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/pc/warface/news/crytek_all_our_future_games_will_be_free-to-play.html|title=Crytek: All our future games will be free-to-play|first=Neon|last=Kelly|work=VideoGamer.com|date=8 June 2012|accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''dead bell''' or '''deid bell''' (Scots), also a 'death', 'mort', 'lych', 'passing bell' or 'skellet bell'&lt;ref name="M130"&gt;McKay, page 130&lt;/ref&gt; was a form of [[hand bell]] used in [[Scotland]] and northern England&lt;ref name="Church monument symbolism"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Church monument symbolism|publisher=|url=http://www.churchmonumentssociety.org/newfile21.htm|accessdate=2009-11-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808081158/http://www.churchmonumentssociety.org/newfile21.htm|archivedate=2009-08-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in conjunction with deaths and funerals up until the 19th century.

==Origins==
Belief in the supernatural was common in the [[Middle Ages]] and special protective powers were sometimes attributed to certain objects, including bells. The [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] itself condoned the use of bells to frighten away evil spirits and this ensured the practice's survival and development. Bells were often baptised, and once baptised were believed by many to possess the power to ward off evil spells and spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=  |first= |authorlink=|title=A little general history of bells and handbells|publisher=|url=http://www.handbells.org.au/history/genhist.htm|accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the dead bell was typical of this belief, rung for the recently deceased to keep evil spirits away from the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=  |first= |authorlink=|title=Old and sold |publisher=|url=http://www.oldandsold.com/articles01/article731.shtml|accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dead bell was therefore originally rung for two reasons: firstly to seek the prayers of [[Christian]]s for a dead person's soul, and secondly to drive away the evil spirits who stood at the foot of the dead person's bed and around the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=  |first= |authorlink=|title=The Passing Bell|publisher=Elfinspell|url=http://www.elfinspell.com/AndrewsBell.html|accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the dead bell is illustrated on the [[Bayeux tapestry]] at the funeral of [[Edward the Confessor]] and may have been brought over to [[Great Britain|Britain]] by the [[Normans]].&lt;ref name="W40"/&gt;

==Uses==
Before the [[Reformation]], [[friar]]s in [[Glasgow]] rang the dead bell through the streets for the repose of the soul of the deceased, especially if the individual was a benefactor of the church. It is known that the ancient bell of [[Saint Mungo]] (aka [[Saint Kentigern]]) was used for this purpose. From 1454 a record survives of the bell being rung annually&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, Page 70&lt;/ref&gt; for the soul of Johne Steuart (John Stewart), the first Provost of Glasgow, who had left lands and property to the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=  |first= |authorlink=|title=Glasgow's coat of arms|publisher=|url=http://www.rampantscotland.com/know/blknow_flourish.htm|accessdate=2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A record of 1509 for Sir Archibald Crawford of Cadder also shows that the ringing of the dead bell sometimes took place more than once and was intended to encourage others to pray for the deceased, his ancestors, and other Christian souls.&lt;ref&gt;MacGeorge, Page 23&lt;/ref&gt; In 1594 the presbytery of Glasgow attempted to recover the right of use of the dead bell, arguing that it was an ecclesiastical and not a secular function.&lt;ref name="MG24"&gt;MacGeorge, Page 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ballad of Willie's Lyke-Wake from the north of Scotland records the payment of a [[groat (coin)|groat]] for the ringing of the dead bell at his funeral by the bedral or bell-man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=  |first= |authorlink=|title=Wllie's Lyke-wake|publisher=|url=http://www.springthyme.co.uk/ballads/balladtexts/25_Willie%27sLykeWake.html|accessdate=2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later, secular times, the bell ringer would pass through the streets of villages, towns or cities announcing the name of a recently deceased person, with details of the funeral. At the funeral the bell ringer, often the beadle, would walk at the head the cortege, solemnly ringing the bell from the home of the deceased until the church was reached.&lt;ref name="M130"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Love (2009), Pages 219 - 220&lt;/ref&gt; The bell was also sometimes used to indicate the point at which the coffin-bearers were changed.&lt;ref name="L60"/&gt;

The dead bell ringer was instructed to go through the town no more than twice and was not permitted to use the words "faithful" or "God". He was not permitted to ring the bell before sunrise or after sunset.&lt;ref name="N101"&gt;Napier (1873), Page 101&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirk session records show that in one [[Ayrshire]] parish the dead bell ringer was paid at a rate of a penny a mile at first, rising to two pence per mile by 1762.&lt;ref name="L60"/&gt; The income from the ringing of the dead bell went to the kirk session and was used to support the poor.&lt;ref name="L60"&gt;Love (1989), Page 60&lt;/ref&gt;

The ballad of "Barbara Allan" reads&lt;ref name="N103"&gt;Napier (1873), Page 103&lt;/ref&gt;:-
{| cellpadding=10 border="0" align=center
|-
| bgcolor=#f4f4f4|
"She had not gane a mile but twa,&lt;br&gt;
When she heard the deid bell ringing,&lt;br&gt;
And every jow that the deid bell gaed,&lt;br&gt;
Twas wae to Barbara Allan."&lt;br&gt;
|}

Records show that the use of the dead bell was common in Eastern Scotland during the seventeenth and eighteenth century and for many years before.&lt;ref name="W40"&gt;Willsher, Page 40&lt;/ref&gt; In pre-reformation times the dead bell was also used to summon the priest to administer the last rites.&lt;ref name="W40"/&gt;

In the eighteenth century, the church [[beadle]] went around the parish farms, Kirton, and hamlets at the time of the death and later when the funeral arrangements had been settled.&lt;ref name="M130"/&gt;&lt;ref name="W40"/&gt;

At poor people's funerals the dead bell was hung on a tree and rung throughout the service.&lt;ref name="W40"/&gt;

The dead bell was held in high regard and one bell ringer was reportedly sacked for an indecent use of the dead bell.&lt;ref name="W40"/&gt;

In the [[Inns of Court]], as well as the usual use, a passing bell was rung on the appointment of a member as a [[Serjeant-at-Law]], who was said to have "died to the Inn" as he left his Inn of Court and joined [[Serjeant's Inn]], until appointments of Serjeants ceased in the 19th century.

==Examples==

The [[Loudoun Kirk]] dead bell still survived in 1894, having originally been sent to the parishioners from Holland by [[James Campbell, 2nd Earl of Loudoun]] who died in 1684. It had ''Loudoun Kirk'' cast in raised lettering and was used at funeral processions; it was held by Mrs. Semple at Loudoun Village in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;Adamson, Page 189&lt;/ref&gt; Loudoun parish church at [[Newmilns]] has a deid bell inscribed "Countess of Loudoun". The [[Kilmarnock]] example had the town's name and the date "1639" and was preserved in the town hall. The [[Galston, East Ayrshire|Galston]] example had the name and the date "1722". The Maybole dead bell had no markings and after being exhibited at the 1911 Glasgow Exhibition it remained in the [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum|Kelvingove Museum]]'s collections.&lt;ref&gt;Love (2009), Pages 219 - 221&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Hawick]] dead bell is recorded.

An example of 1641 from Glasgow was made to replace the ancient [[Saint Mungo]]'s. This bell had the Chapter of Glasgow's seal on it, a tree and a salmon, together with a representation of an ancient square-shaped bell; like that of Saint Mungo, which still existed at that date.&lt;ref name="MG25"/&gt; Saint Mungo's bell was rescued by a Glasgow magistrate, James Laing, after the reformation and the Glasgow officials purchased it for the substantial sum of £10 Scots in 1577.&lt;ref name="MG24"/&gt; In 1640 the council had a new dead bell made, Saint Mungo's bell probably having become too worn. This was then used for many years and then lost; however, in 1867 it was recovered and returned to the Glasgow corporation.&lt;ref name="MG25"&gt;MacGeorge, Page 25&lt;/ref&gt; The present whereabouts of Saint Mungo's bell is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;MacGeorge, Page 26&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kilmarnock funeral bell carries the inscription "Kilmarnock, 1639" and is made of bell metal, 8&amp;nbsp;inches high and 7&amp;nbsp;inches wide at the mouth. Its use was remembered by local inhabitants still alive in the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;Kilmarnock Funeral Bell, Page 82&lt;/ref&gt; In 1873 the [[Dunblane]] dead bell was kept in [[Dunblane Cathedral]].&lt;ref name="N104"&gt;Napier (1873), Page 104&lt;/ref&gt; Partick's dead bell was similar to Glasgow's and was dated 1726 and after many travels it was given to the Partick Curling Club.&lt;ref name="N104"&gt;Napier (1873), Page 104&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hexham]], [[Carlisle]] and [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]] are recorded to have used dead bells as late at the 1870's in the case of [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]].&lt;ref name="N103"&gt;Napier (1873), Page 103&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gravestones==
In Northern England and Scotland dead bells are not uncommon as symbols of death on funerary monuments.&lt;ref name="Church monument symbolism"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=  |first= |authorlink=|title=Dead Bell on tomstone|publisher=|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/thecollector/14170274/|accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an emblem of mortality the dead bell was mainly confined to eighteenth-century tombstones in the North-East of Scotland, especially in Morayshire and Aberdeenshire. In Angus and Perthshire its use is rare and further south it only occurs on seventeenth-century stones.&lt;ref&gt;Willsher, Page 41&lt;/ref&gt; The handbell is more common than the church bell and rope, the wooden handle on former being clearly depicted.&lt;ref&gt;Love (1989), Page 72&lt;/ref&gt;

==Omens==
[[James Hogg]], the Ettrick Shepherd, wrote that the dead bell was the 'tinkling in the ears' which the country people regard as the secret intelligence of some friend's decease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |authorlink= |title=Dead Bell |publisher= |url=http://www.fife.50megs.com/dead-bell.htm |accessdate=2009-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.bibalex.org/web/20050223115510/http://www.fife.50megs.com/dead-bell.htm |archivedate=2005-02-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deep learning''' (also known as '''deep structured learning'''  or '''hierarchical learning''') is part of a broader family of [[machine learning]] methods based on [[learning representation|learning data representation]]s, as opposed to task-specific algorithms. Learning can be [[Supervised learning|supervised]], [[Semi-supervised learning|semi-supervised]] or [[Unsupervised learning|unsupervised]].&lt;ref name="BENGIO2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SCHIDHUB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NatureBengio"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bengio |first1=Yoshua |last2=LeCun |first2= Yann| last3=Hinton | first3= Geoffrey|year=2015 |title=Deep Learning |journal=Nature |volume=521 |issue=7553 |pages=436–444 |doi=10.1038/nature14539 |pmid=26017442|bibcode=2015Natur.521..436L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deep learning models are vaguely inspired by information processing and communication patterns in biological [[nervous system]]s yet have various differences from the structural and functional properties of biological [[brain|brains]] (especially [[human brains]]), which make them incompatible with [[neuroscience]] evidences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marblestone|first=Adam H.|last2=Wayne|first2=Greg|last3=Kording|first3=Konrad P.|date=2016|title=Toward an Integration of Deep Learning and Neuroscience |journal=Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience |volume=10|pages=94|doi=10.3389/fncom.2016.00094 |pmc=5021692|pmid=27683554}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olshausen|first1=B.

== Definition ==
Deep learning is a class of [[machine learning]] [[algorithm]]s that:&lt;ref name="BOOK2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Yu|first2=D.|year=2014|title=Deep Learning: Methods and Applications|url=http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/209355/DeepLearning-NowPublishing-Vol7-SIG-039.pdf|journal=Foundations and Trends in Signal Processing|volume=7|issue=3–4|pages=1–199|doi=10.1561/2000000039|last1=Deng|first1=L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pages=199–200}}
* use a cascade of multiple layers of [[Nonlinear filter|nonlinear processing]] units for [[feature extraction]] and transformation. Each successive layer uses the output from the previous layer as input. 
* learn in [[Supervised learning|supervised]] (e.g., classification) and/or [[Unsupervised learning|unsupervised]] (e.g., pattern analysis) manners.
* learn multiple levels of representations that correspond to different levels of abstraction; the levels form a hierarchy of concepts.

== Overview ==
Most modern deep learning models are based on an [[artificial neural network]], although they can also include [[propositional formula]]s or latent variables organized layer-wise in deep [[generative model]]s such as the nodes in [[Deep belief network|deep belief networks]] and deep [[Boltzmann machine|Boltzmann machines]].&lt;ref name="BENGIODEEP"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bengio|first=Yoshua|year=2009|title=Learning Deep Architectures for AI|url=http://sanghv.com/download/soft/machine%20learning,%20artificial%20intelligence,%20mathematics%20ebooks/ML/learning%20deep%20architectures%20for%20AI%20%282009%29.pdf|journal=Foundations and Trends in Machine Learning|volume=2|issue=1|pages=1–127|doi=10.1561/2200000006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In deep learning, each level learns to transform its input data into a slightly more abstract and composite representation. In an image recognition application, the raw input may be a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of pixels; the first representational layer may abstract the pixels and encode edges; the second layer may compose and encode arrangements of edges; the third layer may encode a nose and eyes; and the fourth layer may recognize that the image contains a face. Importantly, a deep learning process can learn which features to optimally place in which level ''on its own''. (Of course, this does not completely obviate the need for hand-tuning; for example, varying numbers of layers and layer sizes can provide different degrees of abstraction.)&lt;ref name="BENGIO2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Courville|first2=A.|last3=Vincent|first3=P.|year=2013|title=Representation Learning: A Review and New Perspectives|journal=IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence|volume=35|issue=8|pages=1798–1828|arxiv=1206.5538|doi=10.1109/tpami.2013.50|last1=Bengio|first1=Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=LeCun|first1=Yann|last2=Bengio|first2=Yoshua|last3=Hinton|first3=Geoffrey|title=Deep learning|journal=Nature|date=28 May 2015|volume=521|issue=7553|pages=436–444|doi=10.1038/nature14539|bibcode=2015Natur.521..436L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "deep" in "deep learning" refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed. More precisely, deep learning systems have a substantial ''credit assignment path'' (CAP) depth. The CAP is the chain of transformations from input to output. CAPs describe potentially causal connections between input and output. For a [[feedforward neural network]], the depth of the CAPs is that of the network and is the number of hidden layers plus one (as the output layer is also parameterized). For [[recurrent neural network]]s, in which a signal may propagate through a layer more than once, the CAP depth is potentially unlimited.&lt;ref name="SCHIDHUB" /&gt; No universally agreed upon threshold of depth divides shallow learning from deep learning, but most researchers agree that deep learning involves CAP depth &gt; 2. CAP of depth 2 has been shown to be a universal approximator in the sense that it can emulate any function.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Beyond that more layers do not add to the function approximator ability of the network.  Deep models (CAP &gt; 2) are able to extract better features than shallow models and hence, extra layers help in learning features.

Deep learning architectures are often constructed with a [[greedy algorithm|greedy]] layer-by-layer method.{{Clarify|date=September 2017}} {{Explain|date=September 2017}} {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Deep learning helps to disentangle these abstractions and pick out which features improve performance.&lt;ref name="BENGIO2012" /&gt;

For [[supervised learning]] tasks, deep learning methods obviate [[feature engineering]], by translating the data into compact intermediate representations akin to [[Principal Component Analysis|principal components]], and derive layered structures that remove redundancy in representation.

Deep learning algorithms can be applied to unsupervised learning tasks. This is an important benefit because unlabeled data are more abundant than labeled data. Examples of deep structures that can be trained in an unsupervised manner are neural history compressors&lt;ref name="scholarpedia"&gt;[[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] (2015). Deep Learning. Scholarpedia, 10(11):32832. [http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Deep_Learning Online]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[deep belief network]]s.&lt;ref name="BENGIO2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SCHOLARDBNS"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hinton | first1 = G.E. | year = 2009| title = Deep belief networks | url= | journal = Scholarpedia | volume = 4 | issue = 5| page = 5947 | doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.5947| bibcode = 2009SchpJ...4.5947H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The universal approximation theorem concerns the capacity of [[feedforward neural networks]] with a single hidden layer of finite size to approximate [[continuous functions]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cyb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="horn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haykin, Simon 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hassoun, M. 1995 p. 48"/&gt; In 1989, the first proof was published by [[George Cybenko]] for [[sigmoid function|sigmoid]] activation functions&lt;ref name="cyb" /&gt; and was generalised to feed-forward multi-layer architectures in 1991 by Kurt Hornik.&lt;ref name="horn" /&gt;

The [[probabilistic]] interpretation&lt;ref name="MURPHY" /&gt; derives from the field of [[machine learning]]. It features inference,&lt;ref name="BOOK2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BENGIODEEP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BENGIO2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SCHIDHUB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SCHOLARDBNS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MURPHY" /&gt; as well as the [[optimization]] concepts of [[training]] and [[test (assessment)|testing]], related to fitting and [[generalization]], respectively. More specifically, the probabilistic interpretation considers the activation nonlinearity as a [[cumulative distribution function]].&lt;ref name="MURPHY" /&gt; The probabilistic interpretation led to the introduction of [[dropout (neural networks)|dropout]] as [[Regularization (mathematics)|regularizer]] in neural networks.&lt;ref name="DROPOUT"&gt;{{cite arXiv |last1=Hinton |first1=G.

== History ==
The term ''Deep Learning'' was introduced to the machine learning community by [[Rina Dechter]] in 1986,&lt;ref name="dechter1986"&gt;[[Rina Dechter]] (1986). Learning while searching in constraint-satisfaction problems. University of California, Computer Science Department, Cognitive Systems Laboratory.[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221605378_Learning_While_Searching_in_Constraint-Satisfaction-Problems Online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scholarpedia" /&gt; and to [[Artificial Neural Networks|artificial neural networks]] by Igor Aizenberg and colleagues in 2000, in the context of Boolean threshold neurons.&lt;ref name="aizenberg2000"&gt;Igor Aizenberg, Naum N.

C., pp. 1795-1802, ACM Press, New York, NY, USA, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first general, working learning algorithm for supervised, deep, feedforward, multilayer [[perceptron]]s was published by [[Alexey Grigorevich Ivakhnenko|Alexey Ivakhnenko]] and Lapa in 1965.&lt;ref name="ivak1965"&gt;{{cite book|first=A. G. |last=Ivakhnenko|title=Cybernetic Predicting Devices|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=FhwVNQAACAAJ}}|year=1973|publisher=CCM Information Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1971 paper described a deep network with 8 layers trained by the [[group method of data handling]] algorithm.&lt;ref name="ivak1971"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ivakhnenko|first=Alexey|date=1971|title=Polynomial theory of complex systems|url=|journal=IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics |pages=364–378|doi=10.1109/TSMC.1971.4308320|pmid=|accessdate=|volume=1|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other deep learning working architectures, specifically those built for [[computer vision]], began with the [[Neocognitron]] introduced by [[Kunihiko Fukushima]] in 1980.&lt;ref name="FUKU1980"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fukushima | first1 = K. | year = 1980 | title = Neocognitron: A self-organizing neural network model for a mechanism of pattern recognition unaffected by shift in position | url= | journal = Biol.

While the algorithm worked, training required 3 days.&lt;ref name="LECUN1989"&gt;LeCun ''et al.'', "Backpropagation Applied to Handwritten Zip Code Recognition," ''Neural Computation'', 1, pp. 541–551, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1991 such systems were used for recognizing isolated 2-D hand-written digits, while recognizing 3-D objects was done by matching 2-D images with a handcrafted 3-D object model. Weng ''et al.'' suggested that a human brain does not use a monolithic 3-D object model and in 1992 they published Cresceptron,&lt;ref name="Weng1992"&gt;J. Weng, N. Ahuja and T. S. Huang, "[http://www.cse.msu.edu/~weng/research/CresceptronIJCNN1992.pdf Cresceptron: a self-organizing neural network which grows adaptively]," ''Proc. International Joint Conference on Neural Networks'', Baltimore, Maryland, vol I, pp. 576-581, June, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weng1993"&gt;J. Weng, N. Ahuja and T. S.

Huang, "[http://www.cse.msu.edu/~weng/research/CresceptronIJCV.pdf Learning recognition and segmentation using the Cresceptron]," ''International Journal of Computer Vision'', vol. 25, no. 2, pp. 105-139, Nov. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; a method for performing 3-D object recognition in cluttered scenes. Because it directly used natural images, Cresceptron started the beginning of general-purpose visual learning for natural 3D worlds.  Cresceptron is a cascade of layers similar to Neocognitron. But while Neocognitron required a human programmer to hand-merge features, Cresceptron learned an open number of features in each layer without supervision, where each feature is represented by a [[Convolution|convolution kernel]]. Cresceptron segmented each learned object from a cluttered scene through back-analysis through the network. [[Max pooling]], now often adopted by deep neural networks (e.g. [[ImageNet]] tests), was first used in Cresceptron to reduce the position resolution by a factor of (2x2) to 1 through the cascade for better generalization.

In 1994, André de Carvalho, together with Mike Fairhurst and David Bisset, published experimental results of a multi-layer [[Boolean algebra|boolean]] neural network, also known as a weightless neural network, composed of a 3-layers self-organising feature extraction neural network module (SOFT) followed by a multi-layer classification neural network module (GSN), which were independently trained. Each layer in the feature extraction module extracted features with growing complexity regarding the previous layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=An integrated Boolean neural network for pattern classification |journal=Pattern Recognition Letters |date=1994-08-08 |pages=807–813 |volume=15 |issue=8 |doi=10.1016/0167-8655(94)90009-4 |first=Andre C.

In 1995, [[Brendan Frey]] demonstrated that it was possible to train (over two days) a network containing six fully connected layers and several hundred hidden units using the [[wake-sleep algorithm]], co-developed with [[Peter Dayan]] and [[Geoffrey Hinton|Hinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The wake-sleep algorithm for unsupervised neural networks |journal = Science|date = 1995-05-26|pages = 1158–1161|volume = 268|issue = 5214|doi = 10.1126/science.7761831|first = Geoffrey E.|last = Hinton|first2 = Peter|last2 = Dayan|first3 = Brendan J.|last3 = Frey|first4 = Radford|last4 = Neal|bibcode = 1995Sci...268.1158H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many factors contribute to the slow speed, including the [[vanishing gradient problem]] analyzed in 1991 by [[Sepp Hochreiter]].&lt;ref name="HOCH1991"&gt;S. Hochreiter., "[http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/SeppHochreiter1991ThesisAdvisorSchmidhuber.pdf Untersuchungen zu dynamischen neuronalen Netzen]," ''Diploma thesis. Institut f.

Simpler models that use task-specific handcrafted features such as [[Gabor filter]]s and [[support vector machine]]s (SVMs) were a popular choice in the 1990s and 2000s, because of ANNs' computational cost and a lack of understanding of how the brain wires its biological networks.

Both shallow and deep learning (e.g., recurrent nets) of ANNs have been explored for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morgan|first=Nelson|last2=Bourlard |first2=Hervé |last3=Renals |first3=Steve |last4=Cohen |first4=Michael|last5=Franco |first5=Horacio |date=1993-08-01 |title=Hybrid neural network/hidden markov model systems for continuous speech recognition |url=http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218001493000455|journal=International Journal of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence|volume=07|issue=4|pages=899–916|doi=10.1142/s0218001493000455|issn=0218-0014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson1992"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=T.|date=1992|title=A real-time recurrent error propagation network word recognition system|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1895720|journal=ICASSP|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waibel|first=A.|last2=Hanazawa|first2=T.|last3=Hinton|first3=G.|last4=Shikano|first4=K.|last5=Lang|first5=K.

Most [[speech recognition]] researchers moved away from neural nets to pursue generative modeling. An exception was at [[SRI International]] in the late 1990s. Funded by the US government's [[National Security Agency|NSA]] and [[DARPA]], SRI studied deep neural networks in speech and speaker recognition. Heck's speaker recognition team achieved the first significant success with deep neural networks in speech processing in the 1998 [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] Speaker Recognition evaluation.&lt;ref name="Heck2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heck | first1 = L. | last2 = Konig | first2 = Y. | last3 = Sonmez | first3 = M. | last4 = Weintraub | first4 = M. | year = 2000 | title = Robustness to Telephone Handset Distortion in Speaker Recognition by Discriminative Feature Design | url= | journal = Speech Communication | volume = 31 | issue = 2| pages = 181–192 | doi=10.1016/s0167-6393(99)00077-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; While SRI experienced success with deep neural networks in speaker recognition, they were unsuccessful in demonstrating similar success in speech recognition. 
The principle of elevating "raw" features over hand-crafted optimization was first explored successfully in the architecture of deep autoencoder on the "raw" spectrogram or linear filter-bank features in the late 1990s,&lt;ref name="Heck2000" /&gt; showing its superiority over the Mel-Cepstral features that contain stages of fixed transformation from spectrograms. The raw features of speech, [[waveform]]s, later produced excellent larger-scale results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266030526_Acoustic_Modeling_with_Deep_Neural_Networks_Using_Raw_Time_Signal_for_LVCSR|title=Acoustic Modeling with Deep Neural Networks Using Raw Time Signal for LVCSR (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|accessdate=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many aspects of speech recognition were taken over by a deep learning method called [[long short-term memory]] (LSTM), a recurrent neural network published by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber in 1997.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hochreiter|first=Sepp|author-link=Sepp Hochreiter|last2=Schmidhuber|first2=Jürgen|author-link2=Jürgen Schmidhuber|date=1997-11-01|title=Long Short-Term Memory|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735|journal=Neural Computation|volume=9|issue=8|pages=1735–1780|doi=10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735|issn=0899-7667|via=|pmid=9377276}}&lt;/ref&gt; LSTM RNNs avoid the vanishing gradient problem and can learn "Very Deep Learning" tasks&lt;ref name="SCHIDHUB" /&gt; that require memories of events that happened thousands of discrete time steps before, which is important for speech.

The impact of deep learning in industry began in the early 2000s, when CNNs already processed an estimated 10% to 20% of all the checks written in the US, according to Yann LeCun.&lt;ref name="lecun2016slides"&gt;[[Yann LeCun]] (2016). Slides on Deep Learning [https://indico.cern.ch/event/510372/ Online]&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial applications of deep learning to large-scale speech recognition started around 2010.

The 2009 NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning for Speech Recognition&lt;ref name="NIPS2009" /&gt; was motivated by the limitations of deep generative models of speech, and the possibility that given more capable hardware and large-scale data sets that deep neural nets (DNN) might become practical. It was believed that pre-training DNNs using generative models of deep belief nets (DBN) would overcome the main difficulties of neural nets.&lt;ref name="HintonKeynoteICASSP2013" /&gt; However, it was discovered that replacing pre-training with large amounts of training data for straightforward backpropagation when using DNNs with large, context-dependent output layers produced error rates dramatically lower than then-state-of-the-art Gaussian mixture model (GMM)/Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and also than more-advanced generative model-based systems.&lt;ref name="HintonDengYu2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hinton | first1 = G. | last2 = Deng | first2 = L. | last3 = Yu | first3 = D. | last4 = Dahl | first4 = G. | last5 = Mohamed | first5 = A. | last6 = Jaitly | first6 = N. | last7 = Senior | first7 = A. | last8 = Vanhoucke | first8 = V. | last9 = Nguyen | first9 = P. | last10 = Sainath | first10 = T. | last11 = Kingsbury | first11 = B. | year = 2012 | title = Deep Neural Networks for Acoustic Modeling in Speech Recognition --- The shared views of four research groups | url= | journal = IEEE Signal Processing Magazine | volume = 29 | issue = 6| pages = 82–97 | doi=10.1109/msp.2012.2205597}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="patent2011"&gt;D.

In 2010, researchers extended deep learning from TIMIT to large vocabulary speech recognition, by adopting large output layers of the DNN based on context-dependent HMM states constructed by [[decision tree]]s.&lt;ref name="Roles2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yu|first1=D.|last2=Deng|first2=L.|date=2010|title=Roles of Pre-Training and Fine-Tuning in Context-Dependent DBN-HMMs for Real-World Speech Recognition|url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/roles-of-pre-training-and-fine-tuning-in-context-dependent-dbn-hmms-for-real-world-speech-recognition/|journal=NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seide|first=F.|last2=Li|first2=G.|last3=Yu|first3=D.|date=2011|title=Conversational speech transcription using context-dependent deep neural networks|url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/conversational-speech-transcription-using-context-dependent-deep-neural-networks|journal=Interspeech|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deng|first=Li|last2=Li|first2=Jinyu|last3=Huang|first3=Jui-Ting|last4=Yao|first4=Kaisheng|last5=Yu|first5=Dong|last6=Seide|first6=Frank|last7=Seltzer|first7=Mike|last8=Zweig|first8=Geoff|last9=He|first9=Xiaodong|date=2013-05-01|title=Recent Advances in Deep Learning for Speech Research at Microsoft|url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/recent-advances-in-deep-learning-for-speech-research-at-microsoft/|journal=Microsoft Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Advances in hardware enabled the renewed interest. In 2009, [[Nvidia]] was involved in what was called the “big bang” of deep learning, “as deep-learning neural networks were trained with Nvidia [[graphics processing unit]]s (GPUs).”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/04/05/nvidia-ceo-bets-big-on-deep-learning-and-vr/|title=Nvidia CEO bets big on deep learning and VR|date=April 5, 2016|publisher=''[[Venture Beat]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, [[Google Brain]] used Nvidia GPUs to create capable DNNs.

=== Deep learning revolution ===

Significant additional impacts in image or object recognition were felt from 2011 to 2012. Although CNNs trained by backpropagation had been around for decades, and GPU implementations of NNs for years, including CNNs, fast implementations of CNNs with max-pooling on GPUs in the style of Ciresan and colleagues were needed to progress on computer vision.&lt;ref name="jung2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chellapilla2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LECUN1989" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ciresan|first=D.

In October 2012, a similar system by Krizhevsky et al.&lt;ref name="krizhevsky2012" /&gt; won the large-scale [[ImageNet competition]] by a significant margin over shallow machine learning methods.

=== Artificial neural networks ===
{{Main|Artificial neural network}}
'''Artificial neural networks''' ('''ANNs''') or '''[[Connectionism|connectionist]] systems''' are computing systems inspired by the [[biological neural network]]s that constitute animal brains. Such systems learn (progressively improve their ability) to do tasks by considering examples, generally without task-specific programming. For example, in image recognition, they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually [[Labeled data|labeled]] as "cat" or "no cat" and using the analytic results to identify cats in other images. They have found most use in applications difficult to express with a traditional computer algorithm using [[rule-based programming]].

An ANN is based on a collection of connected units called [[artificial neuron]]s, (analogous to biological neurons in a [[Brain|biological brain]]). Each connection ([[synapse]]) between neurons can transmit a signal to another neuron. The receiving (postsynaptic) neuron can process the signal(s) and then signal downstream neurons connected to it. Neurons may have state, generally represented by [[real numbers]], typically between 0 and 1. Neurons and synapses may also have a weight that varies as learning proceeds, which can increase or decrease the strength of the signal that it sends downstream.

Typically, neurons are organized in layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first (input), to the last (output) layer, possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.

The original goal of the neural network approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. Over time, attention focused on matching specific mental abilities, leading to deviations from biology such as backpropagation, or passing information in the reverse direction and adjusting the network to reflect that information.

Neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, [[speech recognition]], [[machine translation]], [[social network]] filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis.

As of 2017, neural networks typically have a few thousand to a few million units and millions of connections. Despite this number being several order of magnitude less than the number of neurons on a human brain, these networks can perform many tasks at a level beyond that of humans (e.g., recognizing faces, playing "Go"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Silver|first=David|last2=Huang|first2=Aja|last3=Maddison|first3=Chris J.|last4=Guez|first4=Arthur|last5=Sifre|first5=Laurent|last6=Driessche|first6=George van den|last7=Schrittwieser|first7=Julian|last8=Antonoglou|first8=Ioannis|last9=Panneershelvam|first9=Veda|date=January 2016|title=Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16961|journal=Nature|volume=529|issue=7587|pages=484–489|doi=10.1038/nature16961|issn=1476-4687|pmid=26819042|bibcode=2016Natur.529..484S}}&lt;/ref&gt; ).

=== Deep neural networks ===
{{technical|section|date=July 2016}}
A deep neural network (DNN) is an [[artificial neural network]] (ANN) with multiple layers between the input and output layers.&lt;ref name="BENGIODEEP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SCHIDHUB" /&gt; The DNN finds the correct mathematical manipulation to turn the input into the output, whether it be a [[linear relationship]] or a non-linear relationship. The network moves through the layers calculating the probability of each output. For example, a DNN that is trained to recognize dog breeds will go over the given image and calculate the probability that the dog in the image is a certain breed. The user can review the results and select which probabilities the network should display (above a certain threshold, etc.) and return the proposed label. Each mathematical manipulation as such is considered a layer, and complex DNN have many layers, hence the name "deep" networks. The goal is that eventually, the network will be trained to decompose an image into [[Feature (machine learning)|features]], identify trends that exist across all samples and classify new images by their similarities without requiring human input.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/neural-network|title=How Does a Neural Network Work?|last=|first=|date=|website=deepai.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNNs can model complex non-linear relationships. DNN architectures generate compositional models where the object is expressed as a layered composition of [[Primitive data type|primitives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Szegedy|first=Christian|last2=Toshev|first2=Alexander|last3=Erhan|first3=Dumitru|date=2013|title=Deep neural networks for object detection|url=https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5207-deep-neural-networks-for-object-detection|journal=Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extra layers enable composition of features from lower layers, potentially modeling complex data with fewer units than a similarly performing shallow network.&lt;ref name="BENGIODEEP" /&gt;

Deep architectures include many variants of a few basic approaches. Each architecture has found success in specific domains. It is not always possible to compare the performance of multiple architectures, unless they have been evaluated on the same data sets.

DNNs are typically feedforward networks in which data flows from the input layer to the output layer without looping back. At first, the DNN creates a map of virtual neurons and assigns random numerical values, or "weights", to connections between them. The weights and inputs are multiplied and return an output between 0 and 1. If the network didn’t accurately recognize a particular pattern, an algorithm would adjust the weights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/513696/deep-learning/|title=Is Artificial Intelligence Finally Coming into Its Own?|last=Hof|first=Robert D.|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; That way the algorithm can make certain parameters more influential, until it determines the correct mathematical manipulation to fully process the data.

==== Challenges ====
As with ANNs, many issues can arise with naively trained DNNs. Two common issues are [[overfitting]] and computation time.

DNNs are prone to overfitting because of the added layers of abstraction, which allow them to model rare dependencies in the training data. [[Regularization (mathematics)|Regularization]] methods such as Ivakhnenko's unit pruning&lt;ref name="ivak1971"/&gt; or [[weight decay]] (&lt;math&gt; \ell_2 &lt;/math&gt;-regularization) or [[sparse matrix|sparsity]] (&lt;math&gt; \ell_1 &lt;/math&gt;-regularization) can be applied during training to combat overfitting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bengio|first=Y.|last2=Boulanger-Lewandowski|first2=N.|last3=Pascanu|first3=R.|date=May 2013|title=Advances in optimizing recurrent networks|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6639349/|journal=2013 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing|pages=8624–8628|doi=10.1109/icassp.2013.6639349|isbn=978-1-4799-0356-6|arxiv=1212.0901}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively dropout regularization randomly omits units from the hidden layers during training.

DNNs must consider many training parameters, such as the size (number of layers and number of units per layer), the learning rate, and initial weights. [[Hyperparameter optimization#Grid search|Sweeping through the parameter space]] for optimal parameters may not be feasible due to the cost in time and computational resources. Various tricks, such as batching (computing the gradient on several training examples at once rather than individual examples)&lt;ref name="RBMTRAIN"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hinton|first=G.

Alternatively, engineers may look for other types of neural networks with more straightforward and convergent training algorithms. CMAC ([[cerebellar model articulation controller]]) is one such kind of neural network. It doesn't require learning rates or randomized initial weights for CMAC. The training process can be guaranteed to converge in one step with a new batch of data, and the computational complexity of the training algorithm is linear with respect to the number of neurons involved.&lt;ref name=Qin1&gt;Ting Qin, et al.

=== Automatic speech recognition ===
{{Main|Speech recognition}}

Large-scale automatic speech recognition is the first and most convincing successful case of deep learning. LSTM RNNs can learn "Very Deep Learning" tasks&lt;ref name="SCHIDHUB"/&gt; that involve multi-second intervals containing speech events separated by thousands of discrete time steps, where one time step corresponds to about 10 ms. LSTM with forget gates&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; is competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks.&lt;ref name="graves2003"/&gt;

The initial success in speech recognition was based on small-scale recognition tasks based on TIMIT. The data set contains 630 speakers from eight major [[dialect]]s of [[American English]], where each speaker reads 10 sentences.&lt;ref name="LDCTIMIT"&gt;''TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus'' Linguistic Data Consortium, Philadelphia.&lt;/ref&gt; Its small size lets many configurations be tried. More importantly, the TIMIT task concerns phone-sequence recognition, which, unlike word-sequence recognition, allows weak phone [[bigram]] language models.  This lets the strength of the acoustic modeling aspects of speech recognition be more easily analyzed. The error rates listed below, including these early results and measured as percent phone error rates (PER), have been summarized since 1991.

The debut of DNNs for speaker recognition in the late 1990s and speech recognition around 2009-2011 and of LSTM around 2003-2007, accelerated progress in eight major areas:&lt;ref name="BOOK2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="interspeech2014Keynote" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

* Scale-up/out and acclerated DNN training and decoding 
* Sequence discriminative training 
* Feature processing by deep models with solid understanding of the underlying mechanisms 
* Adaptation of DNNs and related deep models 
* [[Multi-task learning|Multi-task]] and [[Inductive transfer|transfer learning]] by DNNs and related deep models 
* CNNs and how to design them to best exploit [[domain knowledge]] of speech 
* RNN and its rich LSTM variants 
* Other types of deep models including tensor-based models and integrated deep generative/discriminative models.

All major commercial speech recognition systems (e.g., Microsoft [[Cortana (software)|Cortana]], [[Xbox]], [[Skype Translator]], [[Amazon Alexa]], [[Google Now]], [[Siri|Apple Siri]], [[Baidu]] and [[IFlytek|iFlyTek]] voice search, and a range of [[Nuance Communications|Nuance]] speech products, etc.) are based on deep learning.&lt;ref name=BOOK2014 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/12/skype-used-ai-build-amazing-new-language-translator/|title=How Skype Used AI to Build Its Amazing New Language Translator {{!}} WIRED|website=www.wired.com|accessdate=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baidu"&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=1412.5567|last1=Hannun|first1=Awni|title=Deep Speech: Scaling up end-to-end speech recognition|last2=Case|first2=Carl|last3=Casper|first3=Jared|last4=Catanzaro|first4=Bryan|last5=Diamos|first5=Greg|last6=Elsen|first6=Erich|last7=Prenger|first7=Ryan|last8=Satheesh|first8=Sanjeev|last9=Sengupta|first9=Shubho|last10=Coates|first10=Adam|last11=Ng|first11=Andrew Y|class=cs.CL|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-US/people/deng/ieee-icassp-plenary-2016-mar24-lideng-posted.pdf|title=Plenary presentation at ICASSP-2016|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Image recognition ===
{{Main|Computer vision}}

A common evaluation set for image classification is the MNIST database data set. MNIST is composed of handwritten digits and includes 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples. As with TIMIT, its small size lets users test multiple configurations. A comprehensive list of results on this set is available.&lt;ref name="YANNMNIST"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.|title=MNIST handwritten digit database, Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes and Chris Burges|website=yann.lecun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deep learning-based image recognition has become "superhuman", producing more accurate results than human contestants. This first occurred in 2011.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cireşan|first=Dan|last2=Meier|first2=Ueli|last3=Masci|first3=Jonathan|last4=Schmidhuber|first4=Jürgen|date=August 2012|title=Multi-column deep neural network for traffic sign classification|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608012000524|journal=Neural Networks|series=Selected Papers from IJCNN 2011|volume=32|pages=333–338|doi=10.1016/j.neunet.2012.02.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deep learning-trained vehicles now interpret 360° camera views.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/news/533936/nvidia-demos-a-car-computer-trained-with-deep-learning/ Nvidia Demos a Car Computer Trained with "Deep Learning"] (2015-01-06), David Talbot, ''[[MIT Technology Review]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is Facial Dysmorphology Novel Analysis (FDNA) used to analyze cases of human malformation connected to a large database of genetic syndromes.

=== Visual art processing ===
Closely related to the progress that has been made in image recognition is the increasing application of deep learning techniques to various visual art tasks.  DNNs have proven themselves capable, for example, of a) identifying the style period of a given painting, b) "capturing" the style of a given painting and applying it in a visually pleasing manner to an arbitrary photograph, and c) generating striking imagery based on random visual input fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mdpi.com/2076-0752/6/2/5|author1=G.

=== Natural language processing ===

Neural networks have been used for implementing language models since the early 2000s.&lt;ref name="gers2001" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bengio|first=Yoshua|last2=Ducharme|first2=Réjean|last3=Vincent|first3=Pascal|last4=Janvin|first4=Christian|date=March 2003|title=A Neural Probabilistic Language Model|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=944919.944966|journal=J.

Word embedding, such as ''[[word2vec]]'', can be thought of as a representational layer in a deep learning architecture that transforms an atomic word into a positional representation of the word relative to other words in the dataset; the position is represented as a point in a [[vector space]]. Using word embedding as an RNN input layer allows the network to parse sentences and phrases using an effective compositional vector grammar. A compositional vector grammar can be thought of as [[probabilistic context free grammar]] (PCFG) implemented by an RNN.&lt;ref name="SocherManning2014"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Socher|first1=Richard|last2=Manning|first2=Christopher|title=Deep Learning for NLP|url=http://nlp.stanford.edu/courses/NAACL2013/NAACL2013-Socher-Manning-DeepLearning.pdf|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recursive auto-encoders built atop word embeddings can assess sentence similarity and detect paraphrasing.&lt;ref name="SocherManning2014" /&gt; Deep neural architectures provide the best results for [[Statistical parsing|constituency parsing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url= http://aclweb.org/anthology/P/P13/P13-1045.pdf|title = Parsing With Compositional Vector Grammars|last = Socher|first = Richard|date = 2013|journal = Proceedings of the ACL 2013 conference|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = |last2 = Bauer|first2 = John|last3 = Manning|first3 = Christopher|last4 = Ng|first4 = Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[sentiment analysis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite paper |url= http://nlp.stanford.edu/~socherr/EMNLP2013_RNTN.pdf|title = Recursive Deep Models for Semantic Compositionality Over a Sentiment Treebank|last = Socher|first = Richard|date = 2013 |accessdate = |doi = |pmid =}}&lt;/ref&gt; information retrieval,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shen|first=Yelong|last2=He|first2=Xiaodong|last3=Gao|first3=Jianfeng|last4=Deng|first4=Li|last5=Mesnil|first5=Gregoire|date=2014-11-01|title=A Latent Semantic Model with Convolutional-Pooling Structure for Information Retrieval|url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/a-latent-semantic-model-with-convolutional-pooling-structure-for-information-retrieval/|journal=Microsoft Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=Po-Sen|last2=He|first2=Xiaodong|last3=Gao|first3=Jianfeng|last4=Deng|first4=Li|last5=Acero|first5=Alex|last6=Heck|first6=Larry|date=2013-10-01|title=Learning Deep Structured Semantic Models for Web Search using Clickthrough Data|url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/learning-deep-structured-semantic-models-for-web-search-using-clickthrough-data/|journal=Microsoft Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; spoken language understanding,&lt;ref name="IEEE-TASL2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mesnil | first1 = G. | last2 = Dauphin | first2 = Y. | last3 = Yao | first3 = K. | last4 = Bengio | first4 = Y. | last5 = Deng | first5 = L. | last6 = Hakkani-Tur | first6 = D. | last7 = He | first7 = X. | last8 = Heck | first8 = L. | last9 = Tur | first9 = G. | last10 = Yu | first10 = D. | last11 = Zweig | first11 = G. | year = 2015 | title = Using recurrent neural networks for slot filling in spoken language understanding | url= | journal = IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 530–539 | doi=10.1109/taslp.2014.2383614}}&lt;/ref&gt; machine translation,&lt;ref name="NIPS2014"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sutskever|first=L.|last2=Vinyals|first2=O.|last3=Le|first3=Q.|date=2014|title=Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks|url=https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5346-sequence-to-sequence-learning-with-neural-networks.pdf|journal=Proc.

== Relation to human cognitive and brain development ==
Deep learning is closely related to a class of theories of [[brain development]] (specifically, neocortical development) proposed by [[cognitive neuroscientist]]s in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="UTGOFF"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Utgoff | first1 = P.

These developmental models share the property that various proposed learning dynamics in the brain (e.g., a wave of [[nerve growth factor]]) support the [[self-organization]] somewhat analogous to the neural networks utilized in deep learning models. Like the [[neocortex]], neural networks employ a hierarchy of layered filters in which each layer considers information from a prior layer (or the operating environment), and then passes its output (and possibly the original input), to other layers. This process yields a self-organizing stack of [[transducer]]s, well-tuned to their operating environment. A 1995 description stated, "...the infant's brain seems to organize itself under the influence of waves of so-called trophic-factors ... different regions of the brain become connected sequentially, with one layer of tissue maturing before another and so on until the whole brain is mature."&lt;ref name="BLAKESLEE"&gt;S. Blakeslee., "In brain's early growth, timetable may be critical," ''The New York Times, Science Section'', pp. B5–B6, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of approaches have been used to investigate the plausibility of deep learning models from a neurobiological perspective. On the one hand, several variants of the [[backpropagation]] algorithm have been proposed in order to increase its processing realism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mazzoni|first=P.|last2=Andersen|first2=R.

As of 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4640845/|title=TAMER: Training an Agent Manually via Evaluative Reinforcement - IEEE Conference Publication|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; researchers at [[University of Texas at Austin|The University of Texas at Austin]] (UT) developed a machine learning framework called Training an Agent Manually via Evaluative Reinforcement, or TAMER, which proposed new methods for robots or computer programs to learn how to perform tasks by interacting with a human instructor.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

First developed as TAMER, a new algorithm called Deep TAMER was later introduced in 2018 during a collaboration between [[U.S. Army Research Laboratory]] (ARL) and UT researchers. Deep TAMER used deep learning to provide a robot the ability to learn new tasks through observation.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Using Deep TAMER, a robot learned a task with a human trainer, watching video streams or observing a human perform a task in-person. The robot later practiced the task with the help of some coaching from the trainer, who provided feedback such as “good job” and “bad job.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://governmentciomedia.com/talk-algorithms-ai-becomes-faster-learner|title=Talk to the Algorithms: AI Becomes a Faster Learner|website=governmentciomedia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism and comment ==
Deep learning has attracted both criticism and comment, in some cases from outside the field of computer science.

=== Theory ===
{{see also|Explainable AI}}
A main criticism concerns the lack of theory surrounding some methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@GaryMarcus/in-defense-of-skepticism-about-deep-learning-6e8bfd5ae0f1|title=In defense of skepticism about deep learning|last=Marcus|first=Gary|date=2018-01-14|website=Gary Marcus|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning in the most common deep architectures is implemented using well-understood gradient descent. However, the theory surrounding other algorithms, such as contrastive divergence is less clear.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} (e.g., Does it converge? If so, how fast? What is it approximating?) Deep learning methods are often looked at as a [[black box]], with most confirmations done empirically, rather than theoretically.&lt;ref name="Knight 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Knight | first=Will | title=DARPA is funding projects that will try to open up AI’s black boxes | website=MIT Technology Review | date=2017-03-14 | url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603795/the-us-military-wants-its-autonomous-machines-to-explain-themselves/ | accessdate=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others point out that deep learning should be looked at as a step towards realizing strong AI, not as an all-encompassing solution. Despite the power of deep learning methods, they still lack much of the functionality needed for realizing this goal entirely. Research psychologist [[Gary Marcus]] noted:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Realistically, deep learning is only part of the larger challenge of building intelligent machines. Such techniques lack ways of representing [[causality|causal relationships]] (...) have no obvious ways of performing [[inference|logical inferences]], and they are also still a long way from integrating abstract knowledge, such as information about what objects are, what they are for, and how they are typically used. The most powerful A.I. systems, like [[Watson (computer)|Watson]] (...) use techniques like deep learning as just one element in a very complicated ensemble of techniques, ranging from the statistical technique of [[Bayesian inference]] to [[deductive reasoning]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/|title=Is "Deep Learning" a Revolution in Artificial Intelligence?|last=Marcus|first=Gary|date=November 25, 2012|website=|publisher=The New Yorker|accessdate=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;As an alternative to this emphasis on the limits of deep learning, one author speculated that it might be possible to train a machine vision stack to perform the sophisticated task of discriminating between "old master" and amateur figure drawings, and hypothesized that such a sensitivity might represent the rudiments of a non-trivial machine empathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artent.net/2015/03/27/art-and-artificial-intelligence-by-g-w-smith/|title=Art and Artificial Intelligence|date=March 27, 2015|publisher=ArtEnt|author=Smith, G.

=== Cyberthreat ===
As deep learning moves from the lab into the world, research and experience shows that artificial neural networks are vulnerable to hacks and deception. By identifying patterns that these systems use to function, attackers can modify inputs to ANNs in such a way that the ANN finds a match that human observers would not recognize. For example, an attacker can make subtle changes to an image such that the ANN finds a match even though the image looks to a human nothing like the search target. Such a manipulation is termed an “adversarial attack.” In 2016 researchers used one ANN to doctor images in trial and error fashion, identify another's focal points and thereby generate images that deceived it. The modified images looked no different to human eyes. Another group showed that printouts of doctored images then photographed successfully tricked an image classification system.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://singularityhub.com/2017/10/10/ai-is-easy-to-fool-why-that-needs-to-change|title=AI Is Easy to Fool—Why That Needs to Change|last=|first=|date=2017-10-10|work=Singularity Hub|accessdate=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; One defense is reverse image search, in which a possible fake image is submitted to a site such as [[TinEye]] that can then find other instances of it. A refinement is to search using only parts of the image, to identify images from which that piece may have been taken'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gibney|first=Elizabeth|date=|title=The scientist who spots fake videos|url=https://www.nature.com/news/the-scientist-who-spots-fake-videos-1.22784|journal=Nature|pages=|doi=10.1038/nature.2017.22784|via=|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another group showed that certain [[Psychedelic art|psychedelic]] spectacles could fool a [[facial recognition system]] into thinking ordinary people were celebrities, potentially allowing one person to impersonate another. In 2017 researchers added stickers to [[stop sign]]s and caused an ANN to misclassify them.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

ANNs can however be further trained to detect attempts at deception, potentially leading attackers and defenders into an arms race similar to the kind that already defines the [[malware]] defense industry. ANNs have been trained to defeat ANN-based anti-malware software by repeatedly attacking a defense with malware that was continually altered by a [[genetic algorithm]] until it tricked the anti-malware while retaining its ability to damage the target.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Another group demonstrated that certain sounds could make the [[Google Now]] voice command system open a particular web address that would download malware.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In “data poisoning”, false data is continually smuggled into a machine learning system’s training set to prevent it from achieving mastery.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The '''dinosaur renaissance'''&lt;ref&gt;The term has entered into common usage after an article of the same name by paleontologist [[Robert T. Bakker]] in ''Scientific American'', in April 1975. Examples can be found [http://www.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=11282 here]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927205753/http://www.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=11282 |date=2007-09-27 }} and [https://web.archive.org/web/20060110100858/http://www.geotimes.org/jan06/feature_threedinofaces.html here].&lt;/ref&gt; was a small-scale [[paradigm shift|scientific revolution]] that started in the late 1960s, and led to renewed academic and popular interest in [[dinosaur]]s. It was sparked by new discoveries and research indicating that dinosaurs may have been active and [[warm-blooded]] animals, rather than [[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]] and sluggish as had been the prevailing view and description during the first half of the twentieth century.

The new view of dinosaurs was championed by [[John Ostrom]], who argued that birds evolved from [[coelurosaur]]ian dinosaurs,&lt;ref name="ostrom1974"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ostrom |first1= J. |year=1974 |title=''Archaeopteryx'' and the Origin of Flight |journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology |volume= 49 |issue= 1 | pages=27–47 | jstor=2821658 |doi=10.1086/407902 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and particularly [[Robert Bakker]] who argued passionately that dinosaurs were [[Physiology of dinosaurs|warm-blooded]] in a way similar to modern [[mammal]]s and [[bird]]s.&lt;ref name="Dinosaur Heresies"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bakker |first1= R.T. |year=1986 |title=[[The Dinosaur Heresies]] |publisher= William Morrow |location= New York |isbn=0-8217-5608-7 | oclc=36439291 |authorlink=Robert T. Bakker}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakker frequently portrayed his ideas as a renaissance of those popular in the late nineteenth century, referring to the period in between the [[Dinosaur Wars]] and the dinosaur renaissance as "the dinosaur [[doldrums]]".&lt;ref name="Dinosaur Heresies" /&gt;

The dinosaur renaissance led to a profound shift in thinking on nearly all aspects of dinosaur biology, including [[physiology]], [[evolution]], [[behaviour]], [[ecology]] and [[extinction]]. It also led to many depictions of [[cultural depictions of dinosaurs|dinosaurs in popular culture]].

== Dinosaurs and the origin of birds ==

{{details|Origin of birds}}

In the mid and latter parts of the nineteenth century, many scientists thought there was a close relationship between birds and dinosaurs—and that dinosaurs represented an intermediate stage between "[[reptiles]]" and birds.

Shortly after the 1859 publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[The Origin of Species]]'', British biologist and evolution-defender [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] proposed that birds were descendants of dinosaurs. He cited skeletal similarities, particularly among dinosaurs, the "first bird"—''[[Archaeopteryx]]''—and modern birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Huxley|first= T.H.  |authorlink=Thomas Henry Huxley |year=1868|title= On the animals which are most nearly intermediate between birds and reptiles |journal=Annals and Magazine of Natural History |volume=2 |pages=66–75 |series=4th |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/22247928}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Huxley |first1= T. H. |year= 1870 |title= Further Evidence of the Affinity between the Dinosaurian Reptiles and Birds |journal=Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society|volume= 26 | issue=1–2 |pages= 12–31 | doi = 10.1144/GSL.JGS.1870.026.01-02.08 |url= http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/SM3/Dino-boid.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Archaeo-deinony hands.svg|thumb|right|240px|The similarity of the hands of ''[[Deinonychus]]'' (left) and ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' (right) led [[John Ostrom]] to revive the link between dinosaurs and birds.]]However, in 1926, [[Gerhard Heilmann]] wrote his influential book ''[[The Origin of Birds (book)|The Origin of Birds]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Heilmann, G. 1926: ''The Origin of Birds''. Witherby, London. {{ISBN|0-486-22784-7}} (1972 Dover reprint)&lt;/ref&gt; in which he dismissed the dinosaur–bird link, based on the dinosaurs' supposed lack of a [[furcula]].&lt;ref&gt;An assumption which is now known to have been incorrect.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the accepted hypothesis was that birds evolved from [[Crocodylomorpha|crocodylomorph]] and [[Thecodontia|thecodont]] ancestors, rather than from dinosaurs. This removed dinosaurs from a central role in debates about the origin of living species, and may have contributed to the decline of academic interest in dinosaur evolution.

This situation persisted until 1964, when John Ostrom discovered a small carnivorous dinosaur which he named ''[[Deinonychus|Deinonychus antirrhopus]]'',&lt;ref name="ostrom1969"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Ostrom |first1= J. H. |year=1969| title = Osteology of ''Deinonychus antirrhopus'', an unusual theropod from the Lower Cretaceous of Montana |journal=Peabody Museum of Natural History Bulletin |volume=30 |pages= 1–165 |url=http://peabody.yale.edu/scipubs/bulletins_postillas/ypmB30_1969.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[theropod]] whose skeletal resemblance to birds seemed unmistakable. This led Ostrom to argue that Huxley had been right, and that birds had indeed evolved from dinosaurs.&lt;ref name="ostrom1974" /&gt; Although it was ''Deinonychus'' that inspired Ostrom to connect birds with dinosaurs, very similar birdlike dinosaurs, such as ''[[Velociraptor]]'', had been known for many decades,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Osborn |first1= H.F. |year=1924 |title=Three new Theropoda, Protoceratops zone, central Mongolia |journal=American Museum Novitates |volume= 144 |pages= 1–12 |hdl=2246/3223 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but no connection had been made. After Ostrom's discoveries, the idea that birds evolved from dinosaurs gained support among palaeontologists, and today it is almost universally accepted. Newer methods, such as [[cladistics]], and the discovery of several [[feathered dinosaurs]] have helped confirm the relationship.

The relationship between dinosaurs and birds has led to considerable interest in dinosaur—particularly [[theropod]]—[[phylogeny]], which is now far better understood.

== Dinosaur monophyly ==

Initially, dinosaurs were thought to be a [[monophyletic]] group, comprising animals with a common ancestor not shared by other reptiles.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} However, [[Harry Seeley]] disagreed with this interpretation, and split the Dinosauria into two orders, the [[Saurischia]] ("lizard-hipped") and the [[Ornithischia]] ("bird-hipped"), which were seen as members of the [[Archosauria]] with no special relationship to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Seeley |first1=H.G. |year=1887 |title= On the classification of the fossil animals commonly named Dinosauria |journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society |volume= 43 |pages= 165–171 | bibcode = 1887RSPS...43..165S | doi = 10.1098/rspl.1887.0117  | issue=258–265 | jstor=114526 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seeley | first1 = H.G. | year = 1888 | title = The classification of the Dinosauria | url = | journal = Rep Br Assoc Adv Sci | volume = 1887 | issue = | pages = 698–699 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the Dinosauria was no longer seen as a scientific grouping, and "dinosaur" was reduced to being a popular term, without scientific meaning. This became the standard interpretation throughout much of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Romer A.S. 1956. ''Osteology of the Reptiles. Chicago: University Chicago. 772 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

This changed in 1974, when Bakker and [[Peter Galton]] published a paper in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', arguing that not only were dinosaurs a natural monophyletic group, but that they should be raised to the status of a new [[class (biology)|class]], which would also contain birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pages=168–172 | year=1974 | volume=248 | last1=Bakker | doi = 10.1038/248168a0 | journal=Nature |bibcode=1974Natur.248..168B | first1=Robert T. | last2=Galton | first2=Peter M. | title=Dinosaur Monophyly and a New Class of Vertebrates | issue=5444}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although initially this revival of dinosaur monophyly was controversial,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Charig |first1=A. |year=1976 |chapter= Dinosaur monophyly and a new class of vertebrates: a critical review. |editor1-last= Bellairs |editor1-first=AA |editor2-last =Cox |editor2-first=B |title=Morphology and Biology of Reptiles. Linnean Society Symposium| volume=3|pages= 65–104 | isbn = 0-12-085850-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the idea did gain acceptance, and since the rise of [[cladistic]] methodology, it has been nearly universally supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/02724634.1996.10011361 |last1=Novas |first1= F.E. |year=1996 |title= Dinosaur monophyly |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume= 16 |pages= 723–741 |jstor=4523770 |issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The raising of the Dinosauria to class rank found less support, perhaps largely due to  increasing use of [[phylogenetic taxonomy]] among vertebrate palaeontologists, in which ranks are entirely abandoned.

== Warm-bloodedness and activity levels ==
[[File:Laelaps-Charles Knight-1897.jpg|thumb|240px|An 1897 painting of "''Laelaps''" (now ''[[Dryptosaurus]]'') by [[Charles R. Knight]]. Bakker pointed to such restorations  to demonstrate that in the 19th century it was widely accepted that dinosaurs may have been active and agile animals.]]''
{{details|physiology of dinosaurs#Metabolism}}

In a series of scientific papers, books, and popular articles in the 1970s and 1980s, beginning with his 1968 paper ''The superiority of dinosaurs'',&lt;ref name="The superiority of dinosaurs"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bakker | first1 = R.T. | year = 1968 | title = The superiority of dinosaurs | url = | journal = Discovery | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 11–22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Bakker argued strenuously that dinosaurs were warm-blooded and active animals, capable of sustained periods of high activity. In most of his writings Bakker framed his arguments as new evidence leading to a revival of ideas popular in the late 19th century, frequently referring to an ongoing ''dinosaur renaissance''.

These debates sparked interest in new methods for ascertaining the palaeobiology of extinct animals, such as bone histology, which have been successfully applied to determining the growth-rates of many dinosaurs.

Today, it is generally thought that many or perhaps all dinosaurs had higher metabolic rates than living reptiles, but also that the situation is more complex and varied than Bakker originally proposed. For example, while smaller dinosaurs may have been true [[endotherms]], the larger forms could have been [[gigantothermy|inertial homeotherms]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Benton |first1= M.J. |year=2005 |title=Vertebrate Palaeontology | pages= 221–223 |chapter=Were the Dinosaurs Warm-Blooded or Not? | chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=P1LkOL1CijEC&amp;pg=PA221 |isbn=0-632-05637-1 | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Paladino | first1=Frank V. | last2=O'Connor | first2=Michael P. | last3=Spotila | first3=James R. | title=Metabolism of leatherback turtles, gigantothermy, and thermoregulation of dinosaurs | journal=Nature | volume=344 | pages=858–860 | year=1990 | doi=10.1038/344858a0 | issue=6269 | bibcode=1990Natur.344..858P}}&lt;/ref&gt; or many dinosaurs could have had intermediate metabolic rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Barrick |first1= R.

== New theories on dinosaur behaviour ==
The late 1960s  also saw several new theories on the way dinosaurs behaved, often involving sophisticated social behaviour.

On the basis of [[fossil trackway|trackways]], Bakker argued that [[sauropod]] dinosaurs moved in structured herds, with the adults surrounding the juveniles in a protective ring.&lt;ref name="The superiority of dinosaurs" /&gt; However, shortly afterwards this particular interpretation was challenged by Ostrom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ostrom |first1= J.H. |year=1972 |title= Were some dinosaurs gregarious? |journal=Palaeogeography |volume= 11 |pages= 287–301 | doi=10.1016/0031-0182(72)90049-1 |issue=4 |bibcode=1972PPP....11..287O }}&lt;/ref&gt; among others, although the venerable dinosaur track expert Roland T. Bird apparently agreed with Bakker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bird |first1= R.T. |year=1985 |title=Bones for Barnum Brown |location= Fort Worth |publisher= Texas Christian University Press | isbn=0-87565-007-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first rigorous study of dinosaur nesting behaviour came in the late 1970s, when palaeontologist [[Jack Horner (paleontologist)|Jack Horner]] showed that the duckbilled dinosaur ''[[Maiasaura]]'' cared for its young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Horner | first1= John R. | last2= Makela | first2= Robert | title= Nest of Juveniles Provides Evidence of Family-Structure Among Dinosaurs | journal= Nature | volume= 282|pages=296–298 | year= 1979 | doi=10.1038/282296a0 | issue=5736 | bibcode=1979Natur.282..296H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Changing portrayal of dinosaurs ==
The dinosaur renaissance changed not only scientific ideas about dinosaurs, but also their portrayal by artists. Bakker, himself a talented artist, often illustrated his ideas in a lively fashion. Indeed, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090228070415/http://www.lindahall.org/events_exhib/exhibit/exhibits/dino/ost1969_l.shtml Bakker's illustration] of ''Deinonychus'', made for Ostrom's 1969 description, has become one of the most recognisable and iconic of dinosaur restorations.&lt;ref&gt;It is now known that the drawing is inaccurate in many respects, including the pubis being far too short, and the fact that feathers are lacking.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, restorations of dinosaurs shifted from being lizard-like, to being more mammal- and bird-like. Artists started to show dinosaurs in more active poses, and incorporating newer theories of dinosaur locomotion and behaviour. Tails that were widely shown as having been dragged behind a creature, were now shown uplifted, in order to balance the huge bodies while active.

Besides Bakker, key artists in this "new wave" were first [[Mark Hallett (artist)|Mark Hallett]], [[Gregory S. Paul]] in the 1970s, and during the 1980s [[Doug Henderson (artist)|Doug Henderson]] and John Gurche.

Gregory Paul in particular defended and expanded on Bakker's ideas on dinosaur anatomy. He expounded a rigorous and detailed approach to dinosaur restoration, in which he often criticised the errors of the traditionalist approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Paul |first1= G. S. |year= 1987 |chapter= The science and Art of Restoring the Life Appearance of Dinosaurs and Their Relatives; a Rigorous How-to Guide | title=Dinosaurs Past and Present, vol. II | editor1-first= S. J. |editor1-last=Czerkas |editor2-first= E. C. |editor2-last=Olson |isbn= 0-295-96570-3 | publisher= University of Washington Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also produced a large number of restorations showing small dinosaurs with feathers, and defended the idea in a number of articles and his book ''Predatory Dinosaurs of the World''.&lt;ref name="paul1988"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Paul |first1= G.S. |authorlink=Gregory S. Paul|year=1988 |title=Predatory Dinosaurs of the World |location= New York |publisher= Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=0-671-61946-2 | edition=1st }}&lt;/ref&gt; His view was proven largely correct in the late 1990s with the discovery of several [[feathered dinosaurs]]. Paul's ideas and style have had a significant impact on dinosaur art, and likely will continue to do so for some time.

== New extinction theories, the meteor impact ==
{{details|Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event}}
Traditionally paleontology had followed geology in preferring [[uniformitarian]] mechanisms, despite the promotion by [[Eugene Merle Shoemaker]] of the importance of catastrophic impacts. During the renaissance period [[Walter Alvarez]] and others found [[iridium]] in the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary layer. Also the [[Chicxulub Crater]], was identified and determined to be due to a [[meteor impact]]. These discoveries led to the acceptance and popularisation of the idea that the extinction had been caused by an impact event. This in turn undermined the assumption that dinosaurs had become extinct because they were inferior to mammals. Instead it suggested they had fallen prey to a random event which no large animal could have survived.

== Cultural impacts ==
{{details|Cultural depictions of dinosaurs}}
Bakker's non-technical articles and books, particularly ''The Dinosaur Heresies'', have contributed significantly to the popularization of dinosaur science.

''[[The Land Before Time]]'' was one of the first films to portray theropods in the correct horizontal pose, though the tripod pose was used more often.{{Citation Needed|date=July 2018}}

The 1993 film version of ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' was perhaps the most significant event in raising public awareness of dinosaur renaissance theories. For the first time in a major film, dinosaurs were portrayed as intelligent, agile, warm-blooded animals, rather than lumbering monsters more common to older films. [[Jack Horner (paleontologist)|Jack Horner]] was a consultant, and the artwork of Gregory Paul, Mark Hallett, Doug Henderson, and John Gurche were used in pre-production. While the dinosaurs eventually shown in the films had various anatomical inaccuracies, all four of these artists are in the on-screen credits as "Dinosaur Specialists". Bakker himself was not consulted or credited, but his research is referenced by one of the characters in the film, and a Bakker look-alike appears in the sequel ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park|The Lost World]]''.

'''Dracs''' are a fictional [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] [[List of reptilian humanoids|reptilian humanoid]] [[species]] from the works of author [[Barry B. Longyear]], most notably ''[[Enemy Mine (novella)|Enemy Mine]]''. Their homeworld is called Dracon. They have claws and their bodies and heads are covered with plates of various sizes. They can swim. The Dracs have a language based on gurgling sounds and put great stock by their lineages as well as the teachings of their prophet Shizumat.

Dracs are [[hermaphrodite]]s and reproduce by way of [[parthenogenesis]], an [[asexual reproduction|asexual]] form of reproduction found in females where growth and development of an embryo occurs without fertilization by a male. They have no control over timing of conception. 

As a tradition, before a young one is accepted into Drac society, its parent has to recite its whole lineage to the Drac Council.

==In film==
In the 1985 film of ''[[Enemy Mine (film)|Enemy Mine]],'' the Drac species is at war with humans (associated as the Bilateral Terran Alliance, or BTA).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4928">'''Drumming out''' is the historical act of being [[Military discharge#Dishonorable|dishonorably dismissed from military service]] to the sound of a drum. In modern figurative usage, in which the term is sometimes altered to "drub[bing/bed/etc.] out," it may refer to any act of expulsion or dismissal in disgrace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/drummed+out|title=Drum|publisher=thefreedictionary.com|accessdate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bodleian Libraries, Drumming out of the French army (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|alt=Satirical cartoon of depicting Napoleon being drummed out|Satirical cartoon representing Napoleon's exile to Elba.]]
==Origin==
One of the earliest recorded references to drumming out occurs in [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''[[Moral Essays]]'', 3rd epistle, 1731–1733: "Chartres was a man infamous for all manner of vices. When he was an ensign in the army, he was drummed out of the regiment for a cheat; he was next banished Brussels, and drummed out of Ghent, on the same account."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JbBXAAAAYAAJ|publisher=books.google.com|title=The Works of Alexander Pope, Esq: Moral essays|accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also occurs in a figurative sense in [[Thomas Amory (author)|Thomas Amory]]'s  1766 ''Life of John Buncle'': "They ought to be drummed out of society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/124700.html|publisher=phrases.org.uk|title=Drummed out of the army|accessdate=2008-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Revolutionary War==
The earliest known discharge of an American soldier involved the drumming out of [[Lieutenant]] [[Frederick Gotthold Enslin]] for attempted [[sodomy]] in March of 1778 during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. The diary of Lieutenant James McMichael contains a record of the sentence being carried out: 

{{blockquote|"March 15. — I this morning proceeded to the grand parade, where I was a spectator to the drumming out of Lieut. Enslin of Col. Malcom's regiment. He was first drum'd from right to left of the parade, thence to the left wing of the army; from that to the centre, and lastly transported over the [[Schuylkill River|Schuylkill]] with orders never to be seen in Camp in the future. This shocking scene was performed by all the drums and fifes in the army—the coat of the [[wikt:delinquent|delinquent]] was turned wrong side out."&lt;ref&gt;James McMichael, ''[https://archive.org/stream/pennsylvaniaarc22penngoog#page/n231/mode/1up/search/enslin Pennsylvania Archives (Second Series)]'', William Henry Egle, ed., v.15, Harrisburg, PA: E.K. Meyers, State Printer, 1890. p.&amp;nbsp;217&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The sentencing order, approved by [[George Washington]], called for Enslin to be drummed out, never to return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George Washington Drummed Out Soldier for 'Infamous Crime' of Attempted ‘Sodomy’|url=http://cnsnews.com/news/article/george-washington-drummed-out-soldier-infamous-crime-attempted-sodomy|website=CNS News|date=3 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Civil War==
[[American Civil War]] officers drummed out of service might have their heads shaved and their uniforms [[Cashiering|stripped of insignia]] and be paraded in front of their comrades.  Fellow officers were forbidden to touch the person being dishonorably discharged, but in more than one case after the war had ended, a drummed-out man was found dead after receiving a beating from his former comrades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.floridareenactorsonline.com/crimespunishments2.htm|publisher=floridareenactorsonline.cm|accessdate=2008-09-10|title=Crimes And Punishments In The Civil War|author=Robert Niepert|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813114136/http://www.floridareenactorsonline.com/crimespunishments2.htm|archivedate=2009-08-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When someone was being drummed out, the tune "Rogue's March" would be played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonofthesouth.net/leefoundation/civil-war/1861/june/albany-new-york.htm|accessdate=2008-09-11|title=Civil War Harper's Weekly, June 1, 1861|work=[[Harper's Weekly]]|quote=Drumming out Albany volunteers who refused to take the oath.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiction==
The opening to the 1965 NBC series [[Branded (TV series)|''Branded'']] used the ceremony in its opening credits.

In the 1983 film [[The Lords of Discipline (film)|''The Lords of Discipline'']], one of the main characters is dismissed from the fictional Carolina Military Institute in such a ceremony.

In the ''[[Married... With Children]]'' episode "All-Nite Security Dude," Al is drummed out of his position as school security guard.

In season 4 episode 2 of AMC series ''[[Turn: Washington's Spies]]'' a soldier's wife is drummed out of camp and loses her privileges as a camp follower for refusing to wash clothes for the army.

'''FL Lady Bug''' (1945–1974) was a [[Quarter Horse]] mare who was never raced or was shown in a [[horse show]], yet was made famous for her speedy offspring.

==Life==

FL Lady Bug was registered as number 9733 in the [[American Quarter Horse Association]]'s (or AQHA) stud book. A [[Sorrel (horse)|sorrel]] [[mare]], she was foaled in 1945 and bred by W. A. Yeager of [[Woodward, Oklahoma]]. Her owners at the time she was registered were Bill and Alive Likins of [[Davis, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name=StudBook&gt;AQHA ''Official Stud Book and Registry Combined 1–5'' p. 373&lt;/ref&gt; Her sire, Sergeant, was bred to a daughter of his full brother, Will Stead, to produce Lady Bug. Thus, FL Lady Bug was inbred to both Billy McCue and Silver. Her second dam was an unnamed quarter mare from the [[J A Ranch]] in Texas.&lt;ref name=Pedigree&gt;[http://www.allbreedpedigree.com/fl+lady+bug Pedigree of FL Lady Bug at All Breed Pedigree] retrieved on July 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

FL Lady Bug had fourteen [[foal]]s, eleven of whom started races. Ten of those starters were winners, with one Champion Quarter Running Two Year Old Filly – Top Ladybug, three [[Stakes race|stakes]] winners, and ten Race Register of Merit winners.&lt;ref name=Christensen&gt;Christensen "What Legends are Made of" ''Quarter Horse Journal'' p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Digest&gt;Wagoner ''Quarter Racing Digest'' p. 377&lt;/ref&gt; All ten of her Register of Merit qualifiers were sired by different [[stallions]].&lt;ref name=Digest/&gt; She died on March 1, 1974.&lt;ref name=Christensen/&gt;

FL Lady Bug was inducted into the [[American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame|AQHA Hall of Fame]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FL Lady Bug |url=https://www.aqha.com/museum/hall-of-fame/horses/f/fl-lady-bug/ |work= AQHA Hall of Fame |author=American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) |publisher=American Quarter Horse Association |accessdate=September 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File: NeuroSky ForceTrainer Thumb.jpg|thumb | right | Star Wars Force Trainer]]  --&gt;
The '''Force Trainer''' is a ''[[Star Wars]]''-themed toy which creates the illusion of performing [[the Force|Force]]-powered [[telekinesis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,529539,00.html?test=latestnews New Brain-Wave Toy Lets You Do 'Jedi Mind Trick'], Fox News, June 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[brain–computer interface]] toy, released was [[Uncle Milton Industries]]' Star Wars Science line in 2009, comes with a headset that claims to sense the brain's electric fields (similar to an [[Electroencephalography|EEG]]) and relays the signals to a tube that uses a fan to blow a ball into the air. The harder the user concentrates, the harder the fan blows, and the higher the ball is suspended. The voice of [[Yoda]] instructs the user on developing their skills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2009/06/15/may_the_force_be_with_you_for_just_130/ May the force be with you, for just $130], The Boston Globe, June 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

In a 2010 episode of the [[CollegeHumor|College Humor]] series ''Bleep Bloop'', the hosts Jeff Rubin and Pat Cassels tested out the toy, even having a co-worker, Brian Murphy, play [[Brain Age]], a video game advertised as making you use your brain more, while he had the Force Trainer headset on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHA4j66MCa0&amp;feature=relmfu|title=Bleep Bloop: Star Wars Force Trainer|first=|last=CollegeHumor|date=24 June 2010|publisher=|accessdate=22 December 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One user of the toy argues that the brainwave effect of the Force Trainer II is fake; if the electrodes are connected directly to each other instead of being worn by the player, the game will proceed to play itself and pass all of the training exercises without any user input.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Wayne Schmidt|title=Proof Force Trainer II Is Fake|date=2017-01-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahbfsr87fbQ|accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Frank Boney''' (July 3, 1930 – August 30, 1972) was a Justice of the [[Supreme Court of Alaska]] from December 2, 1968, until his death. He was the court's second chief justice following the retirement of [[Buell A. Nesbett]] in 1970, becoming the youngest chief justice of any state supreme court at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=Elaine B.|editor1-last=Mitchell|title=Alaska Blue Book|edition=First|year=1973|publisher=[[Alaska Department of Education &amp; Early Development|Alaska Department of Education]], [[Alaska State Library|Division of State Libraries]]|location=[[Juneau]]|page=99|chapter=Alaska Court System}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in a boating accident at [[Cheri Lake]], in present-day [[Houston, Alaska]].

'''Homicidal sleepwalking''', also known as '''homicidal somnambulism''' or '''sleepwalking murder''', is the act of killing someone during an episode of [[sleepwalking]]. There have been some cases in which an alleged act of [[homicide]] has occurred and the prime suspect may have committed the act while sleepwalking. The veracity of recorded cases is disputed. About 68 cases had been reported in the literature up to the year 2005. One such case is that of Kenneth Parks, who was acquitted of the murder of his mother-in-law in 1987 after using the sleepwalking defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8583408.stm|title=BBC News - The science of defending sleepwalkers that kill|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Cases==
{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}

=== Boshears case ===

Sergeant Willis Boshears was a US serviceman based in the UK. He confessed to strangling a local woman named Jean Constable in the early hours on New Years Day 1961, but claimed that he was asleep and only woke to realize what he had done. The following day, Boshears disposed of the body in an isolated lane. Several days later he was arrested and charged with murder. At his trial in February 1961 at the [[Essex]] Assizes he pled not guilty on the basis of being asleep at the time he committed the offence and was acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&amp;dat=19611014&amp;id=zbgxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=quUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4313,3428608=Ottawa Citizen - Oct 14, 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Essex Murders Paul Donnelley (Wharncliffe Books, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parks case===

In 1987, Kenneth James Parks was a married 23-year-old Canadian man with a 5-month-old daughter. He had a very close relationship to his in-laws, with his 42-year-old mother-in-law Barbara Ann Woods referring to him as "her gentle giant." The summer before the controversial events, he developed a gambling problem and fell into deep financial problems. To cover his losses, he took funds from his family's savings and then began to [[embezzle]] at work. Eventually, in March 1987, his actions were discovered, and he was fired from his job. On May 20, he went to his first [[Gamblers Anonymous]] meeting. He made plans to tell his grandmother the following Saturday (May 23) and his in-laws on Sunday (May 24) about his gambling problems and financial difficulties.

On an early morning on May 24, 1987, Kenneth Parks drove 20 kilometers from [[Pickering, Ontario]] to the house of his in-laws in [[Scarborough, Ontario]]. He entered their house with a key they had previously given him and used a [[tire iron]] to bludgeon his mother-in-law to death. He then turned on his father-in-law, attempting to choke him to death, but he managed to survive the attack. He got back in his car and, despite being covered with blood, drove straight to a nearby police station and confessed, turning himself in, stating "I think I have just killed two people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toronto.citynews.ca/2006/10/27/man-acquitted-of-sleepwalking-murder-running-for-school-trustee-in-durham/|title=Man Acquitted Of Sleepwalking Murder Running For School Trustee In Durham - CityNews Toronto|date=27 October 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parks's only defense was that he was asleep during the entire incident and was not aware of what he was doing. Naturally, nobody believed it; even sleep specialists were extremely skeptical. However, after careful investigation, the specialists could find no other explanation. Parks’ [[EEG]] readings were highly irregular even for a [[parasomniac]]. This combined with the facts that there was no motive{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}, that he was amazingly consistent in his stories for more than seven interviews despite repeated attempts of trying to lead him astray, that the timing of the events fit perfectly with the proposed explanation, and that there is no way to fake EEG results, led to a jury acquitting Parks of the murder of his mother-in-law and the attempted murder of his father-in-law. The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] upheld the [[acquittal]] in the 1992 decision ''[[R v Parks]]''.&lt;ref name="Broughton 1994"&gt;Broughton ''et al.'' Homicidal Somnambulism: A Case Report. ''Sleep'' (1994); 17(3):253-64&lt;/ref&gt;

===Falater case===

Scott Falater, a resident of [[Phoenix, Arizona]] was accused of murdering his wife, Yarmila, by stabbing her 44 times on the night of January 16, 1997. According to an eyewitness, Falater was also seen holding his wife’s head underwater. When he was tried, the prosecution claimed that after the murder had been committed, Falater changed his clothes, put the murder weapon in a [[Tupperware]] container, put the container in a trash bag with his boots and socks, and then stashed the bag in the spare tire well in the trunk of his car. Prosecutors testified that Falater's actions were "too complex" to have been carried out while sleepwalking. In June 1999, Scott Falater was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Lawrence. Can sleepwalking be a murder defense? 26 Apr. 2008. .&lt;http://www.lakesidepress.com/pulmonary/Sleep/sleep-murder.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nieto case===

Antonio Nieto, 58, a resident of [[Málaga, Spain]] murdered his wife and mother in law using an axe and a hammer on January 11, 2001. Nieto's daughter suffered a jaw fracture but was left alone after feigning death, and his son disarmed him after receiving a cut on the ear. Nieto claimed to have been asleep during the attack and dreaming that he was defending himself against aggressive [[ostrich]]es. However, his children stated that he had recognized them and had even told his son to not turn on the lights because their mother (gravely injured already) was sleeping. In 2007 Nieto (already under psychiatric treatment) was sentenced to 10 years interment in a psychiatric hospital and ordered to pay 171,100 euros as compensation to the victims.&lt;ref&gt;''Resolved to intern 10 years the man that killed his wife and mother in law believing they were ostriches.'' (Spanish) .&lt;http://www.diariosur.es/20070221/malaga/acuerdan-internar-anos-hombre_200702211843.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lowe case===

On October 30, 2004, the body of 83-year-old Edward Lowe was found on his driveway in [[Manchester]], [[England]]. His son, Jules, admitted that he caused his father's death, but did not remember committing the act. He has used "[[automatism (law)|automatism]]" as his defense. He was found not guilty by reason of insanity and detained [[at Her Majesty's pleasure]] (that is, indefinitely) in a secure hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/manchester/4337309.stm|title='Sleepwalker' accused of murder|date=10 March 2005|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released after ten months.

=== Brian Thomas Case ===
Brian Thomas, 59, who suffered from automatism and sleepwalking since he was a child, confessed to strangling his 57-year old wife, Christine in July 2008 in their camper van while on vacation. He called emergency services, and was heard telling the operator, "What have I done? I've been trying to wake her. I think I've killed my wife. Oh my God. I thought someone had broken in. I was fighting with those boys but it was Christine. I must have been dreaming or something. What have I done?..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/nov/20/brian-thomas-dream-strangler-tragedy|title=Devoted husband Brian Thomas who strangled wife during his sleep walks free from court|last=Morris|first=Steven|date=2009-11-20|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed he had mistaken his wife for an intruder, waking up to find it was his wife. He was freed in 2009 by a judge, who found him not guilty of murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/8370237.stm|title='Dream killer' released by judge|date=2009-11-20|newspaper=BBC|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/man-who-killed-his-wife-while-sleeping-goes-free-1824945.html|title=Man who killed his wife while sleeping goes free|date=2009-11-21|website=The Independent|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cases from the Book of Lists 3===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}
In [[The Book of Lists|''The Book of Lists 3'']] there is a list of eight people who were recorded as having killed in their sleep by means of using firearms, fighting, or mishandling infants.

===="A.F." case====
"A. F. " was a gun fancier and a [[hunter]] who kept loaded [[firearm]]s in his room. His father, with similar interests, slept in the adjoining room. Hearing a bump against the connecting door early one morning, "A.F.", still asleep, hollered "You dog, what do you want here?" and fired the gun nearest to his reach. The intruder turned out to be his father.

====Fraser case====
Simon Fraser, of [[Glasgow, Scotland]], often dreamed that a beast had invaded his home at night. One time, he dreamed that a white beast had come up through the floor. He seized it and dashed it to the ground. He woke up to find he had killed his infant son. This episode was probably a [[night terror]], with or without sleepwalking.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4gBXAAAAYAAJ|title=Crime and Insanity in England: The historical perspective|last=Walker|first=Nigel|last2=McCabe|first2=Sarah|date=1968-01-01|publisher=Edinburgh U.P.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gnypiuk case====
Wasyl Gnypiuk, a Polish immigrant to [[England]], had suffered [[Nazi]] internment which caused him to have [[nightmare]]s. In one of these, he dreamed of fighting back. In fact, he was in the home of his landlady, and when he woke up it turned out he had beaten her to death. He decided to cut off her head and bury it in a nearby woods. He buried the rest of her some 60 yards from the house. He also stole £350 from her. He was found guilty of capital murder, sentenced to death and hanged at Lincoln on January 27, 1961.

====Griggs case====
Esther Griggs, resident of London and a mother of three, dreamt one night that her house was on fire, screaming "save my children!". Though asleep, Ms. Griggs threw her baby into the street. This episode was probably a [[night terror]], with or without sleepwalking.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Kiger case====
Jo Ann Kiger, a teenager, was asleep when she took a revolver in each hand, poised to defend her family against a "monster." She fired, and fatally shot her brother and her father. She was found not guilty.

====Ledru case====
In 1887, Robert Ledru, a French police [[detective]], was asked to investigate the murder of André Monet on the beach at [[Le Havre]]. Examining the evidence—the fatal [[bullet]] and some footprints—he decides he himself had been sleepwalking on the beach and fired the fatal shot. He turned himself in. While in jail, he was given a gun loaded with blanks. One night he got up and fired at one of the guards at point blank range. This convinced the authorities he was telling the truth about his sleepwalking. From then until his death he lived on a farm outside Paris, under 24-hour watch.&lt;ref&gt;''Look and Learn'', 897, 31 March 1979, pp.22-23&lt;/ref&gt;

Frederick Oughton's novel ''The Two Lives of Robert Ledru'' is based on this case.

====Pollard case====
William Pollard was a farmer whose neighbors knew him well as a sleepwalker and sleep''worker''—doing his [[chicken]]-farm chores while fast asleep. One night he dreamt he was fighting with a marauding stranger. When his wife awakened him, he found he had killed their daughter.

=====Legal rulings=====
The volume says how the law dealt with these cases, adding that [[Western law]] recognizes [[sleepwalking]] as a defense but is otherwise not consistent.&lt;blockquote&gt;"Griggs was charged but the grand jury refused to hand down an indictment; Pollard was never charged; 'A. F.,' Kiger, and Boshears were acquitted; Fraser was not formally acquitted but the court adjourned and then deserted the ''[[diet simpliciter]]'', Ledru was acquitted and both were ordered by the court to sleep henceforth only by themselves, in locked rooms; while Gnypiuk, denied an [[appeal]] to the [[House of Lords]] Appellate Committee, was hanged."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Causes==

[[Sleepwalking]] and other forms of disorders of arousal occur from deep [[non-REM]] [[slow wave sleep]] (SWS). There are [[parasomnias]] that occur from rapid eye movement sleep. It is caused by an inappropriate physiological event where the brain tries to exit SWS and go straight to wake. In normal sleep, the [[brain]] transitions from sleep either from stages 1 or 2 of [[Non-rapid eye movement sleep|NREM]] or [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM sleep]], but almost never from SWS. As a result, the brain gets “stuck” between a [[sleep]] and [[wakefulness|wake]] state.&lt;ref&gt;Bassetti et al., Lancet (2000); 356: 484–485&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Kenneth Parks, his [[EEG]] showed that his brain tries to wake from SWS 10 to 20 times a night. Needless to say, this is an incredible number compared to normal sleepers who almost never experience this. Nobody is sure why some people will commit [[murders]] in their sleepwalking episodes, but it seems reasonable to assume that many conditions must be met. Using Kenneth Parks as an example again, he was planning to go to his in-laws’ residence the next day, he was stressed and depressed from marital and financial troubles, and he had been [[sleep deprivation|sleep deprived]] because he couldn’t get any sleep the night before.&lt;ref name="Broughton 1994"/&gt;

== In Fiction ==
In the first season of the ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' TV series, one episode was titled "The Case of the Sleepwalker's Niece."

On the episode "Dreamcatchers" in the fifth season of the TV series ''[[Teen Wolf (2011 TV series)|Teen Wolf]]''.

In the episode 'In the Dark' of Criminal Minds, a serial killer suffers with this illness, killing multiple people during the night.

In the webcomic and animated short ''Welcome to Hell'', the main character Sock accidentally kills his parents in his sleep.

===Movie Depictions===

The 1920 German horror film ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' centers upon a series of murders committed by a somnambulist under control of the eponymous Dr. Caligari.

The 1932 American gentlemen jewel thief romantic heist comedy "[[Arsene Lupin]]" features numerous depictions of somnambulism, specifically sleepwalking both real and faked by various characters.

The 1971 Italian thriller ''[[A Lizard in a Woman's Skin]]'' involves a woman who thinks she may have murdered a neighbor in her sleep.

The 1997 TV movie ''[[The Sleepwalker Killing]]'' depicts a story in which a man kills his mother-in-law and wounds his father-in-law in the middle of the night, then turns himself in.

The 2010 thriller ''[[In My Sleep]]'' depicts a character who believes he may have murdered a good friend while sleepwalking. The movie was inspired by real life cases.

The 2013 thriller ''[[Side Effects (2013 film)|Side Effects]]'' focuses on a woman who allegedly kills her husband while sleepwalking due to a side effect of the medication she is taking.

'''Hybrid''' ('''Scott Washington''') is a [[fictional]] [[anti-hero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Scott Washington first appeared in ''The New Warriors'' #21 (March 1992) by writer [[Fabian Nicieza]] and penciller [[Mark Bagley]]. The Hybrid symbiote first appeared in ''Venom: Along Came A Spider'' #1 (January 1996) by writer [[Evan Skolnick]] and penciller [[Patrick Zircher]].

==Publication history==
Created by writer [[Fabian Nicieza]] and penciller [[Mark Bagley]], Scott Washington appears in ''The New Warriors'' #21 (March 1992), #25-26 and #36. In 1996, he is the main character Hybrid in the back-up stories in two miniseries ''Venom: Along Came a Spider'' and  ''Venom: The Hunted'', all written by [[Evan Skolnick]].

In 2007, he is mentioned in ''Civil War: Battle Damage Report'' #1. Hybrid is also mentioned at the conclusion of the first issue of ''Carnage U.S.A.'' (2011), along with [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]], [[Anti-Venom (symbiote)|Anti-Venom]], [[Toxin (comics)|Toxin]], and Scorn, as being the next option to stop Carnage's rampage in the Mid-west after the Avengers are defeated.&lt;ref&gt;''Carnage U.S.A.'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://marvel.com/news/story/16101/carnage_usa. Carnage U.S.A.], [[Marvel.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

He has an entry in ''All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z'' #5 - 'Gorgon to Jury' (2006) and an entry in ''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z'' HC vol. 05 - 'Guardsmen to Jackal (Warren)' (2008).

==Fictional character biography==

Scott Washington was an [[African-American]] [[Guardsman (comics)|Guardsman]] involved in guarding and transporting [[Vance Astrovik|Justice]] who had been arrested and sentenced to the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]] prison for [[supervillains]].&lt;ref&gt;''New Warriors'' #21&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hybrid symbiote is an amalgamation of four symbiotes ([[Riot (comics)|Riot]], [[Phage (comics)|Phage]], [[Lasher (comics)|Lasher]] and [[Agony (comics)|Agony]]) into a single symbiote entity. The fused symbiote then sought out Washington in the Vault's lab facility. While guarding the symbiotes, Scott realized that they were not evil, not a threat, and the experiments were causing the organism terrible pain, so he let it go.&lt;ref&gt;[[Evan Skolnick]] (w), [[Patrick Zircher]] (p), Greg Adams (i), "First Touch", ''Venom: Along Came a Spider'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; When his superiors discovered that Scott had released the aliens he was supposed to guard, Scott was fired. He returned to the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, the gang-torn neighborhood in which he grew up. Following a basketball court scuffle with the Eazy X [[gang]], Scott and his brother Derek were shot: Derek was killed while Scott became crippled, losing the use of his legs.&lt;ref name=HFusion&gt;[[Evan Skolnick]] (w), [[Patrick Zircher]] (p), Greg Adams (i), "Fusion", ''Venom: Along Came a Spider'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hybrid symbiote afterwards located and bonded with Scott, which resulted in Scott regaining the ability to walk,&lt;ref name=HFusion/&gt; and more since Scott has a lot of anger, so often the symbiotes hold him back from acts of [[violence]], not the other way around. Since the Hybrid symbiote was originally four different entities, Scott has to contend with four different voices/personalities in his head besides his own. As Hybrid, Scott got revenge on the Eazy Xs gang that had crippled him.&lt;ref&gt;''Venom: Along Came a Spider'' #3-4&lt;/ref&gt; Hybrid began to get a lot of press attention. While most of Hybrid's publicity was positive, [[The Jury (comics)|The Jury]]'s attention got drawn anyway. Despite Scott and [[Curtis Elkins]] (Sentry) being former co-workers, Hybrid would've been executed by these self-appointed guardians of justice just for being a symbiote host but was rescued by the [[New Warriors]]. Justice offered membership in the group but Scott declined, citing more important work to do in his home neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;''Venom: The Hunted'' #1-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott Washington was considered as a "potential recruit" for the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Anthony Flamini]], [[Ronald Byrd]] | Penciller = [[Scott Kolins]] | Inker = [[Scott Kolins]] | Story = | Title = Civil War: Battle Damage Report | Issue = 1 | Date = March 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott is hunted down and murdered by [[Eddie Brock]] as part of a goal to eliminate the symbiotes' "evil" from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;''Venom (2011)'' #15&lt;/ref&gt; The Hybrid symbiote is later separated into the four symbiotes by a clandestine military group to be used by the U.S. Government.&lt;ref&gt;''Carnage U.S.A.'' #2-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Like [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote, Hybrid has wall-crawling and web-slinging abilities, and can form pseudopodia or tendrils to create snares and bladed weapons. Hybrid also has the ability to camouflage, such as its ability to mimic clothes on the person it has bonded with. It also has a border-line warning sense and can "see" through symbiote itself. Hybrid can also detach a piece of itself to send messages to allies, and can change shape to form a membrane that allows it to glide through the air. The Hybrid symbiote can also absorb various materials and chemicals, such as Spider-Man's synthetic webbing.

Like the Venom and [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] symbiotes, the Hybrid symbiote has superhuman strength. With Scott Washington as its host, he regained his ability to walk which he had lost during a gang fight. After Washington's death and being forcibly separated, the symbiotes became catatonic and no longer retain sentience.{{issue|date=July 2016}}

The '''hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis''' ('''HPT axis''' for short, a.k.a. thyroid homeostasis or thyrotropic feedback control) is part of the [[neuroendocrine system]] responsible for the regulation of [[metabolism]].

As its name suggests, it depends upon the [[hypothalamus]], the [[pituitary gland]], and the [[thyroid gland]].

The hypothalamus senses low circulating levels of thyroid hormone (Triiodothyronine (T3) and Thyroxine (T4)) and responds by releasing thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). The TRH stimulates the anterior pituitary to produce thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). The TSH, in turn, stimulates the thyroid to produce thyroid hormone until levels in the blood return to normal. Thyroid hormone exerts negative feedback control over the hypothalamus as well as anterior pituitary, thus controlling the release of both TRH from hypothalamus and TSH from anterior pituitary gland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dietrich JW, Landgrafe G, Fotiadou EH|title=TSH and Thyrotropic Agonists: Key Actors in Thyroid Homeostasis|year=2012|journal=Journal of Thyroid Research|volume=2012|pages=1–29|doi=10.1155/2012/351864|pmc=3544290|pmid=23365787}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis|HPA]], [[hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis|HPG]], and HPT axes are three pathways in which the hypothalamus and pituitary direct neuroendocrine function.

==Physiology==
[[File:Thyrotropic feedback control.svg|thumb|200px|left|Thyrotropic feedback control on a more detailed and quantitative level.&lt;ref&gt;References used in detailed figure are found in image article in Commons: [[:File:Thyrotropic feedback control.svg#References|References]].&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Thyroid homeostasis results from a multi-loop [[Feedback circuit|feedback system]] that is found in virtually all [[higher vertebrates]]. Proper function of thyrotropic feedback control is indispensable for [[Human development (biology)|growth]], [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]], [[reproduction]] and [[intelligence]]. Very few animals (e.g. [[axolotl]]s and [[sloth]]s) have impaired thyroid homeostasis that exhibits a very low [[Setpoint (control system)|set-point]] that is assumed to underlie the [[Metabolism|metabolic]] and [[ontogenesis|ontogenetic]] anomalies of these animals.

The pituitary gland secretes [[thyrotropin]] (TSH; Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) that stimulates the thyroid to secrete [[thyroxine]] (T4) and, to a lesser degree, [[triiodothyronine]] (T3). The major portion of T3, however, is produced in peripheral organs, e.g. [[liver]], [[adipose tissue]], [[glia]] and [[skeletal muscle]] by [[deiodination]] from circulating T4. Deiodination is controlled by numerous [[hormone]]s and [[Nervous system|nerval signals]] including TSH, [[vasopressin]] and [[catecholamines]].

Both peripheral thyroid hormones ([[iodothyronine]]s) inhibit thyrotropin secretion from the pituitary ([[negative feedback]]). Consequently, equilibrium concentrations for all hormones are attained.

TSH secretion is also controlled by [[thyrotropin releasing hormone]] (thyroliberin, TRH), whose secretion itself is again suppressed by plasma T4 and T3 in [[cerebrospinal fluid|CSF]] ([[long feedback]], Fekete–Lechan loop).&lt;ref name=LechanFekete2004&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lechan|first=Ronald M.|author2=Fekete, C|title=Feedback regulation of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH): mechanisms for the non-thyroidal illness syndrome|journal=[[Journal of Endocrinological Investigation]]|year=2004|volume=27|issue=6 Suppl|pages=105–19|pmid=15481810}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional feedback loops are [[ultrashort feedback|ultrashort feedback control]] of TSH secretion (Brokken-Wiersinga-Prummel loop)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Prummel MF, Brokken LJ, Wiersinga WM |doi=10.1089/thy.2004.14.825|pmid=15588378|title=Ultra short-loop feedback control of thyrotropin secretion|year=2004|journal=Thyroid|volume=14|issue=10|pages=825–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[linear feedback|linear feedback loops]] controlling [[plasma protein]] binding.

Recent research suggested the existence of an additional feedforward motif linking TSH release to deiodinase activity in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hoermann R, Midgley JE, Giacobino A, Eckl WA, Wahl HG, Dietrich JW, Larisch R |doi=10.1111/cen.12527|pmid=24953754|title=Homeostatic equilibria between free thyroid hormones and pituitary thyrotropin are modulated by various influences including age, body mass index and treatment|year=2014|journal=Clinical Endocrinology|volume=81|issue=6|pages=907–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dietrich|first1=JW|last2=Midgley|first2=JE|last3=Larisch|first3=R|last4=Hoermann|first4=R|title=Of rats and men: thyroid homeostasis in rodents and human beings.|journal=The Lancet Diabetes &amp; Endocrinology|date=December 2015|volume=3|issue=12|pages=932–933|doi=10.1016/S2213-8587(15)00421-0|pmid=26590684}}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 November 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoermann|first1=R|last2=Midgley|first2=JE|last3=Larisch|first3=R|last4=Dietrich|first4=JW|title=Homeostatic Control of the Thyroid-Pituitary Axis: Perspectives for Diagnosis and Treatment.|journal=Frontiers in Endocrinology|date=2015|volume=6|pages=177|doi=10.3389/fendo.2015.00177|pmid=26635726|pmc=4653296}}&lt;!--|accessdate=21 December 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of this TSH-T3 shunt could explain why [[Sum activity of peripheral deiodinases|deiodinase activity]] is higher in hypothyroid patients and why a minor fraction of affected individuals may benefit from substitution therapy with T3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hoermann R, Midgley JE, Larisch R, Dietrich JW |doi=10.1055/s-0034-1398616|pmid=25750078|title=Integration of Peripheral and Glandular Regulation of Triiodothyronine Production by Thyrotropin in Untreated and Thyroxine-Treated Subjects|year=2015|journal=Hormone and Metabolic Research|volume=47|issue=9|pages=674–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Last Day of the Dinosaurs''''' is a 2010 [[Discovery Channel]] television documentary about the extinction of the dinosaurs. It portrays the [[Alvarez hypothesis]] as the cause of extinction. The documentary was released on August 28, 2010 and narrated by [[Bill Mondy]].

==Production==
The dinosaur models created for ''[[Clash of the Dinosaurs]]'' were reused for this program. The ''[[Parasaurolophus]]'' model was used for ''[[Charonosaurus]]'' even though the legs of ''Charonosaurus'' were shorter than those of ''Parasaurolophus''. The ''[[Deinonychus]]'' model was used for ''[[Saurornithoides]]'' (rather inaccurately, as ''Saurornithoides'' was slenderer than ''Deinonychus''), and the ''[[Sauroposeidon]]'' model was used for ''[[Alamosaurus]]'' (even though ''Alamosaurus'' had different proportions than ''Sauroposeidon''). The same ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'', ''[[Triceratops]]'', ''[[Ankylosaurus]]'', and ''[[Quetzalcoatlus]]'' models were also used. These models were placed upon different backdrops most of the time than those used in ''Clash of the Dinosaurs''.

==Plot==
In the [[Pacific Northwest]] of [[North America]], a ''[[Quetzalcoatlus]]'' is soaring above the valley during a rainstorm when it spots an unguarded ''[[Tyrannosaurus Rex]]'' nest. The pterosaur flies down and consumes several of the hatchlings. Meanwhile, the father ''Tyrannosaurus'' is hunting for prey in the forest when his acute sense of smell alerts him to the intruder at the nest and runs back towards the nest. The ''Quetzalcoatlus'' is forced to flee when the enraged father ''Tyrannosaurus'' arrives, trying to fly off but its huge wings prevent it from flying in the thick forest. The ''T. rex'' repeatedly lunges and tries to kill it. It finally takes off just as the father ''T. rex'' bites the pterosaur's foot, though the pterosaur manages to break free of his jaws by pecking at his eye. Only one ''T. rex'' hatchling survives the carnage.

After a ''T. rex'' attacks an ''[[Ankylosaurus]]'' before being driven off, a male ''[[Triceratops]]'' loses a fight for mating rights against another male ''Triceratops''. Two ''T.rex'' hear the commotion and close in to hunt the loser. Working together, they bring down the ''Triceratops''. In [[Mongolia]] a herd of ''Charonosaurus'' is drinking at a watering hole in an [[oasis]]. A ''[[Saurornithoides]]'' steals an egg from a nest and flees, but the enraged mother follows the raptor into a cave. It tries to eat the egg, but the mother arrives, bellowing before the raptor's partner appears, and the ''Charonosaurus'' flees, with the ''Saurornithoides'' pair racing after it. They manage to bring down the ''Charonosaurus'' by tearing into its neck.

Meanwhile, in what is today central [[Mexico]], a herd of ''[[Alamosaurus]]'' is roaming the plains in search of food while a female lays her eggs without nesting, as a six-mile wide asteroid formed from the collision of two asteroids 100 million years earlier enters the [[Earth|Earth's]] atmosphere. The asteroid hits the Earth in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], creating a massive explosion and sending debris into the air. The explosion heats the air temperature near the crash site to 600° [[Fahrenheit|F]]. Hundreds of ''Alamosaurus'' are burned alive. Two minutes after impact, seismic shock waves trigger an 11.1 earthquake, which, combined with a second heat wave from the impact, wipes out the remaining ''Alamosaurus''. Most of their eggs are destroyed but some survive, buried under the cool soil.



The effects of the collision begin to affect the animals in British Columbia, with the 11.1 magnitude earthquake rippling through the valley. Falling debris litters the ground and drive animals from the valley. Several ''Triceratops'' and ''Ankylosaurus'' are engulfed by a 300° ejecta cloud and burnt to death. Fifteen minutes after impact, the ejecta cloud has spread to the Pacific Northwest and threatens to in-circulate the entire planet in ash. A pair of ''Quetzalcoatlus'' tries to fly away, but pieces of flaming debris shower the valley. Suffering from burnt wings, the male pterosaur falls from the sky to his death. After trying to save her mate, the also wounded female is forced to land in the valley. The effects of the ejecta also caused lightning storms to strike the valley.

The soaring temperatures create high humidity in the valley and force the ''Triceratops'' to keep moving. Many of the dead dinosaurs provide plentiful food for the hungry ''Tyrannosaurus''. The debris create massive fires that devastate forests of the Pacific Northwest. In the valley, the air pressure plummets, creating a vacuum that sucks in the raging flames and ignites a firestorm, causing temperatures in the valley to reaches 1800° F. The female ''Quetzalcoatlus'' stands over her mate's body but panics when the vegetation around her ignites. She manages to take off despite her tattered wings, leaving the dead male behind. Smaller animals hide underground while the larger animals are forced to flee.

In Mongolia, forty-five minutes since the impact, the ejecta cloud rolls in from the east, increasing the temperature around Mongolia by several degrees every second until it reaches 300°, causing three ''Charonosaurus'' and a pair of ''Saurornithoides'' to use a cave for shelter (unenthusiastically with each other as well). The temperatures return to normal after five hours, and the ''Saurornithoides'' run outside to feast on a ''Charonosaurus'' corpse, while two of the surviving ''Charonosaurus'' travel to the watering hole. The third stays behind. Soon the ejecta cloud causes a sandstorm, suffocating the two ''Charonosaurus'' alive. The pair of ''Saurornithoides'' survive by hiding behind their prey, while the third ''Charonosaurus'' remains in the cave. A day passes, and the ''Saurornithoides'' return to the watering hole, where the last ''Charonosaurus'' is drinking. The ''Saurornithoides'' are desperately hungry, yet are weak from their ordeal. One of them recklessly attacks the ''Charonosaurus'', but the hadrosaur collapses on top of it, killing it in the process. The remaining ''Saurornithoides'' resorts to eating the corpse of its companion.

Four days since impact, food is in short supply across the entire planet. In the Pacific Northwest, four ''Triceratops'' head towards an island in search of food. The earthquake caused by the impact event forms a huge [[megatsunami]], but also causes the water to recede and form a land bridge to the island. Three of the ''Triceratops'' cross the land bridge to the island. The female ''Quetzalcoatlus'' lands, where she eats a stranded fish, just as the megatsunami builds and races towards the shore. The ''Quetzalcoatlus'' attempts to take off but is caught into the vast wave and drowns, with the wave subsequently drowning the three ''Triceratops'' as well.

Ten days have passed since impact, and few dinosaurs remain. In Mongolia, the ''Charonosaurus'' stays close to the watering hole, but collapses and dies from inhaling [[hydrogen sulfide]] that rose from the watering hole. The ''Saurornithoides'' runs up to the dead ''Charonosaurus'', but it too is killed by the poisonous gas. 

A month and a half later, in the Pacific Northwest, a handful of dinosaurs patrol the wasteland. A starving but weak ''[[Ankylosaurus]]'' finds a small bush, but it’s almost forced to fight over it when a wandering ''Triceratops'' appears, until the ''Tyrannosaurus'' arrives. The ''Tyrannosaurus'' loses an eye to his prey's horn, but he manages to break off one of its horns and kills it by simply lunging and biting down hard on the neck. The ''Tyrannosaurus'' then turns his attention to the ''Ankylosaurus'' and after being struck in the right leg, flips it over and rips out its throat. He heads back to the dead ''Triceratops'', but trips over the ''Ankylosaurus'' and is impaled through the neck on the ''Triceratops's'' remaining horn. In Mexico, an ''Alamosaurus'' baby emerges from an egg that was sheltered away in the ground. All around the world, small handfuls of dinosaurs try to start over, but their species are beyond hope for replenishing their numbers. In the end, inbreeding, disease, and starvation will wipe out their populations until a single ''Alamosaurus'' remains, only to die in the wasteland too, and it only took 160 million years to bring the dinosaurs to this catastrophic point in their evolution.

But life on Earth was not completely destroyed: fish and crocodiles surviving underwater; small mammals, snakes, insects, arachnids, and lizards hid underground; birds flew or swam away from the disaster. Three years pass before sunlight finally reaches the planet again, and plant life finally carpets the Earth again, setting the stage for a new era: the era of mammals. Mammals now multiply and diversify, with countless species of mammals evolving, until 10,000 species explode across the planet and one species, [[humans]], eventually rule the planet like the dinosaurs once had.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51928">This is a '''list of Dakar Rally fatal accidents''' involving both competitors and non-competitors who have died during a [[Dakar Rally]] [[rally raid|event]].

Since 1979, 70 people are known to have died as a result of the Dakar rally. Among the 28 competitor fatalities, 19 were motorcycle related, 6 car related, 1 truck related, and 2 competitors died as a result of local rebel conflict. Up to 1992, collision was the most common cause of death among competitors.

Among the 42 non-competitor fatalities are those of the race's founder Thierry Sabine, 14 news journalists and support crew, 23 spectators, and 4 children.

The Dakar Rally has received criticism because of its high mortality rates, with the Vatican Paper describing the event as "the bloody race of irresponsibility".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Danger Is Part of Race's Allure|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/27/sports/othersports/27autos.html|last=Bernstein|first=Viv|publisher=New York Times|date=2007-12-27|accessdate=2015-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event received particular criticism in the 1988 race, when three Africans were killed in collisions with vehicles involved in the race. [[Panafrican News Agency|PANA]], a Dakar-based news agency, wrote that the deaths were "insignificant for the [race's] organizers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dangerous Paris-Dakar Race Is Endangered|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/13/world/dangerous-paris-dakar-race-is-endangered.html|last=Brooke|first=James|publisher=New York Times|date=1988-03-13|accessdate=2014-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dakar organizers have not officially recorded or reported on African and Latin American spectator and innocent bystanders deaths.&lt;ref name="telegraph09dakar"/&gt; As a result, fatality numbers for the Dakar vary from source to source, and bystander victims usually remain unnamed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6463">'''Margaret Hanmer''' (c. 1370 &amp;ndash; c. 1420), sometimes known by her [[Welsh language|Welsh]] name of '''Marred ferch Dafydd''', was the wife of [[Owain Glyndŵr]]. Although some modern histories have accorded Margaret the title "Princess of Wales",&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Fisher, ''Princesses of Wales'' (University of Wales Press, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; there is no contemporary record that Margaret used either that title or her husband's earlier title of Prince of Powys. "[[Princess of Wales]]", an English honorific given to the wife of the English prince of Wales, was first used by [[Joan of Kent]]. Only one wife of a Welsh prince is known to have used the title: [[Eleanor de Montfort]], wife of [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]], the last Prince of Wales.

== Early life and marriage ==
[[File:Sycharth motte.JPG|right|thumb|Sycharth from field, showing motte]]
[[File:Sycharth.JPG|right|thumb|Sycharth, showing motte and moat]]
Nothing is known of Margaret's early life, not even the precise date of her marriage. She was the daughter of Sir [[David Hanmer]] and his wife Angharad ferch Llywelyn Ddu, and was probably raised in a Welsh household. Her father taught Owain Glyndwr when the latter studied law; it is not known when Margaret married Owain, although it is thought that their wedding may have taken place in 1383 in the church of St Chad's in [[Hanmer, Wales|Hanmer]]. The number of children she bore, and the dates of their births, are likewise uncertain.

The poet [[Iolo Goch]] praises Margaret and her generosity in his poem ''Llys Owain Glyndŵr yn Sycharth'', one of three he composed in Owain's honour.

''A gwraig orau o’r gwragedd, &lt;br /&gt;
''Gwyn fy myd o’i gwin a’i medd!&lt;br /&gt;
''Merch eglur llin marchoglyw,&lt;br /&gt;
''Urddol hael anional yw;&lt;br /&gt;
''A’i blant a ddeuant bob ddau,&lt;br /&gt;
''Nythaid teg o benaethau.''

And the best of wives,&lt;br /&gt;
Blessed am I in her wine and mead!&lt;br /&gt;
A fine lady of knightly line,&lt;br /&gt;
Most generous by nature;&lt;br /&gt;
Her children come in two by two,&lt;br /&gt;
A beautiful nest of chieftains.

Margaret had three brothers, Gruffydd, Philip and John, all of whom supported Glyndŵr when he formally assumed his ancestral title of Prince of Powys in 1400.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s-HANM-HAN-1388.html Welsh Biography Online]&lt;/ref&gt; The Hamners were still with Owain when a Welsh parliament proclaimed the latter Prince of Wales at Machynlleth in 1404.

Margaret's husband held estates at [[Sycharth]], [[Glyndyfrdwy]], and elsewhere in North Wales. According to Sir John E. Lloyd, Margaret bore her husband five sons and four or five daughters. One daughter, [[Catrin ferch Owain Glyndŵr|Catrin]], married [[Edmund Mortimer, son of the 3rd Earl|Edmund Mortimer]], son of [[Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March|the Earl of March]] and brother-in-law of the famous [[Henry Percy (Hotspur)|Harry Hotspur]], who had been taken prisoner at the battle of Bryn Glas in 1402; when forbidden by the King to exercise his right to ransom himself, Sir Edmund allied himself with Glyndŵr. Another daughter, 
[[Alys ferch Owain Glyndŵr|Alys]], married [[John Scudamore (landowner)|Sir John Scudamore]] of Monnington Straddle, Sheriff of Hereford and castellan of several royal border fortresses. A third daughter, Janet, married Sir John de Croft of Croft Castle in Herefordshire, while a fourth, Margaret, married Sir Richard Monnington of Monnington, also in Herefordshire.[[Owain Glyndŵr|Glyndŵr]]'s sons are given as [[Gruffudd ab Owain Glyndŵr|Gruffudd]], Madog, [[Maredudd ab Owain Glyndŵr|Maredudd]], Thomas, John, and David. Gruffudd and Maredudd were certainly Margaret's sons, but which of the remaining four were also hers remains unknown.

== Rebellion==

[[File:SDJ Harlech Castle Gatehouse.jpg|right|thumb|Harlech Castle gatehouse]]
After Owain proclaimed himself Prince of Powys on 16 September 1400, Margaret and her children were obliged to move to more secure accommodation to avoid capture by the English and becoming pawns, prisoners, informants and victims of the ruthless regime of the times.

After their homes at Sycharth and Glyndyfrdwy were burned in 1403, they lived, among other places, at [[Harlech Castle]], which was taken in 1409 by the young [[Henry V of England|Henry of Monmouth]]. Upon the fall of Harlech, Margaret was captured and imprisoned in the Tower of London with her daughter [[Catrin ferch Owain Glyndŵr|Catrin]], another daughter, and Catrin's three daughters. Margaret's oldest son, [[Gruffudd ab Owain Glyndŵr|Gruffudd]], died in the Tower in 1411. Margaret survived the deaths of her two daughters and three granddaughters, but her own death is unrecorded. She is known to have been survived by her son [[Maredudd ab Owain Glyndŵr|Maredudd]], who was alive in 1421, and by her daughter [[Alys ferch Owain Glyndŵr|Alys]], Lady Scudamore, of Monnington Straddle.

April 13, 2011) was an [[United States|American]] woman who disappeared on April 13, 2011, from her family home in [[Darden, Tennessee|Darden]], [[Tennessee]]. Bobo was last seen alive by her brother, Clint, shortly before 8 a.m., walking into the woods outside her home with a man wearing [[camouflage]]. In September 2014, partial remains were found in northern [[Decatur County, Tennessee|Decatur County]], and her death was ruled a [[homicide]] via a gunshot to the back of the head. Bobo was the cousin of singer [[Whitney Duncan]].&lt;ref name=found&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bule|first1=Jordan|title=Breaking: TBI says remains found are Holly Bobo|url=http://www.jacksonsun.com/story/news/special-reports/abduction-holly-bobo/2014/09/08/tbi-breaking-news/15316959/ |newspaper=[[The Jackson Sun]] |date=September 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Searles"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Searles|first1=Kaylin|title=State: Indentation on Holly Bobo's skull consistent with bullet hole|url=http://fox17.com/news/local/state-identation-on-holly-bobos-skull-consistent-with-bullet-hole|accessdate=August 9, 2017|work=Fox 17, Nashville|date=August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case has been met with several setbacks such as the death of a suspect, multiple changes to the prosecutorial team, and disputes with the [[Tennessee Bureau of Investigation]] (TBI). The prosecution has been heavily criticized for its refusal to produce evidence against the defendants, missing multiple discovery deadlines, and for making frequent changes to the charges against the defendants with little explanation. The TBI even briefly withdrew its services to the entire district after the prosecutor accused it of compromising the case by proceeding "so slowly that the culprits were always one step ahead and that TBI... was leaking information and possibly covering up evidence."&lt;ref name="fall out"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Conte|first1=Chris|title=Emails Reveal New Details In Heated Holly Bobo Fallout|url=http://www.jrn.com/newschannel5/news/Emails-Reveal-New-Details-in-Heated-Holly-Bobo-Fallout-290992851.html|work=News Channel 5|date=February 2, 2015|access-date=March 14, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311030212/http://www.jrn.com/newschannel5/news/Emails-Reveal-New-Details-in-Heated-Holly-Bobo-Fallout-290992851.html|archive-date=March 11, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Defense attorney]]s for the men said they still had yet to receive a [[bill of particulars]] detailing the case against their clients and the results of forensic testing done on evidence from the case over a year after the arrests were made, and filed motions to dismiss charges on the grounds of "silence or stonewalling."&lt;ref name="Evidence" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beres|first1=Nick|title=Strange New Twist In The Holly Bobo Case|url=http://www.jrn.com/newschannel5/news/Strange-New-Twist-In-The-Holly-Bobo-Case-287550941.html|work=News Channel 5|date=January 5, 2015|access-date=January 7, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107084340/http://www.jrn.com/newschannel5/news/Strange-New-Twist-In-The-Holly-Bobo-Case-287550941.html|archive-date=January 7, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Apel|first1=Kara|title=Judge frustrated with how slowly Bobo suspects' cases are moving|url=http://www.wsmv.com/story/27650560/suspects-in-holly-bobo-case-appear-in-court|work=WSMV|date=December 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Faris|first1=Maranda|title=Bobo murder suspects could face death if convicted|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/06/03/holly-bobo-death-penalty-sought/28442435/ |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=June 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrests took place in early 2014, but it wasn't until July 2015 that it was announced that the defendants finally received access to all the evidence against them.&lt;ref name="evidence"/&gt;&lt;ref name="no dna"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beres|first1=Nick|title=Zach Adams' Attorney Discusses Plea Deals, DNA In Bobo Case|url=http://www.newschannel5.com/news/zach-adams-attorney-discusses-plea-deals-dna-in-bobo-case|work=News channel 5|date=February 2, 2017|access-date=February 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204085507/http://www.newschannel5.com/news/zach-adams-attorney-discusses-plea-deals-dna-in-bobo-case|archive-date=February 4, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
At the time of her disappearance, Holly Bobo was a 20-year-old [[nursing]] student in the [[Licensed Practical Nurse]] program at the [[University of Tennessee]] at Martin Parsons Center in [[Parsons, Tennessee|Parsons]], living with her parents and brother in [[Darden, Tennessee|Darden]]. Friends described her as shy and sweet.

==Disappearance==
A timeline of events on the morning of April 13, 2011, is given below, on the basis of witness statements and reported phone records:
* '''4:30&amp;nbsp;a.m.'''  Holly awoke to study for an exam.&lt;ref name=Timeline/&gt;
* '''7:30&amp;nbsp;a.m.'''  Holly answered a call from her boyfriend, Drew Scott, who was [[turkey hunting]] nearby on her grandmother's property.

* '''7:50&amp;nbsp;a.m.'''  Clint was awakened by the family dogs barking and saw a man with Holly outside. "It appeared to be Holly kneeling down and Drew [Scott]. They looked like they were kneeled down, facing each other in the garage, and they were talking back and forth. Holly sounded very upset and heated. He was doing much of the talking, and she would answer back and things like that. I couldn't make out hardly any of the words. The only words I could make out from here were Holly saying, 'No, why?{{'"}} Clint said that he believed the couple were breaking up. At some point, Karen called home and spoke to Clint. "I said, 'Clint, that's not Drew. Get a gun and shoot him.{{'"}} Clint reportedly replied, "You want me to shoot Drew?", still believing the man was Holly's boyfriend.&lt;ref name=Timeline/&gt;&lt;ref name=KHPO/&gt;
* '''7:55&amp;nbsp;a.m.'''  Karen called [[9-1-1]], but because she was calling from work she reached the dispatcher for the wrong county.

* '''9:25&amp;nbsp;a.m.''' The last cell phone ping came from Holly's phone in the area where her phone and its [[SIM card]] were later found.&lt;ref name="Faris"/&gt;

==Investigation==
Clint described the man as being between 5&amp;prime;10&amp;Prime; and 6 feet tall (1.78–1.80 m), weighing {{convert|180|-|200|lb}} and having dark hair sticking out from under his cap that was long enough to cover his neck and touch his collar. Clint said the man was wearing a hat and camouflage clothing from head to toe and identified the pattern as either [[Mossy Oak]] break up or leafy wear. He described the male voice he heard as a very deep and low.&lt;ref name="height and weight"&gt;{{cite news|title=Man was waiting for Holly Bobo: Crime expert|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/man-was-waiting-for-holly-bobo-crime-expert/ |work=[[CBS News]] |date=April 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extensive searches of the area were conducted following Bobo's disappearance. Several items belonging to Bobo were found scattered throughout the town, including her lunchbox, a receipt with her name on it, a card from school, her cell phone, and the SIM card, which had been removed from it.&lt;ref name="personal items"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Action News Staff|title=DNA, personal items entered as evidence in Holly Bobo murder trial|url=http://www.wmcactionnews5.com/story/36354420/bobo-trial-day-3-more-key-witnesses-expected-to-take-stand |work=Action News 5 |date=September 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lunchbox"&gt;{{cite news|title=Searchers find missing Holly Bobo's lunchbox|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1377604/Searchers-missing-Holly-Bobos-lunchbox.html|newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |date=April 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Evidence"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKv3ETdo3_4|title=Evidence Linking Bobo Murder Suspects To The Crime|date=May 18, 2015|work=News Channel 5 |accessdate=January 9, 2017|via=|last1=Beres|first1=Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the investigation, the [[Tennessee Bureau of Investigation]] (TBI) focused heavily on a registered [[sex offender]] who matched the witness description named Terry Britt.&lt;ref name="Britt"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chamberlain|first1=Samuel|title=Holly Bobo trial: Defense blames 'Chester the Molester' for killing|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/09/19/holly-bobo-trial-defense-blames-chester-molester-for-killing.html |work=[[Fox News]] |date=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His home was wire-tapped and searched during the course of the investigation, but he was never charged.&lt;ref name="Britt history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Britt search"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Searles|first1=Kaylin|title=Holly Bobo trial: State rests its case after suspect's former jailmates take the stand|url=http://fox17.com/news/local/holly-bobo-trial-state-rests-its-case-after-suspects-former-jailmates-take-the-stand |work=Fox News 17|date=September 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrests==
A total of six men have been implicated in connection with Bobo's disappearance, with the first of the arrests occurring in March 2014, prior to the discovery of Holly's remains. Zach Adams, his brother Dylan Adams, and friend Jason Autry were ultimately charged with especially aggravated kidnapping, first-degree murder, and rape.&lt;ref name="Hearing date"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Faris|first1=Maranda|title=Defendants in Bobo case face death penalty if convicted|url=http://www.jacksonsun.com/story/news/crime/2015/06/03/defendants-in-bobo-case-face-death-penalty-if-convicted/28405251/ |newspaper=[[The Jackson Sun]] |date=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another two men, Jeffrey and Mark Pearcy, were arrested on charges of [[Accessory (legal term)|accessory after the fact]] and [[tampering with evidence]]; however charges against the Pearcy brothers were dropped. Another  man, Shayne Austin, committed suicide.&lt;ref name="crimesider"/&gt;

It is unclear what initially led law enforcement to suspect these men, but the investigation began with the arrest of Dylan Adams on unrelated weapons charges. Following this arrest, he told police that he witnessed Bobo alive with his brother at Zach's home following her abduction.&lt;ref name=WKRN&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pleasant|first1=Joseph|title=Zachary Adams tried to threaten brother, report says|url=http://www.wkrn.com/story/25132232/tbi-files-new-charge-against-zachary-adams |work=[[WKRN]] |date=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox News"&gt;{{cite news|title=Witnesses saw suspects with Holly Bobo, After kidnapping, TBI says|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/04/30/witnesses-saw-suspects-with-holly-bobo-after-kidnapping-tbi-says/ |work=[[Fox News]] |date=April 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=beres/&gt; An affidavit for a search warrant states that Dylan told authorities that on April 13, 2011, he went to Zach's residence to get his truck. Dylan reportedly "observed Holly Lynn Bobo sitting in a green chair in the living room wearing a pink t-shirt, with Jason Wayne Autry standing just a few feet away." He also told police Zach was "wearing camouflage shorts, black cut-off-sleeve t-shirt and a pair of green Crocs" shoes. Dylan also said that Zach told him "he had raped Bobo and videotaped it."

Many of the details contained in the confession were eventually found to be inconsistent with the known evidence, and the narrative presented later in court was vastly different. In early 2017, it was announced that Jason Autry had agreed to testify against Zach in exchange for leniency.&lt;ref name="autry immunity"&gt;{{cite news|last1=WBBJ 7 Eyewitness News Staff|title=BREAKING: Jason Autry granted immunity in Holly Bobo case|url=http://www.wbbjtv.com/2017/07/07/breaking-jason-autry-granted-immunity-holly-bobo-case/ |work=WBBJ 7 Eyewitness News |date=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, District Attorney Matt Stowe said he and the [[Tennessee Bureau of Investigation|TBI]] were still "actively looking" to bring criminal charges against additional people, although he declined to name the parties or the charges.&lt;ref name="Timeline" /&gt;

===Shayne Austin===
Shayne Kyle Austin was initially offered immunity in exchange for information regarding the location of Bobo's body.&lt;ref name="Charley Project"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/b/bobo_holly.html|title=Holly Lynn Bobo|work=Charley Project|accessdate=July 30, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140722010027/http://charleyproject.org/cases/b/bobo_holly.html|archive-date=July 22, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.foxtvmedia.com/whbq/Shayne_Kyle_Austin_immunity_documents.pdf Shayne Austin immunity agreement]&lt;/ref&gt; Phone records indicate that Austin was in contact with Adams several times on the day of Bobo's abduction and police believed that Austin helped dispose of the body.&lt;ref name="Charley Project"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beres&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beres|first1=Nick|title=Legal Analyst: Suspect's Death Could Hurt Prosecution In Bobo Case|url=http://www.jrn.com/newschannel5/news/Legal-Analyst-Suspects-Death-Could-Hurt-Prosecution-In-Bobo-Case.html|work=News Channel 5 Network|date=February 25, 2015|access-date=February 28, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226190322/http://www.jrn.com/newschannel5/news/Legal-Analyst-Suspects-Death-Could-Hurt-Prosecution-In-Bobo-Case.html|archive-date=February 26, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement was withdrawn after Austin was unable or unwilling to lead them to the body and the district attorney released a statement saying that Austin "has not been completely truthful, forthcoming and cooperative as to any and all aspects of this investigation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bleau|first1=Sarah|title=Immunity agreement with alleged Holly Bobo suspect released|url=http://www.myfoxmemphis.com/story/25409015/immunity-agreement-with-alleged-holly-bobo-suspect-released|accessdate=July 30, 2014|work=[[WHBQ-TV|Fox 13 Memphis]]|date=May 1, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808063352/http://www.myfoxmemphis.com/story/25409015/immunity-agreement-with-alleged-holly-bobo-suspect-released|archive-date=August 8, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April, Austin's attorney filed a complaint against the State asking for an immediate and permanent injunction preventing the state from charging Austin.&lt;ref name=Bleau&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bleau|first1=Sarah|title=Immunity agreement with alleged Holly Bobo suspect released|url=http://www.myfoxmemphis.com/story/25409015/immunity-agreement-with-alleged-holly-bobo-suspect-released|work=[[WHBQ-TV|Fox 13 Memphis]]|date=May 1, 2014|access-date=July 31, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808063352/http://www.myfoxmemphis.com/story/25409015/immunity-agreement-with-alleged-holly-bobo-suspect-released|archive-date=August 8, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austin was found deceased in February 2015 in [[Bartow, Florida]] of an apparent suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jacksonsun.com/story/news/special-reports/abduction-holly-bobo/2015/02/27/shayne-austin-found-hanged/24115817/|title=Fla. police: Shayne Austin found hanged in hotel room|author=Ad Sainz, [[Associated Press]]|date=February 27, 2015|work=[[The Jackson Sun]]|accessdate=July 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/breakingnews/story/2015/feb/26/florida-police-man-thought-be-witness-holly-bobo-case-found-hanged-apparent-suicide/290551/|title=Florida police: Man thought to be witness in Holly Bobo case found hanged in apparent suicide|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|accessdate=July 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbbjtv.com/news/local/OFFICIALS-Holly-Bobo-witness-death-not-suspicious-294145301.html|title=Officials: Holly Bobo key witness's death not suspicious|work=[[WBBJ-TV]]|accessdate=July 26, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150805204659/http://www.wbbjtv.com/news/local/OFFICIALS-Holly-Bobo-witness-death-not-suspicious-294145301.html|archive-date=August 5, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.wmcactionnews5.com/story/28180498/suspect-key-witness-in-holly-bobo-murder-found-dead|title = Suspect, key witness in Holly Bobo murder found dead|date = February 23, 2015|accessdate =July 26, 2015|website = |publisher = [[WMC-TV|WMC Action News 5]]|last = Ferrier|first = Dennis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austin's attorney blamed the suicide on the continual threats of prosecution as well as the "[[witch hunt]]" style of investigation, where they relied on rumors instead of evidence.

===Jeff and Mark Pearcy===
In July 2014, Jeffrey Pearcy and his brother Mark Pearcy were arrested and charged with [[Accessory (legal term)|accessory after the fact]] and tampering with evidence. They were arrested on the basis of allegations made by Jeff's former roommate Sandra King, who alleged that in May 2014, Jeff showed her part of a video showing Adams assaulting Bobo, who was tied up and crying. She told police that she watched only a small clip and did not see the sexual assault. Police arranged for King to make a recorded call to Jeff where she told him over the phone "That video of Holly, if it had been you, I would have watched it," to which he replied, "I know." King alleges that Pearcy's brother Mark shot the video.

Both brothers deny that a video existed and Jeff Pearcy denies knowing the other men who have been arrested for the crime.&lt;ref name=Gordon/&gt; Jeff claims that he was unable to hear Sandra during the phone conversation and that his ex-wife's name is also Holly. Police have analyzed over 20 phones but have not found any video.&lt;ref name=Manna/&gt; Charges against both men were subsequently dropped and the narrative described at Zach Adams's trial did not include any mention of involvement by the Pearcy brothers.&lt;ref name="Manna"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Manna|first1=Nichole|title=Witness says she saw Holly Bobo tied up on video|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/crime/2014/07/29/witness-says-she-saw-holly-bobo-tied-up-in-video/13330099/ |work=[[The Tennessean]]|date=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = DA Not Pursuing Charges Against Suspect In Bobo Case At This Time|url = http://www.scrippsmedia.com/newschannel5/news/Officials-Not-Pursuing-Charges-Against-Suspect-In-Bobo-Case-280863742.html|accessdate = June 5, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150609023917/http://www.scrippsmedia.com/newschannel5/news/Officials-Not-Pursuing-Charges-Against-Suspect-In-Bobo-Case-280863742.html|archive-date = June 9, 2015|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial of Zach Adams==
In September 2017, Zach Adams was the first to go on trial. The prosecution's case was largely circumstantial, as there was no DNA or other forensic evidence tying Zach to the murder.&lt;ref name="DNA"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beres|first1=Nick|title=Is There Enough Evidence To Convict Zach Adams In Murder Of Holly Bobo?|url=http://www.newschannel5.com/news/is-there-enough-evidence-to-convict-zach-adams-in-murder-of-holly-bobo |work=News Channel 5 |date=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jason Autry, the state's key witness, testified to a series of events that was drastically different from Dylan's confession. He testified that he himself was not involved in the abduction but that he went to Shayne Austin's home to buy drugs where he saw Zach, Dylan, and Shayne disposing of evidence from the crime.&lt;ref name="key witness"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cruz|first1=Rachel|title=Holly Bobo Murder Trial Update 2017: Key Witness Jason Autry Could Be Lying|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/holly-bobo-murder-trial-update-2017-key-witness-jason-autry-could-be-lying-192018/ |work=Christian Post|date=July 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Autry narrative"/&gt; He said Zach had a body in the back of his truck wrapped up in a multi-colored blanket and Shayne was disposing of evidence in a burn barrel.&lt;ref name="Autry narrative"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Truesdell|first1=Jeff|title='I Need You to Help Bury This Body': Witness Says He Acted as Lookout When Friend Shot Nursing Student Holly Bobo|url=http://people.com/crime/holly-bobo-trial-jason-autry-testifies-against-zachary-adams/ |work=[[People Magazine]] |date=September 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jason Autry, he agreed to help Zach dispose of the body. They drove to a spot along the [[Tennessee River]] with plans to "gut" her so she didn't float to the top. After unloading her body from the bed of the truck, they realized she was still alive, so Zach shot her in the back of the head. Fearing that the noise of the gunshot might have attracted attention, they loaded her body back into the truck and Zach dropped Jason off.&lt;ref name="Autry narrative"/&gt; Autry testified that Zach later said that he'd dumped the body near a place called Kelly Ridge. (Her remains were found in a different location and it is unclear how the body ended up where it was ultimately found.)&lt;ref name="Kelly ridge"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hardaway|first1=Brittany|title=Jason Autry testifies in Holly Bobo murder trial entire day|url=http://www.wbbjtv.com/2017/09/14/jason-autry-testifies-holly-bobo-murder-trial-entire-day/ |work=WBBJ 7 Eyewitness News|date=September 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The narrative presented at trial is that Zach, Shayne, and Dylan went to the Bobo residence to teach Clint Bobo to make meth, an allegation that Clint denies.&lt;ref name="Clint Meth"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dooley|first1=Sean|last2=Effron|first2=Lauren|title=Holly Bobo's brother, who saw her being abducted, and parents recall day she vanished|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/holly-bobos-brother-person-alive-parents-recall-day/story?id=50131287 |work=ABC News|date=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holly came out of the home "screaming and hollering" and that is when the men abducted her.&lt;ref name="make meth"&gt;{{cite news|last1=News Channel 5 Staff|title=7 Main Takeaways From Autry's Testimony In Bobo Murder Trial|url=http://www.newschannel5.com/news/7-main-takeaways-from-autrys-testimony-in-bobo-murder-trial |work=News Channel 5|date=September 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution alleged that Shayne Austin was the man that Clint described as walking into the woods with Holly, as he is the only one who was close to the size of the man he described.&lt;ref name="crimesider"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crimesider Staff|title=Holly Bobo case: Star witness testimony in dispute as case heads to jury|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/holly-bobo-case-star-witness-testimony-in-dispute-as-case-heads-to-jury-deliberations-continue/ |work=48 hours Crimesider |date=September 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three men are alleged to have raped Holly in a local barn owned by the grandmother of both Shayne Austin and Jason Autry.&lt;ref name="crimesider"/&gt;

Two pieces of paper belonging to Holly, a receipt and a note card, were found on the road where Shayne Austin lived. The receipt was found 75 feet from Austin's driveway.&lt;ref name="receipt"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crimesider Staff|title=Agent admits investigators made mistakes in Holly Bobo case|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/agent-state-police-made-mistake-in-holly-bobo-case/ |work=48 hours crimesider |date=September 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosecution also presented other pieces of circumstantial evidence linking Zach to the murder, including that he drove a white truck; a neighbor of the Bobo family had seen a white truck driving rapidly the morning of the murder.&lt;ref name="Babb"&gt;{{cite news|last1=WMC Action News 5 Staff|title=Bobo Trial: Emotional day one testimony culminates with Holly's mother|url=http://www.wmcactionnews5.com/story/36332827/holly-bobo-murder-trial-begins-monday|accessdate=September 24, 2017 |work=WMC Action News 5 |date=September 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other witnesses testified that Zach made statements implicating himself in her disappearance.

A gun, listed as an Arminus model HW5, 32 caliber [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] long [[revolver]] was introduced into evidence by the prosecution.&lt;ref name="IBT"&gt;{{cite news|last1=VARANDANI|first1=SUMAN|title=Holly Bobo Murder Trial Update: Suspected Murder Weapon 'Crucial Piece Of Evidence', State Says|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/holly-bobo-murder-trial-update-suspected-murder-weapon-crucial-piece-evidence-state-2563979|accessdate=July 11, 2017 |newspaper=[[International Business Times]] |date=July 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local man, Victor Dinsmore, led police to the gun, claiming that Shayne Austin and Jason Autry sold him the weapon in exchange for drugs.

On September 22, 2017, a jury found Zach Adams guilty on all charges, including first-degree murder, especially aggravated kidnapping, and aggravated rape.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"/&gt; On September 23, 2017, he was sentenced to life in prison without parole and two consecutive terms of 25 years for both the kidnapping and rape convictions.&lt;ref name="parole"/&gt;

==John Dylan Adams==

On January 18, 2018, John Dylan Adams pled guilty to charges of facilitation of first-degree murder and especially aggravated kidnapping. He was sentenced to 15 years for facilitation of first-degree murder and 35 years for especially aggravated kidnapping. Those sentences are set to run concurrently, meaning he will serve 35 years without parole. Dylan entered an [[Alford plea]], a type of guilty plea where the defendant does not admit to the criminal act and maintains his innocence but concedes that the prosecution's case may result in a guilty verdict.&lt;ref name="alford"/&gt;

==Innocence claims==
Despite confessions from Autry, Austin, and Dylan Adams, all men arrested for the crime have vehemently denied involvement in the disappearance at some point and have accused the state of coercive tactics. Early in the case, Autry claimed that investigators tried to get him to testify falsely against Zach Adams.&lt;ref name=beres&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beres|first1=Nick|title=Holly Bobo Murder Suspect Jason Autry Speaks Out About Case|url=http://www.jrn.com/newschannel5/news/259872621.html|work=News channel 5|date=May 19, 2014|access-date=July 31, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912113736/http://www.jrn.com/newschannel5/news/259872621.html|archive-date=September 12, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family of Dylan Adams, who is mentally disabled, claimed that "[T]hey kept him up all night, would not give him anything to eat or drink and finally he said, 'What do you want me to say?{{'"}}&lt;ref name="allegation"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.jacksonsun.com/story/news/special-reports/abduction-holly-bobo/2014/09/23/exclusive-family-member-says-dylan-adams-knowingly-disposed-evidence-holly-bobo-case/16128815/|title = Exclusive: Family member says Dylan Adams would not have knowingly disposed of evidence in Holly Bobo case|last = Bule|first = Jackson|date = September 24, 2014|newspaper = [[The Jackson Sun]]|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to family members, Dylan has some ability to read but cannot perform other tasks such as telling time, and they believe that Dylan is being manipulated.&lt;ref name="family speaks"&gt;{{cite news|title=Suspect's family Speaks|url=http://www.wsmv.com/video?clipId=10620607&amp;autostart=true |work=[[WSMV-TV|WSMV]] |date=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the trial for Zach, it was alleged that the state used unethical investigatory techniques to coerce a confession from Dylan. In 2014, Dylan was arrested on federal gun charges that would have ended in a lengthy prison sentence. The prosecutor, who was also handling the Bobo case, arranged a no-jail plea deal on the condition that he go live with a retired police officer, Dennis Benjamin, whom Dylan did not know. Five weeks later, Benjamin called 911 to report that he had someone in his home that wanted to confess to the murder of Holly Bobo. Despite the fact that this confession led to the arrests, much of what he confessed to did not match the evidence.&lt;ref name="Benjamin"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Editor|title=Holly Bobo: The Trial Day One – Beginning of the Journey's End|url=https://www.lexingtonprogress.com/2017/09/11/holly-bobo-the-trial-day-one-beginning-of-the-journeys-end/|accessdate=September 24, 2017 |work=The Lexington Progress |date=September 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dylan's mother claims that there was extensive coercion in his interrogation: "In this statement Dylan is trying to tell his story as to what happened, and you've got this TBI agent saying, 'Don't you mean this? Don't you mean it happened like this?' And, 'No, Dylan, it went down like this.' And you can honestly tell at [that] point that Dylan, I can as his mother, he gave up. He's like, 'OK, if that's what you said, OK,{{'"}} Cindy Adams said.&lt;ref name="Mother"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gordon|first1=Carley|title=Mother of Holly Bobo murder suspects breaks her silence|url=http://www.wsmv.com/story/35435363/mother-of-holly-bobo-murder-suspects-breaks-her-silence |work=[[WSMV-TV|WSMV Nashville]] |date=May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeffrey Pearcy also claims the statements regarding his involvement were fabricated by King to assist her son, who has been in prison for 14 years and has 24 years left on his sentence.&lt;ref name=Manna/&gt; "I have been up front and honest about everything. I have willingly given them everything. Take it, I mean, it's there," he said. "My heart goes out to the Bobo family. It could have very well been one of my kids. For someone to give them false hope, and that's exactly what's been done to them," he said. "But for the justice system to just haul someone in and destroy their whole life, I mean, there's no sense in that at all."

===Zach Adams defense===
At Zach Adams's trial, his defense contended that he was "100% innocent."&lt;ref name="100 percent"&gt;{{cite news|last1=WKRN Staff|url=http://wkrg.com/2017/09/22/zach-adams-found-guilty-on-all-charges-in-holly-bobo-murder-case/ |title=Zach Adams Found Guilty on All Charges in Holly Bobo Murder Case |accessdate=September 25, 2017|work=[[WKRG-TV|WKRG News 5]] |date=September 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defense alleged that Jason Autry concocted a story in exchange for a reduced sentence and that although some of his story seemed to be corroborated he had access to all these details through discovery. They also pointed to the fact that cell phone pings do not follow the path that Holly's cell phone takes and that none of the men matched the witness description given by Clint Bobo. Zach, Dylan, and Jason were all too tall and were either too slim or too heavy to be the abductor. Shayne Austin was the correct weight and height, but Clint described a man with dark hair that covered his neck; Shayne had short red hair.&lt;ref name="defense case"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Editor|title=Bobo Trial: Prosecution, Defense Present Closing Arguments|url=https://www.lexingtonprogress.com/2017/09/21/bobo-trial-closing-arguments/|accessdate=September 25, 2017 |work=The Lexington Progress |date=September 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former TBI agent Terry Dicus, who was the lead investigator on the case, testified for the defense. He told the jury that he ruled the men out early in the case because Shayne Austin passed a polygraph, their alibis checked out, and cell phone records put Zach and Holly several miles apart during the critical time frame.&lt;ref name="20/20"/&gt; According to a defense expert, Zach's and Holly's cell phones were in separate sectors nearly the entire time frame of her abduction; the cell phones came into the same sector only at about 9:10&amp;nbsp;a.m., over an hour later.&lt;ref name="cell records"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mojica|first1=Adrian|title=Holly Bobo Trial: Defense refocuses on Britt as possible killer, cell phone data|url=http://fox17.com/news/local/holly-bobo-trial-defense-refocuses-on-britt-as-possible-killer-cell-phone-data|agency=Fox 17|date=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dicus also noted that for Autry's story to fit with the cell phone pings, they would have to drive 106 miles per hour, a scenario that is unlikely on the winding gravel roads they traveled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Brett|title=Former defense witness claims Autry’s testimony wasn’t true in Bobo case|url=http://wkrn.com/2017/11/10/former-defense-witness-claims-autrys-testimony-wasnt-true-in-bobo-case/|agency=WKRN|date=November 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defense also noted that all four men had been ruled out as the originator of a palmprint found on Holly's car, while another suspect, Terry Britt, could not be excluded.&lt;ref name="palm print"&gt;{{cite news|last1=WMC Action News 5 Staff|title=Prosecutor: Holly Bobo deserves justice; jury resumes deliberations Friday|url=http://www.wave3.com/story/36418958/zach-adams-fate-on-the-line-as-closing-arguments-cap-murder-trial|agency=WMC Action News 5|date=September 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terry Britt===
Zach's defense attorney, Jennifer Thompson, contends that the initial suspect in the case, Terry Britt, was the real killer, saying that he "has never been cleared by the TBI and in fact it appears the government has more evidence of his guilt than it does of the three defendants charged in the present case."&lt;ref name="Gordon"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gordon|first1=Carley|title=Attorney: Possible new suspect in Holly Bobo case|url=http://www.fox19.com/story/32777404/attorney-possible-fourth-suspect-in-holly-bobo-case |work=Fox 19 Now |date=August 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Britt is a convicted sex offender who has been convicted of three separate rapes and, {{as of|2017|lc=y}}, is serving time in prison for the 2008 kidnapping and attempted rape of another woman.&lt;ref name="Britt search"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Britt history"&gt;{{cite news|last1=WBIR Staff|title=State rests its case against Zach Adams in murder of Holly Bobo|url=http://www.wbir.com/news/crime/state-rests-its-case-against-zach-adams-in-murder-of-holly-bobo/476834476 |work=[[WBIR]] |date=September 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was argued at trial that Britt fit the physical description and had a history of stalking blond women. Clint Bobo also identified a voice sample of Britt's voice as being very similar to the voice he heard that morning.&lt;ref name="Britt hair"/&gt;

Former TBI agent Terry Dicus testified that Britt had fabricated an alibi for that morning. Britt told investigators that his wife stayed home from work that morning to help him install a bathtub. Through the investigation, Dicus discovered that his wife, Janet, had gone to work that morning but Terry called and made her leave "on the biggest news day" of the county's history. The Britts did produce a handwritten receipt for the bathtub, but the store had no record of the sale.

==Criticisms of the prosecution==
The criminal case against the men charged has been met with strong criticism and conflict between members of the prosecution, complicating the investigation. District Attorney Matt Stowe was elected to office in the summer of 2014 following the arrests and stated that he believes he was elected in part due to skepticism regarding the arrests and questions over whether enough evidence exists against them to obtain a conviction. "[Voters] wanted another set of eyes on this Holly Bobo case; they weren't happy with everything that was coming out of there, and I think that they wanted someone else to take a look and someone else to say, 'We know what's going on.{{'"}}&lt;ref name="Timeline" /&gt;

In the fall of 2014, Jason Autry's attorney, John Herbison, accused the prosecutor of arresting the defendants without probable cause as an unethical "investigatory technique," then adding and dropping charges strategically before hearings to avoid having to produce evidence against the defendants.&lt;ref name="wsmv.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=found/&gt;&lt;ref name="Timeline" /&gt; In October 2014, when [[evidence tampering]] charges were dropped against Dylan Adams just days after he was charged with rape, Herbison said: "If those reports are correct, it means that they're just playing games," Herbison said. "They charged him with something less serious in order to keep him locked up, and then when it comes time to answer questions about the charge, they dismiss that and charge him with a more serious charge in circuit court, where he's not entitled to a preliminary hearing."&lt;ref name="wsmv.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.wsmv.com/story/26817760/autrys-attorney-weighs-in-on-changes-in-bobo-case|title = Autry's attorney weighs in on changes in Bobo case|last = Gordon|first = Carley|date = October 17, 2014|work = WSMV|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also noted the state's similar treatment of Mark Pearcy to avoid hearings. In August 2014, the state failed to arrange transport for Pearcy to the courthouse causing the hearing to be rescheduled for September, but just prior to the new hearing the charges against him were dropped with the explanation given that Pearcy was facing unrelated federal charges and they were being forced to wait to proceed with the state charges. Herbison said the laws regarding the charges would not preclude the state charges. "If the state is claiming that is the case, the prosecutor is either ill-informed or being disingenuous," he said. Charges were never reinstated and the case against his brother, Jeff, was similarly dropped.&lt;ref name="wsmv.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="charges dropped"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Manna|first1=Nichole|title=Judge upset when Holly Bobo suspect is absent from court|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/2014/08/19/judge-upset-holly-bobo-not-in-court/14276581/ |newspaper=[[The Tennessean]] |date=August 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zach Adams's attorney, Jennifer Thompson, repeatedly said that evidence wasn't turned over to the defense. For example, in 2014, DA Matt Stowe made a statement that because Holly was menstruating at the time of her abduction there was a lot of DNA evidence in Zachary Adams's Decatur County home. No DNA evidence was ever turned over to the defense or produced at trial. She also said that the medical examiner referred to materials that were never given to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gordon|first1=Carley|title=Attorney: Possible new suspect in Holly Bobo Case|url=http://www.fox19.com/story/32777404/attorney-possible-fourth-suspect-in-holly-bobo-case |work=Fox 19 Now |date=August 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 17, 2014, nine months after Zach Adams's arrest, Judge Creed McGinley chastised prosecutors for delays in the case and for the state's failure to turn over evidence to the defense. "I am absolutely out of patience with these cases not moving," he said. Judge McGinley ordered that a bill of particulars be filed for Zachary Adams's case within seven days and that discovery take place immediately. The prosecution ignored both deadlines.&lt;ref name="Beres"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Apel"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Apel|first1=Kara|title=Judge frustrated with how slowly Bobo suspects' cases are moving |url=http://www.wsmv.com/story/27650560/suspects-in-holly-bobo-case-appear-in-court |work=[[WSMV-TV|WSMV]] |date=December 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, attorneys for the men filed motions to dismiss charges.&lt;ref name="Beres"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Apel"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.jrn.com/newschannel5/news/Holly-Bobo-Rape-Suspect-Demands-He-Be-Released-297575411.html|title = Holly Bobo rape suspect demands release from jail|last = Conte|first = Chris|date = March 25, 2015|work = News Channel 5|accessdate = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150328030804/http://www.jrn.com/newschannel5/news/Holly-Bobo-Rape-Suspect-Demands-He-Be-Released-297575411.html|archive-date = March 28, 2015|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The motions filed accused the state of "silence or stonewalling," stating that, among other things, the state had yet to disclose evidence that the skull found belonged to Bobo. "It would appear to me if they had a skull with a dental match they would have given that to us right away. It's a little suspicious why we don't have that forensic information," said Autry's attorney Fletcher Long.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/suspects-holly-bobo-murder-case-judge-drop-charges-article-1.2063239|title = Suspects in Holly Bobo murder case ask judge to drop charges over lack of evidence|last = Associated Press|first = |date = January 1, 2015|work = New York Daily News|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Evidence" /&gt;&lt;ref name="evidence"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beres|first1=Nick|title=Defense Attorneys Receive Full Access To Evidence In Holly Bobo Case|url=http://www.scrippsmedia.com/newschannel5/news/FULL-DISCOVERY--READY-IN-BOBO-CASE-314684031.html|work=News channel 5|date=July 13, 2015|access-date=July 14, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714081737/http://www.scrippsmedia.com/newschannel5/news/FULL-DISCOVERY--READY-IN-BOBO-CASE-314684031.html|archive-date=July 14, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.wsmv.com/story/27773904/court-dates-postponed-special-prosecutor-named-in-holly-bobo-murder-case|title = Court dates postponed, special prosecutor named in Holly Bobo murder case|last = Gordon|first = Carley|date = January 6, 2015|work = WSMV|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the hearing in December 2014, a dispute regarding the handling of the case led the TBI to briefly drop its investigation of the case and cut ties with the entire district, saying District Attorney Matt Stowe had accused them of misconduct.

The case attracted a high level of national media coverage.&lt;ref name="Robin L.

A notable example of misinformation was the description of her last known movements. Early reports inaccurately reported that Bobo was dragged into the woods. Clint later clarified that Holly had, in fact, walked with the man wearing [[camouflage]] into the woods, either willingly or by coercion. This clarification led to rumors that Clint had changed his story and was a suspect in his sister's disappearance. Whitney Duncan defended him in an April 17 Twitter statement, stating that he was innocent and not a suspect in the case.&lt;ref name=Discovery/&gt; Some early sources also erroneously reported that the skull was found on property owned by Zach Adams's family.&lt;ref name="People"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Baker|first1=k.c.|title=Third Man Indicted in Kidnapping, Rape and Murder of Tennessee Nursing Student Holly Bobo|url=http://people.com/crime/holly-bobo-murder-john-dylan-adams-indicted/ |work=[[People Magazine]] |date=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her body was found 10 miles away from Adams's property on land owned by the Tubbs family.&lt;ref name="Christie"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Christie|first1=Joel|title=Human skull found in woods 10 miles from the home of man charged with kidnapping and murdering nursing student Holly Bobo|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2747371/Human-skull-woods-10-miles-home-man-charged-kidnapping-murdering-nursing-student-Holly-Bobo.html |work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=September 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buie"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Buie|first1=Jordan|title=Property owner perplexed by discovery of human remains|url=http://www.jacksonsun.com/story/news/local/2014/09/08/property-owner-perplexed/15299615/ |work=[[The Jackson Sun]] |date=September 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Occupational burnout''' is thought to result from long-term, unresolvable, job stress. In 1974, [[Herbert Freudenberger]] became the first researcher to publish in a ''psychology''-related journal a paper that used the term ''burnout''. The paper was based on his observations of the volunteer staff (including himself) at a free clinic for drug addicts.&lt;ref name="staffburnout1"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Freudenberger, H.J.|year=1974|title=Staff burnout|journal=Journal of Social Issues|volume= 30|pages=159–165|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1974.tb00706.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; He characterized burnout by a set of symptoms that includes exhaustion resulting from work's excessive demands as well as physical symptoms such as headaches and sleeplessness, "quickness to anger" and closed thinking. He observed that the burned-out worker "looks, acts, and seems depressed". After the publication of Freudenberger's original paper, interest in occupational burnout grew. Because the phrase "burnt-out" was part of the title of a 1961 Graham Greene novel, ''A Burnt-Out Case'', which dealt with a doctor working in the Belgian Congo with patients who had leprosy, the phrase may have been in use outside the psychology literature before Freudenberger employed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Burnt-Out Case|last=Greene|first=Graham|publisher=William Heinemann Ltd|year=1961|isbn=978-0140185393|pages=cover title}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to study burnout, a number of researchers developed more focused conceptualizations of burnout. In one conceptualization, job-related burnout is characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization (treating clients/students and colleagues in a cynical way), and reduced feelings of work-related personal accomplishment.&lt;ref name = "Maslach"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Maslach, C., Jackson, S.E, &amp; Leiter, M.P. |title=MBI: The Maslach Burnout Inventory: Manual|publisher= Consulting Psychologists Press|location=Palo Alto|year= 1996|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277816643}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ruotsalainen|first1=JH|last2=Verbeek|first2=JH|last3=Mariné|first3=A|last4=Serra|first4=C|title=Preventing occupational stress in healthcare workers.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=7 April 2015|issue=4|pages=CD002892|pmid=25847433|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002892.pub5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another conceptualization, burnout is thought to comprise emotional exhaustion, physical fatigue, and cognitive weariness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Shirom, A., &amp; Melamed, S.|year=2006|title=A comparison of the construct validity of two burnout measures in two groups of professionals|journal=International Journal of Stress Management|volume=13|issue=2|pages=176–200|doi=10.1037/1072-5245.13.2.176}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third conceptualization holds that burnout consists of exhaustion and disengagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Demerouti | first1 = E | last2 = Bakker | first2 = A.B. | last3 = Vardakou | first3 = I. | last4 = Kantas | first4 = A. | year = 2002 | title = The convergent validity of two burnout instruments: A multitrait-multimethod analysis | url = | journal = European Journal of Psychological Assessment | volume = 18 | issue = 1| pages = 296–307 | doi = 10.1037/a0037726 | pmid = 25151460 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The core of the three conceptualizations, as well as Freudenberger's, is exhaustion. Long limited to these dimensions, burnout is now known to involve the full array of depressive symptoms (e.g., low mood, cognitive alterations, sleep disturbance).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Bianchi, R., Schonfeld, I.S., &amp; Laurent, E.|year=2015|title=Burnout-depression overlap: A review|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|volume=36|pages=28–41|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2015.01.004|pmid=25638755}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bianchi | first1 = R. | last2 = Schonfeld | first2 = I.

Originally, Maslach and her colleagues focused on burnout within human service professions (e.g., teachers, social workers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jackson | first1 = S. | last2 = Schwab | first2 = R. | last3 = Schuler | first3 = R. | year = 1986 | title = Toward an understanding of the burnout phenomenon | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 71 | issue = 4| pages = 630–640 | doi=10.1037/0021-9010.71.4.630}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later expanded the application of burnout to include individuals in many other occupations.&lt;ref name = "Maslach"/&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
Burnout is not recognized as a distinct disorder in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-5]].&lt;ref name="sciammind2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ulrich Kraft|publisher=Scientific American|title=Burned Out|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/burned-out/|date=June 2006|pages=28–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is included in the [[ICD-10]], but not as a disorder.&lt;ref&gt;ICD-10: International Classification of Diseases. Geneva: World Health Organization, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be found in the ICD under problems related to life-management difficulty (Z73).

In 1981, [[Christina Maslach]] and Susan Jackson developed the first widely used instrument for assessing burnout, namely, the [[Maslach Burnout Inventory]] (MBI).&lt;ref name = "Maslach2"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Maslach, C., &amp; Jackson, S.E.|year=1981|title=The measurement of experienced burnout|journal=Journal of Occupational Behavior|volume= 2|issue=2|pages=99–113|doi=10.1002/job.4030020205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with Maslach's conceptualization, the MBI operationalizes burnout as a three-dimensional syndrome consisting of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment.&lt;ref name = "Maslach2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Maslach"/&gt; Other researchers have argued that burnout should be limited to fatigue and exhaustion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Kristensen|first1 = T.S.|last2 = Borritz|first2 = M.|last3 = Villadsen|first3 = E.|last4 = Christensen|first4 = K.B.|year = 2005|title = The Copenhagen Burnout Inventory: A new tool for the assessment of burnout|url = |journal = Work &amp; Stress|volume = 19|issue = 3|pages = 192–207|doi = 10.1080/02678370500297720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A growing body of evidence suggests that burnout is etiologically, clinically, and [[nosology|nosologically]] similar to [[Major depressive disorder|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Bianchi, E., Schonfeld, I.S., &amp; Laurent, E.

==Risk factors==
Evidence suggests that the etiology of burnout is multifactorial, with dispositional factors playing an important, long-overlooked role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Alarcon|first1 = G.|last2 = Eschleman|first2 = K. J.|last3 = Bowling|first3 = N. A.|year = 2009|title = Relationships between personality variables and burnout: A meta-analysis|url = |journal = Work &amp; Stress|volume = 23|issue = 3|pages = 244–263|doi = 10.1080/02678370903282600}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Swider|first1 = B. W.|last2 = Zimmerman|first2 = R.

Occupational burnout often develops slowly and may not be recognized until it has become severe. When one's expectations about a job and its reality differ, burnout can begin.

Burnout is thought to occur when a mismatch is present between the nature of the job and the person doing the job. A common indication of this mismatch is work overload, which sometimes involves a worker who survives a round of layoffs, but after the layoffs the worker finds that he or she is doing too much with too few resources. Overload may occur in the context of downsizing, which often does not narrow an organization's goals, but requires fewer employees to meet those goals.&lt;ref name="Maslach972"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Maslach, C. &amp; Leiter, M.P.|title=The Truth About Burnout: How Organizations Cause Personal Stress and What to Do About It|location=New York|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year= 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[job demands-resources model]] has implications for burnout, as measured by the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI). Physical and psychological job demands were concurrently associated with the exhaustion, as measured by the OLBI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Demerouti|first1=Evangelia|last2=Bakker|first2=Arnold B.|last3=Nachreiner|first3=Friedhelm|last4=Schaufeli|first4=Wilmar B.|title=The job demands-resources model of burnout.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=2001|volume=86|issue=3|pages=499–512|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.86.3.499}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of job resources was associated with the disengagement component of the OLBI.

Maslach, Schaufeli and Leiter identified six risk factors for burnout: mismatch in workload, mismatch in control, lack of appropriate awards, loss of a sense of positive connection with others in the workplace, perceived lack of fairness, and conflict between values.&lt;ref name="Maslach01"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Maslach|first1 = C.|last2 = Schaufeli|first2 = W. B.|last3 = Leiter|first3 = M. P.|editor = S. T. Fiske |editor2=D. L. Schacter |editor3=C. Zahn-Waxler|year = 2001|title = Job burnout|journal = Annual Review of Psychology|volume = 52|pages = 397–422|doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.52.1.397|pmid = 11148311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnout is supposed to be a work-specific syndrome. However, this restrictive view of burnout's scope has been shown to be groundless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bianchi | first1 = R. | last2 = Truchot | first2 = D. | last3 = Laurent | first3 = E. | last4 = Brisson | first4 = R. | last5 = Schonfeld | first5 = I. S. | year = 2014 | title = Is burnout solely job-related? A critical comment | url = | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Psychology | volume = 55 | issue = 4| pages = 357–361 | doi=10.1111/sjop.12119| pmid = 24749783 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, burnout could apply to nonwork roles such as that of caregiver or student.

==Effects==
Some research indicates that burnout is associated with reduced [[job performance]], coronary [[heart disease]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Toker, S., Melamed, S., Berliner, S., Zeltser, D., &amp; Shapira, I.|year=2012|title=Burnout and risk of coronary heart disease: a prospective study of 8838 employees|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|volume= 74|issue=8|pages=840–847|doi=10.1097/PSY.0b013e31826c3174|pmid=23006431}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[mental health]] problems (although note the abovementioned research that suggests it is a depressive syndrome, e.g., Ahola et al., 2005&lt;ref name = "Ahola"/&gt;). Chronic burnout is also associated with cognitive impairments such as [[memory]] and [[attention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Sandstrom|first = A|author2 = Rhodin IN|author3 = Lundberg M|author4 = Olsson T|author5 = Nyberg L.|title = Impaired cognitive performance in patients with chronic burnout sysndrome.|journal = Biological Psychology|year = 2005|volume = 69|issue = 3|pages = 271–279|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301051104001553|accessdate = December 5, 2012|doi = 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2004.08.003|pmid = 15925030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occupational burnout is also associated with absences, time missed from work, and thoughts of quitting.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elliott | first1 = T. | last2 = Shewchuk | first2 = R. | last3 = Hagglund | first3 = K. | last4 = Rybarczyk | first4 = B. | last5 = Harkins | first5 = S. | year = 1996 | title = Occupational burnout, tolerance for stress, and coping among nurses in rehabilitation units | url = | journal = Rehabilitation Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = 4| pages = 267–284 | doi=10.1037/0090-5550.41.4.267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment and prevention==

=== At the individual level ===
It is difficult to treat the three symptoms of exhaustion, cynicism, and inefficacy, as they react to the same preventive or treatment activities in different ways.&lt;ref name="Hätinen-2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hätinen | first1 = M. | last2 = Kinnunen | first2 = U. | last3 = Pekkonen | first3 = M. | last4 = Kalimo | first4 = R. | year = 2007 | title = Comparing two burnout interventions: Perceived job control mediates decreases in burnout | url = | journal = International Journal of Stress Management | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 227–248 | doi=10.1037/1072-5245.14.3.227}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Exhaustion is more easily treated than cynicism and professional inefficacy, which tend to be more resistant to treatment. Research shows that intervention actually may worsen the professional efficacy of one who originally had low professional efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Dierendonck | first1 = D. | last2 = Schaufeli | first2 = W. B. | last3 = Buunk | first3 = B. P. | year = 1998 | title = The evaluation of an individual burnout intervention program: The role of inequity and social support | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 83 | issue = 3| pages = 392–407 | doi=10.1037/0021-9010.83.3.392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the purpose of preventing occupational burnout, various stress management interventions have been shown to help improve employee health and well-being in the workplace and lower stress levels. Training employees in ways to manage stress in the workplace have also proven effective in prevention of burnout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William D. McLaurine|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uRU3tG29VfUC&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=job%20burnout%20prevention&amp;pg=PA92#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title= A correlational study of job burnout and organizational commitment among correctional officers|publisher= Capella University. School of Psychology|page= 92|isbn=9780549438144}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study suggest that social-cognitive processes such as [[organizational commitment|commitment]] to work, [[self-efficacy]], learned resourcefulness and [[hope]] may insulate individuals from experiencing occupational burnout.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Increased [[Job control (workplace)|job control]] is another intervention shown to help counteract exhaustion and [[cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]] in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Hätinen-2007" /&gt;

Burnout prevention programs have traditionally focused on [[cognitive-behavioral therapy]] (CBT), [[cognitive restructuring]], didactic [[stress management]], and relaxation. CBT, [[relaxation technique]]s (including physical techniques and mental techniques), and schedule changes are the best-supported techniques for reducing and preventing burnout in a health-care specific setting. Combining both organizational and individual level activities may be the most beneficial approach to reduce symptoms. A Cochrane review reported that evidence for the efficacy of CBT in healthcare workers is of low quality, indicating that it is no better than alternative interventions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;

Employee rehabilitation is a tertiary preventive intervention which means the strategies used in rehabilitation are meant to alleviate, as well as prevent, burnout symptoms.&lt;ref name="Hätinen-2007" /&gt; Such rehabilitation of the working population includes multidisciplinary activities with the intent of maintaining and improving employees' working ability and ensuring a supply of skilled and capable labor in society.

Additional prevention methods include: starting the day with a relaxing ritual; adopting healthy eating, exercising, and sleeping habits; setting boundaries; taking breaks from technology; nourishing one's creative side, and learning how to manage stress.&lt;ref name="pat"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://health.usnews.com/health-care/for-better/articles/2017-02-27/politically-active-4-tips-for-incorporating-self-care |title=Politically Active? 4 Tips for Incorporating Self-Care, US News |date=27 February 2017 |work=US News |accessdate=5 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA2"&gt;{{cite web|authors=Smith, M., Segal, R., &amp; Segal, J.|year=2014|title=Stress Symptoms, Signs, &amp; Causes: The Effects of Stress Overload and What You Can Do About It|accessdate=31 March 2014|url=http://www.helpguide.org/mental/stress_signs.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140927114835/http://www.helpguide.org/mental/stress_signs.htm|archivedate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== At the organizational level ===
While individuals can [[Coping (psychology)|cope]] with the symptoms of burnout, the only way to truly prevent burnout is through a combination of organizational change and education for the individual.&lt;ref name="Maslach972"/&gt;

Maslach and Leiter postulated that burnout occurs when there is a disconnection between the organization and the individual with regard to what they called the six areas of work life: workload, control, reward, community, fairness, and values.&lt;ref name="Maslach01"/&gt; Resolving these discrepancies requires integrated action on the part of both the individual and the organization.&lt;ref name="Maslach01" /&gt; A better connection on workload means assuring adequate resources to meet demands as well as [[Work–life balance|work/life balances]] that encourage employees to revitalize their energy.&lt;ref name="Maslach01" /&gt; A better connection on values means clear organizational values to which employees can feel committed.&lt;ref name="Maslach01" /&gt; A better connection on community means supportive leadership and relationships with colleagues rather than discord.&lt;ref name="Maslach01" /&gt;

One approach for addressing these discrepancies focuses specifically on the fairness area. In one study employees met weekly to discuss and attempt to resolve perceived inequities in their job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = van Dierendonck|first1 = D.|last2 = Schaufeli|first2 = W. B.|last3 = Buunk|first3 = B. P.|year = 1998|title = The evaluation of an individual burnout intervention program: the role of in- equity and social support|url = |journal = J. Appl. Psychol.|volume = 83|issue = 3|pages = 392–407|doi = 10.1037/0021-9010.83.3.392}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intervention was associated with decreases in exhaustion over time but not cynicism or inefficacy, suggesting that a broader approach is required.&lt;ref name="Maslach01" /&gt;

'''Robert John Buchanan''' (22 November 1867 – 1909)&lt;ref name = FATS&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chalk|first1=Gary|last2=Holley|first2=Duncan|last3=Bull|first3=David|title=All the Saints: A Complete Players' Who's Who of Southampton FC|year=2013|location=Southampton|publisher=Hagiology Publishing|isbn=978-0-9926-8640-6|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Scottish international [[association football|footballer]], who played as a [[Striker (association football)|forward]] in the 1890s.

==Playing career==

===Early career===
Born in [[Edinburgh]],&lt;ref name = FATS/&gt; he started his career as a youth player with [[Johnstone F.C.|Johnstone]] before joining [[Abercorn F.C.|Abercorn]] in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/player_details.cfm?playerid=113239&amp;CFID=3151048&amp;CFTOKEN=14606560|title=Scottish Football Association Player profile| publisher=www.scottishfa.co.uk | accessdate=16 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst on the books of Abercorn, he made his solitary international appearance for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] on 21 March 1891 scoring in a 4–3 victory over [[Wales national football team|Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.londonhearts.com/scotland/games/18910321.html|title=Wales 3 Scotland 4| publisher=www.londonhearts.com| accessdate=16 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He then moved to England to join the short-lived [[Sunderland Albion F.C.|Sunderland Albion]].&lt;ref name = FATS/&gt;

===Burnley===
After Sunderland Albion disbanded in May 1892, he transferred to [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], playing in the [[Football League First Division]]. In [[1892–93 in English football#First Division|his first season]] he was top scorer (jointly with [[Billy Bowes]]) with eight goals from 22 appearances, helping Burnley to finish in sixth place, their highest league finish to date. The following season, Buchanan was less successful in front of goal with only four goals from his 18 appearances, but Burnley finished the season one place higher in [[1893–94 in English football#First Division|the league table]].

===Woolwich Arsenal===
In September 1894 he moved to join [[Arsenal F.C.|Woolwich Arsenal]], for [[1894–95 in English football#Second Division|1894–95]], their second season in the [[Football League Second Division]]. Playing alongside [[Peter Mortimer (footballer)|Peter Mortimer]] and [[Patrick O'Brien (footballer, born 1875)|Paddy O'Brien]], he contributed nine goals from his 25 appearances, which included a goal on his debut, in Arsenal's 4–2 win over [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] on 29 September 1894. The [[1895-96 in English football|following season]] he made 17 appearances with seven goals, switching from [[centre forward]] to [[inside left]]. In total he scored 16 goals in 44 league and cup appearances for Arsenal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arsenal.com/history/profiles/86/bob-buchanan Arsenal career summary]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southampton===
He moved to the south coast in the summer of 1896 to join [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] team [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton St. Mary's]]. The [[Southampton]] public took to him immediately and his "''never-give-up''" attitude earned him the nickname "''Death or Glory Bob''".&lt;ref name = FATS/&gt;&lt;ref name = ABC&gt;{{cite book | title=The Alphabet of the Saints|last= Holley |first= Duncan |author2=Chalk, Gary | publisher= ACL &amp; Polar Publishing | year=1992| isbn=0-9514862-3-3|pages=52–53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first season with the "Saints" he was ever-present, scoring eleven league goals as Southampton took the Southern League title for the first time. He scored a [[hat trick]] in his second appearance, a 6–1 victory over [[Sheppey United F.C.|Sheppey United]] on 26 September 1896. He also helped Southampton reach Round 2 of the [[FA Cup]] for the first time, where they went out to [[Manchester United F.C.|Newton Heath]] after a replay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Saints – A complete record|last= Chalk|first= Gary|author2=Holley, Duncan  | publisher= Breedon Books| year=1987| isbn= 0-907969-22-4|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following season, he was [[Southampton F.C. seasons|top-scorer]] with ten league and six FA Cup goals as the Saints again took the Southern League championship. Saints also had a superb run in the FA Cup reaching the [[FA Cup Semi-finals|semi final]] where they went out in a replay 2–0 to [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]. In the cup run he scored "''unlikely goals''"&lt;ref name = "ABC"/&gt; against [[Leicester Fosse F.C.|Leicester Fosse]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].

Although he remained with Southampton for the [[1898–99 in English football|1898–98 season]], he only played twice. After 57 appearances for the Saints with 33 goals, he moved back to south-east London to join [[Sheppey United F.C.|Sheppey United]].&lt;ref name = FATS/&gt;

==Later life==
On retiring from the game, he settled in  [[Sheerness]], where he worked as an engine-fitter and died in [[Southwark]] in early 1909.&lt;ref name = FATS/&gt;

==Honours==
;Southampton
* [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] championship: [[Southern Football League 1896-97|1896–97]] &amp; [[Southern Football League 1897-98|1897–98]]

Hill. "The Role of Religion and Spirituality in Mental and Physical Health." Current Directions in Psychological Science 10(2001):21-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the nuanced definitions of spirituality and religiosity, the literature on spirituality is not consistent in definitions or measures resulting in a lack of coherence. However, taken as a whole, research tends to show that the effect of spirituality is positive, associated with better health outcomes.&lt;ref name="seybold" /&gt;&lt;ref name="douglas"&gt;Douglas, Amber N., Sherlyn Jimenez, Hsiu-Ju Lin, and Linda K. Frisman. "Ethnic Differences in the Effects of Spiritual Well-Being on Long-Term Psychological and Behavioral Outcomes Within a Sample of Homeless Women." Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology 14(2008):344-352.&lt;/ref&gt; For those who engage in spirituality, it may serve as a buffer from negative life events, often moderating the relationship between negative life experiences and levels of anxiety or depression.&lt;ref name="young"&gt;Young, J. Scott, Craig S. Cashwell, and Julia Shcherbakova. "The Moderating Relationship of Spirituality on Negative Life Events and Psychological Adjustment." Counseling and Values 45(2000):49-55.&lt;/ref&gt; The exception is when negative spiritual coping is practiced. This type of coping has negative health implications.

The [[homelessness|homeless]] are a vulnerable population that experiences the moderating effect of spirituality; spirituality plays a role in their emotional and mental capacity to handle challenges they face and practice health-promoting behaviors. For the homeless who practice spirituality as a positive coping mechanism, it often improves their life and is cited as a source of strength and comfort in qualitative research.

==Spirituality==

===Definition===
Spirituality does not have a clear definition, though it is generally regarded as the search for and experience of the sacred, meaning God, a higher power, or something of divine nature.&lt;ref name="Hodge"&gt;Hodge, David R., Stephanie E. Moser, and Michael S. Shafer. “Spirituality and Mental Health Among Homeless Mothers.” Social Work Research 36(2012):1-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="george"&gt;George, Linda K., David B. Larson, Harold G. Koenig, and Michael E. Mccullough. "Spirituality and Health: What We Know, What We Need to Know." Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology 19(2000):102-116.&lt;/ref&gt; Spirituality is characterized as something experienced personally, an individualized process that involves personal or private beliefs.&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brush"&gt;Brush, Barbara L., and Eileen M. McGee. “Evaluating the Spiritual Perspectives of Homeless Men in Recovery.” Applied Nursing Research 13(2000):181-186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hurl"&gt;Hurlbut, Jene M., Leslie K. Robbins, and Mary M. Hoke. “Correlations Between Spirituality and Health-Promoting Behaviors Among Sheltered Homeless Women.” Journal of Community Health Nursing 28(2011):81-91.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it may involve the values of community and relationship, or an emphasis on the connectedness of people. Spirituality often emphasizes the integration of mind, body and spirit, and it can provide a sense of purpose or life significance.&lt;ref name="brush" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hurl" /&gt;

There is considerable overlap in the definitions of religion and spirituality and, for this reason, they are often used interchangeably in the literature.&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt; [[Religion]], like spirituality, can provide people a sense of purpose or meaning through personal beliefs. The main distinguishing factor between religion and spirituality is that religion is generally practiced collectively with some type of structural or institutional reinforcement.&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="george" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hurl" /&gt; Both terms are multi-faceted and are typically measured along similar dimensions.&lt;ref name=seybold /&gt; Common dimensions of spirituality/religion as defined by the National Institute of Healthcare Research and NIA/Fetzer Institute are as follows:&lt;ref name="seybold" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="george" /&gt;

* Preference or affiliation: membership in a specific religious or spiritual group
* Public practices: involvement in formal activities such as attendances at services
* Private practices: private behaviors such as prayer, mediation, or reading sacred texts
* Spiritual experiences: interaction or experience with the divine manifested in feelings and sensations
* Spiritual coping: how an individual uses beliefs to cope with stressful events; can be positive or negative 
* Beliefs and values: specific beliefs and values
* Forgiveness: experience of reconciliation with others and with the divine, can be a form of spiritual coping
* Social support: intangible and tangible support offered by other members of the spiritual/religious community
* Intensity/commitment: importance of spirituality relative to other areas of life and its effect on behavior
* Spiritual meaning: sense of purpose and meaning of one's life as a result of spirituality

These dimensions are simply two examples of measures used in the literature on spirituality. Because of the nebulous definition of spirituality in the literature, measures are not consistent across different studies resulting in a lack of coherence in the literature. However, there is a consensus in research done on spirituality that it influences health. This effect is generally positive with the exception of negative spiritual coping.

===Effect on physical health===
Spiritual wellbeing has been associated with positive physical [[health]] outcomes in research.&lt;ref name="seybold" /&gt;&lt;ref name="douglas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="george" /&gt; Spirituality reduces the likelihood of illness and is strongly related to increased longevity.&lt;ref name="george" /&gt; For example, it lowers the rate of heart disease, cirrhosis, emphysema, stroke, kidney failure, cancer mortality, overall mortality.&lt;ref name="seybold" /&gt; Spirituality also decreases blood pressure and cholesterol levels.&lt;ref name="seybold" /&gt; If someone does become ill or must endure surgery, they are likely to endure a better recovery.&lt;ref name="george" /&gt; These effects may vary depending on the strictness of behavioral codes associated with a religion, the intensity of the person's practice of spirituality, and whether or not their spiritual experience is a positive one.&lt;ref name="seybold" /&gt;&lt;ref name="george" /&gt; If someone uses negative spiritual coping, the positive health benefits will not happen and the individual's health may be influenced negatively (see religious/spiritual coping section).&lt;ref name="seybold" /&gt;

===Effect on mental health===
Spirituality tends to improve [[mental health]].&lt;ref name="seybold" /&gt;&lt;ref name="george" /&gt; Spirituality is associated with lower rates of suicide, anxiety disorders, and [[depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref name="seybold" /&gt;&lt;ref name="george" /&gt; In regards to depression, individuals who are more spiritually involved are more likely to recover.&lt;ref name="seybold" /&gt; In a review of forty-three studies, Rew and Wong (2006) found that religiosity and spirituality are important correlates of adolescent health with 84% of the literature indicating a positive correlation.&lt;ref name="rew"&gt;Rew, Lynn, and Y. Joel Wong. "A Systematic Review of Associations Among Religiosity/Spirituality and Adolescent Health Attitudes and Behaviors." Journal of Adolescent Health 38(2006):433-442.&lt;/ref&gt; Spirituality also reduces the likelihood of drug/alcohol dependency or abuse and is associated with a more effective recovery from [[substance use disorder|abuse/dependence]].&lt;ref name="seybold" /&gt; While spirituality generally improves mental health, for individuals who use harmful forms of religious coping, spirituality is "correlated with impaired mental health and poorer resolution of negative life events."&lt;ref name="seybold" /&gt;

===Religious/spiritual coping===
There are two types of spiritual coping, positive and negative. Positive spiritual coping manifests itself as a strong relationship with God, seeking support from the community and a higher power, looking for meaning in life and helping others.&lt;ref name="par"&gt;Pargament, Kenneth I., Bruce W. Smith, Harold G. Koening, and Lisa Perez. "Patterns of Positive and Negative Religious Coping with Major Life Stressors." Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion 37(1998): 710-724.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wachholtz"&gt;Wachholtz, Amy B., Michelle J. Pearce, Harold Koenig. "Exploring the Relationship between Spirituality, Coping, and Pain." Journal of Behavioral Medicine 30(2007):311-318.&lt;/ref&gt; Most people who practice spirituality engage in positive spiritual coping which is associated with improved mental and physical health.&lt;ref name="par" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wachholtz" /&gt;

Negative spiritual coping, a pattern distinct from positive spiritual coping, has negative health implications. Negative spiritual coping involves deferring all responsibility to God, feeling abandoned by God or blaming God for difficulties.&lt;ref name="wachholtz" /&gt; It often manifests itself as a less secure relationship with God, an ominous worldview and general spiritual discontent.&lt;ref name="par" /&gt; For those who engage in negative spiritual coping, it is related to significantly poorer physical and mental health outcomes as well as higher mortality.&lt;ref name="wachholtz" /&gt; In a study done by Pargament (1998), negative spiritual coping had differing negative health implications among different populations. For citizens of Oklahoma City who experienced the federal building bombing, it was associated with more post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms and higher levels of callousness. For college students, negative spiritual coping was associated with higher levels of emotional distress and poorer physical health. For hospital patients with physical ailments, negative spiritual coping was associated with higher levels of depression and lower quality of life.&lt;ref name="par" /&gt;

==Role of spirituality in the lives of homeless people==
A homeless person is an individual without a consistent, fixed nighttime residence or someone whose nighttime residence is a supervised shelter that provides temporary housing.&lt;ref name="run"&gt;Runquist, Jennifer J., and Pamela G. Reed. "Self-Transcendence and Well-Being in Homeless Adults." Journal of Holistic Nursing 25(2007):5-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Homelessness is a chronic stressor producing reduced wellbeing.&lt;ref name="irwin"&gt;Irwin, Jay, Mark LaGory, Ferris Ritchey, and Kevin Fitzpatrick. "Social Assets and Mental Distress Among the Homeless: Exploring the Roles of Social Support and Other Forms of Social Capital on Depression." Social Science and Medicine 67(2008): 1935-1943.&lt;/ref&gt; Homeless populations are a vulnerable population experiencing a higher prevalence of mental and physical health problems as well as victimization and increased mortality rates.&lt;ref name="run" /&gt; Spirituality is one method some homeless individuals use to cope with their position of high vulnerability. Runquist and Reed (2007) found that spiritual perspective correlated positively with measures of wellbeing among the sample of homeless individuals surveyed and that measures of wellbeing correlated positively with self-rated health status.&lt;ref name="run" /&gt; Social capital resulting from spirituality or religion, according to Irwin (2008), is a critical factor to wellbeing among homeless populations. It increases the resource base of the individual enabling them to cope with their situation in healthier ways.&lt;ref name="irwin" /&gt;

===Youth===
[[street children|Youth]], typically defined as people between the ages of twelve and twenty-four, make up a large portion of the homeless population.&lt;ref name="bend"&gt;Bender, Kimberly, Sanna J. Thompson, Holly McManus, Janet Lantry and Patrick M. Flynn. "Capacity for Survival: Exploring Strengths of Homeless Street Youth." Child Youth Care Forum 36(2007):25-42.&lt;/ref&gt; As they are a transient population, it is difficult to get an accurate count of homeless youth; the number is commonly thought to be somewhere between 1.3 and 2 million.&lt;ref name="ferg"&gt;Ferguson, Kristin M., Qiaobing Wu, Grace Dyrness, and Donna Spruijt-Metz. "Perceptions of Faith and Outcomes in Faith-based Programs for Homeless Youth: A Grounded Theory Approach." Journal of Social Service Research 33(2007):25-42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kid"&gt;Kidd, Sean A. "Street Youth: Coping and Interventions." Child and Adolescent Social Work Journal 20(2003):235-260.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="li"&gt;Lindsey, Elizabeth W., David Kurtz, Sara Jarvis, Nancy R. Williams, and Lary Nackerud. "How Runaway and Homeless Youth Navigate Troubled Waters: Personal Strengths and Resources." Child and Adolescent Social Work Journal 17(2000):115-142.&lt;/ref&gt; These youth have higher rates of mental health disorders, suicide, and drug/alcohol dependency due to the high amount of stressors in their lives.&lt;ref name="kid" /&gt;

Spirituality is one of many coping mechanisms homeless youth employ in order to manage life on the streets as well as techniques such as avoidant coping, use of alcohol, interpersonal skills, problem-focused coping and self-reliance.&lt;ref name="bend" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kid" /&gt; Spirituality as a coping mechanism often serves as positive force in the lives of homeless youth.&lt;ref name="bend" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="li" /&gt; Kidd (2003) surveyed 80 street youth on the topic of coping and found that spirituality gave meaning to suffering, enabling the youth to process negative emotion and retain some hope.&lt;ref name="kid" /&gt; In interviews done by Lindsey et al. (2000), spirituality served as a resource to youth and empowered those engaged in spirituality to redirect their lives in a healthy manner.&lt;ref name="li" /&gt; A theme across multiple studies the coping mechanisms of homeless youth is that their beliefs act as a source of strength and comfort; many attribute their ability to survive to the direct intervention of a higher power or to their faith.&lt;ref name="bend" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="li" /&gt; One individual in a group discussion conducted by Bender (2007) commented on his engagement with the divine as a source of comfort and survival saying, "The man upstairs is what helps me. Just knowing that he's there. There may be times when I feel like he's not there, but he's helping me out slowly."&lt;ref name="bend" /&gt;

These positive effects of spirituality appear largely in qualitative work, meaning that the youth themselves associate spirituality with improved coping and better mental health. Youth who do not engage in spirituality thus do not use it as a coping mechanism and do not comment on it. There are no examples of negative religious coping among the youth in the studies cited. However, a quantitative study conducted by Kidd and Carroll revealed that spirituality was not associated with a lower [[suicide]] risk in homeless youth.&lt;ref name="kidd"&gt;Kidd, Sean A., and Michelle R. Carroll. "Coping and Suicidality Among Homeless Youth." Journal of Adolescence 30(2007):283-296.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Homeless (8329924557).jpg|thumb|Homeless man]]

===Men===
For homeless men, specifically those suffering from a substance abuse problem or who are in crisis, spirituality often serves as a positive coping mechanism, giving meaning to life and is tied to a sense of peace.&lt;ref name="murray"&gt;Murray, Ruth Beckmann. "Stressors and Coping Strategies of Homeless Men." Journal of Psychosocial Nursing and Mental Health Services 34(1996):16-22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brush" /&gt; However, positive spiritual coping lessens in its effectiveness the longer someone is homeless and is not as effective for homeless men with mental health problems as for those who are alcohol/drug dependent or in crisis.&lt;ref name="murray" /&gt; Many homeless men attribute their ability to get sober to their spirituality, though this may be a product of the spiritual nature of programs like [[Alcoholics Anonymous]].&lt;ref name="brush" /&gt; In a study done by Brush and McGee (2000) surveying homeless men in a shelter for recovery, 78% of the respondents commented on how their spiritual views influence their decisions and two thirds agreed or strongly agreed "to seeking spiritual guidance in daily life experiences."&lt;ref name="brush" /&gt;

===Women===
Women are the fastest growing segment of the homeless population, making up an estimated 32% of the population.&lt;ref name="douglas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hurl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gre"&gt;Greene, Jeanie Ahearn, Kim Ball, John R. Belcher, and Catherine McAlphine. "Substance Abuse, Homelessness, Developmental Decision-Making and Spirituality: A Women's Health Issue." Journal of Social Work Practice in the Addictions 3(2003):39-54.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these women are single mothers.&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt; African American women are disproportionately represented among homeless populations as a result of their increased vulnerability to socioeconomic structures.&lt;ref name="douglas" /&gt; Homeless women, irrespective of ethnicity, tend to have more health problems than the general public including higher rates of substance abuse and mental health issues, as well as prior victimization.&lt;ref name="douglas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hurl" /&gt;

Spirituality is used as a coping mechanism by many women of various ethnicities to deal with the stress of being homeless and/or to recover from substance abuse.&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gre" /&gt; It serves as a source of emotional support as well as a motivating force for women to take care of themselves and their families in a healthy way.&lt;ref name="hurl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gre" /&gt; Many accredit God with their survival and ability to be clean, looking to their spirituality to guide them in parenting.&lt;ref name="gre" /&gt; In a study by Shuler (1994), 42% of homeless women surveyed said their beliefs gave them strength and helped them survive.&lt;ref name="shuler"&gt;Shuler, Pamela A., Lillian Gelberg, and Marie Brown. "The Effects of Spiritual/Religious Practices on Psychological Well-Being Among Inner City Homeless Women." Nurse Practitioner Forum 5(1994):106-113.&lt;/ref&gt; For the women who considered prayer an effective coping mechanism, they experienced considerably less worries and depressive symptoms.&lt;ref name="shuler" /&gt; Increased spirituality is associated with less substance abuse; for women who do not use drugs or alcohol, religious/moral beliefs are often the basis of their decision.&lt;ref name="hurl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ny"&gt;Nyamathi, Adeline, Linda Bayley, Nancy Anderson, Colleen Keenan, and Barbara Leake. "Perceived Factors Influencing the Initiation of Drug and Alcohol Use Among Homeless Women and Reported Consequences of Use." Women and Health 29(1999):99-114.&lt;/ref&gt; Higher levels of spirituality is also associated with a lowered risk of depression and suicide among homeless women as well as increased health-promoting behaviors.&lt;ref name="hurl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gre" /&gt;

====African-American women====
Research shows that African Americans as a population, especially women, tend to have higher levels of religious involvement and deep ties to faith and spirituality.&lt;ref name="douglas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="washington"&gt;Washington, Olivia G. M., David P. Moxley, Lois Garriott, Jennifer P. Weinberger. "Five Dimensions of Faith and Spirituality of Older African American Women Transitioning Out of Homelessness." Journal of Religious Health 48(2009):431-444.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the case for homeless African American women as well; spirituality plays a larger role as a coping mechanism for African American homeless women than other women.&lt;ref name="douglas" /&gt; Douglas et al. (2008) found that homeless African American women placed a higher importance on spirituality and that lower rates of spiritual well-being among African American homeless mothers resulted in higher anxiety, increased trauma, punitive parenting and child behavioral issues. A study done by Washington et al. (2009) in which older African American homeless women were interviewed found that spirituality was an important asset for these women. Through their faith, they felt empowered to take control of their lives.&lt;ref name="washington" /&gt; These women's experience of spirituality also had a mediating effect on their worries and concerns.&lt;ref name="washington" /&gt;

'''Stochastic terrorism''' is an "obscure and non-legal"&lt;ref name="rolling-stone"/&gt; term describing speech that can be expected to incite terrorism as an act of stochastic terrorism, with the word "stochastic" describing the random nature of the targets.&lt;ref name=Hamm2017/&gt;  The "stochastic terrorist" does not direct the actions of members of a group, rather, he is an ideologue speaking over mass media to individuals with who he is not affiliated as part of any form of organization.&lt;ref name=Hamm2017/&gt;  Instead, he depends on "the use of mass media to provoke random acts of ideologically motivated violence that are statistically predictable but individually unpredictable".&lt;ref name=Hamm2017&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hamm |first1=Mark S. |last2=Spaaij |first2=Ramón |date=2017 |title=The Age of Lone Wolf Terrorism |location=New York |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-54377-4 |lccn=2016050672 |pages=84-89}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an anonymous blogger posting on the [[Daily Kos]], the speaker, whether intentionally or not, [[Incitement|incites]] those with a combination of personality traits that leads them to violence. Since the speaker only focuses animus towards the victim instead of directly participating, they may escape culpability and the perpetrator may be labeled a [[Lone wolf (terrorism)|lone wolf]] by law enforcement.&lt;ref name=dailykos&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2011/1/10/934890/-Stochastic-Terrorism:-Triggering-the-shooters|title=Stochastic Terrorism:  Triggering the shooters.|work=Daily Kos|access-date=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=September 2017}} The term has mostly been applied to domestic American incidents of violence.&lt;ref name="Hamm2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rolling-stone"/&gt;

In their 2017 book, [[Age of Lone Wolf Terrorism]],&lt;ref name="Hamm2017"/&gt; criminologist Mark S. Hamm and sociologist Ramón Spaaij discuss stochastic terrorism as a form of "indirect enabling" of terrorists. They write that "stochastic terrorism is the method of international recruitment used by [[ISIS]]", and they refer to [[Anwar al-Awlaki]] and [[Alex_Jones_(radio_host)|Alex Jones]] as stochastic terrorists.&lt;ref name="Hamm2017"/&gt;{{rp|157}} They note that:&lt;ref name="Hamm2017"/&gt;

{{quote|What often matters most in stochastic terrorism is the emotional intensity of the messaging and the way it is socially constructed or interpreted by the consumer, not the intentions of the messenger. In other words, the messenger does not have to actively promote violence for it to occur.}}

Hamm and Spaaij discuss two instances of violence that "shine a light on the phenomenon of stochastic terrorism in the post-9/11 era."&lt;ref name="Hamm2017"/&gt; In the [[2010 Oakland freeway shootout]], Byron Williams was said to be en route to offices of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and the [[Tides (organization)|Tides Foundation]], planning to commit mass murder, "indirectly enabled by the conspiracy theories"&lt;ref name="Hamm2017"/&gt; of [[Glenn Beck]] and [[Alex Jones]]. As a left-wing example, they cite the [[Family_Research_Council#2012_shooting_incident|2012 shooting incident]] at the headquarters of the [[Family Research Council]]. Hamm and Spaaij say the shooter's  radicalization was indirectly enabled by his reading a report in an online magazine of the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], which "featured a 'Hate Map' giving the exact location of FRC headquarters."

Note that the phrase "stochastic terrorism model" typically does not refer to this concept of stochastic terrorism as a form of incitement. That is, a stochastic terrorism model is usually a [[Stochastic process|stochastic]], that is, random, [[Mathematical model|model]] of terror attacks intended by the random nature of their timing and targets to excite a generalized fear.&lt;ref name=Woo2002&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Woo |first1=Gordon |date=2002 |title=Quantitative terrorism risk assessment |journal=Journal of Risk Finance |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=7-14 |doi=10.1108/eb022949 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage to describe incitement==
After the [[2011 Tucson shooting]], the [[Daily Kos]]' "diarist" (blogger) G2geek posted "Stochastic Terrorism: Triggering the shooters." While saying it wasn't immediately clear that the murderer [[Jared Lee Loughner]] was triggered, G2geek accused [[Osama Bin Laden]] and personalities such as [[Glenn Beck]], [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], and [[Sean Hannity]] of inciting perpetrators such as [[Jim David Adkisson]], [[Scott Roeder]], and [[Byron Williams (shooter)|Byron Williams]].&lt;ref name=dailykos /&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=September 2017}} ''[[Rawstory]]'' said that the 2015 [[Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood shooting]] was incited by far-right Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tarico|first1=Valerie|title=Here's how far-right Christians incited stochastic terrorism at a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood|url=http://www.rawstory.com/2015/12/heres-how-far-right-christians-incited-stochastic-terrorism-at-a-colorado-springs-planned-parenthood/|website=Raw Story|accessdate=4 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An op-ed in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' referred to then presidential-candidate [[Donald Trump]]'s comment during one of his 2016 campaign rallies as stochastic terrorism. Trump said of his opponent [[Hillary Clinton]]: "If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks. Although the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] people, maybe there is. I don't know".&lt;ref name="rolling-stone"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cohen|first1=David S.|title=Trump's Assassination Dog Whistle Was Even Scarier Than You Think|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/trumps-assassination-dog-whistle-was-scarier-than-you-think-w433615|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=4 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crockett|first1=Emily|title=Trump's 2nd Amendment comment wasn't a joke.

==Concerns about usage==
[[CNN]]'s legal analyst Danny Cevallos opinion piece said Trump's comment was likely protected speech, even against a presidential candidate, because it wasn't directed to inciting imminent unlawful action. And with respect to it being stochastic terrorism added, "It's scary, and probably true.... It's hard to predict or measure the effect with any certainty."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/10/opinions/trump-second-amendment-remarks-cevallos/index.html|title=Did Trump comments break the law?|last=Cevallos|first=Danny|work=CNN|access-date=2017-09-27|quote=Some legal scholars have observed that Trump has engaged in 'stochastic terrorism,' using language and other forms of communication 'to incite random actors to carry out violent or terrorist acts that are statistically predictable but individually unpredictable.'&amp;nbsp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phase "Scripted Violence" has been used in social science since at least 2010. As Darrell Y. Hamamoto argues, the concept of "scripted violence" provides "a sorely-needed corrective to the under-theorization of race and racism in understanding acts of scripted violence within hyper-militarized society." Hamamoto also suggests that "serial killing and mass murder are examples of civilian "blowback" that originates with heightened US military adventurism in the postwar period.
&lt;ref name="Hamamoto-2002"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Empire of Death: Militarized Society and the Rise of Serial Killing and Mass Murder | author=Hamamoto, Darrell Y. | journal=New Political Science | year=2002 | volume=24 | issue=1 | pages=105-120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in a sentence==
A stochastic terrorist is a [[demagogue]] who uses the rhetoric of scripted violence (such as  [[demonization]] or [[scapegoating]]) to portray a target group as involved in a malevolent [[conspiracy]] to undermine the society or nation, and thus prompt most acts of [[stochastic terrorism]]. See, for example, the work on demonization and scapegoating of scholars [[Hannah Arendt]] and [[Gordon Allport]].

The '''substitution hypothesis''' or '''twin hypothesis''' states that the sightings of a risen [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] are explained not by physical [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]], but by the existence of a different person, a twin or lookalike who could have impersonated Jesus after his death, or died in the place of Jesus on the [[crucifixion|cross]]. It is a position held by some [[Gnostic]]s in the first to third century, as well as some modern [[Mandaeans]], [[Muslim]]s and, many Japanese Christians .

==Christian and Gnostic traditions==
The ''[[Book of Thomas the Contender]]'', a Gnostic text thought to have been written in the late second or the third century,&lt;ref&gt;John D. Turner, ''The Anchor Bible Dictionary'', volume 6, p. 529.&lt;/ref&gt; cites Jesus as stating, when speaking to [[Thomas the Apostle]], "[I]t has been said that you are my twin and true companion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=John|title=The Nag Hammadi Library: The Book of Thomas the Contender|url=http://gnosis.org/naghamm/bookt.html|website=The Gnostic Society Library|publisher=Coptic Gnostic Library Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Additionally, the third century text ''Acts of Thomas'' (not to be confused with the [[Gospel of Thomas]]) contains an episode in which the risen Jesus appears "in the likeness of" Thomas the Apostle, and is subsequently mistaken for Thomas by a king.&lt;ref&gt;Bart D. Erhman, ''Lost Scriptures: Books that Did Not Make It into the New Testament'', p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; However, these early texts do not expressly put forward any sort of substitution hypothesis with respect to the death and resurrection of Jesus. 

The ''[[Second Treatise of the Great Seth]]'', a Gnostic text from the third century, claims that [[Simon of Cyrene]] was crucified in the place of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Bart D. Erhman, ''Lost Scriptures: Books that Did Not Make It into the New Testament'', p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; The text is written from the first-person narrative perspective of Jesus, attributing to Jesus statements such as "I was laughing at their ignorance" when the crowd mistakenly crucifies Simon of Cyrene, and asserting that this deception was made possible because "I [Jesus] was altering my shapes, changing from form to form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bullard|first1=Roger|last2=Gibbons|first2=Joseph|title=The Nag Hammadi Library: The Second Treatise of the Great Seth|url=http://gnosis.org/naghamm/2seth.html|website=The Gnostic Society Library|publisher=Coptic Gnostic Library Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Gospel of Barnabas]]'' describes Jesus escaping crucifixion through being raised alive to heaven by a committee of holy angels; afterwards, [[Judas Iscariot]] is supernaturally transformed to look identical to Jesus, and is subsequently crucified in Jesus' place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ragg|first1=Laura|last2=Lonsdale|first2=|title=The Gospel of Barnabas|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/isl/gbar/index.htm|website=Internet Sacred Text Archive|publisher=Evinity Publishing, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning its date of composition, few academics argue that the [[Gospel of Barnabas]] was composed any earlier than the 14th century, although a minority of scholars see it as containing portions of an earlier work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cirillo|first1=Luigi|last2=Fremaux|first2=Michael|title=Évangile de Barnabé|date=1977|publisher=Beauchesne|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul William Roberts]] reports in his 1995 travel narrative ''[[Journey of the Magi: In Search of the Birth of Jesus]]'', that some contemporary [[Mandaeans]] hold that [[Thomas the Apostle]] was the twin brother of Jesus and was crucified in Jesus' place.

The etymology of ''Thomas'' with respect to [[Thomas the Apostle]] and the name [[Jude (brother of Jesus)|Judas]] (distinct from [[Judas Iscariot]]) that he is given in various early texts and traditions is alluded to by some as evidence of Jesus having had a twin.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}
  
Many Japanese christians believe Jesus had a brother named Isukiri who actually crucified on the cross.After surviving Crucifixion ,Jesus then went to Japan and died there.  See:[[ Shingō, Aomori]]

==Islamic perspective==
{{Main|Islamic view of Jesus' death}}
A verse in the [[Qur'an]] saying of Jesus that "they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|4|157|e=158|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been interpreted by many Muslims to mean that a different man who only appeared to be Jesus died in his place. Muslim scholars do not agree on the identity of the substitute, but he is often thought to have been one of the Apostles or Simon of Cyrene.
 
Muslim scholar Ibn Abbas wrote that a Roman soldier named Tatianos crucified instead of Jesus in his Quranic commentary .&lt;ref&gt;http://altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=2&amp;tTafsirNo=73&amp;tSoraNo=4&amp;tAyahNo=157&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;UserProfile=0www.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*The ''[[Red Dwarf (TV series)|Red Dwarf]]'' [[Red Dwarf (series 10)|series ten]] episode "[[Lemons (Red Dwarf)|Lemons]]" includes the idea that Judas was actually the twin brother of Jesus, who died in his place to 'fake' the resurrection and spread Jesus' gospel.

'''Talal Maddah''' (5 August 1940 – 11 August 2000; {{lang-ar|طلال مدَّاح}}) was a Saudi musician and composer. He was named Maddah after his mother's family. His fans called him "The Earth's Voice" ({{lang-ar|صوت الارض}}), and he was also known as "The Golden Throat" ({{lang-ar|الحنجرة الذهبية}}). He had a substantial influence over 20th century-Arabian culture.

== Professional career ==
Talal Maddah began his career emulating [[Hijazi]] singers such as [[Hassan Jawa]] and [[Mohammed Ali Sindi]]. During his career, he participated in many festivals in [[Saudi Arabia]] between 1960 and 2000. He also participated in many festivals in the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]], [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Libya]].

=== Early career ===
Maddah was born in [[Mecca]], Saudi Arabia. He was raised by his uncle.

Maddah began singing in school concerts when he was student in [[Ta'if|Al-Taif]]. Abdul Rahman Khundaneh, one of Maddah's classmates, played the [[oud]] and became his accompanist. Since the two boys had to keep the oud at Maddah's house to hide it from Khundaneh's father, Maddah also learned to play the instrument.

In the mid-1950s, Maddah attended a wedding in Al-Taif that featured a selection of artists such as [[Tariq Abdul-Hakim]], [[Abdullah Mohammed]] and [[Abdullah Morshidi]]. Maddah was astonished to see a concert with a full orchestra. At the concert, he was introduced to [[Abbas Fayegg Ghazzawi]] who was then a director at Radio Jeddah. Ghazzawi encouraged him to come to record his first songs. Maddah's first song is called "Wardak Ya Zarea Al Ward" (Grower of Roses, Arabic: وردك يا زارع الورد). The song was a success and was played on the radio daily in the mid-1950s.

In the 1960s, Talal Maddah became famous due to the birth of Saudi Arabia's official radio. Along with other artists like [[Muhammad Ali Sindi]], [[Fawzi Mhasson]] and [[Abdullah Mohammed]], he was one of the most popular singers of the era.

=== The Arab world ===
Gradually, his music was introduced to the rest of the Arab world after his songs were played in [[Cairo]]. Egyptian composers like [[Mohammed Abdel Wahab]], [[Mohammed Al Mogy]] and [[Baligh Hamdi]] began to write songs for him. In 1976, he had his first pan-Arab hit with "Muqadir".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sebastian Maisel|author2=John A. Shoup|title=Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Arab States Today:|date=2009|publisher=Greenwood Publishing House|isbn=0313344426|page=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of his long career, Maddah collaborated with many composers, including Ibrahim Raafat, Gamal Salama, Tariq Abdul Hakim, Abu Bakr Salem Belfkih, Sami Ihsan and  Mohammed Shafiq. He also discovered and trained fellow [[Khaliji (music)|Khaliji]] singer Abadi al Johar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Abadi al Johar: From nightclub singer to sell-out concert performer!|url=https://www.albawaba.com/entertainment/abadi-al-johar-nightclub-singer-sell-out-concert-performer-719550|work=Al Bawaba|date=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cinema ==
Talal Maddah starred in a single movie, ''Fog Street'' (شارع الضباب), in 1965 with Lebanese singer [[Sabah (singer)|Sabah]].

== Talal Maddah albums ==
{{Main|Talal Maddah albums}}
Maddah recorded about 66 official albums and 40 other albums.

==Death==
Maddah collapsed and died suddenly of a heart attack on ''Al Meftaha'' Stage (Arabic: مسرح المفتاحة) in front of his fans shortly after he performed an intro to one of his famous songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Saudi singer dies|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/876548.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=11 August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concert was aired live on Saudi National Television. Later on, the official Saudi [[Saudi Press Agency|news agency]] made a statement confirming his death and made a tribute to him and to his legacy.

Maddah's funeral was held in the city of [[Jeddah]]. He is buried in [[Makkah]].

==Awards==
Maddah was the first Saudi artist to receive awards outside of Saudi Arabia. He received the Altkarimip Prize from [[Habib Bourguiba]], the former president of [[Tunisia]]. [[Muammar Gaddafi]] and [[Hosni Mubarak]] also gave him awards. In 1984, King [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia]] awarded Maddah the Order of Merit of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques for his work.

==Dedication==
Talal Maddah was the subject of a [[Google Doodle]] on 5 August 2018, the 78th anniversary of his birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.google.com/doodles/talal-maddahs-78th-birthday|title=Talal Maddah’s 78th Birthday|last=|first=|date=5 August 2018|work=Google|access-date=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Theory of Colours''''' (German: ''Zur Farbenlehre'') is a book by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] about the poet's views on the nature of [[color|colours]] and how these are perceived by humans. It was published in German in 1810 and in English in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=  |first=  |title= Goethe's Theory of Colours: Translated from the German; with Notes by Charles Lock Eastlake, R.A., F.R.S |publisher= John Murray |place= London |url= https://archive.org/stream/goethestheoryco01goetgoog#page/n6/mode/2up |year= 1840 |accessdate= 18 October 2017 |via= Internet Archive |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161212075843/https://archive.org/stream/goethestheoryco01goetgoog#page/n6/mode/2up |archivedate= 12 December 2016 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book contains detailed descriptions of phenomena such as [[Complementary colors|coloured shadows]], [[refraction]], and [[chromatic aberration]].

The work originated in Goethe's occupation with painting and mainly exerted an influence on the arts ([[Philipp Otto Runge]], [[J.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;W. Turner]], the [[Pre-Raphaelites]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]]). The book is a successor to two short essays entitled "Contributions to Optics".

Although Goethe's work was rejected by physicists, a number of philosophers and physicists have concerned themselves with it, including [[Thomas Johann Seebeck]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] (see: ''[[On&amp;nbsp;Vision and Colors]]''), [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], [[Rudolf Steiner]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Werner Heisenberg]], [[Kurt Gödel]], and [[Mitchell Feigenbaum]].

Goethe's book provides a catalogue of how colour is perceived in a wide variety of circumstances, and considers [[Isaac Newton]]'s observations to be special cases.&lt;ref name="Ribe;Steinle"&gt;Neil Ribe, Friedrich Steinle: [https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.1506750 Exploratory Experimentation: Goethe, Land, and Color Theory] ''[[Physics Today]]'', July 2002, retrieved July 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Newton, Goethe's concern was not so much with the analytic treatment of colour, as with the qualities of how phenomena are perceived. Philosophers have come to understand the distinction between the [[optical spectrum]], as observed by Newton, and the phenomenon of human colour perception as presented by Goethe—a subject analyzed at length by [[Wittgenstein]] in his comments on Goethe's theory in ''[[Remarks on Colour]]''.

== Historical background ==
[[File:Goethe-Prism-FigI.jpg|thumb|250px|Reddish-yellow edges overlap blue-cyan edges to form green.]]
At Goethe's time, it was generally acknowledged that, as [[Isaac Newton]] had shown in his ''[[Opticks]]'' in 1704, colourless (white) [[light]] is split up into its component [[color|colours]] when directed through a [[prism (optics)|prism]].&lt;ref&gt;Karl Robert Mandelkow: Goethes Briefe (''Goethe's Letters''). 2.&amp;nbsp;edition. Vol.&amp;nbsp;2: Briefe der Jahre 1786–1805 (''Letters of the years 1786–1805''). ''Christian Wegner'' publishers, Hamburg 1968, p.&amp;nbsp;528. "das zentrale Axiom von Newtons Farbentheorie, daß in dem weißen, farblosen Licht alle Farben enthalten seien" (''"the central axiom of Newton's colour theory that there were all colours in the white, colourless light"'')&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Along with the rest of the world I was convinced that all the colours are contained in the light; no one had ever told me anything different, and I had never found the least cause to doubt it, because I had no further interest in the subject.}}

{{quote|But how I was astonished, as I looked at a white wall through the prism, that it stayed white! That only where it came upon some darkened area, it showed some colour, then at last, around the window sill all the colours shone... It didn't take long before I knew here was something significant about colour to be brought forth, and I spoke as through an instinct out loud, that the Newtonian teachings were false.|Goethe&lt;ref&gt;Goethe, Goethes Werke, Weimar: Hermann Böhlau, 1887–1919, II. Abtheilung: Naturwissenschaftlichte Schriften, Bd. 4, pp. 295–296&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Goethe's starting point was the supposed discovery of how Newton erred in the prismatic experiment,&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei, Rupprecht. Über die Anfänge von Goethes Farbenlehre (''On the beginnings of Goethe's Theory of Colours''). In: Jahrbuch der [[Goethe-Gesellschaft]] (''Yearbook of the Goethe Society'') 11, 1949, p.&amp;nbsp;259, cited in Karl Robert Mandelkow: Goethes Briefe (''Goethe's Letters''). 2.&amp;nbsp;edition.

(''"Goethe's starting point, the discovery of the Newton error, as he called it, in the prismatic experiment, dwindled from his horizon according to how he began to sense the meaning of the Physiological Colours."'')&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1793 Goethe had formulated his arguments against Newton in the essay "Über Newtons Hypothese der diversen Refrangibilität" (''"On Newton's hypothesis of diverse refrangibility"'').&lt;ref&gt;Karl Robert Mandelkow: Goethes Briefe (''Goethe's Letters''). 2.&amp;nbsp;edition.

(''"Already in 1793, Goethe formulated his arguments against Newton in the essay ''Über Newtons Hypothese der diversen Refrangibilität'' [...]."'')&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, by 1794, Goethe had begun to increasingly note the importance of the physiological aspect of colours.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Robert Mandelkow: Goethes Briefe (''Goethe's Letters''). 2.&amp;nbsp;edition. Vol.&amp;nbsp;2: Briefe der Jahre 1786–1805 (''Letters of the years 1786–1805''). ''Christian Wegner'' publishers, Hamburg 1968, p.&amp;nbsp;553. "Diese Wendung ist bereits angedeutet in Goethes Briefentwurf an Sömmerring vom Januar/Februar 1794, der Antwort auf Sömmerrings Brief an Goethe vom 18.

As Goethe notes in the historical section, [[Louis Bertrand Castel]] had already published a criticism of Newton's spectral description of prismatic colour in 1740&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = L'Optique des couleurs | publisher = Paris | year = 1740 | author = Louis-Bertrand Castel}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he observed that the sequence of colours split by a prism depended on the distance from the prism—and that Newton was looking at a special case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Instruments and the Imagination | journal = Nature | volume = 391 | issue = 6665 | pages = 347–348 | author = Thomas L.

"Whereas Newton observed the colour spectrum cast on a wall at a fixed distance away from the prism, Goethe observed the cast spectrum on a white card which was progressively moved away from the prism... As the card was moved away, the projected image elongated, gradually assuming an elliptical shape, and the coloured images became larger, finally merging at the centre to produce green. Moving the card farther led to the increase in the size of the image, until finally the spectrum described by Newton in the Opticks was produced... The image cast by the refracted beam was not fixed, but rather developed with increasing distance from the prism. Consequently, Goethe saw the particular distance chosen by Newton to prove the second proposition of the Opticks as capriciously imposed." (Alex Kentsis, Between Light and Eye)&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0511130 | Alex Kentsis, Between Light and Eye&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The theory we set up against this begins with colourless light, and avails itself of outward conditions, to produce coloured phenomena; but it concedes worth and dignity to these conditions.

In the preface to the ''Theory of Colours'', Goethe explained that he tried to apply the principle of ''polarity'', in the work—a proposition that belonged to his earliest convictions and was constitutive of his entire study of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Robert Mandelkow: Goethes Briefe (''Goethe's Letters''). 2.&amp;nbsp;edition. Vol.&amp;nbsp;2: Briefe der Jahre 1786–1805 (''Letters of the years 1786–1805''). ''Christian Wegner'' publishers, Hamburg 1968, p.&amp;nbsp;530. "Das für Goethes gesamte Naturbetrachtung konstitutive Prinzip der Polarität gehört zu ''seinen frühesten Überzeugungen''..., ''an denen er niemals irre geworden sei'' (Brief an Schweigger, 25. April 1814). Im Vorwort zur ''Farbenlehre'' wird es als ''Hauptabsicht des gegenwärtigen Werkes'' bezeichnet, dieses universelle Prinzip auch ''auf die Farbenlehre anzuwenden''."

See [[Johann Schweigger]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goethe's theory ==
{{quote|Goethe's theory of the constitution of colours of the spectrum has not proved to be an unsatisfactory theory, rather it really isn't a theory at all. Nothing can be predicted with it. It is, rather a vague schematic outline of the sort we find in [[William James|James]]'s psychology. Nor is there any ''[[experimentum crucis]]'' which could decide for or against the theory. |[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], ''Remarks on Colour, paragraphs 70''}}

It is hard to present Goethe's "theory", since he refrains from setting up any actual theory; he says, "its intention is to portray rather than explain" (''Scientific Studies''&lt;ref name="Goethe 1995"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Goethe | first = Johann | editor-last = Miller | editor-first = Douglas | title = Scientific Studies (Goethe: The Collected Works, Vol. 12), p.57 | publisher = Princeton University Press |date=October 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Instead of setting up models and explanations, Goethe collected specimens—he was responsible for the meteorological collections of Jena University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamm|first1=E. P.|title=Unpacking Goethe's Collections: The Public and the Private in Natural-Historical Collecting|journal=The British Journal for the History of Science|date=2001|volume=34|issue=3|pages=275–300|jstor=4028099}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of his death, he had amassed over 17,800 minerals in his personal collection—the largest in all of Europe. He took the same approach to colour—instead of narrowing and isolating things to a single 'experimentum crucis' (or critical experiment that would prove or disprove his theory), he sought to gain as much breadth for his understanding as possible by developing a wide-ranging exposition through which is revealed the essential character of colour—without having to resort to explanations and theories about perceived phenomena such as 'wavelengths' or 'particles'.

"The crux of his color theory is its experiential source: rather than impose theoretical statements, Goethe sought to allow light and color to be displayed in an ordered series of experiments that readers could experience for themselves." (Seamon, 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Seamon | first = David | editor-last = Seamon | editor-first = David | editor2-last = Zajonc | editor2-first = Arthur | title = Goethe's Way of Science: A Phenomenology of Nature | place = Albany, NY | year = 1998 | publisher = State University of New York Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;). According to Goethe, "Newton's error.. was trusting math over the sensations of his eye." (Jonah Lehrer, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Jonah Lehrer|[http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2006/12/post_7.php ''Goethe and Color''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128012817/http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2006/12/post_7.php |date=2007-01-28 }}, December 7, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

To stay true to the perception without resort to explanation was the essence of Goethe's method. What he provided was really not so much a theory, as a ''rational description'' of colour. For Goethe, "the highest is to understand that all fact is really theory. The blue of the sky reveals to us the basic law of color. Search nothing beyond the phenomena, they themselves are the theory."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in translation in: {{cite journal | last = Hughes | first = Peter | title = Performing Theory: Wittgenstein and the Trouble with Shakespeare | journal = Comparative Criticism | year = 1992 | volume = 14 | pages = 85 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[Goethe] delivered in full measure what was promised by the title of his excellent work: ''Data for a Theory of Color.'' They are important, complete, and significant data, rich material for a future theory of color. He has not, however, undertaken to furnish the theory itself; hence, as he himself remarks and admits on page xxxix of the introduction, he has not furnished us with a real explanation of the essential nature of color, but really postulates it as a phenomenon, and merely tells us how it originates, not what it is. The physiological colors ... he represents as a phenomenon, complete and existing by itself, without even attempting to show their relation to the physical colors, his principal theme. ... it is really a systematic presentation of facts, but it stops short at this. |[[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], ''[[On&amp;nbsp;Vision and Colors]]'', Introduction}}

{{quote|I believe that what Goethe was really seeking was not a physiological but a psychological theory of colours. |[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], ''Culture and Value, MS 112 255:26.11.1931}}

=== Light and darkness ===

Unlike his contemporaries, Goethe didn't see darkness as an absence of light, but rather as polar to and interacting with light; colour resulted from this interaction of light and shadow. For Goethe, light is ''"the simplest most undivided most homogenous being that we know. Confronting it is the darkness"'' (Letter to Jacobi).

{{quote|...they maintained that ''shade is a part of light''. It sounds absurd when I express it; but so it is: for they said that ''colours'', which are shadow and the result of shade, ''are light itself''.|[[Johann Eckermann]]|[[Conversations of Goethe]], entry: January 4, 1824; trans. Wallace Wood}}

Based on his experiments with turbid media, Goethe characterized colour as arising from the dynamic interplay of darkness and light. [[Rudolf Steiner]], the science editor for the Kurschner edition of Goethe's works, gave the following analogy:

{{quote|Modern natural science sees darkness as a complete nothingness. According to this view, the light which streams into a dark space has no resistance from the darkness to overcome. Goethe pictures to himself that light and darkness relate to each other like the north and south pole of a magnet. The darkness can weaken the light in its working power. Conversely, the light can limit the energy of the darkness. In both cases color arises.|Rudolf Steiner, 1897&lt;ref name="Steiner 1897"&gt;{{cite book | last = Steiner | first = Rudolf | title = Goethe's  World View, Chapter III The Phenomena of the World of Colors

Goethe expresses this more succinctly:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Goethe | first = Johann | title = Theory of Colours, paragraph #502 | year = 1810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Yellow is a light which has been dampened by darkness; Blue is a darkness weakened by light.}}

=== Experiments with turbid media ===

{{quote|The action of turbid media was to Goethe the ultimate fact—the Urphänomen—of the world of colours.|[[John Tyndall]], 1880&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tyndall | first = John | title = Popular Science Monthly, Volume 17, June 1880, Goethe's Farbenlehre | year = 1880}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Goethe's studies of colour began with experiments which examined the effects of [[turbidity|turbid media]], such as air, dust, and moisture on the perception of light and dark. The poet observed that light seen through a turbid medium appears yellow, and darkness seen through an illuminated medium appears blue.

{{quote|The highest degree of light, such as that of the sun... is for the most part colourless. This light, however, seen through a medium but very slightly thickened, appears to us yellow. If the density of such a medium be increased, or if its volume become greater, we shall see the light gradually assume a yellow-red hue, which at last deepens to a ruby colour.

If on the other hand darkness is seen through a semi-transparent medium, which is itself illumined by a light striking on it, a blue colour appears: this becomes lighter and paler as the density of the medium is increased, but on the contrary appears darker and deeper the more transparent the medium becomes: in the least degree of dimness short of absolute transparence, always supposing a perfectly colourless medium, this deep blue approaches the most beautiful violet. |Goethe|''Theory of Colours'', pp. 150–151}}

He then proceeds with numerous experiments, systematically observing the effects of rarefied mediums such as dust, air, and moisture on the perception of colour.

=== Boundary conditions ===
[[File:Prism-orientation-of-light-dark-boundary.gif|thumb|right|200px|When looked at ''through'' a prism, the colours seen at a light–dark boundary depend upon the orientation of this light–dark boundary.]]

When viewed through a prism, the orientation of a light–dark boundary with respect to the prism's axis is significant. With white above a dark boundary, we observe the light extending a blue-violet edge into the dark area; whereas dark above a light boundary results in a red-yellow edge extending into the light area.

Goethe was intrigued by this difference. He felt that this arising of colour at light–dark boundaries was fundamental to the creation of the spectrum (which he considered to be a compound phenomenon).

Varying the experimental conditions by using different shades of grey shows that the intensity of coloured edges increases with boundary contrast.

=== Light and dark spectra ===

[[File:Prisma-goethe.gif|thumb|right|200px|Light and dark spectra—when coloured edges overlap in a light spectrum, green results; when they overlap in a dark spectrum, magenta results. (Click for animation)]]

Since the colour phenomenon relies on the adjacency of light and dark, there are two ways to produce a spectrum: with a light beam in a dark room, and with a dark beam (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;a shadow) in a light room.

Goethe recorded the sequence of colours projected at various distances from a prism for both cases (see Plate&amp;nbsp;IV, ''Theory of Colours''). In both cases, he found that the yellow and blue edges remain closest to the side which is light, and red and violet edges remain closest to the side which is dark. At a certain distance, these edges overlap—and we obtain Newton's spectrum. When these edges overlap in a light spectrum, green results; when they overlap in a dark spectrum, magenta results.

With a light spectrum (i.e. a shaft of light in a surrounding darkness), we find yellow-red colours along the top edge, and blue-violet colours along the bottom edge. The spectrum with green in the middle arises only where the blue-violet edges overlap the yellow-red edges. Unfortunately an optical mixture of blue and yellow gives white, not green, and so Goethe's explanation of Newton's spectrum fails.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Zajonc. "Goethe's Theory of Color and Scientific Intuition", ''American Journal of Physics'', Vol. 44, No. 4 April (1976): 3-4. 'This is of course in error since the green produced here is approximately spectral green, that is, pure green, not a mixture.' The point is that the optical mixing of the edge-spectra is additive, not subtractive.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_mixing, and that there is no combination of yellows or blues that will produce the saturated green produced when the edge-spectra start to overlap.&lt;/ref&gt;

With a dark spectrum (i.e., a shadow surrounded by light), we find violet-blue along the top edge, and red-yellow along the bottom edge—and where these edges overlap, we find (extraspectral) magenta.

{{quote|When the eye sees a colour it is immediately excited and it is its nature, spontaneously and of necessity, at once to produce another, which with the original colour, comprehends the whole chromatic scale. | Goethe, Theory of Colours}}

Goethe anticipated [[Ewald Hering]]'s [[Opponent process]] theory&lt;ref&gt;[http://webexhibits.org/colorart/ch.html Goethe's Color Theory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916130507/http://www.webexhibits.org/colorart/ch.html |date=2008-09-16 }}. ''Webexhibits.org'', retrieved July 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; by proposing a symmetric colour wheel. He writes, "The chromatic circle... [is] arranged in a general way according to the natural order... for the colours diametrically opposed to each other in this diagram are those which reciprocally evoke each other in the eye. Thus, yellow demands violet; orange [demands] blue; purple [demands] green; and vice versa: thus... all intermediate gradations reciprocally evoke each other; the simpler colour demanding the compound, and vice versa (&lt;ref name="Physiologische Farben" /&gt; paragraph&amp;nbsp;#50).

{{anchor|magenta}}In the same way that light and dark spectra yielded green from the mixture of blue and yellow—Goethe completed his colour wheel by recognising the importance of magenta—"For Newton, only spectral colors could count as fundamental. By contrast, Goethe's more empirical approach led him to recognize the essential role of magenta in a complete color circle, a role that it still has in all modern color systems."&lt;ref name="Ribe;Steinle" /&gt;

=== Complementary colours and colours psychology ===
[[File:Goethe Schiller Die Temperamentenrose.jpg|thumb|250px|The "rose of temperaments" (''Temperamentenrose''), an earlier study (1798/9) by Goethe and [[Schiller]], matching twelve colours to human occupations or their character traits
(''tyrants, heroes, adventurers, hedonists, lovers, poets, public speakers, historians, teachers, philosophers, pedants, rulers''), grouped in the [[four temperaments]].]]

Goethe also  included aesthetic qualities in his colour wheel, under the title of "allegorical, symbolic, mystic use of colour" (''Allegorischer, symbolischer, mystischer Gebrauch der Farbe''), establishing a kind of [[color psychology]].
He  associated red with the "beautiful", orange with the "noble", yellow to the "good", green to the "useful", blue to the "common", and violet to the "unnecessary".
These six qualities were assigned to four categories of human cognition, the rational (''Vernunft'') to the beautiful and the noble (red and orange), the intellectual (''Verstand'') to the good and the useful (yellow and green), the sensual (''Sinnlichkeit'') to the useful and the common (green and blue) and, closing the circle, imagination (''Phantasie'') to both the unnecessary and the beautiful (purple and red).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kisc.meiji.ac.jp/~mmandel/recherche/goethe_farbenkreis.html Goethe: Farbenkreis zur Symbolisierung des "menschlichen Geistes- und Seelenlebens". 1809] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603092523/http://www.kisc.meiji.ac.jp/~mmandel/recherche/goethe_farbenkreis.html |date=2011-06-03 }}. Goethe und die Kunst. ed. Sabine Schulze. Stuttgart: Hatje 1994, p. 141. "Jeder Farbe wird eine menschliche Eigenschaft zugeordnet (...). Im inneren Ring: rot – 'schön', gelbrot – 'edel', gelb – 'gut', grün – 'nützlich', blau – 'gemein', blaurot – 'unnöthig'." (''"Each colour, a human quality is attributed to [...]. In the inner ring: red – 'beautiful', orange – 'noble', yellow – 'good', green – 'useful', blue – 'mean', violet – 'unnecessary'."'')&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Notes on translation ====

[[Magenta]] appeared as a colour term only in the mid-nineteenth&amp;nbsp;century, after Goethe. Hence, references to Goethe's recognition of ''magenta'' are fraught with interpretation. If one observes the colours coming out of a prism—an English person may be more inclined to describe as magenta what in German is called ''Purpur''—so one may not lose the intention of the author.

However, literal translation is more difficult. Goethe's work uses two composite words for [[color mixing|mixed]] (intermediate) [[hue]]s along with corresponding usual [[color term|colour terms]] such as "orange" and "violet".

== Newton and Goethe ==

"The essential difference between Goethe’s theory of colour and the theory which has prevailed in science (despite all modifications) since Newton’s day, lies in this: While the theory of Newton and his successors was based on excluding the colour-seeing faculty of the eye, Goethe founded his theory on the eye’s experience of colour."&lt;ref&gt;[http://borderlandresearch.com/book/man-or-matter/chapter-xiv-colours-as-deeds-and-sufferings-of-light Ernst Lehrs, Man or Matter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110234319/http://borderlandresearch.com/book/man-or-matter/chapter-xiv-colours-as-deeds-and-sufferings-of-light |date=2014-01-10 }}, retrieved January 10, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

"The renouncing of life and immediacy, which was the premise for the progress of natural science since Newton, formed the real basis for the bitter struggle which Goethe waged against the physical optics of Newton. It would be  superficial to dismiss this struggle as unimportant: there is much significance in one of the most outstanding men directing all his efforts to fighting against the development of Newtonian optics." ([[Werner Heisenberg]], during a speech celebrating Goethe's birthday)&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Lehrs, Man or Matter, Chapter II | https://archive.org/stream/manormatter05641gut/elmom10p#page/n23/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to their different approaches to a common subject, many misunderstandings have arisen between Newton's mathematical understanding of optics, and Goethe's experiential approach.&lt;ref name=Stephenson&gt;R. H. Stephenson, ''Goethe's Conception of Knowledge and Science'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Because [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] understands white light to be composed of individual colours, and Goethe sees colour arising from the interaction of light and dark, they come to different conclusions on the question: is the optical spectrum a primary or a compound phenomenon?

For Newton, the prism is immaterial to the existence of colour, as all the colours already exist in white light, and the prism merely fans them out according to their refrangibility. Goethe sought to show that, as a turbid medium, the prism was an integral factor in the arising of colour.

Whereas Newton narrowed the beam of light in order to isolate the phenomenon, Goethe observed that with a wider aperture, there was no spectrum. He saw only reddish-yellow edges and blue-cyan edges with white between them, and the spectrum arose only where these edges came close enough to overlap. For him, the spectrum could be explained by the simpler phenomena of colour arising from the interaction of light and dark edges.

Newton explains the appearance of white with colored edges by saying that due to the differing overall amount of refraction, the rays mix together to create a full white towards the centre, whereas the edges do not benefit from this full mixture and appear with greater red or blue components. For Newton's account of his experiments, see his ''[[Opticks]]'' (1704).&lt;ref&gt;''Opticks Or, A treatise of the Reflections, Refractions, Inflexions and Colours of Light, Also Two treatises of the Species and Magnitude of Curvilinear Figures'' (London, 1704) {{cite web |url=http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/prism.php?id=43 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008062012/http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/prism.php?id=43 |archivedate=2012-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goethe's [[Concretization|reification]] of darkness is rejected by modern physics. Both Newton and [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]] defined darkness as an absence of light. [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Young]] and [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel|Fresnel]] combined Newton's particle theory with Huygen's wave theory to show that colour is the visible manifestation of light's wavelength. Physicists today attribute both a corpuscular and undulatory character to light—comprising the [[wave–particle duality]].

== History and influence ==

The first edition of the ''Farbenlehre'' was printed at the Cotta’schen Verlagsbuchhandlung on May 16, 1810, with 250 copies on grey paper and 500 copies on white paper. It contained three sections: i)&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;didactic section in which Goethe presents his own observations, ii)&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;polemic section in which he makes his case against Newton, and iii)&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;historical section.

From its publication, the book was controversial for its stance against Newton. So much so, that when [[Charles Lock Eastlake|Charles Eastlake]] translated the text into English in 1840, he omitted the content of Goethe's polemic against Newton.

{{quote|Significantly (and regrettably), only the 'Didactic' colour observations appear in Eastlake's translation. In his preface, Eastlake explains that he deleted the historical and entoptic parts of the book because they 'lacked scientific interest', and censored Goethe's polemic because the 'violence of his objections' against Newton would prevent readers from fairly judging Goethe's color observations.|Bruce MacEvoy| Handprint.com, 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/goethe.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531083426/http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/goethe.html |archivedate=2009-05-31 |df= }} | Bruce MacEvoy | Handprint.com | 2008&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Influence on the arts ===

[[File:The Fighting Temeraire, JMW Turner, National Gallery.jpg|thumb|right|[[J. M. W. Turner]]'s ''[[The Fighting Temeraire]]'', 1839]]
Goethe was initially induced to occupy himself with the study of colour by the questions of [[hue]] in painting. "During his first journey to Italy (1786–88), he noticed that artists were able to enunciate rules for virtually all the elements of painting and drawing except color and coloring. In the years 1786–88, Goethe began investigating whether one could ascertain rules to govern the artistic use of color."&lt;ref name="SepperDennis"&gt;Sepper, Dennis L. | ''Goethe contra Newton: Polemics and the Project for a New Science of Color'' | Cambridge University Press | 2007 | {{ISBN|0-521-53132-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This aim came to some fulfillment when several pictorial artists, above all [[Philipp Otto Runge]], took an interest in his colour studies.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Robert Mandelkow: Goethes Briefe (''Goethe's Letters''). 2.&amp;nbsp;edition. Vol.&amp;nbsp;4: Briefe der Jahre 1821–1832 (''Letters of the years 1821–1832''). ''C.&amp;nbsp;H. Beck'' publishers, München 1976, p.&amp;nbsp;622. "Wie die Anfänge von Goethes Beschäftigung mit der Farbenlehre veranlaßt waren durch die Frage nach dem Kolorit in der Malerei (...), so war die Anteilnahme bildender Künstler an seinen Farbenstudien für Goethe eine hochwillkommene Bestätigung des von ihm Gewollten, wie er sie vor allem von Philipp Otto Runge erfahren hat." (''"As the beginnings of Goethe's occupation with the theory of colours were induced by the question of hue in painting [...], the interest of pictorial artists in his colour studyings was a highly welcome acknowledgement of what he wanted, for him, which he above all received from Philipp Otto Runge."'')&lt;/ref&gt; After being translated into English by [[Charles Lock Eastlake|Charles Eastlake]] in 1840, the theory became widely adopted by the art world—especially among the [[Pre-Raphaelites]]. [[J.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;W. Turner]] studied it comprehensively and referenced it in the titles of several paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bockemuhl |first=M. |title=Turner |publisher=Taschen, Köln |year=1991|isbn=978-3-8228-6325-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wassily Kandinsky]] considered it "one of the most important works."&lt;ref name="Rowley"&gt;{{cite news | last = Rowley | first = Alison | title = Kandinskii's theory of colour and Olesha's Envy | work = | publisher = LookSmart FindArticles | date = September–December 2002 | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3763/is_200209/ai_n9096866 | accessdate = 2007-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influence on Latin American flags ===
[[File:59 - Carthagène - Décembre 2008.JPG|thumb|right|Flag of Colombia]]
During a party in Weimar in the winter of 1785, Goethe had a late-night conversation with the South American revolutionary [[Francisco de Miranda]]. In a letter written to [[Semyon Vorontsov|Count Semyon Romanovich Vorontsov]] (1792), Miranda recounted how Goethe, fascinated with his exploits throughout the Americas and Europe, told him, "Your destiny is to create in your land a place where primary colours are not distorted.” He proceeded to clarify what he meant:
{{cquote|First he explained to me the way the iris transforms the light into the three primary colours... then he said, "Why yellow is the most warm, noble and closest to the bright light; why Blue is that mix of excitement and serenity, so far that it evokes the shadows; and why Red is the exaltation of Yellow and Blue, the synthesis, the vanishing of the bright light into the shadows".&lt;ref&gt;Serpa Erazo, Jorge,  ''Pañol de la Historia''.

=== Influence on philosophers ===
In the nineteenth century Goethe's Theory was taken up by Schopenhauer in ''[[On Vision and Colors]]'', who developed it into a kind of arithmetical physiology of the action of the retina, much in keeping with his own representative realism.

In the twentieth century the theory was transmitted to philosophy via Wittgenstein, who devoted a series of remarks to the subject at the end of his life. These remarks are collected as ''Remarks on Colour'', (Wittgenstein, 1977).

{{quote|Someone who agrees with Goethe finds that Goethe correctly recognized the nature of colour.  And here ‘nature’ does not mean a sum of experiences with respect to colours, but it is to be found in the concept of colour. |Aphorism 125, Ludwig Wittgenstein, ''Remarks on Color'', 1992&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.homodiscens.com/home/ways/perspicax/color_vision_sub/art_color_theory/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213045931/http://www.homodiscens.com/home/ways/perspicax/color_vision_sub/art_color_theory/ |archivedate=2013-12-13 |df= }} | Ludwig Wittgenstein | University of California Press | 1992&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Wittgenstein was interested in the fact that some propositions about colour are apparently neither empirical nor exactly a priori, but something in between: phenomenology, according to Goethe. However, Wittgenstein took the line that 'There is no such thing as phenomenology, though there ''are'' phenomenological problems.' He was content to regard Goethe's observations as a kind of logic or geometry. Wittgenstein took his examples from the Runge letter included in the "Farbenlehre", e.g. "White is the lightest colour", "There cannot be a transparent white", "There cannot be a reddish green", and so on. The logical status of these propositions in Wittgenstein's investigation, including their relation to physics, has been discussed in Jonathan Westphal's ''Colour: a Philosophical Introduction'' (Westphal, 1991).

=== Reception by scientists ===

As early as 1853, in [[Hermann von Helmholtz]]'s lecture on Goethe's scientific works—he says of Goethe's work that he depicts the perceived phenomena—"circumstantially, rigorously true to nature, and vividly puts them in an order that is pleasant to survey, and proves himself here, as everywhere in the realm of the factual, to be the great master of exposition" (Helmholtz 1853). Helmholtz ultimately rejects Goethe's theory as the work of a poet, but expresses his perplexity at how they can be in such agreement about the facts of the matter, but in violent contradiction about their meaning—'And I for one do not know how anyone, regardless of what his views about colours are, can deny that the theory in itself is fully consequent, that its assumptions, once granted, explain the facts treated completely and indeed simply'. (Helmholtz 1853)&lt;ref&gt;Helmholtz, Hermann von. 1853. Goethes Vorahnungen kommender naturwissenschaftlicher Ideen. Berlin: Pastel. 1971. Philosophische Vortrdge und Aufsdtze. Ed. H. Horz and S. Wollgast. Berlin: Akademie-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the accuracy of Goethe's observations does not admit a great deal of criticism, his aesthetic approach did not lend itself to the demands of analytic and mathematical analysis used ubiquitously in modern Science. [[Thomas Johann Seebeck]] was the only prominent scientist among Goethe's contemporaries who acknowledged the theory, but later also saw it critically.&lt;ref&gt;Bodo Morawe: Goethes Briefe (''Goethe's Letters''). 1.&amp;nbsp;edition. Vol.&amp;nbsp;3: Briefe der Jahre 1805–1821 (''Letters of the years 1805–1821''). ''Christian Wegner'' publishers, Hamburg 1965, p.&amp;nbsp;623. "[Seebeck] ist unter den Zeitgenossen der einzige profilierte Naturwissenschaftler, der Goethes ''Farbenlehre'' anerkannte, wenn er sie auch in den letzten Jahren dann kritisch sah." (''"[Seebeck] is the only prominent scientist among the contemporaries who acknowledged Goethe's ''Theory of Colours'', although in his latter years he also saw it critically."'')&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Goethe's colour theory has in many ways borne fruit in art, physiology and aesthetics. But victory, and hence influence on the research of the following century, has been Newton's. | Werner Heisenberg, 1952}}

{{quote|"One hole Goethe did find in Newton's armour, through which he incessantly worried the Englishman with his lance. Newton had committed himself to the doctrine that refraction without colour was impossible. He therefore thought that the object-glasses of telescopes must for ever remain imperfect, achromatism and refraction being incompatible. This inference was proved by [[John Dollond|Dollond]] to be wrong... Here, as elsewhere, Goethe proves himself master of the experimental conditions. It is the power of interpretation that he lacks." | John Tyndall, 1880&lt;ref&gt;Popular Science Monthly/Volume 17/July 1880){{cite web |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Popular_Science_Monthly/Volume_17/July_1880/Goethe's_Farbenlehre:_Theory_of_Colors_II |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529083724/http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Popular_Science_Monthly/Volume_17/July_1880/Goethe%27s_Farbenlehre:_Theory_of_Colors_II |archivedate=2014-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Much controversy stems from two different ways of investigating light and colour. Goethe was not interested in Newton's analytic treatment of colour—but he presented an excellent ''rational description'' of the phenomenon of human colour perception. It is as such a collection of colour observations that we must view this book.

{{quote|Most of Goethe's explanations of color have been thoroughly demolished, but no criticism has been leveled at his reports of the facts to be observed; nor should any be. This book can lead the reader through a demonstration course not only in subjectively produced colors (after images, light and dark adaptation, irradiation, colored shadows, and pressure phosphenes), but also in physical phenomena detectable qualitatively by observation of color (absorption, scattering, refraction, diffraction, polarization, and interference). A reader who attempts to follow the logic of Goethe's explanations and who attempts to compare them with the currently accepted views might, even with the advantage of 1970 sophistication, become convinced that Goethe's theory, or at least a part of it, has been dismissed too quickly.|[[Deane B.

[[Mitchell Feigenbaum]] came to believe that "Goethe had been right about colour!"&lt;ref name="Ribe;Steinle" /&gt;

=== Current status ===

"Newton believed that with the help of his prism experiments, he could prove that sunlight was composed of variously coloured rays of light. Goethe showed that this step from observation to theory is more problematic than Newton wanted to admit. By insisting that the step to theory is not forced upon us by the phenomena, Goethe revealed our own free, creative contribution to theory construction. And Goethe's insight is surprisingly significant, because he correctly claimed that all of the results of Newton's prism experiments fit a theoretical alternative equally well.. a century before Duhem and Quine's famous arguments for [[Underdetermination]]."&lt;ref name="Mueller 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09608788.2015.1132671 |title=Prismatic Equivalence – A New Case of Underdetermination: Goethe vs. Newton on the Prism Experiments |journal=British Journal for the History of Philosophy |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=323–347 |year=2016 |last1=Mueller |first1=Olaf L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Goethe’s critique of Newton was not an attack on reason or science, though it has often been portrayed that way.. The critique maintained that Newton had mistaken mathematical imagining as the pure evidence of the senses.. Goethe tried to define the scientific function of imagination: to interrelate phenomena once they have been meticulously produced, described, and organized... Newton had introduced dogma.. into color science by claiming that color could be reduced to a function of rays." (Dennis L. Sepper, 2009)&lt;ref name="Sepper 2009"/&gt;
{{quote|Goethe started out by accepting Newton's physical theory. He soon abandoned it... finding modification to be more in keeping with his own insights. One beneficial consequence of this was that he developed an awareness of the importance of the physiological aspect of colour perception, and was therefore able to demonstrate that Newton's theory of light and colours is too simplistic; that there is more to colour than variable refrangibility.|Michael Duck, 1988&lt;ref name="Duck, Michael"&gt;{{cite web | last = Duck | first = Michael | title = Newton and Goethe on colour: Physical and physiological considerations | website =  | publisher = Annals of Science, Volume 45, Number 5, pp. 507-519 | date = September 1988 | url = http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/tandf/tasc/1988/00000045/00000005/art00004?crawler=true | accessdate = 2011-03-29 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110606080032/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/tandf/tasc/1988/00000045/00000005/art00004?crawler=true | archivedate = 2011-06-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"Although he soon rejected Newton’s differential refrangibility, Goethe always affirmed Newtonian mechanics. It was not an apriori poetic prejudice against mathematical analysis but rather performing the experiments that led him to reject the theory... Goethe soon concluded that in order to explain color one needs to know not just about light but also about eye function and relative differences in light across the visual field."

As a catalogue of observations, Goethe's experiments probe the complexities of human colour perception. Whereas Newton sought to develop a mathematical model for the behaviour of light, Goethe focused on exploring how colour is perceived in a wide array of conditions. Developments in understanding how the brain interprets colours, such as [[Color constancy|colour constancy]] and [[Edwin H. Land]]'s [[Color constancy#Retinex theory|retinex]] theory bear striking similarities to Goethe's theory.&lt;ref name="Ribe;Steinle" /&gt;

As in other mammals, '''thermoregulation in humans''' is an important aspect of [[human homeostasis|homeostasis]]. In [[thermoregulation]], body heat is generated mostly in the deep organs, especially the liver, brain, and heart, and in contraction of skeletal muscles.&lt;ref name="GuytonHall2006p80"&gt;{{cite book |year=2006 |author=Guyton, A.C., &amp; Hall, J.E. |title=Textbook of Medical Physiology |edition=11th |place=Philadelphia |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |page=890}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans have been able to adapt to a great diversity of climates, including hot humid and hot arid. High temperatures pose serious stress for the human body, placing it in great danger of injury or even death. For humans, [[adaptation]] to varying climatic conditions includes both physiological mechanisms resulting from [[evolution]] and behavioural mechanisms resulting from conscious cultural adaptations.&lt;ref name=" humanbiology3rded"&gt;Harrison, G.A., Tanner, J.M., Pilbeam, D.R., &amp; Baker, P.T. (1988) ''Human Biology: An introduction to human evolution, variation, growth, and adaptability''. (3rd ed). Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Humanbiology&amp;behaviour4thed"&gt;Weiss, M.L., &amp; Mann, A.E. (1985) ''Human Biology and Behaviour: An anthropological perspective''. (4th ed). Boston: Little Brown&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four avenues of heat loss: convection, conduction, radiation, and evaporation. If skin temperature is greater than that of the surroundings, the body can lose heat by radiation and conduction. But, if the temperature of the surroundings is greater than that of the skin, the body actually ''gains'' heat by radiation and conduction. In such conditions, the only means by which the body can rid itself of heat is by evaporation. So, when the surrounding temperature is higher than the skin temperature, anything that prevents adequate evaporation will cause the internal body temperature to rise.&lt;ref name=GuytonHall2006pp891892&gt;Guyton &amp; Hall (2006), pp.891-892&lt;/ref&gt; During sports activities, evaporation becomes the main avenue of heat loss.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmore, Jack H., &amp; Costill, David L. (1999). ''Physiology of sport and exercise'' (2nd ed). Champaign, Illinois: Human Kinetics.&lt;/ref&gt; Humidity affects thermoregulation by limiting sweat evaporation and thus heat loss.&lt;ref name=" textbookofmedicalphysiology5thed"&gt;Guyton, Arthur C. (1976) ''Textbook of Medical Physiology''. (5th ed). Philadelphia: W.B. Saunders&lt;/ref&gt;

==Control system==
[[File:Thermoregulation simplified.png|thumb|right|400px|Simplified [[Control theory|control circuit]] of human thermoregulation.&lt;ref name="Kanosue"&gt;Kanosue, K., Crawshaw, L. I., Nagashima, K., &amp; Yoda, T. (2009). Concepts to utilize in describing thermoregulation and neurophysiological evidence for how the system works. European Journal of Applied Physiology, 109(1), 5–11.  {{doi|10.1007/s00421-009-1256-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The core temperature of a human is regulated and stabilized primarily by the [[hypothalamus]], a region of the brain linking the [[endocrine system]] to the nervous system,&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Sargis, [http://www.endocrineweb.com/endocrinology/overview-hypothalamus An Overview of the Hypothalamus: The Endocrine System’s Link to the Nervous System] (accessed Jan. 19 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; and more specifically by the [[anterior hypothalamic nucleus]] and the adjacent [[preoptic area]] regions of the hypothalamus.  As core temperature varies from the set point, endocrine production initiates control mechanisms to increase or decrease energy production/dissipation as needed to return the temperature toward the set point (see figure).&lt;ref name="Kanosue" /&gt;

==In hot conditions==
[[File:Electric fan being used in hot weather in Australia-11Jan2010.jpg|thumb|[[Electric fan]] used in hot weather]]
*Eccrine sweat glands under the skin secrete [[sweat]] (a fluid containing mostly water with some dissolved ions), which travels up the sweat duct, through the sweat pore and onto the surface of the skin. This causes heat loss via [[evaporative cooling]]; however, a lot of essential water is lost.
*The hair on the skin lie flat, preventing heat from being trapped by the layer of still air between the hair. This is caused by tiny muscles under the surface of the skin called [[arrector pili]] muscles relaxing so that their attached hair follicles are not erect. These flat hairs increase the flow of air next to the skin increasing heat loss by convection. When environmental temperature is above core body temperature, sweating is the only physiological way for humans to lose heat.
*Arteriolar vasodilation occurs. The smooth muscle walls of the [[arterioles]] relax allowing increased blood flow through the artery. This redirects blood into the superficial capillaries in the skin increasing heat loss by convection and conduction.

==In hot and humid conditions==
In general, humans appear physiologically well adapted to hot dry conditions.&lt;ref name=" encylopediahumanevolution"&gt;Jones, S., Martin, R., &amp; Pilbeam, D. (1994) ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Human Evolution". Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; However, effective thermoregulation is reduced in hot, humid environments such as the Red Sea and Persian Gulf (where moderately hot summer temperatures are accompanied by unusually high vapor pressures), tropical environments, and deep mines where the atmosphere can be water-saturated.&lt;ref name=" encylopediahumanevolution"/&gt;&lt;ref name= humanbiology3rded/&gt; In hot-humid conditions, clothing can impede efficient evaporation.&lt;ref name= Humanbiology&amp;behaviour4thed/&gt; In such environments, it helps to wear light clothing such as cotton, that is pervious to sweat but impervious to radiant heat from the sun. This minimizes the gaining of radiant heat, while allowing as much evaporation to occur as the environment will allow. Clothing such as plastic fabrics that are impermeable to sweat and thus do not facilitate heat loss through evaporation can actually contribute to heat stress.&lt;ref name=textbookofmedicalphysiology5thed/&gt;

==In cold conditions==
*Heat is lost mainly through the hands and feet.
*Sweat production is decreased.
*The minute muscles under the surface of the skin called arrector pili muscles (attached to an individual hair follicle) contract ([[piloerection]]), lifting the hair follicle upright. This makes the hairs stand on end, which acts as an insulating layer, trapping heat. This is what also causes [[goose bumps]] since humans do not have very much hair and the contracted muscles can easily be seen.
*[[Arterioles]] carrying blood to superficial capillaries under the surface of the skin can shrink (constrict), thereby rerouting blood away from the skin and towards the warmer core of the body. This prevents blood from losing heat to the surroundings and also prevents the core temperature dropping further. This process is called vasoconstriction. It is impossible to prevent all heat loss from the blood, only to reduce it. In extremely cold conditions, excessive vasoconstriction leads to numbness and pale skin. Frostbite occurs only when water within the cells begins to freeze.  This destroys the cell causing damage.
*Muscles can also receive messages from the thermoregulatory center of the brain (the [[hypothalamus]]) to cause shivering. This increases heat production as respiration is an exothermic reaction in muscle cells. Shivering is more effective than exercise at producing heat because the animal (includes humans) remains still. This means that less heat is lost to the environment through [[convection]]. There are two types of shivering: low-intensity and high-intensity. During low-intensity shivering, animals shiver constantly at a low level for months during cold conditions. During high-intensity shivering, animals shiver violently for a relatively short time. Both processes consume energy, however high-intensity shivering uses glucose as a fuel source and low-intensity tends to use fats. This is a primary reason why animals store up food in the winter.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}
*In addition to heat production by shivering, [[mitochondria]] can [[Thermogenesis#Non-shivering thermogenesis|metabolize brown fat and produce heat energy]] via the [[thermogenin]] protein, in turn increasing the temperature of all cells in the body. [[Brown fat]] is specialized for this purpose, and is abundant in newborns and animals that hibernate.

==Uses of hypothermia==
Adjusting the human body temperature downward has been used therapeutically, in particular, as a method of stabilizing a body following trauma.  It has been suggested that adjusting the A1 receptor of the hypothalamus may allow humans to enter a [[hibernation]]-like state of reduced body temperature, which could be useful for applications such as long-duration space flight.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Koebler, [http://motherboard.vice.com/read/a-brief-history-of-cryosleep A Brief History of Cryosleep], ''Motherboard'', January 19, 2016  (accessed Jan. 19 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''tree of life''' or '''universal tree of life''' is a [[metaphor]], model and research tool used to explore the evolution of life and describe the relationships between organisms, both living and extinct, as described in a famous passage in [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mindell|first1=D.

Tree diagrams originated in the [[Middle Ages|medieval era]] to represent [[family tree|genealogical relationships]].

[[Phylogenetic tree]] diagrams in the evolutionary sense date back to at least the early 19th century.

The term [[phylogeny]] for the evolutionary relationships of species through time was coined by [[Ernst Haeckel]], who  went further than [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] in proposing [[Phylogenetics|phylogenic]] histories of life. In contemporary usage, ''tree of life'' refers to the compilation of comprehensive phylogenetic databases rooted at the [[last universal common ancestor]] of life on Earth. The [[Open Tree of Life]], first published 2015, is a project to compile such a database for free public access.

{{evolutionary biology}}
Although the mutability of species may have appeared in paintings&lt;ref&gt;Fausto Barbagli (2009) 'In Retrospect: The earliest picture of evolution?', ''Nature'' 19 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and trees have been used as a metaphor for other purposes ([[Arbor porphyriana|Porphyrian tree]]) earlier than 1800, the combination of the concept of branching evolution and the tree image did not appear before 1800. The earliest tree of life was published by the French botanist [[Augustin Augier]] in 1801. It shows the relationships between members of the plant kingdom.

[[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] (1744–1829) produced the first branching tree of animals in his ''[[Philosophie Zoologique]]'' (1809). It was an upside-down tree starting with worms and ending with mammals. However, Lamarck did not believe in common descent of all life. Instead, he believed that life consists of separate parallel lines advancing from simple to complex.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Bowler (2003) 'Evolution. The History of an Idea', third edition, p.90-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The American geologist [[Edward Hitchcock]] (1793–1864) published in 1840 the first tree of life based on paleontology in his ''Elementary Geology''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Archibald | first1 = J. David | year = 2009 | title = Edward Hitchcock's Pre-Darwinian (1840) 'Tree of Life'. | doi=10.1007/s10739-008-9163-y | journal = Journal of the History of Biology | volume = 42 | issue = 3| pages = 561–592 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.688.7842 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the vertical axis are paleontological periods. Hitchcock made a separate tree for plants (left) and animals (right). The plant and the animal tree are not connected at the bottom of the chart. Furthermore, each tree starts with multiple origins. Hitchcock's tree was more realistic than Darwin's 1859 theoretical tree (see below) because Hitchcock used real names in his trees. It is also true that Hitchcock's trees were branching trees. However, they were not ''evolutionary'' trees, because Hitchcock believed that a deity was the agent of change. That was an important difference with Darwin.

The first edition of [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]]' ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'', which was published anonymously in 1844 in England, contained [[:File:Vestiges dev diag.svg|a tree-like diagram]] (p.&amp;nbsp;212) in the chapter "Hypothesis of the development of the vegetable and animal kingdoms". It shows a model of embryological development where fish (F), reptiles (R), and birds (B) represent branches from a path leading to mammals (M). In the text this branching tree idea is tentatively applied to the history of life on earth: "there may be branching" (p.&amp;nbsp;191), but the branching diagram is not displayed again specifically for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;See for [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=A2&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1 online edition of ''Vestiges''].&lt;/ref&gt; However, the image of a branching tree could easily have inspired others to use it explicitly as a representation of the history of life on earth.

In 1858, a year before Darwin's ''Origin'', the paleontologist [[Heinrich Georg Bronn]] (1800–1862) published a hypothetical tree labeled with letters. Although not a creationist, Bronn did not propose a mechanism of change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Archibald | first1 = J. David | year = 2009 | title = Edward Hitchcock's Pre-Darwinian (1840) 'Tree of Life'. | doi=10.1007/s10739-008-9163-y | journal = Journal of the History of Biology | volume = 42 | issue = 3| page = 568 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.688.7842 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:On the Origin of Species diagram.PNG|thumb|right|250px|The tree of life image that appeared in [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', 1859. It was the book's only illustration]]

[[Charles Darwin]] (1809–1882) used the concept of a tree of life in the context of his theory of evolution. In ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859) Chapter IV he presented an abstract diagram of a theoretical tree of life for species of an unnamed large [[genus]] (see figure). On the horizontal base line hypothetical species within this genus are labelled A – L and are spaced irregularly to indicate how distinct they are from each other, and are above broken lines at various angles suggesting that they have diverged from one or more common ancestors. On the vertical axis divisions labelled I – XIV each represent a thousand generations. From A, diverging lines show branching descent producing new varieties, some of which become extinct, so that after ten thousand generations descendants of A have become distinct new varieties or even sub-species a&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;, f&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;, and m&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;. Similarly, the descendants of I have diversified to become the new varieties w&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; and z&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;. The process is extrapolated for a further four thousand generations so that the descendants of A and I become fourteen new species labelled a&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; to z&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;. While F has continued for fourteen thousand generations relatively unchanged, species B,C,D,E,G,H,K and L have gone extinct. In Darwin's own words: "Thus the small differences distinguishing varieties of the same species, will steadily tend to increase till they come to equal the greater differences between species of the same genus, or even of distinct genera.".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=131 116–130]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a branching pattern with no names given to species, unlike the more linear tree Ernst Haeckel made years later (figure below) which includes the names of species and shows a more linear development from "lower" to "higher" species. In his summary to the section, Darwin put his concept in terms of the metaphor of the tree of life:

[[File:Darwin Tree 1837.png|thumb|right|upright|Page from Darwin's notebooks around July 1837, showing his first sketch of an evolutionary tree, with the words "I think" at the top]]

{{quote|The affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes been represented by a great tree. I believe this simile largely speaks the truth. The green and budding twigs may represent existing species; and those produced during each former year may represent the long succession of extinct species. At each period of growth all the growing twigs have tried to branch out on all sides, and to overtop and kill the surrounding twigs and branches, in the same manner as species and groups of species have tried to overmaster other species in the great battle for life. The limbs divided into great branches, and these into lesser and lesser branches, were themselves once, when the tree was small, budding twigs; and this connexion of the former and present buds by ramifying branches may well represent the classification of all extinct and living species in groups subordinate to groups. Of the many twigs which flourished when the tree was a mere bush, only two or three, now grown into great branches, yet survive and bear all the other branches; so with the species which lived during long-past geological periods, very few now have living and modified descendants. From the first growth of the tree, many a limb and branch has decayed and dropped off; and these lost branches of various sizes may represent those whole orders, families, and genera which have now no living representatives, and which are known to us only from having been found in a fossil state. As we here and there see a thin straggling branch springing from a fork low down in a tree, and which by some chance has been favoured and is still alive on its summit, so we occasionally see an animal like the [[Platypus|Ornithorhynchus]] or [[South American Lungfish|Lepidosiren]], which in some small degree connects by its affinities two large branches of life, and which has apparently been saved from fatal competition by having inhabited a [[ecological niche|protected station]]. As buds give rise by growth to fresh buds, and these, if vigorous, branch out and overtop on all sides many a feebler branch, so by generation I believe it has been with the great Tree of Life, which fills with its dead and broken branches the crust of the earth, and covers the surface with its ever branching and beautiful ramifications.|[[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=147&amp;itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text 129–130]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The meaning and importance of Darwin's use of the tree of life metaphor have been extensively discussed. [[Stephen Jay Gould]], for example, says that Darwin placed the famous passage quoted above "at a crucial spot in his text", where it marked the conclusion of his argument for natural selection, illustrating both the interconnectedness by descent of organisms as well as their success and failure in the history of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |year=1993 |title=Eight Little Piggies |publisher=Jonathan Cape |location=London |isbn=978-0-224-03716-7}} p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; David Penny has written that Darwin did not use the tree of life to describe the relationship between groups of organisms, but to suggest that, as with branches in a living tree, lineages of species competed with and supplanted one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Penny |first=D. |year=2011 |title=Darwin's Theory of Descent with Modification, versus the Biblical Tree of Life |journal=PLoS Biology |volume=9 |issue=7 |page=e1001096 | doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001096 |pmid=21750664 |pmc=3130011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petter Hellström has demonstrated that Darwin consciously chose to name his tree after the biblical [[Tree of life (biblical)|tree of life]], as described in [[Genesis creation narrative|Genesis]], thus relating his theory to Christian mythology, and suggesting that he did so to mobilise the imagination of his readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petter Hellström | first1 = Nils | year = 2012 | title = Darwin and the tree of life: the roots the evolutionary tree | url = http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:uu:diva-185510| journal = Archives of Natural History | volume = 39 | issue = 2| pages = 234–252 | doi = 10.3366/anh.2012.0092 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

[[Ernst Haeckel]] (1834–1919) constructed several trees of life. His first sketch (in the 1860s) of his famous tree of life shows "''Pithecanthropus alalus''" as the ancestor of ''Homo sapiens''. His 1866 tree of life from ''Generelle Morphologie der Organismen'' shows three kingdoms: Plantae, Protista and Animalia. His 1879 'Pedigree of Man' was published in ''The Evolution of Man''.

==Contemporary usage==

'''Valentinian II''' ({{lang-la|Flavius Valentinianus Augustus}}; 371{{snd}}15 May 392), was [[Roman Emperor]] from AD 375 to 392.

==Early life and accession (371–375)==
Flavius Valentinianus was born to Emperor [[Valentinian I]] and his second wife, [[Justina (empress)|Justina]]. He was the half-brother of Valentinian's other son, [[Gratian]], who had shared the imperial title with his father since 367. He had three sisters: [[Galla (wife of Theodosius I)|Galla]], Grata and Justa. The elder Valentinian died on campaign in Pannonia in 375. Neither Gratian (then in [[Trier]]) nor his uncle [[Valens]] (emperor for the East) were consulted by the army commanders on the scene. Instead of merely acknowledging Gratian as his father's successor, Valentinian I's generals acclaimed the four-year-old Valentinian [[Augustus (honorific)|''augustus'']] on 22 November 375. The army, and its Frankish general [[Merobaudes (general)|Merobaudes]], may have been uneasy about Gratian's lack of military ability, and so raised a boy who would not immediately aspire to military command.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.roman-emperors.org/valenii.htm | title = Valentinian II | publisher = Roman emperors}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn | Curran | 1998 | p = 86}}

==Reign from Milan (375–387)==
{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2017}}
[[File:Solidus of Valentinian II (YORYM 1998 853) obverse.jpg|thumb|Solidus of Valentinian II]]
Gratian, forced to accommodate the generals who supported his half-brother, governed the trans-alpine provinces (including [[Gaul]], [[Hispania]], and [[Roman Britain|Britain]]), while [[Italy]], part of [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyricum]], and [[North Africa]] were under the rule of Valentinian. In 378, their uncle, the Emperor [[Valens]], was killed in battle with the [[Goths]] at [[Battle of Adrianople|Adrianople]], and Gratian invited the general [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]] to be emperor in the [[Eastern Roman Empire|East]]. As a child, Valentinian II was under the influence of his [[Arianism|Arian]] mother, the Empress Justina, and the imperial court at [[Milan]], an influence contested by the [[Nicene Christianity|Nicene]] [[bishop]] of Milan, [[Ambrose]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Valentinian I.|display=Valentinian I. s.v. Valetinian II.|volume=27|pages=851–852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justina used her influence over her young son to oppose the Nicean party which was championed by Ambrose. In 385 Ambrose refused an imperial request to hand over the [[Portian basilica]] for the celebration of Easter by the Imperial court.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Gibbon, ''The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire'', (The Modern Library, 1932), chap. XXVII., p. 976&lt;/ref&gt; When he was summoned to be punished to the Imperial palace, the orthodox populace rioted, and Justina's Gothic troops were prevented by the arch-bishop himself, standing in the doorway, from entering the Basilica. Justina was forced to back down.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, p. 977&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Justina ordered legislation to rescind the penalties enacted by Gratian and Valentinian against heresy, proclaiming universal toleration.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, p. 978&lt;/ref&gt; When Ambrose was found, as no doubt she had intended, to have determinedly infracted the new laws, Justina again tried to have him banished, and Ambrose was forced to barricade himself, with the enthusiastic backing of the people, within the walls of the Basilica. The Imperial troops besieged him, but Ambrose held on, reinforcing the resolution of his followers by allegedly unearthing, beneath the foundations of the church, the bodies of two ancient martyrs.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, p. 979&lt;/ref&gt; Theodosius, the orthodox emperor of the east, interceded, forcing Justina to again relent.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, p. 980&lt;/ref&gt; [[Magnus Maximus]] was to use the emperor's heterodoxy against him.  Valentinian also tried to restrain the despoiling of pagan temples in [[Rome]]. Buoyed by this instruction, the pagan [[Roman Senate|senators]], led by [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus|Aurelius Symmachus]], the [[Praefectus urbi|Prefect of Rome]], petitioned in 384 for the restoration of the [[Altar of Victory]] in the [[Curia Julia|Senate House]], which had been removed by Gratian in 382. Valentinian, at the insistence of Ambrose, refused the request and, in so doing, rejected the traditions and rituals of pagan Rome to which Symmachus had appealed.

In 383, Magnus Maximus, commander of the armies in Britain, declared himself Emperor and established himself in Gaul and Hispania.  Gratian died while fleeing him.  For a time the court of Valentinian, through the mediation of Ambrose, came to an accommodation with the usurper, and Theodosius recognized Maximus as co-emperor of the [[Western Roman Empire|West]]. In 386 or 387, Maximus crossed the [[Alps]] into the [[Po River|Po]] valley and threatened Milan. Valentinian II and Justina fled to Theodosius in [[Thessalonica]].  The latter came to an agreement, cemented by his marriage to Valentinian's sister [[Galla (wife of Theodosius)|Galla]], to restore the young emperor in the West.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;  In 388, Theodosius marched west and defeated Maximus. Although he was to appoint both of his sons emperor ([[Arcadius]] in 383, [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] in 393), Theodosius remained loyal to the dynasty of Valentinian I.

==Reign from Vienne (388–392)==
[[Image:Solidus Valentinian II trier RIC 090a.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A [[solidus (coin)|solidus]] minted by Valentinian II. On the reverse, both Valentinian and [[Theodosius I]] are celebrated as victorious.]]
After the defeat of Maximus, Theodosius remained in Milan until 391. Valentinian took no part in Theodosius's [[Roman triumph|triumphal celebrations]] over Maximus. Valentinian and his court were installed at [[Vienne, Isère|Vienne]] in Gaul, while Theodosius appointed key administrators in the West and had coins minted, which implied his guardianship over the 17-year-old.{{Sfn | Croke | 1976 | pp = 235f}}  Justina had already died, and Vienne was far away from the influence of Ambrose. Theodosius's trusted general, the [[Franks|Frank]] [[Arbogast (general)|Arbogast]], was appointed [[magister militum]] for the Western provinces (bar Africa) and guardian of Valentinian. Acting in the name of Valentinian, Arbogast was actually subordinate only to Theodosius.{{Sfn|Williams|Friell|p=126}} While the general campaigned successfully on the Rhine, the young emperor remained at Vienne, in contrast to his warrior father and his older brother, who had campaigned at his age. Arbogast's domination over the emperor was considerable, and the general even murdered [[Harmonius]], a friend of Valentinian suspected of taking bribes, in the emperor's presence.{{Sfn | Croke | 1976 | p = 237}}

The crisis reached a peak when Arbogast prohibited the emperor from leading the Gallic armies into Italy to oppose a barbarian threat. Valentinian, in response, formally dismissed Arbogast. The latter ignored the order, publicly tearing it up and arguing that Valentinian had not appointed him in the first place. The reality of where the power lay was openly displayed. Valentinian wrote to Theodosius and Ambrose complaining of his subordination to his general. In explicit rejection of his earlier Arianism, he invited Ambrose to come to Vienne to [[baptism|baptize]] him.

On 15 May 392, Valentinian was found hanged in his residence in Vienne. Arbogast maintained that the emperor's death was suicide. Most sources agree, however, that Arbogast murdered him with his own hands, or paid the Praetorians. [[Zosimus]] writing in the early sixth century from Constantinople, states that Arbogast had Valentinian murdered;&lt;ref&gt;''Historia nova'', IV. 53 which relies heavily on the history by the pagan [[Eunapius]]&lt;/ref&gt; ancient authorities being divided in their opinion.{{Sfn | Croke | 1976}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date = August 2012}} Ambrose's eulogy is the only contemporary Western source for Valentinian's death.&lt;ref&gt;''De obitu Valentiniani consolatio''&lt;/ref&gt; It is ambiguous on the question of the emperor's death, which is not surprising, as Ambrose represents him as a model of Christian virtue. Suicide, not murder, would make the bishop dissemble on this key question.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | others = JHWG Liebeschuetz, tr | first = Ambrose | last = of Milan | title = Political Letters and Speeches | publisher = Liverpool University Press | year = 2005 | page = 359}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The young man's body was conveyed in ceremony to Milan for burial by Ambrose, mourned by his sisters Justa and Grata. He was laid in a [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] [[sarcophagus]] next to his brother Gratian, most probably in the Chapel of Sant'Aquilino attached to [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Milan#Chapel of Saint Aquilino|San Lorenzo]].{{Refn | group = "lower-alpha" |The bottom of the sarcophagus may be identical to a porphyry tub (''labrum'') now in the Duomo of Milan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Mark J | last = Johnson | title = On the Burial Places of the Valentinian Dynasty | journal = Historia | volume = 40 | issue = 4 | year = 1991 | pages = 501–6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At first Arbogast recognized Theodosius's son Arcadius as emperor in the West, seemingly surprised by his charge's death.{{Sfn | Croke | 1976 | p = 244}}  After three months, during which he had no communication from Theodosius, Arbogast selected an imperial official, [[Eugenius]], as emperor. Theodosius initially tolerated this regime but, in January 393, elevated the eight-year-old Honorius as ''augustus'' to succeed Valentinian II. Civil war ensued and, in 394, Theodosius defeated Eugenius and Arbogast at the Battle of Frigidus River.

==Significance==
Valentinian himself seems to have exercised no real authority, and was a figurehead for various powerful interests: his mother, his co-emperors, and powerful generals. Since the [[Crisis of the Third Century]], the empire had been ruled by powerful generals, a situation formalised by [[Diocletian]] and his collegiate system. While [[Constantine I]] and his sons had been strong military figures, they had also re-established the practice of hereditary succession, adopted by Valentinian I. The obvious flaw in these two competing requirements came in the reign of Valentinian II, a child.{{Sfn|Williams|Friell|p=42}} His reign was a harbinger of the fifth century, when children or nonentities, reigning as emperors, were controlled by powerful generals and officials.

'''William W. Brown''' or '''W. W. Brown''' (died October 1871) was an [[Americans|American]] merchant and pioneer settler of [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]] who served in the [[Wisconsin State Assembly]] for one year, as a member of the [[1st Wisconsin Legislature]] in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legis.state.wi.us/lrb/pubs/ib/99ib1.pdf "Members of the Wisconsin Legislature 1848&amp;ndash;1999 State of Wisconsin Legislative Bureau. Information Bulletin 99-1, September 1999. p. 33]&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown came early to Milwaukee, a contemporary of [[George H. Walker]], [[Byron Kilbourn]], and [[Don A. J. Upham]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/WI.V008 Childs, Ebenezer "Recollections of Wisconsin Since 1820", p. 186; in Draper, Lyman C., et al. "Document M: Fourth and Fifth Annual Reports and Collections of State Historical Society, in, ''Annual message of Alexander W. Randall, governor of the state of Wisconsin, and accompanying documents'' Madison: James Ross, State Printer, 1860 (Covers 1858/1859)]&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[ship]] built in Milwaukee, the 30-ton [[sloop]] ''Wenona'', was built for Brown by George Barber in 1835. By 1842, Brown also owned the 100-ton [[schooner]] ''Fur Trader'', and was an active merchant in Milwaukee (his Wm. Brown and Company was one of the first businesses in Milwaukee). He was sometimes called "Double-Headed Brown" to distinguish him from another William Brown, with whom he was at one time in business partnership.

He served as a [[General contractor|contractor]] building the mile-long [[canal]] in Milwaukee for Kilbourn and [[Increase Lapham]]'s Rock River Canal Company, which was begun in April 1841 and ready for use by December 1842.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/WI.V008 Holton, Edward W. "Commercial History of Milwaukee", pp. 256, 263, 265, 281; in Draper, Lyman C., et al. "Document M: Fourth and Fifth Annual Reports and Collections of State Historical Society, in, ''Annual message of Alexander W. Randall, governor of the state of Wisconsin, and accompanying documents'' Madison: James Ross, State Printer, 1860 (Covers 1858/1859)]&lt;/ref&gt; This was the only portion of the canal which would ever be built; the bed thereof later became Commerce Street in Milwaukee's [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee#Beerline B|Beerline B]] neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzsonn, Axel. ''Steam &amp; Cinders: The Advent of Railroads in Wisconsin'' Madison: Wisconsin Historical Society, 2010; pp. 50-51&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislative service and political activism ==
In 1839, Brown, a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]], was a candidate for [[Assessor (property)|Assessor]] in Milwaukee.&lt;ref&gt;"Whig Nominations" April 1, 1839; p. 4, col. 1&lt;/ref&gt; He served in the House of Representatives of the [[Wisconsin Territory]] for one term representing [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee County]] in the first 1847 session.&lt;ref&gt;Watrous, Jerome A. ''Memoirs of Milwaukee County, from the Earliest Historical Times Down to the Present, Including a Genealogical and Biographical Record of Representative Families in Milwaukee County'' Madison: Western Historical Association, 1909. Vol. 1, pp. 91-92&lt;/ref&gt; After statehood, he was elected in 1848 to the 3rd Milwaukee County Assembly district (the 3rd [[wards of the United States|Ward]] of the City of Milwaukee). He was a candidate for re-election in 1849,&lt;ref&gt;"Whig Nominations" ''[[Milwaukee Sentinel|Milwaukee Sentinel and Gazette]]'' November 3, 1849; p. 2, col. 1]&lt;/ref&gt; but was not elected. (The Assembly was re-districted, and it is unclear who succeeded him.)

In 1851, he came in 7th out of 8 candidates for [[alderman]] in the Third Ward.&lt;ref&gt;"Local Matters:Charter Election Returns". ''Daily Free Democrat'' May 21, 1851; p. 3, col. 1&lt;/ref&gt; He was successful in 1852, coming in first out of four candidates.&lt;ref&gt;"Milwaukee Charter Election: Ward Officers." ''[[Weekly Wisconsin]]'' March 10, 1852; p. 1, col. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected as a delegate to the [[1852 Whig National Convention]],&lt;ref&gt;"Whig State Convention" ''[[Oshkosh Democrat]]'' October 10, 1851; p. 2, cols. 5-6&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1852 was the Whig candidate for [[Sheriff]] of Milwaukee County.&lt;ref&gt;"Whig Nominations: Scott County Ticket" ''Milwaukee Daily Sentinel'' October 28, 1852; p. 2, col. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Private life ==
In 1851, he was among the incorporators (along with Kilbourn, Upham and others) of the Milwaukee and Humboldt [[plank road|Plank Road]] Company.&lt;ref&gt;Odell, R. H., compiler. ''Official Directory of Corporations of Milwaukee, Wisconsin'' Milwaukee: Odell &amp; Owen, 1904; p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Milwaukee pioneer historian James Smith Buck described Brown's final years as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;Few men have ever lived in Milwaukee who were more widely known, or less thought of (when we take into consideration his ability, for he was a very smart man,) than William W. Brown. Had he devoted his talents to a proper use, his memory would have been respected; but he did not, and finally died, deserted and alone. I shall never forget the look of utter despair that sat upon his face as I met him for the last time, in October, 1871... wending his weary way to the European Hotel, which he never left again alive; it said plainly enough, "This is the end of a misspent life."... He died a few days later, and I remember the difficulty his few remaining friends (and I could name them all,) had, to get help enough to get his body from his room to the hearse.&lt;ref&gt;Buck, James Smith. ''Pioneer History of Milwaukee: From the First American Settlement in 1833 to 1846'' Milwaukee: Symes, Swain &amp; Co., Book and Job Printers, 1881; Vol. 2, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
