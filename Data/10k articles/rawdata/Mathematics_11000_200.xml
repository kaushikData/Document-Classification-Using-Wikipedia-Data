[[File:Oesterle Joseph.jpg|thumb|French mathematician Joseph  Oesterlé]]
[[File:David Masser.jpg|thumb|British mathematician David Masser]]
The '''''abc'' conjecture''' (also known as the '''Oesterlé–Masser conjecture''') is a [[conjecture]] in [[number theory]], first proposed by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Joseph  Oesterlé|first=Joseph|last=Oesterlé|year=1988}} and {{harvs|txt|authorlink=David Masser|first=David|last=Masser|year=1985}}. It is stated in terms of three positive integers, ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' (hence the name) that are [[coprime integers|relatively prime]] and satisfy ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c''. If ''d'' denotes the product of the distinct [[prime factor]]s of ''abc'', the conjecture essentially states that ''d'' is usually not much smaller than ''c''. In other words: if ''a'' and ''b'' are composed from large powers of primes, then ''c'' is usually not divisible by large powers of primes. The precise statement is given below.

The ''abc'' conjecture originated as the outcome of attempts by Oesterlé and Masser to understand the [[Szpiro conjecture]] about elliptic curves.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Arithmetic deformation theory via arithmetic fundamental groups and nonarchimedean theta functions, notes on the work of Shinichi Mochizuki|journal=Europ. J. Math.|first=Ivan|last=Fesenko|volume=1 | pages=405–440 | year=2015 |url=https://www.maths.nottingham.ac.uk/personal/ibf/notesoniut.pdf |doi=10.1007/s40879-015-0066-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter conjecture has more geometric structures involved in its statement in comparison with the ''abc'' conjecture.

The ''abc'' conjecture and its versions express, in concentrated form, some fundamental feature of various problems in Diophantine geometry. A number of famous conjectures and theorems in number theory would follow immediately from the ''abc'' conjecture or its versions. {{harvtxt|Goldfeld|1996}} described the ''abc'' conjecture as "the most important unsolved problem in [[Diophantine analysis]]".

Various proofs of abc have been claimed but so far none is accepted by the mathematical community. 

==Formulations==
Before we state the conjecture we introduce the notion of the  [[radical of an integer]]: for a [[positive integer]] ''n'', the radical of ''n'', denoted rad(''n''), is the product of the distinct [[prime factor]]s of ''n''. For example

:rad(16) = rad(2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;) = 2,
:rad(17) = 17,
:rad(18) = rad(2 ⋅ 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = 2 · 3 = 6,
:rad(1000000) = rad(2&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;  ⋅ 5&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;) = 2 ⋅ 5 = 10.

If ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' are [[coprime]]&lt;ref&gt;When ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'', coprimeness of ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' implies [[pairwise coprime]]ness of ''a'', ''b'', ''c''. So in this case, it does not matter which concept we use.&lt;/ref&gt; positive integers such that ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'', it turns out that "usually" ''c'' &lt; rad(''abc''). The ''abc conjecture'' deals with the exceptions. Specifically, it states that:

:'''ABC Conjecture.''' For every positive real number ''ε'', there exist only finitely many triples (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of coprime positive integers, with ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'', such that:
::&lt;math&gt;c&gt;\operatorname{rad}(abc)^{1+\varepsilon}.&lt;/math&gt;

An equivalent formulation states that:

:'''ABC Conjecture II.''' For every positive real number ''ε'', there exists a constant ''K&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt;'' such that for all triples (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of  coprime positive integers, with ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'':
::&lt;math&gt;c &lt; K_{\varepsilon} \cdot \operatorname{rad}(abc)^{1+\varepsilon}.&lt;/math&gt;

A third equivalent formulation of the conjecture involves the ''quality'' ''q''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of the triple (''a'', ''b'', ''c''), defined as

: &lt;math&gt; q(a, b, c) = \frac{ \log(c) }{ \log( \operatorname{rad}( abc ) ) }.&lt;/math&gt;

For example,

:''q''(4, 127, 131) = log(131) / log(rad(4·127·131)) = log(131) / log(2·127·131) = 0.46820...
:''q''(3, 125, 128) = log(128) / log(rad(3·125·128)) = log(128) / log(30) = 1.426565...

A typical triple (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of coprime positive integers with ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'' will have ''c'' &lt; rad(''abc''), i.e. ''q''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') &lt; 1. Triples with ''q'' &gt; 1 such as in the second example are rather special, they consist of numbers divisible by high powers of small [[prime number]]s.

:'''ABC Conjecture III.''' For every positive real number ''ε'', there exist only finitely many triples (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of coprime positive integers with ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'' such that ''q''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') &gt; 1 + ''ε''.

Whereas it is known that there are infinitely many triples (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of coprime positive integers with ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'' such that ''q''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') &gt; 1, the conjecture predicts that only finitely many of those have ''q'' &gt; 1.01 or ''q'' &gt; 1.001 or even ''q'' &gt; 1.0001, etc. In particular, if the conjecture is true then there must exist a triple (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') which achieves the maximal possible quality ''q''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') .

==Examples of triples with small radical==
The condition that ''ε'' &gt; 0 is necessary as there exist infinitely many triples ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' with rad(''abc'') &lt; ''c''. For example let:

:&lt;math&gt;a =1, \quad b = 2^{6n} -1, \quad c = 2^{6n}, \qquad n &gt; 1.&lt;/math&gt;

First we note that ''b'' is divisible by 9:

:&lt;math&gt; b = 2^{6n} -1  =  64^n -1 = (64 - 1) (\cdots) = 9 \cdot 7 \cdot (\cdots)&lt;/math&gt;

Using this fact we calculate:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\operatorname{rad}(abc) &amp;= \operatorname{rad}(a) \operatorname{rad}(b) \operatorname{rad}(c) \\
&amp;= \operatorname{rad}(1)  \operatorname{rad} \left ( 2^{6n} -1 \right ) \operatorname{rad} \left (2^{6n} \right ) \\
&amp;= 2 \operatorname{rad} \left ( 2^{6n} -1 \right ) \\
&amp;= 2 \operatorname{rad} \left ( 9 \cdot \tfrac{b}{9} \right )  \\
&amp;\leqslant 2 \cdot 3  \cdot \tfrac{b}{9} \\
&amp;= 2 \tfrac{b}{3} \\
&amp;&lt; \tfrac{2}{3} c
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

By replacing the exponent 6''n'' by other exponents forcing ''b'' to have larger square factors, the ratio between the radical and ''c'' can be made arbitrarily small. Specifically, let ''p'' &gt; 2 be a prime and consider:

:&lt;math&gt;a =1, \quad b = 2^{p(p-1)n} -1, \quad c = 2^{p(p-1)n}, \qquad n &gt; 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Now we claim that ''b'' is divisible by ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
b &amp;= 2^{p(p-1)n} -1 \\
&amp;= \left (2^{p(p-1)} \right )^n - 1 \\
&amp;= \left ( 2^{p(p-1)} - 1 \right ) (\cdots) \\
&amp;= p^2 \cdot r (\cdots)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The last step uses the fact that ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; divides 2&lt;sup&gt;''p''(''p''-1)&lt;/sup&gt;-1. This follows from [[Fermat's little theorem]], which shows that, for ''p''&gt;2, 2&lt;sup&gt;''p''-1&lt;/sup&gt;=''pk''+1 for some integer ''k''. Raising both sides to the power of ''p'' then shows that 2&lt;sup&gt;''p''(''p''-1)&lt;/sup&gt;=''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(...)+1.

And now with a similar calculation as above we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{rad}(abc) &lt; \tfrac{2}{p} c&lt;/math&gt;

A list of the [[#Highest-quality triples|highest-quality triples]] (triples with a particularly small radical relative to ''c'') is given below; the highest quality, 1.6299, was found by Eric Reyssat {{harv|Lando|Zvonkin|2004|p=137}} for
:''a'' = 2,
:''b'' = 3&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;·109 = 6,436,341,
:''c'' = 23&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; = 6,436,343,
:rad(''abc'') = 15042.

==Some consequences==

The ''abc'' conjecture has a large number of consequences. These include both known results (some of which have been proven separately since the conjecture has been stated) and conjectures for which it gives a [[conditional proof]]. While an earlier proof of the conjecture would have been more significant in terms of consequences, the ''abc'' conjecture itself remains of interest for the other conjectures it would prove, together with its numerous links with deep questions in number theory.
* [[Thue–Siegel–Roth theorem]] on diophantine approximation of algebraic numbers.{{sfnp|Bombieri|1994}}
* The [[Mordell conjecture]] (already proven in general by [[Gerd Faltings]]).{{sfnp|Elkies|1991}}
* It is equivalent to [[Vojta's conjecture]] (in dimension 1).{{sfnp|Van Frankenhuijsen|2002}}
* The [[Erdős–Woods number|Erdős–Woods conjecture]] except for a finite number of counterexamples.{{sfnp|Langevin|1993}}
* The existence of infinitely many non-[[Wieferich prime]]s in every base ''b'' &gt; 1.{{sfnp|Silverman|1988}}
* The weak form of [[Marshall Hall's conjecture]] on the separation between squares and cubes of integers.{{sfnp|Nitaj|1996}}
* The [[Fermat–Catalan conjecture]], a generalization of Fermat's last theorem concerning powers that are sums of powers.{{sfnp|Pomerance|2008}}
* The [[Dirichlet L-function|''L''-function]] ''L''(''s'', ''χ&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'') formed with the [[Legendre symbol]], has no [[Siegel zero]] (this consequence actually requires a uniform version of the ''abc'' conjecture in number fields, not only the ''abc'' conjecture as formulated above for rational integers).{{sfnp|Granville|Stark|2000}}
* A [[polynomial]] ''P''(''x'') has only finitely many [[perfect powers]] for all [[integers]] ''x'' if ''P'' have at least three simple zeros.&lt;ref name="Ref_a"&gt;[http://www.math.uu.nl/people/beukers/ABCpresentation.pdf The ABC-conjecture], Frits Beukers, ABC-DAY, Leiden, Utrecht University, 9 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A generalization of [[Tijdeman's theorem]] concerning the number of solutions of ''y&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' = ''x&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' + ''k'' (Tijdeman's theorem answers the case ''k'' = 1), and Pillai's conjecture (1931) concerning the number of solutions of ''Ay&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' = ''Bx&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' + ''k''.
* It is equivalent to the Granville–Langevin conjecture, that if ''f'' is a square-free binary form of degree ''n'' &gt; 2, then for every real ''β'' &gt; 2 there is a constant ''C''(''f'', ''β'') such that for all coprime integers ''x'', ''y'', the radical of ''f''(''x'', ''y'') exceeds ''C'' · max{|''x''|, |''y''|}&lt;sup&gt;''n''−''β''&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Mollin|2009}}; {{harvtxt|Mollin|2010|p=297}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is equivalent to the modified [[Szpiro conjecture]], which would yield a bound of rad(''abc'')&lt;sup&gt;1.2+''ε''&lt;/sup&gt;.{{sfnp|Oesterlé|1988}}.
* {{harvtxt|Dąbrowski|1996}} has shown that the ''abc'' conjecture implies that [[Brocard's problem|the Diophantine equation ''n''! + ''A'' = ''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] has only finitely many solutions for any given integer ''A''.
* There are ~''c''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;''N'' positive integers ''n'' ≤ ''N'' for which ''f''(''n'')/B' is square-free, with ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0 a positive constant defined as:{{sfnp|Granville|1998}}
::&lt;math&gt;c_f = \prod_{\text{prime }p} x_i \left ( 1 - \frac{\omega\,\!_f (p)}{p^{2+q_p}} \right ).&lt;/math&gt;
*[[Fermat's Last Theorem]] has a famously difficult proof by Andrew Wiles. However it follows easily, at least for &lt;math&gt;n \ge 6&lt;/math&gt;, from an effective form of a weak version of the abc conjecture. The abc conjecture says the [[Limit superior and limit inferior|lim sup]] of the set of all qualities (defined above) is 1, which implies the much weaker assertion that there is a finite upper bound for qualities. The conjecture that 2 is such an upper bound suffices for a very short proof of Fermat's Last Theorem for &lt;math&gt;n \ge 6&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Granville | first1 = Andrew | last2 = Tucker | first2 = Thomas | year = 2002 | title = It's As Easy As abc | url = http://www.ams.org/notices/200210/fea-granville.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Notices of the AMS | volume = 49 | issue = 10| pages = 1224–1231 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Beal conjecture]], a generalization of Fermat's last theorem proposing that if ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' are positive integers with ''A&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;'' + ''B&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;'' = ''C&lt;sup&gt;z&lt;/sup&gt;'' and ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' &gt; 2, then ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' have a common prime factor.

==Theoretical results==
The abc conjecture implies that ''c'' can be [[upper bound|bounded above]] by a near-linear function of the radical of ''abc''. However, [[exponential function|exponential]] bounds are known. Specifically, the following bounds have been proven:

:&lt;math&gt;c &lt; \exp{ \left(K_1 \operatorname{rad}(abc)^{15}\right) } &lt;/math&gt; {{harv|Stewart|Tijdeman|1986}},
:&lt;math&gt;c &lt; \exp{ \left(K_2 \operatorname{rad}(abc)^{\frac{2}{3} + \varepsilon}\right) } &lt;/math&gt; {{harv|Stewart|Yu|1991}}, and
:&lt;math&gt;c &lt; \exp{ \left(K_3 \operatorname{rad}(abc)^{\frac{1}{3} + \varepsilon}\right) } &lt;/math&gt; {{harv|Stewart|Yu|2001}}.

In these bounds, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[Constant (mathematics)|constant]] that does not depend on ''a'', ''b'', or ''c'', and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are constants that depend on ''ε'' (in an [[effectively computable]] way) but not on ''a'', ''b'', or ''c''. The bounds apply to any triple for which ''c'' &gt; 2.

==Computational results==
In 2006, the Mathematics Department of [[Leiden University]] in the Netherlands, together with the Dutch Kennislink science institute, launched the [[ABC@Home]] project, a [[grid computing]] system, which aims to discover additional triples ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' with rad(''abc'') &lt; ''c''. Although no finite set of examples or counterexamples can resolve the ''abc'' conjecture, it is hoped that patterns in the triples discovered by this project will lead to insights about the conjecture and about number theory more generally.

==Refined forms, generalizations and related statements==
The ''abc'' conjecture is an integer analogue of the [[Mason–Stothers theorem]] for polynomials.

A strengthening, proposed by {{Harvtxt|Baker|1998}}, states that in the ''abc'' conjecture one can replace rad(''abc'') by

:''ε''&lt;sup&gt;−''ω''&lt;/sup&gt; rad(''abc''),

where ''ω'' is the total number of distinct primes dividing ''a'', ''b'' and ''c''.{{sfnp|Bombieri|Gubler|2006|p=404}}

[[Andrew Granville]] noticed that the minimum of the function &lt;math&gt; ({\varepsilon}^{-\omega}\operatorname{rad}(abc))^{1+\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt; {\varepsilon}&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; occurs when &lt;math&gt; {\varepsilon}= \frac{\omega}{\log(\operatorname{rad}(abc))}.&lt;/math&gt;

This incited {{Harvtxt|Baker|2004}} to propose a sharper form of the ''abc'' conjecture, namely:
:&lt;math&gt;c&lt;{\kappa}\operatorname{rad}(abc)\frac{(\log(\operatorname{rad}(abc)))^{\omega}}{\omega!}&lt;/math&gt;
with ''κ'' an absolute constant. After some computational experiments he found that a value of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{6}{5}&lt;/math&gt; was admissible for ''κ''.

This version is called "explicit ''abc'' conjecture".

{{Harvtxt|Baker|1998}} also describes related conjectures of [[Andrew Granville]] that would give upper bounds on ''c'' of the form

:&lt;math&gt; K^{\Omega(a b c)} \mathrm{rad}(a b c),&lt;/math&gt;

where Ω(''n'') is the total number of prime factors of ''n'' and

:&lt;math&gt; O(\mathrm{rad}(a b c) \Theta(a b c)),&lt;/math&gt;

where Θ(''n'') is the number of integers up to ''n'' divisible only by primes dividing ''n''.

{{Harvtxt|Robert|Stewart|Tenenbaum|2014}} proposed a more precise inequality based on {{Harvtxt|Robert|Tenenbaum|2013}}.
Let ''k'' = rad(''abc''). They conjectured there is a constant ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt; c&lt;k\exp\left(4\sqrt{\frac{3\log k}{\log\log k}}\left(1+\frac{\log\log\log k}{2\log\log k}+\frac{C_{1}}{\log\log k}\right)\right) &lt;/math&gt;

holds whereas there is a constant ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt; c&gt;k\exp\left(4\sqrt{\frac{3\log k}{\log\log k}}\left(1+\frac{\log\log\log k}{2\log\log k}+\frac{C_{2}}{\log\log k}\right)\right) &lt;/math&gt;

holds infinitely often.

{{harvtxt|Browkin|Brzeziński|1994}} formulated the [[n conjecture]]—a version of the ''abc'' conjecture involving ''n'' &gt; 2 integers.

==Claimed proofs of abc==

[[Lucien Szpiro]] proposed a solution in 2007, but it was found to be incorrect shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;"Finiteness Theorems for Dynamical Systems", [[Lucien Szpiro]], talk at  Conference on L-functions and Automorphic Forms (on the occasion of Dorian Goldfeld's 60th Birthday), Columbia University, May 2007. See {{citation|title=Proof of the abc Conjecture?|first=Peter|last=Woit|authorlink=Peter Woit|work=Not Even Wrong|url=http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=561|date=May 26, 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012 [[Shinichi Mochizuki]] claimed a proof of the abc conjecture.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last1=Ball |first1=Peter |date= 10 September 2012|title=Proof claimed for deep connection between primes |url=https://www.nature.com/news/proof-claimed-for-deep-connection-between-primes-1.11378 |journal=Nature |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi=10.1038/nature.2012.11378 |access-date=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He released a series of four preprints developing a new theory called [[Inter-universal Teichmüller theory]] (IUTT) which is then applied to prove several famous conjectures in number theory, including the abc conjecture but also [[Szpiro's conjecture]], the hyperbolic [[Vojta's conjecture]].&lt;ref name=Mochizukiweb&gt;
Mochizuki, Shinichi (May 2015). ''Inter-universal Teichmuller Theory IV: Log-volume Computations and Set-theoretic Foundations'', available at http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~motizuki/papers-english.html&lt;/ref&gt;
The papers have not been accepted by the mathematical community as providing a proof of abc.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=https://galoisrepresentations.wordpress.com/2017/12/17/the-abc-conjecture-has-still-not-been-proved/ |title=The ABC conjecture has still not been proved |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=December 17, 2017 |access-date=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not only because of their impenetrability,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[New Scientist]]|title=Baffling ABC maths proof now has impenetrable 300-page 'summary'|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2146647-baffling-abc-maths-proof-now-has-impenetrable-300-page-summary/|first=Timothy|last=Revell|date=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
but also because at least one specific point in the argument has been identified as a gap by some other experts.&lt;ref&gt;

and have attempted to communicate their understanding via workshops on inter-universal Teichmüller theory, this has failed to convince the number theory community at large.&lt;ref&gt;

In March 2018, [[Peter Scholze]] and [[Jakob Stix]] visited [[Kyoto University| Kyoto ]] for discussions with Mochizuki;
''see the [[Inter-universal_Teichm%C3%BCller_theory#History | History ]] section of the article on IUTT for details''.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Ana M. L. G. Cannas da Silva''' (born 1968) is a Portuguese mathematician specializing in [[symplectic geometry]] and [[geometric topology]]. She works in Switzerland as a senior scientist in mathematics at [[ETH Zurich]].{{r|cv}}

Cannas was born in [[Lisbon]]. After studying at [[St. John de Britto College]],{{r|belchior}} she earned a [[licenciatura]] in mathematics in 1990 from the [[Instituto Superior Técnico]] in the [[University of Lisbon]].{{r|cv}} She then went to the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] for graduate studies, earning a master's degree in 1994 and completing her Ph.D. in 1996. Her dissertation, ''Multiplicity Formulas for Orbifolds'', was supervised by [[Victor Guillemin]].{{r|cv|mgp}}

After a temporary position as Morrey Assistant Professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], Cannas returned to the Instituto Superior Técnico as a faculty member in 1997.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3856">In mathematics, the '''Askey–Gasper inequality''' is an inequality for [[Jacobi polynomial]]s proved by {{harvs|txt| first=Richard| last=Askey| authorlink=Richard Askey|first2=George|last2=Gasper|author2-link=George Gasper|year=1976}} and used in the proof of the [[Bieberbach conjecture]].

==Statement==
It states that if {{math|''β'' ≥ 0, ''α'' + ''β'' ≥ −2}}, and {{math|−1 ≤ ''x'' ≤ 1}} then

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^n \frac{P_k^{(\alpha,\beta)}(x)}{P_k^{(\beta,\alpha)}(1)} \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;P_k^{(\alpha,\beta)}(x)&lt;/math&gt;

is a Jacobi polynomial.

The case when {{math|''β'' {{=}} 0}} can also be written as

:&lt;math&gt;{}_3F_2 \left (-n,n+\alpha+2,\tfrac{1}{2}(\alpha+1);\tfrac{1}{2}(\alpha+3),\alpha+1;t \right)&gt;0, \qquad 0\leq t&lt;1, \quad \alpha&gt;-1.&lt;/math&gt;

In this form, with {{mvar|α}} a non-negative integer, the inequality was used by [[Louis de Branges]] in his proof of the [[de Branges's theorem|Bieberbach conjecture]].

==Proof==
{{harvs|txt|authorlink=Shalosh B. Ekhad|last=Ekhad|year=1993}} gave a short proof of this inequality, by combining the identity

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{(\alpha+2)_n}{n!} &amp;\times {}_3F_2 \left (-n,n+\alpha+2,\tfrac{1}{2}(\alpha+1);\tfrac{1}{2}(\alpha+3),\alpha+1;t \right) = \\
&amp;= \frac{\left(\tfrac{1}{2} \right)_j\left (\tfrac{\alpha}{2}+1 \right )_{n-j} \left (\tfrac{\alpha}{2}+\tfrac{3}{2} \right )_{n-2j}(\alpha+1)_{n-2j}}{j!\left (\tfrac{\alpha}{2}+\tfrac{3}{2} \right )_{n-j}\left (\tfrac{\alpha}{2}+\tfrac{1}{2} \right )_{n-2j}(n-2j)!} \times {}_3F_2\left (-n+2j,n-2j+\alpha+1,\tfrac{1}{2}(\alpha+1);\tfrac{1}{2}(\alpha+2),\alpha+1;t \right )
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

with the [[Clausen inequality]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2771">In mathematics, a '''bipartite matroid''' is a [[matroid]] all of whose circuits have [[even number|even]] size.

==Example==
A [[uniform matroid]] &lt;math&gt;U{}^r_n&lt;/math&gt; is bipartite if and only if &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is an odd number, because the circuits in such a matroid have size &lt;math&gt;r+1&lt;/math&gt;.

==Relation to bipartite graphs==
Eulerian matroids were defined by {{harvtxt|Welsh|1969}} as a generalization of the [[bipartite graph]]s, graphs in which every cycle has even size. A [[graphic matroid]] is bipartite if and only if it comes from a bipartite graph.&lt;ref name="w69"&gt;{{citation

==Duality with Eulerian matroids==
An [[Eulerian graph]] is one in which all vertices have even degree; Eulerian graphs may be disconnected. For [[planar graph]]s, the properties of being bipartite and Eulerian are dual: a planar graph is bipartite if and only if its [[dual graph]] is Eulerian. As Welsh showed, this duality extends to [[binary matroid]]s: a binary matroid is bipartite if and only if its [[dual matroid]] is an [[Eulerian matroid]], a matroid that can be partitioned into disjoint circuits.

For matroids that are not binary, the duality between Eulerian and bipartite matroids may break down. For instance, the uniform matroid &lt;math&gt;U{}^4_6&lt;/math&gt; is non-bipartite but its dual &lt;math&gt;U{}^2_6&lt;/math&gt; is Eulerian, as it can be partitioned into two 3-cycles. The self-dual uniform matroid &lt;math&gt;U{}^3_6&lt;/math&gt; is bipartite but not Eulerian.

==Computational complexity==
It is possible to test in [[polynomial time]] whether a given binary matroid is bipartite.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13904">In [[projective geometry]], a '''collineation''' is a one-to-one and onto map (a [[bijection]]) from one [[projective space]] to another, or from a projective space to itself, such that the images of [[collinear]] points are themselves collinear. A collineation is thus an ''[[isomorphism]]'' between projective spaces, or an [[automorphism]] from a projective space to itself. Some authors restrict the definition of collineation to the case where it is an automorphism.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, {{harvnb|Beutelspacher|Rosenbaum|1998|loc=p.21}}, {{harvnb|Casse|2006|loc=p. 56}} and {{harvnb|Yale|2004|loc=p. 226}}&lt;/ref&gt; The set of all collineations of a space to itself form a [[group (mathematics)|group]], called the '''collineation group'''.

==Definition==
Simply, a collineation is a one-to-one map from one projective space to another, or from a projective space to itself, such that the images of collinear points are themselves collinear. One may formalize this using various ways of presenting a projective space. Also, the case of the projective line is special, and hence generally treated differently.

===Linear algebra===
For a projective space defined in terms of linear algebra (as the projectivization of a vector space), a collineation is a map between the projective spaces that is [[order-preserving]] with respect to inclusion of subspaces.

Formally, let ''V'' be a vector space over a field ''K'' and ''W'' a vector space over a field ''L''.  Consider the projective spaces ''PG''(''V'') and ''PG''(''W''), consisting of the [[vector line]]s of ''V'' and ''W''.  
Call ''D''(''V'') and ''D''(''W'') the set of subspaces of ''V'' and ''W'' respectively.  A collineation from ''PG''(''V'') to ''PG''(''W'') is a map α : ''D''(''V'') → ''D''(''W''), such that:
* α is a bijection.
* ''A'' ⊆ ''B'' ⇔ α(''A'') ⊆ α(''B'') for all ''A'', ''B'' in ''D''(''V'').&lt;ref&gt;Geometers still commonly use an exponential type notation for functions and this condition will often appear as ''A'' ⊆ ''B'' ⇔ ''A''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; ⊆ ''B''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; for all ''A'', ''B'' in ''D''(''V'').&lt;/ref&gt;

===Axiomatically===
Given a [[Projective space#Axioms for projective space|projective space defined axiomatically]] in terms of an [[incidence structure]] (a set of points ''P,'' lines ''L,'' and an [[incidence relation]] ''I'' specifying which points lie on which lines, satisfying certain axioms), a collineation between projective spaces thus defined then being a bijective function ''f'' between the sets of points and a bijective function ''g'' between the set of lines, preserving the incidence relation.&lt;ref&gt;"Preserving the incidence relation" means that if point {{math|''p''}} is on line {{math|''l''}} then {{math|''f''(''p'')}} is in {{math|''g''(''l'')}}; formally, if {{math|(''p'', ''l'') ∈ ''I''}} then {{math|(''f''(''p''), ''g''(''l'')) ∈ ''I''′}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Every projective space of dimension greater than or equal to three is isomorphic to the [[projectivization]] of a linear space over a [[division ring]], so in these dimensions this definition is no more general than the linear-algebraic one above, but in dimension two there are other projective planes, namely the [[non-Desarguesian plane]]s, and this definition permits one to define collineations in such projective planes.

For dimension one, the set of points lying on a single projective line defines a projective space, and the resulting notion of collineation is just any bijection of the set.

===Collineations of the projective line===
For a projective space of dimension one (a projective line; the projectivization of a vector space of dimension two), all points are collinear, so the collineation group is exactly the [[symmetric group]] of the points of the projective line. This is different from the behavior in higher dimensions, and thus one gives a more restrictive definition, specified so that the [[#Fundamental theorem of projective geometry|fundamental theorem of projective geometry]] holds.

In this definition, when ''V'' has dimension two, a collineation from ''PG''(''V'') to ''PG''(''W'') is a map {{nowrap|''α'' : ''D''(''V'') → ''D''(''W'')}}, such that:
* The [[zero object (algebra)|zero subspace]] of ''V'' is mapped to the zero subspace of ''W''.
* ''V'' is mapped to ''W''.
* There is a nonsingular [[semilinear map]] ''β'' from ''V'' to ''W'' such that, for all ''v'' in ''V'',
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha(\langle v\rangle)=\langle \beta(v)\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
This last requirement ensures that collineations are all semilinear maps.

==Types==
The main examples of collineations are  projective linear transformations (also known as [[homography|homographies]]) and [[#Automorphic collineations|automorphic collineations]]. For projective spaces coming from a linear space, the [[#Fundamental theorem of projective geometry|fundamental theorem of projective geometry]] states that all collineations are a combination of these, as described below.
&lt;!-- This illustrates the pitfall of not restricting the definition of collineation. Correlations are not automorphisms of the projective space.

A [[duality (projective geometry)|duality]] is a collineation from a projective space onto its dual space, taking points to hyperplanes (and vice versa) and preserving incidence. A [[correlation (projective geometry)|correlation]] is a duality from a projective space onto itself (this implies that the space is self-dual). A [[pole and polar|polarity]] is an [[involution (mathematics)|involutory]] correlation.
--&gt;

===Projective linear transformations===

Projective linear transformations (homographies) are collineations (planes in a vector space correspond to lines in the associated projective space, and linear transformations map planes to planes, so projective linear transformations map lines to lines), but in general not all collineations are projective linear transformations. PGL is in general a proper subgroup of the collineation group.

===Automorphic collineations===
An '''{{Visible anchor|automorphic collineation}}''' is a map that, in coordinates, is a [[field automorphism]] applied to the coordinates.

==Fundamental theorem of projective geometry==
{{see also|Homography#Fundamental theorem of projective geometry}}
If the geometric dimension of a [[Pappus's hexagon theorem|pappian]] projective space is at least 2, then every collineation is the product of a homography (a projective linear transformation) and an automorphic collineation. More precisely, the collineation group is the [[projective semilinear group]], which is the [[semidirect product]] of homographies by automorphic collineations.

In particular, the collineations of {{nowrap|PG(2, '''R''')}} are exactly the homographies, as '''R''' has no nontrivial automorphisms (that is, Gal('''R'''/'''Q''') is trivial).

Suppose ''φ'' is a nonsingular semilinear map from ''V'' to ''W'', with the dimension of ''V'' at least three.  Define {{nowrap|''α'' : ''D''(''V'') → ''D''(''W'')}} by saying that {{nowrap|1=''Z''&lt;sup&gt;''α''&lt;/sup&gt; = { ''φ''(''z'') {{!}} ''z'' ∈ ''Z'' }{{null}}}} for all ''Z'' in ''D''(''V''). As ''φ'' is semilinear, one easily checks that this map is properly defined, and further more, as ''φ'' is not singular, it is bijective.  It is obvious now that ''α'' is a collineation.  We say that ''α'' is induced by ''φ''.

The fundamental theorem of projective geometry states the converse:

Suppose ''V'' is a vector space over a field ''K'' with dimension at least three, ''W'' is a vector space over a field ''L'', and ''α'' is a collineation from PG(''V'') to PG(''W'').  This implies ''K'' and ''L'' are isomorphic fields, ''V'' and ''W'' have the same dimension, and there is a semilinear map ''φ'' such that ''φ'' induces ''α''.

For {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 3}}, the collineation group is the [[projective semilinear group]], P&amp;Gamma;L – this is PGL, twisted by [[field automorphism]]s; formally, the [[semidirect product]] {{nowrap|P&amp;Gamma;L ≅ PGL ⋊ Gal(''K''/''k'')}}, where ''k'' is the [[prime field]] for ''K''.

===Linear structure===
Thus for ''K'' a prime field (&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_p&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;), we have {{nowrap|1=PGL = P&amp;Gamma;L}}, but for ''K'' not a prime field (such as &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_{p^n}&lt;/math&gt; for {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 2}} or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;), the projective linear group is in general a proper subgroup of the collineation group, which can be thought of as "transformations preserving a projective ''semi''-linear structure". Correspondingly, the quotient group {{nowrap|P&amp;Gamma;L / PGL ≅ Gal(''K''/''k'')}} corresponds to "choices of linear structure", with the identity (base point) being the existing linear structure. Given a projective space without an identification as the projectivization of a linear space, there is no natural isomorphism between the collineation group and PΓL, and the choice of a linear structure (realization as projectivization of a linear space) corresponds to a choice of subgroup {{nowrap|PGL &lt; P&amp;Gamma;L}}, these choices forming a [[torsor]] over Gal(''K''/''k'').

==History==
The idea of a [[line (geometry)|line]] was abstracted to a [[ternary relation]] determined by [[collinearity]] (points lying on a single line).   According to [[Wilhelm Blaschke]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Felix Klein]] (1926, 1949) ''Vorlesungen über Höhere Geometrie'', edited by Blaschke, Seite 138&lt;/ref&gt; it was [[August Möbius]] that first abstracted this essence of geometrical transformation:
:What do our geometric transformations mean now? Möbius threw out and fielded this question already in his ''Barycentric Calculus'' (1827). There he spoke not of ''transformations'' but of ''permutations'' [Verwandtschaften], when he said two elements drawn from a domain were ''permuted'' when they were interchanged by an arbitrary equation. In our particular case, linear equations between homogeneous point coordinates, Möbius called a permutation [Verwandtschaft] of both point spaces in particular a ''collineation''. This signification would be changed later by [[Michel Chasles|Chasles]] to ''homography''. Möbius’ expression is immediately comprehended when we follow Möbius in calling points [[collinear]] when they lie on the same line. Möbius' designation can be expressed by saying, collinear points are mapped by a permutation to collinear points, or in plain speech, straight lines stay straight.
Contemporary mathematicians view geometry as an [[incidence structure]] with an [[automorphism group]] consisting of mappings of the underlying space that preserve [[incidence (geometry)|incidence]]. Such a mapping permutes the lines of the incidence structure, and the notion of collineation persists.

As mentioned by Blaschke and Klein, [[Michel Chasles]] preferred the term ''homography'' to ''collineation''. A distinction between the terms arose when the distinction was clarified between the [[real projective plane]] and the [[complex projective line]]. Since there are no non-trivial field automorphisms of the [[real number]] field, all the collineations are homographies in the real projective plane.,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Casse|2006|loc=p. 64, Corollary 4.29}}&lt;/ref&gt; however due to the field automorphism [[complex conjugation]], not all collineations of the complex projective line are homographies. In applications such as [[computer vision]] where the underlying field is the real number field, ''homography'' and ''collineation'' can be used interchangeably.

==Anti-homography==
The operation of taking the [[complex conjugate]] in the [[complex plane]] amounts to a [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] in the [[real line]].  With the notation ''z''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; for the conjugate of ''z'', an '''anti-homography''' is given by
:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = \frac {a z^* + b}{c z^* + d}.&lt;/math&gt;
Thus an anti-homography is the composition of conjugation with an [[homography]], and so is an example of a collineation which is not an homography. For example, geometrically, the mapping &lt;math&gt;f(z) = 1/z^*&lt;/math&gt; amounts to [[inversive geometry#Circle inversion|circle inversion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morley|Morley|1933|loc=p. 38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transformations of [[inversive geometry]] of the plane are frequently described as the collection of all homographies and anti-homographies of the complex plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blair|2000}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sxHKpaAuclgC&amp;pg=PA43 p.&amp;nbsp;43]; {{harvnb|Schwerdtfeger|2012}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4XE2_AqxYVkC&amp;pg=PA42 p.&amp;nbsp;42].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9711">In [[mathematics]], the term '''''combinatorial proof''''' is often used to mean either of two types of [[mathematical proof]]:
* A proof by [[double counting (proof technique)|double counting]].  A [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] [[identity (mathematics)|identity]] is proven by counting the number of elements of some carefully chosen set in two different ways to obtain the different expressions in the identity. Since those expressions count the same objects, they must be equal to each other and thus the identity is established.
* A [[bijective proof]].  Two sets are shown to have the same number of members by exhibiting a [[bijection]], i.e. a one-to-one correspondence, between them.

The term "combinatorial proof" may also be used more broadly to refer to any kind of [[elementary proof]] in combinatorics. However, as {{harvtxt|Glass|2003}} writes in his review of {{harvtxt|Benjamin|Quinn|2003}} (a book about combinatorial proofs), these two simple techniques are enough to prove many theorems in combinatorics and [[number theory]].

==Example==
An archetypal double counting proof is for the well known formula for the number &lt;math&gt;\tbinom nk&lt;/math&gt; of ''k''-[[combination]]s (i.e., subsets of size ''k'') of an ''n''-element set:
:&lt;math&gt;\binom nk=\frac{n(n-1)\cdots(n-k+1)}{k(k-1)\cdots1}.&lt;/math&gt;
Here a direct bijective proof is not possible: because the right-hand side of the identity is a fraction, there is no set ''obviously'' counted by it (it even takes some thought to see that the denominator always evenly divides the numerator). However its numerator counts the [[Cartesian product]] of ''k'' finite sets of sizes ''n'', {{nowrap|''n'' − 1}}, ..., {{nowrap|''n'' − ''k'' + 1}}, while its denominator counts the [[permutations]] of a ''k''-element set (the set most obviously counted by the denominator would be another Cartesian product ''k'' finite sets; if desired one could map permutations to that set by an explicit bijection). Now take ''S'' to be the set of sequences of ''k'' elements selected from our ''n''-element set without repetition. On one hand, there is an easy bijection of ''S'' with the Cartesian product corresponding to the numerator &lt;math&gt;n(n-1)\cdots(n-k+1)&lt;/math&gt;, and on the other hand there is a bijection from the set ''C'' of pairs of a ''k''-combination and a permutation ''σ'' of ''k'' to ''S'', by taking the elements of ''C'' in increasing order, and then permuting this sequence by&amp;nbsp;''σ'' to obtain an element of&amp;nbsp;''S''. The two ways of counting give the equation
:&lt;math&gt;n(n-1)\cdots(n-k+1)=\binom nk k!,&lt;/math&gt;
and after division by ''k''! this leads to the stated formula for &lt;math&gt;\tbinom nk&lt;/math&gt;. In general, if the counting formula involves a division, a similar double counting argument (if it exists) gives the most straightforward combinatorial proof of the identity, but double counting arguments are not limited to situations where the formula is of this form.

== The benefit of a combinatorial proof ==  &lt;!-- Binomial coefficient links here --&gt;

{{harvtxt|Stanley|1997}} gives an example of a [[combinatorial enumeration]] problem (counting the number of sequences of ''k'' subsets ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, that can be formed from a set of ''n'' items such that the subsets have an empty common intersection) with two different proofs for its solution. The first proof, which is not combinatorial, uses [[mathematical induction]] and [[generating function]]s to find that the number of sequences of this type is (2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. The second proof is based on the observation that there are 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1 [[proper subset]]s of the set {1, 2, ..., ''k''}, and (2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; functions from the set {1, 2, ..., ''n''} to the family of proper subsets of {1, 2, ..., ''k''}. The sequences to be counted can be placed in one-to-one correspondence with these functions, where the function formed from a given sequence of subsets maps each element ''i'' to the set {''j''&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''i''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''S''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}.

Stanley writes, “Not only is the above combinatorial proof much shorter than our previous proof, but also it makes the reason for the simple answer completely transparent. It is often the case, as occurred here, that the first proof to come to mind turns out to be laborious and inelegant, but that the final answer suggests a simple combinatorial proof.” Due both to their frequent greater elegance than non-combinatorial proofs and the greater insight they provide into the structures they describe, Stanley formulates a general principle that combinatorial proofs are to be preferred over other proofs, and lists as exercises many problems of finding combinatorial proofs for mathematical facts known to be true through other means.

==The difference between bijective and double counting proofs==
Stanley does not clearly distinguish between bijective and double counting proofs, and gives examples of both kinds, but the difference between the two types of combinatorial proof can be seen in an example provided by {{harvtxt|Aigner|Ziegler|1998}}, of proofs for [[Cayley's formula]] stating that there are ''n''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt; different [[tree (graph theory)|trees]] that can be formed from a given set of ''n'' nodes. Aigner and Ziegler list four proofs of this theorem, the first of which is bijective and the last of which is a double counting argument. They also mention but do not describe the details of a fifth bijective proof.

The most natural way to find a bijective proof of this formula would be to find a bijection between ''n''-node trees and some collection of objects that has ''n''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt; members, such as the sequences of ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2 values each in the range from 1 to ''n''. Such a bijection can be obtained using the [[Prüfer sequence]] of each tree. Any tree can be uniquely encoded into a Prüfer sequence, and any Prüfer sequence can be uniquely decoded into a tree; these two results together provide a bijective proof of Cayley's formula.

An alternative bijective proof, given by Aigner and Ziegler and credited by them to [[André Joyal]], involves a bijection between, on the one hand, ''n''-node trees with two designated nodes (that may be the same as each other), and on the other hand, ''n''-node [[directed graph|directed]] [[pseudoforest]]s. If there are ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''n''-node trees, then there are ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' trees with two designated nodes. And a pseudoforest may be determined by specifying, for each of its nodes, the endpoint of the edge extending outwards from that node; there are ''n'' possible choices for the endpoint of a single edge (allowing self-loops) and therefore ''n&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' possible pseudoforests. By finding a bijection between trees with two labeled nodes and pseudoforests, Joyal's proof shows that ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Finally, the fourth proof of Cayley's formula presented by Aigner and Ziegler is a [[Double counting (proof technique)#Counting trees|double counting proof due to Jim Pitman]]. In this proof, Pitman considers the sequences of directed edges that may be added to an ''n''-node [[empty graph]] to form from it a single rooted tree, and counts the number of such sequences in two different ways. By showing how to derive a sequence of this type by choosing a tree, a root for the tree, and an ordering for the edges in the tree, he shows that there are ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;n''! possible sequences of this type. And by counting the number of ways in which a partial sequence can be extended by a single edge, he shows that there are ''n''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;''n''! possible sequences. Equating these two different formulas for the size of the same set of edge sequences and cancelling the common factor of ''n''! leads to Cayley's formula.

==Related concepts==
*The principles of double counting and bijection used in combinatorial proofs can be seen as examples of a larger family of [[combinatorial principles]], which include also other ideas such as the [[pigeonhole principle]].
*Proving an identity combinatorially can be viewed as adding more structure to the identity by replacing numbers by sets; similarly, [[categorification]] is the replacement of sets by categories.

In [[mathematics]], the '''converse relation''', or '''transpose''', of a [[binary relation]] is the relation that occurs when the order of the elements is switched in the relation. For example, the converse of the relation 'child&amp;nbsp;of' is the relation 'parent&amp;nbsp;of'. In formal terms, if {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|Y}} are sets and {{math|''L'' ⊆ ''X'' × ''Y''}} is a relation from {{math|''X''}} to {{math|''Y''}}, then {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;{{font|T}}&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the relation defined so that {{math|''y L''&lt;sup&gt;{{font|T}}&lt;/sup&gt; ''x''}} if and only if {{math|''x L y''}}. In [[set-builder notation]], {{math|1=''L''&lt;sup&gt;{{font|T}}&lt;/sup&gt; = {(''y, x'') ∈ ''Y'' × ''X'' {{!}} (''x, y'') ∈ ''L'' }}}.

The notation is analogous with that for an [[inverse function]]. Although many functions do not have an inverse, every relation does have a unique converse. The [[unary operation]] that maps a relation to the converse relation is an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]], so it induces the structure of a [[semigroup with involution]] on the binary relations on a set, or, more generally, induces a [[dagger category]] on the [[category of relations]] as [[#Properties|detailed below]]. As a [[unary operation]], taking the converse (sometimes called '''conversion''' or '''transposition''') commutes with the order-related operations of the calculus of relations, that is it commutes with union, intersection, and complement.

The converse relation is also called the or '''transpose relation'''&amp;mdash; the latter in view of its similarity with the [[transpose]] of a matrix.&lt;ref name=R&amp;G&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gunther Schmidt|author2=Thomas Ströhlein|title=Relations and Graphs: Discrete Mathematics for Computer Scientists|year=1993|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-642-77970-1|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been called the '''opposite''' or '''dual''' of the original relation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Celestina Cotti Ferrero|author2=Giovanni Ferrero|title=Nearrings: Some Developments Linked to Semigroups and Groups|year=2002|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|isbn=978-1-4613-0267-4|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or the '''inverse''' of the original relation&lt;ref name=S&amp;S&gt;{{cite book|author1=Shlomo Sternberg|author2=Lynn Loomis|title=Advanced Calculus|year=2014|publisher=World Scientific Publishing Company|isbn=978-9814583930|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Other notations for the converse relation include {{math|''L''{{sup|{{font|C}}}}, ''L''&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''L''&lt;sup&gt;~&lt;/sup&gt;}}, &lt;math&gt;\breve{L}&lt;/math&gt;, {{math|''L''°}}, or {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;∨&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

==Examples==
For the usual (maybe strict or partial) [[order relation]]s, the converse is the naively expected "opposite" order, for examples, &lt;math&gt;{\le^\mathsf{T}} = {\ge},\quad {&lt;^\mathsf{T}} = {&gt;}.&lt;/math&gt;

A relation may be represented by a [[logical matrix]] such as
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
   1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
   0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
 \end{pmatrix}.
 &lt;/math&gt;

Then the converse relation is represented by its [[transpose matrix]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
   1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
   1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
   1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
   1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
 \end{pmatrix}.
 &lt;/math&gt;

The converse of [[kinship]] relations are named: "''A'' is a child of ''B''" has converse "''B'' is a parent of ''A''".  "''A'' is a [[nephew and niece|nephew or niece]] of ''B''" has converse "''B'' is an [[uncle]] or [[aunt]] of ''A''". The relation "''A'' is a [[sibling]] of ''B''" is its own converse, since it is a symmetric relation.

In set theory, one presumes a [[universe (mathematics)|universe]] ''U'' of discourse, and a fundamental relation of [[set membership]] ''x'' ∈ ''A'' when ''A'' is a subset of ''U''. The [[power set]] of all subsets of ''U'' is the domain of the converse &lt;math&gt;\ni \ = \ \in^T.&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==
In the [[monoid]] of binary [[endorelation]]s on a set (with the [[binary operation]] on relations being the [[composition of relations]]), the converse relation does not satisfy the definition of an inverse from group theory, i.e. if ''L'' is an arbitrary relation on ''X'', then &lt;math&gt;L \circ L^\mathsf{T}&lt;/math&gt; does ''not'' equal the [[Identity function|identity relation]] on ''X'' in general. The converse relation does satisfy the (weaker) axioms of a [[semigroup with involution]]: &lt;math&gt;\left(L^\mathsf{T}\right)^\mathsf{T} = L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left(L \circ R\right)^\mathsf{T} = R^\mathsf{T} \circ L^\mathsf{T}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Lambek2001"/&gt;

Since one may generally consider relations between different sets (which form a [[Category (mathematics)|category]] rather than a monoid, namely the [[category of relations]] '''Rel'''), in this context the converse relation conforms to the axioms of a [[dagger category]] (aka category with involution).&lt;ref name="Lambek2001"/&gt; A relation equal to its converse is a [[symmetric relation]]; in the language of dagger categories, it is [[self-adjoint]].

Furthermore, the semigroup of endorelations on a set is also a partially ordered structure (with inclusion of relations as sets), and actually an involutive [[quantale]]. Similarly, the category of [[heterogeneous relation]]s, '''Rel''' is also an ordered category.&lt;ref name="Lambek2001"&gt;{{cite book|editors=Ewa Orlowska, Andrzej Szalas|title=Relational Methods for Computer Science Applications|year=2001|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-7908-1365-4|pages=135–146|chapter=Relations Old and New|author=[[Joachim Lambek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[algebraic logic#Calculus of relations|calculus of relations]], ''conversion'' (the unary operation of taking the converse relation) commutes with other binary operations of union and intersection. Conversion also commutes with unary operation of [[Binary relation#Complement|complementation]] as well as with taking [[supremum|suprema]] and infima. Conversion is also compatible with the ordering of relations by inclusion.&lt;ref name=R&amp;G/&gt;

If a relation is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]], [[irreflexive relation|irreflexive]], [[symmetric relation|symmetric]], [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]], [[asymmetric relation|asymmetric]], [[transitive relation|transitive]], [[total relation|total]], [[Binary relation#Relations over a set|trichotomous]], a [[partial order]], [[total order]], [[strict weak order]], [[Strict weak order#Total preorders|total preorder]] (weak order),  or an [[equivalence relation]], its converse is too.

==Inverses==
If ''I'' represents the identity relation, then a relation ''R'' may have an '''inverse''' as follows:
:A relation ''R'' is called right-invertible if there exists a relation ''X'' with &lt;math&gt;R \circ X = I&lt;/math&gt;, and left-invertible if there exists a ''Y'' with &lt;math&gt;Y \circ R = I&lt;/math&gt;. Then ''X'' and ''Y'' are called the right and left inverse of ''R'', respectively. Right- and left-invertible relations are called '''invertible'''. For invertible homogeneous relations all right and left inverses coincide; the notion '''inverse''' ''R''&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; is used. Then ''R''&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''R''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; holds.&lt;ref name=R&amp;G/&gt;{{rp|79}}

===Converse relation of a function===
A [[function (mathematics)|function]] is [[inverse function|invertible]] if and only if its converse relation is a function, in which case the converse relation is the inverse function.

The converse relation of a function &lt;math&gt;f : X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; is the relation &lt;math&gt;f^{-1} : Y \to X&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{graph}\, f^{-1} = \left\{(y, x) \mid y = f(x)\right\}&lt;/math&gt;.

This is not necessarily a function: One necessary condition is that ''f'' be [[injective]], since else  &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is [[multi-valued]]. This condition is sufficient for &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; being a [[partial function]], and it is clear that &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;  then is a (total) function [[if and only if]] ''f'' is [[surjective]]. In that case, i.e. if ''f'' is [[bijective]], &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; may be called the '''[[inverse function]]''' of ''f''.

For example, the function &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 2x + 2&lt;/math&gt; has the inverse function &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x}{2} - 1&lt;/math&gt;.

However, the function &lt;math&gt;g(x) = x^2&lt;/math&gt; has the inverse relation &lt;math&gt;g^{-1}(x) = \pm x^\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, which is not a function, being multi-valued.

In algebra, a '''crystal base''' or '''canonical base''' is a base of a representation, such that generators of a [[quantum group]] or [[semisimple Lie algebra]] have a particularly simple action on it. Crystal bases were introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=Kashiwara|authorlink=Masaki Kashiwara|year=1990}} and {{harvs|txt|last=Lusztig|authorlink=George Lusztig|year=1990}} (under the name of canonical bases).

==Definition==

As a consequence of the defining relations for the quantum group &lt;math&gt;U_q(G)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;U_q(G)&lt;/math&gt; can be regarded as a Hopf algebra over &lt;math&gt;\Q(q)&lt;/math&gt;, the field of all rational functions of an indeterminate ''q'' over &lt;math&gt;\Q&lt;/math&gt;.

For simple root &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; and non-negative integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, define 

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
e_i^{(0)} = f_i^{(0)} &amp;= 1 \\
e_i^{(n)} &amp;= \frac{e_i^n}{[n]_{q_i}!} \\[6pt]
f_i^{(n)} &amp;= \frac{f_i^n}{[n]_{q_i}!}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt; 

In an integrable module &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, and for weight &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, a vector &lt;math&gt;u \in M_{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. a vector &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; with weight &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;) can be uniquely decomposed into the sums

:&lt;math&gt;u = \sum_{n=0}^\infty f_i^{(n)} u_n = \sum_{n=0}^\infty e_i^{(n)} v_n,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u_n \in \ker(e_i) \cap M_{\lambda + n \alpha_i}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v_n \in \ker(f_i) \cap M_{\lambda - n \alpha_i}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;u_n \ne 0&lt;/math&gt; only if &lt;math&gt;n + \frac{2 (\lambda,\alpha_i)}{(\alpha_i,\alpha_i)} \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;v_n \ne 0&lt;/math&gt; only if &lt;math&gt;n - \frac{2 (\lambda,\alpha_i)}{(\alpha_i,\alpha_i)} \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;.  

Linear mappings &lt;math&gt;\tilde{e}_i, \tilde{f}_i : M \to M&lt;/math&gt; can be defined on &lt;math&gt;M_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; by

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{e}_i u = \sum_{n=1}^\infty f_i^{(n-1)} u_n = \sum_{n=0}^\infty e_i^{(n+1)} v_n,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}_i u = \sum_{n=0}^\infty f_i^{(n+1)} u_n = \sum_{n=1}^\infty e_i^{(n-1)} v_n.&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be the integral domain of all rational functions in &lt;math&gt;\Q(q)&lt;/math&gt; which are regular at &lt;math&gt;q = 0&lt;/math&gt; (''i.e.'' a rational function &lt;math&gt;f(q)&lt;/math&gt; is an element of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there exist polynomials &lt;math&gt;g(q)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h(q)&lt;/math&gt; in the polynomial ring &lt;math&gt;\Q[q]&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;h(0) \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f(q) = g(q)/h(q)&lt;/math&gt;).  A '''crystal base''' for &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is an ordered pair &lt;math&gt;(L,B)&lt;/math&gt;, such that

*&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is a free &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;-submodule of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;M = \Q(q) \otimes_A L;&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;\Q&lt;/math&gt;-basis of the vector space &lt;math&gt;L/qL&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\Q,&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;L = \oplus_\lambda L_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B = \sqcup_\lambda B_\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;L_\lambda = L \cap M_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_\lambda = B \cap (L_\lambda/qL_\lambda),&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\tilde{e}_i L \subset L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}_i L \subset L \text{ for all } i ,&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\tilde{e}_i B \subset B \cup \{0\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}_i B \subset B \cup \{0\}\text{ for all } i, &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\text{for all }b \in B\text{ and }b' \in B,\text{ and for all }i,\quad\tilde{e}_i b = b'\text{ if and only if }\tilde{f}_i b' = b.&lt;/math&gt;

To put this into a more informal setting, the actions of &lt;math&gt;e_i f_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_i e_i&lt;/math&gt; are generally singular at &lt;math&gt;q = 0&lt;/math&gt; on an integrable module &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.  The linear mappings &lt;math&gt;\tilde{e}_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}_i&lt;/math&gt; on the module are introduced so that the actions of &lt;math&gt;\tilde{e}_i \tilde{f}_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}_i \tilde{e}_i&lt;/math&gt; are regular at &lt;math&gt;q = 0&lt;/math&gt; on the module.  There exists a &lt;math&gt;\Q(q)&lt;/math&gt;-basis of weight vectors &lt;math&gt;\tilde{B}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, with respect to which the actions of &lt;math&gt;\tilde{e}_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}_i&lt;/math&gt; are regular at &lt;math&gt;q = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all ''i''.  The module is then restricted to the free &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;-module generated by the basis, and the basis vectors, the &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;-submodule and the actions of &lt;math&gt;\tilde{e}_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}_i&lt;/math&gt; are evaluated at &lt;math&gt;q = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  Furthermore, the basis can be chosen such that at &lt;math&gt;q = 0&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\tilde{e}_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}_i&lt;/math&gt; are represented by mutual transposes, and map basis vectors to basis vectors or 0.

A crystal base can be represented by a [[graph (discrete mathematics)|directed graph]] with labelled edges.  Each vertex of the graph represents an element of the &lt;math&gt;\Bbb Q&lt;/math&gt;-basis &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;L/qL&lt;/math&gt;, and a directed edge, labelled by ''i'', and directed from vertex &lt;math&gt;v_1&lt;/math&gt; to vertex &lt;math&gt;v_2&lt;/math&gt;, represents that &lt;math&gt;b_2 = \tilde{f}_i b_1&lt;/math&gt; (and, equivalently, that &lt;math&gt;b_1 = \tilde{e}_i b_2&lt;/math&gt;), where &lt;math&gt;b_1&lt;/math&gt; is the basis element represented by &lt;math&gt;v_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;b_2&lt;/math&gt; is the basis element represented by &lt;math&gt;v_2&lt;/math&gt;.  The graph completely determines the actions of &lt;math&gt;\tilde{e}_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}_i&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;q = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  If an integrable module has a crystal base, then the module is irreducible if and only if the graph representing the crystal base is connected (a graph is called "connected" if the set of vertices cannot be partitioned into the union of nontrivial disjoint subsets &lt;math&gt;V_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_2&lt;/math&gt; such that there are no edges joining any vertex in &lt;math&gt;V_1&lt;/math&gt; to any vertex in &lt;math&gt;V_2&lt;/math&gt;).

For any integrable module with a crystal base, the weight spectrum for the crystal base is the same as the weight spectrum for the module, and therefore the weight spectrum for the crystal base is the same as the weight spectrum for the corresponding module of the appropriate Kac–Moody algebra.  The multiplicities of the weights in the crystal base are also the same as their multiplicities in the corresponding module of the appropriate Kac–Moody algebra.

It is a theorem of Kashiwara that every integrable highest weight module has a crystal base.  Similarly, every integrable lowest weight module has a crystal base.

===Tensor products of crystal bases===

Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be an integrable module with crystal base &lt;math&gt;(L,B)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M'&lt;/math&gt; be an integrable module with crystal base &lt;math&gt;(L',B')&lt;/math&gt;.  For crystal bases, the coproduct &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;, given by 

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\Delta(k_{\lambda}) &amp;= k_\lambda \otimes k_\lambda \\
\Delta(e_i) &amp;= e_i \otimes k_i^{-1} + 1 \otimes e_i \\ 
\Delta(f_i) &amp;= f_i \otimes 1 + k_i \otimes f_i
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

is adopted.  The integrable module &lt;math&gt;M \otimes_{\Q(q)} M'&lt;/math&gt; has crystal base &lt;math&gt;(L \otimes_A L',B \otimes B')&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;B \otimes B' = \left \{ b \otimes_{\Q} b' : b \in B,\ b' \in B' \right \}&lt;/math&gt;.  For a basis vector &lt;math&gt;b \in B&lt;/math&gt;, define 

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_i(b) = \max \left \{ n \ge 0 : \tilde{e}_i^n b \ne 0 \right \}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_i(b) = \max \left \{ n \ge 0 : \tilde{f}_i^n b \ne 0 \right \}&lt;/math&gt;  

The actions of &lt;math&gt;\tilde{e}_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}_i&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;b \otimes b'&lt;/math&gt; are given by

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\tilde{e}_i (b \otimes b') &amp;= \begin{cases} \tilde{e}_i b \otimes b' &amp; \varphi_i(b) \ge \varepsilon_i(b') \\ b \otimes \tilde{e}_i b' &amp; \varphi_i(b) &lt; \varepsilon_i(b') \end{cases} \\
\tilde{f}_i (b \otimes b') &amp;= \begin{cases} \tilde{f}_i b \otimes b' &amp; \varphi_i(b) &gt; \varepsilon_i(b') \\ b \otimes \tilde{f}_i b' &amp; \varphi_i(b) \le \varepsilon_i(b') \end{cases} 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The decomposition of the product two integrable highest weight modules into irreducible submodules is determined by the decomposition of the graph of the crystal base into its connected components (i.e. the highest weights of the submodules are determined, and the multiplicity of each highest weight is determined).

[[File:De_gua_theorem_1.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|tetrahedron with a right-angle corner in O]]
'''De Gua's theorem''' is a three-dimensional analog of the [[Pythagorean theorem]] and named after [[Jean Paul de Gua de Malves]].

If a [[tetrahedron]] has a right-angle corner (like the corner of a [[cube (geometry)|cube]]), then the square of the area of the face opposite the right-angle corner is the sum of the squares of the areas of the other three faces.

:&lt;math&gt; A_{ABC}^2 = A_{\color {blue} ABO}^2+A_{\color {green} ACO}^2+A_{\color {red} BCO}^2 &lt;/math&gt;

==Generalizations==

The [[Pythagorean theorem]] and de Gua's theorem are special cases (''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3) of a [[simplex#Simplexes with an "orthogonal corner"|general theorem]] about [[simplex|''n''-simplices]] with a [[right angle|right-angle]] corner.  This, in turn, is a special case of [[Pythagorean theorem#Sets of m-dimensional objects in n-dimensional space|a yet more general theorem]] by Donald R. Conant and William A. Beyer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2319528 |title=Generalized Pythagorean Theorem |author1=Donald R Conant  |author2=William A Beyer  |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=The American Mathematical Monthly |volume=81 |date=Mar 1974 |pages=262–265 |jstor=2319528 |issue=3 |publisher=Mathematical Association of America |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be stated as follows.

Let ''U'' be a [[Borel set|measurable]] subset of a ''k''-dimensional [[Affine space#Affine subspaces|affine subspace]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; (so &lt;math&gt;k \le n&lt;/math&gt;).  For any subset &lt;math&gt;I \subseteq \{ 1, \ldots, n \}&lt;/math&gt; with exactly ''k'' elements, let &lt;math&gt;U_I&lt;/math&gt; be the [[Projection (linear algebra)#Orthogonal projections|orthogonal projection]] of ''U'' onto the [[linear span]] of &lt;math&gt;e_{i_1}, \ldots, e_{i_k}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;I = \{i_1, \ldots, i_k\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e_1, \ldots, e_n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[standard basis]] for &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;.  Then

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{vol}_k^2(U) = \sum_I \mbox{vol}_k^2(U_I),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mbox{vol}_k(U)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hausdorff measure|''k''-dimensional volume]] of ''U'' and the sum is over all subsets &lt;math&gt;I \subseteq \{ 1, \ldots, n \}&lt;/math&gt; with exactly ''k'' elements.

De Gua's theorem and its generalisation (above) to ''n''-simplices with right-angle corners correspond to the special case where ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;minus;1 and ''U'' is an (''n''&amp;minus;1)-simplex in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; with vertices on the [[Cartesian coordinate system|co-ordinate axes]].  For example, suppose ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3, ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 and ''U'' is the [[triangle]] &lt;math&gt;\triangle ABC&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; with vertices ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' lying on the &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;-, &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt;- and &lt;math&gt;x_3&lt;/math&gt;-axes, respectively.  The subsets &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\{ 1, 2, 3 \}&lt;/math&gt; with exactly 2 elements are &lt;math&gt;\{ 2,3 \}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{ 1,3 \}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{ 1,2 \}&lt;/math&gt;.  By definition, &lt;math&gt;U_{\{ 2,3 \}}&lt;/math&gt; is the orthogonal projection of &lt;math&gt;U = \triangle ABC&lt;/math&gt; onto the &lt;math&gt;x_2 x_3&lt;/math&gt;-plane, so &lt;math&gt;U_{\{ 2,3 \}}&lt;/math&gt; is the triangle &lt;math&gt;\triangle OBC&lt;/math&gt; with vertices ''O'', ''B'' and ''C'', where ''O'' is the [[Origin (mathematics)#Cartesian coordinates|origin]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;.  Similarly, &lt;math&gt;U_{\{ 1,3 \}} = \triangle AOC&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U_{\{ 1,2 \}} = \triangle ABO&lt;/math&gt;, so the Conant–Beyer theorem says

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{vol}_2^2(\triangle ABC) = \mbox{vol}_2^2(\triangle OBC) + 
\mbox{vol}_2^2(\triangle AOC) + \mbox{vol}_2^2(\triangle ABO),&lt;/math&gt;

which is de Gua's theorem.

==History==

Jean Paul de Gua de Malves (1713&amp;ndash;85) published the theorem in 1783, but around the same time a slightly more general version was published by another French mathematician, [[Charles de Tinseau d'Amondans]] (1746&amp;ndash;1818), as well. However the theorem had also  been known much earlier to [[Johann Faulhaber]] (1580&amp;ndash;1635) and [[René Descartes]] (1596&amp;ndash;1650).&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|title=de Gua's theorem|urlname=deGuasTheorem}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard Whitley Eves: ''Great Moments in Mathematics (before 1650)''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3825">'''Drafting film''' is a sturdier and more dimensionally stable substitute for [[Vellum#Paper vellum|drafting paper]] sometimes used for [[technical drawings]], especially [[architectural drawings]], and for [[Artwork (graphic arts)|art layout drawings]], replacing [[drafting linen]] for these purposes. Nowadays it is almost invariably made of transparent [[BoPET|biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate]], which should last several centuries under normal storage conditions, with one or two translucent matte surfaces provided by a coating.  However, some older drafting films are [[cellulose acetate]], which degrades in only a few decades due to the [[vinegar syndrome]].  Uncoated films are preferred for [[Preservation_(library_and_archival_science)|archival]], because there is then no possibility that the coating material could deteriorate over time or react with other materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v15/bp15-12.html Transparent drafting films: profiles for preservation, Susan Page, Presented at the Book and Paper specialty group poster session, AIC 24th Annual Meeting, June 10-16, 1996, Norfolk Virginia.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Uncoated films require the use of an etching ink that penetrates the surface of the film.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YiY9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=drafting+film&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HxSGU9fXObSmsAS2kICYDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=drafting&amp;f=false Archaeological Illustration, 1989, Lesley Adkins, Roy A. Adkins, p.18]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because non-etching ink doesn't penetrate the surface of the film the way it penetrates paper, it is often possible to remove inked lines from drafting film when drawing on it by hand; an abrasive-free [[Eraser#Soft_vinyl_erasers|vinyl drafting eraser]] is the preferred tool for this,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QbdMOM89qv0C&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=drafting+film&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HxSGU9fXObSmsAS2kICYDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=drafting%20film&amp;f=false Architectural Drafting and Design, Fifth Edition, Alan Jefferis, David A. Madsen, 2005, p.31]&lt;/ref&gt; although a [[scalpel]] works too.&lt;ref&gt;Adkins and Adkins, p.18&lt;/ref&gt;  For the same reason, graphite on the surface tends to smear; there are polyester pencil drafting leads available as a substitute for [[graphite]] for drawing on drafting film.&lt;ref&gt;Jefferis &amp; Madsen, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;  Different matte coatings (generally consisting of amorphous silica particles dispersed in a resin) are better suited for graphite or for polyester leads.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qv_Nx3HavOkC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=drafting+film&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HxSGU9fXObSmsAS2kICYDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=drafting%20film&amp;f=false Handbook of Imaging Materials, Second Edition, CRC Press, Arthur S. Diamond &amp; David S. Weiss, 2002, p. 122]&lt;/ref&gt;

Manual drawing on drafting film requires special care with cleanliness, because [[Sebum|oil]] from the illustrator's hands can form skid patches on the film's nonporous surface, where ink and pencil will not adhere to the matte surface, while drafting paper will absorb the oil.&lt;ref&gt;Adkins &amp; Adkins, p.44&lt;/ref&gt;

Dimensional stability is important for scale drawings that don't have explicit dimensions, such as maps, because measurements may be taken directly from the drawing, so drawings that expand and shrink with temperature and humidity can introduce great imprecision into these measurements; some undimensioned drawing standards require the use of drafting film for such drawings.&lt;ref&gt;American Society of Mechanical Engineers, 2008, "Undimensioned Drawings", [[ASME Y14.31-2008]], ¶4, "Drawings that require strength, durability, and dimensional stability shall be prepared on Class 1 polyester film..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Evelyn Boyd was born in [[Washington, D.C.]]; her father worked odd jobs due to the [[Great Depression]] but separated from her mother when Boyd was young. Boyd and her older sister were raised by her mother and aunt, who both worked at the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]]. She was valedictorian at [[Dunbar High School (Washington, D.C.)|Dunbar High School]], which at that time was a [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] but academically competitive school for black students in Washington.&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bwim"/&gt;

With financial support from her aunt and, later, a small partial scholarship from Phi Delta Kappa, Boyd entered [[Smith College]] in the fall of 1941. She majored in mathematics and physics, but also took a keen interest in astronomy. She was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]] and to [[Sigma Xi]] and graduated summa cum laude in 1945. Encouraged by a graduate scholarship from the Smith Student Aid Society of Smith College, she applied to graduate programs in mathematics and was accepted by both [[Yale University]] and the [[University of Michigan]]; she chose Yale because of the financial aid they offered. There she studied [[functional analysis]] under the supervision of [[Einar Hille]], finishing her doctorate in 1949. Her dissertation was "On Laguerre Series in the Complex Domain".&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bwim"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=7500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Following graduate school, Boyd went to New York University Institute for Mathematics and performed research and teaching there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/granvill.htm|title=My Life as a Mathematician|last=Boyd Granville|first=Evelyn|date=Fall 1989|website=Biographies of Women Mathematicians|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After, in 1950, she took a teaching position at [[Fisk University]], a college for black students in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] (more prestigious postings being unavailable to black women). Two of her students there, [[Vivienne Malone-Mayes]] and [[Etta Zuber Falconer]], went on to earn doctorates in mathematics of their own. But by 1952 she left academia and returned to Washington with a position at the [[Harry Diamond Laboratories|Diamond Ordnance Fuze Laboratories]]. In January 1956, she moved to IBM as a [[computer programmer]]; when IBM received a NASA contract, she moved to Vanguard Computing Center in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="Collins"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Collins |first1=Sibrina Nichelle |title=Unsung: Dr. Evelyn Boyd Granville |url=https://undark.org/article/unsung-african-american-contributions-mathematics/ |website=UnDark |accessdate=7 November 2018|date= February 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Boyd moved from Washington to [[New York City]] in 1957. In 1960, after marrying Reverend G. Mansfield Collins, Boyd moved to [[Los Angeles]]. There she worked for the U.S. Space Technology Laboratories, which became the North American Aviation Space and Information Systems Division in 1962.&lt;ref name="Collins"/&gt;  She worked on various projects for the [[Apollo program]], including [[celestial mechanics]], trajectory computation, and "digital computer techniques".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ray Spangenburg|author2=Diane Moser|author3=Douglas Long|title=African Americans in Science, Math, and Invention|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XSOZ8kF5ynEC&amp;pg=https%3A%2F%2Fbooks.google.com%2Fbooks%3Fid%3DXSOZ8kF5ynEC|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0774-5|pages=97–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forced to move because of a restructuring at IBM,&lt;ref name="bwim"/&gt; she took a position at [[California State University, Los Angeles]] in 1967 as a full professor of mathematics.&lt;ref name="Collins"/&gt;
After retiring from CSULA in 1984 she taught at [[Texas College]] in [[Tyler, Texas]] for four years, and then in 1990 joined the faculty of the [[University of Texas at Tyler]] as the Sam A. Lindsey Professor of mathematics. There she developed elementary school math enrichment programs. Since 1967, Granville has remained a strong advocate for women's education in tech.&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bwim"/&gt;

===Experience of discrimination===
In 1951, Granville and two African American colleagues were denied entrance to a regional meeting of the [[Mathematical Association of America|Mathematical Association of America (MAA)]], because it was held at a whites-only hotel. The MAA and the [[American Mathematical Society|American Mathematical Society (AMS)]] subsequently changed their practices, under pressure from [[Lee Lorch]], to improve their inclusivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=10.4169/college.math.j.42.2.163|title=Media Highlights|journal=The College Mathematics Journal|volume=42|issue=2|date=March 2011|pages=163–172|
publisher=Mathematical Association of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Personal life ===
Boyd married Reverend Gamaliel Mansifeld Collins in 1960. In 1967, Boyd and Collins divorced. She married [[realtor]] Edward V. Granville in 1970.&lt;ref name="mactutor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bwim" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Collins"/&gt; The two moved to Tyler, Texas in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blackpast.org/aah/granville-evelyn-boyd-1924|title=Granville, Evelyn Boyd (1924-  ) {{!}} The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed|website=blackpast.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
In 1989, she was awarded an honorary doctorate by Smith College, the first one given by an American institution to an African-American woman mathematician.&lt;ref name="bwim"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.smith.edu/evelyn.php Dr. Evelyn Boyd Granville '45] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101073415/http://www.math.smith.edu/evelyn.php |date=2014-11-01 }}, Smith College, retrieved 2014-06-21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smith.edu/about_honorary.php Smith History: Honorary Degrees] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327230802/http://www.smith.edu/about_honorary.php |date=March 27, 2014 }}, Smith College, retrieved 2014-06-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

She was appointed to the Sam A. Lindsey Chair of the University of Texas at Tyler (1990-1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ray Spangenburg|author2=Diane Moser|author3=Douglas Long|title=African Americans in Science, Math, and Invention|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XSOZ8kF5ynEC&amp;pg=PA98|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0774-5|pages=98–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Granville was honoured by the [[National Academy of Engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nae.edu/AcademyHonorsThreeDuringAfricanAmericanHistoryMonth.aspx|title=Academy Honors Three During African American History Month|website=NAE Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] inducted her into its Portrait Collection of African-Americans in Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pioneer in science: Evelyn Granville |newspaper=New Pittsburgh Courier |date=March 27, 1999 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-480979971.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7024">In [[general topology]], a branch of mathematics, a collection ''A'' of subsets of a set ''X'' is said to have the '''finite intersection property''' (FIP) if the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]]  over any finite subcollection of ''A'' is nonempty. It has the '''strong finite intersection property''' (SFIP) if  the intersection  over any finite subcollection of ''A'' is infinite.

A '''centered system of sets''' is a collection of sets with the finite intersection property.

==Definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a set with &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A=\{A_i\}_{i\in I}&lt;/math&gt; a family of subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; indexed by an arbitrary set &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;. Then the collection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; has the finite intersection property (FIP), if any finite subcollection defined by &lt;math&gt;J\subseteq I&lt;/math&gt; has non-empty intersection, that is &lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{i\in J} A_i&lt;/math&gt; is a nonempty subset of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

==Discussion==
Clearly the empty set cannot belong to any collection with the finite intersection property.  The condition is trivially satisfied if the intersection over the entire collection is nonempty (in particular, if the collection itself is empty), and it is also trivially satisfied if the collection is nested, meaning that the collection is [[total order|totally ordered]] by inclusion (equivalently, for any finite subcollection, a particular element of the subcollection is contained in all the other elements of the subcollection), e.g. the [[nested sequence of intervals]] (0, 1/''n''). These are not the only possibilities however. For example, if ''X'' = (0, 1) and for each positive integer ''i'', ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the set of elements of ''X'' having a decimal expansion with digit 0 in the ''i'''th decimal place, then any finite intersection is nonempty (just take 0 in those finitely many places and 1 in the rest), but the intersection of all ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' for ''i'' ≥ 1 is empty, since no element of (0, 1) has all zero digits.

The finite intersection property is useful in formulating an alternative definition of [[compact space|compactness]]: a space is compact if and only if every collection of closed sets having the finite intersection property has nonempty intersection.&lt;ref name="munkres"&gt;{{cite book |first=James |last= Munkres |title= Topology |isbn= 978-81-203-2046-8 |publisher= Prentice-Hall of India |location= New Dehli |date=2004 |page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{planetmathref|id=4181|title=A space is compact iff any family of closed sets having fip has non-empty intersection}}&lt;/ref&gt; This formulation of compactness is used in some proofs of [[Tychonoff's theorem]] and the [[uncountable set|uncountability]] of the [[real number]]s (see next section)

==Applications==
'''Theorem.''' Let ''X'' be a non-empty [[Compact space|compact]] [[Hausdorff space]] that  satisfies the property that no one-point set is open. Then ''X'' is uncountable.

'''Proof.''' We will show that if ''U'' ⊆ ''X'' is nonempty and [[Open set|open]], and if ''x'' is a point of ''X'', then there is a [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] ''V'' ⊂ ''U'' whose [[closure (topology)|closure]] doesn’t contain ''x'' (''x'' may or may not be in ''U''). Choose ''y'' in ''U'' different from ''x'' (if ''x'' is in ''U'', then there must exist such a ''y'' for otherwise ''U'' would be an open one point set; if ''x'' isn’t in ''U'', this is possible since ''U'' is nonempty). Then by the Hausdorff condition, choose disjoint neighbourhoods ''W'' and ''K'' of ''x'' and ''y'' respectively. Then ''K''&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''U'' will be a neighbourhood of ''y'' contained in ''U'' whose closure doesn’t contain ''x'' as desired.

Now suppose ''f'' : '''N''' → ''X'' is a bijection, and let {''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''i'' ∈ '''N'''} denote the image of ''f''. Let ''X'' be the first open set and choose a neighbourhood ''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊂ ''X'' whose closure doesn’t contain ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Secondly, choose a neighbourhood ''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ⊂ ''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; whose closure doesn’t contain ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Continue this process whereby choosing a neighbourhood ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊂ ''U&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' whose closure doesn’t contain ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;. Then the collection {''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''i'' ∈ '''N'''} satisfies the finite intersection property and hence the intersection of their closures is nonempty (by the compactness of ''X''). Therefore, there is a point ''x'' in this intersection. No ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' can belong to this intersection because ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' doesn’t belong to the closure of ''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. This means that ''x'' is not equal to ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' for all ''i'' and ''f'' is not surjective; a contradiction. Therefore, ''X'' is uncountable.

All the conditions in the statement of the theorem are necessary:

1. We cannot eliminate the Hausdorff condition; a countable set with the [[indiscrete topology]] is compact, has more than one point, and satisfies the property that no one point sets are open, but is not uncountable.

2. We cannot eliminate the compactness condition as the set of all rational numbers shows.

3. We cannot eliminate the condition that one point sets cannot be open as a finite space as the [[discrete topology]] shows.

'''Corollary.''' Every closed interval [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] with ''a''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''b'' is uncountable. Therefore, '''R''' is uncountable.

'''Corollary.''' Every [[Perfect space|perfect]], [[Locally compact space|locally compact]] Hausdorff space is uncountable.

'''Proof.''' Let ''X'' be a perfect, compact, Hausdorff space, then the theorem immediately implies that ''X'' is uncountable. If ''X'' is a perfect, locally compact Hausdorff space which is not compact, then the [[one-point compactification]] of ''X'' is a perfect, compact Hausdorff space. Therefore, the one point compactification of ''X'' is uncountable. Since removing a point from an uncountable set still leaves an uncountable set, ''X'' is uncountable as well.

==Examples==
A [[filter (topology)|filter]] has the finite intersection property by definition.

== Theorems ==
Let ''X'' be nonempty, ''F'' ⊆ 2&lt;sup&gt;''X''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''F'' having the finite intersection property. Then there exists an ''F''′ [[ultrafilter]] (in 2&lt;sup&gt;''X''&lt;/sup&gt;) such that ''F'' ⊆ ''F''′.

See details and proof in {{harvtxt|Csirmaz|Hajnal|1994}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Csirmaz|first1=László|last2=Hajnal|first2=András|author2-link=András Hajnal|title=Matematikai logika|publisher=[[Eötvös Loránd University]]|location=Budapest|year=1994|url=http://www.renyi.hu/~csirmaz/|format=In Hungarian}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This result is known as [[ultrafilter lemma]].

==Variants==
A family of sets ''A'' has the '''strong finite intersection property''' (sfip), if every finite subfamily of ''A'' has infinite intersection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3708">The '''fixed-point lemma for normal functions''' is a basic result in [[axiomatic set theory]] stating that any [[normal function]] has arbitrarily large [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]s (Levy 1979: p.&amp;nbsp;117). It was first proved by [[Oswald Veblen]] in 1908.

== Background and formal statement ==
A [[normal function]] is a [[proper class|class]] function ''f'' from the class Ord of [[ordinal numbers]] to itself such that:
* ''f'' is '''strictly increasing''': ''f''(α) &lt; f(β) whenever α &lt; β.
* ''f'' is '''continuous''': for every limit ordinal λ (i.e. λ is neither zero nor a successor), ''f''(λ) = sup { f(α) : α &lt; λ }.
It can be shown that if ''f'' is normal then ''f'' commutes with [[supremum|suprema]]; for any nonempty set ''A'' of ordinals,
:''f''(sup ''A'') = sup {''f''(&amp;alpha;) : &amp;alpha; ∈ ''A'' }.
Indeed, if sup ''A'' is a successor ordinal then sup ''A'' is an element of ''A'' and the equality follows from the increasing property of ''f''. If sup ''A'' is a limit ordinal then the equality follows from the continuous property of ''f''.

A '''fixed point''' of a normal function is an ordinal β such that ''f''(β) = β.

The fixed point lemma states that the class of fixed points of any normal function is nonempty and in fact is unbounded: given any ordinal α, there exists an ordinal β such that β ≥ α and ''f''(β) = β.

The continuity of the normal function implies the class of fixed points is closed (the supremum of any subset of the class of fixed points is again a fixed point). Thus the fixed point lemma is equivalent to the statement that the fixed points of a normal function form a [[club set|closed and unbounded]] class.

== Proof ==
The first step of the proof is to verify that ''f''(γ) ≥ γ for all ordinals γ and that ''f'' commutes with suprema. Given these results, inductively define an increasing sequence &amp;lt;α&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt; (''n'' &amp;lt; ω) by setting α&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = α, and α&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f''(α&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) for ''n'' ∈ ω. Let β = sup {α&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''n'' ∈ ω}, so β ≥ α. Moreover, because ''f'' commutes with suprema,  
:''f''(β) = ''f''(sup {α&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''n'' &amp;lt; ω}) 
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; = sup {''f''(α&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) : ''n'' &amp;lt; ω} 
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; = sup {α&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; : ''n'' &amp;lt; ω} 
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; = β.
The last equality follows from the fact that the sequence &amp;lt;α&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt; increases.  &lt;math&gt; \square &lt;/math&gt;

As an aside, it can be demonstrated that the β found in this way is the smallest fixed point greater than or equal to α.

== Example application ==
The function ''f'' : Ord → Ord, ''f''(α) = ω&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; is normal (see [[initial ordinal]]). Thus, there exists an ordinal θ such that θ = ω&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;. In fact, the lemma shows that there is a closed, unbounded class of such θ.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2475">In single-variable [[differential calculus]], the '''fundamental increment lemma''' is an immediate consequence of the definition of the [[derivative]] ''f''{{'}}(''a'') of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' at a point ''a'':
:&lt;math&gt;f'(a) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}.&lt;/math&gt;
The lemma asserts that the existence of this derivative implies the existence of a function &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; such that 
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h \to 0} \varphi(h) = 0 \qquad \text{and} \qquad f(a+h) = f(a) + f'(a)h + \varphi(h)h&lt;/math&gt;
for sufficiently small but non-zero ''h''. For a proof, it suffices to define
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(h) = \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} - f'(a)&lt;/math&gt;
and verify this &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; meets the requirements.

== Differentiability in higher dimensions ==
In that the existence of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; uniquely characterises the number &lt;math&gt; f'(a)&lt;/math&gt;, the fundamental increment lemma can be said to characterise the [[differentiability]] of single-variable functions. For this reason, a generalisation of the lemma can be used in the definition of differentiability in [[multivariable calculus]]. In particular, suppose ''f'' maps some subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. Then ''f'' is said to be differentiable at '''a''' if there is a [[linear function]] 
:&lt;math&gt;M: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; 
and a function 
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi: D \to \mathbb{R}, \qquad D \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n \smallsetminus \{ \mathbf{0} \},&lt;/math&gt; 
such that 
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\mathbf{h} \to 0} \Phi(\mathbf{h}) = 0 \qquad \text{and} \qquad f(\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{h}) = f(\mathbf{a}) + M(\mathbf{h})  + \Phi(\mathbf{h}) \cdot \Vert\mathbf{h}\Vert&lt;/math&gt;
for non-zero '''h''' sufficiently close to '''0'''. In this case, ''M'' is the unique derivative (or [[Total_derivative#The_total_derivative_as_a_linear_map|total derivative]], to distinguish from the [[directional derivative|directional]] and [[partial derivative]]s) of ''f'' at '''a'''. Notably, ''M'' is given by the [[Jacobian matrix]] of ''f'' evaluated at '''a'''.

==Properties==
{{main|Generalizations of Pauli matrices}}
These matrices are [[traceless]], Hermitian (so they can generate [[unitary matrix]] group elements through exponentiation), and obey the extra trace orthonormality relation. These properties were chosen by Gell-Mann because they then naturally generalize the [[Pauli matrices]] for [[SU(2)]] to [[SU(3)]], which formed the basis for Gell-Mann's [[quark model]]. Gell-Mann's generalization further [[Generalizations_of_Pauli_matrices#Construction|extends to general SU(''n'')]]. For their connection to the [[Root_system |standard basis]] of Lie algebras, see  the [[Clebsch–Gordan_coefficients_for_SU(3)#Standard_basis|Weyl–Cartan  basis]].
===Trace orthonormality===

In mathematics, orthonormality typically implies a norm which has a value of unity (1).  Gell-Mann matrices, however, are normalized to a value of 2.  Thus, the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the pairwise product results in the ortho-normalization condition 

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{tr}(\lambda_i \lambda_j) = 2\delta_{ij},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]].

This is so the embedded Pauli matrices corresponding to the  three embedded subalgebras of ''SU''(2) are conventionally normalized. In this three-dimensional matrix representation,  the [[Cartan subalgebra]] is the set of linear combinations (with real coefficients) of the two matrices &lt;math&gt;\lambda_3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_8&lt;/math&gt;, which commute with each other.

There are three independent [[SU(2)]] subalgebras:

*&lt;math&gt;\{\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3\}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\{\lambda_4, \lambda_5, x\},&lt;/math&gt; and
*&lt;math&gt;\{\lambda_6, \lambda_7, y\},&lt;/math&gt;
where the {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are linear combinations of &lt;math&gt;\lambda_3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_8&lt;/math&gt;. The  SU(2) Casimirs of these subalgebras mutually commute. 

However, any unitary similarity transformation of these subalgebras will yield SU(2) subalgebras. There is an uncountable number of such transformations.

===Commutation relations===

The 8 infinitesimal generators of the [[Lie algebra]] are indexed by {{mvar|i}} satisfy the [[commutation relation]]s

: &lt;math&gt; \left[ \frac{\lambda_i}{2}, \frac{\lambda_j}{2} \right] = i \sum_k f^{ijk} \frac{\lambda_k}{2}. \,&lt;/math&gt;

The [[structure constant]]s &lt;math&gt;f^{ijk}&lt;/math&gt; are completely antisymmetric in the three indices, generalizing the antisymmetry of the [[Levi-Civita symbol]] &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{jkl}&lt;/math&gt; of {{math|''SU''(2)}}.  They have values

:&lt;math&gt;f^{123} = 1 \ , \quad f^{147} = f^{165} = f^{246} = f^{257} = f^{345} = f^{376} = \frac{1}{2} \ , \quad f^{458} = f^{678} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

In general, they evaluate to zero, unless they contain an odd count of indices from the set {2,5,7}, corresponding to the antisymmetric (imaginary) {{mvar|λ}}s.

===Fierz completeness relations===

Since the eight matrices and the identity are a complete trace-orthogonal set spanning all 3×3 matrices, it is straightforward to find two Fierz '''''completeness relations''''', (Li &amp; Cheng, 4.134), analogous to that [[Pauli_matrices#Completeness_relation|satisfied by the Pauli matrices]]. Namely, using the dot to sum over all adjoint indices {{mvar|i}} and utilizing Greek indices for the matrices' row/column indices, the following identities hold,
:&lt;math&gt;\delta^\alpha _\beta  \delta^\gamma  _\delta   = \frac{1}{3} \delta^\alpha_\delta  \delta^\gamma _\beta  +\frac{1}{2} \lambda^\alpha _\delta \cdot \lambda^\gamma _\beta &lt;/math&gt;
and 
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda^\alpha _\beta \cdot  \lambda^\gamma  _\delta   = \frac{16}{9} \delta^\alpha_\delta  \delta^\gamma _\beta  -\frac{1}{3} \lambda^\alpha _\delta \cdot \lambda^\gamma _\beta ~.&lt;/math&gt;
One may prefer the recast version, resulting from a linear combination of the above,
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda^\alpha _\beta \cdot  \lambda^\gamma  _\delta   = 2 \delta^\alpha_\delta  \delta^\gamma _\beta  -\frac{2}{3}  \delta^\alpha_\beta  \delta^\gamma _\delta    ~.&lt;/math&gt;

==Representation theory==
{{main|Clebsch–Gordan coefficients for SU(3)}}
A particular choice of matrices is called a [[group representation]], because any element of SU(3) can be written in the form &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{exp}(i \theta^j  g_j)&lt;/math&gt;, where the eight &lt;math&gt;\theta^j&lt;/math&gt; are real numbers and a sum over the index {{mvar|j}} is implied. Given one representation, an equivalent one may be obtained by an arbitrary unitary similarity transformation, since that leaves the commutator unchanged.

The matrices can be realized as a representation of the  [[Lie group#The Lie algebra associated with a Lie group|infinitesimal generator]]s of the [[special unitary group]] called [[Special unitary group#n_.3D_3|SU(3)]]. The [[Lie algebra]] of this group (a real Lie algebra in fact) has dimension eight and therefore it has some set with eight [[Linear independence|linearly independent]] generators, which can be written as &lt;math&gt;g_i&lt;/math&gt;, with ''i'' taking values from 1 to 8. 

===Casimir operators and invariants===

The squared sum of the Gell-Mann matrices gives the quadratic [[Casimir operator]], a group invariant, 
:&lt;math&gt; C = \sum_{i=1}^8 \lambda_i \lambda_i = \frac{16} 3. &lt;/math&gt;
There is another, independent, [[Clebsch–Gordan_coefficients_for_SU(3)#Casimir_operators|cubic Casimir operator]], as well.

==Application to [[quantum chromodynamics]]==
{{main|Colour charge}}
 
These matrices serve to study the internal (color) rotations of the [[gluon field]]s associated with the coloured quarks of [[quantum chromodynamics]] (cf. [[Gluon#Eight_gluon_colors|colors of the gluon]]). A gauge color rotation is a spacetime-dependent SU(3) group element 
&lt;math&gt;U=\exp (i  \theta^k ({\mathbf r},t)  \lambda_k/2)&lt;/math&gt;, where summation over the eight indices {{mvar|k}} is implied.

In [[physics]], '''general covariant transformations''' are [[symmetry|symmetries]] of [[gravitation| gravitation theory]] on a [[world manifold]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. They are [[gauge symmetry (mathematics)|gauge transformations]] whose parameter functions are [[vector field]]s on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. From the physical viewpoint, general covariant transformations are treated as particular ([[Holonomic function|holonomic]]) [[frame of reference|reference frame]] transformations in [[general relativity]]. In [[mathematics]], general covariant transformations are defined as particular [[automorphisms]] of so-called natural [[fiber bundle]]s. 

== Mathematical definition ==
Let &lt;math&gt;\pi:Y\to X&lt;/math&gt; be a [[fibered manifold]] with local fibered coordinates &lt;math&gt; (x^\lambda, y^i)\,&lt;/math&gt;. Every automorphism of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is projected onto a [[diffeomorphism]] of its base &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. However, the converse is not true. A diffeomorphism of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; need not give rise to an automorphism of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;.

In particular, an [[Lie group|infinitesimal generator]] of a one-parameter [[Lie group]] of automorphisms of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is a projectable [[vector field]]

:  &lt;math&gt; u=u^\lambda(x^\mu)\partial_\lambda + u^i(x^\mu,y^j)\partial_i &lt;/math&gt;

on &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. This vector field is projected onto a vector field &lt;math&gt;\tau=u^\lambda\partial_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, whose flow is a one-parameter group of diffeomorphisms of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Conversely, let &lt;math&gt;\tau=\tau^\lambda\partial_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; be a vector field on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. There is a problem of constructing its lift to a projectable vector field on &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; projected onto &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. Such a lift always exists, but it need not be canonical. Given a [[Connection (fibred manifold)|connection]] &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, every vector field &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; gives rise to the horizontal vector field

: &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\tau =\tau^\lambda(\partial_\lambda +\Gamma_\lambda^i\partial_i) &lt;/math&gt;

on &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. This horizontal lift &lt;math&gt;\tau\to\Gamma\tau&lt;/math&gt; yields a [[monomorphism]] of the &lt;math&gt;C^\infty(X) &lt;/math&gt;-module of vector fields on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to the &lt;math&gt;C^\infty(Y) &lt;/math&gt;-module of vector fields on &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, but this monomorphisms is not a Lie algebra morphism, unless &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is flat.

However, there is a category of above mentioned natural bundles &lt;math&gt;T\to X&lt;/math&gt; which admit the functorial lift &lt;math&gt;\widetilde\tau&lt;/math&gt; onto &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of any vector field &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\tau\to\widetilde\tau&lt;/math&gt; is a Lie algebra monomorphism

: &lt;math&gt; [\widetilde \tau,\widetilde \tau']=\widetilde {[\tau,\tau']}.&lt;/math&gt;

This functorial lift &lt;math&gt;\widetilde\tau&lt;/math&gt; is an infinitesimal general covariant transformation of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.

In a general setting, one considers a monomorphism &lt;math&gt;f\to\widetilde f&lt;/math&gt; of a group of diffeomorphisms of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to a group of bundle automorphisms of a natural bundle &lt;math&gt;T\to X&lt;/math&gt;. Automorphisms &lt;math&gt;\widetilde f&lt;/math&gt; are called the general covariant transformations of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. For instance, no vertical automorphism of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is a general covariant transformation.

Natural bundles are exemplified by [[tensor bundle]]s. For instance, the [[tangent bundle]] &lt;math&gt;TX&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a natural bundle. Every diffeomorphism &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; gives rise to the tangent automorphism &lt;math&gt;\widetilde f=Tf&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;TX&lt;/math&gt; which is a general covariant transformation of &lt;math&gt;TX&lt;/math&gt;. With respect to the holonomic coordinates &lt;math&gt;(x^\lambda, \dot x^\lambda) &lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;TX&lt;/math&gt;, this transformation reads

: &lt;math&gt;\dot x'^\mu=\frac{\partial x'^\mu}{\partial x^\nu}\dot x^\nu. &lt;/math&gt;

A [[frame bundle]] &lt;math&gt;FX&lt;/math&gt; of linear tangent frames in &lt;math&gt;TX&lt;/math&gt; also is a natural bundle. General covariant transformations constitute a subgroup of holonomic automorphisms of &lt;math&gt;FX&lt;/math&gt;. All bundles associated with a frame bundle are natural. However, there are natural bundles which are not associated with &lt;math&gt;FX&lt;/math&gt;.

{{broader|Earth's magnetic field}}
[[File:Geomagnetisme.svg|thumb|Illustration of the difference between geomagnetic poles (N&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) and geographical poles (N&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;)]]

The '''geomagnetic poles''' are [[antipodal point]]s where the axis of a best-fitting [[dipole]] [[intersection (Euclidean geometry)|intersects]] the surface of [[Earth]]. This theoretical dipole is equivalent to a powerful bar [[magnet]] at the [[inner core|center of Earth]] and comes closer than any other model to accounting for the [[magnetic field]] observed at Earth's surface. In contrast, the [[Earth's magnetic field|magnetic poles]] of the actual Earth are not [[antipodes|antipodal]]; that is, the line on which they lie does not pass through Earth's center.

Owing to motion of fluid in the Earth's [[outer core]], the actual magnetic poles are constantly moving. However, over thousands of years their direction averages to the Earth's rotation axis. On the order of once every half a million years, the [[geomagnetic reversal|poles reverse]] (north switches place with south).

==Definition==
As a [[Orders of approximation|first-order approximation]], the [[Earth's magnetic field]] can be modeled as a simple [[dipole]] (like a bar magnet), tilted about 9.6° with respect to the [[Earth's rotation]] axis (which defines the [[North Pole|Geographic North]] and [[South Pole|Geographic South Pole]]s) and centered at the Earth's center.&lt;ref name=NGDC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/faqgeom.shtml |title=Geomagnetism Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=National Geophysical Data Center |accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The North and South Geomagnetic Poles are the [[antipodal point]]s where the axis of this theoretical dipole intersects the Earth's surface, thus unlike the magnetic poles they always have an equal degree of latitude and [[Supplementary_angles|supplementary]] degrees of longitude respectively (2017: Lat. 80.5°N, 80.5°S; Long. 72.8°W, 107.2°E).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Magnetic North, Geomagnetic and Magnetic Poles |url=http://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/poles/polesexp.html |website=World Data Center for Geomagnetism, Kyoto |publisher=Kyoto University |accessdate=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the Earth's magnetic field were a perfect dipole then the [[field line]]s would be vertical to the surface at the Geomagnetic Poles, and they would coincide with the [[North Magnetic Pole|North]] and [[South Magnetic Pole|South]] magnetic poles. However, the approximation is imperfect, and so the Magnetic and Geomagnetic Poles lie some distance apart.&lt;ref name=Merrill1996ch2&gt;{{harvnb|Merrill|McElhinny|McFadden|1996|loc=Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Like the [[North Magnetic Pole]], the North Geomagnetic Pole attracts the north pole of a bar [[magnet]] and so is in a physical sense actually a magnetic ''south'' pole. It is the center of the 'open' magnetic field lines which connect to the [[interplanetary magnetic field]] and provide a direct route for the [[solar wind]] to reach the [[ionosphere]]. {{As of|2015}} it was located at approximately {{Coord|80.37|N|72.62|W|name=Geomagnetic North Pole 2015 est}}, on [[Ellesmere Island]], [[Nunavut]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref name=NGDC/&gt;

The South Geomagnetic Pole is the point where the axis of this best-fitting tilted dipole intersects the Earth's surface in the southern hemisphere. As of 2005 it was calculated to be located at 79.74°S 108.22°E, near the [[Vostok Station]]. 

Because the Earth's actual magnetic field is not an exact dipole, the (calculated) North and South Geomagnetic Poles do not coincide with the North and South Magnetic Poles. If the Earth's magnetic fields were exactly dipolar, the north pole of a magnetic [[compass]] needle would point directly at the North Geomagnetic Pole. In practice it does not because the geomagnetic field that originates in the core has a more complex non-dipolar part, and [[magnetic anomaly|magnetic anomalies]] in the [[Earth's crust]] also contribute to the local field.&lt;ref name=NGDC/&gt; 

The locations of geomagnetic poles are calculated by the [[International Geomagnetic Reference Field]], a statistical fit to measurements of the Earth's field by satellites and in geomagnetic observatories.&lt;ref name=IAGA2010&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/IAGA/vmod/igrf.html |title=International Geomagnetic Reference Field |author=IAGA Division V Working Group V-MOD  |accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Geomagnetic Poles are wandering for the same reason the Magnetic Poles wander.

==Movement==
The geomagnetic poles move over time because the geomagnetic field is produced by motion of the molten iron alloys in the Earth's [[outer core]] (see [[geodynamo]]). Over the past 150 years the poles have moved westward at a rate of 0.05° to 0.1° per year, with little net north or south motion.&lt;ref name=Merrill1996ch2/&gt;

Over several thousand years, the average location of the geomagnetic poles coincides with the geographical poles. [[Paleomagnetism|Paleomagnetists]] have long relied on the ''Geocentric axial dipole (GAD) hypothesis'', which states that, aside from during geomagnetic reversals, the time-averaged position of the geomagnetic poles has always coincided with the geographic poles. There is considerable paleomagnetic evidence supporting this hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Merrill1996ch6&gt;{{harvnb|Merrill|McElhinny|McFadden|1996|loc=Chapter 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geomagnetic reversal==
{{Main|Geomagnetic reversal}}
Over the life of the Earth, the orientation of Earth's magnetic field has reversed many times, with geomagnetic north becoming geomagnetic south and vice versa &amp;ndash; an event known as a [[geomagnetic reversal]]. Evidence of geomagnetic reversals can be seen at [[mid-ocean ridge]]s where [[tectonic plate]]s move apart. As [[magma]] seeps out of the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] and solidifies to become new ocean floor, the magnetic minerals in it are magnetized in the direction of the magnetic field. Thus, starting at the most recently formed ocean floor, one can read out the direction of the magnetic field in previous times as one moves farther away to older ocean floor.

'''George Green''' (14 July 1793 – 31 May 1841) was a British [[mathematical physicist]] who wrote [[An Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and Magnetism|''An Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and Magnetism'' (Green, 1828)]].&lt;ref&gt;This 1828 essay can be found in ''Mathematical papers of the late George Green'', edited by N. M. Ferrers. The website for this is given below.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cannell | first1 = D.M. | year = 1999 | title = George Green: An Enigmatic Mathematician | url = | journal = [[American Mathematical Monthly]] | volume = 106 | issue = 2| pages = 136–151 | doi=10.2307/2589050}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essay introduced several important concepts, among them a theorem similar to the modern [[Green's theorem]], the idea of [[potential]] functions as currently used in [[physics]], and the concept of what are now called [[Green's function]]s. Green was the first person to create a mathematical theory of electricity and magnetism and his theory formed the foundation for the work of other scientists such as [[James Clerk Maxwell]], [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]], and others. His work on [[potential theory]] ran parallel to that of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]].

Green's life story is remarkable in that he was almost entirely self-taught. He received only about one year of formal schooling as a child, between the ages of 8 and 9.

== Early life ==
[[Image:Green's windmill.jpg|thumb|[[Green's Mill]] in [[Sneinton]], the mill owned by Green's father. The mill was renovated in 1986 and is now a science centre.]]
Green was born and lived for most of his life in the English town of [[Sneinton]], Nottinghamshire, now part of the city of [[Nottingham]]. His father, also named George, was a baker who had built and owned a brick [[windmill]] used to grind grain.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt;

In his youth, Green was described as having a frail constitution and a dislike for doing work in his father's bakery. He had no choice in the matter, however, and as was common for the time he likely began working daily to earn his living at the age of five.

=== Robert Goodacre's Academy ===
Roughly 25–50% of children in Nottingham received any schooling in this period. The majority of schools were Sunday schools, run by the Church, and children would typically attend for one or two years only.
Recognizing the young Green's above average intellect, and being in a strong financial situation due to his successful bakery, his father enrolled him in March 1801 at Robert Goodacre's Academy in Upper Parliament Street. Robert Goodacre was a well-known science populariser and educator of the time. He published ''Essay on the Education of Youth'', in which he wrote that he did not "study the interest of the boy but the embryo Man". To a non-specialist, he would have seemed deeply knowledgeable in science and mathematics, but a close inspection of his essay and curriculum revealed that the extent of his mathematical teachings was limited to algebra, trigonometry and logarithms. Thus, Green's later mathematical contributions, which exhibited knowledge of very modern developments in mathematics, could not have resulted from his tenure at the Robert Goodacre Academy. He stayed for only four [[Academic term|terms]] (one school year), and it was speculated by his contemporaries that he probably exhausted all they had to teach him.

=== Move from Nottingham to Sneinton ===
In 1773 George's father moved to [[Nottingham]], which at the time had a reputation for being a pleasant town with open spaces and wide roads. By 1831, however, the population had increased nearly five times, in part due to the budding [[industrial revolution]], and the city became known as one of the worst slums in England. There were frequent riots by starving workers, often associated with special hostility towards bakers and millers on the suspicion that they were hiding grain to drive up food prices.

For these reasons, in 1807, George Green senior bought a plot of land in Sneinton. On this plot of land he built a "brick wind corn mill", now referred to as [[Green's Windmill]]. It was technologically impressive for its time, but required nearly twenty-four-hour maintenance, which was to become George Green's burden for the next twenty years.

== Adult life ==

=== Miller ===
Just as with baking, Green found the responsibilities of operating the mill annoying and tedious. Grain from the fields was arriving continuously at the mill's doorstep, and the sails of the windmill had to be constantly adjusted to the windspeed, both to prevent damage in high winds, and to maximise rotational speed in low winds. The [[millstone]]s that would continuously grind against each other, could wear down or cause a fire if they ran out of grain to grind. Every month the stones, which weighed over a ton, would have to be replaced or repaired.

=== Family life ===
In 1823 Green formed a relationship with Jane Smith, the daughter of William Smith, hired by Green Senior as mill manager. Although Green and Jane Smith never married, Jane eventually became known as Jane Green and the couple had seven children together; all but the first had Green as a baptismal name. The youngest child was born 13 months before Green's death. Green provided for his common-law wife and children in his will.&lt;ref&gt;Cannel, D. M. and Lord, N. J.; Lord, N. J (March 1993). "George Green, mathematician and physicist 1793–1841". The Mathematical Gazette (The Mathematical Gazette, Vol. 77, No. 478) 77 (478): 26–51. {{doi|10.2307/3619259}}. {{JSTOR|3619259}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nottingham Subscription Library ===
When Green was thirty, he became a member of the [[Nottingham Subscription Library]]. This library exists today, and was likely one of the only sources of Green's advanced mathematical knowledge. Unlike more conventional libraries, the subscription library was exclusive to a hundred or so subscribers, and the first on the list of subscribers was the Duke of Newcastle. This library catered to requests for specialised books and journals that satisfied the particular interests of their subscribers.

=== 1828 essay ===
[[Image:GreenEssay.png|thumb|The title page to Green's original essay on what is now known as Green's theorem.]]

In 1828, Green published ''[[An Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and Magnetism]]'', which is the essay he is most famous for today. It was published privately at the author's expense, because he thought it would be presumptuous for a person like himself, with no formal education in mathematics, to submit the paper to an established journal. When Green published his ''Essay'', it was sold on a subscription basis to 51 people, most of whom were friends and probably could not understand it.

The wealthy landowner and mathematician [[Edward Bromhead|Sir Edward Bromhead]] bought a copy and encouraged Green to do further work in mathematics. Not believing the offer was sincere, Green did not contact Bromhead for two years.

== Mathematician ==
By the time Green's father died in 1829, the senior Green had become one of the [[gentry]] due to his considerable accumulated wealth and land owned, roughly half of which he left to his son and the other half to his daughter. The young Green, now thirty-six years old, consequently was able to use this wealth to abandon his [[miller]] duties and pursue mathematical studies.

=== Cambridge ===
Members of the Nottingham Subscription Library who knew Green repeatedly insisted that he obtain a proper University education. In particular, one of the library's most prestigious subscribers was Sir Edward Bromhead, with whom Green shared many correspondences; he insisted that Green go to Cambridge.

In 1832, aged nearly forty, Green was admitted as an undergraduate at [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref name=Venn&gt;{{acad|id=GRN832G|name=Green, George}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was particularly insecure about his lack of knowledge of [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Latin]], which were prerequisites, but it turned out not to be as hard for him to learn these as he had envisaged, as the degree of expected mastery was not as high as he had expected. In the mathematics examinations, he won the first-year mathematical prize. He graduated with a BA in 1838 as a 4th [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|Wrangler]] (the 4th highest scoring student in his graduating class, coming after [[James Joseph Sylvester]] who scored 2nd).&lt;ref name=Venn/&gt;

=== College fellow ===
Following his graduation, Green was elected a fellow of the [[Cambridge Philosophical Society]]. Even without his stellar academic standing, the Society had already read and made note of his Essay and three other publications, so Green was welcomed.

The next two years provided an unparalleled opportunity for Green to read, write, and discuss his scientific ideas. In this short time he published an additional six publications with applications to hydrodynamics, sound, and optics.

== Final years and posthumous fame ==
[[File:George Green's Grave - geograph.org.uk - 2160600.jpg|thumb|right|Green's grave, in the grounds of the church not far from his mill]]
In his final years at Cambridge, Green became rather ill, and in 1840 he returned to [[Sneinton]], only to die a year later. There are rumours that at Cambridge, Green had "succumbed to alcohol", and some of his earlier supporters, such as Sir Edward Bromhead, tried to distance themselves from him.

Green's work was not well known in the mathematical community during his lifetime. Besides Green himself, the first mathematician to quote his 1828 work was the Briton [[Robert Murphy (mathematician)|Robert Murphy]] (1806–1843) in his 1833 work. In 1845, four years after Green's death, Green's work was rediscovered by the young William Thomson (then aged 21), later known as [[Lord Kelvin]], who popularised it for future mathematicians. According to the book "George Green" by D.M. Cannell, William Thomson noticed Murphy's citation of Green's 1828 essay but found it difficult to locate Green's 1828 work; he finally got some copies of Green's 1828 work from [[William Hopkins]] in 1845.

In 1871 [[N. M. Ferrers]] assembled ''The Mathematical Papers of the late George Green'' for publication.&lt;ref&gt;[[N. M. Ferrers]] editor (1871) [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=umhistmath;idno=AAN8197.0001.001 The Mathematical Papers of the late George Green], [[Macmillan Publishers]], link from [[University of Michigan]] Historical Math Collection&lt;/ref&gt;

Green's work on the motion of waves in a canal (resulting in what is known as [[Green's law]]) anticipates the [[WKB approximation]] of [[quantum mechanics]], while his research on light-waves and the properties of the [[ether]] produced what is now known as the [[Cauchy-Green tensor]]. Green's theorem and functions were important tools in classical mechanics, and were revised by [[Julian Schwinger|Schwinger]]'s 1948 work on [[electrodynamics]] that led to his 1965 Nobel prize (shared with [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]] and [[Shin-Ichiro Tomonaga|Tomonaga]]). Green's functions later also proved useful in analysing [[superconductivity]]. On a visit to Nottingham in 1930, [[Albert Einstein]] commented that Green had been 20 years ahead of his time. The theoretical physicist [[Julian Schwinger]] who used Green's functions in his ground-breaking works, published a tribute entitled "The Greening of Quantum Field Theory: George and I" in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Schwinger | first = Julian | authorlink=Julian Schwinger | year = 1993 | arxiv=hep-ph/9310283| title=The Greening of quantum Field Theory: George and I |bibcode = 1993hep.ph...10283S | pages = 10283 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[George Green Library]] at the [[University of Nottingham]] is named after him, and houses the majority of the university's science and engineering Collection. ''The George Green Institute for Electromagnetics Research'', a research group in the [[University of Nottingham]] engineering department, is also named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=George Green Institute for Electromagnetics Research|url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/ggiemr/about.aspx|accessdate=17 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140117091507/http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/ggiemr/about.aspx|archivedate=17 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, [[Green's Windmill]] was restored to working order. It now serves both as a working example of a 19th-century [[windmill]] and as a museum and science centre dedicated to Green.

[[Westminster Abbey]] has a memorial stone for Green in the nave adjoining the graves of [[Sir Isaac Newton]] and Lord Kelvin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/george-green George Green] from [[Westminster Abbey]]&lt;/ref&gt;

His work and influence on nineteenth century applied physics had been largely forgotten until the publication of his biography by [[Mary Cannell]] in 1993.

== Source of knowledge ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2012}}
It is unclear to historians exactly where Green obtained information on current developments in mathematics, as Nottingham had little in the way of intellectual resources. What is even more mysterious is that Green had used "the Mathematical Analysis," a form of calculus derived from [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] that was virtually unheard of, or even actively discouraged, in England at the time (due to Leibniz being a contemporary of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] who had his own methods that were championed in England). This form of calculus, and the developments of mathematicians such as [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]], [[Sylvestre François Lacroix|Lacroix]] and [[Siméon Denis Poisson|Poisson]] were not taught even at Cambridge, let alone Nottingham, and yet Green had not only heard of these developments, but also improved upon them.

It is speculated that only one person educated in mathematics, [[John Toplis]], headmaster of [[Nottingham High School]] 1806–1819, graduate from Cambridge and an enthusiast of French mathematics, is known to have lived in Nottingham at the time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11046">In [[combinatorics]], a '''greedoid''' is a type of [[set system]]. It arises from the notion of the [[matroid]], which was originally introduced by [[Hassler Whitney|Whitney]] in 1935 to study [[planar graph]]s and was later used by [[Jack Edmonds|Edmonds]] to characterize a class of optimization problems that can be solved by [[greedy algorithm]]s. Around 1980, [[Bernhard Korte|Korte]] and [[László Lovász|Lovász]] introduced the greedoid to further generalize this characterization of greedy algorithms; hence the name greedoid. Besides [[mathematical optimization]], greedoids have also been connected to [[graph theory]], language theory, [[poset]] theory, and other [[areas of mathematics]].

==Definitions==
A '''set system''' (''F'', E) is a collection ''F'' of [[subset]]s of a ground set E (i.e. ''F'' is a subset of the [[power set]] of E). When considering a greedoid, a member of ''F'' is called a '''feasible set'''. When considering a [[matroid]], a feasible set is also known as an ''independent set''.

An '''accessible set system''' (''F'', E) is a set system in which every nonempty feasible set X contains an element x such that X\{x} is feasible. This implies that any nonempty, [[finite set|finite]], accessible set system necessarily contains the [[empty set]] ∅.&lt;ref&gt;Note that the accessibility property is strictly weaker than the ''hereditary property'' of a [[matroid]], which requires that ''every'' subset of an independent set be independent.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''greedoid''' (''F'', E) is an accessible set system that satisfies the ''exchange property'':

* for all X,Y ∈ ''F'' with |X| &gt; |Y|, there is some x ∈ X\Y such that Y∪{x} ∈ ''F''

(Note:  Some people reserve the term ''exchange property'' for a condition on the bases of a greedoid, and prefer to call the above condition the “Augmentation Property”.)

A '''basis''' of a greedoid is a maximal feasible set, meaning it is a feasible set but not contained in any other one.  A basis of a subset X of E is a maximal feasible set contained in X.

The '''rank''' of a greedoid is the size of a basis.  
By the exchange property, all bases have the same size.
Thus, the rank function is [[well defined]].  The rank of a subset X of E is the size of a basis of X. Just as with matroids, greedoids have a [[cryptomorphism]] in terms of rank functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Björner|first1=Anders|last2=Ziegler|first2=Günter M.|authorlink2=Günter M. Ziegler|authorlink1=Anders Björner|chapter=8. Introduction to greedoids|series=Encyclopedia of Mathematics and its Applications|volume=40|editor-last=White|editor-first=Neil|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=1992|isbn=0-521-38165-7|pages=284–357|doi=10.1017/CBO9780511662041.009|ref=harv|mr=1165537| zbl=0772.05026 |title=Matroid Applications}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
A function &lt;math&gt;r:2^E \to \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is the rank function of a greedoid on the ground set E if and only if &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is subcardinal, monotonic, and locally semimodular, that is, for any &lt;math&gt;X,Y \subseteq E&lt;/math&gt; and any &lt;math&gt;e,f \in E&lt;/math&gt; we have
* '''subcardinality''': &lt;math&gt;r(X)\le|X|&lt;/math&gt;;
* '''monotonic''': &lt;math&gt;r(X)\le r(Y)&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;X \subseteq Y \subseteq E&lt;/math&gt;; and
*'''locally semimodularity''': &lt;math&gt;r(X) = r(X\cup\{e,f\})&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;r(X) = r(X \cup \{e\}) = r(X \cup \{f\})&lt;/math&gt;.

==Classes==
Most classes of greedoids have many equivalent definitions in terms of set system, language, poset, [[simplicial complex]], and so on. The following description takes the traditional route of listing only a couple of the more well-known characterizations.

An '''interval greedoid''' (''F'', E) is a greedoid that satisfies the ''Interval Property'':

* if A, B, C ∈ ''F'' with A ⊆ B ⊆ C, then, for all x ∈ E\C,  (A∪{x} ∈ ''F'' and C∪{x} ∈ ''F'') implies B∪{x} ∈ ''F''

Equivalently, an interval greedoid is a greedoid such that the union of any two feasible sets is feasible if it is contained in another feasible set.

An '''[[antimatroid]]''' (''F'', E) is a greedoid that satisfies the ''Interval Property without Upper Bounds'':

* if A, B ∈ ''F'' with A ⊆ B, then, for all x ∈ E\B, A∪{x} ∈ ''F'' implies B∪{x} ∈ ''F''

Equivalently, an antimatroid is (i) a greedoid with a unique basis; or (ii) an accessible set system closed under union.  It is easy to see that an antimatroid is also an interval greedoid.

A '''[[matroid]]''' (''F'', E) is a non-empty greedoid that satisfies the ''Interval Property without Lower Bounds'':

* if B, C ∈ ''F'' with B ⊆ C, then, for all x ∈ E\C, C∪{x} ∈ ''F'' implies B∪{x} ∈ ''F''

It is easy to see that a matroid is also an interval greedoid.

==Examples==
*Consider an undirected [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] G.  Let the ground set be the edges of G and the feasible sets be the edge set of each ''forest'' (i.e. subgraph containing no cycle) of G. This set system is called the '''cycle matroid'''. A set system is said to be a [[graphic matroid]] if it is the cycle matroid of some graph. (Originally cycle matroid was defined on '''circuits''', or minimal ''dependent sets''. Hence the name cycle.)
*Consider a finite, undirected graph G [[rooted graph|rooted]] at the vertex r. Let the ground set be the vertices of G and the feasible sets be the vertex subsets containing r that induce connected subgraphs of G. This is called the '''vertex search greedoid''' and is a kind of antimatroid.
*Consider a finite, [[directed graph]] D rooted at r.  Let the ground set be the (directed) edges of D and the feasible sets be the edge sets of each directed subtree rooted at r with all edges pointing away from r.  This is called the '''line search greedoid''', or '''directed branching greedoid'''.  It is an interval greedoid, but neither an antimatroid nor a matroid.
*Consider an m-by-n [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] M.  Let the ground set E be the indices of the columns from 1 to n and the feasible sets be ''F'' = {X ⊆ E: submatrix M&lt;sub&gt;{1,...,|X&lt;nowiki&gt;|}&lt;/nowiki&gt;,X&lt;/sub&gt; is an [[invertible matrix]]}. This is called the '''Gaussian elimination greedoid''' because this structure underlies the [[Gaussian elimination]] algorithm.  It is a greedoid, but not an interval greedoid.

== Greedy algorithm ==

In general, a [[greedy algorithm]] is just an iterative process in which a ''locally best choice'', usually an input of minimum weight, is chosen each round until all available choices have been exhausted.
In order to describe a greedoid-based condition in which a greedy algorithm is optimal, we need some more common terminologies in greedoid theory.
[[Without loss of generality]], we consider a greedoid G = (''F'', E) with E finite.

A subset X of E is '''rank feasible''' if the largest intersection of X with any feasible set has size equal to the rank of X.
In a matroid, every subset of E is rank feasible.
But the equality does not hold for greedoids in general.

A function w: E → ℝ is '''''R''-compatible''' if {x ∈ E: w(x) ≥ c} is rank feasible for all [[real number]]s c.

An objective function f: 2&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt; → ℝ is '''linear''' over a set S if, for all X ⊆ S, we have f(X) = Σ&lt;sub&gt;x ∈ X&lt;/sub&gt; w(x) for some [[weight function]] w: S → ℜ.

'''Proposition.'''  A greedy algorithm is optimal for every '''''R'''''-compatible linear objective function over a greedoid.

The intuition behind this proposition is that, during the iterative process, each optimal exchange of minimum weight is made possible by the exchange property, and optimal results are obtainable from the feasible sets in the underlying greedoid. This result guarantees the optimality of many well-known algorithms. For example, a [[minimum spanning tree]] of a [[weighted graph]] may be obtained using [[Kruskal's algorithm]], which is a greedy algorithm for the cycle matroid. [[Prim's algorithm]] can be explained by taking the vertex search greedoid instead.

In [[telecommunication]], '''Hamming codes''' are a family of [[linear code|linear error-correcting codes]]. Hamming codes can detect up to two-bit errors or correct one-bit errors without detection of uncorrected errors. By contrast, the simple [[parity bit|parity code]] cannot correct errors, and can detect only an odd number of bits in error. Hamming codes are [[perfect code]]s, that is, they achieve the highest possible [[Block code#The rate R|rate]] for codes with their [[block code#The block length n|block length]] and [[Block code#The distance d|minimum distance]] of three.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~venkatg/teaching/codingtheory/notes/notes1.pdf See Lemma 12 of]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Richard Hamming]] invented Hamming codes in 1950 as a way of automatically correcting errors introduced by [[punched card]] readers. In his original paper, Hamming elaborated his general idea, but specifically focused on the [[Hamming(7,4)]] code which adds three parity bits to four bits of data.{{Sfnp|Hamming|1950|pp=153&amp;ndash;154}}

In [[mathematics|mathematical]] terms, Hamming codes are a class of binary linear codes. For each integer {{Math|''r'' ≥ 2}} there is a code with [[Block code#The block length n|block length]] {{Math|''n'' {{=}} 2&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} and [[Block code#The message length k|message length]] {{Math|''k'' {{=}} 2&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; − ''r'' − 1}}. Hence the rate of Hamming codes is {{Math|''R'' {{=}} ''k'' / ''n'' {{=}} 1 − ''r'' / (2&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1)}}, which is the highest possible for codes with minimum distance of three (i.e., the minimal number of bit changes needed to go from any code word to any other code word is three) and block length {{Math|2&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}. The [[parity-check matrix]] of a Hamming code is constructed by listing all columns of length {{Math|''r''}} that are non-zero, which means that the [[dual code]] of the Hamming code is the [[Hadamard code|shortened Hadamard code]]. The parity-check matrix has the property that any two columns are pairwise [[Linear Independence|linearly independent]].

Due to the limited redundancy that Hamming codes add to the data, they can only detect and correct errors when the error rate is low. This is the case in computer memory ([[ECC memory]]), where bit errors are extremely rare and Hamming codes are widely used. In this context, an extended Hamming code having one extra parity bit is often used. Extended Hamming codes achieve a Hamming distance of four, which allows the decoder to distinguish between when at most one one-bit error occurs and when any two-bit errors occur. In this sense, extended Hamming codes are single-error correcting and double-error detecting, abbreviated as '''SECDED'''.

== History ==
Richard Hamming, the inventor of Hamming codes, worked at [[Bell Labs]] in the late 1940s on the Bell [[Model V]] computer, an [[electromechanical]] relay-based machine with cycle times in seconds. Input was fed in on [[Punched tape|punched paper tape]], seven-eighths of an inch wide which had up to six holes per row. During weekdays, when errors in the relays were detected, the machine would stop and flash lights so that the operators could correct the problem. During after-hours periods and on weekends, when there were no operators, the machine simply moved on to the next job.

Hamming worked on weekends, and grew increasingly frustrated with having to restart his programs from scratch due to detected errors. In a taped interview Hamming said, "And so I said, 'Damn it, if the machine can detect an error, why can't it locate the position of the error and correct it?'".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Thompson|first=Thomas M.|title=From Error-Correcting Codes through Sphere Packings to Simple Groups|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ggqxuG31B3cC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=%22From%20Error-Correcting%20Codes%20through%20Sphere%20Packings%20to%20Simple%20Groups%22&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q=%22model%20v%22&amp;f=false|volume=|pages=16-17|year=1983|series=The Carus Mathematical Monographs (#21)|publisher=Mathematical Association of America|isbn=0-88385-023-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next few years, he worked on the problem of error-correction, developing an increasingly powerful array of algorithms. In 1950, he published what is now known as Hamming Code, which remains in use today in applications such as [[Dynamic random access memory#Error detection and correction|ECC memory]].

=== Codes predating Hamming ===
A number of simple error-detecting codes were used before Hamming codes, but none were as effective as Hamming codes in the same overhead of space.

==== Parity ====
{{main article|Parity bit}}

Parity adds a single [[binary digit|bit]] that indicates whether the number of ones (bit-positions with values of one) in the preceding data was [[even number|even]] or [[odd number|odd]]. If an odd number of bits is changed in transmission, the message will change parity and the error can be detected at this point; however, the bit that changed may have been the parity bit itself. The most common convention is that a parity value of one indicates that there is an odd number of ones in the data, and a parity value of zero indicates that there is an even number of ones. If the number of bits changed is even, the check bit will be valid and the error will not be detected.

Moreover, parity does not indicate which bit contained the error, even when it can detect it. The data must be discarded entirely and re-transmitted from scratch. On a noisy transmission medium, a successful transmission could take a long time or may never occur. However, while the quality of parity checking is poor, since it uses only a single bit, this method results in the least overhead.

====Two-out-of-five code====
{{main article|Two-out-of-five code}}

A two-out-of-five code is an encoding scheme which uses five bits consisting of exactly three 0s and two 1s. This provides ten possible combinations, enough to represent the digits 0–9. This scheme can detect all single bit-errors, all odd numbered bit-errors and some even numbered bit-errors (for example the flipping of both 1-bits). However it still cannot correct any of these errors.

====Repetition====
{{main article|Triple modular redundancy}}

Another code in use at the time repeated every data bit multiple times in order to ensure that it was sent correctly. For instance, if the data bit to be sent is a 1, an {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 3}} ''[[repetition code]]'' will send 111. If the three bits received are not identical, an error occurred during transmission. If the channel is clean enough, most of the time only one bit will change in each triple. Therefore, 001, 010, and 100 each correspond to a 0 bit, while 110, 101, and 011 correspond to a 1 bit, with the greater quantity of digits that are the same ('0' or a '1') indicating what the data bit should be. A code with this ability to reconstruct the original message in the presence of errors is known as an ''error-correcting'' code. This triple repetition code is a Hamming code with {{nowrap|1=''m'' = 2,}} since there are two parity bits, and {{nowrap|1=2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 2 − 1 = 1}} data bit.

Such codes cannot correctly repair all errors, however. In our example, if the channel flips two bits and the receiver gets 001, the system will detect the error, but conclude that the original bit is 0, which is incorrect. If we increase the size of the bit string to four, we can detect all two-bit errors but cannot correct them, (the quantity of parity bits is even) at five bits, we can correct all two-bit errors, but not all three-bit errors.

Moreover, increasing the size of the parity bit string is inefficient, reducing throughput by three times in our original case, and the efficiency drops drastically as we increase the number of times each bit is duplicated in order to detect and correct more errors.

==Hamming codes==
If more error-correcting bits are included with a message, and if those bits can be arranged such that different incorrect bits produce different error results, then bad bits could be identified. In a seven-bit message, there are seven possible single bit errors, so three error control bits could potentially specify not only that an error occurred but also which bit caused the error.

Hamming studied the existing coding schemes, including two-of-five, and generalized their concepts. To start with, he developed a [[wikt:nomenclature|nomenclature]] to describe the system, including the number of data bits and error-correction bits in a block. For instance, parity includes a single bit for any data word, so assuming [[ASCII]] words with seven bits, Hamming described this as an ''(8,7)'' code, with eight bits in total, of which seven are data. The repetition example would be ''(3,1)'', following the same logic. The [[code rate]] is the second number divided by the first, for our repetition example, 1/3.

Hamming also noticed the problems with flipping two or more bits, and described this as the "distance" (it is now called the ''[[Hamming distance]]'', after him). Parity has a distance of 2, so one bit flip can be detected, but not corrected and any two bit flips will be invisible. The (3,1) repetition has a distance of 3, as three bits need to be flipped in the same triple to obtain another code word with no visible errors. It can correct one-bit errors or detect but not correct two-bit errors. A (4,1) repetition (each bit is repeated four times) has a distance of 4, so flipping three bits can be detected, but not corrected. When three bits flip in the same group there can be situations where attempting to correct will produce the wrong code word. In general, a code with distance ''k'' can detect but not correct {{nowrap|''k'' − 1}} errors.

Hamming was interested in two problems at once: increasing the distance as much as possible, while at the same time increasing the code rate as much as possible. During the 1940s he developed several encoding schemes that were dramatic improvements on existing codes. The key to all of his systems was to have the parity bits overlap, such that they managed to check each other as well as the data.

===General algorithm===
The following general algorithm generates a single-error correcting (SEC) code for any number of bits. The main idea is to choose the error-correcting bits such that the index-XOR (the [[Exclusive or|XOR]] of all the bit positions containing a 1) is 0. We use positions 1, 10, 100, etc (in binary) as the error-correcting bits, which guarantees it is possible to set the error-correcting bits so that the index-XOR of the whole message is 0. If the receiver receives a string with index-XOR 0, they can conclude there were no corruptions, and otherwise, the index-XOR indicates the index of the corrupted bit.

The following steps implement this algorithm:

# Number the bits starting from 1: bit 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, etc.
# Write the bit numbers in binary:  1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, etc.
# All bit positions that are powers of two (have a single 1 bit in the binary form of their position) are parity bits: 1, 2, 4, 8, etc. (1, 10, 100, 1000)
# All other bit positions, with two or more 1 bits in the binary form of their position, are data bits.
# Each data bit is included in a unique set of 2 or more parity bits, as determined by the binary form of its bit position.
## Parity bit 1 covers all bit positions which have the least significant bit set: bit 1 (the parity bit itself), 3, 5, 7, 9, etc.
## Parity bit 2 covers all bit positions which have the second least significant bit set: bit 2 (the parity bit itself), 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, etc.
## Parity bit 4 covers all bit positions which have the third least significant bit set: bits 4–7, 12–15, 20–23, etc.
## Parity bit 8 covers all bit positions which have the fourth least significant bit set: bits 8–15, 24–31, 40–47, etc.
## In general each parity bit covers all bits where the bitwise AND of the parity position and the bit position is non-zero.

The form of the parity is irrelevant.  Even parity is mathematically simpler, but there is no difference in practice.

This general rule can be shown visually:

Shown are only 20 encoded bits (5 parity, 15 data) but the pattern continues indefinitely.  The key thing about Hamming Codes that can be seen from visual inspection is that any given bit is included in a unique set of parity bits.  To check for errors, check all of the parity bits.  The pattern of errors, called the [[Syndrome decoding|error syndrome]], identifies the bit in error.  If all parity bits are correct, there is no error.  Otherwise, the sum of the positions of the erroneous parity bits identifies the erroneous bit.  For example, if the parity bits in positions 1, 2 and 8 indicate an error, then bit 1+2+8=11 is in error.  If only one parity bit indicates an error, the parity bit itself is in error.

As you can see, if you have {{mvar|m}} parity bits, it can cover bits from 1 up to &lt;math&gt;2^m-1&lt;/math&gt;. If we subtract out the parity bits, we are left with &lt;math&gt;2^m-m-1&lt;/math&gt; bits we can use for the data. As {{mvar|m}} varies, we get all the possible Hamming codes:

== {{Anchor|SECDED}}Hamming codes with additional parity (SECDED) ==
Hamming codes have a minimum distance of 3, which means that the decoder can detect and correct a single error, but it cannot distinguish a double bit error of some codeword from a single bit error of a different codeword.  Thus, some double-bit errors will be incorrectly decoded as if they were single bit errors and therefore go undetected, unless no correction is attempted.

To remedy this shortcoming, Hamming codes can be extended by an extra parity bit.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} This way, it is possible to increase the minimum distance of the Hamming code to 4, which allows the decoder to distinguish between single bit errors and two-bit errors. Thus the decoder can detect and correct a single error and at the same time detect (but not correct) a double error.

If the decoder does not attempt to correct errors, it can reliably detect triple bit errors. If the decoder does correct errors, some triple errors will be mistaken for single errors and "corrected" to the wrong value. Error correction is therefore a trade-off between certainty (the ability to reliably detect triple bit errors) and resiliency (the ability to keep functioning in the face of single bit errors).

This extended Hamming code is popular in computer memory systems, where it is known as ''SECDED'' (abbreviated from ''single error correction, double error detection'').  Particularly popular is the (72,64) code, a truncated (127,120) Hamming code plus an additional parity bit, which has the same space overhead as a (9,8) parity code.

==[7,4] Hamming code==
[[File:Hamming(7,4).svg|thumb|300px|Graphical depiction of the four data bits and three parity bits and which parity bits apply to which data bits]]

{{main article|Hamming(7,4)}}

In 1950, Hamming introduced the [7,4] Hamming code. It encodes four data bits into seven bits by adding three parity bits. It can detect and correct single-bit errors.  With the addition of an overall parity bit, it can also detect (but not correct) double-bit errors.

===Construction of G and H===
The matrix 
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G} := \begin{pmatrix} \begin{array}{c|c}
I_k &amp; -A^\text{T} \\
\end{array} \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; is called a (canonical) generator matrix of a linear (''n'',''k'') code,

and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H} := \begin{pmatrix} \begin{array}{c|c}
A &amp; I_{n-k} \\
\end{array} \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; is called a [[parity-check matrix]].

This is the construction of '''G''' and '''H''' in standard (or systematic) form. Regardless of form, '''G''' and '''H''' for linear block codes must satisfy

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H}\,\mathbf{G}^\text{T} = \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;, an all-zeros matrix.&lt;ref name=Moon&gt;Moon T. Error correction coding: Mathematical Methods and
Algorithms. John Wiley and Sons, 2005.(Cap. 3) {{ISBN|978-0-471-64800-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since [7, 4, 3] = [''n'', ''k'', ''d''] = [2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1, 2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;−1−''m'', ''m'']. The [[parity-check matrix]] '''H''' of a Hamming code is constructed by listing all columns of length ''m'' that are pair-wise independent.

Thus '''H''' is a matrix whose left side is all of the nonzero n-tuples where order of the n-tuples in the columns of matrix does not matter. The right hand side is just the (''n'' − ''k'')-[[identity matrix]].

So '''G''' can be obtained from '''H''' by taking the transpose of the left hand side of '''H''' with the identity k-[[identity matrix]] on the left hand side of '''G'''.

The code [[generator matrix]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}&lt;/math&gt; and the [[parity-check matrix]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H}&lt;/math&gt; are:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G} := \begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}_{4,7}&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H} := \begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}_{3,7}.&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, these matrices can be mutated into equivalent non-systematic codes by the following operations:&lt;ref name=Moon/&gt;

* Column permutations (swapping columns)
* Elementary row operations (replacing a row with a linear combination of rows)

===Encoding===
;Example

From the above matrix we have 2&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = 16 codewords.
Let &lt;math&gt;\vec{a}&lt;/math&gt; be a row vector of binary data bits, &lt;math&gt; \vec{a}=[a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4],\quad a_i\in \{0,1\} &lt;/math&gt;. The codeword &lt;math&gt;\vec{x}&lt;/math&gt; for any of the 16 possible data vectors &lt;math&gt; \vec{a} &lt;/math&gt; is given by the standard matrix product &lt;math&gt;\vec{x}=\vec{a}G &lt;/math&gt; where the summing operation is done modulo-2.

For example, let &lt;math&gt;\vec{a}=[1,0,1,1]&lt;/math&gt;. Using the generator matrix &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; from above, we have (after applying modulo 2, to the sum),

&lt;math&gt;\vec{x}=\vec{a}G= \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

===[7,4] Hamming code with an additional parity bit===
[[File:Hamming(8,4).svg|thumb|300px|The same [7,4] example from above with an extra parity bit. This diagram is not meant to correspond to the matrix H for this example.]]

The [7,4] Hamming code can easily be extended to an [8,4] code by adding an extra parity bit on top of the (7,4) encoded word (see [[Hamming(7,4)]]).
This can be summed up with the revised matrices:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G} := \begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}_{4,8}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{H} :=
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}_{4,8}
.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!-- the equations here before had two (2) errors--these satisfy G*H^T=0 --&gt;

&lt;!-- I don't have the time to fix it myself right now, but in the format G is in after row-reduction, it changes the order --&gt;
&lt;!-- of the bits in the message being delivered... i.e., any of the columns of G with one hi bit will pass the data directly --&gt;
&lt;!-- Ex. [d1 d2 d3 d4] * G = [d1 d2 d3 d4 p1 p2 p3 p4], this is not the same as the format described immediately below it --&gt;
&lt;!-- where the message should be in the format [p1 p2 d1 p3 d2 d3 d4 p4] --&gt;

Note that H is not in standard form. To obtain G, elementary row operations can be used to obtain an equivalent matrix to H in systematic form:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{H} =
\left( \begin{array}{cccc|cccc}
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1  &amp;  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1  &amp;  0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1  &amp;  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0  &amp;  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{array} \right)_{4,8}
.&lt;/math&gt;

For example, the first row in this matrix is the sum of the second and third rows of H in non-systematic form. Using the systematic construction for Hamming codes from above, the matrix A is apparent and the systematic form of G is written as

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{G} =
\left( \begin{array}{cccc|cccc}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0  &amp;  0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0  &amp;  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0  &amp;  1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1  &amp;  1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \end{array} \right)_{4,8}
.&lt;/math&gt;

The non-systematic form of G can be row reduced (using elementary row operations) to match this matrix.

The addition of the fourth row effectively computes the sum of all the codeword bits (data and parity) as the fourth parity bit.

For example, &lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;1011&lt;/span&gt; is encoded (using the non-systematic form of G at the start of this section) into &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;01&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;011&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; where blue digits are data; red digits are parity bits from the [7,4] Hamming code; and the green digit is the parity bit added by the [8,4] code.
The green digit makes the parity of the [7,4] codewords even.

Finally, it can be shown that the minimum distance has increased from 3, in the [7,4] code, to 4 in the [8,4] code. Therefore, the code can be defined as [8,4] Hamming code. &lt;!-- if we need more proof, or a citation, let me know --&gt;

[[File:Heinrich Suter.png|thumb|Heinrich Suter]]
'''Heinrich Suter''' (4 January 1848 in [[Hedingen]] &amp;ndash; 17 March 1922 in [[Dornach]]) was a historian of science specializing in [[Islamic mathematics]] and [[Islamic astronomy|astronomy]].

==Education and career==
After graduation from the ''Industrie Schule'' at Zürich, Suter studied in [[Berlin]] (1869/70) and at [[ETH Zürich]] and the [[University of Zürich]]. He received in 1871 from the University of Zürich his [[Promotion (Germany)|Promotierung]] (Ph.D.) with dissertation ''Geschichte der mathematischen Wissenschaften von den ältesten Zeiten bis Ende des 16. Jahrhunderts''. His dissertation was published in 1872 as a book and was subsequently translated into Russian.

In 1874 Suter began teaching as a vicar at the Gymnasium in [[Schaffhausen]], then taught from 1876 to 1886 in [[Aarau]], and finally from 1886 until his retirement in 1916 in Zürich.

Suter in his early forties learned Arabic and acquired some knowledge of Syriac, Persian and Turkish. He studied the history of mathematics and astronomy in the Islamic societies. In [[Moritz Cantor]]'s  "Abhandlungen zur Geschichte der Mathematik“  were published in 1892 Suter's translation of the mathematically related entries in the ''Kitāb al-Fihrist'' of [[Ibn al-Nadim]] and in 1893 Suter's translation of the mathematical parts of the catalog of the ''[[Khedivial Library]]'' in [[Cairo]]. One of his most important works is his work, commissioned by the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences, on the astronomical tables of [[Al-Khwarizmi]].

In 1904 Suter was an Invited Speaker of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]] in Heidelberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=''Zur Geschichte der Mathematik bei den Indern und Araben'' von H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1082">In [[mathematics]], the '''irrational base discrete weighted transform''' (IBDWT) is a variant of the [[fast Fourier transform]] using an [[irrational number|irrational]] base; it was developed by [[Richard Crandall]] ([[Reed College]]), [[Barry Fagin]] ([[Dartmouth College]]) and [[Joshua Doenias]] ([[NeXT|NeXT Software]]){{fact|date=April 2018}} in the early 1990s using [[Mathematica]].{{fact|date=April 2018}}

The IBDWT is used in the [[Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search]]'s client [[Prime95]] to perform [[FFT multiplication]], as well as in other programs implementing [[Lucas-Lehmer test]], such as CUDALucas and Glucas.

In the mathematical theory of [[dynamical systems]], an '''isochron''' is a set of initial conditions for the system that all lead to the same long-term behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;J. Guckenheimer, Isochrons and phaseless sets, J. Math. Biol., 1:259&amp;ndash;273 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S.M. Cox and A.J. Roberts, Initial conditions for models of dynamical systems, Physica D, 85:126&amp;ndash;141 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical isochron==
===An introductory example===

Consider the [[ordinary differential equation]] for a solution &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt; evolving in time:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + \frac{dy}{dt} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

This [[ordinary differential equation]] (ODE) needs two [[initial conditions]] at, say, time &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt;.  Denote the [[initial conditions]] by &lt;math&gt;y(0)=y_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;dy/dt(0)=y'_0&lt;/math&gt;  where &lt;math&gt;y_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y'_0&lt;/math&gt; are some parameters.  The following argument shows that the isochrons for this system are here the straight lines &lt;math&gt;y_0+y'_0=\mbox{constant}&lt;/math&gt;.

The general solution of the above ODE is

:&lt;math&gt;y=t+A+B\exp(-t) &lt;/math&gt;

Now, as time increases, &lt;math&gt;t\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;, the exponential terms decays very quickly to zero ([[exponential decay]]). Thus ''all'' solutions of the ODE quickly approach &lt;math&gt;y\to t+A&lt;/math&gt;.  That is, ''all'' solutions with the same &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; have the same long term evolution.  The [[exponential decay]] of the &lt;math&gt;B\exp(-t)&lt;/math&gt; term brings together a host of solutions to share the same long term evolution.  Find the isochrons by answering which initial conditions have the same &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

At the initial time &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;y_0=A+B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y'_0=1-B&lt;/math&gt;.  Algebraically eliminate the immaterial constant &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; from these two equations to deduce that all initial conditions &lt;math&gt;y_0+y'_0=1+A&lt;/math&gt; have the same &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, hence the same long term evolution, and hence form an isochron.

===Accurate forecasting requires isochrons===

Let's turn to a more interesting application of the notion of isochrons.  Isochrons arise when trying to forecast predictions from models of dynamical systems.  Consider the toy system of two coupled [[ordinary differential equations]]

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dx}{dt} = -xy \text{ and } \frac{dy}{dt} = -y+x^2 - 2y^2&lt;/math&gt;

A marvellous mathematical trick is the [[normal form (mathematics)]] transformation.&lt;ref&gt;A.J. Roberts, Normal form transforms separate slow and fast modes in stochastic dynamical systems, ''Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications'' 387:12&amp;ndash;38 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  Here the coordinate transformation near the origin

:&lt;math&gt; x=X+XY+\cdots \text{ and } y=Y+2Y^2+X^2+\cdots&lt;/math&gt;

to new variables &lt;math&gt;(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt; transforms the dynamics to the separated form

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dX}{dt} = -X^3+ \cdots \text{ and } \frac{dY}{dt} = (-1-2X^2+\cdots)Y&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, near the origin, &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; decays to zero exponentially quickly as its equation is &lt;math&gt;dY/dt= (\text{negative})Y&lt;/math&gt;.  So the long term evolution is determined solely by &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;: the &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; equation is the model.  

Let us use the &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; equation to predict the future.  Given some initial values &lt;math&gt;(x_0,y_0)&lt;/math&gt; of the original variables: what initial value should we use for &lt;math&gt;X(0)&lt;/math&gt;?  Answer: the &lt;math&gt;X_0&lt;/math&gt; that has the same long term evolution.  In the normal form above, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; evolves independently of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;.  So all initial conditions with the same &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, but different &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, have the same long term evolution.  Fix &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and vary &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; gives the curving isochrons in the &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; plane.  For example, very near the origin the isochrons of the above system are approximately the lines &lt;math&gt;x-Xy=X-X^3&lt;/math&gt;.  Find which isochron the initial values &lt;math&gt;(x_0,y_0)&lt;/math&gt; lie on: that isochron is characterised by some  &lt;math&gt;X_0&lt;/math&gt;; the initial condition that gives the correct forecast from the model for all time is then  &lt;math&gt;X(0)=X_0&lt;/math&gt;.

You may find such normal form transformations for relatively simple systems of ordinary differential equations, both deterministic and stochastic, via an interactive web site.[http://www.maths.adelaide.edu.au/anthony.roberts/sdenf.html]

Since the star is currently close to the [[celestial pole]], its elevation is equal to the [[latitude]] of the observer.]]The kamal consists of a rectangular wooden card about {{convert|2|by|1|in|cm}}, to which a string with several equally spaced knots is attached through a hole in the middle of the card. The kamal is used by placing one end of the string in the teeth while the other end is held away from the body roughly parallel to the ground. The card is then moved along the string, positioned so the lower edge is even with the horizon, and the upper edge is occluding a target star, typically [[Polaris]] because its angle to the horizon does not change with longitude or time. The angle can then be measured by counting the number of knots from the teeth to the card, or a particular knot can be tied into the string if travelling to a known latitude.

[[File:Kamal Polaris Side.png|thumb|Side view of how the kamal was used to measure the elevations of stars. While the lower edge aligns with the horizon, the upper edge indicates the elevation of the star.]]The knots were typically tied to measure angles of one finger-width. When held at arm's length, the width of a finger measures an angle that remains fairly similar from person to person. This was widely used (and still is today) for rough angle measurements, an angle known as ''issabah إصبع'' for 'finger' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], or a ''chih'' in Chinese.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} By modern measure, this is about 1 degree, 36 minutes, and 25 seconds, or just over 1.5 degrees. It is equal to the [[arcsine]] of the ratio of the width of the finger to the length of the arm.

Due to the limited width of the card, the kamal was only really useful for measuring Polaris in equatorial latitudes, where Polaris remains close to the horizon. This fact may explain why it was not common in Europe. For these higher-latitude needs somewhat more complex devices based on the same principle were used, notably the [[cross-staff]] and [[backstaff]].

The kamal is still a tool recommended for use in [[sea kayak]]ing.&lt;ref name="burch"&gt;Burch, David, ''Fundamentals of Kayak Navigation'', 2nd edition, The Globe Pequot Press, 1993, {{ISBN|1-56440-155-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In such an application, it can be used for estimating distances to land. The distance can be calculated from the formula 

:&lt;math&gt;D=\frac{Sd}{s}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the distance to the object, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the size of the object observed, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the kamal to the observer's eye, and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is the apparent size of the object observed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1458">In [[metric geometry]], the '''Karlsruhe metric''' is a measure of distance that assumes travel is only possible along rays through the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] and circular arcs centered at the origin.The name alludes to the layout of the city of [[Karlsruhe]], which has radial streets and circular avenues around a central point. This metric is also called '''Moscow metric'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.personal.kent.edu/~rmuhamma/Compgeometry/MyCG/CG-Applets/VoroKarlsruhe/karlcli.htm Karlsruhe-Metric Voronoi Diagram]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Karlsruhe distance between two points &lt;math&gt;d_k(p_1,p_2)&lt;/math&gt; is given as

&lt;math&gt;
d_k(p_1,p_2)= \begin{cases}
\min(r_1,r_2) \cdot \delta(p_1,p_2) +|r_1-r_2|,&amp;\text{if } 0\leq \delta(p_1,p_2)\leq 2\\
r_1+r_2,&amp;\text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;(r_i,\varphi_i)&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]] of &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\delta(p_1,p_2)=\min(|\varphi_1-\varphi_2|,2\pi-|\varphi_1-\varphi_2|)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular distance]] between the two points.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13859">'''Lattice-based cryptography''' is the generic term for constructions of [[cryptographic primitive]]s that involve [[Lattice (group)|lattices]], either in the construction itself or in the security proof. Lattice-based constructions are currently important candidates for [[post-quantum cryptography]].  Unlike more widely used and known public-key schemes such as the [[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA]], [[Diffie-Hellman]] or [[Elliptic-curve cryptography|Elliptic-Curve]] cryptosystems, which are [[Shor's algorithm|easily attacked]] by a [[Quantum computing|quantum computer]], some lattice-based constructions appear to be resistant to attack by both classical and quantum computers. Furthermore, many lattice-based constructions are known to be secure under the [[Computational hardness assumption|assumption]] that certain well-studied [[Lattice problem|computational lattice problems]] cannot be solved efficiently.

==History==
In 1996, [[Miklós Ajtai]] introduced the first lattice-based cryptographic construction whose security could be based on the hardness of well-studied lattice problems.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book
| first = Miklós
| last = Ajtai

| pages = 99–108
| publisher =
| doi = 10.1145/237814.237838
| isbn = 0-89791-785-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fundamentally, Ajtai's result was a [[Worst-case to average-case reduction|worst-case to average-case]] [[Polynomial-time reduction|reduction]]. I.e., he showed that a certain average-case lattice problem, known as [[Short integer solution problem|Short Integer Solutions]] (SIS), is at least as hard to solve as a [[Worst-case complexity|worst-case]] lattice problem. He then showed a [[cryptographic hash function]] whose security is equivalent to the computational hardness of SIS.

In 1998, Jeffrey Hoffstein ([[:de:Jeffrey Hoffstein|de]]), [[Jill Pipher]], and [[Joseph H. Silverman]] introduced a lattice-based [[Public-key cryptography|public-key encryption]] scheme, known as [[NTRUEncrypt|NTRU]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoffstein|first=Jeffrey|last2=Pipher|first2=Jill|last3=Silverman|first3=Joseph H.|date=1998-06-21|title=NTRU: A ring-based public key cryptosystem|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0054868|journal=Algorithmic Number Theory|language=en|publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|pages=267–288|doi=10.1007/bfb0054868}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, their scheme is not known to be at least as hard as solving a worst-case lattice problem.

The first lattice-based public-key encryption scheme with provable security was introduced by Oded Regev in 2005,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Regev|first=Oded|date=2005-01-01|title=On Lattices, Learning with Errors, Random Linear Codes, and Cryptography|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1060590.1060603|journal=Proceedings of the Thirty-seventh Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing|series=STOC '05|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=84–93|doi=10.1145/1060590.1060603|isbn=1581139608}}&lt;/ref&gt; together with the [[Learning with errors|Learning with Errors]] problem (LWE).

Practical, Quantum-Secure Key Exchange from LWE|url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2016/659}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much more work has been devoted to constructing additional cryptographic primitives based on LWE and related problems. In 2009, [[Craig Gentry (computer scientist)|Craig Gentry]] introduced the first [[Homomorphic encryption|fully homomorphic encryption]] scheme, which was based on a lattice problem.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Gentry|first=Craig|title=A Fully Homomorphic Encryption Scheme|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Stanford University|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1834954|place=Stanford, CA, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical background ==
A [[lattice (group)|lattice]] &lt;math&gt;L \subset \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all integer linear combinations of basis vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}_1,\ldots, \mathbf{b}_n \in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. I.e., 
&lt;math&gt;L = \Big\{ \sum a_i \mathbf{b}_i \ : \ a_i \in \mathbb{Z} \Big\}\; .&lt;/math&gt;
For example, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^n&lt;/math&gt; is a lattice, generated by the standard orthonormal basis for &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. Crucially, the basis for a lattice is not unique. For example, the vectors &lt;math&gt;(3, 1, 4)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(1,5,9)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;(2, -1, 0)&lt;/math&gt; form an alternative basis for &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^3&lt;/math&gt;.

The most important lattice-based computational problem is the [[Lattice problems|Shortest Vector Problem]] (SVP or sometimes GapSVP), which asks us to approximate the minimal Euclidean length of a non-zero lattice vector. This problem is thought to be hard to solve efficiently, even with approximation factors that are polynomial in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, and even with a quantum computer. Many (though not all) lattice-based cryptographic constructions are known to be secure if SVP is in fact hard in this regime.

==Lattice-based cryptosystems==

== Security ==
Lattice-based cryptographic constructions are the leading candidates for [[Public-key cryptography|public-key]] [[post-quantum cryptography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|title=Lattice-based cryptography|first1=Daniele|last1=Micciancio|first2=Oded|last2=Regev|date=2008-07-22|url=https://www.cims.nyu.edu/~regev/papers/pqc.pdf|accessdate=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the main alternatives to lattice-based cryptography are schemes based on the hardness of [[Integer factorization|factoring]] and [[RSA (cryptosystem)|related problems]] and schemes based on the hardness of the [[discrete logarithm]] and [[Diffie–Hellman problem|related problems]]. However, both factoring and the discrete logarithm are known to be solvable in [[BQP|polynomial time on a quantum computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shor|first=Peter W.|date=1997-10-01|title=Polynomial-Time Algorithms for Prime Factorization and Discrete Logarithms on a Quantum Computer|journal=SIAM Journal on Computing|volume=26|issue=5|pages=1484–1509|doi=10.1137/S0097539795293172|issn=0097-5397|arxiv=quant-ph/9508027}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, algorithms for factorization tend to yield algorithms for discrete logarithm, and vice versa. This further motivates the study of constructions based on alternative assumptions, such as the hardness of lattice problems.

Many lattice-based cryptographic schemes are known to be secure assuming the ''[[Worst-case complexity|worst-case]]'' hardness of certain lattice problems.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; I.e., if there exists an algorithm that can efficiently break the cryptographic scheme with non-negligible probability, then there exists an efficient algorithm that solves a certain lattice problem on any input. In contrast, cryptographic schemes based on, e.g., factoring would be broken if factoring were hard "on an [[Average-case complexity|average input]],&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; even if factoring were in fact hard in the worst case. However, for the more efficient and practical lattice-based constructions (such as schemes based on NTRU and even schemes based on LWE with more aggressive parameters), such worst-case hardness results are not known. For some schemes, worst-case hardness results are known only for certain [[Ideal lattice cryptography|structured lattices]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Functionality ==
For many cryptographic primitives, the only known constructions are based on lattices or closely related objects. These primitives include [[Homomorphic encryption|fully homomorphic encryption]],&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; [[indistinguishability obfuscation]],&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garg|first=Sanjam|last2=Gentry|first2=Craig|last3=Halevi|first3=Shai|last4=Raykova|first4=Mariana|last5=Sahai|first5=Amit|last6=Waters|first6=Brent|date=2013-01-01|title=Candidate Indistinguishability Obfuscation and Functional Encryption for all circuits|url=https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/451}}&lt;/ref&gt; cryptographic multilinear maps, and [[functional encryption]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3597">The '''Leelavati Award''' is an award for outstanding contribution to public outreach in mathematics. It is named after the 12th-century mathematical treatise "[[Lilavati]]" devoted to arithmetic and algebra written by the Indian mathematician [[Bhāskara II]], also known as Bhaskara Achārya. In the book the author posed, in verse form, a series of problems in (elementary) arithmetic to one Leelavati (perhaps his daughter) and followed them up with hints to solutions. This work appears to have been the main source of learning arithmetic and algebra in medieval India. The work was also translated into Persian and was influential in West Asia.

==History==

The Leelavati Prize was handed out for the first time at the closing ceremony of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] (ICM) 2010 in Hyderabad, India.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url = http://www.brilliantstudent.in/news_detail.php?id=866 | title = Leelavati Award for public outreach on mathematics }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.hindu.com/2010/06/09/stories/2010060961982200.htm | title = International math prize named after Leelavati }}&lt;/ref&gt; Established by the Executive Organising Committee (EOC) of the ICM with the endorsement of the IMU Executive Committee (EC), the Leelavati Prize started out to be a one-time international award for outstanding public outreach work for mathematics. The award was so well received at the conferenece and in the mathematical press &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathunion.org/fileadmin/IMU/Prizes/Leelavati/LeelavatiPrizeAnnouncement.pdf |title=Press Release: Leelavati Prize for Public Outreach in Mathematics}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the IMU EC decided to turn the prize into a recurring four-yearly award and the award ceremony a regular feature of every ICM closing ceremony.

==The Award==

The Leelavati prize is not intended to reward mathematical research but rather outreach activities in the broadest possible sense. It carries a cash prize of 1,000,000 Indian Rupees together with a citation and is sponsored by [[Infosys]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15657">This article summarizes the classes of [[Discrete space|discrete]] [[symmetry group]]s of the [[Euclidean plane]]. The symmetry groups are named here by three naming schemes: [[Hermann–Mauguin notation|International notation]], [[orbifold notation]], and [[Coxeter notation]].
There are three kinds of symmetry groups of the plane:
*2 families of [[rosette groups]] – 2D [[Point group#Two dimensions|point groups]]
*7 [[frieze group]]s – 2D [[Line group#Two-dimensional|line groups]]
*17 [[wallpaper group]]s – 2D [[space group]]s.

== Rosette groups ==
There are two families of discrete two-dimensional point groups, and they are specified with parameter ''n'', which is the order of the group of the rotations in the group.

== Frieze groups ==
The 7 [[frieze group]]s, the two-dimensional [[line group]]s, with a direction of periodicity are given with five notational names. The [[Schönflies notation]] is given as infinite limits of 7 dihedral groups. The yellow regions represent the infinite fundamental domain in each.

== Wallpaper groups ==
The 17 [[wallpaper group]]s, with finite fundamental domains, are given by [[Hermann–Mauguin notation|International notation]], [[orbifold notation]], and [[Coxeter notation]], classified by the 5 [[Bravais lattice#Bravais lattices in at most 2 dimensions|Bravais lattices]] in the plane: [[Square (geometry)|square]], oblique (parallelogrammatic), hexagonal (equilateral triangular), rectangular (centered rhombic), and rhombic (centered rectangular).

The ''p1'' and ''p2'' groups, with no reflectional symmetry, are repeated in all classes. The related pure reflectional [[Coxeter group]] are given with all classes except oblique.

In [[graph theory]], a '''loop''' (also called a '''self-loop''' or a "buckle") is an [[edge (graph theory)|edge]] that connects a [[vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] to itself. A [[Graph (discrete mathematics)#Simple graph|simple graph]] contains no loops.

Depending on the context, a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] or a [[multigraph]] may be defined so as to either allow or disallow the presence of loops (often in concert with allowing or disallowing [[multiple edges]] between the same vertices):

*Where graphs are defined so as to ''allow'' loops and multiple edges, a graph without loops or multiple edges is often distinguished from other graphs by calling it a "simple graph".
*Where graphs are defined so as to ''disallow'' loops and multiple edges, a graph that does have loops or multiple edges is often distinguished from the graphs that satisfy these constraints by calling it a "multigraph" or "[[pseudograph]]".

In a graph with one vertex, all edges must be loops. Such a graph is called a [[bouquet graph|bouquet]].

==Degree==
For an [[undirected graph]], the [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] of a vertex is equal to the number of [[adjacent vertex|adjacent vertices]].

A special case is a loop, which adds two to the degree.  This can be understood by letting each connection of the loop edge count as its own adjacent vertex.  In other words, a vertex with a loop "sees" itself as an adjacent vertex from ''both'' ends of the edge thus adding two, not one, to the degree.

For a [[directed graph]], a loop adds one to the [[in degree (graph theory)|in degree]] and one to the [[out degree (graph theory)|out degree]].

The '''Maude system''' is an implementation of [[rewriting logic]] developed at [[SRI International]]. It is similar in its general approach to [[Joseph Goguen]]'s [[OBJ3]] implementation of [[equational logic]], but based on rewriting logic rather than [[order-sorted equational logic]], and with a heavy emphasis on powerful [[metaprogramming]] based on [[reflection (computer science)|reflection]].

Maude is free software, and tutorials are available online.

== Elementary Example ==
Maude modules (rewrite theories) consists of a term-language plus sets of equations and rewrite-rules. Terms in a rewrite theory are constructed using operators (functions taking 0 or more arguments of some '''sort''', which return a term of a specific '''sort'''). Operators taking 0 arguments are considered constants, and one constructs their term-language by these simple constructs.

===Example 1===

&lt;pre&gt;
 fmod NAT is
   sort Nat .

   op 0 : -&gt; Nat [ctor] .
   op s : Nat -&gt; Nat [ctor] .
 endfm
&lt;/pre&gt;

This rewrite theory specifies all the natural numbers. The '''sort''' saying is introduced, that there exists a sort called Nat (short for natural numbers), and below is the specification of how these terms are constructed. The operator '''s''' in Example 1 is the successor function representing the next natural number in the sequence of natural numbers i.e. s(N) := N + 1. s(0) is meant to represent the natural number 1 and so on. '''0''' is a constant, it takes no input parameter(s) but returns a '''Nat'''.&lt;!-- If you want to test these examples on your own, you should start Maude with the option -no-prelude which lets Maude know that none of its basic modules are included (like Maude's own NAT module which will cause a conflict). --&gt;
 fmod NAT is
   sort Nat .
 
   op 0 : -&gt; Nat [ctor] .
   op s : Nat -&gt; Nat [ctor] .
   op _+_ : Nat Nat -&gt; Nat .
 
   vars N M : Nat .
 
   eq 0 + N = N .
   eq s(N) + M = s (N + M) .
 
 endfm

In Example 2 the '''+''' sign is introduced, meant to represent addition of natural numbers. Its definition is almost identical to the previous one, with input and output '''sorts''', but there is a difference: its operator has underscores on each side. Maude lets the user specify whether or not operators are infix, postfix or prefix (default), this is done using underscores as place fillers for the input terms. So the + operator takes its input on each side making it an infix operator.  Unlike our previous operator '''s''' which takes its input terms after the operator (prefix).

The three stars are Maude's rest-of-line-comments and lets the parser know that it can ignore the rest of the line (not part of the program), with parenthesis meaning section comments:

 *** rest of line is ignored by Maude
 *** (
 section
 is
 ignored by Maude
 )

The extended '''Nat''' module also holds two variables and two sets of equations.

 vars N M : Nat .
 
 eq 0 + N = N .
 eq s(N) + M = s (N + M) .

When Maude "executes", it rewrites terms according to our specifications. And this is done with the statement

 reduce in &lt;some module&gt; : &lt;some term&gt; .

or the shorter form

 red &lt;some term&gt; .

For this last statement to be used it is important that nothing is ambiguous. A small example from our rewrite theory representing the natural numbers:

 reduce in NAT : s(0) + s(0) .
 rewrites: 2 in 0ms cpu (0ms real) (~ rewrites/second)
 result Nat: s(s(0))

Using the two equations in the rewrite theory '''NAT''' Maude was able to reduce our term into the desired term, the representation of the number two i.e. the second successor of '''0'''. At that point no other application of the two equations were possible, so Maude halts. Maude rewrites terms according to the equations whenever there is a '''match''' between the '''closed terms''' that one tries to rewrite (or reduce) and the '''left hand side''' of an equation in our equation-set. A match in this context is a [[substitution of variables|substitution]] of the variables in the left hand side of an equation which leaves it identical to the term that one tries to rewrite/reduce.

To illustrate it further one can look at the left hand side of the equations as Maude executes, reducing/rewriting the term.

 eq s(N) + M = s (N + M) .

can be applied to the term:

 s(0) + s(0)

since the substitution:

 N =&gt; 0
 M =&gt; s(0)
 
 s(N) + M [[N =&gt; 0, M =&gt; s(0)]] == s(0) + s(0)

makes them identical, and therefore it can be reduced/rewritten using this equation. After this equation has been applied to the term, one is left with the term:

 s (0 + s(0))

If one takes a close look at that term, they will see that it has a fitting substitution with matches the first equation, at least parts of the term matches the first equation:

 eq 0 + N = N .

substitution:

 N =&gt; s(0)
 
 s (0 + N) [[N =&gt; s(0)]] == s (0 + s(0))
 
 0 + s(0) - matches first equation and is rewritten

The second substitution and rewrite step rewrites an inner-term (the whole term does not match any of the equations but the inner term does). Then one ends up with our resulting term '''s(s(0))''', and it can seem like a lot of hassle to add 1 + 1, but hopefully you will soon see the strength of this approach.

Another thing worth mentioning is that reduction/rewriting up to this point has taken something very important for granted, which is:
* Reduction/Rewriting '''terminates'''
* Reduction/Rewriting is '''confluent''' (applying the equations in any order will eventually lead to the same resulting term)

This cannot be taken for granted, and for a rewrite theory to be sane, one has to ensure that equational application is confluent and terminating. To prove that term-rewriting terminates is not possible in every instance, which we know from studying the [[halting problem]]. To be able to prove that term-rewriting (with regards to the equations) terminates, one can usually create some mapping between terms and the natural numbers, and show that application of the equations reduces the associated value of the term. Induction then proves that it is a halting process since the event of finding smaller natural numbers is a halting process. Naturally equation sets that can cause a term-rewrite to contain cycles will not be terminating. To prove confluence is another important aspect since a rewrite theory lacking this ability will be rather flawed. To prove that the equation set is confluent one has to prove that '''any''' application of the equations to any belonging term will lead to the same resulting term (termination is a prerequisite). Details for how to prove termination or confluence will not be given here, it just had to be mentioned, since this is where equations and rewrite-rules differ, which is the next topic of this short overview.

==Rewrite Rules==
Up to this point rewriting and reduction have been more or less the same thing, our first rewrite theory had no rewrite rules, still we rewrote terms, so it is time to illustrate what rewrite rules are, and how they differ from the equations we have seen so far (they do not differ much from equations naturally since we talk about the two concepts almost interchangeably).

The module presented so far '''NAT''' which represented the natural numbers and addition on its elements, is considered a functional module/rewrite theory, since it contains no rewrite rules. Such modules are often encapsuled with a '''fmod''' and '''endfm''' (instead of '''mod''' '''endm''') to illustrate this fact. A functional module and its set of equations must be confluent and terminating since they build up the part of a rewrite theory that always should compute the same result, this will be clear once the rewrite rules come into play.

===Example 3===

&lt;pre&gt;
mod PERSON is

including NAT . *** our previous module

sort Person .
sort State .

op married : -&gt; State [ctor] .
op divorced : -&gt; State [ctor] .
op single : -&gt; State [ctor] .
op engaged : -&gt; State [ctor] .
op dead : -&gt; State [ctor] .

op person : State Nat -&gt; Person [ctor] .

var N : Nat .
var S : State .

rl [birthday] :

person (S, N) =&gt; person (S, N + s(0)) .

rl [get-engaged] :

person (single, N) =&gt; person (engaged, N) .

rl [get-married] :

person (engaged, N) =&gt; person (married, N) .

rl [get-divorced] :

person (married, N) =&gt; person (divorced, N) .

rl [las-vegas] :

person (S, N) =&gt; person (married, N) .

rl [die] :

person (S, N) =&gt; person (dead, N) .

endm
&lt;/pre&gt;

This module introduces two new '''sort'''s, and a set of rewrite rules. We also include our previous module, to illustrate how equations and rewrite rules differ. The rewrite rules is thought of as a set of legal state changes, so while equations hold the same meaning on both sides of the equality sign, rewrite rules do not (rewrite rules use a =&gt; token instead of an equality sign). You are still the same person after you're married (this is open for debate), but something has changed, your marital status at least. So this is illustrated by a rewrite rule, not an equation. Rewrite rules do '''not''' have to be '''confluent''' and '''terminating''' so it does matter a great deal what rules are chosen to rewrite the term. The rules are applied at "random" by the Maude system, meaning that you can not be sure that one rule is applied before another rule and so on. '''If''' an equation can be applied to the term, it will '''always''' be applied '''before''' any rewrite rule.

A small example is in order:

===Example 4===

&lt;pre&gt;
rewrite [3] in PERSON : person (single, 0) .

rewrites: 4 in 0ms cpu (0ms real) (~ rewrites/second)

result Person: person (married, s(0))
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here we tell the Maude system to rewrite our input term according to the rewrite theory, and we tell it to stop after 3 rewrite steps (remember that rewrite rules do not have to be terminating or confluent so an upper bound is not a bad idea), we just want see what sort of state we end up in after randomly choosing 3 '''matching''' rules. And as you can see the state this person ends up in might look a bit strange. (When you're married at the age of one you kind of stick out a bit in kindergarten I guess). It also says 4 rewrite steps, although we specifically stated an upper limit of 3 rewrite steps, this is because rewrite steps that are the result of applying equations does not count (they do not change the term, at least if the equations are sane). In this example one of the equations of the NAT module has been used to reduce the term '''0 + s(0)''' to '''s(0)''', which accounts for the 4'th rewrite step.

To make this rewrite theory a bit less morbid, we can alter some of our rewrite rules a bit, and make them '''conditional''' rewrite rules, which basically means they have to fulfill some criteria to be applied to the term (other than just matching the left hand side of the rewrite rule).

&lt;pre&gt;
crl [las-vegas] :

person (S, N) =&gt; person (married, N) if (S =/= married) /\ (S =/= dead) .

crl [die] :

person (S, N) =&gt; person (dead, N) if (S =/= dead) .
&lt;/pre&gt;

It seems reasonable that you cannot die once you're dead, and you cannot marry as long as you are married. The leaning toothpicks ('''/\''') are supposed to resemble a logical '''AND''' which means that both criteria have to be fulfilled to be able to apply the rule (apart from term matching). '''Equations''' can also be made conditional in a similar manner.

===Why Rewriting Logic? Why Maude?===

Maude sets out to solve a different set of problems than ordinary imperative languages like C, Java or Perl. It is a formal reasoning tool, which can help us verify that things are "as they should", and show us why they are not if this is the case. In other words, Maude lets us define formally what we mean by some concept in a very abstract manner (not concerning ourselves with how the structure is internally represented and so on), but we can describe what is thought to be the equal concerning our theory ('''equations''') and what state changes it can go through ('''rewrite rules'''). This is extremely useful to validate security protocols and critical code. The Maude system has proved flaws in cryptography protocols by just specifying what the system can do (in a manner similar to the PERSON rewrite theory), and by looking for unwanted situations (states or terms that should not be possible to reach) the protocol can be shown to contain bugs, not programming bugs but situations happen that are hard to predict just by walking down the "happy path" as most developers do.

We can use Maude's built-in search to look for unwanted states, or it can be used to show that no such states can be reached.

A small example from our PERSON module once again.

&lt;pre&gt;
search [1] in PERSON : person (single, 1) =&gt;1 person (married, 2) .

No solution.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here the Natural numbers have a more familiar look (the basic Maude modules prelude.maude has been loaded, that can be done with the command "'''in prelude'''", or 1 can be replaced by s(0) and 2 by s(s(0)) if you don't want to load the default Maude-modules), naturally Maude has built-in support for ordinary structures like integers and floats and so on. The natural numbers are still members of the built-in '''sort''' Nat. We state that we want to search for a transition using one rewrite rule (=&gt;1), which rewrites the first term into the other. The result of the investigation is not shocking but still, sometimes proving the obvious is all we can do. If we let Maude use more than one step we should see a different result:

&lt;pre&gt;
search [1] in PERSON : person (single, 1) =&gt;+ person (married, 2) .

Solution 1 (state 7)
states: 8 rewrites: 14 in 0ms cpu (0ms real) (~ rewrites/second)
&lt;/pre&gt;

To see what led us in that direction we can use the built in command '''show path''' which lets us know what rule applications led us to the resulting term. The token (=&gt;+) means one or more rule application.

&lt;pre&gt;
show path 7 .
state 0, Person: person (single, 1)
===[[rl person(S, N) =&gt; person(S, N + 1) [label 'birthday]] .]
===&gt;
state 1, Person: person (single, 2)
===[[crl person(S, N) =&gt; person(married, N) if S =/= married = true /\ S =/= dead = true [label las-vegas]] .]
===&gt;
state 7, Person: person (married, 2)
&lt;/pre&gt;

As we can see the rule application "birthday" followed by "las-vegas" got us where we wanted. Since all rewrite theories or modules with many possible rule applications will generate a huge tree of possible states to search for with the '''search''' command, this approach is not always the solution. We also have the ability to control what rule applications should be attempted at each step using [[Metaprogramming|meta-programming]], due to the reflective property or rewriting logic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3886">'''Moritz Pasch''' (8 November 1843, [[Breslau]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] (now [[Wrocław]], [[Poland]]) &amp;ndash; 20 September 1930, [[Bad Homburg]], [[Weimar Germany|Germany]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]] of [[Jewish]] ancestry&lt;ref&gt;Dirk Schlimm, "The correspondence between Moritz Pasch and Felix Klein" in ''[[Historia Mathematica]]'' Volume 40, Issue 2, May 2013, Page 186&lt;/ref&gt; specializing in the foundations of [[geometry]]. He completed his Ph.D. at the [[University of Breslau]] at only 22 years of age. He taught at the [[University of Giessen]], where he is known to have supervised 30 doctorates.

In 1882, Pasch published a book, ''Vorlesungen über neuere Geometrie'', calling for the grounding of Euclidean geometry in more precise [[primitive notion]]s and [[axiom]]s, and for greater care in the deductive methods employed to develop the subject. He drew attention to a number of heretofore unnoted tacit assumptions in Euclid's ''[[Euclid's elements|Elements]]''. He then argued that mathematical reasoning should not invoke the physical interpretation of the primitive terms, but should instead rely solely on formal manipulations justified by axioms. This book is the point of departure for:
*Similarly concerned Italians: [[Peano]], [[Mario Pieri]], [[Alessandro Padoa]]
*[[David Hilbert|Hilbert]]'s work on geometry and mathematical axiomatics in general;
*All modern thinking about the foundations of [[Euclidean geometry]].

Pasch is perhaps best remembered for [[Pasch's axiom]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Given three noncollinear points ''a, b, c'' and a line ''X'' not containing any of these points, if ''X'' includes a point between ''a'' and ''b'', then ''X'' also includes one and only one of the following: a point between ''a'' and ''c'', or a point between ''b'' and ''c''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, if a line crosses one side of a triangle, that line must also cross one of the two remaining sides of the same triangle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11307">'''Multiple representations''' are ways to symbolize, to describe and to refer to the same mathematical entity. They are used to understand, to develop, and to communicate different mathematical features of the same object or operation, as well as connections between different properties. Multiple representations include graphs and [[diagram]]s, tables and grids, formulas, [[Math symbol|symbols]], words, gestures, software code, videos, concrete models, physical and virtual manipulatives, pictures, and sounds. Representations are thinking tools for doing mathematics.

== Higher-order thinking ==
The use of multiple representations supports and requires tasks that involve decision-making and other problem-solving skills.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth"&gt;S. Ainsworth, P. Bibby, and D. Wood, "Information technology and multiple representations: New opportunities – new problems," Journal of Information Technology for Teacher Education 6, no. 1 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moseley"&gt;B. Moseley and M. Brenner, Using Multiple Representations for Conceptual Change in Pre-algebra: A Comparison of Variable Usage with Graphic and Text Based Problems., 1997, http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/contentdelivery/servlet/ERICServlet?accno=ED413184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pictorial"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pictorialmath.com/updates_downloads/PresenterGuide.ppt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715083105/http://www.pictorialmath.com/updates_downloads/PresenterGuide.ppt |archivedate=2011-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of which representation to use, the task of making representations given other representations, and the understanding of how changes in one representation affect others are examples of such mathematically sophisticated activities. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Estimation, another complex task, can strongly benefit from multiple representations &lt;ref&gt;http://continuities.wordpress.com/2010/04/25/sharing-multiple-representations-of-systems&lt;/ref&gt;

Curricula that support starting from conceptual understanding, then developing procedural fluency, for example, AIMS Foundation Activities,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c5SunC5Lbs&lt;/ref&gt; frequently use multiple representations.

Supporting student use of multiple representations may lead to more open-ended problems, or at least accepting multiple methods of solutions and forms of answers. Project-based learning units, such as [[WebQuest]]s, typically call for several representations. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} {{free rubux}}

== Motivation ==
Some representations, such as pictures, videos and manipulatives, can motivate because of their richness, possibilities of play, technologies involved, or connections with interesting areas of life.&lt;ref name="pictorial"/&gt; Tasks that involve multiple representations can sustain intrinsic motivation in mathematics by supporting higher-order thinking and problem solving.

Multiple representations may also remove some of the gender biases that exist in math classrooms.  Explaining probability solely and only through baseball statistics may potentially alienate students who have no interest in sports.  When showing a tie to real-life applications, teachers should choose representations that are varied and of interest to all genders and cultures.

== Assessment ==
Tasks that involve construction, use, and interpretation of multiple representations can lend themselves to rubric assessment &lt;ref&gt;http://www.losmedanos.edu/deved/documents/m25_student_work.multiple_representations_000.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and to other assessment types suitable for open-ended activities.  For example, tapping into visualization for math problem solving manifests multiple representations.  These multiple representations arise when each student uses their knowledge base, and experience to create a visualization of the problem domain on the way toward a solution.  Since visualization can be categorized into two main areas, schematic or pictorial,&lt;ref&gt;Hegarty, M., and Kozhevnikov, M. (1999).  Types of Visual-Spatial Representations and Mathematical Problem Solving. Journal of Educational Psychology v91, no 4 p.684 – 689.&lt;/ref&gt; most students will provide on or the other or sometimes both methods to represent the problem domain.

Comparison of the different visualization tools created by each student is an excellent example of multiple representations.  Further, the instructor may glean from these examples elements which they incorporate into their grading rubric.  In this way, it is the students that provide the examples and standards against which scoring is done.  This crucial factor places each student on equal footing and links them directly with their performance in class.

== Special education and differentiated instruction ==
Students with special needs may be weaker in their use of some of the representations. For these students, it may be especially important to use multiple representations for two purposes. First, including representations that currently work well for the student ensures the understanding of the current mathematical topic. Second, connections among multiple representations within the same topic strengthens overall skills in using all representations, even those currently problematic.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth"/&gt;

It is also helpful to ESL/ELL (English as a Second Language/English Language Learners) to use multiple representations. The more you can bring a concept to "life" in a visual way, the more likely the students will grasp what you are talking about. This is also important with younger students who may have not had a lot of experience/prior knowledge on the topics we are teaching.

Using multiple representations can help differentiate instruction by addressing different [[learning styles]],.&lt;ref name="pictorial"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Schultz and M. Waters, "Why Representations?" Mathematics Teacher 93, no. 6 (2000): 448–53&lt;/ref&gt;

== Qualitative and quantitative reasoning ==
Visual representations, manipulatives, gestures, and to some degree grids, can support qualitative reasoning about mathematics. Instead of only emphasizing computational skills, multiple representations can help students make the conceptual shift to the meaning and use of, and to develop algebraic thinking. By focusing more on the conceptual representations of algebraic problems students will become more capable problem solvers.&lt;ref name="Moseley"/&gt;

== NCTM representations standard ==
National Council of Teachers of Mathematics has a standard dealing with multiple representations. In part, it reads &lt;ref&gt;http://standards.nctm.org/document/chapter6/rep.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 
"Instructional programs should enable all students to do the following:
* Create and use representations to organize, record, and communicate mathematical ideas
* Select, apply, and translate among mathematical representations to solve problems
* Use representations to model and interpret physical, social, and mathematical phenomena"

== Four most frequent school mathematics representations ==
While there are many representations used in mathematics, the secondary curricula heavily favor numbers (often in tables), formulas, graphs and words.&lt;ref&gt;http://ctlonline.org/blog/?p=357&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systems of manipulatives ==
Several curricula use extensively developed systems of manipulatives and the corresponding representations. For example, Cuisinaire rods,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etacuisenaire.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Montessori beads {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}, and Algebra Tiles &lt;ref&gt;http://www.howtolord.com/learn-algebra-fast/&lt;/ref&gt;, Base-10 blocks, counters

== Use of technology ==
Use of computer tools to create and to share mathematical representations opens several possibilities. It allows to link multiple representations dynamically. For example, changing a formula can instantly change the graph, the table of values, and the text read-out for the function represented in all these ways. Technology use can increase accuracy and speed of data collection and allow real-time visualization and experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;http://demirus.com/2010/06/10/math-textbooks-in-the-future/&lt;/ref&gt; It also supports collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ioste2008.org/109/how-can-instructional-technology-make-teaching-and-learning-more-effective-in-the-schools |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20100725123052/http://www.ioste2008.org/109/how-can-instructional-technology-make-teaching-and-learning-more-effective-in-the-schools |archivedate=2010-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer tools may be intrinsically interesting and motivating to students, and provide a familiar and comforting context students already use in their daily life.

[[Spreadsheet]] software such as [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]], [[OpenOffice.org]], [[Google Docs|Google Documents]], is widely used in many industries, and showing students the use of applications can make math more realistic. Most spreadsheet programs provide dynamic links among formulas, grids and several types of graphs.

[http://www.carnegielearning.com/ Carnegie Learning] curriculum is an example of emphasis on 
multiple representations and use of computer tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carnegielearning.com/secondary-curricula/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702220044/http://www.carnegielearning.com/secondary-curricula/ |archivedate=2010-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, Carnegie learning focuses the student not only on solving the real life scenarios presented in the text, but also promotes literacy through sentence writing and explanations of student thinking. In conjunction with the scenario based text Carnegie Learning provides a web based tutoring program called the "Cognitive Tutor" which uses data collected from each question a student answers to direct the student to areas where they need more help.

[[GeoGebra]] is free software dynamically linking geometric constructions, graphs, formulas, and grids.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geogebra.org/cms/en/info&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used in a browser and is light enough for older or low-end computers.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hohenwarter and J. Preiner, "Dynamic mathematics with GeoGebra," Journal of Online Mathematics and its Applications 7 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Project Interactivate &lt;ref&gt;http://www.shodor.org/interactivate/activities/&lt;/ref&gt; has many activities linking visual, verbal and numeric representations. There are currently 159 different activities available, in many areas of math, including numbers and operations, probability, geometry, algebra, statistics and modeling.

Another helpful tool for mathematicians, scientists, engineers is [[LaTeX]]. It is a typsetting program that allows you to create tables, figures, graphs etc. in order to give a precise visual of the problem being worked on. 

== Concerns ==
There are concerns that technology for working with multiple representations can become a distraction from mathematical content, and an end in itself {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}.

Care should be taken that informal representations do not prevent students from progressing toward formal, symbolic mathematics {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}.

      <comment>/* Metric and volume element on the Poincaré plane */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9076">In [[mathematics]], the '''Poincaré metric''', named after [[Henri Poincaré]], is the [[metric tensor]] describing a two-dimensional surface of constant negative [[curvature]]. It is the natural metric commonly used in a variety of calculations in [[hyperbolic geometry]] or [[Riemann surface]]s.

There are three equivalent representations commonly used in two-dimensional hyperbolic [[geometry]]. One is the [[Poincaré half-plane model]], defining a model of hyperbolic space on the [[upper half-plane]]. The [[Poincaré disk model]] defines a model for hyperbolic space on the [[unit disk]]. The disk and the upper half plane are related by a [[conformal map]], and [[isometry|isometries]] are given by [[Möbius transformation]]s.  A third representation is on the [[punctured disk]], where relations for [[q-analog]]ues are sometimes expressed.  These various forms are reviewed below.

==Overview of metrics on Riemann surfaces==
{{main|metric tensor}}
A metric on the complex plane may be generally expressed in the form

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2=\lambda^2(z,\overline{z})\, dz\,d\overline{z}&lt;/math&gt;

where &amp;lambda; is a real, positive function of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{z}&lt;/math&gt;. The length of a curve &amp;gamma; in the complex plane is thus given by 
:&lt;math&gt;l(\gamma)=\int_\gamma \lambda(z,\overline{z})\, |dz|&lt;/math&gt;

The area of a subset of the complex plane is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Area}(M)=\int_M \lambda^2 (z,\overline{z})\,\frac{i}{2}\,dz \wedge d\overline{z}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; is the [[exterior product]] used to construct the [[volume form]].  The determinant of the metric is equal to &lt;math&gt;\lambda^4&lt;/math&gt;, so the square root of the determinant is &lt;math&gt;\lambda^2&lt;/math&gt;. The Euclidean volume form on the plane is &lt;math&gt;dx\wedge dy&lt;/math&gt; and so one has

:&lt;math&gt;dz \wedge d\overline{z}=(dx+i\,dy)\wedge (dx-i \, dy)= -2i\,dx\wedge dy.&lt;/math&gt;

A function &lt;math&gt;\Phi(z,\overline{z})&lt;/math&gt; is said to be the '''potential of the metric''' if

:&lt;math&gt;4\frac{\partial}{\partial z} 
\frac{\partial}{\partial \overline{z}} \Phi(z,\overline{z})=\lambda^2(z,\overline{z}).&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Laplace–Beltrami operator]] is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta = \frac{4}{\lambda^2} 
\frac {\partial}{\partial z} 
\frac {\partial}{\partial \overline{z}}
= \frac{1}{\lambda^2} \left(
\frac {\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + 
\frac {\partial^2}{\partial y^2}
\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The Gaussian [[curvature]] of the metric is given by

:&lt;math&gt;K=-\Delta \log \lambda.\,&lt;/math&gt;

This curvature is one-half of the [[Ricci scalar curvature]].

Isometries preserve angles and arc-lengths.  On Riemann surfaces, isometries are identical to changes of coordinate: that is, both the Laplace–Beltrami operator and the curvature are invariant under isometries. Thus, for example, let ''S'' be a Riemann surface with metric &lt;math&gt;\lambda^2(z,\overline{z})\, dz \, d\overline{z}&lt;/math&gt; and ''T'' be a Riemann surface with metric &lt;math&gt;\mu^2(w,\overline{w})\, dw\,d\overline{w}&lt;/math&gt;.  Then a map

:&lt;math&gt;f:S\to T\,&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;f=w(z)&lt;/math&gt; is an isometry if and only if it is conformal and if

:&lt;math&gt;\mu^2(w,\overline{w}) \;
\frac {\partial w}{\partial z}
\frac {\partial \overline {w}} {\partial \overline {z}} = 
\lambda^2 (z, \overline {z})
&lt;/math&gt;.

Here, the requirement that the map is conformal is nothing more than the statement

:&lt;math&gt;w(z,\overline{z})=w(z),&lt;/math&gt;

that is,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial \overline{z}} w(z) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

==Metric and volume element on the Poincaré plane==
The '''Poincaré metric tensor''' in the [[Poincaré half-plane model]] is given on the [[upper half-plane]] '''H''' as

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2=\frac{dx^2+dy^2}{y^2}=\frac{dz \, d\overline{z}}{y^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where we write &lt;math&gt;dz=dx+i\,dy.&lt;/math&gt;
This metric tensor is invariant under the action of [[SL2(R)|SL(2,'''R''')]].  That is, if we write

:&lt;math&gt;z'=x'+iy'=\frac{az+b}{cz+d}&lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;ad-bc=1&lt;/math&gt; then we can work out that

:&lt;math&gt;x'=\frac{ac(x^2+y^2)+x(ad+bc)+bd}{|cz+d|^2}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;y'=\frac{y}{|cz+d|^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The infinitesimal transforms as

:&lt;math&gt;dz'=\frac{dz}{(cz+d)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

and so

:&lt;math&gt;dz'd\overline{z}' = \frac{dz\,d\overline{z}}{|cz+d|^4}&lt;/math&gt;

thus making it clear that the metric tensor is invariant under SL(2,'''R''').

The invariant [[volume element]] is given by

:&lt;math&gt;d\mu=\frac{dx\,dy}{y^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The metric is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\rho(z_1,z_2)=2\tanh^{-1}\frac{|z_1-z_2|}{|z_1-\overline{z_2}|}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\rho(z_1,z_2)=\log\frac{|z_1-\overline{z_2}|+|z_1-z_2|}{|z_1-\overline{z_2}|-|z_1-z_2|}&lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;z_1,z_2 \in \H.&lt;/math&gt;

Another interesting form of the metric can be given in terms of the '''[[cross-ratio]]'''. Given any four points &lt;math&gt;z_1, z_2, z_3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z_4&lt;/math&gt; in the [[Riemann sphere|compactified complex plane]] &lt;math&gt;\hat{\C} = \C \cup \{\infty\},&lt;/math&gt; the cross-ratio is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;(z_1, z_2; z_3, z_4) =  \frac{(z_1-z_3)(z_2-z_4)}{(z_1-z_4)(z_2-z_3)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then the metric is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \rho(z_1,z_2)= \log \left (z_1, z_2; z_1^\times, z_2^\times \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;z_1^\times&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z_2^\times&lt;/math&gt; are the endpoints, on the real number line, of the geodesic joining &lt;math&gt;z_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z_2&lt;/math&gt;. These are numbered so that  &lt;math&gt;z_1&lt;/math&gt; lies in between &lt;math&gt;z_1^\times&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z_2&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[geodesics]] for this metric tensor are circular arcs perpendicular to the real axis (half-circles whose origin is on the real axis) and straight vertical lines ending on the real axis.

==Conformal map of plane to disk==
The upper half plane can be [[conformal map|mapped conformally]] to the [[unit disc|unit disk]] with the [[Möbius transformation]]

:&lt;math&gt;w=e^{i\phi}\frac{z-z_0}{z-\overline {z_0}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''w'' is the point on the unit disk that corresponds to the point ''z'' in the upper half plane.  In this mapping, the constant ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; can be any point in the upper half plane; it will be mapped to the center of the disk. The real axis &lt;math&gt;\Im z =0&lt;/math&gt; maps to the edge of the unit disk &lt;math&gt;|w|=1.&lt;/math&gt; The constant real number &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; can be used to rotate the disk by an arbitrary fixed amount.

The canonical mapping is

:&lt;math&gt;w=\frac{iz+1}{z+i}&lt;/math&gt;

which takes ''i'' to the center of the disk, and ''0'' to the bottom of the disk.

==Metric and volume element on the Poincaré disk==
The '''Poincaré metric tensor''' in the [[Poincaré disk model]] is given on the open [[unit disk]] 

:&lt;math&gt;U= \left \{z=x+iy:|z|=\sqrt{x^2+y^2} &lt; 1 \right \}&lt;/math&gt; 

by

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2=\frac{4(dx^2+dy^2)}{(1-(x^2+y^2))^2}=\frac{4 dz\,d\overline{z}}{(1-|z|^2)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The volume element is given by

:&lt;math&gt;d\mu=\frac{4 dx\,dy}{(1-(x^2+y^2))^2}=\frac{4 dx\,dy}{(1-|z|^2)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The Poincaré metric is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\rho(z_1,z_2)=2\tanh^{-1}\left|\frac{z_1-z_2}{1-z_1\overline{z_2}}\right|&lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;z_1,z_2 \in U.&lt;/math&gt;

The geodesics for this metric tensor are circular arcs whose endpoints are orthogonal to the boundary of the disk.

==The punctured disk model==
[[File:J-inv-modulus.jpeg|thumb|J-invariant in punctured disk coordinates; that is, as a function of the nome.]]
[[File:J-inv-poincare.jpeg|thumb|J-invariant in Poincare disk coordinates; note this disk is rotated by 90 degrees from canonical coordinates given  in this article]]

A second common mapping of the [[upper half-plane]] to a disk is the [[q-analog|q-mapping]]

:&lt;math&gt;q=\exp(i\pi\tau)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''q'' is the [[nome (mathematics)|nome]] and &amp;tau; is the [[half-period ratio]]:
:&lt;math&gt; \tau = \frac{\omega_2}{\omega_1} &lt;/math&gt; .
In the notation of the previous sections, &amp;tau; is the coordinate in the upper half-plane &lt;math&gt;\Im \tau &gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. The mapping is to the punctured disk, because the value ''q''=0 is not in the [[codomain|image]] of the map.

The Poincaré metric on the upper half-plane induces a metric on the q-disk

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2=\frac{4}{|q|^2 (\log |q|^2)^2} dq \, d\overline{q}&lt;/math&gt;

The potential of the metric is

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi(q,\overline{q})=4 \log \log |q|^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;

==Schwarz lemma==
The Poincaré metric is [[contraction mapping|distance-decreasing]] on [[laplace operator|harmonic]] functions. This is an extension of the [[Schwarz lemma]], called the [[Schwarz–Ahlfors–Pick theorem]].

In the [[Unified Modeling Language]] 1.x, '''powertype''' is a [[keyword (computer programming)|keyword]] for a specific UML [[Stereotype (UML)|stereotype]], and  applies to a [[class (computer science)|class]] or [[dependency (UML)|dependency]].  '''Powertype''' shows a [[classifier (UML)|classifier]] whose [[Instance (computer science)|instances]] ([[object (computer science)|object]]s) are [[children]] of the given [[parent]].

In UML 2.x, a powertype is a [[metaclass]] whose instances are subclasses of a given class. The stereotype has been removed and the powertype is now indicated by typing the generalization set.

In the UML Superstructure 2.4.1 Specification Document &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/2.4.1 |title=OMG Unified Modeling Language (OMG UML), Superstructure. Version 2.4.1 |publisher=Object Management Group |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; the following definition is given:

{{quotation | 
The notion of power type was inspired by the notion of power set. A power set is defined as a set whose instances are
subsets. In essence, then, a power type is a class whose instances are subclasses. }}

[[Primality test]]s show that

: ''p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''# &amp;minus; 1 is prime for ''n'' = 2, 3, 5, 6, 13, 24, ... {{OEIS|id=A057704}}
: ''p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''# + 1 is prime for ''n'' = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, ... {{OEIS|id=A014545}}

The first term of the second sequence is 0, because ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;# =  1 is the [[empty product]], and thus ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;# + 1 = 2, which is prime. Similarly, the first term of the first sequence is not 1, as ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;# = 2, and 2 − 1 = 1 is not prime.

The first few primorial primes are

:[[2 (number)|2]], [[3 (number)|3]], [[5 (number)|5]], [[7 (number)|7]], [[29 (number)|29]], [[31 (number)|31]], [[211 (number)|211]], 2309, 2311, 30029, 200560490131, 304250263527209, 23768741896345550770650537601358309 {{OEIS|id=A228486}}

{{As of|2018|3|url=http://primes.utm.edu/top20/page.php?id=5}}, the largest known primorial prime is 1098133#&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 (''n'' = 85586) with 476,311 digits, found by the [[PrimeGrid]] project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.primegrid.com/forum_thread.php?id=4146#51000 Primegrid.com]; forum announcement, 2 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, Chris K., [http://primes.utm.edu/top20/page.php?id=5 The Top Twenty: Primorial] (the [[Prime Pages]])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Euclid]]'s [[proof (math)|proof]] of the [[infinitude of the prime numbers]] is commonly misinterpreted as defining the primorial primes, in the following manner:&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hardy and Catherine Woodgold, "Prime Simplicity", ''[[Mathematical Intelligencer]]'', volume 31, number 4, fall 2009, pages 44&amp;ndash;52.&lt;/ref&gt;

: Assume that the first ''n'' consecutive primes including 2 are the only primes that exist. If either ''p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''#&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 or ''p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''#&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 is a primorial prime, it means that there are larger primes than the ''n''th prime (if neither is a prime, that also proves the infinitude of primes, but less directly; each of these two numbers has a remainder of either ''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 or 1 when divided by any of the first ''n'' primes, and hence all its prime factors are larger than ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7932">[[File:Rabatment rectangle.png|thumb|The dotted line represents one of two possible rabatments of the rectangle]]

'''Rabatment of the rectangle''' is a compositional technique used as an aid for the placement of objects or the division of space within a rectangular frame, or as an aid for the study of art.

Every rectangle contains two implied squares, each consisting of a short side of the rectangle, an equal length along each longer side, and an imaginary fourth line parallel to the short side. The process of mentally rotating the short sides onto the long ones is called "rabatment", and often the imaginary fourth line is called "the rabatment".

Also known as '''rebatement''' and '''rabattement''', ''rabatment'' means the rotation of a plane into another plane about their line of intersection, as in closing an open hinge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Oxford English Dictionary |year=2003 |edition=2 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In two dimensions, it means to rotate a line about a point until the line coincides with another sharing the same point. The term is used in geometry, art and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Paynter |first=J.E. |title=Practical geometry for builders and architects |year=1921 |location=London |publisher=[[Chapman &amp; Hall]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
There is no absolute explanation of the mechanism of this method, but there are various theories.&lt;ref name=Mize2009/&gt; One argument is that squares are such a simple, primal geometric shape that the brain automatically looks for them, mentally completing this rabatment whether it is made explicit or not. When a composition uses elements of the scene to match, the square feels complete in itself, producing a feeling of harmony.&lt;ref name=Mize2009/&gt;

==Practice==
[[File:Rabatment animation.gif|thumb|Animation of a rabatment line within a rectangle]]
[[Renaissance]] artists used rabatment as a foundation to art and architectural works,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZZjk2PCBrj8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA122 |page=122 |first1=Bharath |last1=Sriraman |first2=Viktor |last2=Freiman |first3=Nicole |last3=Lirette-Pitre |title=Interdisciplinarity, creativity, and learning: mathematics with literature, paradoxes, history, technology, and modeling |publisher=IAP |year=2009 |isbn=1-60752-101-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.math.umt.edu/TMME/vol3no2/TMMEvol3no2_Montana_pp157_175.pdf |last=Fett |first=Birch |title=An In-depth Investigation of the Divine Ratio |publisher=The Montana Council of Teachers of Mathematics |year=2006 |journal=The Montana Mathematics Enthusiast |issn=1551-3440 |volume=3 |number=2 |pages=157–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the rabatment can be observed in art taken from almost any period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The painter's secret geometry: a study of composition in art |last=Bouleau |first=Charles |pages=43–46 |publisher=Harcourt, Brace |year=1963 |location=New York |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As one of many composition techniques, rabatment of the rectangle can be used to inform the positioning of elements within the rectangle. There is no hard and fast rule regarding such positioning; a composition can have a sense of dynamic unrest or a sense of equilibrium relative to important lines such as ones taken from rabatment or from the rule of thirds, or from nodal points such as the "eyes of a rectangle"—the four intersections derived from the rule of thirds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.giotto.us/vasari/feltus/composition.html |last=Feltus |first=Alan |title=Painting and Composition |publisher=International School of Painting, Drawing, and Sculpture |location=Umbria, Italy |accessdate=26 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary image elements can be positioned within one of the two rabatment squares to define the center of interest, and secondary image elements can be placed outside of a rabatment square.&lt;ref name=Mize2008&gt;{{cite web |url=http://visualcomposing.blogspot.com/2008/07/placing-our-images-rabatment.html |title=Placing Our Images: Rabatment |last=Mize |first=Dianne |work=Compose |date=16 July 2008 |accessdate=27 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of rabatment can be applied to rectangles of any proportion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FnvsAAAAMAAJ |title=Composing your paintings |last=Dunstan |first=Bernard |pages=22, 26 |publisher=Taplinger Publishing |year=1979 |isbn=0-8008-1803-2 |series=Start To Paint}}&lt;/ref&gt; For rectangles with a 3:2 ratio (as in [[135 film|35mm film]] in still photography), it happens that the rabatment lines are exactly matched to the [[rule of thirds]] lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.watercoloristsofwhatcom.com/glossary.html |title=Glossary |publisher=Watercolorists of Whatcom |last=Brown |first=Scott |year=2009 |accessdate=27 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a horizontally-aligned rectangle, there is one implied square for the left side and one for the right; for a vertically-aligned rectangle, there are upper and lower squares.&lt;ref name=Mize2009&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emptyeasel.com/2009/01/27/how-to-use-rabatment-in-your-compositions/ |title=How to Use Rabatment in Your Compositions |last=Mize |first=Dianne |work=Empty Easel |date=27 January 2009 |accessdate=26 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the long sides of the rectangle are exactly twice the length of the short, this line is right in the middle. With longer-proportioned rectangles, the squares don't overlap, but with shorter-proportioned ones, they do. In [[Western culture]]s that read left to right, attention is often focused inside the left-hand rabatment, or on the line it forms at the right-hand side of the image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.explore-drawing-and-painting.com/composition-art.html |title=Composition in art: Rabatment |publisher=Explore-Drawing-and-Painting.com |last=Nelson |first=Connie |year=2010 |accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When rabatment is used with one side of a [[golden rectangle]], and then iteratively applied to the left-over rectangle, the resulting "whirling rectangles" describe the [[golden spiral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Fairbanks |first1=Avard T. |last2=Fairbanks |first2=Eugene F. |title=Human Proportions for Artists |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RacMqZ-sCDQC&amp;pg=PA210 210] |publisher=Fairbanks Art and Books |year=2005 |isbn=0-9725841-1-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3282">A '''random ''r''-regular graph''' is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] selected from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}_{n,r}&lt;/math&gt;, which denotes the probability space of all [[regular graph|''r''-regular graphs]] on ''n'' vertices, where 3 ≤ ''r'' &lt; ''n'' and ''nr'' is even.&lt;ref&gt;[[Béla Bollobás]], ''Random Graphs'', 2nd edition,  Cambridge University Press (2001), section 2.4: Random Regular Graphs&lt;/ref&gt;  It is therefore a particular kind of [[random graph]], but the regularity restriction significantly alters the properties that will hold, since most graphs are not regular.

==Properties of random regular graphs==
As with more general [[random graph]]s, it is possible to prove that certain properties of random ''r''-regular graphs hold [[Almost surely|asymptotically almost surely]].  In particular, for &lt;math&gt; r \ge 3 &lt;/math&gt;, a random ''r''-regular graph of large size is asymptotically almost surely [[connectivity (graph theory)|''r''-connected]].&lt;ref&gt;Bollobás, section 7.6: Random Regular Graphs&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, although ''r''-regular graphs with connectivity less than ''r'' exist, the probability of selecting such a graph tends to 0 as ''n'' increases. 

If &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; &gt; 0 is a positive constant, and ''d'' is the least integer satisfying

&lt;math&gt;(r-1)^{d-1} \ge (2 + \epsilon)rn \ln n&lt;/math&gt;

then, asymptotically almost surely, a random ''r''-regular graph has [[diameter (graph theory)|diameter]] at most ''d''.  There is also a (more complex) lower bound on the diameter of ''r''-regular graphs, so that almost all ''r''-regular graphs (of the same size) have almost the same diameter.&lt;ref&gt;Bollobás, section 10.3: The Diameter of Random Regular Graphs&lt;/ref&gt;

The distribution of the number of short cycles is also known: for fixed ''m'' ≥ 3, let ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,''Y''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;,…,''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; be the number of cycles of lengths up to ''m''.  Then the ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are asymptotically independent Poisson random variables with means&lt;ref&gt;Bollobás, section 2.4: Random Regular Graphs (Corollary 2.19)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\lambda_i=\frac{(r-1)^i}{2i}&lt;/math&gt;

==Algorithms for random regular graphs==
It is non-trivial to implement the random selection of ''r''-regular graphs efficiently and in an unbiased way, since most graphs are not regular.  The ''pairing model'' (also ''configuration model'') is a method which takes ''nr'' points, and partitions them into ''n'' buckets with ''r'' points in each of them.  Taking a random matching of the ''nr'' points, and then contracting the ''r'' points in each bucket into a single vertex, yields an ''r''-regular graph or [[multigraph]].  If this object has no multiple edges or loops (i.e. it is a graph), then it is the required result.  If not, a restart is required.&lt;ref&gt;N. Wormald, "Models of Random Regular Graphs," in ''Surveys in Combinatorics'', Cambridge University Press (1999), pp 239-298&lt;/ref&gt;

A refinement of this method was developed by [[Brendan McKay]] and Nicholas Wormald.&lt;ref&gt;B. McKay and N. Wormald, "Uniform Generation of Random Regular Graphs of Moderate Degree," ''Journal of Algorithms'', Vol. 11 (1990), pp 52-67: [http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/papers/RandRegGen.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4559">A '''Room square''', named after [[Thomas Gerald Room]], is an ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''n'' array filled with ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 different symbols in such a way that:
# Each cell of the array is either empty or contains an unordered pair from the set of symbols
# Each symbol occurs exactly once in each row and column of the array
# Every unordered pair of symbols occurs in exactly one cell of the array.

An example, a Room square of order seven, if the set of symbols is integers from 0 to 7:

It is known that a Room square (or squares) exist if and only if ''n'' is odd but not 3 or 5.

==History==
The order-7 Room square was used by [[Robert Richard Anstice]] to provide additional solutions to [[Kirkman's schoolgirl problem]] in the mid-19th century, and Anstice also constructed an infinite family of Room squares, but his constructions did not attract attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Anstice|title=Robert Anstice}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Gerald Room]] reinvented Room squares in a note published in 1955,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | journal = Mathematical Gazette
 | page = 307
 | title = A new type of magic square
 | volume = 39
 | year = 1955}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and they came to be named after him. In his original paper on the subject, Room observed that ''n'' must be odd and unequal to 3 or 5, but it was not shown that these conditions are both necessary and sufficient until the work of W. D. Wallis in 1973.&lt;ref name="hw"&gt;{{citation

==Applications==
Pre-dating Room's paper, Room squares had been used by the directors of [[duplicate bridge]] tournaments in the construction of the tournaments. In this application they are known as Howell rotations. The columns of the square represent tables, each of which holds a deal of the cards that is played by each pair of teams that meet at that table. The rows of the square represent rounds of the tournament, and the numbers within the cells of the square represent the teams that are scheduled to play each other at the table and round represented by that cell.

Archbold and Johnson used Room squares to construct experimental designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Archbold|Johnson|1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are connections between Room squares and other mathematical objects including [[quasigroup]]s, [[Latin square]]s, [[graph factorization]]s, and [[Steiner system##Steiner triple system|Steiner triple systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wallis|Street|Wallis|1972|loc=pg. 33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''sequence''' is an enumerated collection of objects in which repetitions are allowed.  Like a [[Set (mathematics)|set]], it contains [[Element (mathematics)|members]] (also called ''elements'', or ''terms'').  The number of elements (possibly infinite) is called the ''length'' of the sequence.  Unlike a set, the same elements can appear multiple times at different positions in a sequence, and order matters.  Formally, a sequence can be defined as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] whose domain is either the set of the [[natural number]]s (for infinite sequences) or the set of the first ''n'' natural numbers (for a sequence of finite length ''n'').  The position of an element in a sequence is its ''rank'' or ''index''; it is the natural number from which the element is the image. It depends on the context or a specific convention, if the first element has index 0 or 1.  When a symbol has been chosen for denoting a sequence, the ''n''th element of the sequence is denoted by this symbol with ''n'' as subscript; for example, the ''n''th element of the [[Fibonacci sequence]] is generally denoted ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

For example, (M, A, R, Y) is a sequence of letters with the letter 'M' first and 'Y' last.  This sequence differs from (A, R, M, Y).  Also, the sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8), which contains the number 1 at two different positions, is a valid sequence.  Sequences can be ''[[finite set|finite]]'', as in these examples, or ''[[Infinite set|infinite]]'', such as the sequence of all [[even and odd numbers|even]] [[positive integer]]s (2, 4, 6, ...).  In [[computing]] and [[computer science]], finite sequences are sometimes called [[string (computer science)|strings]], [[word (mathematics)|words]] or [[list (computer science)|lists]], the different names commonly corresponding to different ways to represent them in [[computer memory]]; infinite sequences are called [[stream (computing)|streams]].  The empty sequence&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;) is included in most notions of sequence, but may be excluded depending on the context.
[[Image:Cauchy sequence illustration2.svg|right|thumb|350px|An infinite sequence of [[real number]]s (in blue).  This sequence is neither increasing, decreasing, convergent, nor [[Cauchy sequence|Cauchy]].  It is, however, bounded.]]

==Examples and notation==
A sequence can be thought of as a list of elements with a particular order.  Sequences are useful in a number of mathematical disciplines for studying [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], [[Space (mathematics)|spaces]], and other mathematical structures using the [[#Limits and convergence|convergence]] properties of sequences.  In particular, sequences are the basis for [[series (mathematics)|series]], which are important in [[differential equations]] and [[analysis (mathematics)|analysis]].  Sequences are also of interest in their own right and can be studied as patterns or puzzles, such as in the study of [[prime number]]s.

There are a number of ways to denote a sequence, some of which are more useful for specific types of sequences.  One way to specify a sequence is to list the elements.  For example, the first four odd numbers form the sequence (1, 3, 5, 7).  This notation can be used for infinite sequences as well.  For instance, the infinite sequence of positive odd integers can be written (1, 3, 5, 7, ...).  Listing is most useful for infinite sequences with a [[pattern]] that can be easily discerned from the first few elements.  Other ways to denote a sequence are discussed after the examples.

===Examples===
[[File:Fibonacci blocks.svg|thumb|A [[Tessellation|tiling]] with squares whose sides are successive Fibonacci numbers in length.]]

The [[prime number]]s are the [[natural numbers]] bigger than 1 that have no [[divisor]]s but 1 and themselves.  Taking these in their natural order gives the sequence (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ...).  The prime numbers are widely used in [[mathematics]] and specifically in [[number theory]].

The [[Fibonacci numbers]] are the integer sequence whose elements are the sum of the previous two elements.  The first two elements are either 0 and 1 or 1 and 1 so that the sequence is (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...).

For a large list of examples of integer sequences, see [http://oeis.org/wiki/Welcome#Some_Famous_Sequences On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences].

Other examples of sequences include ones made up of [[rational numbers]], [[real number]]s, and [[complex numbers]].  The sequence (.9, .99, .999, .9999, ...) approaches the number 1.  In fact, every real number can be written as the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of a sequence of rational numbers, e.g. via its [[decimal expansion]].  For instance, [[pi|{{pi}}]] is the limit of the sequence (3, 3.1, 3.14, 3.141, 3.1415, ...).  A related sequence is the sequence of decimal digits of {{pi}}, i.e. (3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, ...).  This sequence does not have any pattern that is easily discernible by eye, unlike the preceding sequence, which is increasing.

===Indexing===
Other notations can be useful for sequences whose pattern cannot be easily guessed, or for sequences that do not have a pattern such as the digits of [[pi|{{pi}}]].  One such notation is to write down a general formula for computing the ''n''th term as a function of ''n'', enclose it in parentheses, and include a subscript indicating the range of values that ''n'' can take.  For example, in this notation the sequence of even numbers could be written as &lt;math&gt;(2n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt;.  The sequence of squares could be written as &lt;math&gt;(n^2)_{n\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt;.  The variable ''n'' is called an [[Indexed family|index]], and the set of values that it can take is called the [[index set]].

It is often useful to combine this notation with the technique of treating the elements of a sequence as variables.  This yields expressions like &lt;math&gt;(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt;, which denotes a sequence whose ''n''th element is given by the variable &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt;.  For example:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
a_1 &amp;= 1\text{st element of }(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N} \\
a_2 &amp;= 2\text{nd element } \\
a_3 &amp;= 3\text{rd element } \\
&amp;\vdots \\
a_{n-1} &amp;= (n-1)\text{th element} \\
a_n &amp;= n\text{th element} \\
a_{n+1} &amp;= (n+1)\text{th element} \\
&amp; \vdots
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Note that we can consider multiple sequences at the same time by using different variables; e.g. &lt;math&gt;(b_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt; could be a different sequence than &lt;math&gt;(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt;.  We can even consider a sequence of sequences: &lt;math&gt;((a_{m, n})_{n\in\mathbb N})_{m\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt; denotes a sequence whose ''m''th term is the sequence &lt;math&gt;(a_{m, n})_{n\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt;.

An alternative to writing the domain of a sequence in the subscript is to indicate the range of values that the index can take by listing its highest and lowest legal values.  For example, the notation &lt;math&gt;(k^2)_{k = 1}^{10}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the ten-term sequence of squares &lt;math&gt;(1, 4, 9, ..., 100)&lt;/math&gt;.  The limits &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; are allowed, but they do not represent valid values for the index, only the [[supremum]] or [[infimum]] of such values, respectively.  For example, the sequence &lt;math&gt;(a_n)_{n = 1}^\infty&lt;/math&gt; is the same as the sequence &lt;math&gt;(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt;, and does not contain an additional term "at infinity".  The sequence &lt;math&gt;(a_n)_{n = -\infty}^\infty&lt;/math&gt; is a '''bi-infinite sequence''', and can also be written as &lt;math&gt;(..., a_{-1}, a_0, a_1, a_2, ...)&lt;/math&gt;.

In cases where the set of indexing numbers is understood, the subscripts and superscripts are often left off.  That is, one simply writes &lt;math&gt;(a_k)&lt;/math&gt; for an arbitrary sequence.  Often, the index ''k'' is understood to run from 1 to ∞.  However, sequences are frequently indexed starting from zero, as in
:&lt;math&gt;(a_k)_{k=0}^\infty = ( a_0, a_1, a_2, ... ).&lt;/math&gt;
In some cases the elements of the sequence are related naturally to a sequence of integers whose pattern can be easily inferred.  In these cases the index set may be implied by a listing of the first few abstract elements.  For instance, the sequence of squares of [[odd number]]s could be denoted in any of the following ways.

* &lt;math&gt;(1, 9, 25, ...)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(a_1, a_3, a_5, ...), \qquad a_k = k^2&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(a_{2k-1})_{k=1}^\infty, \qquad a_k = k^2&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(a_{k})_{k=1}^\infty, \qquad a_k = (2k-1)^2&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;((2k-1)^2)_{k=1}^\infty&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, the subscripts and superscripts could have been left off in the third, fourth, and fifth notations, if the indexing set was understood to be the [[natural numbers]].  Note that in the second and third bullets, there is a well-defined sequence &lt;math&gt;(a_{k})_{k=1}^\infty&lt;/math&gt;, but it is not the same as the sequence denoted by the expression.

===Defining a sequence by recursion===
Sequences whose elements are related to the previous elements in a straightforward way are often defined using [[Recursive definition|recursion]].  This is in contrast to the definition of sequences of elements as functions of their positions.

To define a sequence by recursion, one needs a rule to construct each element in terms of the ones before it.  In addition, enough initial elements must be provided so that all subsequent elements of the sequence can be computed by the rule.  The principle of [[mathematical induction]] can be used to [[proof (mathematics)|prove]] that in this case, there is exactly one sequence that satisfies both the recursion rule and the initial conditions.  Induction can also be used to prove properties about a sequence, especially for sequences whose most natural description is recursive.

The [[Fibonacci sequence]] can be defined using a recursive rule along with two initial elements.  The rule is that each element is the sum of the previous two elements, and the first two elements are 0 and 1.
:&lt;math&gt;a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}&lt;/math&gt;, {{pad|4em}} with {{pad|2em}} &lt;math&gt;a_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_1 = 1&lt;/math&gt;.
The first ten terms of this sequence are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34.  A more complicated example of a sequence that is defined recursively is Recaman's sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OEIS|1=A005132|2=Recamán's sequence|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  We can define Recaman's sequence by
:&lt;math&gt;a_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_n = a_{n-1} - n&lt;/math&gt;, if the result is positive and not already in the list.  Otherwise, &lt;math&gt;a_n = a_{n-1} + n&lt;/math&gt;.

Not all sequences can be specified by a rule in the form of an equation, recursive or not, and some can be quite complicated.  For example, the sequence of [[prime number]]s is the set of prime numbers in their natural order, i.e. (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ...).

Many sequences have the property that each element of a sequence can be computed from the previous element.  In this case, there is some function ''f'' such that for all ''n'', &lt;math&gt;a_{n+1} = f(a_n)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Formal definition and basic properties==
There are many different notions of sequences in mathematics, some of which (''e.g.'', [[exact sequence]]) are not covered by the definitions and notations introduced below.

===Formal definition===
For the purposes of this article, we define a sequence to be a [[function (mathematics)|function]] whose domain is an [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] of [[integers]].  This definition covers several different uses of the word "sequence", including one-sided infinite sequences, bi-infinite sequences, and finite sequences (see below for definitions).  However, many authors use a narrower definition by requiring the domain of a sequence to be the set of [[natural numbers]].  The narrower definition has the disadvantage that it rules out finite sequences and bi-infinite sequences, both of which are usually called sequences in standard mathematical practice.   In some contexts, to shorten exposition, the [[codomain]] of the sequence is fixed by context, for example by requiring it to be the set '''R''' of real numbers,&lt;ref name="Gaughan" /&gt; the set '''C''' of complex numbers,&lt;ref name=Saff&gt;{{Cite book |title=Fundamentals of Complex Analysis|chapter=Chapter 2.1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fVsZAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=saff+%26+Snider&amp;dq=saff+%26+Snider&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rT7PUPaiL4OE2gXvg4GoBQ&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwAw
|author=Edward B. Saff &amp; Arthur David Snider |year=2003 |isbn=01-390-7874-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[topological space]].&lt;ref name=Munkres&gt;{{Cite book|title=Topology| chapter=Chapters 1&amp;2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XjoZAQAAIAAJ |author=James R. Munkres |isbn=01-318-1629-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although sequences are a type of function, they are usually distinguished notationally from functions in that the input is written as a subscript rather than in parentheses, i.e. ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' rather than ''f''(''n'').  There are terminological differences as well: the value of a sequence at the input 1 is called the "first element" of the sequence, the value at 2 is called the "second element", etc.  Also, while a function abstracted from its input is usually denoted by a single letter, e.g. ''f'', a sequence abstracted from its input is usually written by a notation such as &lt;math&gt;(a_n)_{n\in A}&lt;/math&gt;, or just as &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt;.  Here ''A'' is the domain, or index set, of the sequence.

Sequences and their limits (see below) are important concepts for studying topological spaces.  An important generalization of sequences is the concept of [[net (mathematics)|nets]].  A '''net''' is a function from a (possibly [[uncountable]]) [[directed set]] to a topological space.  The notational conventions for sequences normally apply to nets as well.

===Finite and infinite===
{{See also|ω-language}}
The '''length''' of a sequence is defined as the number of terms in the sequence.

A sequence of a finite length ''n'' is also called an [[n-tuple|''n''-tuple]].  Finite sequences include the '''empty sequence'''&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;) that has no elements.

{{anchor|Doubly infinite|Doubly-infinite sequences}}
Normally, the term ''infinite sequence'' refers to a sequence that is infinite in one direction, and finite in the other—the sequence has a first element, but no final element.  Such a sequence is called a '''singly infinite sequence''' or a '''one-sided infinite sequence''' when disambiguation is necessary.  In contrast, a sequence that is infinite in both directions—i.e. that has neither a first nor a final element—is called a '''bi-infinite sequence''', '''two-way infinite sequence''', or '''doubly infinite sequence'''.  A function from the set '''Z''' of ''all'' [[integers]] into a set, such as for instance the sequence of all even integers ( …, −4, −2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8… ), is bi-infinite.  This sequence could be denoted &lt;math&gt;(2n)_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Increasing and decreasing===
A sequence is said to be ''[[monotonically increasing]]'', if each term is greater than or equal to the one before it.  For example, the sequence &lt;math&gt;(a_n)_{n=1}^{\infty} &lt;/math&gt; is monotonically increasing if and only if ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\geq&lt;/math&gt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''n'' ∈ '''N'''.  If each consecutive term is strictly greater than (&gt;) the previous term then the sequence is called '''strictly monotonically increasing'''.  A sequence is '''monotonically decreasing''', if each consecutive term is less than or equal to the previous one, and '''strictly monotonically decreasing''', if each is strictly less than the previous.  If a sequence is either increasing or decreasing it is called a '''monotone''' sequence.  This is a special case of the more general notion of a [[monotonic function]].

The terms '''nondecreasing''' and '''nonincreasing''' are often used in place of ''increasing'' and ''decreasing'' in order to avoid any possible confusion with ''strictly increasing'' and ''strictly decreasing'', respectively.

===Bounded===
If the sequence of real numbers (''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') is such that all the terms are less than some real number ''M'', then the sequence is said to be '''bounded from above'''.  In other words, this means that there exists ''M'' such that for all ''n'', ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≤ ''M''.  Any such ''M'' is called an ''upper bound''.  Likewise, if, for some real ''m'', ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≥ ''m'' for all ''n'' greater than some ''N'', then the sequence is '''bounded from below''' and any such ''m'' is called a ''lower bound''.  If a sequence is both bounded from above and bounded from below, then the sequence is said to be '''bounded'''.

===Subsequences===
A '''[[subsequence]]''' of a given sequence is a sequence formed from the given sequence by deleting some of the elements without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining elements.  For instance, the sequence of positive even integers (2, 4, 6, ...) is a subsequence of the positive integers (1, 2, 3, ...).  The positions of some elements change when other elements are deleted.  However, the relative positions are preserved.

Formally, a subsequence of the sequence &lt;math&gt;(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt; is any sequence of the form &lt;math&gt;(a_{n_k})_{k\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;(n_k)_{k\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt; is a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers.

===Other types of sequences===
Some other types of sequences that are easy to define include:
* An '''[[integer sequence]]''' is a sequence whose terms are integers.
* A '''[[polynomial sequence]]''' is a sequence whose terms are polynomials.
* A positive integer sequence is sometimes called '''multiplicative''', if ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''nm''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; for all pairs ''n'', ''m'' such that ''n'' and ''m'' are [[coprime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lectures on generating functions|last=Lando|first=Sergei K.|publisher=AMS|ISBN=0-8218-3481-9|chapter=7.4 Multiplicative sequences}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other instances, sequences are often called ''multiplicative'', if ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''na''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''n''.  Moreover, a ''multiplicative'' Fibonacci sequence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0020739031000158362|title=Fibonacci's multiplicative sequence|first=Sergio|last=Falcon|publisher=|journal=International Journal of Mathematical Education in Science and Technology|volume=34|issue=2|pages=310–315|doi=10.1080/0020739031000158362}}&lt;/ref&gt; satisfies the recursion relation ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−2&lt;/sub&gt;.
* A [[binary sequence]] is a sequence whose terms have one of two discrete values, e.g. [[base 2]] values (0,1,1,0, ...) , a series of coin tosses (Heads/Tails) H,T,H,H,T, ..., the answers to a set of True or False questions (T, F, T, T, ...), and so on.

==Limits and convergence==
{{Main|Limit of a sequence}}

[[File:Converging Sequence example.svg|320px|thumb|The plot of a convergent sequence (''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') is shown in blue.  From the graph we can see that the sequence is converging to the limit zero as ''n'' increases.]]

An important property of a sequence is ''convergence''.  If a sequence converges, it converges to a particular value known as the ''limit''. If a sequence converges to some limit, then it is '''convergent'''. A sequence that does not converge is '''divergent'''.

Informally, a sequence has a limit if the elements of the sequence become closer and closer to some value &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; (called the limit of the sequence), and they become and remain ''arbitrarily'' close to &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, meaning that given a real number &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; greater than zero, all but a finite number of the elements of the sequence have a distance from &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; less than &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.  

For example, the sequence &lt;math&gt;a_n = \frac{n+1}{2n^2}&lt;/math&gt; shown to the right converges to the value 0. On the other hand, the sequences &lt;math&gt;b_n = n^3&lt;/math&gt; (which begins 1, 8, 27, &amp;hellip;) and &lt;math&gt;c_n = (-1)^n&lt;/math&gt; (which begins -1, 1, -1, 1, &amp;hellip;) are both divergent. 

If a sequence converges, then the value it converges to is unique.  This value is called the '''limit''' of the sequence.  The limit of a convergent sequence &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; is normally denoted &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a divergent sequence, then the expression &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n&lt;/math&gt; is meaningless.

=== Formal definition of convergence===

A sequence of real numbers &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; '''converges to''' a real number &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; if, for all &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a natural number &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;n \geq N&lt;/math&gt; we have&lt;ref name="Gaughan"&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to Analysis |last=Gaughan |first=Edward |publisher=AMS (2009)|ISBN=0-8218-4787-2|chapter=1.1 Sequences and Convergence}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;|a_n - L| &lt; \varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of complex numbers rather than a sequence of real numbers, this last formula can still be used to define convergence, with the provision that &lt;math&gt;|\cdot|&lt;/math&gt; denotes the complex modulus, i.e. &lt;math&gt;|z| = \sqrt{z^*z}&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of points in a [[metric space]], then the formula can be used to define convergence, if the expression &lt;math&gt;|a_n-L|&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by the expression &lt;math&gt;\text{dist}(a_n, L)&lt;/math&gt;, which denotes the [[Metric (mathematics)|distance]] between &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;.

===Applications and important results===
If &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(b_n)&lt;/math&gt; are convergent sequences, then the following limits exist, and can be computed as follows:&lt;ref name="Gaughan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawkins"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcII/Sequences.aspx |title=Series and Sequences |last1=Dawikins |first1=Paul |work=Paul's Online Math Notes/Calc II (notes) |accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n \pm b_n) = \lim_{n\to\infty} a_n \pm \lim_{n\to\infty} b_n&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} c a_n = c \lim_{n\to\infty} a_n&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n b_n) = \left( \lim_{n\to\infty} a_n \right) \left( \lim_{n\to\infty} b_n \right)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{a_n} {b_n} = \frac{ \lim \limits_{n\to\infty} a_n}{ \lim \limits_{n\to\infty} b_n}&lt;/math&gt;, provided that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} b_n \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;

* If a sequence is [[#Bounded|bounded]] and [[#Increasing and decreasing|monotonic]] then it is convergent.
* A sequence is convergent if and only if all of its subsequences are convergent.

===Cauchy sequences===
{{Main|Cauchy sequence}}

[[File:Cauchy sequence illustration.svg|350px|thumb| The plot of a Cauchy sequence (''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''), shown in blue, as ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' versus ''n''.  In the graph the sequence appears to be converging to a  limit as the distance between consecutive terms in the sequence gets smaller as ''n'' increases.  In the [[real number]]s every Cauchy sequence converges to some limit.]]

A Cauchy sequence is a sequence whose terms become arbitrarily close together as n gets very large.  The notion of a Cauchy sequence is important in the study of sequences in [[metric spaces]], and, in particular, in [[real analysis]].  One particularly important result in real analysis is ''Cauchy characterization of convergence for sequences'':
:A sequence of real numbers is convergent (in the reals) if and only if it is Cauchy.
In contrast, there are Cauchy sequences of [[rational numbers]] that are not convergent in the rationals, e.g. the sequence defined by
''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = {{sfrac|1=''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; + {{sfrac|1=2|2=''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}|2=2}}
is Cauchy, but has no rational limit, cf. [[Cauchy sequence#Counter-example: rational numbers|here]].  More generally, any sequence of rational numbers that converges to an [[irrational number]] is Cauchy, but not convergent when interpreted as a sequence in the set of rational numbers.

Metric spaces that satisfy the Cauchy characterization of convergence for sequences are called [[complete metric space]]s and are particularly nice for analysis.

=== Infinite limits ===

In calculus, it is common to define notation for sequences which do not converge in the sense discussed above, but which instead become and remain arbitrarily large, or become and remain arbitrarily negative.  If &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; becomes arbitrarily large as &lt;math&gt;n \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;, we write
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n = \infty.&lt;/math&gt;
In this case we say that the sequence '''diverges''', or that it '''converges to infinity'''. An example of such a sequence is {{nowrap|1=''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''n''}}.

If &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; becomes arbitrarily negative (i.e. negative and large in magnitude) as &lt;math&gt;n \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;, we write
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n = -\infty&lt;/math&gt;
and say that the sequence '''diverges''' or '''converges to negative infinity'''.

==Series==
{{Main|Series (mathematics)}}
A '''series''' is, informally speaking, the sum of the terms of a sequence.  That is, it is an expression of the form &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;a_1 + a_2 + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of real or complex numbers.  The '''partial sums''' of a series are the expressions resulting from replacing the infinity symbol with a finite number, i.e. the ''N''th partial sum of the series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt; is the number
:&lt;math&gt;S_N = \sum_{n = 1}^N a_n = a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_N. &lt;/math&gt;
The partial sums themselves form a sequence &lt;math&gt;(S_N)_{N\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt;, which is called the '''sequence of partial sums''' of the series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt;.  If the sequence of partial sums converges, then we say that the series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt; is '''convergent''', and the limit &lt;math&gt;\lim_{N\to\infty} S_N&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''value''' of the series.  The same notation is used to denote a series and its value, i.e. we write &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n = \lim_{N\to\infty} S_N&lt;/math&gt;.

==Use in other fields of mathematics==

===Topology===
Sequences play an important role in topology, especially in the study of [[metric spaces]].  For instance:
* A [[metric space]] is [[compact space|compact]] exactly when it is [[sequential compactness|sequentially compact]].
* A function from a metric space to another metric space is [[continuous function|continuous]] exactly when it takes convergent sequences to convergent sequences.
* A metric space is a [[connected space]] if and only if, whenever the space is partitioned into two sets, one of the two sets contains a sequence converging to a point in the other set.
* A [[topological space]] is [[separable space|separable]] exactly when there is a dense sequence of points.

Sequences can be generalized to [[net (mathematics)|nets]] or [[filter (mathematics)|filters]].  These generalizations allow one to extend some of the above theorems to spaces without metrics.

====Product topology====
The [[product topology|topological product]] of a sequence of topological spaces is the [[cartesian product]] of those spaces, equipped with a [[natural topology]] called the [[product topology]].

More formally, given a sequence of spaces &lt;math&gt;(X_i)_{i\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt;, the product space

:&lt;math&gt;X := \prod_{i\in\mathbb N} X_i, &lt;/math&gt;

is defined as the set of all sequences &lt;math&gt;(x_i)_{i\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt; such that for each ''i'', &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is an element of &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt;.  The '''[[projection (set theory)|canonical projections]]''' are the maps ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''X'' &amp;rarr; ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' defined by the equation &lt;math&gt;p_i((x_j)_{j\in\mathbb N}) = x_i&lt;/math&gt;.  Then the '''product topology''' on ''X'' is defined to be the [[coarsest topology]] (i.e. the topology with the fewest open sets) for which all the projections ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are [[continuous (topology)|continuous]].  The product topology is sometimes called the '''Tychonoff topology'''.

===Analysis===
In [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], when talking about sequences, one will generally consider sequences of the form
:&lt;math&gt;(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots)\text{ or }(x_0, x_1, x_2, \dots)&lt;/math&gt;
which is to say, infinite sequences of elements indexed by [[natural number]]s.

It may be convenient to have the sequence start with an index different from 1 or 0.  For example, the sequence defined by ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1/[[logarithm|log]](''n'') would be defined only for ''n'' ≥ 2.  When talking about such infinite sequences, it is usually sufficient (and does not change much for most considerations) to assume that the members of the sequence are defined at least for all indices [[large enough]], that is, greater than some given ''N''.

The most elementary type of sequences are numerical ones, that is, sequences of [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] numbers.  This type can be generalized to sequences of elements of some [[vector space]].  In analysis, the vector spaces considered are often [[function space]]s.  Even more generally, one can study sequences with elements in some [[topological space]].

====Sequence spaces====
{{main|Sequence space}}
A [[sequence space]] is a [[vector space]] whose elements are infinite sequences of [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] numbers.  Equivalently, it is a [[function space]] whose elements are functions from the [[natural numbers]] to the field '''K''', where '''K''' is either the field of real numbers or the field of complex numbers.  The set of all such functions is naturally identified with the set of all possible infinite sequences with elements in '''K''', and can be turned into a [[vector space]] under the operations of [[pointwise addition]] of functions and pointwise scalar multiplication.  All sequence spaces are [[linear subspace]]s of this space.  Sequence spaces are typically equipped with a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]], or at least the structure of a [[topological vector space]].

The most important sequences spaces in analysis are the ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; spaces, consisting of the ''p''-power summable sequences, with the ''p''-norm.  These are special cases of [[Lp space|L&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; spaces]] for the [[counting measure]] on the set of natural numbers.  Other important classes of sequences like convergent sequences or [[#c and c0|null sequence]]s form sequence spaces, respectively denoted ''c'' and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, with the sup norm.  Any sequence space can also be equipped with the [[topology]] of [[pointwise convergence]], under which it becomes a special kind of [[Fréchet space]] called an [[FK-space]].

===Linear algebra===
Sequences over a field may also be viewed as [[Vector (geometric)|vectors]] in a [[vector space]].  Specifically, the set of ''F''-valued sequences (where ''F'' is a [[field (mathematics)|field]]) is a [[function space]] (in fact, a [[product space]]) of ''F''-valued functions over the set of natural numbers.

===Abstract algebra===
Abstract algebra employs several types of sequences, including sequences of mathematical objects such as groups or rings.

====Free monoid====
{{Main|Free monoid}}
If ''A'' is a set, the [[free monoid]] over ''A'' (denoted ''A''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, also called [[Kleene star]] of ''A'') is a [[monoid]] containing all the finite sequences (or strings) of zero or more elements of ''A'', with the binary operation of concatenation.  The [[free semigroup]] ''A''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is the subsemigroup of ''A''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; containing all elements except the empty sequence.

====Exact sequences====
{{Main|Exact sequence}}
In the context of [[group theory]], a sequence
:&lt;math&gt;G_0 \;\xrightarrow{f_1}\; G_1 \;\xrightarrow{f_2}\; G_2 \;\xrightarrow{f_3}\; \cdots \;\xrightarrow{f_n}\; G_n&lt;/math&gt;
of [[group (mathematics)|groups]] and [[group homomorphism]]s is called '''exact''', if the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] (or [[Range (mathematics)|range]]) of each homomorphism is equal to the [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of the next:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{im}(f_k) = \mathrm{ker}(f_{k+1})&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the sequence of groups and homomorphisms may be either finite or infinite.

A similar definition can be made for certain other [[algebraic structure]]s.  For example, one could have an exact sequence of [[vector space]]s and [[linear map]]s, or of [[module (mathematics)|modules]] and [[module homomorphism]]s.

====Spectral sequences====
{{Main|Spectral sequence}}
In [[homological algebra]] and [[algebraic topology]], a '''spectral sequence''' is a means of computing homology groups by taking successive approximations.  Spectral sequences are a generalization of [[exact sequence]]s, and since their introduction by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Jean Leray|first=Jean|last=Leray|year=1946}}, they have become an important research tool, particularly in [[homotopy theory]].

===Set theory===
An [[Order topology#Ordinal-indexed sequences|ordinal-indexed sequence]] is a generalization of a sequence.  If α is a [[limit ordinal]] and ''X'' is a set, an α-indexed sequence of elements of ''X'' is a function from α to ''X''.  In this terminology an ω-indexed sequence is an ordinary sequence.

===Computing===
[[Automata theory|Automata]] or [[finite state machine]]s can typically be thought of as directed graphs, with edges labeled using some specific alphabet, Σ.  Most familiar types of automata transition from state to state by reading input letters from Σ, following edges with matching labels; the ordered input for such an automaton forms a sequence called a ''word'' (or input word).  The sequence of states encountered by the automaton when processing a word is called a ''run''.  A [[Nondeterministic finite automaton|nondeterministic automaton]] may have unlabeled or duplicate out-edges for any state, giving more than one successor for some input letter.  This is typically thought of as producing multiple possible runs for a given word, each being a sequence of single states, rather than producing a single run that is a sequence of sets of states; however, 'run' is occasionally used to mean the latter.

===Streams===
Infinite sequences of [[numerical digit|digits]] (or [[character (computing)|characters]]) drawn from a [[finite set|finite]] [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] are of particular interest in [[theoretical computer science]].  They are often referred to simply as ''sequences'' or ''[[Stream (computing)|streams]]'', as opposed to finite ''[[String (computer science)#Formal theory|strings]]''.  Infinite binary sequences, for instance, are infinite sequences of [[bit]]s (characters drawn from the alphabet {0, 1}).  The set ''C'' = {0, 1}&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; of all infinite binary sequences is sometimes called the [[Cantor space]].

An infinite binary sequence can represent a [[formal language]] (a set of strings) by setting the ''n''&amp;thinsp;th bit of the sequence to 1 if and only if the ''n''&amp;thinsp;th string (in [[shortlex order]]) is in the language.  This representation is useful in the [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonalization method]] for proofs.&lt;ref name=Oflazer2011&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oflazer|first1=Kemal|title=FORMAL LANGUAGES, AUTOMATA AND COMPUTATION: DECIDABILITY|url=http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/ko/pdfs/lecture-15.pdf|website=cmu.edu|publisher=Carnegie-Mellon University|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="69359">In [[mathematics]], '''[[singular integral operators]] of convolution type''' are the [[singular integral operator]]s that arise on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; through convolution by distributions; equivalently they are the singular integral operators that commute with translations. The classical examples in [[harmonic analysis]] are the [[harmonic conjugate|harmonic conjugation operator]] on the circle, the [[Hilbert transform]] on the circle and the real line, the [[Beurling transform]] in the complex plane and the [[Riesz transform]]s in Euclidean space. The continuity of these operators on ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is evident because the [[Fourier transform]] converts them into [[Fourier multiplier|multiplication operators]]. Continuity on ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' spaces was first established by [[Marcel Riesz]]. The classical techniques include the use of [[Poisson integral]]s, [[interpolation theory]] and the [[Hardy–Littlewood maximal function]]. For more general operators, fundamental new techniques, introduced by [[Alberto Calderón]] and [[Antoni Zygmund]] in 1952, were developed by a number of authors to give general criteria for continuity on ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' spaces. This article explains the theory for the classical operators and sketches the subsequent general theory.

==L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; theory==

===Hilbert transform on the circle===
{{See also|Harmonic conjugate}}
The theory for ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; functions is particularly simple on the circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Torchinsky|2004|pp=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bell|1992|pp=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; If ''f'' ∈ ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''), then it has a Fourier series expansion

:&lt;math&gt;f(\theta)=\sum_{n \in \mathbf{Z}} a_n e^{in\theta}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Hardy space]] H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''T''') consists of the functions for which the negative coefficients vanish, ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0 for ''n'' &lt; 0. These are precisely the square-integrable functions that arise as boundary values of holomorphic functions in the open unit disk. Indeed, ''f'' is the boundary value of the function

:&lt;math&gt;F(z)=\sum_{n\ge 0} a_n z^n,&lt;/math&gt;

in the sense that the functions

:&lt;math&gt;f_r(\theta)=F(re^{i\theta}),&lt;/math&gt;

defined by the restriction of ''F'' to the concentric circles |''z''| = ''r'', satisfy

:&lt;math&gt;\|f_r-f\|_2 \rightarrow 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The orthogonal projection ''P'' of ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''T''') onto H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''T''') is called the '''Szegő projection'''. It is a bounded operator on ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''T''') with [[operator norm]] 1. By Cauchy's theorem

:&lt;math&gt;F(z)= {1\over 2\pi i} \int_{|\zeta|=1}  {f(\zeta)\over \zeta -z} \,d\zeta={1\over 2\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} {f(\theta) \over 1-e^{-i\theta}z} \, d\theta.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{F(re^{i\varphi})={1\over 2\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} {f(\varphi-\theta) \over 1-re^{i\theta}} \, d\theta.}&lt;/math&gt;

When ''r'' = 1, the integrand on the right hand side has a singularity at θ = 0. The '''truncated Hilbert transform''' is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{H_\varepsilon f(\varphi) = {i\over \pi} \int_{\varepsilon\le |\theta| \le  \pi} {f(\varphi-\theta) \over 1-e^{i\theta}} \, d\theta={1\over \pi} \int_{|\zeta-e^{i\varphi}|\ge \delta} {f(\zeta)\over \zeta-e^{i\varphi}}\, d\zeta,}&lt;/math&gt;

where δ = |1 – ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''i''ε&lt;/sup&gt;|. Since it is defined as convolution with a bounded function, it is a bounded operator on L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''). Now

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{H_\varepsilon{1}={i\over\pi}\int_\varepsilon^\pi 2 \Re (1-e^{i\theta})^{-1} \,  d\theta ={i\over\pi}\int_\varepsilon^\pi 1 \, d\theta = i - {i \varepsilon\over \pi}.}&lt;/math&gt;

If ''f'' is a polynomial in ''z'' then

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{H_\varepsilon f(z) - {i(1-\varepsilon)\over \pi} f(z)={1\over \pi i} \int_{|\zeta -z|\ge \delta} {f(\zeta)-f(z)\over \zeta -z} \, d\zeta.}&lt;/math&gt;

By Cauchy's theorem the right hand side tends to 0 uniformly as ε, and hence δ, tends to 0. So

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{H_\varepsilon f \rightarrow if}&lt;/math&gt;

uniformly for polynomials. On the other hand, if ''u''(''z'') = ''z'' it is immediate that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\overline{H_\varepsilon f} = - u^{-1} H_\varepsilon( u \overline{f}).}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus if ''f'' is a polynomial in ''z''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; without constant term

:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle{H_\varepsilon f \rightarrow -i f}&lt;/math&gt; uniformly.

Define the '''Hilbert transform''' on the circle by

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{H=i(2P-I).}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus if ''f'' is a trigonometric polynomial

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{H_\varepsilon f \rightarrow Hf}&lt;/math&gt; uniformly.

It follows that if ''f'' is any L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; function

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{H_\varepsilon f \rightarrow Hf}&lt;/math&gt; in the L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; norm.

This is an immediate consequence of the result for trigonometric polynomials once it is established that the operators ''H''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt; are uniformly bounded in [[operator norm]]. But on [–π,π]

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{(1-e^{i\theta})^{-1}= [(1-e^{i\theta})^{-1} -i\theta^{-1}] +i\theta^{-1}.}&lt;/math&gt;

The first term is bounded on the whole of [–π,π], so it suffices to show that the  convolution operators ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt; defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{S_\varepsilon f(\varphi) =\int_{\varepsilon \le |\theta|\le \pi} f(\varphi-\theta)\theta^{-1}\,d\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

are uniformly bounded. With respect to the orthonormal basis ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''in''θ&lt;/sup&gt; convolution operators are diagonal and their operator norms are given by taking the supremum of the moduli of the Fourier coefficients. Direct computation shows that these all have the form

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{{1\over \pi}\left |\int_a^b {\sin t \over t}\, dt\right|}&lt;/math&gt;

with 0 &lt; ''a'' &lt; ''b''. These integrals are well-known to be uniformly bounded.

It also follows that, for  a continuous function ''f'' on the circle, ''H''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt;''f'' converges uniformly to ''Hf'', so in particular pointwise. The pointwise limit is a [[Cauchy principal value]], written

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{Hf= \mathrm{P.V.}\,{1\over \pi} \int {f(\zeta)\over \zeta-e^{i\varphi}}\, d\zeta.}&lt;/math&gt;

If ''f'' is just in L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; then ''H''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt;''f'' converges to ''Hf'' pointwise almost everywhere.  In fact define the [[Poisson integral|Poisson operators]] on L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; functions by

:&lt;math&gt;T_r \left (\sum a_n e^{in\theta} \right )=\sum r^{|n|} a_n e^{in\theta},&lt;/math&gt;

for ''r'' &lt; 1. Since these operators are diagonal, it is easy to see that ''T&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;f'' tends to ''f'' in L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; as ''r'' increases to 1. Moreover, as Lebesgue proved, ''T&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;f''  also tends pointwise to ''f'' at each [[Lebesgue point]] of ''f''. On the other hand, it is also known that ''T&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;Hf'' – ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1 – ''r''&lt;/sub&gt; ''f'' tends to zero at each Lebesgue point of ''f''. Hence ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1 – ''r''&lt;/sub&gt; ''f'' tends pointwise to ''f'' on the common Lebesgue points of ''f'' and ''Hf'' and therefore almost everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krantz|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Torchinsky|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stein|Rami|2005|pp=112–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Results of this kind on pointwise convergence are proved more generally below for ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' functions using the Poisson operators and the Hardy–Littlewood maximal function of ''f''.

The Hilbert transform has a natural compatibility with orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms of the circle.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Mikhlin|Prössdorf|1986}}
*{{harvnb|Segal|1981}}
*{{harvnb|Pressley|Segal|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus if ''H'' is a diffeomorphism of the circle with

:&lt;math&gt;H(e^{i\theta})=e^{ih(\theta)},\,\,\, h(\theta+2\pi)=h(\theta)+2\pi,&lt;/math&gt;

then the operators

:&lt;math&gt;H_\varepsilon^h f(e^{i\varphi})=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{|e^{ih(\theta)} -e^{ih(\varphi)}|\ge \varepsilon} \frac{f(e^{i\theta})}{e^{i\theta}-e^{i\varphi}}e^{i\theta}\, d\theta,&lt;/math&gt;

are uniformly bounded and tend in the strong operator topology to ''H''. Moreover, if ''Vf''(''z'') = ''f''(''H''(''z'')), then ''VHV''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; – ''H''  is an operator with smooth kernel, so a [[Hilbert–Schmidt operator]].

In fact if ''G'' is the inverse of ''H'' with corresponding function ''g''(θ), then

:&lt;math&gt;(VH^h_\varepsilon V^{-1}- H_\varepsilon) f(e^{i\varphi}) = {1\over \pi}\int_{|e^{i\theta}-e^{i\varphi}| \ge \varepsilon}\left[{g^\prime(\theta) e^{ig(\theta)} \over e^{ig(\theta)} - e^{ig(\varphi)}} - {e^{i\theta} \over e^{i\theta} - e^{i\varphi} }\right]\,f(e^{i\theta})\, d\theta.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the kernel on the right hand side is smooth on '''T''' × '''T''', it follows that the operators on the right hand side are uniformly bounded and hence so too are the operators ''H''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''h''&lt;/sup&gt;. To see that they tend strongly to ''H'', it suffices to check this on trigonometric polynomials. In that case

:&lt;math&gt;H^h_\varepsilon f(\zeta)={1\over \pi i} \int_{|H(z)-H(\zeta)|\ge \varepsilon} \frac{f(z)}{z -\zeta} dz= {1\over \pi i} \int_{|H(z)-H(\zeta)|\ge \varepsilon} {f(z)-f(\zeta)\over z -\zeta}\, dz + \frac{f(\zeta)}{\pi i} \int_{|H(z)-H(\zeta)|\ge \varepsilon} {dz\over z -\zeta}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the first integral the integrand is a trigonometric polynomial in ''z'' and ζ and so the integral is a trigonometric polynomial in ζ. It tends in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to the trigonometric polynomial

:&lt;math&gt;{1\over \pi i} \int {f(z)-f(\zeta)\over z -\zeta}\, dz.&lt;/math&gt;

The integral in the second term can be calculated by the [[principle of the argument]]. It tends in L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to the constant function 1, so that

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\varepsilon\to 0} H_\varepsilon^h f(\zeta) = f(\zeta) + {1\over \pi i} \int {f(z)-f(\zeta)\over z -\zeta}\, dz,&lt;/math&gt;

where the limit is in L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. On the other hand, the right hand side is imdependent of the diffeomorphism. Since for the identity diffeomorphism, the left hand side equals ''Hf'', it too equals ''Hf'' (this can also be checked directly if ''f'' is a trigonometric polynomial). Finally, letting ε → 0,

:&lt;math&gt;(VH V^{-1}- H) f(e^{i\varphi}) = \frac{1}{\pi} \int \left[{g^\prime(\theta) e^{ig(\theta)} \over e^{ig(\theta)} - e^{ig(\varphi)}} - {e^{i\theta} \over e^{i\theta} - e^{i\varphi}}\right]\,f(e^{i\theta})\, d\theta.&lt;/math&gt;

The direct method of evaluating Fourier coefficients to prove the uniform boundedness of the operator ''H''&lt;sup&gt;ε&lt;/sup&gt; does not generalize directly to ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' spaces with 1 &lt; ''p'' &lt; ∞. Instead a direct comparison of ''H''&lt;sup&gt;ε&lt;/sup&gt;''f'' with the [[Poisson integral]] of the Hilbert transform is used classically to prove this. If ''f'' has Fourier series

:&lt;math&gt;f(e^{i\theta})=\sum_{n\in \mathbf{Z}} a_n e^{in\theta},&lt;/math&gt;

its Poisson integral is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{P_rf(e^{i\theta})=\sum_{n\in \mathbf{Z}} a_n r^{|n|} e^{in\theta}={1\over 2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} {(1-r^2)f(e^{i\theta})\over 1-2r\cos\theta + r^2}\,d\theta =K_r\star f(e^{i\theta}),}&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[Poisson kernel]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{K_r(e^{i\theta})=\sum_{n\in \mathbf{Z}} r^{|n|}e^{in\theta} ={1-r^2\over 1 - 2r\cos\theta + r^2}.}&lt;/math&gt;

In ''f'' is in L&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;('''T''') then the operators ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; satisfy

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\|P_rf - f\|_p\rightarrow 0.}&lt;/math&gt;

In fact the ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; are positive so

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\|K_r\|_1 ={1\over 2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} K_r(e^{i\theta})\, d\theta =1.}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the operators ''P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' have operator norm bounded by 1 on ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''. The convergence statement above follows by continuity from the result for trigonometric polynomials, where it is an immediate consequence of the formula for the Fourier coefficients of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;.

The uniform boundedness of the operator norm of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt; follows because ''HP&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''  − ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1−''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is given as convolution by the function ψ&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;, where&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garnett|2007|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
\psi_r(e^{i\theta}) &amp;=1+\frac{1-r}{1+ r} \cot \left(\tfrac{\theta}{2} \right ) K_r(e^{i\theta}) \\
&amp;\le 1+ \frac{1-r}{1+r} \cot \left (\tfrac{1-r}{2} \right ) K_r(e^{i\theta})
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

for  1 − ''r'' ≤ |θ| ≤ π, and, for |θ| &lt; 1 − ''r'',

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\psi_r(e^{i\theta})=1+ {2r\sin \theta\over 1-2r\cos\theta +r^2}.}&lt;/math&gt;

These estimates show that the ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; norms ∫ |ψ&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;| are uniformly bounded. Since ''H'' is a bounded operator, it follows that the operators ''H''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt; are uniformly bounded in operator norm on ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''). The same argument can be used on ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T''') once it is known that the Hilbert transform ''H'' is bounded in operator norm on ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T''').

===Hilbert transform on the real line===
{{See also|Hilbert transform}}
As in the case of the circle, the theory for L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; functions is particularly easy to develop. In fact, as observed by Rosenblum and Devinatz, the two Hilbert transforms can be related using the Cayley transform.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Devinatz|1967}}
*{{harvnb|Rosenblum|Rovnyak|1997}}
*{{harvnb|Rosenblum|Rovnyak|1994}}
*{{harvnb|Nikolski|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hilbert transform''' ''H''&lt;sub&gt;'''R'''&lt;/sub&gt; on L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''R''') is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\widehat{H_{\mathbf{R}} f} = \left (i\chi_{[0,\infty)} -i\chi_{(-\infty,0]} \right ) \widehat{f},&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[Fourier transform]] is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\widehat{f}(t)={1\over \sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x) e^{-itx} \, dx.}&lt;/math&gt;

Define the Hardy space H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''R''') to be the closed subspace of L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''R''') consisting of functions for which the Fourier transform vanishes on the negative part of the real axis. Its orthogonal complement is given by functions for which the Fourier transform vanishes on the positive part of the real axis. It is the complex conjugate of H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''). If ''P''&lt;sub&gt;'''R'''&lt;/sub&gt; is the orthogonal projection onto H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''), then

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{H_{\mathbf{R}}=i(2P_{\mathbf{R}}-I).}&lt;/math&gt;

The Cayley transform

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{C(x)={x-i\over x+i}}&lt;/math&gt;

carries the extended real line onto the circle, sending the point at ∞ to 1, and the upper halfplane onto the unit disk.

Define the unitary operator from L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''T''') onto L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''R''') by

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{Uf(x)=\pi^{-1/2} (x+i)^{-1} f(C(x)).}&lt;/math&gt;

This operator carries the Hardy space of the circle H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''T''') onto H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''R''').  In fact for |''w''| &lt; 1, the linear span of the functions

:&lt;math&gt;f_w(z)= \frac{1}{1-w z}&lt;/math&gt;

is dense in H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''). Moreover,

:&lt;math&gt;Uf_w(x)= \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}} \frac{1}{(1-w)(x-\overline{z})}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{z=C^{-1}(\overline{w}).}&lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, for ''z'' ∈ '''H''', the linear span of the functions

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{g_z(t)=e^{itz}\chi_{[0,\infty)}(t)}&lt;/math&gt;

is dense in L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;((0,∞)). By the [[Fourier inversion formula]], they are the Fourier transforms of

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{h_z(x)=\widehat{g_z}(-x)={i\over \sqrt{2\pi}} (x + z)^{-1},}&lt;/math&gt;

so the linear span of these functions is dense in H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''). Since ''U'' carries the ''f''&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'s onto multiples of the ''h''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'s, it follows that ''U'' carries H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''T''') onto H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''). Thus

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{UH_{\mathbf{T}} U^* = H_{\mathbf{R}}.}&lt;/math&gt;

In {{harvtxt|Nikolski|1986}}, part of the L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; theory on the real line and the upper halfplane is developed by transferring the results from the circle and the unit disk. The natural replacements for concentric circles in the disk are lines parallel to the real axis in '''H'''. Under the Cayley transform these correspond to circles in the disk that are tangent to the unit circle at the point one. The behaviour of functions in H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''T''') on these circles is part of the theory of [[Carleson measure]]s. The theory of singular integrals, however, can be developed more easily by working directly on '''R'''.

H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''R''') consists exactly of L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; functions ''f'' that arise of boundary values of holomorphic functions on '''H''' in the following sense:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stein|Shakarchi|2005|pp=213–221}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''f''  is in H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; provided that there is a holomorphic function ''F''(''z'') on '''H''' such that the functions ''f&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') = ''f''(''x'' + ''iy'') for ''y'' &gt; 0 are in L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''f&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' tends to ''f'' in L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; as ''y'' → 0. In this case ''F'' is necessarily unique and given by [[Cauchy's integral formula]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{F(z)={1\over 2\pi i}  \int_{-\infty}^\infty {f(s)\over s-z}\, ds.}&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, identifying H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(0,∞) via the Fourier transform, for ''y'' &gt; 0 multiplication by ''e''&lt;sup&gt;−''yt''&lt;/sup&gt; on L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(0,∞) induces a contraction semigroup ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; on H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Hence for ''f'' in L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{{1\over 2\pi i} \int_{-\infty}^\infty {f(s)\over s-z}\, ds ={1\over \sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(s) \widehat{g_z}(s) \, ds  = {1\over \sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \widehat{f}(s) g_z(s) \, ds= V_yPf(x).}&lt;/math&gt;

If ''f'' is in H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''F''(''z'') is holomorphic for Im ''z'' &gt; 0, since the family of L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; functions ''g&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' depends holomorphically on ''z''.  Moreover, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''V&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;f'' tends to ''f'' in ''H''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; since this is true for the Fourier transforms. Conversely if such an ''F'' exists, by Cauchy's integral theorem and the above identity applied to ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{f_{y+t}=V_t Pf_y}&lt;/math&gt;

for ''t'' &gt; 0. Letting ''t'' tend to ''0'', it follows that ''Pf&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''f&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', so that ''f&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' lies in H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. But then so too does the limit ''f''. Since

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{V_t f_y=f_{y+t}=V_y f_t,}&lt;/math&gt;

uniqueness of ''F'' follows from

:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle{f_t=\lim_{y\rightarrow 0} f_{y+t}=\lim_{y\rightarrow 0} V_t f_y = V_t f.}&lt;/math&gt;

For ''f'' in L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the '''truncated Hilbert transforms''' are defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
H_{\varepsilon,R} f(x) &amp;={1\over \pi}\int_{\varepsilon \le |y-x|\le R} {f(y)\over x-y} \, dy ={1\over \pi}\int_{\varepsilon \le |y|\le R} {f(x-y)\over y}\, dy \\
H_{\varepsilon} f(x) &amp;={1\over \pi}\int_{ |y-x|\ge \varepsilon} {f(y)\over x-y} \, dy ={1\over \pi} \int_{ |y|\ge \varepsilon} {f(x-y)\over y}\, dy.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The operators ''H''&lt;sub&gt;ε,''R''&lt;/sub&gt; are convolutions by bounded functions of compact support, so their operator norms are given by the uniform norm of their Fourier transforms. As before the absolute values have the form

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{{1\over \sqrt{2\pi}}\left|\int_a^b { 2 \sin t \over t} \, dt\right|.}&lt;/math&gt;

with 0 &lt; ''a'' &lt; ''b'', so the operators ''H''&lt;sub&gt;ε,''R''&lt;/sub&gt; are uniformly bounded in operator norm. Since ''H''&lt;sub&gt;ε,''R''&lt;/sub&gt;''f'' tends to ''H''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt;''f'' in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for ''f'' with compact support, and hence for arbitrary ''f'', the operators ''H''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt; are also uniformly bounded in operator norm.

To prove that ''H''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt; ''f'' tends to ''Hf'' as ε tends to zero, it suffices to check this on a dense set of functions. On the other hand,

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\overline{H_\varepsilon f} = -  H_\varepsilon( \overline{f}),}&lt;/math&gt;

so it suffices to prove that ''H''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt;''f'' tends to ''if'' for a dense set of functions in H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''), for example the Fourier transforms of smooth functions ''g'' with compact support in (0,∞). But the Fourier transform ''f'' extends to an entire function  ''F'' on '''C''', which is bounded on Im(''z'') ≥ 0. The same is true of the derivatives of ''g''. Up to a scalar these correspond to multiplying ''F''(''z'') by powers of ''z''. Thus ''F'' satisfies a [[Paley-Wiener theorem|Payley-Wiener estimate]] for Im(''z'') ≥ 0:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hörmander|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{|F^{(m)}(z)|\le K_{N,m} (1+|z|)^{-N}}&lt;/math&gt;

for any ''m'', ''N'' ≥ 0. In particular, the integral defining ''H''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt;''f''(''x'') can be computed by taking a standard semicircle contour centered on ''x''. It consists of a large semicircle with radius ''R'' and a small circle radius ε with the two portions of the real axis between them. By Cauchy's theorem, the integral round the contour is zero. The integral round the large contour tends to zero by the Paley-Wiener estimate. The integral on the real axis is the limit sought. It is therefore given as minus the limit on the small semicircular contour. But this is the limit of

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{{1\over \pi} \int_{\Gamma} {F(z)\over z-x} \, dz.}&lt;/math&gt;

Where Γ is the small semicircular contour, oriented anticlockwise. By the usual techniques of contour integration, this limit equals ''if''(''x'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Titchmarsh|1939|102–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, it is easy to check that the convergence is dominated in L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; since

:&lt;math&gt;H_\varepsilon f(x)=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{|y-x|\ge \varepsilon} \frac{f(y)-f(x)}{y-x}\,dy=\frac{1}{\pi} \int_{|y-x|\ge \varepsilon} \int_0^1 f^\prime(x+t(y-x))\,dt\, dy&lt;/math&gt;

so that convergence is dominated by

:&lt;math&gt;G(x)=\frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^1\int_{-\infty}^\infty |f^\prime(x+ty)|\,dy&lt;/math&gt;

which is in L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; by the Paley-Wiener estimate.

It follows that for ''f'' on ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''R''')

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{H_\varepsilon f \rightarrow H f.}&lt;/math&gt;

This can also be deduced directly because, after passing to Fourier transforms, ''H''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt; and ''H'' become multiplication operators by uniformly bounded functions. The multipliers for ''H''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt; tend pointwise almost everywhere to the multiplier for ''H'', so the statement above follows from the [[dominated convergence theorem]] applied to the Fourier transforms.

As for the Hilbert transform on the circle, ''H''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt;''f'' tends to ''Hf'' pointwise almost everywhere if ''f'' is an L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; function. In fact, define the [[Poisson integral|Poisson operators]] on L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; functions by

:&lt;math&gt;T_y f(x)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty P_y(x-t)f(t)\, dt,&lt;/math&gt;

where the Poisson kernel is given by

:&lt;math&gt;P_y(x)=\frac{y}{\pi( x^2 +y^2)}.&lt;/math&gt;

for ''y'' &gt; 0. Its Fourier transform is

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\widehat{P_y}(t)=e^{-y|t|},}&lt;/math&gt;

from which it is easy to see that ''T&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;f'' tends to ''f'' in L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; as ''y'' increases to 0. Moreover, as Lebesgue proved,  
''T&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;f''  also tends pointwise to ''f'' at each [[Lebesgue point]] of ''f''. On the other hand, it is also known that ''T&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;Hf'' – ''H&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;f'' tends to zero at each Lebesgue point of ''f''. Hence ''H''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt;''f'' tends pointwise to ''f'' on the common Lebesgue points of ''f'' and ''Hf'' and therefore almost everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Krantz|1999}}
*{{harvnb|Torchinsky|1986}}
*{{harvnb|Duoandikoetxea|2001|pp=49–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stein|Shakarchi|2005|pp=112–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The absolute values of the functions ''T&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;f'' − ''f'' and ''T&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;Hf'' – ''H&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;f'' can be bounded pointwise by multiples of the maximal function of ''f''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stein|Weiss|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the Hilbert transform on the circle, the uniform boundedness of the operator norms of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt; follows from that of the ''T''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt; if ''H'' is known to be bounded, since ''HT''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt; − ''H''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt; is the convolution operator by the function

:&lt;math&gt;g_\varepsilon(x) = \begin{cases}
\frac{x}{\pi( x^2 +\varepsilon^2)} &amp; |x|\le \varepsilon \\
\frac{x}{\pi( x^2 +\varepsilon^2)} -\frac{1}{\pi x} &amp; |x| &gt;\varepsilon
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; norms of these functions are uniformly bounded.

===Riesz transforms in the complex plane===
{{Main|Riesz transform}}
The complex Riesz transforms ''R'' and ''R''* in the complex plane are the unitary operators on L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''C''') defined as multiplication by ''z''/|''z''| and its conjugate on the Fourier transform of an L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; function ''f'':

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\widehat{Rf}(z)={\overline{z}\over |z|} \widehat{f}(z),\,\,\, \widehat{R^*f}(z)={z\over |z|} \widehat{f}(z).}&lt;/math&gt;

Idenitifying '''C''' with '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''R'' and ''R''* are given by

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{R=-iR_1 + R_2,\,\,\, R^*=-iR_1 - R_2,}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the Riesz transforms on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; defined below.

On  L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''C'''), the operator ''R'' and its integer powers are unitary. They can also be expressed as singular integral operators:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Astala|Ivaniecz|Martin|2009|pp=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{R^kf(w)=\lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0} \int_{|z-w|\ge \varepsilon} M_k(w-z)f(z)\,dx\, dy,}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{M_k(z)={k\over 2\pi i^k} {z^k \over |z|^{k+2}} \,\,\,\, (k\ge 1), \,\,\,\, M_{-k}(z) =\overline{M_k(z)}.}&lt;/math&gt;

Defining the truncated higher Riesz transforms as

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{R^{(k)}_\varepsilon f(w)=\int_{|z-w|\ge \varepsilon} M_k(w-z)f(z)\,dx\, dy,}&lt;/math&gt;

these operators can be shown to be uniformly bounded in operator norm. For odd powers this can be deduced by the method of rotation of Calderón and Zygmund, described below.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grafakos|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the operators are known to be bounded in operator norm it can also be deduced using the Poisson operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stein|Weiss|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Poisson operators ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are defined for ''s'' &gt; 0 by

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{T_sf(x) ={1\over 2\pi}\int_{\mathbf{R}^2} {s f(x)\over (|x-t|^2 + s^2)^{3/2}}\, dt.}&lt;/math&gt;

They are given by convolution with the functions

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{P_s(x)= {s\over 2\pi(|x|^2 + s^2)^{3/2} }.}&lt;/math&gt;

''P''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is the Fourier transform of the function ''e''&lt;sup&gt;− ''s''|''x''|&lt;/sup&gt;, so under the Fourier transform they correspond to multiplication by these functions and form a contraction semigroup on L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).  Since ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; is positive and integrable with integral 1, the operators ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; also define a contraction semigroup on each L&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; space with 1 &lt; ''p'' &lt;  ∞.

The higher Riesz transforms of the Poisson kernel can be computed:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{R^kP_s(z)={k\over 2\pi i^k} {z^k \over (|z|^2 +s^2)^{k/2+1}}}&lt;/math&gt;

for ''k'' ≥ 1 and the complex conjugate for − ''k''. Indeed, the right hand side is a harmonic function ''F''(''x'',''y'',''s'') of three variable and for such functions&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stein|Weiss|1971|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{T_{s_1} F(x,y,s_2) = F(x,y,s_1+s_2).}&lt;/math&gt;

As before the operators

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{T_\varepsilon R^k - R^{(k)}_\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt;

are given by convolution with integrable functions and have uniformly bounded operator norms. Since the Riesz transforms are unitary on L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''C'''), the uniform boundedness of the truncated Riesz transforms implies that they converge in the strong operator topology to the corresponding Riesz transforms.

The uniform boundedness of the difference between the transform and the truncated transform can also be seen for odd ''k'' using the Calderón-Zygmund method of rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grafakos|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stein|Weiss|1971|pp=222–223}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group '''T''' acts by rotation on functions on '''C''' via

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{U_\theta f(z)=f(e^{i\theta}z).}&lt;/math&gt;

This defines a unitary representation on L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''C''') and the unitary operators ''R''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; commute with the Fourier transform. If ''A'' is a bounded operator on L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''R''') then it defines a bounded operator ''A''&lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt; on
L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''C''') simply by making ''A'' act on the first coordinate. With the identification L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''R''') ⊗ L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''), ''A''&lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt; = ''A'' ⊗ ''I''. If φ is a continuous function on the circle then a new operator can be defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{B ={1\over 2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \varphi(\theta) U_\theta A^{(1)} U_\theta^* \, d\theta.}&lt;/math&gt;

This definition is understood in the sense that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{(Bf,g) ={1\over 2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \varphi(\theta) (U_\theta A^{(1)} U_\theta^*f,g) \, d\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

for any ''f'', ''g'' in L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''C'''). It follows that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\| B \| \le {1\over 2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} |\varphi(\theta)| \cdot\|A\|\, d\theta.}&lt;/math&gt;

Taking ''A'' to be the Hilbert transform ''H'' on ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''R''') or its truncation ''H''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt;, it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
R &amp;={1\over 2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} e^{-i\theta} U_\theta H^{(1)} U_\theta^* \, d\theta,\\
R_\varepsilon &amp;={1\over 2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} e^{-i\theta} U_\theta H^{(1)}_\varepsilon U_\theta^* \, d\theta.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Taking adjoints gives a similar formuls for ''R*'' and its truncation.  This gives a second way to verify estimate the norms of ''R'', ''R''* and their truncations. It has the advantage of being applicable also for ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' spaces.

The Poisson operators can also be used to show that the truncated higher Riesz transforms of a function tend to the higher Riesz transform at the common Lebesgue points of the function and its transform. Indeed, (''R&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;T''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt; − ''R''&lt;sup&gt;(''k'')&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt;)''f'' → 0 at each Lebesgue point of ''f''; while (''R&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'' − ''R&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;T''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt;)''f'' → 0 at each Lebesgue point of ''R&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;f''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stein|Weiss|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beurling transform in the complex plane===
{{see also|Beltrami equation}}
Since

:&lt;math&gt;{\overline{z}\over z}= \left({\overline{z}\over |z|}\right)^2,&lt;/math&gt;

the Beurling transform ''T'' on ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the unitary operator equal to ''R''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This relation has been used classically in {{harvtxt|Vekua|1962}} and {{harvtxt|Ahlfors|1966}} to establish the continuity properties of ''T'' on ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' spaces. The results on the Riesz transform and its powers show that ''T'' is  the limit in the strong operator topology of the truncated operators

:&lt;math&gt;T_\varepsilon f(w)=-\frac{1}{\pi}\iint_{|z-w|\ge \varepsilon} \frac{f(z)}{(w-z)^2} dxdy.&lt;/math&gt;

Accordingly, ''Tf'' can be written as a Cauchy principal value integral:

:&lt;math&gt;Tf(w)=-\frac{1}{\pi} P.V. \iint \frac{f(z)}{(w-z)^2} dxdy=-\frac{1}{\pi}\lim_{\varepsilon \to 0}\iint_{|z-w|\ge \varepsilon} \frac{f(z)}{(w-z)^2} dxdy.&lt;/math&gt;

From the description of ''T'' and ''T''* on Fourier transforms, it follows that if ''f'' is smooth of compact support

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
T(\partial_{\overline{z}} f) &amp;=\partial_z Tf, \\
T^*(\partial_z f) =\partial_{\overline{z}} T^*f.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Like the Hilbert transform in one dimension, the Beurling transform has a compatibility with conformal changes of coordinate. Let Ω be a bounded region in '''C''' with smooth boundary ∂Ω and let φ be a univalent holomorphic map of the [[unit disk]] ''D'' onto Ω extending to a smooth diffeomorphism of the circle onto ∂Ω. If χ&lt;sub&gt;Ω&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[indicator function|characteristic function]] of  Ω, the operator can χ&lt;sub&gt;Ω&lt;/sub&gt;''T''χ&lt;sub&gt;Ω&lt;/sub&gt; defines an operaror ''T''(Ω) on L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω). Through the conformal map φ, it induces an operator, also denoted ''T''(Ω), on L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''D'') which can be compared with ''T''(''D''). The same is true of the truncations ''T''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt;(Ω) and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt;(''D'').

Let ''U''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt; be the disk |''z'' − ''w''| &lt; ε and ''V''&lt;sup&gt;ε&lt;/sup&gt; the region |φ(''z'') − φ(''w'')|  &lt; ε. On ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''D'')

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
T_\varepsilon(\Omega)f(w) &amp;= -\frac{1}{\pi} \iint_{D\backslash V_\varepsilon} \left [{\varphi^\prime(w)\varphi^\prime(z) \over (\varphi(z)-\varphi(w))^2}f(z)\right ]dxdy,\\
 T_\varepsilon(D)f(w) &amp;=-{1\over \pi} \iint_{D\backslash U_\varepsilon} {f(z) \over (z-w)^2}dxdy,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and the operator norms of these truncated operators are uniformly bounded. On the other hand, if

:&lt;math&gt;T^\prime_\varepsilon(D)f(w) = -{1\over \pi} \iint_{D\backslash V_\varepsilon} \frac{f(z)}{(z-w)^2} dxdy,&lt;/math&gt;

then the difference between this operator and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt;(Ω) is a truncated operator with smooth kernel ''K''(''w'',''z''):

:&lt;math&gt;K(w,z)=-{1\over \pi} \left[{\varphi^\prime(w)\varphi^\prime(z)\over (\varphi(z)-\varphi(w))^2} -{1\over (z-w)^2}\right].&lt;/math&gt;

So the operators ''T′''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt;(''D'') must also have uniformly bounded operator norms. To see that their difference tends to 0 in the strong operator topology, it is enough to check this for ''f'' smooth of compact support in ''D''. By Green's theorem&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Astala|Iwaniecz|Martin|2009|pp=93–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left (T_\varepsilon(D)-T^\prime_\varepsilon(D) \right )f(w)= \frac{1}{\pi}\iint_{U_\varepsilon} {\partial_zf(z)\over z-w}dxdy-{1\over \pi}\iint_{V_\varepsilon} {\partial_zf(z)\over z-w}dxdy+{1\over 2\pi i}\int_{\partial U_\varepsilon} \frac{f(z)}{z-w}d\overline{z}-\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\partial V_\varepsilon} {f(z)\over z-w}\, d\overline{z}.&lt;/math&gt;

All four terms on the right hand side tend to 0. Hence the difference ''T''(Ω) − ''T''(''D'') is the [[Hilbert–Schmidt operator]] with kernel ''K''.

For pointwise convergence there is simple argument due to {{harvtxt|Mateu|Verdera|2006}} showing that the truncated integrals converge to ''Tf'' precisely at its Lebesgue points, that is almost everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Astala|Iwaniecz|Martin|2009|pp=97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact ''T'' has the following symmetry property for ''f'', ''g'' ∈ ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''C''')

:&lt;math&gt;\iint (Tf) g = -{1\over \pi}\lim \int_{|z-w|\ge \varepsilon} \frac{f(w)g(z)}{(w-z)^2} =\iint f (Tg).&lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, if χ is the [[characteristic function]]{{disambiguation needed|date=March 2017}} of the disk ''D''(''z'',ε) with centre ''z'' and radius ε, then

:&lt;math&gt;T\chi(w) = -\varepsilon^2 \frac{1-\chi(w)}{(w-z)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence

:&lt;math&gt;T_\varepsilon(f)(z)={1\over \pi\varepsilon^2}\iint f (T\chi)= {1\over \pi\varepsilon^2}\iint (Tf)\chi = \mathbf{Av}_{D(z,\varepsilon)}\, Tf.&lt;/math&gt;

By the [[Lebesgue differentiation theorem]], the right hand side converges to ''Tf'' at the Lebesgue points of ''Tf''.

===Riesz transforms in higher dimensions===
{{Main|Riesz transform}}
For ''f'' in the Schwartz space of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, the ''j''th '''Riesz transform''' is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;R_j f(x) =c_n\lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \int_{|y|\ge \varepsilon} f(x-y){y_j\over |y|^{n+1}}dy= \frac{c_n}{n-1}\int \partial_j f(x-y){1\over |y|^{n-1}} dy,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;c_n=\Gamma\left(\tfrac{n+1}{2}\right)\pi^{-\frac{n+1}{2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Under the Fourier transform:

:&lt;math&gt;\widehat{R_j f}(t)={it_j\over |t|}\widehat{f}(t).&lt;/math&gt;

Thus ''R&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' corresponds to the operator ∂&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;Δ&lt;sup&gt;−1/2&lt;/sup&gt;, where Δ = −∂&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ... −∂&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the Laplacian on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. By definition ''R&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a bounded and skew-adjoint operator for the ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; norm and

:&lt;math&gt;R_1^2 + \cdots + R_n^2 = -I.&lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding truncated operators

:&lt;math&gt;R_{j,\varepsilon} f(x) =c_n\int_{|y|\ge \varepsilon} f(x-y){y_j\over |y|^{n+1}} dy&lt;/math&gt;

are uniformly bounded in the operator norm. This can either be proved directly or can be established by the '''Calderón−Zygmund method of rotations''' for the group SO(''n'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grafokos|2008|pp=272–274}}&lt;/ref&gt; This expresses the operators ''R&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' and their truncations in terms of the Hilbert transforms in one dimension and its truncations. In fact if ''G'' = SO(''n'') with normalised Haar measure and ''H''&lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt; is the Hilbert transform in the first coordinate, then

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
R_j &amp;=\int_G \varphi(g) gH^{(1)}g^{-1} \, dg, \\
R_{j,\varepsilon} &amp;=\int_G \varphi(g) gH_\varepsilon^{(1)} g^{-1} \, dg, \\
R_{j,\varepsilon,R} &amp;=\int_G \varphi(g) gH_{\varepsilon,R}^{(1)} g^{-1} \, dg.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where φ(''g'') is the (1,''j'') matrix coefficient of ''g''.

In particular for ''f'' ∈ ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''j'',ε&lt;/sub&gt;''f'' → ''R&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;f'' in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''j'',ε&lt;/sub&gt;''f'' tends to ''R&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' almost everywhere. This can be proved exactly as for the Hilbert transform by using the Poisson operators defined on ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) when '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is regarded as the boundary of a halfspace in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;. Alternatively it can be proved directly from the result for the Hilbert transform on '''R''' using the expression of ''R&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' as an integral over ''G''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grafakos|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stein|Weiss|1971|pp=222–223, 236–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Poisson operators ''T&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; are defined for ''y'' &gt; 0 by&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stein|Weiss|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;T_yf(x) =c_n\int_{\mathbf{R}^n} \frac{y f(x)}{\left (|x-t|^2 + y^2 \right )^{\frac{n+1}{2}}} dt.&lt;/math&gt;

They are given by convolution with the functions

:&lt;math&gt;P_y(x)=c_n \frac{y}{\left (|x|^2 + y^2 \right )^{\frac{n+1}{2}}}.&lt;/math&gt;

''P''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; is the Fourier transform of the function ''e''&lt;sup&gt;−''y''|''x''|&lt;/sup&gt;, so under the Fourier transform they correspond to multiplication by these functions and form a contraction semigroup on L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;).  Since ''P&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' is positive and integrable with integral 1, the operators ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; also define a contraction semigroup on each ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' space with 1 &lt; ''p'' &lt;  ∞.

The Riesz transforms of the Poisson kernel can be computed

:&lt;math&gt;R_j P_\varepsilon(x)= c_n \frac{x_j}{\left(|x|^2 + \varepsilon^2 \right)^{\frac{n+1}{2}}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The operator ''R&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;T''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt; is given by convolution with this function. It can be checked directly that the operators ''R&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;T''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt; − ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''j'',ε&lt;/sub&gt; are given by convolution with functions uniformly bounded in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; norm. The operator norm of the difference is therefore uniformly bounded. We have (''R&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;T''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt; − ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''j'',ε&lt;/sub&gt;)''f'' → 0 at each Lebesgue point of ''f''; while (''R&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' − ''R&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;T''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt;)''f'' → 0 at each Lebesgue point of ''R&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;f''. So ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''j'',ε&lt;/sub&gt;''f'' → ''R&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;f'' on the common Lebesgue points of ''f'' and ''R&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;f''.

==L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; theory==

===Elementary proofs of M. Riesz theorem===
The theorem of [[Marcel Riesz]] asserts that singular integral operators that are continuous for the {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} norm are also continuous in the {{math|''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''}} norm for {{math|1 &lt; ''p'' &lt; ∞}} and that the operator norms vary continuously with {{mvar|p}}.

====Bochner's proof for Hilbert transform on the circle&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grafakos|2005|p=215−216}}&lt;/ref&gt;====
Once it is established that the operator norms of the Hilbert transform on {{math|''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T''')}} are bounded for even integers, it follows from the [[Riesz–Thorin interpolation theorem]] and duality that they are bounded for all {{mvar|p}} with {{math|1 &lt; ''p'' &lt; ∞}} and that the norms vary continuously with {{mvar|p}}. Moreover, the arguments with the Poisson integral can be applied to show that the truncated Hilbert transforms {{math|''H&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are uniformly bounded in operator norm and converge in the strong operator topology to {{mvar|H}}.

It is enough to prove the bound for real trigonometric polynomials without constant term:

:&lt;math&gt;f \left (e^{i\theta} \right ) = \sum_{m=1}^N a_m e^{im\theta} + a_{-m} e^{-im\theta}, \qquad a_{-m}=\overline{a_m}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since ''f'' + ''iHf'' is a polynomial in {{math|''e&lt;sup&gt;iθ&lt;/sup&gt;''}} without constant term

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} (f+iHf)^{2n} \, d\theta = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, taking the real part and using [[Hölder's inequality]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\|Hf\|_{2n}^{2n} \le \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} {2n\choose 2k} \left | \left ((Hf)^{2k},f^{2n-2k} \right ) \right |\le \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} {2n\choose 2k} \|Hf\|_{2n}^{2k}\cdot\|f\|_{2n}^{2n-2k}.&lt;/math&gt;

So the M. Riesz theorem follows by induction for {{mvar|p}} an even integer and hence for all {{mvar|p}} with {{math|1 &lt; ''p'' &lt; ∞}}.

====Cotlar's proof for Hilbert transform on the line&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grafakos|2005|p=255−257}}&lt;/ref&gt;====
Once it is established that the operator norms of the Hilbert transform on {{math|''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''R''')}} are bounded when {{mvar|p}} is a power of 2, it follows from the [[Riesz–Thorin interpolation theorem]] and duality that they are bounded for all {{mvar|p}} with {{math|1 &lt; ''p'' &lt; ∞}} and that the norms vary continuously with {{mvar|p}}. Moreover, the arguments with the Poisson integral can be applied to show that the truncated Hilbert transforms {{math|''H&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are uniformly bounded in operator norm and converge in the strong operator topology to {{mvar|H}}.

It is enough to prove the bound when ''f'' is a Schwartz function. In that case the following identity of Cotlar holds:

:&lt;math&gt;(Hf)^2= f^2 + 2H(fH(f)).&lt;/math&gt;  
 
In fact, write ''f'' = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; + ''f''&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt; according to the {{math|±''i''}} eigenspaces of ''H''. Since ''f'' ± ''iHf'' extend to holomorphic functions in the upper and lower half plane, so too do their squares. Hence

:&lt;math&gt;f^2 -(Hf)^2= \left (f_+ + f_- \right )^2 + \left (f_+-f_- \right )^2 =2 \left (f_+^2 + f_-^2 \right )=-2iH \left (f_+^2 -f_-^2 \right )=-2H(f(Hf)).&lt;/math&gt;

(Cotlar's identity can also be verified directly by taking Fourier transforms.)

Hence, assuming the M. Riesz theorem for {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}},

:&lt;math&gt;\|Hf\|^2_{2^{n+1}} = \left \|(Hf)^2 \right \|_{2^n} \le \left \|f^2 \right \|_{2^n} + 2 \|H(fH(f))\|_{2^n} \le \|f\|_{2^{n+1}}^2 + 2 \|H\|_{2^n} \|f\|_{2^{n+1}} \|Hf\|_{2^{n+1}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since

:&lt;math&gt;R^2 &gt; 1 + 2 \|H\|_{2^n} R&lt;/math&gt;

for {{mvar|R}} sufficiently large, the M. Riesz theorem must also hold for {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

Exactly the same method works for the Hilbert transform on the circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gohberg|Krupnik|1992|pp=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same identity of Cotlar is easily verified on trigonometric polynomials ''f'' by writing them as the sum of the terms with non-negative and negative exponents, i.e. the {{math|±''i''}} eigenfunctions of {{mvar|H}}. The {{math|''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''}} bounds can therefore be established when {{mvar|p}} is a power of 2 and follow in general by interpolation and duality.

====Calderón–Zygmund method of rotation====
The method of rotation for Riesz transforms and their truncations applies equally well on {{math|''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''}} spaces for {{math|1 &lt; ''p'' &lt; ∞}}. Thus these operators can be expressed in terms of the Hilbert transform on {{math|'''R'''}} and its truncations. The integration of the functions {{math|Φ}} from the group {{math|'''T'''}} or {{math|SO(''n'')}} into the space of operators on {{math|''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''}} is taken in the weak sense:

:&lt;math&gt;\left (\int_G \Phi(x)\, dx\, f,g \right ) =\int_G (\Phi(x)f,g)\, dx&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f'' lies in {{math|''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''}} and {{mvar|g}} lies in the [[dual space]] {{math|''L&lt;sup&gt;q&lt;/sup&gt;''}} with {{math|&amp;thinsp;{{sfrac|1|''p''}} + {{sfrac|1|''q''}}.}} It follows that Riesz transforms are bounded on {{math|''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''}} and that the differences with their truncations are also uniformly bounded. The continuity of the {{math|''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''}} norms of a fixed Riesz transform is a consequence of the [[Riesz–Thorin interpolation theorem]].

===Pointwise convergence===
{{see also|Fatou's theorem}}
The proofs of pointwise convergence for Hilbert and Riesz transforms rely on the [[Lebesgue differentiation theorem]], which can be proved using the [[Hardy-Littlewood maximal function]].&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Stein|Weiss|1971|pp=12–13}}
*{{harvnb|Torchinsky|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The techniques for the simplest and best known case, namely the Hilbert transform on the circle, are a prototype for all the other transforms. This case is explained in detail here.

Let ''f'' be  in L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;('''T''') for ''p'' &gt; 1. The Lebesgue differentiation theorem states that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{A(\varepsilon)= {1\over 2\varepsilon}\int_{x-\varepsilon}^{x+\varepsilon} |f(t)-f(x)| \, dt \to 0}&lt;/math&gt;

for almost all ''x'' in '''T'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Torchinsky|2005|pp=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Katznelson|2004|pp=10–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stein|Shakarchi|112-114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The points at which this holds are called the '''Lebesgue points''' of ''f''. Using this theorem it follows that if ''f'' is an integrable function on the circle, the Poisson integral ''T&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;f''  tends pointwise to ''f'' at each [[Lebesgue point]] of ''f''. In fact, for ''x'' fixed, ''A''(ε) is  a continuous function on [0,π]. Continuity at 0 follows because ''x'' is a Lebesgue point and elsewhere because, if ''h'' is an integrable function, the integral of |h| on intervals of decreasing length tends to 0 by [[Hölder's inequality]].

Letting ''r'' = 1 − ε, the difference can be estimated by two integrals:

:&lt;math&gt;2\pi|T_{r}f(x) - f(x)|=\int_{0}^{2\pi} |(f(x-y)-f(x))P_r(y)|\, dy\le \int_{|y|\le \varepsilon} + \int_{|y|\ge \varepsilon}.&lt;/math&gt;

The Poisson kernel has two important properties for ε small

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sup_{y\in [-\varepsilon,\varepsilon]} |P_{1-\varepsilon}(y)| &amp;\le \varepsilon^{-1}. \\
\sup_{y\notin (-\varepsilon,\varepsilon)} |P_{1-\varepsilon}(y)| &amp;\to 0.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The first integral is bounded by ''A''(ε) by the first inequality so tends to zero as ε goes to 0; the second integral  tends to 0 by the second inequality.

The same reasoning can be used to show that ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1 − ε&lt;/sub&gt;''Hf'' – ''H''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt;''f'' tends to zero at each Lebesgue point of ''f''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garnett|2007|pp=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact the operator ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1 − ε&lt;/sub&gt;''Hf'' has kernel ''Q&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''i'', where the conjugate Poisson kernel ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{Q_r(\theta)={2r\sin \theta\over 1 -2r \cos\theta + r^2}.}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{2\pi|T_{1-\varepsilon} H f(x) - H_\varepsilon f(x)|\le \int_{|y|\le \varepsilon} | f(x-y)-f(x)|\cdot|Q_r(y)|\, dy + \int_{|y|\ge \varepsilon} |f(x-y)-f(x)|\cdot |Q_1(y)-Q_r(y)|\,dy.}&lt;/math&gt;

The conjugate Poisson kernel has two important properties for ε small

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sup_{y\in [-\varepsilon,\varepsilon]} |Q_{1-\varepsilon}(y)| &amp;\le \varepsilon^{-1}.\\
\sup_{y\notin (-\varepsilon,\varepsilon)} |Q_1(y)-Q_{1-\varepsilon}(y)| &amp;\to 0.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Exactly the same reasoning as before shows that the two integrals tend to 0 as ε → 0.

Combining these two limit formulas it follows that ''H''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt;''f'' tends pointwise to ''Hf'' on the common Lebesgue points of ''f'' and ''Hf'' and therefore almost everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krantz|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Torchinsky|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stein|Shakarchi|2005|pp=112–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maximal functions===
{{see also|Hardy–Littlewood maximal function}}
Much of the ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' theory has been developed using maximal functions and maximal transforms. This approach has the advantage that it also extends to L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; spaces in an appropriate "weak" sense and gives refined estimates in ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' spaces for ''p'' &gt; 1. These finer estimates form an important part of the techniques involved in [[Lennart Carleson]]'s solution in 1966 of [[Lusin's conjecture]] that the Fourier series of L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; functions converge almost everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arias de Reyna|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the more rudimentary forms of this approach, the L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; theory is given less precedence: instead there is more emphasis on the L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; theory, in particular its measure-theoretic and probabilistic aspects; results for other ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' spaces are deduced by a form of [[Marcinkiewicz interpolation theorem|interpolation]] between L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and L&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; spaces. The approach is described in numerous textbooks, including the classics {{harvtxt|Zygmund|1977}} and {{harvtxt|Katznelson|2004}}. Katznelson's account is followed here for the particular case of the Hilbert transform of functions in L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''), the case not covered by the development above.&lt;ref&gt;See also:
*{{harvnb|Torchinsky|2005}}
*{{harvnb|Grafakos|2008}}
*{{harvnb|Krantz|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If ''f'' is an L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; function on the circle its maximal function is defined by&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krantz|1999|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{f^*(t)=\sup_{0&lt;h\le \pi}  {1\over 2h} \int_{t-h}^{t+h} |f(s)|\, ds.}&lt;/math&gt;

''f''* is finite almost everywhere and is of weak L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; type. In fact for λ &gt; 0 if

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{E_f(\lambda)=\{x:\,|f(x)| &gt; \lambda\}, \,\, f_\lambda =\chi_{E(\lambda)} f,}&lt;/math&gt;

then&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Katznelson|2004|pp=74–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;m(E_{f^*}(\lambda))\le {8\over \lambda}\int_{E_f(\lambda)} |f|\le {8\|f\|_1\over \lambda},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' denotes Lebesgue measure.

The Hardy−Littlewood inequality above leads to a proof that almost every point ''x'' of '''T''' is a [[Lebesgue point]] of an integrable function ''f'', so that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{\int^{x+h}_{x-h}|f(t)-f(x)|\, dt}{2h} \to 0.}&lt;/math&gt;

In fact let

:&lt;math&gt;\omega(f)(x)=\limsup_{h\to 0} \frac{\int^{x+h}_{x-h}|f(t)-f(x)|\, dt}{2h} \le f^*(x) +|f(x)|.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''g'' is continuous, then the ω(''g'') =0, so that  ω(''f'' − ''g'') = ω(''f''). On the other hand, ''f'' can be approximated arbitrarily closely in L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; by continuous ''g''. Then, using [[Chebychev's inequality]],

:&lt;math&gt;m\{x: \, \omega(f)(x)&gt; \lambda\} =m\{x: \, \omega(f-g)(x)&gt; \lambda\} \le m\{x: \, (f-g)^*(x)&gt; \lambda\} + m\{x: \, |f(x)-g(x)|&gt; \lambda\} \le C\lambda^{-1}\|f-g\|_1.&lt;/math&gt;

The right hand side can be made arbitrarily small, so that ω(''f'') = 0 almost everywhere.

The Poisson integrals of an L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; function ''f'' satisfy&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Katznelson|2004|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{|T_rf|\le f^*.}&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; ''f'' tends to ''f'' pointwise almost everywhere. In fact let

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\Omega(f)=\limsup_{r\rightarrow 1} |T_rf -f|.}&lt;/math&gt;

If ''g'' is continuous, then the difference tends to zero everywhere, so Ω(''f'' − ''g'') = Ω(''f''). On the other hand, ''f'' can be approximated arbitrarily closely in L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; by continuous ''g''. Then, using [[Chebychev's inequality]],

:&lt;math&gt;m\{x: \, \Omega(f)(x)&gt; \lambda\} =m\{x: \, \Omega(f-g)(x)&gt; \lambda\} \le m\{x: \, (f-g)^*(x)&gt; \lambda\} + m\{x: \, |f(x)-g(x)|&gt; \lambda\} \le C\lambda^{-1}\|f-g\|_1.&lt;/math&gt;

The right hand side can be made arbitrarily small, so that Ω(''f'') = 0 almost everywhere. A more refined argument shows that convergence occurs at each Lebesgue point of ''f''.

If ''f'' is integrable the conjugate Poisson integrals are defined and given by convolution by the kernel ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;. This defines ''Hf'' inside |''z''| &lt; 1. To show that ''Hf'' has a radial limit for almost all angles,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Katznelson|2004|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; consider

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{F(z)=\exp (-f(z) -iHf(z)),}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f''(''z'') denotes the extension of ''f'' by Poisson integral. ''F'' is holomorphic in the unit disk with |''F''(''z'')| ≤ 1. The restriction of ''F'' to a countable family of concentric circles gives a sequence of functions in L&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;('''T''') which has a weak ''g'' limit in L&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;('''T''') with Poisson integral ''F''. By the L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; results, ''g'' is the radial limit for almost all angles of ''F''. It follows that ''Hf''(''z'') has a radial limit almost everywhere. This is taken as the definition of ''Hf'' on '''T''', so that ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;''H'' f tends pointwise to ''H'' almost everywhere.  The function ''Hf'' is of weak L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; type.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Katznelson|2004|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inequality used above to prove pointwise convergence for L&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; function with 1 &lt; ''p'' &lt; ∞ make sense for L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; functions by invoking the maximal function. The inequality becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{|H_\varepsilon f - T_{1-\varepsilon}Hf|\le 4f^*.}&lt;/math&gt;

Let

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\omega(f)=\limsup_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0} |H_\varepsilon f - T_{1-\varepsilon}Hf|.}&lt;/math&gt;

If ''g'' is smooth, then the difference tends to zero everywhere, so ω(''f'' − ''g'') = ω(''f''). On the other hand, ''f'' can be approximated arbitrarily closely in L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; by smooth ''g''. Then

:&lt;math&gt;m\{x: \, \omega(f)(x)&gt; \lambda\} =m\{x: \, \omega(f-g)(x)&gt; \lambda\} \le m\{x: \, 4(f-g)^*(x)&gt; \lambda\} \le C\lambda^{-1}\|f-g\|_1.&lt;/math&gt;

The right hand side can be made arbitrarily small, so that ω(''f'') = 0 almost everywhere. Thus the difference for ''f'' tends to zero almost everywhere. A more refined argument can be given&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Katznelson|2004|pp=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; to show that, as in case of  L&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;, the difference tends to zero at all Lebesgue points of ''f''. In combination with the result for the conjugate Poisson integral, it follows that, if ''f'' is in L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''), then ''H''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt;''f'' converges to ''Hf'' almost everywhere, a theorem originally proved by Privalov in 1919.

==General theory==
{{harvtxt|Calderón|Zygmund|1952}} introduced general techniques for studying singular integral operators of convolution type. In Fourier transform the operators are given by multiplication operators. These will yield bounded operators on L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; if the corresponding multiplier function is bounded. To prove boundedness on L&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; spaces, Calderón and Zygmund introduced a method of decomposing L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; functions, generalising the [[rising sun lemma]] of [[F. Riesz]]. This method showed that the operator defined a continuous operator from L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; to the space of functions of weak L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The [[Marcinkiewicz interpolation theorem]] and duality then implies that the singular integral operator is bounded on all L&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; for 1 &lt; ''p'' &lt; ∞. A simple version of this theory is described below for operators on '''R'''. As {{harvtxt|de Leeuw|1965}} showed, results on '''R''' can be deduced from corresponding results for '''T''' by restricting the multiplier to the integers, or equivalently periodizing the kernel of the operator. Corresponding results for the circle were originally established by Marcinkiewicz in 1939. These results generalize to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. They provide an alternative method for showing that the Riesz transforms, the higher Riesz transforms and in particular the Beurling transform define bounded operators on L&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; spaces.&lt;ref&gt;See:

===Calderón-Zygmund decomposition===
{{see also|Rising sun lemma|Calderón–Zygmund lemma}}
Let ''f'' be a non-negative integrable or continuous function on [''a'',''b'']. Let ''I'' = (''a'',''b''). For any open subinterval ''J'' of [''a'',''b''], let ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''J''&lt;/sub&gt; denote the average of |''f''| over ''J''. Let α be a positive constant greater than ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''I''&lt;/sub&gt;. Divide ''I'' into two equal intervals (omitting the midpoint). One of these intervals must satisfy ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''J''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; α since their sum is 2''f''&lt;sub&gt;''I''&lt;/sub&gt; so less than 2α.  Otherwise the interval will satisfy α ≤ ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''J''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 2α. Discard such intervals and repeat the halving process with the remaining interval, discarding intervals using the same criterion. This can be continued indefinitely. The discarded intervals are disjoint and their union is an open set Ω. For points ''x'' in the complement, they lie in a nested set of intervals with lengths decreasing to 0 and on each of which the average of ''f'' is bounded by α. If ''f'' is continuous these averages tend to |''f''(''x'')|. If ''f'' is only integrable this is only true almost everywhere, for it is true at the [[Lebesgue point]]s of ''f'' by the [[Lebesgue differentiation theorem]].  Thus ''f'' satisfies |''f''(x)| ≤ α almost everywhere on  Ω&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;, the complement of Ω. Let ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; be the set of discarded intervals and define the "good" function ''g'' by

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{g(x)= \chi_{J_n}(f)\,\,\, (x\in J_n), \,\,\,\,\,g(x) = f(x)\,\,\, (x\in \Omega^c).}&lt;/math&gt;

By construction |''g''(''x'')| ≤ 2α almost everywhere and

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\|g\|_1 \le \|f\|_1.}&lt;/math&gt;

Combining these two inequalities gives

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\|g\|_p^p \le (2\alpha)^{p-1}\|f\|_1.}&lt;/math&gt;

Define the "bad" function ''b'' by ''b'' = ''f'' − ''g''. Thus ''b'' is 0 off Ω and equal to ''f'' minus its average on ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. So the average of ''b'' on ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is zero and

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\|b\|_1 \le 2\|f\|_1.}&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, since |''b''| ≥ α on Ω

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{m(\Omega)\le \alpha^{-1} \|f\|_1.}&lt;/math&gt;

The decomposition

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{f(x) =g(x) + b(x)}&lt;/math&gt;

is called the '''Calderón–Zygmund decomposition'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Torchinsky|2005|pp=74–76,84–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiplier theorem===
{{see also|Multiplier (Fourier analysis)|Marcinkiewicz interpolation theorem}}
Let ''K''(''x'') be a kernel defined on '''R'''\{0} such that

:&lt;math&gt;W(f)=\lim_{\varepsilon\to 0}\int_{|x|\ge \varepsilon} K(x)f(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

exists as a [[distribution (mathematics)#Tempered distributions and Fourier transform|tempered distribution]] for ''f'' a [[Schwartz function]]. Suppose that the Fourier transform of ''T'' is bounded, so that convolution by ''W'' defines a bounded operator ''T'' on L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''). Then if ''K'' satisfies '''Hörmander's condition'''

:&lt;math&gt;A=\sup_{y\ne 0} \int_{|x|\ge 2|y|}|K(x-y) - K(x)|\, dx &lt;\infty,&lt;/math&gt;

then ''T'' defines a bounded operator on L&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; for 1 &lt; ''p'' &lt; ∞ and a continuous operator from L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; into functions of weak type L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grafakos|2008|pp=290–293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact by the Marcinkiewicz interpolation argument and duality, it suffices to check that if ''f'' is smooth of compact support then

:&lt;math&gt;m\{x:\, |Tf(x)| \ge 2\lambda\} \le (2A+4\|T\|)\cdot \lambda^{-1} \|f\|_1.&lt;/math&gt;

Take a Calderón−Zygmund decomposition of ''f'' as above

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=g(x)+b(x)&lt;/math&gt;

with intervals ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and with α = λμ, where  μ &gt; 0. Then

:&lt;math&gt;m\{x:\, |Tf(x)| \ge 2\lambda\} \le m\{x:\, |Tg(x)| \ge \lambda\} + m\{x:\, |Tb(x)| \ge \lambda\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The term for ''g'' can be estimated using [[Chebychev's inequality#Measure-theoretic statement|Chebychev's inequality]]:

:&lt;math&gt;m\{x:\, |Tg(x)| \ge 2\lambda\} \le \lambda^{-2} \|Tg\|_2^2 \le \lambda^{-2}\|T\|^2 \|g\|_2^2 \le 2\lambda^{-1}\mu \|T\|^2 \|f\|_1.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''J''* is defined to be the interval with the same centre as ''J'' but twice the length, the term for ''b'' can be broken up into two parts:

:&lt;math&gt;m\{x:\, |Tb(x)| \ge \lambda\}\le m\{x:\, x\notin \cup J_n^*,\,\,\, |Tb(x)| \ge \lambda\} +m(\cup J_n^*).&lt;/math&gt;

The second term is easy to estimate:

:&lt;math&gt;m(\cup J_n^*)\le \sum m(J_n^*)=2\sum m(J_n) \le 2\lambda^{-1} \mu^{-1} \|f\|_1.&lt;/math&gt;

To estimate the first term note that

:&lt;math&gt;b=\sum b_n, \qquad b_n =(f - \mathbf{Av}_{J_n}(f))\chi_{J_n}.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus by Chebychev's inequality:

:&lt;math&gt;m\{x:\, x\notin \cup J_m^*,\,\,\, |Tb(x)| \ge \lambda\}\le \lambda^{-1}\int_{(\cup J_m^*)^c} |Tb(x)|\, dx \le \lambda^{-1} \sum_n\int_{( J_n^*)^c} |Tb_n(x)|\, dx.&lt;/math&gt;

By construction the integral of ''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' over ''J&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is zero. Thus, if ''y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the midpoint of ''J&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', then by Hörmander's condition:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{( J_n^*)^c} |Tb_n(x)|\, dx= \int_{( J_n^*)^c} \left|\int_{J_n} (K(x-y)-K(x-y_n))b_n(y)\, dy\right|\, dx \le \int_{J_n} |b_n(y)| \int_{( J_n^*)^c} |K(x-y)-K(x-y_n)|\, dxdy \le A\|b_n\|_1.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence

:&lt;math&gt;m \left \{x:\, x\notin \cup J_m^*, |Tb(x)| \ge \lambda \right \} \le \lambda^{-1} A \|b\|_1 \le 2 A\lambda^{-1}\|f\|_1.&lt;/math&gt;

Combining the three estimates gives

:&lt;math&gt;m\{x:\, |Tf(x)| \ge \lambda\} \le \left (2\mu\|T\|^2 +2\mu^{-1} + 2A \right )\lambda^{-1}\|f\|_1.&lt;/math&gt;

The constant is minimized by taking

:&lt;math&gt;\mu=\|T\|^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

The Markinciewicz interpolation argument extends the bounds to any L&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; with 1 &lt; ''p'' &lt; 2 as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hörmander|1990|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given ''a'' &gt; 0, write

:&lt;math&gt;f=f_a + f^a,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f'' if |''f''| &lt; ''a'' and 0 otherwise and ''f''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''f'' if |''f''| ≥ ''a'' and 0 otherwise. Then by Chebychev's inequality and the weak type L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; inequality above

:&lt;math&gt;m\{x:\, |Tf(x)| &gt; a\} \le m \left \{x:\, |Tf_a(x)| &gt; \tfrac{a}{2} \right \}+ m \left \{x:\, |Tf^a(x)| &gt; \tfrac{a}{2} \right \}\le 4a^{-2}\|T\|^2 \|f_a\|_2^2 +C a^{-1}\|f^a\|_1.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\|Tf\|_p^p &amp;= p\int_0^\infty a^{p-1} m\{x:\, |Tf(x)|&gt; a\} \, da \\
&amp;\le p \int_0^\infty a^{p-1} \left ( 4a^{-2}\|T\|^2 \|f_a\|_2^2 +C a^{-1}\|f^a\|_1 \right ) da \\
&amp;=4\|T\|^2 \iint_{|f(x)|&lt;a} |f(x)|^2 a^{p-3}\,dx\, da + 2C\iint_{|f(x)|\ge a} |f(x)| a^{p-2}\,dx\, da \\
&amp;\le \left (4\|T\|^2(2-p)^{-1} + C (p-1)^{-1} \right ) \int |f|^p \\
&amp;=C_p \|f\|_p^p.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

By duality

:&lt;math&gt;\|Tf\|_q \le C_p \|f\|_q.&lt;/math&gt;

Continuity of the norms can be shown by a more refined argument&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Torchinsky|2005|pp=87–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; or follows from the [[Riesz–Thorin interpolation theorem]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6471">'''Stress majorization''' is an [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization strategy]] used in [[multidimensional scaling]] (MDS) where, for a set of ''n'' ''m''-dimensional data items, a configuration ''X'' of ''n'' points in ''r(&lt;&lt;m)''-dimensional space is sought that minimizes the so-called ''stress'' function &lt;math&gt;\sigma(X)&lt;/math&gt;.  Usually ''r'' is 2 or 3, i.e. the ''(''n'' x ''r'')'' matrix ''X'' lists points in 2- or 3-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] so that the result may be visualised (i.e. an [[MDS plot]]).  The function &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a cost or [[loss function]] that measures the squared differences between ideal (&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional) distances and actual distances in ''r''-dimensional space.  It is defined as:

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma(X)=\sum_{i&lt;j\le n}w_{ij}(d_{ij}(X)-\delta_{ij})^2&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;w_{ij}\ge 0&lt;/math&gt; is a weight for the measurement between a pair of points &lt;math&gt;(i,j)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d_{ij}(X)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[euclidean distance]] between &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the ideal distance between the points (their separation) in the &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional data space.  Note that &lt;math&gt;w_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; can be used to specify a degree of confidence in the similarity between points (e.g. 0 can be specified if there is no information for a particular pair).

A configuration &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; which minimizes &lt;math&gt;\sigma(X)&lt;/math&gt; gives a plot in which points that are close together correspond to points that are also close together in the original &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional data space.

There are many ways that &lt;math&gt; \sigma(X)&lt;/math&gt; could be minimized.  For example, Kruskal&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Kruskal|first=J. B.|authorlink=Joseph Kruskal|title=Multidimensional scaling by optimizing goodness of fit to a nonmetric hypothesis|journal=Psychometrika|volume=29|issue=1|pages=1–27|year=1964|doi=10.1007/BF02289565}}.&lt;/ref&gt; recommended an iterative [[steepest descent]] approach. However, a significantly better (in terms of guarantees on, and rate of, convergence) method for minimizing stress was introduced by [[Jan de Leeuw]].&lt;ref name="de Leeuw"&gt;{{citation|last=de Leeuw|first=J.|contribution=Applications of convex analysis to multidimensional scaling|editor1-first=J. R.|editor1-last=Barra|editor2-first=F.|editor2-last=Brodeau|editor3-first=G.|editor3-last=Romie|editor4-first=B.|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=van Cutsem|title=Recent developments in statistics|pages=133–145|year=1977}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  De Leeuw's ''iterative majorization'' method at each step minimizes a simple convex function which both bounds &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; from above and touches the surface of &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; at a point &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, called the ''supporting point''.  In [[convex analysis]] such a function is called a ''majorizing'' function.  This iterative majorization process is also referred to as the SMACOF algorithm ("Scaling by MAjorizing a COmplicated Function").

== The SMACOF algorithm ==
The stress function &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; can be expanded as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;
\sigma(X)=\sum_{i&lt;j\le n}w_{ij}(d_{ij}(X)-\delta_{ij})^2
=\sum_{i&lt;j}w_{ij}\delta_{ij}^2 + \sum_{i&lt;j}w_{ij}d_{ij}^2(X)-2\sum_{i&lt;j}w_{ij}\delta_{ij}d_{ij}(X)
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the first term is a constant &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and the second term is quadratic in X (i.e. for the [[Hessian matrix]] V the second term is equivalent to [[Matrix trace|tr]]&lt;math&gt;X'VX&lt;/math&gt;) and therefore relatively easily solved.  The third term is bounded by:

: &lt;math&gt;
\sum_{i&lt;j}w_{ij}\delta_{ij}d_{ij}(X)=\,\operatorname{tr}\, X'B(X)X \ge \,\operatorname{tr}\, X'B(Z)Z
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;B(Z)&lt;/math&gt; has:

: &lt;math&gt;b_{ij}=-\frac{w_{ij}\delta_{ij}}{d_{ij}(Z)}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;d_{ij}(Z)\ne 0, i \ne j&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;b_{ij}=0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;d_{ij}(Z)=0, i\ne j&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;b_{ii}=-\sum_{j=1,j\ne i}^n b_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;.

Proof of this inequality is by the [[Cauchy-Schwarz]] inequality, see Borg&lt;ref name="borg"&gt;{{citation|last1=Borg|first1=I.|last2=Groenen|first2=P.|author-link2=Patrick Groenen|title=Modern Multidimensional Scaling: theory and applications|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=New York|year=1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (pp.&amp;nbsp;152–153).

Thus, we have a simple quadratic function &lt;math&gt;\tau(X,Z)&lt;/math&gt; that majorizes stress:

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma(X)=C+\,\operatorname{tr}\, X'VX - 2 \,\operatorname{tr}\, X'B(X)X
&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\le C+\,\operatorname{tr}\, X' V X - 2 \,\operatorname{tr}\, X'B(Z)Z = \tau(X,Z)
&lt;/math&gt;


The iterative minimization procedure is then:

* at the k&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; step we set &lt;math&gt;Z\leftarrow X^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;X^k\leftarrow \min_X \tau(X,Z)&lt;/math&gt;
* stop if &lt;math&gt;\sigma(X^{k-1})-\sigma(X^{k})&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; otherwise repeat.

This algorithm has been shown to decrease stress monotonically (see de Leeuw&lt;ref name="de Leeuw"/&gt;).

== Use in graph drawing ==
Stress majorization and algorithms similar to SMACOF also have application in the field of [[graph drawing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Michailidis|first1=G.|last2=de Leeuw|first2=J.|title=Data visualization through graph drawing|journal=Computation Stat.|year=2001|volume=16|issue=3|pages=435–450|doi=10.1007/s001800100077}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=E.|last1=Gansner|first2=Y.|last2=Koren|first3=S.|last3=North|contribution=Graph Drawing by Stress Majorization|title=[[International Symposium on Graph Drawing|Proceedings of 12th Int.

Graph Drawing (GD'04)]]|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|volume=3383|publisher=Springer-Verlag|pages=239–250|year=2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, one can find a reasonably aesthetically appealing layout for a network or graph by minimizing a stress function over the positions of the nodes in the graph.  In this case, the &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; are usually set to the graph-theoretic distances between nodes ''i'' and ''j'' and the weights &lt;math&gt;w_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; are taken to be &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ij}^{-\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;.  Here, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is chosen as a trade-off between preserving long- or short-range ideal distances.  Good results have been shown for &lt;math&gt;\alpha=2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Cohen|first=J.|title=Drawing graphs to convey proximity: an incremental arrangement method|journal=ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction|volume=4|issue=3|year=1997|pages=197–229|doi=10.1145/264645.264657}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem''' is a [[Mathematical proof|proof]] by British mathematician [[Andrew Wiles]] of a special case of the [[modularity theorem]] for [[elliptic curve]]s. Together with [[Ribet's theorem]], it provides a proof for [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]. Both Fermat's Last Theorem and the modularity theorem were almost universally considered inaccessible to proof by contemporaneous mathematicians, meaning that they were believed to be impossible to prove using current knowledge.&lt;ref name="Singh" /&gt;{{rp|203–205, 223, 226}}

Wiles first announced his proof on Wednesday 23 June 1993 at a lecture in [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] entitled "Modular Forms, Elliptic Curves and Galois Representations".&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|last=Kolata|first=Gina|title=At Last, Shout of 'Eureka!'

One year later on Monday 19 September 1994, in what he would call "the most important moment of [his] working life", Wiles stumbled upon a revelation that allowed him to correct the proof to the satisfaction of the mathematical community. The corrected proof was published in 1995.&lt;ref name="abelcitation"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abelprize.no/c67107/binfil/download.php?tid=67059|title=The Abel Prize 2016|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wiles' proof uses many techniques from [[algebraic geometry]] and [[number theory]], and has many ramifications in these branches of mathematics. It also uses standard constructions of modern algebraic geometry, such as the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]] and [[Iwasawa theory]], and other 20th-century techniques which were not available to Fermat.

Together, the two papers which contain the proof are 129 pages long,&lt;ref name="wiles1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taylor1995"/&gt; and consumed over seven years of Wiles's research time. [[John H. Coates|John Coates]] described the proof as one of the highest achievements of number theory, and [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] called it the proof of the [20th] century.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2414proof.html|title=NOVA – Transcripts – The Proof – PBS|last=|first=|date=September 2006|website=PBS|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wiles' path to proving Fermat's Last Theorem, by way of proving the modularity theorem for the special case of [[semistable elliptic curve]]s, established powerful [[lift (mathematics)|modularity lifting]] techniques and opened up entire new approaches to numerous other problems. For solving Fermat's Last Theorem, he was [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom#Knighthood|knighted]], and received other honours such as the 2016 [[Abel Prize]]. When announcing that Wiles had won the Abel Prize, the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]] described his achievement as a "stunning proof".&lt;ref name="abelcitation" /&gt;

== Precursors to Wiles' proof==

=== Fermat's Last Theorem and progress prior to 1980===
{{main|Fermat's Last Theorem}}

[[Fermat's Last Theorem]], formulated in 1637, states that no three distinct positive integers ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' can satisfy the equation
: &lt;math&gt;a^n + b^n=c^n &lt;/math&gt;
if ''n'' is an integer greater than two (''n'' &gt; 2).

Over time, this simple assertion became one of the most famous unproved claims in mathematics.  Between its publication and Andrew Wiles' eventual solution over 350 years later, many mathematicians and amateurs attempted to prove this statement, either for all values of n &gt; 2, or for specific cases. It spurred the development of entire new areas within [[number theory]]. Proofs were eventually found for all values of n up to around 4 million, first by hand, and later by computer.  But no general proof was found that would be valid for all possible values of ''n'', nor even a hint how such a proof could be undertaken.

===The Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture===
{{main|Modularity Theorem}}

Separately from anything related to Fermat's Last Theorem, in the 1950s and 1960s Japanese mathematician [[Goro Shimura]], drawing on ideas posed by [[Yutaka Taniyama]], conjectured that a connection might exist between [[elliptic curve]]s and [[modular form]]s. These were mathematical objects with no known connection between them. Taniyama and Shimura posed the question whether, unknown to mathematicians, the two kinds of object were actually identical mathematical objects, just seen in different ways.

They conjectured that every [[rational number|rational]] elliptic curve is also [[classical modular curve|modular]]. This became known as the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture. In the West, this conjecture became well known through a 1967 paper by [[André Weil]], who gave conceptual evidence for it; thus, it is sometimes called the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture.

By around 1980, much evidence had been accumulated to form conjectures about elliptic curves, and many papers had been written which examined the consequences if the conjecture was true, but the actual conjecture itself was unproven and generally considered inaccessible - meaning that mathematicians believed a proof of the conjecture was probably impossible using current knowledge. 

For decades, the conjecture remained an important but unsolved problem in mathematics. Around 50 years after first being proposed, the conjecture was finally proven and renamed the [[modularity theorem]], largely as a result of Andrew Wiles' work described below.

===Frey's curve===
On yet another separate branch of development, in the late 1960s, Yves Hellegouarch came up with the idea of associating solutions (''a'',''b'',''c'') of Fermat's equation with a completely different mathematical object: an elliptic curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Hellegouarch | first=Yves | title=Invitation to the Mathematics of Fermat–Wiles | publisher=Academic Press | year=2001 | isbn=978-0-12-339251-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The curve consists of all points in the plane whose coordinates (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') satisfy the relation
: &lt;math&gt; y^2 = x(x-a^n)(x+b^n). &lt;/math&gt;
Such an elliptic curve would enjoy very special properties, which are due to the appearance of high powers of integers in its equation and the fact that ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''c''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is an ''n''th power as well.

In 1982–1985, [[Gerhard Frey]] called attention to the unusual properties of this same curve, now called a [[Frey curve]]. He showed that it was likely that the curve could link Fermat and Taniyama, since any [[counterexample]] to Fermat's Last Theorem would probably also imply that an elliptic curve existed that was not [[modular curve|modular]].

In plain English, Frey had shown that there were good reasons to believe that any set of numbers (''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''n'') capable of disproving Fermat's Last Theorem, could also (probably) be used to disprove the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture. Therefore, if the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture were true, no set of numbers capable of disproving Fermat could exist, so Fermat's Last Theorem would have to be true as well.

: (Mathematically, the conjecture says that each elliptic curve with [[Rational number|rational]] coefficients can be constructed in an entirely different way, not by giving its equation but by using [[modular function]]s to [[Parametric equation|parametrise]] coordinates ''x'' and ''y'' of the points on it. Thus, according to the conjecture, any elliptic curve over '''Q''' would have to be a [[modular elliptic curve]], yet if a solution to Fermat's equation with non-zero ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' and ''n'' greater than 2 existed, the corresponding curve would not be modular, resulting in a contradiction.)

If the link identified by Frey could be proven, then in turn, it would mean that a proof or disproof of either of Fermat's Last Theorem or the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture would simultaneously prove or disprove the other.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, pp. 194–198; Aczel, pp. 109–114.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ribet's Theorem===
{{main|Ribet's Theorem}}

To complete this link,  it was necessary to show that Frey's intuition was correct: that a Frey curve, if it existed, could not be modular. 

In 1985, [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] provided a partial proof that a Frey curve could not be modular. Serre did not provide a complete proof of his proposal; the missing part (which Serre had noticed early on&lt;ref name="CornellBook"/&gt;{{rp|1}}) became known as the [[epsilon theorem|epsilon conjecture]] or ε-conjecture (it is now known as [[Ribet's theorem]]). Serre's main interest was in an even more ambitious conjecture, [[Serre conjecture (number theory)|Serre's conjecture]] on modular [[Galois representations]], which would imply the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture. However his partial proof came close to confirming the link between Fermat and Taniyama.

In the summer of 1986, [[Kenneth Alan Ribet|Ken Ribet]] succeeded in proving the epsilon conjecture, now known as [[Ribet's theorem]].  His article was published in 1990. In doing so, Ribet finally proved the link between the two theorems by confirming as Frey had suggested, that a proof of the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture for the kinds of elliptic curves Frey had identified, together with Ribet's theorem, would also prove Fermat's Last Theorem:

: In mathematical terms, Ribet's theorem showed that if the Galois representation associated with an elliptic curve has certain properties (which Frey's curve has), then that curve cannot be modular, in the sense that there cannot exist a modular form which gives rise to the same Galois representation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210102243/http://cgd.best.vwh.net/home/flt/flt08.htm|title=The Proof of Fermat's Last Theorem|last=Daney|first=Charles|date=13 March 1996|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Situation prior to Wiles' proof ===

Following the developments related to the Frey Curve, and its link to both Fermat and Taniyama, a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem would follow from a proof of the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture — or at least a proof of the conjecture for the kinds of elliptic curves that included Frey's equation (known as [[semistable elliptic curve]]s).

:* From Ribet's Theorem and the Frey Curve, any 4 numbers able to be used to disprove Fermat's Last Theorem could also be used to make a semistable elliptic curve ("Frey's curve") that could never be modular;
:* But if the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture were also true for semistable elliptic curves, then by definition every Frey's curve that existed must be modular.
:* The contradiction could have [[proof by contradiction|only one answer]]: if Ribet's Theorem and the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture for semistable curves were both true, then it would mean there could not be any solutions to Fermat's equation &amp;ndash; because then there would be no Frey curves at all, meaning no contradictions would exist. This would finally prove Fermat's Last Theorem.

However, despite the progress made by Serre and Ribet, this approach to Fermat was widely considered unusable as well, since almost all mathematicians saw the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture itself as completely inaccessible to proof with current knowledge.&lt;ref name="Singh" /&gt;{{rp|203–205, 223, 226}} For example, Wiles's ex-supervisor [[John H. Coates|John Coates]] stated that it seemed "impossible to actually prove",&lt;ref name="Singh" /&gt;{{rp|226}} and Ken Ribet considered himself "one of the vast majority of people who believed [it] was completely inaccessible".&lt;ref name="Singh" /&gt;{{rp|223}}

==Andrew Wiles==
Hearing of Ribet's 1986 proof of the epsilon conjecture, English mathematician Andrew Wiles, who had studied elliptic curves and had a childhood fascination with Fermat, decided to begin working in secret towards a proof of the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture, since it was now professionally justifiable&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/physics/andrew-wiles-fermat.html|title=Andrew Wiles on Solving Fermat|last=|first=|date=1 November 2000|website=PBS|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as because of the enticing goal of proving such a long-standing problem.

Ribet later commented that "Andrew Wiles was probably one of the few people on earth who had the audacity to dream that you can actually go and prove [it]."&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name="Singh" /&gt;{{rp|223}}

==Announcement and subsequent developments==
Wiles initially presented his proof in 1993. It was finally accepted as correct, and published, in 1995, following the correction of a subtle error in one part of his original paper. His work was extended to a full proof of the modularity theorem over the following 6 years by others, who built on Wiles's work.

===Announcement and final proof (1993–1995)===
During 21–23 June 1993 Wiles announced and presented his proof of the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture for semi-stable elliptic curves, and hence of Fermat's Last Theorem, over the course of three lectures delivered at the [[Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences]] in [[Cambridge, England]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; There was a relatively large amount of press coverage afterwards.&lt;ref name="AMS-review"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buzzard|first=Kevin|date=22 February 1999|title=Review of ''Modular forms and Fermat's Last Theorem,'' by G. Cornell, J. H. Silverman, and G. Stevens|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1999-36-02/S0273-0979-99-00778-8/S0273-0979-99-00778-8.pdf|journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|volume=36|issue=2|pages=261&amp;ndash;266|doi=10.1090/S0273-0979-99-00778-8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the announcement, [[Nick Katz]] was appointed as one of the referees to [[peer review|review]] Wiles's manuscript. In the course of his review, he asked Wiles a series of clarifying questions that led Wiles to recognise that the proof contained a gap. There was an error in one critical portion of the proof which gave a bound for the order of a particular group: the [[Euler system]] used to extend Kolyvagin and Flach's method was incomplete. The error would not have rendered his work worthless – each part of Wiles's work was highly significant and innovative by itself, as were the many developments and techniques he had created in the course of his work, and only one part was affected.&lt;ref name="Singh"&gt;Fermat's Last Theorem, Simon Singh, 1997, {{isbn|1-85702-521-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|289, 296–297}} Without this part proved, however, there was no actual proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.

Wiles spent almost a year trying to repair his proof, initially by himself and then in collaboration with his former student [[Richard Taylor (mathematician)|Richard Taylor]], without success.&lt;ref name="sept1994"&gt;Singh, pp. 269–277.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/28/science/a-year-later-snag-persists-in-math-proof.html|title=A Year Later, Snag Persists In Math Proof|last=Kolata|first=Gina|date=1994-06-28|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-06-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/03/weekinreview/june-26-july-2-a-year-later-fermat-s-puzzle-is-still-not-quite-qed.html|title=June 26-July 2; A Year Later Fermat's Puzzle Is Still Not Quite Q.E.D.|last=Kolata|first=Gina|date=1994-07-03|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-06-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1993, rumours had spread that under scrutiny, Wiles' proof had failed, but how seriously was not known.  Mathematicians were beginning to pressure Wiles to disclose his work whether or not complete, so that the wider community could explore and use whatever he had managed to accomplish. But instead of being fixed, the problem, which had originally seemed minor, now seemed very significant, far more serious, and less easy to resolve.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, pp. 175-185.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wiles states that on the morning of 19 September 1994, he was on the verge of giving up and was almost resigned to accepting that he had failed, and to publishing his work so that others could build on it and find the error. He states that he was having a final look to try and understand the fundamental reasons why his approach could not be made to work, when he had a sudden [[insight]] that the specific reason why the Kolyvagin–Flach approach would not work directly, also meant that his original attempts using [[Iwasawa theory]] could be made to work if he strengthened it using his experience gained from the Kolyvagin–Flach approach since then. Each was inadequate by itself, but fixing one approach with tools from the other would resolve the issue and produce a [[class number formula]] (CNF) valid for all cases that were not already proven by his refereed paper:&lt;ref name="sept1994" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aczel, pp. 132–134.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sept1994" /&gt;

:"I was sitting at my desk examining the Kolyvagin–Flach method. It wasn’t that I believed I could make it work, but I thought that at least I could explain why it didn’t work. Suddenly I had this incredible revelation. I realised that, the Kolyvagin–Flach method wasn’t working, but it was all I needed to make my original Iwasawa theory work from three years earlier. So out of the ashes of Kolyvagin–Flach seemed to rise the true answer to the problem. It was so indescribably beautiful; it was so simple and so elegant. I couldn’t understand how I’d missed it and I just stared at it in disbelief for twenty minutes. Then during the day I walked around the department, and I’d keep coming back to my desk looking to see if it was still there. It was still there. I couldn’t contain myself, I was so excited. It was the most important moment of my working life. Nothing I ever do again will mean as much."
::— Andrew Wiles, as quoted by Simon Singh&lt;ref&gt;Singh p.186-187 (text condensed).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 October Wiles asked three colleagues (including Faltings) to review his new proof,&lt;ref name=mactutor/&gt; and on 24 October 1994 Wiles submitted two manuscripts, "Modular elliptic curves and Fermat's Last Theorem"&lt;ref name="wiles1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wiles|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Wiles|year=1995|title=Modular elliptic curves and Fermat's Last Theorem|url=http://math.stanford.edu/~lekheng/flt/wiles.pdf|journal=Annals of Mathematics|volume=141|issue=3|pages=443–551|oclc=37032255|format=PDF|doi=10.2307/2118559|jstor=2118559|publisher=Annals of Mathematics}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Ring theoretic properties of certain Hecke algebras",&lt;ref name="taylor1995"&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Richard Taylor (mathematician)|Taylor R]], [[Andrew Wiles|Wiles A]] |year=1995 |journal=Annals of Mathematics |title=Ring theoretic properties of certain Hecke algebras |volume=141 |issue=3 |pages=553–572 |oclc=37032255 |url=http://www.math.harvard.edu/~rtaylor/hecke.ps |doi=10.2307/2118560 |jstor=2118560 |publisher=Annals of Mathematics |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011127181043/http://www.math.harvard.edu/~rtaylor/hecke.ps |archivedate=27 November 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the second of which Wiles had written with Taylor and proved that certain conditions were met which were needed to justify the corrected step in the main paper.

The two papers were vetted and finally published as the entirety of the May 1995 issue of the ''[[Annals of Mathematics]]''. The new proof was widely analysed, and became accepted as likely correct in its major components.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These papers established the modularity theorem for semistable elliptic curves, the last step in proving Fermat's Last Theorem, 358 years after it was conjectured.

===Subsequent developments===
Fermat claimed to "...have discovered a truly marvelous proof of this, which this margin is too narrow to contain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Modular Forms and Fermat’s Last Theorem |edition=illustrated |first1=Gary |last1=Cornell |first2=Joseph H. |last2=Silverman |first3=Glenn |last3=Stevens |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-4612-1974-3 |page=549 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jD3TBwAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=jD3TBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA549 Extract of page 549]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2011/0817/Why-Pierre-de-Fermat-is-the-patron-saint-of-unfinished-business|title=Why Pierre de Fermat is the patron saint of unfinished business|last=O'Carroll|first=Eoin|date=2011-08-17|work=The Christian Science Monitor|access-date=2017-06-29|issn=0882-7729}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wiles's proof is very complex, and incorporates the work of so many other specialists that it was suggested in 1994 that only a small number of people were capable of fully understanding at that time all the details of what he had done.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://math.albany.edu/g/Math/topics/fermat/granville.hist|title=History of Fermat's Last Theorem|last=Granville|first=Andrew|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complexity of Wiles's proof motivated a 10-day conference at [[Boston University]]; the resulting book of conference proceedings aimed to make the full range of required topics accessible to graduate students in number theory.&lt;ref name="CornellBook"/&gt;

As noted above, Wiles proved the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture for the special case of semistable elliptic curves, rather than for all elliptic curves. Over the following years, [[Christophe Breuil]], [[Brian Conrad]], [[Fred Diamond]], and [[Richard Taylor (mathematician)|Richard Taylor]] (sometimes abbreviated as "BCDT")  carried the work further, ultimately proving the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture for all elliptic curves in a 2001 paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Breuil|first=Christophe|last2=Conrad|first2=Brian|last3=Diamond|first3=Fred|last4=Taylor|first4=Richard|date=2001|title=On the modularity of elliptic curves over 𝐐: Wild 3-adic exercises|url=http://www.ams.org/jams/2001-14-04/S0894-0347-01-00370-8/|journal=Journal of the American Mathematical Society|volume=14|issue=4|pages=843–939|doi=10.1090/S0894-0347-01-00370-8|issn=0894-0347}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now proved, the conjecture became known as the modularity theorem.

In 2005, Dutch [[computer science|computer scientist]] [[Jan Bergstra]] posed the problem of formalizing Wiles' proof in such a way that it could be [[Automated proof checking|verified by computer]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.rug.nl/~wim/fermat/wilesEnglish.html|title=Computer verification of Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem|last=Hesselink|first=Wim H.|date=3 April 2008|website=www.cs.rug.nl|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary of Wiles' proof==
{{Anchor|Non-technical summary of Wiles' proof}}
{{Expert needed|Mathematics|section|reason=Newly added section: review required for technical accuracy|date=June 2017}}
Wiles used [[proof by contradiction]], in which one assumes the opposite of what is to be proved, and show if that were true, it would create a contradiction. The contradiction shows that the assumption must have been incorrect.

The proof falls roughly in two parts. In the first part, Wiles proves a general result about "[[Lift (mathematics)|lifts]]", known as the "modularity lifting theorem". This first part allows him to prove results about elliptic curves by converting them to problems about [[Galois representation]]s of elliptic curves.  He then uses this result to prove that all semi-stable curves are modular, by proving that the ''Galois representations'' of these curves are modular, instead.

| We start by assuming that Fermat's Last Theorem is incorrect. That would mean there is at least one non-zero solution (''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''n'') (with all numbers rational and ''n'' &gt; 2 and prime) must exist to ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''c''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

| [[Ribet's theorem]] (using Frey and Serre's work) shows that we can create a semi-stable elliptic curve ''E'' using the numbers (''a'', ''b'', ''c'', and ''n''), which is never [[modular form|modular]].

We will set up our proof by initially seeing what happens if Fermat's Last Theorem is incorrect, and showing (hopefully) that this would always lead to a contradiction. 
| style="background-color:lightgreen" | If we can prove that all such elliptic curves will be modular (meaning that they match a modular form), then we have our contradiction and have proved our assumption (that such a set of numbers exists) was wrong. If the assumption is wrong, that means no such numbers exist, which proves Fermat's Last Theorem is correct.

| Suppose that Fermat's Last Theorem is incorrect. This means a set of numbers (''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''n'') must exist that is a solution of Fermat's equation, and we can use the solution to create a [[Frey curve]] which is semi-stable and elliptic. So we assume that (somehow) we have found a solution and created such a curve (which we will call "''E''"), and see what happens.

| Galois representations of elliptic curves ''&amp;rho;''(''E'', ''p'') for any prime ''p'' &gt; 3 have been studied by many mathematicians.

Wiles aims first of all to prove a result about these representations, that he will use later: that if a semi-stable elliptic curve ''E'' has a Galois representation ''&amp;rho;''(''E'', ''p'') that is modular, the elliptic curve itself must be modular.

Proving this is helpful in two ways: it makes counting and matching easier, and, significantly, to prove the representation is modular, we would only have to prove it for one single prime number ''p'', and we can do this using ''any prime'' that makes our work easy &amp;ndash; it does not matter which prime we use.

This is the most difficult part of the problem &amp;ndash; technically it means proving that if the Galois representation ''&amp;rho;''(''E'', ''p'') is a modular form, so are all the other related Galois representations ''&amp;rho;''(''E'', ''p''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;infin;&lt;/sup&gt;) for all powers of p.&lt;ref name="abelcitation" /&gt;  This is the so-called "[[Lift (mathematics)|modular lifting]] problem", and Wiles approached it using [[Deformation theory|deformations]].

:Any elliptic curve (or a representation of an elliptic curve) can be categorized as either [[Irreducible (mathematics)|''reducible'' or ''irreducible'']]. The proof will be slightly different depending whether or not the elliptic curve's representation is reducible.
| style="background-color:lightgreen" | To compare elliptic curves and modular forms directly is difficult. Past efforts to count and match elliptic curves and modular forms had all failed. But elliptic curves can be [[Representation (mathematics)|represented]] within [[Galois theory]]. Wiles realized that working with the representations of elliptic curves instead of the curves themselves would make counting and matching them to modular forms far easier. From this point on, the proof primarily aims to prove:
: (1) if the geometric Galois representation of a semi-stable elliptic curve is modular, so is the curve itself; and
: (2) the geometric Galois representations of all semi-stable elliptic curves are modular.
Together, these allow us to work with representations of curves rather than directly with elliptic curves themselves. Our original goal will have been transformed into proving the modularity of geometric Galois representations of semi-stable elliptic curves, instead. Wiles described this realization as a "key breakthrough".

A Galois representation of an elliptic curves is'' ''G''-&gt;GL('''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;).  To show that a geometric Galois representation of an elliptic curve is a modular form, we need to find a [[Eigenform|normalized eigenform]] whose [[eigenvalue]]s (which are also its [[Fourier series]] coefficients) satisfy a [[congruence relation]]ship for all but a finite number of primes.

| Wiles' initial strategy is to count and match using [[proof by induction]] and a [[Class number formula|Class Number Formula]] ("CNF"): an approach in which, once the hypothesis is proved for one elliptic curve, it can automatically be extended to be proven for all subsequent elliptic curves. 
| style="background-color:lightgreen" | It was in this area that Wiles found difficulties, first with horizontal [[Iwasawa theory]] and later with his extension of Kolyvagin&amp;ndash;Flach. Wiles' work extending Kolyvagin–Flach was mainly related to making Kolyvagin–Flach strong enough to prove the full CNF he would use. It later turned out that neither of these approaches by itself could produce a CNF able to cover all types of semi-stable elliptic curves, and the final piece of his proof in 1995 was to realize that he could succeed by strengthening Iwasawa theory with the techniques from Kolyvagin&amp;ndash;Flach.

| At this point, the proof has shown a key point about Galois representations: 
: If the geometric Galois representation ''&amp;rho;''(''E'',''p'') of a semi-stable elliptic curve ''E'' is irreducible and modular (for some prime number p &gt; 2), then subject to some technical conditions, E is modular.
This is Wiles' ''lifting theorem'' (or ''modularity lifting theorem''), a major and revolutionary accomplishment at the time. 
| style="background-color:lightgreen" | Crucially, this result does not just show that modular irreducible representations imply modular curves. It also means we can prove a representation is modular by using any prime number&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2 that we find easiest to use (because proving it for just one prime&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2 proves it for all primes&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2).

So we can try to prove all of our elliptic curves are modular by using one prime number as ''p'' - but if we do not succeed in proving this for all elliptic curves, perhaps we can prove the rest by choosing different prime numbers as 'p' for the difficult cases.

The proof must cover the Galois representations of all semi-stable elliptic curves ''E'', but for each individual curve, we only need to prove it is modular using one prime number ''p''.)

| With the lifting theorem proved, we return to the original problem. We will categorize all semi-stable elliptic curves based on the reducibility of their Galois representations, and use the powerful lifting theorem on the results.

From above, it does not matter which prime is chosen for the representations. We can use any one prime number that is easiest. 3 is the smallest prime number more than 2, and some work has already been done on representations of elliptic curves using ''&amp;rho;''(''E'',3), so choosing 3 as our prime number is a helpful starting point.

Wiles found that it was easier to prove the representation was modular by choosing a prime p=3 in the cases where the representation ''&amp;rho;''(''E'',3) is irreducible, but the proof when ''&amp;rho;''(''E'',3)  is reducible was easier to prove by choosing ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5. So the proof splits in two at this point. 
| style="background-color:lightgreen" | The proof's use of both p=3 and p=5 below, is the so-called "3/5 switch" referred to in some descriptions of the proof, which Wiles noticed in a paper of Mazur's in 1993, although the trick itself dates back to the 19th century.

The switch between p=3 and p=5 has since opened a significant area of study in its own right ''(see [[Serre's modularity conjecture]])''.
|-valign="top"

| If the Galois representation ''&amp;rho;''(''E'',3) (i.e., using ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3) is irreducible, then it was known from around 1980 that its Galois representation is also always modular.

Wiles' uses his modularity lifting theorem to make short work of this case:  
:* If the representation ''&amp;rho;''(''E'',3) is irreducible, then we know the representation is also modular (Langland and Tunnell).... but ....
:* ... if the representation is both irreducible and modular then ''E'' itself is modular (modularity lifting theorem).
| style="background-color:lightgreen" | Langlands and Tunnell proved this in two papers in the early 1980s. The proof is based on the fact that ''&amp;rho;''(''E'',3) has the same [[symmetry group]] as the general [[quartic equation]] in one variable, which was one of the few general classes of [[diophantine equation]] known at that time to be modular.

This existing result for p=3 is crucial to Wiles' approach and is one reason for initially using p=3.
|-valign="top"
| 9
| So we now consider what happens if ''&amp;rho;''(''E'',3) is reducible.

Wiles found that when the representation of an elliptic curve using p=3 is reducible, it was easier to work with p=5 and use his new lifting theorem to prove that ''&amp;rho;''(''E'', 5) will always be modular, than to try and prove directly that ''&amp;rho;''(''E'',3) itself is modular (remembering that we only need to prove it for one prime).
| style="background-color:lightgreen" | 5 is the next prime number after 3, and any prime number can be used, perhaps 5 will be an easier prime number to work with than 3? But it looks hopeless initially to prove that ''&amp;rho;''(''E'', 5) is always modular, for much the same reason that the general [[quintic equation]] cannot be solved by radicals. So Wiles has to find a way around this.
|-valign="top"
| 9.1 
| style="padding-left:30px" | If ''&amp;rho;''(''E'',3) and ''&amp;rho;''(''E'',5) are both reducible, Wiles proved directly that ''&amp;rho;''(''E'',5) must be modular.
| style="background-color:lightgreen" | &amp;nbsp;
|-valign="top"
| 9.2
| style="padding-left:30px" | The last case is if ''&amp;rho;''(''E'',3) is reducible and ''&amp;rho;''(''E'',5) is irreducible.

Wiles showed that in this case, one could always find another semistable elliptic curve ''F'' such that the representation ''&amp;rho;''(''F'',3) is irreducible and also the representations ''&amp;rho;''(''E'',5) and ''&amp;rho;''(''F'',5) are [[isomorphic]] (they have identical structures).

:- The first of these properties shows that F must be modular (Langlands and Tunnell again: all irreducible representations with p=3 are modular). 
:- If F is modular then we know ''&amp;rho;''(''F'',5) must be modular as well. 
:- But because the representations of ''E'' and ''F'' with ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5 have exactly the same structure, and we know that ''&amp;rho;''(''F'',5) is modular, ''&amp;rho;''(''E'',5) must be modular as well.
| style="background-color:lightgreen" | &amp;nbsp;
|-valign="top"
| 9.3
| style="padding-left:30px" | Therefore, if ''&amp;rho;''(''E'',3) is reducible, we have proved that ''&amp;rho;''(''E'',5) will always be modular. But if ''&amp;rho;''(''E'',5) is modular, then the modularity lifting theorem shows that E itself is modular.
| style="background-color:lightgreen" | This step shows the real power of the modularity lifting theorem.
|-valign="top"
! colspan="3" style="text-align:center;background-color:PaleGoldenrod" | Results
|-valign="top"
| 10
| We have now proved that whether or not ''&amp;rho;''(''E'',3) is irreducible, ''E'' (which could be any semi-stable elliptic curve) will always be modular. This means that all semi-stable elliptic curves must be modular.

This proves:
:(a) The Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture for semi-stable elliptic curves; and also
:(b) Because there cannot be a contradiction, it also proves that the kinds of elliptic curves described by Frey cannot actually exist. Therefore no solutions to Fermat's equation can exist either, so Fermat's Last Theorem is also true.
| style="background-color:lightgreen" | We have our proof by contradiction, because we have proven that if Fermat's Last Theorem is incorrect, we could create an elliptic curve that cannot be modular (Ribet's Theorem) and must be modular (Wiles). As it cannot be both, the only answer is that no such curve exists.

==Mathematical detail of Wiles proof==

===Overview===
Wiles opted to attempt to match elliptic curves to a [[countable]] set of modular forms. He found that this direct approach was not working, so he transformed the problem by instead matching the [[Galois representation]]s of the elliptic curves to modular forms. Wiles denotes this matching (or mapping) that, more specifically, is a [[ring homomorphism]]:
:&lt;math&gt; R_n \rightarrow \mathbf{T}_n. &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a deformation ring and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Hecke algebra of a locally compact group|Hecke ring]].

Wiles had the insight that in many cases this ring [[homomorphism]] could be a ring [[isomorphism]] (Conjecture 2.16 in Chapter 2, §3 of the 1995 paper&lt;ref name="wiles1995"/&gt;). He realised that the map between &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism if and only if two [[abelian group]]s occurring in the theory are finite and have the same [[cardinality]]. This is sometimes referred to as the "numerical criterion". Given this result, Fermat's Last Theorem is reduced to the statement that two groups have the same order. Much of the text of the proof leads into topics and theorems related to [[ring theory]] and [[commutation theory]]. Wiles's goal was to verify that the map &lt;math&gt; R \rightarrow \mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism and ultimately that &lt;math&gt; R = \mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt;. In treating deformations, Wiles defined four cases, with the [[Group scheme#Finite flat group schemes|flat]] deformation case requiring more effort to prove and treated in a separate article in the same volume entitled "Ring-theoretic properties of certain Hecke algebras".

[[Gerd Faltings]], in his bulletin, gives the following [[commutative diagram]] (p.&amp;nbsp;745):

:[[File:Faltings diagram.png|230px]]

or ultimately that &lt;math&gt; R = \mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt;, indicating a [[complete intersection]]. Since Wiles could not show that &lt;math&gt; R = \mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt; directly, he did so through &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Z}_3, \mathbf{F}_3 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}/\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; via [[Lift (mathematics)|lifts]].

In order to perform this matching, Wiles had to create a [[class number formula]] (CNF). He first attempted to use horizontal [[Iwasawa theory]] but that part of his work had an unresolved issue such that he could not create a CNF. At the end of the summer of 1991, he learned about an [[Euler system]] recently developed by [[Victor Kolyvagin]] and [[Matthias Flach (mathematician)|Matthias Flach]] that seemed "tailor made" for the inductive part of his proof, which could be used to create a CNF, and so Wiles set his Iwasawa work aside and began working to extend Kolyvagin and Flach's work instead, in order to create the CNF his proof would require.&lt;ref&gt;Singh p.259-262&lt;/ref&gt; By the spring of 1993, his work had covered all but a few families of elliptic curves, and in early 1993, Wiles was confident enough of his nearing success to let one trusted colleague into his secret. Since his work relied extensively on using the Kolyvagin&amp;ndash;Flach approach, which was new to mathematics and to Wiles, and which he had also extended, in January 1993 he asked his Princeton colleague, [[Nick Katz]], to help him review his work for subtle errors. Their conclusion at the time was that the techniques Wiles used seemed to work correctly.&lt;ref name="Singh" /&gt;{{rp|261–265}}&lt;ref&gt;Singh, pp. 239–243; Aczel, pp. 122–125.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wiles' use of Kolyvagin&amp;ndash;Flach would later be found to be the point of failure in the original proof submission, and he eventually had to revert to Iwasawa theory and a collaboration with Richard Taylor to fix it. In May 1993, while reading a paper by Mazur, Wiles had the insight that the 3/5 switch would resolve the final issues and would then cover all elliptic curves. (See Chapter 5 of the paper for this 3/5 switch.)

===General approach and strategy===
Given an elliptic curve ''E'' over the field '''Q''' of rational numbers &lt;math&gt; E(\bar{\mathbf{Q}}) &lt;/math&gt;, for every prime power &lt;math&gt;\ell^n&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a [[homomorphism]] from the [[absolute Galois group]]
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Gal}(\bar{\mathbf{Q}}/\mathbf{Q}) &lt;/math&gt;
to
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{GL}_2(\mathbf{Z}/l^n \mathbf{Z}), &lt;/math&gt;
the group of [[Invertible matrix|invertible]] 2 by 2 matrices whose entries are integers (&lt;math&gt;\mod \ell^n&lt;/math&gt;).  This is because &lt;math&gt;E(\bar{\mathbf{Q}})&lt;/math&gt;, the points of ''E'' over &lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{Q}}&lt;/math&gt;, form an [[abelian group]], on which &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Gal}(\bar{\mathbf{Q}}/\mathbf{Q})&lt;/math&gt; acts; the subgroup of elements ''x'' such that &lt;math&gt;\ell^n x = 0&lt;/math&gt; is just &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{Z}/\ell^n \mathbf{Z})^2&lt;/math&gt;, and an [[automorphism]] of this group is a matrix of the type described.

Less obvious is that given a modular form of a certain special type, a [[Hecke eigenform]] with eigenvalues in '''Q''', one also gets a homomorphism from the absolute Galois group
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Gal}(\bar{\mathbf{Q}}/\mathbf{Q}) \rightarrow \operatorname{GL}_2(\mathbf{Z}/l^n \mathbf{Z}).&lt;/math&gt;
This goes back to Eichler and Shimura.  The idea is that the Galois group acts first on the modular curve on which the modular form is defined, thence on the [[Jacobian variety]] of the curve, and finally on the points of &lt;math&gt;\ell^n&lt;/math&gt; power order on that Jacobian.  The resulting representation is not usually 2-dimensional, but the [[Hecke operator]]s cut out a 2-dimensional piece.  It is easy to demonstrate that these representations come from some elliptic curve but the converse is the difficult part to prove.

Instead of trying to go directly from the elliptic curve to the modular form, one can first pass to the (&lt;math&gt;\mod \ell^n&lt;/math&gt;) representation for some ''ℓ'' and ''n'', and from that to the modular form.  In the case ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 and ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, results of the [[Langlands–Tunnell theorem]] show that the (mod 3) representation of any elliptic curve over '''Q''' comes from a modular form.  The basic strategy is to use induction on ''n'' to show that this is true for ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 and any ''n'', that ultimately there is a single modular form that works for all n.  To do this, one uses a counting argument, comparing the number of ways in which one can [[Lift (mathematics)|lift]] a (&lt;math&gt;\mod \ell^n&lt;/math&gt;) Galois representation to (&lt;math&gt;\mod \ell^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;) and the number of ways in which one can lift a (&lt;math&gt;\mod \ell^n &lt;/math&gt;) modular form.  An essential point is to impose a sufficient set of conditions on the Galois representation; otherwise, there will be too many lifts and most will not be modular.  These conditions should be satisfied for the representations coming from modular forms and those coming from elliptic curves.  If the original (mod 3) representation has an image which is too small, one runs into trouble with the lifting argument, and in this case, there is a final trick, which has since taken on a life of its own with the subsequent work on the [[Serre conjecture (number theory)|Serre Modularity Conjecture]].  The idea involves the interplay between the (mod 3) and (mod 5) representations.  (Again, see Chapter 5 of the Wiles paper for this 3/5 switch.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3386">In [[mathematical logic]], a '''witness''' is a specific value ''t'' to be substituted for variable ''x'' of an [[existential quantification|existential statement]] of the form ∃''x'' ''φ''(''x'') such that ''φ''(''t'') is true.

== Examples ==

For example, a theory ''T'' of arithmetic is said to be inconsistent if there exists a proof in ''T'' of the formula "0&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1".  The formula I(''T''), which says that ''T'' is inconsistent, is thus an existential formula. A witness for the inconsistency of ''T'' is a particular proof of "0&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1" in ''T''.

Boolos, Burgess, and Jeffrey (2002:81) define the notion of a witness with the example, in which ''S'' is an ''n''-place relation on natural numbers, ''R'' is an ''n''-place [[computable set|recursive relation]], and &amp;harr; indicates [[logical equivalence]] (if and only if):
:: ''S''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;harr; ∃''y'' ''R''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, . . ., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y'')
:"A ''y'' such that ''R'' holds of the ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' may be called a 'witness' to the relation ''S'' holding of the ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' (provided we understand that when the witness is a number rather than a person, a witness only testifies to what is true)."
In this particular example, B-B-J have defined ''s'' to be ''(positively) recursively semidecidable'', or simply ''semirecursive''.

== Henkin witnesses ==

In [[predicate calculus]], a '''Henkin witness''' for a sentence &lt;math&gt;\exists x\, \varphi(x)&lt;/math&gt; in a theory ''T'' is a [[term (logic)|term]] ''c'' such that ''T'' proves ''φ''(''c'') (Hinman 2005:196). The use of such witnesses is a key technique in the proof of [[Gödel's completeness theorem]] presented by [[Leon Henkin]] in 1949.

== Relation to game semantics ==

The notion of witness leads to the more general idea of [[game semantics]]. In the case of sentence &lt;math&gt;\exists x\, \varphi(x)&lt;/math&gt; the winning strategy for the verifier is to pick a witness for &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;. For more complex formulas involving [[universal quantifier]]s, the existence of a winning strategy for the verifier depends on the existence of appropriate [[Skolem function]]s. For example, if ''S'' denotes &lt;math&gt;\forall x \, \exists y\, \varphi(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; then an [[equisatisfiable]] statement for ''S'' is &lt;math&gt;\exists f \,\forall x \, \varphi(x,f(x))&lt;/math&gt;. The Skolem function ''f'' (if it exists) actually codifies a winning strategy for the verifier of ''S'' by returning a witness for the existential sub-formula for every choice of ''x'' the falsifier might make.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4155">:''"Witt's theorem" or "the Witt theorem" may also refer to the [[Bourbaki–Witt theorem|Bourbaki–Witt fixed point theorem]] of order theory.''

In mathematics, '''Witt's theorem''', named after [[Ernst Witt]], is a basic result in the algebraic theory of [[quadratic form]]s:  any [[Isometry (quadratic forms)|isometry]] between two subspaces of a nonsingular [[quadratic space]] over a [[field (algebra)|field]] ''k'' may be extended to an isometry of the whole space.  An analogous statement holds also for skew-symmetric, Hermitian and skew-Hermitian [[bilinear form]]s over arbitrary fields. The theorem applies to classification of quadratic forms over ''k'' and in particular allows one to define the [[Witt group]] ''W''(''k'') which describes the "stable" theory of quadratic forms over the field ''k''.

== Statement of the theorem ==

Let {{nowrap|(''V'', ''b'')}} be a finite-dimensional vector space over a [[field (algebra)|field]] ''k'' of characteristic different from 2 together with a non-degenerate symmetric or skew-symmetric [[bilinear form]]. If {{nowrap|''f'' : ''U'' → ''U''′}} is an [[isometry]] between two subspaces of ''V'' then ''f'' extends to an isometry of ''V''.

Witt's theorem implies that the dimension of a maximal [[totally isotropic|totally isotropic subspace]] (null space) of ''V'' is an invariant, called the '''index''' or '''{{visible anchor|Witt index}}''' of ''b'',{{sfn|Lam|2005|p=12}} and moreover, that the [[isometry group]] of {{nowrap|(''V'', ''b'')}} [[group action|acts]] transitively on the set of maximal isotropic subspaces. This fact plays an important role in the structure theory and [[group representation|representation theory]] of the isometry group and in the theory of [[reductive dual pair]]s.

== Witt's cancellation theorem ==

Let {{nowrap|(''V'', ''q'')}}, {{nowrap|(''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, {{nowrap|(''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} be three quadratic spaces over a field ''k''. Assume that

: &lt;math&gt; (V_1,q_1)\oplus(V,q) \simeq (V_2,q_2)\oplus(V,q).&lt;/math&gt;

Then the quadratic spaces {{nowrap|(''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and {{nowrap|(''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} are isometric:

: &lt;math&gt; (V_1,q_1)\simeq (V_2,q_2).&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, the direct summand {{nowrap|(''V'', ''q'')}} appearing in both sides  of an isomorphism between quadratic spaces may be "cancelled".

== Witt's decomposition theorem ==

Let {{nowrap|(''V'', ''q'')}} be a quadratic space over a field ''k''. Then
it admits a '''Witt decomposition''':

: &lt;math&gt;(V,q)\simeq (V_0,0)\oplus(V_a, q_a)\oplus (V_h,q_h),&lt;/math&gt;

where {{nowrap|1=''V''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ker ''q''}} is the [[Radical of a quadratic space|radical]] of ''q'', {{nowrap|(''V''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is an [[anisotropic quadratic space]] and {{nowrap|(''V''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is a [[split quadratic space]]. Moreover, the anisotropic summand, termed the '''core form''', and the hyperbolic summand in a Witt decomposition of {{nowrap|(''V'', ''q'')}} are determined uniquely up to isomorphism.{{sfn|Lorenz|2008|p=30}}

Quadratic forms with the same core form are said to be ''similar'' or '''Witt equivalent'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7007">In [[algebra]], the '''zero-product property''' states that the product of two [[zero element|nonzero elements]] is nonzero.  In other words, it is the following assertion:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;ab = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;a=0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;b=0&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The zero-product property is also known as the '''rule of zero product''', the '''null factor law''', the '''multiplication property of zero''' or the '''nonexistence of nontrivial [[zero divisor]]s.'''  All of the [[number system]]s studied in [[elementary mathematics]] &amp;mdash; the [[integer]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[rational number]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[real number]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, and the [[complex number]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;mdash; satisfy the zero-product property.  In general, a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] which satisfies the zero-product property is called a [[Domain (ring theory)|domain]].

==Algebraic context==

Suppose &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an algebraic structure.  We might ask, does &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; have the zero-product property?  In order for this question to have meaning, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; must have both additive structure and multiplicative structure.&lt;ref group=note&gt;There must be a notion of zero (the [[additive identity]]) and a notion of products, i.e., multiplication.&lt;/ref&gt;  Usually one assumes that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]], though it could be something else, e.g., the nonnegative integers &lt;math&gt;\{0,1,2,\ldots\}&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the zero-product property, and if &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; also satisfies the zero product property: if &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are elements of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;ab=0&lt;/math&gt;, then either &lt;math&gt;a=0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;b=0&lt;/math&gt; because &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; can also be considered as elements of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==
* A ring in which the zero-product property holds is called a [[Domain (ring theory)|domain]].  A [[Commutative ring|commutative]] domain with a [[Unit element|multiplicative identity]] element is called an [[integral domain]].  Any [[Field (abstract algebra)|field]] is an integral domain; in fact, any subring of a field is an integral domain (as long as it contains 1).  Similarly, any subring of a [[skew field]] is a domain.  Thus, the zero-product property holds for any subring of a skew field.
* If &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a [[prime number]], then the ring of [[Modular arithmetic|integers modulo &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;]] has the zero-product property (in fact, it is a field).
* The [[Gaussian integers]] are an [[integral domain]] because they are a subring of the complex numbers.
* In the [[Skew field|strictly skew field]] of [[quaternions]], the zero-product property holds. This ring is not an integral domain, because the multiplication is not commutative.
* The set of nonnegative integers &lt;math&gt;\{0,1,2,\ldots\}&lt;/math&gt; is not a ring, but it does satisfy the zero-product property.

==Non-examples==

* Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; denote the ring of [[Modular arithmetic|integers modulo &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;]].  Then &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_6&lt;/math&gt; does not satisfy the zero product property: 2 and 3 are nonzero elements, yet &lt;math&gt;2 \cdot 3 \equiv 0 \pmod{6}&lt;/math&gt;.
* In general, if &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a [[composite number]], then &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; does not satisfy the zero-product property.  Namely, if &lt;math&gt;n = qm&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; q,m &lt; n&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; are nonzero modulo &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, yet &lt;math&gt;qm \equiv 0 \pmod{n}&lt;/math&gt;.
* The ring &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^{2 \times 2}&lt;/math&gt; of 2 by 2 [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] with [[integer]] entries does not satisfy the zero-product property: if

::&lt;math&gt;M = \begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; -1 \\ 0 &amp; 0\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N = \begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;,

:then

::&lt;math&gt;MN = \begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; -1 \\ 0 &amp; 0\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0\end{pmatrix} = 0&lt;/math&gt;,

:yet neither &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; nor &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is zero.

* The ring of all [[function (mathematics)|function]]s &lt;math&gt;f: [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, from the [[unit interval]] to the [[real number]]s, has nontrivial zero divisors: there are pairs of functions which are not identically equal to zero yet whose product is the zero function.  In fact, it is not hard to construct, for any ''n'' &amp;ge; 2, functions &lt;math&gt;f_1,\ldots,f_n&lt;/math&gt;, none of which is identically zero, such that &lt;math&gt;f_i \, f_j&lt;/math&gt; is identically zero whenever &lt;math&gt;i \neq j&lt;/math&gt;.
* The same is true even if we consider only continuous functions, or only even infinitely smooth functions.

==Application to finding roots of polynomials==
Suppose &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; are univariate polynomials with real coefficients, and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a real number such that &lt;math&gt;P(x)Q(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  (Actually, we may allow the coefficients and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to come from any integral domain.)  By the zero-product property, it follows that either &lt;math&gt;P(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;Q(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  In other words, the roots of &lt;math&gt;PQ&lt;/math&gt; are precisely the roots of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; together with the roots of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, one can use [[factorization of polynomials|factorization]] to find the roots of a polynomial.  For example, the polynomial &lt;math&gt;x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x + 6&lt;/math&gt; factorizes as &lt;math&gt;(x-3)(x-1)(x+2)&lt;/math&gt;; hence, its roots are precisely 3, 1, and -2.

In general, suppose &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is an integral domain and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Monic polynomial|monic]] univariate polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt;d \geq 1&lt;/math&gt; with coefficients in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.  Suppose also that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; distinct roots &lt;math&gt;r_1,\ldots,r_d \in R&lt;/math&gt;.  It follows (but we do not prove here) that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; factorizes as &lt;math&gt;f(x) = (x-r_1) \cdots (x-r_d)&lt;/math&gt;.  By the zero-product property, it follows that &lt;math&gt;r_1,\ldots,r_d&lt;/math&gt; are the ''only'' roots of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;: any root of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; must be a root of &lt;math&gt;(x-r_i)&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.  In particular, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has at most &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; distinct roots.

If however &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is not an integral domain, then the conclusion need not hold.  For example, the cubic polynomial &lt;math&gt;x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x&lt;/math&gt; has six roots in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_6&lt;/math&gt; (though it has only three roots in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;).
