The '''2007–08 Cork players' strike''' was a dispute in Republic of Ireland between the [[Cork GAA|Cork]] [[GAA county|County Board]] and its [[Gaelic football]]ers and [[Hurling|hurlers]]. It led to the footballers and hurlers refusing to play for the Cork County Board. The cause of the strike was the issue of deciding who should pick the [[List of Gaelic games terminology#S|senior]] teams' [[List of Gaelic games terminology#S|selectors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/breaking-news/sport/gaelic-football/cork-players-go-on-strike-over-selection-row-1243627.html
|accessdate=8 February 2008|title=Cork players go on strike over selection row | work=Irish Independent|date=10 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The players believed the [[Manager (Gaelic games)|manager]] should pick the selectors. However, the county board picked the selectors. With the appointment of [[Teddy Holland]] as manager, the players also refused to play under his tutorship since he accepted the job during their time of strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/teddy-holland-in-profile-1274660.html|title=Teddy Holland in profile|accessdate=8 February 2008 | work=Irish Independent|date=26 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strike drew comment from the [[Taoiseach]], [[Bertie Ahern]],&lt;ref name="irishexaminer.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ahern: both sides need to keep heads|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/text/story.asp?j=cwojaueygbojeyau&amp;p=z5x47xxx&amp;n=25047076|accessdate=8 February 2008}}{{dead link|date=June 2016}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first time in the [[history of the Gaelic Athletic Association]] that a strike caused [[GAA county|inter county]] fixtures not to be played.&lt;ref name="Holland sacked by Cork officials"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/2008/0218/hollandt.html|title=Holland sacked by Cork officials|accessdate=18 February 2008 | work=RTÉ News|date=18 February 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080219220328/http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/2008/0218/hollandt.html| archivedate= 19 February 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cork went on to win their first football and hurling matches after the strike, beating Dublin's hurlers 2–16 to 3–18&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/2008/0309/dublin_cork.html|title=Dublin 2–16 Cork 3–18|accessdate=16 March 2008 | work=RTÉ News|date=9 March 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080313021623/http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/2008/0309/dublin_cork.html| archivedate= 13 March 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hill16.ie/viewstoryhill16.asp?mainheading=Word+on+The+Hill&amp;id=9693&amp;viewstory=yes |title=Cork finish with flourish to deflate Dubs |accessdate=16 March 2008 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Roscommon GAA|Roscommon]]'s footballers 0–15 to 1–14&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/gaa_results_footballleague.html|accessdate=6 March 2008|title=Allianz National Football League | work=RTÉ News| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080219063226/http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/gaa_results_footballleague.html| archivedate= 19 February 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the decision to award the teams that Cork did not play victory points had a knock-on effect for other teams in both leagues.

===Hurling league controversy===
When the [[National Hurling League 2008]] ended, the Cork and [[Waterford GAA|Waterford]] hurling teams both finished on level points. The CCCC ruled that the teams had to play each other in a [[play-off]] and that scoring difference could not be used to separate the teams. (The play-off was to determine which team entered the semi-final and which entered the quarter final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoganstand.com/ArticleForm.aspx?ID=91778|title=Playoff for Cork and Waterford|accessdate=26 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

However, both [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]] and [[Wexford GAA|Wexford]] also finished on level points and, having both played Cork, the CCCC ruled the team's standings at the end of the league could be used and thus scoring difference would apply, thus relegating Wexford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoganstand.com/Dublin/ArticleForm.aspx?ID=91777|title=Wexford lose out|accessdate=26 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lead Wexford's chairman to accuse the GAA and the CCCC of "making the rules up as they go along".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/hurling/wexford-chairman-accuses-gaa-of-making-up-rules-as-they-go-along-1327336.html|title=Wexford chairman accuses GAA of 'making up rules as they go along'|accessdate=26 March 2008 | work=Irish Independent|first=Colm|last=Keys|date=26 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2008 ANZ Championship season''' was the inaugural season of the [[ANZ Championship]], a new [[trans-Tasman]] [[netball]] competition replacing [[Australia]]'s [[Commonwealth Bank Trophy]] and [[New Zealand]]'s [[National Bank Cup]]. The 2008 season began on 5 April, with competing franchises playing each other once, and playing each franchise from their home country a second time. Four teams progressed to the finals stage, played over three weeks. The grand final was played on 28 July at [[Acer Arena]] in [[Sydney]], with the [[New South Wales Swifts]] emerging victorious over minor premiers the [[Waikato/Bay of Plenty Magic]]. Overall, 6792 goals were scored during the season, averaging 98.44 per match.

==Teams==
The inaugural season featured five teams from both Australia and New Zealand. In Australia, one team represented each participating [[States of Australia|state]]. In New Zealand, each team represented one or more [[Regions of New Zealand|regions]].

'''Association Sportive Sud-Est''' (or simply '''AS Sud-Est''' or '''ASSE''') is a professional [[football (soccer)|football]] club based in [[Sud-Est (department)|Sud-Est]], [[Haiti]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/live-scores/clubs/club=haiti-asse-2000019574/index.html FIFA: ASSE]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://score.fr/haiti-d1-nouvelle-saison-debute-week-end.html |title=Haïti – D1 : La nouvelle saison débute ce week-end! |editor=Vieri, Keke |date=3 March 2017 |publisher=Score.fr |accessdate=19 March 2017}} {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club was the 2016 Division 2 Championship (''Championnat d'Ascension''), and quickly elevated to Division 1 in less than two years since its founding. Former Senator, Senator Edwin (Edo) Zenny is honorary President.&lt;ref name="Bordes"/&gt;

==History==
The Association Sportive Sud-Est was founded on 28 February 2015. It won the Division 2 and was promoted to Division 1 after the 2016 season. Its first match in D1 came against [[América des Cayes]], where the match ended in a 1–1 draw. Its first win in the top division came against [[Tempête FC]] on 18 March 2017 ending the match 0–3.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/live-scores/nationalleagues/nationalleague=haiti-premiere-division-2000000153/matches/index.html#month3-2017 FIFA - Matches: March 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13600">'''Abdominal exercises''' are those that affect the [[Abdomen#Muscles|abdominal muscles]] (colloquially known as the stomach muscles or "abs").

==Effects==
Abdominal exercises are useful for building the [[Abdomen#Muscles|abdominal muscles]]. This is useful for improving performance with certain sports, back pain, and for withstanding abdominal impacts (e.g., taking punches). According to a 2011 study, abdominal muscle exercises are known to increase the strength and endurance of the abdominal muscles.&lt;ref name=vispute&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181fb4a46 |title=The Effect of Abdominal Exercise on Abdominal Fat |year=2011 |last1=Vispute |first1=Sachin S |last2=Smith |first2=John D |last3=Lecheminant |first3=James D |last4=Hurley |first4=Kimberly S |journal=Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research |volume=25 |issue=9 |pages=2559–64 |pmid=21804427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been highly disputed whether or not abdominal exercises have any reducing effect on abdominal fat. The aforementioned 2011 study found that abdominal exercise does not reduce abdominal fat; to achieve that, a deficit in energy expenditure and caloric intake must be created—abdominal exercises alone are not enough to reduce abdominal fat and the girth of the abdomen.&lt;ref name=vispute/&gt; Early results from a 2006 study found that walking exercise (not abdominal exercise specifically) reduced the size of subcutaneous abdominal fat cells; cell size predicts type 2 [[diabetes]] according to a lead author. Moderate exercise reduced cell size by about 18% in 45 obese women over a 20-week period; diet alone did not appear to affect cell size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/sj.ijo.0803245 |title=Addition of aerobic exercise to dietary weight loss preferentially reduces abdominal adipocyte size |year=2006 |last1=You |first1=T |last2=Murphy |first2=K M |last3=Lyles |first3=M F |last4=Demons |first4=J L |last5=Lenchik |first5=L |last6=Nicklas |first6=B J |journal=International Journal of Obesity |volume=30 |issue=8 |pages=1211–6 |pmid=16446745 |laysummary=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/08/060807154847.htm |laysource=ScienceDaily |laydate=August 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions of abdominal muscles==
Abdominal muscles have many important functions, including in breathing, coughing, and sneezing, and maintaining posture and speech in a number of species.&lt;ref name="Iscoe 1998"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0301-0082(98)00046-X |title=Control of abdominal muscles |year=1998 |last1=Iscoe |first1=S |journal=Progress in Neurobiology |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=433–506 |pmid=9775401}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anterior abdominal wall is made up of four muscles—the [[rectus abdominis muscle]], the internal and external [[abdominal muscle|obliques]], and the [[transversus abdominis]]."The two internal muscles, the internal oblique and the transverse abdominis, respond more to increases in chemical or volume-related drive than the two external muscles, the rectus abdominis and external oblique; the basis for this differential sensitivity is unknown".&lt;ref name="Iscoe 1998"/&gt;

==Core training==
{{details|topic=Core|Core (anatomy)}}
Not only can a one-sided preference for abdominal muscles (lack of exercise focused on other core muscles) result in creating muscle imbalances, but the effectiveness of exercise is also far from what could be achieved with a balanced workout planning. Core training frequently utilizes balance exercises. These are characterized by an unstable position that requires the use of a wide range of muscles which help balance oscillation of the center of gravity. We can balance both in static positions and while performing dynamic movements.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The goal of core training is definitely not to develop muscle hypertrophy but to improve functional predispositions of physical activity. This particularly involves improving intra- and intermuscular coordination or synchronization of participating muscles.

Involvement of the core means more than just compressing abdominal muscles when in crouching or seated position. The role of the core muscles is to stabilize the spine. Resisting expansion or rotation is as important as the ability to execute movement.

==Types==
The abdominal muscles can be worked out by practicing disciplines of general body strength such as [[Pilates]], [[yoga]], [[T'ai chi ch'uan|T'ai chi]], and [[jogging]] among others.{{according to whom|date=May 2014}} There are also specific routines to target each of these muscles.

===Momentaneous activity===
One way to estimate the effectiveness of any abdominal exercise is in measuring the momentaneous{{technical statement|date=May 2014}} activity by [[electromyography]] (EMG), with the activity generally being compared to that of the [[Crunch (exercise)|traditional crunch]]. However, an exercise of lower activity performed during a longer time can give at least as much exercise as a high-activity exercise, with the main difference being that a prolonged duration results more in [[aerobic exercise]] than [[strength training]].

The following tables rank abdominal exercises from highest to lowest in terms of activity as determined by the EMG measures:&lt;ref name="emg"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2001 |first1=Mark |last1=Anders |url=http://www.acefitness.org/getfit/studies/BestWorstAbExercises.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815200229/http://www.acefitness.org/getfit/studies/BestWorstAbExercises.pdf |archivedate=August 15, 2007 |journal=ACE fitnessmatters |title=New Study Puts the Crunch on Ineffective Ab Exercises |pages=9–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bicycle crunch===
The bicycle targets the rectus abdominals and the obliques. Also, the rectus abdominals can be worked out with the basic crunch, the vertical crunch, the reverse crunch, and the full vertical crunch, and when at a low enough body fat percentage (10-12% for males, 15-18% for females) the individual parts of the muscle become visible; many refer to this visible separation as a [[Rectus abdominis muscle|six pack]]. By exercising the internal and external obliques the stomach can be flattened while the [[waist]] line can be reduced.&lt;ref name="D"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-exercise-advice.com/abdominal-muscle-anatomy.html |title=Abdominal Muscle Anatomy |date=|accessdate=2010-07-13| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100727051108/http://www.abs-exercise-advice.com/abdominal-muscle-anatomy.html| archivedate= 27 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The long arm crunch, in which arms are straightened behind you, adds a longer lever to the move and emphasizes the upper part of the abs. The plank exercise not only strengthens the abs but also the back and stabilizes the muscles.&lt;ref name="E"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exercise.about.com/od/abs/ss/abexercises_10.htm |title=Top 10 Most Effective Ab Exercises|date=|accessdate=2010-07-13| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100811025658/http://exercise.about.com/od/abs/ss/abexercises_10.htm| archivedate= 11 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gadgets===
Abdominal exercises can also be performed with the help of some machines and the [[captain's chair]] is one of the most popular machines used in [[gyms]] and [[health clubs]]. Other machines are the Ab Roller, the Ab Rocket Twister, the Chin-up bar in conjunction with Ab Straps and the Torso Track. The [[exercise ball]] is also a tool that helps strengthen the abs. It may be more effective than the crunches on the [[floor]] because the abs do more work as the legs are not involved in the exercise.&lt;ref name="F"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exercise.about.com/od/abs/ss/abexercises_10.htm |title=Top 10 Most Effective Ab Exercises |date=|accessdate=2010-07-13| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100811025658/http://exercise.about.com/od/abs/ss/abexercises_10.htm| archivedate= 11 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to the Ab-Slide, the study performed by Bird et al. showed greater muscle activation in the upper rectus abdominis, lower rectus abdominis, and external oblique when compared to the standard abdominal crunch. The Ab-Slide has proven to be an effective tool in strengthening the abdominal muscles from a concentric muscle action perspective. However, this research does not support replacing the traditional crunch exercise with the Ab-Slide gadget due to the lack of proven effectiveness in the eccentric loading of the abdominal muscles and the greater postural control.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bird, Kate M. Fletcher, and Alex J. Koch. Electromyographic Comparison of the Ab-Slide and Crunch Exercises. Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research. 20(2), 436–440, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exercise.about.com/od/abs/ss/abexercises_10.htm |title=Top 10 Most Effective Ab Exercises |accessdate=2010-07-13| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100811025658/http://exercise.about.com/od/abs/ss/abexercises_10.htm| archivedate= 11 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potentially the most effective equipment for abdominal strengthening are those that offer the least stability. Examples include the CoreFitnessRoller, bodyweight suspension training such as TRX and stability balls with or without the Halo.

==Safety of abdominal exercises==
Abdominal exercises also put some degree of compressive force on the lumbar spine, putting unwanted stress on the lower back. In addition, exaggerated abdominal exercise can cause respiratory problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |id={{INIST|18626671}} |doi=10.1152/ajpregu.00409.2006 |title=Increased fatigue resistance of respiratory muscles during exercise after respiratory muscle endurance training |year=2006 |last1=Verges |first1=Samuel |last2=Lenherr |first2=Oliver |last3=Haner |first3=Andrea C. |last4=Schulz |first4=Christian |last5=Spengler |first5=Christina M. |journal=American Journal of Physiology. Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiology |volume=292 |issue=3 |pages=R1246–53 |pmid=17068160}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of twelve exercises concluded that no single [[exercise]] covered all abdominal muscles with high intensity and low compression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | volume=29 | issue=6 | pages=804–810 | year=1997 | author=CT Axler|author2=SM McGill | journal=Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise | title=Low back loads over a variety of abdominal exercises: Searching for the safest abdominal challenge | pmid = 9219209 | doi=10.1097/00005768-199706000-00011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The benefit of focused training on the "deep core" muscles such as the [[Transversus abdominis muscle|transversus abdominis]] has been disputed, with some experts advocating a more comprehensive training regimen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

{{Nihongo||馬術|'''Bajutsu'''}} is a [[Japan]]ese form of military [[equestrianism]].

==History==
Although its origins are closely related to those of mounted archery (''[[yabusame]]''), bajutsu is considered a distinct and separate martial art, and there are a number of traditional schools, such as the Ogasawara, Otsubo, and Hachijo.&lt;ref&gt;Mass, Jeffrey P.; ''The Origins of Japan's Medieval World: Courtiers, Clerics, Warriors, and Peasants in the Fourteenth Century'' Stanford University Press, 2002. footnote p433&lt;/ref&gt; The art originated in the 7th century AD during the reign of [[Emperor Tenji]]&lt;ref&gt;''Kodansha encyclopedia of Japan, Volume 3'' Kodansha, 1983 p229&lt;/ref&gt; but was popularised in the 12th century as large-scale mounted warfare became more common.&lt;ref&gt;Deal, william E.; ''Handbook to life in medieval and early modern Japan'' Oxford University Press, 2007, p155&lt;/ref&gt; However, the comparative scarcity of horses in Japan meant that bajutsu was always an elite art, restricted to high-ranking [[samurai]].&lt;ref name="Lowry"&gt;Lowry, d; ''The Karate Way: Discovering the Spirit of Practice'' Shambhala Publications, 2009 p55&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, many contemporary historians ignored the numbers of foot-soldiers in battles and referred to the size of armies by the number of horsemen alone.&lt;ref name="Friday"&gt;Friday, Karl; ''Samurai, warfare and the state in early medieval Japan'' Psychology Press, 2004 p96-101&lt;/ref&gt;

The comparative peace of the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa era]] from 1600 onwards led to a decline in the military practice of bajutsu, and it became relegated to a more ceremonial role,&lt;ref&gt;Ratti, O and Westbrook, A; ''Secrets of the samurai: a survey of the martial arts of feudal Japan'' Tuttle Publishing, 1991 p292&lt;/ref&gt; indeed, the practice of horsemanship was actively discouraged during the reign of [[Tokugawa Tsunayoshi]].&lt;ref&gt;Murdoch, J; ''A history of Japan: volume 3'', Routledge, 2004, p192&lt;/ref&gt; By the beginning of the 20th century there were more than 20 schools of bajutsu&lt;ref&gt;Frédéric, Louis; ''Japan encyclopedia'' Harvard University Press, 2005 p354&lt;/ref&gt; and the Japan Bajutsu Federation was formed in Tokyo in 1946 to promote it as a modern sport.&lt;ref&gt;Japan Tsūrisuto Byūrō, ''Japan: the new official guide'' Japan Travel Bureau, 1957 p221&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
As well as requiring proficiency in riding and mounted sword-fighting, the art also included teachings on the care and upkeep of horses.&lt;ref&gt;Durbin, W: ''The Fighting Arts of the Samurai: a Warrior's Combat Handbook'' in ''Black Belt Magazine'' March 1990 Vol. 28, No. 3 ISSN 0277-3066&lt;/ref&gt; Horses were trained to ignore sudden shocks, and to press forward in the charge, veering off at the last second to allow the rider to kick with his battering-ram-like [[Abumi (Japanese stirrup)|stirrups]].&lt;ref name=Lowry/&gt; These stirrups (''shitanaga abumi'') were designed to enable the rider to stand and shoot easily from the [[Kura (Japanese saddle)|saddle]].&lt;ref name=Friday/&gt; Cavalry charges were made possible by the development of [[Yari|spear]] techniques from horseback in the late 14th century, supplanting the mounted archery styles that had previously dominated.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, Stephen; ''War in Japan 1467-1615''Osprey Publishing, 2002 p16&lt;/ref&gt; Such charges were used to great effect by the [[Takeda clan]], who introduced the tactic during the mid- to late- sixteenth century,&lt;ref name="Grant2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=R. G. Grant|title=Commanders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sxY4Tz_R4NUC&amp;pg=PA120|accessdate=15 June 2012|date=1 March 2011|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|isbn=978-1-4053-3696-3|pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after the [[Battle of Nagashino]], were used only in conjunction with infantry manouevres.&lt;ref name="Turnbull2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Turnbull|title=War in Japan 1467-1615|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tYnqTBN19TYC&amp;pg=PA18|accessdate=15 June 2012|date=19 August 2002|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84176-480-1|pages=18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Best Male Athlete ESPY Award''', known alternatively as the '''Outstanding Male Athlete ESPY Award''', has been presented annually at the [[ESPY Award]]s since 1993 to the male voted irrespective of nationality or sport contested, adjudged to be the best athlete in a given [[calendar year]].  Between 1993 and 2004, the award voting panel comprised variously fans; sportswriters and broadcasters, sports executives, and retired sportspersons, termed collectively ''experts''; and [[List of ESPN personalities|ESPN personalities]], but balloting thereafter has been exclusively by fans over the Internet from amongst choices selected by the ESPN Select Nominating Committee.  Through the 2001 iteration of the ESPY Awards, ceremonies were conducted in February of each year to honor achievements over the previous calendar year; awards presented thereafter are conferred in June and reflect performance from the June previous.&lt;ref&gt;Because of the [[ESPY Awards#Timing|rescheduling]] of the ESPY Awards ceremony, the award presented in 2002 was given in consideration of performance betwixt February 2001 and June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three American athletes, [[golf]]er [[Tiger Woods]], [[road bicycle racing|road cyclist]] [[Lance Armstrong]], and [[basketball]] player [[LeBron James]], have won the award multiple times.  Woods was honored five times: in 1998 (jointly with [[Ken Griffey Jr.]]), 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2008.  Armstrong was honored four times from 2003 to 2006 inclusive while James received the trophy in 2012, 2013 and 2016.  Basketball is the most successful sport, its players having received a total of eight awards since its inception.  The award has been won by a non-American twice &amp;ndash; in 2011 by German basketball player [[Dirk Nowitzki]] and in 2018 by Russian hockey player Alexander Ovechkin.  The 2017 winner of the Best Male Athlete ESPY Award was basketball player [[Russell Westbrook]] who received his trophy at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=latest/&gt;

'''Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques''' (CMAS) is an international federation that represents underwater activities in [[underwater sports|underwater sport]] and underwater sciences, and oversees an international system of recreational [[snorkelling|snorkel]] and [[scuba diving|scuba diver]] training and recognition.  It is also known by its English name, the ''World Underwater Federation'', and its Spanish name, ''Confederacion Mundial De Actividades Subacuaticas''. Its foundation in [[Monaco]] during January 1959 makes it one of the world's oldest [[underwater diving]] organisations.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Cave Diving Group]] (CDG) was founded in 1946 in the UK. The [[British Sub-Aqua Club]] (BSAC) was founded in 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:The 1958 meeting.gif|thumb|200px|]] --&gt;
An international congress of diving federations representing all underwater disciplines met in [[Brussels]] on 28 September 1958. National
delegates attended from following countries: Belgium, Brazil, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Greece, Italy, Monaco, Portugal, Switzerland, the United States of America and the former [[Yugoslavia]]. Following a decision at that congress, a meeting was held in [[Monaco]] on 9–11 January 1959, which officially established the World Underwater Federation, with an acronym based on its French title as ''CMAS''.&lt;ref name="aboutcmas" /&gt;

A founding member and key proponent of ''CMAS'' was the French underwater explorer and diving pioneer [[Jacques-Yves Cousteau]] who was chosen to be the inaugural president with Luigi Ferraro, Italian underwater pioneer, appointed as vice-president.&lt;ref name=" Luigi Ferraro; C.M.A.S." /&gt;

CMAS succeeded the ''Comité des Sports Sous-Marins'' (Underwater Sports Committee) of the [[Confédération Internationale de la Pêche Sportive]] (CIPS) (International Confederation of Sport Fishing), which was founded on 22 February 1952.&lt;ref name="aboutcmas" /&gt;&lt;ref name=" Luigi Ferraro; C.M.A.S." /&gt;

== Organisation ==
CMAS consists of three major committees - sport, technical and scientific.&lt;ref name="technical" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sport" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scientific" /&gt;  These committees are overseen by a board of directors (BoD) elected periodically at the annually convened general assembly. The BoD, the sport committee and the scientific committee oversee sub-committees known as commissions. Day-to-day operation is overseen by a steering committee appointed from the BoD. Its headquarters is currently located in [[Rome]].

=== The steering committee ===
The steering committee consists of seven members. As of 2013, the members were:&lt;ref name="steering" /&gt;
{{div col |colwidth=30em}}
*President - Anna Arzhanova (Russia)
*Secretary general - Hassen Baccouche (Tunisia)
*Vice president - Xavier Duran Soler (Spain)
*President sports committee - Ilias Xiarchos  (Greece)
*President technical committee - Jean Rondia  (Belgium)
*President scientific committee - Ralph Schill (Germany)
*Treasurer - Alain Germain (France)
{{div col end}}

== Sport committee ==
The sports committee consists of commissions representing the following underwater sports - [[Free-diving#Competitive freediving|apnoea]], [[Aquathlon (underwater wrestling)|aquathlon]],  [[finswimming]], [[spearfishing]], [[Sport Diving (competitive scuba)|sport diving]], [[underwater hockey]], [[underwater orienteering]],  [[underwater rugby]] and [[underwater target shooting]].&lt;ref name="aquathon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="orienteering" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sportdiving" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Target Shooting|url=http://www.cmas.org/target-shooting/about-target-shooting|publisher=Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques|accessdate=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   An additional commission known as "visual" represents the sports of [[Underwater photography (sport)|underwater photography]] and underwater video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Underwater Photography &amp; News of the Visual Commission|url=http://www.cmas.org/visual|publisher=Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques|accessdate=4 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All of those sports are governed at the international level uniquely by CMAS with exception of apnoea in which competition and governance is also provided by a rival organisation, [[AIDA International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aida International|url=http://www.aidainternational.org/|publisher=AIDA International|accessdate=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of the technical committee is the provision of "safe diving for CMAS members" and seeks to achieve this by "promoting world class standards for all aspects of Scuba Diving and ensuring adherence of them by member federations and dive providers".&lt;ref name="About-CMAS-TC" /&gt;  Its officers who are elected from persons nominated at the CMAS General Assembly by affiliated national diving federations include the following positions - president, secretary, standards director, education director, technical director, diving security director, special tasks director and a number of general members.  It oversees the two following systems - a diver training standards system known as the "CMAS International Diver Training Standards" and a certification system known as "CMAS International Diver Certificates".&lt;ref name="About-CMAS-TC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Learn To Dive" /&gt;

Since CMAS effectively started as a volunteer organisation for hobbyists, its courses tend to reflect the full range of European and world diving standards. Compared to other diving organisations which may be more geared towards holiday and tropical water diving. While organisations like [[PADI]] or [[Scuba Schools International|SSI]] tend to bring divers into the water immediately, CMAS entry-level training is more extensive, featuring more "classroom" delivered theory.&lt;ref name="dtp" /&gt;

=== Qualifications ===

====Standards, certification and training delivery====
[[File:CMAS-Ausbildung.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|The CMAS training system.]]
The CMAS Technical Committee has developed a qualification system currently known as the "CMAS International Diver Training Standards" which consists of published universal standards for [[recreational diving]], [[technical diving]] and [[Diving instructor|leadership diver grades]].&lt;ref name=" CMAS-S+P" /&gt;

The CMAS Technical Committee has also developed a [[Diving certification|diving certification system]] called the "CMAS International Diver Training Certification System" for most of its diver training standards and which permits divers that have been trained in accordance with the CMAS International Diver Training Standards, to have their training recognised worldwide particularly in countries where CMAS affiliated federations exist. The system includes a double sided certification card format where one side depicts the achieved CMAS standard while the other side has details of the issuing organisation and the diver.&lt;ref name="Learn To Dive" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Certificate format" /&gt;

CMAS itself does not provide training or conduct the issuing of certifications - this is available from two sources.  Firstly, from national diving federations affiliated to the CMAS Technical Committee using their member diving clubs, their member instructors where the federation is exclusively an instructor organisation or by agreement with independent underwater diving training organizations operating in the countries where those federations are based.&lt;ref name="CMAS Technical Committee Affiliates" /&gt;&lt;ref name=CMAS-ISA /&gt;&lt;ref name="SEI Organizational Standards" /&gt;  Secondly, from specially accredited dive centres known as "CMAS Dive Centers" (CDC) who use dedicated CMAS training materials.&lt;ref name="CMAS Diving Centers" /&gt;

==== Recreational diver training programmes ====

The committee considers its main task is to bring to the attention of the world underwater diving community, the important issues concerning the marine environment and how divers can play a major role in protecting it by serving as frontline observers of its overall health, particularly in respect to invasive species, coastal ecosystems and biodiversity.&lt;ref name="about scientific" /&gt;
Its officers who are elected from persons nominated at the CMAS General Assembly by affiliated national diving federations include the following positions - president, secretary, a number of general members and presidents of the following commissions - marine biology, marine archaeology, geology and professional relationships.&lt;ref name="scientific" /&gt;

===Scientific diving codes===
Over a 10-year period from 1977, it was responsible for the development of the "Code of Practice for Scientific Diving" for [[UNESCO]]&lt;ref name="Flemming" /&gt;  in cooperation with [[National Sea Grant College Program|Sea Grant]]. {{citation needed| date=March 2013}}

===Qualifications===
The CMAS Scientific Committee oversees a system of diving standards and certification that operates in parallel to the CMAS International Diver Training Certification System.
The system was developed to which recognize the status of a diver who is qualified to dive in the course of research whilst employed.  This internationally recognized standard of competence is a distinct advantage for working scientists who wish to travel between laboratories and institutes in different countries.
Known as the CMAS Scientific Diver Standard, the system consists of the following diver and instructor grades:
* CMAS Scientific Diver (CSD) (pre-requisite of CMAS 2 Star Diver plus scientific diver training)
* CMAS Advanced Scientific Diver (CASD) (pre-requisite of CMAS 3 Star Diver plus advanced scientific diver training)
* CMAS Scientific Diving Instructor (pre-requisite: CMAS 2 Star Instructor)
* CMAS Confirmed Scientific Diving Instructor (pre-requisite: CMAS 3 Star Instructor)
A programme of specialist courses both at entry and advanced levels in [[underwater archaeology]], [[freshwater biology]], [[marine biology]], [[marine geology]] and [[oceanology]] is also offered.
Training and certification (also known as brevets) for the above qualifications is available from organisations known as CMAS Scientific Centres (CSC).&lt;ref name="Scientific diver" /&gt;

'''Flowriding''' (or Flowboarding) is a late-20th century alternative boardsport incorporating elements of [[surfing]], [[bodyboarding]], [[skateboarding]], [[skimboarding]], [[snowboarding]] and [[wakeboarding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tan|first=Les|title=Singapore’s Ili Lim wins overall flowriding title|url=http://www.redsports.sg/2010/11/03/ili-lim-champion-flowriding/|work=RedSports|publisher=Red Sports|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flowriders ride on artificial waves that are technically called "sheet waves". Powerful pumps project a three-inch layer of water at speeds ranging from 20 MPH to 30 MPH.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Flowriding"&gt;{{cite web|last=Guy|first=Wisdom|title=An Introduction To Flowriding|url=http://www.menshealth.com.sg/guy-wisdom/introduction-flowriding|publisher=Men's Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The water flows up and over surfaces engineered to replicate the shape of ocean waves. Sheet waves are stationary waves, in that the wave does not move forward, and the movement is derived from water flowing over a stationary surface. Flowriders get their speed from the energy of the water flowing at them, and can perform basic to sophisticated turns and tricks within a relatively small area&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.myactivesg.com/sports/alternative-sport/training-method/alternative-sport-for-beginners/flowboarding-riding-the-waves|title=Flowboarding: Riding the waves|website=ActiveSG|language=en|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.star2.com/travel/2018/04/18/survived-first-flowboarding-experience/|title=How I Survived My First Flowboarding Experience {{!}} Star2.com|date=2018-04-18|work=Star2.com|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though there are a number of different types of structures used for flowriding, the two which are recognized at a competitive level are the [[WhiteWater West]] Single and Double FlowRiders and the [[WhiteWater West]] FlowBarrel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tan|first=Les|title=Singapore’s Ili Lim wins overall flowriding title|url=http://www.redsports.sg/2010/11/03/ili-lim-champion-flowriding/|work=RedSports|publisher=Red Sports|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sports has two main divisions, based on the type of board: the flowboard and the [[bodyboard]].

==Flowboard==
The flowboard is also known as the 'stand-up board' in flowriding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Damon|first=Poppy|title=Feeling the Flow – Adam Wildman, Flowrider|url=http://www.australiantimes.co.uk/sport/more-sport/feeling-the-flow-adam-wildman-flowrider.htm|work=Australian Times|publisher=Blue Sky Publications Ltd|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently there are three mainstream board brands: Outlaw, ShuvIt and Carve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.flowridershop.com/product-category/flowboards/|title=Flowboards {{!}} FlowRider Shop|website=FlowRider Shop|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; These boards differ in shape, materials, lengths and the angle at which the board curves. Generally they take a similar appearance to that of a wakeboard and can be further categorized into strapped and strapless boards. Boards with footstraps are generally used only on the FlowBarrel, but strapless boards are used on both the FlowRider and FlowBarrel. Flowboards range in length from: 910 millimeters (36 inches) to 1070 millimeters (42 inches); and in width from 280 millimeters (11 inches) to 356 millimeters (14 inches). They weigh between 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) and 2.8 kilograms (6 pounds)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.flowridershop.com/product-category/flowboards/|title=Flowboards {{!}} FlowRider Shop|website=FlowRider Shop|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the tricks incorporated in flowriding are inspired by skateboarding and wakeboarding. Riders are able to perform various maneuvers varying in difficulty such as carving, rotations varying in degree (90°, 180°, 360°), pop-shuvits and variations, kick-flips, foot-plant and fast-plant variations, and many more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Surf House Phuket|title=What is Flowboarding?|date=2017-08-02|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0q1I5mZc-A|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bodyboard==
Bodyboarders ride standard [[bodyboard]]s in the prone, kneeling, or drop-knee position. Each position forms the basis for its own set of tricks. In most competitions, bodyboarders are required to do tricks in both prone and kneeling positions. There are four brands most would look to for bodyboards; Custom X and World Class Bodyboards&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.flowridershop.com/product-category/bodyboards/|title=Bodyboards {{!}} FlowRider Shop|website=FlowRider Shop|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The Flowboarding League of the World (or FLOW), run by WhiteWater West Inc, hosts flowboarding competitions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.flowboarders.com/competitions/|title=Competitions - FlowBoarders {{!}} The best of Flowboarding 24/7|work=FlowBoarders {{!}} The best of Flowboarding 24/7|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. They regularly host the North American Flow Tour, Flow Tour Asia, Flow Tour Europe, as well as the World Flowboarding Championship, with occasional Special Events as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.flowboarders.com/competitions/|title=Competitions - FlowBoarders {{!}} The best of Flowboarding 24/7|work=FlowBoarders {{!}} The best of Flowboarding 24/7|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competitions==
Currently there are two main categories of competitions in the United States, The North American Flow Tour Prime Events as well as Flow Series events.  Both hold contests at different venues around the country.  Competitors compete in divisions by age and gender and are generally given three 30-45 second judged runs and the best two are counted.  Past reputable judges have included Sean Silveira, JP O'Brien, Eric Silverman, Chuck Wright, Theo Koby, Nick Sanchez, Adam Muller, Brad Spencer as well as many others. There are also two main categories of competitions in the United Kingdom, European Flow Tour and UK Flow Tour.

[[File:football iu 1996.jpg|thumb|The forward (10, red) is past the defence (16, white) and is about to take a [[Shooting (association football)|shot]] at the goal. The [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] will attempt to stop the forward from scoring a goal by preventing the ball from passing the goal line.]]
'''Forwards''' are the players on an [[association football]] team who play nearest to the opposing team's goal, and are therefore most responsible for scoring [[Goal (sport)#Association football|goals]].

Their advanced position and limited defensive responsibilities mean forwards normally score more goals on behalf of their team than other players.

Modern [[formation (association football)|team formations]] generally include one to three forwards; for example, the common [[Formation (association football)#4–2–3–1|4–2–3–1]] formation includes one forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/09/03/fifa-2010-technical-report-summary/|title=FIFA's 289-page Technical Report on the 2010 World Cup – in 15 points|accessdate=17 August 2013|first=Michael|last=Cox|date=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unconventional formations may include more than three forwards, or none.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/03/19/barcelona-4-2-4-formation-guardiola-messi/|title=Is Barcelona's alternative shape really a 4–2–4?|accessdate=17 August 2013|first=Michael|last=Cox|date=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/03/05/teams-of-the-decade-5-roma-2007/|title=Teams of the Decade #5: Roma, 2007|accessdate=17 August 2013|first=Michael|last=Cox|date=5 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Centre-forward==
[[File:Ronaldo Real Madrid.jpg|thumb|right|Brazilian striker [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] taking a shot at goal. A multi-functional forward he has influenced a generation of strikers who followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smyth|first1=Rob|title=Ronaldo at 40: Il Fenomeno’s legacy as greatest ever No 9, despite dodgy knees|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/17/ronaldo-40-birthday-brazil-greatest-ever-striker|publisher=''The Guardian''|date=17 September 2016|access-date=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The traditional role of a centre-forward is to score the majority of goals on behalf of the team. The player may also be used to win [[long ball]]s or receive passes and retain possession of the ball with their back to goal as [[Team sport|teammates]] advance, in order to provide depth for their team or help teammates score by providing a pass ('through ball' into the [[Penalty area (football)|box]]); the latter variation usually requiring quicker pace and good movement. Most modern centre-forwards operate in front of the second strikers or central attacking midfielders, and do the majority of the ball handling outside the box. The present role of centre-forward is sometimes interchangeable with that of an [[attacking midfielder]], especially in the 4–3–1–2 or 4–1–2–1–2 formations. The term '''"target man"''' is often used to describe a particular type of striker whose main role is to win high balls in the air and create chances for other members of the team (not necessarily scoring many goals themselves).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sportslingo.com/sports-glossary/t/target-man/|title=Target Man Definition In Soccer - Meanings &amp; Examples From SportsLingo.com|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These players are usually tall and physically strong, being adept at heading the ball. The term centre-forward is taken from the early football playing [[Formation (association football)|formation]] in which there were five ''forward'' players: two [[outside forward]]s, two [[inside forward]]s, and one centre-forward.

When numbers were introduced in the 1933 [[1933 FA Cup Final|English FA Cup final]], one of the two centre-forwards that day wore the number nine – [[Everton F.C.|Everton's]] [[Dixie Dean]] a strong, powerful forward who had set the record for the most goals scored in a season in [[Football in England|English football]] during the 1927–28 season. The number would then become synonymous with the centre-forward position (only worn that day because one team was numbered 1–11 whilst the other was numbered 12–22).&lt;ref name=sports.yahoo.com&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/soccer-dirty-tackle/mystery-solved--why-do-the-best-soccer-players-wear-no--10-052229677.html|title=Mystery solved: Why do the best soccer players wear No. 10?|publisher=Yahoo|author1=Khalil Garriot|date=21 June 2014|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Striker==
[[File:Omar Batistuta.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Gabriel Batistuta]] holding his old number 9 Fiorentina jersey. The number most associated with the position, he was an out and out striker]]
The role of a striker is rather different from that of a traditional centre-forward, although the terms centre-forward and striker are used interchangeably at times, as both play further up the field than other players, while tall, heavy and technical players, like [[Zlatan Ibrahimović]], have qualities which are suited to both positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/15115/10303502/zlatan-ibrahimovic-to-manchester-united-what-will-he-bring |title=Zlatan Ibrahimovic to Manchester United: What will he bring? &amp;#124; Football News |publisher=[[Sky Sports]] |date= |accessdate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the centre-forward, the traditional role of a striker is to score goals; strikers are therefore known for their ability to peel off defenders and to run into space via the blind side of the defender and to receive the ball in a good goalscoring position, as typified by [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/football/first-team/detail/article/luis-suarez-a-centre-forward-with-a-difference |title=News |publisher=FC Barcelona |date= |accessdate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are typically fast players with good ball control and dribbling abilities. More agile strikers like [[Michael Owen]] have an advantage over taller defenders due to their short bursts of speed. A good striker should be able to [[Shooting (association football)|shoot]] confidently with either foot, possess great power and accuracy, and have the ability to link-up with teammates and pass the ball under pressure in breakaway situations. While many strikers wear the number 9 shirt, the position, to a lesser degree, is also associated with the [[Squad number (association football)|number 10]], which is frequently worn by more creative deep-lying forwards such as [[Pelé]], and occasionally with numbers 7 and 11, which are often associated with wingers.&lt;ref name="sports.yahoo.com"/&gt;

==Second striker==
[[File:Wayne Rooney 144855.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Wayne Rooney]] was used by [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] as a second striker on many occasions]]
Deep-lying forwards have a long history in the game, but the terminology to describe their playing activity has varied over the years. Originally such players were termed inside forwards, creative or deep-lying centre-forwards. More recently, two more variations of this old type of player have developed: the second, or shadow, or support, or auxiliary striker and, in what is in fact a distinct position unto its own, the number 10,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afootballreport.com/post/9738165711/the-essence-of-the-number-10-a-beginners-guide|title=The Essence of the Number 10: A Beginner’s Guide|website=Afootballreport.com|accessdate=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; exemplified by [[Dennis Bergkamp]] (who would play just in behind the striker [[Thierry Henry]] at Arsenal). Other number 10s who play further back, such as [[Diego Maradona]], [[Ronaldinho]] and [[Zinedine Zidane]], are often described as an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]] or the [[playmaker]].

The second striker position is a loosely defined and most often misapplied description of a player positioned somewhere between the out-and-out striker, whether he is a "target-man" or more of a "poacher", and the Number 10 or attacking midfielder, while possibly showing some of the characteristics of both. In fact, a coined term, the "nine-and-a-half", has been an attempt to become a standard in defining the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AdTech Ad Roberto Baggio:&amp;#124; 'Allenare l'Italia? Non si sa mai' |url=http://www.calciomercato.pro/news/roberto-baggio-allenare-l-italia-non-si-sa-mai-826328 |website=Calciomercato.pro|accessdate=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conceivably, a Number 10 can alternate as a second-striker provided that he is also a prolific goalscorer; otherwise, a mobile forward with good technical ability ([[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] skills and ball control) and link-up play, who can both score and [[Passing (association football)|create opportunities]] for a less versatile centre-forward, is more suited. Second or support strikers do not tend to get as involved in the orchestration of attacks as the Number 10, nor do they bring as many other players into play, since they do not share the burden of responsibility, functioning predominantly as [[Assist (football)|assist]] providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4197254.stm |title=Positions guide: Behind the striker |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=21 June 2008 |date=1 September 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, this role is known as a "rifinitore" or "seconda punta",&lt;ref name="Platini: Baggio, Il Fu Nove E Mezzo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eatsport.net/2012/roberto-baggio-il-nove-e-mezzo/ |title=Platini: Baggio, Il Fu Nove E Mezzo |language=Italian |accessdate=16 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604152313/http://www.eatsport.net/2012/roberto-baggio-il-nove-e-mezzo/ |archivedate=4 June 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in Brazil, it is known as "segundo atacante"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guimarães|first1=Levy|title=Segundo atacante: uma posição em desuso|url=http://doentesporfutebol.com.br/2013/06/segundo-atacante-uma-posicao-em-desuso/|website=Doentes por Futebol|accessdate=13 August 2016|date=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "ponta-de-lança".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://footballsgreatest.weebly.com/second-strikers.html|title=The Greatest Second Strikers / Inside Forwards of All Time|accessdate=5 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206074856/http://footballsgreatest.weebly.com/second-strikers.html|archivedate=6 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inside forward==
[[Image:2-3-5 (pyramid).svg|100px|thumb|right|2–3–5 formation: the inside forwards (red) flank the centre-forward]]
The position of '''inside forward''' was popularly used in the late nineteenth and first half of the twentieth centuries. The inside forwards would support the centre-forward, running and making space in the opposition defence, and, as the passing game developed, supporting him or her with passes. The role is broadly analogous to the ''[[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|"hole"]]'' or ''second striker'' position in the modern game, although here there were two such players, known as '''inside right''' and '''inside left'''.

[[Image:Football Formation - WM.png|100px|thumb|left|WM Formation: the inside forwards (red) occupy a more withdrawn position supporting the centre-forward and outside right and left]]
In early [[Formation (association football)#2–3–5 (Pyramid)|2–3–5 formations]] the inside-forwards would flank the centre-forward on both sides. With the advent of the [[Formation (association football)#WM|"WM" formation]], the inside forwards were brought back to become attacking midfielders, supplying balls to the centre-forward and the two attacking [[Midfielder#Outside forward|Outside forwards]] – known as the ''outside right'' and ''outside left''.

In the modern game, inside forwards have either been pushed up front to become out-and-out attackers (in [[Formation (association football)#4–3–3|4–3–3 formations]]) or one has been switched back into midfield and the other up front (in [[Formation (association football)#4–4–2|4–4–2]]). Many teams, however, still employ one of their strikers in a withdrawn role as a support forward for the main striker, in a role broadly similar to the inside forward.

==Outside forward==
&lt;!-- linked from redirects [[Outside forward]], [[outside left]], [[outside right]] --&gt;
[[File:Metodo (ENG).png|thumb|[[Vittorio Pozzo]]’s ''Metodo'' system from the 1930s was one of the many variants of the 4–3–3 formation which featured attacking wingers]]

An '''outside forward''' plays as the advanced forward on the right or left wing – as an '''outside right''' or '''outside left''', typically as part of a [[Formation (association football)#2–3–5 (Pyramid)|2–3–5 formation]] or one of its variants. As football tactics have largely developed, and wingers have dropped back to become [[midfielder]]s, the terminology has changed and "outside forward" has become a historical term. Many commentators and football analysts still refer to the wing positions as "outside right" and "outside left".

The responsibilities of an outside forward include but are not limited to:
* Scoring: their first option should be to shoot, while their second option should be to find another way to create a goal opportunity for the team.
* Passing: when they run into a shooting angle that is unlikely to become a goal, they must find a way to pass the ball to the middle of the penalty box area allowing the centre-forwards to finish the job.

Due to these responsibilities some of the most important attributes include:
* Good dribbling and circumventing defenders
* Speed as a necessity to produce effective counter-attacks

==Winger==
{{main|Midfielder#Winger}}

[[File:Ronaldo vs. FC Schalke 04 (16854146922).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cristiano Ronaldo]] has been deployed as an inverted winger.]]
A '''winger''' is an attacking player who is stationed in a wide position near the touchlines. They can be classified as forwards, considering their origin as the old "outside-forward" position, and continue to be termed as such in most parts of the world, especially in Latin and Dutch footballing cultures. However, in the British game (in which the 4–4–2 formation and its variants are most commonly used) they are usually counted as part of the midfield.

It is a winger's duty to beat opposing [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|full-backs]], deliver cut-backs or [[Cross (football)|crosses]] from wide positions and, to a lesser extent, to beat defenders and score from close range. They are usually some of the quickest players in the team and usually have good dribbling skills as well. In their Dutch, Spanish and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] usage, the defensive duties of the winger have been usually confined to pressing the opposition fullbacks when they have the ball. Otherwise, a winger will drop closer to the midfield to make himself available, should his team win back the ball.

In British and other northern European styles of football, the wide-midfielder is expected to track back all the way to his own corner flag should his full-back require help, and also to track back his marker, as well as tucking into the midfield when the more central players are trying to pressure the opposition for the ball, a large responsibility for attack-oriented players, and particularly those like [[Joaquín Sánchez|Joaquín]] (winger/wide midfielder), [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] (winger/striker) or [[Ryan Giggs]] and [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]] (winger/central midfielder) who lack the physical attributes of a wing-back or of a more orthodox midfield player. As these players grow older and lose their natural pace, they are frequently redeployed as Number 10s between the midfield and the forward line, where their innate ball control and improved reading of the game in the final third can serve to improve their teams' attacking options in tight spaces. An example is [[Inter Milan]]'s use of veteran [[Luís Figo]] behind one or two other attackers, as a second striker or attacking midfielder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4197228.stm |title=Positions guide: Wide Midfield |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=21 June 2008 |date=1 September 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years there has been a trend of playing [[Inverted Winger|inverted wingers]] – wide men stationed on the 'wrong' side of the pitch, in order to enable them to cut inside and [[Shooting (association football)|shoot]] on their stronger foot and sometimes provide in-swinging crosses. This tactic was used by [[Frank Rijkaard]], who whilst at [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], moved [[Lionel Messi]] from the left flank onto the right wing, initially against the player's wishes, allowing him to cut into the centre and shoot or cross with his left foot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lionel Messi|work=Financial Times|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/cfa0d296-8672-11e0-9d5c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1xRQZ4Y00|accessdate=12 January 2015 |date=27 May 2011 |last=Reng |first=Ronald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==False 9== 
[[File:Leo_Messi_v_Granada_2014.jpg|thumb|[[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]'s [[Lionel Messi]] has been a proponent of the false 9 position to much success in recent years]]
The false 9, in some ways similar to a more advanced attacking midfielder/playmaker role, is an unconventional lone striker or centre-forward, who drops deep into midfield. The purpose of this is that it creates a problem for opposing [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|centre-backs]] who can either follow the false 9, leaving space behind them for onrushing midfielders, forwards or wingers to exploit, or leaving the false 9 to have time and space to dribble or pick out a pass.

The term comes from the traditional number for center-forwards (nine), and the fact that normally a centre-forward traditionally stayed near the line of [[Defender (association football)|defenders]] until they got an opportunity to move past them toward goal.&lt;ref name="thefalse9.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Football Tactics for Beginners: The False 9|url=http://www.thefalse9.com/2013/09/football-tactics-for-beginnersthe-false.html|website=The False 9 - Football Tactics Simplified|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key attributes for a false 9 are similar to those of a deep-lying striker; dribbling ability to take advantage of space between the lines, good short passing ability to link up with the midfield and vision to play through teammates making runs from deep to goal.

The first false 9 in a World Cup was [[Juan Peregrino Anselmo]] in the [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay national team]], although he could not play the match against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in the [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930 World Cup]] due to injury. [[Matthias Sindelar]] was the false 9 of the ''Wunderteam'', the [[Austria national football team|Austria national team]], in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1641699-building-the-ideal-false-nine-for-the-modern-era |title=Building the Ideal False Nine for the Modern Era |publisher=Bleacher Report |date=16 May 2013 |accessdate=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A false 9 was also utilized by [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] during the beginning of the 1950s, with striker [[Nándor Hidegkuti]] acting in the role.

[[A.S. Roma|Roma]] under manager [[Luciano Spalletti]] used [[Francesco Totti]], nominally an attacking midfielder or ''trequartista'', up-front in an innovative "4–6–0" formation;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1435904-great-team-tactics-francesco-totti-roma-and-the-first-false-nine |title=Great Team Tactics: Francesco Totti, Roma and the First False Nine |publisher=Bleacher Report |date=6 December 2012 |accessdate=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was met with a run of 11 consecutive victories.

At [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]], [[Spain national football team|Spain]] manager [[Vicente del Bosque]], although sometimes using a typical striker in [[Fernando Torres]], used a false 9 in [[Cesc Fàbregas]] in several matches, including [[UEFA Euro 2012 Final|the final]]. By the end of 2012, the False 9 had gone "mainstream" with many clubs employing a version of the system. [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]'s [[Lionel Messi]] has been an exponent of the false 9 position to much success in recent years, first under coach [[Pep Guardiola]] and later under his successor [[Tito Vilanova]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bettingexpert.com/blog/5-tactical-trends-of-2012 |title=5 Tactical Trends of 2012 |publisher=Bettingexpert.com |date= |accessdate=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One approach to stop false 9s has been to create congestion in the midfield by bringing several players back into a more defensive role in an attempt to deny them space needed to create plays, notably in [[José Mourinho]]'s "parking the bus" strategy.&lt;ref name="thefalse9.com"/&gt;

==Strike teams and combinations==

[[File:Olympic women's soccer final 2012.jpg|thumb|right| [[Alex Morgan]] (13) and [[Abby Wambach]] (14); Morgan and Wambach combined for 55 goals in 2012 – matching a 21-year-old record set in 1991 by [[Michelle Akers]] (39 goals) and [[Carin Jennings]] (16 goals) as the most goals scored by any duo in U.S. WNT history.]]

A strike team is two or more strikers who work together. The history of football has been filled with many effective combinations. Three-man teams often operate in "triangles", giving a wealth of attacking options. Four-man packages expand options even more.

Strikers must also be flexible, and be able to switch roles at a moment's notice, between the first (''advanced penetrator position''), second (''deep-lying manoeuvre'') and third (''support and expansion, e.g. wings'') attacker roles.

Another example was the [[Total Football]] played by the Dutch team in the 1970s, where the ability of their players, and in particular [[Johan Cruyff]], to swap positions allowed a flexible attacking approach which opposition teams found difficult to effectively mark.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/fifa-tournaments/players-coaches/people=1043/profile.html “FIFA Classic Player: Cruyff. The Netherlands' Grand Master”]. FIFA.com. Retrieved 13 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fred G. Hughes Stadium at the Robert W. Plaster Complex''' is located at 3950 Newman Road is a 7,000 seat football stadium for [[Missouri Southern State University]] in [[Joplin, Missouri]]

The stadium opened in 1975 and cost $1.7 million.  It claims to be the first state college stadium in Missouri to use artificial turf. In 2003 its turf was replaced with [[Sprinturf]].  The previous turf in place in 1988 has been [[BaspoGrass]]-S.&lt;ref name="mssulions.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mssulions.com/facilities/Hughes|title=Fred G. Hughes Stadium|work=mssulions.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its capacity is 4,700 fans on the west side and  2,300 spectators on the east.&lt;ref name="mssulions.com"/&gt;

The stadium was named in honor of [[Fred G Hughes]], president of the College Board of Regents between 1964 and 1978. It was designed by Joplin architect firm Allgeier, Martin, and Associates.&lt;ref name="mssulions.com"/&gt;

In February 2011, the [[Robert W. Plaster]] Foundation announced two seven figure gifts to the school to build baseball field and a multi-purpose athletic facility adjacent to the football field and to renovate Fred G. Hughes Stadium.  The whole complex is to be named Robert W. Plaster Sports Complex (there is another complex of the same name at [[Missouri State University]]).  After additional funding is raised for the Hughes renovations, that field is to be renamed Robert W. Plaster Stadium.  School officials are debating renaming the entrance to the Hughes Entrance Plaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neoshodailynews.com/features/x43527520/MSSU-to-rename-football-stadium|title=MSSU to rename football stadium|work=Neosho Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field was used as the first temporary morgue on May 22, 2011 after the [[2011 Joplin tornado]] destroyed much of the community.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kmov.com/news/local/Football-field-temporarily-transformed-into-morgue-122480774.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Giro Toscana Int. Femminile – Memorial [[Michela Fanini]]''' is annual elite [[List of women's road bicycle races|women's road bicycle racing]] [[race stage|stage race]] held in Italy since 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memoire-du-cyclisme.net/feminines/toscane_fanini.php |title=Giro della Toscana Femminile/Memorial Michela Fanini |language=fr |accessdate=5 September 2012 |publisher=memoire-du-cyclisme.net |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111163931/http://www.memoire-du-cyclisme.net/feminines/toscane_fanini.php |archivedate=11 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2013 race, 63 of the 112 riders refused to compete in the fourth and final stage of the race due to safety concerns, including having to race in open car traffic without sufficient police protection. After briefly listening to the riders' complaints at a meeting before the fourth stage, the organizer, Brunello Fanani, told the protesting riders and team representatives to "go home." Among the protesting riders were Italy's two top women's riders, [[Elisa Longo Borghini]] and [[Giorgia Bronzini]], and [[Marianne Vos]], the overall leader after the third stage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/women-riders-protest-security-at-giro-della-toscana Women riders protest security at Giro della Toscana]&lt;/ref&gt; The race returned in 2014 but was reduced to two stages plus a prologue time trial, and its [[UCI race classification]] was downgraded from 2.1 to 2.2.

'''Halotherapy''', derived from the Greek ''alas'', meaning "salt", is a form of [[alternative medicine]] which makes use of salt. Numerous forms of halotherapy have been known of and used for millennia. The first mention of spa resorts were in Poland in records dating from the twelfth century. They relate to bathing in mineral waters.&lt;ref name=Halotherapy&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamińska|first=Katarzyna|title=Halotherapy|year=2014|publisher=Salsano Haloterapia Polska|location=Sulejówek|isbn=978-83-937819-1-1|page=Transl. Caryl Swift}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spa owners sometimes attribute detoxifying properties and a wide range of health benefits to halotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/halotherapy-the-latest-spa-pseudoscience/|title=Halotherapy – The Latest Spa Pseudoscience|last=Novella|first=Steven|date=June 13, 2018|website=Science-based Medicine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617185019/https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/halotherapy-the-latest-spa-pseudoscience/|archive-date=June 17, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=June 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, medical health experts have concluded that halotherapy is an unproven treatment that lacks scientific credibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Shah, R., |author2=Greenberger, P. |year=2012 |title=Unproved and controversial methods and theories in allergy-immunology |journal=Allergy and Asthma Proceedings |volume=33 |issue=Supplement 1 |pages=100–102 |doi=10.2500/aap.2012.33.3562 |pmid=22794702}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methodological limitations call into question studies that showed improvement in symptoms of [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] following halotherapy.&lt;ref name="RashleighEtAl"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rashleigh|first=Rachel|last2=Smith|first2=Sheree|journal=International Journal of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease|title=A review of halotherapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|date=February 21, 2014|doi=10.2147/COPD.S57511}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salt's well known drying effect may also help to clean up bronchial secretions. Beyond short-term relief associated with dry environment for those trying to excrete [[sputum]], Norman Edelman of the American Lung Association suspects reported improvement in the health condition of patients might simply be due to the [[Placebo|placebo effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lung.org/about-us/blog/2016/06/promising-placebo-salt-halotherapy.html|title=Promising or Placebo?

Inhalation of hypertonic saline can stimulate [[bronchoconstriction]], which may be used in the diagnosis or evaluation of [[asthma]] symptoms.&lt;ref name="BorgesEtAl"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Borges|first=MC|last2=Ferraz|first2=E|journal=Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research|title=Protective effect of bronchial challenge with hypertonic saline on nocturnal asthma|doi=10.1590/S0100-879X2008000300006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Forms ==
There are several forms of halotherapy:&lt;ref name=Halotherapy/&gt;
* Saline solution inhalations
* Dry salt aerosol inhalations
* Irrigation and lavage
* Saline and brine baths
* Taking the waters (crenotherapy)

'''''How to Play Baseball''''' is a [[cartoon]] produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]] and released by [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]] in September 1942, produced at the request of [[Samuel Goldwyn]] and first shown to accompany the 1942 [[feature film]] ''[[The Pride of the Yankees]]''.&lt;ref name="bosley"&gt;{{cite news|title=''Pride of the Yankees'', a Film Biography of Lou Gehrig ... on View at Astor |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0DEFD71E31E53BBC4E52DFB1668389659EDE |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 16, 1942 |accessdate=2009-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426231743/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0DEFD71E31E53BBC4E52DFB1668389659EDE |archivedate=April 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
{{Expand section|date=March 2010}}
[[Goofy]] takes the time to demonstrate America's national pastime, then plays a game - one in which he plays all the bases. The short describes the basics of [[baseball]] in humorous terms; the equipment, uniforms, positions, and pitches, as well as the mannerisms of the players. It then switches to a game in progress, a deciding game in the World Series between the fictional Blue Sox and Gray Sox (possibly a parody of the real-life Chicago White Sox and Boston Red Sox). The Blue Sox are up three runs and working a no-hitter when the Grays rally in the bottom of the ninth. In a series of events the Grays load the bases, leading to a base clearing hit.

The game is tied, but the play at the plate is too close to call for the umpire, and it then ends in an argument, They Unmasked The Umpire and the other players attack the three. The narrator then concludes the short praising the values of what makes baseball America's sport.

==Production==
This is the first of Disney's “How to...” shorts starring [[Goofy]]. The short was made on a rushed schedule of 12 weeks so it could be released in time to accompany Samuel Goldwyn's ''[[The Pride of the Yankees]].'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/907408501|title=Disney A to Z : the official encyclopedia|last=1940-|first=Smith, Dave,|date=2015|publisher=Disney Editions|isbn=9781484721339|edition= 4th |location=Los Angeles|oclc=907408501}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was followed by nine “How to...” shorts in [[Walt Disney]]'s lifetime: ''How to Swim'' and ''[[How to Fish]]''; (both also in 1942); ''How to Be a Sailor'', ''How to Play Football'', and ''[[How to Play Golf]]'' (1944); ''How to Ride a Horse'' (1950, originally included in ''[[The Reluctant Dragon (1941 film)|The Reluctant Dragon]]'' in 1941); ''How to Be a Detective'' (1952); and ''How to Sleep'' and ''How to Dance'' (both 1953).

After Disney's death, the studio produced ''How to Haunt a House'' (1999) and ''[[How to Hook Up Your Home Theater]]'' (2007). Similarly-styled Goofy shorts that do not include the “How to” titling convention are ''[[The Olympic Champ]]'' (1942), ''[[Hockey Homicide]]'' (1945), ''[[Goofy Gymnastics]]'' (1949) and ''[[Motor Mania]]'' (1950). Prior to ''How to Play Baseball'', Disney had released two other "instructional" shorts starring Goofy: ''[[The Art of Skiing]]'' and ''[[The Art of Self Defense]]'' in November and December 1941, respectively.

==Reception==

The [[FIFA Women's World Cup]] is an international [[association football]] competition established in [[1991 FIFA Women's World Cup|1991]]. It is contested by the [[List of women's national association football teams|women's national teams]] of the members of [[FIFA|Fédération Internationale de Football Association]] (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The tournament has taken place every four years. The [[2015 FIFA World Cup|most recent World Cup]], hosted by Canada in 2015, was won by the [[United States women's national soccer team|USA]], who beat [[Japan women's national football team|Japan]] 5–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USA Women 5-2 Japan. Women|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33085994|accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just like the [[FIFA World Cup|men's tournament]] the World Cup final match is the last of the competition, and the result determines which country is declared world champions. If after 90 minutes of regular play the score is a [[Tie (draw)|draw]], an additional 30-minute period of play, called [[extra time]], is added. If such a game is still tied after extra time it is decided by kicks from the [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]]. The winning penalty shoot-out area team are then declared champions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/federation/81/42/36/lotg_en.pdf |title=Laws of the Game |format=PDF |accessdate=9 February 2009 |publisher=FIFA.com (Fédération Internationale de Football Association)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tournament has been decided by a one-off match on every occasion.

This list of '''Jewish athletes in sports''' contains athletes who are Jewish and have attained outstanding achievements in sports. The criteria for inclusion in this list are:
* 1–3 places winners at major international tournaments;
* for [[team sport]]s, winning in preliminary competitions of finals at major international tournaments, or playing for several seasons for clubs of major national leagues; or
* holders of past and current [[world record]]s.

'''Boldface''' denotes a current competitor.

The topic of [[Jewish]] participation in sports is discussed extensively in academic and popular literature. Scholars believe that sports have been a historical avenue for Jewish people to overcome obstacles toward their participation in secular society (especially before the mid-20th century in Europe and the United States).&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'': ''Encyclopedia of Jewish people in Sports'' by Bernard Postal, Jesse Silver, Roy Silver (1965); ''Great Jews in Sports'' by [[Robert Slater]] (2003), {{ISBN|0-8246-0453-9}}; ''Emancipation Through Muscles: Jews and Sports in Europe'' by Michael Brenner, Gideon Reuveni (2006), {{ISBN|0-8032-1355-7}}; ''Jewish, Sports, and the Rites of Citizenship'' ed. Jack Kugelmass (2007), {{ISBN|0-252-07324-X}}; ''Ellis Island to Ebbets Field: Sport and the American Jewish Experience'' by Peter Levine (1993) {{ISBN|0-19-508555-8}}; ''Judaism's Encounter with American Sports'' by Jeffrey S. Gurock (2005) {{ISBN|0-253-34700-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nebraska–Texas football rivalry''' was an American [[college football]] [[college rivalry|rivalry]] between the Nebraska Cornhuskers and Texas Longhorns. The rivalry dissolved when Nebraska left the [[Big 12 Conference]] for the [[Big Ten Conference]]. Due to Colorado, Missouri, Nebraska, and Texas A&amp;M leaving the conference, the [[Big 12 Championship Game]] dissolved due to a lack of teams in the conference. The last ever Big 12 Championship game was played between Nebraska and Oklahoma in 2010. 
The rivalry is known for the tension between the two programs. Almost every game between the two could have gone either way, with Texas stealing many of the victories in heartbreaking fashion. In the 1996 Big 12 Championship game, Nebraska had a four-point lead over Texas until Wane McGarity scored a touchdown for Texas, followed by a late touchdown by Priest Holmes to allow Texas to win, 37–27.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/503093-recap-of-the-nebraska-texas-rivalry|title=Nebraska-Texas, Recap of the Rivalry|work=BleacherReport.com|access-date=January 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2009 Big 12 Championship Game]] between Texas and Nebraska ended controversially as the officiating crew added one second to the clock, allowing Texas to score the winning field goal over Nebraska.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/sports/ncaafootball/06big12.html?_r=0|title=Texas wins Big 12 in a Wild Finish|work=NYTimes.com|access-date=January 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most Nebraska fans disagreed with the call, former Nebraska coach [[Tom Osborne]] stated that Texas "won the game fair and square", and that he was at the game in the press box and felt confused when it first had happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsday.dallasnews.com/college-sports/texaslonghorns/2010/10/13/20101012-Nebraska-s-Tom-Osborne-On-9804|title=Nebraska's Tom Osborne: On Texas rivalry and leaving the Big 12|work=DallasNews.com|access-date=January 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13762">[[File:Kenny Dalglish 2011.jpg|thumb|right|150px|After the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]] in 1985 and [[Joe Fagan]]'s subsequent resignation as manager, [[Kenny Dalglish]] served as the player-manager of [[Liverpool Football Club|Liverpool]] from 1985 to 1990.]]

A '''player-coach''' (also '''playing coach''', '''captain-coach''', or '''player-manager''') is a member of a sports team who simultaneously holds both playing and [[coach (sport)|coaching]] duties. A player-coach may be a head coach or an assistant coach. They may make changes to the squad and also play on the team.

Very few current major professional sports teams have head coaches who are also players, though it is extremely common for senior players to take a role in managing more junior athletes. Historically, when professional sports had much less money to pay players and coaches or managers, it was much more common to find them. Likewise, where player-coaches exist today, they are more common at the lower levels where money is less available, but not exclusively.

== Player-coaches in basketball ==
{{further|List of National Basketball Association player-coaches}}
[[File:Bill Russell in the Green Room.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Bill Russell]] served as the player-coach of the [[Boston Celtics]] from 1966 to 1969.]]

The player-coach was, for many decades, a long-time fixture in professional [[basketball]]. Many notable coaches in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] served as player-coaches, including [[Bill Russell (basketball)|Bill Russell]] and [[Lenny Wilkens]]. This was especially true up through the 1970s, when the league was not as financially successful as it is today, and player-coaches were often used to save money. The practice fell out of favor in the 1980s (though [[Mike Dunleavy, Sr.|Mike Dunleavy Sr.]], while an assistant coach with the [[Milwaukee Bucks]], once came out of retirement and played several games when a rash of injuries decimated the team). Today, the [[collective bargaining agreement]] between the NBA and the players' union prohibits the use of player-coaches, in order to avoid circumventing the league's [[salary cap]], as coaches' salaries are not counted under the cap. Therefore, if a player is to serve as a coach, he would have to receive commission from his contract as a player. The player, then, is not technically an official coach of his team but instead simply a coach in name. One example of a player in recent years who was groomed for eventual official coaching duties using this practice was [[Avery Johnson]].

== Player-coaches in American football ==
In the early days of professional American football, player-coaches were a necessity, as coaching from the sidelines at the time was not allowed under the rules of most leagues. The [[National Football League]] eventually allowed sideline coaches in the late 1920s, and they quickly became the norm. During the 1920s, legendary player-coaches in the NFL include [[Curly Lambeau]] (who played for the [[Green Bay Packers]] from 1919–1929, and served as their head coach from 1919–1949) and [[George Halas]] who held similar roles for the [[Chicago Bears]], a team for which he was also part-owner and business manager. [[Jimmy Conzelman]] was player-coach for four teams during the 1920s. In the mid-1950s [[Tom Landry]] played defensive back while serving as [[defensive coordinator]] for the [[New York Giants]]. In the early 1970s, when Landry was coach of the [[Dallas Cowboys]], he made running back [[Dan Reeves]] a player-coach. More modern players have acted as player-coaches in an unofficial capacity, such as journeyman quarterback [[Steve DeBerg]], who served as an unofficial mentor for younger, more skilled arms while also serving as their backup.

==Player-coaches in cricket==
Player-coaches in [[cricket]] are almost unheard of, although professional coaches are a relatively recent innovation and a similar role was generally filled by the [[Captain (cricket)|team captain]]; this may still be the case in amateur competition. Internationally, [[Shane Deitz]] was appointed non-playing coach of [[Vanuatu cricket team|Vanuatu]] in 2014 and, after meeting the necessary residency qualifications, made his international playing debut in 2018, at the age of 42.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/1144689.html |title=At 42, Deitz set for hip return to cricket after 10-year hiatus |work=ESPN Cricinfo |accessdate=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, former Australian international [[Ryan Campbell]] was appointed as a non-playing [[batting coach]] of [[Hong Kong cricket team|Hong Kong]] in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/hkg/content/story/637439.html "HKCA appoints Ryan Campbell as Specialist Batting Coach"] – ESPNcricinfo. Retrieved 28 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and after meeting the residency qualifications made his playing debut for Hong Kong in 2016, at the age of 44.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/hkg/content/story/966333.html "Hong Kong pick ex-Australia keeper Campbell for WT20"] – ESPNcricinfo. Retrieved 28 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Player-managers in association football ==
{{globalize|date=January 2016}} &lt;!-- examples are all from British football.  Are there none from elsewhere? --&gt;
In [[association football]], this situation usually arises when a [[Manager (football)|manager]] leaves a team suddenly, and the [[chairman]] has to make a quick decision to appoint someone new as a [[caretaker manager]]. The chairman will usually either ask a [[Coach (sport)|coach]] to take temporary charge or turn to one of the club's most senior players. If this particular player gains good results for the team during his time in charge, he may be appointed full-time manager, which leaves him a player–manager. However, there are instances when a [[free agent]] is appointed by a new team as a manager and offers his playing abilities.

Successful football player–managers include [[Kenny Dalglish]] ([[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]), [[Graeme Souness]] ([[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]), [[Glenn Hoddle]] ([[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]), [[Bryan Robson]] ([[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]), [[Peter Reid]] ([[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]), [[Ruud Gullit]] (Chelsea) and [[Gianluca Vialli]] (Chelsea). Dalglish won [[double (association football)|the double]] of the league title and [[FA Cup]] in his first season as player-manager, and went on to win two more league titles and an FA Cup before giving up playing completely five years after becoming manager, while Souness won three Scottish league titles and several cup competitions when he was player-manager of Rangers. He then succeeded Dalglish as Liverpool manager just before Rangers won another Scottish league title, but at the age of 38 he did not register himself as a player for Liverpool. In 1997, Ruud Gullit won the FA Cup with Chelsea in his first season as player-manager, also making history by being the first foreign and non-white manager to win a major trophy in English football. He was sacked nine months later, and Chelsea appointed another player-manager (Gianluca Vialli) in his place. Within weeks of taking over, Vialli guided Chelsea to victory in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]], and two months after that, they won the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]].

A number of bigger clubs have appointed player-managers on a temporary basis but not given them permanent contracts. Notable cases include [[Ossie Ardiles]] ([[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]) in 1987 and [[Dave Watson]] ([[Everton F.C.|Everton]]) a decade later, although Ardiles later returned to Tottenham as manager in 1993 after managing three other clubs. During the first decade of the 21st century, however, the concept gradually fell into almost total disuse and was normally only practiced by smaller clubs.&lt;ref name="player manager"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21928791 |title=Where have football's player-managers gone? |first=Simon |last=Austin |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=28 March 2013 |accessdate=29 March 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328150158/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21928791 |archivedate=28 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2013, a ''[[BBC Sport]]'' article suggested that the concept of having a player-manager had gone out of fashion, with only two clubs in the English professional leagues using player-managers at that time.&lt;ref name = "player manager"/&gt;

The chief executive of the [[League Managers Association]] stated his belief that the increased workload for managers had made combining the two roles difficult. The last permanent player-manager in the top flight of English football was [[Gianluca Vialli]], who retired from playing in 1999 when he was the manager of Chelsea.&lt;ref name = "player manager"/&gt; The governing bodies have also imposed requirements for managers to hold professional coaching qualifications, which few players obtain before retiring.&lt;ref name = "player manager"/&gt;

There have been four player-managers in the [[Premier League]] since 2000: [[Stuart McCall]], who managed two [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] games on an interim basis in late 2000, [[Garry Monk]], who was appointed interim player-manager of Swansea City in February 2014, after their manager, [[Michael Laudrup]], was sacked, and [[Leon Britton]] who also became player-manager of Swansea City after the sacking of [[Paul Clement]].&lt;ref name = "player manager"/&gt; [[Ryan Giggs]] was appointed player-coach at [[Manchester United]] by [[David Moyes]] on 4 July 2013 and Giggs served as interim player-manager until the appointment of [[Louis van Gaal]] on 9 May 2014 as [[manager (association football)|manager]] following Moyes' dismissal. On the 6 May 2014, in what turned out to be his final game as a player, [[Ryan Giggs]] substituted himself on against Hull in the closing minutes at the age of 40.

== Player-managers in baseball ==
{{further|List of Major League Baseball player-managers}}

While no [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) team has been led by a player-manager since 1986, they were once quite common. [[Cap Anson]], [[Connie Mack]], [[John McGraw (baseball)|John McGraw]], [[Ty Cobb]], [[Tris Speaker]], [[Joe Cronin]], [[Mickey Cochrane]], [[Lou Boudreau]], [[Joe Torre]], and [[Frank Robinson]] are among those who spent time as player-managers. In this capacity, Robinson became the [[baseball color line|first African-American]] manager in MLB history when he was named the [[Cleveland Indians]]' player-manager in {{baseball year|1975}}. [[Fred Clarke]] spent the longest time as a major league player-manager, serving as such for the [[Louisville Colonels]] from {{baseball year|1897}} to {{baseball year|1899}} and the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] from {{baseball year|1900}} to {{baseball year|1915}}.

The most recent player-manager in MLB was [[Pete Rose]], who, upon being traded from the [[Montreal Expos]] to the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in August {{baseball year|1984}}, was immediately named the Reds' manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1122453/index.htm|title=Pete Rose's return as manager-player wowed the media, – 08.27.84 – SI Vault|author=|date=|website=cnn.com|accessdate=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rose managed and served as a backup infielder until the end of the {{baseball year|1986}} season, when he retired as a player. (He continued to manage the Reds until {{baseball year|1989}} when he was suspended indefinitely by MLB for gambling on baseball.)

In {{baseball year|2011}}, [[Chicago White Sox]] general manager [[Kenny Williams (baseball)|Kenny Williams]] said that he had considered making veteran [[first baseman]] [[Paul Konerko]] a player-manager to replace departing manager [[Ozzie Guillén]]. Williams instead hired retired player [[Robin Ventura]] for the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/chicago/mlb/story/_/id/7088503/chicago-white-sox-unveil-robin-ventura-considered-paul-konerko-manager|title=White Sox unveil Ventura, considered Konerko|author=|date=|website=go.com|accessdate=29 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419094938/http://espn.go.com/chicago/mlb/story/_/id/7088503/chicago-white-sox-unveil-robin-ventura-considered-paul-konerko-manager|archivedate=19 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their final game of the {{baseball year|2016}} season, the [[Miami Marlins]] allowed [[Martin Prado]] to serve as player-manager. Prado started the game at third base and played for three innings before taking himself out of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://miami.cbslocal.com/2016/10/03/martin-prado-serves-as-marlins-player-manager-in-season-finale/|title=Martin Prado Serves As Marlins' Player-Manager In Season Finale|author=|date=3 October 2016|website=cbslocal.com|accessdate=29 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004152332/http://miami.cbslocal.com/2016/10/03/martin-prado-serves-as-marlins-player-manager-in-season-finale/|archivedate=4 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major league rules are somewhat different for trips to the mound by the manager if he is a player-manager (this is with regard to being required to change pitchers), and a player-manager puts himself into or out of the lineup just as he would any other player.

[[Image:Towelpower.jpg|thumb|Towel Power in Vancouver during the Canucks' 2007 NHL Playoffs]]
'''Towel Power''' is a term used by the [[Vancouver Canucks]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) to describe the waving of [[rally towel]]s by their fans. The tradition started in the [[1982 Stanley Cup Playoffs|1982 Campbell Conference Finals]] when Vancouver played the [[Chicago Blackhawks]]&lt;!--The name change to Blackhawks did not occur until after the 1985-86 season--&gt;. During game two of the series, head coach [[Roger Neilson]] waved a white towel on the end of a hockey stick in a mock [[Surrender (military)|surrender]] after being upset with the officiating. Neilson was ejected and the Canucks lost 4–1. When Vancouver returned home from Chicago for the following game fans supported both Neilson and the Canucks by waving towels first at the airport when the team arrived and then during the next game. The Canucks won the next three games and advanced to the [[1982 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Finals]] where they were defeated by the [[New York Islanders]]. As part of the tradition, the Canucks hand out towels prior to playoff games for fans to help support the team.

==History==

=== Background ===
[[Image:2007 Memorial Cup towels.jpg|thumb|200px|Towels laid out on each seat at the [[Pacific Coliseum]] prior to the [[2007 Memorial Cup]] final in Vancouver.]]
Late in the [[1981–82 NHL season|1981–82 season]] the [[Vancouver Canucks]] played a game against the [[Quebec Nordiques]] in [[Quebec City]]. During the game Canucks' [[Enforcer (ice hockey)|enforcer]], [[Tiger Williams]] was punched by a fan. In response Canucks' head coach [[Harry Neale]] went into the crowd to "get the fan" and a few players followed suit. For his actions [[NHL President]] [[John Ziegler (ice hockey)|John Ziegler]] suspended Neale for eight games. Neale's suspension began with four games remaining in the season and assistant coach [[Roger Neilson]] took over the head coaching duties for Neale.&lt;ref name=roots&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=527679|title=Vancouver's towel-power tradition has Quebec roots|date=2010-04-30|publisher=National Hockey League|last=Weiner|first=Evan|accessdate=2011-07-18|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60gjwohXH|archivedate=2011-08-03|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vancouver finished the year with a 30–33–17 record, second in the [[Smythe Division]] and qualified them for the playoffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/standings.htm?season=19811982&amp;sort=stk&amp;type=DIV|title=1981-1982 Regular Season|publisher=National Hockey League|accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neale's suspension then carried over for the first four games.&lt;ref name=roots/&gt; Despite the losing record the Canucks finished the year with an eight-game unbeaten streak, which continued into their first round match-up with the [[Calgary Flames]]. Vancouver swept the Flames in three straight games advancing to the second round where they faced the [[Los Angeles Kings]].&lt;ref name=results&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/VAN/1982_games.html|title=1981-82 Vancouver Canucks Schedule and Results|publisher=Hockey Reference|accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Canucks' [[General Manager]] [[Jake Milford]] retiring and Neale set to replace him, Neale told Milford to keep Neilson as head coach for the remainder of the playoffs, believing the team had bonded under his guidance.&lt;ref name=roots/&gt; With Neilson remaining as head coach, the Canucks eliminated the Kings in five games and advanced to the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Campbell Conference]] Finals against the [[Chicago Blackhawks]].&lt;ref name=results/&gt;

===Incident===
Vancouver won the first game of the series in Chicago 2–1 in double overtime, but fell behind in game two 3–1.&lt;ref name=province&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theprovince.com/sports/Towel+Power+born/4902804/story.html|title=How Towel Power was born |date=2011-06-06 |publisher=''[[The Province]]''|last=Colebourn|first=John |accessdate=2011-07-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60gk492iA|archivedate=2011-08-03|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the game the Canucks felt that referee Bob Myers was making questionable calls against them.&lt;ref name=joy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canucks.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=558295|title=Towel power|date=2011-06-04|publisher=[[Vancouver Canucks]]|last=Joy|first=Derek |accessdate=2011-07-20|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60gk9aVln|archivedate=2011-08-03 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of events in the third period ignited tempers. First, Vancouver had a goal disallowed. Soon after, there was a perceived non-call against Chicago, followed by a fourth consecutive penalty called against the Canucks.&lt;ref name=roots/&gt;&lt;ref name=province/&gt; [[Denis Savard]] scored on the [[Power play (sporting term)|power play]] to put the Black Hawks up 4–1.&lt;ref name=caf91&gt;{{harvnb|Raible|2010|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; This enraged the Canucks' bench.&lt;ref name=province/&gt; Assistant coach [[Ron Smith (ice hockey, born 1944)|Ron Smith]] yelled out "We give up, we surrender, we give up."&lt;ref name=caf91/&gt; Williams suggested to Neilson that he throw sticks onto the ice in protest. Neilson noted that he had done that before, and he had a better idea. He proceeded to take a white towel and place it on the end of a hockey stick holding it up in a mock [[Surrender (military)|surrender]]; some of the Canucks' players followed suit.&lt;ref name=joy/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McIndoe|first1=Sean|title=NHL Grab Bag: Everyone in Toronto Seems Extremely Chill About Clarkson’s First Goal|url=http://grantland.com/the-triangle/nhl-grab-bag-everyone-in-toronto-seems-extremely-chill-about-clarksons-first-goal/|accessdate=March 28, 2017|publisher=Grantland.com|date=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;Neilson was ejected from the game along with two players.&lt;ref name=caf91/&gt; Vancouver [[goaltender]], [[Richard Brodeur]] later noted that although they lost the game the atmosphere in the dressing room was so positive it was as if they had won.&lt;ref name=joy/&gt;

=== Aftermath ===
[[File:Roger neilson statue.jpg|thumb|180px|Neilson's statue depicting the beginning of Towel Power]]
Neilson was fined $1,000 and the franchise was fined $10,000 as a result of the incident. Myers later called Nielson's action "bush league". While NHL executive vice-president [[Brian O'Neill (ice hockey b. 1929)|Brian O'Neill]] stated that the mock surrender "disgraced the championship series,"&lt;ref name=province/&gt; Canucks' captain, [[Stan Smyl]], noted that several players were "surprised" by Nielson's action because the coach had always been "respectful", and it was an "extreme way for him to react".

When the Canucks returned home, they were greeted by fans at the airport waving towels in support of the team.&lt;ref name=caf92&gt;{{harvnb|Raible|2010|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; During game three, fans waved towels to show support for the Canucks.&lt;ref name=province/&gt; Former professional football player, wrestler, and five time world belly flop champion Butts Giraud got permission from the team to start selling towels with the phrase "Canucks Take no Survivors".  He initially had 5,000 of them made at $1 apiece and sold 1,000 of them right away, proceeds going to charity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northshoreoutlook.com/sports/147942645.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Giraud would sell 30,000 towels personally, the proceeds for charity amounted to $23,000.&lt;ref name=joy/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://canucks.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=39589&lt;/ref&gt; Vancouver won game three 4–3 to take the lead in the series.&lt;ref name=results/&gt; For game four there were more fans waving towels as the Canucks won again 5–3.&lt;ref name=roots/&gt;&lt;ref name=results/&gt; Vancouver won game five in Chicago and advanced to the [[1982 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Finals]], where they were swept by the [[New York Islanders]].&lt;ref name=roots/&gt;

To continue the tradition, the organization produces 20,500 white towels with the Canucks logo for each playoff game.&lt;ref name=province/&gt;  Following his first playoff game in [[2007 Stanley Cup playoffs|2007]] Vancouver forward [[Alexandre Burrows|Alex Burrows]] stated "It looks like the fans are really into the game and the atmosphere out there is something else, people are really passionate instead of just sitting and no one moving or anything like some places. It just creates movement and it seems like there is more enthusiasm and intensity in the building."&lt;ref name=joy/&gt; As part of their 40th season celebration the Canucks organization commissioned a permanent statue of Nielson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thepeterboroughexaminer.com/2011/04/09/statue-honours-roger-neilson|title=Statue honours Roger Neilson |publisher=[[Peterborough Examiner]]|last=Clifford|first=Dale|date=2011-04-09|accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standing over 11 feet tall and weighing over 800 pounds the bronze statue depicts Nielson's mock surrender which started towel power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://canucks.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=558287|title=Canucks to unveil permanent outdoor tribute to Roger Neilson|publisher=Vancouver Canucks|date=2011-04-04|accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first use of [[rally towel]]s in professional sports was the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] football team's [[Terrible Towel]], in 1975. [[Minnesota Twins]] first used [[Homer Hanky]] towels in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.minnpost.com/politics-policy/2010/09/homer-hanky-history-making-successful-promotion-campaign|title=Homer Hanky history: The making of a successful promotion campaign|publisher=[[MinnPost.com|MinnPost]]|last=McGuire|first=Tim|date=2010-09-24|accessdate=2012-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Rob|last= Amen|authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Terrible Towel copycats|url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/sports/steelers/s_534763.html?source=rss&amp;feed=9 |publisher= [[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]|date= 2007-10-26|accessdate=2008-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, other NHL hockey teams have used rally towels at home games, including the  [[Anaheim Ducks]] Fowl Towels.&lt;ref name=joy/&gt;

The '''Trophée International''' was an elite women's professional one-day [[road bicycle race]] held between 1996 and 2001 in [[France]]. It usually takes place the day before the women's Tour de France. In 1998, 1999 and 2001 it was part of the [[UCI Women's Road Cycling World Cup]]. The event was held in different locations each year: in 1996, in [[Pornic]] ([[Loire-Atlantique]]) ; in 1997, between [[Lac de Madine]] and [[Metz]] ([[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]]); in 1998, between [[Le Chapelle St Ursin]] and [[Saint-Amand-Montrond]]; in 1999, between [[Beauvois-en-Cambrésis]] ([[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]]) and [[Hirson]] ([[Picardy (region)|Picardy]]); in 2000, between [[Villeneuve-Loubet]] and [[Valberg, Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur|Valberg]] ([[Alpes-Maritimes]]) and; in 2001, between [[La Brède]] and [[Pauillac]] ([[Gironde]]). The race was co-organised by Team France Organisation and Racing Club Olympique, who were also responsible for organising the [[Tour de France Féminin]].

[[Image:Usine Bret MG 1643.jpg|thumb|right|A large-scale [[flocculation]] water filter]]
A '''water filter''' removes impurities by lowering contamination of [[water]] using a fine physical barrier, a chemical process, or a biological process. Filters cleanse water to different extents for purposes such as providing agricultural [[irrigation]], accessible [[drinking water]], public and private [[aquarium|aquariums]], and the safe use of ponds and [[swimming pool]]s.

==Methods of filtration==
{{Main|Filtration}}
Filters use [[sieve|sieving]], [[adsorption]], [[ion exchange]]s and other processes to remove unwanted substances from water. Unlike a [[sieve]] or [[Screen filter|screen]], a filter can potentially remove particles much smaller than the holes through which its water passes.

==Types==
===Water treatment plant filters===
{{Main|Water purification}}
Types of water filters include [[media filter]]s, [[screen filter]]s, [[disk filter]]s, [[slow sand filter bed]]s, [[rapid sand filter]]s, [[cloth filter]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Filters|url=http://water.me.vccs.edu/concepts/filters.html|publisher=''[[Mountain Empire Community College]]''|accessdate=2008-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and biological filters such as [[algae scrubber]]s.

===Point-of-use filters===
[[File:WATER PURIFIER.jpg|thumb|Water purifier]]
[[Point of use water treatment|Point-of-use]] filters for home use include [[activated carbon|granular-activated carbon]] filters (GAC) used for [[carbon filtering]], [[depth filter]], [[alloy|metallic alloy filters]], [[ceramic water filter|microporous ceramic filters]], carbon block [[resin]] (CBR), [[microfiltration]] and [[ultrafiltration]] membranes. Some filters use more than one filtration method. An example of this is a multi-barrier system. Jug filters can be used for small quantities of drinking water. Some [[kettle]]s have built-in filters, primarily to reduce [[limescale]] buildup.

Standard Flowmatic cartridge style filters are added to existing plumbing; the filter cartridges are cylinders {{convert|10|inch|0}} long by {{convert|2.5|inch|0}} in diameter. They are made by multiple manufactures and are available in 0.5-100 micron ratings as well as activated carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.filtersfast.com/Watts-Flomatic-Water-Filters-cat.asp|title=Watts Flowmatic Water Systems and Filters including reverse osmosis water filtration systems.|website=Filtersfast.com|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some common substances that filtration does not remove are arsenic, bacteria, chlorides, fluoride, nitrates, perchlorates, pharmaceuticals, sodium and viruses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsf.org/consumer-resources/water-quality/water-filters-testing-treatment/contaminant-reduction-claims-guide|title=Contaminant Reduction Claims Guide - NSF International|website=Nsf.org|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portable water filters===
{{Main|Portable water purification}}
Water filters are used by hikers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9BK5BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=Water+filters+used+by+hikers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjPuMjj6ejUAhUJ6GMKHcf2BGQ4ChDoAQgjMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Water%20filters%20used%20by%20hikers&amp;f=false|title=Hiking the West Coast of Vancouver Island: An Updated and Comprehensive Trail Guide|last=Leadem|first=Tim|date=2015-04-20|publisher=Greystone Books|isbn=9781771641470|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; aid organizations during humanitarian emergencies, and the military. These filters are usually small, portable and lightweight (1-2 pounds/0.5-1.0&amp;nbsp;kg or less), and usually filter water by working a mechanical hand pump, although some use a [[siphon]] drip system to force water through while others are built into water bottles. Dirty water is pumped via a screen-filtered flexible silicon tube through a specialized filter, ending up in a container. These filters work to remove [[bacteria]], [[protozoa]] and [[microbial cyst]]s that can cause disease. Filters may have fine meshes that must be replaced or cleaned, and [[ceramic water filter]]s must have their outside abraded when they have become clogged with impurities.

These water filters should not be confused with devices or tablets that disinfect water which remove or kill [[virus]]es such as [[hepatitis A]] and [[rotavirus]].

== Certification in the United States==
Three organizations are accredited by the [[American National Standards Institute]], and each one of them certified products using American National Standard Institute/National Science Foundation standards. Each American National Standards Institute/National Science Foundation standard requires verification of contaminant reduction performance claims, an evaluation of the unit, including its
materials and structural integrity, and a review of the product labels and sales literature. Each certifies that home water treatment units meet or exceed National Standard Institute/National Science Foundation and [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] drinking water standards. American National Standard Institute/National Science Foundation standards are issued in two different sets, one for health concerns (such as removal of specific contaminants (Standard 53, Health Effects) and one for aesthetic concerns (Aesthetic Effects, such as improving taste or appearance of water). Certification from these organizations will specify one or both of these specific standards.

===NSF International===
NSF International as it is now known started out as the National Sanitation Foundation in 1944 at the  University of Michigan School of Public Health. &lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsf.org/about-nsf/mission-values-history |title=Mission, Values and History - NSF International |website=Nsf.org |date= |accessdate=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSF's water treatment Device Certification Program requires extensive product testing and unannounced audits of production facilities. One goal of this not for profit organization is to provide assurance to consumers that the water treatment devices they are purchasing meet the design, material, and performance requirements of national standards.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Underwriters Laboratories===
[[Underwriters Laboratories]], Inc., is an independent, accredited testing and certification organization that certifies home water treatment units which meet or exceed EPA and American National Standard Institute/National Science Foundation drinking water standards of contaminant reduction, aesthetic concerns, structural integrity, and materials safety.

===Water Quality Association===
The Water Quality Association is a trade organization that tests water treatment equipment, and awards its Gold Seal to systems that meet or exceed ANSI/NSF standards for contaminant reduction performance, structural integrity, and materials safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wqa.org/about-us/who-we-are |title=Who We Are |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |publisher=Water Quality Association |location=Lisle, IL |access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filters that use [[reverse osmosis]], those labeled as “absolute one micron filters,” or those labeled as certified by an American National Standards Institute (ANSI)- accredited organization to American National Standard Institute/National Science Foundation Standard 53 for “Cyst Removal” provide the greatest assurance of removing [[Cryptosporidium]]. As with all filters, follow the manufacturer’s instructions for filter use and replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Water Health Series: Filtration Facts |url=
https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/home-drinking-water-filtration-fact-sheet
|date=September 2005 |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |id=Brochure. 816-K-05-002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water polishing==
The term water polishing can refer to any process that removes small (usually microscopic) particulate material, or removes very low concentrations of dissolved material from water.  The process and its meaning vary from setting to setting: a manufacturer of [[aquarium]] filters may claim that its filters perform water polishing by capturing "micro particles" within [[nylon]] or [[polyester]] pads just as a chemical engineer can use the term to refer to the removal of magnetic resins from a solution by passing the solution over a bed of magnetic particulate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/wo.jsp?wo=2006063406 "Water Polishing Process."] (Patent description.) Retrieved 2009-11-26.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, water polishing is simply another term for whole house water filtration systems. Polishing is also done on a large scale in water reclamation plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hydromentia.com/Products-Services/Algal-Turf-Scrubber/Product-Documentation/Assets/ATS-Technical-Brochure.pdf|format=PDF|title=ALGAL TURF SCRUBBER SYSTEMS FOR POLLUTION CONTROL|website=Hydromentia.com|accessdate=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
During the 19th and 20th centuries, water filters for domestic water production were generally divided into [[slow sand filters]] and [[rapid sand filter]]s (also called mechanical filters and American filters).  While there were many small-scale water filtration systems prior to 1800, [[Paisley, Scotland]] is generally acknowledged as the first city to receive filtered water for an entire town.  The Paisley filter began operation in 1804 and was an early type of slow sand filter.  Throughout the 1800s, hundreds of slow sand filters were constructed in the UK and on the European continent.  An intermittent slow sand filter was constructed and operated at [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]] in 1893 due to continuing typhoid fever epidemics caused by sewage contamination of the water supply.&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;Baker, Moses N. (1981). ''The Quest for Pure Water: the History of Water Purification from the Earliest Records to the Twentieth Century.'' 2nd Edition. Vol. 1. Denver: American Water Works Association, 64-80.&lt;/ref&gt; The first continuously operating slow sand filter was designed by [[Allen Hazen]] for the city of Albany, New York in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;“Allen Hazen.” (1930). ''Jour. American Water Works Association.'' 22:9, 1268-70.&lt;/ref&gt; The most comprehensive history of water filtration was published by [[Moses N. Baker]] in 1948 and reprinted in 1981.&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt;

In the 1800s, mechanical filtration was an industrial process that depended on the addition of [[aluminium sulfate]] prior to the filtration process.  The filtration rate for mechanical filtration was typically more than 60 times faster than slow sand filters, thus requiring significantly less land area.  The first modern mechanical filtration plant in the U.S. was built at Little Falls, New Jersey for the East Jersey Water Company.  [[George W. Fuller]] designed and supervised the construction of the plant which went into operation in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, George W. (1902). “The Filtration Works of the East Jersey Water Company, at Little Falls, New Jersey.” ''Transactions of the ASCE.'' 29 (February)): 153-202.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, [[John R. Baylis]] developed a fixed grid backwash assist system which consisted of pipes with nozzles that injected jets of water into the filter material during expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Baylis, John R. (1959). "Review of Filter Bed Design and Methods of Washing." ''Journal AWWA.'' 51:11 1433-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ženski košarkaški klub Jedinstvo Tuzla''' is a [[women's basketball]] club from [[Tuzla]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].
In 1989 they won the [[EuroLeague Women]], and they played in the 1990 [[Ronchetti Cup]] final.
The most famous ex-player is [[Razija Mujanović]]. Among the other players were: [[Mara Lakić]], Zorica Dragičević, Naida Hot, Smilja Rađenović, Ilvana Zvizdić, Jadranka Savić, Vesna Pođanin, Dragana Jeftić and Stojanka Došić. The most famous ex-coach is Mihajlo Vuković.

==History==
The club was founded in 1945 immediately after the liberation of Yugoslavia in World War II, the same as its male counterpart KK Sloboda Dita.

The club was amateur since its inception, in the early 1970s. The club played in the second Yugoslav Basketball League, with mediocre results until season 1979/1980, when they were promoted to the first Yugoslavian Basketball League. However, they were relegated the following year. The club got back into the first league in season 1982/1983, where they finished in eighth position and were secure from relegation.

The club kept growing and getting better and better results, until winning the title in season 1986/1987.

In season 1987/1988 Jedinstvo played in Europe for the first time. They beat Arama Ankara in the Qualification round, and after that they beat Universitatea Cluj in First round, and got into Group, where they finished third. In home competition they weren't dominant as year before but they managed to secure title in Play Offs after third game.

In the season that followed in 1987/1989, Jedinstvo was once again representative of Yugoslavia in Euroleague and they won competition over Vicenza, but they failed to clinch the domestic title after finishing regular part of season as first.

In season 1989/1990, Jedinstvo won its last Yugoslavia title, and finished second placed in Ronchetti Cup.

In season 1990/1991 the team played in Euroleague, and they finished fifth in Yugoslav League short of two games. Which was last Yugoslavian Basketball season.

==Arena==
Jedinstvo plays its games in SPKC Mejdan in Tuzla, usually in small arena, that has capacity of 600.
