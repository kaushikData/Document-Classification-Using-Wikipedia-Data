The '''A350''' is a north-south [[primary route]] in southern [[England]], that runs from the [[M4 motorway]] in [[Wiltshire]] to [[Poole]] in [[Dorset]].

==Route==
Starting at junction 17 of the M4 motorway north of [[Chippenham, Wiltshire|Chippenham]], the first three miles are a dual carriageway to the northern outskirts of Chippenham, where a partly light-controlled roundabout splits traffic between the bypass section and the road into the town centre. The Chippenham bypass is punctuated by six more roundabouts, the last being at the Lackham College. In so doing it crosses the [[A420 road|A420]] to [[Bristol]] and the A4 for [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] to the West and [[Calne]] to the East.

It then goes past the small village of [[Lacock]] before reaching [[Melksham]] four miles later. The road then follows the [[Semington]] bypass,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bypass set to open to fanfare of celebrations|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/7283608.print/|accessdate=18 April 2015|location=Brighton|date=26 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; opened in 2004, to Westbury, crossing the [[A361 road|A361]] between [[Trowbridge]] and [[Devizes]]. This section of the road has two light-controlled junctions to connect the road to outlying areas of Trowbridge before reaching the [[Yarnbrook]] roundabout. This section is approximately 5 miles long.

The road takes a winding route through the town centre of [[Westbury, Wiltshire|Westbury]] before heading towards [[Warminster]], where it splits from its original route at a light-controlled junction along the Warminster bypass. Where the bypass meets the [[A36 road|A36]] Bath to [[Salisbury]] road, they merge for about 3 miles, before the A350 continues south towards [[Shaftesbury]], passing through Crockerton Green and [[Longbridge Deverill]] and beneath the [[A303 road|A303]].

The section between Shaftesbury and [[Blandford Forum]] is almost completely unimproved and in at least one location the road is not wide enough to allow two lorries to pass safely, with the remainder of this section being narrow with several dangerous blind corners, that could be described as resembling almost B-Road status. The road passes through the hamlet of [[Cann, Dorset|Cann]] and the villages of [[Compton Abbas]], [[Fontmell Magna]], [[Sutton Waldron]], [[Iwerne Minster]] and [[Stourpaine]] before reaching Blandford Forum.

At Blandford Forum is another bypass built to ease town centre traffic where the A350 crossed and merged with the [[A354 road|A354]]. The bypass still merges the two roads for a short stretch. There are four roundabouts on this section, the last of which sees the two roads go their separate ways. The road then passes through the villages of [[Charlton Marshall]], [[Spetisbury]] and [[Sturminster Marshall]] before crossing the [[A31 road|A31]] via a roundabout.

Before reaching Poole, the road joins the [[A35 road|A35]] at a grade separated junction before separating again at a roundabout at the north east end of [[Holes Bay]].  This section is a dual carriageway as far as Poole Railway Station. The final section crosses the Black Water Channel by the Poole Bridge before terminating at the roundabout on New Harbour Road where the Ferry Port is located.

== History ==

When first designated in 1922 the A350 ran only from Warminster to Poole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uk-roads.org.uk/roadlists/1922.shtml#3 1922 road list] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810214402/http://www.uk-roads.org.uk/roadlists/1922.shtml#3 |date=10 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1948 the road had been extended north from Warminster to Chippenham on the former routes of the [[A363 road|A363]] and the A364.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npemap.org.uk/tiles/map.html#391,171,1 1948 Ordnance Survey map]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1990s the road was extended north from Chippenham to the M4 Motorway by renumbering the [[A429]].

===Road Developments===

The Chippenham bypass was built in the 1990s as a single carriageway and was designed for future widening to dual carriageway. Work to dual the section between the Chippenham Golf Club, where the original dual carriageway from the M4 motorway narrowed, to the Badger roundabout was completed in 2014, and the section from Brook roundabout to Bumper's Farm roundabout, the junction with the A420 Bristol Road was completed in 2016. Outline plans have been submitted to complete the remaining sections, as far south as the junction with the A4 Bath Road, by 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.connectingwiltshire.co.uk/connecting-your-journeys/a350-chippenham-dualling/|title=A350 Improvements|website=Connecting Wiltshire|publisher=Wiltshire Council|accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the route between Melksham and [[Semington]] was replaced by a new road that bypassed Semington and, like the Chippenham bypass, was designed to be dualled at a future date. An aqueduct, [[New Semington Aqueduct]], carries the [[Kennet and Avon Canal]] over this section.

==Proposed developments==

===Westbury Bypass===
A controversial £33 million bypass around Westbury was initially proposed in 1997 with public consultation and a selection of route options proposed in 1999. Wiltshire County Council's Environment and Transport Committee selected the Eastern Route (though it was the least popular) as the 'preferred route' in 2001, because the Council said that it offered the best and lowest cost way of relieving traffic congestion in the town centre. The council submitted an initial planning application during 2005. The council said that the government indicated that it was in favour of the project in 2006.&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewestburybypass.co.uk/history.html |title=The Westbury bypass - History |publisher=Wiltshire Council |accessdate=2009-05-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411150322/http://www.thewestburybypass.co.uk/history.html |archivedate=11 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }} &lt;/ref&gt; The Council presented a further planning application in 2007.

The council's selected route (shown on this [http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=107279255646165449244.0004696e37540487f08b1&amp;ll=51.256329,-2.172546&amp;spn=0.056402,0.139389&amp;t=h&amp;z=13 Google overlay map]) would pass to the east of the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewestburybypass.co.uk/plans.html |title=The Westbury bypass - Plan details and maps |publisher=Wiltshire Council |accessdate=2009-05-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411150350/http://www.thewestburybypass.co.uk/plans.html |archivedate=11 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }} &lt;/ref&gt; The council expects it to reduce traffic through Westbury, create more space for cyclists &amp; pedestrians and improve journey time reliability on the A350, by two minutes. It would also provide a new access road to the West Wilts Trading Estate, though not to the other Westbury Trading Estates, or the Railway Station or the designated Future Intermodal Freight Terminal.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt; The Eastern Westbury Bypass scheme, would, by the council's own forecasts, cause increased heavy goods vehicle flow through other West Wiltshire communities, such as Southwick, which already have over twice the HGVs of Westbury. The eastern bypass route is supported by the 'Westbury Bypass Now' group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bypassnow.info/|title=Westbury Bypass Now|accessdate=2009-05-10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611035812/http://www.bypassnow.info/|archivedate=11 June 2009|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The council's route, which runs close to the [[Westbury White Horse]], two [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]], near [[Salisbury Plain]] and through a [[Special Landscape Area]], is not included in the Regional Transport Priority for [[South West England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cprewiltshire.org.uk/cp_trans.html |title=Transport |publisher=Whiltshire CPRE |accessdate=2009-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007095242/http://www.cprewiltshire.org.uk/cp_trans.html |archivedate=7 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The route has been described as 'highly intrusive' by the council's landscape officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planningresource.co.uk/news/ByDiscipline/Development-Control/663053/Bypass-plan-sparks-demand-inquiry/|title=Bypass plan sparks demand for inquiry|publisher = planning resource|accessdate=2009-05-10}}{{dead link|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is attracting opposition from various environmental and local groups including the White Horse Alliance, the [[Campaign to Protect Rural England]], [[Woodland Trust]], [[Friends of the Earth]], [[Campaign for Better Transport (UK)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corridor-alliance.co.uk/|title=White Horse Alliance|publisher=White Horse Alliance|accessdate=2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wiltshire Wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planningresource.co.uk/news/ByDiscipline/Development-Control/663053/Bypass-plan-sparks-demand-inquiry/|title=Bypass plan sparks demand for inquiry|publisher=Planning Resource|accessdate=2009-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scheme was 'called in' in 2007. An Inquiry into the scheme was held in July 2008. It was adjourned until September–October after objectors noticed that some figures for lorry counts were out by 100%. The inquiry ended in the autumn of 2008. The decision was with [[John Denham (politician)|John Denham]] the [[Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bettertransport.org.uk/node/1812 |title=We help Westbury residents send strong message to Government |accessdate=2009-05-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100904155838/http://www.bettertransport.org.uk/node/1812 |archivedate=4 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The planning inspectors have now recommended refusal of planning permission for Wiltshire Council's eastern Westbury bypass scheme. So the scheme has been turned down by the Government.

===Trowbridge===

A scheme has been proposed to improve the A350 West Ashton/Yarnbrook junction to ease traffic flows at a noted bottleneck. This will involve the construction of a new relief road to replace the old section north of the roundabout and introducing new signals at the Ashton Junction. Three new roundabouts are also proposed to connect with the A363 Westbury Road, a link to Yarnbrook village and one at the existing West Ashton Road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.connectingwiltshire.co.uk/connecting-your-journeys/a350-chippenham-dualling/|title=West Ashton/Yarnbrook improvements|accessdate=2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''A631''' is a road running from [[Sheffield]], [[South Yorkshire]] to [[Louth, Lincolnshire]] in England. It passes through the counties of South Yorkshire, [[Nottinghamshire]] and [[Lincolnshire]]. The road has many towns on its route including [[Rotherham]], [[Maltby, South Yorkshire|Maltby]], [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire|Gainsborough]] and [[Market Rasen]]. It is mostly single road throughout its length but has some stretches of [[dual carriageway]] as well. The road is approximately {{convert|65|mi|km}} long.

==Sheffield (Meadowhall) to Bawtry==
The road starts at the M1/A6109 junction at Meadowhall. This is the northern half of Junction 34 on the M1. The road then passes under the M1 on the lower deck of the [[Tinsley Viaduct]] as a dual carriageway with the Meadowhall Shopping Centre visible to the southwest. At the southern half of junction 34 a roundabout links the road to the A6178 Sheffield Road and the A6102 Shepcote Lane (part of the Sheffield by-pass). This short section is classified as a trunk road.

[[File:Tinsley viaduct at sunset.jpg|thumb|140px|left|[[Tinsley Viaduct]] ]]
After the M1 the road is a single carriageway non-trunk road and heads east to Rotherham as ''Bawtry Road'' through [[Tinsley, South Yorkshire|Tinsley]]. It passes Tinsley Infants School and Tinsley Junior School, and on the left hand side on the corner oh ''Highgate'' is the ''[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2662604 Pike &amp; Heron]''. The [[Jamia al Hudaa Sheffield]], a girls' independent Muslim secondary school is on the right, and opposite ''Park House Lane'' is the [[Outokumpu]] sports and social club, with [[Sheffield Hallam University]]'s Graham Solley Sports Development Centre on the [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1832216 right] (where SHU play other universities at sport). The road enters the borough of Rotherham at a bend to the left, becomes the parish [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/799448 boundary] between [[Brinsworth]] and Rotherham, and there is a crossroads, with the left for ''Balk Lane'' and the [[The BOC Group|BOC]] [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/121676 Brinsworth Operations Centre], opposite [[Firth Rixson]] Aurora Sports Club, and the right for ''Bonet Lane'' (B6067) near ''The Fairway''. There is a left turn for [http://www.phoenixgolfclub.co.uk Phoenix Golf Club], a right turn for ''Brinsworth Lane'' near former ''The Atlas'' and the [[Esso]] ''Brinsworth Service Station'', a right turn for ''Whitehill Lane'' (B6066, for [[Catcliffe]], and is also the [[Trans Pennine Trail]]). It passes under a 15&amp;nbsp;ft 3&amp;nbsp;in [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/799181 railway bridge], and [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1420566 crosses] the [[River Rother, South Yorkshire|River Rother]].

[[File:Canklow Bridge looking east - geograph.org.uk - 799192.jpg|thumb|140px|right|Canklow Roundabout]]
The road then serves as a bypass of Rotherham after it combines with the [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/799179 dual-carriageway] ''Centenary Way'' ([[A630 road|A630]]) at ''[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/799192 Canklow Roundabout]''. A [[Total S.A.|TOTAL]] garage is on the right, and a McDonald's and the [[Pace Petroleum|Pace]] (former Q8) ''Canklow Service Station'' is opposite. It continues to the south-east as the non-trunk dual-carriageway ''[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/799160 West Bawtry Road]'', with [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/799172 Canklow Woods] to the east, on the side of the [[River Rother, South Yorkshire|Rother Valley]]. Canklow Meadows Industrial Estate is on the [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1323501 right] with Leger Holidays HQ, the large ''Crossroads'' Volvo [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/799162 truck garage], and [[Manheim Auctions]]. It is followed by the Canklow Meadows Retail Park, and it passes the [[Holiday Inn]] [http://www.holidayinn.com/hotels/us/en/rotherham/emart/hoteldetail Rotherham-Sheffield] on the left (former [[Swallow Hotels|Swallow Hotel]]), opposite [[Energy Alloys]]. The A630 (''Rotherway'') leaves to the right at the busy ''Rotherway Roundabout'', over the River Rother, to junction 33 of the M1, with a large [[electrical substation]] to the right. The A631 used to continue to the east as a trunk single-carriageway, but was upgraded to dual carriage way to the A618, and is crosses by the [[Rotherham Roundwalk]]. The West Bawtry Road Improvement - Rotherway to Whiston Crossroads was built by [[Birse Civils]] of [[Barton-upon-Humber]] for £5 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestar.co.uk/lifestyle/features/crossroads_work_begins_1_339381 Rotherway to Whiston]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/south_yorkshire/5388230.stm Whiston Improvement 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; The A631 is now dual-carriageway between the M1 and M18 junctions

      <comment>Removed the phrase "so-called" meningitis belt. The sarcastic phrase "so-called" makes a person question if the article is even correct. Makes it more like an opinion article then one where people have researched and wrote an article.</comment>

The '''African meningitis belt''' is a region in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] where the rate of incidence of [[meningitis]] is very high. The primary cause of meningitis of the belt is ''[[Neisseria meningitis]]''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/914223501|title=Medical microbiology|last=Murray|first=Patrick R.|last2=Rosenthal|first2=Ken S.|last3=Pfaller|first3=Michael A.|isbn=9780323299565|edition=8th|location=Philadelphia, PA|oclc=914223501}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Regions==
It consists of part of or all of (from West to East), [[the Gambia]], [[Senegal]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Guinea]], [[Mali]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Ghana]], [[Niger]], [[Nigeria]], [[Cameroon]], [[Chad]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Sudan]], [[South Sudan]], [[Uganda]], [[Kenya]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]]. The "belt" has an estimated 300 million people in its total area.  This region is not only prone to meningitis,&lt;ref name="lycos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lycos.com/info/meningitis--meningitis-belt.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519071343/http://www.lycos.com/info/meningitis--meningitis-belt.html |archivedate=2008-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but also very prone to epidemics such as [[malaria]].

The most affected countries in the region are Burkina Faso, Chad, Ethiopia, and Niger. Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, and Niger were accountable for 65% of all cases in Africa. In major epidemics, the [[attack rate]] range is 100 to 800 people per 100,000. However, communities can have attack rates as high as 1000 per 100,000. During these epidemics, young children have the highest attack rates.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;http://www.meningvax.org/epidemics-africa.php&lt;/ref&gt; More than 90,000 cases reported in the belt in 2009, contrary to less than 800 cases of that in the [[United States]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in 2011.

==Meningitis vaccine==
{{Main|Meningitis Vaccine Project}}
The Meningitis Vaccine Project was conceived in 2001 as an effort to stop the spread of meningitis in this region. As of June 2011, reports projected that the meningitis in this region would be under control with efficiency that local governments had desired.

The '''Bhojpuri region''' is an area encompassing parts of [[Bihar]], [[Jharkhand]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]] in northern [[India]] and the [[Bara District|Bara]] and [[Parsa District|Parsa]] districts of [[Nepal]] where the [[Bhojpuri language]] is spoken as a mother tongue language. [[Ujjainiya]] Rajputs of the former [[Shahabad district]] of ancient [[Bihar]] established their headquarters in the town of [[Arrah]], [[Bhojpur district, Bihar|Bhojpur district]] from where the whole region received its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kolff|first=Dirk H.A.|year=2002|orig-year=First published 1990|title=Naukar, Rajput, and sepoy : the ethnohistory of the military labour market in Hindustan, 1450-1850|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=160|isbn=0-521-52305-2|quote=The Bhojpuri region received its name after the town of Bhojpur, the ancient headquarters of the Ujjainiya Rajputs of the erstwhile Shahabad district of Bihar.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
Culture of Bhojpuri region is a part of India's North-Central Cultural Zone akin to rest of [[North India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nczccindia.in |title=North Central Zonal Cultural Centre |publisher=Nczccindia.in |date=2007-03-18 |accessdate=2015-07-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721065144/http://www.nczccindia.in/ |archivedate=21 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The economic and industrial growth of this region had been greatly hindered because of caste-guided political in-fighting and a huge population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epuinfo.com/node/4]   {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827085623/http://www.epuinfo.com/node/4 |date=27 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The culture of Bhojpur is also very much present today in [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], [[Fiji]], [[Mauritius]], and [[South Africa]], due to the many [[Indian indenture system|Indian indentured laborers]] who were sent there by the ruling British in the mid [[19th century]] to the early [[20th century]], and were from the [[Purvanchal|Purvanchal-Bhojpur]] region.

==Districts==
Bhojpuri language is spoken in the districts of Western [[Bihar]], Eastern [[Uttar Pradesh]] which is called [[Purvanchal]] and middle Terai region, [[Province No. 2]]  of [[Nepal]].&lt;ref name=Discover-Bihar&gt;{{cite web |url=http://discoverbihar.bih.nic.in/pages/bhojpuri_culture.htm |title=Culture of Bhojpuri Region |accessdate=2018-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416170057/http://discoverbihar.bih.nic.in/pages/bhojpuri_culture.htm |archivedate=16 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}.

The '''border area''' is the area immediately adjacent to the border of a country. In addition to the informal definition, a border area may have a legal definition and delineation, both domestically and due to bilateral agreements. Reasons for legal definition of a border area include enhanced security and special provisions for the residents of border areas to cross  the border ([[local border traffic]]).

In the [[United States]], a 100-mile border zone from the border was created, in which [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|Customs and Border Protection]]’s officials have authority for stop and search (see also: [[Mexico–United States border#100-mile border zone|100-mile zone at the Mexico–United States border]]).

For [[Schengen States]], [[Schengen Area#Local border traffic at external borders|a regulation for local border traffic at external borders]] &lt;ref&gt;Corrigendum to Regulation (EC) No 1931/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 laying down rules on local border traffic at the external land borders of the Member States and amending the provisions of the Schengen Convention ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32006R1931R%2801%29:EN:NOT OJ L 29, 3 February 2007, p. 3]).&lt;/ref&gt; define a border area which may extend to a maximum of {{convert|50|km|mi}} on either side of the border. An exception is made for [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], see "[[Poland–Russia border]]" article for details.

In the [[Soviet Union]] of the [[Interbellum]] and  post-[[World War II]] periods, the border areas were subject to severe [[ethnic cleansing]] of nationals of "[[Fifth column|potentially hostile]]"  ethnicities;&lt;ref&gt;Павел Полян, ''Не по своей воле...'' ([[Pavel Polian]], ''[[Against Their Will (book)|Against Their Will]]... A History and Geography of Forced Migrations in the USSR''), ОГИ Мемориал, Moscow, 2001, {{ISBN|5-94282-007-4}} {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; see [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union]] and [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union#Deportations from border territories in 1939–1941]] for details.

The Caspian Sea presently lies about {{convert|28|m|0|abbr=on}} below [[sea level]] in the [[Caspian Depression]], to the east of the [[Caucasus Mountains]] and to the west of the vast steppe of [[Central Asia]]. The sea bed in the southern part reaches as low as {{convert|1023|m|0|abbr=on}} below sea level, which is the second lowest natural [[depression (geology)|depression]] on earth after [[Lake Baikal]] ({{convert|-1180|m|0|abbr=on|disp=comma}}). The ancient inhabitants of its coast perceived the Caspian Sea as an ocean, probably because of its saltiness and large size.

The sea has a surface area of {{Convert|371000|km2|mi2|-2|abbr=on}} (not including the detached lagoon of [[Garabogazköl]]) and a volume of {{Convert|78200|km3|mi3|-2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="LakeNet"&gt;[http://www.worldlakes.org/lakedetails.asp?lakeid=8762 Lake Profile: Caspian Sea].

==Etymology==
The word Caspian is derived from the name of the [[Caspians|Caspi]], an ancient people who lived to the southwest of the sea in [[Transcaucasia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110540 Caspian Sea] in Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strabo]] wrote that "to [[Caucasian Albania|the country of the Albanians]] belongs also the territory called Caspiane, which was named after the Caspian tribe, as was also the sea; but the tribe has now disappeared".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0198:book=11:chapter=4&amp;highlight=caspiane |title=Strabo. Geography. 11.3.1 |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |accessdate=2011-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the [[Caspian Gates]], which is the name of a region in  [[Iran]]'s [[Tehran province]], possibly indicates that they migrated to the south of the sea. The Iranian city of [[Qazvin]] shares the root of its name with that of the sea. In fact, the traditional Arabic name for the sea itself is Baḥr al-Qazwin (Sea of Qazvin).&lt;ref name="LPIran"&gt;''Iran'' (5th ed., 2008), by Andrew Burke and Mark Elliott, [http://www.lonelyplanet.com/shop_pickandmix/previews/iran-5-history-preview.pdf p. 28] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607152838/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/shop_pickandmix/previews/iran-5-history-preview.pdf |date=2011-06-07 }}, Lonely Planet Publications, {{ISBN|978-1-74104-293-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[classical antiquity]] among Greeks and Persians it was called the ''[[Hyrcania]]n Ocean''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/ho-hz/hyrcania/hyrcania.html Hyrcania]. www.livius.org. Retrieved 2012-05-20.&lt;/ref&gt; In Persian antiquity, as well as in modern [[Iran]], it is known as {{lang|fa|درياى خزر}}, ''Daryā-e Khazar''; it is also sometimes referred to as ''[[Mazandaran]] Sea'' ({{lang-fa|دریای مازندران}}) in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.briancoad.com/Introduction/caspianseabasin.htm Drainage Basins – Caspian Sea]. Briancoad.com. Retrieved 2012-05-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Arabic sources refer to it as ''Baḥr Gīlān'' (بحر گیلان) meaning "the [[Gilan]] Sea".

[[Turkic languages]] refer to the lake as ''[[Khazar]] Sea''. In [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]], the name is {{lang|tk|Hazar deňizi}}, in [[Azeri language|Azeri]], it is {{lang|az|Xəzər dənizi}}, and in [[Turkish language|modern Turkish]], it is {{lang|tr|Hazar denizi}}. In all these cases, the second word simply means "sea", and the first word refers to the historical Khazars who had a large empire based to the north of the Caspian Sea between the 7th and 10th centuries. An exception is [[Kazakh Language|Kazakh]], where it is called {{lang|kk|Каспий теңізі}}, ''Kaspiy teñizi'' (Caspian Sea).

Renaissance European maps labelled it as ''Abbacuch Sea'' (Oronce Fine's 1531 world map), ''Mar de Bachu'' (Ortellius' 1570 map), or ''Mar de Sala'' (Mercator's 1569 map).

Old Russian sources call it the ''Khvalyn'' or ''Khvalis'' Sea (Хвалынское море / Хвалисское море) after the name of [[Khwarezmia]].&lt;ref&gt;Max Vasmer, ''Etimologicheskii slovar' russkogo yazyka'', Vol. IV (Moscow: Progress, 1973), p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; In modern Russian, it is called {{lang|ru|Каспи́йское мо́ре}}, ''Kaspiyskoye more''.

==Physical characteristics==

===Formation===
The Caspian Sea, like the [[Black Sea]], [[Namak Lake]], and [[Lake Urmia]], is a remnant of the ancient [[Paratethys|Paratethys Sea]]. It became landlocked about 5.5 million years ago due to [[tectonic uplift]] and a fall in [[sea level]]. During warm and dry climatic periods, the landlocked sea almost dried up, depositing [[evaporite|evaporitic sediments]] like [[halite]] that were covered by wind-blown deposits and were sealed off as an [[evaporite]] [[Sink (geography)|sink]] when cool, wet climates refilled the basin. (Comparable evaporite beds underlie the Mediterranean.) Due to the current inflow of fresh water, the Caspian Sea is a [[freshwater]] lake in its northern portions, and is most saline on the Iranian shore, where the catchment basin contributes little flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caspinfo.net/content/content.asp?menu=0130000_000000 |title=Sea Facts |work=Casp Info |accessdate=2017-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the mean salinity of the Caspian is one third that of Earth's oceans. The [[Garabogazköl]] [[embayment]], which dried up when water flow from the main body of the Caspian was blocked in the 1980s but has since been restored, routinely exceeds oceanic salinity by a factor of 10.&lt;ref name="web1"/&gt;

===Geography===
[[File:CaspianSeaDrainage v1.png|thumb|Area around the Caspian Sea. Yellow area indicates the (approximate) drainage area.]]

The Caspian Sea is the largest inland body of water in the world and accounts for 40 to 44% of the total [[wikt:lacustrine|lacustrine]] waters of the world.&lt;ref name="irngaz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irangazette.com/12.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122212158/http://irangazette.com/12.html |archivedate=2009-01-22 |title=Caspian Sea |work=Iran Gazette |accessdate=2010-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coastlines of the Caspian are shared by [[Azerbaijan]], [[Iran]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Russia]], and [[Turkmenistan]]. The Caspian is divided into three distinct physical regions: the Northern, Middle, and Southern Caspian.&lt;ref name="hooshang1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hooshang Amirahmadi|title=The Caspian Region at a Crossroad: Challenges of a New Frontier of Energy and Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zMQp4_Shq90C&amp;pg=PA112|accessdate=20 May 2012|date=10 June 2000|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-22351-9|pages=112–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Northern–Middle boundary is the Mangyshlak Threshold, which runs through [[Chechen Island]] and [[Cape Tiub-Karagan]]. The Middle–Southern boundary is the Apsheron Threshold, a [[Aquatic sill|sill]] of tectonic origin between the Eurasian continent and an oceanic remnant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Khain V. E. Gadjiev A. N. Kengerli T. N|title=Tectonic origin of the Apsheron Threshold in the Caspian Sea|journal=Doklady Earth Sciences|volume=414|year=2007|pages=552–556|doi=10.1134/S1028334X07040149}}&lt;/ref&gt; that runs through Zhiloi Island and Cape Kuuli.&lt;ref name="dumont1"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Henri J. Dumont|author2=Tamara A.

Differences between the three regions are dramatic. The Northern Caspian only includes the Caspian shelf,&lt;ref name="kost1"&gt;{{cite book|author=A. G. Kostianoi and A. Kosarev|title=The Caspian Sea Environment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C1ajCHzI9OEC |accessdate=20 May 2012|date=16 December 2005|publisher=Birkhäuser|isbn=978-3-540-28281-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is very shallow; it accounts for less than 1% of the total water volume with an average depth of only {{convert|5|-|6|m|ft}}. The sea noticeably drops off towards the Middle Caspian, where the average depth is {{convert|190|m|ft|-1}}.&lt;ref name="dumont1"/&gt; The Southern Caspian is the deepest, with oceanic depths of over {{convert|1000|m|ft|-2}}, greatly exceeding the depth of other regional seas, such as the [[Persian Gulf]]. The Middle and Southern Caspian account for 33% and 66% of the total water volume, respectively.&lt;ref name="hooshang1"/&gt; The northern portion of the Caspian Sea typically freezes in the winter, and in the coldest winters ice forms in the south as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ann.az/en/?p=19304 |title=News Azerbaijan|work=ann.az|accessdate=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 130 rivers provide inflow to the Caspian, with the [[Volga River]] being the largest. A second affluent, the [[Ural River]], flows in from the north, and the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura River]] flows into the sea from the west. In the past, the [[Amu Darya]] (Oxus) of Central Asia in the east often changed course to empty into the Caspian through a now-desiccated riverbed called the [[Uzboy River]], as did the [[Syr Darya]] farther north. The Caspian also has several small islands; they are primarily located in the north and have a collective land area of roughly {{convert|2000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}. Adjacent to the North Caspian is the [[Caspian Depression]], a low-lying region {{convert|27|m|ft|0}} below [[sea level]]. The [[Central Asia]]n [[steppe]]s stretch across the northeast coast, while the [[Greater Caucasus|Caucasus mountains]] hug the western shore. The [[biomes]] to both the north and east are characterized by cold, continental deserts. Conversely, the climate to the southwest and south are generally warm with uneven elevation due to a mix of highlands and [[mountain range]]s; the drastic changes in climate alongside the Caspian have led to a great deal of [[biodiversity]] in the region.&lt;ref name="web1"/&gt;{{clear left}}

The Caspian Sea has numerous islands throughout, all of them near the coasts; none in the deeper parts of the sea. [[Ogurja Ada]] is the largest island. The island is {{convert|37|km|0|abbr=on}} long, with [[gazelle]]s roaming freely on it. In the North Caspian, the majority of the islands are small and uninhabited, like the [[Tyuleniy Archipelago (Kazakhstan)|Tyuleniy Archipelago]], an [[Important Bird Area]] (IBA), although some of them have human settlements.

===Hydrology===
[[File:Caspian Sea Kazakhstan Mangistau.jpg|thumb|Caspian Sea near [[Aktau]], [[Mangystau Region]], [[Kazakhstan]]]]

The Caspian has characteristics common to both seas and lakes. It is often listed as the world's largest lake, although it is not a [[freshwater]] lake.  It contains about 3.5 times more water, by volume, than all five of North America's [[Great Lakes]] combined.  The Caspian was once part of the [[Tethys Ocean]], but became landlocked about 5.5 million years ago due to [[plate tectonics]].&lt;ref name="irngaz"/&gt; The [[Volga River]] (about 80% of the inflow) and the [[Ural River]] discharge into the Caspian Sea, but it has no natural outflow other than by [[evaporation]]. Thus the Caspian [[ecosystem]] is a [[closed basin]], with its own sea level history that is independent of the [[Eustasis|eustatic]] level of the world's oceans.

The level of the Caspian has fallen and risen, often rapidly, many times over the centuries. Some Russian historians{{Who|date=May 2011}} claim that a [[medieval]] rising of the Caspian, perhaps caused by the [[Amu Darya]] changing its inflow to the Caspian from the 13th century to the 16th century, caused the coastal towns of [[Khazars|Khazaria]], such as [[Atil, Khazaria|Atil]], to flood. In 2004, the water level was {{convert|28|m|abbr=off}} below [[sea level]].

Over the centuries, Caspian Sea levels have changed in synchrony with the estimated discharge of the Volga, which in turn depends on rainfall levels in its vast catchment basin. Precipitation is related to variations in the amount of North Atlantic depressions that reach the interior, and they in turn are affected by cycles of the [[North Atlantic oscillation]]. Thus levels in the Caspian Sea relate to atmospheric conditions in the North Atlantic, thousands of miles to the northwest.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The last short-term sea-level cycle started with a sea-level fall of {{convert|3|m|0|abbr=on}} from 1929 to 1977, followed by a rise of {{convert|3|m|0|abbr=on}} from 1977 until 1995.  Since then smaller oscillations have taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caspage.citg.tudelft.nl/project.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724171008/http://www.caspage.citg.tudelft.nl/project.html |archivedate=2011-07-24 |title=Welcome to the Caspian Sea Level Project Site |publisher=Caspage.citg.tudelft.nl |accessdate=2010-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental degradation===
The [[Volga River]], the largest in Europe, drains 20% of the European land area and is the source of 80% of the Caspian's inflow. Its lower reaches are heavily developed with numerous unregulated releases of chemical and biological pollutants. Although existing data is sparse and of questionable quality, there is ample evidence to suggest that the Volga is one of the principal sources of transboundary contaminants into the Caspian.

The magnitude of [[fossil fuel]] extraction and transport activity in the Caspian also poses a risk to the environment. The island of [[Vulf]] off [[Baku]], for example, has suffered ecological damage as a result of the petrochemical industry; this has significantly decreased the number of species of marine birds in the area. Existing and planned oil and gas pipelines under the sea further increase the potential threat to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caspianenvironment.org/newsite/Caspian-EnvironmentalIssues.htm |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100413172855/http://www.caspianenvironment.org/newsite/Caspian-EnvironmentalIssues.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 April 2010 |title=Caspian Environment Programme |publisher=caspianenvironment.org |accessdate=30 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vladimir Filanovsky]] field in the Russian section of the body of water was discovered for its wealth of oil in 2005. It is reportedly the largest discovery of oil in 25 years. It was announced in October 2016 that [[Lukoil]] would start production in this region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=LUKOIL starts up V.Filanovsky in the Caspian Sea |url=http://www.offshore-mag.com/articles/2016/10/lukoil-starts-up-v-filanovsky-in-the-caspian-sea.html |date=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aquatic===
====Flora====
The rising level of the Caspian Sea between 1994 and 1996 reduced the number of habitats for rare species of aquatic vegetation. This has been attributed to a general lack of seeding material in newly formed coastal lagoons and water bodies.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

====Fauna====
[[File:Benthophilus casachicus, Caspian Sea.jpg|thumb|Most [[Tadpole goby|tadpole gobies]] (''Benthophilus'') are only found in the Caspian Sea basin.&lt;ref name=Naseka2009/&gt;]]

The [[Caspian turtle]] (''Mauremys caspica''), although found in neighboring areas, is a wholly freshwater species. The [[zebra mussel]] is native to the Caspian and Black Sea basins, but has become an [[invasive species]] elsewhere, when introduced. The area has given its name to several species, including the [[Caspian gull]] and the [[Caspian tern]]. The [[Caspian seal]] (''Pusa caspica'') is the only aquatic mammal and is [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to the Caspian Sea, being one of very few [[Pinniped|seal species]] that live in inland waters, but it is different from the [[Freshwater seal|those inhabiting freshwaters]] due to the hydrological environment of the sea.

Archeological studies of [[Gobustan National Park|Gobustan]] [[petroglyph]]s indicate that there once had been [[dolphin]]s and [[porpoise]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Caspian Sea|url=http://www.allthesea.com/The-Caspian-Sea.html|work=All The Sea|accessdate=2015-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Masuleh|url=http://www.persevoyages.com/iran.masuleh.htm|accessdate=2015-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a certain species of [[beaked whale]]s&lt;ref name=Gallagher&gt;{{cite web|url=https://grahamhancock.com/gallagherr1/|author=Gallagher  R.|year=2012|title=Azerbaijan: Land of Fire and Flood – Ancient Mariners and a Deluged Landscape – Rock Art Evidence of a Marine Inflow.|publisher=The Official [[Graham Hancock]] Homepage|accessdate=2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a whaling scene indicates large [[baleen whale]]s&lt;ref name=Gallagher2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://documentslide.com/documents/the-ice-age-rise-and-fall-of-the-ponto-caspian-ancient-mariners-and-the-asiatic-mediterranean-55b94263756cb.html|last=Gallagher |first=R.|title= THE ICE AGE RISE AND FALL OF THE PONTO CASPIAN: ANCIENT MARINERS AND THE ASIATIC MEDITERRANEAN.|publisher=Documentlide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; likely being present in Caspian Sea at least until when the Caspian Sea ceased being a part of the ocean system or until the [[Quaternary]] or much more recent periods such as until the [[last glacial period]] or [[Ancient history|antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The [[Smithsonian Institution]]|title=Gobustan Petroglyphs – Methods &amp; Chronology|url=http://gobustan.si.edu/dating_methods_chronology|accessdate=2015-01-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428044511/http://gobustan.si.edu/dating_methods_chronology|archivedate=2015-04-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the rock art on [[Kichikdash Mountain]] is assumed to be of a dolphin&lt;ref name=GH&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The [[Smithsonian Institution]]|title=Gobustan Petroglyphs – Subject Matter|url=http://gobustan.si.edu/subject_matter|accessdate=2015-01-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428044339/http://gobustan.si.edu/subject_matter|archivedate=2015-04-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or of a beaked whale,&lt;ref name=Gallagher /&gt; it might instead represent the famous [[Beluga (sturgeon)|beluga sturgeon]] due to its size (430&amp;nbsp;cm in length), but fossil records suggest certain ancestors of modern dolphins and whales, such as ''[[Kentriodontidae|Macrokentriodon]] morani'' ([[bottlenose dolphin]]s) and ''[[Balaenoptera sibbaldina]]'' ([[blue whale]]s) were presumably larger than their present descendants. From the same artworks, [[auk]]s, like [[Thick-billed murre|Brunnich's Guillemot]] could also have been in the sea as well, and these petroglyphs suggest marine inflow between the current Caspian Sea and the Arctic Ocean or [[North Sea]], or the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref name=GH /&gt; This is supported by the existences of current endemic, oceanic species such as [[Cerastoderma glaucum|lagoon cockles]] which was genetically identified to originate in Caspian/Black Seas regions.&lt;ref name=Gallagher2 /&gt;

===Terrestrial===
====Flora====
Many rare and endemic plant species of Russia are associated with the [[Intertidal zone|tidal areas]] of the [[Volga delta]] and [[riparian forest]]s of the [[Samur River]] delta. The shoreline is also a unique refuge for plants adapted to the loose sands of the [[Central Asian northern desert|Central Asian Deserts]]. The principal limiting factors to successful establishment of plant species are hydrological imbalances within the surrounding deltas, [[water pollution]], and various land reclamation activities. The water level change within the Caspian Sea is an indirect reason for which plants may not get established.

These affect aquatic plants of the Volga Delta, such as ''[[Aldrovanda vesiculosa]]'' and the native ''[[Nelumbo|Nelumbo caspica]]''. About 11 plant species are found in the Samur River Delta, including the unique [[liana]] forests that date back to the [[Tertiary period]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The earliest hominid remains found around the Caspian Sea are from [[Dmanisi]] dating back to around 1.8 Ma and yielded a number of skeletal remains of [[Homo erectus]] or [[Homo ergaster]]. More later evidence for human occupation of the region came from a number of caves in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and Azerbaijan such as Kudaro and [[Azykh Cave]]s. There is evidence for [[Lower Palaeolithic]] human occupation south of the Caspian from western Alburz. These are Ganj Par and [[Darband Cave]] sites.

[[Neanderthal]] remains also have been discovered at a cave site in Georgia. Discoveries in the Huto cave and the adjacent Kamarband cave, near the town of [[Behshahr]], [[Mazandaran]] south of the Caspian in Iran, suggest human habitation of the area as early as 11,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranair.com/site/779/default.aspx "Major Monuments"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514134103/http://www.iranair.com/site/779/default.aspx |date=May 14, 2011 }}.

The Caspian area is rich in energy resources. Oil wells were being dug in the region as early as the 10th century to reach oil "for use in everyday life, both for medicinal purposes and for heating and lighting in homes".&lt;ref name=SOCAR1&gt;[http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/42_folder/42_articles/42_socarkhoshbakht.html "The Development of the Oil and Gas Industry in Azerbaijan]". SOCAR&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}} By the 16th century, Europeans were aware of the rich oil and gas deposits around the area. English traders Thomas Bannister and Jeffrey Duckett described the area around Baku as "a strange thing to behold, for there issueth out of the ground a marvelous quantity of oil, which serveth all the country to burn in their houses. This oil is black and is called [[naphtha#Etymology|nefte]]. There is also by the town of Baku, another kind of oil which is white and very precious [i.e., [[petroleum]]]."&lt;ref name=SOCAR2&gt;[http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/63_folder/63_articles/63_adams.html "Back to the Future: Britain, Baku Oil and the Cycle of History]". SOCAR&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In the 18th century, during the rule of [[Peter I the Great]], [[Fedor Ivanovich Soimonov|Fedor I. Soimonov]], hydrographer and pioneering explorer of the Caspian Sea charted the until then little known body of water. Soimonov drew a set of four maps and wrote ''Pilot of the Caspian Sea'', the first report and modern maps of the Caspian, that were published in 1720 by the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/767183/Fedor-I-Soimonov |title=Fedor I.

==Oil extraction==
[[File:Oil pipelines in the Caspian region.gif|thumb|Oil pipelines in the Caspian region. September 2002]]
[[File:Caspian region oil and natural gas infrastructure.png|thumb|Caspian region oil and natural gas infrastructure. August 2013.]]

The world's first offshore wells and machine-drilled wells were made in Bibi-Heybat Bay, near [[Baku, Azerbaijan]]. In 1873, exploration and development of oil began in some of the largest fields known to exist in the world at that time on the [[Absheron Peninsula]] near the villages of Balakhanli, Sabunchi, Ramana, and Bibi Heybat. Total recoverable reserves were more than 500 million tons. By 1900, Baku had more than 3,000 oil wells, 2,000 of which were producing at industrial levels. By the end of the 19th century, Baku became known as the "black gold capital", and many skilled workers and specialists flocked to the city.

By the beginning of the 20th century, Baku was the centre of international oil industry. In 1920, when the [[Bolsheviks]] captured [[Azerbaijan]], all private property – including oil wells and factories – was confiscated. Afterwards, the republic's entire oil industry came under the control of the [[Soviet Union]]. By 1941, Azerbaijan was producing a record 23.5 million tons of oil per year, and the Baku region supplied nearly 72 percent of all oil extracted in the entire Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=SOCAR1/&gt;

In 1994, the "[[Contract of the Century (Azerbaijan)|Contract of the Century]]" was signed, signalling the start of major international development of the Baku oil fields. The [[Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline]], a major pipeline allowing Azerbaijan oil to flow straight to the Turkish Mediterranean port of [[Ceyhan]], opened in 2006.

===Political issues===
Many of the islands along the Azerbaijani coast continue to hold significant geopolitical and economic importance because of the potential oil reserves found nearby. [[Bulla Island]], [[Pirallahı Island]], and [[Nargin (island)|Nargin]], which is still used as a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] base and is the largest island in the [[Baku]] bay, all hold oil reserves.

The collapse of the Soviet Union and subsequent opening of the region has led to an intense investment and development scramble by international oil companies. In 1998, [[Dick Cheney]] commented that "I can't think of a time when we've had a region emerge as suddenly to become as strategically significant as the Caspian."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.csmonitor.com/2001/1025/p8s1-comv.html The Great Gas Game]", ''Christian Science Monitor'' (2001-10-25)&lt;/ref&gt;

A key problem to further development in the region is the status of the Caspian Sea and the establishment of the water boundaries among the five [[littoral]] states. The current disputes along Azerbaijan's maritime borders with Turkmenistan and Iran could potentially affect future development plans.

Much controversy currently exists over the proposed Trans-Caspian [[Trans-Caspian Oil Transport System|oil]] and [[Trans-Caspian Gas Pipeline|gas]] pipelines. These projects would allow Western markets easier access to Kazakh oil and, potentially, Uzbek and Turkmen gas as well. Russia officially opposes the project on environmental grounds.&lt;ref name="scuttle"&gt;Sergei Blagov, "[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav032806.shtml Russia Tries to Scuttle Proposed Trans-Caspian Pipeline] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610044226/http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav032806.shtml# |date=2007-06-10 }}", Eurasianet (2006-03-27)&lt;/ref&gt; However, analysts note that the pipelines would bypass Russia completely, thereby denying the country valuable transit fees, as well as destroying its current [[monopoly]] on westward-bound [[hydrocarbon]] exports from the region.&lt;ref name="scuttle"/&gt; Recently, both Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan have expressed their support for the Trans-Caspian Pipeline.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/business/articles/eav121107.shtml Russia Seeking To Keep Kazakhstan Happy]", Eurasianet (2007-12-10)&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. [[diplomatic cable]]s disclosed by [[WikiLeaks]] revealed that [[BP]] covered up a gas leak and [[Blowout (well drilling)|blowout]] incident in September 2008 at an operating gas field in the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshi area of the Azerbaijan Caspian Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tim Webb|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/15/wikileaks-bp-azerbaijan-gulf-spill |title=WikiLeaks cables: BP suffered blowout on Azerbaijan gas platform|work=The Guardian|date=2010-12-15|accessdate=2013-03-26|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walt|first=Vivienne|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2037830,00.html |title=WikiLeaks Reveals BP's 'Other' Offshore Drilling Disaster|work=Time|date=2010-12-18|accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Territorial status==
[[File:Iran southern caspian energy prospects 2004.jpg|thumb|Southern Caspian Energy Prospects (portion of Iran). Country Profile 2004.]]
[[File:Baku Bulvar.jpg|right|thumb|Caspian Sea, Azerbaijan]]

{{as of|2000}}, negotiations related to the [[Demarcation line|demarcation]] of the Caspian Sea had been going on for nearly a decade among the states bordering the Caspian – Azerbaijan, Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Iran. The status of the Caspian Sea&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/83_folder/83_articles/83_yusifzade.html |title=8.3 The Status of the Caspian Sea – Dividing Natural Resources Between Five Countries|author=Khoshbakht B. Yusifzade|publisher=Azer.com|accessdate=2010-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the key problem. Access to mineral resources ([[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]]), access for [[fishing]], and access to [[international waters]] (through Russia's [[Volga]] river and the canals connecting it to the [[Black Sea]] and [[Baltic Sea]]) all depend upon the outcomes of negotiations. Access to the Volga River is particularly important for the [[landlocked]] states of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan. This concerns Russia, because the potential traffic would use its inland [[waterway]]s. If a body of water is labelled as a [[sea]], then there would be some precedents and international treaties obliging the granting of access permits to foreign vessels. If a body of water is labelled merely as a [[lake]], then there are no such obligations. [[Environment (biophysical)|Environmental]] issues are also somewhat connected to the status and [[border]]s issue.

All five Caspian littoral states maintain naval forces on the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/06/22/the_great_caspian_arms_race |title=The great Caspian arms race|periodical=Foreign Policy|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a [[treaty]] signed between Iran and the Soviet Union, the Caspian Sea is technically a lake and was divided into two sectors (Iranian and Soviet), but the resources (then mainly [[fish]]) were commonly shared. The line between the two sectors was considered an international border in a common lake, like [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Lake Albert]]. The Soviet sector was sub-divided into the four littoral republics' administrative sectors.

Russia, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan have bilateral agreements with each other based on [[median]] lines. Because of their use by the three nations, median lines seem to be the most likely method of delineating territory in future agreements. However, Iran insists on a single, multilateral agreement between the five nations (as this is the only way for it to achieve a one-fifth share of the sea). Azerbaijan is at odds with Iran over some [[oil field]]s that both states claim. Occasionally, Iranian patrol boats have fired at vessels sent by Azerbaijan for exploration into the disputed region. There are similar tensions between Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan (the latter claims that the former has pumped more oil than agreed from a field, recognized by both parties as shared).

The Caspian littoral states' meeting in 2007 signed an agreement that bars any ship not flying the national flag of a littoral state from entering the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brtsis.com/rrubbbb.htm |title=Russia Gets Way in Caspian Meet |accessdate=2007-10-28 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120180954/http://www.brtsis.com/rrubbbb.htm |archivedate=2008-01-20 |df= }}{{failed verification|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negotiations among the five littoral states have been ongoing, amidst ebbs and flows, for the past 20 years, with some degree of progress being made at the fourth Caspian Summit held in Astrakhan in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03071847.2015.1031525 |author=Nicola Contessi|title=Traditional Security in Eurasia: The Caspian caught between Militarisation and Diplomacy|periodical=The RUSI Journal|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caspian Summit===
The Caspian Summit is a head of state-level meeting of the five littoral states.&lt;ref name="summit"&gt;{{cite news |title=Five Leaders Attend Caspian Summit |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/caspian-summit-arrivals/29428780.html |agency=RadioFreeEurope RadioLiberty}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth Caspian Summit took place on August 12, 2018 in the Kazakh port city of Aktau. &lt;ref name="summit" /&gt; The five leaders signed the ‘Convention on the Legal Status of the Caspian Sea’.&lt;ref name="signed"&gt;{{cite news |title=Five states sign convention on legal status of Caspian Sea |url=https://www.sott.net/article/393330-Five-states-sign-convention-on-legal-status-of-Caspian-Sea |agency=SOTT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Convention on the Legal Status of the Caspian Sea===
{{main|Convention on the legal status of the Caspian Sea}}
The five littoral states build consensus on legally binding governance of the Caspian Sea through Special Working Groups of a Convention on the Legal Status of the Caspian Sea.&lt;ref name="convlegalstatus"&gt;{{cite web |title=Are the Littoral States Close to Signing an Agreement on the Legal Status of the Caspian Sea? |url=https://jamestown.org/program/littoral-states-close-signing-agreement-legal-status-caspian-sea/ |publisher=The Jamestown Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In advance of a Caspian Summit, 51st Special Working Group took place in Astana in May 2018 and found consensus on multiple agreements: Agreements on cooperation in the field of transport; trade and economic cooperation; prevention of incidents on the sea; combating terrorism; fighting against organized crime; and border security cooperation.&lt;ref name="51agreement"&gt;{{cite web |title=The working group agreed on the provisional agenda of the Caspian summit and the draft of final document |url=http://caspianbarrel.org/en/2018/05/the-working-group-agreed-on-the-provisional-agenda-of-the-caspian-summit-and-the-draft-of-final-document/ |website=caspianbarrel.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention grants jurisdiction over 15 miles of territorial waters to each neighboring country, plus additional 10 miles of exclusive fishing rights on the surface, while the rest is [[international waters]]. The seabed, on the other hand, remains undefined, subject to bilateral agreements between countries. Thus, the Caspian Sea is legally neither fully a sea nor a lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2018/08/16/is-the-caspian-a-sea-or-a-lake |title=Is the Caspian a sea or a lake? |date=2018-08-16 |work=[[The Economist]] |accessdate=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crossborder inflow===
[[UNECE]] recognizes several rivers that cross international borders which flow into the Caspian Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/env/water/blanks/assessment/caspian.pdf |title=Drainage basing of the Caspian Sea|publisher=unece.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
Although the Caspian Sea is [[endorheic]], its main tributary, the [[Volga]], is connected by important shipping canals [[Volga–Don Canal|with the Don River]] (and thus the Black Sea) and [[Volga–Baltic Waterway|with the Baltic Sea]], with branch canals [[Northern Dvina Canal|to Northern Dvina]] and [[White Sea–Baltic Canal|to the White Sea]].

Another Caspian tributary, the [[Kuma River (Russia)|Kuma River]], is connected by [[Kuma–Manych Canal|an irrigation canal]] with the Don basin as well.

Several scheduled [[ferry]] services (including [[Train ferry|train ferries]]) operate on the Caspian Sea, including:
* a line between [[Türkmenbaşy, Turkmenistan|Türkmenbaşy]], [[Turkmenistan]], (formerly Krasnovodsk) and [[Baku]].
* a ferry line between Baku and [[Aktau]].
* several ferry lines between cities in [[Iran]] and [[Russia]].

The ferries are mostly used for cargo; only the Baku–Aktau and Baku–Türkmenbaşy routes accept passengers.

===Canals===
As an [[endorheic basin]], the Caspian Sea basin has no natural connection with the ocean. Since the medieval period, traders reached the Caspian via a number of [[portage]]s that connected the Volga and its tributaries with the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] (which flows into the [[Sea of Azov]]) and various rivers that flow into the [[Baltic Sea]]. [[Volga–Baltic Waterway#History|Primitive canals]] connecting the Volga Basin with the Baltic have been constructed as early as the early 18th century. Since then, a number of canal projects have been completed.

The two modern canal systems that connect the Volga Basin, and hence the Caspian Sea, with the ocean are the [[Volga–Baltic Waterway]] and the [[Volga–Don Canal]].

The proposed [[Pechora–Kama Canal]] was a project that was widely discussed between the 1930s and 1980s. Shipping was a secondary consideration. Its main goal was to [[Northern river reversal|redirect some of the water]] of the [[Pechora River]] (which flows into the Arctic Ocean) via the [[Kama River]] into the Volga. The goals were both irrigation and the stabilization of the water level in the Caspian, which was thought to be falling dangerously fast at the time. During 1971, some [[peaceful nuclear explosion|peaceful nuclear construction experiments]] were carried out in the region by the U.S.S.R.

In June 2007, in order to boost his oil-rich country's access to markets, [[Kazakhstan]]'s President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] proposed a {{convert|700|km|0|abbr=off|adj=on}} link between the Caspian Sea and the [[Black Sea]]. It is hoped that the "[[Eurasia Canal]]" ([[Manych Ship Canal]]) would transform landlocked Kazakhstan and other Central Asian countries into maritime states, enabling them to significantly increase trade volume. Although the canal would traverse Russian territory, it would benefit Kazakhstan through its Caspian Sea ports. The most likely route for the canal, the officials at the Committee on Water Resources at Kazakhstan's Agriculture Ministry say, would follow the [[Kuma–Manych Depression]], where currently a chain of rivers and lakes is already connected by an irrigation canal ([[Kuma–Manych Canal]]). Upgrading the Volga–Don Canal would be another option.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/jul2007/gb2007079_528939.htm Caspian Canal Could Boost Kazakh Trade] ''[[Business Week]]'' (2007-07-09)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''chilling requirement''' of a fruit is the minimum period of cold [[weather]] after which a [[fruit-bearing tree]] will [[blossom]].  It is often expressed in chill hours, which can be calculated in different ways, all of which essentially involve adding up the total amount of time in a winter spent at certain temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://etweather.tamu.edu/chill/ | publisher = Texas A&amp;M University Agricultural Research &amp; Extension Center at Overton | title = Chilling hours}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ent.uga.edu/peach/peachhbk/pdf/physiology.pdf | title = Peach tree physiology | author = David W. Lockwood and D. C. Coston | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100610090104/http://www.ent.uga.edu/peach/peachhbk/pdf/physiology.pdf | archivedate = 2010-06-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some bulbs have chilling requirements to bloom, and some seeds have chilling requirements to sprout.

Biologically, the chilling requirement is a way of ensuring that [[vernalization]] occurs.

== Chilling units or chilling hours ==
A ''chilling unit'' in [[agriculture]] is a metric of a plant's exposure to chilling temperatures. Chilling temperatures extend from [[Melting point|freezing point]] to, depending on the model, {{convert|45|F|C|order=flip}} or even {{convert|60|°F|°C|order=flip}}.&lt;ref name=BB&gt;Byrne, D. H., and T. A. Bacon (1992). ''[http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/stonefruit/chillacc.html Chilling estimation: its importance and estimation]''. The Texas Horticulturist 18(8):5, 8-9. Retrieved 2010-05-24.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Drupe|Stone fruit]] trees and certain other plants of [[Temperateness|temperate climate]] develop next year's [[bud]]s in the summer. In the autumn the buds become [[dormancy|dormant]], and the switch to proper, healthy dormancy is triggered by a certain minimum exposure to chilling temperatures. Lack of such exposure results in delayed and substandard foliation, flowering and fruiting. One chilling unit, in the simplest models, is equal to one hour's exposure to the chilling temperature; these units are summed up for a whole season. Advanced models assign different weights to different temperature bands.

==Requirements==

According to Fishman, chilling in trees acts in two stages. The first is reversible: chilling helps to build up the [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] to dormancy, but the process can be easily reversed with a rise in temperature. After the level of precursor reaches a certain threshold, dormancy becomes irreversible and will not be affected by short-term warm temperature peaks.&lt;ref name=SO/&gt; [[Apple]]s have the highest chilling requirements of all fruit trees, followed by [[apricot]]s and, lastly, [[peach]]es. Apple [[cultivar]]s have a diverse range of permissible minimum chilling: most have been bred for temperate weather, but ''[[Gala (apple)|Gala]]'' and ''[[Fuji (apple)|Fuji]]'' can be successfully grown in subtropical [[Bakersfield, California]].&lt;ref name=H87&gt;Hall, Anthony (2001). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vmNKZ4t7mH8C Crop responses to environment]''. CRC Press. {{ISBN|0-8493-1028-8}}. p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peach cultivars in [[Texas]] range in their requirements from 100 chilling units (''Florida Grande'' cultivar, zoned for low chill regions) to 1,000 units (''Surecrop'', zoned for high chill regions).&lt;ref name=KA&gt;Kamas, J.; McEachern, J. R; Stein, L.; Roe, N. (1998). ''[http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/extension/peach/peach.html Peach Production in Texas]'', table 1. Texas A&amp;M University. Retrieved 2010-05-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Planting a low-chilling cultivar in a high-chill region risks loss of a year's harvest when an early bloom is hit by a spring frost.&lt;ref name=KA/&gt; A high-chilling cultivar planted in a low-chill region will, quite likely, never fruit at all. A four-year study of ''Ruston Red'' [[Alabama]] peach, which has a threshold of 850 chilling units, demonstrated that a seasonal chilling deficiency of less than 50 units has no effect on harvest. Deficiency of 50 to 100 units may result in loss of up to 50% of expected harvest. Deficiency of 250 hours and more is a sure loss of practically whole harvest; the few fruit will be of very poor quality and have no market value.&lt;ref name=PO&gt;Powell, A. (1999). ''[http://www.aces.edu/dept/peaches/peachdormex.html Action Program for Dormex Application on Peaches]''. [[Auburn University]]. Retrieved 2010-05-24.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rest-breaking agent]]s (e.g. [[cyanamide|hydrogen cyanamide]], trade name ''BudPro or Dormex''), applied in spring, can partially mitigate the effects of insufficient chilling. BudPro can substitute for up to 300 hours of chilling, but an excessive spraying and timing error can easily damage the buds.&lt;ref name=PO/&gt;
Other products such as Dormex use stabilizing compounds.

Chilling of [[Orange (fruit)|orange trees]] has two effects. First, it increases production of [[carotenoid]]s and decreases [[chlorophyll]] content of the fruit, improving their appearance and, ultimately, their market value. Second, the "quasi-dormancy" experienced by orange trees triggers concentrated flowering in spring, as opposed to more or less uniform round-the-year flowering and fruiting in warmer climates.&lt;ref name=H87/&gt;

[[Biennial plant]]s like [[cabbage]], [[sugar beet]], [[celery]] and [[carrot]]s need chilling to develop second-year flowering buds. Excessive chilling in the early stages of a sugar beet seedling, on the contrary, may trigger undesired growth of a flowering stem ([[Bolting (horticulture)|bolting]]) in its first year. This phenomenon has been offset by breeding sugar beet cultivars with a higher minimum chilling threshold. Such cultivars can be seeded earlier than normal without the risk of bolting.&lt;ref name=H87/&gt;

==Models==

All models require hourly recording of temperatures.&lt;ref name=SO/&gt; The simplest model assigns one chilling unit for every full hour at temperatures below {{convert|45|F|C|order=flip}}. A slightly more sophisticated model excludes freezing temperatures, which do not contribute to proper dormancy cycle, and counts only hours with temperatures between {{convert|32|F|C|order=flip}} and {{convert|45|F|C|order=flip}}.&lt;ref name=BB/&gt;
 
The Utah model assigns different weight to different temperature bands; a full unit per hour is assigned only to temperatures between {{convert|37|F|C|order=flip}} and {{convert|48|F|C|order=flip}}. Maximum effect is achieved at {{convert|7|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=SO/&gt; Temperatures between {{convert|55|F|C|order=flip}} and {{convert|60|F|C|order=flip}} (the threshold between chilling and warm weather) have zero weight, and higher temperature have negative weights: they reduce the beneficial effects of an already accumulated chilling hours.&lt;ref name=BB/&gt;

Southwick et al. wrote that neither of these models is accurate enough to account for application of [[rest-breaking agent]]s widely used in modern farming. They advocated the use of a dynamic model tailored to the two-stage explanation of dormancy.&lt;ref name=SO&gt;Southwick, S.; Khan, Z.; Glozer, K. (2003).

'''Counter-mapping''' refers to efforts to [[map]] "against dominant power structures, to further seemingly progressive goals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hodgson|first=D.L|author2=Schroeder, R.A.|title=Dilemmas of Counter-Mapping: Community Resources in Tanzania|journal=Development and Change|year=2002|volume=33|pages=79–100|doi=10.1111/1467-7660.00241}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by Nancy Peluso&lt;ref name="Peluso"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peluso|first=N.L|title=Whose Woods are These? Counter-Mapping Forest Territories in Kalimantan, Indonesia|journal=Antipode|year=1995|volume=27|series=4|pages=383–406|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8330.1995.tb00286.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1995 to describe the commissioning of maps by forest users in [[Kalimantan]], [[Indonesia]], as a means of contesting state maps of forest areas that typically undermined [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] interests. The resultant counter-hegemonic maps had the ability to strengthen forest users' resource claims.&lt;ref name=Peluso /&gt; There are numerous expressions closely related to counter-mapping: ethnocartography, alternative cartography, mapping-back, counter-hegemonic mapping, and public participatory mapping.&lt;ref name=Rundstrom /&gt; Moreover, the terms: [[critical cartography]], subversive cartography, bio-regional mapping, and remapping are sometimes used interchangeably with counter-mapping, but in practice encompass much more.&lt;ref name=Rundstrom /&gt;

Whilst counter-mapping still primarily refers to indigenous cartographic efforts, it is increasingly being applied to non-indigenous [[map]]ping initiatives in economically developed countries.&lt;ref name=Rundstrom /&gt; Such counter-mapping efforts have been facilitated by processes of [[neoliberalism]],&lt;ref name="Bryan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bryan|first=J|title=Walking the Line: Participatory Mapping Indigenous Rights, and Neoliberalism|journal=Geoforum|year=2011|volume=42|issue=1|pages=40–50|doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2010.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and technological [[democratisation]].&lt;ref name=Peluso /&gt; Examples of counter-mapping include attempts to demarcate and protect traditional territories, community mapping, [[PPGIS|Public Participatory Geographical Information Systems]], and [[map]]ping by a relatively weak state to counter the resource claims of a stronger state.&lt;ref name="Bauer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bauer|first=K|title=On the Politics and Possibilities of Participatory Mapping and GIS: Using Spatial Technologies to Study Common Property and Land Use Change Among Pastoralists in Central Tibet|journal=Cultural Geographies|year=2009|volume=16|pages=229–252|doi=10.1177/1474474008101518}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power of counter-maps to advocate policy change in a [[Top-down and bottom-up design#Management and organization|bottom-up]] manner led commentators to affirm that counter-mapping should be viewed as a tool of [[governance]].&lt;ref name=Alcorn /&gt;

Despite its emancipatory potential, counter-mapping has not gone without criticism. There is a tendency for counter-mapping efforts to overlook the knowledge of women, minorities, and other vulnerable, disenfranchised groups.&lt;ref name="Rocheleau"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rocheleau|first=D.B|author2=Edmunds, D|title=Women, Men and Trees: Gender, Power and Property in Forest and Agrarian Landscapes.|journal=World Development|year=1997|volume=25|series=8|pages=1351–1371|doi=10.1016/s0305-750x(97)00036-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, counter-mapping is only empowering for a small subset of society, whilst others become further marginalised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=King|first=B.H|title=Community Participation and Geographic Information Systems|journal=The Professional Geographer|year=2004|volume=56|series=2|pages=315–317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

Nancy Peluso, professor of forest policy, coined the term 'counter-mapping' in 1995, having examined the implementation of two forest [[map]]ping strategies in [[Kalimantan]]. One set of maps belonged to state forest managers, and the [[international financial institutions]] that supported them, such as the [[World Bank]]. This strategy recognised mapping as a means of protecting local claims to territory and resources to a government that had previously ignored them.&lt;ref name=Peluso /&gt; The other set of maps had been created by Indonesian [[NGOs]], who often contract international experts to assist with mapping village territories.&lt;ref name=Peluso /&gt; The goal of the second set of maps was to co-opt the cartographic conventions of the Indonesian state, to legitimise the claims by the [[Dayak people|Dayak]] people, indigenous to Kalimantan, to the rights to forest use.&lt;ref name=Rundstrom /&gt;  Counter-mappers in Kalimantan have acquired [[GIS]] technologies, satellite technology, and computerised [[resource management]] tools, consequently  making the Indonesian state vulnerable to counter-maps.&lt;ref name=Peluso /&gt; As such, counter-mapping strategies in Kalimantan have led to successful community action to block, and protest against, oil palm plantations and logging concessions imposed by the central government.&lt;ref name=Peluso /&gt;

It must, however, be recognised that counter-mapping projects existed long before coinage of the term.&lt;ref name="Rundstrom"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rundstrom|first=R|title=Counter-Mapping|journal=International Encyclopaedia of Human Geography|year=2009|pages=314–318}}&lt;/ref&gt; Counter-maps are rooted in map art practices that date to the early 20th century; in the [[Mental mapping|mental maps]] movement of the 1960s; in indigenous and bioregional mapping; and parish mapping.&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=D|title=Rethinking the Power of Maps|year=2010|publisher=Guilford Press|location=London |author2=Fels, J. |author3=Krygier, J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parish Maps Project ===

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Parish Map.jpg|thumb|right|text-top|border|alt=Salle parish map.|Salle parish map.]] --&gt;In 1985, the charity [[Common Ground (United Kingdom)|Common Ground]] launched the [[Parish Maps Project]], a [[Top-down and bottom-up design#Management and organization|bottom-up]] initiative encouraging local people to map elements of the environment valued by their [[parish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=A|title=Holding Your Ground: An Action Guide to Local Conservation|year=1985|publisher=Penguin|location=London|author2=Clifford, S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, more than 2,500 English parishes have made such maps.&lt;ref name=Wood /&gt; Parish mapping projects aim to put every local person in an 'expert' role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aberley|first=D|title=Boundaries of Home: Mapping for Local Empowerment|year=1993|publisher=New Society Publishers|location=Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clifford&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clifford|first=S|title=From Place to Place: Maps and Parish Maps|year=1996|publisher=Common Ground|location=London|pages=3–7|editor=Clifford, S. |editor2=King, A.|chapter=Places, People, and Parish Maps}}&lt;/ref&gt; exemplifies this notion, affirming: "making a parish map is about creating a community expression of values, and about beginning to assert ideas for involvement. It is about taking the place in your own hands". The final map product is typically an artistic artefact, usually painted, and often displayed in village halls or schools.&lt;ref name=perkins /&gt;  By questioning the biases of cartographic conventions and challenging predominant power effects of mapping,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harris|first=L.M|author2=Hazen, H.D|title=Power of Maps: (Counter) Mapping for Conservation|journal=ACME|year=2006|volume=4|issue=1|pages=99–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Parish Maps Project is an early example of what Peluso&lt;ref name=Peluso /&gt; went on to term 'counter-mapping'

== Development ==

=== Neoliberalism ===
The development of counter-mapping can be situated within the [[neoliberal]] political-economic restructuring of the state.&lt;ref name=Leszcynski /&gt; Prior to the 1960s, equipping a map-making enterprise was chiefly the duty of a single agency, funded by the national government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodchild|first=M,F|title=Virtual Geographic Environments as Collective Constructions|url=http://www.iseis.cuhk.edu.hk/downloads/vge/44.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2011|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, maps have conventionally been the products of privileged knowledges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harley|first=J.B|title=Deconstructing the Map|journal=Cartographica|year=1989|volume=26|issue=2|pages=1–20|doi=10.3138/e635-7827-1757-9t53}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, processes of [[neoliberalism]], predominantly since the late 1970s, have reconfigured the state's role in the cartographic project.&lt;ref name=Bryan /&gt; Neoliberalism denotes an emphasis on markets and minimal states, whereby individual choice is perceived to have replaced the mass-production of commodities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larner|first=W|title=Neoliberalism|year=2009|journal=International Encyclopaedia of Human Geography|pages=374–378}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that citizens are now performing cartographic functions that were once exclusively state-controlled can be partially explained through a shift from "roll-back neoliberalism", in which the state dismantled some of its functions, to "roll-out neoliberalism", in which new modes of operating have been constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peck|first=L|author2=Tickell,A|title=Neoliberalizing Space|journal=Antipode|year=2002|volume=34|pages=380–404|doi=10.1111/1467-8330.00247}}&lt;/ref&gt; In brief, the state can be seen to have "hollowed out" and delegated some of its [[map]]ping power to citizens.&lt;ref name="Jessop"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jessop|first=H|title=A Handbook of Comparative Social Policy|year=2004|publisher=Edward Elgar|location=Cheltenham|pages=11–27|editor=Kennett, P|chapter=Hollowing out the 'Nation-State' and Multi-Level Governance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Counter-mapping as Neoliberal Governmentality ====
[[Governmentality]] refers to a particular form of state power that is exercised when citizens self-discipline by acquiescing to state knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=M|author2=Knopp, L|title=Places and Polygons? Governmentality, Scale, and the Census in the Gay and Lesbian Atlas|year=2006|journal=Population, Space and Place|volume=12|pages=223–242|doi=10.1002/psp.410}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, [[cartography]] has been a fundamental governmentality strategy,&lt;ref name="Crampton"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crampton|first=J|title=Mapping: A Critical Introduction to Cartography and GIS|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; a technology of power, used for surveillance and control.&lt;ref name="McCarthy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCarthy|first=J|title=Theorizing the State in Environmental Governance|journal=Review of International Political Economy|year=2006|volume=14|issue=1|pages=176–194|doi=10.1080/09692290601081244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Competing claimants and boundaries made no appearance on state-led maps.&lt;ref name=McCarthy /&gt; This links to [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s&lt;ref name="Foucault"&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=M|title=Power/Knowledge: Selected Interviews and Other Writings:1972-1977|year=1988|publisher=Randon House|location=Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; notion of "subjugated knowledges" - ones that did not rise to the top, or were disqualified.&lt;ref name=Crampton /&gt; However, through neoliberalising processes, the state has retracted from performing some of its cartographic functions.&lt;ref name="Leszcynski"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leszcynski|first=A|title=Situating the Geoweb in Political Economy|journal=Progress in Human Geography|year=2011|pages=1–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, rather than being passive recipients of top-down map distribution, people now have the opportunity to claim sovereignty over the mapping process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dodge|first=M|author2=Perkins, P|title=Reclaiming the Map: British Geography and Ambivalent cartographic Practice|journal=Environment and Planning A|year=2008|volume=40|issue=6|pages=|doi=10.1068/a4172}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this new regime of neoliberal cartographic governmentality the "insurrection of subjugated knowledges" occurs,&lt;ref name=Foucault /&gt; as counter-mapping initiatives incorporate previously marginalised voices.

=== Technological democratisation? ===
In response to technological change, predominantly since the 1980s, cartography has increasingly been democratised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rood|first=J |author2=Ormeling, F. |author3=van Elzakker, C|title=An Agenda for Democratising Cartographic Visualisation|journal=[[Norwegian Journal of Geography]]|volume=55|issue=1|pages=38–41|doi=10.1080/002919501300061427}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wide availability of high-quality location information has enabled mass-market cartography based on [[Global Positioning System]] receivers, home computers, and the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haklay|first=M|author2=Weber, P|title=OpenStreetMap: User-Generated Street Maps|journal=Pervasive Computing|year=2008|volume=1536|pages=12–18|doi=10.1109/mprv.2008.80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that civilians are using technologies which were once elitist led Brosius ''et al''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bosius|first=P.J|title=Communities and Conservation: Histories and Politics of Community-Based Natural Resource Management|year=2005|publisher=Rowman Altamira|location=London |author2=Tsing, A.L. |author3=Zerner, C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; to assert that counter-mapping involves "stealing the master's tools". Nevertheless, numerous early counter-mapping projects successfully utilised manual techniques, and many still use them. For instance, in recent years, the use of simple sketch mapping approaches has been revitalised, whereby maps are made on the ground, using natural materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poole|first=P|title=Geomatics: Who Needs it?|journal=Cultural Survival Quarterly|year=1995|volume=18|issue=4|pages=1–77}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the use of scale model constructions and felt boards, as means of representing cartographic claims of different groups, have become increasingly popular.&lt;ref name=Rocheleau /&gt; Consequently, [[Denis Wood|Wood]] ''et al.''&lt;ref name=Wood /&gt; assert that counter-mappers can "make gateau out of technological crumbs".

==== Public Participation Geographical Information Systems ====
In recent years, [[Public Participation Geographical Information Systems]] (PPGIS) have attempted to take the power of the map out of the hands of the cartographic elite, putting it into the hands of the people. For instance, Kyem&lt;ref name="Kyem"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kyem|first=K|title=Promoting Local Community Participation in Forest Management Through the Application of a Geographical Information System: A PPGIS Experience from Southern Ghana|url=http://www.ncgia.ucsb.edu/varenius/ppgis/papers/kyem/kyem.html|accessdate=2011|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed a PPGIS method termed Exploratory Strategy for Collaboration, Management, Allocation, and Planning (ESCMAP). The method sought to integrate the concerns and experiences of three rural communities in the Ashanti Region of Ghana into official [[forest management]] practices.&lt;ref name=Kyem /&gt; Kyem&lt;ref name=Kyem /&gt; concluded that, notwithstanding  the potential of PPGIS, it is possible that the majority of the rich and powerful people in the area would object to some of the participatory uses of [[GIS]]. For example, loggers in Ghana affirmed that the PPGIS procedures were too open and democratic.&lt;ref name=Kyem /&gt; Thus, despite its democratising potential, there are barriers to its implementation. More recently, [[Denis Wood|Wood]] ''et al''.&lt;ref name=Wood /&gt;  disputed the notion of PPGIS entirely, affirming that it is "scarcely [[GIS]], intensely hegemonic, hardly public, and anything but participatory".

== Counter-mapping as governance ==
[[Governance]] makes problematic state-centric notions of regulation, recognising that there has been a shift to power operating across several [[spatial scales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bridge|first=G|title=A Companion to Environmental Geography|year=2009|author2=Perreault, T|editor=Castree, N.M |editor2=Demeritt, D. |editor3=Liverman, D. |editor4=Rhoads, B|pages=475–497|chapter=Environmental Governance}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, counter-mapping complicates state distribution of [[cartography]], advocating [[Top-down and bottom-up design#Management and organization|bottom-up]] participatory mapping projects (see [[GIS and environmental governance]]). Counter-mapping initiatives, often without state assistance, attempt to exert power. As such, counter-mapping conforms to [[Bob Jessop|Jessop]]'s&lt;ref name=Jessop /&gt; notion of "governance without government". Another characteristic of governance is its "purposeful effort to steer, control or manage sectors or facets of society" towards a common goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kooiman|first=J|title=Modern Governance. New Government-Society Interactions|year=1993|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, as maps exude power and authority,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Colchester|first=M|title=Communities and Conservation: Histories and Politics of Community-Based Natural Resource Management|year=2005|publisher=Rowman Altamira|location=London|pages=271–304|editor=Brosius, P.J. |editor2=Tsing, A.L. |editor3=Zerner, C|chapter=Maps, Power, and the Defense of Territory: The Upper Mazarini Land Claim in Guyana}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are a trusted medium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Markham|first=B|title=West with the Night|year=1983|publisher=North Point Press|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the ability to 'steer' society in a particular direction. In brief, [[cartography]], once the tool of kings and governments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=D|title=The Power of Maps|year=1992|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; is now being used as a tool of governance - to advocate policy change from the [[grassroots]].&lt;ref name="Alcorn"&gt;{{cite book|last=Alcorn|first=J.B|title=Borders, Rules and Governance: Mapping to Catalyse Changes in Policy and Management|year=2000|publisher=Gatekeeper Series|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The environmental sphere is one context in which counter-mapping has been utilised as a governance tool.&lt;ref name=Alcorn /&gt;

=== Counter-mapping as environmental governance ===
In contrast to expert knowledges, lay knowledges are increasingly valuable to decision-makers, in part due to the scientific uncertainty surrounding environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=J|title=Environmental Governance|year=2012|publisher=Taylor Francis|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Participatory]] counter-mapping projects are an effective means of incorporating lay knowledges&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Narayan|first=P|title=Empowerment through Participation: How Effective is this Approach?|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|year=2003|volume=38|issue=25|pages=21–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; into issues surrounding [[environmental governance]]. For instance, counter-maps depicting traditional use of areas now protected for biodiversity have been used to allow resource use, or to promote public debate about the issue, rather than forcing relocation.&lt;ref name=Alcorn /&gt; For example, the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] used the results of counter-mapping to advocate for the reclassification of several strictly protected areas into Indonesian national parks, including Kayan Mentarang and Gunung Lorentz.&lt;ref name=Alcorn /&gt; The success of such counter-mapping efforts led Alcorn&lt;ref name=Alcorn /&gt;  to affirm that [[governance]] ([[grassroots]] mapping projects), rather than government ([[wikt:top-down|top-down]] map distribution), offers the best hope for good [[natural resource management]]. In short, it can be seen that "maps are powerful political tools in ecological and governance discussions".&lt;ref name=Alcorn /&gt;

== Types of counter-mapping ==
Numerous counter-mapping types exist, for instance: protest maps, map art, counter-mapping for conservation, and [[PPGIS]]. In order to emphasise the wide scope of what has come to be known as counter-mapping, three contrasting counter-mapping examples are elucidated in this section: indigenous counter-mapping, community mapping, and state counter-mapping, respectively.

=== Indigenous counter-mapping ===
Counter-mapping has been undertaken most in the Third World.&lt;ref name="perkins"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perkins|first=C|title=Community Mapping|journal=The Cartographic Journal|volume=44|issue=2|pages=127–137|doi=10.1179/000870407x213440}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indigenous peoples]] are increasingly turning to [[participatory]] mapping, appropriating both the state's techniques and manner of representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wainwright|first=J|author2=Bryan, J|title=Cartography, Territory, Property: Postcolonial Reflections on Indigenous Counter-Mapping in Nicaragua and Belize|journal=Cultural Geographies|year=2009|volume=16|pages=153–187|doi=10.1177/1474474008101515}}&lt;/ref&gt; Counter-mapping is a tool for indigenous identity-building,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=J.J|title=Naming the Land: San Countermapping in Namibia's West Caprivi|journal=Geoforum|year=2008|volume=39|issue=5|pages=1766–1775|doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2008.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for bolstering the legitimacy of customary resource claims.&lt;ref name=Peluso /&gt; The success of counter-mapping in realising indigenous claims can be seen through Nietschmann's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neitschmann|first=B|title=Defending the Misiko Reefs with Maps and GIS: Mapping with Sail, Scuba and Satellite|journal=Cultural Survival Quarterly|year=1995|volume=18|issue=4|pages=34–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; assertion:
{{quote box |quote = ''More indigenous territory has been claimed by maps than by guns. And more Indigenous territory can be reclaimed and defended by maps than by guns.''
|align  = left
|bgcolor =#FFF8E7
 |quoted = 1
}}
{{clear}}

==== Creation of Nunavut ====
The power of indigenous counter-mapping can be exemplified through the creation of [[Nunavut]]. In 1967, [[Frank Arthur Calder]] and the Nisaga'a Nation Tribal Council brought an action against the [[Province of British Columbia]] for a declaration that [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal]] title to specified land had not been lawfully extinguished. In 1973, the [[Canadian Supreme Court]] found that there was, in fact, an aboriginal title. The Canadian government attempted to extinguish such titles by negotiating [[treaties]] with the people who had not signed them.&lt;ref name=Wood /&gt; As a first step, the [[Inuit Tapirisat of Canada]] studied [[Inuit]] land occupancy in the Arctic, resulting in the publication of the ''Inuit Land Use and Occupancy Project''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=M.M.R|title=Land Use and Occupancy, Vol. 1 of Inuit Land Use and Occupancy Project Report|year=1976|location=Ottawa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diverse interests, such as those of hunters, trappers, fishermen and berry-pickers mapped out the land they had used during their lives.&lt;ref name=Wood /&gt; As Usher&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Usher|first=P.J|title=Environment, Race and Nation Reconsidered: Reflections on Aboriginal Land Claims in Canada|journal=Canadian Geographer|year=2003|volume=47|issue=4|pages=365–382|doi=10.1111/j.0008-3658.2003.00029.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted:

{{quote box |quote = ''We were no longer mapping the 'territories' of Aboriginal people based on the cumulative observations of others of where they were…but instead, mapping the Aboriginal peoples’ own recollections of their own activities''.
|align  = left
|bgcolor =#FFF8E7
 |quoted = 1
}}

These maps played a fundamental role in the negotiations that enabled the Inuit to assert an aboriginal title to the 2 million km² in Canada, today known as Nunavut.&lt;ref name=Wood /&gt; Evidently, counter-mapping is a tool by which indigenous groups can re-present the world in ways which destabilise dominant representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kwan|first=M|title=Feminist Visualisation: Re-Envisioning GIS as a Method in Feminist Geographic Research|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|volume=92|issue=4|pages=645–661|doi=10.1111/1467-8306.00309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Community mapping ===
[[Community]] mapping can be defined as: "local mapping, produced collaboratively, by local people and often incorporating alternative
local knowledge".&lt;ref name=perkins /&gt; [http://www.openstreetmap.org/ OpenStreetMap] is an example of a community mapping initiative, with the potential to counter the hegemony of state-dominated map distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elwood|first=S|title=Citizen Cartographies and the Shifting Politics of Expertise. Paper Presented at the 24th Annual International Cartography Conference|year=2009|location=Santiago, Chile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== OpenStreetMap ====
[[File:OpenStreetMap homepage 2018 en.png|thumb|"border"text-topalt=OpenStreetMap home page.|OpenStreetMap home page.]]
[[OpenStreetMap]] (OSM), a citizen-led spatial data collection website, was founded by [[Steve Coast]] in 2004. Data are collected from diverse public domain sources; of which [[GPS]] tracks are the most important, collected by volunteers with GPS receivers.&lt;ref name=perkins /&gt;  {{as of|2011|January|10}} there were 340,522 registered OSM users, who had uploaded 2.121 billion GPS points onto the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perkins, C|title=Review OSM: Using and Enhancing the Free Map of the World by Ramm, F., Topf, J and Chilton, S.|year=2011|publisher=(in press)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of map creation explicitly relies upon sharing and participation; consequently, every registered OSM user can edit any part of the map. Moreover, 'map parties' - social events which aim to fill gaps in coverage, help foster a community ethos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perkins|first=C|author2=Dodge, M|title=The Potential of User-Generated Cartography: A Case Study of the OpenStreetMap Project and Mapchester Mapping Party|journal=North West Geography|year=2008|volume=8|issue=1|pages=19–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, the [[grassroots]] OSM project can be seen to represent a [[paradigm shift]] in who creates and shares geographic information - from the state, to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elwood|first=S |author2=Goodchild, M.F |author3=Sui, D.Z|title=Researching VGI: Spatial Data, Geographic Research and New Social Practice|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|year=2011|pages=1–20|doi=10.1080/00045608.2011.595657}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, rather than countering the state-dominated cartographic project, some commentators have affirmed that OSM merely replicates the 'old' socio-economic order.&lt;ref name="Haklay"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haklay|first=M|title=How Good is Volunteered Geographical Information? A Comparative Study of OpenStreetMap and Ordnance Survey Datasets|journal=Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design|year=2008|volume=37|pages=682–703|doi=10.1068/b35097}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Haklay&lt;ref name=Haklay /&gt; affirmed that OSM users in the United Kingdom tend not to map council estates; consequently, middle-class areas are disproportionately mapped. Thus, in opposition to notions that OSM is a radical cartographic counter-culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kent|first=A.J|title=Cartographic Blandscapes and the New Noise: Finding the Good View in a Topographical Mashup|journal=SoC Bulletin|year=2008|volume=42|pages=29–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; are contentions that OSM "simply recreates a mirror copy of existing [[topographic mapping]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dodge|first=M|title=Rethinking Maps: New Frontiers in Cartographic Theory|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=London |author2=Perkins, C. |author3=Kitchin, R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State counter-mapping ===
What has come to be known as counter-mapping is not limited to the activities of [[Stateless nation|non-state]] actors within a particular nation-state; relatively weak states also engage in counter-mapping in an attempt to challenge other states.&lt;ref name="Nevins"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nevins|first=J|title=Contesting the Boundaries of International Justice: State Countermapping and Offshore Resource Struggles Between East-Timor and Australia|journal=Economic Geography|year=2004|volume=80|issue=1|pages=470–484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Competing cartographic representations: East Timor versus Australia ====
[[East Timor]]'s on-going effort to gain control of gas and oil resources from Australia, which it perceives at its own, is a form of counter-mapping. This dispute involves a cartographic contestation of Australia's mapping of the seabed resources between the two countries.&lt;ref name=Nevins /&gt; As Nevins&lt;ref name=Nevins /&gt; contends: whilst Australia's map is based on the status quo - a legacy of a 1989 agreement between Australia and the Indonesian occupier of East Timor at that time, East Timor's map represents an enlarged notion of what its sea boundaries should be, thereby entailing a redrawing of the map. This form of counter-mapping thus represents a claim by a relatively weak state, East Timor, to territory and resources that are controlled by a stronger state, Australia.&lt;ref name=Rundstrom /&gt; However, Nevins&lt;ref name=Nevins /&gt; notes that there is limited potential of realising a claim through East Timor's counter-map: counter-mapping is an effective strategy only when combined with broader legal and political strategies.&lt;ref name=Nevins /&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Counter-mapping's claim to incorporate counter-knowledges, and thereby empower traditionally disempowered people, has not gone uncontested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turow|first=J|title=Playing Doctor: Television, Storytelling, and Medical Power|year=2010|publisher=The University of Michigan Press|location=Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sample of criticisms leveled at counter-mapping:

* Counter-mapping fails to recognise that community is a constantly shifting, fluid process, too often relying on a notion of community as bounded and fixed. As such, the process of mapping communicates and naturalises who does, and who does not, belong within particular boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kosek|first=J|title=Mapping Politics|journal=Quarterly Publication of the International Association for the Study of Common Property|year=1998|volume=45|pages=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Due to the power imbalance between [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] claims and those of the state, the language and tools of the dominant society must be used by those under its control. The process of using another's tools can change the ideas represented, resulting in a map of unpredictable quality.&lt;ref name=Rundstrom /&gt;
* Counter-mapping is in danger of becoming the 'thing to do'; a "magic bullet applied uncritically".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fox|first=J|title=Mapping Communities: Ethics, Values, Practice|year=2005|publisher=East-West Center|location=Hawaii |author2=Suryanata, K. |author3=Hershock, P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There is a geography to the success of counter-mapping. In Tibet, counter-mapping is of limited political utility as [[mapmaking]] is not enfranchised and cannot be scaled up, for instance, to settle legal battles over land tenure and resource rights through the regulatory offices of the state.&lt;ref name=Bauer /&gt;
* Counter-mapping projects utilising [[GIS]] require significant knowledge and [[computer literacy]] above that of lay individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milla|first=K.A |author2=Lorenzo, A. |author3=Brown,C|title=GIS, GPS, and Remote Sensing Technologies in Extension Services: Where to Start, What to Know|journal=Extension Journal|year=2005|volume=43|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Investment in specialised computers and software often results in prohibitive mapping costs for a large majority of local people, particularly in poor areas. As some groups prove more capable of adopting the technologies than others, counter-mapping projects can deepen divisions within communities along gender and economic lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Corbett|first=J.M |author2=Chaplin, L. |author3=Gibson, G.R|title=Indigenous Mapping|journal=International Encyclopaedia of Human Geography|year=2009|pages=377–382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To summarise, whilst counter-mapping has the potential to transform map-making from "a science of princes",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harley|first=J.B|title=Silences and Secrecy: The Hidden Agenda of Cartography in Early Modern Europe|journal=Imago Mundi, Ltd|year=1988|volume=40|pages=57–76|doi=10.1080/03085698808592639}}&lt;/ref&gt; the investment required to create a map with the ability to challenge state-produced cartography means that counter-mapping is unlikely to become a "science of the masses".&lt;ref name=Peluso /&gt;

'''Crane climbing''' is the act, usually illicit, of climbing a [[Crane (machine)|crane]]. It is a worldwide phenomenon that was said to be growing in popularity in the mid-2010s, in a category with the illicit climbing of skyscrapers and tall monuments.&lt;ref name="NgaboClimbingCranes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ngabo|first1=Gilbert|title=Toronto police advise people to stop climbing cranes|url=http://www.metronews.ca/news/toronto/2017/05/09/police-advise-people-to-stop-climbing-cranes.html|accessdate=12 June 2017|publisher=Metro|date=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UrbanClimbs"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barbero|first1=Michael|title=Council Seeks Harsher Penalty in Urban Climbs|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/27/nyregion/27climb.html?pa.=&amp;mcubz=2|accessdate=12 June 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=27 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Donataria''' system was the basic seigneurial administrative system employed in [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish Empire]]s, governed by a [[donatary]] (''[[donatário]]'').

{{main|Donatário}}
Unable to directly exercise the right of lordship over his lands or islands, the donatary was a means by which the king delegated his powers, with certain restrictions, in full confidence of his people. The grantee was responsible for the administration of their territory on behalf of the sovereign and the land considered the legal instrument that established this guarantee. The grantee had certain benefits, rights and obligations therein defined, with limited action in several fields, namely justice.

'''Environmental determinism''' (also known as '''climatic determinism''' or '''geographical determinism''') is the study of how the [[physical environment]] predisposes societies and states towards particular development trajectories. Nineteenth-century approaches held that climate and terrain largely determined human activity and psychology, and it was associated with institutionalized racism and [[eugenics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Semple|first1=Ellen Churchhill|title=Influences of Geographic Environment, on the Basis of Ratzel's System of Anthropo-Geography|date=1911|publisher=H. Holt &amp; Co.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars underscore that this approach supported [[colonialism]] and [[eurocentrism]], and devalued human agency in non-Western societies.&lt;ref name="Gilmartin, M. 2009 pp. 115-123"&gt;Gilmartin, M. (2009). "Colonialism/Imperialism". Key concepts in political geography (pp. 115–123). London: SAGE.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sluyter|first1=Ander|title=Neo-Environmental Determinism, Intellectual Damage Control, and Nature/Society Science|journal=Antipode-Blackwell|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jared Diamond]], [[Jeffrey Herbst]], [[Ian Morris (historian)|Ian Morris]], and other social scientists sparked a revival of the theory during the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. This "neo-environmental determinism" school of thought examines how geographic and ecological forces influence [[state-building]], [[economic development]], and [[institutions]].

==A history of thought==

===Classical and medieval periods===
Early theories of environmental determinism in [[Ancient China]], [[Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Rome]] suggested that environmental features completely determined the physical and intellectual qualities of whole societies. [[Guan Zhong]] (720–645 BC), an [[Spring and Autumn period|early]] chancellor in China, held that the qualities of major rivers shaped the character of surrounding peoples. Swift and twisting rivers made people "greedy, uncouth, and warlike".&lt;ref&gt;trans. Allyn Rickett (1998), in ''Guanzi: Political, Economic, and Philosophical Essays from Early China: A Study and Translation''. Volume II. Princeton University Press, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greek philosopher [[Hippocrates]] wrote a similar account in his treatise "Airs, Waters, Places".&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Isaac, ''The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity'' Princeton: Princeton University Press. 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers in the medieval [[Middle East]] also produced theories of environmental determinism. The [[Afro-Arab]] writer [[al-Jahiz]] argued that the [[skin color]] of people and livestock were determined by the water, soil, and heat of their environments. He compared the color of black [[basalt]] in the northern [[Najd]] to the skin color of the peoples living there to support his theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Conrad | first1 = Lawrence I. | year = 1982 | title = Taun and Waba: Conceptions of Plague and Pestilence in Early Islam | url = | journal = Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient | volume = 25 | issue = 3| pages = 268–307 [278] | doi=10.2307/3632188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn Khaldun]], the [[Sociology in medieval Islam|Arab sociologist]] and [[polymath]], similarly linked skin color to environmental factors. In his ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (1377), he wrote that black skin was due to the hot climate of [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and not due to African lineage. He thereby challenged [[Hamitic]] theories of race that held that the sons of [[Ham (son of Noah)]] were cursed with black skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title='Race', slavery and Islam in Maghribi Mediterranean thought: the question of the Haratin in Morocco|first=Chouki|last=El Hamel|journal=The Journal of North African Studies|volume=7|issue=3|year=2002|pages=29–52 [39–42]|doi=10.1080/13629380208718472}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many writings of Ibn Khaldun were translated during the colonial era in order to advance the colonial propaganda machine.&lt;ref&gt;Translation and the Colonial Imaginary: Ibn Khaldun Orientalist, by Abdelmajid Hannoum  © 2003 Wesleyan University. {{JSTOR|3590803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Khaldun believed that the physical environment influenced non-physical factors in addition to skin color. He argued that soil, climate, and food determined whether people were [[nomad]]ic or [[sedentism|sedentary]], and what customs and ceremonies they held. His writings may have influenced the later writings of [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] during the 18th century through the traveller [[Jean Chardin]], who travelled to Persia and described theories resembling those of Ibn Khaldun.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Spread of Ibn Khaldun's Ideas on Climate and Culture|author=Warren E. Gates|journal=[[Journal of the History of Ideas]]|volume=28|issue=3|date=July–September 1967|pages=415–422|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|jstor=2708627|doi=10.2307/2708627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western colonial period===
{{main article|Impact of Western European colonialism and colonisation}}
Environmental determinism has been widely criticized as a tool to legitimize [[colonialism]], [[racism]], and [[imperialism]] in [[Africa]], [[North America]], [[South America]], and [[Asia]].&lt;ref name="Gilmartin, M. 2009 pp. 115-123"/&gt; Environmental determinism enabled geographers to scientifically justify the supremacy of white European races and the naturalness of imperialism.&lt;ref name="Painter 2009, pg.177"&gt;Painter &amp; Jeffrey, "Political Geography", Sage Publications, 2009, pg.177.&lt;/ref&gt; The scholarship bolstered religious justifications and in some cases superseded them during the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="J.A. Campbell 1983"&gt;J.A. Campbell &amp; D.N. Livingstone, "Neo-Lemarckism and the Development of Geography in the United States and Great Britain," Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers 8 (1983): 278&lt;/ref&gt;

Many writers, including [[Thomas Jefferson]], supported and legitimized African colonization by arguing that tropical climates made the people uncivilized. Jefferson argued that tropical climates encouraged laziness, relaxed attitudes, promiscuity and generally degenerative societies, while the frequent variability in the weather of the middle and northern latitudes led to stronger work ethics and civilized societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jefferson|first1=Thomas|editor1-last=Gates|editor1-first=Henry Louis|editor2-last=Burton|editor2-first=Jennifer|title=Call and Response: Key Debates in African American Studies|date=2011|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0-393-97578-9|pages=17–24|chapter=Notes on the State of Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adolf Hitler]] also made use of this theory to extol the supremacy of the [[Nordic race]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carolynyeager.net/why-we-are-antisemites-text-adolf-hitlers-1920-speech-hofbr%C3%A4uhaus|title="Why We Are Antisemites" - Text of Adolf Hitler's 1920 speech at the Hofbräuhaus|author=Carolyn Yeager|date=29 January 2013|work=carolynyeager.net|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defects of character supposedly generated by tropical climates were believed to be inheritable under the [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarckian]] theory of [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]], a discredited precursor to the [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] theory of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name="J.A. Campbell 1983"/&gt; The outdated theory begins with the observation that an organism faced with environmental pressures may undergo physiological changes during its lifetime through the process of [[acclimatization]]. Lamarckianism suggested that those physiological changes may be passed directly to offspring, without the need for offspring to develop the trait in the same manner.&lt;ref&gt;Lamarck, 1809: 124 in Ernst Mayr, "Lamarck Revisited," Journal of the History of Biology 5 (1972): 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Geographical societies like the [[Royal Geographical Society]] and the [[Société de géographie]] supported imperialism by funding explorers and other colonial proponents.&lt;ref&gt;Gilmartin, M. (2009). "Colonialism/Imperialism". Key concepts in political geography (pg 117). London: SAGE.&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific societies acted similarly. [[Acclimatisation society|Acclimatization societies]] directly supported colonial enterprises and enjoyed their benefits. The writings of Lamarck provided theoretical backing for the acclimatization doctrines. The Société Zoologique d'Acclimatation was largely founded by [[Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]]—son of [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], a close colleague and supporter of Lamarck.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Michael A. "Acclimatizing the World: A History of the Paradigmatic Colonial Science." Osiris 15 (2000): 138, 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ellen Churchill Semple]], a prominent environmental determinism scholar, applied her theories in a case study which focused on the [[Philippines]], where she mapped civilization and wildness onto the [[topography]] of the islands.&lt;ref name="Painter 2009, pg.177" /&gt; Other scholars argued that climate and topography caused specific character traits to appear in a given populations. Scholars thereby imposed racial stereotypes on whole societies.&lt;ref name="Painter 2009, pg.177" /&gt; Imperial powers rationalized [[Exploitation of labour|labor exploitation]] by claiming that tropical peoples were morally inferior.&lt;ref&gt;Shirlow, Peter, Gallaher, Carolyn, Gilmartin, Mary, "Key Concepts in Political Geography", SAGE Publications Ldt, 2009, pg.127.&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of environmental determinism in rationalizing and legitimizing [[racism]], [[ethnocentrism]] and [[economic inequality]] has consequently drawn strong criticism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Painter &amp; Jeffrey, "Political Geography", Sage Publications, 2009, pg.200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many modern scientists have also critiqued classical environmental determinism as unscientific. [[Carl O. Sauer|Carl Sauer]] criticized the premature generalizations resulting from bias in environmentalism in 1924. He argued that to define [[geography]] as the study of environmental influences is to assume in advance that such influences do operate, and that science cannot be based upon or committed to preconceptions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} Furthermore, since [[evolution|evolutionary change]] manifests over very long time periods, some argue that the ability to adequately correlate human behaviour with any specific environmental condition is speculative at best and impossible at worst.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

[[David Landes]] similarly condemns of what he terms the unscientific moral geography of [[Ellsworth Huntington]]. He argues that Huntington undermined geography as a science by attributing all human activity to physical influences so that he might classify civilizations hierarchically – favoring those civilizations he considered best.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Landes|first1=David|title=The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why Some are So Rich and Some So Poor|ISBN= 0-393-04017-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late-20th-century growth of neo-environmental determinism===
Environmental determinism was revived in the late-twentieth century as neo-environmental determinism. The new term coined by the [[social science|social scientist]] and critic [[Andrew Sluyter]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Sluyter argues that neo-environmental determinism does not sufficiently break with its classical and imperial precursors.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Neo-environmental determinism examines how the physical environment predisposes societies and states towards particular trajectories of economic and political development. It explores how geographic and ecological forces influence [[state-building]], [[economic development]], and [[institutions]]. It also addresses fears surrounding the [[effects of global warming|effects of modern climate change]].&lt;ref name="Sage Publications"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Matthews, Bartlein, Briffa, Dawson, Vernal, Denham, Fritz, Oldfield|title=The SAGE Handbook of Environmental Change|date=2012|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London|isbn=978-0-85702-360-5|pages=1–447}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jared Diamond]] was influential in the resurgence of environmental determinism due to the popularity of his book ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'', which addresses the geographic origins of state formation prior to 1500 A.D.&lt;ref name="Diamond1997GGS"&gt;{{cite book | author=Diamond, J. | title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies | publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company | date=March 1997 | isbn=0-393-03891-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-environmental determinism scholars debate how much the [[physical environment]] shapes economic and political [[institutions]]. Economic historians [[Stanley Engerman]] and [[Kenneth Sokoloff]] argue that [[factor endowments]] greatly affected "institutional" development in the Americas, by which they mean the tendency to more free (democratic, free market) or unfree (dictatorial, economically restrictive) regimes.

In contrast, [[Daron Acemoglu]], [[Simon Johnson (economist)|Simon Johnson]], and [[James A. Robinson (Harvard University)|James A. Robinson]] underscore that the geographic factors most influenced institutional development during early state formation and [[colonialism]]. They argue that geographic differences cannot explain economic growth disparities after 1500 A.D. directly, except through their effects on economic and political institutions.&lt;ref name="Crown Business"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Acemoglu|first1=Daron|last2=Robinson|first2=James|title=Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty|date=2012|publisher=Crown Business|location=New York|isbn=978-0307719218|pages=1–546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists [[Jeffrey Sachs]] and [[John Luke Gallup]] have examined the direct impacts of geographic and climatic factors on economic development, especially the role of geography on the cost of trade and access to markets, the disease environment, and agricultural productivity.&lt;ref name="Geography and Economic Development"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gallup, Sachs, and Mellinger|title=Geography and Economic Development|journal=International Regional Science Review|date=August 1999|issue=22|pages=179–232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary [[global warming]] crisis has also impacted environmental determinism scholarship. [[Jared Diamond]] draws similarities between the [[climate change|changing climate conditions]] that brought down the [[Easter Island]] civilization and [[global warming]] in his book ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diamond|first1=Jared|title=Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed|date=January 4, 2011|publisher=Penguin Group|location=New York|isbn=0140279512|pages=1–621}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Kolata, Charles Ortloff, and Gerald Huag similarly describe the [[Tiwanaku empire]] and [[Maya civilization]] collapses as caused by climate events such as [[drought]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kolata|first1=Alan L.|last2=Ortloff|first2=Charles|title=Thermal Analysis of Tiwanaku Raised Field Systems in the Lake Titicaca Basin of Bolivia|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=October 1989|volume=16|pages=233–263|doi=10.1016/0305-4403(89)90004-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huag|first1=Gerald|title=Climate and the Collapse of Maya Civilization|journal=Science|date=March 2003|volume=299|issue=5613|pages=1731–1735}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter deMenocal, Just as the earthworks in the deserts of the west grew out of notions of landscape painting, the growth of public art stimulated artists to engage the urban landscape as another environment and also as a platform to engage ideas and concepts about the environment to a larger audience. A scientist at the [[Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory]] at [[Columbia University]], writes that societal collapse due to climate change is possible today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=deMenocal|first1=Peter|title=African Climate Change and Faunal Evolution During the Pliocene-Pleistocene|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|date=December 2003|volume=220|pages=3–24|doi=10.1016/s0012-821x(04)00003-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecological and geographic impacts on early state formation ==
{{main article|State formation}}

===Effects of species endowments, climate, and continental axes prior to 1500===
{{main article|Guns, Germs, and Steel}}
In the [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'' (1999), author [[Jared Diamond]] points to geography as the answer to why certain states were able to grow and develop faster and stronger than others. His theory cited the natural environment and raw materials a civilization was blessed with as factors for success, instead of popular century old claims of racial and cultural superiority. Diamond says that these natural endowments began with the dawn of man, and favored Eurasian civilizations due to their location along similar latitudes, suitable farming climate, and early animal domestication.&lt;ref name="Guns, Germs, and Steel"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diamond|first1=Jared|title=Guns, Germs, and Steel|date=1997|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diamond argues that early states located along the same latitude lines were uniquely suited to take advantage of similar climates, making it easier for crops, livestock, and farming techniques to spread. Crops such as [[wheat]] and [[barley]] were simple to grow and easy to harvest, and regions suitable for their cultivation saw high population densities and the growth of early cities. The ability to domesticate herd animals, which had no natural fear of humans, high birth rates, and an innate hierarchy, gave some civilizations the advantages of free labor, fertilizers, and war animals. The east-west orientation of Eurasia allowed for knowledge capital to spread quickly, and writing systems to keep track of advanced farming techniques gave people the ability to store and build upon a knowledge base across generations. Craftsmanship flourished as a surplus of food from farming allowed some groups the freedom to explore and create, which lead to the development of [[metallurgy]] and advances in technology. While the advantageous geography helped to develop early societies, the close proximity in which humans and their animals lived led to the spread of disease across Eurasia. Over several centuries, rampant disease decimated populations, but ultimately led to disease resistant communities. Diamond suggests that these chains of causation led to European and Asian civilizations holding a dominant place in the world today.&lt;ref name="Guns, Germs, and Steel"/&gt;

Diamond uses the Spanish [[conquistador|conquistadors']] conquering of the Americas as a case study for his theory. He argues that the Europeans took advantage of their environment to build large and complex states complete with advanced technology and weapons. The [[Incans]] and other native groups were not as blessed, suffering from a north–south orientation that prevented the flow of goods and knowledge across the continent. The Americas also lacked the animals, metals, and complex writing systems of Eurasia which prevented them from achieving the military or biological protections needed to fight off the European threat.&lt;ref name="Guns, Germs, and Steel"/&gt;

Diamond's theory has not gone without criticism.
* It was notably attacked for not providing enough detail regarding causation of environmental variables, and for leaving logical gaps in reasoning. Geographer Andrew Sluyter argued that Diamond was just as ignorant as the racists of the 19th century. Sluyter challenged Diamond's theory since it seemed to suggest that environmental conditions lead to gene selection, which then lead to wealth and power for certain civilizations. Sluyter also attacks environmental determinism by condemning it as a highly studied and popular field based entirely on Diamond's "quick and dirty" combination of natural and social sciences.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;
* [[Daron Acemoglu]] and [[James A. Robinson (Harvard University)|James A. Robinson]] similarly criticized Diamond's work in their book ''[[Why Nations Fail]]''. They contend that the theory is outdated and can not effectively explain differences in economic growth after 1500 or the reasons why states that are geographically close can exhibit vast differences in wealth. They instead favored an institutional approach in which a societies success or failure is based on the underlying strength of its institutions.&lt;ref name="Crown Business"/&gt;

===Geography and pre-colonial African state-building  ===

==== The effects of climate and land abundance on the development of state systems ====
{{main article|States and Power in Africa: Comparative Lessons in Authority and Control}}

In his book ''[[States and Power in Africa]]'', political scientist [[Jeffrey Herbst]] argues that environmental conditions help explain why, in contrast to other parts of the world such as Europe, many pre-colonial societies in Africa did not develop into dense, settled, hierarchical societies with strong state control that competed with neighboring states for people and territory.&lt;ref name="cul.columbia.edu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robinson|first1=James|title=States and Power in Africa: By Jeffrey I. Herbst: A Review Essay|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|date=June 2002|volume=40|issue=2|pages=510–19|doi=10.1257/002205102320161357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbst argues that the European state-building experience was highly idiosyncratic because it occurred under systemic geographic pressures that favored wars of conquest – namely, passable [[terrain]], land [[scarcity]], and [[population densities|high-population densities]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tilly|first1=Charles|title=Coercion, Capital, and European States, A.D. 990–1992|date=1990|publisher=Blackwell|location=Cambridge, MA|page=63|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with the constant threat of war, political elites sent administrators and armed forces from the urban centers into rural hinterlands to raise taxes, recruit soldiers, and fortify buffer zones. European states consequently developed strong institutions and capital-periphery linkages.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

By contrast, geographic and climatic factors in pre-colonial Africa made establishing absolute control over particular pieces of land prohibitively costly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herbst|first1=Jeffry|title=States and Power in Africa|date=2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0-691-01027-7|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, because African farmers relied on rain-fed agriculture and consequently invested little in particular pieces of land, they could easily flee rulers rather than fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herbst|first1=Jeffry|title=States and Power in Africa|date=2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0-691-01027-7|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some early African empires, like the [[Ashanti Empire]], successfully projected power over large distances by building roads.The largest pre-colonial polities arose in the [[Sudanian Savanna]] belt of West Africa because the horses and camels could transport armies over the terrain. In other areas, no centralized political organizations existed above the village level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herbst|first1=Jeffry|title=States and Power in Africa|date=2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0-691-01027-7|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African states did not develop more responsive institutions under [[Colonisation of Africa|colonial rule]] or [[Decolonisation of Africa|post-independence]]. Colonial powers had little incentive to develop state institutions to protect their colonies against invasion, having divided up Africa at the [[Berlin Conference]]. The colonizers instead focused on exploting natural resources and [[exploitation colonialism]].&lt;ref name="cul.columbia.edu"/&gt;

==== The effect of disease environments ====
Dr. Marcella Alsan argues the prevalence of the [[tsetse fly]] hampered early state formation in [[Africa]].&lt;ref name="Alsan"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alsan|first=Marcella|date=January 2015|title=The Effect of the Tsetse Fly on African Development|url=https://fsi.stanford.edu/publications/the_effect_of_the_tsetse_fly_on_african_development|journal=American Economic Review|volume=105|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the tsetse virus was lethal to cows and horses, communities afflicted by the insect could not rely on the agricultural benefits provided by [[livestock]]. African communities were prevented from stockpiling agricultural surplus, working the land, or eating meat. Because the disease environment hindered the formation of farming communities, early African societies resembled small [[hunter-gatherer]] groups and not centralized states.&lt;ref name="Alsan"/&gt;

The relative availability of livestock animals enabled European societies to form centralized institutions, develop advanced technologies, and create an agricultural network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Overton|first1=Mark|title=Agricultural Revolution in England: The Transformation of the Agrarian Economy 1500–1850|date=18 April 1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; They could rely on their livestock to reduce the need for manual labor. Livestock also diminished the [[comparative advantage]] of owning [[slaves]]. African societies relied on the use of rival tribesman as slave labor where the fly was prevalent, which impeded long-term societal cooperation.&lt;ref name="Alsan"/&gt;

Alsan argues that her findings support the view of [[Kenneth Sokoloff]] and [[Stanley Engerman]] that factor endowments shape state institutions.&lt;ref name="Alsan"/&gt;

===Llamas, chuño and the Inca Empire===
{{see also|Vertical archipelago}}
[[Carl Troll]] has argued that the development of the [[Inca Empire|Inca state]] in the central [[Andes]] was aided by conditions that allow for the elaboration of the [[staple food]] [[chuño]]. Chuño, which can be stored for long times, is made of [[potato]] dried at [[Freezing#Food_preservation|freezing]] temperatures that are common at nighttime in the southern [[Peru]]vian highlands. Contradicting the link between the Inca state and dried potato is that other crops such as [[maize]] can also be preserved with only sun.&lt;ref name=Gade2016/&gt; Troll also argued that [[llama]]s, the Incas' [[pack animal]], can be found in their largest numbers in this very same region.&lt;ref name=Gade2016&gt;{{cite book |last=Gade |first=Daniel |date=2016 |title=Spell of the Urubamba: Anthropogeographical Essays on an Andean Valley in Space and Time |url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319208480#aboutBook |chapter=Urubamba Verticality: Reflections on Crops and Diseases |location= |publisher= |page=86 |isbn=978-3-319-20849-7 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is worth considering that the maximum extent of the Inca Empire coincided with the greatest distribution of [[alpaca]]s and llamas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hardoy |first=Jorge Henríque |date=1973 |title=Pre-Colombian Cities |url=https://books.google.cl/books?id=fbQJBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=llama+inca+expansion+colombia+limi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Rirv1B3ECv&amp;sig=eNEgkUGhfN1RQ2uoR71F2WF52Xw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjFtZvGvZTZAhVJHJAKHeZYA_MQ6AEIdDAP#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= |publisher= |page=24 |isbn=978-0802703804 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a third point Troll pointed out [[Irrigation in Peru|irrigation]] technology as advantageous to the Inca state-building.&lt;ref name=Gade1996&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gade |first1=Daniel W. |date=1996 |title=Carl Troll on Nature and Culture in the Andes (Carl Troll über die Natur und Kultur in den Anden)  |url= |journal=[[Erdkunde]] |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=301–316 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Troll theorized environmental influences on the Inca Empire, he opposed environmental determinism, arguing that culture lay at the core of the Inca civilization.&lt;ref name=Gade1996/&gt;

==Effects of geography on political regimes ==

Numerous scholars have argued that geographic and environmental factors affect the types of [[political regime]] that societies develop, and shape paths towards [[democracy]] versus [[dictatorship]].

=== The disease environment ===
{{main article|Why Nations Fail}}

[[Daron Acemoglu]], [[Simon Johnson (economist)|Simon Johnson]], and [[James A. Robinson (Harvard University)|James A. Robinson]] have achieved notoriety for demonstrating that diseases and terrain have helped shape tendencies towards democracy versus dictatorship, and through these economic growth and development. In their book ''[[Why Nations Fail]]'', as well as a paper titled ''The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson|first=Daron, Simon and James|date=December 2001|title=The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation|url=http://economics.mit.edu/files/4123|journal=The American Economic Review|doi=|pmid=|access-date=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the authors show that the colonial disease environment shaped the tendency for Europeans to settle the territory or not, and whether they developed systems of agriculture and labor markets that were free and egalitarian versus exploitative and unequal. These choices of political and economic institutions, they argue, shaped tendencies to democracy or dictatorship over the following centuries.

===Factor endowments===
{{main article|Factor endowment}}

In order to understand the impact and creation of institutions during early state formation, economic historians [[Stanley Engerman]] and [[Kenneth Sokoloff]] examined the economic development of the Americas during colonization.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economic development in the Americas since 1500: endowments and institutions|last=Engerman|first=Stanley L.|last2=Sokoloff|first2=Kenneth L.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=9780521251372|location=United States|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that the beginnings of the success or failure of American colonies were based on the specific [[factor endowments]] available to each colony. These endowments included the climate, soil profitability, crop potential, and even native population density. Institutions formed to take advantage of these factor endowments. Those that were most successful developed an ability to change and adapt to new circumstances over time. For example, the development of economic institutions, such as [[plantation]]s, was caused by the need for a large property and labor force to harvest sugar and tobacco, while smallholder farms thrived in areas where scale economies were absent. Though initially profitable, plantation colonies also suffered from large dependent populations over time as slaves and natives were given few rights, limiting the population available to drive future economic progress and technological development.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Factor endowments also influenced political institutions. This is demonstrated by the plantation owning elite using their power to secure long lasting government institutions and pass legislation that lead to the persistence of inequality society. Engerman and Sokoloff found smallholder economies to be more equitable since they discouraged an elite class from forming, and distributed political power democratically to most land-owning males. These differences in political institutions were also highly influential in the development of schools, as more equitable societies demanded an educated population to make political decisions. Over time these institutional advantages had exponential effects, as colonies with educated and free populations were better suited to take advantage of technological change during the industrial revolution, granting country wide participation into the booming free-market economy.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Engerman and Sokoloff conclude that while institutions heavily influenced the success of each colony, no individual type of institution is the source of economic and state growth. Other variables such as factor endowments, technologies, and the creation of property rights are just as crucial in societal development. To encourage state success an institution must be adaptable and suited to find the most economical source of growth. The authors also argue that while not the only means for success, institutional development has long lasting-economic and social effects on the state.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Other prominent scholars contest the extent to which [[factor endowments]] determine economic and political institutions.&lt;ref name="Easterly 3–39"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Easterly|first=William|last2=Levine|first2=Ross|date=January 2003|title=Tropics, germs, and crops: how endowments influence economic development|url=|journal=Journal of Monetary Economics|volume=50|pages=3–39|doi=10.1016/s0304-3932(02)00200-3|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nugent 45–82"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nugent|first=Jeffrey B.|last2=Robinson|first2=James A.|date=March 2010|title=Are Factor Endowments Fate?|url=|journal=Revista de Historia Económica|volume=28|issue=1|pages=45–82|doi=10.1017/s0212610909990048|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American economists [[William Easterly]] and [[Ross Levine]] argue that economic development does not solely depend on geographic endowments—like temperate climates, disease-resistant climates, or soil favorable to [[cash crops]]. They stress that there is no evidence that geographic endowments influence country incomes other than through institutions.&lt;ref name="Easterly 3–39"/&gt; They observe that states like [[Burundi]] are poor—despite favorable environmental conditions like abundant rainfall and fertile soil—because of the damage wrought by colonialism. Other states like [[Canada]] with fewer endowments are more stable and have higher per capita incomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Easterly|first=William|last2=Levine|first2=Ross|date=January 2003|title=Tropics, germs, and crops: how endowments influence economic development|url=|journal=Journal of Monetary Economics|volume=50|pages=3–5|doi=10.1016/s0304-3932(02)00200-3|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Easterly and Levine further observe that studies of how the environment directly influences land and labor were tarred by racist theories of underdevelopment, but that does not mean that such theories can be automatically discredited. They argue that Diamond correctly stresses the importance of germs and crops in the very long-run of societal technological development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Easterly|first=William|last2=Levine|first2=Ross|date=January 2003|title=Tropics, germs, and crops: how endowments influence economic development|url=|journal=Journal of Monetary Economics|volume=50|page=6|doi=10.1016/s0304-3932(02)00200-3|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They find that regression results support the findings of [[Jared Diamond]] and [[David Landes]] that factor endowments influence GDP per capita. However, Easterly and Levine's findings most support the view that long-lasting institutions most shape economic development outcomes. Relevant institutions include private property rights and the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Easterly|first=William|last2=Levine|first2=Ross|date=January 2003|title=Tropics, germs, and crops: how endowments influence economic development|url=|journal=Journal of Monetary Economics|volume=50|page=27|doi=10.1016/s0304-3932(02)00200-3|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeffrey B. Nugent and [[James A. Robinson (Harvard University)|James A. Robinson]] similarly challenge scholars like [[Barrington Moore, Jr.|Barrington Moore]] who hold that certain factor endowments and [[agricultural]] preconditions necessarily lead to particular political and economic organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nugent|first=Jeffrey B.|last2=Robinson|first2=James A.|date=March 2010|title=Are Factor Endowments Fate?|url=|journal=Revista de Historia Económica|volume=28|issue=1|pages=47|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nugent and Robinson show that [[Economics of coffee|coffee economies]] in [[South America]] pursued radically different paths of political and economic development during the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Nugent 45–82"/&gt;

Some coffee states, like [[Costa Rica]] and [[Colombia]], passed laws like the [[Homestead Act of 1862]]. They favored smallholders, held elections, maintained small militaries, and fought fewer wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nugent|first=Jeffrey B.|last2=Robinson|first2=James A.|date=March 2010|title=Are Factor Endowments Fate?|url=|journal=Revista de Historia Económica|volume=28|issue=1|pages=50|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smallholder arrangements prompted widespread government investment in education. Other states like [[El Salvador]] and [[Guatemala]] produced coffee on plantations, where individuals were more disenfranchised. Whether a state became a smallholder or plantation state depended not on factor endowments but on norms established under [[colonialism]]—namely, legal statues determining access to land, the background of the governing elites, and the degree of permitted political competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nugent|first=Jeffrey B.|last2=Robinson|first2=James A.|date=March 2010|title=Are Factor Endowments Fate?|url=|journal=Revista de Historia Económica|volume=28|issue=1|pages=45|doi=10.1017/s0212610909990048|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nugent and Robinson thereby conclude that factor endowments alone do not determine economic or political institutions.

==Direct effects of geography on economic development==

===Effects of terrain on trade and productivity===

Historians have also noted population densities seem to concentrate on coastlines and that states with large coasts benefit from higher average incomes compared to those in landlocked countries. Coastal living has proven advantageous for centuries as civilizations relied on the coastline and waterways for trade, irrigation, and as a food source.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Conversely, countries without coastlines or navigable waterways are often less urbanized and have less growth potential due to the slow movement of knowledge capital, technological advances, and people. They also have to rely on costly and time consuming over-land trade, which usually results in lack of access to regional and international markets, further hindering growth. Additionally, interior locations tend to have both lower population densities and labor-productivity levels. However, factors including fertile soil, nearby rivers, and ecological systems suited for rice or wheat cultivation can give way to dense inland populations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Nathan Nunn]] and Diego Puga note that though rugged terrain usually makes farming difficult, prevents travel, and limits societal growth, early African states used harsh terrain to their advantage.&lt;ref name="Nunn 20–36"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nunn|first=Nathan|last2=Puga|first2=Diego|date=February 2012|title=Ruggedness: The Blessing of Bad Geography in Africa|url=http://dpuga.economics.utoronto.ca/research/rugged.pdf|journal=The Review of Economics and Statistics|volume=94|pages=20–36|doi=10.1162/rest_a_00161|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors used a terrain ruggedness index to quantify topographic heterogeneity across several regions of Africa, while simultaneously controlling for variables such as diamond availability and soil fertility. The results suggest that historically, ruggedness is strongly correlated with decreased income levels across the globe and has negatively impacted state growth over time. They note that harsh terrain limited the flow of trade goods and decreased crop availability, while isolating communities from developing knowledge capital. However, the study also demonstrated that the terrain had positive effects on some African communities by protecting them from the slave trade. Communities that were located in areas with rugged features could successfully hide from slave traders and protect their homes from being destroyed. The study found that in these areas rugged topography produced long-term economic benefits and aided post-colonial state formation.&lt;ref name="Nunn 20–36"/&gt;

===Effects of climate on productivity===

The impact that climate and water navigability have on economic growth and GDP per capita was studied by notable scholars including [[Paul Krugman]], [[Jared Diamond]], and [[Jeffrey Sachs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mellinger|first=Andrew D.|last2=Sachs|first2=Jeffrey D.|last3=Gallup|first3=John L.|date=1999|title=Climate, Water Navigability, and Economic Development (Working Paper)|url=|journal=Harvard Institute for International Development|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By using variables to measure environmental determinism, such as climate, land composition, latitude, and the presence of infectious disease, they account for trends in worldwide economic development on local, regional and global scales. To do so, they measure economic growth with GDP per capita adjusted to purchasing power parity (PPP), while also taking into consideration population density and labor productivity .&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Gallup, John Luke, Jeffrey D. Sachs and Andrew D. Mellinger. "Geography and Economic Development." International regional Science (1999 vol.22): 179–224. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic historians have found that societies in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] experience higher standards of living, and that as latitude increases north or south from the equator, levels of real GDP per capita also increases. Climate is closely correlated with agricultural production since without ideal weather conditions, agriculture alone will not produce the surplus supply needed to build and maintain economies. Locations with hot tropical climates often suffer underdevelopment due to low fertility of soils, excessive plant transpiration, ecological conditions favoring infectious diseases, and unreliable water supply. These factors can cause tropical zones to suffer a 30% to 50% decrease in productivity relative to temperate climate zones.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Easterly|first=William|last2=Levine|first2=Ross|date=January 2003|title=Tropics, germs, and crops: how endowments influence economic development|url=|journal=Journal of Monetary Economics|volume=50|pages=3–39|doi=10.1016/s0304-3932(02)00200-3|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tropical infectious diseases that thrive in hot and moist equatorial climates cause thousands of deaths each year. They are also an economic drain on society due to high medical costs, and the unwillingness of foreign capital to invest in a sickly state. Because infectious diseases like malaria often need a warm ecology for growth, states in the mid to high latitudes are naturally protected from the devastating effects of disease.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Climatic determinism and colonization===
Climatic determinism, otherwise referred to as the ''equatorial paradox,'' is an aspect of [[economic geography]]. According to this theory, about 70% of a country's [[economic development]] can be predicted by the distance between that country and the [[equator]], and that the further from the equator a country is located, the more developed it tends to be. The theory is the central argument of [[Philip M. Parker]]'s ''Physioeconomics: The Basis for Long-Run Economic Growth'', in which he argues that since humans originated as tropical mammals, those who relocated to colder climates attempt to restore their physiological homeostasis through wealth-creation. This act includes producing more food, better housing, heating, warm clothes, etc. Conversely, humans that remained in warmer climates are more physiologically comfortable simply due to temperature, and so have less incentive to work to increase their comfort levels. Therefore, according to Parker [[GDP]] is a direct product of the natural compensation of humans to their climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Phillip|title=Physioeconomics The Basis for Long-Run Economic Growth|journal=The MIT Press|date=September 2000|pages=1–327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political geographers have used climatic determinism ideology to attempt to predict and rationalize the history of civilization, as well as to explain existing or perceived social and cultural divides between peoples. Some argue that one of the first attempts geographers made to define the development of human geography across the globe was to relate a country's climate to human development. Using this ideology, many geographers believed they were able "to explain and predict the progress of human societies".&lt;ref name="Painter pg.177"&gt;Painter &amp; Jeffrey, "Political Geography", Sage Publications, 2009, pg.177&lt;/ref&gt; This led to warmer climate zones being "seen as producing less civilized, more degenerate peoples, in need of salvation by western colonial powers."&lt;ref name="Shirlow, Peter 2009, pg.117"&gt;Shirlow, Peter, Gallaher, Carolyn, Gilmartin, Mary, "Key Concepts in Political Geography", Sage Publications Ltd, 2009, pg.117.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ellsworth Huntington]] also travelled continental Europe in hopes of better understanding the connection between climate and state success, publishing his findings in ''The Pulse of Asia'', and further elaborating in ''Civilization and Climate''.&lt;ref name="sharp2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sharp|first1=Jo|title=Geographies of Postcolonialism|date=2008|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Los Angeles, London|pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the political geographers, a crucial component of his work was the belief that the climate of North-western Europe was ideal, with areas further north being too cold, and areas further south being too hot, resulting in lazy, laid-back populations.&lt;ref name="sharp2008" /&gt; These ideas were powerful connections to [[colonialism]], and may have played a role in the creation of the '[[Other (philosophy)#Imperialism and colonialism|other]]' and the literature that many used to justify taking advantage of less advanced nations.&lt;ref name="sharp2008" /&gt; Huntington also argued that climate can lead to the demise of even advanced civilizations through drought, food insecurity, and damages to economic production.&lt;ref name="Sage Publications"/&gt;

==Gameplay==

In ''Everybody's Gone to the Rapture'', the player explores a small English town whose inhabitants have mysteriously disappeared. The player can interact with floating lights throughout the world, most of which can reveal parts of the story. The player can also interact with [[artificiality|man-made]] objects, such as doors, radios, phones, fences, and power switches.

==Plot==

The game is set in 1984, in a fictional deserted village named Yaughton in [[Shropshire|Shropshire, England]]. The player's only objective is to explore and try to discover how and why everyone has disappeared. Mysterious floating orbs of light swim around the air and lead the player to scenes made up of other human-shaped lights, which re-enact various previously occurring events throughout the game. Following the orbs' evidence from scene-to-scene across the valley, as well as finding telephones and radios that replay conversations, recordings, and broadcasts from throughout the story, eventually provide all of the puzzle pieces to the game's main event (the 'rapture'.)

There are five areas in the game, each of which revolve around a different character, with the main protagonists being Dr Katherine Collins (Kate) and her husband, Stephen Appleton – both scientists at the observatory.  During their work, Kate and Stephen encounter a ‘strange pattern’ of lights in the night sky which they quickly come to believe is an unknown form of life. They observe the pattern ‘infecting’ and sometimes killing other lifeforms such as birds and cows, before spreading to humans. Kate concludes that the pattern is attempting to communicate with humans, ignorant to the harm that it is causing them. She locks herself in the observatory and spends the vast majority of the story attempting to communicate with it. During this time, Stephen becomes convinced that the pattern is a deadly threat capable of destroying the human race.

Most of the valley's inhabitants begin to succumb to symptoms of unexplained haemorrhaging; pressure in the brain that is normally consistent with a brain tumour, as the local doctor notes in a left-behind recording. Other people simply disappear, leaving behind nothing more than a room full of odd specks of light and the lingering scent of unidentifiable ash. Convinced that this is connected to the pattern and that it will spread beyond the village if not contained, Stephen urges the local government to quarantine the area, blocking the roads and cutting the telephone lines. The locals are told that it is due to an outbreak of [[1918 pandemic flu|Spanish flu]], though many are extremely sceptical of this and become even more so when the corpses of their dead begin to disappear into thin air.

As the town's population rapidly dwindles, Stephen realizes that the quarantine has failed and that the 'pattern', or simply 'it' as it is often referred to, has learned to adapt. He believes that it has learned to travel not just through direct human contact, but through the telephone lines, radio waves, and television sets. In light of this, he then desperately insists to the local government that they must gas the entire valley.

In the second to last chapter of the game, the player is led to a bunker where Stephen Appleton waited out the nerve gas bombings with the intention of killing himself once he ensured that every other infected person in the valley was dead. When he is unable to reach anyone at all outside the valley via telephone, he realizes that he has failed and that the pattern has spread, presumably to the entire planet as a whole. The pattern comes for him and he confronts it. He tells it that he has decided to set fire to himself, having doused himself in gasoline, to prevent being taken by it. However, before he can do so he sees the image of Kate in the pattern of light and stands in awe, reaching out to her. The scene then fades out as Stephen's lighter slips out of his hand and hits the ground, igniting the gasoline.

In the final part of the game the player is transported to the inside of the observatory's locked entrance gate.  The player makes their way up the hill to the top-most observatory and upon entering sees the human light shape of Kate inside in the darkness making the last of the recordings heard throughout the game. She states that she is the last one left, and it is revealed that she did indeed finally achieve communication with 'the pattern'. Kate explains that when she told the pattern that what it did to everyone in the valley - the people, the birds, the bugs, the cows - was wrong, it countered that it was not wrong, because now everyone that wanted to be together was together, and that everyone had found their counterpart and was no longer alone. Kate explains how she finally understands and says that she has accepted her fate, and that she and 'the pattern' will soon join the others. She states that humanity can finally 'slip away, unafraid.' Kate turns and appears to reach out to the pattern coming down from above as it reaches out to meet her, her last words being her belief that the Pattern was her own counterpart.

==Development==
During the development of ''Dear Esther'', the team wanted to introduce interactive elements. When this proved to be impractical, the concept of ''Everybody's Gone to the Rapture'' was born.&lt;ref name="eurog"/&gt; The developers were inspired by "the very British apocalyptic sci-fi of the 60s and 70", like [[John Christopher]]'s ''[[The Death of Grass]]'' and [[Charles Eric Maine]]'s ''The Tide Went Out''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-07-27-where-literature-and-gaming-collide|title=Where literature and gaming collide|last=McMullan|first=Thomas|date=27 July 2014|work=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The team made the decision to partner with Sony as they felt they could not raise enough money for the project through [[crowdfunding]] sources or through sales of alpha versions.&lt;ref name="rockpapershotgunpc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gamezonemichael" /&gt; A Windows version of the game was released on 14 April 2016.

The game's soundtrack composed by [[Jessica Curry]] was published by [[Sony Classical]] as a 28-track album in Britain.

''Everybody's Gone to the Rapture'' received positive reviews, receiving an aggregated score of 78/100 on [[Metacritic]] based on 81 reviews.&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt;

GamesRadar called the game "brave, [...] challenging, and [...] essential",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sakuroaka-Gilman|first1=Matthew|title=Everybody's Gone to the Rapture review|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2015/08/10/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review|website=GamesRadar|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while IGN talked about "a beautiful, heart-breaking journey into the end of the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sliva|first1=Martin|title=Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture Review|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2015/08/10/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review|website=IGN|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Everybody's Gone to the Rapture'' was also featured on several "Best games of the year" lists, such as Kirk Hamilton's from Kotaku,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hamilton|first1=Kirk|title=Kirk Hamilton's Top 10 Games Of 2015|url=http://www.kotaku.co.uk/2015/12/31/kirk-hamiltons-top-10-games-of-2015|website=Kotaku|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexa Ray Corriea's from GameSpot&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Corriea|first1=Alexa Ray|title=Alexa Ray Corriea's Top 5 Games of 2015|url=http://www.gamespot.com/videos/alexa-ray-corrieas-top-5-games-of-2015/2300-6428750/|website=Gamespot}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Kill Screen's "Best Videogames of 2015" list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=High Scores: The Best Videogames of 2015|url=https://killscreen.com/articles/high-scores-the-best-videogames-of-2016/|website=Kill Screen|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some reviewers criticized what was perceived as too little interactivity from the player. [[Jim Sterling]], while analysing games often derided as "[[walking simulator]]s", said that ''Rapture'' is a model of what not to do in this genre, such as by not shifting the tone of the game as it progresses, and by making the back-story more interesting than the game itself. He also unfavourably compared it to ''[[Gone Home]]'' and ''[[The Stanley Parable]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|publisher=[[YouTube]]|title=Walking Simulators (The Jimquisition)|author=Sterling, Jim|authorlink=Jim Sterling|date=17 August 2015|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdHWGMkMorg}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw]] of ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'' called it the 4th blandest game of 2015, saying that it deserves the title of "walking simulator", and for how little it did to evolve the interactive story genre, comparing it unfavourably to ''The Stanley Parable'' as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Croshaw, Ben "Yahtzee"|work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]|title=Top 5 Games of 2015|authorlink=Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw|date=6 January 2016|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/116617-Top-5-Best-and-Worst-Games-of-2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Filippo Reef''' is a reef that is asserted to be in the Pacific Ocean at {{Coord|05|30|S|151|50|W|display=inline}}, {{convert|450|km|mi}} east of [[Starbuck Island]] in the [[Line Islands]]. The reef was reported by the master of the Italian barque ''[[Filippo]]'' as having been seen on 28 June 1886. From  an unidentified report of  [[Breaker (reef)|breakers]] dated 1926, it was estimated to have a water depth of only {{convert|0.6|to|0.9|m|ft|0}}, and appeared to be about {{convert|1.6|km|mi|1}} long northwest to southeast, and less in width.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite enroute|126|2017|49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only sighting referenced shows a date of 1926. The topographic data supplied by the [[General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans]] (GEBCO), however, shows a sea depth of {{convert|3.3|mi|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gebco.net General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Filippo Reef |work=WolframAlpha.com |url=http://www.wolframalpha.com/entities/undersea_features/filippo_reef/q1/il/vm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130630161943/http://www.wolframalpha.com/entities/undersea_features/filippo_reef/q1/il/vm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=30 June 2013 |accessdate=7 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore likely that this 1926 report is an error, and that Filippo Reef is a [[phantom island]], and that therefore any maps showing it are relying on the 1926 report and are also in error.

Nevertheless, it is marked in the 2015 edition of the ''National Geographic Atlas of the World''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=National Geographic Atlas of the World |edition=10th |year=2015 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=National Geographic |page=plate 109 |isbn=1-4262-1354-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cyprus''' is an island in the Eastern Basin of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. It is the third largest island in the Mediterranean (after the [[Italy|Italian]] islands of [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]]) and the [[List of islands by area|world's 80th largest]] island by area. It is located south of Asia Minor, the [[Anatolia]]n [[peninsula]]  of the [[Asia]]n (or [[Eurasia]]n) mainland (part of [[Turkey]]), so it may be included in [[Western Asia]]&lt;ref&gt;http://millenniumindicators.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm#asia UN&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Middle East]]:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cy.html CIA World Factbook&lt;/ref&gt; Cyprus is close to [[Southern Europe]], and [[Northern Africa]], and has had lengthy periods of mainly [[Greece|Greek]] and intermittent Anatolian, [[Levant]]ine, [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]], and [[Western Europe]]an influence.

The island is dominated by two mountain ranges, the [[Troodos Mountains]] and the [[Kyrenia Mountains]] or Pentadaktylos, and the central plain, the [[Mesaoria]], between them. The Troodos Mountains cover most of the southern and western portions of the island and account for roughly half its area. The narrow [[Kyrenia Mountains|Kyrenia Range]] extends along the northern coastline. It is not as high as the Troodos Mountains, and it occupies substantially less area. The two mountain ranges run generally parallel to the [[Taurus Mountains]] on the Turkish mainland, the outlines of which are visible from northern Cyprus. Coastal lowlands, varying in width, surround the island.

[[Geopolitics|Geopolitically]], the island is divided into four segments. The [[Republic of Cyprus]], the only internationally recognized government, occupies the southern 60% of the island, and has been a [[member state of the European Union]] since 1 May 2004. The "[[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]]", is diplomatically recognized only by Turkey, occupies the northern one-third of the island, around 36% of the territory. The [[United Nations]]-controlled [[Green Line (Cyprus)|Green Line]] is a buffer zone that separates the two and it is about 4%. Lastly, two areas—[[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]]—remain under British sovereignty for military purposes, collectively forming the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia (SBA). The SBAs are located on the southern coast of the island and together encompass 254&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or 2.8% of the island.

==Terrain==
[[File:Geology of Cyprus-SkiriotissaMine.jpg|thumb|left|Skiriotissa mine]]
[[File:CyprusFromTheISS(cropped).jpg|thumb|This image, photographed from the [[International Space Station]] in 2013, shows the three distinct geologic regions of the island. In the central and western part of the island is the Troodos Massif, a mountain range whose surface layer is mostly basaltic lava rock, and whose maximum elevation is {{convert|1952|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. Running in a thin arc along the northeast margin of the island is Cyprus's second mountain range, a limestone formation called the Kyrenia Range. The space between these ranges is home to the capital [[Nicosia]], visible as a grayish-brown patch near the image's center.]]
[[File:Cyprus topo.png|thumb|Topography]]
The rugged [[Troodos Mountains]], whose principal range stretches from Pomos Point in the northwest almost to Larnaca Bay on the east, are the single most conspicuous feature of the landscape. Intensive uplifting and folding in the formative period left the area highly fragmented, so that subordinate ranges and spurs veer off at many angles, their slopes incised by steep-sided valleys. In the southwest, the mountains descend in a series of stepped foothills to the coastal plain.

While the Troodos Mountains are a massif formed of molten igneous rock, the Kyrenia Range is a narrow limestone ridge that rises suddenly from the plains. Its easternmost extension becomes a series of foothills on the [[Karpass Peninsula]]. That peninsula points toward Asia Minor, to which Cyprus belongs geologically.

Even the highest peaks of the [[Kyrenia Range]] are hardly more than half the height of the great dome of the Troodos massif, [[Mount Olympus (Cyprus)|Mount Olympus]] ({{convert|1952|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}),&lt;ref name="Embassy climate"&gt;{{cite web|title = Country Profile: Climate|publisher = Official Website of the Embassy of the Republic of Cyprus in Washington D.C.|url = http://www.cyprusembassy.net/home/index.php?module=page&amp;pid=11|accessdate = 2006-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; but their seemingly inaccessible, jagged slopes make them considerably more spectacular. [[United Kingdom|British]] writer [[Lawrence Durrell]], in [[Bitter Lemons]], wrote of the Troodos as "an unlovely jumble of crags and heavyweight rocks" and of the Kyrenia Range as belonging to "the world of [[Gothic art|Gothic]] [[Europe]], its lofty crags studded with crusader castles."

Rich copper deposits were discovered in antiquity on the slopes of the Troodos. The massive sulfide deposits formed as a part of an [[ophiolite]] complex at a [[Mid-ocean ridge|spreading center]] under the Mediterranean Sea which was [[Tectonics|tectonically]] uplifted during the [[Pleistocene]] and emplaced in its current location.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.moa.gov.cy/moa/gsd/gsd.nsf/dmlTroodos_en/dmlTroodos_en?OpenDocument Cyprus Geologic Survey&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drainage==
In much of the island, access to a year-round supply of water is difficult. This is traditionally attributed to deforestation which damaged the island's drainage system through erosion, but Grove and Rackham question this view.&lt;ref&gt;A.T. Grove, Oliver Rackham, ''The Nature of Mediterranean Europe: An Ecological History'', Yale, 2001.  {{ISBN|0-300-08443-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A network of winter rivers rises in the Troodos Mountains and flows out from them in all directions. The Yialias River and the [[Pedieos|Pedhieos River]] flow eastward across the Mesaoria into Famagusta Bay; the Serraghis River flows northwest through the [[Morphou]] plain. All of the island's rivers, however, are dry in the summer. An extensive system of dams and waterways has been constructed to bring water to farming areas.

The Mesaoria is the agricultural heartland of the island, but its productiveness for wheat and barley depends very much on winter rainfall; other crops are grown under irrigation. Little evidence remains that this broad, central plain, open to the sea at either end, was once covered with rich forests whose timber was coveted by ancient conquerors for their sailing vessels. The now-divided capital of the island, Nicosia, lies in the middle of this central plain.

== Natural vegetation ==
[[File:Cyprus countryside on the way to Troodos Mountains in the late summer Republic of Cyprus.jpg|thumb|left|Cyprus countryside on the way to Troodos Mountains during the summer]]
Despite its small size, Cyprus has a variety of natural vegetation. This includes forests of conifers and broadleaved trees such as ''[[Pinus brutia]]'', [[Cedrus|cedar]], [[cypress]]es and [[oak]]s. Ancient authors write that most of Cyprus, even Messaoria, was heavily forested, and there are still considerable forests on the Troodos and Kyrenia ranges, and locally at lower altitudes. About 17% of the whole island is classified as woodland. Where there is no forest, tall shrub communities of [[golden oak]] (''Quercus alnifolia''), strawberry tree (''[[Arbutus andrachne]]''), terebinth (''[[Pistacia terebinthus]]''), olive (''[[Olea europaea]]''), kermes oak (''[[Quercus coccifera]]'') and styrax (''[[Styrax officinalis]]'') are found, but such [[Maquis shrubland|maquis]] is uncommon. Over most of the island untilled ground bears a grazed covering of [[garrigue]], largely composed of low bushes of [[Cistus]], ''[[Genista sphacelata]]'', ''[[Calycotoime villosa]]'', ''[[Lithospermum hispidulum]]'', ''[[Phaganalon rupestre]]'' and, locally, ''[[Pistacia lentiscus]]''. Where grazing is excessive this covering is soon reduced, and an impoverished [[Garrigue|batha]] remains, consisting principally of ''[[Thymus capitatus]]'', ''[[Sarcopoterium spinosum]]'', and a few stunted herbs.

==Climate==

[[File:Cyprus.A2002292.1045.500m.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Dust storm|Sandstorm]] in the [[Levant]], October 19, 2002]]
The [[Mediterranean climate]], warm and rather dry, with rainfall mainly between November and March, favors agriculture. In general, the island experiences mild wet winters and dry hot summers. Variations in temperature and rainfall are governed by altitude and, to a lesser extent, distance from the coast. Hot, dry summers from mid-May to mid-September and rainy, rather changeable winters from November to mid-March are separated by short autumn and spring seasons.

'''Ghouta''' ({{lang-ar|غوطة دمشق}} / [[ALA-LC]]: ''Ghūṭat Dimashq'') is a countryside and [[suburb]]an area in southwestern [[Syria]] that surrounds the city of [[Damascus]] along its eastern and southern rim.

==History==
Historically, the area developed as an [[oasis]] formed by the [[Barada]] river around the site where Damascus was founded. The Arab geographer, [[Al-Muqaddasi]] (d. 991), mentions al-Ghouta as being one of the six rural territories belonging to the District of Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;The others being [[Hauran|Hawrān]], [[Batanaea|al-Bathaniyya]], [[Jawlan|al-Jawlān]], al-Biqāʿ and al-Hūla. See: Al-Muqaddasi, ''The Best Divisions for Knowledge of the Regions'' (Being a translation of "Ahsan al-Taqasim fi Maʿrifat al-Aqalim"), Reading 1994, p. 141 {{ISBN|1-873938-14-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since ancient times, canals dug by Damascenes provided irrigation of land on either side of the Barada, increasing the size of the Ghouta to the south and east of the city.&lt;ref name=britanica&gt;{{cite web |title=Damascus - Landscape - City site |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/150420/Damascus#ref392564 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separating the city from the dry grasslands bordering the [[Syrian Desert]], the Ghouta has historically provided its inhabitants with a variety of cereals, vegetables and fruits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.fao.org/farmingsystems/pdf/IFSA/Theme1_Food_Agricultural_Policies.pdf|title = An Analysis of Agriculture-Environment Interactions and Policy Options for Sustainable Agriculture in Eastern Al Ghouta (Syria)|date = 2005|access-date = 17 February 2016|website = |publisher = Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|last = Al Zoughbi|first = Samira|pages = 31|series = Farming Systems and Poverty: Making a Difference -- Proceedings of the 18th International Symposium of the International Farming Systems Association: A Global Learning Opportunity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually the irrigated agricultural area in the Damascus countryside reached a size of {{convert|370|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}. In the 1980s, urban growth from Damascus started replacing agricultural use with housing and industry, shrinking the green zone.&lt;ref name="countrystudy"&gt;{{cite book |title = Syria: a country study |url = https://www.loc.gov/item/87600488/|chapter = Land, Water, and Climate|editor-first = Thomas|editor-last = Collelo|publisher = Federal Research Division, Library of Congress|date = 1988|lccn = 87600488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[Syrian Civil War]], the area was home to about two million people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Syria’s Eastern Ghouta: the latest casualty of war |url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/eastern-ghouta-caught-between-rock-and-hard-place-1997307396 |work=Middle East Eye |date=6 February 2015 |accessdate=18 February 2016 |first=Linah |last=Alsaafin}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 2017 the population was estimated to be about 400,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In Syria region under regime siege, children die of hunger|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20171022-syria-region-under-regime-siege-children-die-hunger|work=France 24|date=22 October 2017|accessdate=23 October 2017|first=Amer|last=Almohibany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Civil uprising phase of the Syrian Civil War|civil unrest]] that began in Syria in March 2011, some eastern Ghouta residents joined the protests against Syrian president [[Bashar Al-Assad]] and joined the [[Syrian rebels]], [[Rif Dimashq offensive (November 2012–February 2013)|expelling Syrian government forces]] by November 2012. In February 2013, Syrian rebels [[Damascus offensive (2013)|captured]] parts of the ring road on the edge of Damascus and entered the [[Jobar|Jobar district]] of the capital city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/world/middleeast/syrian-war-closes-in-on-the-heart-of-damascus.html?pagewanted=1&amp;pagewanted=print | title=Damascus on Edge as War Seeps into Syrian Capital | work=New York Times | date=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Backed by [[Iran]] and [[Hezbollah]], the [[Syrian Arab Army]] counterattacked and in May 2013 began a siege of Eastern Ghouta.

In mid-2017, the main rebel faction in the area was [[Jaysh al-Islam]], based in [[Douma, Syria|Douma]] (with an estimated 10-15,000 fighters in the region in early 2018&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/which-rebel-groups-are-fighting-in-syrias-eastern-ghouta/a-42663501 Which rebel groups are fighting in Syria's eastern Ghouta?], Deutsche Welle, 20.02.2018&lt;/ref&gt;). The second largest was [[Faylaq al-Rahman]], an official affiliate of the [[Free Syrian Army]] (FSA), controlling much of central and western parts of Ghouta, including the [[Jobar]] and [[Ain Terma]] districts. [[Ahrar al-Sham]] (based in [[Harasta]]) and [[Tahrir al-Sham]] (HTS - controlling smaller districts such as [[Arbin, Syria|Arbin]], [[al-Ashari]] and [[Bait Naim]], with an estimated strength in the area of 500 in February 2018&lt;ref name="BBCMonitoring"&gt;[https://monitoring.bbc.co.uk/product/c1douzrw Explainer: Who's fighting whom in Syria's Ghouta?], BBC Monitoring, 22 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt;) had a far smaller presence.&lt;ref&gt;Wisam Franjieh [https://www.newsdeeply.com/syria/articles/2017/08/01/in-besieged-eastern-ghouta-rebel-infighting-increases-civilian-suffering In Besieged Eastern Ghouta, Rebel Infighting Increases Civilian Suffering], Syria Deeply, Aug. 1, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The residents described the life under the control of Islamist rebels as "hell" to a [[Channel 4]] correspondent as they were forcibly conscripted, prevented from leaving and had no water and electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Channel 4]], [https://www.channel4.com/news/inside-ghouta-as-syrian-government-fully-controls-damascus-for-the-first-time-in-seven-years Inside Ghouta as Syrian government fully controls Damascus for the first time in seven years], 24 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, the Syrian army launched an [[Rif Dimashq offensive (February 2018)|operation]] to dislodge rebels from the area. In early March 2018, the Syrian army had captured 59% of the Eastern Ghouta pocket. On 7 April 2018, at least 48 people were reportedly killed in [[Douma chemical attack|a chemical attack]] in Douma, which resulted in an [[2018 bombing of Damascus and Homs|armed response]] from the [[United States]], [[France]], and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Loveluck|first1=Louiusa|title=Dozens killed in apparent chemical weapons attack on civilians in eastern Ghouta — rescue workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/dozens-killed-in-apparent-chemical-weapons-attack-on-civilians-in-eastern-ghouta--rescue-workers/2018/04/08/231bba18-3ac0-11e8-af3c-2123715f78df_story.html|website=Washington Post|publisher=Fred Ryan|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;On 14 April 2018, the Syrian Army officially declared Eastern Ghouta to be free of militants, securing it under government control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-ghouta/syrian-army-announces-eastern-ghouta-free-of-militants-state-media-idUSKBN1HL184|title=Syrian army announces eastern Ghouta free of militants: state media|date=14 April 2018|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19896">The following is an incomplete '''list of South American [[stadium]]s'''. They are ordered by their total capacity, that is the maximum number of spectators the stadium can accommodate (not necessarily meaning [[seating capacity]]). Stadiums with a capacity of 30,000 or more are included.

Most large stadiums in South America are used for [[association football]], with some having running tracks for [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]].

The '''Magellanic subpolar forests''' ({{Lang-es|Bosque Subpolar Magallánico}}) are a [[terrestrial ecoregion]] of southernmost South America, covering parts of southern [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]],&lt;ref&gt;World Wildlife Fund; C.Michael Hogan. 2010. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Magellanic_subpolar_forests?topic=58073 ''Magellanic subpolar forests''. Encyclopedia of Earth, National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC]&lt;/ref&gt; and are part of the [[Neotropic]] [[ecozone]]. It is a [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]] ecoregion, and contains the world's southernmost forests.

==Setting==
The Magellanic subpolar forests ecoregion lies to the west of the [[Andes Mountains]], which run north-south for most of their length but curve eastward near the southern tip of South America, terminating at the archipelago of [[Tierra del Fuego]]. The Magellanic ecoregion was covered by glaciers during the last [[ice age]], and the landscape is deeply dissected by [[fjord]]s, with numerous islands, inlets, and channels, including the [[Strait of Magellan]], which separates Tierra del Fuego from the South American mainland and is the route taken by Portuguese explorer [[Ferdinand Magellan]] from the South Atlantic to the South Pacific. 
North of roughly 48° south latitude lies the [[Valdivian temperate rain forests]] ecoregion, which shares many affinities with the Magellanic ecoregion in plant and animal life. To the east lie the drier [[Temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|temperate grasslands and shrublands]] ecoregions of [[Patagonia]], which are in the rain shadow of the Andean and Fuegian mountains.

==Climate==
The Andean and Fuegan mountains intercept moisture-laden westerly winds, creating [[temperate rain forest]] conditions, while the cold oceanic [[Humboldt Current]], which runs up the west coast of South America, and the cold [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]], which runs from west to east through the [[Southern Ocean]], keep the Magellanic ecoregion cool and wet, and the strong oceanic influence moderates seasonal temperature extremes. Average annual temperatures vary from {{convert|6|°C|°F|1}} in the north to {{convert|3|°C|°F|1}} in the south and annual rainfall from {{convert|4000|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} in the west to {{convert|450|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in the east. Snowfalls can occur even in summer. Fog is very frequent. Very strong winds whip the region and these compel trees to grow in twisted and bent shapes fighting against the wind; and people call them "[[flag tree]]s".

==Flora==
Like the Valdivian ecoregion, the Magellanic subpolar forests are a refuge for the [[Antarctic flora]], and share many plant families with the temperate forest ecoregions of [[New Zealand]], [[Tasmania]], and [[Australia]], especially the [[southern beech]], (''Nothofagus''). Species of ''{{lang|la|Nothofagus}}'', including ''{{lang|la|N. betuloides}}'', ''{{lang|la|N. antarctica}}'', and ''{{lang|la|N. pumilio}}'', are the characteristic trees of the Magellanic ecoregion. The Magellanic ecoregion does not have the same species richness as the milder Valdivian ecoregion, both on account of its colder climate and its recent glaciation. The advancing glaciers caused the forests to retreat far to the north, and the region was gradually reforested starting about 10,000 years ago when the climate warmed and the glaciers began retreating.

The Magellanic ecoregion has three main plant communities: the [[Magellanic moorland]], the evergreen Magellanic rainforest, and the deciduous Magellanic forest.

The Magellanic moorland occurs on the western edge of the region where the oceanic influence is strongest. High rainfall of &lt;!-- {{convert|5000|mm/y|in/y|abbr=on}} 5000&amp;nbsp;mm/year (200 in/year) --&gt; {{convert|5000|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}/year is typical of the moorland, as are cool temperatures, strong winds, bad drainage conditions, and rocky ground with generally thin soil. Most of the moorland consists of a mosaic of low-growing plants, including dwarf shrubs and wind-sheared trees, cushion plants, grasses, and mosses. These plants can form an underlayer of blanket peat and boggy areas. In more sheltered areas, small stands of evergreen forest can be found, which include ''[[Nothofagus betuloides]]'', ''[[Drimys winteri]]'', ''[[Lepidothamnus fonkii]]'', and ''[[Pilgerodendron|Pilgerodendron uviferum]]''.

Farther from the ocean, in more moderate areas less exposed to the oceanic wind and rain, moorland yields to evergreen Magellanic rainforest. The Magellanic rainforest is mostly made up  ''[[Nothofagus betuloides]]'', together with other evergreen trees, most often ''Drimys winteri'' and ''Pilgerodendron uviferum'', and occasionally ''[[Embothrium coccineum]]'' and ''[[Maytenus magellanica]]''. In the better established forest stands, a species-rich [[shrub layer]] may develop. In exposed, rocky, and poorly drained areas, pockets of deciduous ''{{lang|la|Nothofagus antarctica}}'' and the typical moorland species can be found.

As one moves further east, where rainfall decreases to &lt;!-- 800–850&amp;nbsp;mm/year (30-33 in/year) --&gt; {{convert|800|-|850|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}/year, ''{{lang|la|Nothofagus betuloides}}'' becomes less dominant and mixes with deciduous ''{{lang|la|Nothofagus pumilio}}'' in the transition to the deciduous forest community. The Magellanic deciduous forest is made up mostly of ''{{lang|la|Nothofagus pumilio}}'' and ''{{lang|la|Nothofagus antarctica}}''. When one reaches the drier rain shadow east of the mountains, the forests disappear, transitioning to the grassland ecoregions of Patagonia.

In open spaces some succulent fruits can be found: [[beach strawberry|Chilean strawberry]] (''Fragaria chiloensis''), and [[calafate]] (''Berberis buxifolia''); they used to complement the nourishment of the (now almost nonexistent) native peoples.

These forests are peerless in their endurance of cold summers (averaging {{convert|9|°C|°F|1|abbr=none|disp=or}} at sea level) and violent subpolar [[wind]]s. Due to these traits, Magellanic forests' tree species are exported to other parts of the world such as the [[Faroe Islands]] and neighboring [[archipelago]]s with similar conditions where trees from other [[biome]]s in the world cannot grow. The following species from [[Tierra del Fuego]], [[Drimys winteri]], [[Nothofagus antarctica]], [[Nothofagus pumilio]], and [[Nothofagus betuloides]], have been successfully introduced to the Faroe Islands. As a general rule, Fueguian trees show better signs of acclimation than those from Continental Northern Europe to conditions in the Faroe Islands.&lt;ref&gt;Højgaard, A., J. Jóhansen, and S. Ødum (eds) 1989. A century of tree planting in the Faroe Islands. Føroya Frodskaparfelag, Torshavn.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fauna==
The Magellanic subpolar forests are home to the southern [[pudú]], the world's smallest [[deer]], which stands only 35–45&amp;nbsp;cm (14–18 inches) high at the shoulder. Other animal species include the [[cougar]] (''Puma concolor'') and the endangered [[southern river otter]] (''Lontra provocax''). Endemic [[rodent]]s include the Patagonian rat, the mole mouse, and the [[viscacha]], a small rodent that looks almost like a rabbit with a long, bushy tail.

Native [[bird]] species include the [[Magellanic woodpecker]] (''Campephilus magellanicus''), [[Patagonian sierra-finch]] (''Phrygilus patagonicus''), [[Patagonian mockingbird]] (''Mimus patagonicus''), and [[Andean condor]] (''Vultur gryphus'').

The rich Magellanic coastal waters and numerous rocky islets host many seabirds, including [[albatross]]es, [[auk]]s, [[gull]]s, [[tern]]s, and [[penguin]]s.

'''Johann Georg Vogt''' (30 June 1669 – 17 August 1730),&lt;ref name="bartel"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartel|first1=Dietrich|title=Musica Poetica: Musical-Rhetorical Figures in German Baroque Music|date=1 July 1997|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|page=127|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=p45OwxQB05YC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;dq=mauritius+vogt&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vGb70fTb-N&amp;sig=LQ8PrxDXWb7HkmDNPBIrO6HpUdY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwje4_PWm4TTAhULvBQKHTE9AVkQ6AEILjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=mauritius%20vogt&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; better known by his monastic name '''Mauritius Vogt''', was a geographer, cartographer, musician, historian and a member of the [[Cistercian Order]].

==Life==
[[Image:Johann Georg Vogt alias Mauritius Vogt (Portrait).tiff|right|thumb|Mauritius Vogt]]
Vogt was born in [[Bad Königshofen]], Bavaria.&lt;ref name="bartel"/&gt; As a child he came with his father, a [[geodesy|geodesist]], to a monastery in [[Plasy]] in Western [[Bohemia]]. He was educated there, before studying Philosophy and Theology at [[Charles University]] in [[Prague]].&lt;ref name="bartel"/&gt; After graduating, he returned to Plasy and joined the order in 1692,&lt;ref name="bartel"/&gt; taking the monastic name Mauritius. He was ordained as a priest in 1698.&lt;ref name="bartel"/&gt; Apart from occasional trips to Italy and Germany to study music,&lt;ref name="bartel"/&gt; and temporary stays at the residences of his aristocratic supporters, most of his later life is closely connected with the monastery in [[Plasy]] and its surroundings. His main focus while at the monastery was music; he was the organist and music director of the monastery, as well as a composer.&lt;ref name="bartel"/&gt; In 1724 he was appointed Superior at [[Mariánská Týnice]], a pilgrimage church connected to the monastery, and he held this position until his death.&lt;ref name="bartel"/&gt;

==Works==
Vogt’s first published and most famous work entitled ''[[Das jetzlebende Königreich Böhmen]]'', an introduction to the geography and history of [[Bohemia]], was printed in 1712 in [[Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Leipzig]]. The book became celebrated especially for its copperplate illustrations, maps and plans. It includes a total of 45 engravings depicting views and ground plans of Bohemian towns, castles, and monasteries, as well as a large detailed map of Bohemia. This highly valued map was added to the book as a separate supplement, and is thus rarely found in volumes today.

''[[Das jetzlebende Königreich Böhmen]]'' contains an engraving depicting [[Roudnice]], the seat of the [[Lobkowicz]] family, in the early 18th century, including the ruined bridge over the [[Elbe river]]. The original Gothic bridge constructed in 1333–1340 (one of the first stone bridges built in Bohemia) was first damaged by the Army of the Czech Estates shortly after the [[Battle of White Mountain]] in 1620 and then completely demolished by Swedish troops in 1634. Though there was a plan to reconstruct the bridge over the river during the radical rebuilding of the castle and the town under [[Václav Eusebius František, Prince of Lobkowicz|Václav Eusebius, 2nd Prince Lobkowicz]] in the late 17th century, a new bridge over the river was constructed only in 1910.

Among the engravings included in the book is a view of the capital [[Prague]], divided into two parts. The first copperplate presents the [[Prague Castle]], [[Lesser Town]] and [[Charles Bridge]], while the second part depicts a view over the river [[Vltava]] toward the [[Old Town]], [[New Town, Prague|New Town]] and the fort [[Vyšehrad]]. The copperplates were engraved by a German engraver, [[Christoph Friedrich Krieger]].

An exhibition of Vogt's work was hosted at the [[Lobkowicz Palace]] in [[Prague]], until 31 May 2015.

The '''Miquelon Island (Northeast Coast) Important Bird Area''' is an area of open sea immediately off the coast of [[Miquelon Island]] in the small French archipelago of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] off the southern coast of [[Newfoundland]] in the North [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The 4000&amp;nbsp;[[hectare|ha]] site lies off the north and east sides of the island from the waters around Cape Miquelon to the eastern side of [[La Dune]] isthmus. It has been identified as an [[Important Bird Area]] (IBA) by [[BirdLife International]] because it supports a wintering population of [[red-necked grebe]]s.&lt;ref name=bli&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.birdlife.org |title= Miquelon Island (Northeast Coast)|accessdate=2013-09-01 |work= Important Bird Areas factsheet |first= |last= |publisher= BirdLife International |year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10385">The '''Montréal Process''', officially known as the '''Montréal Process Working Group on Criteria and Indicators for the Conservation and Sustainable Management of Temperate and Boreal Forests''', is a voluntary agreement on [[sustainable forest management]]. It was formed in Geneva, Switzerland in June 1994 as a result of the '''[[Forest Principles]]''' developed at the 1992 [[Earth Summit]].

== Background ==

The Montréal Process was formed in June 1994 as a direct response to the Rio Forest Principles, a document that was created at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development suggesting recommendations for sustainable management of forests (The Montréal Process, 2015, p. 8). One of the first orders of business for the Montréal Process Working Group was to create and implement criteria and indicators for the conservation and sustainable management of forests (Montréal Process, 2014, para. 1).

In February 1995, countries in the Montréal Process adopted the Santiago Declaration which confirmed their commitment to the conservation and sustainable management of forests. They completed their first order of business by endorsing seven criteria and sixty-seven associated indicators as guidelines for policy makers to refer to in determining national forest trends and advancing toward a more sustainable forest management (The Montréal Process, 2015, p. 8). 

In 2003, the Montréal Process countries created and published their first country reports which were highlighted in the Montréal Process First Forest Overview Report 2003. They also adopted the Québec City Declaration in September 2003 which set a vision for the Montréal Process for the timeframe from 2003 until 2008 (The Montréal Process, 2015, p. 8).

In November 2007, the member countries revised the first six criteria in [[Buenos Aires]] and used these improvements to prepare the second country reports in 2009 once again showing their commitment for the sustainable management of forests (The Montréal Process, 2015, p. 8). In addition to this, they also established the framework for the Montréal Process Strategic Action Plan: 2009-2015 which serves as the overall guiding document for the Montréal Process and helps in efforts of communicating with the international community the Montréal Process’s objectives and priorities (The Montréal Process, 2015, p. 9).

In 2009, the Montréal Process countries revised the seventh criteria in South Korea and trimmed the criteria and indicators to seven criteria and fifty-four indicators (The Montréal Process, 2015, p. 9).

Although there has been many successful initiatives, there is still considerable room for improvement of the country reporting practices. Chandran and Innes, researchers at the Department of Forest Resources Management, University of British Columbia, stated “current reporting practices, if not corrected, will create difficulties in communicating progress in sustainable forest management amongst countries” (Chandran, 2014, p. 103).

== Member countries ==

Becoming a member of the Working Group is completely voluntary and members currently includes countries from both the northern and southern hemisphere that cover a vast array of natural and social conditions (The Montreal Process, 2015, para. 3). Currently there are twelve members of the Montréal Process and those countries are: [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Chile]], [[China]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Mexico]], [[New Zealand]], [[Russia]], [[United States]] and [[Uruguay]] (The Montréal Process, 2015, p. 5).

These member countries account for: (The Montréal Process, 2015, p. 5).
*90% of the temperate and boreal forests (as well as areas of tropical forests)
*58% of planted forests
*49% of the world’s forests
*49% of the world’s roundwood production
*31% of the world’s population

== Criteria and indicators ==

The main goal of sustainable forest management is to maintain a broad, specified range of forest values for an indefinite period of time. It is extremely difficult to assess progress towards the goal, therefore, criteria and indicators are used to make the mission understandable by simplifying the essential components of sustainable forest management by providing a common understanding, as well as a universal framework for describing each individual country’s progress towards sustainability at a national level (The Montreal Process, 2015, para. 4).

The member countries of the Montréal Process agreed upon initially seven criteria and sixty-seven associated indicators before trimming it down to seven criteria and fifty-four indicators. The Montréal Process Working Group settled on these criteria and indicators after consulting with various professionals such as forest managers and users, researchers, private industry, technical and policy experts from non-member countries, and the international scientific community (The Montréal Process, 2015, p. 8).

The seven criteria the member countries agreed to are: Conservation of biological diversity, Maintenance of productive capacity of forest ecosystems, Maintenance of forest ecosystem health and vitality, Conservation and maintenance of soil and water resources, Maintenance of forest contribution to global carbon cycles, Maintenance and enhancement of long-term multiple socio-economic benefits to meet the needs of societies, Legal, institutional and economic framework for forest conservation and sustainable management. (The Montréal Process, 2015, p. 8)

== Strategic action plan ==

The Montréal Process Strategic Action Plan is the definitive guiding document for the Montréal Process Working Group. It is also an extremely useful tool in communicating the Montréal Process’s objectives and priorities to member countries, domestic stakeholders and the international community (The Montréal Process, 2015, p. 9). 

The Montréal Process Strategic Action Plan: 2009-2015 is based on the five strategic directions: Enhance the relevance of the Montréal Process criteria and indicators for policymakers, practitioners and others; Strengthen member country capacity to monitor, assess and report on forest trends and progress toward sustainable forest management using the Montréal Process criteria and indicators; Enhance collaboration and cooperation with forest related regional and international organizations and instruments and other criteria and indicator processes; Enhance communication on the value of criteria and indicators and the accomplishments of the Montréal Process; Enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the Montréal Process Working Group and its Technical Advisory Committee and Liaison Office (The Montréal Process, 2015, p. 9).

== Impact ==
The Montréal Process’s criteria and indicators is “a prima facie example of sectoral capture of a normative process” that were agreed to remarkably quick for an intergovernmental agreement, unlike what occurred at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development where efforts in creating a legally-binding forest management agreement was met with constant rejection and failure (Gale, 2014, p. 174).
The sustainable management of forests idea that emerged from the Montréal Process has been highly influential on future sustainable forest management ideas with many forest agreements that were signed after the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development referencing the criteria and indicator processes from the Montréal Process when referring to sustainable management of forests, including, the Non-Legally Binding Instrument on All Types of Forests agreed in 2007 at the United Nations Forum on Forests (Gale, 2014, p. 171).
Some other processes the Montréal Process has influenced is the Helsinki Process, which developed criteria and indicator for European temperate and boreal forests, and the Tarapoto Process, which developed criteria and indicator for countries managing tropical forests in Amazonia (Gale, 2014, p. 174).
The Montréal Process has helped member countries in improving their sustainable management of forestry by examining the country’s current needs in the present and in the future allowing them to provide economic, social, and environmental benefits for future generations. Countries such as New Zealand have seen a 50% increase in the volume of sustainable harvesting, an increase in the standing volume of plantation forests, and an increased focus on the health and safety of workers in the forestry industry (Montreal Process, 2016, para. 10).

'''NedGraphics''' is a [[software]]/[[information technology]] company specialized in [[infrastructure]], [[civil engineering]], [[Surveying|survey]], [[town planning]] and [[data management]]. NedGraphics is specialized in offering information technology solutions to create, manage &amp; share digital design and geographical information.

== History ==
Since its foundation in 1978, NedGraphics was engaged in GIS Systems, introducing its first AM/FM systems IGOS in 1982.

In 1992 Richard Goossens, who joined the company in 1985, became chief operations GIS.

In 1998 the company went public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/economie/nedgraphics-krijgt-op-16-april-beursnotering~a459435/|title=NedGraphics krijgt op 16 april beursnotering|website=Volkskrant.nl|date=2 April 1998|access-date=2016-06-30|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, NedGraphics acquired the road design activity from EDS International in Capelle aan den IJssel, the aviation activity from Logos International and the GIS-products activities from Engineering Firm Oranjewoud in Heerenveen (now Antea Group), Roccade Industry and Graphical Products.

In 1993, NedGraphics had 19 municipalities as customers. In 2001, it had more than 300 municipalities as customers and provinces, survey, town planning and engineering bureaus as customers in the Benelux.

The '''Nereus Program''' is a global interdisciplinary initiative between the [[Nippon Foundation]] and the [[University of British Columbia]] that was created to further our knowledge of how best to attain sustainability for our world’s oceans.&lt;ref&gt;http://oceans.ubc.ca/research/&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Nippon Foundation and UBC, the program partners with [[University of Cambridge]], [[Duke University]], [[Princeton University]], [[Stockholm University]], United Nations Environment Program-[[World Conservation Monitoring Centre]] and [[Utrecht University]]. The program is built around three core objectives: to conduct collaborative ocean research across the natural and social sciences, to develop an interdisciplinary network of experts that can engage in discussion of complex and multifaceted questions of ocean sustainability, and to transfer these ideas to practical solutions in global policy forums.

==Program leadership==
* '''[[Yoshitaka Ota]]''' is Director (Policy) of the NF-UBC Nereus Program. He is a Research Assistant Professor for the School of Marine and Environmental Affairs at the University of Washington. His main research is anthropology of fishing, assessing current global outlook of indigenous fishing and coastal food security. He also works on ocean governance and policy, marine spatial planning and knowledge communication.
* '''[[William Cheung (Scientist)|William Cheung]]''' is Director (Science) of the NF-UBC Nereus Program and the Principal Investigator of the UBC Nereus Research group since 2014. He is also an Associate Professor at the University of British Columbia. His main research area is on assessing impacts of fishing and climate change on marine ecosystems and their goods and services, and studying ways to reconcile trade-offs in their management.
* '''[[Daniel Pauly]]''' is the Chair of the Nereus Steering Committee and a member of the Advisory Board. He is Professor at the University of British Columbia and the Principal Investigator of the Sea Around Us Program. His research focuses on the global impact of fishing on the world’s oceans and has developed the concept of shifting baseline and fishing down marine food webs.

==Budget==
15 million USD (1.5 million annually for 9 years from 2011 to 2019).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nereusprogram.org/about/fellows/ |title=People |publisher=Nereus Program |date= |accessdate=2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Nereus Program is solely funded by the Nippon Foundation, the largest non-governmental foundation in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nippon-foundation.or.jp/en/what/spotlight/ocean_outlook/ |title=Considering the Future of the World’s Oceans |publisher=The Nippon Foundation |date= |accessdate=2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public engagement and policy applications==
The Nereus Program is engaged with policy processes both at international and regional levels. The program has organized side events and workshops together with international organization representatives and national governmental officers.

2017: Side event at the UN Oceans Conference titled “The Role of the Oceans in Sustainability: Benefits of Achieving SDG 14 for all [[Sustainable Development Goals]]", where discussions led by Nereus affiliates were focused on how research indicates that achieving SDG 14 ocean targets contributes to the achievement of other SDG targets in the context of our changing ocean due to climate change and social equity. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nereusprogram.org/event/un-oceans-conference-nf-nereus-program-side-event/&lt;/ref&gt;

2016: Side event at the United Nations Fish Stock Agreement Review Conference titled “Science, Policy and Civil Society: The Role of NGOs in Global Fisheries Management", where ongoing Nereus research on the potential role of civil society within regional fisheries management organizations was presented.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nereusprogram.org/managing-straddling-and-highly-migratory-fish-stocks-nereus-holds-side-event-at-the-un-fish-stocks-agreement-review-conference/&lt;/ref&gt;

2015: Press conference on the Nereus Program report in Tokyo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nippon-foundation.or.jp/en/news/articles/2015/13.html |title=Nippon Foundation Nereus Program Reveals Critical State of World's Oceans in 2050 |publisher=The Nippon Foundation |date=2015-06-30 |accessdate=2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; (covered by 20 international media outlets, including CBS, and five major Japanese newspapers).

2013: Side event at the United Nations Open-ended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea on seafood security and climate change (attended by nine countries representatives including Japan, US and Palau)

==Fellowships==
The Nereus Program provides fellowships to young scholars who conduct their research at participating academic institutes. Since 2011, there have been 30 Nereus Fellows&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nereusprogram.org/about/fellows/ |title=People |publisher=Nereus Program |date= |accessdate=2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; working in various issues on the future of oceans and fisheries. Currently, 11 postdoc and 7 Ph.D. students in the natural and social sciences are participating in the Nereus Program as Nereus Fellows.

Program Alumni have gone on to marine research positions in various institutes, including at the USA [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/about_us/staff/?lname=KEARNEY&amp;fname=Kelly&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of South Carolina]],&lt;ref&gt;http://ww2.biol.sc.edu/~ryk/&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Atomic Energy Agency]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marc_Metian&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ETH Zurich]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tfroelicher.com/about-me-1/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reports==

In May 2017, the Nereus Program released a research report, 'Oceans and Sustainable Development Goals: Co-Benefits, Climate Change and Social Equity', &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.nereusprogram.org/sdg-report/ |title=Nereus Report: Oceans and Sustainable Development Goals: Co-Benefits, Climate Change and Social Equity |publisher=Nereus Program |date=2017-05-31 |accessdate=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; bringing attention to the co-benefits of achieving the ocean goal SDG 14 on other sustainable development goals. Within the report, Nereus affiliate members have highlighted the idea that climate issues and social equity issues are inter-related; thus, this report has deduced that improving the health of our oceans through SDG 14 targets will contribute to the improvement of other areas of society, including, but not limited to, gender equality, sustained economic development, education quality, terrestrial conservation, reduced poverty, and food security. 

In June 2015, the Program released a research report entitled 'Predicting Future Oceans — Climate Change, Oceans &amp; Fisheries',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.nereusprogram.org/nereus-report-predicting-future-oceans-climate-change-oceans-fisheries/ |title=Nereus Report: Predicting Future Oceans — Climate Change, Oceans &amp; Fisheries |publisher=Nereus Program |date=2015-06-30 |accessdate=2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; summarizing the main contributions of the numerous projects undertaken by the members of the Nereus Program and its associated colleagues in cross-disciplinary analyses of the global ocean systems. Specifically, this year’s report discussed global changes that are impacting the marine ecosystems’ seafood production capacity, emerging trends in ocean governance, and socioeconomic changes that are affecting our relationship with the sea.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aquablog.ca/2015/07/nereus-program-releases-report-on-current-and-future-ocean-health/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
The program has produced over 150 peer-reviewed papers in various journals, including ''Science''&lt;ref&gt;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6243/aac4722&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Nature Climate Change''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v3/n3/full/nclimate1691.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Polli:Nation''' is a [[United Kingdom|UK]] social movement which aims to help protect the future of [[pollinators]].

Polli:Nation is the name for schools coming together in clusters to collect data about pollinating insects and make improvements for insects based on what they find. 
 
'Free’ pollination by bees and other insects is worth over £400m to UK agriculture each year according to the UK National Ecosystem Assessment, 2011;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uknea.unep-wcmc.org/ UK National Ecosystem Assessment] 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Polli:Nation is a response to the decline in the [[abundance (ecology)|abundance]] and diversity of [[pollinators]] in the [[UK]], the demand from schools to broaden children and young people’s understanding of the links between [[pollination]] and [[food security]], and the need for more trained [[biodiversity]] data recorders in the UK.

This movement is currently supported by the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hlf.org.uk/about-us/media-centre/press-releases/children-and-communities-across-uk-protect-pollinating-insects#.VUtuBmd0zug Heritage Lottery Fund]&lt;/ref&gt;

As per Law No.40/98/AN in 1998, Burkina Faso adhered to decentralization to provide administrative and financial autonomy to local communities. Most of these, according to their individual articles, were implemented on 2 July 2001.

'''[[Burkina Faso]]''' is divided into 13 administrative [[region]]s. Each region is administered by a [[governor]].

The '''Sea to Sea [[Trail]]''' ({{lang-he|שביל מים לים}}, ''Shvil MiYam LeYam'') is a hiking path that crosses the north of [[Israel]].  Its western end is in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] at [[Achziv]], near the Lebanese border in the far north of the country, and it extends to the [[Sea of Gallilee]], a length of approximately 71 km (44 mi). The trail is marked with different colors in different sections, and takes an average of 3–4 days to complete.&lt;ref name="intdotcom"&gt;http://www.israelnationaltrail.com/INTForum/tabid/469/forumid/11/threadid/425/scope/posts/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The trail was very popular among [[youth organizations]] in the 1950s and 60s.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The [[Hebrew Scouts Movement in Israel]] has been organizing the Sea to Sea hike every year during the [[Passover]] holidays, for 14 years old [[Scouts]] since 1919.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zofim.org.il/pics/file_board/sea%20to%20sea%20trip.pdf About the Sea to Sea Hike&lt;/ref&gt;

The first part of the trail climbs from the Sea of Gallilee through [[Nahal Amud]] to the grave of Rabbi [[Shimon bar Yochai]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goisrael.com/Tourism_Eng/Tourist%20Information/Jewish%20Themes/Jewish_Sites/Pages/The%20Tomb%20of%20Rabbi%20Shimon%20Bar%20Yochai%20jew.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; grave on [[Mount Meron]]. This section of the trail is part of the [[Israel National Trail]]. The second section of the trail goes from Mount Meron through [[Nahal Kziv]] to [[Ma'alot-Tarshiha]]. The third day of the hike follows Nahal Kziv to the sea.&lt;ref name="intdotcom" /&gt;

The '''Standard Geographical Classification''' ('''SGC''') is a system maintained by [[Statistics Canada]] for categorizing and enumerating the [[census geographic units of Canada]].   Each geographic area receives a unique numeric '''code''' ranging from 1 to 10 digits, which extend telescopically to refer to increasingly small areas.  This [[geocode]] is roughly analogous to the [[ONS coding system]] in use in the [[United Kingdom]].

==Regions==
The SGC code format for [[List of regions of Canada|regions]] is &lt;tt&gt;X&lt;/tt&gt;, where ''X'' is a unique identifier incrementing from east to west, then north.

&lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Atlantic Canada]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;2&lt;/tt&gt;: Quebec&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;3&lt;/tt&gt;: Ontario&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;4&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Canadian Prairies|Prairies]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;5&lt;/tt&gt;: British Columbia&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;6&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Northern Canada]]

==Provinces and Territories==
The SGC code format for [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces and territories]] is &lt;tt&gt;XY&lt;/tt&gt;, where
''X'' is the above regional prefix, and ''Y'' is a further identifier incrementing from east to west.  Taken as a single digit, each value of ''Y'' is unique within the province group, or unique within the territory group.

&lt;tt&gt;10&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;11&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Prince Edward Island]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;12&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Nova Scotia]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;13&lt;/tt&gt;: [[New Brunswick]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;24&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Quebec]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;35&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Ontario]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;46&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Manitoba]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;47&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Saskatchewan]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;48&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Alberta]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;59&lt;/tt&gt;: [[British Columbia]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;60&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Yukon]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;61&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Northwest Territories]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;62&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Nunavut]]

==Census divisions==
The SGC code format for [[Census geographic units of Canada|census divisions]] is &lt;tt&gt;XX YY&lt;/tt&gt;, where ''XX'' is the above province/territory code, and ''YY'' is the census division's code, unique within its own province.  Census divisions are generally numbered from east to west.  In some locations, a similar policy to American [[FIPS county code]]s has been adopted, with even-numbered slots being left vacant for future expansion.

Examples:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;10 04&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Division No. 4, Newfoundland and Labrador]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;10 05&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Division No. 5, Newfoundland and Labrador]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;13 08&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Kent County, New Brunswick]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;13 09&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Northumberland County, New Brunswick]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;13 10&lt;/tt&gt;: [[York County, New Brunswick]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;24 64&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Les Moulins Regional County Municipality, Quebec]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;24 65&lt;/tt&gt;: ''Territoire équivalent'' of [[Laval, Quebec|Laval]], Quebec&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;24 66&lt;/tt&gt;: ''Territoire équivalent'' of [[Montreal]], Quebec&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;24 67&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Roussillon Regional County Municipality, Quebec]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;24 68&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Les Jardins-de-Napierville Regional County Municipality, Quebec]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;35 07&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Leeds and Grenville United Counties, Ontario]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;35 08&lt;/tt&gt;: ''[vacant slot]''&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;35 09&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Lanark County, Ontario]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;35 10&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Frontenac County, Ontario|Frontenac]] Census Division, Ontario&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;47 04&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Division No. 4, Saskatchewan]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;48 05&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Division No. 5, Alberta]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;59 01&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Regional District of East Kootenay]], British Columbia&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;59 02&lt;/tt&gt;: ''[vacant slot]''&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;59 03&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Regional District of Central Kootenay]], British Columbia&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;59 04&lt;/tt&gt;: ''[vacant slot]''&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;59 05&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Regional District of Kootenay Boundary]], British Columbia

==Census subdivisions==
The SGC code format for census subdivisions is &lt;tt&gt;XX YY ZZZ&lt;/tt&gt;, where ''XX'' is the province/territory code, ''YY'' is the census division code, and ''ZZZ'' is the census subdivision's code, unique within its own census division.  Census subdivisions are again generally numbered from east to west, and the practice has been to leave even-numbered slots vacant for future expansion.

Examples:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;35 12 001&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Tyendinaga, Ontario]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;35 12 002&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Deseronto, Ontario]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;35 12 003&lt;/tt&gt;: ''[vacant slot]''&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;35 12 004&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory, Ontario]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;35 12 005&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Belleville, Ontario]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;35 12 006&lt;/tt&gt;: ''[vacant slot]''&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;62 04 001&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Sanikiluaq, Nunavut]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;62 04 002&lt;/tt&gt;: ''[vacant slot]''&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;62 04 003&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Iqaluit|Iqaluit, Nunavut]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;62 04 004&lt;/tt&gt;: ''[vacant slot]''&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;62 04 005&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Kimmirut, Nunavut]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;62 04 006&lt;/tt&gt;: ''[vacant slot]''

==Changes in 2007==
Mobile telephone numbers in Honduras increased from seven (7) to eight (8) digits. The new dialling instructions are as follows:
*Dial 9 + seven-digit number for calls placed to subscribers of Celtel (Tigo)
*Dial 8 + seven-digit number for calls placed to subscribers of Digicel Honduras
*Dial 7 + seven-digit number for calls placed to subscribers of Hondutel
*Dial 3 + seven-digit number for calls placed to subscribers of Sercom (Claro)

Fixed numbers in Honduras remained unchanged at seven digits in length until 2010.

The '''Tienstra formula''' is used to solve the [[Resection (orientation)|resection]] problem in [[surveying]], by which the location of a given point is determined by observations of angles to known landmarks from the unknown point.

J.M.Tienstra (1895-1951) was a professor of the Delft university of Technology where he taught the use of [[Barycentric coordinate system|barycentric coordinate]]s in solving the resection problem. It seems most probable that his name became attached to the procedure for this reason, though when, and by whom, the formula was first proposed is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Howard (2006) ''Archaeological Surveying and Mapping: Recording and Depicting the Landscape'' [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gGqCAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=TIENSTRA'S%20FORMULA&amp;pg=PA51#v=onepage&amp;q=TIENSTRA'S%20FORMULA&amp;f=false page 51] Routledge {{ISBN|1134400861}} Retrieved February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tienstra formula ==
The resection problem consists in finding the location of an observer by measuring the angles subtended by lines of sight from the observer to three known points. Tienstra’s formula provides the most compact and elegant solution to this problem.&lt;ref&gt;Porta, J. and Thomas, F. (2009). ''Concise Proof of Tienstra’s Formula.'' [http://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/%28ASCE%290733-9453%282009%29135%3A4%28170%29 J. Surv. Eng.], 135(4), 170–172. Retrieved February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;E_p = \frac{K_1 E_a+K_2 E_b+K_3 E_c}{K_1+K_2+K_3}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;N_p = \frac{K_1 N_a+K_2 N_b+K_3 N_c}{K_1+K_2+K_3}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;K_2 = \frac{1}{cot(B)-cot(\beta)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

It is made up of nine [[Counties of Ireland|counties]], six of which are in [[Northern Ireland]] (a part of the [[United Kingdom]]) and three of which are in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. It is the second largest (after Munster) and second most populous (after Leinster) of Ireland's four provinces, with [[Belfast]] being its biggest city. Unlike the other provinces, Ulster has a high percentage of [[Protestantism in Ireland|Protestants]], making up almost half of its population. English is the main language and [[Ulster English]] the main dialect. A minority also speak Irish, and there are [[Gaeltacht]] (Irish-speaking regions) in southern Londonderry, the Gaeltacht Quarter of Belfast and in Donegal, where 25% of the total Gaeltacht population of Ireland is located.&lt;ref&gt;http://census.cso.ie/sapmap2011/Results.aspx?Geog_Type=GA&amp;Geog_Code=02&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lough Neagh]], in the east, is the largest lake in the [[British Isles]], while [[Lough Erne]] in the west is one of its largest lake networks. The main mountain ranges are the [[Mourne Mountains|Mournes]], [[Sperrins]], [[Blue Stack Mountains|Croaghgorms]] and [[Derryveagh Mountains]].

Historically, Ulster lay at the heart of the [[Gaels|Gaelic]] world made up of [[Gaelic Ireland]], [[History of Scotland|Scotland]] and the [[Isle of Man]]. According to tradition, in [[Protohistory of Ireland|ancient Ireland]] it was one of the [[Provinces of Ireland|fifths]] ({{lang-ga|cúige}}) ruled by a ''[[Rí#Rí ruirech|rí ruirech]]'', or "king of over-kings". It is named after the overkingdom of [[Ulaid]], in the east of the province, which was in turn named after the Ulaid folk. The other overkingdoms in Ulster were [[Airgíalla]] and [[Northern Uí Néill|Ailech]]. After the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] in the 12th century, eastern Ulster was conquered by the [[Anglo-Normans]] and became the [[Earldom of Ulster]]. By the late 14th century the Earldom had collapsed and the [[O'Neill dynasty]] had come to dominate most of Ulster, claiming the title [[List of kings of Ulster|King of Ulster]]. Ulster became the most thoroughly Gaelic and independent of Ireland's provinces. Its rulers resisted [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|English encroachment]] but were defeated in the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]] (1594–1603). King [[James VI and I|James I]] then colonized Ulster with English-speaking Protestant settlers from Britain, in the [[Plantation of Ulster]]. This led to the founding of many of Ulster's towns. The inflow of Protestant settlers and migrants also led to bouts of [[Sectarianism|sectarian]] violence with Catholics, notably during the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641|1641 rebellion]] and the [[Armagh disturbances]]. Along with the rest of Ireland, Ulster became part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] in 1801. In the early 20th century, moves towards [[Irish Home Rule movement|Irish self-rule]] were opposed by many [[Ulster Protestants]], sparking the [[Home Rule Crisis]]. This, and the subsequent [[Irish War of Independence]], led to the [[partition of Ireland]]. Six Ulster counties became Northern Ireland, a self-governing territory within the United Kingdom, while the rest of Ireland became the [[Irish Free State]], now the Republic of Ireland.

Ulster has no official function for local government purposes in either country. However, for the purposes of [[ISO 3166-2]], Ulster is used to refer to the three counties of Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan only, which are given country sub-division code "IE-U".&lt;ref&gt;ISO 3166-2 Newsletter II-1, 19 February 2010, which gives "Ulster" as the official English name and "Ulaidh" as the official Irish name of the province, citing "Ordnance Survey Office, Dublin 1993" as its source – [http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_3166-2_newsletter_ii-1_corrected_2010-02-19.pdf http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_3166-2_newsletter_ii-1_corrected_2010-02-19.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The name is also used by various organisations such as cultural and sporting bodies.

==Terminology==
The [[Place names in Irish|name]] Ulster has several possible derivations: from the [[Norse language|Norse]] name "Uladztir", which is an adaptation of ''Ulaidh'' and ''tir'', the [[Irish language|Irish]] for "land";&lt;ref name="Bardon"&gt;Jonathan Bardon; ''A History of Ulster'', page 27. The Blackstaff Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-85640-764-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or similarly it may be derived from ''Ulaidh'' plus the Norse genitive ''s'' followed by the Irish ''tir''.&lt;ref name="Clontarf"&gt;Seán Duffy; ''Brian Boru and the Battle of Clontarf'', page 26. Gill &amp; Macmillan, 2014. {{ISBN|978-0-7171-6207-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested to have derived from ''Uladh'' plus the Norse suffix ''ster'' (meaning place), which was common in the [[Shetland Islands]] and [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oo1DAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA182#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |author=Rev. Isaac Taylor |year=1865 |accessdate=5 August 2015 |title=Words and Places: Or, Etymological Illustrations of History, Ethnology, and Geography |publisher=Macmillan &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newulsterbiography.co.uk/index.php/home/viewPerson/2065 |accessdate=5 August 2015 |title=Professor Sir John Byers (1853 - 1920) |author=Richard Froggatt |publisher=Ulster History Circle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish name, ''Cúige Uladh'', means the "province of the [[Ulaid]]" (''Ulaidh'' in modern Irish), with the term cúige formerly referring to a fifth. The Ulaidh were a group of tribes who dwelt in the region.

''Ulaidh'' has historically been anglicised as ''Ulagh'' or ''Ullagh''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraryireland.com/topog/D/Down-County-of.php County Down], ''A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland'' (1837)&lt;/ref&gt; and Latinised as ''Ulidia'' or ''Ultonia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PFFXAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Publications|date=26 March 2018|publisher=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter two have yielded the terms ''Ulidian'' and ''Ultonian''. The Irish word for someone or something from Ulster is ''Ultach'', and this can be found in the surnames MacNulty, MacAnulty, and Nulty, which all derive from ''Mac an Ultaigh'', meaning "son of the Ulsterman".&lt;ref name="Surnames"&gt;Robert Bell; ''The book of Ulster Surnames'', page 180. The Blackstaff Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-85640-602-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Words that have been used in English are ''Ullish'' and ''Ulsterman''/''Ulsterwoman''.

==Geography and political sub-divisions==
[[File:Ulster counties.svg|thumb|270px|Ulster (coloured), showing Northern Ireland in orange and the Republic of Ireland part in green]]
Ulster has a population of just over 2 million people and an area of {{convert|21552|km2|sqmi}}. About 62% of the area of Ulster is in the UK while the remaining 38% is in the Republic of Ireland. Ulster's biggest city, [[Belfast]], has an urban population of over half a million inhabitants, making it the [[List of settlements on the island of Ireland by population|second-largest city on the island of Ireland]] and the [[List of urban areas in the United Kingdom|10th largest urban area]] in the UK. &lt;!-- Note to editors: the agreed compromise for the Derry/Londonderry naming dispute is that the city shall be Derry and the county shall be Londonderry.
--&gt;
Six of Ulster's nine [[Counties of Ireland|counties]], [[County Antrim|Antrim]], [[County Armagh|Armagh]], [[County Down|Down]], [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]], [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]] and [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]], including the former parliamentary boroughs of [[Belfast]] and [[Londonderry (parliamentary borough)|Londonderry]], form [[Northern Ireland]] which remained part of the United Kingdom after the [[partition of Ireland]] in 1921. Three Ulster counties – [[County Cavan|Cavan]], [[County Donegal|Donegal]] and [[County Monaghan|Monaghan]] – form part of the [[Republic of Ireland]]. About half of Ulster's population lives in counties Antrim and Down. Across the nine counties, according to the aggregate UK [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 Census]] for Northern Ireland, and the ROI 2011 Census for counties Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan, there is a [[Roman Catholic]] majority over [[Protestant]] of 50.8% to 42.7%.&lt;ref&gt;"Community Background", 2011 Census, for NI, and "Religion", 2011 Census, for RoI&lt;/ref&gt;

While the traditional counties continue to demarcate areas of [[local government in the Republic of Ireland]], this is no longer the case in Northern Ireland. Since 1974, the traditional counties have a [[ceremonial county|ceremonial]] role only. [[Local government in Northern Ireland]] is today demarcated by 11 districts.

==Physical geography==
The biggest lake in the [[British Isles]], [[Lough Neagh]], lies in eastern Ulster. The province's highest point, [[Slieve Donard]] ({{convert|848|m|ft}}), stands in County Down. The most northerly point in Ireland, [[Malin Head]], is in County Donegal, as are the sixth-highest ({{convert|601|m|ft}}) sea [[cliffs]] in Europe, at [[Slieve League]], and the province's largest island, [[Arranmore]]. The most easterly point in Ireland is also in Ulster, in [[County Down]], and the most westerly point in the UK is in [[County Fermanagh]]. The longest river in the British Isles, the [[River Shannon|Shannon]], rises at the [[Shannon Pot]] in County Cavan with underground tributaries from County Fermanagh. [[Volcano|Volcanic activity]] in eastern Ulster led to the formation of the [[Antrim Plateau]] and the [[Giant's Causeway]], one of Ireland's three [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s. Ulster also has a significant [[drumlin]] belt.  The geographical centre of Ulster lies between the villages of [[Pomeroy, County Tyrone|Pomeroy]] and [[Carrickmore]] in County Tyrone. In terms of area, County Donegal is the largest county in all of Ulster.

==Transport==

===Air===
The province's main airport is [[Belfast International Airport]] (popularly called Aldergrove Airport), which is located at [[Aldergrove, Northern Ireland|Aldergrove]], 11.5 miles northwest of Belfast near [[Antrim, County Antrim|Antrim]]. [[George Best Belfast City Airport]] (sometimes referred to as "the City Airport" or "the Harbour Airport") is another, smaller airport which is located at [[Sydenham railway station, Northern Ireland|Sydenham]] in Belfast. The [[City of Derry Airport]] is located at [[Eglinton, County Londonderry|Eglinton]], {{convert|13|km|mi|0}} east of the city of [[Derry]]. There is also [[Donegal Airport]] ({{lang-ga|Aerfort Dhún na nGall}}), popularly known as Carrickfinn Airport, which is located in [[The Rosses]].

===Rail===
Railway lines are run by [[Northern Ireland Railways]] (NIR). Belfast to Bangor and Belfast to Lisburn are strategically the most important routes on the network with the greatest number of passengers and largest profit margins. The [[Belfast-Derry railway line]] connecting [[Londonderry railway station]], via [[Coleraine railway station|Coleraine]], [[Ballymoney railway station|Ballymoney]], [[Ballymena railway station|Ballymena]] and [[Antrim railway station|Antrim]], with [[Lanyon Place railway station|Lanyon Place]] and [[Belfast Great Victoria Street railway station|Belfast Great Victoria Street]] is a noted scenic route. Belfast is also connected with [[Carrickfergus railway station|Carrickfergus]] and [[Larne Harbour railway station|Larne Harbour]], [[Portadown railway station|Portadown]], [[Newry railway station|Newry]] and onwards, via the [[Enterprise (train service)|Enterprise]] service jointly operated by NIR and [[Iarnród Éireann]], to [[Dublin Connolly]].

The main railway lines linking to and from Belfast Great Victoria Street and Belfast Central are:
*The Derry Line and the Portrush Branch
*The Larne Line
*The Bangor Line
*The [[Portadown railway station|Portadown]] Line

Only five Irish counties, all in Southern and Western Ulster, currently have no mainline railway. The historic [[Great Northern Railway of Ireland]] connected them. They are Cavan, Monaghan, Fermanagh, Tyrone and Donegal. A plan to re-link [[Sligo]] and Derry through Donegal has been postponed until at least 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.derrydaily.net/2013/09/16/derry-sligo-train-link-railed-out/|title=DERRY-SLIGO TRAIN LINK "RAILED OUT" {{!}} Derry Daily|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Languages and dialects==
{{Main|Ulster Irish|Mid Ulster English|Ulster Scots dialects}}

Most people in Ulster speak English. English is taught in all schools in the province; [[Irish language|Irish]] (''{{lang|ga|Gaeilge}}'') is taught in all schools in the counties that are part of the Republic, and in schools in Northern Ireland, almost exclusively in the Roman Catholic and Irish-medium sectors.

==History==

===Early history===
{{Further|History of Ireland}}
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2012}}
Ulster is one of the [[Provinces of Ireland|four Irish provinces]]. Its [[Place names in Irish|name]] derives from the [[Irish language]] ''Cúige Uladh'' (pronounced "Kooi-gah UH-loo"), meaning "fifth of the [[Ulaid]]h", named for the ancient inhabitants of the region.

The province's early story extends further back than written records and survives mainly in legends such as the [[Ulster Cycle]].
The [[archaeology]] of Ulster, formerly called Ulandia, gives examples of "ritual enclosures", such as the "Giant's Ring" near Belfast, which is an earth bank about 590&amp;nbsp;feet (180 m) in diameter and 15&amp;nbsp;feet (4.5 m) high, in the centre of which there is a [[dolmen]].&lt;ref name="Riordain 66"&gt;{{cite book|last=Riordain|first=S. O.|year=1966|edition=reprint|title=Antiquities of the Irish Countryside|series=University Paperbacks|location=London|publisher=Methuen &amp; Co. Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 637, the [[Battle of Moira]], known archaically as the Battle of Magh Rath, was fought by the Gaelic High King of Ireland Domhnall II against his foster son King Conghal of Ulster, supported by his ally Domhnall the Freckled (Domhnall Brecc) of [[Dalriada]]. The battle was fought near the Woods of Killultagh, just outside the village of Moira in what would become County Down. It was allegedly the largest battle ever fought on the island of Ireland, and resulted in the death of Conghal and the retreat of Domhnall Brecc.

In early medieval Ireland, a branch of the [[Northern Uí Néill]], the [[Cenél nEógain]] of the province of [[Ailech]], gradually eroded the territory of the province of Ulaidh until it lay east of the [[River Bann]]. The Cenél nEógain would make Tír Eóghain (most of which forms modern [[County Tyrone]]) their base. Among the [[High King of Ireland|High Kings of Ireland]] were [[Áed Findliath]] (died 879), [[Niall Glúndub]] (died 919), and [[Domnall ua Néill]] (died 980), all of the Cenél nEógain. The province of Ulaidh would survive restricted to the east of modern Ulster until the Norman invasion in the late 12th century. It would only once more become a province of Ireland in the mid-14th century after the collapse of the Norman [[Earldom of Ulster]], when the [[O'Neill]]s who had come to dominate the Northern Uí Néill stepped into the power vacuum and staked a claim for the first time the title of "king of Ulster" along with the Red Hand of Ulster symbol. It was then that the provinces of Ailech, Airgialla, and Ulaidh would all merge largely into what would become the modern province of Ulster.

[[File:Bronze statue - geograph.org.uk - 821113.jpg|260px|thumb|A bronze statue commemorating The [[Flight of the Earls]] at [[Rathmullan]] in north [[County Donegal]].]]
[[Domnall Ua Lochlainn]] (died 1121) and [[Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn]] (died 1166) were of this dynasty. The [[Meic Lochlainn]] were in 1241 overthrown by their kin, the clan Ó Néill (see [[O'Neill dynasty]]). The Ó Néill's were from then on established as Ulster's most powerful Gaelic family.

The Ó Domhnaill ([[O'Donnell]]) dynasty were Ulster's second most powerful clan from the early thirteenth-century through to the beginning of the seventeenth-century. The O'Donnells ruled over [[Tír Chonaill]] (most of modern County Donegal) in West Ulster.

After the [[Norman Ireland|Norman invasion]] of Ireland in the twelfth century, the east of the province fell by conquest to Norman barons, first [[John de Courcy|De Courcy]] (died 1219), then [[Hugh de Lacy, 1st Earl of Ulster|Hugh de Lacy]] (1176–1243), who founded the [[Earl of Ulster|Earldom of Ulster]] based on the modern counties of Antrim and Down.

In the 1600s Ulster was the last redoubt of the traditional [[Gaels|Gaelic]] way of life, and following the defeat of the Irish forces in the [[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Nine Years War]] (1594–1603) at the [[battle of Kinsale]] (1601), [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s English forces succeeded in subjugating Ulster and all of Ireland.

The Gaelic leaders of Ulster, the [[O'Neill dynasty|O'Neills]] and [[O'Donnell]]s, finding their power under English [[suzerainty]] limited, decamped ''en masse'' in 1607 (the [[Flight of the Earls]]) to [[Roman Catholic]] Europe. This allowed the [[British monarchy|English Crown]] to plant Ulster with more loyal English and Scottish [[Plantations of Ireland|planter]]s, a process which began in earnest in 1610.

===Plantations and civil wars===
&lt;!-- Note to editors: the agreed compromise for the Derry/Londonderry naming dispute is that the city shall be Derry and the county shall be Londonderry.
--&gt;
The [[Plantation of Ulster]] ({{lang-gle|Plandáil Uladh}}) was the organised [[colonisation]] (or [[Plantation (settlement or colony)|plantation]]) of Ulster by people from Great Britain (especially [[Presbyterians]] from [[Scotland]]). Private plantation by wealthy landowners began in 1606,&lt;ref name="A.T.Q. Stewart 1989. Page 38"&gt;{{cite book|first=A. T.

All land owned by Irish chieftains, the [[O'Neill dynasty|Ó Neills]] and [[O'Donnell dynasty|Ó Donnells]] (along with those of their supporters), who fought against the [[English Crown]] in the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years War]], were confiscated and used to settle the colonists. The Counties [[County Donegal|Tyrconnell]], [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]], [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]], [[County Cavan|Cavan]], [[County Coleraine|Coleraine]] and [[County Armagh|Armagh]] comprised the official Colony.&lt;ref&gt;T. A. Jackson, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; However, most of the counties, including the most heavily colonised Counties [[County Antrim|Antrim]] and [[County Down|Down]], were privately colonised.&lt;ref name="A.T.Q. Stewart 1989. Page 38"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cyril Falls 1996. Pages 156-157"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perceval-Maxwell"/&gt; These counties, though not officially designated as subject to [[Plantation]], had suffered violent depopulation during the previous wars and proved attractive to Private [[Colonialists]] from nearby Britain.

The official reason for the Plantation is said to have been to pay for the costly [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/plantation/planters/es10.shtml Wars and Conflicts – Plantation of Ulster – English and Scottish Planters – 1641 Rebellion] BBC History&lt;/ref&gt; but this view was not shared by all in the English government of the time, most notably the [[English Crown]]-appointed [[Attorney-General for Ireland]] in 1609, [[John Davies (poet)|Sir John Davies]]:{{quote|

A barbarous country must be first broken by a war before it will be capable of good government ; and when it is fully subdued and conquered, if it be not well planted and governed after the conquest, it will eftsoons return to the former barbarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Discovery of the True Cause Why Ireland Was Never Entirely Subdued Nor Brought Under Obedience of the Crown of England Until the Beginning of His Majesty's Happy Reign|first=John|last=Davies|editor=Morley, Henry|publisher=George Routledge and Sons, Ltd|location=London|year=1890|pages=218–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Oliver Cromwell mural (2736627207).jpg|thumb|A modern Protestant mural in [[Belfast]] celebrating [[Oliver Cromwell]] and his activities.]]
The Plantation of Ulster continued well into the 18th century, interrupted only by the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]]. This Rebellion was initially led by [[Phelim O'Neill|Sir Phelim O'Neill]] (Irish: ''Sir Féilim Ó Néill''), and was intended to overthrow British rule rapidly, but quickly degenerated into attacks on colonists, in which dispossessed Irish slaughtered thousands of the colonists. In the ensuing [[Irish Confederate Wars|wars]] (1641–1653, fought against the background of [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms|civil war]] in England, Scotland and Ireland), Ulster became a battleground between the Colonialists and the native Irish. In 1646, an Irish army under command by [[Owen Roe O'Neill]] (Irish: ''Eoghan Ruadh Ó Néill'') inflicted a defeat on a Scottish [[Covenanter]] army at [[battle of Benburb|Benburb]] in County Tyrone, but the native Irish forces failed to follow up their victory and the war lapsed into stalemate. The war in Ulster ended with the defeat of the native army at the [[Battle of Scarrifholis]], near Newmills on the western outskirts of [[Letterkenny]], [[County Donegal]], in 1650, as part of the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]] conducted by [[Oliver Cromwell]] and the [[New Model Army]], the aim of which was to expel all native Irish to the Province of [[Connacht|Connaught]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/ashorthistory/archive/intro100.shtml BBC Short History]&lt;/ref&gt;

Forty years later, in 1688–1691, the [[Williamite War in Ireland|Williamite War]] was fought, the belligerents of which were the [[Williamite]]s and [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]]. The war was partly due to a dispute over who was the rightful claimant to the [[British Throne]], and thus the supreme monarch of the nascent [[British Empire]]. However, the war was also a part of the greater [[War of the Grand Alliance]], fought between [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV of France]] and his allies, and a European-wide coalition, the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Grand Alliance]], led by [[William III of England|Prince William of Orange]] and [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold I of the Holy Roman Empire]], supported by the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and many other states. The Grand Alliance was a cross-denominational alliance designed to stop French eastward colonialist expansion under Louis XIV, with whom [[James II of England|King James II]] was allied.

The majority of Irish people were "Jacobites" and supported James II due to his 1687 [[Declaration of Indulgence]] or, as it is also known, The Declaration for the Liberty of Conscience, that granted religious freedom to all denominations in England and Scotland and also due to James II's promise to the Irish Parliament of an eventual right to self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Tim|last=Harris|title=Revolution: The Great Crisis of the British Monarchy, 1685–1720|location=London|publisher=Allen Lane|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7139-9759-0|page=440}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.jstor.org/pss/30064327|title=A 'Beleaguered Protestant'?: Walter Harris and the Writing of ''Fiction Unmasked'' in Mid-18th-Century Ireland|first=Eoin|last=Magennis|pages=6–111|journal=Eighteenth-Century Ireland|volume=13|year=1998|accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, James II was deposed in the [[Glorious Revolution]], and the majority of Ulster [[Colonialists]] ([[Williamite]]s) backed [[William III of England|William of Orange]]. It is of note that both the Williamite and Jacobite armies were religiously mixed; William of Orange's own elite forces, the [[Dutch Blue Guards]] had a papal banner with them during the invasion, many of them being Dutch Roman Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rabushka|first=Alvin|year=2008|title=Taxation in Colonial America, 1607–1775|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=279|isbn=978-0-691-13345-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the war, Irish Jacobites controlled most of Ireland for James II, with the exception of the Williamite strongholds at [[Derry]] and at [[Enniskillen]] in Ulster. The Jacobites [[Siege of Derry|besieged Derry]] from December 1688 to July 1689, ending when a Williamite army from Britain relieved the city. The Williamites based in Enniskillen defeated another Jacobite army at the [[battle of Newtownbutler]] on 28 July 1689. Thereafter, Ulster remained firmly under Williamite control and William's forces completed their conquest of the rest of Ireland in the next two years. The war provided Protestant [[Ulster loyalism|loyalists]] with the iconic victories of the [[Siege of Derry]], the [[Battle of the Boyne]] (1 July 1690) and the [[Battle of Aughrim]] (12 July 1691), all of which the [[Orange Order]] commemorate each year.

The Williamites' victory in this war ensured British rule in Ireland for over 200 years. The [[Protestant Ascendancy]] in Ireland excluded most of Ulster's population from having any Civil [[power (sociology)|power]] on religious grounds. [[Roman Catholics]] (descended from the indigenous Irish) and [[Presbyterians]] (mainly descended from Scottish colonists) both suffered discrimination under the [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]], which gave full political rights only to [[Anglican]] Protestants (mostly descended from English settlers). In the 1690s, Scottish Presbyterians became a majority in Ulster, due to a large influx of them into the Province.

===Emigration===
Considerable numbers of Ulster-Scots emigrated to the North American colonies throughout the 18th century (160,000 settled in what would become the United States between 1717 and 1770 alone).

Disdaining (or forced out of) the heavily English regions on the Atlantic coast, most groups of Ulster-Scots settlers crossed into the "western mountains," where their descendants populated the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] regions and the [[Ohio Valley]]. Here they lived on the frontiers of America, carving their own world out of the wilderness. The Scots-Irish soon became the dominant culture of the Appalachians from [[Pennsylvania]] to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Author (and US Senator) [[Jim Webb]] puts forth a thesis in his book ''Born Fighting'' to suggest that the character traits he ascribes to the Scots-Irish such as loyalty to kin, mistrust of governmental authority, and a propensity to bear arms, helped shape the American identity.

In the [[United States Census, 2000]], 4.3 million Americans claimed Scots-Irish ancestry.  The areas where the most Americans reported themselves in the 2000 Census only as "American" with no further qualification (e.g. [[Kentucky]], north-central [[Texas]], and many other areas in the [[Southern US]]) are largely the areas where many Scots-Irish settled, and are in complementary distribution with the areas which most heavily report Scots-Irish ancestry.

According to the Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups, 400,000 people in the US were of Irish birth or ancestry in 1790 when the first US Census counted 3,100,000 white Americans.  According to the encyclopaedia, half of these Irish Americans were descended from Ulster, and half from the other three provinces of Ireland.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Republicanism, rebellion and communal strife===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}
Most of the 18th century saw a calming of sectarian tensions in Ulster. The economy of the province improved, as small producers exported linen and other goods. Belfast developed from a village into a bustling provincial town. However, this did not stop many thousands of Ulster people from emigrating to [[British North America]] in this period, where they became known as "[[Scotch-Irish American|Scots Irish]]" or "[[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch-Irish]]".{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Political tensions resurfaced, albeit in a new form, towards the end of the 18th century. In the 1790s many Roman Catholics and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]], in opposition to [[Protestant Ascendancy|Anglican domination]] and inspired by the American and French [[revolutions]] joined together in the [[United Irishmen]] movement. This group (founded in Belfast) dedicated itself to founding a non-[[sectarian]] and independent Irish republic. The United Irishmen had particular strength in [[Belfast]], [[County Antrim|Antrim]] and [[County Down|Down]]. Paradoxically however, this period also saw much sectarian violence between Roman Catholics and Protestants, principally members of the [[Church of Ireland]] (Anglicans, who practised the British state religion and had rights denied to both Presbyterians and Roman Catholics), notably the "[[Battle of the Diamond]]" in 1795, a faction fight between the rival "[[Defenders (Ireland)|Defenders]]" (Roman Catholic) and "[[Peep O'Day Boys]]" (Anglican), which led to over 100 deaths and to the founding of the [[Orange Institution|Orange Order]]. This event, and many others like it, came about with the relaxation of the [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]] and Roman Catholics began to be allowed to purchase land and involve themselves in the linen trade (activities which previously had involved many onerous restrictions). Protestants, including some Presbyterians, who in some parts of the province had come to identify with the Roman Catholic community, used violence to intimidate Roman Catholics who tried to enter the linen trade. Estimates suggest that up to 7000 Roman Catholics suffered expulsion from Ulster during this violence. Many of them settled in northern [[Connacht]]. These refugees' linguistic influence still survives in the dialects of Irish spoken in [[County Mayo|Mayo]], which have many similarities to [[Ulster Irish]] not found elsewhere in Connacht. Loyalist militias, primarily [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]], also used violence against the [[Society of United Irishmen|United Irishmen]] and against Roman Catholic and Protestant [[Irish republicanism|republicans]] throughout the province.

In 1798 the United Irishmen, led by [[Henry Joy McCracken]], launched a rebellion in Ulster, mostly supported by Presbyterians. But the British authorities swiftly put down the rebellion and employed severe repression after the fighting had ended. In the wake of the failure of this [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rebellion]], and following the gradual abolition of official religious discrimination after the [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]] in 1800, [[Presbyterians]] came to identify more with the State and with their Anglican neighbours, due to their civil rights now being respected by both the state and their Anglican neighbours.

The [[1859 Ulster Revival]] was a major [[Christian revival]] that spread throughout Ulster.

===Industrialisation, Home Rule and partition===
[[File:Royal Avenue Belfast2.jpg|right|thumb|Royal Avenue, [[Belfast]]. [[Photochrom]] print circa 1890–1900.]]
In the 19th century, Ulster had the only large-scale industrialisation and became the most prosperous province on the island.  In the latter part of the century, [[Belfast]] briefly overtook [[Dublin]] as the island's largest city. Belfast became famous in this period for its huge [[dockyard]]s and [[shipbuilding]] — and notably for the construction of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']]. [[Sectarian]] divisions in Ulster became hardened into the political categories of ''[[unionist (Ireland)|unionist]]'' (supporters of the Union with Britain; mostly, but not exclusively, Protestant) and ''[[Irish nationalist|nationalist]]'' (advocates of repeal of the 1800 Act of Union, usually, though not exclusively, Roman Catholic). Northern Ireland's current politics originate from these late 19th century disputes over [[Irish Home Rule Movement|Home Rule]] that would have devolved some powers of government to Ireland, and which Ulster Protestants usually opposed—fearing for their religious rights calling it "Rome Rule" in an autonomous Roman Catholic-dominated Ireland and also not trusting politicians from the agrarian south and west to support the more industrial economy of Ulster. This lack of trust, however, was largely unfounded as during the 19th and early 20th century important industries in the southern most region of Cork included brewing, distilling, wool and like Belfast, shipbuilding.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/doc/32717516/1919-Cork-Its-Trade-and-Commerce| pg 168&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Irish UK election 1918.png|230px|right|The results of the [[Irish general election, 1918]], in which [[Sinn Féin]] and the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] won the majority of votes on the island of Ireland, shown in the color green and light green respectively, with the exception being primarily in the East of the province of Ulster.]]
Thousands of unionists, led by the Dublin-born barrister [[Sir Edward Carson]] and [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]], signed the "[[Ulster Covenant]]" of 1912 pledging to resist Home Rule. This movement also set up the [[Ulster Volunteers|Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF). In April 1914, the UVF assisted with the landing of 30,000 [[Imperial Germany|German]] rifles with 3,000,000 rounds at [[Larne]] by blockading authorities.  (See [[Larne gunrunning]]). The [[Curragh Incident]] showed it would be difficult to use the British army to enforce home rule from Dublin on Ulster's unionist minority.

In response, Irish republicans created the [[Irish Volunteers]], part of which became the forerunner of the [[Irish Republican Army (1917–22)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) — to seek to ensure the passing of the [[Home Rule Act 1914|Home Rule Bill]]. Upon the outbreak of [[Ireland and World War I|World War I]] in 1914, 200,000 Irishmen, both Southern and Northern, of all religious sects volunteered to serve in the [[British Army]]. This had the effect of interrupting the armed stand-off in Ireland. As the war progressed, in Ireland, opposition to the War grew stronger, reaching its peak in 1918 when the British government proposed laws to extend [[conscription]] to all able bodied Irishmen during the [[Conscription Crisis of 1918|Conscription Crisis]].

In the aftermath of World War I, the political party [[Sinn Féin]] ("Ourselves") won the majority of votes in the [[Irish general election, 1918]], this political party pursued a policy of complete independent self-determination for the island of Ireland as outlined in the [[Sinn Féin Manifesto 1918|Sinn Féin campaign Manifesto of 1918]], a great deal more than the devolved government/[[Home Rule]] advocated by the (I.P.P)[[Irish Parliamentary Party]]. Following the Sinn Féin victory in these elections the [[Irish Declaration of Independence]] was penned and [[Irish Republicanism|Irish republicans]] launched a guerrilla campaign against British rule in what became the [[Irish War of Independence]] (January 1919 – July 1921). The fighting in Ulster during the Irish War of Independence generally took the form of street battles between Protestants and Roman Catholics in the city of Belfast. Estimates suggest that about 600 civilians died in this communal violence, the majority of them (58%) Roman Catholics. The IRA remained relatively quiescent in Ulster, with the exception of the south [[County Armagh|Armagh]] area, where [[Frank Aiken]] led it. A lot of IRA activity also took place at this time in [[County Donegal]] and the City of [[Derry]], where one of the main Republican leaders was [[Peadar O'Donnell]]. Hugh O'Doherty, a [[Sinn Féin]] politician, was elected mayor of Derry at this time. In the [[First Dáil]], which was elected in late 1918, Prof. [[Eoin Mac Néill]] served as the Sinn Féin T.D. for [[Derry city]].

===1920 to present===
{{main|History of Northern Ireland}}
{{see also|Demographics and politics of Northern Ireland|Politics of the Republic of Ireland}}
[[Partition of Ireland]], first mooted in 1912, was introduced with the enactment of the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]], which gave a form of "Home rule" self-government to two areas, [[Southern Ireland (1921–22)|Southern Ireland]], with its capital at [[Dublin]], and "[[Northern Ireland]]", consisting of six of Ulster's central and eastern counties, both within a continuing [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. Dissatisfaction with this led to the [[Irish War of Independence]], which formally ceased on 11 July 1921. Low-level violence, however, continued in Ulster, causing [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] in the south to order a boycott of Northern products in protest at attacks on the Nationalist community there. The Partition was effectively confirmed by the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] of 6 December 1921. One of the primary stipulations of the treaty was the transformation of Ireland into a self-governing British [[dominion]] called the [[Irish Free State]] (which later became the sovereign [[Republic of Ireland]]), but with the option of a continuation of the home rule institution of Northern Ireland, still within the United Kingdom, if the Northern Ireland Parliament (already in existence) chose to opt out of the Irish Free State. All parties knew that this was certain to be the choice of the Ulster Unionists who had a majority in the parliament, and immediately on the creation of the Free State they resolved to leave it.

Following the Anglo Irish treaty, the exact border between the new dominion of the Irish Free State and the future [[Northern Ireland]], if it chose to opt out, was to be decided by the [[Irish Boundary Commission]]. This did not announce its findings until 1925, when the line was again drawn around six of Ulster's nine counties, with no change from the partition of 1920.

Electorally, voting in the six [[Northern Ireland]] counties of Ulster tends to follow religious or sectarian lines; noticeable religious demarcation does not exist in the South Ulster counties of Cavan and Monaghan in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. County Donegal is largely a Roman Catholic county, but with a large [[Protestant]] minority. Generally, Protestants in Donegal vote for the political party [[Fine Gael]] ("Family of the Irish").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ladlass.com/intel/archives/006991.html |title=The Future's Bright For Donegal's Orangemen |accessdate=6 June 2008 |publisher=Independent News And Media |date=11 July 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, religious sectarianism in politics has largely disappeared from the rest of the Republic of Ireland. This was illustrated when [[Erskine Hamilton Childers|Erskine H. Childers]], a [[Church of Ireland]] member and [[Teachta Dála]] (TD, a member of the lower house of the National Parliament) who had represented Monaghan, won election as [[President of Ireland|President]] after having served as a long-term minister under [[Fianna Fáil]] [[Taoiseach|Taoisigh]] [[Éamon de Valera]], [[Seán Lemass]] and [[Jack Lynch]].

The [[Orange Order]] freely organises in counties Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan, with several Orange parades taking place throughout County Donegal each year. The only major Orange Order march in the [[Republic of Ireland]] takes place every July in the village of [[Rossnowlagh]], near [[Ballyshannon]], in the south of County Donegal.

{{As of|2017}}, Northern Ireland has seven Roman Catholic members of parliament, all members of Sinn Féin (of a total of 18 from the whole of Northern Ireland) in the [[British House of Commons]] at [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]]; and the other three counties have one Protestant T.D. of the ten it has elected to [[Dáil Éireann]], the Lower House of the Oireachtas, the parliament of the Republic of Ireland. At present (August 2007) County Donegal sends six T.D.'s to Dáil Éireann. The county is divided into two constituencies: Donegal North-East and Donegal South-West, each with three T.D.'s. County Cavan and County Monaghan form the one constituency called Cavan-Monaghan, which sends five T.D.'s to the Dáil (one of whom is a Protestant).

The historic [[Flag of Ulster]] served as the basis for the [[Ulster Banner]] (often referred to as the Flag of Northern Ireland), which was the flag of the [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Government of Northern Ireland]] until the proroguing of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Stormont]] parliament in 1973.

==Sport==
In [[Gaelic games]] (which include [[Gaelic football]] and [[hurling]]), [[Ulster GAA|Ulster]] counties play the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship]] and [[Ulster Senior Hurling Championship]]. In football, the main competitions in which they compete with the other Irish counties are the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] and [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]], while the Ulster club champions represent the province in the [[All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship]]. Hurling teams play in the [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship]], [[National Hurling League]] and [[All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship]]. The whole province fields a team to play the other provinces in the [[Railway Cup]] in both football and hurling. Gaelic Football is by far the most popular of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]] sports in Ulster but hurling is also played, especially in [[Antrim GAA|Antrim]], [[Armagh GAA|Armagh]], [[Derry GAA|Derry]], and [[Down GAA|Down]].

The border has divided association football teams since 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fai.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=32&amp;Itemid=47|title=Football Association of Ireland|website=www.fai.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Irish Football Association]] (the I.F.A.) oversees the sport in N.I., while the [[Football Association of Ireland]] (the F.A.I.) oversees the sport in the Republic. As a result, separate international teams are fielded and separate championships take place ([[Irish Football League]] in Northern Ireland, [[League of Ireland]] in the rest of Ulster and Ireland). Anomalously, [[Derry City F.C.]] has played in the League of Ireland since 1985 due to crowd trouble at some of their Irish League matches prior to this. The other major Ulster team in the League of Ireland is [[Finn Harps]] of [[Ballybofey]], County Donegal. When Derry City F.C. and Finn Harps play against each other, the game is usually referred to as a 'North-West Derby'. There have been cup competitions between I.F.A. and F.A.I. clubs, most recently the [[Setanta Sports Cup]].

In [[Rugby union]], the professional rugby team representing the province and the [[Irish Rugby Football Union|IRFU]] Ulster Branch, [[Ulster Rugby]], compete in the [[Pro14]] along with teams from [[Wales]], [[Scotland]], Italy, South Africa and the other Irish Provinces ([[Leinster Rugby|Leinster]], [[Munster Rugby|Munster]] and [[Connacht Rugby|Connacht]]). They also compete in Europe's main club rugby tournament, the European Rugby Champions Cup, which they won (as the Heineken Cup) back in 1999. Notable Ulster rugby players include Willy John McBride, [[Jack Kyle]] and [[Mike Gibson (rugby union)|Mike Gibson]]. The former is the most capped [[British and Irish Lions|British and Irish Lion]] of all time, having completed four tours with the Lions in the sixties and seventies. At international level players from Ulster join with those from the other 3 provinces to form the Irish national team. They do not sing the Irish national anthem but do sing a special song which has been written celebrating the "4 proud provinces" before matches start.

[[Cricket]] is also played in Ulster, especially in Northern Ireland and East Donegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RPtXDMarWTEC&amp;pg=PA225&amp;lpg=PA225&amp;dq=cricket+belfast+protestant&amp;source=web&amp;ots=dJxpuEQtUo&amp;sig=aALVaykcG-8KxOhtmWYXKWVB900&amp;hl=en|title=Explaining Northern Ireland: Broken Images|first1=John|last1=McGarry|first2=Brendan|last2=O'Leary|date=8 June 1995|publisher=Wiley|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Golf is, however, by far the most high-profile sport and the sport that Ulster has succeeded at more than any other. Ulster has produced many great players over the years, from [[Fred Daly (golfer)|Fred Daly]] winning The Open Championship in 1947 at the Royal Liverpool Golf Club, Hoylake to most recently [[Rory McIlroy]] winning the US Open and [[Darren Clarke]] winning The Open Championship in 2011. Ulster also has another Major winner in [[Graeme McDowell]], who also won the US Open in 2010.

In horse racing, specifically National Hunt, Ulster has produced the most dominant jockey of all time, Tony McCoy.

The [[Circuit of Ireland Rally]] is an annual [[auto racing|automobile]] [[rallying|rally]] held in Ulster since 1931.

[[File:En-Chicago-CiteSourceWindyCityHistory01.gif|thumb|This newspaper article was published by the Cleveland Gazette in 1885]]
The city of [[Chicago]] has been known by [[List of nicknames for Chicago|many nicknames]], but it is most widely recognized as the "'''Windy City'''".

The earliest known reference to the "Windy City" was actually to [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]] in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Popik |first=Barry |url=http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/summary/ |title=The Big Apple: Windy City (summary) |publisher=Barrypopik.com |date=2004-10-11 |accessdate=2011-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first known repeated effort to label Chicago with this nickname is from 1876 and involves Chicago's rivalry with [[Cincinnati]]. The term "Windy City" came into common usage when it was popularized by New York City editor, [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles Dana]], in ''[[The Sun (New York)|The Sun]]'' during the bidding for the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition|Columbian Exposition]]. Chicago won the Exposition, which did not please Dana. The popularity of the nickname has endured, long after the Cincinnati rivalry and the Columbian Exposition ended.

==Origins==
There are four main possibilities to explain the city's nickname: the weather, as Chicago is near Lake Michigan; the [[World's fair|World's Fair]]; politics; and the rivalry with [[Cincinnati]].

===Weather===
While Chicago is widely known as the "Windy City", it is not the windiest city in the United States. Some of the windier cities recorded by the NOAA/NCDC are  
[[Dodge City, KS]] at 13.9&amp;nbsp;mph (22.3&amp;nbsp;km/h),&lt;ref name="ncdc.noaa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/extreme-us-climates.php|title=U.S. Climate Extremes - Extremes -  National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)|first=|last=Enloe|website=www.ncdc.noaa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Amarillo, Texas]] at 13.5&amp;nbsp;mph (21.7&amp;nbsp;km/h),&lt;ref name="ncdc.noaa.gov"/&gt; 
and [[Lubbock, Texas]] at 12.4&amp;nbsp;mph (20&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wind-speed.weatherdb.com/l/232/Lubbock-Texas|title=WeatherDB - A Research Engine|website=wind-speed.weatherdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Chicago is not significantly windier than any other U.S. city. For example, the average annual wind speed of Chicago is {{convert|10.3|mph|abbr=on}}; [[Boston]]: {{convert|12.4|mph|abbr=on}}; [[Central Park]], [[New York City]]: {{convert|9.3|mph|abbr=on}}; and [[Los Angeles]]: {{convert|7.5|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=ncdc&gt;{{cite web|last=Dellinger|first=Dan|title=Wind - Average Wind Speed - (MPH)| work=|publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]|date=2004-01-04|url=http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/online/ccd/avgwind.html|accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following "windy city" explanation is from the ''Freeborn County Standard'' of [[Albert Lea, Minnesota]], on November 20, 1892:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chicagology.com/chicagoname|title=Chicago Name Origin|website=chicagology.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bquote|Chicago has been called the "windy" city, the term being used metaphorically to make out that Chicagoans were braggarts. The city is losing this reputation, for the reason that as people got used to it they found most of her claims to be backed up by facts. As usual, people go to extremes in this thing also, and one can tell a stranger almost anything about Chicago today and feel that he believes it implicitly.

But in another sense Chicago is actually earning the title of the "windy" city. It is one of the effects of the tall buildings which engineers and architects apparently did not foresee that the wind is sucked down into the streets. Walk past the Masonic Temple or the Auditorium any day even though it may be perfectly calm elsewhere, and you will meet with a lively breeze at the base of the building that will compel you to put your hand to your hat.}}

An explanation for Chicago being a naturally breezy area is that it is on the shores of [[Lake Michigan]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Chicago had long billed itself as an ideal summer resort because of its cool lake breeze. ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' of July 8, 1873, wrote that "a few years ago, Chicago advertised itself as a summer resort, on the strength of the lake breezes which so nicely tempered the mid-summer heats." The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' of June 14, 1876, discussed "Chicago as a Summer Resort" at length, proudly declaring that "the people of this city are enjoying cool breezes, refreshing rains, green fields, a grateful sun, and balmy air—winds from the north and east tempered by the coolness of the lake, and from the south and west, bearing to us frequent hints of the grass, flowers, wheat and corn of the prairies."

The February 4, 1873, ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer|Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' called Chicago "the great city of winds and fires."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/summary/|title=Barry Popik|first=Barry|last=Popik|website=www.barrypopik.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cincinnati rivalry===

[[Cincinnati]] and Chicago were rival cities in the 1860s and 1870s. Cincinnati was well known in the meatpacking trade and it was called "Porkopolis" from at least 1843. Starting from the early 1860s, Chicago surpassed Cincinnati in this trade and proudly claimed the very same "Porkopolis" nickname.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/porkpolis_cincinnati_chicago_nickname/|title=Barry Popik|first=Barry|last=Popik|website=www.barrypopik.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[baseball]] inter-city matches were especially intense. The 1869 [[Cincinnati Red Stockings]] were the pride of all of baseball, so Chicago came up with a rival team called the [[Chicago Cubs|White Stockings]] to defeat them. "Windy City" often appeared in the Cincinnati sporting news of the 1870s and 1880s.

Four of the first known citations of "Windy City" are from 1876, all involving Cincinnati:

# ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', April 20, 1876, headline: "The WINDY CITY Jay-Rollers La-Crosse Team Wins Inaugural Game against Cincinnati Nannies." That High.
# ''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]'', May 9, 1876, headline: "THAT WINDY CITY. Some Freaks of the Last Chicago Tornado."
# ''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]'', May 13, 1876: "Only the plucky nerve of the eating-house keeper rescued the useful seats from a journey to the Windy City."
# ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', July 2, 1876: "The Cincinnati Enquirer, in common with many other papers, has been waiting with great anxiety for the fulfillment of its prophecy: that the Chicago papers would call the Whites hard names when they lost. Witness these scraps the day after the Whites lost to the Athletics: There comes a wail to us from the Windy City."

===World's Fair===

[[File:Looking West From Peristyle, Court of Honor and Grand Basin, 1893.jpg|thumb|right|The Columbian Exposition]]
As the 400th anniversary of [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]' arrival in the Americas approached, the United States planned to hold a world's fair to celebrate. This was considered an important time, due to the French successes at the previous World's Fair with the construction of the [[Eiffel Tower]].

The prestige of holding the fair enticed several prominent cities to compete to host the fair. At the top, [[New York City]], [[St. Louis]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] all fought hard for the right and many New Yorkers thought they had a win guaranteed. In the end, it came down to New York and Chicago. In 1890, Chicago won the bid to host the World's Fair, also known as the [[World's Columbian Exposition]], after eight ballots.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Tribune, Feb. 25, 1890, p.1 (reporting the Congressional votes for the host city)&lt;/ref&gt; Many prominent New Yorkers were extremely irritated that a "frontier town" could beat them.

It is a popular myth that the first person to use the term "Windy City" was [[The New York Sun]] editor, Charles Dana. Charles Dana was New York's leading fair booster, but there is little evidence that he ever used the "Windy City" term. The first known attribution of Dana to the origin of "Windy City" was 40 years later in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', "Chicago Dubbed 'Windy' in Fight for Fair of '93," June 11, 1933:&lt;ref name=bierma&gt;{{cite web|last=Bierma|first=Nathan L. K.|title=Windy City|publisher= nbierma.com|year=2004|url=http://www.nbierma.com/language/column/windy/windy-cpl.htm|accessdate=2008-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bquote|"Don't pay any attention", wrote Charles A. Dana, day in and day out in his New York Sun, "to the nonsensical claims of that windy city. Its people could not build a World's Fair even if they won it".}}

===Politics===

Long-winded politicians and the frequent political conventions in Chicago have been suggested as the source of the nickname. Another related suggestion is the business boosterism that other cities resented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/6.html Windy City], Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago, Chicago Historical Society, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Nineteenth-century journalists frequently referred to Chicago as the windy city because they allegedly believed Chicagoan politicians where nothing but profit-centric. However, it's worth noting the rivalry between Chicago, a growing metropolis in the nineteenth century, and other cities such as New York City, from where most of these journalists came. In other words, the Windy City is not a nickname Chicago gave itself, but rather something that the city has embraced over time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rd.com/culture/chicago-windy-city/The Surprising Reason Chicago Is Called the “Windy City”], Meghan Jones, Reader's Digest, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Hawk wind, or Hawkins===
Chicago's wind is often called "The Hawk". This term has long been popular in [[African American Vernacular English]]. ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'s'' series of columns in 1934 attempted to examine the origin of the phrase, "Hawkins is coming", for a cold, winter wind. The first recorded Chicago citation is in the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'', October 20, 1936: "And these cold mornings are on us—in other words 'Hawkins' has got us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/the_hawk/|title=Barry Popik|first=Barry|last=Popik|website=www.barrypopik.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1967 song, "Dead End Street",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGpEdG0Ll0A|title=LOU RAWLS - Dead End Street (The Very Best of LOU RAWLS)|first=|last=The OldSCHOOL Kid BillyMatt|date=1 December 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago native [[Lou Rawls]] speaks the following intro:
{{bquote| "I was born in a city that they call 'The Windy City'. They call it The Windy City because of the Hawk. 'The Hawk' - all mighty Hawk. 'Mr Wind'. Takes care of plenty of business around winter time..."}}

It is also referenced in the first line of [[Steve Goodman]]'s song, "A Dying Cub Fan's Last Request", is "By the shores of old Lake Michigan / Where the Hawk Wind blows so cold..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xBxZGQ1dJk|title=Steve Goodman: A Dying Cubs Fan's Last Request|first=|last=cubbymark|date=3 October 2007|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other cities==
Various other cities have also claimed the nickname "Windy City". They include:
*[[Baku, Azerbaijan]], ''Küləklər şəhəri'' ("the [[City of Winds]]")
*[[Edinburgh, Scotland]]
*[[Essaouira|Essaouria]], Morocco, "Wind City of Africa"
*[[Hsinchu]], "Windy City" of Taiwan
*[[Lethbridge, Alberta]], Canada
*[[Luleå, Sweden]], ''Den blåsiga staden''  ("The Windy City")

*[[Pachuca, Hidalgo]] in Mexico, ''La Bella Airosa'' ('The Beautiful Windy One')
*[[Port Elizabeth, South Africa]]

'''Yan Ruyi''' (严如熤) (1759–1826) was an independent gentry scholar of considerable local influence in Western [[Hunan]] [[China]]. A child prodigy, he studied at the [[Yuelu Academy]] in [[Changsha]]. In 1795, Yan Ruyi was involved in a debacle in which he organized a group of [[Gelao people|Gelao]] to defend against the raging [[Miao Rebellion (1795–1806)|Miao Rebellion]] (1795–1797). A [[Qing]] government force mistook the Gelao for enemies and crushed the independent force. Yan Ruyi returned to his hometown in disgrace.

He later became famous for his contributions to frontier studies including [[Miaofang Beilan]], [[Yangfang Jiyao]], and [[Sansheng Bianfang]].  His model of making connections between government forces and certain friendly native peoples was used to great effect later during the [[White Lotus Rebellion]] and the [[Taiping Rebellion]].
