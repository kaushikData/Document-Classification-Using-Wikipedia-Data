'''Aera Energy LLC''' (Aera) is a natural gas, oil exploration and production company jointly owned by [[Shell Oil Company]] and [[ExxonMobil]] headquartered in [[Bakersfield, California]]. In addition, Aera Energy LLC is a California [[limited liability company]], and one of California’s largest oil and natural gas producers, with an approximate 2015 revenues of over $2&amp;nbsp;billion. Aera is operated as a stand-alone company through its board of managers.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

==Business areas==
Most of Aera’s production is located in the [[San Joaquin Valley]]. The company also has oil field operations in [[Ventura, California|Ventura]], [[Monterey]] and [[Fresno]] counties and has begun the permitting process to redevelop the East Cat Canyon oilfield in northern [[Santa Barbara County]]. Aera produces approximately 126,300 barrels of oil and 32&amp;nbsp;million cubic feet of natural gas each day, and has proved oil and natural gas reserves equivalent to approximately 536&amp;nbsp;million barrels of oil. Aera produces nearly 25 percent of California’s oil and natural gas.

The work force needs of Aera are provided by Aera Energy Services Company (Aera Services), a [[Delaware]] corporation. Aera and Aera Services employ about 1,370 people and hundreds of contractor companies.

The company began operating as Aera Energy LLC on June 1, 1997, and consists of the California onshore and offshore exploration and production assets previously operated by CalResources LLC (a former [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] affiliate), [[Mobil]] Exploration &amp; Producing US Inc. (now an [[ExxonMobil]] affiliate), and [[ARCO]].

===Coles Levee Ecosystem Preserve===
The Coles Levee Ecosystem Preserve, located about {{convert|20|mi|km}} southwest of [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], consists of {{convert|6059|acre|km2}} of habitat.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; More than a dozen  rare, threatened and endangered birds, animals and plant life can be found in the preserve. The preserve encompasses the last two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) of riparian habitat along the [[Kern River]], where it drains into Buena Vista Lake.

Established in 1992 by [[ARCO]] and the [[California Department of Fish and Game]], the preserve was acquired by Aera in 1998. The preserve is largely riparian habitat and is surrounded by active oil fields (the North Coles Levee Oil Field and South Coles Levee Oil Field, as well as the [[Elk Hills Oil Field]] to the west, operated by California Resources Corporation.&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;

===Real estate development===
As oil and gas production declines in the [[Los Angeles Basin]], Aera is planning to develop some property holdings in [[Orange County, California|Orange]] and [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]] counties for residential, commercial, and recreation uses while setting aside large portions of its property as natural open space.

The master planned community of Vista Del Verde, Aera’s first real estate development, followed the decommissioning  and cleanup of the {{convert|850|acre|km2|adj=on}} Yorba Linda oil field. The community includes housing, parks, an elementary school, and a city-owned golf course, Black Gold Golf Club.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackgoldgolf.com Black Gold Golf Club] Official website&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the development, Aera added more than {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} of adjacent, company-owned land to the [[Chino Hills State Park]], and provided funding for the restoration, enhancement, and maintenance of native habitats within the park.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Two additional real estate projects are being planned. The Aera Master Planned Community would develop approximately {{convert|3000|acre|km2}} of company-owned land in unincorporated Los Angeles and Orange counties, approximately where the county line intersects the [[Orange Freeway|Orange Freeway (SR-57)]]. Part of the larger [[Brea-Olinda Oil Field]], the property has been used for oil operations dating back to the 1890s and cattle grazing operations since the 1850s. Aera is pursuing approvals to develop this property for residential and commercial uses while devoting more than {{convert|1500|acre|km2}} to recreation uses and open space restoration. The project will also preserve and enhance a wildlife corridor to improve regional open space connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aeracommunity.com/ Aera Master Planned Community] Official website&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Aera owns a 50 percent interest in approximately {{convert|400|acre|km2}} known as the Newport Banning Ranch property on the western edge of the city of [[Newport Beach]]. Aera is a participant in Newport Banning Ranch, LLC, which has submitted a proposal to build 1,375 homes, parks, a coastal inn, and a small commercial center on about {{convert|153|acre|km2}} of the site, while preserving and restoring more than 55 percent of the property for open space and wildlife habitat uses. The project would remove oil facilities and restore the surface of most of the oil operations areas on the property, consolidating the remaining oil operations to two sites totaling about {{convert|20|acre|m2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Fry, Hannah (December 2, 2014) [http://www.dailypilot.com/news/tn-dpt-me-1203-banning-ranch-oil-drilling-20141202,0,1181832.story "Companies, Coastal Commission in dispute over Banning Ranch oil wells"] ''[[Daily Pilot]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newportbanningranch.com/ Newport Banning Ranch] Official website&lt;/ref&gt;

Counting current plans and proposals in Orange and southeastern Los Angeles Counties, Aera estimates that about two-thirds of the original land position held by Aera and its predecessors in these areas has been or will ultimately be devoted to park, recreation or open space uses.

Nearly all large-scale projects proposed in metropolitan Southern California encounter opposition from neighbors and environmental groups, who often have competing visions for a given piece of property.  Aera’s projects are no exception. Opponents have raised environmental concerns and argued that new development will place an unacceptable strain on local water supplies, transportation infrastructure, schools and other public services.&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;

The projects are currently being examined under the [[California Environmental Quality Act]], which provides a detailed process to examine projects, solicit input from a broad spectrum of individuals and public agencies, and give all stakeholders a voice in shaping projects prior to approval.

==Awards==
In 2002 Aera's [[South Belridge Oil Field|Belridge Producing Complex]] won the prestigious North American Maintenance Excellence (NAME) Award for its maintenance and reliability program and results. &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; In 2004 Aera's [[Midway-Sunset Oil Field|North Midway Sunset Unit]] was awarded a NAME Award.&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Aera is the first oil exploration and production company to win the award previously given only to manufacturing organizations. In 2011 Aera’s development team was awarded the [http://www.ame.org Association for Manufacturing Excellence] (AME) Manufacturing Excellence Award. Aera is the first energy company to receive the award.&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;

'''Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment''' ('''ACE''') is a coalition of some 30 major global entertainment companies and film studios aimed at protecting profits from [[copyright infringement|copyrighted material]]. Among the members of the coalition are [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], [[CBS]], [[Disney]], [[HBO]], [[NBCUniversal]], [[Netflix]] and [[Warner Bros]], among others.&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spangler|first1=Todd|title=Entertainment Giants Forge New Alliance to Fight Piracy, Sue Offenders|url=https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/entertainment-studios-piracy-lawsuits-1202463987/|website=variety.com|publisher=Variety|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stated mission of ACE is to protect profits, drawing on the anti-piracy resources of the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA). The organisation plans to conduct research into online pirating, lobby [[law enforcement]] to stop and sue pirate enterprises, file sweeping [[civil litigation]]s, and to "pursue voluntary agreements with responsible parties across the internet ecosystem" — such as [[search engine]]s and [[broadband provider]]s.&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt;

The organisation promotes itself as marking a new level of coordination among multiple stakeholders.&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt;

==Background==
Producers of copyrighted content oppose online piracy: according to anti-piracy technology vendor [[Muso (anti-piracy)|Muso]], internet users worldwide saved $107.9 billion by streaming from free content distributors in 2016. The efforts of the industry have proven ineffective at preventing online piracy. According to ACE, there are now as few as 480 online services complying with copyright law in an attempt to stem global demand for copyrighted content.&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Entertainment Companies Join Forces to Launch the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment to Reduce Online Piracy|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-entertainment-companies-join-forces-to-launch-the-alliance-for-creativity-and-entertainment-to-reduce-online-piracy-300472720.html|publisher=PR Newswire|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
In a statement from Disney lawyer and senior executive, [[Alan Braverman]], said: "ACE will help protect the viability of [Disney] and ensure audiences continue to enjoy the high-quality content they have come to expect ... It enhances our collective efforts to retain profitability by disrupting the extralegal enterprises that profit from the distribution of copyrighted content, while promoting the legal market for that content."&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt;

Netflix lawyer [[David Hyman]] commented: "[ACE is] providing a great consumer experience that ultimately discourages piracy", adding that "executives of copyright holders are still bad players around the world trying to profit off the hard work of others. By joining ACE, we will work together, share knowledge, and leverage the group’s combined anti-piracy resources to address the  problem of the free distribution of content".&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt;

[[Jonathan Anschell]], another executive and lawyer, of CBS, commented on the coalition: "In this golden age of profit it’s more important than ever that we remain vigilant about copyright protection ...  For the creative community to truly flourish, it must know that its work will be safe from theft."&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt;

'''Brussels II Regulation''' (EC) No 2201/2003,&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003R2201:EN:HTML 2201/2003]&lt;/ref&gt; also called '''Brussels IIA''' or '''II bis''' is a [[European Union]] Regulation on [[conflict of law]] issues in [[family law]] between member states; in particular those related to [[divorce]], [[child custody]] and [[international child abduction]].  It replaces Convention Council Regulation (EC) No 1347/2000 of 29 May 2000 on the jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility for joint children. The regulation does not apply to Denmark.

==Background==
The original Brussels II regulation was Regulation (EC) No 1347/2000. It was replaced with ''Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments'' which came into force on 1 August 2004 and applies from 1 March 2005 in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility.  The revised Brussels II legislation is variously referred to as Brussels II bis or B, or Brussels IIA, or the new Brussels II and repeals the older regulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/other/l33082_en.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.familylawweek.co.uk/site.aspx?i=ed347 David Hodson highlights the key provisions of Brussels II bis which came into force on 1 March 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

All member states of the European Union have also become party to the [[Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Co-operation in Respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children]], which largely overlaps with this regulation. For cases within the European Union, the regulation takes precedence over the convention. The European Union authorized the signature and ratification of the convention with council decisions 2003/93 and 2008/431 respectively. The authorization was necessary as the European Union and the member states had a shared competence over all matters of the convention and as the convention did not provide for the signature of "Regional Economic Integration Organizations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=European.eu|accessdate=1 April 2013|title=Convention on parental responsibility and protection of children| url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/judicial_cooperation_in_civil_matters/jl0046_en.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For Art 16 and 19 see '''Jefferson v O’Connor [2014] EWCA Civ 38''' where Lord Justice Vos ruled that the judge was wrong to order a stay of the proceedings on the basis of the Agreement. He ought to have held that the provisions of article 19 of the Council Regulation were applicable and could not be overridden by the Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.familylaw.co.uk/news_and_comment/jurisdiction-jefferson-v-oconnor-2014-ewca-civ-38#.WlPTsN9l9PY]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions==
The regulation concerns the jurisdiction responsible for parental responsibility, including the access to the child of the other parent. Jurisdiction is generally conferred to the courts connected to the child's habitual residence. The regulation also specifies procedures regarding [[International child abduction]], but does not take precedence over the [[Hague Child Abduction convention]] (to which all EU member states are parties). The jurisdiction and enforcement of [[Alimony|maintenance]] obligations([[alimony]], [[Child support|child maintenance]] etc.) fall outside the scope and is governed by the [[Maintenance directive]].

Between 15 April and 18 July 2014 the EU commission had a "[http://ec.europa.eu/justice/newsroom/civil/opinion/140415_en.htm Consultation on the functioning of the Brussels IIa Regulation (EC 2201/2003)]". The results, where all people who gave their address, were able to join should be published in a few months.

After appeal of lower court ruling that proceedings could move forward, Spain's National Court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction. 
In closing the investigation, Judge {{ill|José de la Mata Amaya|lt=José de la Mata|es}} applied reforms to the [[universal jurisdiction]] law introduced by the current{{When|date=May 2018}} Conservative government that imposed new limits on the jurisdiction of Spanish courts that require that cases involve suspects who are Spanish citizens or are living in Spain.

In March 2009 [[Baltasar Garzón]] was asked to consider whether Spain should allow charges to be filed against:
*[[Alberto Gonzales]], former [[White House Counsel]] and [[US Attorney General]];
*[[David Addington]], former [[Chief of Staff to the Vice President of the United States]] (under [[Dick Cheney]]).
*[[Jay Bybee]], head of the [[Office of Legal Counsel]], [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] (2001 March 2003); also at the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel; appointed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] in 2003 (currently serving);

Horton reported that Garzón had been urged to allow another judge, Ismail Moreno, to conduct the case, because he was still involved in the possible prosecution of Spanish former Guantanamo captives.

== Spanish Attorney General drops the charges  ==

On April 16, 2009, the Spanish [[Attorney General]], [[Cándido Conde-Pumpido]] stated he thought the Spanish investigative magistrate should drop the consideration of charges against the six men.&lt;ref name=Cnn2009-04-16&gt;

On April 17, 2009, Spain's attorney general, [[Cándido Conde-Pumpido]], said his office would not support Judge Baltasar Garzon's effort to prosecute six Bush Administration officials for their role in the US antiterror effort.  Spain's AG said any such prosecution would turn his nation's National Court "into a plaything" for politics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123993430198528009] Two Wins in the Terror War. The Wall Street Journal. April 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish Attorney General [[Cándido Conde-Pumpido]] believes that an American tribunal should judge the case (or dismiss it) before a Spanish Court ever thinks about becoming involved, prosecutors recommended that Judge should drop his investigation. As CNN reported, Mr. Conde-Pumpido told reporters that Judge’s plan threatened to turn the court “into a toy in the hands of people who are trying to do a political action”.

Under the Spanish justice system, investigating magistrates like Garzón are not under the authority of the Attorney General, and he can continue to consider laying charges even though the Attorney General has advised against it.&lt;ref name=Cnn2009-04-16 /&gt;

On April 23, 2009, Eloy Velasco took over responsibility for determining whether or not the six former Bush officials should face Spanish charges.&lt;ref name=Cnn2009-04-23&gt;

The four men:
[[Hamed Abderrahman Ahmed]], [[Lahcen Ikassrien]], [[Jamiel Abdul Latif al Banna]] and [[Omar Deghayes]], had previously faced charges in Spanish courts, based on confessions they made while in US custody.
Their charges had been dropped based on their claims that their confessions were false and were the result of abusive interrogation techniques.

On May 5, 2009, Investigating Magistrate Eloy Velasco formally requested the USA to indicate whether they were going to conduct a domestic inquiry into the six men's conduct.&lt;ref name=AssociatedPress2009-05-05&gt;

This law, however, would not retroactively put an end to the progress of current cases.  It would merely have stopped the initiation of similar cases.

According to historian [[Andy Worthington]], writing in the ''[[Huffington Post]]'',
Spanish newspaper ''[[Público (Spain)|Público]]'' had reported that Garzón was proceeding to the next phase of his investigation.&lt;ref name=HuffingtonPost2009-09-08&gt;

The cable suggests that the U.S. had intended to convince Spanish Officials to interfere with the National Court's [[judicial independence]]:

The cable reveals that Chief Prosecutor Javier Zaragoza intended to steer the case away from its assignment to Judge [[Baltasar Garzón]] who is well known for investigating a [[universal jurisdiction]] case targeting [[Chile]]an dictator [[Augusto Pinochet]] and has been an outspoken critic of the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay detention facility]] and has publicly stated that former President [[George W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16490">'''Capital Cost Allowance''' ('''CCA''') is the means by which [[Taxation in Canada|Canadian]] businesses may claim [[depreciation]] [[expense]] for calculating taxable income under the ''Income Tax Act'' (Canada). Similar allowances are in effect for calculating taxable income for provincial purposes.

==General rules for CCA calculation==

===Capital property===

Capital property eligible for CCA excludes:&lt;ref&gt;ITR s. 1102&lt;/ref&gt;

* land
* property the cost of which is deductible in computing the taxpayer's income
* property that is described in the taxpayer's inventory
* property that was not acquired for the purpose of gaining or producing income
* property that was acquired by an expenditure in respect of which the taxpayer is allowed a deduction under section 37
* specified artwork and crafts acquired after November 12, 1981
* property that is a camp, yacht, lodge or golf course or facility acquired after December 31, 1974 if any outlay or expense for the use or maintenance of that property is not deductible by virtue of paragraph 18(1)(l)

CCA is calculated on ''undepreciated capital cost'' ("UCC"), which is generally defined as:{{sfn|IT-285R2|1994|loc=par. 2}}

* the capital cost of property that is acquired or made available for use (whichever is the later date)
* ''plus'' legal, accounting, engineering or other fees incurred to acquire the property
* ''plus'', in the case of a property a taxpayer manufactures for his own use, it includes material, labour and overhead costs reasonably attributable to the property, but nothing for any profit which might have been earned had the asset been sold
* ''less'' the proceeds of disposition for a sold asset (but no greater than its original capital cost)
* ''less'' any assistance (including tax credits) the taxpayer has received with respect to the acquisition of the property
* ''less'' any CCA previously claimed with respect to the class

Where the UCC for a class is negative, a ''recapture of depreciation'' is deemed to take place, thus adding to taxable income and bringing the balance of UCC back to zero. Where UCC for a class is positive, but all assets with respect to that class have been disposed of, a ''terminal loss'' is deemed to take place, thus deducting from taxable income and bringing the balance of UCC back to zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tp/it478r2/it478r2-e.html|title = IT-478R2: Capital Cost Allowance - Recapture and Terminal Loss}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CCA calculation===

CCA itself is generally calculated using the following items:

:''CCA'' = capital cost allowance for the current fiscal period
:''UCC'' = undepreciated capital cost before claiming CCA in the current fiscal period
:''t'' = the proportion of days in the current fiscal period vs a normal fiscal period, if the current fiscal period is a stub, otherwise 1
:''d'' = the specified CCA rate with respect to the class
:''a'' = acquisition cost of the property in the current fiscal period
:''b'' = proceeds of disposition with respect to the property in the current fiscal period (but not greater than its original cost)
:''c'' = assistance received with respect to the property in the current fiscal period (net of any repayments made)

For assets subject to the full-year rule:

&lt;math&gt;CCA = tdUCC&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ITR s. 1100(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

For assets subject to the half-year rule:

&lt;math&gt;CCA = tdUCC - \frac{1}{2}td\left ( a - b - c \right )&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ITR s. 1100(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of allowance===

Under the ''Income Tax Act'':&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/index.html|title =  ''Income Tax Act'' (R.S.C., 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.))}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* paragraph 18(1)(b) prohibits the deduction of any outlay, loss or replacement of capital, payment on account of capital or any allowance for depreciation, obsolescence or depletion, unless specifically allowed in Part I of the Act. 
* paragraph 20(1)(a) allows a deduction, in computing the income from a business or property, of any amount allowed by regulation in respect of the capital cost of a property.{{sfn|IT-285R2|1994|loc=par. 1}}

Part XI of the ''Income Tax Regulations'' provides for the calculation rules for CCA,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.,_c._945/page-45.html#h-105 |title=ITR Part XI |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121227115959/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.%2C_c._945/page-45.html#h-105 |archivedate=2012-12-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Schedule II outlines the various classes of capital property that are eligible for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.,_c._945/page-220.html#h-448 |title=ITR Schedule II |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224040746/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.%2C_c._945/page-220.html#h-448 |archivedate=2012-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Special rules are in place to deem certain assets to be in separate classes, thus not becoming part of the general pool for the class.&lt;ref&gt;ITR s. 1102&lt;/ref&gt; Certain elections are available to taxpayers to transfer or reclassify assets from one class to another.&lt;ref&gt;ITR s. 1103&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional allowances are prescribed with respect to specified circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;ITR s. 1100(1)&lt;/ref&gt; Specialized calculations for certain classes are also outlined in:

Part XVII of the ''Income Tax Regulations'' provides for specialized calculation rules for CCA with respect to capital property acquired for use in earning income from farming and fishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.,_c._945/page-71.html |title=ITR Part XVII |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922053007/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.%2C_c._945/page-71.html |archivedate=2015-09-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the practice followed in the United States for depreciation there is no penalty for failing to claim Capital Cost Allowance.  Where a taxpayer claims less than the amount of CCA to which he is entitled the pool remains intact, and available for claims in future years.  Unclaimed amounts are not subject to recapture.

==[[Capital budgeting|Capital investment appraisal]] under CCA rules==

Because assets subject to CCA are generally pooled by class, and CCA is generally calculated on a declining-balance basis, specific techniques have been developed to determine the net present after-tax value of such capital investments. For standard scenarios under the full-year rule and half-year rule models, the following standard items are employed:{{sfn|Edge|Irvine|1981|p=64}}

:''I'' = Investment
:''d'' = CCA rate per year for tax purposes
:''t'' = rate of taxation
:''n'' = number of years
:''i'' = [[cost of capital]], rate of interest, or minimum rate of return (whichever is most relevant)

More specialized analysis would need to be applied to:

:* assets with specific lives (i.e. Classes 13 and 14)
:* assets with non-standard rate calculations (i.e. Class 29)
:* assets that are deemed to constitute a separate class of property, thus not becoming part of a capital cost pool
:* scenarios where disposal values at a future date are part of the appraisal calculation, leading to a deduction from the capital cost pool, a recapture of depreciation, or the calculation of a taxable capital gain

===Full-year rule===

Capital cost allowance will be calculated as follows:{{sfn|Edge|Irvine|1981|pp=64{{endash}}65}}

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Year
! Calculated CCA
|-
|1
|&lt;math&gt;Id&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|2
|&lt;math&gt;Id(1-d)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|3
|&lt;math&gt;Id(1-d)^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|''n''
|&lt;math&gt;Id(1-d)^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Therefore, the [[Tax shield]] in year ''n'' = &lt;math&gt;Itd(1-d)^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;, and the present value of the taxation credits will be equal to &lt;math&gt;Itd \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(1-d)^{n-1}}{(1+i)^n}&lt;/math&gt;

As this is an example of a converging series for a [[geometric progression]], this can be simplified further to become:

&lt;math&gt;PV = \frac{Itd}{i+d}&lt;/math&gt;

The net present after-tax value of a capital investment then becomes:

&lt;math&gt;I \left (1-\frac{td}{i+d}\right )&lt;/math&gt;{{sfn|Edge|Irvine|1981|p=65}}

===Half-year rule===

For capital investments where CCA is calculated under the half-year rule, the CCA tax shield calculation is modified as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
PV &amp; = \frac{1}{2}\left (\frac{Itd}{i+d}\right ) + \frac{1}{2}\left (\frac{Itd}{i+d}\right )\left (\frac{1}{1+i}\right ) \\
&amp; =\frac{Itd}{i+d}\left [\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{1+i}\right ] \\
&amp; =\frac{Itd}{i+d}\left [\frac{\frac{1}{2}\left (1+i\right ) + \frac{1}{2}}{1+i}\right ] \\
&amp; =\left (\frac{Itd}{i+d}\right )\left (\frac{1+\frac{1}{2}i}{1+i}\right ) \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the net present after-tax value of a capital investment is determined to be:

&lt;math&gt;I \left [ 1-\left (\frac{td}{i+d}\right )\left (\frac{1+\frac{1}{2}i}{1+i}\right ) \right ]&lt;/math&gt;

==Case Law==

In cases where claims have been contested or disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency, the Supreme Court of Canada has interpreted the Capital Cost Allowance in a fairly broad manner, allowing deductions on property which was owned for a very brief period of time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Hickman Motors Ltd. v. Canada|link=|year=1997|court=scc|num=357|format=canlii|parallelcite=[1997] 2 SCR 336|date=1997-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and property which is leased back to the vendor from which it originated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Canada|link=|year=2005|court=scc|num=54|parallelcite=[2005] 2 SCR 601|date=2005-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; These decisions demonstrate the flexibility of the Capital Cost Allowance as a legal tax reduction strategy.

The '''Ciarán Tobin extradition case''' concerns requests for the [[extradition]] of Irish businessman Francis Ciarán Tobin from [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] to [[Hungary]]. Tobin is the subject of a [[European Arrest Warrant]] issued by the Hungarian authorities after he was found guilty of causing serious bodily harm by negligent driving when his car went out of control killing two Hungarian children in the village of [[Leányfalu]] near [[Budapest]] in April 2000. He was tried in his absence after he failed to return from Ireland for his trial.

After joining the [[European Union]] in 2004, Hungary issued a European Arrest Warrant for Tobin's forcible surrender to Hungary to serve his prison sentence. The [[Irish Supreme Court]] has refused to extradite Tobin on two separate occasions.

Twelve years after the case, Irish Prime Minister [[Enda Kenny]] expressed regret but confirmed that the case is officially closed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://index.hu/kulfold/2012/11/10/az_ir_kormanyfo_nem_talat_megoldast_a_tobin-ugyre/ Index.hu]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014 Tobin started to serve his time in prison.

==Facts==
Ciarán Tobin is an Irish citizen. In 2000 he was working as a senior manager of [[Irish Life and Permanent]] Hungary, having been seconded there. On 9 April 2000, he was driving towards [[Budapest]] through the village of [[Leányfalu]]. His speed was established as at least {{convert|70|km/h|abbr=on}} in a {{convert|50|km/h|abbr=on}} zone. According to Tobin, he was in the process of changing lanes when his car became unresponsive, failed to straighten out into the rightmost lane and mounted the pavement.&lt;ref&gt;''Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform v Tobin'' [2012] IESC 37, [http://www.courts.ie/judgments.nsf/f69fbd31c73dda2580256cd400020877/4ca2ae8b10c86e7480257a22004f3a7b?OpenDocument Judgement of Hardiman J.], unnumbered paragraph beginning, "The circumstances of the accident giving rise to these proceedings, ...".&lt;/ref&gt; On mounting the pavement the car caused the immediate deaths of two children, 2-year-old Petra Zoltai who was sitting in a pram, and her brother 5-year-old Márton Zoltai.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news|last=McDonald|first=Dearbhail|title=Courts refuse to extradite man in child death crash|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/courts-refuse-to-extradite-man-in-child-death-crash-995625.html|accessdate=15 February 2012|newspaper=The Irish Independent|date=9 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="origocikk"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gergely|first=Zsófia|title=Visszatért, mégis futni hagyták az ír gázolót|url=http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20080413-nagykovet-kampanyolt-az-ir-gazolo-hazaengedeseert.html|accessdate=15 February 2012|newspaper=Origo.hu|date=14 April 2008|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial and departure from Hungary==
In the immediate aftermath of the accident, Mr. Tobin was placed under formal investigation by the Hungarian police and was taken to a police station to be interviewed. Mr. Tobin was not acquainted with any Hungarian lawyers but knew a young Hungarian woman Káta Soós whose father Tibor Soós was a lawyer. In the interviews which followed Ms. Soós was asked by the police to act as an interpreter in the absence of anyone else present who could speak both English and Hungarian.

Mr. Tobin was subsequently charged with negligent driving causing serious bodily harm and in accordance with Hungarian law chose not to attend court but was represented throughout the criminal proceedings by his lawyers. When Tobin was first interviewed by the police they had asked him to present his passport which they retained. In the autumn of 2000 he requested the return of his passport so that he could visit Ireland for a wedding and to see his family. This request was granted but he was not asked to return his passport on his return on 9 October 2000. On 30 October 2000 Tobin returned to Ireland permanently, his period of secondment to Irish Life Hungary having come to an end.

Tobin's trial took place in Hungary on 7 May 2002 in Mr. Tobin's absence albeit in the presence of lawyers acting on Tobin's behalf. Statements made by Tobin after his arrest were ruled to be inadmissible on the basis that they had been translated by his lawyer's daughter. His trial took place under section 187 of the Hungarian criminal code which provides that:

{{quote|(1) A person who causes grievous bodily harm to another person or persons by violating the rules of public road traffic, by negligence, commits a misdemeanour, and shall be punishable with imprisonment of up to one year, labour in the public interest, or fine.

(2) The punishment shall be

:a) imprisonment of up to three years, if the crime causes enduring handicap, serious health injury or mass catastrophe,

:b) imprisonment between one to five years, if the crime causes death,

:c) imprisonment from two years to eight years, if the crime causes the death of more than two persons or a fatal mass catastrophe.}}

He was convicted and sentenced to three years in prison. On appeal his sentence was amended to allow for the possibility of parole after 18 months.

==Tobin 1==
Meanwhile Hungary joined the European Union on 1 May 2004, and transposed the [[European Arrest Warrant]] framework decision into their national law. Hungary requested the surrender of Mr. Tobin by issuing a European Arrest Warrant. However, a judge of the Irish High Court, Mr. Justice Peart, refused the surrender on the basis that Tobin had not "fled" Hungary as required by the Irish legislation which implemented the framework decision, since he left Hungary with the consent of the Hungarian authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/act/pub/0045/sec0002.html Ireland's EAW Act 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.ie/80256F2B00356A6B/0/A51EA174E57B4194802573560039323C?Open&amp;Highlight=0,Tobin,~language_en~ High Court Judgement]&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was later upheld by the [[Irish Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.ie/80256F2B00356A6B/0/A8355D8C734A781C802573FC00527B22?Open&amp;Highlight=0,Tobin,~language_en~ Supreme Court Judgement]&lt;/ref&gt; The Irish authorities also refused the Hungarian request to make Mr. Tobin serve his time in an Irish prison, an option within the EAW framework decision but never implemented in Ireland

Hungary, on the other hand, strongly disagreed with this interpretation of the EAW law and the word "flee".&lt;ref&gt;Hungarian Minister of Justice Tibor Draskovics letter to the European Commission&lt;/ref&gt; Hungary argued that anyone not returning to serve his or her sentence is fleeing from justice. Hungary kept the warrant in effect as the Irish decision has no bearing for other EU members. Hungary also explored other legal options, including turning to various EU fora, to enforce its court's decision.

==Tobin 2==
In 2009, Ireland amended its domestic EAW legislation to bring it into line with the EAW framework decision by removing the requirement that, in conviction cases, a person the subject of a EAW had "fled" the issuing country.&lt;ref&gt;by
[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0028/sec0006.html section 6] of the ''Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009''&lt;/ref&gt; An amendment which came into force on 29 August 2009. On 17 September 2010, Hungary issued a new European Arrest Warrant seeking Tobin's arrest and surrender. Tobin was arrested on 10 November 2009 and his surrender was ordered on 11 February 2011 by Mr. Justice Peart, the same High Court judge who had previously refused the surrender.

However, Mr. Tobin was again successful in gaining the leave of the High Court to appeal its decision. Notwithstanding this Ciaran Tobin voluntarily entered custody in Ireland on 9 November 2011 on the basis that any time spent in prison in Ireland will be deducted from any time in prison that he might ultimately spend in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man wanted in Hungary enters custody|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/1109/breaking36.html|accessdate=15 February 2012|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. Tobin won the appeal against surrender on 19 June 2012 when the Supreme Court over-ruled the High Court on a three to two majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man wins appeal against extradition to Hungary over deaths of children |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/0620/1224318257596.html |accessdate=23 June 2012 |newspaper=The Irish Times |date=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In prison==
On 14 January 2014 Mr. Tobin voluntarily returned to Hungary to begin his prison sentence in a Hungarian jail. As a part of an agreement with the Hungarian Minister of Justice, Mr. [[Tibor Navracsics]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.politics.hu/20130924/justice-minister-sees-opportunity-to-resolve-tobin-case/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.politics.hu/20131108/tobin-asks-for-more-time-to-decide-about-serving-sentence-in-hungary/&lt;/ref&gt; on 17 January Mr. Tobin flew back to Ireland to serve the remainder of his time there.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/ciaran-tobin-begins-hungarian-prison-sentence-after-killing-two-children-in-crash-29915243.html&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 February 2014 Mr Tobin sent a letter to the family of the deceased children in which he expressed his regret and apologized. According to the lawyer of the family, the father sees it as a kind of closing of the case.&lt;ref&gt;http://hetivalasz.hu/vilag/az-apa-ezzel-lezartnak-tekinti-az-ugyet-72916&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Civil-law notaries''', or '''Latin notaries''', are agents of [[contentious jurisdiction|noncontentious]] [[private law|private]] [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] who draft, take, and record instruments for private parties and are vested as public officers with the authentication power of the State. As some [[notary public|notaries public]], their [[Common law|common-law]] counterparts, civil-law notaries are highly trained, licensed practitioners providing a range of regulated services, and whereas they hold a public office, they nonetheless operate usually—but not always—in private practice and are paid on a fee-for-service basis. They often receive the same education as attorneys at civil law but without qualifications in advocacy, [[procedural law]], or the law of [[evidence (law)|evidence]], somewhat comparable to [[solicitor]] training in certain common-law countries.

Civil-law notaries are limited to areas of private law, that is, domestic law which regulates the relationships between individuals and in which the State is not directly concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irishbarrister.com/legalterms.html|title=Kieron Wood's pages|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common areas of practice for civil-law notaries are in residential and commercial conveyancing and registration, contract drafting, company formation, successions and [[estate planning]], and [[Power of attorney|powers of attorney]].&lt;ref&gt;John Henry Merryman and Rogelio Pérez-Perdomo (2007). ''The Civil Law Tradition: An Introduction to the Legal Systems of Europe and Latin America'', 3rd ed. (Stanford: Stanford University Press), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Ordinarily, they have no authority to appear in court on their client's behalf; their role is limited to drafting, authenticating, and registering certain types of transactional or legal instruments. In some countries, such as the [[Netherlands]], [[France]] or [[Italy]], among others, they also retain and keep a [[minutes|minute]] copy of their instruments—in the form of [[memoranda]]—in notarial '''protocols''', or archives.

Notaries generally hold undergraduate degrees in civil law and graduate degrees in notarial law. Notarial law involves expertise in a broad spectrum of private law including [[family law]], estate and testamentary law, conveyancing and [[property law]], the law of [[Agency (law)|agency]], and contract and company law. Student notaries must complete a long apprenticeship or articled clerkship as a trainee notary and usually spend some years as a junior associate in a notarial firm before working as a partner or opening a private practice. Any such practice is usually tightly regulated, and most countries parcel out areas into notarial districts with a set number of notary positions. This has the effect of making notarial appointments very limited.

==Notarial instruments==
A civil-law notary draws up and executes [[legal instrument]]s called [[act (document)|notarial instruments]] (Fr ''acte notarié'', Sp ''instrumento notarial'', It ''atto notarile'', Du ''notariële akte'', Ger ''notarielle Urkunde'', ''Notariatsurkunde''). To be valid, a notarial instrument must be signed contemporaneously (''uno contextu'') by the '''appearer'''(s) (parties to the instrument), sometimes in the presence of attesting witnesses, before the notary who also signs and officiates the signing ceremony.

===Status at law===
Notarial instruments, if ''prima facie'' duly executed, are:
* [[presumption|presumed]] valid and regular;
* [[self-authenticating document|self-authenticating]];
* probative (i.e., proof of their contents);
* public;
* self-executing; and
* have a ''data certa'', i.e., a fixed, unalterable effective date.
Traditionally, notarial instruments trigger a ''præsumptio veritatis et solemnitatis'' entailing two consequences—regularity and probativity. First, being an official act, a [[presumption of regularity]] attaches to the instrument, meaning all prescribed formalities have been carried out, including the reading over of the instrument. Second, a notarial instrument is self-authenticating and probative, i.e., it constitutes full proof of the agreement it contains, as against the parties, their heirs, and successors. It also means the notary's firsthand (''ex propriis sensibus'') narrations of fact are conclusively presumed true and correct, whereas secondhand narrations (appearers' representations) are merely ''assertio notarii'' which are rebuttably presumed valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Malavet|1998|pp=956–957}}&lt;/ref&gt; While all notarial instruments are official documents, they are not all necessarily public; most instruments are '''in public form''', meaning an original is retained ''in publica custodia'' by the notary in his or her protocol or recorded with a public registry, but some are '''in private form''', that is, a single original is issued directly to the appearer(s). In either case, the appearer always walks away with an instrument that is self-executing, that is, it requires no further implementing action to be effective and enforceable, just like a court order. Finally, notarial instruments have a fixed effective or signature date (''data certa'') that cannot be ante- or postdated, or left blank and filled in after signing.

====Secondary effects====
Notarial instruments cannot be altered or overridden by prior or subsequent instruments under hand (e.g., simple contracts). In other words, for example, a notarial will could not be amended or superseded by a non-notarial codicil or will. They also [[estoppel|estop]] (preclude) an appearer as contract denier from raising most [[affirmative defenses]] as to enforceability, including:  (1) ''[[non est factum]]'', (2) the contents do not correctly express the appearers' intentions, and (3) defenses against formation (e.g., ''ultra vires'', lack of capacity, improper execution, etc.).

One thing that distinguishes a civil-law notary's instruments from those of a common lawyer is the fact that, under [[common law|common law legal systems]], drafts and non-identical copies are considered separate documents, while under civil law public documents may be proved by secondary evidence. An unexecuted minute is deemed firsthand proof of an instrument and considered the original, whereas the engrossment is not. The minute is therefore the ''authenticum'', or original instrument of writing, as distinguished from the self-executing copy, or ''instrumentum''.

====Rebuttal====
A notarial instrument’s “valid” portions are open to direct rebuttal, but the “conclusive” portions can, in some jurisdictions, only be rebutted by an '''action of improbation''' (Fr ''inscription de faux'', It ''querela di falso'', Germ ''Fälschungsklage'') in which a challenger must bring a collateral attack against the instrument,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Malavet|1998|p=957}}&lt;/ref&gt; proving a willful material error by strong, clear, and positively convincing proof, rather than the ordinary preponderance of evidence standard in civil actions. Legally, a successful challenge must overcome the ''praesumptio iustae causa'' which attaches to a notarial instrument, the result of which is that said instrument is presumed to have been made or formed with a ''iusta causa'', that is, sufficient legal consideration (''causa''). This presumption stems from the fact that a notary is expected to verify the facts, assertions, or events mentioned in his act, thereby assuming liability for and giving warrant to its contents. A successfully improbated instrument is null and set aside.

===Forms===
Nowadays, a public-form instrument is prepared first as an unexecuted original called a '''minute''' (Fr ''minute'', It ''matrice'', Sp ''matriz'', Du ''minuut'', Ger ''Urschrift''). The minute is archived in the draftsman notary's protocol (Fr ''protocole'', It/Sp ''protocolo'', Ger ''Urkundenrolle''). The instrument's particulars—appearer, fees, subject matter, witnesses, date, and so forth—are noted or minuted in a register or logbook. From the minute the notary extends a fully engrossed execution copy, known as an '''engrossment''' (Fr/Du ''grosse'', It ''spedizione in forma esecutiva'', Sp ''testimonio'', ''copia autorizada'', Ger ''Ausfertigung''), which is self-executing since it contains not only the material terms but also solemn and statutory notarial wording and, in some jurisdictions, enacting clauses like those found on court orders. It is also the only copy that has fresh signatures and seals on it. The engrossed copy is issued directly to the appearer(s). However, appearers are generally only entitled to one engrossment, so any other copy issued thereafter is a notarial '''[[exemplified copy]]''' which does not contain the appearers' fresh signatures and lacks the formalities of the engrossment; exemplified copies (Fr ''expédition'', It ''spedizione'', Sp ''copia certificada'', ''copia simple'', Du ''uitgift'', ''authentiek afschrift'', Ger ''beglaubigte Abschrift'') are therefore only for reference purposes.

Certain types of instruments are passed ''in private form'', that is, only one copy—the original—is made and issued to the appearer while the draftsman notary does not retain a copy. Private-form instruments are usually unilateral, have short-term legal effect, and do not benefit third parties, such as certificates of good standing, powers of attorney, certificates of dishonor, statutory declarations, verifications of fact, rent and pay receipts, and pension and annuity arrears documents.

Additionally, some jurisdictions, especially those influenced by the [[Allgemeines bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|Austrian Civil Code]], divide notarial instruments into three types:
* operative (Aust ''Notariatsakt'', Du ''partij-akte'', Sp ''escritura pública''):  memorializes and effects irrevocable legal business; includes all transactional and governing instruments;
* declaratory (Aust ''Notariatsprotokoll'', Du ''proces-verbaal akte'', Sp ''acta notarial''):  records or notifies legal actions, facts, or rights; includes statutory declarations, company minutes, and registry memorials;
* certificatory (Germ ''notarielle Beglaubigung'', Du ''notariële waarmerking'', Sp ''certificación notarial''):  attests personal status details; includes life certificates, certificates of good standing, copy certifications, signature attestations.

==Distinction from American Notaries Public==
Save for [[Louisiana]], [[Puerto Rico]], and [[Quebec]], a civil-law notary should not be confused with a [[notary public]] in the United States and Canada, who has none of the legal powers notaries enjoy at civil law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Piombino|first1=Alfred E.|title=Notary Public Handbook: Principles, Practices &amp; Cases, National Edition|date=2011|publisher=East Coast Publishing|location=Poughkeepsie, New York, USA|isbn=978-0-9445606-9-3|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, notaries public only have the power to administer oaths, take affidavits, declarations or depositions from witnesses, acknowledge and attest signatures, and certify copies, usually in conjunction with some legal process. The same does not apply to notaries public in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and many other Common Law countries. There the notary public is a lawyer and often holds a secondary legal qualification, such as solicitor or barrister. The aspiring Notary Public usually has to take additional exams or undertake post graduate study to become a notary public. In Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and Quebec, private law is traditionally based on the French and Spanish civil codes, giving notaries greater legal powers, including the right to prepare wills, conveyances and generally all contracts and instruments in writing.  For this reason, immigrants from civil-law countries where civil-law notaries exist, particularly those from [[Latin America]], are often confused by the office of notary public and have been defrauded by dishonest notaries misrepresenting themselves as having legal powers.  Thus, in some states there have been ongoing efforts to prohibit notaries public from listing themselves as ''notario público''.  Such a law has existed for more than fifteen years in [[California]]. Similar laws now exist in [[Colorado]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Illinois]], [[Tennessee]] and [[Texas]].

[[Florida]] (1997) and [[Alabama]] (1999) have enacted statutes and regulations, based on the [[Model Civil Law Notary Act]], allowing for the appointment of Florida&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://notaries.dos.state.fl.us/pdf/Civil-law_notary.pdf |format=PDF |title=Fla. Stat. § 118.10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://notaries.dos.state.fl.us/pdf/1N6001_Florida_Civil-law_Notary.pdf |format=PDF |title=Fla. Admin. Code. § 1N-6.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Alabama&lt;ref&gt;Ala. Code § 36-20-50&lt;/ref&gt; attorneys as civil-law notaries with the power to authenticate documents, facts and transactions. This is not the same as a notary public appointment. Attorneys with a minimum of 5 years of Bar membership are appointed after specialized training and state examination. Acts of Florida and Alabama civil-law notaries are given both domestic and international effect under their enabling statutes.

==Netherlands==
Every Dutch notary ({{lang-nl|notaris}}) is part of the Royal Society of Notaries (''Koninklijke Notariële Beroepsorganisatie (KNB)'') and occupy a special position relative to other legal practitioners such as attorneys, court bailiffs, and tax advisors. This is apparent first and foremost from the fact that notaries are public officers appointed by the justice minister and provide regulated legal services. As a qualified lawyer, a notary takes on clients, is paid on a fee-for-service basis, and is appointed for life by the Crown. Life appointment is designed to safeguard the independence needed by notaries to discharge their functions.

Notaries are independent and disinterested. Unlike attorneys or legal advisors, a notary does not represent or act in the interest of any one party. Instead, under the Dutch legal system, notaries are required to act impartially on behalf of all parties to a contract or transaction. For example, when real property is conveyed, notaries act for both the seller and buyer. They are subject to legal professional privilege and are therefore duty-bound not to betray client confidentiality, thereby giving them the right to withhold information in court as would an attorney or doctor. In cases where a notary acts as legal advisor to a particular interested party, the advising notary must counsel all parties including third party beneficiaries.

All notaries are law graduates. Not only are they experts in family, estate, company, and property laws, but they must also stay up-to-date about pertinent cases and certain aspects of tax legislation. If necessary, a Dutch notary will instruct and call on the services of other legal practitioners. However, under no circumstances may a notary represent clients in court.

Apart from advising, a notary also draws, executes, and retains instruments either by statute or at the parties' request. Under Dutch law, a notarially executed instrument is probative as of the ''data certa'' (''vaste datum'') and subscription of the parties. Notaries archive the minute (protocol copy, Dutch ''minuut'') and issue [[exemplified copy|exemplifications]] (''authentiek afschrift'') to the parties. The only fully executed copy, known as the engrossement (''grosse''), is ''prima facie'' demonstrative evidence of its contents, similar to a court order. There is therefore no need for the party to or custodian of a notarial instrument to provide extraneous evidence to verify the instrument's probativity. And under Dutch law, for instruments to be self-executing they must be drawn up as public instruments, which is why any instrument drafted by a common-law lawyer, which is never public, is not self-executing in the Netherlands.

The new ''Notaries Act'' (''Wet op het Notarisambt''), commenced in October 1999 (156 years after the original act), reinforces the official position of notaries, but also expands on and adds to their traditional services. The consolidation of the notary's official position is, for example, reflected in the way the requirements of impartiality and independence have been enshrined in law, the many regulations a notary and notary's clerk are required to adhere to, and the fact that a notary is prohibited from acting as an attorney. Market forces have widened the possibility for notary's clerks to become notaries and for competition. However, the 1999 Act did not make substantial changes to the profession. While Dutch notaries are public officers and their instruments are public instruments, they are not government employees and instead act as independent private practitioners.

The new law makes it easier for notaries’ clerks to set up a practice and gives notaries more freedom in determining their fees for services. The Act has provided for the establishment of an external committee of experts; if notary's clerks submit a sound business plan to the committee, they have a greater chance to be approved to set up their own practice. Greater freedom in the fees a notary can charge implies that the Royal Society of Notaries no longer fixes fees or prescribes rates. Since July 2003 notaries have been free to establish their own fees. Maximum rate caps fixed by authorities now apply only to family law services in certain circumstances.

==France==
[[File:Flourish of a French royal notary.jpg|thumb|1400 French royal notary flourish]]
A French civil-law notary, or ''[[:fr:notaire|notaire]]'', is a highly specialized lawyer in private practice appointed as a public officer by the [[Ministry of Justice (France)|justice minister]]. The profession began admitting women in 1948, and by the start of 2008 women numbered 2,104 and accounted for 24.2% of all notaries.&lt;ref name="juriforum"&gt;"Notaire", ''Juriforum'', from ''Le droit et ses métiers 2009'', [html], retrieved 25 August 2009: available at [http://www.juriforum.fr/modules/lja_controller.php?PAGE=gmd&amp;sourceGmd=fichesMetiers&amp;idGmd=25410]{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notarial office (''étude'') usually includes ancillary staff like notaries' clerks (''clerc de notaire'') of different kinds, e.g., junior (''clerc employé''), specialist (''clerc technicien''), and supervisory clerks (''clerc cadre''). Each level is divided into at least three pay grades,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fgcen-fo.com/convention2.htm|title=FGCEN FO|work=FGCEN FO|accessdate=6 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222171654/http://www.fgcen-fo.com/convention2.htm|archivedate=22 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as legal secretaries, trainee notaries (''notaire stagiaire''), and accountants. In smaller offices, succession clerks are kept separate since their work differs significantly from other practice areas; in larger firms, clerks are separated into divisions by specialization. While most clerks are caseworkers, some work as costing specialists or formalities clerks. Secretaries oftentimes go on to pursue clerking.

===Education===
Notaries and notaries' clerks—a form of [[paralegal]]—earn undergraduate law degrees (''diplôme de notariat de 1er cycle'') from an accredited notarial law school (''école de notariat''). Managing clerks (''principal clerc'') must obtain a special graduate clerking degree (''diplôme de premier clerc'').

Law graduates must then earn a 1-year master's degree in law (MCL) (''master 1 en droit'') and either continue in a university law school or enroll at a notary institute (''centre de formation professionnelle notariale'') to earn a second graduate degree in notarial law for which specializations exist, including:  conflict of laws, advanced tax law, overseas territories, EU law, struggling businesses, company law, intellectual property, farm tenancy and agri-business, city planning and environmental law, and estate planning.

There are 2 postgraduate options:  a university track (''voie universitaire'') and a vocational track (''voie professionnelle'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rioufol|Rico|2004|pp=6–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* University track: 1 year of university coursework for a Master's in notarial law (''master 2 en droit notarial''), followed by a 2-year, in-office traineeship (''stage de notaire''), supplemented with 4 semester-long practice courses and capped by a Master's thesis. At the end the graduate receives a ''diplôme supérieur de notariat''.
* Vocational track: begins with a competitive entrance exam in applied legal studies and is followed by 1 year of institute coursework for a Postgraduate Diploma in Notarial Practice (''diplôme d'aptitude aux fonctions de notaire''). Students must also complete a 2-year traineeship supplemented with 6 week-long practice seminars.

Formerly, there was a non-degree option involving a lengthy apprenticeship. In addition, notaries' clerks with a minimum of 9 years of in-office experience, with 6 of those spent as a junior clerk, as well as judges and attorneys/solicitors of 6 years standing, may become a notary by passing a professional exam. Notaries are also required to attend regular continuing education courses and seminars.

===Practice===
In France, notarial instruments, whether in public (''en minute'') or private form (''en brevet''), have a high degree of authority and are considered probative instruments (''[[:fr:acte authentique|acte authentique]]''), received as firsthand and primary evidence in court, and thereby accorded high evidentiary value and executory force, and deemed to be proof of their contents. A notarial instrument also fixes the date at which its parties are bound without prior delivery and acceptance (as opposed to a [[deed]] or [[contract]] under common law) and the '''data certa'''{{efn|Under French law a legal instrument is said to have a ''date certaine'', or fixed effective date, at signing if in public form or upon acknowledgement if in private form and which cannot be altered, i.e., ante- or postdated. The data certa is the date from which time limits or terms are determined and when [[Third-party beneficiary|third-party benefits]] commence or [[privity of contract]] is in force. It is not a [[date certain]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry Campbell Black, ''A Dictionary of Law'', s.v. "Date certaine" (St. Paul, Minn.: West Publishing, 1891), 318.&lt;/ref&gt;}} (''date certaine'') of the act's execution so as to safeguard against third party claims. To be rebutted or challenged, a notarial act must be subjected to a rescissory action called an improbation action (''[[:fr:inscription de faux en écriture publique|inscription de faux]]'') to prove the act contains errors or has been maliciously altered, interlineated, edited, or falsified.&lt;ref&gt;Serge Guinchard and Gabriel Montaignier, eds. (2007). ''Lexique des termes juridiques'', 16th edn., s.v. "Inscription de faux" (Paris: Dalloz), p. 360.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notaries engage in a wide variety of legal activities ranging from contract drafting and legal advising—primarily in company, family, and property law. Roughly 50% of French notarial business involves real estate conveyancing, leasing, and construction.  Domestic affairs, e.g., adoptions, marital agreements, divorces, and the like, as well as estate planning account for another 26%.&lt;ref name="juriforum"/&gt; Preparing notarial acts for private parties, informing parties as to the scope of their contractual obligations, ensuring that the instrument or contract is fair and unbiased, and acting as a non-contentious and impartial advocate for the business transaction as a whole, notaries prevent and resolve many potential conflicts beforehand.

Notaries have a monopoly on marital agreements, marital property systems, estate administration, and conveyancing (realty sales, mortgages, etc.). They are also experts in the law of property with exclusive access to France's M.I.N. database which contains all property transfer and conveyance information. This gives notaries a singular advantage in gauging the property market, thus allowing them to appraise property, conduct transactions, and handle taxes and financing.
[[File:St-Aulaye 24 Pannonceau notaire3 2013.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|left]]
In France, when a notarial act is passed before one notary subscribing, it is said to be ''ordinaire'', or in simple form, and when before two notaries with the second attesting, then it is ''solennel'', or in solemn form.{{efn|Used, for instance, for notarial wills, an illiterate subscriber, or a forced heir's renunciation of [[inheritance]].}}  Acts may be drawn up in public or private form, said ''en minute'' and ''en brevet'' respectively.  When drawn in private form, the single executed original is issued to the client, and its particulars are logged in the notary's register.  When in public form, one un-executed minute copy (''minute'') is retained of record in the notary's protocol, thereby constituting a public instrument, and a fully engrossed execution copy (called a ''grosse'' and now termed ''copie exécutoire'') is issued to the client and is headed and footed with the same ''formule exécutoire''{{efn|The ''formule exécutoire'' or "enactment clause" reads in French at an act's head: ''République française, au nom du peuple français'', in English, "Republic of France, in the name of the people of France"; and at the foot: ''En conséquence, la République Française mande et ordonne à tous Huissiers de Justice sur ce requis de mettre la dite décision à exécution, aux Procureurs Généraux et aux Procureurs de la République près les Tribunaux de Grande Instance d'y tenir la main à tous Commandants et Officiers de la Force Publique de prêter main-forte lorsqu'ils en seront légalement requis. En foi de quoi, les présentes établies sur (...) feuillets ont été collationnées, reconnues conformes à la minute, signées, scellées et délivrées par Me NAME, notaire à LOCATION. Pour première copie éxécutoire.''; in English, this means "THEREFORE, HEREBY COMMANDED AND DIRECTED are all marshals and sheriffs to carry out this writ, all prosecutors to abide thereby, and all law enforcement officers to provide assistance when legally required to do so. IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, the foregoing, consisting of X pages, is a true and correct copy of the minute hereof, to certify which I have granted these presents under my notarial firm and seal. True Engrossed Copy Attest.".}} or "enactment clause" used on court orders and writs. Minutes and engrossements are only drawn up once, and, should a past client lose their copy or need further copies, by law, said person may only receive exemplifications (''expédition'', now termed ''copie authentique''){{efn|Ended in French with: ''POUR COPIE AUTHENTIQUE. LE SOUSSIGNÉ, dont le nom figure sur le sceau apposé ci-dessous, Notaire à xxx, CERTIFIE, la présente copie authentique établie sur dix-neuf pages, exactement collationnée et conforme à la minute de l'acte (dont elle est la reproduction.)''; in English, "A TRUE EXEMPLIFIED COPY. I, Notary of X, whose name appearing in the seal hereinabove affixed, DO HEREBY CERTIFY AND ATTEST that these presents, consisting of 19 pages, are a true copy of the original of which it purports to be a copy, I having carefully collated and compared said copy with the said original and found the same to agree therewith.".}} of the act.  Notaries also issue detailed or summary abstracts of acts (''extrait authentique'') and make notarial certified copies (''copie collationnée'') of documents not in their custody.

===Professional organizations===
All French notaries are jointly and severally liable for professional errors in the performance of their duties. When liable, damages are paid from a nationwide consolidated indemnity fund. Group liability of this kind is otherwise unprecedented. Notaries are therefore required to take out professional indemnity insurance for the due protection of their clients. French notaries are part of and regulated by a local or county notaries society, or ''chambre des notaires'', on whose advice notaries are appointed and who conduct annual accounting audits of notarial offices, establish and regulate professional and ethical standards, and can censure or temporarily suspend notaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rioufol|Rico|2004|pp=82–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notaries are also members of a regional notaries council (''conseil des notaires'') which acts very much like a common-law college of notaries by providing continuing education and other support services to notaries; they also take disciplinary action against notary misconduct including dismissal, removal from office, and revoking a notary's license to practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rioufol|Rico|2004|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regional councils are governed and headed by the National Council of Notaries (''Conseil supérieur du notariat'') which conducts surprise inspections, provides research, outlook, and public relations services, and acts as the profession's administrative head.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rioufol|Rico|2004|pp=84–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
[[file:WangenAllgaeu-Notariat1-Bubo.JPG|thumb|Notar office]]
[[file:Max Volkhart Beim Notar.jpg|thumb|Notar by [[Max Volkhart]]]]
In Germany, the main function of a ''Notar'' (pl. ''Notare'', fem. ''Notarin'') is to draw, execute, and retain [[legal instrument]]s transacting or governing noncontentious matters in reserved areas of law:
* [[real estate|real property]] ([[conveyancing]], [[servitude in civil law|servitudes]], [[security interest|real securities]])
* successions (wills and ''pacta successoria'', [[estate planning]], [[executor]]ships)
* family law (marital agreements, healthcare proxies, alimony &amp; child support agreements)
* company law (formation, restructuring, registration, corporate minutes)

Prospective notaries must be graduates of notary legal studies and pass the first level exam (''erste juristische Staatsprüfung''), article as a [[clerk|judicial clerk]] for 2 years, and pass the second notary practice exam (''zweite juristische Staatsprüfung''). In addition, dual-practice notaries (''Anwaltsnotar'') must have 3 years standing as a practicing attorney/solicitor and pass a competitive notarial practice exam (''notarielle Fachprüfung'') before being admitted as notaries. Single-practice notaries (''Nur-Notar''), on the other hand, must article for 3 years as a trainee notary (''Notarassessor''). German notaries are appointed by authority of their state justice minister, draft [[Act (document)#Notarial Acts|notarial instruments]] (''notarielle Urkunde'') and retain them of record in their protocol (''Urkundenrolle''), and provide independent and impartial advice to all interested parties (''Beteiligten'').

The mode of practice depends on the state, but in all, 1,600 German notaries practice exclusively as a notary versus 6,900 practicing dually as an attorney-notary. In most parts of Germany, notaries maintain independent private practices and do not generally work for the State except in [[Baden-Württemberg]] where 500 government notaries (''Beamten-Notar'') are regularly staffed in government agencies and offices. A notary's instruments are valid statewide, but in some states a notary's jurisdiction (''Amtsbereich'') is restricted to the judicial district (''Amtsgerichtsbezirk'') of the notary's appointment, as in Saxony and Württemberg where notaries are district notaries (''Bezirksnotar''). In Baden, notaries are magisterial notaries (''Richternotar'') who double as stipendiary [[magistrate]]s. Single-practice notaries practice as a notary sole (''Einzelnotar'') or in a 2-person partnership (''Zweier-Sozietät''), whereas attorney-notaries structure themselves into law firms of varying size. The government notaries in [[Baden-Württemberg]] are going to be converted to self-employed private practitioners effective 1 January 2018.

German notaries prepare instruments according to federal statutory guidelines and advise appearers on their legal obligations and consequences. A notary's statutory duties are:
* to satisfy himself of the identity of the appearers (''Erschienenen'' or ''Urkundsparteien'');
* to verify the parties to contracts are competent to enter into them;
* ''Belehrungspflicht'':  to rigorously explain to appearers the contents and legal implications of the instrument; and
* to have the appearers sign before and with the notary and sometimes in the presence of witnesses.
The notary affixes his official seal (''Dienstsiegel'') to the instrument and binds it with thin cords (''Verbindung'', ''Heftung''). If the instrument is ''prima facie'' duly executed, courts will enforce it, presume it valid and regular, and admit it as evidence to prove the truth of its contents.

In Germany, notaries are very important in day-to-day business. For example, any real estate sales contract (§ 311(b), [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|German Civil Code]]), [[articles of association]], alimony or child support agreement, or contract concerning succession (''pactum successorium'') must be in notarial form. Likewise, any share purchase or asset transfer agreement of a [[Private company limited by shares|private limited company]] (''[[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung|GmbH]]'') must be notarially executed pursuant to s. 15(3) of the ''Private Limited Companies Act (GmbHG)''. Contracts requiring notarial execution can be drafted by the executing notary, the parties, or by an attorney/solicitor.

==Spain and Latin America==
In [[Spain]], a ''notario'' is both a [[civil servant]] and a private and highly specialised lawyer. Thus, although they hold a private practice, depending on the role they professionally exercise they may be acting as public officers (for instance, when working with governmental agencies and departments, or when certifying notarial instruments in a court of law) or as private practitioners (for instance, when paying their own staff's taxes and salaries, or assuming the running costs of their own notarial practice). Spanish notaries are charged with writing and authorising notarial instruments that gather either perceptible facts from which some legal right might be derived (for instance, holding witness, or validating a document), or juridical business of any sort both in private and commercial law that in one way or another require collecting the will of all parties involved, as would be for instance mortgage contracts or powers of attorney (''poder notarial''). 

Notaries are regulated by the ''Ley de 28 de mayo de 1862 del Notariado de España'' (''Law of May 1862 of Notaries of Spain''). Access to the profession is restricted to Spanish and EU citizens over the age of 23, and who hold an undergraduate and a postgraduate degree in Law (or, rarely, a PhD in Law). In order to become a notary, the candidate has to sit a highly competitive public examination consisting of 4 parts covering all legal and practical aspects of Spanish private law. This ''oposición pública'' is usually called once a year to cover arising vacancies in the notarial jurisdictions. Because very few openings take place, the success rate for this exam are extremely low (under 1% gain a position), and preparing for the examination typically takes potential candidates 2 to 5 years.

Spanish notaries exercise their notarial instruments (known in general as ''fe pública notarial'') in a dual manner: 
# When discussing matters of fact, what a Spanish notary sees, hears, or perceives is held to have full evidentiary value and executory force, and is therefore proof of the matter of fact. 
# When discussing matters of the Law, notarial instruments hold the authenticity and probatory force of the wills declared by the parties appearing in it.
As private practitioners, Spanish notaries are also obliged by Law to offer legal counsel to all those that may require or demand it, and advise them on the most appropriate legal means they may need to reach their goals, so long as the latter are licit. 

Unlike in common law jurisdictions, Spanish notaries are actively involved in drafting the notarial instruments and contracts, usually (if so needed) as advised by the signing parties. In that manner, they act as private practitioners. However, inasmuch as public officers, notaries are obliged to ensure that the notarial instruments and contracts are law abiding, and upon notarising the instrument (''calificación notarial''), the instrument has the full power of the law. Because of this, the validity and truthfulness of notarial instruments are a priori held to be true, and therefore had probatory value in the Courts, were disputes to arise. 

The three main notarial instruments a Spanish notary holds are:
# ''Escrituras públicas'' (Public writs), which refer to all contracts and declarations that involve the assent of two or more parties. This include house deeds, 
# ''Actas notariales'' (Notarial acts). These are notarial statements, whereby the notary bears witness to something he or she has physically been part of. They may be employed by lawyers requiring an independent third party (the notary) to witness something (the presence of some individual somewhere, or the drawing of a specific prize by lot, the validity of a translation...).
# ''Pólizas intervenidas'' (Intervened policies). These are typically commercial contracts such as mortgage and insurance policies, where one of the parties grants some right (say, a loan) to another.
Finally, Spanish notaries offer testimonies and certifications, for instance when certifying that the copy of a document is a faithful copy to the original. Notaries sign (''firman'') and stamp (''sellan'') ''giving faith'' (''dar fe'') on each page of the notarial instrument, which are bound together with their archival number and page, and held in a ''practice''. The notarial instrument is always written in certified paper (''papel timbrado''), paper issued and numbered by the Royal Mint, and bound alongside all other notarial instruments yearly to be archived by the notarial practice. The original document is known as the ''matriz'', and must be physically held by the notary. 

Notarial practices are limited by law to a specific territorial range, where the notary typically has his or her ''notaría''. Each ''notaría'' is held by a single notario, and tends to employ a number of clerks (''pasantes'') and administrators. These ''notarías'' are private practises, and self-funded with the fees that the notary is allowed to charge. Notarial fees are regulated by law. Each notarial instrument has a moderate cost on its own, added to which the notary charges per page drafted, per copy emitted, etc, a legally set amount. The notary is also obliged to collect whichever taxes may be involved in the transactions they notarise (for instance, the [[stamp duty]] or [[VAT]] costs). 

Although regulated in a different manner in each country, notaries in the Spanish Americas operate in a very similar manner to Spanish notaries.

==Other countries==
As a general rule, countries who formerly were colonies or viceroyalties of Spain, France or Portugal, have retained a civil law tradition and, accordingly, a civil-law notarial profession. This is the case with most Latin American and French-speaking African countries, but not so of Asian countries.

===The International Union of Notaries===
Most of the countries which have civil-law notaries are members of the International Union of Notaries (UINL). Members include:
; Europe (35)
: Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the United Kingdom (only the City of London), Luxembourg, Malta, Moldova, Monaco, The Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, San Marino, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Macedonia, The Vatican, Turkey and Ukraine.
; Americas (23)
: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico (United States), Quebec (Canada), Uruguay, and Venezuela.
; Africa (15)
: Algeria, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Gabon, Guinea, Côte d'Ivoire, Mali, Morocco, Niger, Senegal and Togo.
; Asia (3)
: Bangladesh, China (People's Republic), Indonesia, Japan.

The members of the union are represented by their respective national councils or by similar national organisations and by notarial districts and regional or provincial societies of notaries.

The UINL has preferential relations with professional legal officers who fulfil notarial duties in various countries (or federated states within a [[federation]]) or with the bodies that represent them.

The countries that have asked to join the union are: Georgia, Mauritius, Kazakhstan, Mauritania, Belarus, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cambodia, Iran, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Madagascar, New Zealand, the Philippines, Serbia, the Seychelles, South Korea, Tunisia and Vietnam.

The federated states that have asked to join the union are: Alabama, British Columbia, Florida, Illinois, Indiana and Texas.

==History==

===Origins===
[[Scribe]]s have existed since recorded history, but the notary's authentication tools were first invented in the [[Fertile Crescent]] where in [[Babylon]] the use of signatures and distinct signs in clay tablets was required.  [[Ancient egypt|Egypt]] innovated the use of [[papyrus]] and the calame, added legalistic formalism to document preparation, and had specialized notary-scribes, called ''sesh n pero''' "pharaoh's scribe" or ''sesh n po'' "scribe of the nome"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Janet H. Johnson]] |title=Ptolemaic Bureaucracy from an Egyptian Point of View |page=142 |format=pdf |url=http://humanities.uchicago.edu/depts/nelc/facultypages/johnson/Ptolemaic_Bureaucracy_from_an_Egyptian_Point_of_View.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719180039/http://humanities.uchicago.edu/depts/nelc/facultypages/johnson/Ptolemaic_Bureaucracy_from_an_Egyptian_Point_of_View.pdf |archivedate=2008-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;—''agoranomos'' in Ptolemaic times—who gave authenticity to instruments without the need for witnesses.  In Ancient Israel there existed a similar institution of the notary-scribe known as the ''sofér''. [[Ancient greece|Greek]] city-states lacked uniformity, but, universally, public [[Legal instrument|instruments]], usually [[deed]]s and [[conveyancing|conveyances]], were kept in official registers and drafted by scribal ''mnemone'' (or ''basiliki ipographi'' "king's scribes") who were tied to a certain district and whose written [[Act (document)|acts]] trumped oral testimony.&lt;ref&gt;Alain Moreau (1999). ''Le Notaire dans la société française : d'hier à demain'', 2nd edn. (Paris: Economica), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;  These innovations would be combined and adopted under the [[Roman empire]].

===Roman Empire===
In Rome, scribes (''[[scriba (ancient Rome)|scribae]]'') acted as court recorders and copyists of instruments, whereas the ''notarius'' took [[Dictation (exercise)|dictation]] and raw minutes or memoranda (''notae'') of proceedings in shorthand. Different kinds of ''notarius'' existed:  some recorded proceedings, others transcribed state papers, some supplied magistrates with legal forms, and others registered judgements and decrees.  A number were involved with the noncontentious jurisdiction of the courts by drawing up deeds, wills, and conveyances which could then be sealed before the presiding magistrate and affixed with the official seal of the court, thereby rendering them public and probative acts.  Otherwise, most instruments were in private form. One type of ''notarius'' was the ''exceptor'' who emerged as the official clerk attached to all bureaus and courts and required at all municipal meetings of ''curiae''.&lt;ref name=Byrne780&gt;Joseph P. Byrne (2003). "Notaries", in ''Medieval Italy: An Encyclopedia'', Vol. 2: L–Z, Christopher Kleinhenz, ed. (London: Routledge), p. 780.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, drawing up private documents was more the preserve of the ''tabellio'', a professional scrivener who held no public office.  The ''tabellio'' used clerks to take shorthand notes and wrote them out in minute form.  This was then engrossed into an extended act, duly attested by witnesses and endorsed with a ''completio'', or [[eschatocol]] (docquet). Early on and like the ''notarius'', a ''tabellio'''s instrument lacked probativity.  Only by attaching copies of the judicial proceedings wherein one party petitions the second party to either contest or accept the act in open court could the instrument be made probative, i.e., imbued with ''fides publica'', "public faith and credit".  In later years, it became possible to register and deposit the acts of a ''tabellio'' in public archives to make them probative. Both ''exceptores'' and ''tabelliones'' were organized into civil guilds (''collegia, scholae'') to ensure the official recording of both public and private acts. Though ''tabelliones'' were of lower social status, the position had high mobility, and official posts often drew young nobles.&lt;ref name=Byrne780/&gt;

By the Late Roman period, ''notarius'' came to denote registrars attached to the courts of provincial governors, secretaries of emperors, and the highest class of officials in the privy council and the imperial chancery.  In the Church, they were administrative secretaries for bishops and monasteries and were important as correspondents in the doctrinal battles of the 3rd and 4th centuries. Constantine himself created scholae of notaries for bishops and their courts. ''Tabelliones'' were nicknamed "runners" ''(cursores)'' because of their quick drafting speed and their "cursive" minute hand.  They were subsequently known as ''forenses'' and ''publici''—from their presence in public places—before being subsumed under the functions of the ''tabulairus'', or notary-clerk.  Lawyers—or ''juris prudense'' or ''juris consulte''—also often acted as notaries.

===Early Middle Ages===
With the degeneration of public administration and its assumption by the Church in the West, as well as the replacement of Roman legal writing culture with a Germanic oral legal system based on witness testimony and open court proceedings, secular notaries became obsolete. In a select group of urban areas, such as in northern Italy and southern France, Roman law tended to be preserved, at least for civil matters, and there the secular notary lived on mostly as a draftsman. Ecclesiastical notaries (''notarius ecclesiaie'') in the main perfected a number of common notarial devices, namely the use of ribbons, seals, manual signs (''signum''), and the form of the eschatocol during this time. They also came to be called ''scrinarius''. [[Pope Gregory I|Pope Gregory the Great]] (r. 590–604) organized papal ''notarii'' or ''scrinarii'' into a ''schola''; Gregory's registers show that they were responsible for recording correspondence, ordinations, privileges, donations, synodal acts, and matters related to the [[Patrimonium Sancti Petri|Patrimony of Saint Peter]], as well as serving as papal advisors, diplomats, and envoys. Similarly, the papal chancery, archive, and library were organized around their efforts.&lt;ref name=Byrne780/&gt;

In northern Italy during the Ostrogothic and [[Lombards|Lombard]] periods, the offices of ''exceptor'' and ''tabellio'' were carried out by scriptores and notaries. The ''notarius civitatis'' ("of the city") served Lombard kings and nobles in their courts; ''notarii ecclesiae'' continued to aid bishops, abbots, and some of the public. These two kinds of notaries attended the same episcopal schools, and the existence of ecclesiastical notaries led to the demand for secular ones. Unorganized and unregulated "lay notaries" (''publici notarii'') handled private matters, since the Lombards did not practice ''insinuation''. From the late 7th century on, important associations of notaries (and probably notarial education) existed in Pavia, Cremona, Milan, Lucca, Rome, and Ravenna.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph P. Byrne (2003). "Notaries", in ''Medieval Italy:  An Encyclopedia'', Vol. 2: L–Z, Christopher Kleinhenz, ed. (London: Routledge), p. 781.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] France, ecclesiastical notaries, continuing Late Imperial practice, were attached to county courts as clerks of court who recorded proceedings and prepared and engrossed instruments and process which were later sealed before the count with the court's official seal to render them public and authentic. Otherwise, it was not until the 9th century, when [[Charlemagne]], in an effort to reform the county court system, began to appoint notaries to accompany itinerant royal commissioners during their assize circuit, which notaries were called royal notaries. By the 10th century, they had become permanent clerks of court and came to greatly outnumber and then absorb the comital notaries into their corps. This system was preserved by the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

Charlemagne also raised ecclesiastical notaries to the status of deacon or priest. As a result, the Office of notary became a stepping-stone to higher church office. They continued to serve the public as well before being made obsolete by the full emergence of a lay notarial profession in the 12th century. Charlemagne ordered that every bishop, abbot, and count employ a notary, appointed by himself if necessary. He therefore accepted and altered Lombard practice, formalized it, and spread it to the rest of the empire. His own notarial secretaries were the ''cancellarii''. One notary in particular, [[Paul the Deacon]], played a pivotal role in the Carolingian Renaissance. Paul was trained at Pavia, was chancellor to the Lombard king Desierius, taught at the Frankish palace school (782–787), and may have been responsible for reforming the notarial system. The famous ''[[missi dominici]]'' oversaw the work of comital (counts') and episcopal notaries, who, under [[Louis the Pious]], were drawn specifically from the noble class. Under [[Lothair I]], imperial law regulated notarial practice of both episcopal and comital ''cancellarii'' and private notaries and limited a notary's geographic jurisdiction.

===Byzantine Europe===
In the East, however, the tabularius, called ''symbolaiographos'' and the juris, the ''nomikos'', continued to thrive.  To stem fraud, [[Justinian I|Justinian]] reforms [[Justinian code|codified]] (cf. 44th and 77th novellae) new precautionary measures for giving a document probativity such as:
* the actual presence of the attesting tabellio and the recording of other witnesses' names,
* the obligatory presence and signatures of witnesses to an act's signing
* dating by regnal and consular year and indiction
* inclusion of an eschatocol in which the tabellio claimed responsibility for the document
* recitation before a judge before recordation, a process known as ''insinuatio''.
Some measures proved untenable and, with the short supply of administrators and half loss of the Empire (early 7th century), notaries became a primarily urban phenomenon with somewhat relaxed standards of practice. Still, they remained the highest-ranking lawyer and instrumental to the legal and court process as Germanic-type oral proceedings were unknown and Roman legalistic traditions survived intact. From the mid-6th century, a large body of centuries-old legal texts was given force of law and became widely circulated. Similarly, the importance of law court officials declined as did lawsuits in regular civil courts and this, in turn, allowed private settlements mediated by notaries at lower cost to flourish.&lt;ref&gt;Traianos Gagos and Peter van Minnen, ''[https://www.amazon.com/Settling-Dispute-Anthropology-Antique-Cultures/dp/0472065904 Settling a Dispute: Toward a Legal Anthropology of Late Antique Egypt]'' (University of Michigan Press, 1997), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In time, all notarial functions (clerical and law officer) were concentrated into the law-trained ''nomikos'', though the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Church]] would provide notarial services in town and rural settings.  The Church also retained the old separation between ''symbolaiographos'', or notary-draftsman, ''notarios'', or notary-scribe, and the clerical ''nomikos'', or notary lawyer. By the 10th century, secular nomikoi had been organized into a regulatory guild, were attached to the State, appointed by the [[Byzantine emperor|Emperor]], and ranked among the highest of legal officers. The introductory portions of their acts also tended to invoke God, and crosses and Christian insignia were often applied to the face of an act.  Notarial practice would be slightly westernized under Venetian occupation, but remained substantially unchanged until the end of the [[Byzantine Empire|Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Helen Saradi-Mendelovici (2009). “A History of the Greek Notarial System”, in ''Handbuch zur Geschichte des Notariats der europäischen Traditionen'', eds. Μathias Schmoeckel &amp; Werner Schubert (Baden-Baden: Nomos), pp. 523–557.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late Middle Ages===
[[File:1429 Juli 7 Signet Hans Braun von Bamberg-Bozen HGS.jpg|thumb|The sign of the late medieval public notary Hans Braun from [[Bamberg]], operating in [[Bolzano]] in 1429&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Hannes Obermair| title=Bozen Süd – Bolzano Nord.

Imperial [[Ravenna]] retained separate scholae of imperial notaries, ecclesiastical notaries, and tabelliones. However, with the fall of the Exarchate, imperial notaries disappeared with unauthorized tabelliones absorbing most of their legal jurisdiction and function.  During the 11th century and the early 12th century, attempts to bring the tabellionate under imperial purview were resisted and failed at Ravenna, though by the 13th century many professionals styled themselves ''notarius et tabellio'', combining both functions in their practice. By the 13th century, even the Ravennati adopted the title "notary by imperial authority," and the retrograde tabellionate slowly dissolved. The ecclesiastical notariate in Ravenna retained its position until the 12th century, but did not interfere in the sphere of the secular notariate. During the 12th century, the lay tabellionate absorbed most of the functions of the church notary, even running Ravenna's episcopal chancery by 1127. Elsewhere in Italy, where it had survived, the independent ecclesiastical notariate likewise slowly disappeared:  in Lucca, the comital notariate replaced it during the Carolingian period; and in Bologna, home of the revived imperial legal tradition, the bishop's last clerical notary died in 1133. Even in Rome, lay notaries gained in importance, and in 1211 Pope Innocent III declared that no notary in a church court could hold major orders.

In southern Italy, when Sicily fell to the Arabs it lost the notarial tradition, while other areas, such as [[Apulia]], [[Calabria]], and [[Lucania]], held on to Greco-Byzantine practices. Areas retaining the Latin-Lombard traditions used the ''notarius'', but he may have been attached to and authorized through a palace, church, monastery, or even city; or sometimes he was itinerant and without official authority. During the 10th century, [[Naples]] maintained a clear organization of notaries (''curiali'') in a ''collegio'' under a ''primarius'' aided by a ''tabularius''. Documents were often drawn up by ''discipuli'' ("apprentices"), but only the notary could apply the eschatocol. [[Amalfi]] followed a looser organization: ''scribae civitatis'' ("scriveners") were called ''curiali'' by c. 1000, many may have worked only part-time, and there was no clear caste of ''discipuli''. [[Gaeta]] retained the ''scriba civitatis'', though mixing Greek with Latin traditions and clerical with secular functions and statuses. In the 10th and 11th centuries, titles included ''presbyter'' ("priest") ''et notarius civitatis'' and ''Leo greco-latinus presbyter et scriba civitatis'', though by the early 12th century a simple ''notarius civitatis'' would do. The southern Italian tradition was for the most part replaced by the Carolingian tradition when the region was conquered by the Normans.

As northern Italy came to free itself in the late 11th century from imperial rule and episcopal authority, it established municipal authorities (known as ''consulates'') who, with the increase in literacy, came to rely heavily on the lay notary to produce, archive, and standardize public instruments under municipal seal.  In addition, the Venetian pillaging of Byzantine libraries revived bookish learning and led to the founding of law schools, such as at the [[University of Bologna]] which trained notaries-at-law. Similarly, as schools for notaries relied on Byzantine law and came to determine the development of the notarial corps, by the 10th century, the Carolingian and the Byzantine traditions were no longer distinguishable. The Italian notarial profession was transmitted from [[Lombardy]] to southern France through trade, first to [[Languedoc]], and eventually northward to [[Bruges]] (Flemish Belgium), and on to the eastern Mediterranean.

'''CLASS''' ('''CLS''') was a notorious and prolific [[warez group]] that existed between January 1, 1997 and January 9, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hitzler, R., Niederbacher, A. |title=Leben in Szenen: Formen Juveniler Vergemeinschaftung Heute |trans-title=Living in Scenes. Forms of Youth Communities |language=German |year=2010 |publisher=VS Verlag fur Sozialwissenschaften GmbH |isbn=9783531925325 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GNsdBAAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was the target of federal raids such as Operation Fastlink. They specialized in [[software cracking|cracked]] [[game]]s, and sometimes had elaborate [[art]] in the [[cracktro]] or release (i.e. [[music]], [[3D computer graphics|3D animation]], [[logo]] designs, etc.). They were a global group and had many members worldwide. Class used their group abbreviation, ''CLS'', as a suffix at the end of the files they released.

This group was involved in a long-standing rivalry with a competing game pirating group known as [[Myth (warez)|MYTH]]. The two groups released strictly ripped games, as opposed to the CD image content released by groups such as [[Fairlight (group)|Fairlight]]. Games would be split into the base rip, which would have as little content as possible to fully play the game; additional media (usually movies or digital music) would be released as add-ons. For some releases, intro movie add-ons were released as well.

They used advanced compression methods (most notably [[ACE (compression file format)|ACE]]) to reduce the size of the required downloads as much as possible; installers were specially crafted to use the abnormally compressed files. Many of their releases included a WAVE Injector/UHARC compression scheme, that decompressed and situated the files into a specific folder. These programs were at the core of their rip operation, as these programs (Wave Injector coded by CLASS/BACKLASH) are vital in decompressing the rips (i.e. games).

CLASS stopped producing as of January 9, 2004, by releasing an "endtro." This stated that after 1,234 releases they were giving up their "throne."&lt;ref name="retirement"/&gt;

In [[English law|English]] [[civil litigation]], '''costs''' are the [[lawyer]]s' fees and [[disbursements]] of the parties.

Each party is initially liable to pay his own solicitors on their agreed basis his "solicitor and own client costs", which will include disbursements such as barrister's fees; in case of dispute, the court has jurisdiction to assess and determine the proper amount. In legal aid cases, a similar assessment will determine the costs which the solicitors will be paid from the Legal Aid Fund.

In most courts and tribunals, generally after a final [[judgment (law)|judgment]] has been given, and possibly after any interim application, the [[judge]] has the power to order any party (and in exceptional cases even a third party, or any of the lawyers personally) to pay some or all of other parties' costs. The '''law of costs''' defines how such allocation is to take place.
Even when a successful party obtains an order for costs against an opponent, it is usual that he may nevertheless still have to pay his solicitors a balance between the costs recoverable from the opponent and the total chargeable by his solicitor; and if the loser is unable to pay, then the order for costs may be worthless, and the successful party will remain fully liable to his own solicitors.

==Costs "follow the event"==
The law of costs in [[England and Wales]] is typical of [[common law]] [[jurisdiction]]s, save that of the [[United States]].

In the small fraction of cases that do not settle and instead proceed to a judgment, generally costs "follow the event" so that the successful party is entitled to seek an order that the unsuccessful party pay his or her costs.  Should a case settle, then the parties can seek to agree costs, with the general rule that the losing party pays costs.&lt;ref&gt;CPR 36.10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costs orders===
The order that a judge gives as to costs determines who will be the paying and who the receiving party. The amount of costs remains to be determined by assessment if not agreed. Common costs orders, other than on the Small Claims Track, include the following.&lt;ref&gt;CPR 44 PD 4.2&lt;/ref&gt;

====Interim costs====
As a general rule, after judgment has been handed down, the court "will" order one party to make an advance payment towards the other side's costs.&lt;ref&gt;CPR 44.2(8)&lt;/ref&gt; This will be done even before the costs claim has been finalised.

The amount that will be ordered is based upon the parties' disclosed costs estimates, and will take into account the percentage of costs that have been ordered to be paid; any order for Indemnity Basis costs, if relevant, and any costs that are due to the paying party.

===Wasted costs===
These are defined as&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/54/section/51 ''s. 51(7) Senior Courts Act 1981'']&lt;/ref&gt; "costs incurred by a party—

:(a) as a result of any improper, unreasonable or negligent act or omission on the part of any legal or other representative or any employee of such a representative; or

:(b) which, in the light of any such act or omission occurring after they were incurred, the court considers it is unreasonable to expect that party to pay"

These costs will include the situation in which a party has incurred unnecessarily due to the other side's conduct. For example, if a court hearing is postponed due to one party not turning up at court. As a result, the other party had to pay a brief fee for a [[barrister]], for a hearing that ultimately did not take place.

===Security for costs===
{{main|Security for costs}}
Security for costs is a [[common law]] legal concept of application only in costs jurisdictions, and is an order sought from a court in litigation.

The general rule in costs jurisdiction is that "costs follow the event". In other words, the loser in legal proceedings must pay the legal costs of the successful party. Where a defendant has a reasonable apprehension that its legal costs will not be paid for by the claimant if the defendant is successful, the defendant can apply to the court for an order that the claimant provide security for costs. Furthermore, the amount that is ordered by the judge is in direct correlation to the strength or weakness of the claimant's case brought herewith.The weaker the probability of the claimant prevailing, the higher the security order.

Typically a claimant will be outside the jurisdiction of the court: the law of security for costs recognises that orders of the court relating to payment of a party's legal costs can be very difficult to enforce in non-common law jurisdictions, and so will order security to be provided. Security can also be ordered where a claimant is insolvent, or prone to vexatious litigation.

Security is usually provided in the form of a bank cheque paid into the court, or held in a trust account operated jointly by both the claimant's and defendant's lawyers.
If the defendant is successful, the money can be applied against the costs order. If the claimant is successful, the security is returned to the claimant.

===Comparison with other countries===

The law of costs is often known as the [[English rule (attorney's fees)|English rule]].

The situation contrasts with that in the U.S. where legal fees may be sought only if the parties agree by [[contract]] before the litigation, or if some special act or [[statute]] allows the successful party to seek such fees, the [[American rule (attorney's fees)|American rule]]. Federal district court and Court of Appeals judges award costs to the prevailing party under [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]].&lt;ref&gt;FRCP 54(d)&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, state court judges have no common law right to award such fees against the losing party.  It has been suggested that the American rule contributes to making the U.S. a litigious society.  Individuals have little to lose beyond filing fees and a retainer to start a lawsuit, and they are not at risk of having to pay their opponent's fees if they lose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Olson|first=Walter|title=Civil Suits|url=http://reason.com/archives/1995/06/01/civil-suits|work=Reason|publisher=Reason|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, the English rule has been criticised. Critics point out that it potentially hinders access to justice by increasing the risks of litigation—both by setting up the risk of having to pay both parties' full costs in the event of losing, and by creating incentives for parties to sink increasing resources into their cases to win the action and avoid paying fees, thereby increasing the overall cost-risk of litigation. This strategy cannot succeed under the American rule. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

The German costs rule, which allows for fixed recoverable costs, avoids this unfortunate consequence of full-fees recovery.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===What can be claimed?===
Recoverable costs are limited to:
*Fees and charges of the [[solicitor]] (attorney), which may be hourly, daily or an agreed sum;
*Disbursements, including [[barrister]]s'/counsels' fees;
*Witness allowances ([[conduct money]]), including fees paid to [[expert witness]]es;
*Some professional fees for non-witnesses; 
*[[Value added tax|VAT]] (where chargeable);
*Lawyers' "success fees" allowable by the court under a valid [[Contingent fee|conditional fee agreement]] (CFA); and
*After-the-event insurance premium.

===The indemnity principle===
The indemnity principle, a term unrelated to the concept of indemnity costs, stipulates that a paying party cannot be ordered to pay more than the receiving party has already agreed to pay his solicitor, the '''[[retainer agreement|retainer]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Gundry v Sainsbury'' [1910] 1 KB 645&lt;/ref&gt;

====Exceptions====

The principle causes anomalies for ''[[pro bono]]'' representation where, because the lawyers have agreed to represent the party for no cost, they cannot subsequently ask the court for a costs award when they win. However, since 2008  ''s. 194 [[Legal Services Act 2007]]'' allows the court to order a party who loses against ''pro bono'' representation to make an appropriate [[Charity (practice)|charitable donation]] ''in lieu'' of costs.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2008/1436/contents/made art. 2 &amp; 3 Legal Services Act 2007 (Commencement No. 2 and Transitory Provisions) Order 2008]''&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also specific exceptions to the principle for:
*[[Costs (English law)#In-house lawyers|In-house lawyers]];&lt;ref&gt;''Re Eastwood'' [1974] 3 All ER 603&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Costs (English law)#Conditional Fee Agreements .28CFAs.29|Conditional fee agreements]];
*[[Legal aid#England and Wales|Legal aid]]; and
*[[Costs (English law)#Litigants in person|Litigants in person]].

===Exceptions===
The rule that "costs follow the event" is observed on the [[Civil Procedure Rules 1998#Tracks|Multi- and Fast Track]]s.

However, the judge has considerable [[discretion]] to apply or disapply these rules if the result would otherwise be [[justice|unjust]]. The paying party can [[appeal]] against the costs order by the usual routes of appeal.

====Small claims track====
If a case is allocated to the [[Small claims track|Small Claims Track]],&lt;ref&gt;Generally, personal injury or housing disrepair cases for under £1,000, and other cases worth under £10,000 (CPR 26.6)&lt;/ref&gt; only specific limited costs such as fixed court fees are usually awarded.

====Fast-track trials====
On the Fast Track, the actual costs of the [[trial]], as opposed to preparatory work, are fixed.&lt;ref&gt;CPR 45, Section VI&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fixed costs and fees====
There are also fixed costs for [[Traffic collision|road traffic accident]] (RTA) claims that settle before they are issued;&lt;ref&gt;CPR 45, Section II-III&lt;/ref&gt; and in certain cases brought by [[HM Revenue and Customs|HM Revenue &amp; Customs]].&lt;ref&gt;CPR 45, Section V&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, where both the current ''CPR 48'' and old ''CPR 45'' apply, there are fixed success fees in personal injury claims arising from RTAs; injuries at work; and industrial disease claims.  These range from 12.5% in RTAs to 100%, in each type of case, if a trial occurs.

====Costs limits====
In certain Fast-Track or Multi-Track cases, a successful party's costs claim will be limited.

These include cases that are conducted in the [[Patents County Court]]&lt;ref&gt;CPR 45, Section IV&lt;/ref&gt; or in claims under the [[Aarhus Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;CPR 45, Section VII&lt;/ref&gt;

====Formal offers to settle====

The court will take account of the conduct of the parties and may vary the usual costs order in the event of misguided or dishonest behaviour. In particular, the claimant is expected to give the defendant an opportunity to settle, and the parties are expected to exchange essential information and details before starting a claim. The court will especially be aware of any formal offers to settle made under Part 36 of the [[Civil Procedure Rules]]. Such offers are withheld from the judge during the trial but, during assessment of costs, the judge will compare them with the final [[damages]] awarded.

=====Acceptance of offers=====

If a Part 36 offer is accepted, or if the claimant discontinues, the unsuccessful party is usually liable for both parties' costs to that date.

=====Rejection of offers=====

If offers are rejected, and the case goes to trial, then one of the following situations can apply.

:If the defendant rejected the '''claimant's''' Part 36 offer to settle, then:
:* If the claimant is awarded a sum that is "at least as advantageous" as that offer,&lt;ref&gt;CPR 36.14(1)(a)&lt;/ref&gt; then the '''claimant''' is entitled to each of the following:&lt;ref&gt;CPR 36.14(3)&lt;/ref&gt;
:::'''Indemnity Basis''' costs (defined in a separate section further below) from the date the offer expires;
:::'''Punitive''' [[interest]], up to 10% above [[central bank|base rate]], on the whole or part of any sum awarded, for some or all of the time at issue; and
:::An "additional amount" of up to £75,000 (only if the Part 36 offer dates from 1 April 2013).
:* If there is a judgment for the claimant that is less than the offer, then the general rules apply: the '''claimant ''' is entitled to standard-basis costs plus interest.
:* If there is a judgment for the defendant that is less than the offer, then the general rules apply: the '''defendant''' is entitled to standard-basis costs plus interest.

:If the Claimant rejected the '''defendant's''' offer to settle, then:
:* If the Claimant failed 'to obtain a judgment that is more advantageous'&lt;ref&gt;CPR 36.14(1)(b)&lt;/ref&gt; than that offer at trial, then the '''defendant''' is entitled to, from the date that the offer expired:&lt;ref&gt;CPR 36.14(2)&lt;/ref&gt;
:::'''Standard Basis''' costs;
:::Interest on the costs.
:* If there is a judgment for the claimant that exceeds the offer, then the general rules apply:  the '''claimant ''' is entitled to Standard Basis costs plus interest.

The unsuccessful party is generally also liable for both parties' costs up to the date that the Part 36 offer expires, on the Standard Basis, plus interest.

=====Discontinued claims=====

If the claimant discontinues, they are usually liable for both parties' costs to the date of discontinuance, on the Standard Basis.&lt;ref&gt;CPR 38.6&lt;/ref&gt;

====Qualified one-way costs-shifting====

In personal injury or fatal accident cases since 1 April 2013, there is a further exception to the costs-shifting rules known as "Qualified One-Way Costs-Shifting".&lt;ref&gt;CPR 44, Section II&lt;/ref&gt;

If this applies then orders for costs against the claimant can normally only be enforced by a defendant if they total doesn't exceed the amount of damages and costs which a Defendant has to pay out.&lt;ref&gt;CPR 44.14&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it can be enforced in full without the court's permission if the claim was struck-out because: 
:(a) the claimant has disclosed no reasonable grounds for bringing the proceedings;
:(b) the proceedings are an abuse of the court’s process; or
:(c) the conduct of –
::(i) the claimant; or
::(ii) a person acting on the claimant’s behalf and with the claimant’s knowledge of such conduct,
:is likely to obstruct the just disposal of the proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;CPR 44.15&lt;/ref&gt;

The court's permission to enforce in full is required if the claim was found at trial to be "fundamentally dishonest".&lt;ref&gt;CPR 44.16&lt;/ref&gt;  If the claim was discontinued, the court can order a hearing to determine whether it was "fundamentally dishonest" to bring it.&lt;ref&gt;CPR 44 PD 12.4&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other situations====

Other exceptions to the general rules include:
*Applications to extend time limits, usually paid by the applicant;
*Amendments to [[statement of case|statements of case]], usually paid by the amending party, including the costs of the other side's resulting amendments; and
*Failure to respond to a notice to admit where the receiving party will usually pay the costs of proving the facts alleged.

===Who can claim costs?===
As a general rule, the losing party pays the costs of the winning party, but the court can order otherwise.

====In-house lawyers====

The rule also covers in-house [[Corporation|corporate]] legal teams that conduct litigation and have [[rights of audience]].  They can claim the remuneration and expenses of the lawyers involved at the rates that external solicitors could claim, even though their fees would be paid as part of the company's overheads.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Eastwood'' [1974] 3 All ER 603&lt;/ref&gt;

====Litigants in person====
[[Litigant in person|Litigants in person]] will be awarded a fixed hourly rate of [[Pound sterling|£]]19 per hour, unless they can prove that they have incurred a financial loss in conducting the action.&lt;ref&gt;CPR 46, PD 3.4&lt;/ref&gt;

The costs awarded to a litigant in person cannot exceed two-thirds of what could be claimed by a professional lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;CPR 46.5(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment of costs==

===Reasonableness===
All claims for costs must be "reasonably incurred" or "reasonable in amount".&lt;ref&gt;CPR 44.4(1)&lt;/ref&gt; if costs are specified as being paid as part of a contract, they are presumed to be reasonable, unless the contract says otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;CPR 44.5&lt;/ref&gt; Reasonableness is assessed against "all the circumstances" and in particular the "seven pillars of wisdom":
*Conduct of the parties:
**Before as well as during proceedings;
**Efforts made to resolve the dispute;
*Value of the property at issue;
*Importance of the matter to the parties;
*Complexity, difficulty or novelty of the case;
*Skill, effort, specialised knowledge or responsibility required;
*Time spent on the case;
*Geographical location where the work was done.

===Basis of costs assessment===

There are two basic ways in which the court will assess a claim for costs: the Standard Basis and the Indemnity Basis. However, in each situation, the claim must be reasonable.

The manner in that they are assessed goes a long way in determining the overall percentage that will be allowed.

====Standard Basis====

Costs awarded on the '''Standard Basis''' must be "proportionate to the matters in issue".  Any doubt as to the costs is resolved in favour of the paying party.

====Indemnity Basis====

Costs awarded on the '''Indemnity Basis''' need not be "proportionate".  Any doubt as to the costs is resolved in favour of the receiving party.

As a whole, an award for costs on the Indemnity Basis is much more favourable to the receiving party than an award of the Standard Basis.

===Proportionality===
In considering whether or not a party's claim for costs is "proportionate", the court has to apply one of two different tests.

====The old test====
This applies where work is done before 1 April 2013, or to the whole of the costs in "cases commenced", i.e. if proceedings are issued, before 1 April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;CPR 44.3(7)&lt;/ref&gt;

In these situations, the court should have regard to the '''seven pillars of wisdom'''. The court should adopt a two-stage approach:&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2002/365.html Lownds v Home Office]'' [2002] 1 WLR 2450&lt;/ref&gt;
# Compare the total costs claimed against the total benefits gained by the successful party:
#If the total costs are proportionate to the total benefits:
:a) Perform an item by item test of '''reasonableness''';
&amp;mdash; if they are not proportionate:
:b) Perform an item by item test of necessity.

====The new test====
If the work was done since 1 April 2013, and relates to a case that either does not involve court proceedings, or was issued since 1 April 2013, then a different test applies.

In these situations, the court will hold that costs "are proportionate if they bear a reasonable relationship to –
:(a) the sums in issue in the proceedings;
:(b) the value of any non-monetary relief in issue in the proceedings;
:(c) the complexity of the litigation;
:(d) any additional work generated by the conduct of the paying party; and
:(e) any wider factors involved in the proceedings, such as reputation or public importance"&lt;ref&gt;CPR 44.3(5)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the "necessity" of the costs is not relevant.&lt;ref&gt;CPR 44.3(2)(a)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costs estimates===
In cases issued before 1 April 2013, parties have to give estimates of their likely costs should the case reach a trial.&lt;ref&gt;Costs Practice Direction, para. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  They are used to give each side and the Court an idea of what the likely costs burden would be.

These are submitted at the [[Civil procedure in England and Wales#Allocation of cases|allocation]] and listing stage, and at any time that the Court orders them.

A party that has costs awarded in their favour will not be limited to their estimate, but if the costs claimed exceed the estimate by 20% they will need to provide reasons.  If the paying party has shown that they relied on the estimated, the Court can use the estimate as evidence that the claim is disproportionate.

===Costs budgets===
If a case is issued since 1 April 2013, and is allocated to the Multi-track, the parties can be forced to submit a budget for their costs, which the court can then approve.&lt;ref&gt;CPR 3, Section II&lt;/ref&gt; They do not apply to proceedings in the Admiralty; Chancery Division; or Commercial Court;&lt;ref&gt;CPR 33.12(1)&lt;/ref&gt; or to cases in the Mercantile Court or Technology &amp; Construction Court where damages exceed £2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Sir John|title=Costs Management in the Chancery Division and the Specialist Lists in the Queen’s Bench Division: Amendment to CPR rule 3.12(1)|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/JCO%2fDocuments%2fPractice+Directions%2fcosts-budgeting-announcement-draft-direction-cpr-rule-3-12.pdf|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Impact and effect====

The rules relating to costs budgets are more stringent than those relating to estimates.

All parties must file a budget, unless they are a litigant in person.&lt;ref&gt;CPR 3.13&lt;/ref&gt;  If a party does not file a budget, it "will be treated" as only budgeting for the costs of any appropriate court fees.&lt;ref&gt;CPR 3.14&lt;/ref&gt; The costs of preparing a budget can be claimed, up to a maximum of £1,000 or 1% of the budget's total, whichever is greater.&lt;ref&gt;CPR 3 PD 3E, para. 2.2(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

Should a party exceed its budget, their costs will be limited to their last approved budget unless there is a "good reason".  It has been held that "good reasons" include the fact that the costs were otherwise "reasonable and proportionate";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Henry v News Group Newspapers Ltd.'' [2013] EWCA Civ 19|url=http://www.thomas-legal.com/henry-v-news-group-newspapers-ltd-2013-ewca-civ-19/|publisher=Thomas Legal Costs Ltd.|accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and where there was a simple "tick-box" error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Murray; Stokes v Neil Dowlman Architecture Ltd.'' [2013] EWHC 872 (TCC)|url=http://www.thomas-legal.com/murray-stokes-v-neil-dowlman-architecture-ltd-2013-ewhc-872-tcc/|publisher=Thomas Legal Costs Ltd.|accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costs exceeding the budget have been disallowed where a party has not applied to have its budget increased during the proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Elvanite Full Circle Ltd. v Amec Earth &amp; Environmental (UK) Ltd.'' [2013] EWHC 1643 (TCC)|url=http://www.thomas-legal.com/elvanite-full-circle-ltd-v-amec-earth-environmental-uk-ltd-2013-ewhc-1643-tcc/|publisher=Thomas Legal Costs Ltd.|accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the court has not been able to approve a party's budget, for example, due to the case settling before it was able to do so, then different rules apply.  However, these rules are similar to those relating to estimates: if a party's costs claim exceeds its budget by 20%, then the difference must be explained.&lt;ref&gt;CPR 44 PD 3.2&lt;/ref&gt;  The paying party must also show how they have relied on the estimate.&lt;ref&gt;CPR 44 PD 3.3&lt;/ref&gt;  If the court agrees with the paying party, it can limit the costs to the budget;&lt;ref&gt;CPR 44 PD 3.6&lt;/ref&gt; and if it disagrees with the receiving party it can use the difference as evidence the costs are "unreasonable or disproportionate".&lt;ref&gt;CPR 44 PD 3.7&lt;/ref&gt;

However, should a party ultimately be awarded costs on the Indemnity Basis, then the budget is not relevant in relation to those costs.&lt;ref&gt;CPR 3.18&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Inter partes'' costs===
Where a party is awarded costs against another they are known as '''''inter partes''''' '''costs''' or '''between party costs'''.

Such costs are usually assessed on the '''standard basis'''. The successful party may not be awarded the entirety of their legal costs, as the costs incurred will be assessed by an officer of the court. This can be done in one of two ways.

====Summary assessment====
The simplified procedure is known as '''summary assessment''' under which the court will consider a schedule of the costs incurred which will usually be no more than two pages long and is often only a single page. This is the usual method on the Fast Track, for hearings lasting no longer than a single day, for certain appeal hearings and for the costs of the paying party in '''detailed assessment''' hearings.

However, '''summary assessment''' is not permitted for claims:
*On behalf of children or mental patients; or
*Funded by the [[Legal Services Commission]];
&amp;mdash; or where:
*Paying party can raise substantial grounds; or
*Costs have been agreed by the parties.

====Detailed assessment====
{{more|Taxation of costs}}
For more complex cases a process, formerly called a '''[[taxation of costs]]''', now known as '''detailed assessment''', is used. It is unrelated to "[[tax]]" in the sense of a method of raising government revenue. The successful party must file with the court (unless the other party fails to respond to the notice of assessment) a detailed breakdown of the costs and disbursements incurred, known as a '''[[bill of costs]]''' which sets out the successful party's claim. The '''bill''' is usually prepared by a [[law costs draftsman]], whose skill is often as essential to the successful recovery of costs as the skill of a solicitor or barrister is essential to success on the principal issues of the litigation. An officer of the court, costs judge or [[Judiciary of England and Wales#District judges|district judge]] will then assess the '''reasonableness''' of the costs (unless the potential paying party failed to respond to the notice of assessment) with reference to a statutory schedule of limits of entitlements of costs, together with legal precedents, unless the costs can be agreed between the parties. The level of reduction can mean that the bill is reduced in some instances substantially, but in most cases at least 80% of the costs originally sought will be allowed. A court order for costs is enforceable as a debt against the unsuccessful party.&lt;ref&gt;CPR 70.1(2)(d)&lt;/ref&gt;

Either party can appeal against a '''detailed assessment''', to a costs judge or district judge of the [[High Court of England and Wales|High Court]] if the assessment was made by a court officer, or by the usual routes of appeal if the assessment was made by a judge.

=====Provisional assessment=====
If a bill of costs of under £75,000&lt;ref&gt;CPR 47, PD 14.1&lt;/ref&gt; is sent for a detailed assessment since 1 April 2013, it will at first be assessed via a new "provisional assessment" procedure&lt;ref&gt;CPR 47.15&lt;/ref&gt; (unless the potential paying party failed to respond to the notice of assessment).

This involves an assessment by the Judge on paper, without the parties being present, and the costs of it are limited to £1,500.&lt;ref&gt;CPR 47.15(5)&lt;/ref&gt;

If either party disagrees with the outcome they can apply for an oral hearing, but unless they beat the provisional figure by 20%, they will be liable for the costs of the hearing.&lt;ref&gt;CPR 47.15(10)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solicitor/own client costs===
The other type of costs, aside from '''''inter partes''''' '''costs''', is called '''solicitor-client costs''' and are usually assessed on the '''indemnity basis'''.  However, costs are presumed to be reasonably incurred and reasonable in amount if the client gave their express or implied approval, but are presumed to be unreasonably incurred if the client was not told they would be recovered from the other side and if they are unusual.&lt;ref&gt;CPR 46.9(3)&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless instructed under a [[Contingent fee|damages-based agreement]], lawyers in England and Wales are not permitted to work for a share of [[damages]] awarded as this would amount to [[champerty]]. A client who is unhappy with a lawyer's [[invoice]] for services can apply to the court for an order or invoke a statutory procedure whereby the costs are assessed for their reasonableness by an officer of the court, for example a judge.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/47/section/70 s. 70(3) Solicitors Act 1974]''&lt;/ref&gt; This is also a ''detailed assessment''. If the client does not pay the lawyer, the lawyer has a cause of action if the client does not elect to arbitrate the bill.&lt;ref&gt;''s. 70(2) Solicitors Act 1974''&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a statutory time limit on applying for such a procedure, of a year.&lt;ref&gt;''s. 70(1) Solicitors Act 1974''&lt;/ref&gt; The frequent result is that the lawyer's invoice is decreased. If the bill is reduced by one fifth or more the solicitor will pay for the process of assessment,&lt;ref&gt;''s. 70(9) Solicitors Act 1974''&lt;/ref&gt; but otherwise the client will pay. The client can alternatively apply to the [[Law Society of England and Wales|Law Society]] for a '''remuneration certificate''' in respect of costs arising from other than litigation.

==Specific types of funding==
Any case can be funded by a standard retainer agreement, i.e. where the solicitor agrees to act and the client pays as the case carries on.

There are also other ways in which a case can be funded, as long as certain requirements are met.

===Conditional fee agreements (CFAs)===
These are commonly referred to as "[[Contingent fee|no win, no fee]]" agreements.  Under this type of agreement, the solicitor and/or barrister agrees not to charge the client unless the case succeeds.

If the client does win their case, then the solicitor and/or barrister is entitled to claim a percentage bonus (a "success fee") on top of their usual fees.

To be valid, the CFA agreement must comply with certain requirements. All CFAs must:
* Be in writing
* Not relate to proceedings that cannot be the subject of an enforceable conditional fee agreement
* Comply with any requirements prescribed by the Lord Chancellor&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/41/section/58 ''s. 58 Courts and Legal Services Act 1990'']&lt;/ref&gt;

However, what can be claimed under it, and other additional requirements that may have to be met for the CFA to be valid, depend upon the date of the CFA.

====CFAs dated from 1 April 2000 to 31 October 2005====
If the CFA was entered into between these dates, the ''Conditional Fee Agreements Regulations 2000'' must also be complied with.

The main requirement is that before entering into the CFA the solicitor must advise the client, amongst other things, as to its effect; of alternative funding methods; and whether he has any interest in nay particular insurance policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2000/692/regulation/4/made ''reg. 4 Conditional Fee Agreements Regulations 2000'']&lt;/ref&gt;

If these regulations are not complied with, the CFA will not be valid.

If they are complied with, it will be valid and a success fee can be claimed from the other side, as long as they are informed of its existence.

====CFAs dated from 1 November 2005 to 31 March 2013====
Only the requirements of ''s. 58 Courts and Legal Services Act 1990'' need to be complied with.

If so, then it will be valid and a success fee can be claimed from the other side, as long as they are informed of its existence.

====CFAs dated from 1 April 2013====

If a CFA is entered into from this date then, unless the claim is for defamation; breach of privacy; diffuse mesothelioma, or is in a set of insolvency proceedings,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/689/article/6/made ''art. 6(2) Conditional Fee Agreements Order 2013'']&lt;/ref&gt; a success fee cannot be claimed from the other side.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/10/section/44/enacted ''s. 44 Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012'']&lt;/ref&gt;

It can still be claimed from the client, but in personal injury claims&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/689/article/5/made ''art. 5 Conditional Fee Agreements Order 2013'']&lt;/ref&gt; is subject to a 25% limit of the client's damages.

The solicitors' or barrister's normal fees can still be claimed from the other side.

===Collective conditional fee agreements (CCFAs)===
A CCFA is CFA that covers numerous people, for example, members of a trade union, in relation to different claims, which could occur at different times.

The rules relating to CFAs generally apply to CCFAs, but, in relation to success fees, the following rules apply to CCFAs:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/689/article/6/made ''art. 6(1)(b) Conditional Fee Agreements Order 2013'']&lt;/ref&gt;

:If the CCFA dates from 1st April 2013, then a success fee cannot be recovered from the other side;
:If the CCFA pre-dates 1st April 2013, then a success fee can only be recovered from the other side if work was done before 1st April 2013

===Insurance policies===
Most litigants will have the benefit of some form of [[legal expenses insurance|insurance]] will cover both their legal costs, and those of the other side.

However, both types will be subject to an upper limit on the amount of costs covered.

====Before-the-event (BTE) policies====
This kind of insurance policy before-the-event (BTE) against paying the other party's legal costs as part of their [[Homeowner's insurance|domestic]] or [[automobile insurance]] policies (although many are unaware of it).

The premium for this type of policy cannot be claimed from the other side.

====After-the-event (ATE) policies====
If a litigation does not have a BTE policy, they can purchase after-the-event (ATE) legal expenses insurance at the start of litigation.

If the policy was taken out before 1 April 2013, the premium can be claimed from the other side as part of a normal claim for costs.&lt;ref&gt;CPR 48.2(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, if it was taken out since 1 April 2013, it can only be recovered if it was taken out to cover the costs of an expert's report in a claim for clinical negligence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/10/section/46/enacted ''s. 46 Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Damages-based agreements (DBAs)===
These are a type of [[Contingent fee|contingency fee]], i.e. the solicitor and barrister agree to take a percentage of the client's damages if the claim succeeds.

They generally have to comply with the ''Damages-Based Agreements Regulations 2013'', and there is a maximum percentage that can be claimed varies depending on the type of claim and the level of court that the DBA relates to. The solicitors' disbursements can also be claimed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Underwood|first=Kerry|title=DBAs - can you charge disbursements?|url=http://kerryunderwood.wordpress.com/2013/07/24/dbas-can-you-charge-disbursements/|accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Employment claims====
If a DBA pre-dates 1 April 2013, then the ''Damages-Based Agreements Regulations 2010'' apply.  If not, then the 2013 Regulations apply.

However, there is no significant difference between the two sets, because in both situations, the solicitors and barristers' fees are limited to 35% of the client's damages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/1206/regulation/5/made ''reg. 5 Damages-Based Agreements Regulations 2010'']; [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/609/regulation/7/made ''reg. 7 Damages-Based Agreements Regulations 2013'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, before entering into the DBA, the client must be given information relating to funding, mediation, and when the fee becomes payable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/1206/regulation/3/made ''reg. 3 Damages-Based Agreements Regulations 2010'']; [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/609/regulation/5/made ''reg. 5 Damages-Based Agreements Regulations 2013'']&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-employment claims====
Different rules apply to non-employment cases funded by a DBA: specifically, the client does not have to be provided the information needed in employment cases, and the percentage fee varies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/609/regulation/4/made ''reg. 4 Damages-Based Agreements Regulations 2013'']&lt;/ref&gt;

=====First-instance cases=====
If the DBA is entered into in a personal injury claim, then up to 25% of the client's damages plus Counsel's fees can be claimed.

In other cases, up to 50% of the client's damages, including Counsel's fees can be claimed.

=====Appeals=====
If the DBA relates to an appeal, then up to 100% of the client's damages can be charged as the fee.

==Costs against other parties==

===Costs in third-party claims===
Sometimes a defendant brings a claim, for a [[contribution (law)|contribution]] or an [[indemnity]] towards damages, against a third party. For example, a diner claims against a restaurant for a dose of [[food poisoning]] and the restaurant claims against their supplier of [[shellfish]]. Again, "costs follow the event". If the restaurant successfully defends the claim, they pay the supplier's costs and recover the same amount from the unsuccessful claimant. This can cause injustice when the unsuccessful claimant is [[insolvency|insolvent]] and the successful defendant is still liable for third-party costs. The courts will only rarely allow a "cut through" of the third-party's costs to the claimant&lt;ref&gt;''Sanderson v Blyth Theatre Company'' [1903] 2 KB 533&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Johnson v Ribbins'' [1977] 1 WLR 1458&lt;/ref&gt; but the interests of justice prevail.&lt;ref&gt;CPR 44.3(2)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2005/655.html Arkin v Bouchard Lines]'' [2005] EWCA Civ 655, at [77]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costs against non-parties===
The courts have a wide discretion in awarding costs,&lt;ref&gt;''s. 51 Senior Courts Act 1981''&lt;/ref&gt; and non-parties are not immune,&lt;ref&gt;''Aiden Shipping Co. Ltd. v Interbulk Ltd.'' [1986] AC 965&lt;/ref&gt; unless they are a BTE insurer.&lt;ref&gt;''Murphy v Young's Brewery'' [1997] 1 WLR 1591&lt;/ref&gt;

This is particularly relevant in cases of [[champerty and maintenance]].&lt;ref&gt;''Arkin v Bouchard Lines'' [2005] EWCA Civ 655, at [23]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal proceedings==
If a defendant is found to be innocent of a crime, then they are also entitled to claim their incurred legal costs,&lt;ref&gt;''Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 s. 16''&lt;/ref&gt; but the costs are payable out of money raised through taxes.

A bill of costs is submitted in the normal way, but the costs are assessed by the National Taxing Team&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Taxing Team|url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/national-taxing-team|publisher=Ministry of Justice|accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a manner similar to a claim for costs in a civil case.

Costs assessed in this way do not require a formal detailed assessment, but any amount awarded can be appealed in the usual way.

===Proceedings commenced before October 2012===
If a prosecution started before October 2012, then the costs will be assessed with no general restrictions on what can be claimed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Claims for defence costs in proceedings commenced prior to 1st October 2012, costs of a private prosecutor, and costs of an Appointee out of Central Funds, in the Crown Court and magistrates' courts|url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/national-taxing-team/litigators#prior1oct|publisher=Ministry of Justice|accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proceedings commenced since October 2012===
If a prosecution has started since 1 October 2012, then the amount that can be claimed is much lower.  Effectively, the costs are limited to legal aid rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Claims for defence costs out of Central Funds in the Crown Court and magistrates' courts in proceedings commenced on or after 1st October 2012|url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/national-taxing-team/litigators#onorafter1oct|publisher=Ministry of Justice|accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In law, '''dissolution''' has multiple meanings.

Dissolution is the last stage of [[liquidation]], the process by which a [[company]] (or part of a company) is brought to an end, and the [[asset]]s and [[property]] of the company redistributed.

Dissolution of a [[General partnership|partnership]] is the first of two stages in the termination of a partnership.&lt;ref name="Kubasek"/&gt;  "Winding up" is the second stage.&lt;ref name="Kubasek"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kubasek|first1=Nancy|last2=Browne|first2=M. Neil|last3=Heron|first3=Daniel|last4=Dhooge|first4=Lucien|last5=Barkacs|first5=Linda|title=Dynamic Business Law: The Essentials|date=2016|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=9781259415654|edition=3d|url=http://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0073524972/information_center_view0/table_of_contents.html|page=443}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slides 11-17 of [http://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0073524972/student_view0/chapter21/powerpoint_presentations.html Powerpoint] for Chapter 21 from McGraw-Hill from 2nd Ed. of Kusabek&lt;/ref&gt;

Dissolution may also refer to the termination of a [[contract]] or other legal relationship; for example, a [[divorce]] is the dissolution of a [[marriage]].

Dissolution is also the term for the legal process by which an [[adoption]] is reversed. While this applies to the vast majority of adoptions which are terminated, they are more commonly referred to as [[disruption (adoption)|disruption]]s, even though that term technically applies only to those that are not legally complete at the time of termination.

In [[international law]], dissolution ([[Latin]]: ''dismembratio'') is when a state has broken up into several entities, and no longer has power over those entities, as it used to have previously. An example of this is the case of the former [[USSR]] [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolving]] into [[Post-Soviet republics|different republics]].

'''''Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc. v Gutnick''''' was an [[Internet]] [[defamation]] case heard in the [[High Court of Australia]], [[judgment|decided]] on 10 December 2002.  The 28 October 2000 edition of [[Barron's Magazine|Barron's Online]], published by [[Dow Jones and Company|Dow Jones]], contained an article entitled "Unholy Gains" in which several references were made to the respondent, [[Joseph Gutnick]].  Gutnick contended that part of the article defamed him. A key judgement was that the suit could be brought in Australia.

== Facts ==

The article in question was entitled ''Unholy Gains'', by William Alpert, published in Barron's 2000 Oct 30. Australian courts described the details of the article in their written opinion on the case, as follows:&lt;ref name="austlii200256"/&gt;&lt;ref name="barringer20021211"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cbsnews20021210"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;big&gt;"&lt;/big&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[The article] "states that some of his business dealings with religious charities raise "uncomfortable questions" . . . . The author then uses some language that the media have appropriated from the law courts, implying that a balanced trial with equal opportunity to participate by all concerned has taken place: that a "&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Barron's''&lt;nowiki&gt; investigation &lt;/nowiki&gt;''found''&lt;nowiki&gt; that several charities traded heavily in stocks promoted by Gutnick." . . .  (emphasis added) The article associates the respondent with Mr Nachum Goldberg who is apparently a convicted tax evader and another person awaiting trial for stock manipulation in New York.&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;big&gt;"&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;ref name="austlii200256"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In court it was proven that only five copies of the Barron's print edition were sent from [[New Jersey]] to be circulated in Australia, but that none had actually arrived in the Jurisdiction. Gutnick therefore resorted to the internet based publication in order to show an actionable tort in the jurisdiction. The Internet version of the magazine had 550,000 international subscribers and 1700 Australian-based credit cards.

[[Geoffrey Robertson]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] argued for the publisher Dow Jones as to whether it was considered to be "published from" where it was uploaded in New Jersey or "published into" where it was downloaded by subscribers in [[Victoria, Australia]]. The argument was on publication and jurisdiction.

==Decision==

In a unanimous decision, all seven [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] justices decided that Gutnick had the right to sue for defamation at his primary residence and the place he was best known. Victoria was considered the place where damage to his reputation occurred. The High Court decided that defamation did not occur at the time of publishing, but as soon as a third party read the publication and thought less of the individual who was defamed.

Dow Jones was forced to admit in court that "there was no reason to believe Mr Gutnick was a customer of Mr Goldberg or had any criminal or improper relations with Mr Goldberg." (quote from an Australian Broadcasting Corporation story) &lt;ref name="ABC12Nov2004" /&gt;

The High Court's ruling effectively allows [[defamation]] plaintiffs in Australia to sue for defamation on the [[internet]] against any defendant irrespective of their location.  "If people wish to do business in, or indeed travel to, or live in, or utilize the infrastructure of different countries, they can hardly expect to be absolved from compliance with the laws of those countries.  The fact that publication might occur everywhere does not mean that it occurs nowhere." (per Callinan J at para 186)

Equally, however, the majority of the Court (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ handing down a joint decision) stated that they disagreed that this would cause open-slather defamation actions in Australia: (at para 54 of the decision)

{{cquote|…the spectre which Dow Jones sought to conjure up in the present appeal, of a publisher forced to consider every article it publishes on the World Wide Web against the defamation laws of every country from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe is seen to be unreal when it is recalled that in all except the most unusual of cases, identifying the person about whom material is to be published will readily identify the defamation law to which that person may resort.}}

The case was highly controversial and the subject of much commentary from legal analysts.&lt;ref name=PacificRimLawJournal&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://digital.lib.washington.edu/dspace-law/bitstream/handle/1773.1/686/13PacRimLPolyJ61.pdf?sequence=1|title=Gutnick grist for the learned friends' mill– Media, News |journal=Pacific Rim Law Journal |date=2003-04-17 |accessdate=2013-08-04 |first=Christopher|last=Webb}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The case was appealed by the author, to the UN under the right of direct petition for individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/billyalpert/home/alpert-vs-australia Text of the communication]&lt;/ref&gt; In the teeth of that application prepared by [[Geoffrey Robertson]], Tim Robertson SC, [[Mark Stephens (solicitor)]] and Sydney based lawyer Paul Reidy, the case was settled on 15 November 2004, Dow Jones settled the case, agreeing to pay Gutnick some of his legal fees.&lt;ref name="ABC12Nov2004" /&gt;

'''Earth sheltering''' is the architectural practice of using [[soil|earth]] against building walls for external [[thermal mass]], to reduce heat loss, and to easily maintain a steady indoor air temperature. Earth sheltering has become relatively more popular in modern times, especially among [[environmentalists]] and advocates of [[passive solar]] and [[sustainable architecture]].  However, the practice has been around for nearly as long as humans have been constructing their own shelters.

==Definition==
The expression earth-sheltering is a generic term, with the general meaning: ''building design in which soil plays an integral part''.

A building can be described as earth-sheltered if its external envelope is in contact with a thermally significant volume of soil or substrate (where “thermally significant” means making a functional contribution to the thermal effectiveness of the building in question.)

Earth-sheltered buildings consist of one or more of three types: earth-covered, earth-bunded, and subterranean.  An earth-covered building is one where the thermally effective element is placed solely on the roof, but is more usually a continuation of the earth-bunding at the unexposed elevations of the building.  An earth-bunded building is one where the thermally significant element insulates one or more of the sheltered elevations of the building.  The bunding can be partial or total.  A subterranean building is one where the thermally significant element insulates all elevations of the building, leaving only the roof exposed;  or, if the building is built into an incline, it may be that the roof is covered and only one elevation is left exposed.&lt;ref&gt;Harrall. J. 2007. Demonstrating the Viability and Growing Acceptability of Earth-Sheltered Buildings in the UK&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Living in earth shelters has been a large part of human history.
The connection to earth shelter dwellings began with the utilization of caves, and over time evolving technologies led to the construction of customized earth dwellings. Today, earth shelter construction is a rare practice, especially in the U.S.A. During the energy crisis and the [[1973 Oil Crisis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/Green-Homes/2006-10-01/Earth-sheltered-Homes.aspx|title=Earth-sheltered Homes|work=Mother Earth News}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with the [[back-to-the-land movement]], there was a surge of interest in earth shelter/underground home construction in an effort toward self-sufficient living. However, progress has been slow, and earth shelter construction is often viewed by architects, engineers, and the public alike as an unconventional method of building. Techniques of earth sheltering have not yet become common knowledge, and much of society still remains unaware of the process or benefits of this type of building construction.

==Types of construction==
[[File:Cabaña subterránea en la región de Búðahraun, Vesturland, Islandia, 2014-08-14, DD 046.JPG|thumbnail|Example of an abandoned [[Iceland]]ic turf house in the region of {{Interlanguage link multi|Búðahraun|is}} via earth berming]]
* '''Earth berming:'''  Earth is piled up against exterior walls and packed, sloping down away from the house. The roof may or may not be fully earth covered, and windows/openings may occur on one or more sides of the shelter. Due to the building being above ground, fewer moisture problems are associated with earth berming in comparison to underground/fully recessed construction.
* '''In-hill construction:'''  The house is set into a slope or hillside. The most practical application is using a hill facing towards the equator (south in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and north in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]). There is only one exposed wall in this type of earth sheltering, the wall facing out of the hill, all other walls are embedded within the earth/hill.
* '''Underground/fully recessed construction:'''  The ground is excavated, and the house is set in below grade. It can also be referred to as an [[Atrium (architecture)|Atrium]] style due to the common atrium/courtyard constructed in the middle of the shelter to provide adequate light and ventilation.

==Benefits==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Addison Sod House]] --&gt;
The benefits of earth sheltering are numerous. They include usage of the earth as a thermal mass, extra protection from the natural elements, energy savings, substantial privacy in comparison to more conventional homes, efficient use of land in urban settings, low maintenance requirements, and the ability to take advantage of [[passive solar building design]].

The Earth's mass absorbs and retains heat. Over time, this heat is released to surrounding areas, such as an earth shelter. Because of the high density of the earth, change in the earth’s temperature occurs slowly. This is known as ‘thermal lag.’ Because of this principle, the earth provides a fairly constant temperature for the underground shelters, even when the outdoor temperature undergoes great fluctuation.  In most of the [[United States]], the average temperature of the earth once below the [[frost line]] is between 55 and 57 degrees Fahrenheit (13 to 14 degrees Celsius). Frost line depths vary from region to region. In the USA frost lines can range from just under the surface to more than 40&amp;nbsp; inches.  Thus, at the base of a deep earth [[berm]], the house is heated against an exterior temperature gradient of perhaps ten to fifteen degrees, instead of against a steeper temperature grade where the air is on the outside of the wall instead of earth. During the summer, the temperature gradient helps to cool the house.

The reduction of air infiltration within an earth shelter can be highly profitable. Because three walls of the structure are mainly surrounded by earth, very little surface area is exposed to the outside air. This alleviates the problem of warm air escaping the house through gaps around windows and door. Furthermore, the earth walls protect against cold winter winds which might otherwise penetrate these gaps. However, this can also become a potential indoor air quality problem. Healthy air circulation is key.

As a result of the increased [[thermal mass]] of the structure, the [[thermal lag]] of the earth, the protection against unwanted air infiltration and the combined use of passive solar techniques, the need for extra heating and cooling is minimal. Therefore, there is a drastic reduction in energy consumption required for the home compared to homes of typical construction.

Earth shelters also provide privacy from neighbors, as well as soundproofing. The ground provides acoustic protection against outside noise. This can be a major benefit in urban areas or near highways. In urban areas, another benefit of underground sheltering is the efficient use of land. Many houses can sit below grade without spoiling the habitat above ground. Each site can contain both a house and a lawn/garden.

==Potential problems==
Problems of water seepage, internal [[condensation]], bad acoustics, and poor indoor air quality can occur if an earth shelter has not been properly designed.

Issues also include the sustainability of building materials. Earth sheltering often requires heavier construction than conventional building techniques, and many construction companies have limited or no experience with earth-sheltered construction, potentially compromising the physical construction of even the best designs.

The threat of water seepage occurs around areas where the waterproofing layers have been penetrated. Vents and ducts emerging from the roof can cause specific problems due to the possibility of movement. Precast concrete slabs can have a deflection of 1/2&amp;nbsp; inch or more when the earth/soil is layered on top of them. If the vents or ducts are held rigidly in place during this deflection, the result is usually the failure of the waterproofing layer. To avoid this difficulty, vents can be placed on other sides of the building (besides the roof), or separate segments of pipes can be installed. A narrower pipe in the roof that fits snugly into a larger segment of the building can also be used. The threat of water seepage, condensation, and poor indoor air quality can all be overcome with proper waterproofing and ventilation.

The building materials for earth-sheltered construction tend to be of non-biodegradable substances. Because the materials must keep water out, they are often made of plastics. Concrete is another material that is used in great quantity. More sustainable products are being tested to replace the [[cement]] within concrete (such as [[fly ash]]), as well as alternatives to reinforced concrete (see more under Materials: Structural). The excavation of a site is also drastically time- and labor-consuming. Overall, the construction is comparable to conventional construction, because the building requires minimal finishing and significantly less maintenance.

Condensation and poor quality indoor air problems can be solved by using earth tubes, or what is known as a [[geothermal heat pump]]—a concept different from earth sheltering. With modification, the idea of earth tubes can be used for underground buildings: instead of looping the earth tubes, leave one end open downslope to draw in fresh air using the chimney effect by having exhaust vents placed high in the underground building.

==Landscape and site planning==
The [[site planning]] for an earth-sheltered building is an integral part of the overall design; investigating the landscape of a potential building site is crucial. There are many factors to assess when surveying a site for underground construction. The topography, regional climate, vegetation, water table and [[soil type]] of varying landscapes all play dynamic roles in the design and application of earth shelters.

===Topography===
On land that is relatively flat, a fully recessed house with an open courtyard is the most appropriate design. On a sloping site, the house is set right into the hill. The slope will determine the location of the window wall; a south-facing exposed wall is the most practical in the Northern hemisphere (and north-facing in the Southern hemisphere) due to solar benefits.  The most practical house design in the tropics (and with equal advantage in both hemispheres) is that the two shorter walls on the ends be exposed, one facing east and the other facing west.

===Regional climate===
Depending on the region and site selected for earth-sheltered construction, the benefits and objectives of the earth shelter construction vary. For cool and temperate climates, objectives consist of retaining winter heat, avoiding infiltration, receiving winter sun, using thermal mass, shading and ventilating during the summer, and avoiding winter winds and cold pockets. For hot, arid climates objectives include maximizing humidity, providing summer shade, maximizing summer air movement, and retaining winter heat. For hot, humid climates objectives include avoiding summer humidity, providing summer ventilation, and retaining winter heat.

Regions with extreme daily and seasonal temperatures emphasize the value of earth as a thermal mass. In this way, earth sheltering is most effective in regions with high cooling and heating needs and high-temperature differentials. In regions such as the southeastern United States, earth sheltering may need additional care in maintenance and construction due to condensation problems in regard to the high humidity. The ground temperature of the region may be too high to permit earth cooling if temperatures fluctuate only slightly from day to night. Preferably, there should be adequate winter solar radiation and sufficient means for natural ventilation. Wind is a critical aspect to evaluate during site planning, for reasons regarding wind chill and heat loss, as well as ventilation of the shelter. In the Northern Hemisphere, south facing slopes tend to avoid cold winter winds typically blown in from the north. Fully recessed shelters also offer adequate protection against these harsh winds. However, atria within the structure have the ability to cause minor turbulence depending on the size. In the summer, it is helpful to take advantage of the prevailing winds. Because of the limited window arrangement in most earth shelters, and the resistance to air infiltration, the air within a structure can become stagnant if proper ventilation is not provided. By making use of the wind, natural ventilation can occur without the use of fans or other active systems.  Knowing the direction, and intensity, of seasonal winds, is vital in promoting cross ventilation. Vents are commonly placed in the roof of bermed or fully recessed shelters to achieve this effect.

===Vegetation===
The [[plant]] cover of the landscape is another important factor.  Adding plants can be both positive and negative.  Nearby trees may be valuable in wet climates because their roots remove water. However a prospective builder should know what types of trees are in the area and how large and rapidly they tend to grow, due to possible solar-potential compromise with their growth. Vegetation can provide a windbreak for houses exposed to winter winds. The growth of small vegetation, especially those with deep roots, also helps in the prevention of erosion, on the house and in the surrounding site.

===Soil and drainage===
The soil type is one of the essential factors during site planning. The soil needs to provide adequate [[bearing capacity]] and [[drainage]], and help to retain heat. With respects to drainage, the most suitable type of soil for earth sheltering is a mixture of [[sand]] and [[gravel]]. Well, graded gravels have a large bearing capacity (about 8,000 pounds per square foot), excellent drainage and a low [[Frost heaving|frost heave]] potential. Sand and [[clay]] can be susceptible to [[erosion]]. Clay soils, while least susceptible to erosion, often do not allow for proper drainage, and have a higher potential for frost heaves. Clay soils are more susceptible to thermal shrinking and expanding. Being aware of the moisture content of the soil and the fluctuation of that content throughout the year will help prevent potential heating problems. Frost heaves can also be problematic in some soil. Fine grain soils retain moisture the best and are most susceptible to heaving. A few ways to protect against [[capillary action]] responsible for frost heaves are placing foundations below the freezing zone or insulating ground surface around shallow footings, replacement of frost-sensitive soils with granular material, and interrupting capillary draw of moisture by putting a drainage layer of coarser material in the existing soil.

Water can cause potential damage to earth shelters if it ponds around the shelter. Avoiding sites with a high [[water table]] is crucial. Drainage, both surface, and subsurface must be properly dealt with. Waterproofing applied to the building is essential.

Atrium designs have an increased risk of flooding, so the surrounding land should slope away from the structure on all sides. A drain pipe at the perimeter of the roof edge can help collect and remove additional water. For bermed homes, an interceptor drain at the crest of the berm along the edge of the rooftop is recommended. An interceptor drainage [[Swale (geographical feature)|swale]] in the middle of the berm is also helpful or the back of the berm can be terraced with retaining walls. On sloping sites runoff may cause problems. A drainage swale or gully can be built to divert water around the house, or a gravel-filled trench with a drain tile can be installed along with footing drains.

Soil stability should also be considered, especially when evaluating a sloping site. These slopes may be inherently stable when left alone, but cutting into them can greatly compromise their structural stability. Retaining walls and backfills may have to be constructed to hold up the slope prior to shelter construction.

==Construction methods==

===Current methods===
In earth-sheltered construction, there is often extensive excavation done on the building site.  An excavation several feet larger than the walls' planned perimeter is made to allow for access to the outside of the wall for waterproofing and insulation.  Once the site is prepared and the utility lines installed, a foundation of reinforced concrete is poured.  The walls are then installed. Usually, they are either poured in place or formed either on or off-site and then moved into place.  Reinforced concrete is the most common choice.  The process is repeated for the roof structure.  If the walls, floor, and roof are all to be poured in place, it is possible to make them with a single pour.  This can reduce the likelihood of there being cracks or leaks at the joints where the concrete has cured at different times.

On the outside of the concrete, a waterproofing system is applied.  The most frequently used waterproofing system includes a layer of liquid asphalt onto which a heavy grade waterproof membrane is affixed, followed by a final liquid water sealant which may be sprayed on.  It is very important to make sure that all of the seams are carefully sealed. It is very difficult to locate and repair leaks in the waterproofing system after the building is completed.

One or more layers of insulation board or foam are added on the outside of the waterproofing.  If the insulation chosen is porous, a top layer of waterproofing is added. After everything is complete, the earth is backfilled into the remaining space at the exterior of the wall and sometimes over the roof to accommodate a green roof.  Any exposed walls and the interior are finished according to the owners' preferences.

===Materials===

====Structural====
Reinforced concrete is the most commonly used structural material in earth shelter construction.  It is strong and readily available.  Untreated wood rots within five years of use in earth shelter construction.  Steel can be used but needs to be encased by concrete to keep it from direct contact with the soil which corrodes the metal.  Bricks and CMUs (concrete masonry units) are also possible options in earth shelter construction but must be reinforced to keep them from shifting under vertical pressure unless the building is constructed with arches and vaults.

Unfortunately, reinforced concrete is not the most environmentally sustainable material.  The concrete industry is working to develop products that are more earth-friendly in response to consumer demands.  Products like [[Grancrete]] and [[Hycrete]] are becoming more readily available.  They claim to be environmentally friendly and either reduce or eliminate the need for additional waterproofing. However, these are new products and have not been extensively used in earth shelter construction yet.

Some unconventional approaches are also proposed.  One such method is a PSP method proposed by Mike Oehler. The PSP method uses wooden posts, plastic sheeting and non-conventional ideas that allow more windows and ventilation.  This design also reduces some runoff problems associated with conventional designs.  The method uses wood posts, a frame that acts like a rib to distribute settling forces, specific construction methods which rely on fewer pieces of heavy equipment, plastic sheeting, and earth floors with plastic and carpeting.

====Waterproofing====
Several layers are used for waterproofing in earth shelter construction.  The first layer is meant to seal any cracks or pores in the structural materials, also working as an adhesive for the waterproof membrane.  The membrane layer is often a thick flexible polyethylene sheeting called [[EPDM rubber|EPDM]].  EPDM is the material usually used in a water garden, pond and swimming pool construction.  This material also prevents roots from burrowing through the waterproofing.  EPDM is very heavy to work with and can be chewed through by some common insects like fire ants. It is also made from petrochemicals, making it less than perfectly environmentally friendly.

There are various cementitious coatings that can be used as waterproofing.  The product is sprayed directly onto the unprotected surface.  It dries and acts like a huge ceramic layer between the wall and earth.  The challenge with this method is, if the wall or foundation shifts in any way, it cracks and water is able to penetrate through it easily.

Bituthene (registered name) is very similar to the three coat layering process only in one step.  It comes already layered in sheets and has a self-adhesive backing.  The challenge with this is the same as with the manual layering method, in addition, it is sun sensitive and must be covered very soon after application.

Eco-Flex is an environmentally friendly waterproofing membrane that seems to work very well on foundations, but not much is known about its effectiveness in earth sheltering.  It is among a group of liquid paint-on waterproofing products.  The main challenges with these are they must be carefully applied, making sure that every area is covered to the right thickness, and that every crack or gap is tightly sealed.

[[Bentonite]] clay is the alternative that is closest to optimum on the environmental scale.  It is naturally occurring and self-healing.  The drawback to this system is that it is very heavy and difficult for the owner/builder to install and subject to termite damage.

Bi-membranes have been used extensively throughout Australia where 2 membranes are paired together—typically 2 coats of water-based epoxy as a 'sealer' and stop the internal vapor pressure of the moist concrete exploding bubbles of vapor up underneath the membrane when exposed to hot sun. The bond strength of epoxy to concrete is stronger than the internal bond strength of concrete so the membranes won't 'blow' off the wall in the sun. Epoxies are very brittle so they are paired up with an overcoat of a high-build flexible water-based acrylic membrane in multiple coats of different colors to ensure film coverage—this is reinforced with non-woven polypropylene textile in corners and changes in direction.

====Insulation====
Unlike the conventional building, earth shelters require the insulation on the exterior of the building rather than inside the wall.  One reason for this is that it provides protection for the waterproof membrane against freeze damage, another is that the earth shelter is able to better retain its desired temperature.  There are two types of insulation used in earth shelter construction.  The first is close-celled extruded polystyrene sheets.  Two to three inches glued to the outside of the waterproofing is generally sufficient.  The second type of insulation is a spray on foam.  This works very well where the shape of the structure is unconventional, rounded or difficult to get to.  Foam insulation requires an additional protective top coat such as foil to help it resist water penetration.

In some low budget earth shelters, insulation may not be applied to the walls.  These methods rely on the U factor or thermal heat storage capacity of the earth itself below the frost layer.  These designs are the exception however and risk frost heave damage in colder climates.  The theory behind no insulation designs relies on using the thermal mass of the earth to store heat, rather than relying on a heavy masonry or cement inner structures that exist in a typical passive solar house.  This is the exception to the rule and cold temperatures may extend down into the earth above the frost line making insulation necessary for higher efficiencies.

==Design for energy conservation==
Earth sheltered homes are often constructed with energy conservation and savings in mind. Specific designs of earth shelters allow for maximum savings. For bermed or in-hill construction, a common plan is to place all the living spaces on the side of the house facing the equator. This provides maximum solar radiation to bedrooms, living rooms, and kitchen spaces. Rooms that do not require natural daylight and extensive heating such as the bathroom, storage, and utility room are typically located on the opposite (or in hill) side of the shelter.  This type of layout can also be transposed to a double level house design with both levels completely underground. This plan has the highest energy efficiency of earth sheltered homes because of the compact configuration as well as the structure being submerged deeper in the earth. This provides it with a greater ratio of earth cover to an exposed wall than a one-storey shelter would.

With an atrium earth shelter, the living spaces are concentrated around the atrium. The atrium arrangement provides a much less compact plan than that of the one or two story bermed/in hill design; therefore it is commonly less energy efficient, in terms of heating needs. This is one of the reasons why atrium designs are classically applied to warmer climates. However, the atrium does tend to trap air within it which is then heated by the sun and helps reduce heat loss.

==Earth sheltering with solar heating==
Earth sheltering is often combined with solar heating systems. Most commonly, the utilization of passive solar design techniques is used in earth shelters. In the Northern Hemisphere, a south facing structure with the north, east, and west sides covered with earth is the most effective application for [[passive solar]] systems.  A large double glazed window, triple glazed or [[Zomeworks]] [[beadwall]] (vacuum/blower pumps that filled your double pane solar windows with styrofoam balls at night for extra insulation and vacuumed the beads out in the morning, patent now expired.  This changes a window from an R3 thermal resistance to an R16 to R32(depending on the thickness of styrofoam bead wall)), spanning most of the length of the south wall is critical for solar heat gain. It is helpful to accompany the window with insulated drapes to protect against heat loss at night. Also, during the summer months, providing an overhang, or some sort of shading device, is used to block out an excess solar gain. Combining solar heating with earth sheltering is referred to as "[[annualized geo solar]] design", "Passive annual heat storage", or sometimes as an "Umbrella house." (See Nick Pine's posting on Usenet alt.homepower and alt.solar.thermal groups about this type of house.) In the umbrella house, Polystyrene insulation extends around {{convert|23|ft|m}} radius from underground walls. A plastic film covers the insulation (for waterproofing), and soil is a layer on top. The materials slope downward, like an umbrella. It sheds excess water while keeping the soil temperature warm and dry.

[[Passive cooling]] which pulls air with a fan or convection from a nearly constant temperature air into buried [[Earth cooling tubes]] and then into the house living space.  This also provides fresh air to occupants and the air exchange required by [[ASHRAE]].

==Earth shelter construction: history and examples==

===Berming===
[[File:EarthShelterRestAreaOH.JPG|thumb|right|Earth Sheltered rest area along [[Interstate 77 in Ohio]], USA]]

Historically, earth berming was a common building practice that combined heavy timber framing and rough stonework with stacking thick layers of sod or peat against the walls and on the roof.  This served as excellent protection from the elements.  In a relatively short period of time the earth layers grow together leaving the structure with an appearance of a hill with a door.

In these early structures, the heavy timber framing acted as structural support and added comfort and warmth to the interior.  Rough stone was often stacked along the outer walls with a simple lime mortar for structural support and often serves as an exterior facing wall and foundation.  There is a greater use of stone work in earth shelter structures in areas where timber is scarce.  These are the most sustainable of the earth shelters as far as materials go because they are able to decompose and return to earth.  This is why there are few remaining example like Hvalsey Church in Greenland where only the stacked stones remain. One of the oldest examples of berming, dating back some 5,000 years, can be found at [[Skara Brae]] in the [[Orkney Islands]] off northern [[Scotland]].

Today’s bermed earth structures are built quite differently from those of the past.  Common construction employs large amounts of steel reinforced concrete acting as structural support and building shell.  Bulldozers or bobcats are used to pile earth around the building and on the roof instead of stacking earth in place.  One modern example of bermed earth structures is the [[Hockerton Housing Project]], a community of 5 homes in [[Nottinghamshire]], [[England]].

===In-hill===
One historical example of in-hill earth shelters would be [[Mesa Verde]], in the southwest United States.  These building are constructed directly onto the ledges and caves on the face of the cliffs.  The front wall is built up with local stone and earth to enclose the structure.  Similarly today, in-hill earth shelter construction utilizes the natural formation of a hillside for two to three of the exterior walls and sometimes the roof of a structure.  Alternative builders craft a type of in-hill structure known as an [[Earthship]].  In Earthship construction, [[tire]]s rammed with earth are used as structural materials for three of the walls and generally have a front façade of windows to capture passive solar energy.

A well-known example of an earth-sheltered home is [[Bill Gates' house|the residence of Bill Gates]], who had it built over a period of several years on a heavily wooded site on the shore of [[Lake Washington]], USA. It is an excellent example of the lack of obtrusiveness of this kind of home, since it appears much smaller than it actually is, when seen from the lake.

===Underground===
Though underground construction is relatively uncommon in the US (except for basements where only 1 floor is underground), successful examples can be found in Australia where the ground is so hard that there is little to no need for structural supports and a pick ax and shovel are the tools of the builder/remodeler. See [[Coober Pedy]] and [[Lightning Ridge]]. The [[Forestiere Underground Gardens]] in Fresno, California is a North American example.

In the early 1970s, China undertook the construction of [[Underground City (Beijing)|Dixia Cheng]], a city underneath [[Beijing]].  It was primarily a complex of bomb shelters that could house 40% of the population at that time.  It was a response to the fear of Soviet attack.  Parts of it are now used in more commercial ventures.

In United States law, the '''Establishment Clause''' of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]],  together with that Amendment's [[Free Exercise Clause]], form the constitutional right of freedom of religion. The relevant constitutional text is: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...".

The Establishment Clause was based on a number of precedents, including the [[Constitutions of Clarendon]], the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], and the Pennsylvania and New Jersey colonial constitutions.  An initial draft by [[John Dickinson]] was prepared in conjunction with his drafting the [[Articles of Confederation]].  In 1789, then-congressman [[James Madison]] prepared another draft which, following discussion and debate in the [[1st United States Congress|First Congress]], would become part of the text of the First Amendment of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]. The second half of the Establishment Clause includes the [[Free Exercise Clause]], which allows individual citizens freedom from governmental interference in both private and public religious affairs.

The Establishment Clause is a limitation placed upon the United States Congress preventing it from passing legislation respecting an establishment of religion. The second half of the Establishment Clause inherently prohibits the government from preferring any one religion over another. While the Establishment Clause does prohibit Congress from preferring or elevating one religion over another, it does not prohibit the government's entry into the religious domain to make accommodations for religious observances and practices in order to achieve the purposes of the Free Exercise Clause.

==Historical background==

===Constitutions of Clarendon===

The [[Constitutions of Clarendon]], a 12th century English law, had prohibited criminal defendants' using religious laws (at that time, in medieval England, canon law of the Roman Catholic Church) to seek exemption from criminal prosecution.

===1689 Bill of Rights===

The [[1689 Bill of Rights|1689 English Bill of Rights]] secured the rights of all "persons" to be free from establishment of Roman Catholic laws in the government of England.

===Colonial New Jersey and Pennsylvania Constitutions===

The original [[Mason-Dixon line]] was the demarcation line between the Catholic colony of Maryland and the New Jersey and Pennsylvania colonies, which followed the 1689 Bill of Rights and their own colonial constitutions which provided similar protections against the establishment of Catholic laws in government.

===Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom===
{{Main article|Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom}}
A possible additional precursor of the Free Exercise Clause was the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. The statute was drafted by [[Thomas Jefferson]] in 1777 and was introduced in the [[Virginia General Assembly]] in 1779. It did not pass the General Assembly until 1786. [[James Madison]] played an important role in its passage. The statute disestablished the [[Church of England]] in Virginia and guaranteed [[freedom of religion]] exercise to men of all religious faiths, including [[History of Roman Catholicism in the United States|Catholics]] and [[American Jews|Jews]] as well as members of all [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virginiamemory.com/online_classroom/shaping_the_constitution/doc/religious_freedom |title=Act for Establishing Religious Freedom, January 16, 1786 |work=Shaping the Constitution |publisher=Virginia Memory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom granted these rights to {{em|men}}, whereas the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] grants rights to {{em|persons}}, as does the 1689 Bill of Rights and the colonial constitutions in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

===United States Bill of Rights===
{{Main article|United States Bill of Rights}}
{{See also|Anti-Federalism}}
The First Amendment is part of a group of 10 Amendments to the United States Constitution known as the Bill of Rights. The idea of adding a Bill of Rights to the Constitution was proposed by [[George Mason]] five days before the conclusion of the Constitutional Convention held in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] in 1787.&lt;ref name="madison struggle"&gt;{{cite book| first=Richard |last=Labunski| title= James Madison and the struggle for the Bill of Rights| publisher=Oxford University Press| year= 2006|isbn= 0199740992}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}}  His proposal was rejected by the other delegates.  [[Alexander Hamilton]] later argued in ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' that a Bill of Rights was unnecessary, claiming that since the Constitution granted limited powers to the federal government, it did not grant the new government the power to abuse the rights that would be secured by a Bill of Rights.&lt;ref name="madison struggle" /&gt;{{rp|9–10}} Nevertheless, the supporters of the Constitution (known as [[Federalist#United States|Federalists]]) in order to secure its ratification in [[Massachusetts]], agreed to add a group of Amendments to the Constitution after its ratification that would serve as a Bill of Rights.  Later, six more states likewise recommended the addition of a Bill of Rights, and the idea also gained the support of Jefferson and Madison.  When the First Federal Congress met in 1789, Madison implemented the idea by introducing 17 Amendments to the Constitution.  By December 1791, ten of his Amendments were ratified by the necessary three quarters of the states, and they became part of the US Constitution, thereafter becoming known as "the Bill of Rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_history.html|title=A More Perfect Union: The Creation of the U.S. Constitution|accessdate=July 17, 2010|last = Bruns| first= Roger A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concerns of Virginia Baptists===
The Establishment Clause addressed the concerns of members of minority faiths who did not want the federal government to establish a [[state religion]] for the entire nation.  The [[Baptists]] in [[Virginia]], for example, had suffered discrimination prior to the disestablishment of the [[Anglican church]] in 1786.  As Virginia prepared to hold its elections to the state ratifying convention in 1788, the Baptists were concerned that the Constitution had no safeguard against the creation of a new national church.  In [[Orange County, Virginia]], two federalist candidates, James Madison and James Gordon Jr., were running against two anti-federalists (opponents of the Constitution), [[Thomas Barbour (Virginia)|Thomas Barbour]] and Charles Porter.  Barbour requested to [[John Leland (Baptist)|John Leland]], an influential Baptist preacher and fervent lifelong proponent of religious liberty, that he write a letter to Barbour outlining his objections to the proposed Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Mark S.|last=Scarberry|title=John Leland and James Madison: Religious influence on the Ratification of the Constitution and on the Proposal of the Bill of Rights|journal=Penn State Law Review |volume=113|issue=3|pages=733–800|year=2009|ssrn=1262520}}  See p. 764, footnote 147, which presents a quote from a copy of Leland's letter (as quoted in an article by L.H. Butterfield): "Sir, According to your Request, I have sent you my objections to the Foederal Constitution, which are as follows. . . .".&lt;/ref&gt;  Leland stated in the letter that, among his other concerns, the Constitution had no Bill of Rights and no safeguards for religious liberty and freedom of the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Mark S.|last=Scarberry|title=John Leland and James Madison: Religious influence on the Ratification of the Constitution and on the Proposal of the Bill of Rights|journal=Penn State Law Review |volume=113|issue=3|pages=733–800|year=2009|ssrn=1262520}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of historians have concluded on the basis of compelling circumstantial evidence that, just prior to the election in March 1788, Madison met with Leland and gained his support of ratification by addressing these concerns and providing him with the necessary reassurances.  In any event, Leland cast his vote for Madison.  Leland's support, according to Scarberry, was likely key to the landslide victory of Madison and Gordon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Mark S.|last=Scarberry|title=John Leland and James Madison: Religious influence on the Ratification of the Constitution and on the Proposal of the Bill of Rights|journal=Penn State Law Review |volume=113|issue=3|pages=733–800|year=2009|ssrn=1262520}}  Scarberry states on pp. 775-6: "At the very least, it seems probable that Madison met with Leland before the election and persuaded Leland to support Madison's candidacy, which otherwise likely would have failed."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Philip |last= Hamburger|title=Separation of Church and State| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q6Axd76IE1UC|year=2004|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-01374-2|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=q6Axd76IE1UC&amp;pg=PA156 156]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incorporation==
{{main|Incorporation of the Bill of Rights}}
Prior to the enactment of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] in 1868, the [[U.S. Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] generally held that the substantive protections of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] did not apply to state governments. Subsequently, under the [[Incorporation doctrine]], the Bill of Rights has been broadly applied to limit state and local government as well. The process of incorporating the two Religion Clauses in the First Amendment was twofold. The first step was the Supreme Court's conclusion in 1940 that the Free Exercise Clause was made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cantwell v. Connecticut]]'', 310 U.S. 296 (1940)&lt;/ref&gt; Conceptually, this raised few difficulties: the Due Process Clause protects those rights in the Bill of Rights "implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Palko v. Connecticut]]'', 302 U.S. 319, 326 (1937)&lt;/ref&gt; and free exercise of religion is a quintessential individual right (and had been recognized as such at the state level from the beginning).&lt;ref name=MGB74&gt;{{cite book| first1= Michael W. |last1= McConnell| first2= John H. |last2= Garvey| first3= Thomas C. |last3= Berg| title= Religion and the Constitution |year=2006| publisher= Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business| isbn=073550718X|series=Aspen casebook series| page= 74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incorporation of the Establishment Clause in 1947&lt;ref&gt;''[[Everson v. Board of Education]]'', 330 U.S. 1 (1947)&lt;/ref&gt; proved to be problematic in several ways and subject to critique.&lt;ref name=MGB74 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[School District of Abington Township v. Schempp]]'', 374 U.S. 203 (1963) (Brennan, J., concurring) ("The absorption of the Establishment Clause has, however, come later and by a route less easily charted.")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first= William K. |last= Lietzau| title= Rediscovering the Establishment Clause: Federalism and the Rollback of Incorporation| volume= 39 |journal= DePaul L. Rev. |number= 1191 |year= 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= Stephen D. |last= Smith| title= Foreordained Failure: The Quest for a Constitutional Principle of Religious Freedom |publisher= Oxford University Press| chapter=Chapter 2: The Jurisdictional Character of the Religion Clauses |year= 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow]]'', 542 U.S. 1 (2004) (Thomas, J., concurring) ("I accept that the Free Exercise Clause . . . applies against the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. But the Establishment Clause is another matter.")&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy surrounding Establishment Clause incorporation primarily stems from the fact that one of the intentions of the Establishment Clause was to prevent Congress from interfering with state establishments of religion that existed at the time of the founding (at least six states had established religions at the founding)&lt;ref name="McConnell 1409"&gt;{{cite journal| title= The Origins and Historical Understanding of Free Exercise of Religion| first= Michael W. |last= McConnell| journal= [[Harvard Law Review]] | volume= 103| number= 7 |year= 1990| pages= 1409–1517 | doi=10.2307/1341281}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a fact conceded by even those members of the Court who believe the Establishment Clause was made applicable to the states through incorporation.&lt;ref&gt;''Abington v. Schempp'', 374 U.S. 203 (1963) (Brennan, J., concurring)&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have also argued that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is understood to incorporate only individual rights found in the Bill of Rights; the Establishment Clause, unlike the Free Exercise Clause (which critics readily concede protects individual rights),&lt;ref name="McConnell 1409"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow'', 542 U.S. 1 (2004) (Thomas, J., concurring).&lt;/ref&gt; does not purport to protect individual rights.&lt;ref name="McConnell 1409"/&gt;

==Financial assistance==
The Supreme Court first considered the question of financial assistance to religious organizations in ''[[Bradfield v. Roberts]]'' (1899). The federal government had funded a hospital operated by a Roman Catholic institution. In that case, the Court ruled that the funding was to a [[secularism|secular]] organization{{snd}}the hospital{{snd}}and was therefore permissible.

In the twentieth century, the Supreme Court more closely scrutinized government activity involving religious institutions. In ''[[Everson v. Board of Education]]'' (1947), the Supreme Court upheld a [[New Jersey]] statute funding student transportation to schools, whether [[parochial school|parochial]] or not. Justice [[Hugo Black]] held, 
{{quote|The "establishment of [[religion]]" clause of the First Amendment means at least this: Neither a state nor the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] can set up a church. Neither can pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another. Neither can force nor influence a person to go to or to remain away from church against his will or force him to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion. No person can be punished for entertaining or professing religious beliefs or disbeliefs, for [[church attendance]] or non-attendance. No [[tax]] in any amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion. Neither a state nor the Federal Government can, openly or secretly, participate in the affairs of any religious organizations or groups and vice versa. In the words of [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]], the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect "a wall of separation between church and State."}}
The New Jersey law was upheld, for it applied "to all its citizens without regard to their religious belief."  After ''Everson'', lawsuits in several states sought to disentangle public monies from religious teaching, the leading case being the 1951 [[Dixon School Case]] out of New Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Pfeffer, Leo (1967) ''Church, state, and freedom'' Beacon Press, Boston, Massachusetts, pages 545-549&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jefferson quotation cited in Black's opinion is from a [[Wikisource:Jefferson letter to Neremiah Dodge and others|letter]] Jefferson wrote in 1802 to the [[Baptists]] of [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[Connecticut]], that there should be "a wall of [[separation between church and state]]." Critics of Black's reasoning (most notably, former Chief Justice [[William H. Rehnquist]]) have argued that the majority of states did have "official" churches at the time of the First Amendment's adoption and that [[James Madison]], not Jefferson, was the principal drafter. However, Madison himself often wrote of "perfect separation between the ecclesiastical and civil matters" (1822 letter to Livingston), which means the authority of the church (that which comes from the church) is decided by church authority, and that which is decided in civil government is decided by civil authorities; neither may decree law or policy in each other's realm. Another description reads: "line of separation between the rights of religion and the civil authority... entire abstinence of the government" (1832 letter Rev. Adams), and "practical distinction between Religion and Civil Government as essential to the purity of both, and as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States" (1811 letter to Baptist Churches).

In ''[[Lemon v. Kurtzman]]'' (1971), the Supreme Court ruled that government may not "excessively entangle" with religion. The case involved two [[Pennsylvania]] laws: one permitting the state to "purchase" services in secular fields from religious schools, and the other permitting the state to pay a percentage of the salaries of private school teachers, including teachers in religious institutions. The Supreme Court found that the government was "excessively entangled" with religion, and invalidated the statutes in question. The excessive entanglement test, together with the secular purpose and primary effect tests thereafter became known as the [[Lemon test]], which judges have often used to test the constitutionality of a statute on establishment clause grounds.

The Supreme Court decided ''Committee for Public Education &amp; Religious Liberty v. Nyquist'' and ''Sloan v. Lemon'' in 1973. In both cases, states&amp;mdash;[[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Pennsylvania]]&amp;mdash;had enacted laws whereby public [[tax]] revenues would be paid to low-income parents so as to permit them to send students to private schools. It was held that in both cases, the state unconstitutionally provided aid to religious organizations. The ruling was partially reversed in ''Mueller v. Allen'' (1983). There, the Court upheld a [[Minnesota]] statute permitting the use of tax revenues to reimburse parents of students. The Court noted that the Minnesota statute granted such aid to parents of all students, whether they attended public or private schools.

While the Court has prevented states from directly funding parochial schools, it has not stopped them from aiding religious colleges and universities. In ''[[Tilton v. Richardson]]'' (1971), the Court permitted the use of public funds for the construction of facilities in religious institutions of higher learning. It was found that there was no "excessive entanglement" since the buildings were themselves not religious, unlike teachers in parochial schools, and because the aid came in the form of a one-time grant, rather than continuous assistance.
One of the largest recent controversies over the amendment centered on [[school voucher]]s&amp;mdash;government aid for students to attend private and predominantly religious schools. The Supreme Court, in ''[[Zelman v. Simmons-Harris]]'' (2002), upheld the constitutionality of private school vouchers, turning away an Establishment Clause challenge. 
&lt;!--{{Merge from|date=May 2012}} ''[[school prayer]]''. --&gt;

== State-sanctioned prayer in public schools ==
[[File:Earl Warren.jpg|170px|right|thumb|[[Earl Warren]] was Chief Justice when ''[[Engel v. Vitale]]'' was decided.]]

Further important decisions came in the 1960s, during the [[Warren Court]] era. One of the Court's most controversial decisions came in ''[[Engel v. Vitale]]'' in 1962. The case involved the mandatory daily recitation by public school officials of a prayer written by the New York Board of Regents, which read "Almighty God, we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee, and we beg Thy blessings upon us, our parents, our teachers and our Country". The Supreme Court deemed it unconstitutional and struck it down, with Justice Black writing "it is no part of the official business of government to compose official prayers for any group of American people to recite as part of a religious program carried out by the Government." The reading of the [[Lord's Prayer]] or of the [[Bible]] in the classroom of a public school by the teacher was ruled unconstitutional in 1963. The ruling did not apply to parochial or private schools in general. The decision has been met with both criticism and praise. Many social conservatives are critical of the court's reasoning, including the late [[Chief Justice]] [[William H. Rehnquist]].  Conversely, the [[ACLU]] and other civil libertarian groups hailed the court's decision.

In ''[[Abington Township v. Schempp]]'' (1963), the case involving the mandatory reading of the Lord's Prayer in class, the Supreme Court introduced the "secular purpose" and "primary effect" tests, which were to be used to determine compatibility with the establishment clause. Essentially, the law in question must have a valid secular purpose, and its primary effect must not be to promote or inhibit a particular religion. Since the law requiring the recital of the Lord's Prayer violated these tests, it was struck down. The "excessive entanglement" test was added in ''[[Lemon v. Kurtzman]]'' (''vide supra'').

In ''[[Wallace v. Jaffree]]'' (1985), the Supreme Court struck down an [[Alabama]] law whereby students in public schools would observe daily a period of silence for the purpose of private prayer. The Court did not, however, find that the moment of silence was itself unconstitutional. Rather, it ruled that Alabama lawmakers had passed the statute solely to advance religion, thereby violating the secular purpose test.&lt;ref&gt;But see {{cite court |litigants=Bown v. Gwinnett County School District |vol=112 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1464 |pinpoint= |court=11th Cir. |date=1997 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/112/1464/585284/ |accessdate=2017-11-02 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990s were marked by controversies surrounding religion's role in public affairs. In ''[[Lee v. Weisman]]'' (1992), the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional the offering of prayers by religious officials before voluntarily attending ceremonies such as graduation. Thus, the Court established that the state could not conduct religious exercises at public occasions even if attendance was not strictly compulsory. In ''Lee'' the Court developed the [[coercion test]]. Under this test the government does not violate the establishment clause unless it (1) provides direct aid to religion in a way that would tend to establish a state church, or (2) coerces people to support or participate in religion against their will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Town of Greece v. Galloway: A deep dive|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/2010-2019/2013/2013_12_696|publisher=The Oyez Project at IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law|accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe]]'' (2000), the Court ruled that a vote of the student body could not authorize student-led prayer prior to school events.

In 2002, controversy centered on a ruling by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] in ''[[Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow]]'' (2002), which struck down a [[California]] law providing for the recitation of the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]] (which includes the phrase "under God") in classrooms. Each House of Congress passed resolutions reaffirming their support for the pledge; the [[United States Senate|Senate]] vote was 99–0 and the [[U.S. House of Representatives|House]] vote was 416–3. The Supreme Court heard arguments on the case, but did not rule on the merits, instead reversing the Ninth Circuit's decision on [[Standing (law)|standing]] grounds.

==Religious displays==
The inclusion of religious symbols in public holiday displays came before the Supreme Court in ''[[Lynch v. Donnelly]]'' (1984), and again in ''[[Allegheny County v. Greater Pittsburgh ACLU]]'' (1989). In the former case, the Court upheld the public display of a [[nativity scene|crèche]], ruling that any benefit to religion was "indirect, remote, and incidental." In ''Allegheny County'', however, the Court struck down a crèche display, which occupied a prominent position in the county courthouse and bore the words ''[[Gloria in Excelsis|Gloria in Excelsis Deo]]'', the words sung by the [[angel]]s at the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] ([[Book of Luke|Luke]] 2:14 in the [[Latin]] [[Vulgate]] translation). At the same time, the ''Allegheny County'' Court upheld the display of a nearby [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]], which appeared along with a Christmas tree and a sign saluting liberty, reasoning that "the combined display of the tree, the sign, and the menorah&amp;nbsp;... simply recognizes that both [[Christmas]] and [[Hanukkah]] are part of the same [[winter holiday season|winter-holiday season]], which has attained a secular status in our society." In ''[[Lynch v. Donnelly]]'' the Supreme Court also developed with the [[endorsement test]] a further test to determine the constitutionality under the Establishment Clause of certain government actions.&lt;ref&gt;For the [[Endorsement test]] see ''[[Lynch v. Donnelly]]'', {{Ussc|465|668|1984|el=no}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, [[Roy Moore]], then Chief Justice of [[Alabama]], installed a monument to the [[Ten Commandments]] in the state judicial building. In 2003, he was ordered in the case of ''[[Glassroth v. Moore]]'' by a federal judge to remove the monument, but he refused to comply, ultimately leading to his removal from office. The Supreme Court refused to hear the case, allowing the lower court's decision to stand.

On March 2, 2005, the Supreme Court heard arguments for two cases involving religious displays, ''[[Van Orden v. Perry]]'' and ''[[McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky]]''. These were the first cases directly dealing with display of the Ten Commandments the Court had heard since ''[[Stone v. Graham]]'' (1980). These cases were decided on June 27, 2005. In ''Van Orden'', the Court upheld, by a 5–4 vote, the legality of a Ten Commandments display at the [[Texas State Capitol]] due to the monument's "secular purpose". In ''McCreary County'', however, the Court ruled 5–4 that displays of the Ten Commandments in several [[Kentucky]] county courthouses were unconstitutional because they were not clearly integrated with a secular display, and thus were considered to have a religious purpose.

==Blue laws==
In the 1964 case [[McGowan v. Maryland]] the Supreme Court held that [[blue laws]] which restricted the sale of goods on Sundays (and were originally intended to increase Church attendance) did not violate the Establishment Clause because they served a present secular purpose of providing a uniform day of rest for everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = McGowan v.

The '''European Union Public Licence''' ('''EUPL''') is a [[free software licence]] that has been created and approved by the [[European Commission]]. The licence is available in 23 official languages of the European Union. All linguistic versions have the same validity. Its latest version, EUPL v1.2, was published in May 2017.

Software, mainly produced by European administrations, has been licensed under the EUPL&lt;ref&gt;[https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/interoperability/search Joinup forge]&lt;/ref&gt; since the launch of the European [[Open Source Observatory and Repository]] (OSOR) in October 2008, now part of [[Joinup collaboration platform|Joinup]] collaborative platform&lt;ref&gt;[https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/page/osor.eu Osor.eu migration]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
EUPL was originally intended to be used for the distribution of software developed in the framework of the [[IDABC]] programme&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/eupl.html Overview of the IDABC project.]&lt;/ref&gt;, given its generic scope it was also suitable for use by any software developer. Its main goal is its focusing on being consistent with the copyright law in the Member States of the [[European Union]], while retaining compatibility with popular open-source software licences such as the [[GNU General Public License]]. The first IDABC software packages mentioned are [[CIRCA (software)|CIRCA]] groupware,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/6540.html CIRCA groupware]&lt;/ref&gt; [[IPM (software)|IPM]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ec.europa.eu/yourvoice/ipm/ipmoss_en.htm IPM technical architecture]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/6541.html#achieve IPM EUPL]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[eLink]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/4171/5644 eLink]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Government-to-government|G2G]], [[G2C]], [[Government-to-business|G2B]] specification software.

==Comparison to other open source/free software licences==
EUPL is the first open source licence to be released by an international governing body. A goal of this licence is to create an open-source licence available into 23 official languages of the European Union,&lt;ref&gt;[https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/eupl/og_page/eupl-text-11-12 - European Union Public License]&lt;/ref&gt; and that is sure to conform to the existing copyright laws of the Member States of the European Union.

The licence was developed with other open-source licences in mind and specifically authorises covered works to be re-released under the following licences, when combined with their covered code in larger works:

{| class="wikitable"

Many other OSI-approved licences are compatible with the EUPL: JOINUP publish a general compatibility matrix between all OSI-approved licences and the EUPL.&lt;ref&gt;[https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/eupl/og_page/eupl-compatible-open-source-licences Matrix of EUPL compatible licences]&lt;/ref&gt;

An overview of the EUPL licence and on what makes it different has been published in OSS-Watch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/eupl.xml The EUPL - An Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versions==
EUPL v1.0 was approved on 9 January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/eupl.html EUPL v1.0 was published on 9 January 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; 

EUPL v1.1 was approved by the European Commission on 9 January 2009. EUPL v1.1 is [[Open Source Initiative|OSI]] certified as from March 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/page/introduction-eupl-licence#section-4|title=Introduction to the EUPL licence {{!}} Joinup|website=joinup.ec.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

EUPL v1.2 was published in May 2017.&lt;ref name="12decision"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2017.128.01.0059.01.ENG&amp;toc=OJ:L:2017:128:TOC|title=Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2017/863}}&lt;/ref&gt; EUPL v1.2 is OSI certified in July 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/page/introduction-eupl-licence#section-4|title=Introduction to the EUPL licence {{!}} Joinup|website=joinup.ec.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Version 1.2===
The EUPL v1.2 was prepared as from June 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/eupl/news/public-consultation-draft-eupl-v-12-has-been-fruitful|title=
Public Consultation on the draft EUPL v 1.2 has been fruitful|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; its decision process started in 2016 and &lt;ref name=public-consultation&gt;{{cite web|url=https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/eupl/topic/public-consultation-draft-eupl-v12|title=Public Consultation on the draft EUPL v1.2|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; released on 19 May 2017. A principal objective of the EUPL v1.2 is to update the appendix of compatible licences to cover newer popular licences such as the GNU GPLv3 and AGPLv3.&lt;ref name=public-consultation /&gt; 

According to the EUPL v.1.1, the European Commission may publish other linguistic versions and/or new versions of the EUPL, so far this is required and reasonable, without reducing the scope of the rights granted by the Licence. Future upgrades will not be applicable automatically when software was expressly released "under the EUPL v.1.1 only".&lt;ref&gt;[https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/news/understanding-eupl-v12]&lt;/ref&gt;

New provisions cover the [[Application service provider]] loophole of software distribution: Distribution and/or Communication (of software) includes providing on-line "access to its essential functionalities".&lt;ref&gt;See Article 1 of the EUPL 1.2 last subpoint, definition of ‘Distribution’ and ‘Communication’.&lt;/ref&gt;

A possible issue with the EUPL v1.2 is how the licence affects [[Linker (computing)|static and dynamic linking]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/eupl/eupl-compatible-open-source-licences#section-3 License compatibility in the case of static and dynamic linking.]&lt;/ref&gt; This currently depends on European and national law, according to the [[Computer Programs Directive|Computer Programs Directive (Directive 2009/24)]]. Recital 15 of this Directive states that for making two programs interoperable code needs to be translated or transformed. For example take program A (new original code just written) and program B (a program licensed by a third party), the legitimate holder or recipient of B may reproduce the needed code (e.g. the [[API|APIs]] or the needed data structures from program B) without copyright infringement and without authorisation. A can do this without being bonded by conditions or limitations imposed by a licence of program B. This must stay compatible with the normal use of program B. 

Unlike the "articles", the directive "recitals" are not transposed as such in national laws. However, recitals are part of European law: they are serving for understanding the scope and rationale of the law, and will be used by the court for interpreting the law, as the case may be. While recitals in EU Directives and Regulations are not considered to have independent legal value, they can expand an ambiguous provision's scope. They cannot restrict an unambiguous provision's scope, but they can be used to determine the nature of a provision, or to adapt it to new circumstances.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Member states policies==
As from 2010, EU member states adopt or revise policies aimed to encourage – when appropriate – the open source distribution of public sector applications. The EUPL is formally mentioned in some of these policies:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7436">'''Franchise termination''' is termination of a franchise [[business license]] by a [[franchisor]] or a [[franchisee]].

The [[United States]] [[Federal Trade Commission]] administrates oversight of preinvestment franchise disclusures via [[The Franchise Rule]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated102"&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/os/fedreg/2007/march/070330franchiserulefrnotice.pdf#page=102 Link to the text of the Franchise Rule contained within the Federal Register]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Franchise agreement]]s are regulated in the [[United States]] under state law, rather than federal law.

==Franchise termination agreement documents==

Clauses in the ''franchise agreement'' will stipulate grounds for termination, remedies against termination, and the process by either the franchisee or franchisor to start termination. Several states in the U.S. restrict terminations unless there is "good cause,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gurnick|first=David|title=Franchising Depositions|year=2003|publisher=Juris Publishing|location=U.S.|isbn=1-57823-102-7|pages=405|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o_ycQ-u9QysC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=franchise+depositions+david+gurnick}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not all states define this phrase in the same manner.

==Franchise termination notice via franchise fraud==

A franchisor that is practicing [[Franchise fraud]] will typically use a franchise termination process that was '''not''' disclosed in the [[Franchise agreement]], [[Uniform Franchise Offering Circular]], or [[Franchise Disclosure Document]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.ftc.gov/documents/inv07-franchise-and-business-opportunities Franchise and Business Opportunities | BCP Business Center] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006000000/http://business.ftc.gov/documents/inv07-franchise-and-business-opportunities |date=October 6, 2013 }}. Business.ftc.gov. Retrieved on 2010-12-06.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2007/01/franchiserule.shtm FTC Issues Updated Franchise Rule]. Ftc.gov. Retrieved on 2010-12-06.&lt;/ref&gt;  A churning franchise practicing Franchise fraud&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud FBI — Common Fraud Schemes]. Fbi.gov. Retrieved on 2010-12-06.&lt;/ref&gt;  can have a franchise termination process that includes:
* In the franchise agreement, specifying that contract disputes be settled by binding arbitration, away from the franchisees home state, which increases costs to the franchisee.
* Waiting until the franchisee reports they are in financial distress, which informs the franchisor that the franchisee does not have the funds to hire a lawyer.
* Demanding the failed franchisee pay up all unpaid royalties, fee, and penalties, prior to being issued the ''franchise termination'' documents from the franchisor.  Unpaid royalties and fees continue to accrue until the ''franchise termination'' agreement is signed.

===Franchise termination by threat of frivolous litigation===
Franchise termination documents can include two sets of documents; threat of  [[Frivolous litigation]], and a [[Legal release]] document.

The frivolous litigation threat can include claims of unpaid royalties, such as computer license fees, and unpaid future royalties and fees, which were not specified, or agreed to, in the original franchise agreement.

===Franchise termination legal release===
The Legal release used by a ''churning franchise'' can contain clauses such as
* The franchisee agrees to the unpaid, and not previously discussed or agreed sums that were listed in the Frivolous litigation letter.
* The franchisee and all existing and future family members are bound by the Legal release in essentially a [[Gag order]].
* The franchisee is released from future ''payments'', but is not released from the ''terms'' of the original franchise agreement and additional terms in the Franchise legal release.
*  The franchisee "voluntarily" transfers the failed franchise back to the franchisor, which allows the franchosor to avoid reporting the failed franchise statistics to the [[Federal Trade Commission]] in the UFOC or FDD, and allows the ''churning franchise'' to avoid informing future franchisee prospects of the true failures of the franchise concept.
* The franchisee cannot contact any former, current, or future franchisees to discuss the franchise termination process.
* A script as to what the former franchisee is only allowed to say to any prospective franchisee who contact them from a UFOC or FDD document.
* Substantial fines and penalties if the former franchisee violates the Legal release and discusses the contents with anyone by violating the ''Gag order''.
* The franchisee states that they signed the franchise legal release voluntarily, even if they had no financial means to legally dispute the frivolous claims.

'''Gary Peller''' (born 1955) is Professor of Law at [[Georgetown University Law Center]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/facinfo/tab_faculty.cfm?Status=Faculty&amp;ID=304&lt;/ref&gt; and a prominent member of the [[critical legal studies]] and [[critical race theory]] movements.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.diaspora.uiuc.edu/A-AAnewsletter/newsletter24.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://asitoughttobe.wordpress.com/2009/09/28/critical-legal-studies/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and early career==

Peller received an [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[Emory University]] in 1977 and a [[Juris Doctor]] degree from [[Harvard Law School]] where he served as a member of the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kmblegal.com/main/attorneys/of-counsel/gary-peller/&lt;/ref&gt;  Peller then clerked for [[Morris Lasker]], a judge of the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]].  He is currently a member of the Maryland state bar.{{Citation needed|reason=|date=July 2017}}

==Academic work and influence==

Peller was one of the central figures at the Conference on Critical Legal Studies.  With [[Kimberle Crenshaw]], Peller co-authored a widely cited article, "The Contradictions of Mainstream Constitutional Theory", published in the ''[[UCLA Law Review]]'', and co-edited one of the standard texts in [[critical race theory]].  Peller is among the irrationalist branch of the [[critical legal studies]] movement, arguing that there is no neutral or objective rationality but rather what is understood as knowledge is a socially contingent result of prevailing power dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/f/farber-reason.html&lt;/ref&gt;  He is also known for his debate with [[Mark Tushnet]] where he defended the critical race theorists' use of personal narrative rather than conventional arguments in their articles.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Duxbury, Patterns of American Jurisprudence, p. 503 fn 467 (Oxford Univ. Press, 1995, reprinted 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Good moral character''' is an ideal state of a person’s beliefs and values that is considered most beneficial to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nicomachean Ethics |url=http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam032/99036947.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Roy F.

People must have good moral character determined as a fact of law in predominately two contexts - (1) state-issued [[licensure]] that allows one to work and practice a regulated profession&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Craddock |first1=Larry |title="Good Moral Character" As A Licensing Standard |website=www.texasbarcle.com |url=http://www.texasbarcle.com/Materials/Events/6394/25228.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (2)  federal government-issued [[United States nationality law|U.S. citizenship]] certificates whereby an immigrant undergoes [[naturalization]] to become a citizen. Many laws create a paradox by placing the burden of proof of good moral character on the applicant while such a proof, but not the law, necessitates that the evaluators assess the beliefs and values of the applicant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cohen |first1=Taya R. |last2=Morse |first2=Lily |title=Moral character: What it is and what it does |journal=Research in Organizational Behavior |date=2014 |volume=34 |pages=43–61 |doi=10.1016/j.riob.2014.08.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Good moral character is the opposite of [[moral turpitude]], another legal concept in the United States used in similar instances.

==Assessments of good moral character==
Good moral character can be proven through the presence of several positive moral findings, having no-to-minimal negative moral findings, and by the absence of legal violations. Positive evidence of good moral character can include letters of reccomendation, pursuing education, working seven days a week, owning one’s home, attending church every Sunday, marrying one’s high-school sweetheart, having strong ties to one’s nuclear family, coaching little league teams, teaching English above all other languages in one’s home, paying taxes, paying bills on time, and volunteering in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=MENDELSON |first1=MARGOT K. |title=Constructing America: Mythmaking in U.S. Immigration Courts |journal=The Yale Law Journal |date=2010 |volume=119 |issue=5 |pages=1012–1058 |jstor=20698316}}&lt;/ref&gt; If one volunteers to help others, they may be considered a better person if something bad, uncontrollable, and unexpected happens to them while they are working. For example, a man who was stung by a bee while mowing the lawn for an elderly neighbor would often be rated as having a better moral character than a similar man who was not stung by a bee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=From incidental harms to moral elevation: The positive effect of experiencing unintentional, uncontrollable, and unavoidable harms on perceived moral character |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |date=1 November 2017 |volume=73 |pages=86–96 |doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2017.06.016 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103116306977 |language=en |issn=0022-1031|last1=Schaumberg |first1=Rebecca L. |last2=Mullen |first2=Elizabeth }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative findings of moral character can include having children without being married, not paying taxes, receiving government support, and advocating for racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Billy |first1=Jason |title=Confronting Racists at the Bar: Matthew Hale, Moral Character, and Regulating the Marketplace of Ideas |journal=Harvard Blackletter Law Journal |date=2006 |volume=22 |url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/hblj22&amp;div=5&amp;id=&amp;page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of any negative finding can outweigh several positive findings.

==In immigration law==
Even minor violations of the law can be the sole reason for denying citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seattlepi.com/local/172675_suit10.html One mistake robs man of citizenship&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] describes "good moral character" as an absence of involvement in the following activities:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://careers.findlaw.com/firmsite/attachments/LE6_c_checklist_WhatIsGoodMoralCharacter.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127043144/http://careers.findlaw.com/firmsite/attachments/LE6_c_checklist_WhatIsGoodMoralCharacter.pdf |archivedate=2007-11-27 |df= }} What is good moral character?&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the practice of medicine==
A 1975 survey by Camenisch included responses from 19 state medical board presidents (respondents) wherein they placed eight characteristics of good moral character in order of importance from most-to-least.

Camenisch writes, “The grouping of the eight elements in the order of importance makes it clear that ‘good moral character’ in the minds of the respondents emphatically has more to do with the professional's obligations to a limited number of specific individuals, to his patients, than to the society at large, to the entire population of those needing health care... this second area ... includes such matters as the distribution of health care and the mode and ease of patient access to it. ... this low ranking of societal issues and responsibilities is of special interest in light of the fact that these same respondents, when asked to indicate the major differences between professional and other occupational licensing, gave highest place to ‘the degree of dedication to the public well-being expected of the licensee.’”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Camenisch |first1=PF |title=On the matter of good moral character. |journal=The Linacre Quarterly |date=August 1978 |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=273–83 |pmid=11661606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hans Graf von Sponeck''' (12 February 1888 – 23 July 1944) was a German general during [[World War II]] who was imprisoned for disobeying orders and later executed.

== Pre-World War II career ==
Sponeck was born in 1888 in [[Düsseldorf]]. He received a military education and was commissioned as an officer in 1908. He married in 1910 and had two sons by this marriage. He served in [[World War I]] as a battalion adjutant.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Between 1924 and 1934, he served on the General Staff HQ and later, as full colonel, commanded an infantry regiment at [[Neustrelitz]]. In 1925, Sponeck was admitted to the [[Order of Saint John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg)]] as a Knight of Honor.&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Clark, Jr. (2003). ''The Evangelical Knights of Saint John''. p. 46. {{ISBN|978-0972698900}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sponeck commanded Infantry Regiment 48 at [[Dallgow-Döberitz|Döberitz]] until late 1937 when he transferred to the [[Luftwaffe]] to establish [[paratrooper]] units. During the course of the [[Blomberg–Fritsch Affair]], Sponeck was recalled by contemporaries as having suggested his willingness to lead his troops in support of army commander-in-chief [[Werner von Fritsch]] if called to do so,&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch, Harold (1974). ''Hitler and His Generals: The Hidden Crisis, January - June 1938''. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press. p 248. {{ISBN|978-0816606498}}.&lt;/ref&gt; though no such plan ever came to fruition.

During the trial of General von Fritsch, Sponeck was called as a character witness but was roughly put down by Göring, who was serving as Court President. Nevertheless, Sponeck became commander of the 22nd Infantry Division with 42nd Army Corps training the troops as airborne infantry (''[[Fallschirmjäger]]'').

==Second World War==
On 1 February 1940, Sponeck was promoted to [[General (Germany)|Generalleutnant]].&lt;ref name=felgrau1&gt;{{cite web |last=Pipes |first=Jason |title=Hans Graf von Sponeck |url=http://www.feldgrau.com/search-officers2.php?ID=1960 |work=feldgrau.com |accessdate=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German airborne assault on the [[Low Countries]] began on 10 May 1940, led by Sponeck and General [[Kurt Student]]. Sponeck led the German troops in the failed [[Battle for The Hague]] and was almost captured, only to be saved by the [[Rotterdam Blitz|bombardment of Rotterdam]] on the 14 May 1940 which quickly led to the Dutch capitulation. He was wounded, and on his return to Germany was further awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] by [[Adolf Hitler]].

===Invasion of the Soviet Union===
Before dawn on 22 June 1941, [[Operation Barbarossa]] was launched beginning the German invasion of the [[Soviet Union]]. Sponeck commanded the [[22nd Infantry Division (Germany)|22nd Infantry Division]] as part of the [[11th Army (Wehrmacht)|11th Army]] in the area of [[Army Group South]] attacking in the direction of the [[Crimea|Crimean Peninsula]]. Two days before the invasion, on 20 June 1941, Sponeck's general staff gave orders to the division that any Jewish Red Army prisoners of war should be identified and separated from the rest of the Soviet prisoners.{{sfn|Grimmer-Solem|2013|pp=28-9}} With the start of the invasion, Sponeck's division operated from the Romanian frontier driving into [[Bessarabia]], and then to the southern [[Ukraine]]. In preparation for the invasion of Crimea, Sponeck's division was ordered in September and early October 1941 to attack east and north along the [[Sea of Azov]] to the cities of [[Henichesk]], [[Melitopol]] and [[Berdiansk]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

On 7 October 1941 Sponeck ordered his division to work closely with the SS's Security Police and [[Sicherheitsdienst]] (SD) by rounding up, identifying, and handing over Jewish civilians. Mass shootings of Jews by units of [[Einsatzgruppe]] D of the Security Police and SD are documented in both Henichesk and Melitopol shortly after these cities were occupied by the 22nd Infantry Division in October 1941. In Melitopol alone 2,000 Jewish men, women and children were massacred.{{sfn|Grimmer-Solem|2013|pp=34-9}} In later English captivity at Trent Park, one of General von Sponeck's subordinate senior officers, Colonel (later General) [[Dietrich von Choltitz]], admitted frankly in a surreptitiously recorded conversation that he had taken an active part in the work of killing Jews during the German invasion of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Neitzel, Sönke (2005). ''Abgehört'': ''Deutsche Generäle in britischer Kriegsgefangenschaft 1942–1945''. Berlin: Propyläen. p. 258. {{ISBN|978-3549072615}} (in German).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Because of sciatica and intestinal trouble, General von Sponeck took sick leave from his division on 14 October 1941. On Sponeck's return on 3 December 1941 [[Erich von Manstein|Manstein]] gave him command of the XLII Army Corps (with command of the [[46th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|46th Infantry Division]]), which had taken the [[Kerch Peninsula]] on the extreme eastern tip of Crimea. In [[Feodosia]], within the area of Sponeck's command, 1,052 Jews were murdered on or around 10 December 1941 by units of [[Einsatzgruppe]] D with the active cooperation and participation of the local military field commander and military police. On 10 December 1941 General von Sponeck ordered that all Jews found within his area of command were to be treated in principle as "partisans", marked with the Star of David, and "deployed as labor." He also ordered that any Red Army soldiers captured, even those in uniform, were to be shot immediately and approved reprisal actions against civilians for any local anti-German activity or sabotage.{{sfn|Grimmer-Solem|2013|pp=44-5}} Historian Erik Grimmer-Solem remarks: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The case of General von Sponeck is complicated. He had the moral courage to refuse an order from Hitler to stand his ground when his troops were threatened with destruction, and he was court-martialed and later killed by the Nazis for it. At the same time, he did not refuse to carry out the criminal [[Commissar Order]], which gave cover for what became a genocidal war against ‘Jewish Bolshevism’ in the Soviet Union.  While von Sponeck was not a Nazi in the technical sense and was himself even critical of some aspects of the regime, his orders and the actions of his troops leave no doubt that he had internalized anti-Semitic racism. Sponeck shows that it was not necessary to be an ideologically-driven Nazi to carry out the Nazi regime’s policy of mass murder. Under Nazism and in conditions of war, the lines between victim and perpetrator, between hero and follower could dissolve within a single person.”{{sfn|Rubenstein|2014}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On 26 December 1941, the Soviet forces landed on [[Kerch]], and on 30 December executed another landing near [[Feodosiya]] with two armies. The operation was to drive to Sevastopol and relieve the garrison, now encircled by the German 11th Army.&lt;ref&gt;Glantz and House 1995, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; The 46th Division was the only division in a position to be able to block the Soviet advance. Manstein believed it could contain the landing, but the Soviets consolidated their bridgeheads and defeated the attacking Romanian brigades. As a result, Sponeck, as the XLII Corps commander, chose to withdraw the division from Kerch through the Parpach narrows to avoid being caught and encircled by Soviet forces advancing from the landing zones located at the extreme east (Kerch) and west (Feodosiya) of the peninsula.

===Trial, imprisonment and execution===
[[File:StolpersteinSponeck.jpg|thumb|upright|Memorial block in Bremen; removed in 2015 because of Sponeck's role in the [[Holocaust]] and other atrocities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grimmer-Solem|2013|pp=28–9}};{{harvnb|Grimmer-Solem|2013|pp=34–9}};{{harvnb|Grimmer-Solem|2013|pp=44–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
On 23 January 1942, Sponeck was tried in front of the Court President [[Hermann Göring]] where he maintained that he had acted against orders, on his own initiative, in order to avoid the destruction of his division. He was found guilty of disobedience to a superior officer and given the death sentence. Adolf Hitler (on Manstein's proposal) commuted the sentence to seven years in prison. Sponeck was to serve as an example to those who disobeyed Hitler's new order not to retreat. Sponeck was imprisoned in the [[Germersheim]] Fortress.

Following the [[20 July plot|20 July failed attempt]] to assassinate Hitler, [[Josef Bürckel]], ''Gauleiter'' of [[Gau Westmark]] where Germersheim was located, pressed [[Heinrich Himmler]], who was the Reich's Security Official, to have Sponeck executed in retribution for the assassination plot, even though the latter had no contact with the German military resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Wettstein, Lothar (2010). ''Josef Bürckel: Gauleiter Reichsstatthalter Krisenmanager Adolf Hitlers'', 2nd ed. Norderstedt: Books on Demand. pp. 538–540. {{ISBN|978-3839117613}} (in German).&lt;/ref&gt; Sponeck was executed on 23 July 1944.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Sponeck was buried in Germersheim and no citations or speeches were permitted at his grave. After the war, Sponeck's remains were transferred to the Soldiers' Cemetery at [[Dahn]] in the [[Palatinate Forest]].

After the war, Sponeck has been commemorated in Germany, with an Air Force base in Germersheim, streets and monuments named after him. However, in 2015, following the publication of an article by Erik Grimmer-Solem published in 2014 in the journal Militärgeschichtliche Zeitschrift, which investigate Sponeck's role in  "numerous war crimes and crimes against humanity in the southern Ukraine and Crimea in 1941," despite civil protests in Germersheim,  the German Federal Airforce, in accordance with the German Government's and the Bundestag's decisions,  renamed the Sponeck Airbase ("General-Hans-Graf-Sponeck-Kaserne") "Südpfalz-Kaserne."{{sfn|Rubenstein|2014}}{{sfn|Danisch|2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2229">'''Industrial arbitration''' is a type of [[arbitration]] to prevent or settle labor disputes that may arise between an industrial employer and a [[organized labor|union]], union member, or union representative to prevent legal action taking place and finding less costly ways to settle disputes.  

Taking an issue to court or a breakdown of negotiations can be dangerous for both management and labor, and as such parties are often willing to negotiate and plead their cases with a third party arbiter to come to fair decisions.  Industrial arbitration refers to this process taking place in which labor and management will sit down and solve a dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

This process often benefits the employer because it reduces the chances of a strike or legal action, and benefits the employee because it allows them more bargaining power and prevents mass layoffs in a dispute.  However, at times the government has been known to step in regardless of arbitration clauses and force its own remedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{Politics of China |expanded = Law }}

'''Law of the People's Republic of China''', officially referred to as the '''Socialist legal system [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics|with Chinese characteristics]]''', is the legal regime of [[China]], with the separate legal traditions and systems of [[Mainland China]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Macau]].

Between 1954 and 1978, there was not very much effort within China to create a legal system.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} The Communist leadership led by [[Mao Zedong]] believed that creating a legal system would restrict the power of the [[Communist Party of China]] and create elites which would ultimately harm the socialist revolution.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

This policy was changed in 1979, and China has formed an increasingly sophisticated legal system.  China's legal system is largely a [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system, reflecting the influence of [[Continental Europe]]an legal systems, especially the [[Law of Germany|German civil law system]] in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

On the other hand, [[Hong Kong]] still retains the [[common law]] system inherited as a former British colony, and [[Macau]] employs a legal system based on that of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]]. This is part of the [[One Country, Two Systems]] theory.  They have their own [[court of final appeal|courts of final appeal]] and [[extradition]] policies.  As such, respectively, they are not within the jurisdiction of the court system within China, which is only effective within mainland China, but their respective [[Basic law|Basic Laws]] are subject to interpretation by the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]].

== History ==
{{Main article|Traditional Chinese law|Legal history of China}}

China has a tradition of adopting civil law systems. During the Qing Dynasty, in order to modernise the Chinese legal system, the Chinese government hired Japanese legal experts to copy legal systems from Japan, which stemmed from the German civil law system.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/China.htm&lt;/ref&gt; After the establishment of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] in 1911, the Chinese government maintained the civil law system. Although the CCP abolished all legal systems of the ROC after 1949, its legal system was deeply influenced by the legal system of the [[Soviet Union]], which could also be regarded as a civil law system.{{Clarify|date=March 2008}}

The development of the current legal system dates from the late 1970s, after the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. After more than 30 years of endeavour, the People's Republic of China has established, through enactments by the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee, a rather complete legal system with constitution, civil and commercial law, criminal law, administrative law, economic law, procedural law, etc.

In the 2000s, the [[Weiquan movement]] began in the PRC, seeking to advance citizens' rights partly by petitioning for enforcement of existing laws, and partly through activism.  Lawyers in the movement have seen some court victories, but in other cases they and their families have been ostracized and even tortured for their activities.

== Sources of law ==
The highest and ultimate source of legal norms in the PRC is nominally the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]]. It establishes the framework and principles of government, and lists the fundamental rights and duties of Chinese citizens.  In practice, however, although these "fundamental rights" include "freedom of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of procession and of demonstration" the enforcement of these rights and other elements of the Constitution are subject to the discretion of the Communist Party's leadership.

Unlike some civil law jurisdictions such as [[Germany]], China does not systematically lay down general principles in its constitution which all administrative regulations and rules must follow.  The principles of legislation and the validity and priority of law, rule and administrative regulations are instead listed in the  [[Legislation Law of the People's Republic of China|Legislation Law]], constitutional provisions, basic laws and laws enacted by the [[National People's Congress]] and its standing committee, regulations issued by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] and its departments, local laws and regulations, autonomous-zone regulations, legal explanations and treaty norms are all in theory incorporated into domestic law immediately upon promulgation.

Signed international treaties are in practice automatically incorporated into PRC law, and they are superior to the relevant stipulations of PRC laws. However, the PRC reserves the right to make reservations regarding provisions of a treaty.

Unlike [[common law]] jurisdictions, there is no strict precedential concept for case law and no principle of ''[[stare decisis]]''. In addition, there is no [[case or controversy]] requirement that would require the [[Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China|Supreme People's Court]] to limit its decisions to actual cases, and the SPC does issue general interpretations of the law.  In practice, lower people's court judges attempt to follow the interpretations of the laws decided by the [[Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China|Supreme People's Court]]. In addition, unlike common law jurisdictions, higher courts have the power of supervision and guidance, which means that on their own initiative they can reopen a case that has been decided at a lower level.

Courts in the PRC do not have a general power of [[judicial review]] which enables them to strike down legislation.  However under the [[Administrative Procedure Law of the People's Republic of China]], they do have authority to invalidate specific acts of the government.  In cases where there is a conflict of laws, the process to resolve this conflict is outlined in the [[Legislation Law of the People's Republic of China]], in which an interpretation is requested by the legislative body that is responsible for the law.  This process has been criticized both by Western and Chinese legal scholars for being unwieldy and for not allowing for [[judicial independence]] and [[separation of powers]].  At the same time, the counterargument has been made that resolving legal conflicts is primarily a legislative activity and not a judicial one.

Finally, courts outside of the special autonomous regions, including the [[Supreme People's Court]], do not have jurisdiction over the Hong Kong and Macau SAR's; although, the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] does have and has used its authority to interpret the [[Basic Law of Hong Kong]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

== Varieties of law ==

PRC governmental directives exist in a hierarchy, which is defined by the [[Legislation Law of the People's Republic of China]].  The hierarchy of regulations are

# The [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]]
# National laws (国家法律 ''guójiā fǎlǜ''), which are issued by the [[National People's Congress]]
# Administrative regulations, which are issued by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]]
# Local decrees, which are issued by local People's Congresses
# Administrative and local rules, which are issued by an administrative agency or by a local People's Government

Major areas of law are substantive laws and procedural laws. The former include [[administrative law]], [[criminal law]], civil law or [[business law]], and [[economic law]]. These are separated into different branches. For example, [[contract law]] is considered a branch of civil law. The latter includes [[civil procedure law]], [[criminal procedure law]] and [[administrative procedure law]].

===Civil law and Civil Procedure Law===
In 1986 the [[National People's Congress]] adopted the [[General Principles of the Civil Law of the People's Republic of China]], which helped clarify the scope of the civil law. Article 2 of the document states that the civil law governs personal and property relationships between natural persons and legal persons having equal status. It covers a wide range of topics, including the General Principles, [[marriage law]], [[property law]], [[contract law]], [[copyright law]], and [[trademark law]]. From the point of view of some scholars, business law, such as [[corporation law]], [[bankruptcy law]], [[insurance law]], and law on [[negotiable instruments]], is distinguished from civil law.

In contrast to other civil law jurisdictions, the PRC has not yet consolidated its civil law into a single [[Codification (law)|code]]. However, the legislative plan is to enact the branches of civil law as separate legislation in the first place and then consolidate them into an entire Civil Code. The National People's Congress has so far promulgated Marriage Law, Adoption Law, Succession Law, Patent Law, Copyright Law, Contract Law, Law of Rights in Rem, Law of Tort Liability.The latest enactment is the Law of the People’s Republic of China on the Laws Applicable to Foreign-related Civil Relations adopted on 28 October 2010.The first part of the future Civil Code would be General Provisions which will be based on the current General Principles of Civil Law adopted in 1986.

Civil procedural law advocates the principle of 'open trial' - a system in which the second instance is the final hearing, although a trial supervision system exists in civil litigation which will allow a limited number of cases being tried by the third instance. Enforcing judgments can prove particularly difficult.

===Criminal law and Criminal Procedure Law===

====Criminal Law====

China's first post-1949 substantive and procedural Criminal Code was enacted in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome A. Cohen, "Chinese Criminal Code Symposium, Foreword-China's Criminal Codes", 1982 72(1) Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology, 135 at: http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6291&amp;context=jclc&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1979 Code followed the release of a new Constitution in 1978, and the fall of the 'Gang of Four' in 1976.

The present Criminal Code, ''The Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China'' (中华人民共和国刑法) is the product of extensive revisions, most recently on August 29, 2015 (the 9th Amendment) which incorporated new offences pertaining to cyber crime, terrorism and false/vexatious litigation as well as the removal of the death penalty for certain smuggling, fraud and counterfeiting offences.&lt;ref&gt;China Law Translate, ""It’s a crime, I tell ya: Major Changes in China’s Criminal Law Amendment 9" at: http://chinalawtranslate.com/its-a-crime-i-tell-ya-major-changes-in-chinas-criminal-law-ammendment-9/?lang=en#AoRI7xsVbDJo6VqV.99&lt;/ref&gt;

Noteworthy features of criminal law in China include the requirement that crimes and criminal sanctions may only be governed by national laws (as opposed to provincial laws or ministerial regulations).  This rule is set out in Article 8 of the Legislation Law of the People's Republic of China (中华人民共和国立法法).

The harshness of criminal law in China is under heavy criticism or strong support, especially the insistence on [[capital punishment]] for many crimes. China accounts for the biggest number of criminals executed in the world per year, which has raised great concern among different human rights groups and international organizations.

====Criminal Procedure Law====

The Criminal Procedure Law of China (中华人民共和国刑事诉讼法) provides for all phases of the ''criminal'' process.  This is distinct from the system of administrative punishments (including detention for periods of multiple years) and procedures which are governed under a separate system of laws and regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Biddulph, "Punishments in the Post Re-Education Through Labour World: Questions About Minor Crime in China" (2015) University of Melbourne Legal Studies Research Paper (No. 79) at https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2664864&lt;/ref&gt;  The criminal procedure law governs the conduct of investigations, including pre-trial detention, interrogation, surveillance, prosecution (by an institution called the "procuratorate") and the conduct of trials/the defense of the accused.&lt;ref&gt;Jianfu Chen, "Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure Law in the People's Republic of China" (2013) at https://books.google.com/books?id=PlStoNNKha0C&amp;lpg=PP7&amp;dq=jianfu%20chen%20criminal%20law%20and%20procedure&amp;pg=PP7#v=onepage&amp;q=jianfu%20chen%20criminal%20law%20and%20procedure&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; However, the independence of the courts and institutions involved in the investigation, prosecution and trial of criminal offences in China remains challenged by the structure of the PRC's government and its organs. One example of the structural barriers to the independence of courts is the Chinese Communist Party political-legal committee system, by which "the Party has the power to instruct, monitor or scrutinize courts regarding specific decisions of individual cases or categories of cases that attract attention from the Party."&lt;ref&gt;Ling Li, "The Chinese Communist Party and People’s Courts: Judicial Dependence in China" (2016) 64(1) American Journal of Comparative Law, at 28 at https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2551014&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Administrative law and Administrative Procedure Law ===
The [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] is authorized to promulgate administrative regulations, on social and economic sectors and affairs consistent with the laws adopted by the NPC and its Standing Committee. These laws include [[environmental protection law]], regulations on taxation and customs, [[product quality law]], and so on. In these areas, the central government and its organs are superior to other parties, such as enterprises and individuals, for they exercise the power of regulation.

The ''[[Administrative Procedure Law of the People's Republic of China]]'' (1989) allows legal persons to bring legal challenges against administrative actions. The types of administrative actions that can be challenged must be "concrete actions", which include: administrative punishments (such as detentions and fines), administrative coercive measures, interference with the operations of enterprises, refusal to take action or perform an obligation, unlawful demands for performance of duties, and violations of rights of the person or property rights. The review of state action is carried out in the local people's court.  Court review of agency action is not permitted for state action involving national defense or foreign affairs. Moreover, the court cannot review administrative legislation.

As a matter of fact, although administrative litigation involving governments is on the rise due to citizens using legal measures to protect their property from government violation, it is still quite difficult for the court to give fair judgements or efficient execution, as the court's judges are appointed by the Communist Party and finance comes from the government.

== Lawmaking and legislative authority ==
There are two types of organs that are empowered to make legislative enactments. The first is referred to as "state-power organs" (国家权力机关), which take the form of the National People's Congress, its standing committee and local peoples' congresses of provinces, municipalities, and "metropolitans having some degree of autonomy" as designated by the State Council. Certain administrative organs (行政机关)—that is, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]], its departments and commissions, and local people's governments at the same level as the local people's congresses mentioned above, including the governments of provincial capitals—also have the power to make administrative rules and regulations under certain conditions.

In theory, legislation issued by administrative organs is subordinate to that issued by state-power organs. Enactments of administrative organs must not conflict with the Constitution or law. In addition, local people's governments must ensure that their enactments comply with those issued by the State Council and its subordinate departments.

The concept of delegation of power has yet to be fully developed in the PRC legal system. For example, because it is not customary to expressly delegate power to administrative bodies to issue specific regulatory documents, they are not drafted pursuant to any specific entrustment of power in the manner of a statutory authorization of the enactment of implementing regulations.

In drafting the new laws, the PRC has declined to copy any other legal system wholesale, and the general pattern has been to issue laws for a specific topic or location.  Often laws are drafted on a trial basis, with the law being redrafted after several years.  This process of creating a legal infrastructure piecemeal has led to judicial decisions having more precedential value than in most civil law jurisdictions.  In formulating laws, the PRC has been influenced by a number of sources, including traditional Chinese views toward the role of law, the PRC's socialist background, the German-based law of the Republic of China on [[Taiwan]], and the English-based common law used in Hong Kong.

The law of the [[United States]] has also been very influential particularly in the area of banking and securities law.  Specifically, China has copied the separation between investment banking, commercial banking, and insurance, even after those walls were abolished in the United States, and large sections of the [[Securities Law of the People’s Republic of China]] have incorporated in legislation concepts copied from American securities law.

== National People's Congress ==
The highest legislative authority is the [[National People's Congress]]. It has the power to revise the Constitution and create major legal codes referred to as "basic laws" (基本法律 ''jīběn fǎlǜ''). Apart from this, the NPC also enacts laws (法 ''fǎ'') and decision (决定 ''juédìng''). Decisions may contain legal norms in the form of amendments or supplements to laws. They are often used to delegate lawmaking authority to the State Council.

The nature of the selection delegates to the NPC has meant that popular input into lawmaking at this level is very limited. Because the delegates range from different fields and backgrounds, only some of them are legal professionals or practitioners. Without any formal legal education or knowledge, few of the delegates can make suggestions or give opinions on legislation. Thus, a fairly wide cross-section of the party and government at both central and local levels is given the opportunity to produce input. The NPC Legislative Affairs Commission (法制工作委员会 ''fǎzhìgōngzuò wěiyuánhuì'') is the key organ that are responsible for the law drafting work. Since the 1990s, scholars and experts are increasingly entrusted by the NPC Legislative Affairs Commission to form drafting groups to prepare the first draft of the basic laws (this was the case for the Contract Law (1999), the Law of Rights ''in rem'' (2007), the Law of Tort Liability (2009) and the Law of the PRC on the Law Applicable to Foreign-related Civil Relations (2010)). The act of legislating is to some extent a game of interest groups.

=== The State Council ===
The next tier of the PRC's legislative hierarchy—the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]]—is also elected by the NPC and is head of the nation's executive. It is empowered under Article 89 of the Constitution to "adopt administrative measures (办法 ''bànfǎ''), enact administrative regulations (行政法规 ''xíngzhèng fǎguī'') and issue decisions (决定 ''juédìng'') and orders (命令 ''mìnglìng'') in accordance with the Constitution and statutes." The State Council Legislative Affairs Office (国务院法制办 ''guówùyuàn fǎzhì bàn'') is mainly responsible for the drafting of administrative regulations which are issued for the purpose of implementing laws.

=== Lawmaking at the local level ===
Of the four levels of local administration in China (province, region/prefecture, county/district, township), only the provincial level possesses real lawmaking power. The Organic Law of Local People's Congresses and Local People's Governments allows congresses at the provincial, municipal, provincial capital and "quite big city" levels to enact their own regulations, called local regulations (地方性法规 ''dìfāngxìng fǎguì''). Nevertheless, drafts of legislation must be approved by the provincial level congress before they can become law.

== Judiciary ==
[[File:Court system of China.gif|thumb|right|The types of courts in China, and the paths of appeal.]]
{{See also|Court system of the People's Republic of China}}

The judge and prosecutor still are regarded as public servants. It is recognized that the quality of judges and prosecutors are lower than lawyers, but in the major cities, such as the provincial capital cities, the new recruited judges are with higher law degrees than ever before.{{clarify|date=October 2013}} In 2002, the unified [[State Judicial Exam]] (SJE) was introduced, partly to improve the quality of the judiciary. Any person who wants to work as a judge, prosecutor, or become a practicing lawyer or a public notary, will need to pass the SJE to obtain a Certificate of Legal Profession Qualification. Like in courts of imperial times, judges are also inquisitors who question witnesses, but unlike traditional courts, only evidence given in court is taken into account. Parties are permitted to engage agents ''ad litem'' who may be lawyers or any citizen approved by the court. A major concern with the modern court system is bribery of judges resulting from low salaries and financial dependence on local government. Though a great part of disputes that reach the courts still end in mediated rather than adjudicated outcomes, Chinese judges still apply formal laws and follow rules of civil procedure.

Since judges in China normally begin their careers as judges as opposed to first serving as lawyers, they may become judges at an unusually young age relative to most other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Huang Jingjing (25 February 2015), [http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/908863.shtml Intellectual clarity] ''[[The Global Times]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== People's courts ===
Under the ''[[Organic Law of the People's Courts]]'' (1983), judicial power is exercised by the courts at four levels:
* [[basic people's courts]] (基层人民法院 ''jī céng rénmín fǎyuàn''; also called "local" people's courts): Courts at county or district level. Tribunals may also be set up in accordance with local conditions.
* [[intermediate people's courts]]: Prefecture-level courts.
* [[higher people's courts]]: Provincial-level courts.
* the [[Supreme People's Court]] (or National Supreme Court, or Supreme Court)

The highest court in the judicial system is the Supreme People's Court in Beijing, directly responsible to the NPC and its Standing Committee. It supervises the administration of justice by the people's courts at various levels. There is also a Politics and Law Committee in CCP which is in charge of the direction and cooperation of court, procuratorate, police and ensure CCP’s leadership over judicial issues.

Cases are decided within two instances of trial in the people's courts. This means that, from a judgement or order of first instance of a local people's court, a party may bring an appeal only once to the people's court at the next highest level, and the people's procuratorate may protest a court decision to the people's court at the next highest level. However, a limited number civil and commercial cases may, according to the Civil Procedure Law, be heard for the third time, a regime called trial supervision. Additionally, judgments or orders of first instance of the local people's courts at various levels become legally effective if, within the prescribed period for appeal, no party makes an appeal. Any judgments and orders rendered by the  Supreme People's Courts as court of first instance shall become effective immediately.

In accordance with Article 11 of the Organic Law, "the people's courts at all levels shall set up judicial committees within the courts" in order to sum up judicial experience and to discuss important or difficult cases and other issues relating to the judicial works.

=== Professional and special courts ===
Other special courts include military courts, maritime courts and railway courts. The military court, established within the [[People's Liberation Army]], is the relatively closed adjudication institution in charge of hearing criminal cases involving servicemen. The maritime courts are located at the major sea and river port cities. They have jurisdiction over maritime cases and maritime trade cases of first instance. It ranks equivalent to an intermediate court in the judiciary hierarchy. The railway transport court deals with criminal cases and economic disputes relating to railway and transportation.

=== People's procuratorates ===
Under Article 129 of the Constitution, people's procuratories are "the State organs for legal supervision". Its functions are defined by the ''Organic Law of the People's Procuratorates'' (1983).

The [[Supreme People's Procuratorate]] is set up at national level. The local people's procuratorates are divided into three tiers, as with the people's courts. Procuratorial committees are created inside the people's procuratorates at different levels. According to Article 3 of the Organic Law, "the procuratorial committee shall apply the system of democratic centralism and, under the direction of the chief procurator, hold discussions on important cases and other major issues".

The procuratorates are responsible for indict criminal suspects as public prosecutor.

=== Informal mediation ===
Like in imperial times, resolving disputes in China has relied heavily on community [[mediation]] rather than litigation within a formal court system. Although a great number of disputes in China to this day are settled informally through community mediation, legal actions are increasingly resorted nowadays by ordinary people to resolve their disputes. Courts are overburdened in many parts of China (for instance, judges at the Basic People's Court in Chaoyang District and Haidian District in Beijing have an average caseload of 300-400 per year).Traditionally, the emphasis has been on compromise, maintaining social harmony, and establishing order. But unlike previous eras, there existed, notably in the first part of the Communist era, mass show trials and public criticisms to enforce the party line, establish party dominance, and make examples of certain values of society.

After the Communist Party took control, it institutionalized many of the existing informal community mediation systems into the party-state structure. Mediation Committees, staffed by five to eleven community members, were made part of larger Residents’ Committees and charged with settling disputes through peer pressure and conciliation.

The Communists established a formal court system based on the Soviet model following their victory, but ideological conflict between law specialists and cadres caused the system to break down. In the 1952 "[[three anti]]" (sān fǎn) and "[[five anti]]" (wǔ fǎn) movements, mass public trials with crowds of onlookers shouting criticisms resulted in the execution and detention of hundreds of thousands of "counterrevolutionaries" without employing the formal legal system. During the [[Cultural Revolution]], the court system was abolished entirely and laws stopped being enacted. This resulted in community mediation systems taking on more importance. The [[People's Liberation Army]] was put in control of judging cases. [[Red Guard (China)|Red Guard]] brigades often forced individuals to conduct self-criticisms and sent people to reeducation camps for being "reactionaries."

With the [[Chinese economic reform|Deng Xiaoping reforms]] starting at the end of the 1970s, there has been a return to socialist legality. The judicial system has been resumed and a relatively complete legal system has been established through 30 years of legislation effort, despite the overall traditional impression of China in the Western countries. The practice of 1952-1976 related to court has been abandoned. China is now trying to develop a new regime of alternative dispute resolution (ADR).

== Law enforcement ==
{{See also|Law enforcement in the People's Republic of China}}

The [[Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Public Security]] is the principal police authority. It is responsible for maintaining social and public order, and also for conducting investigations and arrest of suspects in criminal cases. It maintains public order in accordance with the administrative power granted by law and through the police force. It can also settle civil disputes between citizens.

The [[People's Armed Police]] is a [[paramilitary]] force which is used in cases of serious disturbances.

The [[Ministry of State Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of State Security]] exists as a counterespionage organ and is also used to monitor and control perceived threats to the government and party.

== Legal profession ==
The Ministry of Justice of PRC governs the prison and [[Laogai]], and it mainly focuses on regulation of the legal profession. Historically the legal profession has been insignificant in the PRC. In the late 1970s, there were no more than a couple of hundred practicing lawyers. Since the 1980s, as China’s leadership became cognizant of the importance of the legal system and legal profession to advance economic development, training for lawyers dramatically increased. From 1986 to 1992, the number of lawyers in the country more than doubled from 21,500 to 45,000,  and by 2008 had reached 143,000.&lt;ref&gt;People's Daily Online. [http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90776/90882/6393774.html "China has more than 143,000 lawyers"], 16 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation was laid by the ''Provisional Law on Lawyering in the PRC'' in 1980. In its early stages, law offices were called "legal counseling services" (法律顾问处 ''fǎlǜ gùwèn chǔ'') and lawyers were regarded as "state legal workers". In 1986, the Chinese National Lawyer's Association was established in Beijing, followed by similar organizations around the rest of China. In the same year, the Ministry of Justice administered a unified national qualification exam for lawyers. This exam was superseded by the State Judicial Exam (SJE) in 2002. Various structures have been experimented within the establishment of law offices.

In May 1996, the ''Lawyers Law'' was enacted by the NPC. It acknowledged the developmental needs of the legal profession. The definition of a lawyer was finally changed from "state legal worker" to "a professional who legally obtains a Lawyer's Certificate and who provides the society with legal services". The law sets forth qualifications for practicing law; outlines a lawyer's professional capacity, rights and duties; rules for [[pro bono]].

At present, there are more than 11,000 law firms in China, staffed by more than 118,000 lawyers. The practice of law has also gradually progressed into new areas such as finance, real estate, and to a lesser extent, [[Weiquan movement|human rights]]. Overall however, the size of the Chinese legal profession is still too small to meet the demands of growth and modernization. Moreover, in sensitive cases, lawyers still cannot play important roles and defend clients in a free way. Some of them were even tried on accusation of perjury as punishment.

Since the PRC's entry into the [[World Trade Organization]], there has been progressive opening up of the legal service sector. A number of foreign law firms have entered the market, mostly specializing in cross-border business transactions, [[mergers and acquisitions]], and [[copyright law]].

As of 2012 an oath pledging loyalty to the leading role of the Communist Party of China is required of new and re-licensed Chinese lawyers:&lt;blockquote&gt;I swear to faithfully fulfill the sacred mission of legal workers in socialism with Chinese characteristics. I swear my loyalty to the motherland, to the people, to uphold the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system, and to protect the dignity of the Constitution and laws.&lt;ref name=NYTOath&gt;{{cite news|title=Chinese Lawyers Chafe at New Oath to Communist Party|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/23/world/asia/chinese-lawyers-chafe-at-new-oath-to-communist-party.html|accessdate=March 23, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 22, 2012|author=Edward Wong}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moj.gov.cn/index/content/2012-03/21/content_3445267.htm?node=7318 司法部下发建立律师宣誓制度决定的通知 进入律师队伍必须进行宣誓] Ministry of Justice, P.R.C. accessed March 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Legal education ==
Over the last two decades, legal education has paralleled the growth of the legal profession. It is one of the most competitive academic disciplines in terms of university and college enrolment, and the number of judicial and legal training institutions continue to grow. The trend has been determined by a strong demand in the market for legal services, and the need to improve the professional quality of judges and prosecutors.

Chinese judicial and legal training facilities are divided into law schools, law universities 
and justice colleges; and specialized judicial and professional training centres.

Approximately 70% of practicing lawyers have university degrees, and 30% only have college diplomas. In March 2002, over 360,000 university or college graduates took part in a two-day State Judicial Exam (SJE). According to a recent report, only 7% passed.

=== University level ===
At present, there are at least 80 law universities or law colleges，and many university-based law schools or law departments in PRC. Historially, the best-known ones are called "the Five Institutes and Four Departments ([[Simplified Chinese]]: 五院四系)". But some of the new law schools established in other top Chinese universities are developing very fast and become the top law schools now.

*"The Five Institutes" are:
**Beijing Institute of Political Science and Law (Simplified Chinese: 北京政法学院), today known as [[China University of Political Science and Law]] (Simplified Chinese: 中国政法大学), in [[Beijing]].
**Southwest Institute of Political Science and Law (Simplified Chinese: 西南政法学院), today known as [[Southwest University of Political Science and Law]] (Simplified Chinese: 西南政法大学), in [[Chongqing]].
**East China Institute of Politics and Law (Simplified Chinese: 华东政法学院), today known as [[East China University of Politics and Law]] (Simplified Chinese: 华东政法大学), in [[Shanghai]].
**South Central Institute of Political Science and Law (Simplified Chinese: 中南政法学院), today known as [[Zhongnan University of Economics and Law]] (Simplified Chinese: 中南财经政法大学), in [[Wuhan]].
**[[Northwest Institute of Political Science and Law]] (Simplified Chinese: 西北政法学院) in [[Xi'an]].
**Since the late 1990s, the above five universities and institutes are no longer administered by the Ministry of Justice. Each university has 500-800 teaching staff and over 5000 law students. Aside from training future lawyers and judges, they provide on-job training programs for those involved with the law.
*And "the Four Departments" are:
**People's University of China Department of Law (Simplified Chinese: 中国人民大学法律系), today known as [[Renmin University of China School of Law]] (Simplified Chinese: 中国人民大学法学院), in Beijing.
**Peking University Department of Law (Simplified Chinese: 北京大学法律系), today known as [[Peking University]] [[Peking University Law School|Law School]] (Simplified Chinese: 北京大学法学院), in Beijing.
**Wuhan University Department of Law (Simplified Chinese: 武汉大学法律系), today known as [[Wuhan University]] [[Wuhan University Law School|Law School]] (Simplified Chinese: 武汉大学法学院), in [[Wuhan]].
**Jilin University Department of Law (Simplified Chinese: 吉林大学法律系), today known as [[Jilin University]] [[Jilin University School of Law|School of Law]] (Simplified Chinese: 吉林大学法学院), in [[Changchun]].

=== College level ===
A feature of the Chinese legal training system is the network of specialized on-job internal training colleges and centers. The Supreme People's Court administers two training institutes: the [[National Judges College]] and the [[SPC Spare-time University]], both located in Beijing. Its trainees are mostly judges or incoming judges. Starting from 2003, however, receiving a diploma from these institutions will no longer be sufficient. Those who want to become a judge need to have a university-level education. There is also a [[National Prosecutors College]], whose trainees are mostly senior prosecutors. These three institutions also have local branches in all the provinces.

A provincial bureau of justice usually manages a justice training centre in a college of justice, which provides college level training for young students or periodic training to practicing lawyers. In addition, there are provincial-level "schools of the administration of political and legal cadres", which provide a legal training program to judges, prosecutors, justice officials and practicing lawyers.

In addition, the national broadcaster [[China Central Television|CCTV]] runs a "[[Television University]]" which has a long-distance college-level law program. At the provincial level, there are post-secondary justice colleges or junior colleges, which provide legal education mostly to junior supporting staff in legal institutions.

== Legal reasoning ==
In China, laws are usually broadly drafted with much discretion left to implementing authorities. Some laws in the PRC have amounted to little more than statements of principle. Real clarity exists only at the level of administrative rules, circulars or bylaws.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

== Implementation of law ==
=== Equality and justice ===
Since 1978, the government has departed significantly from its focus on class status, and replaced it with a qualified presumption of equality. The principle of legal equality is enshrined in basic laws such as the Economic Contract Law (1982), which provides that contracting parties enjoy equal rights, the General Principles of Civil Law (1987), which ascribes various rights universally to all natural persons, and the Administrative Litigation Law (1989), which allows any citizen to file suit against administrative agencies. However, the doctrine does not extend to the right of labour to engage in [[collective bargaining]] or [[strike action]].

The PRC constitution and laws provide principles for fundamental human rights, but there is general agreement, even among members of the government, that many of these rights are just in principle not fully implemented.  There is, however, considerable disagreement over which rights require the most attention and how the PRC should address these deficiencies.  In particular, the Chinese government tends to argue that major improvements in China's human rights record can be made within the context of leadership of the Communist Party of China, while many both in China and outside of the government argue that any real improvement is impossible without fundamental changes in the political system.
(See [[human rights in the People's Republic of China]])

The expansion of the legal profession has been beneficial for [[legal awareness]]. As of 2002, there have been established 2,156 [[legal aid]] centres staffed by over 7000 full-time legal professionals. According to the Ministry of Justice, this system will continue to expand, given that "establishing a legal aid system" is a priority of the Chinese government as outlined by the [[Tenth Five-Year Plan (People's Republic of China)|10th Five-Year Plan]] (adopted April 2002).

=== ''Guanxi'' and corruption ===
P.B. Potter suggests that personal, client and familial relationships (often called ''[[guanxi]]'') override the concept of legal equality and justice in civil and economic relationships. His conclusion is that basic regime tenets of legality are not being assimilated. ''Guanxi'' contacts are exploited in order to surmount institutional barriers. The influence of these extra-legal norms harm the impartiality of administrative bodies as well as the judicial system. In some cases, strong feelings of localism cause local courts to refuse to cooperate in enforcing awards, even when the award has been made by an arbitration body in Beijing.  However, this negative view of guanxi is not universal, Schramm and Taube argue that guanxi has personalistic systems of social relationships have positive elements in producing [[social capital]] and that personalistic norms can co-exist with impersonal legalistic ones.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

== Hong Kong and Macau ==
The legal systems of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Macau Special Administrative Region are excepted from the legal framework of Mainland China by the doctrine of "one country, two systems" established by [[Deng Xiaoping]]. The NPC of the PRC enacted the ''[[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR]]'' (April 1990) and ''[[Macau Basic Law|Basic Law of Macau SAR]]'' (March 1993) to ensure state sovereignty and at the same time the special economic position of those two regions. Since both statutes are national laws, no local laws, including ordinances, administrative regulations and other normative documents, can violate the Basic Law.

The Basic Law of both regions states that the existing capitalist system and the people's way of life shall remain unchanged for at least 50 years, and the laws previously in force shall be maintained. In [[Hong Kong]], the legal system is based on [[England|English]] [[Common Law]] and [[Macau]] based on [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]].

Efforts to change government policies on [[euthanasia]] of humans in the 20th and 21st centuries have met limited success in [[Western world|Western countries]]. Human euthanasia policies have also been developed by a variety of [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]], most notably medical associations and advocacy organizations. {{As of|2018|March}}, active human euthanasia is legal in the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Colombia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Minsalud deja en firme la resolución con protocolo de eutanasia | date = April 2015 | url = http://www.eltiempo.com/estilo-de-vida/salud/eutanasia-en-colombia-minsalud-expide-protocolo-para-muerte-digna-en-el-pais/15606475 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luxembourg]], and [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/AnnualStatutes/2016_3/FullText.html|title=Medical Assistance in Dying Bill|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Canada's Justice Laws Website|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argentina===

On 9 May 2012, the [[Argentine Senate]] turned into law a project that enables to reject treatments that artificially prolong the life of patients with terminal or irreversible symptoms. The consent may be given by the patient or, if not in a position to do so, their relatives or legal representatives. It was promulgated on 24 May 2012 as "Law 26,742".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.lavoz.com.ar/ciudadanos/que-dice-la-ley-de-muerte-digna |title=Qué dice la ley de muerte digna |date=7 July 2015 |work=[[La Voz del Interior]] |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Euthanasia is illegal in [[Australia]], though a law to allow voluntary assisted dying in the Australian state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] will come into effect in mid-2019.&lt;ref name="WORKO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-29/euthanasia-passes-parliament-in-victoria/9205472|title=Euthanasia: Victoria becomes the first Australian state to legalise voluntary assisted dying|work=ABC News|date=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although rare, charges have been laid for 'aiding and abetting' the suicide of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|568|2011|litigants=R v Shirley Justins |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was once legal in the [[Northern Territory]], by the [[Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995]].

During the brief period in which euthanasia was legal in the Northern Territory, Dr. [[Philip Nitschke]] helped three people end their lives through [[assisted suicide]] using his [[Euthanasia device#Deliverance machine|Deliverance machine]]. Organizations such as [[Exit International]] want the government to bring back euthanasia rights to Australia. Exit made TV commercials which were banned before they made it to air in September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/proeuthanasia-tv-ad-ban-a-violation-of-free-speech-20100912-1570f.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age |title=Pro-euthanasia TV ad ban 'a violation of free speech' | first=Cathy | last=Alexander | date=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia however gives patients an Advanced Care Directive option.{{clarify|date=April 2017}}

A survey published in 2010 reported that those who died from euthanasia (compared with other deaths) were more often younger, male, cancer patients and more often died in their homes. In almost all cases, unbearable physical suffering were reported.

In December 2013, the Belgian Senate voted in favour of extending its euthanasia law to terminally ill children.  Conditions imposed on children seeking euthanasia are that "the patient must be conscious of their decision and understand the meaning of euthanasia", "the request must have been approved by the child's parents and medical team", "their illness must be terminal" and "they must be in great pain, with no available treatment to alleviate their distress".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25364745 | work=BBC News | title=Belgian Senate votes to extend euthanasia to children | date=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[psychologist]] must also determine the patient's maturity to make the decision.

In September 2014, the Federal Euthanasia Commission gave convicted rapist and murderer [[Frank Van Den Bleeken]] the right to assisted suicide. Van Den Bleeken had served decades in prison for a 1989 crime and no longer wished to live. Over a dozen other inmates filed similar petitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brussels: Murderer may kill himself|publisher=The Week (page 6)|date=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015, the Justice Ministry acknowledged that Van Den Bleeken's doctors recommended against euthanasia and that alternative psychological care would be sought for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Belgian rapist Van Den Bleeken refused 'right to die'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30699780|accessdate=31 January 2018|agency=BBC News|date=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
{{Main|Euthanasia in Canada}}
Voluntary active euthanasia, called "physician assisted dying", is legal in Canada for all people over the age of 18 who have a terminal illness that has progressed to the point where natural death is "reasonably foreseeable."  To prevent [[suicide tourism]], only people eligible to claim Canadian health insurance may use it.  Legalization of the practice came in 2015/2016 as a result of a series of Supreme Court rulings striking down Canada's ban on medically assisted suicide.  Below is a timeline of events:

On 6 February 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada unanimously ruled in ''[[Carter v Canada (AG)]]'' that Canadian adults who are mentally competent and suffering intolerably and permanently have the right to a doctor's help in dying. The court however suspended its ruling for 12 months to give the government an opportunity to write legislation and draft new laws and policies around assisted dying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/supreme-court-rules-on-doctor-assisted-suicide/article22828437/ | work=The Globe and Mail | first=Sean | last=Fine | title=Canadians have right to doctor-assisted suicide, Supreme Court rules | date=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Carter v. Canada (Attorney General)'', 2015 SCC 5, online at: http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/14637/index.do&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2016 the court granted an additional 4-month extension to its ruling suspension to allow time for the newly elected Liberal government to consult with Canadians on drafting a law to comply with the ruling.  As an interim measure, it also ruled that provincial courts can now begin approving applications for euthanasia until the new law passes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Supreme court gives Parliament 4-month extension on doctor-assisted dying law

A parliamentary committee report tasked with studying the issue in light of the Supreme Court of Canada's ruling recommended that anyone experiencing “intolerable suffering” should be able to seek a doctor’s help to die.  On April 14, 2016, Canada's federal Liberal government introduced legislation to legalize assisted dying under more restrictive conditions than recommended by the committee, allowing access to only those with terminal illnesses for whom death is “reasonably foreseeable”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21697129-seeking-consensus-where-none-exists-canadas-new-doctor-assisted-dying-law-takes-shape|title=Canada’s new doctor-assisted dying law takes shape|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[British Columbia Civil Liberties Association]] argues that the government's assisted dying law is unconstitutional, because it limits access to only those whose death is "reasonably foreseeable", rather than provide access to anybody suffering from a "grievous and irremediable" condition, the definition used by the Supreme Court of Canada in their court ruling that the BCCLA argues would include non-terminal conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/children-of-assisted-death-advocate-kay-carter-urge-amendments-to-liberal-bill-1.2869585|title=Children of assisted-death advocate Kay Carter urge amendments to Liberal bill|date=21 April 2016|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill received considerable multi-partisan opposition within the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]], where it was criticized as being drafted too quickly, and being too restrictive compared with the Supreme Court decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tasker|first1=John Paul|title='Rushed' assisted-dying legislation to face strong opposition in the Senate|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/rushed-assisted-dying-legislation-senate-1.3604005|accessdate=1 June 2016|work=CBC News|date=May 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   As a result, the Senate made a series of amendments to the bill.  The House of Commons accepted all of the amendments made by the Senate except one, which removed the requirement that death be "reasonably foreseeable."

On 17 June 2016, a bill to legally allow assisted suicide within Canada became law after it passed both houses of the [[Parliament of Canada]] and received [[Royal Assent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.her.ie/news/canada-legalises-euthanasia-for-the-terminally-ill/298541|title=Canada legalises euthanasia for the terminally ill - Her.ie|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chile===
Active euthanasia or assisted suicide are not legal in [[Chile]]. Passive euthanasia, however, is legal. Since 2012, the regulation of patients' rights creates the right to informed consent, which allows accepting or refusing any medical treatment. Patients can refuse treatment when they are terminal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ley. Nº 20.584. Regula los derechos y deberes de los pacientes|url=https://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=1039348|publisher=Biblioteca del Congreso Nacional de Chile|accessdate=7 May 2018|language=es|date=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently in 2018, a bill to allow active euthanasia is being discussed by the congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mayoría de Comisión de Salud se inclina por aprobar eutanasia|url=http://www.latercera.com/politica/noticia/mayoria-comision-salud-se-inclina-aprobar-eutanasia/140353/|website=La Tercera|accessdate=7 May 2018|language=es-ES|date=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colombia===
In a 6–3 decision, Colombia's Constitutional Court ruled in 1997 that "no person can be held criminally responsible for taking the life of a terminally ill patient who has given clear authorization to do so," according to the Washington Post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-738421.html|title=Colombia Debates Court Ruling That Legalizes Mercy Killing|date=18 August 1997|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court defined "terminally ill" person as those with diseases such as "cancer, AIDS, and kidney or liver failure if they are terminal and the cause of extreme suffering," the Post reported. The ruling specifically refused to authorize euthanasia for people with degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, or Lou Gehrig's disease. On 15 December 2014, the Constitutional Court had given the [[Ministry of Health and Social Protection (Colombia)|Ministry of Health and Social Protection]] 30 days to publish guidelines for the healthcare sector to use in order to guarantee terminated ill patients, with the wish to undergo euthanasia, their right to a dignified death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elespectador.com/vivir/los-principios-regular-eutanasia-articulo-544675|title=Los principios para regular la eutanasia|publisher=ElEspectador.com|date=19 February 2015|author=Redacción Salud|language=sp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In July 2013, French President [[François Hollande]] stated his personal support for decriminalisation of [[voluntary euthanasia]] in France, which had been one of his presidential campaign promises ("introduction of the right to die with dignity"), despite objections from France's National Consultative Ethics Committee/ [[Comité national consultatif d'éthique]], which alleged "abuses" in adjacent jurisdictions that have decriminalised and regulated either voluntary euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide ([[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Luxembourg]]). More socially conservative members of the [[Catholic Church]] and other major religious groups in France had announced that after expressing an opposition to the introduction of [[same-sex marriage in France]], their next target may be the possible decriminalisation of voluntary euthanasia.&lt;ref&gt;"France aims to allow euthanasia despite ethics doubts": ''TVNZ News'': 02.07.2013: {{cite web |url=http://www.tvnz.co.nz/world-news/france-aims-allow-euthanasia-despite-ethics-doubts-5484055 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130702051822/http://www.tvnz.co.nz/world-news/france-aims-allow-euthanasia-despite-ethics-doubts-5484055 |archivedate=2013-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In  January 2016 both parts of France's parliament approved a measure that, while stopping short of euthanasia, would allow doctors to keep terminal patients sedated until death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/28/france-adopts-sedated-dying-law-as-compromise-on-euthanasia|title=France adopts sedated dying law as compromise on euthanasia|last=Press|first=Associated|date=2016-01-27|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===

In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], it is illegal for a doctor (or anyone) to ''actively'' contribute to someone's death. It is not, however, illegal to remove life support and other treatment (the "right to die") should a person (or their next of kin) request it. A September 2010 Irish Times poll showed that a majority, 57% of adults, believed that doctor-assisted suicide should be legal for terminally ill patients who request it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2010/0917/1224279097037.html The Irish Times (17 September 2010) – ''Majority believe assisted suicide should be legal'']&lt;/ref&gt; Doctors can stop giving a patient life sustaining treatments such as ventilators, feeding tube etc. after being sedated, allowing the patient to die peacefully in their sleep.This only occurs in certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/az/E/Euthanasia-and-assisted-suicide/Alternatives-to-euthanasia-and-assisted-suicide.html|title=Alternatives to euthanasia and assisted suicide - HSE.ie|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
The [[Israel]]i Penal Law forbids causing the death of another and specifically forbids shortening the life of another. Active euthanasia is forbidden by both Israeli law and Jewish law. Passive euthanasia is forbidden by Jewish law but has been accepted in some cases under Israeli law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Euthanasia: The Approach of the Courts in Israel and the Application of Jewish Law Principles|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/euth.html|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, proposals were put forward to allow passive euthanasia to be administered using a switch mechanism similar to [[Sabbath clock]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Butcher|first=Tim|title=Israelis to be allowed euthanasia by machine|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/1505018/Israelis-to-be-allowed-euthanasia-by-machine.html|accessdate=6 January 2012|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=8 December 2005|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the Steinberg Commission was set up to look into whether life and death issues could be rethought in the context of Jewish law, which suggested that hospitals could set up committees to determine whether patients would be given passive euthanasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brody|first=Shlomo|title=Ask the Rabbi: 'Passive euthanasia'|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull&amp;cid=1258624592410|accessdate=6 January 2012|newspaper=Jerusalem Post|date=19 November 2009}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Japan]]ese government has no official laws on the status of euthanasia and the [[Supreme Court of Japan]] has never ruled on the matter.  Rather, to date, Japan's euthanasia policy has been decided by two local court cases, one in [[Nagoya]] in 1962, and another after an incident at [[Tokai University]] in 1995.  The first case involved {{Nihongo|"passive euthanasia"|消極的安楽死|shōkyokuteki anrakushi}} (i.e., allowing a patient to die by turning off life support) and the latter case involved {{Nihongo|"active euthanasia"|積極的安楽死|sekkyokuteki anrakushi}} (e.g., through injection).  The judgments in these cases set forth a legal framework and a set of conditions within which both passive and active euthanasia could be legal. Nevertheless, in both of these particular cases the doctors were found guilty of violating these conditions when taking the lives of their patients.  Further, because the findings of these courts have yet to be upheld at the national level, these precedents are not necessarily binding.  Nevertheless, at present, there is a tentative legal framework for implementing euthanasia in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

In the case of passive euthanasia, three conditions must be met:
# the patient must be suffering from an incurable disease, and in the final stages of the disease from which he/she is unlikely to make a recovery;
# the patient must give express consent to stopping treatment, and this consent must be obtained and preserved prior to death.  If the patient is not able to give clear consent, their consent may be determined from a pre-written document such as a [[living will]] or the testimony of the family;
# the patient may be passively euthanized by stopping medical treatment, chemotherapy, dialysis, artificial respiration, blood transfusion, IV drip, etc.

For active euthanasia, four conditions must be met:
# the patient must be suffering from unbearable physical pain;
# death must be inevitable and drawing near;
# the patient must give consent.  (Unlike passive euthanasia, living wills and family consent will not suffice.)
# the physician must have (ineffectively) exhausted all other measures of pain relief.

The problems that arose from this, in addition to the problem faced by many other families in the country, has led to the creation of "bioethics SWAT teams".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDougall|Gorman|2008|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; These teams will be made available to the families of terminally ill patients in order to help them, along with the doctors, come to a decision based on the personal facts of the case. Though in its early stages and relying on "subsidies from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare" there are plans to create a nonprofit organization to "allow this effort to continue."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDougall|Gorman|2008|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country's parliament passed a bill legalizing euthanasia on 20 February 2008 in the first reading with 30 of 59 votes in favour. On 19 March 2009, the bill passed the second reading, making Luxembourg the third European Union country, after the Netherlands and Belgium, to decriminalise euthanasia. Terminally ill patients will have the option of euthanasia after receiving the approval of two doctors and a panel of experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legilux.public.lu/leg/a/archives/2009/0046/a046.pdf#page=7|title=Mémorial A n° 46 de 2009 - Legilux|website=www.legilux.public.lu|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
{{main|Euthanasia in the Netherlands}}

In the 1973 "Postma case" a physician was convicted for having facilitated the death of her mother following repeated explicit requests for euthanasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rietjens JA, van der Maas PJ, Onwuteaka-Philipsen BD, van Delden JJ, van der Heide A |title=Two Decades of Research on Euthanasia from the Netherlands.

This set of criteria was formalized in the course of a number of court cases during the 1980s.

In 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dutch 'mercy killing law' passed |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1269682.stm |website=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the [[Netherlands]] passed a law legalizing euthanasia including physician-assisted suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The New Regulation of Voluntary Euthanasia and Medically Assisted Suicide in the Netherlands |first=André |last=Janssen |journal=Int J Law Policy Family |year=2002 |volume=16 |issue=2 |pmid=16848072 |pages=260–269 |doi=10.1093/lawfam/16.2.260}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law codifies the twenty-year-old convention of not prosecuting doctors who have committed euthanasia in very specific cases, under very specific circumstances.

===New Zealand===
{{main|Euthanasia in New Zealand}}
Assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia are illegal in [[New Zealand]] under Section 179 of the New Zealand Crimes Act 1961, which renders it a criminal offence to "aid and abet suicide." Two decriminalisation attempts – the Death With Dignity Bill 1995 and the Death With Dignity Bill 2003 – failed, the latter by only a three-vote margin within the New Zealand Parliament. In May 2012, [[Labour Party of New Zealand]] MP Maryan Street introduced a private [[member's bill]] into the ballot box, the End of Life Choices Bill, which was taken over by MP Iain Lees-Galloway when she failed to get re-elected in the 2014 General Election. The bill was dropped in December 2014 at the request of Labour Party leader [[Andrew Little (New Zealand politician)|Andrew Little]] as the issue was deemed to be distracting from bigger issues that concerned the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11374199|title=Labour MP drops euthanasia bill|first=Isaac Davison Political reporter, NZ Herald isaac davison@nzherald co nz|last=@isaac_davison|date=14 December 2014|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2018|via=www.nzherald.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2017, [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] MP David Seymour's [[End of Life Choice Bill]], which will legalise assisted suicide for a select group of people if successful, passed its first reading in Parliament in a 76-44 personal vote and is now being reviewed by a select committee.

===Norway===
Euthanasia remains illegal, though a caregiver may receive a reduced punishment for taking the life of someone who consents to it.&lt;ref name="straffeloven"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lovdata.no/lov/2005-05-20-28/§276| title=Straffeloven 2005|date=2005-05-20| publisher=Criminal Law 2005| accessdate=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peru===
Euthanasia is a delict under the laws of Peru, although there have been some attempts to reform them.

In October 2009, the Reviser Special Commission of the Penal Code of the Parliament expressed its support of a proposal that tried to amend article 112 of the Penal Code, but it did not succeed.

However, at the beginning of 2015, the case of the Chilean woman young Valentina Maureira, who suffered from cystic fibrosis, an incurable disease, and who asked that euthanasia be allowed in her country, attracted the interest of the press of Chile and also of foreign media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://larepublica.pe/01-03-2015/michelle-bachelet-visita-en-el-hospital-a-valentina-la-nina-que-le-pidio-eutanasia| title=Michelle Bachelet visita en el hospital a Valentina, la niña que le pidió eutanasia|date=2015-03-01| publisher=''[[La República]]''| accessdate=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 4 of the same year, the Peruvian legislator Roberto Angulo Álvarez, membership of Dignity and Democracy parliamentary group, motivated by this case, presented a bill that proposed to allow assisted death in case of terminal or degenerative disease, with the objective of "avoid the physical and psychological pains of the patient, as well the unnecessary expenses for the family members and the State". Angulo Álvarez also argued that his legislative project "would contribute to respect for individual freedom and human dignity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diariocorreo.pe/politica/roberto-angulo-presenta-proyecto-de-ley-que-permita-eutanasia-a-pacientes-terminales-569878/| title=Roberto Ángulo presenta proyecto de ley que permita eutanasia a pacientes terminales|date=2015-03-05| publisher='''''Diario Correo'''''| accessdate=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://larepublica.pe/09-03-2015/conoce-mas-acerca-del-proyecto-de-ley-que-propone-legalizar-la-eutanasia-en-el-peru| title=Conozca más sobre el proyecto de ley para legalizar la eutanasia en el Perú|date=2015-03-09| publisher=''[[La República]]''| accessdate=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portugal===
When the issue hit the headlines following a petition calling for euthanasia to be legalised, it rode headlong into controversy: the head of the country’s - right wing - nurses’ association said on a live radio talk show that euthanasia was 'already practised by doctors in the public health system', with the full knowledge of nursing staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portugalresident.com/nursing-chief-claims-portugal-%E2%80%9Calready-practises-euthanasia%E2%80%9D-in-state-hospitals|title=Nursing chief claims Portugal “already practises euthanasia” in state hospitals|first=|last=portugalpress|date=29 February 2016|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the current ‘hot topics’ in Portugal, the deeply divisive issue is the latest point of friction between faith and politics in the traditionally Catholic country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portugalresident.com/parties-to-debate-legalisation-of-euthanasia|title=Parties to debate legalisation of euthanasia|first=|last=portugalpress|date=6 February 2018|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A proposal to make Portugal one of only a handful of countries allowing euthanasia and doctor-assisted suicide was narrowly rejected (115-110 vote) by lawmakers on late May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/portugal-s-parliament-rejects-euthanasia-doctor-assisted-suicide-n878456|title=Euthanasia is rejected by Portugal's parliament|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prodded by a series of left-leaning governments determined to bring about what they called a “modernization” of the country, the Portuguese parliament has in recent years voted to permit abortion on demand and same-sex marriage.

===South Korea===
The [[National Assembly (South Korea)|National Assembly]] and [[Ministry of Health and Welfare (South Korea)|The Ministry of Health and Welfare]] voted in favor of active and passive euthanasia and went into effect since February 2018, and has announced to issue a "Well-Dying" Bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New law enables South Koreans to 'die well'|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/new-law-enables-south-koreans-to-die-well|website=The Straits Times|accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the topic and debate of euthanasia in [[South Korea]] sparked for a long time, starting back in December 4, 1997 when a doctor was sent to prison for a major duration for voluntarily cutting life support of a braindead patient who injured himself from a head trauma upon the request of his wife. This incident is well known in Korea as 'Boramae Hospital Incident' (보라매병원 사건). Another incident that sparked further debate was from the imprisonment of a father who plugged off a respirator for his braindead son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Euthanasia Legal for the Terminally Ill In S.Korea Now|url=http://www.medindia.net/news/euthanasia-legal-for-the-terminally-ill-in-skorea-now-71327-1.htm|website=Med India|publisher=Tanya Thomas|accessdate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports indicate that South Korea has previously legalized passive euthanasia, but maintained the illegality of active suicide as of December 2015, under the name "Death with Dignity" Bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Korea has not legalized euthanasia or assisted suicide|url=https://www.lifesitenews.com/pulse/korean-has-not-legalized-euthanasia-or-assisted-suicide|website=LIFE SITE|publisher=Alex Schadenberg|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patients who qualify for active or passive euthanasia in South Korea are reserved for the terminally ill with a nonexistent chance of recovery. Patients who have a beneficial reaction to any medications, or is not in a rapidly deteriorating state of health leading to imminent death may not be qualified. Patients must have a confirmation of a registered physician and a doctor to die under dignity, and comatose patients must have the approval of both guardians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Korea to Temporarily Allow Terminally Ill Patients to Choose Death with Dignity|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2017/10/23/2017102301468.html|website=조선일보|publisher=Choi Won-woo|accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===
Euthanasia is illegal in the Philippines. In 1997, the [[Philippine Senate]] considered passing a bill legalizing passive euthanasia. The bill met strong opposition from the country's Catholic Church. If legalized the Philippines would have been the first country to legalize euthanasia. Under current laws, doctors assisting a patient to die can be imprisoned and charged with malpractice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2126848/pdf/9193287.pdf | pmc=2126848 | pmid=9193287 | doi=10.1136/bmj.314.7095.1641i | volume=314 | title=Philippines considers euthanasia bill | year=1997 | journal=BMJ | pages=1644 | last1 = Wallerstein | first1 = C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
{{Main|Euthanasia in Switzerland}}
In Switzerland, deadly drugs may be prescribed to a Swiss person or to a foreigner, where the recipient takes an active role in the drug administration.&lt;ref name="CB1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://criminalbrief.com/?p=7887| title=YOUthanasia| last=Lundin|first=Leigh |date=2009-08-02| publisher=Criminal Brief| accessdate=2009-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, article 115 of the Swiss penal code, which came into effect in 1942 (having been written in 1918), considers assisting suicide a crime if and only if the motive is selfish.

===Sweden===
Passive euthanasia was deemed legal after a landmark court ruling in 2010. This means a health care professional can legally cease life support upon request from a patient if they understand the consequences stated by their health care provider, however administering a lethal substance is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sweden allows passive euthanasia|agency=AFP|publisher=The Swedish Wire|date=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
Euthanasia is strictly forbidden in [[Turkey]]. The aide who helped a person to suicide or other ways to kill oneself will be punished for assisting and encouraging suicide under the stipulation of article 84 of the [[Turkish Criminal Law]]. In condition of active euthanasia, article 81 of the same law sets forth that any person who carries out this act will be judged and punished for life imprisonment just like a simple murder.

===United Kingdom===
{{main|Euthanasia in the United Kingdom}}
Active euthanasia is illegal in the [[United Kingdom]]. Any person found to be assisting suicide is breaking the law and can be convicted of assisting suicide or attempting to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suicide Act 1961]] s.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Smartt | first = Ursula | title = Euthanasia and the Law | journal = Criminal Law &amp; Justice Weekly | volume = 173 | issue = 7 | pages = 100 | year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Director of Public Prosecutions has issued guidelines setting out when a prosecution is, or is not, likely to happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/publications/prosecution/assisted_suicide_policy.html|title=Suicide: Policy for Prosecutors in Respect of Cases of Encouraging or Assisting Suicide - The Crown Prosecution Service|website=www.cps.gov.uk|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2003 and 2006 [[Joel Joffe, Baron Joffe|Lord Joffe]] made four attempts to introduce bills that would have legalised voluntary euthanasia – all were rejected by the UK Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/euthanasia/overview/asstdyingbill_1.shtml |title=Assisted Dying Bill – latest |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, [[Nigel Cox (doctor)|Dr Nigel Cox]] is the only British doctor to have been convicted of attempted euthanasia.

In regard to the [[principle of double effect]], in 1957 [[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin|Judge Devlin]] in the trial of [[John Bodkin Adams|Dr John Bodkin Adams]] ruled that causing death through the administration of lethal drugs to a patient, if the intention is solely to alleviate pain, is not considered murder even if death is a potential or even likely outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Margaret Otlowski|title=Voluntary Euthanasia and the Common Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mDvBJ5J4tusC&amp;pg=PA177|year=1997|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-825996-1|pages=175–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{Main|Euthanasia in the United States}}
{{See also|Assisted suicide in the United States}}

Active euthanasia is illegal throughout the [[United States of America|United States]]. Patients retain the rights to refuse medical treatment and to receive appropriate management of pain at their request (passive euthanasia), even if the patients' choices hasten their deaths. Additionally, futile or disproportionately burdensome treatments, such as life-support machines, may be withdrawn under specified circumstances and, under federal law and most state laws only with the informed consent of the patient or, in the event of the incompetence of the patient, with the informed consent of the legal surrogate. The Supreme Court of the United States has not dealt with "quality of life issues" or "futility issues" and appears to only condone active or passive "euthanasia" (not legally defined)  when there is clear and convincing evidence that informed consent to the euthanasia, passive or active,   has been obtained from the competent patient or the legal surrogate of the incompetent patient.

Since 1933 the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150815062616/http://www.parlamento.gub.uy/Codigos/CodigoPenal/Cod_Pen.htm Penal Code of Uruguay], article 37, accept Compassionate Homicide, the first legal document that include euthanasia. It's important to say that this legal document didn't use this denomination. In another article, 127,  the judge could waive the doctor, if this action was made by patient pledge and the doctor had an honorable reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Reta A, Grezzi O. Código penal de la República Oriental del Uruguay. 4th ed. Montevideo: Fundación de Cultura Universitaria; 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The main source of this Penal Code was Jimenéz de Asúa, a Spanish penalist, that introduce this concept in his book "Libertad de amar y derecho a morir: ensayos de un criminalista sobre eugenesia, eutanasia, endocrinología", published in Madrid/Spain, in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Asúa LJ de. Libertad de amar y derecho a morir: ensayos de un criminalista sobre eugenesia, eutanasia, endocrinología. Madrid: Historia Nueva; 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first proposal to understand Euthanasia as homicide was made by Ruy Santos in his MD thesis, "Da resistencia dos estados mórbidos à therapeutica e da incurabilidade perante a euthanásia", at Faculdade de Medicina da Bahia/Brazil, in 1928. He made a difference between Euthanasia as homicide and Euthanasia as suicide, probably the first citation about Assisted Suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Santos R. Da euthanásia nos incuráveis dolorosos.

There are a number of historical studies about the thorough euthanasia-related policies of professional associations. In their analysis, Brody et al. found it necessary to distinguish such topics as euthanasia, physician-assisted suicide, informed consent and refusal, advance directives, pregnant patients, surrogate decision-making (including neonates), DNR orders, irreversible loss of consciousness, quality of life (as a criterion for limiting end-of-life care), withholding and withdrawing intervention, and futility.&lt;ref&gt;Brody, Baruch, McCullough, Rothstein and Bobinski.

BNA Books, 2001{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar distinctions presumably are found outside the U.S., as with the highly contested statements of the British Medical Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doctorsfed.org.uk/content/view/165/39/ On the BMA controversy.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128200523/http://www.doctorsfed.org.uk/content/view/165/39/ |date=2006-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For professional policies in the English-speaking world, see [http://www.euthanasia.com/page17.html this selection by an advocacy NGO.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On euthanasia (narrowly defined here as directly causing death), Brody sums up the U.S. medical NGO arena:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The debate in the ethics literature on euthanasia is just as divided as the debate on physician-assisted suicide, perhaps more so. Slippery-slope arguments are often made, supported by claims about abuse of voluntary euthanasia in the Netherlands.... Arguments against it are based on the integrity of medicine as a profession. In response, autonomy and quality-of-life-base arguments are made in support of euthanasia, underscored by claims that when the only way to relieve a dying patient's pain or suffering is terminal sedation with loss of consciousness, death is a preferable alternative – an argument also made in support of physician-assisted suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Brody et al., p.283&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other NGOs that advocate for and against various euthanasia-related policies are found throughout the world. Among proponents, perhaps the leading NGO is the UK's [[Dignity in Dying]], the successor to the (Voluntary) Euthanasia Society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dignityindying.org.uk Dignity in Dying.] In an unsympathetic account, the International Task Force on Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide has detailed the ebb and flow of euthanasia proponents. http://www.internationaltaskforce.org/rpt2005_I.htm#204 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010142142/http://www.internationaltaskforce.org/rpt2005_I.htm#204 |date=2007-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to professional and religious groups, there are NGOs opposed to euthanasia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euthanasia.com/page10.html|title=Euthanasia suicide mercy-killing right-to-die physician assisted suicide living wills research|website=www.euthanasia.com|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; found in various countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8063">[[File:Leon Petrazycki ii.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Leon Petrazycki]]'''Leon Petrazycki''' ([[Polish Language|Polish]]: Leon Petrażycki; [[Russian Language|Russian]]: Лев Иосифович Петражицкий ''Lev Iosifovich Petrazhitsky''; 13 April 1867 in [[Vitebsk Governorate]]{{spaced ndash}}15 May 1931 in [[Warsaw]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[philosopher]], [[legal scholar]] and [[sociologist]].  He is considered one of the important forerunners of the [[sociology of law]].

== Life ==
Leon Petrażycki was born into the Polish gentry of the Vitebsk Governorate in the [[Russian Empire]]. He graduated from [[Kiev University]] in 1890, spent two years on a scholarship in [[Berlin]] and got his doctorate in 1896 from the University of [[St. Petersburg]]. At the latter university he served from 1897 to 1917 as a professor of the Philosophy of Law.

In 1906 Petrażycki was elected to the ill-fated [[First Duma]] as a member of the [[Constitutional Democratic Party]]. When the legislature was dissolved after a few months, he was convicted and incarcerated for his protests. He was appointed to the Supreme Court of Russia in 1917, but had to flee the country when the [[Bolshevik]] revolution succeeded. He found a new home in [[Poland]] and became the first professor of Sociology at [[Warsaw University]] in 1919.

A prolific writer in several languages and famous lecturer with a large following of students, Petrażycki committed suicide in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Sorokin, Pitirim. 1963. A Long Journey: The Autobiography of Pitirim A. Sorokin. New Haven, Conn., College and University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Petrażycki's contribution to legal sociology and legal theory continues to be debated within various fields of legal research and applied to the study of current legal problems.&lt;ref&gt;On the relevance of Petrażycki's work for legal sociology see Banakar, Reza, "Who Needs the Classics?" 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
Petrażycki published many books in Russian, German, and Polish early in life. Unfortunately, many of his late ideas were preserved only in lecture notes taken by his students. Even in Poland, his work is only partly known.

English speakers still largely rely on a compilation of Petrażycki's writings edited by the Russian-American sociologist [[Nicholas Timasheff|Nicholas S. Timasheff]] in 1955. Despite some recent efforts to introduce and revive his work, it is still largely unknown in the West.

Petrażycki conceives of law as an empirical, psychological phenomenon that can best be studied by introspection. According to him, law takes the form of legal experiences (emotions, impulsions) implying a two-sided relationship between a right on the one hand and a duty on the other hand. If this legal experience refers to normative facts in a broad sense (statutes, court decisions, but also contracts, customs, commands of any sort) he calls it "positive law"; if it lacks such reference, he talks of "intuitive law".

In another conceptualization, he contrasts "official law" (made by the state and its agents) to "unofficial law" (made by societal agents), which brings him close to [[legal pluralism]]. He parallels [[Eugen Ehrlich|Eugen Ehrlich´s]] idea of living law when he states that "the true practice of civil law or any law is not to be found in the courts, but altogether elsewhere. Its practitioners are not judges and advocates, but each individual citizen..." (Petrażycki 1897, as quoted by Motyka)

Petrażycki's theory of law is anti-statist and very critical of the [[legal positivism]] of his time, which he takes to task for being naive and lacking a truly scientific basis because of its focus on norms, rather than the experience of those norms. He also rejects the rather common notion that only human beings can have rights and can therefore be seen as an early proponent of [[animal rights]].

Petrażycki has been called the "unrecognized father of the sociology of law" ([[Adam Podgorecki]] 1980/81). His influence on the sociology of law has been primarily indirect through some of his students, specifically [[Nicholas Timasheff|Nicholas S. Timasheff]], [[Georges Gurvitch]], and [[Pitirim Sorokin]], who each in various ways contributed to formulate a more distinctly sociological perspective, derived from and complementary to Petrażycki's psychological theory.&lt;ref&gt;Deflem, Mathieu. 2008.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10274">The '''Medical Device Radiocommunications Service''' ('''MedRadio''') is a specification and communication spectrum created for and set aside by the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) for the communication needs of diagnostic and therapeutic [[Implant (medicine)|medical implants]] and body-worn [[medical device]]s. Devices operating on MedRadio include [[cardiac pacemaker]]s, [[defibrillator]]s,  [[Microcurrent electrical neuromuscular stimulator|neuromuscular stimulators]], and drug delivery systems.&lt;ref name="FCCMedRadio"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fcc.gov/general/medical-device-radiocommunications-service-medradio |title=Medical Device Radiocommunications Service (MedRadio) |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ElwarOp12"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/325132 |title=Op-Ed: Microchip medicine destroys privacy |author=Elwar, E. |work=Digital Journal |publisher=Digital Journal, Inc |date=19 May 2012 |accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|February 2016}}, communications spectrum for these and other similar devices is set aside at various points in the 400 [[Hertz|MHz]] [[frequency]] band, as well as the 2360-2400&amp;nbsp;MHz band, though specifically for medical [[body area network]] (MBAN) devices. The specification supersedes and incorporates a previous specification called the Medical Implant Communication Service (MICS).&lt;ref name="FCCMedRadio" /&gt;

The specification and nearly identical spectrum have also been created by the [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]] (ETSI), with the specification largely referred to as '''MICS/MEDS''' (Medical Data Service) in Europe and other parts of the world.&lt;ref name="FarlowAnOver11"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cwins.wpi.edu/workshop11/ppt/business_Charles.pdf |format=PDF |title=An Overview of the Medical Device Radiocommunications Service (MedRadio) and Future Telemetry Considerations |author=Farlow, C.S. |publisher=Medtronic, Inc |date=20 June 2011 |accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ETSI_EN301_489-29"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301400_301499/30148929/01.01.01_60/en_30148929v010101p.pdf |format=PDF |title=ETSI EN 301 489-29 V1.1.1 |publisher=European Telecommunications Standards Institute |date=February 2009 |accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The FCC created the Medical Implant Communication Service (MICS) in 1999 "in response to a petition for rule making by [Medtronic, Inc.] to permit use of a mobile radio device, implanted in a patient, for transmitting data in support of the diagnostic and/or therapeutic functions associated with an implanted medical device."&lt;ref name="Dortch03-32_03"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-03-32A1.pdf |format=PDF |title=Federal Communications Commission 03-32 |author=Dortch, M.H. |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |pages=7 |date=25 February 2003 |accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FCC_PF03"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IF1CAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Medical+Implant+Communication+Service+1999&amp;dq=Medical+Implant+Communication+Service+1999&amp;hl=en |title=Communications Regulation |author=Federal Communications Commission |publisher=Pike &amp; Fischer, Inc |location=Silver Springs, MD |year=2003 |volume=28 |page=680 |accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set aside the 402–405&amp;nbsp;MHz band and designated a low maximum transmit power, [[EIRP]]=25 microwatt, in order to reduce the risk of interfering with other users of the same band. Ten channels of 300&amp;nbsp;kHz each were assigned to the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]. MICS provided additional flexibility to medical device developers compared to previously used inductive technologies, which required the external [[transceiver]] to touch the skin of the patient.&lt;ref name="Dortch03-32_03" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FCC_PF03" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ETSI_EN301_839-1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301800_301899/30183901/01.03.01_60/en_30183901v010301p.pdf |format=PDF |title=ETSI EN 301 839-1 V1.3.1 |publisher=European Telecommunications Standards Institute |date=October 2009 |accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; MICS was later adopted by the ETSI in 2002.&lt;ref name="NikitaHand14"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y8MiBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT652&amp;lpg=PT652 |title=Handbook of Biomedical Telemetry |editor=Nikita, K.S. |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2014 |pages=736 |isbn=9781118893425 |accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|652}}

In 2006, the FCC reevaluated the spectrum requirements at the prompting of Medtronic, which sought to expand the spectrum "to support advances in medical sensor technology and the expected proliferation of such devices, especially those used for lower-cost medical monitoring and non-emergency reporting applications."&lt;ref name="Dortch06-103_06"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-06-103A1.pdf |format=PDF |title=Federal Communications Commission 06-103 |author=Dortch, M.H. |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |pages=29 |date=18 July 2006 |accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar process was initiated by the ETSI in Europe in July 2004, with both the FCC and ETSI considering the 401–402 and 405–406&amp;nbsp;MHz ranges. The ETSI formalized the proposal into a standard called MEDS (with the core MICS bands remaining under that name and the new "wing" bands being referred to as MEDS) in December 2007,&lt;ref name="FarlowAnOver11" /&gt; while the FCC added the same additional spectrum to MICS and dubbed the expanded plan the Medical Device Radiocommunications Service or MedRadio in May 2009.&lt;ref name="FCCMedRadio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Knapp09-1027_09"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-09-23A5.pdf |format=PDF |title=Federal Communications Commission 09-1027 |author=Knapp, J.P. |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |pages=29 |date=6 May 2009 |accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KalahastyRemote13"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dYD6AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA279 |chapter=A Brief History of Remote Cardiac Monitoring |title=Remote Monitoring and Physiologic Sensing Technologies and Applications |author1=Kalahasty, G. |author2=Alimohammed, R. |author3=Mahajan, R. |author4=Morjaria, S. |author5=Ellenbogen, K.A. |editor1=Asirvatham, S.J. |editor2=Venkatachalam, K.L. |editor3=Kapa, S. |publisher=Elsevier, Inc |location=Philadelphia, PA |year=2013 |pages=275–282 |isbn=9780323188463 |accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FCC expanded MedRadio's spectrum again in November 2011, adding 24 megahertz in the 413-419&amp;nbsp;MHz, 426-432&amp;nbsp;MHz, 438-444&amp;nbsp;MHz, and 451-457&amp;nbsp;MHz ranges as part of an "effort to recognize and facilitate the significant advances in wireless medical technologies that are revolutionizing treatment for a wide variety of medical conditions."&lt;ref name="FCCMedRadio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dortch11-176_11"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-11-176A1.pdf |format=PDF |title=Federal Communications Commission 11-176 |author=Dortch, M.H. |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |pages=56 |date=30 November 2011 |accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FCC allocated additional spectrum (2360-2400&amp;nbsp;MHz) specifically for MBAN devices in May 2012, effective on October 10, citing "significant public interest benefits associated with the development and deployment" of MBAN devices.&lt;ref name="FCCMedRadio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VerselFCC12"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mobihealthnews.com/18431/fcc-finalizes-mban-rule-still-must-appoint-coordinator |title=FCC finalizes MBAN rule, still must appoint coordinator |author=Versel, N. |work=MobiHealthNews |publisher=HIMSS Media |date=13 September 2012 |accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional modifications to the MBAN rules were released in August 2014, including the "narrowing [of] the definition of [[Health facility|health care facilities]] that may use MBAN devices in the 2360-2390 MHz band" and relaxing MBAN network topology restrictions among others.&lt;ref name="Dortch14-124_14"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-14-124A1_Rcd.pdf |format=PDF |title=Federal Communications Commission 14-124 |author=Dortch, M.H. |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |pages=34 |date=21 August 2014 |accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PrimoschWhat15"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imedicalapps.com/2015/02/fcc-wireless-body-sensors/ |title=What the FCC’s new rules mean for wireless body sensors |author=Primosch, R.D. |work=iMedicalApps |date=16 February 2015 |accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational parameters==
In the United States, the FCC states that:&lt;ref name="FCCMedRadio" /&gt;

* MedRadio devices can only be operated by an authorized health care providers such as a [[physician]] or legally authorized entity able "to provide health care services using medical implant devices";
* MedRadio device manufacturers and representatives can only operate the device "for the purpose of demonstrating, installing and maintaining the equipment" for authorized health care providers; and
* MedRadio devices are only "authorized on a secondary status" and must accept any interference created by devices of primary status.

Operational parameters in other parts of the world may vary slightly based on local law. In Canada, for example, devices that fall under the MEDS standard also fall under secondary status, but they are classified nationally as Category I equipment that require a [[Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada|technical acceptance certificate]] (TAC) or equally recognized certificate before they can be used.&lt;ref name=""&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf09826.html |title=RSS-243 — Medical Devices Operating in the 401–406 MHz Frequency Band |publisher=Industry Canada, Government of Canada |date=February 2010 |accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Midnight regulations''' are [[United States federal government]] [[Code of Federal Regulations|regulations]] created by [[executive branch]] agencies in the [[Lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] period of an outgoing [[President of the United States|president]]'s administration.

==Process of creating new regulations==
The [[United States Congress]] passes laws that sometimes outline only broad policy mandates. [[Rulemaking]] by the specialist agencies in the executive branch adds necessary detail to these laws. Rulemaking also provides an administration with an opportunity to exert political influence over government without having to go through Congress to change the law.

U.S. federal law mandates a 60-day waiting period before any major regulatory changes become law. Thus, some presidents try to publish new major regulations on November 21, 60 days before the new president's [[United States presidential inauguration|inauguration]] on January 20. "Minor" regulations, or those that have less than [[United States dollar|US$]]100 million in effect on the economy or do not have major social policy significance,&lt;ref name=NN /&gt; have a similar 30-day waiting period. Tom Firey, of the [[Cato Institute]]'s ''[[Regulation (magazine)|Regulation]]'' magazine, argues that most midnight regulations are in fact primarily political symbolism rather than major regulatory change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title="Congress and Midnight Regulations" featuring Thomas A. Firey|url=http://www.cato.org/dailypodcast/podcast-archive.php?podcast_id=809|network=[[Cato Institute]] podcast|airdate=January 9, 2009|access-date=November 20, 2010|minutes=7:51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulations that have not yet become law can be placed on hold by the incoming President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97291312|title=Bush Hits Deadline For 'Midnight Regulations'|last=Overby|first=Peter|date=November 21, 2008|publisher=''[[Morning Edition]]'', [[National Public Radio|NPR]]|access-date=November 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regulations that take effect before a new president takes office can still be reversed by the same executive agencies, but this requires a considerable [[rule-making process]]. In addition, reversing recently enacted regulations may distract an incoming administration from its own regulatory agenda.&lt;ref name=NN&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97260899|title=Dems Scrutinize Bush's Midnight Regulations|last=Chideya|first=Farai|date=November 20, 2008|publisher=''[[News &amp; Notes]]'', [[National Public Radio|NPR]]|access-date=December 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, because regulations are executive branch agencies' interpretations of statutes passed by [[United States Congress|Congress]], Congress can effectively overturn the regulations by passing more explicit statutory mandates. But in each case the period in which the disfavored regulations are law may permit undesired results to take place. For example, a heavily polluting power plant could be built in the period that a federal regulation is law.&lt;ref name=Kolbert /&gt; A third option is for Congress to overturn the regulation under the [[Congressional Review Act]] of 1996, requiring congressional approval for any similar rule issued in the future. Of the 50,000 regulations enacted since the Act was passed, only fifteen have been so overturned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1108/15758.html|title=Will Bush's midnight rules be reversible?|last=Sapien|first=Joaquin|date=November 19, 2008|publisher=''[[The Politico]]''|access-date=December 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Jimmy Carter.jpg|thumb|130px|right|[[Jimmy Carter]] was the first president to make extensive use of midnight regulations.]]
The term "midnight regulation" entered the lexicon in 1980–81, during the final months of [[Jimmy Carter]]'s single term as president.&lt;ref name="Mercatus"&gt;[http://www.mercatus.org/uploadedFiles/Mercatus/Publications/WP0806_RSP_Midnight%20Regulations.pdf Antony Davies and Veronique de Rugy (March 2008), Midnight Regulations: An Update, Mercatus Center, George Washington University, Working Paper No. 08-06]&lt;/ref&gt; Carter's administration set a new record for midnight regulations&lt;ref name=Mercatus/&gt; by publishing more than 10,000 pages of new rules between Election Day and [[Ronald Reagan]]'s Inauguration Day.&lt;ref name=Kolbert&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/talk/comment/2008/11/24/081124taco_talk_kolbert|title=Comment: Midnight Hour|last=Kolbert|first=Elizabeth|date=November 24, 2008|publisher=''[[The New Yorker]]''|access-date=November 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is an allusion to the "[[midnight judges]]" appointed by [[John Adams]] in the final months of his presidency.&lt;ref name=Kolbert/&gt;

Due to midnight regulations, since 1948, during the period between a presidential election and the inauguration of a president of a different [[political party|party]], the [[Federal Register]] has averaged 17 percent more pages than during the same period in non-election years.&lt;ref name=Mercatus/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cindy Skrzycki, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/02/AR2008060202893.html Bush Wants Sun to Set on Midnight Regulations], ''The Washington Post'', Tuesday, June 3, 2008; Page D03&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bill Clinton===
The [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton Administration]] enacted a flurry of rules limiting logging and lead paint, raising appliance energy efficiency, and tightening privacy of medical records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/09/weekinreview/09broder.html|title=A Legacy Bush Can Control |last=Broder|first=John|date=September 9, 2007|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|access-date=November 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Clinton's midnight regulations imposed a more stringent [[Arsenic contamination of groundwater#United States|drinking water standard for arsenic]] after years of [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] study. Although Bush suspended the new regulation upon taking office, EPA head [[Christine Todd Whitman]] eventually approved it.&lt;ref name=Kolbert /&gt; When President George W. Bush took office in 2001, his administration acted to block the implementation of 90 final rules that were issued in the final months of the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]] but that had not yet gone into effect.&lt;ref name=WashPost-Nov11-2008/&gt;

===George W. Bush===
[[File:Bolten Joshua.jpg|thumb|130px|right|Bush Chief of Staff [[Joshua Bolten]] wrote a memo encouraging Administration agencies to pass rules in time for them to become law before the end of Bush's second term.]]
The [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] also approved thousands of pages of dozens of new agency rules,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=44924|title=ENVIRONMENT-US: Bush Quietly Passes Dozens of New Rules|last=Leahy|first=Stephen|date=December 1, 2008|publisher=[[Inter Press Service|IPS]]|accessdate=December 3, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205004244/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=44924|archivedate=December 5, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; setting a new record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harris|first=Paul |title=Bush sneaks through host of laws to undermine Obama|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/14/george-bush-midnight-regulations|accessdate=November 20, 2010|newspaper=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=December 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these regulations were promulgated in the hope of ensuring enactment before [[Barack Obama]] took office and could prevent the rules from becoming law. Bush [[White House Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]] [[Joshua Bolten]] encouraged timely passage of the rules in a May 2008 memo to agencies suggesting that final versions be submitted by November 1.&lt;ref name=WashPost-Nov11-2008&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/10/AR2008111002902.html|title=Democrats Eye Bush Midnight Regulations|last=Skrzycki|first=Cindy|date=November 11, 2008|publisher=''[[Washington Post]]''|accessdate=November 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finalized and proposed rules included:&lt;ref name=NN /&gt;
* A finalized rule that effectively deregulates [[Factory farming|industrial farms]]
* An adopted rule that opens up public land to drilling preliminary to the development of [[oil shale]] extraction
* A [[Right of Conscience Rule|proposed rule]] that provides for a [[Conscience clause (medical)|conscience clause]] for workers at hospitals receiving federal money (particularly state hospitals), allowing them to refuse to perform [[abortion]]s or dispense [[contraceptive]]s

Several other rules were already adopted in late 2008, including one increasing [[truck driver]]s' maximum [[hours of service]] to eleven and another restricting employee time off under the [[Family and Medical Leave Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122714583954143319|title=White House Pushes Through a Flurry of Rule Changes Sought by Business |last=Power|first=Stephen |author2=Elizabeth Williamson |author3=Christopher Conkey|date=November 20, 2008|publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''|accessdate=December 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules attracted considerable criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/Story?id=6146929&amp;page=1|title=The Bush Administration's Midnight Regulations|last=Schwartz|first=Emma|date=October 30, 2008|publisher=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=November 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hours after Obama took office, his administration ordered all executive branch agencies to halt enactment of any rules proposed during the Bush Administration until the incoming administration could review them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zakaria|first=Tabassum |title=WHouse stops pending Bush regulations for review|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE50J88L20090121|accessdate=November 20, 2010|newspaper=[[Reuters]]|date=Jan 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the environmentalist magazine ''[[Grist (magazine)|Grist]]'', these efforts were effective in only a few cases; for other environmental rules the Obama administration tried to reverse some rules through Congress and some through the same slow administrative rulemaking process while interest groups challenged other environmental regulations in the courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Livermore|first=Michael|title=Midnight regulations: After midnight, we're going to let it all hang out.|url=http://www.grist.org/article/2010-02-04-midnight-regulations|accessdate=November 20, 2010|newspaper=''[[Grist (magazine)|Grist]]''|date=February 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A subcommittee on administrative law in the Democratic [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] held a hearing on midnight regulations the month after Obama's inauguration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title='''Hearing on:''' Midnight Rulemaking: Shedding Some Light|url=http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/hear_090204.html|publisher=[[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law]]|accessdate=November 20, 2010|date=February 4, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202025508/http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/hear_090204.html|archivedate=December 2, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Barack Obama ===
The [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama Administration]] recognized the potential for midnight regulations as early as the end of 2015. [[Howard Shelanski]], the Administrator for the [[Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]] (OIRA), issued a memo to federal agencies directing them to: “To the extent feasible and consistent with your priorities, statutory obligations, and judicial deadlines, however, agencies should strive to complete their highest priority rulemakings by the summer of 2016 to avoid an end-of-year scramble that has the potential to lower the quality of regulations that OIRA receives for review and to tax the resources available for interagency review.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/agencyinformation_circulars_memoranda_2015_pdf/regulatory_review_at_the_end_of_the_administration.pdf|title=Regulatory Review at the End of the Administration|last=Shelanski|first=Howard|date=December 17, 2015|website=|publisher=Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Obama Administration’s final [https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaMain Unified Agenda], there were [https://www.americanactionforum.org/insight/lame-duck-regulatory-agenda-projects-44-billion-midnight-costs/ 25 notable rules] in the “midnight period” with combined regulatory cost estimates (from the “proposed rule” versions) of approximately $44.1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanactionforum.org/insight/lame-duck-regulatory-agenda-projects-44-billion-midnight-costs/|title=Lame Duck Regulatory Agenda Projects $44 Billion in Midnight Costs - AAF|newspaper=AAF|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Republican Conference of the United States House of Representatives|House Republicans]] introduced legislation that would provide a check upon Obama administration midnight rules. Representative [[Darrell Issa]] introduced [https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5982 H.R. 5982], or the “Midnight Rules Relief Act of 2016”, that “amends the [[Congressional Review Act]] to allow Congress to consider a joint resolution to disapprove multiple regulations that federal agencies have submitted for congressional review within the last 60 legislative days of a session of Congress during the final year of a President's term.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5982|title=H.R.5982 - Midnight Rules Relief Act of 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill passed in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] by a vote of 240–179.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll585.xml|title=Roll Call 585|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Maftzar.png|right|thumb|Military Advocate General logo]]
The '''Military Advocate General''' ({{lang-he|הפרקליטות הצבאית}}, ''Ha-Praklitut Ha-Tzvaʿit'') assists the [[Israel Defense Forces]] in imposing rules of conduct through legal advice, legal instruction, maintaining the mechanisms for military prosecution and legal defense, and fulfilling special legal tasks. It supervises, by exercising the designated operative instruments and authority, over the [[rule of law]] in the IDF.

==Overview==
The principal activities of the Military Advocate General are: 

*Maintaining prosecution and legal defense systems before the [[military tribunal]]s.
*Providing military authorities with legal advice on military law and the law in general (including [[international law]]).
*Maintaining the military tribunal system in areas falling under the jurisdiction of the IDF.
*Supervision over the rules of conduct in the IDF.
*Supervision over the [[Israeli Military Police|investigatory]] arms in the IDF, and over the [[Israeli military prison|military detention centres]].
*Representing the IDF before public and institutional bodies.
*Teaching law and jurisprudence in the IDF and its values among soldiers and commanders.

==Structure==
The Military Advocate General consists of the following bodies:

===Chief Military Advocate General=== 
Head of the service, brigadier general [[Sharon Afek]]. A member of the [[Israeli General Staff|General Staff]], but not professionally subordinate to the [[Ramatkal|Chief of Staff]].

===Deputy Military Advocate General=== 
Coordinates and directs the CMAG Command; serves as [[Acting (law)|acting]] CMAG during the Chief's absence.

===Chief Military [[Prosecutor|Prosecution]]=== 
Headed by the Chief Military Prosecutor, it is responsible for criminal prosecution. The Chief Military Prosecutor has exclusive authority to submit appeals to the [[Israeli Military Court of Appeals|Military Court of Appeals]] over rulings rendered by the District Military Tribunals.

===Chief Military [[Defense (legal)|Defense]]===
Responsible for defending soldiers and officers before the military tribunals, during appeals to the Military Court of Appeals, and providing representation and legal advise to members of the military while they undergo an investigation.

===Legal Supervision and Doctrine Branch===
Composed of three departments: ''The [[Administrative law|Administrative Justice]] Dept.'' oversees administrative conduct and provides legal advice on areas related to administrative law. ''The [[Amnesty]] Dept.'' centralizes amnesty appeals to the [[President of Israel|President]], provides legal opinion to the Chief of Staff as an authority confirming verdicts and sentences (including their reductions), provides legal advise to the Committee for erasing the criminal records of soldiers prior to their recruitment, handles prisoner releases in the framework of peace agreements, and treats appeals to the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]]. ''The [[Supervisor]]y Dept.'' attends to criticisms of MAG bodies, and coordinates its activities with investigatory entities outside the IDF.

===[[International Law]] Branch=== 
This branch, headed by the CMAG Assistant for International Law, advises the service on areas related to international law.

===Legislation and Consultancy Branch===
This branch is responsible for legal counsultation and legislation pertaining to the military in areas unrelated to international law (or the [[Israeli-occupied territories]]).

===Legal Advisor in Judea and Samaria===
The legal advisor in Judea and Samaria is charged with providing legal advice regarding military activities and military administration to the military commander of Judea and Samaria and to the head of the civil administration. In that role, the division has a difficult task in balancing security interests with humanitarian concerns and plays an active role in settling disputes between Israelis and Palestinians. The division provides legal advice on various aspects of security measures, planning and zoning, land registration, economic activity, municipal governance, etc. Additionally, the division plays a major part in the financial war against terrorist organizations in both seizing terror-related funds and the tracking and arresting of individuals involved in those activities. Lastly, the division plays a central role in planning the route, determining passage arrangements, petitions to the High Court of Justice and compensation issues relating to the Security Barrier.

===Military Law School===
The school is responsible for teaching law and jurisprudence, and for the training and professional advancement of MAG officers.

'''Muhammad Hamidullah''' ({{lang-ur|محمد حمیداللہ}}), (9 February 1908 – 17 December 2002) [[Doctor of Philosophy|D. Phil.]], [[Doctor of Letters|D. Litt.]], [[Hilal-e-Imtiaz|HI]], was a [[Muhaddith]], [[Faqih]], scholar of [[Islamic law]] and an academic author with over 250 books.&lt;ref name="albalagh.net"/&gt; A prolific writer, his extensive works on Islamic science, history and culture have been published in several languages and many thousands of articles in learned journals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oumma.com/Hommage-au-Professeur-Muhammad Hommage au Professeur Muhammad Hamidullah]&lt;/ref&gt; His scholarship is regarded by many as unparalleled in the last century. A double doctorate ([[D.Phil.]] and [[D.Litt.]]) and a [[polymath]], he was fluent in 22 languages including Urdu (his mother tongue), Persian, Arabic, French, English, German, Italian, Greek, Turkish, Russian etc. He learned Thai at the age of 84.&lt;ref name="albalagh.net"&gt;[http://www.albalagh.net/general/dr_hamidullah.shtml  Dr. Muhammad Hamidullah: Great Scholar, Simple Man]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and background==
Hamidullah was from the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] area of [[British India]] and was born in Hyderabad, capital city of then [[Hyderabad State]], (now [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], [[Telangana]], [[India]]), and hails from a family of scholars, the youngest amongst three brothers and five sisters. His family's roots lie in the [[Nawayath]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; community, his ancestors were eminent scholars in their own right.&lt;ref name="Hamidullah, translator of the Quran"/&gt;

He earned his BA, LLB and MA at [[Osmania University]]. He travelled to Germany and was awarded D.Phil. by [[Bonn University]] in 1932. After serving in the faculty of Bonn as a lecturer in Arabic and Urdu for a short time, he went to France and registered at [[Sorbonne University]] for his second doctorate. He was awarded D.Litt. by the university after 11 months. He taught international law at Osmania University between 1936 and 1946.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Career==
In 1948, Hamidullah was appointed by the [[Nizam]] as part of the delegation sent to London and the United Nations in New York to seek support against the invasion of the Nizam's territories by Indian Forces.&lt;ref name="Hamidullah, translator of the Quran"&gt;[http://www.islamonline.com/news/articles/7/Muhammad-Hamidullah-Translator-of-the-Quran.html Muhammad Hamidullah: Translator of the Quran] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313172712/http://www.islamonline.com/news/articles/7/Muhammad-Hamidullah-Translator-of-the-Quran.html |date=March 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he moved to Pakistan and was involved in writing of [[Pakistan]]'s constitution, but did not to settle there as he found the cultural environment not to his liking.  In 1985, he was awarded the [[Hilal-e-Imtiaz]], the highest civilian award of Pakistan. The monetary part of the award was donated to the Islamic Research Academy, Islamabad.&lt;ref name="albalagh.net"/&gt;

In 1948 he returned to France, living there for virtually the remainder of his life, apart from travel to teaching posts he held in Turkey for a number of years. He also held a post with [[French National Centre for Scientific Research]] from 1954, which ended in 1978.

Hamidullah was the last remaining citizen of the erstwhile [[Hyderabad State]] (which following 1956 reorganisation was divided into 3 on linguistic basis, and absorbed into other states of India, most being in Andhra Pradesh) and never obtained the citizenship of any other nation. Classed as a ''Refugee of Hyderabad'' by the French Government, which allowed him to stay in Paris, he remained exiled from his homeland after its annexation by the [[Indian Government]] in 1950. Hamidullah devoted his whole life to scholarship and did not marry.&lt;ref name="Hamidullah, translator of the Quran"/&gt;

His ancestors and extended family are [[jurist]]s, writers and [[Administration (business)|administrators]]. His great grandfather Maulvi Mohammed Ghauth Sharfu'l-Mulk (d. 1822) was scholar of Islamic sciences, writing over 30 books in Arabic, Persian and Urdu, including a seven volume exegesis of the Qur'an. His paternal grandfather [[Qadi]] Mohammed Sibghatullah was a jurist and a scholar of repute writing an exegesis of the Holy Qu'ran as well as other books. He was also appointed Chief Judge of [[Madras]] in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dr-mhaleem-issori.zoomshare.com/11.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419165417/http://dr-mhaleem-issori.zoomshare.com/11.html |archivedate=April 19, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamidullah's father Mufti Abu Mohammed Khalilullah, was a scholar of Islamic jurisprudence, a director of revenue in the government of [[Nizam]] of Hyderabad, and the pioneer in establishing an interest-free banking system in Hyderabad.&lt;ref name="Hamidullah, translator of the Quran"/&gt;

Hamidullah is known for contributions to the research of [[Hadith]] history, translations of the [[Qur'an]] into multiple languages and in particular into French (first by a Muslim scholar) and for the monumental biography of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] in French. He is also famous for discovering a missing work on the Prophet Muhammad regarded as one of his great contributions to the [[Hadith]] literature. The earliest Hadith manuscript still extant today, Sahifa Hammam bin Munabbah, was discovered in a Damascus library. Hammam bin Munabbah being a disciple of Sayyidina Abu Huraira, one of the [[Sahaba]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Remembering+Muhammad+Hamidullah-a0119627464 Remembering Muhammad Hamidullah]&lt;/ref&gt; It proved, that the earliest manuscripts had been absorbed into the much bigger later compilations.

Since 1973, the '''[[New York Yankees]]''' [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) club has enforced an '''appearance policy''' regulating how their players must be presented. It states that players must have their hair cut above the collar of their [[baseball jersey]] and no beards are permitted. The policy has raised some controversy and there have been calls for its abolition.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

== History ==
The policy was started in 1973 by former club owner [[George Steinbrenner]], reportedly after seeing several players' hair covering their numbers during performance of the "[[Star Spangled Banner]]" and noting down their numbers (as he did not know their names) to instruct them to cut their hair. As a result, he introduced an appearance policy for the Yankees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bashe|first=Philip|title=Dog Days: The New York Yankees' Fall from Grace and Return to Glory, 1964–1976|location=New York|publisher=Random House, Inc.|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official policy states "All players, coaches and male executives are forbidden to display any facial hair other than mustaches (except for religious reasons), and scalp hair may not be grown below the collar. Long sideburns and 'mutton chops' are not specifically banned."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hoch|first=Bryan|title=No beard in the Bronx: Wilson won't shave for Yanks|url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/63902080/|publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]]|date=November 13, 2013|accessdate=March 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdcwire.com/boston-police-departments-grooming-policies-would-make-george-steinbrenner-proud/ |title=Boston Police Department's Grooming Policies Would Make George Steinbrenner Proud |publisher=BDC Wire |date= |accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was because Steinbrenner wanted the Yankees to adopt a corporate attitude.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite web|last=Barbarisi |first=Daniel |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324048904578320741510151474 |title=Yankees: No Beards—And That's Final |work=Wall Street Journal |date=February 23, 2013 |accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance policy may have been inspired by Steinbrenner's veteran status with the [[United States Air Force]], which like other military branches also has a [[Uniforms of the United States Armed Forces|similar appearance policy.]]

The policy raised some objections from the team. [[Don Mattingly]] openly defied the Yankees' management's requests for him to cut his hair. In response they removed him from the starting lineup and fined him repeatedly until he promised to trim it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee |first=Joon |url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/tht-live/20th-anniversary-of-don-mattinglys-hair-related-benching/ |title=20th anniversary of Don Mattingly’s hair-related benching |work=Hardball Times |date=August 15, 2011 |accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An incident that had mirrored a story in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Homer at the Bat]]" where Mattingly was a guest star and was benched in the episode for having long sideburns (that only [[Mr. Burns]], the team manager, could see) was written months before the Yankees incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leitch |first=Will |url=http://nymag.com/daily/sports/2011/08/mattingly-hair-20-years-ago.html |title=Twenty Years Ago, Donnie Baseball Cut His Hair |work=NY Mag |date= |accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lou Piniella]] challenged the rule during [[spring training]] in [[Fort Lauderdale]], citing that [[Jesus]] had long hair. Steinbrenner responded to this request for exemption by pointing at the nearby swimming pool and saying "[[Jesus walking on water|If you can walk on water]], you can wear your hair any way you want."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gameon/post/2009/09/68498215/1#.V6WekzFzXIU |title=Steinbrenner, Piniella and the great Jesus debate |work=USA Today |date=September 1, 2009 |accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy has become a prominent symbol of the New York Yankees.&lt;ref name=kj /&gt; An example of the symbolic clean-shaven look came when [[Johnny Damon]] cut his "caveman" hair and beard when joining the Yankees from the [[Boston Red Sox]] with Steinbrenner commenting "he looks like a Yankee, sounds like a Yankee, he is a Yankee".&lt;ref name=kj&gt;{{cite web|author=Kenny DeJohn |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1536907-its-time-for-the-new-york-yankees-to-modernize-their-facial-hair-policy |title=It's Time for the New York Yankees to Modernize Their Facial Hair Policy |work=Bleacher Report |date=February 20, 2013 |accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy has led to media speculation that when a player cuts his hair, he is going to sign with the Yankees. One example of this was [[San Francisco Giants]]' [[Tim Lincecum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kevin Kaduk |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mlb-big-league-stew/tim-lincecum-hair-no-longer-very-long-182554604--mlb.html |title=Tim Lincecum’s hair is no longer very long |publisher=Sports.yahoo.com |date=December 20, 2012 |accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some players, such as [[David Price (baseball)|David Price]], have openly stated that they would never join the Yankees as long as the policy was in place.&lt;ref name=wsj /&gt;

== Calls for abolition ==
There have been several calls for the New York Yankees to drop the policy.{{fact|date=August 2016}} The New York Yankees players themselves skirted around the policy in 2015 by adopting the practice of growing moustaches in line with the wording of the policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jimmy Traina |url=http://www.foxsports.com/buzzer/photos/new-york-yankees-mustaches-050715 |title=No beards allowed for New York Yankees, so mustache madness hits the Bronx |publisher=FOX Sports |date=May 7, 2015 |accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manager [[Joe Girardi]] stated that he would join the players if they won 10 in a row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Feinsand |first=Mark |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/mustache-craze-grows-yankees-clubhouse-article-1.2211880 |title=Mustache craze grows in Yankees clubhouse |work=NY Daily News |date=May 5, 2015 |accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was despite Girardi stating that he would continue Steinbrenner's policy after Steinbrenner had died.&lt;ref name=wsj /&gt;

== Other clubs ==
Other baseball clubs also had an appearance policy. Until 1972, there were no MLB players that had facial hair due to fashion dictates at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reds.enquirer.com/1999/02/13/red_reds_clean-shaven.html |title=Reds clean-shaven since 1902 |work=Cincinnati Enquirer |date=February 13, 1999 |accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cincinnati Reds]] had a policy against beards as an [[unwritten rule]] until 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/reds-ban-on-facial-hair-lifted/ |title=Reds' Ban On Facial Hair Lifted |publisher=CBS News |date=February 16, 1999 |accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, when Mattingly became the [[field manager]] of the [[Miami Marlins]], he introduced a complete ban on any facial hair on any players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perry |first=Dayn |url=http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/the-marlins-have-banned-facial-hair/ |title=The Marlins have banned facial hair |publisher=CBS Sports |date=February 21, 2016 |accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the policy was abolished.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1269">'''''North Carolina Journal of Law &amp; Technology''''' ('''JOLT''') is a semi-annual student publication of the [[University of North Carolina School of Law]].  The journal, one of the first of its kind, was founded in 1998 and is viewed as one of the top [[law]] and [[technology]] journals in the country.

JOLT takes a broad view of the term "technology."  As such, topics in many seemingly divergent areas of the law can qualify for publication in JOLT, provided there is some relationship to a field of technology.  Recently, articles have dealt with [[ethics]], [[privacy]], [[bankruptcy]], [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], [[tax law]], and [[criminal law]], as well as more traditional "technology" areas such as [[copyright law|copyright]] and [[patent law]].

In addition to the print issues, JOLT staff writers also publish an online edition as well as a weekly blog.

[[File:Mick Mulvaney official photo.jpg|thumb|Current Director [[Mick Mulvaney]]]]
The '''Office of Management and Budget''' ('''OMB''') is the largest office within the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States]] (EOP). OMB's most prominent function is to produce the President's Budget,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mission and Structure of the Office of Management and Budget|url=http://www.obamawhitehouse.gov/omb/organization_mission/}}&lt;/ref&gt; but OMB also measures the quality of agency programs, policies, and procedures to see if they comply with the president's policies and coordinates inter-agency policy initiatives.

The current OMB Director is [[Mick Mulvaney]]. The OMB Director reports to the President, Vice President and the [[White House Chief of Staff]].

==History==
{{expand section|date=January 2016}}
The '''Bureau of the Budget''', OMB's predecessor, was established in 1921 as a part of the Department of the Treasury by the [[Budget and Accounting Act of 1921]], which was signed into law by president [[Warren G. Harding]]. The Bureau of the Budget was moved to the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|Executive Office of the President]] in 1939 and was run by [[Harold D.

Sundquist, Washington, D.C., July 15, 1963, by Charles T. Morrissey, https://www.trumanlibrary.org/oralhist/sundquis.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bureau was reorganized into the Office of Management and Budget in 1970 during the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/11541.html |title=Executive Orders |publisher=Archives.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first OMB included [[Roy Ash]] (head), [[Paul O'Neill (cabinet member)|Paul O'Neill]] (assistant director), [[Fred Malek]] (deputy director) and [[Frank Zarb]] (associate director) and two dozen others.

In the 1990s, OMB was reorganized to remove the distinction between management staff and budgetary staff by combining the dual roles into each given program examiner within the Resource Management Offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=OMB Organization Chart |url=http://www.obamawhitehouse.gov/omb/assets/about_omb/omb_org_chart.pdf |date= |work= |publisher=Office of Management and Budget }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
OMB prepares the President's budget proposal to Congress and supervises the administration of the executive branch agencies. OMB evaluates the effectiveness of agency programs, policies, and procedures, assesses competing funding demands among agencies, and sets funding priorities. OMB ensures that agency reports, rules, testimony, and proposed legislation are consistent with the president's budget and with administration policies.

OMB also oversees and coordinates the administration's procurement, financial management, information, and regulatory policies. In each of these areas, OMB's role is to help improve administrative management, to develop better performance measures and coordinating mechanisms, and to reduce any unnecessary burdens on the public.

OMB's critical missions are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.obamawhitehouse.gov/omb/organization_mission/ Organization Mission] at archive of OMB site}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Budget development and execution is a prominent government-wide process managed from the Executive Office of the President (EOP) and a device by which a president implements his policies, priorities, and actions in everything from the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] to [[NASA]].
#OMB manages other agencies' financials, paperwork, and IT.

==Structure==
===Overview===
The Office is made up mainly of career appointed staff who provide continuity across changes of party and persons in the White House. Six positions within OMB{{spaced ndash}}the Director, the Deputy Director, the Deputy Director for Management, and the administrators of the [[Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]], the [[Office of Federal Procurement Policy]], and the [[Office of Federal Financial Management]] are presidentially appointed and [[United States Senate|Senate]]-[[Advice and consent|confirmed]] positions.

The largest component of the Office of Management and Budget are the four Resource Management Offices which are organized along functional lines mirroring the U.S. federal government, each led by an OMB associate director. Approximately half of all OMB staff are assigned to these offices, the majority of whom are designated as program examiners. Program examiners can be assigned to monitor one or more federal agencies or may be deployed by a topical area, such as monitoring issues relating to U.S. Navy warships. These staff have dual responsibility for both management and budgetary issues, as well as responsibility for giving expert advice on all aspects relating to their programs. Each year they review federal agency budget requests and help decide what resource requests will be sent to Congress as part of the president's budget. They perform in-depth program evaluations using the Program Assessment Rating Tool, review proposed regulations, agency testimony, analyze pending legislation, and oversee the aspects of the president's management agenda including agency management scorecards. They are often called upon to provide analysis information to any EOP staff member. They also provide important information to those assigned to the statutory offices within OMB, which are Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, the Office of Federal Financial Management, and the [[Office of E-Government &amp; Information Technology]] whose job it is to specialize in issues such as federal regulations or procurement policy and law.

Other offices are OMB-wide support offices which include the [[Office of General Counsel]], the [[White House Office of Legislative Affairs|Office of Legislative Affairs]], the [[Budget Review Division]] (BRD), and the [[Legislative Reference Division]]. The BRD performs government-wide budget coordination and is largely responsible for the technical aspects relating to the release of the president's budget each February. With respect to the estimation of spending for the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]], the BRD serves a purpose parallel to that of the [[Congressional Budget Office]] for the estimation of spending for Congress, the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]] for the estimation of revenues for the executive branch, and the [[U.S. Congress Joint Committee on Taxation|Joint Committee on Taxation]] for the estimation of revenues for Congress.

The Legislative Reference Division has the important role of being the central clearing house across the federal government for proposed legislation or testimony by federal officials. It distributes proposed legislation and testimony to all relevant federal reviewers and distils the comments into a consensus opinion of the Administration about the proposal. They are also responsible for writing an Enrolled Bill Memorandum to the president once a bill is presented by both bodies of Congress for the president's signature. The Enrolled Bill Memorandum details the particulars of the bill, opinions on the bill from relevant federal departments, and an overall opinion about whether the bill should be signed into law or [[Veto#United States|vetoed]]. They also issue Statements of Administration Policy that let Congress know the White House's official position on proposed legislation.

=== Role in the Executive Budget Process ===
In practice, the President has assigned the OMB certain responsibilities when it comes to coming up with the budget for the new year and hiring authorities who play key roles in developing the budget. OMB coordinates the development of the President’s budget proposal by issuing circulars, memoranda, and guidance documents to the heads of executive agencies. The OMB works very closely with executive agencies in making sure the budget process and proposal is a smooth process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/905862779|title=The Office of Management and Budget and the presidency, 1921-1979|last=1951-|first=Berman, Larry,|isbn=9781400867288|location=Princeton, New Jersey|oclc=905862779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many steps when it comes to the development of the budget within the executive branch which takes nearly a year to complete. The first step is the Office of Management and Budget informing the president of the economic situation of the country.  The next step takes place in the spring and is known as the “Spring Guidance” in which the Office of Management and Budget provide executive agencies with instructions on policy guidance for the agencies to use when coming up with their budget requests along with thru due dates for agencies to submit their request. The OMB then works with the executive agencies to discuss issues for the upcoming budget. In July, the OMB issues circular A-11 to all agencies, which outlines clear instructions on submitting the budget proposals which the executive agencies then submit by September. The [[fiscal year]] begins October 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; and the OMB staff meet with senior agency representatives to discuss their proposals to find out if it fits in line with the president’s priorities and policies and identify constraints within the budget proposal until late November. The OMB director then meets with president and EOP advisors to discuss the budget proposals set forth by the agencies and recommends a federal budget proposal. The agencies are notified about decisions regarding their budget requests in which they can appeal to OMB and the President in December if they not satisfied with the decision. After working together to resolve issues, agencies and OMB prepare a budget justification document to present to relevant congressional committees, especially the appropriations committee. Finally, by the first Monday in February, the president must review and submit the final budget to congress to approve.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Art of Policymaking|last=Shambaugwh IV, Weinstein Jr.|first=George E., Paul J|publisher=CQ Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0321081032|location=Thousand Oaks, California|pages=109-113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Office of Management and Budget is also responsible for the preparation of [[Statements of Administrative Policy]] (SAPs) with the president. These statements allow the OMB to communicate the presidents and agencies policies to the government as a whole and set forth policymakers agendas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During the review of the federal budget, interests groups can lobby for policy change and impact the budget for the new year.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haeder|first=Simon F.|last2=Yackee|first2=Susan Webb|date=2015/08|title=Influence and the Administrative Process: Lobbying the U.S. President's Office of Management and Budget|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/influence-and-the-administrative-process-lobbying-the-us-presidents-office-of-management-and-budget/638F34BC73235AB4833C852B24C431AF|journal=American Political Science Review|language=en|volume=109|issue=3|pages=507–522|doi=10.1017/S0003055415000246|issn=0003-0554}}&lt;/ref&gt;  OMB plays a key role when it comes to policy conflicts by making sure legislation and agencies actions are consistent with that of the executive branch. The Office of Management and Budget has a very powerful and influential role in the United States Government, basically making sure the day to day operations run. Without a budget, federal employees could not be paid, federal buildings could not run and federal programs would come to a halt in what is known as a [[Government shutdowns in the United States|government shutdown.]] As a result of the OMB working closely with the president and executive branch, government shutdowns can occur when Congress refuses to accept the budget with policies which the majority party in congress does not agree with also known as a [[Divided government in the United States|divided government]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''The Parliamentary Elections Corrupt Practices Act 1885''' ([[48 &amp; 49 Vict.]] c. 56) was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It became law on 6 August 1885.

It declared, in order to clarify past ambiguities, that it was legal for an employer to allow his employees a reasonable amount of [[paid time off]] work in order to vote in a parliamentary election. This permission was, as far as reasonably possible, to be given to all employees, and not to be given in order to induce them to vote for a specific candidate, or refused to discourage them from voting for another.

It did not criminalise any previously legitimate activity.

The [[European Union]] (EU) '''directive on criminal measures aimed at ensuring the enforcement of intellectual property rights (2005/0127/COD)''' was a proposal from the European Commission for a [[European Union directive|directive]] aimed "to supplement [[Directive on the enforcement of intellectual property rights|Directive 2004/48/EC of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement of intellectual property rights (Civil enforcement)]]" (''Source: Justification for the proposal, COM(2005) 276 final, July 12, 2005''). The directive was proposed on July 12, 2005 by the [[Commission of the European Communities]].

Being the second directive on the enforcement of "intellectual property rights", it is commonly called '''IPRED2''' (Second Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Directive). The first directive on the enforcement of Intellectual property rights, Directive 2004/48/EC deals with civil enforcement of intellectual property rights ("IPRED1"). IPRED1 was hastily passed before the [[Enlargement of the European Union#Madrid European Council Criteria|Fifth Enlargement of the European Union]] of May 1, 2004 and did originally include criminal sanctions provisions, but this rather controversial part was omitted in order to be able to meet the deadline of May 1, 2004.

As announced in Official Journal C 252 of 18 September 2010&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:252:0007:0011:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt; the European Commission decided to withdraw the proposal for a directive. Criminal sanctions for enforcement of intellectual property rights are therefore not currently formally proposed, even if it is part of the [[EU acquis]] since the [[Lisbon Treaty]].

==Subject matter==

This proposed directive incriminates infringements of intellectual property rights. It deals with intentional infringements on a commercial scale or aiding, abetting or inciting to the infringements.

===Community IP Rights===

The proposed directive applies to "such intellectual property rights as are provided for in Community legislation and/or national legislation in the Member States". No definition is provided in the original draft&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52005PC0276(01):EN:NOT&lt;/ref&gt; and in that form, the Directive would apply to any intellectual property right. Subsequent readings of the Directive have included clarifications. Examples of such expressly included rights are ''sui generis'' rights of database makers or trademark rights.&lt;ref&gt;http://action.ffii.org/ipred2/JURI_Tabled_Amendments&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patents===

The Directive, in its first draft, includes patent violation, traditionally a civil issue. This would possibly have far-reaching consequences for the EU economy as the risk of criminal prosecution for violating patents when new products or new functions are included is great.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fsfe.org/en/fellows/gerloff/blog/ipred2_universally_unloved&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, traditionally, a large majority of all patent disputes are settled out of court before civil infringement disputes continue. The bill also includes a provision which would allow intellectual property holders to assist the police in an investigation, which cedes great power from the state to a patent-holder to threaten rivals with imprisonment, rather than a civil suit alone.&lt;ref name="fipr.org"&gt;http://www.fipr.org/copyright/ipred2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Parliament has, in subsequent reading, excluded patents from the scope of the Directive.

===Consumers===

The Directive applies to ''willful, commercial or intentional'' violations of trademark or copyright laws.&lt;ref name="Article 1"&gt;Article 1&lt;/ref&gt; An amendment that would have limited the directive to commercial activity done with the intent to earn a profit was rejected. Instead, consumers will be criminally liable if their behavior is not for ''personal and not for profits purposes'' and was done for the purpose of obtaining ''an economic advantage''.

==Criticism==

According to some, IPRED2 does not seem to be a particularly well drafted Directive.&lt;ref name="fipr.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://fsfeurope.org/projects/ipred2/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://action.ffii.org/ipred2&lt;/ref&gt; The number of amendments passed and adopted in subsequent readings is unusual, as is evident from the drafting process.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/file.jsp?id=5263692&lt;/ref&gt; The definitions, usually contained in the preamble or the beginning articles, were missing until subsequent readings. Originally about commercial piracy and counterfeit goods only, in its present form it includes any violation of Intellectual Property rights.&lt;ref name="Article 1"/&gt;

The criticism voiced by [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]],&lt;ref name="eff.org"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/005174.php&lt;/ref&gt; [[Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure|FFII]],&lt;ref name="action.ffii.org"&gt;http://action.ffii.org/ipred2/FFII_Analysis?action=AttachFile&amp;do=get&amp;target=introduction.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Law Society of England and Wales,&lt;ref name="lawsociety.org.uk"&gt;http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/secure/file/157008/e:/teamsite-deployed/documents//templatedata/Internet%20Documents/Non-government%20proposals/Documents/ipcriminalsanctions310806.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the Dutch Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ip-watch.org/weblog/index.php?p=354&amp;res=1024_ff&amp;print=0&lt;/ref&gt; and others includes:

*The original proposal did not explain the terms it was using. The definitions section (Article 1) was only added in the subsequent readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ip.mpg.de/shared/data/pdf/directive_of_the_european_parliament_and_of_the_council_on_criminal_measures_aimed_at_ensuring_the_enforcement_of_intellectual_property_rights.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061222010703/http://www.ip.mpg.de/shared/data/pdf/directive_of_the_european_parliament_and_of_the_council_on_criminal_measures_aimed_at_ensuring_the_enforcement_of_intellectual_property_rights.pdf |archivedate=2006-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The scope of the Directive is too wide (Article 2). The draft directive still applies to a broader range of intellectual property infringements than commercial piracy and counterfeiting. As a result, it is far broader than the current international standard for criminal IP enforcement — the 1994 TRIPs agreement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips_01_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Patents have recently been taken out of the scope but many other IP rights have not. Some of the latter are poorly suited to criminal regulation (such as database rights or conditional access to pay TV regimes).&lt;ref name="action.ffii.org"/&gt;
*The inclusion of aiding, abetting or inciting (Article 3) puts businesses at unnecessary risk of criminal liability.&lt;ref name="lawsociety.org.uk"/&gt;
*The sanctions provisions (Article 4) has been hastily put together and contains draconian measures poorly suited to intellectual property infringements.&lt;ref name="action.ffii.org"/&gt;

The Electronic Frontier Foundation has pointed out that criminal law is poorly suited for regulation of intellectual property law and that IPRED2 presents a risk to industry and innovation.&lt;ref name="eff.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/005139.php&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure]] (FFII), it is impossible not to violate [[software patent]]s, and the IPRED 2 directive threatens most of Europe's software developers with imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Unknown authors, [http://wiki.ffii.org/Ipred2Pr060512En ''EU Commission proposes to criminalise European software industry''], Cooperative Web Editing System (wiki) at FFII. Consulted on February 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2006, the [[States-General of the Netherlands|Dutch parliament]] wrote a letter to EU Commissioner Frattini with a thorough legal analysis of the proposed directive, concluding that the subject-matter of the proposed directive definitely falls outside the [[European Community]]’s competence (as defined in the EU treaties).&lt;ref&gt;Monika Ermert, [http://www.ip-watch.org/weblog/index.php?p=354&amp;res=1024_ff&amp;print=0 ''EU IP Enforcement Directive Questioned On Procedure''], Intellectual Property Watch, July 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SimpleDiagramPyrolysis.png|alt=Simplified Pyrolysis chemistry on burning wood|thumb|400x400px|Simplified depiction of pyrolysis chemistry]]
'''Pyrolysis''' is the [[thermal]] [[Chemical decomposition|decomposition]] of materials at elevated temperatures in an inert atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://goldbook.iupac.org/html/P/P04961.html |title=Compendium of Chemical Terminology |accessdate=2018-01-10 |year=2009 |page=1824 |publisher=[[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the change of [[chemical composition]] and is irreversible. The word is coined from the [[Greek language|Greek]]-derived [[morpheme|element]]s ''pyro'' "fire" and ''[[lysis]]'' "separating".

Pyrolysis is most commonly used to the treatment of [[organic compound|organic]] materials. It is one of the processes involved in [[charring]] wood.&lt;ref name=inno&gt;[http://virtual.vtt.fi/virtual/innofirewood/stateoftheart/database/burning/burning.html ''Burning of wood''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209095142/http://virtual.vtt.fi/virtual/innofirewood/stateoftheart/database/burning/burning.html |date=2010-02-09 }}, InnoFireWood's website. Accessed on 2010-02-06.&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, pyrolysis of organic substances produces volatile products and leaves a solid residue enriched in carbon, [[char]]. Extreme pyrolysis, which leaves mostly [[carbon]] as the residue, is called [[carbonization]].

The process is used heavily in the [[chemical industry]], for example, to produce [[ethylene]], many forms of [[carbon]], and other chemicals from petroleum, coal, and even wood, to produce [[coke (fuel)|coke]] from [[coal]].  Aspirational applications of pyrolysis would convert [[biomass]] into [[syngas]] and [[biochar]],  waste plastics back into usable oil, or waste into safely disposable substances.

==Process terminology and mechanism==
Special cases of pyrolysis include [[dry distillation]], [[destructive distillation]], [[cracking (chemistry)|cracking]], and [[thermal depolymerization]].  It generally involves the breaking of chemical bonds in molecules to give smaller molecules; but may also leave residues with larger molecular mass.  The phenomenon involves exceeding the [[decomposition temperature]] of the material.

Pyrolysis differs from other processes like [[combustion]] and [[hydrolysis]] in that it usually does not involve the addition of other reagents such as [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, in combustion) or water (in hydrolysis).&lt;ref&gt;Cory A. Kramer, Reza Loloee, Indrek S. Wichman and Ruby N. Ghosh, 2009, [http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1638571 Time Resolved Measurements of Pyrolysis Products From Thermoplastic Poly-Methyl-Methacrylate (PMMA)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106220719/http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1638571 |date=2014-11-06 }} ''ASME 2009 International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition''&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice, it is often not practical to achieve completely O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- or water-free conditions, especially as pyrolysis is often conducted on complex mixtures.  The term has also been applied to the decomposition of organic material in the presence of [[superheated water]] or steam ([[hydrous pyrolysis]]), for example, in the [[Cracking (chemistry)|steam cracking]] of oil. Pyrolysis has been assumed to take place during [[catagenesis (geology)|catagenesis]], the conversion of [[kerogen|buried organic matter]] to [[fossil fuels]]. 

Conversely, the starting material may be heated in a [[vacuum]] to decrease the [[boiling point]] of the byproducts and avoid adverse chemical reactions. An example is the process of [[flash vacuum pyrolysis]] used in [[organic synthesis]].

Volatile pyrolysis byproducts can be [[Chemical analysis|analyzed]] through separation by [[gas chromatography]] and identification by [[mass spectrometry]], a process known as [[pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry|Py-GC-MS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Goodacre, R.; Kell, D. B.|title=Pyrolysis mass spectrometry and its applications in biotechnology|journal=Curr. Opin. Biotechnol.|year=1996|volume=7||pages= 20-28|doi=10.1016/S0958-1669(96)80090-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Peacock, P. M.; McEwen, C. N.|title=Mass Spectrometry of Synthetic Polymers. Anal. Chem.|year=2006|volume=78|pages=3957-3964|doi=10.1021/ac0606249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pyrolysis is also used in [[carbon-14 dating]].

== Occurrence and uses ==
===Ethylene===
Pyrolysis is used to produce [[ethylene]], the chemical compound produced on the largest scale industrially (&gt;110 million tons/year in 2005).  In this process, hydrocarbons from petroleum are heated to around 600 °C in the presence of steam, i.e. [[steam cracking]].  The resulting ethylene is used to make antifreeze ([[ethylene glycol]]), PVC (via [[vinyl chloride]]), and many polymers, such as polyethylene and polystyrene.&lt;ref name=UllmannEthylene&gt;{{cite book |first1=Heinz |last1=Zimmermann |first2=Roland |last2=Walz |chapter=Ethylene |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Weinheim |year=2008 |doi=10.1002/14356007.a10_045.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coke, carbon, charcoals, and chars ===
Carbon and carbon-rich materials have desirable properties but are nonvolatile, even at high temperatures.  Consequently, pyrolysis is used to produce many kinds of carbon; these can be used for fuel, as reagents in steelmaking (coke), and as structural materials.

High temperature pyrolysis is used on an industrial scale to convert [[coal]] into [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] for [[metallurgy]], especially [[steelmaking]].  Volatile products are often useful, including [[benzene]] and [[pyridine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|authors=Ludwig Briesemeister, Andreas Geißler, Stefan Halama, Stephan Herrmann, Ulrich Kleinhans, Markus Steibel, Markus Ulbrich, Alan W. Scaroni, M. Rashid Khan, Semih Eser, Ljubisa R. Radovic|title=Coal Pyrolysis|encyclopedia=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2002|publisher=Wiley-VCH|place=Weinheim| doi=10.1002/14356007.a07_245.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coke can also be produced from the solid residue left from petroleum refining.
[[File:CoalPyrolysisProducts.png|thumb|290px|Typical organic products obtained by pyrolysis of coal (X = CH, N).]]
The coke-making or "coking" process consists of heating the material in "coking ovens" to very high temperatures (up to {{convert|900|C|F|disp=or|sigfig=2}}) so that those molecules are broken down into lighter volatile substances, which leave the vessel, and a porous but hard residue that is mostly carbon and inorganic ash. The amount of volatiles varies with the source material, but is typically 25–30% of it by weight.

The original [[xylem|vascular structure]] of the wood and the pores created by escaping gases combine to produce a light and porous material. By starting with a dense wood-like material, such as [[nutshell]]s or [[peach]] [[endocarp|stone]]s, one obtains a form of charcoal with particularly fine pores (and hence a much larger pore surface area), called [[activated carbon]], which is used as an [[adsorption|adsorbent]] for a wide range of chemical substances.

[[Biochar]] is the residue of incomplete organic pyrolysis, e.g., from cooking fires.  They are a key component of the [[terra preta]] soils associated with ancient [[indigenous peoples of Brazil|indigenous]] communities of the [[Amazon basin]].&lt;ref name="lehmann1"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Terra preta is much sought by local farmers for its superior fertility and capacity to promote and retain an enhanced suite of beneficial microbiota than the typical red soil of the region.  Efforts are underway to recreate these soils through [[biochar]], the solid residue of pyrolysis of various materials, mostly organic waste.

[[Carbon fiber]]s are filaments of carbon that can be used to make very strong yarns and textiles. Carbon fiber items are often produced by spinning and weaving the desired item from fibers of a suitable [[polymer]], and then pyrolyzing the material at a high temperature (from {{convert|1500|-|3000|°C|F|disp=or|sigfig=3}}).  The first carbon fibers were made from [[rayon]], but [[polyacrylonitrile]] has become the most common starting material.  For their first workable [[electric lamp]]s, [[Joseph Wilson Swan]] and [[Thomas Edison]] used carbon filaments made by pyrolysis of [[cotton]] yarns and [[bamboo]] splinters, respectively.

Pyrolysis is the reaction used to coat a preformed substrate with a layer of [[pyrolytic carbon]]. This is typically done in a fluidized bed reactor heated to {{convert|1000|-|2000|°C|F|disp=or|sigfig=3}}. Pyrolytic carbon coatings are used in many applications, including [[artificial heart valve]]s.&lt;ref name="ratner"&gt;Ratner, Buddy D. (2004). Pyrolytic carbon.

Other sources of [[organic matter]] as feedstock for pyrolysis include greenwaste, sawdust, waste wood, nut shells, straw, cotton trash, rice hulls. Animal waste including poultry litter, dairy manure, and potentially other manures are also under evaluation. Some industrial byproducts are also suitable feedstock including paper sludge and distillers grain.&lt;ref name=bestEnergiesBestPyrol&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  Higher efficiency is sometimes achieved by '''flash pyrolysis''', in which finely divided feedstock is quickly heated to between {{convert|350|and|500|°C|F|sigfig=2}} for less than two seconds. 

The low quality of oils produced through pyrolysis can be improved by physical and chemical processes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ramirez|first1=Jerome|last2=Brown|first2=Richard|last3=Rainey|first3=Thomas|title=A Review of Hydrothermal Liquefaction Bio-Crude Properties and Prospects for Upgrading to Transportation Fuels|journal=Energies|date=1 July 2015|volume=8|pages=6765–6794|doi=10.3390/en8076765}}&lt;/ref&gt; which might drive up production costs, but may make sense economically as circumstances change.

&lt;/ref&gt;  Fuel bio-oil can also be produced by [[hydrous pyrolysis]].

=== Semiconductors ===
The process of [[metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy]] (MOCVD) entails pyrolysis of volatile organometallic compounds to give semiconductors, hard coatings, and other applicable materials.  The reactions entail thermal degradation of precursors, with deposition of the inorganic component and release of the hydrocarbons as gaseous waste. Since it is an atom-by-atom deposition, these atoms organize themselves into crystals to form the bulk semiconductor. Silicon chips are produced by the pyrolysis of silane:
:SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  →  Si  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
[[Gallium arsenide]], another semiconductor, forms upon co-pyrolysis of [[trimethylgallium]] and [[arsine]].
[[Image:MOCVDprocess.jpg|thumb|300 px|Illustration of the MOCVD process, which entails pyrolysis of volatile ]]

=== Recycling===
{{See also|Thermal Depolymerisation}}
Pyrolysis can also be used to treat plastic waste.  The main advantage is the reduction in volume of the waste.  In principle, pyrolysis will regenerate the monomers (precursors) to the polymers that are treated, but in practice the process is neither a clean nor an economically competitive source of monomers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first1=Walter |last1=Kaminsky |title=Plastics, Recycling |encyclopedia=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Weinheim |year=2000 |doi=10.1002/14356007.a21_057}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N.J.

=== Thermal cleaning ===
{{See also|Thermal cleaning}}
Pyrolysis is also used for ''thermal cleaning'', an industrial application to remove [[Organic chemistry|organic]] substances such as [[polymer]]s, [[plastic]]s and [[coating]]s from parts, products or production components like [[Plastics extrusion|extruder screws]], [[Spinneret (polymers)|spinnerets]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fiberjournal.com/back-issues/ |title=Effective Spinneret Cleaning |author=Heffungs, Udo |date=June 2010 |publisher=Fiber Journal |access-date=19 April 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630015337/http://www.fiberjournal.com/back-issues/ |archivedate=30 June 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[static mixer]]s.

Several types of thermal cleaning systems use pyrolysis:
* ''Molten Salt Baths'' belong to the oldest thermal cleaning systems; cleaning with a [[molten salt]] bath is very fast but implies the risk of dangerous splatters, or other potential hazards connected with the use of salt baths, like explosions or highly toxic [[hydrogen cyanide]] gas.&lt;ref name="Mainord1994" /&gt;

==Fine chemical synthesis==
Pyrolysis is used in the production of chemical compounds, mainly, but not only, in the research laboratory.  

The area of boron-hydride clusters started with the study of the pyrolysis of [[diborane]] (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) at ca. 200 °C.  Products include the clusters  [[pentaborane]] and [[decaborane]].  These pyrolyses involve not only cracking (to give H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), but also re[[condensation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}} gives Greenwood, Norman N.; Earnshaw, Alan (1997).

==History==
Pyrolysis has been used for turning wood into [[charcoal]] since ancient times. Many important chemical substances, such as [[phosphorus]] and [[sulfuric acid]], were first obtained by this process. In their embalming process, the ancient Egyptians used methanol, which they obtained from the pyrolysis of wood.  The dry distillation of wood remained the major source of methanol into the early 20th Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |authors=E. Fiedler, G. Grossmann, D. B. Kersebohm, G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7506">In [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking areas, a '''''schout''''' was a local official appointed to carry out administrative, law enforcement and prosecutorial tasks. The office was abolished with the introduction of administrative reforms during the Napoleonic period.
[[File:Schout en schepenen van Alkemade 1806.JPG|thumb|450px|"Schout en scheepenen van Alkemade" as printed on an 1806 Dutch marriage document]]

==Functions==

The exact nature of the office varied from place to place and changed over the course of time. In general, a ''schout'' was appointed by the lord (''heer'') of a domain (''[[heerlijkheid]]'') and acted in the lord's name in the local day-to-day administration of the domain, especially the administration of justice. A ''schout'' had three main functions: administration, law enforcement and criminal prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;As a specific example of how a ''schout'' functioned in a specific town, see the description of the office of ''schout'' in Leiden in R.C.J. van Maanen, ed., ''Leiden tot 1574'', p. 75 (written in Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt;

First, the ''schout'' was responsible for many local administrative matters in the town or [[heerlijkheid]]. The ''schout'' presided in the meetings of the ''[[schepenen]]''. Together, the ''schout'' and ''[[schepenen]]'' made up what we would call the "town council" today. He ensured decrees were published. He sometimes represented the town or [[heerlijkheid]] in business matters or in negotiations with other towns. In these functions, a ''schout'' was somewhat like a modern-day [[mayor]].

The phrase ''schout en schepenen'' appears in many legal documents from before the Napoleonic period, including the civil registration of marriages. Depending on the context and in what capacity they were acting, this phrase could mean something like the "mayor and aldermen" (i.e. the town council) or it could mean "the sheriff and magistrates".
 
Second, the ''schout'' was responsible for [[public order]] and [[policing]]. He was responsible for investigating a [[crime]], apprehending a criminal and presenting the criminal to the court of [[magistrates]] (''[[schepenen]]'') for judgment. He or his men checked the drinking houses, carried out [[conscription]] orders, made sure [[taxes]] were paid and enforced the law. After a criminal verdict was given, the ''schout'' was responsible for carrying out the sentence. In these functions, he was somewhat like a modern-day [[chief of police]].

Third, a ''schout'' prosecuted suspected criminals and presided over the sessions of the [[magistrates]] (''[[schepenen]]'') when they sat as a court. The ''schout'' was not the judge, but directed the court proceedings. In this function, he was somewhat like a modern-day [[prosecutor]].

== New Amsterdam ==

The office was brought with the Dutch to the American colony of [[New Netherland]]. The first ''schout'' (sometimes called the ''schout-fiscal'') in New Amsterdam after it was granted the authority to form its own local government in 1652 was [[Cornelis van Tienhoven]], although officers were appointed to the post from at least 1626 when Jan Lampo was appointed.&lt;ref name=NAREG1865&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Callaghan|first1=E. B.|title=The Register of New Netherland; 1626 to 1674|date=1865|publisher=J. Munsell|location=Albany, NY, USA|url=https://archive.org/details/registerofnewnet00ocal|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''schout'' had a seat on the Executive Council, but no vote, and would step down from the bench when acting as prosecutor, at which time the remaining members of the Council would function as the Court of Justice.&lt;ref name=NAREG1865 /&gt; The final ''schout'' was William Knyff, who held the office in 1674 when the English re-conquered the colony.&lt;ref name=NAREG1865 /&gt;

The origins of the American public prosecutor ([[attorney general]]) have been traced to the ''schout'' in [[New Amsterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  journal|journal=The Prosecutor|url=http://www.mcaa-mn.org/docs/2005/AmericanProsecutorHistoricalContext52705.pdf|format=PDF|title=The American Prosecutor in Historical Context|author=Joan E.

''Schout'' is the word usually used in Dutch, but there were a number of other terms used for this or similar offices in Dutch-speaking lands. The terms used included
''schout'', ''[[baljuw]]'', ''[[drost]]'', ''[[drossaard]]'', ''amman'' and ''[[meier]]''. Perhaps the most common alternative name for this office in Dutch was ''[[baljuw]]''.&lt;ref&gt;I.M. Calisch and N.S. Calisch, ''Nieuw Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal'', 1864&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Baljuw]]'' is usually translated into English as "[[bailiff]]".&lt;ref name="van dale"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Van Dale]]|title=Groot Woordenboek Nederlands-Engels|isbn=90-6648-147-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''schout'', depending on its context, can be translated variously into English, usually as ''sheriff'', ''bailiff'', or ''reeve'', but strictly in their respective medieval senses.&lt;ref name="van dale"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example, see [[Simon Schama]], ''[[The Embarrassment of Riches: An Interpretation of Dutch Culture in the Golden Age|The Embarrassment of Riches]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Dutch word is sometimes used in English (even though ''schout'' is not actually a word in English).&lt;ref&gt;For example, see Russell Shorto, ''The Island at the Centre of the World'' and David Nicholas, ''Medieval Flanders''.&lt;/ref&gt; In Dutch, the plural of ''schout'' is ''schouten''.

The Dutch word ''schout'' comes from [[Middle Dutch]] ''scouthete'', in turn from [[Old Dutch|Old Low Franconian]] ''skolthēti'', and is cognate with Old English ''scyldhǣta'', ''sculthēta'' "reeve, (medieval) bailiff", German ''[[Schultheiss|Schultheiß]]'', (Swiss) ''Schulze'' "bailie (magistrate)", from [[Proto-Germanic language|PGmc]] *''skuldi-haitijō'' "debt-orderer". The office was occasionally referred to in Latin as ''scultetus''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2882">'''Sealed birth records''', as opposed to open records, refers to the practice of sealing the original [[birth certificate]] of an [[infant]] upon [[adoption]]. The original sealed birth certificate is replaced with an amended birth certificate declaring the [[adoptee]] to be the child of his or her adoptive parents. Many states, provinces and countries adopted this practice in the early to mid-20th century with the aim of protecting the adopted person from the shame of his or her [[illegitimate]] birth. Sealed or closed birth records are generally associated with [[closed adoption]]. Open records is generally referred to as the practice of opening original birth records to adult adoptees, and should not be confused with open adoption, which can occur with or without sealed records, depending on the laws of the state or province in which it is carried out.

Many nations have granted adult adoptees unfettered access to their original birth certificates. Mike Leigh's Oscar-nominated film ''[[Secrets &amp; Lies (film)|Secrets &amp; Lies]]'' (1996) revolves around a British woman who accesses her original birth certificate.

==History==
===United States===
Adoptee birth certificates were first sealed in the United States in 1917&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uoregon.edu/~adoption/archive/MNadoptionlaw.htm Minnesota Adoption Law 1917]&lt;/ref&gt; for the purpose of protecting adopted people and their adoptive families from the stigma of [[illegitimate]] birth.  After World War II, the laws in most states were changed to permanently seal adoptees' original birth certificates to all parties.  Kansas and Alaska never sealed adoptees' original birth certificates and many states and provinces of the U.S. and Canada have recently begun return the right of adult adoptees to access their original birth certificates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanadoptioncongress.org/reform_adoption_data.php Adoption Data from States Who Have Enacted Access] from the [[American Adoption Congress]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
The history of sealed birth records in Canada mirrors that of the United States. It is complicated by the forced adoptions of Native American children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1357826/Native-American/273112/The-outplacement-and-adoption-of-indigenous-children Native American: The outplacement and adoption of indigenous children indigenous peoples of Canada and United States], Encyclopædia Britannica online&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10184">The term "'''soft law'''" refers to quasi-legal instruments which do not have any legally binding force, or whose binding force is somewhat weaker than the binding force of traditional law, often contrasted with soft law by being referred to as "[[hard law]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Druzin|first=B.|year=2016|title=Why does Soft Law have any Power anyway?|url=https://works.bepress.com/bryan_druzin/22/download/|journal=Asian Journal of International Law|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the term "soft law" is associated with [[international law]], although more recently it has been transferred to other branches of domestic [[law]] as well.

==  International law ==

=== Definition ===

In the context of international law, the term "soft law" covers such elements as:

* Most Resolutions and Declarations of the [[UN General Assembly]]
* Elements such as statements, principles, code of practice etc.; often found as part of framework treaties;
* Action plans (for example, [[Agenda 21]], [[Financial Action Task Force]] Recommendations);
* Other non-treaty obligations

==== European Union and the Council of Europe ====

The term "soft law" is also often used to describe various kinds of quasi-legal instruments of the [[European Union]]: "codes of conduct", "guidelines", "communications" etc. In the area of law of the European Union, soft law instruments are often used to indicate how the [[European Commission]] intends to use its powers and perform its tasks within its area of competence. The resolutions and recommendations of the [[Council of Europe]] are also soft law. These represent the views of the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]], but are not legally binding for the 47 member states.

By contrast, the European Union [[Directive (European Union)|directives]] are legally binding. The conventions of the Council of Europe are also legally binding for those countries which choose to ratify them, but countries are not forced to ratify them.

=== Status ===

In international law, the terminology of "soft law" remains relatively controversial because there are some international practitioners who do not accept its existence and for others, there is quite some confusion as to its status in the realm of law. However, for most international practitioners, development of soft law instruments is an accepted part of the compromises required when undertaking daily work within the international legal system, where states are often reluctant to sign up to too many commitments that might result in national resentment at over-committing to an international goal.

=== Utility ===

Soft law instruments are usually considered as non-binding agreements which nevertheless hold much potential for morphing into "[[hard law]]" in the future. This "hardening" of soft law may happen in two different ways. One is when declarations, recommendations, etc. are the first step towards a treaty-making process, in which reference will be made to the principles already stated in the soft law instruments. Another possibility is that non-treaty agreements are intended to have a direct influence on the practice of states, and to the extent that they are successful in doing so, they may lead to the creation of customary law. Soft law is a convenient option for negotiations that might otherwise stall if legally binding commitments were sought  at a time when it is not convenient for negotiating parties to make major commitments at a certain point in time for political and/or economic reasons but still wish to negotiate something in [[good faith]] in the meantime.

Soft law is also viewed as a flexible option - it avoids the immediate and uncompromising commitment made under treaties and it also is considered to be potentially a faster route to legal commitments than the slow pace of [[customary international law]]. With the passage of time, in today's globalized society it is easy to use the media and the internet to spread the knowledge of the content of declarations and commitments made at international conferences. In doing so, these aspirational non-commitments often capture the imagination of citizens who begin to believe in these soft law instruments as if they were legal instruments. In turn, it is felt that this ultimately impacts governments who are forced to take into account the wishes of citizens, NGOs, organizations, courts and even corporations who begin to refer to these soft law instruments so frequently and with such import that they begin to evidence legal norms.

Another useful aspect of the nature of soft law is that it often can be used to evidence [[opinio juris]] on applying or interpreting a [[treaty]].

Soft law has been very important in the field of [[international environmental law]] where states have been reluctant to commit to many environmental initiatives when trying to balance the environment against economic and social goals. It is also important in the field of [[international economic law]] and international [[sustainable development]] law. Soft law is also important in human resource management related matters such as gender equality, diversity and other topics (health and safety for instance). In social matters, so-called 'binding' legislations often leave considerable room for discretion and interpretation, whereas sometimes, 'soft law' instruments can be imposed by powerful stakeholders on their suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;Klarsfeld, A., &amp; Delpuech, C. (2008). La RSE au-delà de l'opposition entre volontarisme et contrainte: l'apport de la théorie de la régulation sociale et de la théorie néo-institutionnelle. Revue de l’organisation responsable, 3(1), 53-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Using care with reliance ==

Soft law is attractive because it often contains aspirational goals that aim for the best of possible scenarios.  However, the language in many soft law documents can be contradictory, uncoordinated with existing legal commitments and potentially duplicative of existing legal or policy processes. Another key point is that negotiating parties are not blind to the potential lying in stealth in soft law. If a negotiating party feels that soft law has a potential to turn into something binding down the track, this will negatively influence the negotiation process, and soft law instruments will be watered down and hemmed in by so many restrictions that there is little point in creating them.

Nevertheless, the reliance on soft law continues and it is unlikely that its use will fade; it is far more likely to be relied on in greater amounts as it also serves as a "testing ground" for new, innovative ideas that policy formulations are still being worked out for in a world of rapid change and future upcoming contentious challenges such as [[climate change]].

The '''Sophie Digital Library''' is a [[digital library]] and resource center for works produced by German-speaking women pre-17th century through the early 20th century, a group that has often been underrepresented in collections of historical printed works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Making Great Work even Better: Appraisal and Digital Curation of Widely-Dispersed Electronic Textual Resources (ca. 15th-19th Centuries in CLARIN-D. in Jost Gippert et al.

Resources available at the site include literary and journalistic texts (including some English translations), [[Sheet music|musical scores]] and recordings, screenplays and dramas, and a collection of colonial/travel texts. There is also an image gallery containing portraits and photographs of the artists and illustrations from some of the works. Most of the texts included in its collection are the full texts of public domain books. The project tries to make these as free as possible, in long-lasting, easy to use, open formats which can be used on any computer. The collection provides the texts as aids for research and teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Women Write Back: Strategies of Response and the Dynamics of European Literary Culture 1790-1805.|last = Hilger|first = Stephanie M.|publisher = Editions Rodopi|year = 2009|isbn = 978-90-420-2578-3|location = New York|pages = 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Soviet of Nationalities''' ({{lang-ru|Совет Национальностей}}, ''Sovyet Natsionalnostey''&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-uk|Раду Національностей}}; {{lang-be|Савет Нацыянальнасцей}}; {{lang-lt|Tautybių Taryba}}; {{lang-mo|Советул Националитэцилор}}; {{lang-lv|Tautību Padome}}; {{lang-tk|Миллетлер Совети}}; {{lang-et|Rahvuste Nõukogu}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was the [[Upper house|upper]] [[chambers of parliament|chamber]] of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]] of the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]], elected on the basis of [[Universal suffrage|universal]], equal and [[Direct election|direct]] [[suffrage]] by [[secret ballot]] in accordance with the principles of [[Soviet democracy]]. Until [[Glasnost]] and the [[Soviet Union legislative election, 1989|1989 elections]], however, only candidates approved by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] were permitted to participate in the elections. It was briefly succeeded by the '''Soviet of the Republics''' from October to December of 1991.

As opposed to the [[Soviet of the Union]], the Soviet of Nationalities was composed of the nationalities of the Soviet Union, which in turn followed administrative division rather than being a representation of ethnic groups. 

The Soviet of the Nationalities was formed on the basis of equal representation of all the [[Republics of the Soviet Union]] (32 deputies from each republic, excluding other autonomous units inside that republic which sent in separate members), [[Autonomous republics of the Soviet Union|autonomous republic]]s (11 deputies from each republic), [[Autonomous oblasts of the Soviet Union|autonomous oblast]]s (five deputies from each [[oblast]]), and national districts (one deputy from each [[district]]). As a result, the largest republic, the [[Russian SFSR]] with a population of 147 million, and the smallest republic, the [[Estonian SSR]] with a population of about 1.5 million, got 32 deputies each. [[Russians]] as an ethnic group made up more than half of the population of the Soviet Union, but the Soviet of Nationalities did not represent ethnic groups, it represented the different nationalities as expressed by the republics and various autonomous units of the Soviet Union. This electoral system seriously diminished representation of larger ethnic groups in favor of the smaller ethnic groups of the Soviet Union, with the Russians being most underrepresented.

The Soviet of Nationalities enjoyed the same rights as the [[Soviet of the Union]] in the area of [[legislative]] initiative and in resolving other issues inside the [[Jurisdiction|competence]] of the Soviet Union. In practice, until 1989, it did little more than approve decisions already made by the top leadership of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. After the [[Soviet Union legislative election, 1989|1989 elections]]–the first, and as it turned out, only, free elections ever held in the Soviet Union–the Soviet of Nationalities acquired a much greater role, and was the scene of many lively debates.

The Soviet of Nationalities elected a [[chairman]] (who would lead the sessions of the chamber), his four deputies, and permanent [[committee|commission]]s: Mandate Commission, Commission on Legislative Suppositions, [[Budget]] Planning Commission, [[Foreign Affairs]] Commission, Youth Affairs Commission, Industry Commission, Transportation and Communications Commission, Construction and Industry of [[Building Materials]] Commission, [[Agricultural]] Commission, [[Consumer goods|Consumer Goods]] Commission, [[Public Education]] Commission, Science and Culture Commission, Trade Commission, Consumer Service and Municipal Economy Commission, [[Natural environment|Environment]]al Commission.

The presidium of the Soviet of Nationalities "ceased all noticeable work at the end of 1937," but it did "survive as the sole central political institution formally devoted to the nationalities question."&lt;ref&gt;Terry Martin, ''The Affirmative Action Empire: Nations and Nationalism in the Soviet Union, 1923-1939'' (Cornell University Press, 2001: {{ISBN|0-8014-8677-7}}), p. 412.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 26, 1991, the Soviet of the Republics adopted a resolution declaring that the Soviet Union [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|no longer existed]] as a functioning state and voted both itself and the Soviet Union out of existence. The Soviet of the Union had effectively been dissolved two weeks earlier when Russia recalled its deputies, leaving it without a quorum. The Soviet of the Republics' declaration was thus the final legal step in the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

According to the [[Coalition Against Insurance Fraud]], staged car crashes are a growing criminal problem.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}{{when|date=July 2015}}

Drivers maneuver unsuspecting motorists into crashes in order to make false insurance claims. The cars generally suffer little damage in relation to the large demand that is then fraudulently submitted. In 2011, a group of seven people in North and South Carolina were arrested for allegedly stealing over $100,000 through staged crash schemes.&lt;ref&gt;North Carolina Department of Insurance, [http://www.ncdoi.com/media/news2/year/2011/090811.asp “Department of Insurance Investigators Break up Alleged Staged Accident Ring.”], North Carolina Department of Insurance, September 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Varieties of the Scams ==

* ''' The “Swoop and Squat” ''' scheme involves two cars: one drives beside the victim, while the other ‘swoops’ in front of the victim car and stops suddenly, causing a rear-end crash. The first car is usually full of accomplices who will claim that they were injured even if it was only a low-speed crash, submitting fraudulent claims to the insurance company. The swoop car is usually driven by an experienced ring member, while the “squat” car is generally full of either accomplices, or victims.&lt;ref&gt;Lascher, Edward L. and Michael R. Powers. TBH Springer, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s poor Hispanic immigrants were recruited to drive the swoop cars: a high-risk job that nobody wanted, but for which the immigrants could be paid only $100. One such driver, Jose Luis Lopez Perez, died after a swoop and squat crash, leading to an investigation which revealed massive amounts of this fraud.&lt;ref&gt;Dornstein, Ken. “Accidentally, on Purpose: The Making of a Personal Injury Underworld in America.” Palgrave Macmillan, 1998, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''' The “Panic Stop” ''' requires two merging traffic lanes. As one driver tries to merge into the next lane, he is waved forward by a car who proceeds to crash into the unsuspecting driver, later claiming they never realized the person was going to merge lanes.&lt;ref&gt;Danielle A. Alvarez, [http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/broward/fl-staged-crashes-demo-20110915,0,697974.story “Florida officials, insurers demonstrate staged car crash”], “Sun Sentinel”,  September 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''' The "Sideswipe" ''' involves a victim car who drifts into the adjacent lane while making a turn. The perpetrator of this fraud rushes to crash into the car that just drifted into his/her lane. Claiming innocence, the perpetrator then submits a claim to their insurer.&lt;ref&gt;Lesch, William C. “Consumer insurance fraud in the US property-casualty industry.” Journal of Financial Crime, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''' “Shady Helpers” ''' is a form of [[ambulance chasing]] that usually happens after a genuine crash has occurred. A fraud runner will solicit a crash victim and advertise the services of specific repair shops, chiropractors, or lawyers. These, in turn, will submit fraudulent claims on the victim’s behalf or deceive the victim into undergoing unnecessary treatments or lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;Dyer, N. “Staged Traffic Collisions and Automobile Insurance Fraud.” Police Chief Journal, Volume:61  Issue:7. July 1994. P.51-54&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''' “Crash For Cash Scams” ''' Crash for cash scammers choose their victims carefully – they keep an eye out for drivers who look like they would be fully insured but be less likely to cause a fuss. The criminals put you in the situation is a car in front of you slams on the brakes for no obvious reason, and you have no time to react and collide with the car in front. Another scenario (known as ‘flash for cash’) happens when a driver flashes their lights at a junction to let you out, then crashes into you deliberately. The other driver will insist the accident is your fault. The scammer will then hand over their insurance details – sometimes already prepared and written down. A few weeks after the accident your insurers will write to you with details of the other driver’s claim which will be exaggerated with costs like car hire, recovery and whiplash injuries.&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Regis, [https://www.comparevaninsurance.com/blog/crash-cash-scams/ “Crash For Cash Scams”], “Compare Van Insurance”,  February 20, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission of Kenya (TJRC)''' was established in 2008. [[Kenya]]’s modern history has been marked not only by liberation struggles but also by ethnic conflicts, semi-despotic regimes, marginalization and political violence, including the coup d'état of 1982, the [[Shifta War]], and the 2007 Post-election violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dialoguekenya.org/docs/PEV%20Report.pdf Post Election Violence in Kenya]. Dialogue Kenya&lt;/ref&gt;

The toll of the 2007 Post-election violence included approximately 1,500 deaths, 3,000 rapes, and 300,000 people left internally displaced. The most severe episode of this conflict unfolded over 59 days between Election Day, 27 December 2007 and 28 February 2008. A political compromise was reached that saw the two conflicting parties sign a National Accord, following the mediation efforts by the [[African Union]] Panel of Eminent African Personalities chaired by Mr. [[Kofi Annan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://south.co.ke/NationalAccord.aspx Kenya National Dialogue and Reconciliation Monitoring Project]. south.co.ke&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Despite the reputation of the [[Rift valley]] as the cradle of humanity and positive co-existence, the peoples living there suffered through mass human rights violations in the later part of the 20th century. The mass violence in Kenya occurred throughout a period of over 40 years making it difficult to define concretely as post-election violence. To understand the events following the 1992 and 2007 elections in Kenya, one must first understand the complicated ethnic makeup of the Kenyan state. The two tribes primarily involved in the political violence are the [[Kikuyu people]] (22 percent of the 2008 Kenyan population) and the [[Kalenjin people]] (12 percent of the 2008 Kenyan population), however many other smaller tribes also inhabit Kenya. These ethnic tensions originate in events occurring before independence when British colonists forced the Kalenjin pastoral tribe off their land to develop the Rift Valley agriculturally. With the colonists came Kikuyu farmers to work as sharecroppers in the British fields. Continued competition for economic wealth and power also drove the two tribes apart.

Later when selecting government officials after independence in 1963, the tension between these two tribes increased as, Jomo Kenyatta, a Kikuyu, became president and Daniel Moi, a Kalenjin, became vice-president. After Kenyatta's death, Moi took power and tightened his hold on Kenya through censoring and human rights violations. In 1991 a constitutional reform passed allowing for multipartyism in Kenya. Shortly after in 1992 the first multi-party election since independence took place. Moi won the elections but many doubted the legitimacy of his victory. Violence ensued as Kalenjin supporters of Moi raped, killed, and displaced Kikuyu opposition supporters. Despite Kalenjin attacks on Kikuyu making up the majority of the ethnic violence in Kenya, ethnic conflicts between tribes remained much more complicated. This violence persisted long after the 1992 election with postelection violence reports in 1998, 2002, and 2007. Similar to the 1992 election, in December 2007 incumbent president Mwai Kibaki won an election called “deeply flawed” by observers.&lt;ref name=nyt20080131gettle&gt;Jeffrey Gettleman (31 January 2008) [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/31/world/africa/31kenya.html "Official Sees kenyan Ethnic Cleansing"]. ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; The Kalenjin, who supported the opposition leader Raila Odinga, burned down the houses and hacked to death Kikuyus who supported Mr. Kibaki. Weeks after the election, Kikuyus violently took revenge forcing other ethnic groups out of Kikuyu dominated areas. This post election violence took the lives of over 800 people and displaced at least 300,000.&lt;ref name=nyt20080131gettle/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T.

===1992 Post-election violence===
{{See also|Kenyan general election, 1992}}
[[File:Daniel arap Moi 1979c.jpg|thumb|President Daniel Arap Moi in 1979]]
The 1992 multiparty General Elections were riddled with irregularities with some opposition candidates even being physically prevented from presenting their nomination papers. The incumbent, then President [[Daniel Arap Moi]], campaign freely all over the country while other party leaders could not. Where the opposition could not campaign freely, President Moi traversed the country using government resources. Moreover, he enjoyed a monopoly of media coverage from the official broadcaster, the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC). In addition, the Electoral Commission was made up of presidential appointees whose loyalty to the incumbent was never in doubt. The most notorious instance of interference with the electoral process was the 1988 General Elections where many losing candidates were declared winners. The then sole ruling party, KANU, had already secured the monopoly for political power through a constitutional amendment in 1982 that made it the sole political party.
In the 1991 clashes, non-Kalenjin and non-Maasai ethnic groups were “attacked, their houses set on fire, their properties looted and in certain instances, some of them were killed or severely injured with traditional weapons like bows and arrows, spears, pangas, swords and clubs.” In its investigations, witnesses told the [[Kenya National Commission on Human Rights]], (KNCHR), that violent clashes between the Kalenjin, on the one hand, and the Kikuyu and Kisii on the other, began in 1992. These clashes pitted these groups along ethnic lines as well as on political lines. In 1992, the Kalenjin were overwhelmingly members of the then ruling party, the Kenya African National Union, (KANU). President Daniel Arap Moi, a member of the Kalenjin community, was the President of KANU and the country. He was opposed to the introduction of multi-party politics in the country and the existence of opposition political parties particularly in the Rift Valley. Many non-Kalenjin and non-Maasai communities in the Rift Valley supported the then budding opposition parties. The Akiwumi report on the 1992 clashes reported that the provincial administration was partisan in its support of the then KANU government and against those considered to be opposed to KANU in the Rift Valley. In 1992 the provincial administration also showed open partisanship in favour of KANU.&lt;ref name="knchr.org"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100602190448/http://www.knchr.org/dmdocuments/KNCHR doc.pdf  "On the Brink of the Precipice: A Human Rights Account of Kenya's Post-2007 Election Violence"]. Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, 15 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1997 Post-election violence===
{{See also|Kenyan general election, 1997}}
[[File:Coat of arms of Kenya (Official).svg|thumb|Kenyan Coat of Arms]]

In December 1997, Kenyans went to the polls to elect members of parliament and the country's president. The elections were conducted in the glare of international publicity, not least because the international community was seriously concerned about whether the elections would be free and fair. Despite evidence of electoral irregularities, political violence and a legal framework which favoured the incumbent government, observers of the elections endorsed the resulting victory of President Moi and the Kenya African National Union (KANU) as being an expression of the will of the people.

In the wake of the elections, there rapidly followed a waning of international interest in political developments in Kenya. This was despite the fact that within a month of the elections, politically motivated ethnic 'clashes' erupted in Rift Valley Province. The violence left hundreds of people dead or injured, and thousands of others displaced from their homes and living in makeshift shelters. It was clear that this violence was following a pattern similar to that encountered during previous outbreaks of conflict in Kenya between 1991 and 1994 – prior to and after the country's first multi-party elections in 1992— in which predominantly Kalenjin supporters of KANU attacked members of ostensibly ‘pro-opposition’ ethnic groups. The important difference between then and now was that for the first time, members of a ‘pro-opposition’ ethnic group, the Kikuyus, were organising and actively fighting back.

Although the 1997 elections passed off with less violence than had been the case in 1992, events in January 1998 put paid to any hopes that political violence might be a thing of the past in Kenya. On the night of 11 January 1998, some members of the [[Pokot people|Pokot]] and [[Samburu people|Samburu]] ethnic groups raided the home of a [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] widow at a place called Mirgwit in the [[Laikipia]] District of the Rift Valley Province. The raiders raped the woman and stole some livestock from the household. A group of Kikuyu men followed the raiders but, having failed to catch up with them, entered a Samburu compound where, in retaliation, they mutilated livestock that they found there. Mutilation of livestock is highly taboo for pastoralists such as the Samburu and Pokot. Accordingly, it was almost inevitable that there would be some kind of response by the owners of the livestock.

On the night of 13 January 1998, some Pokot and Samburu men attacked Kikuyu communities in the Magande, Survey, Motala, Milimani and Mirgwit areas of Ol Moran in Laikipia. It appears that the attackers were armed not only with spears, bows and arrows, but also with guns. It was claimed that some of the attackers were dressed in military-type clothing. It has been estimated that over 50 Kikuyus were killed during these attacks and over 1000 others fled the area and sought refuge at the Roman Catholic Church at Kinamba, from where they were later relocated to temporary shelters at Sipili and Ol Moran.
On 21 January, about 70 unidentified people invaded three farms in Njoro including one belonging to the newly elected DP Member of Parliament for Molo Constituency, Kihika Kimani. Three days later, groups of what local residents described as Kalenjins attacked Kikuyus in parts of Njoro in the same constituency. There were varying explanations given for these attacks. One version of events blamed them on the refusal of local Kikuyu traders to supply goods and services to Kalenjins in response to the events in Laikipia. Another suggested that this was simply an unprovoked attack on Kikuyus by local Kalenjin youths. The attack on Kikuyus on 24 January provoked a counter-attack by a group of apparently wellorganised Kikuyus, who on 25 January attacked Kalenjin residents of Naishi/Lare in Njoro.

According to police reports, 34 Kikuyus and 48 Kalenjins were killed during these initial attacks and over 200 houses were burnt down. Hundreds of people from both communities were displaced by the fighting, and many of them fled to temporary 'camps' at Kigonor, Sururu, Larmudiac mission and Mauche. During its visit to Kenya the joint mission witnessed the very poor conditions in which displaced people in these camps were living. Sporadic fighting continued during February and March 1998. By 11 March, police reports were estimating that at least 127 people had been killed since the 'clashes' had begun in January.&lt;ref&gt;Daily Nation, 11 March 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edge Kanyongolo (December 1998) [http://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/publications/kenya-post-election-political-violence.pdf "Kenya: Post-election political violence"]. Article  19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007 Post-election violence===
{{See also|Kenyan general election, 2007|2007–2008 Kenyan crisis}}
Whereas between 1992 and 2002 most election related violence occurred during the pre-election phase at the time of voter registration, party campaigns and nominations, the 2007 elections were characterised by excessive violence, and crimes against humanity, especially after the declaration of Mwai Kibaki of the Party of National Unity (PNU) as president in the contested results. 
The 2007–08 post-election violence shook the nation because of its spread, speed and ruthlessness. The closely contested presidential election was characterised by unrealistic promises, fragmentation, balkanisation, media hype and strong expressions of ethnic nationalism. Inspired and propelled by the rejection of the 2005 Referendum on a government sponsored constitution, the main opposition party went full throttle to wrest power form the incumbent in the general elections.&lt;ref&gt;Kimani Kjogu, Healing the Wound: Personal Narrative About the 2007  Post-Election Violence (Nairobi: Twaweza Communications, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2007–2008 Kenyan crisis]] refers to a political, economic, and humanitarian crisis that erupted in Kenya after incumbent President Mwai Kibaki was declared the winner of the presidential election held on 27 December 2007. Supporters of Kibaki's opponent, Raila Odinga of the Orange Democratic Movement, alleged electoral manipulation. This was widely confirmed by international observers, perpetrated by both parties in the election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7268903.stm "Kenya rivals agree to share power"]. BBC News. 28 February 2008. Archived from the original on 29 February 2008. Retrieved 1 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wangui Kanina (18 September 2008) [http://uk.reuters.com/article/2008/09/18/uk-kenya-election-idUKLI38786120080918 "Kenya's election seen as badly flawed"]. Reuters.&lt;/ref&gt;

In part due to the ethnic and geographic diversity of the ODM coalition, no one narrative can explain the reaction of opposition supporters to the announcement of Kibaki's swearing-in. In addition to staging several nonviolent protests, opposition supporters went on a violent rampage in several parts of the country, most noticeably in Odinga's homeland of Nyanza Province and the slums of Nairobi, part of his Langata constituency. Police shot a number of demonstrators, including a few in front of TV news cameras, causing more violence directed toward the police.&lt;ref&gt;"Police kill unarmed civilian". KTN. 16 January 2008. Retrieved 2008-07-11. (AFP) – 26 January 2008 (26 January 2008). "AFP: Politician's portrait marks border in Kenyan slum". Afp.google.com. Retrieved 2010-05-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

Targeted ethnic violence (as opposed to violent protests) escalated and at first was directed mainly against Kikuyu people – the community of which Kibaki is a member – living outside their traditional settlement areas, especially in the Rift Valley Province. This violence peaked with the killing of over 30 unarmed civilians in a church near Eldoret on New Years Day. Tensions in the Rift Valley have caused violence in several previous Kenyan elections, most notably in the 1992 Kenyan Elections. Some of the Kikuyu also engaged in retaliatory violence against groups supportive of Odinga, primarily Luos and Kalenjin, especially in the areas surrounding Nakuru and Naivasha.

In Mombasa, Muslim Kenyans took to the streets to protest the electoral manipulations and air their own grievances, though ethnic tensions played much less of a role in these protests. Looters also struck a number of stores in Mombasa. The slums of Nairobi saw some of the worst violence, some of this ethnically motivated attacks, some simple outrage at extreme poverty, and some the actions of criminal gangs. The violence continued sporadically for several months, particularly in the Rift Valley.

Former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan arrived in the country nearly a month after the election, and successfully brought the two sides to the negotiating table. On 28 February 2008, Kibaki and Odinga signed a power-sharing agreement called the National Accord and Reconciliation Act, which establishes the office of prime minister and creates a coalition government.[1] The power-sharing Cabinet, headed by Odinga as Prime Minister, was eventually named on 13 April, after lengthy negotiations over its composition;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/articles/143735/kenya-unveils-40-seat-cabinet "Kenya unveils 40-seat cabinet"], Al Jazeera, 13 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; it was sworn in on 17 April.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2008/04/200861503825659205.html "Odinga sworn in as Kenya PM"], Al Jazeera, 17 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The National Accord==
The two parties agreed to tackle four main agenda items to end the political crisis and address its underlying causes.

*	Agenda Item 1: Immediate Action to Stop Violence and Restore Fundamental Rights.
*	Agenda Item 2: Addressing the Humanitarian Crisis, and Promoting Healing and Reconciliation.
*	Agenda Item 3: How to Overcome the Political Crisis (power sharing).
*	Agenda Item 4: Tackling Long-term Issues.

== The TJRC ==

The TJRC (Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission of Kenya) is part of the accountability component of Agenda Four of the National Accord signed in 2008. By addressing the cause and effects of historical injustices and gross violations of human rights the TJRC will contribute towards national unity, reconciliation, and healing. The Commission is established by an Act of Parliament (Truth Justice and Reconciliation Commission Act no. 6 of 2008) to investigate the gross human rights violations and other historical injustices in Kenya between 12 December 1963 and 28 February 2008.

Agenda Four of the National Dialogue and Reconciliation process of 2008 that relates to ''long term issues and reforms'' provides the framework for [[transitional justice]], with the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission driving the transitional justice agenda.

Kenya's civil society have called for a truth, justice, and reconciliation process since 2002 when the NARC Government came into power after the twenty four-year rule of President Moi. In 2003, a Government appointed Task Force recommended establishment of a Truth Justice and reconciliation Commission. Had this recommendation been acted on then, perhaps the country might have avoided the post December 2007 election violence witnessed.&lt;ref name="knchr.org"/&gt;

== Mandate of the TJRC ==

The Truth, Justice, and Reconciliation Commission of Kenya has the ability to investigate, analyse, and report on what happened between 1963 and 2008 in regards to gross violations of human rights, economic crimes, illegal acquisition of public land, marginalisation of communities, ethnic violence, the context in which the crimes occurred, and educate the public about its work. The TJRC does not, however, have the power to prosecute. They can recommend prosecutions, reparations for victims, institutional changes, and amnesty in exchange for truth for perpetrators who did not commit gross human rights violations.

The TJRC investigates, analyses, and reports on human rights abuses, economic crimes, illegal acquisition of land, marginalisation of communities, and ethnic violence. In terms of justice, lack of retributive justice has been a source of concern for many Kenyans. Though the commission can recommend prosecutions, there has been a long-standing culture of impunity in the country, which threatens to keep political leaders safe from prosecution. However, the commission has focused on justice in terms of recognition and distribution. The commission has sought to give victims and perpetrators equal voice in hearings, and have included hearings where children may share their stories, with guidance from counselors. Recommendations for redistribution of power and resources has been a focus of the mandate, as major conflicts have arisen due to imbalances in power, land, and resources between ethnic groups. Additionally, the commission has focused on educating the country about the history of violence, and emphasises promoting reconciliation through revealing of truth.

The public is invited and encouraged to participate to fulfill the goal of educating the public. Members of the public may attend the public hearings, and can volunteer to assist the TJRC in fulfilling its mandate. They may also make submissions to the commission regarding the TJRC mandate. Victims may apply for reparations if they qualify.

=== Objectives ===
In its work the Commission will pursue the following goals and objectives:

*	Truth: by establishing an accurate, complete and historical record of human rights violations and historical injustices, and educating the public

===The Commissioners===
The commissioners of the TJRC are both local and international, and there has been controversy regarding the legitimacy of the commission due to its commissioners. Some of the commissioners and people involved with the commission were involved with the previous government, and, consequently, people question the impartiality of the commission. Nevertheless, the commissioners offer different types of expertise that they can apply to Kenya's TJRC. 
* [[Bethuel Kiplagat]] was the chairman of the commission. Originally, President [[Mwai Kibaki]] picked him to head the commission. However, Kiplagat later stepped down in November 2010 after being pressured to resign by fellow commissioners, civil society groups, human rights activists and the general public since he was part of a meeting of the Kenyan Intelligence Committee held less than forty eight hours prior to the security operation that resulted in the [[Wagalla massacre]], which according to the UN was the worst massacre in Kenya's history.  The TJRC investigated the massacre and made a finding that Kiplagat should be barred from further public offices and investigated for possible complicity in the massacre.  It is the first time a truth commission has made a negative finding concerning its own Chairman.  In addition to the Wagalla Massacre, the Commission investigated two additional violations to which Kiplagat was linked:  the murder of Kenya's Foreign Minister, [[Robert Ouko (politician)]];  Kiplagat was also accused of land grabbing while he acted as Permanent Secretary during former President Moi's regime. In April 2012, Kiplagat was reinstated as TJRC chairman after the Justice Minister Eugene Wamalwa brokered a truce between him and the other commissioners.&lt;ref&gt;Lordrick Mayabi (11 April 2012) [http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2012/04/kiplagat-tjrc-foes-call-a-truce/ Kiplagat, TJRC foes call a truce]. capitalfm.co.ke&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, Kiplagat worked with the National Christian Council of Kenya, served as an Ambassador to France, the High Commissioner to UK, and the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Kiplagat was also the chair of the board of the African Medical and Research Foundation and worked with Kenya's Special Envoy to the Somalia peace process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africa-confidential.com/whos-who-profile/id/360/ Bethuel Kiplagat]. africa-confidential.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tecla Namachanja Wanjala]] acted as the chairperson in Kiplagat's absence, and she has been involved in peacemaking in Kenya during the 1991–92 and 1997 violence. She has participated in several different countries' conflict resolution processes, including Sudan, Rwanda and Ethiopia, and she headed the Regional Party for Peace in East and Central Africa Program, which seeks to increase African leadership in conflict management in the Horn of Africa. She trained 500 workers for the Nairobi Peace Initiative, consulted for [[Japan International Cooperation Agency]], and journeyed with internally displaced persons in Kenya during the ethnic clashes of 1993–1995. She organised aid for over 40,000 survivors of the violence. She is from Kenya.
* [[Ahmed Sheikh Farah]], a commissioner from Kenya, has worked internationally for the Kenya Armed Forces. He has experience in conflict prevention, management, and resolutions at both the regional and international levels.
* [[Berhanu Dinka]], a commissioner from Ethiopia, has 27 years of experience working in the Ethiopian Foreign Service and in the United Nations. He also acted as an Ethiopian ambassador and headed the Department of Africa and Middle East Affairs in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After attaining the rank of Under Secretary-General in the UN, Commissioner Dinka represented the Secretary General during negotiations to resolve the conflict in DR Congo.
* [[Gertrude Chawatama]], a commissioner from Zambia, has over 19 years of professional judicial experience. She is a judge with the High Court of Zambia, a board member of the Commonwealth Judicial Education Institute based in Canada, a council member of the Commonwealth Magistrates and Judges Association for the East, Central and Southern African region, and chairperson of the Juvenile Justice Forum in Zambia.
* [[Margaret Shava]], a commissioner from Kenya, has worked in law, management, and peace-building for over 17 years. She is an advocate of the High Court of Kenya and has practised law with a leading law firm in Nairobi. Commissioner Shava has experience in the economic sectors, modern corporate and human resources management, and the UN. She also worked with national and international NGOs that specialise in human rights, governance, and international refugee law.
* [[Ronald Slye]], a commissioner from the United States, is a professor of law at the Seattle University School of Law. He consults, writes, and teaches on public international law and international human rights law, and is a specialist in international criminal law and transitional justice.  Commissioner Slye is the author of articles on international law, human rights, and environmental and poverty law, and he is the co-author of two books on international criminal law. He is writing a book on the [[South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] and its amnesty process, based on his time as one of the commission's legal consultants. He has published a book about his experience with the Kenyan Truth Commission: "The Kenyan TJRC: An Outsider's View from the Inside," published by Cambridge University Press.  A companion website established at his University makes available the Commission's Final Report, the dissent filed by the international Commissioners, and transcripts of many of the public hearings held by the Commission.  The website is: https://digitalcommons.law.seattleu.edu/tjrc/.
* Tom Ojienda, a commissioner from Kenya, is a former President of the East African Law Society, former Chair of the Law Society of Kenya, and Financial Secretary and Vice-President of the Pan-African Lawyers Union (PALU). He was a consultant for the [[Njonjo Land Commission|Njonjo]] and [[Ndungu Land Commission]]s, World Bank, USAID, ACCORD and EAC, and served as a member of the Legal and Technical Working Group in the National Land Policy formulation process. Commissioner Ojienda has written two books on land law and edited two books on democracy and constitutional change.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120302214734/http://www.tjrckenya.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=43&amp;Itemid=120 The Commissioners]. tjrckenya.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===Departments===
The work of the TJRC is being accomplished through the work of seven different departments.
* The department of Finance &amp; Administration provides support to the commission by organising the logistical and administrative aspects of the commission's budget and finances.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120302214724/http://www.tjrckenya.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=400&amp;Itemid=205 Finance and Administration Unit]. tjrckenya.org&lt;/ref&gt;
* The department of Communications acts as the link between the commission and the public. It provides information to the media and ensures that the Kenyan population has access to the commission's proceedings. The department of Communications maintains clarity in regard to the commission's mandate and processes, encourages the public, particularly those who have suffered from gross human rights violations, to participate in the commission, and facilitates national discourse.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120302214734/http://www.tjrckenya.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=399&amp;Itemid=206 Communications Unit]. tjrckenya.org&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Special Support Services Unit works with the specific experiences of vulnerable groups, such as women, children, and people with disabilities. It considers gender-based violations, ensures that witnesses can communicate in their chosen language, and focuses on the treatment of witness and their families.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120302214740/http://www.tjrckenya.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=398&amp;Itemid=207 Special Support Services Unit]. tjrckenya.org&lt;/ref&gt;
* The department of Legal Affairs manages all of the commission's legal issues. It gives legal support and advice, organises the hearings, and provides support to the victims and witnesses in conjunction with the Special Services Unit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120302214752/http://www.tjrckenya.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=397&amp;Itemid=208 Legal Affairs Unit]. tjrckenya.org&lt;/ref&gt;
* The department of Investigations collects, analyses, and provides the necessary evidence and information for the commission to run smoothly. It enables the commission to construct a complete historical record by interviewing and collecting evidence from victims and witnesses of the gross human rights violations and mapping out scenes of violence for the commission's site visits.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120302214800/http://www.tjrckenya.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=396&amp;Itemid=209 Investigations Unit]. tjrckenya.org&lt;/ref&gt;
* The department of Research conducts research relating to the commission's mandate, assists the research of other units within the commission, and coordinates the writing of the commission's final report.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120302214807/http://www.tjrckenya.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=395&amp;Itemid=210 Research Unit]. tjrckenya.org&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Civic Education and Outreach Unit educates and engages the public in the workings of the commission.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120302214813/http://www.tjrckenya.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=394&amp;Itemid=211 Civic Education and Outreach Unit]. tjrckenya.org&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Activities of the Commission ===

The Commission will undertake the following activities to fulfill its mandate;

==== Statement taking ====

Statements recorded from victims across the country are the main source of information for the TJRC on gross human rights violations suffered by them during the mandate period (12 December 1963 and 28 February 2008). The statement taking process provides victims with the opportunity to tell the truth about their experiences and those of close friends and relatives.

==== Hearings ====

The TJRC will conduct public and private hearings at which victims, perpetrators, experts will give testimony relating to gross violations of human rights.

'''Individual hearings'''

Individual hearings will focus on individual cases, and the experience of individuals with respect to violations within the mandate of the Commission.

'''Thematic and event hearings'''

Thematic hearings will focus on types of violations and other broad themes within the mandate of the Commission.

'''Institutional Hearings'''

Institutional hearings will focus on the role played by an institution or institutions with respect to violations within the mandate of the Commission

==== Community dialogues ====

The TJRC will hold discussion forums bringing together different groups across the country (ethnic; religious; chiefs; women; youth) to chart ways of establishing reconciliation, harmonious co-existence and national unity. This aspect of the TJRC’s work presents avenues for collaboration with the National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC), and other Agenda Four Commissions.

== The final report ==

This is the Truth Justice and Reconciliation Commission’s main product. It will document the Commission’s work relating to the following aspects:
*	Consist of historical record of gross human rights violations
*	Outline the Commission’s findings and detail recommendations on: how to address past violations and injustices through reparations and prosecutions; How to prevent future violations in various ways including specific legal and institutional reforms and memorialisation.

Timeline:
The Commission began in August 2009 with an operational period of two years. This period includes three months prior to beginning operations for set up, and three months following as a "winding down" period. The Commission requested a 6-month extension, thus the current timeline is as follows:

*     Start of set up period:  3 August 2009
*     Start of operational period: 3 November 2009
*     End of operational period and issuing of report: 3 November 2011
*     End of winding down period:  3 February 2012


A full copy of the Final Report, including the dissent submitted by the international Commissioners, can be found at https://digitalcommons.law.seattleu.edu/tjrc/.

==The TJRC and the International Criminal Court==
The [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) became involved in Kenya when Kenya ratified the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] on 15 March 2005, which gave the ICC jurisdiction over war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide committed in Kenya after the statute came into force, or July 2002. The ICC has jurisdiction only when the country in question fails to act on crimes against humanity that were perpetrated on its land. 
The Kenyan government created the Commission of Inquiry on Post Election Violence (CIPEV), otherwise known as the [[Waki Commission]], in February 2008, which was an international commission of inquiry with the aim of investigating the post-election violence that occurred in Kenya. One of the many suggestions in the official report that the Waki Commission made was that the Kenyan government establish a tribunal of both international and national judges to investigate and prosecute perpetrators of the gross human rights violations. The commission gave the government a limited amount of time to agree to create a special tribunal, and made it clear that the commission would give its findings to the ICC if the government failed to establish the tribunal within the given timeframe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africafiles.org/article.asp?ID=19264 “The Waki Commission Report”]. AfricaFiles, 15 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
In February 2009, after the Kenyan Parliament voted against founding the tribunal and no further action was taken by the government, the Waki Commission handed over its information, including a list of those believed to be responsible for the violence, to the ICC. On 26 November 2009, the Prosecutor requested permission from the court to investigate the crimes against humanity during the post-election violence in Kenya, and was granted permission to do so by the majority of the court.
After carrying out investigations against six prominent individuals believed to be responsible for the crimes against humanity, the [[International Criminal Court investigation in Kenya]] decided to send four of them to trial. The government has protested the findings. It asked the UN to postpone the ICC's Kenya case, and has put up substantial resistance to the ICC.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin J. Kelley (19 March 2011) [http://www.nation.co.ke/News/politics/Why+Kenya+failed+to+defer+ICC+cases+at+Security+Council+/-/1064/1129160/-/m4rw3gz/-/ “Why Kenya failed to defer ICC cases at Security Council”]. Daily Nation.&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, confidence in Kenya's judiciary has declined, and, as part of the National Accord made after the 2008 violence, the government has responded by launching an investigation into the judiciary. Four senior judges, Justice Samuel Bosire, Justice Joseph Gregory Nyamu, Justice Samuel Cornelius Riaga Omolo, and Justice Emmanuel Okelo O'Kubasu, were declared unfit for office by the investigation in April 2012. The two senior Court of Appeals judges, Justice Bosire and Justice Nyamu, were removed from office because of their involvement with the [[Goldenberg scandal]] trials. It is expected that more judges will be removed from office as the investigation continues. This ruling marks the beginning of the second phase of the vetting process, and the investigation may end the corruption in Kenya's own legal system. &lt;ref&gt;Wahome Thuku and Isaiah Lucheli (26 April 2012) [http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/news/InsidePage.php?id=2000057069&amp;cid=4&amp; “Scandals and past rulings end careers of four senior judges”]. The Standard&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and media coverage==

The relative immaturity of Kenya’s TJRC makes it difficult to evaluate the commission’s success. This immaturity however also secures a great wealth of recent discussion on the TJRC and many opinions regarding its success. For example, the vice-president of the [[International Center for Transitional Justice]] recently spoke of the [[International Criminal Court]]’s involvement in the efforts to reconcile Kenya. He commented that, “This week's decision in The Hague [confirming four Kenyans must answer to charges of crimes against humanity] was welcomed peacefully across the country. It is telling that most Kenyans support the ICC and have little faith in their own judiciary, which is widely perceived as corrupt.”  He called the Kenyan government to fulfill their responsibility to pursue justice at home to avoid violence after the anticipated 2012 election. Similar criticism came from the United States before [[Hillary Clinton]]’s visit in August 2009. Specifically the US criticised the use of local courts to try suspects accused of perpetrating violence. These courts, the US argued, had a backlog of hundreds of thousands of cases and a reputation for corruption. Critics also question the credibility of the commissioners because of their connection to Moi's regime and its gross human rights violations. Deputy chair of the commission, lawyer Betty Murungi, resigned saying that she found it difficult to fulfill her duties when the commission leader, Bethwell Kiplagat, faced accusations. Additionally, the inability of the commission to meet its 11 November 2011 report deadline only enhanced public scepticism. The task of reconciling the people of Kenya after the series of gross human rights violations that have occurred of the past half-century requires a stable commission and a government that the people of Kenya can believe in.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Seils (2012) [http://ictj.org/news/iccs-kenya-decision-no-cause-celebration "ICC's Kenya decision is no cause for celebration"]. International Center of Transitional Justice&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Maliti (4 August 2009) [http://hillaryclintonclub.com/newsupdate2/2009/08/us-criticizes-kenya-ahead-of-clintons.html "US criticizes Kenya ahead of Clinton's visit"].

'''Torkel Halvorsen Aschehoug''' (27 June 1822 – 20 January 1909) was a prominent Norwegian professor, legal scholar, historian and social economist. He also served  as a conservative politician and Member of the [[Norwegian Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   https://snl.no/Torkel_Halvorsen_Aschehoug|title=   Torkel Halvorsen Aschehoug|publisher =Store norske leksikon|author= Jon Gisle
|accessdate= May 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Biography==
Torkel Halvorsen Aschehoug was born at [[Idd]] (now [[Halden]]) in [[Østfold]], Norway. He grew up in a professional family in which his father and grandfather  were both parish priests. He attended Fredrikshalds lærde skole in Halden. In 1839, he  entered Royal Frederick University (now [[University of Oslo]]), where he later became a professor. In 1844, Aschehoug graduated with a law degree. He subsequently studied abroad with stops including England and Sweden. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   https://nbl.snl.no/Torkel_Halvorsen_Aschehoug|title=   Torkel Halvorsen Aschehoug|publisher =Norsk biografisk leksikon|author= Dag Michalsen|accessdate= May 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1852, Aschehoug began an over fifty-year career at the University of Oslo. He was Professor of Jurisprudence, National Economics and Statistics at the [[Faculty of Law, University of Oslo|Faculty of Law]] (1862–1889), and also served as the Dean of the Faculty of Law and the elected Chairman of the Collegium Academicum (the governing body of the university). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   https://no.wikisource.org/wiki/Torkel_Halvorsen_Aschehoug|title=   Torkel Halvorsen Aschehoug|publisher =   Aschehoug|author=   Francis Hagerup|date=   1913   
|accessdate= May 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also served as a Member of Parliament 1868–1892 and played a central role in the controversy surrounding the adoption of a [[parliamentary system]] in which the Cabinet was responsible to parliament instead of being merely appointed by the King. In 1883, he founded Statsøkonomisk Forening, an association to advance the study and understanding of socio-economic issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   https://snl.no/Stats%C3%B8konomisk_Forening |title=   Statsøkonomisk Forening|publisher = Store norske leksikon|author= Olav Garvik|accessdate= May 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{sociology}}
'''Traditional authority''' (also known as traditional domination) is a form of [[leadership]] in which the authority of an [[organization]] or a [[ruling regime]] is largely tied to [[tradition]] or custom. The main reason for the given state of affairs is that it 'has always been that way'.

==In sociology==
In [[sociology]], the concept of traditional authority (domination) comes from [[Max Weber]]'s [[tripartite classification of authority]], the other two forms being [[charismatic authority]] and [[rational-legal authority]]. All of those three domination types represent an example of his [[ideal type]] concept. Weber noted that in history those ideal types of domination are always found in combinations.

In traditional authority, the legitimacy of the authority comes from tradition; in charismatic authority from the personality and leadership qualities of the individual; and in rational-legal authority from powers that are [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratically]] and legally attached to certain positions.

===Patriarchs and their households===
Weber derives the traditional domination from [[patriarchy]]s and their households—in other words, from the ancient tradition of [[family]] (the authority of a master over his household). The master is designated in accordance with the rules of [[inheritance]]. He has no administrative staff nor any machinery to enforce his will by force alone; he depends on the willingness of the group members to respect his authority. Those members stand in personal relations to him. They obey him based on the belief that this is their duty sanctioned by immemorial tradition and on feeling of filial [[piety]] for the person of the master.

=== Patrimonialism ===

[[Patrimonialism|Patrimonial government]] occurs when the ruler's household expands with the  household administration giving rise to governmental offices. All officials are personal dependents or favourites of the ruler, appointed by him. Their interactions with the ruler are based on paternal authority and filial dependence. The officials treat their work as a personal service to the ruler. The ruler has complete control over the officials; he empowers them from case to case, assigns specific tasks, promotes and demotes. They have no rights, rather they have privileges granted and withdrawn by the ruler. It is rare to discover any clear and stable hierarchy and responsibility in the deluge of official titles of most patrimonial administrations.

[[Military]] force is an important instrument of a patrimonial rule. Weber distinguished five types of military organisations. In all of those cases the military is a tool of the ruler, solely for his use—but he is responsible for its upkeep (equipment, maintenance and wages).

With the growth of the territory organized and more independent administrative staff and military force became a necessity. This usually leads to [[decentralisation]], and some individuals gain more independence in the form of certain rights (for example, the right to inheritance and marriage without the consent of the rulers, to be judged by independent courts instead of officials of the royal household, etc.).

One of the best examples of almost [[pure type]] of patrimonialism is [[ancient Egypt]], where the population was entirely dependent upon the control of the waterways ([[Nile River]]). This facilitated the creation of [[centralised government]]. When the royal household required it, the individual had to perform the public duties, such as participate in labor-intensive project (rising of the [[pyramids]]). Thus the whole country was in fact the patriarchal household of the [[pharaoh]].

When land is given to military or officials for the performance of their duties, their independence increases and the power of the ruler weakens (consider the [[Mameluks]] and their rebellions, or the difference between Chinese [[Confucian]] [[Scholar-bureaucrats|literati]] who were never able to overthrow the power of the [[emperor]] and [[Europe]]an [[knights]] who evolved into powerful [[aristocracy]] in many cases vastly limiting the power of the [[monarch|kings]] (especially in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]])).

Patrimonial dominance has often prevailed in the [[Orient]], where land remained in the control of the ruler. However, in the [[Western world|Occident]] the ruler lost control of the lands given to the nobility, which according to Weber was a major reason for patrimonialism being replaced by feudalism.

===Feudalism===
[[Feudalism]] when compared to patrimonalism, has one major similarity and several important differences.

The similarity is that both are based on tradition and have powerful rulers who grant rights in return for military and administrative services.

The differences are important for the subtler distinction:
* feudalism replaces the paternal relationship of patrimonalism by a contract of allegiance based on knightly militarism.
* the patrimonial ruler's grants of authority and the personal dependence of official are replaced in feudalism by the contractual freedom, personal allegiance and socioeconomic prominence on the part of the vassals.

==Traditional leaders==
Most of the representatives of any [[dynasty]] ruling for more than one generation ([[monarch|kings]], [[emperor]]s, [[sultan]]s, etc.) would fall into that category. Thus majority [[monarchy|monarchies]] and some [[Autocracy|autocracies]], [[Oligarchy|oligarchies]], and [[Theocracy|theocracies]] would be ruled by traditional leaders.

Often male head of a common family should be considered a traditional leader. This could also be the case in a family-owned business, if its director and other leader positions are chosen based on family ties and/or age.

The '''Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada''' (TRC) was a [[truth and reconciliation commission]] organized by the parties of the [[Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement]]. The Commission was officially established on June 2, 2008 with the purpose of documenting the history and impacts of the [[Canadian residential school system|Indian residential school]]. It provided former residential school attendees an opportunity to share their experiences during public and private meetings held across the country. 

In June 2015, the TRC released an Executive Summary of its findings along with 94 "calls to action" regarding reconciliation between Canadians and Indigenous peoples. The Commission officially concluded in December 2015 with the publication of a multi-volume report that concluded the school system amounted to [[cultural genocide]]. The [[National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation]], which opened in November 2015, is home to the research, documents, and testimony collected during the course of the TRC's operation.

The TRC was established as one of the mandated aspects of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/faqs-truth-and-reconciliation-commission-1.699883|title=FAQs: Truth and Reconciliation Commission|work=CBC News|access-date=March 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mandate"&gt;{{cite web|title=Schedule N of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement|url=http://trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/index.php?p=7|publisher=Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRC)|accessdate=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission was founded as an arms-length organization with a mandate of documenting the history and impacts of the residential school system. As part of this work the TRC spent six years travelling to different parts of Canada to hear the testimony of approximately six thousand Indigenous people who were taken away from their families and placed in residential schools as children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lop.parl.ca/content/lop/researchpublications/prb0848-e.htm|title=The Indian Residential Schools Truth and Reconciliation Commission-prb0848e|website=lop.parl.ca|access-date=March 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mandate of the TRC included hosting seven national reconciliation events, collecting all relevant archival documents relating to the residential schools from church and government bodies, collecting statements from survivors, and overseeing a commemoration fund to support community reconciliation events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/aboriginal-heritage/Pages/truth-reconciliation-commission-web-archive.aspx?=undefined&amp;wbdisable=true|title=Library and Archives Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission Web Archive|last=Canada|first=Library and Archives|date=May 3, 2017|access-date=March 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TRC's mandate emphasized preserving and exposing the true history of residential schools.&lt;ref name="kennedy"&gt;[http://o.canada.com/news/national/at-least-4000-aboriginal-children-died-in-residential-schools-commission-finds Mark Kennedy, "At least 4,000 aboriginal children died in residential schools, commission finds"], ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', Canada.com, January 3, 2014, accessed October 18, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008, Indigenous leaders and church officials embarked on a multi-city 'Remembering the Children' tour to promote activities of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/03/02/aboriginals-commission.html |title=Indian, church leaders launch multi-city tour to highlight commission |publisher=CBC|date=March 2, 2008|accessdate=June 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 21–22, 2008, the [[The King's University (Edmonton)|King's University College]] of Edmonton, Alberta, held an interdisciplinary studies conference on the subject of the Truth and Reconciliation Committee. On June 11 of the same year, Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] apologized for the role of past [[Government of Canada|governments]] in administration of the residential schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100015644/1100100015649|title= Statement of apology to former students of Indian Residential Schools |date=June 11, 2008|website= [[Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada]]|publisher= Government of Canada|location= Ottawa, Ontario, Canada|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission's mandate was originally scheduled to end in 2014, with a final event in Ottawa. However, it was extended to 2015 as numerous records related to residential schools were provided to the commission in 2014 by [[Library and Archives Canada]] following a January 2013 order of the [[Ontario Superior Court of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/aboriginal/huge-number-of-records-to-land-on-truth-and-reconciliation-commission-s-doorstep-1.2617770|title=Huge number of records to land on Truth and Reconciliation Commission's doorstep|date=April 23, 2014|publisher=CBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission needed additional time to review these documents. The commission held its closing event in Ottawa from May 31 to June 3, 2015, including a ceremony at [[Rideau Hall]] with [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[David Johnston]].

=== Commission name ===

The Canadian Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was named in a similar fashion to the commissions by the same name in Chile in 1990 and South Africa in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/207026|title=Truth and Reconciliation Commission|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Oxford English Dictionary|access-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context ''reconciliation'' means: the act of restoring a once harmonious relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/159781|title=Reconciliation|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Oxford English Dictionary|access-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission came under criticism for using the term 'reconciliation' in their name, as it implies that there was once a harmonious relationship between [[settler]]s and Indigenous peoples that is being restored, while that relationship may never have existed in Canada.&lt;ref name="Garneau2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garneau|first1=David|date=2012|title=Imaginary Spaces of Conciliation and Reconciliation|url=http://reworksinprogress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/wcl74h.pdf|journal=West Coast Line|volume=46|issue=2|accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|35}} The use of the term ''reconciliation'' perpetuates that myth by continuing to deny "the existence of pre-contact Aboriginal sovereignty".&lt;ref name="Garneau2" /&gt;{{rp|35}}

=== Commission staff ===

Justice [[Harry S. Laforme]] of the [[Ontario Court of Appeal]] was named to chair the Commission. He resigned on October 20, 2008, citing insubordination by the two other commissioners, Claudette Dumont-Smith and Jane Brewin Morley. Laforme said they wanted to focus primarily on uncovering and documenting truth while he wanted to also have an emphasis on reconciliation between aboriginal and non-aboriginal Canadians. In addition: "The two commissioners are unprepared to accept that the structure of the commission requires that the commission's course is to be charted and its objectives are to be shaped ultimately through the authority and leadership of its chair."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|publisher=CBC |title=Judge at head of residential school investigation resigns |date=October 18, 2008 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2008/10/20/truth-resignation.html |accessdate=October 20, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103164125/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2008/10/20/truth-resignation.html |archivedate=November 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Dumont-Smith and Morley denied the charge and initially stayed on,&lt;ref name="Response"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/native-leaders-divided-over-future-of-residential-schools-panel/article661684/ | title=Native leaders divided over future of residential schools panel | work=[[The Globe and Mail]] (Last updated March 13, 2009) | date=October 22, 2008 | accessdate=May 31, 2017 | author=Joe Friesen, Jacquie McNish, Bill Curry}}&lt;/ref&gt; both resigned in January 2009.

On June 10, 2009 [[Murray Sinclair]] was appointed to replace Laforme as chairperson of the TRC. Marie Wilson, a senior executive with the Workers' Safety and Compensation Commission of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, and [[Willie Littlechild|Wilton Littlechild]], former Conservative Member of Parliament and Alberta regional chief for the [[Assembly of First Nations]], were appointed to replace commissioners Dumont-Smith and Morley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher=CBC| title=New commissioners for native reconciliation| date=June 10, 2009| url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/06/10/f-truth-and-reconciliation-commissioners-2009.html| accessdate=June 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Results ==

=== Calls to action ===

In June 2015 the TRC released a summary report of its findings and "94 Calls to Action" to "redress the legacy of residential schools and advance the process of Canadian reconciliation". These were divided into two categories: "Legacy" and "Reconciliation":&lt;ref name="calltoaction-pdf"&gt;{{Cite report|url=http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/File/2015/Findings/Calls_to_Action_English2.pdf|title=Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada: Calls to Action|publisher=Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, 2012|quote=In order to redress the legacy of residential schools and advance the process of Canadian reconciliation, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission makes the following calls to action.|accessdate=June 14, 2015|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Legacy'''
Redressing the harms resulting from the Indian residential schools, the proposed actions are identified in the following sub-categories:

* '''Child welfare''' - Residential schools often served as foster homes rather than educational centres. According to a 1953 survey, 4,313 children of 10,112 residential school children were described as either orphans or originated from broken homes.&lt;ref&gt;TRC, NRA, INAC – Resolution Sector – IRS Historical Files Collection – Ottawa, file 6-21-1, volume 2 (Ctrl #27-6), H. M. Jones to Deputy Minister, December 13, 1956. [NCA-001989-0001]&lt;/ref&gt; The sole residential school in Canada's Atlantic Provinces, in Shubenacadie, N.S., was one such school, taking in children whom child welfare agencies believed to be at risk. By 2011, 3.6% of all First Nations children under the age of 14 were in foster care, compared to 0.3% for non-aboriginal children.&lt;ref&gt;Canada, Statistics Canada, Aboriginal People in Canada, 19&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the [[Committee on the Rights of the Child|United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child]] voiced its concern on Canada's removal of Indigenous children from their families as a 'first resort'.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, Convention on the Rights of the Child, Concluding observations, 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Education''' - It has been claimed that the education system for residential schools operated under the assumption that aboriginals were intellectually and culturally inferior, but documented evidence suggests otherwise. Prior to the establishment of the IRS system, a number of Indigenous had already received a non-Indigenous education in earlier mission schools. However, because of limited funds, a shortage of trained teachers, and an emphasis on manual labour, a good many students in the IRS system did not progress beyond a rudimentary education. When residential schools were phased out, Indigenous youth enrolled in provincial schools dropped out in large numbers. The calls to action are to address the current school completion rates and the income gap between the aboriginals and non-aboriginals. In addition, the calls to actions request to eliminate the discrepancy in funding of schools on and off reserves, where children have had to leave their families behind to pursue high-school education or further education.
* '''Language and Culture''' - In many schools, children in residential schools were not allowed to speak their native languages or practice their culture, partly to encourage the use of English but also in an effort by the government to assimilate the children into non-aboriginal society. While there was never a government policy regarding the suppression of native languages, individual school administrators determined their own policy regarding enforcement of English in the schools. According to [[Endangered language|UNESCO]], 36% of Canada's Indigenous languages are listed as being critically endangered.&lt;ref&gt;Moseley and Nicolas, Atlas of the World's Languages, 117&lt;/ref&gt; The calls to action request increased funding for educating children in Indigenous languages and also request that post-secondary institutions provide degrees and diplomas in Indigenous languages.
* '''Health''' - Health care for IRS students varied considerably between schools and between different decades. After the 1940s, health facilities and health care workers became more prevalent. Some schools had a nurse on staff and an infirmary, with doctors who paid visits. Testimony before the TRC reveals that a great many Aboriginal children were subjected to sexual and physical abuse while attending a residential school. It is often claimed that the effects of the trauma have been passed on to the children of those students, but there is also evidence that this intergenerational effect is significantly less than claimed. Today, due to the isolated locations of many Aboriginal communities, there continues to be a significant lack of health services available to these communities. The calls to action are meant to address the health outcomes for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians.
* '''Justice''' - When the Canadian legal system was tasked with investigating abuse claims, few prosecutions resulted from police investigations. In many cases, the federal government and the RCMP actually compromised the investigations. Given the statutes of limitations, many acts of abuse have gone unpunished because the children did not have the means or possess the knowledge to seek justice for their abuses. The calls to action seek to extend the statutes of limitations and reaffirm the independence of the RCMP.

'''Reconciliation'''
To bring the federal and provincial governments and Indigenous nations of Canada into a reconciled state for the future, the proposed actions are identified in the following sub-categories:

* Canadian governments and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People
* Royal proclamation and covenant of reconciliation
* Settlement agreement parties and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
* Equity for Aboriginal people in the legal system
* National council for reconciliation
* Professional development and training for public servants
* Church apologies and reconciliation
* Education for reconciliation
* Youth programs
* Museums and archives
* Missing children and burial information
* National centre for truth and reconciliation
* Commemoration
* Media and reconciliation
* Sports and reconciliation
* Business and reconciliation
* Newcomers to Canada
In 2016 and 2017 historian Ian Mosby evaluated how many of the calls to action had been completed at the one year and two year anniversary marks.  In 2016 he concluded that only five calls were complete and three calls were partially complete, leaving 86 calls unmet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.windspeaker.com/news/windspeaker-news/trc-calls-to-action-update-after-500-plus-days-since-trudeaus-promise/|title=TRC calls to action update after 500-plus days since Trudeau's promise|work=windspeaker.com|access-date=March 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 his evaluation showed that only 7 of the 94 calls have been completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/unreserved/how-are-you-putting-reconciliation-into-action-1.4362219/curious-about-how-many-of-the-trc-s-calls-to-actions-have-been-completed-check-ian-mosby-s-twitter-1.4364330|title=Curious about how many of the TRC's calls to actions have been completed?

=== Final report ===

In December 2015 the TRC released a Final Report, titled "Honouring the Truth, Reconciling the Future." The report was based upon primary source research undertaken by the commission and testimonies collected from residential school survivors during TRC events. The report noted that an estimated 150,000 children attended residential schools during its 120-year history and an estimated 3200 of those children died in the residential schools.&lt;ref name="Truth and Reconciliation Commission: By the numbers"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/truth-and-reconciliation-commission-by-the-numbers-1.3096185|title=Truth and Reconciliation Commission: By the numbers|last=Schwartz|first=Daniel|date=June 2, 2015|work=CBC News|access-date=March 28, 2017|publisher=CBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 70,000 former IRS students still alive, there were 31,970 sexual or serious sexual assault cases resolved by independent assessment process, and 5,995 claims were still in progress as of the report's release.&lt;ref name="Truth and Reconciliation Commission: By the numbers" /&gt;

The TRC concluded that the removal of children from the influence of their own culture with the intent of assimilating them into the dominant Canadian culture amounted to [[cultural genocide]].&lt;ref name="TRCSummary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Honouring the Truth, Reconciling for the Future: Summary of the Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada |url=http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/File/2015/Findings/Exec_Summary_2015_05_31_web_o.pdf |website=National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation |publisher=Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada |accessdate=June 28, 2016 |date=May 31, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706170855/http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/File/2015/Findings/Exec_Summary_2015_05_31_web_o.pdf |archivedate=July 6, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} The ambiguity of the TRC's phrasing allowed for the interpretation that physical and biological genocide also occurred. The TRC was not authorized to conclude that physical and biological genocide occurred, as such a finding would imply a legal responsibility of the Canadian government that would be difficult to prove. As a result, the debate about whether the Canadian government also committed physical and biological genocide against Indigenous populations remains open.&lt;ref name="MacDonald"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=MacDonald|first1=David B.|authorlink=David Bruce MacDonald|title=Canada's history wars: indigenous genocide and public memory in the United States, Australia and Canada|journal=Journal of Genocide Research|date=October 2, 2015|volume=17|issue=4|pages=411–431|doi=10.1080/14623528.2015.1096583|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14623528.2015.1096583|subscription=yes|issn=1462-3528}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WoolfordBenvenuto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woolford|first1=Andrew|last2=Benvenuto|first2=Jeff|title=Canada and colonial genocide|journal=Journal of Genocide Research|date=October 2, 2015|volume=17|issue=4|pages=373–390|doi=10.1080/14623528.2015.1096580|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14623528.2015.1096580|url-access=subscription|issn=1462-3528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation (NCTR) was established at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, as an archive to hold the research, documents, and testimony collected by the TRC during its operation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/a-new-beginning-national-centre-for-truth-and-reconciliation-opens-in-winnipeg-1.2641228|title='A new beginning' National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation opens in Winnipeg|last=Dehaas|first=Josh|date=November 3, 2015|work=CTVNews|access-date=March 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCTR opened to the public in November 2015 and holds more than five million documents relating to the legacy of residential schools in Canada.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Criticisms ==
A number of critiques about the TRC have been put forward by both Indigenous and non-Indigenous writers, ranging from its scope and motivating framework to its methodology and conclusions. Professor Glen Coulthard, a member of the [[Yellowknives#Yellowknives_First_Nations|Yellowknives Dene First Nation]], has argued that the TRC's focus on the residential school system positioned reconciliation as a matter of "overcoming a 'sad chapter' in [Canadian] history,"&lt;ref name="Coulthard"&gt;{{cite book|title=Red skin, white masks : rejecting the colonial politics of recognition|last1=Coulthard|first1=Glen Sean|date=2014|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=9780816679652}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|125}} which failed to recognize the ongoing nature and impact of [[colonialism]]. For Coulthard reconciliation being tied solely to the residential school system and actions of the past explains why [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] was able to apologize for the system in 2008 and, a year later, claim that there is no history of colonialism in Canada.&lt;ref name="Querengesser"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Querengesser|first1=Tim|date=December 2013|title=Glen Coulthard &amp; the three Rs|url=http://www.northernpublicaffairs.ca/index/magazine/volume-2-issue-2-december-2013/profile-glen-coulthard-the-three-rs/|journal=Northern Public Affairs|volume=2|issue=2|pages=59–61|accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professors Brian Rice, a member of the [[Mohawk Nation]], and Anna Snyder agree with Coulthard's critique of the focus on residential schools as the singular issue to reconcile noting that the schools were only "one aspect of a larger project to absorb or assimilate Aboriginal people".&lt;ref name="RiceSnyder"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://speakingmytruth.ca/downloads/AHFvol1/04_Rice_Snyder.pdf|title="Speaking my truth" : reflections on reconciliation &amp; residential school|last1=Rice|first1=Brian|last2=Snyder|first2=Anna|date=2012|publisher=Aboriginal Healing Foundation|isbn=9780988127425|editor1-last=DeGagné|editor1-first=Mike|edition=Scholastic Edition/First Printing.|chapter=Reconciliation in the Context of a Settler Society: Healing the Legacy of Colonialism in Canada|accessdate=February 18, 2017|editor2-last=Dewar|editor2-first=Jonathan|editor3-last=Lowry|editor3-first=Glen}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|51}}

Many writers have observed the way the TRC historicizes the events of colonialism and fails to emphasize that uneven Indigenous-settler relationships are perpetual and ongoing .&lt;ref name="Garneau"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garneau|first1=David|date=2012|title=Imaginary Spaces of Conciliation and Reconciliation|url=http://reworksinprogress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/wcl74h.pdf|journal=West Coast Line|volume=46|issue=2|accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historicizing is further evident in the TRC's 'Principles of Reconciliation' where reconciliation is framed as grappling with harms of the past. &lt;ref name="TRCLearned"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nctr.ca/assets/reports/Final%20Reports/Principles_English_Web.pdf|title=What We Have Learned: Principles of Truth and Reconciliation|date=2015|publisher=What We Have Learned:  Principles of Truth and Reconciliation The Truth and Reconciliation  Commission of Canada|accessdate=February 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is problematic because it implies that colonialism is not ongoing and is not part of current government policy.&lt;ref name="Coulthard" /&gt; Because of this historicizing, the TRC concentrated its efforts largely on 'psychological' healing through the gathering and airing of stories; however, it lacked significant institutional change, particularly change to the kinds of government institutions involved in residential schools and other forms of colonial domination.&lt;ref name="Coulthard" /&gt;{{rp|121}} 

Another problematic premise of the Commission is that society is only allowed "reconciliation on terms still largely dictated by the state".&lt;ref name="Coulthard" /&gt;{{rp|127}}  Rather than allowing a grassroots movement to gain traction or forms of 'moral protest' to develop, it was the government that initiated the process of reconciliation and set the terms of it, thus it is still the colonial power that is dictating the terms of their colonial subjects' healing.&lt;ref name="Coulthard" /&gt;{{rp|167}}  This is clearly proven in the way the government "[imposed] a time limit on 'healing'"; so that this event can be reconciled and then moved on from.&lt;ref name="Garneau" /&gt;{{rp|36}} The approach by the Commission to engage with Indigenous peoples when and how it is most convenient for settlers can be seen as "yet another form of settler colonialism".&lt;ref name="TuckYang"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tuck|first1=Eve|last2=Yang|first2=K. Wayne|date=September 8, 2012|title=Decolonization is not a metaphor|url=http://decolonization.org/index.php/des/article/view/18630|journal=Decolonization: Indigeneity, Education &amp; Society|volume=1|issue=1|issn=1929-8692}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} Because Indigenous "recognition and reconciliation, from a Canadian perspective, [is] focused only on the wrongs of the past, and the situation as it exists today is ignored".&lt;ref name="Querengesser" /&gt;

Unlike the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa]], the Canadian commission had no power to offer known perpetrators of abuse the possibility of amnesty in exchange for honest testimony about any abuses that may have been committed. Nor were perpetrators held accountable via the commission. The Canadian commission heard primarily from former students.&lt;ref name="TRCSummary" /&gt;

===Questioning of findings===
Hymie Rubenstein, a retired professor of anthropology, and Rodney A. Clifton, professor emeritus of education and a residential school supervisor in the 1960s, held that, while the residential school program had been harmful to many students, the commission had shown "indifference to robust evidence gathering, comparative or contextual data, and cause-effect relationships," which resulted in the commission's report telling "a skewed and partial story".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/rubenstein-clifton-truth-and-reconciliation-report-tells-a-skewed-and-partial-story-of-residential-schools| last=Rubenstein| first=Hymie| last2=Rodney| first2=Clifton| title=Truth and Reconciliation report tells a 'skewed and partial story' of residential schools| date=June 22, 2015| newspaper=National Post| publisher=Post Media| accessdate=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Truth and Reconciliation Report did not compare its findings with rates and causes of mortality among Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children attending public schools. Rubenstein and Clifton noted that the report also failed to consider Indian residential schools were typically located in rural areas far from hospitals, making treatment more difficult to acquire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/clifton-rubenstein-debunking-the-half-truths-and-exaggerations-in-the-truth-and-reconciliation-report| last=Rubenstein| first=Hymie| last2=Rodney| first2=Clifton| title=Debunking the half-truths and exaggerations in the Truth and Reconciliation report| date=June 4, 2015| newspaper=National Post| publisher=Post Media| accessdate=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, [[Lynn Beyak]], a [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative member]] of the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] [[Standing committee (Canada)|Standing Committee]] of Aboriginal Peoples, voiced disapproval of the final TRC report, saying that it had omitted an "abundance of good" that was present in the schools.&lt;ref name="Ballingall"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ballingall|first1=Alex|title=Lynn Beyak calls removal from Senate committee 'a threat to freedom of speech'|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/04/06/lynn-beyak-calls-removal-from-senate-committee-a-threat-to-freedom-of-speech.html|accessdate=May 7, 2017|work=Toronto Star|date=April 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Galloway"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Galloway |first1=Gloria |title=Conservatives disavow Tory senator's positive views of residential schools |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/conservatives-disavow-tory-senators-positive-views-of-residential-schools/article34248144/ |accessdate=May 7, 2017 |work=The Globe and Mail |date=March 9, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170511115119/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/conservatives-disavow-tory-senators-positive-views-of-residential-schools/article34248144/ |archivedate=May 11, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Beyak's right to free speech was defended by some Conservative senators, her comments were widely criticized, including by [[Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs]] [[Carolyn Bennett]] and leader of the [[New Democratic Party]] [[Tom Mulcair]].&lt;ref name="Campion-Smith"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Campion-Smith|first1=Bruce|title=Senator dumped from aboriginal issues committee for controversial views|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/04/05/senator-dumped-from-aboriginal-issues-committee-for-controversial-views.html|accessdate=May 7, 2017|work=Toronto Star|date=April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Anglican Church also raised concerns stating in a release co-signed by bishops [[Fred Hiltz]] and [[Mark MacDonald (bishop)|Mark MacDonald]]: "There was nothing good about children going missing and no report being filed.

== Legacy ==

In August 2018, the [[Royal Canadian Geographical Society]] announced the release of the ''[[Indigenous Peoples Atlas of Canada]]'', an encyclopedia with content including information about indigenous lands, languages, communities, treaties, and cultures, and topics such as the [[Canadian Indian residential school system]], racism, and [[cultural appropriation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-indigenous-peoples-atlas-of-canada-launches-after-two-years-of-input/|title=Indigenous Peoples Atlas of Canada launches after two years of input from communities|last=Roy|first=Gabrielle|agency=[[The Canadian Press]]|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=August 29, 2018|accessdate=September 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created to address the Calls to Action, among them the development of "culturally appropriate curricula" for Aboriginal Canadian students.

'''''Tănase v. Moldova''''' (application No. 7/08) was a case decided by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in 2010.

==Background==
In 2008, Moldovan electoral law was changed to forbid persons with [[multiple citizenship]] from sitting in the parliament. That affected [[Alexandru Tănase]], from the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Moldova]]. Having been elected in 2009, he was forced to refuse Romanian citizenship to take his seat.

He launched a complaint before the Court. Romania was admitted as a third party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=867105&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECtHR Grand Chamber judgment - Para. 7]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgments==
In 2008, a Chamber of the Court decided that the provisions of Moldovan law violated Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The judgment was appealed by Moldova.

In 2010, the Grand Chamber unanimously found the ineligibility of persons with dual citizenship to violate Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. It was unanswered whether forbidding those with multiple nationalities from taking seats in Parliament pursued a legitimate aim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=867105&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECtHR Grand Chamber judgment - Para. 170]&lt;/ref&gt;

It found the law to be disproportionate and in violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=867105&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECtHR Grand Chamber judgment - Para. 180]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325''' (S/RES/1325), on women, peace, and security, was adopted unanimously by the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] on 31 October 2000, after recalling resolutions [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1261|1261]] (1999), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1265|1265]] (1999), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1296|1296]] (2000), and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1314|1314]] (2000). The [[United Nations Security Council resolution|resolution]] acknowledged the disproportionate and unique impact of [[armed conflict]] on women and girls. It calls for the adoption of a [[Gender mainstreaming|gender perspective]] to consider the special needs of women and girls during conflict, [[repatriation]] and [[human migration|resettlement]], rehabilitation, [[social integration|reintegration]], and post-conflict reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Security Council, unanimously adopting resolution 1325 (2000), calls for broad participation of women in peace-building post-conflict reconstruction|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2000/20001031.sc6942.doc.html|publisher=United Nations|date=31 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resolution 1325 was the first formal and legal document from the Security Council that required parties in a conflict to prevent violations of [[women's rights]], to support women's participation in [[peace negotiations]] and in post-conflict reconstruction, and to protect women and girls from [[Wartime sexual violence|sexual &lt;nowiki/&gt;and gender-based violence in armed conflict]]. It was also the first [[United Nations Security Council]] resolution to specifically mention the unique impact of conflict on women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peacewomen.org/SCR-1325 |date= |accessdate=4 February 2018|title=Security Council Resolution 1325|work=[[PeaceWomen]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution has since become an organizing framework for the women, peace, and security agenda, which focuses on advancing the components of Resolution 1325.

==Resolution==

===Observations===
The observations highlight how the Council considers the issue of women and armed conflict important to [[International security|international peace and security]]. They express the Council's concern about [[Civilian|civilians]] in armed conflict, particularly women and children, who constitute most of the victims of conflict and who are increasingly targeted by armed groups. Attacks against civilians, particularly women and children, negatively impact peace and reconciliation.

More specifically, the observations:
* Reaffirm the important role that women play in conflict prevention, conflict resolution, and [[Peacebuilding|peace-building.]] 
* Emphasize the importance of women's equal involvement in peace and security and the need for women's increased participation in conflict prevention and peace-building. 
* Reaffirm the importance of [[International humanitarian law|international humanitarian]] and [[International human rights law|human rights law]] in the protection of women and their rights. 
* Recognize the need to adopt a gender perspective in [[peacekeeping]] operations and training of peacekeeping personnel on the special needs of women and children in conflict and humanitarian settings.
* Recognizes that the protection of women and girls and their participation in peace processes is important to international peace and security.

===Acts===
The operational items in Resolution 1325 broadly call upon [[Member states of the United Nations|member states]] to address the needs of women and girls in armed conflict and support their participation in peace negotiations. The key components and recommendations of the resolution are:  
* '''Preventing sexual and gender-based violence in armed conflict:''' Resolution 1325 calls upon all parties to conflict to take special measures to protect women and girls from violence in armed conflict, particularly sexual and gender-based violence. It also calls for states to end [[impunity]] for [[crimes against humanity]], particularly [[sexual violence]], and prosecute offenders.  
* '''Peace negotiations:''' The resolution calls for including a gender perspective in peace negotiations and increasing women's participation in peace negotiation, with particular attention to supporting local women's peace initiatives.
* '''Protection of women and girls in refugee settings'''[[Refugee camp|:]] The resolution calls upon parties to conflict to consider the special needs of women in girls in designing and administering [[Refugee camp|refugee camps]].  
* '''[[Disarmament, demobilization and reintegration]] (DDR):''' It also calls for considering gender in DDR, particularly the different needs of male and female ex-[[Combatant|combatants]].  
* '''[[Women in government|Women's political participation]]:''' The resolution calls upon member states to increase women's participation at all levels of decision-making in national, regional, and [[International organization|international institutions]].  
* Incorporate a gender perspective into '''peacekeeping operations''', consider gender in Security Council missions, and consult with international and local women's organizations. 
* '''Provide training '''for the UN and member states on the protection, rights, and needs of women; gender sensitivity; and the importance of involving women in peacekeeping and peace-building measures. 
* '''Gender balancing in the UN''': Increase women's representation as Special Representatives and envoys, and in field operations, particularly among military observers, police, and human rights and humanitarian personnel. 
* '''Reporting''': The resolution requests that the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary-General]] conduct a study on the impact of armed conflict on women and girls, the role of women in peace-building, the gender dimensions of peace processes and conflict resolution, and on gender mainstreaming in UN peacekeeping missions. It also invites the Secretary-General to report the findings of these studies to the Security Council.
The resolution also calls upon all countries to fully respect international law applicable to the rights and protection of women and girls, in particular the obligation under the Geneva Convention of 1949 and Additional Protocol thereto of 1977, the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|1951 Refugee Convention]] and the Protocol thereto of 1967, the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW) and its [[Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women|Optional Protocol]], and the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] and both its [[Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict]] and its [[Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography]], and finally to bear in mind the provisions of the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]].

== History ==
The resolution was passed unanimously in October 2000 after extensive lobbying by the [http://www.womenpeacesecurity.org/ NGO Working Group on Women, Peace and Security (NGO WG)] and [[United Nations Development Fund for Women]] (UNIFEM; now succeeded by [[UN Women]]). [[Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah]], then Minister of Women's Affairs in [[Namibia]], initiated the resolution when the country took its turn chairing the Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.msmagazine.com/june03/landsberg.asp|title = Resolution 1325 - Use It or Lose It|last = Landsberg|first = Michelle|date = 2003|journal = Ms. Magazine|accessdate =23 August 2014 |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ambassador [[Anwarul Chowdhury]], representing [[Bangladesh]] at the Council, also made significant contributions by using Bangladesh's role as Council President to bring attention to women's contributions to peace and security. Chowdhury has remained a vocal and active advocate for full implementation of Resolution 1325.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.upf.org/resources/speeches-and-articles/3239-ak-chowdhury-women-essential-for-sustainable-peace|title = A.K. Chowdhury: Women Are Essential for Sustainable Peace|date = 31 October 2010|accessdate = 17 December 2014|website = Universal Peace Federation|publisher = |last = Chowdhury|first = Anwarul}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NGO Working Group played a critical role in successfully lobbying the Council to hold open sessions on women, peace, and security, consulting with Council members on the resolution, and providing them with applicable information.&lt;ref name="Tryggestad2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Tryggestad|first= Torunn L.|date= 1 October 2009|title= Trick or treat? The UN and implementation of security Council resolution 1325 on women, peace, and security|url= http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Trick+or+treat%3F+The+UN+and+implementation+of+security+Council...-a0215069791|journal= Global Governance|publisher= Lynne Rienner Publishers|volume= 15|issue= 4|pages= 539–557|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1995 [[Beijing Platform for Action]] contained an entire chapter focused on women, peace, and security. During the 1990s, the [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] community was increasingly concerned about the negative impacts of war on women, particularly widespread sexual violence seen in civil wars in [[Bosnian War|Bosnia]], West Africa, and [[Rwandan Civil War|Rwanda]]. Activists were also upset that women faced significant barriers to entering peace talks and the negative impacts that women experienced post-conflict. The Beijing Conference's 5th anniversary (Beijing+5) provided critical momentum for progress on women, peace, and security issues at the UN.

The resolution's history and passage is notable for the level of involvement by NGOs and [[civil society]], who helped draft the resolution. The two-day debate on the resolution was also the first time the Council dedicated a discussion to women.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cynthiacockburn.org/BlogNATO1325.pdf|title = Snagged On The Contradiction: NATO, UNSC Resolution 1325, and Feminist Responses|date = 2011|accessdate = 17 December 2014|website = |publisher = |last = Cockburn|first = Cynthia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation ==

=== United Nations ===
The two main components of Resolution 1325 are addressing sexual violence in armed conflict and increasing women's participation in peace processes and political institutions. Within the United Nations, the resolution has led to an increased attention to gender mainstreaming, or assessing a policy's different impacts for women and men. The main programs implementing the resolution are UN Women and the [[Department of Peacekeeping Operations]], although many other programs also apply it to their work.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://undocs.org/S/2010/173 |title = Women and peace and security: Report of the Secretary-General|date = 6 April 2010|accessdate = 10 March 2017|website = |publisher = United Nations Security Council|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Four pillars of implementation ====
In 2009, [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1889|Resolution 1889]] called on the Secretary-General to develop a set of indicators to track the implementation of Resolution 1325. The indicators are used for UN programming, but have also been adopted by member states and NGOs. The indicators developed are the four pillars of prevention, protection, participation, and relief and recovery.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* '''Prevention''' focuses on preventing sexual and gender-based violence, as well as gender awareness in conflict prevention and early warning systems. This includes preventing [[United Nations peacekeeping#Crimes by peacekeepers|sexual exploitation and abuse by peacekeeping forces]].
* '''Protection''' involves improving women and girls' safety, physical and mental health, [[economic security]], and overall well-being. It also focuses on improving the rights of women and girls and their legal protections.
* '''Participation''' refers to promoting women's participation in peace processes, increasing the numbers of women at all levels of decision-making institutions, and increasing partnerships with local women's organizations. Participation also includes increasing women's participation in the UN in senior positions, as Special Representatives and in peacekeeping missions and operations.
* '''Relief and recovery''' efforts should ensure the equal distribution of [[aid]] to women and girls and incorporate gender perspectives into relief and recovery efforts.
Specific indicators include tracking numbers related to outcomes, such as the number of women in peace negotiations, the number of military manuals that include measures on women's protection, or the number of cases investigated on violence against women.

=== National Action Plans ===
Two years after Resolution 1325 launched, the Security Council began encouraging the development of National Action Plans (NAPs) as a tool that member states could use to detail steps that they will take to fulfill the resolution's objectives. As of September 2016, [https://web.archive.org/web/20170703215409/https://actionplans.inclusivesecurity.org/ 63 countries] have adopted such plans. NAPs address political, social, and [[human security]] policies and often require interagency coordination. Many donor country NAPs tend to be externally focused, outlining and documenting their commitments to promoting Resolution 1325's principles in focal countries; developing and conflict-affected countries generally use NAPs to support women's internal participation in politics and peace processes, as well as outline internal commitments on protection from sexual and gender-based violence. Currently, Europe (27) and Africa (19) are the regions with the highest number of National Action Plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://actionplans.inclusivesecurity.org/|title=- National Action Plan Resource Center|website=National Action Plan Resource Center|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703215409/https://actionplans.inclusivesecurity.org/|archive-date=3 July 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the number of NAP countries rapidly increased in the lead up to both the 10th (in 2010) and 15th (in 2015) anniversaries of Resolution 1325, only 32% of UN member states have implemented NAPs. A major gap is in troop contributing countries (TCC) and police contributing countries (PCC) to peacekeeping missions—the top four countries providing police, military experts, and troops do not yet have national action plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/resources/statistics/contributors.shtml|title=Troop and police contributors. United Nations Peacekeeping|website=www.un.org|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Challenges to implementation ====
In order to hold implementers accountable, Resolution 1325 NAPs ought to contain a monitoring and evaluation framework that outlines specific progress indicators and assigns clear roles and responsibilities for monitoring and reporting activities. Also, few NAPs have actual allocated funding for development or implementation: a 2014 survey of NAPs revealed that funding most commonly went to addressing sexual and gender-based violence and increasing women's involvement in peace processes, while the most common funding gap was security sector reform and access to justice.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 2014|title=Financing for the Implementation of National Action Plans on UN Security Council Resolution 1325: Critical for Advancing Women's Human Rights, Peace and Security|url=https://www.cordaid.org/media/medialibrary/2014/10/FinancingUNSCR1325_2014_27oct.pdf|journal=|publisher=Cordaid and GNWP|doi=|pmid=|accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Local Action Plans and Regional Action Plans ====
Local Action Plans (LAPs) are a way to operationalize the resolution at the local and community levels. Countries such as [[Serbia]], [[Sierra Leone]], and the [[Philippines]] have implemented local level mechanisms for implementing the resolution and NAPs. Several [[Regional organization|regional organizations]] have adopted Regional Action Plans (RAPs), including the [[European Union]], [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), [[Economic Community of West African States|Economic Community Of West African States]] (ECOWAS), and the [[Pacific Islands Forum]]. RAPs coordinate regional priorities on women, peace, and security and help direct and prioritize regional organizations' programming and funding on the topic. NATO has used Resolution 1325 to increase the levels of women in the military and has influenced seven NATO member states to have increasing women's participation in the military as a goal in implementing the resolution.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 

=== Non-governmental organizations ===
NGOs play an important role in implementing Resolution 1325. NGOs have lobbied their national governments to develop National Action Plans and many NAPs have a NGO oversight body to hold governments accountable to their commitments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.hks.harvard.edu/cchrp/research/working_papers/Dharmapuri_Examples_for_NAPs_FINAL_3_12_12.pdf|title = A Survey of UN 1325 National Action Plan Mechanisms for Implementation, Monitoring, Reporting and Evaluation|last = Dharmapuri|first = Sahana|date = November 2011|journal = |accessdate = 17 December 2014|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grassroots NGOs, particularly women's organizations, also use UNSCR 1325 in conflict-affected countries to lobby their governments to comply with the resolution on the issues of including women in conflict negotiations or holding peacekeeping missions accountable for sexual abuse and exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://genderandsecurity.org/sites/default/files/carol_cohn_working_paper_204.pdf|title = Mainstreaming Gender in UN Security Policy: A Path to Political Transformation?|last = Cohn|first = Carol|date = 2003|journal = |accessdate = 16 December 2014|doi = |pmid = |issue = 204|publisher = Consortium on Gender, Security, and Human Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established international NGOs play an important role in disseminating information on the resolution to grassroots organizations and training local actors on the resolution and how to use it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.gnwp.org/|title = Global Network of Women's Peacebuilders|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resolution 1325 is used around the world as a policy tool to implement gender-sensitive conflict-related policies. It is also used as an organizing framework for actors outside of the United Nations, such as states, NGOs, and researchers, in a way that no other Security Council resolution has been used. For example, it is the only resolution to have its anniversary celebrated with reports, conferences, and special sessions of the Security Council, as well as the only resolution with NGOs dedicated to its implementation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://genderandsecurity.org/sites/default/files/felicity_hill_carol_cohn_and_cynthia_enloe_consortium_lecture_1-20-2004.pdf|title = U.N. Security Council Resolution 1325 Three Years On: Gender, Security and Organizational Change|last = Hill|first = Felicity|date = 20 January 2004|journal = |accessdate = 16 December 2014|doi = |pmid = |last2 = Cohn|first2 = Carol|last3 = Enloe|first3 = Cynthia|publisher = Consortium on Gender, Security, and Human Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2000, women, peace, and security has become an important topic in international politics, undoubtedly fueled by the resolution's passage and subsequent advocacy for its implementation, as well as increased attention to sexual violence in armed conflict. Another major landmark was the [[2011 Nobel Peace Prize]], awarded to [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]], [[Leymah Gbowee]], and [[Tawakkol Karman]] "for their non-violent struggle for the safety of women and for women's rights to full participation in peace-building work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2011/|title = Nobelprize.org|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the topic of women and war became more prominent, more policy-making bodies turned to the resolution and supported it.

Within the UN, the resolution precipitated increased attention to the issue of women and conflict. Prior to Resolution 1325, the Security Council rarely considered women apart from the occasional passing reference to women and children as vulnerable groups in conflict in need of protection. Since its passage, the Security Council has passed six more resolutions related to the topic of women and armed conflict. Furthermore, there has been a significant change in rhetoric, with more and more UN agencies, representatives, and member states discussing how gender inequality impacts peace and security. However, it has been suggested that these changes have been limited, with only 33 out of 225 Security Council resolutions passed in the three years after the passage of Resolution 1325 mentioning the words "gender" or "women".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

=== Outcomes ===
Assessments of Resolution 1325 include annual Secretary-General reports in 2013 and 2014 and a conducted ten-year review of Resolution 1325 implementation conducted by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations looking at twelve UN peacekeeping missions and reported outcomes across the components of the resolution.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/documents/10year_impact_study_1325.pdf|title = Ten-year Impact Study on Implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000) on Women, Peace and Security in Peacekeeping: Final Report to the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations, Department of Field Support|last = |first = |date = 2010|journal = |accessdate = 16 December 2014|doi = |pmid = |publisher = United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; Findings include:
* Women's political participation has had largely positive outcomes, with host countries seeing higher rates of female voters and politicians, as well as increased legal provisions to support gender equality. 
* There continued to be low levels of women in peace negotiations, with women comprising less than 10% of those formally involved across all missions. 
** &lt;span&gt;Academic research found that women were significantly more likely to be mentioned in peace processes and agreements after Resolution 1325.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=6&amp;fid=7923399&amp;jid=ILQ&amp;volumeId=59&amp;issueId=04&amp;aid=7923398&amp;bodyId=&amp;membershipNumber=&amp;societyETOCSession=&amp;fulltextType=RA&amp;fileId=S002058931000062X#cjotab_tab002|title = Peace Agreements or Pieces of Paper?

** The majority of UN-supported peace processes in 2011–2013 held regular consultations with women's organizations, and, in 2012 and 2013, all UN support teams included women.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  
* Security sector institutions saw limited gains in female uniformed personnel, despite increases in the number of uniformed women in peacekeeping missions. 
* More peacekeeping operations missions have gender advisors—as of 2014, nine of the sixteen missions have gender advisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://peacewomen.org/peacewomen_and_the_un/un-implementation/secretariat/entity/46/department-of-peacekeeping-operations-dpko|title = Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO)|date = 28 August 2014|accessdate = 17 December 2014|website = Peacewomen|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* There are mixed results in gender mainstreaming in DDR—some missions increased the numbers of women demobilized, but these gains were uneven across missions and reintegration remains a challenge. 
* Sexual and gender-based violence continues to be widespread with impunity for those who commit it, despite increases in training and legislation. 
** &lt;span&gt;Reports of sexual abuse and exploitation by peacekeeping forces continue to rise, despite increased attention to this problem within the UN.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  
** Furthermore, women peace-builders and activists are regularly victims of violence and lack protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.thegenderadvisor.com/_content/publications/GR2P_004_02_pp241-271.pdf|title = Implementing UN Security Council Resolution 1325: Putting the Responsibility to Protect into Practice|last = Dharmapuri|first = Sahana|date = 2012|journal = Global Responsibility to Protect|accessdate = 17 December 2014|doi = 10.1163/187598412X639728|pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Missions made a greater effort to protect women in refugee and [[internally displaced person]] settings through increased patrols and escorts, but resources for these protections were limited. 
The 2014 Secretary-General's report on implementation of Resolution 1325 found that, while gender seems to be increasingly integrated into United Nations operations, challenges remain in fully implementing the resolution at the operational level.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://undocs.org/S/2014/693 |title = Report of the Secretary-General on women and peace and security|date = 23 September 2014|accessdate = 10 March 2017|website = |publisher = |last = |first = |series = S/2014/693}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the UN, women, peace, and security is part of the rhetoric on peace and security: Security Council resolutions increasingly mention gender, UN Mission reports frequently mention women, peace, and security, and there is increased reporting on these issues in UN bodies. However, there continued to be widespread reports of sexual abuse and exploitation by peacekeeping operations, despite increased attention to the issue within the UN.

In honor of the resolution's 15th anniversary in 2015, the United Nations held a High-level Review of Resolution 1325 "to assess progress and accelerate action" at the Security Council's Open Debate on Women, Peace, and Security on October 13th, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/women-peace-security|title=High-level Review on Women, Peace and Security: 15 years of Security Council resolution 1325|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the debate, UN Women published ''Preventing Conflict, Transforming Justice, Securing the Peace: A Global Study on the Implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wps.unwomen.org/pdf/en/GlobalStudy_EN_Web.pdf |title=Preventing Conflict, Transforming Justice, Securing the Peace: A Global Study on the Implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325|publisher=|access-date=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report covers progress and challenges, and makes recommendations for advancing the goals of the resolution across societal sectors.

In April 2016, UN Women and the Inclusive Peace and Transition Initiative, led by peace process expert [[Thania Paffenholz]], issued a report initially prepared as an input for the High-Level Review, assessing women's inclusion and influence on peace negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inclusivepeace.org/sites/default/files/IPTI-UN-Women-Report-Making-Women-Count-60-Pages.pdf Thania Paffenholz, Nick Ross, Steven Dixon, Anna-Lena Schluchter  and Jacqui True, “Making Women Count - Not Just Counting  Women: Assessing Women’s Inclusion and Influence on Peace  Negotiations,” Geneva: Inclusive Peace and Transition Initiative  (The Graduate Institute of International and Development  Studies) and UN Women, April 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==

=== Gender essentialism ===
Some [[Feminism|feminists]] criticize Resolution 1325 for relying on [[Essentialism|essentialist]] portrayals of women, rendering women as perpetual victims, and ignoring women's agency to bring about both violence and peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gender, Violence &amp; Security|last = Shepherd|first = Laura J.|publisher = Zed Books Ltd|year = 2008|isbn = 978 1 84277 927 9|location = London, UK|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, reports of violence against civilians tend to emphasize that "women and children" as victims to illustrate the brutal nature of violence. Conversely, this framing also implies that men are not victims, despite male victims of sexual violence or the gender-based violence of killing men because they are men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://sdi.sagepub.com/content/37/1/83.short|title = Recognizing Gender-Based Violence Against Civilian Men and Boys in Conflict Situations|last = Carpenter|first = R. Charli|date = 2006|journal = Security Dialogue|accessdate = 16 December 2014|doi = 10.1177/0967010606064139|pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender essentialism also assumes that women are innately peaceful, usually due to their experience as mothers, which is one of the main reasons that people use to argue for including women in peace processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gender, Violence &amp; Security|last = Shepherd|first = Laura J.|publisher = Zed Books Ltd.|year = 2008|isbn = 978 1 84277 927 9|location = London, UK|pages = 88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another frequently cited gender essentialist argument is that women are natural coalition builders and are more likely to work with members of other groups. Resolution 1325 incorporates these assumptions and they are frequently cited in the Secretary-General Reports, advocacy movements, and National Action Plans. The result is that women often feel the need to conform to certain [[Stereotype|stereotypes]] and that women who do not fit these ideals are marginalized in politics and policy.

=== Exclusive focus on women ===
A related criticism to that of gender essentialism is that by focusing exclusively on women the role of men is overlooked. According to this line of criticism, the values and attitudes among both men and women are more important than biological sex for violence and peace. Both men and women who hold feminist values, and thus are positive to gender equality, tend to be less warlike and intolerant. Since gender does not equal biological sex it is more relevant to focus on [[Masculinity|masculinities]] and [[Femininity|femininities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/wps/2017/06/08/what-does-a-feminist-foreign-policy-have-to-do-with-men/|title=What does a feminist foreign policy have to do with men?|date=2017-06-08|work=LSE Women, Peace and Security blog|access-date=2017-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a study of political activists in Thailand found that men who identify with ideals of manhood emphasizing male superiority over women and the need for real men to be fierce and tough are more likely to participate in political violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bjarnegård|first=Elin|last2=Brounéus|first2=Karen|last3=Melander|first3=Erik|date=2017-10-18|title=Honor and political violence|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022343317711241|journal=Journal of Peace Research|language=en|doi=10.1177/0022343317711241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender mainstreaming ===
Resolution 1325 supports [[gender mainstreaming]], or the incorporation of a gender perspective into all policies and programs, in peacekeeping missions and other UN programs related to peace and security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Text of Resolution 1325|url=https://undocs.org/S/RES/1325(2000)|website=undocs.org|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=10 March 2017|language=en |at=para 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics argue that other parts of the resolutions, such as having a Senior Gender Advisor, lead to the segregation of women's rights from all other peace and security issues, with women's issues thus becoming sidelined in a "gender ghetto" and remaining outside of the mainstream.&lt;ref name="Puechguirbal2010"&gt;Puechguirbal, Nadine. "Peacekeeping, Peace building and Post-conflict Reconstruction". In ''Gender Matters in Global Politics'', edited by Katharine Sarikakis and Leslie Regan Shade, 161-175. London and New York: Routledge, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; By limiting women's issues to Gender Advisers or offices, security institutions continue to view gender issues as a niche topic and the institutions remain male-dominated systems. [[Germany]] initially did not implement a 1325 National Action Plan for this reason, arguing that it had mainstreamed gender concerns into its government agencies and policies, although it later implemented one in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.peacewomen.org/assets/file/NationalActionPlans/miladpournikanalysisdocs/igis_womeninpeaceandsecuritythroughunsr1325_millerpournikswaine_2014.pdf|title = Women in Peace and Security through United Nations Security Resolution 1325: Literature Review, Content Analysis of National Action Plans, and Implementation|last = Miller|first = Barbara|date = May 2014|journal = |accessdate = 17 December 2014|doi = |pmid = |last2 = Pournik|first2 = Milad|publisher = Institute for Global and International Studies|page = 16|last3 = Swaine|first3 = Aisling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impacts ===
Despite the attention to implementing Resolution 1325 and developing indicators, there is little evidence of impacts in conflict-affected countries. The UN's own evaluations show limited progress only in a few areas, most notably women's political participation. Furthermore, the resolution depends on many unproven assumptions, such as the potential for women's participation to have a transformational effect on peace and security.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, recent initiatives have emphasized the need for more data to track results, including the upcoming High-Level Review of the resolution, which will likely provide more thorough analysis of its implementation and effects.

==Related groups==
The NGO Working Group on Women, Peace and Security is a coalition of eighteen NGOs, which collectively advocate for the equal and full participation of women in all efforts to create and maintain international peace and security. Formed in 2000 to call for a Security Council resolution on women, peace, and security, original members were:
* [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]] (WILPF)
* [[Amnesty International]] (AI)
* [[International Alert]] (IA)
* [[Women's Commission For Refugee Women and Children|Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children]] (WCRWC)
* Hague Appeal for Peace (HAP)
The NGO Working Group now focuses on implementation of all Security Council resolutions that address women, peace, and security. The group is still active, producing a monthly action points on the women, peace, and security issues affecting countries on Council's agenda.

[[PeaceWomen]]—one of the founding members of the NGO Working Group—is a project sponsored by the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom to promote the implementation of Resolution 1325, through providing a centralized hub of information on information related to women, peace, and security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peacewomen.org/ |title=WILPF |publisher=Peacewomen |date= |accessdate=2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Friends of 1325]] is an informal or ''ad hoc'' group of UN member states who formed to advocate for the implementation of Resolution 1325; it is organized by [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Korieh|first=Chima Jacob|title=Gendering global transformations: gender, culture, race, and identity|year=2008|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-96325-1|page=206|author2=Okeke-Ihejirika, Philomina Ezeagbor }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related resolutions ==
Resolution 1325 is related to several other resolutions related to the topic of women, peace, and security, passed since 2000. These include:
* [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1820|Resolution 1820]] (2008), which condemns sexual violence as a weapon of war and declares [[rape]] and other forms of sexual violence as [[War crime|war crimes]].
* [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1888|Resolution 1888]] (2009), which mandates that peacekeeping missions prevent and respond to sexual violence and which led to the creation of The Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Armed Conflict.
* Resolution 1889 (2009) on increasing women's participation in peace processes. This requests that the Secretary-General develop indicators to track the implementation of 1325, and establishes Women Protection Advisors to be deployed with peacekeeping missions.
* [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1960|Resolution 1960]] (2010) focuses on ending impunity for sexual violence in armed conflict by calling on the Secretary-General to "name and shame" armed groups that perpetrate sexual violence and for sanctions to deter conflict-related sexual violence.
* [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2106|Resolution 2106]] (2013)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://undocs.org/S/RES/2106(2013)|title=Resolution 2106|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to address impunity on sexual violence in armed conflict and operationalize past resolutions. It also recognizes that sexual violence in conflict can also affect men and boys, as well as the community-wide trauma that sexual violence can inflict.
* [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2122|Resolution 2122]] (2013)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://undocs.org/S/RES/2122(2013)|title=Resolution 2122|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; reaffirms the Council's commitment to combating sexual violence in armed conflict and the full implementation of Resolution 1325 and other resolutions on women, peace, and security.

The details of process were the subject of debate among several [[telecommunication]]s companies, including [[Verizon Wireless]], [[AT&amp;T Mobility]], as well as the Internet company [[Google]].  Much of the debate swirled around the "[[open access]]" requirements set down by the Second Report and Order released by the FCC determining the process and rules for the auction.  All bidding was required by law to commence by January 28.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

== Overview ==
Full-power [[TV station]]s were forced [[DTV transition in the United States|to transition to digital broadcasting]] in order to free 108&amp;nbsp;MHz of [[radio spectrum]] for newer [[wireless]] services.  Most analog broadcasts ceased on June 12, 2009.

The 700&amp;nbsp;MHz spectrum was previously used for analog [[television broadcasting]], specifically [[Ultra High Frequency#United States 2|UHF channels 52 through 69]]. The FCC ruled that the [[digital television transition]] would no longer be necessary because of the improved [[spectral efficiency]] of digital broadcasts. Digital broadcasts allow TV channels to be broadcast on [[adjacent channel]]s without having to leave [[white space (radio)|empty]] [[TV channel]]s as [[guard band]]s between them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wireless.fcc.gov/services/index.htm?job=about&amp;id=lower700 wireless.fcc.gov FCC] on "Lower 700 MHz"&lt;/ref&gt; All broadcasters were required to move to the frequencies occupied by channels 2 through 51 as part of the digital TV transition.

===Precedents===
A similar reallocation was employed in 1989 to expand [[Advanced Mobile Phone System#Frequency bands|analog cellphone service]], having previously eliminated TV channels 70-83 at the uppermost UHF frequencies.  This created an unusual situation where old TV tuning equipment was able to [[eavesdropping|listen to]] cellular [[phone call]]s, although such activity was made illegal and the FCC prohibited the sale of future devices with that capability.

===Prior auctions===
Some of the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz [[spectrum license]]s were already auctioned in Auctions 44 and 49. Paired channels 54/59 (lower-700&amp;nbsp;MHz block C) and unpaired channel 55 (block D) were sold and in some areas were already being used for broadcasting and Internet access. For example, Qualcomm [[MediaFLO]] in 2007 started using channel 55 for broadcasting [[mobile TV]] to cell phones in New York, San Diego, Atlanta, and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qualcomm.com/press/releases/2008/080417_Live_TV_Debuts_on_Verizon_Wireless_Cell_Phones_in_San_Diego.html MediaFlo live TV] press release&lt;/ref&gt; Qualcomm later ended the service and sold (at a large profit) channel 55 nationwide to AT&amp;T Mobility, along with channel 56 in the [[Northeast Corridor]] and much of [[California]].  [[Dish Network]] bought channel 56 (block E) licenses in the remainder of the nation's [[media market]]s, so far using it only for testing [[ATSC-M/H]].  {{As of|2015}}, AT&amp;T does not appear to be using block D or E (band class 29) yet, but plans to use [[link aggregation]] for increased [[download]] speeds and capacity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fiercewireless.com/story/att-unveils-lte-phone-supports-700-mhz-spectrum-it-got-qualcomm/2014-07-15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Auction rules and process==
For the 700-MHz auction, the FCC designed a new multi-round process that limits the number of package bids that each bidder can submit (12 items and 12 package bids) and the prices at which they can be submitted, provides computationally intensive feedback prices similar to the pricing approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Porter|first=David|author2=Stephen Rassenti |author3=Anil Roopnarine |author4=Vernon Smith |title=Combinatorial Auction Design|journal=Interdisciplicary Center for Economic Science, George Mason University|date=June 17, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This package bidding process (which is often referred to as [[combinatorial auction]]s) was the first of its kind to be used by the FCC in an actual auction.  Bidders were allowed to bid on individual licenses or on an all-or-nothing bid which could be done up to twelve packages, which the bidder determined at any point in the auction. Doing the auction this way allowed the bidder to avoid the exposure problem when licenses are complements.  The provisional winning bids are the set of consistent bids that maximize total revenues.  The 700&amp;nbsp;MHz auction represented a good test-case for package bidding for two reasons.  First, the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz auction only involves 12 licenses: 2 bands (one 10&amp;nbsp;MHz and one 20&amp;nbsp;MHz) in each of the 6 regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cramton|first=Peter|title=Spectrum Auctions|journal=Handbook of Telecommunications Economics|date=February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Secondly, prospective bidders had expressed interest in alternative packaging because some Internet service providers had different needs and the flexibility would benefit them.  The FCC issued Public Notice DA00-1486 adopted and described the package bidding rules for the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz auction.
 
The FCC's original proposal allowed only nine package bids: the six 30&amp;nbsp;MHz regional bids and three nationwide bids (10, 20, or 30&amp;nbsp;MHz).  Although these nine packages were consistent with the expressed desires or many prospective bidders, others felt that the nine packages were too restrictive. The activity rule is unchanged, aside from a new definition of activity and a lower activity requirement of 50%.  A bidder must be active on 50% of its current eligibility or its eligibility in the next round will be reduced to two times its activity.  Bids made in different rounds were treated as mutually exclusive and a bidder wishing to add a license or package to its provisional winnings must renew the provisional winning bids in the current round. 
 
The FCC placed rules on [[Public safety network|public safety]] for the auction.  20&amp;nbsp;MHz of the valuable 700&amp;nbsp;MHz spectrum were set aside for the creation of a public/private partnership that will eventually roll out to a new nationwide broadband network tailored to the requirements of public safety.  The FCC offered the commercial licensee extra spectrum adjacent to the public safety block that the licensee can use as it wants.  The licensee is allowed to use whatever bandwidth that is available on the public safety side of the network to offer data services of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Nate|title=FCC Sets 700MHz Auction Rules: Limited Open Access, No Wholesale Requirement|url=https://arstechnica.com/old/content/2007/07/fcc-sets-700mhz-auction-rules-limited-open-access-no-wholesale-requirement.ars|publisher=Ars Technica|accessdate=2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to encourage [[network neutrality]], groups such as [[Public Knowledge]], [[MoveOn.org]], [[Media Access Project]], along with individuals such as [[Craigslist]] founder [[Craig Newmark]], and Harvard Law professor [[Lawrence Lessig]] appealed to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] to make the newly freed airways open access to the public.&lt;ref name=cnet&gt;{{cite web

Prior to the bidding process, Google asked that the spectrum be free to lease wholesale and the devices operating under the spectrum be open. At the time, many providers such as Verizon and AT&amp;T used technological measures to block external applications. In return, Google guaranteed a minimum bid of $4.6 billion.  Google's specific requests were the adoption of these policies:

* Open applications: Consumers should be able to download and utilize any software applications, content, or services they desire;
* Open devices: Consumers should be able to utilize a handheld communications device with whatever wireless network they prefer;
* Open services: Third parties (resellers) should be able to acquire wireless services from a 700&amp;nbsp;MHz licensee on a wholesale basis, based on reasonably nondiscriminatory commercial terms; and
* Open networks: Third parties (like internet service providers) should be able to interconnect at any technically feasible point in a 700&amp;nbsp;MHz licensee's wireless network.&lt;ref name =GooglePress&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this was that it could push up the price of the bidding process in order to reach the US$4.6B reserve price, therefore triggering the open source restrictions listed above.  Had Google not been actively involved in the bidding process, it would have made sense for businesses to suppress their bidding strategies in order to trigger a new auction without the restrictions imposed by Google and the FCC.&lt;ref name=Brusco /&gt; Google's upfront payment of $287 million in order to participate in the bidding process was largely recovered after the auction since it had not actually purchased any licences.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google had wanted the purchaser to allow 'rental' of the blocks to different providers.

In retaliation, Verizon filed a lawsuit against the Federal Communications Commission to remove the provisions Google had asked for. Verizon called the rules "arbitrary and capricious, unsupported by substantial evidence and otherwise contrary to law."&lt;ref name=gigaom&gt;{{cite web

== Lawsuits ==
After the open access rules were implemented, [[Verizon Wireless]] filed suit against the FCC on September 13, 2007, seeking to have the rules dismissed on the grounds that the open access requirement "violates the [[U.S. Constitution]], violates the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedures Act]] … and is arbitrary, capricious, unsupported by the substantial evidence and otherwise contrary to law."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcrnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070913/FREE/70913010/1005/rss01 Verizon lawsuit]&lt;/ref&gt; On October 23, Verizon chose to drop the lawsuit after losing its appeal for a speedy resolution on October 3. However, the [[CTIA - The Wireless Association|CTIA]] stepped in to challenge the same regulations in a lawsuit filed the same day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcrnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071023/FREE/71023006/1007/rss01 CTIA steps in]&lt;/ref&gt;  On November 13, 2008, the CTIA dropped its lawsuit against the FCC.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcworld.com/article/153848/ctia_drops_lawsuit_against_fccs_open_access_rules.html CTIA Drops Lawsuit Against FCC's Open Access Rules - PCWorld Business Center&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Auction ==
The auction divided UHF spectrum into five blocks:&lt;ref name="700 MHz Band Plan"&gt;[http://wireless.fcc.gov/auctions/data/bandplans/700MHzBandPlan.pdf 700 MHzBand Plan]&lt;/ref&gt;

* lower block A: 12&amp;nbsp;MHz bandwidth (698–704 and 728–734&amp;nbsp;MHz, TV 52 and 57)
* lower block B: 12&amp;nbsp;MHz bandwidth (704–710 and 734–740&amp;nbsp;MHz, TV 53 and 58)
* lower block E: 6&amp;nbsp;MHz bandwidth (722–728&amp;nbsp;MHz, TV 56)
* upper block C: 22&amp;nbsp;MHz bandwidth (746–757 and 776–787&amp;nbsp;MHz, TV 60/61 and 65/66)
* upper block D: 10&amp;nbsp;MHz bandwidth (758–763 and 788–793&amp;nbsp;MHz, TV 62 and 67)

The FCC placed very detailed rules about the process of this auction of the 698–806&amp;nbsp;MHz part of the wireless spectrum. Bids were anonymous and designed to promote competition. The aggregate [[reserve price]] for all block C licenses was approximately $4.6 billion.&lt;ref name="fjallfoss1"&gt;{{Citation|title=FCC 07-132|url= http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-07-132A1.pdf|year=2007|author=F.C.C.|accessdate=2011-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total reserve price for all five blocks being auctioned in Auction 73 was just over $10 billion.&lt;ref name="fjallfoss1"/&gt;

==Results of the auction==
Auction 73 generally went as planned by telecommunications analysts. In total, Auction 73 raised $19.592 billion.&lt;ref name="wireless.fcc.gov"&gt;http://wireless.fcc.gov/auctions/default.htm?job=auction_summary&amp;id=73&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, [[Verizon Wireless]] and [[AT&amp;T Mobility]] together accounted for $16.3 billion of the total revenue. Of the 214 approved applicants, 101 successfully purchased at least one license. Despite their heavy involvement with the auction, [[Google]] did not purchase any licenses. However, Google did place the minimum bid on Block C licenses in order to ensure that the license would be required to be open-access.
&lt;ref name=RCRWireless&gt;{{Citation|title=700 MHz auction ends|url=http://www.rcrwireless.com/ARTICLE/20080321/SUB/594478393/700-mhz-auction-ends|year=2008|journal=RCRWireless|last1=Silva|first1=Jeffrey|last2=Dano|first2=Mike|accessdate=2011-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results for each of the five blocks:
* Block A – Verizon Wireless and [[U.S. Cellular]] both bought 25 licenses each. In this block, Verizon targeted urban areas, while U.S. Cellular bought licenses primarily in the northern portion of the U.S. [[Cavalier Telephone]] and [[CenturyLink|CenturyTel]] also bought 23 and 21 licenses, respectively.&lt;ref name=RCRWireless /&gt;
* Block B – AT&amp;T Mobility was the biggest buyer in the B block, with 227 licenses totaling $6.6 billion. U.S. Cellular and Verizon bought 127 and 77 licenses, respectively. AT&amp;T Mobility and Verizon Wireless bought licenses around the country, while U.S. Cellular continued with its strategy to buy licenses in northern regions.&lt;ref name=RCRWireless /&gt;
* Block C – Of the 10 licenses in the C Block, Verizon Wireless bought the 7 that cover the contiguous 48 states (and Hawaii). Those seven licenses cost Verizon roughly $4.7 Billion. Of the other three, [[Triad Broadcasting]] bought the two covering Alaska, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, while [[Small Ventures USA L.P.]]  bought the one covering the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;ref name=RCRWireless /&gt;
* Block D – Amid some controversy, no licenses were sold in Block D because the reserve price was not met.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Mobile-and-Wireless/Ethical-Concerns-Swirl-Around-D-Block-Spectrum-Auction/ Ethical Concerns Swirl Around D Block Spectrum Auction]&lt;/ref&gt; The FCC had set the reserve price on the spectrum at $1.3 billion, but the highest bidder ([[Qualcomm]]) only bid $472 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.informationweek.com/news/mobility/business/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=207400019&amp;cid=tab_art_tele&lt;/ref&gt; This piece of spectrum remains unsold and has not been scheduled for another auction.&lt;ref name="wireless.fcc.gov"/&gt;
* Block E – [[EchoStar]] spent $711 million to purchase 168 of the 176 available Block E licenses. This block, made up of unpaired spectrum, will likely be used to stream television shows. Qualcomm also bought 5 licenses.&lt;ref name=RCRWireless /&gt;

After the end of Auction 73, there remained some licenses that either went unsold or were defaulted on by the winning bidder from Blocks A and B. A new auction, Auction 92, was held on July 19, 2011 to sell the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz band licenses that were still available. The auction closed on July 28, 2011,&lt;ref&gt;http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-11-1269A1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; with 7 bidders having won 16 licenses worth $19.8 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://wireless.fcc.gov/auctions/default.htm?job=auction_summary&amp;id=92&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;span id="interop"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

== Interoperability issues==
Six years after the end of the auction of 700&amp;nbsp;MHz spectrum, block A remained largely unused, although [[T-Mobile USA]] began to deploy its extended-range LTE in 2015 on licenses purchased from Verizon Wireless and cleared of [[RF interference]] in several areas by TV stations changing off of channel 51.  This delay was caused by technical issues which were [[regulatory]] and possibly [[anticompetitive]] in nature.

After the March 2008 conclusion of Auction 73, Motorola initiated steps to have [[3GPP]] establish a new industry standard (later designated as band class 17) that would be limited to the lower 700&amp;nbsp;MHz B and C blocks. In proposing band class 17, Motorola cited the need to address concerns about high-power  transmissions of TV stations still broadcasting on channel 51 and the lower-700&amp;nbsp;MHz D and E blocks.  As envisioned and ultimately adopted, the band class 17 standard allows [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] operations in only the lower-700&amp;nbsp;MHz B and C blocks using a specific signaling protocol that would filter out all other frequencies. Although band class 17 operates on two of the three blocks common to band class 12, band class 17 devices use more narrow [[electronic filter]]s, which have the effect of permitting a smaller range of frequencies to [[bandpass|pass through]] the filter. In addition, band class 12 and 17 [[signaling (telecommunications)|signaling]] [[Communications protocol|protocol]]s are not compatible.&lt;ref name="FCC_Order"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-13-136A1.pdf|title=REPORT AND ORDER AND ORDER OF PROPOSED MODIFICATION|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|date=2013-10-29|accessdate=2014-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of two non-interoperable band classes has had numerous effects.  Customers are unable to switch between a licensee deploying its service using band class 17 and a licensee that provides its service using band class 12 without purchasing a new device (even when 
the two operators use the same 2G and 3G technologies and bands), and band class 12 and 17 devices cannot [[roaming|roam]] on each other's [[cellular network]]s.&lt;ref name="FCC_Order"/&gt;

When deploying its LTE network, [[C Spire Wireless]] decided not to use A block because of the lack of band-12 support in [[mobile device]]s, issues with roaming, and the increased cost of [[base station]]s due to lack of supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercewireless.com/story/c-spires-lte-network-wont-support-its-700-mhz-spectrum/2012-07-06|title=C Spire's LTE network won't support its 700 MHz spectrum|publisher=FierceWireless|date=2012-07-12|accessdate=2014-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; US Cellular deployed a band class 12 LTE network, however not all of US Cellular's devices were able to access it. In particular, the [[iPhone 5S]] and [[iPhone 5C]] could not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercewireless.com/tech/story/us-cellular-spectrum-partner-bewails-absence-band-12-apples-iphone/2013-05-30|publisher=FierceWirelesstitle|title=U.S. Cellular spectrum partner bewails absence of Band 12 in Apple's iPhone|date=2013-05-30|accessdate=2014-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other wireless telecommunication providers launched LTE band class 12 networks, but have not been able to offer [[smartphone]]s that access them, instead resorting to [[wireless broadband|fixed]] or [[mobile broadband modem|mobile]] wireless broadband modems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegeography.com/products/commsupdate/articles/2012/11/06/the-grass-is-always-bluer-on-the-other-side-rural-lte-launched-in-kentucky/ |title=The Grass is always Bluer on the other side: rural LTE launched in Kentucky |publisher=TeleGeography |date=2012-11-06 |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2015, only three telecom providers were offering smartphones that use band 12: US Cellular, T-Mobile USA, and Nex-Tech Wireless.

While smaller US telecommunication providers were upset at the lack of interoperability, [[AT&amp;T Mobility|AT&amp;T]] defended the creation of band 17 and told the other carriers to seek interoperability with [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]] and [[T-Mobile US|T-Mobile]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercebroadbandwireless.com/story/att-rural-carriers-seek-lte-interoperability-sprint-t-mobile/2012-09-16 |title=AT&amp;T to rural carriers: Seek LTE interoperability with Sprint, T-Mobile |publisher=FierceBroadbandWireless |date=2012-09-16 |accessdate=2013-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in September 2013, AT&amp;T changed their stance and committed to support and sell band-12 devices &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercewireless.com/story/att-does-about-face-will-support-700-mhz-interoperability/2013-09-10|title=AT&amp;T does an about-face, will support 700 MHz interoperability|publisher=FierceWireless|date=2013-09-10|accessdate=2014-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following AT&amp;T's commitment the Federal Communications Commission ruled:&lt;ref name="FCC_Order"/&gt;

* AT&amp;T must fully deploy a Multi-Frequency Band Indicator (MFBI) [[software feature]] in its 700&amp;nbsp;MHz network within 24 months of September 30, 2013. The end of the 24-month period will also commence the beginning of the band-12-capable device rollout period. 
* Once MFBI has been fully implemented by AT&amp;T, AT&amp;T shall provide LTE roaming to carriers with compatible band-12 devices.
* During the first year of the device rollout period, 50% of all new unique devices will be band-12 capable.
* Commencing at the conclusion of the second year of the device rollout period, all new unique devices will be band-12 capable.

Consistent with these commitments, AT&amp;T anticipates that its focus and advocacy within the 3GPP standards setting process will shift to band-12-related projects and work streams. AT&amp;T must place priority within the 3GPP RAN committee on the development of various band-12 carrier-aggregation scenarios. Upon completing implementation of the MFBI feature, AT&amp;T anticipates that its focus on new standards related to the paired lower-700&amp;nbsp;MHz spectrum will be almost exclusively on band 12 configurations, features and capabilities.&lt;ref name="FCC_Order"/&gt;

Additionally, [[Dish Network]] agreed to lower its maximum [[effective radiated power]] levels on block E, which is on the lower [[adjacent channel]] to the downlink (tower-to-user transmissions) for block A.  It did this in exchange for the FCC allowing it to operate the block as a one-way service, effectively making it a broadcast, although it could still be interactive through other means.  Since Dish has already been experimentally operating it as a [[single-frequency network]], this should not have a significant effect on whatever service it might offer in the future.

{{Jewish feminism}}
'''Women of the Wall''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: נשות הכותל, ''Neshot HaKotel'') is a multi-denominational feminist&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2010|p=644}}: "The Women of the Wall believed themselves to be liberal feminists."&lt;/ref&gt; organization based in [[Israel]] whose goal is to secure the rights of women to pray at the [[Western Wall]], also called the Kotel, in a fashion that includes singing, reading aloud from the [[Torah]] and wearing religious garments (''[[tallit]]'', ''[[tefillin]]'' and ''[[kippah]]''). Pew Research Center has identified Israel as one of the countries that place "high" restrictions on religion,&lt;ref name="prc-2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Restrictions on Religion (Full report)|publisher=The Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life|date=December 2009|url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2009/12/restrictions-fullreport.pdf|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there have been limits placed on non-Orthodox streams of Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;"U.S. Department of State: 2012 Report on International Religious Freedom: Israel and The Occupied Territories (May 20, 2013)"http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2012/nea/208392.htm&lt;/ref&gt; One of those restrictions is that the Rabbi of the Western Wall has enforced gender segregation and limitations on religious garb worn by women.  When the "Women of the Wall" hold monthly prayer services for women on [[Rosh Hodesh]], they observe gender segregation so that Orthodox members may fully participate.  But their use of religious garb, singing and reading from a Torah have upset some members of the Orthodox Jewish community, sparking protests and arrests. In May 2013 a judge ruled that a 2003 Israeli Supreme Court ruling prohibiting women from carrying a Torah or wearing prayer shawls had been misinterpreted and that Women of the Wall prayer gatherings at the wall should not be deemed illegal.&lt;ref name="civildisobedience2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/26/world/middleeast/israeli-law-curbing-womens-prayer-up-for-review.html|title=Israel to Review Curbs on Women's Prayer at Western Wall|last=Rudoren|first=Jodi|date=December 25, 2012|work=The New York Times|accessdate=December 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, the Israeli Cabinet approved a plan to designate a new space at the Kotel that would be available for egalitarian prayer and which would not be controlled by the Rabbinate. Women of the Wall welcomed the decision,&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/01/world/middleeast/israel-western-wall-prayer.html|title=Israel Approves Prayer Space at Western Wall for Non-Orthodox Jews|date=1 February 2016|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the plan faced opposition from other factions, including some ultra-Orthodox members of Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]'s governing coalition, who threatened to withdraw over the government's plan to create non-Orthodox prayer space at the [[Western Wall]] in deference to the Women of the Wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Netanyahu-facing-crisis-as-Haredim-vow-to-quit-over-Western-Wall-pluralism-447102 Netanyahu facing crisis as haredim vow to quit over Western Wall pluralism]. The Jerusalem Post, March 7, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, the Israeli High Court ruled that if the government of Israel could not find "good cause" to prohibit women reading from the Torah in prayer services at the Kotel within 30 days, women could do so; they also ruled that the Israeli government could no longer argue that the Robinson's Arch area of the plaza is access to the Kotel.&lt;ref name="timesofisrael1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shimoni |first=Rebecca |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-sweeping-decision-high-court-rules-for-womens-western-wall-prayer/ |title=In landmark decision, High Court rules for women's Western Wall prayer |publisher=The Times of Israel |date= |accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition for women to read from the Torah at the Kotel had been brought by a group that split off from the Women of the Wall, calling itself the "Original Women of the Wall".&lt;ref name="timesofisrael1"/&gt;

In June 2017, it was announced that the plan approved in January 2016 had been suspended.&lt;ref name="jweekly1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sales |first=Ben |url=http://www.jweekly.com/2017/06/26/suspension-of-western-wall-deal-leaves-jewish-leaders-feeling-betrayed/ |title=Suspension of Western Wall deal leaves Jewish leaders feeling betrayed – J |publisher=Jweekly.com |date=2017-06-26 |accessdate=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2017/06/25/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/netanyahu-rescinds-pluralistic-western-wall-agreement |title=Israel freezes Western Wall compromise that was to create egalitarian prayer section &amp;#124; Jewish Telegraphic Agency |publisher=Jta.org |date=2017-06-25 |accessdate=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ronit Kampf, the group's struggle has been "the most covered women's issue in the history of the Israeli media."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haberman|2012|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
[[File:Western Wall before sunset.jpg|thumb|250px|The Western Wall (August 2012)]]
From the start, Women of the Wall included Orthodox members and opted to run their service according to "Orthodox standards." Nevertheless, some Orthodox individuals were offended, including some who call themselves Orthodox feminists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesler|Haut|2003|p=184}}: "A third reason for choosing Orthodox services was out awareness that if we did not adopt Orthodox standards, Orthodox women would not attend our services or, in all likelihood, support our struggle.

Despite this many Orthodox women, even those who were active in women's ''tefillah'' groups and leaders of Orthodox feminism, remained reticent and ambivalent about our struggle to pray at the Kotel, and Orthodox rabbis, even those who permitted women's ''tefillah'' their synagogues, did not support our right to pray in an identical fashion at the Kotel.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Feldman|2011|p=115}}: "The movement, which is controversial, even among Orthodox feminists, myself included..."&lt;/ref&gt; Women of the Wall is a multi-denominational group, including Reform, Conservative and Orthodox members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/news/1.679974 Amid Violence, Women of the Wall Vote Not to Engage Police This Month] Haaretz, Oct 12, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1988, the group has faced a legal battle for recognition of their right to pray at the Western Wall. Their presence is deemed offensive by Orthodox worshippers at the site and there have been numerous court proceedings to settle the issue. On the [[Fast of Esther]] 1989, ultra-Orthodox men, outraged by the women's singing, hurled chairs and verbal insults at the women, which resulted in the deployment of tear gas to quell the violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rubel|2010|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, police arrested two [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] men at the Western Wall plaza on suspicion that they threw chairs at a Women of the Wall group that was praying aloud at the site.&lt;ref&gt;2010 Human Rights Report: Israel and the occupied territories. U.S. Department of state. This article incorporates public domain material from this source.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, the first woman was arrested for praying with a ''tallit''. The struggle by the Women of the Wall is seen by the Israeli Orthodox religious establishment as an attempt to undermine their influence in an effort to introduce religious pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Price|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition from the Orthodox also stems from Halachic concerns and from a general disdain for non-traditional ritual in an area they claim serves as an Orthodox synagogue. Orthodoxy does not permit women to constitute a ''[[minyan]]'' (prayer quorum) and while the women have not considered themselves as doing so, this has not calmed ultra-Orthodox sensibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharma|Young|1999|p=207}}: "Known as "the Women of the Wall," these women, out of deference to the group's Orthodox members, have used traditional liturgical texts and have not considered themselves to be a ''minyan''. Halakhically, at least as understood by Orthodoxy, women cannot constitute or count as members of a prayer quorum. Nonetheless, they have become the target of great opposition and occasional violence from ultra Orthodox Jews. [...] Women of the Wall continue to face opposition from ultra Orthodox Jews who are against women's prayer groups in general.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baines|Rubio-Marin|2005|p=214}}: "The Women of the Wall organization represents a group of observant Jewish women who pray together in a ''minyan'' -  a religious quorum traditionally reserved for men.

At the same time, acceding to their requests might also mean giving parity to non-Orthodox denominations."&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters highlighted the fact that only in Israel are Jewish women prohibited from praying according to their custom in a public location&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Feldman|2011|p=115}}: "Supporters of the Women of the Wall note the irony that "only in Israel, and at the site most holy to Jews...are Jewish women prohibited from praying aloud in a group with a Torah."&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2003 High Court ruling which prevented them from conducting prayer services at the wall&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Senate (US) Committee on Foreign Relations|2005|p=552}}: "In 2003, the Women of the Wall, a group of more than 100 Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform women, lost their 14-year legal battle to hold formal women's prayer services at the Western Wall. The High Court ruled that the group could not hold prayer services at the Western Wall and instead would be permitted to hold them at nearby Robinson's Arch."&lt;/ref&gt; was overturned in 2013.

==History==
[[File:WOW Torah Reading.jpg|thumb|WOW Torah Reading]]
Twenty-five years after the founding of WoW, a poll by the Israel Democracy Institute in May 2013 found that about half of the Israel public supports the Women of the Wall, and that men (51.5%) are more inclined to support the women's prayer group than women (46%) The poll was conducted by Professor Tamar Hermann, who noted that Women of the Wall received highest levels of support from educated, secular, Ashkenazi Israelis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/poll-half-of-israelis-support-women-of-the-wall.premium-1.523651|title=Poll: Half of Israelis support Women of the Wall|date=13 May 2013|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the group was not always met with support from the majority of Israelis, as it is today.

Women of the Wall was founded in December 1988 at the first International Jewish Feminist Conference in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Skinner Keller|Radford Ruether|Cantlon|2006|p=584}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 1, 1988, during the conference, Rivka Haut organized a group of multi-denominational women to pray at the Western Wall. 70 women carried a Torah scroll to the [[Western Wall]], and Rabbi [[Deborah Brin]] led a prayer service for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nahalatshalom.org/who-we-are/our-rabbi/78-about/163-women-of-the-wall-founding-rabbi-deborah-brin.html|title=Women of the Wall founding Rabbi Deborah Brin - Nahalat Shalom|author=Judy B|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francine Klagsbrun]] was the one chosen to carry the Torah at the head of the group, making her the first woman to carry a Torah to the Western Wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/klagsbrun-francine |title=Francine Klagsbrun &amp;#124; Jewish Women's Archive |publisher=Jwa.org |date=2009-03-01 |accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the conference ended, a group of Jerusalem women led by Bonna Devora Haberman continued to meet at the [[Western Wall|Kotel]] and formed Women of the Wall to assert their right to pray there without hindrance.&lt;ref name="JVL"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/WOW.html |first=Sarah |last=Szymkowicz |title=Women Of The Wall |work=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women of the Wall has fought a legal battle asserting a right to conduct organized prayer at the Kotel and challenging government and private intervention in its efforts. After demanding police protection, the government was given nine months to make arrangements that would allow them to pray unhindered. At the end of this period, the Ministry of Religion ruled that only prayer according to the "custom of the place" was to be permitted and that "the sensitivities of other worshippers" must not be offended.&lt;ref name="Starr Sered 2010 636"&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2010|p=636}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Women of the Wall then petitioned the Supreme Court to recognize their right to pray at the Wall. A temporary ruling was given which stated that the ''status quo'' should be enforced until they reached a final verdict.&lt;ref name="Starr Sered 2010 636"/&gt;

The legal battles between the High Court of Justice and the Women of the Wall continued between 1995 and 2000. The Israeli government did not uphold the position that they would find a way for the Women of the Wall to pray, which resulted in an appeal from the Women of the Wall to the High Court of Justice in 1995. This concluded in April 1996, determining the solution was to move the Women of the Wall's prayer from the Western Wall to the Robinson's Arch. Robinson's Arch was not in the area of main prayer. The Women of the Wall appealed this decision to the Ne'eman Committee in 1998, who reaffirmed the previous decision of the High Court Justice. The Women of the Wall accepted the decision on the condition that the area they were being moved to be set up to be a proper prayer area. The government did not do such preparations of the prayer area in Robinson's Arch, resulting in the appeal to the Supreme Court in 2000 by the Women of the Wall. In this appeal, the supreme court ruled that the Israeli government was required to allow the Women of the Wall to exercise their religious freedom and practices at the Western Wall.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reiter|first=Yitzhak|date=2016-04-02|title=Feminists in the Temple of Orthodoxy: The Struggle of the Women of the Wall to Change the Status Quo|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/613732|journal=Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies|volume=34|issue=2|pages=79–107|doi=10.1353/sho.2016.0001|issn=1534-5165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The struggle has led to two Israeli Supreme Court decisions and a series of debates in the [[Knesset]]. In its first decision, on May 22, 2002, the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]] ruled that it is legal for Women of the Wall to hold prayer groups and read Torah in the women's section of the main Kotel plaza undisturbed. Four days later, [[Haredi]] political parties including [[Shas]] introduced several bills to overturn the decision, including a bill that would have made it a criminal offense for women to pray in non-traditional ways at the Western Wall, punishable by up to seven years in prison.&lt;ref name="JVL"/&gt; In response MK Naomi Chazan said "What have we become? Afghanistan? Iran?"&lt;ref name=LAT2000/&gt; Although the bill did not pass, the Israeli Supreme Court reconsidered its earlier decision. On April 6, 2003, the Court reversed itself and upheld, 5-4, the Israeli government's ban prohibiting the organization from reading Torah or wearing tallit or tefillin at the main public area at the Wall, on the grounds that such continued meetings represented a threat to public safety and order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writ.news.findlaw.com/colb/20030423.html|title="The Israeli Supreme Court Denies Women The Right to Pray at the Western Wall", Findlaw.

This attempt was endorsed by the government to solve the controversy of the wall, but in actuality, this arrangement would have led to the emergence of a new conflict. Instead of ending the quarreling by granting women full rights to worship at the existing wall, the women would have had to fight for recognition among the public at their new area. The area for the women would have been located in what is known as the Robinson's Arch site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reiter|first=Yitzhak|date=Winter 2016|title=Feminists in the Temple of Orthodoxy: The Struggle of the Women of the Wall to Change the Status Quo|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/613732|journal=Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies|volume=34|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, three women MKs used their [[parliamentary immunity]] to don prayer shawls and join the Women of the Wall in a show of support after 10 women had been arrested the previous month. MK [[Stav Shaffir]] ([[Israeli Labor Party|Labour]]) said "I usually do not wear a ''tallit'', but it is my honor and duty to stand here and protect the rights of all Jews from around the world to pray as they desire and believe." [[Tamar Zandberg]] ([[Meretz]]) said: "I demand to enter. The extremist stream's interpretation of the Holy Places Law is unacceptable to me, and I refuse to leave the prayer shawl outside. I am a secular woman but I identify with these women's struggle for freedom of expression and religion." Subsequently, a number of MKs condemned their actions. MK [[Aliza Lavie]] ([[Yesh Atid]]), who herself supports the right of the women to assemble, said she was "shocked" that fellow MKs decided to blatantly disobey the law and ignore Supreme Court rulings. MK [[Miri Regev]] ([[Likud]]) called the MKs attendance a "provocation" and referred to the groups "anarchistic actions" which had "turned into a national sport among the extreme Left in Israel."

In October 2014, Women of the Wall launched a campaign to encourage girls to have their bat mitzvah services at the Kotel. Unlike most diaspora Jewish girls, Israeli Jewish girls typically do not celebrate a bat mitvah by reading from their Torah portion. The ad campaign features girls wearing prayer shawls and holding a Torah scroll in front of the wall. The ad, placed on Israeli buses, has the caption, "Mom, I also want a bat mitzvah at the Kotel!" The Western Wall Heritage Foundation, which is controlled by the Orthodox and oversees events at the wall, not only runs a business of bar mitzvahs for boys that has excluded girls from their offerings, but has refused to permit women to carry Torah scrolls at the wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/.premium-1.620543|title=Women of the Wall bus ad campaign encourages bat mitzvahs at the Kotel|date=13 October 2014|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the campaign ads were soon vandalized in Orthodox neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/207262/women-of-wall-push-for-bat-mitzvahs-at-western-wal/|title=Women of Wall Push for Bat Mitzvahs at Western Wall|date=13 October 2014|work=The Jewish Daily Forward}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ad campaign received international publicity when religious extremists carried out violent attacks in Jerusalem.

On December 18, 2014 Women of the Wall held a women's candle lighting at the Kotel. For [[Hanukkah]] every year a giant [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]] is erected in the men's section of the Western Wall and each night of the eight nights of the festival, male rabbis and male politicians are honored, while women are kept at a distance, where they are barely able to see the ceremony. At the Women of the Wall ceremony, women brought their personal [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]]s. They invited Jews around the world to light a candle for WoW on the third night of Hanukkah.&lt;ref&gt;"'Light One Candle with Women of the Wall' (Dec 11) Women of the Wall" http://womenofthewall.org.il/2014/12/light-one-candle/&lt;/ref&gt; Wow sent a letter to Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] requesting a large menorah also be erected in the women's section just as there is one in the men's section, but Netanyahu simply forwarded the letter to Western Wall rabbi Shmuel Rabinowitz, who accused WoW of ulterior motives of trying to change the customs at the Wall. Responding to Rabinowitz' accusation, Anat Hoffman noted: "In his letter, Rabbi Rabinowitz speaks of bringing together and uniting the nation, and yet his actions exclude and discriminate against women as if women are not part of the same nation. Since he was chosen for this public position, Rabinowitz has never invited Women of the Wall or any other women to participate in the ceremonies or to be honored with the lighting of a candle at the Kotel on Hanukkah, despite the fact that women are obligated equally to men in this religious act."

One hundred Torah scrolls are kept for the use of the men's side of the Western Wall and male supporters of Women of the Wall passed a Torah scroll across the barrier into the women's section for Women of the Wall's service.

Police intervened and stopped them. Following the Torah reading service, WoW members in the women's section danced with the scroll.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/.premium-1.652640 Women defy Western Wall ban and read from full-size Torah] Haaretz, 20 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;"This is the first time that Women of the Wall can stand up and be counted as a part of the public," proclaimed Anat Hoffman, the chair of WoW. "Nothing you could say could tear me away from my Torah." Rabbi Shmuel Rabinovitch, the head of the rabbinic authority of the Western Wall, called the women's Torah reading a provocation and said "the Israel Police and employees of the Western Wall had to work hard in order to avoid bloodshed."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-first-women-of-the-wall-pray-with-full-sized-torah-scroll/ In First, Women of the Wall pray with Full-Size Torah scroll] The Times of Israel, 20 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, the Israeli Cabinet approved a plan to designate a new space at the Kotel that would be available for egalitarian prayer and which would not be controlled by the Rabbinate. Women of the Wall welcomed the decision.&lt;ref name="The New York Times"/&gt; A group calling itself Original Women of the Wall, which includes founding members of WoW and which contends that WOW has broken away from the original and on-going charter of the group. Original Women Of the Wall does not agree with the compromise and said its members will continue to hold prayer services at the Western Wall, praying as is their custom, with prayer shawls and tefillin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Original-Women-of-Wall-reject-compromise-at-site-443215 Original Women of Wall reject compromise at site] The Jerusalem Post, Feb 12, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Palestinian Minister of Waqf and Religious Affairs Youssef Ideiss protested that the proposed egalitarian prayer section at the Western Wall violates the status-quo agreement governing the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/palestinians-cry-foul-over-planned-mixed-gender-western-wall-section/ Palestinians cry foul] The Times of Israel, Feb 1, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016 MK [[Meir Porush]] was reprimanded by the Knesset ethics committee in 2016 because they determined that he "deviated radically and blatantly from the accepted way to express oneself in the Knesset or what is appropriate for an MK." In a speech before the Knesset Porush said that the Women of the Wall should be "thrown to the dogs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/2016/03/29/default/knesset-ethics-panel-reprimands-haredi-lawmaker-who-slammed-women-of-the-wall Knesset ethics panel reprimands haredi lawmaker who slammed Women of the Wall] JTA, March 29, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The committee noted that such "scornful" remarks would be "deplored harshly" had they been spoken about Jews by any other government outside Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/knesset-scolds-mk-for-disparaging-feminist-prayer-group/ Knesset scolds MK for disparaging feminist prayer group] The Times of Israel, March 29, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Porush responded by saying that if "Women of the Wall" refrained from eating non-Kosher food, he would apologize to them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/spokesman/eng/PR_eng.asp?PRID=12030 Ethics Committee reprimands MK Porush for his remarks against "Women of the Wall"] Knesset, March 29, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

|In response to the ruling allowing the Women of the Wall to hold their services at the site, between 5,000-10,000 [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] girls converged to prevent the women from approaching. Police in turn offered protection to around 400 women who formed the largest gathering in the group's history. The women prayed together with a group of male supporters, the first time a mixed service had been held by the organisation. They had planned to bring a Torah scroll into the women's prayer section, but reneged upon the request of Minister of Religious Affairs [[Naftali Bennett]]. Three Haredi men were arrested for disturbing the peace. Chair of Women of the Wall, [[Anat Hoffman]], said "We are continuing in the footsteps of the paratroopers who liberated the Western Wall."&lt;br /&gt;
[[Women for the Wall]] is founded to campaign against the Women of the Wall.

|Threatening graffiti was sprayed on the front door of an executive board member of the Women of the Wall organisation. It read: "Peggy, you're the first. We know where you live. Jerusalem is holy. The Western Wall will not be forfeited. The Women of the Wall are villains." MK [[Michal Rozin]] ([[Meretz]]) blamed the attack on provocative statements by ultra-Orthodox MKs, and Jerusalem mayor [[Nir Barkat]] and his ultra-Orthodox deputy, Yitzhak Pindrus, denounced the act. Rabbi [[Shmuel Rabinovitch]] of the Western Wall called it "a despicable incident," which "did not represent Judaism."

|It was reported that Chief Rabbis [[Yona Metzger]] and [[Shlomo Amar]] had received death threats. The letters stated that if the Women of the Wall are not allowed to pray according to their ways and custom, "we will fight you with all measures, and you will return home with 100 bodies of haredim... We will no longer practice restraint. We will re-liberate the Western Wall." Rabbi Shmuel Rabinovitch had also received a similar letter. Women of the Wall said that the organization "had nothing to do with the act and that the style of these letters does not match the love of Israel spirit led by the group."

| [[United Torah Judaism]] arranged for between 5,000-7,000 Haredi girls to assemble at the wall and for the first time in 25 years, police prevented the Women of the Wall from approaching the site. Male protesters numbered around 1,000. The women, numbering around 300, held their service at the entrance to the Western Wall plaza and were occasionally disturbed by shouting and targeted at least twice by water bombs and eggs. An Orthodox man and women were arrested for public order offenses. [[Gilad Kariv]] of the [[Israel Movement for Reform and Progressive Judaism|Reform Movement in Israel]] said the police had "given a reward to a small group of Haredi provocateurs and rabbis who deal in spreading baseless hatred." Orthodox Jerusalem deputy mayor Yitzhak Pindrus said "baseless hatred caused the greatest destruction to befall our people and we will not let a small group of agitators to continue to polarise with provocations and baseless hatred."

|For the first time, some of the Women of the Wall read from a full-size Torah scroll during the group's monthly prayer service at the Western Wall. Torah scrolls at the Western Wall are  normally stored in the men's section, which women are forbidden from entering. But on April 20 a group of male Jewish sympathizers handed a full-size Torah scroll over to Women of the Wall leaders. Some Haredi Orthodox men who had been praying at the Wall attacked the male sympathizers and tried to take the Torah scroll away from the women, but the attacking men were reportedly removed by the police, and the women were able to complete their prayer service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jenkins |first=Jack |url=http://thinkprogress.org/world/2015/04/21/3649582/jewish-feminists-israel-defy-ban-read-full-size-torah-western-wall/ |title=Jewish Feminists In Israel Defy Ban, Read From A Full-Size Torah At The Western Wall |publisher=ThinkProgress |date=2015-04-21 |accessdate=2015-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/74537/emanu-el-contingent-takes-part-in-historic-women-of-the-wall-torah-service/ |title=Emanu-El contingent takes part in historic Women of the Wall Torah service &amp;#124; j. the Jewish news weekly of Northern California |publisher=Jweekly.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrests and detainment ==

In their struggle for civil rights and religious freedom, members of the group have been willing to engage in civil disobedience and become "prisoners of conscience.".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesler|Haut|2003|pp=56–57}}: "But we might also have to go outside both the legal and political system. Would women be willing to do civil disobedience, get arrested? A[nat]: Absolutely! We are hoping that Shas actually passes the bill that would put us in jail for seven years. P[hyllis]: You would sit in jail for seven years? A: We have quite a few women who are willing to become prisoners of conscience. P: Prisoners of conscience . . . A: If the police weren't ready to arrest us for six months, do you think they'd arrest us for seven years? If they did, it would be very good for us, both legally and in terms of media support. Imagine what Amnesty International will do with this!"&lt;/ref&gt;

Several members of the group have been arrested for acts that Women of the Wall members say are legal under the Supreme Court ruling. Nofrat Frenkel was arrested for wearing a tallit under her coat and holding a Torah in November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3807090,00.html|title=Police Arrest Woman Praying at the Western Wall|work=ynet}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was not charged, but she was barred from visiting the Wall for two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/119509/,|title=The 'Crime' of Praying with a Tallit, and a Plea for Tolerance: First Person|date=24 November 2009|work=The Jewish Daily Forward}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group's leader, [[Anat Hoffman]], was interrogated by the police in January 2010, fingerprinted, and told that she could be charged with a felony over her involvement with Women of the Wall. The questioning concerned WOW's December service, during which Hoffman said she did not do anything out of the ordinary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/122754/|title=Women of the Wall Leader Interrogated by Police|date=6 January 2010|work=The Jewish Daily Forward}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 12, 2010, Hoffman was arrested for holding a [[Torah scroll]]. She was fined 5,000 [[New Israeli Shekel|NIS]] and given a restraining order according to which she was not allowed to approach the Kotel for thirty days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/police-arrest-women-of-the-wall-leader-for-praying-with-torah-scroll-1.301457|title=Police arrest Women of the Wall leader for praying with Torah scroll|date=12 July 2010|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This time they checked me naked, completely, without my underwear. They dragged me on the floor 15 meters; my arms are bruised. They put me in a cell without a bed, with three other prisoners, including a prostitute and a car thief.  They threw the food through a little window in the door. I laid on the floor covered with my [[tallit]].  I'm a tough cookie, but I was just so miserable. And for what? I was with the [[Hadassah]] women saying Sh'ma Yisrael."&lt;ref&gt;Sharon, Jeremy.

On February 11, 2013, ten women who were part of WOW, including two American rabbis, were detained for praying at the wall and "as a result of them wearing the garments that they're not allowed to wear specifically at that site."&lt;ref name=nytfeb&gt;{{cite news|last=Rudoren|first=Jodi|title=Women Praying at Western Wall in Jerusalem Are Detained|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/world/middleeast/Women-Praying-at-Western-Wall-Detained.html|accessdate=11 February 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The women were barred from returning for 15 days.

On April 11, 2013, five women were detained for allegedly goading and offending other worshippers.

==Women of the Wall's position==
The Women of the Wall have consistently claimed that there is no single "custom of the place" and that their right to pray is a religious freedom enshrined in Israeli law. They believe the Western Wall is a religious site as well as a national site and therefore belongs to the entire Jewish population. Their efforts to challenge the current customs at the Wall and break the ritual status quo continues as they believe that the Wall is a holy place for all Jews. They repeatedly stress that the group is not Reform Jews, but come from all affiliations and that their conduct strictly adheres to Orthodox Jewish Law and that their prayer is genuine and not a political stunt. Their central mission is to "achieve the social and legal recognition of our right, as women, to wear prayer shawls, pray and read from the Torah collectively and out loud at the Western Wall."  The women have made progress and as of 1988, the women have held occasional, uninterrupted prayer services wearing tallitot and tefillin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reiter|first=Yitzhak|date=Winter 2016|title=Feminists in the Temple of Orthodoxy: The Struggle of the Women of the Wall to Change the Status Quo|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/613732|journal=Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies|volume=34|pages=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Israeli Orthodox establishment's position==
The Israeli Orthodox Jewish religious establishment is opposed to the services conducted by the Women of the Wall. Orthodox rabbis claim that even if such a manner of prayer is theoretically permitted by Jewish Law, it is against Jewish custom. Even if support can be found in Jewish legal sources for various activities, the force of custom is equal to absolute law and it is the custom which determines proper conduct. Various legal opinions recorded in Halacha cannot be manipulated to introduce new forms of prayer.&lt;ref name="Starr Sered 2010 638–9"&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2010|pp=638–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opinion of Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]], which is cited by Women of the Wall in support of their cause, is rejected by the establishment, as they view the Women of the Wall as being motivated by feminism rather than a sincere spiritual desire.&lt;ref&gt;Frimer, Arye and Dov, [http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/english/tfila/frimmer1.htm Women's Prayer Services Theory and Practice] ''Tradition'', 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Their struggle is also seen as an attempt to undermine their influence and as a strategy for non-Orthodox groups to gradually gain official recognition at state level, paving the way for the introduction of religious pluralism in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Price|2012|p=}}: "The Israeli Orthodox establishment view the Women of the Wall as being a Trojan horse to introduce Jewish pluralism and establish the Reform, Conservative, and Reconstructionist strains of Judaism in Israel."&lt;/ref&gt;  In a letter to the group, [[Yehuda Getz]], the government appointed rabbi of the Western Wall, urged them to stop "straying from the hallowed traditions of generations of Jews before you"&lt;ref name="Starr Sered 2010 638–9"/&gt; and in 1989, the Israeli Chief Rabbi [[Avraham Shapiro]] and the Religious Affairs Minister suggested that the women "pray individually, silently, and preferably at home-not at the wall."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2010|p=642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public response==
From the outset, the Women of the Wall have been subjected to heckling and abuse from male and female Orthodox worshipers. More recently, the extremists who oppose the Women of the Wall have been criticized by Israel's predominantly secular society, which objects not only to the religious extremists' harassment of Women of the Wall but attempts to ban mixing of genders in public places such buses and sidewalks.&lt;ref name="Washington Post"/&gt;

In 1996, UTJ MK [[Israel Eichler]] wrote: "No one prevents anyone else from praying at the wall in his own fashion, but the wall is the last place to carry out a battle for the right of a woman to wear a ''tallit'', read from the Torah, wear a ''kippa'' and grow a beard."&lt;ref name="Starr Sered 2000 138–9"&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2000|pp=138–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; MK [[Yaakov Litzman]] stated that "there is no desecration greater than that of women who come to desecrate the holiness of the Western Wall with all kinds of provocations such as carrying a Torah scroll and other things reserved by Jewish law only to men"&lt;ref name= LAT2000&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jun/05/news/mn-37770 Israeli Women Defy Custom, Say a Prayer for Equality], June 5, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Ovadia Yosef said: "There are stupid women who come to the Western Wall, put on a tallit (prayer shawl), and pray... These are deviants who serve equality, not Heaven. They must be condemned and warned of."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3801872,00.html|title=Rabbi Yosef condemns Women of the Wall|work=ynet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi [[Yosef Reinman]] suggested that it is "not religious need," but rather "religious politics" which motivates the woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hirsch|Reinman|2002|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent Orthodox women have also disapproved of the group. [[Nehama Leibowitz]] likened their worship to a form of "sport,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Unterman|2009|p=296}}: "Nehama rejected the argument that women's spiritual needs must be met more fully than convention currently allows. Shira Leibowitz Schmidt recalls that Nehama "unsympathetically labeled as "sport" the untraditional, demonstrative prayer by Women of the Wall..."&lt;/ref&gt; and the widow of  Sephardi Chief Rabbi [[Mordechai Eliyahu]] said the group had "gone completely mad" and their actions amount to "desecration."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/168688 Rabbanit Tzviya Eliyahu: Women of the Wall are 'Crazy'], ''Arutz Sheva'', (June 06, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Ultra-Orthodox former Jerusalem city councilwoman Mina Fenton said the women are "a fringe group that attracts people who read the prayer book upside down."&lt;ref name=USA10-05/&gt; The Religious Zionist leadership also voiced its concern in May 2013 when a group of influential rabbis issued a letter calling on public figures "not to let a small group offend the thousands of worshippers arriving to pray at this sacred place on a regular basis." They went on to state that "there are those who have been trying in recent years to change the present situation, offending many and tainting the special atmosphere of holiness of this sacred place."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4378184,00.html Zionist rabbis vs. Women of Wall], Kobi Nachshoni, ''ynet.com'' 9 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disapproval included a wide range of name-calling, with Women of the Wall being called "witches," "prostitutes," "weird," "childish," and "provocateurs," for wanting to pray in their fashion. The Israeli state and Ministry of Religion referred to Women of the Wall as "witches," who were doing "Satan's work"; "more like prostitutes than women"; "misled, tainted, by modern secular feminism."&lt;ref name="Chesler 1996"&gt;{{harvnb|Chesler|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet indifference and condemnation for the women's plight came from all sectors of Israeli society, not just from the religious right. Even liberals saw their actions as a "provocation,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raday|2009|p=231}}: "However, even academics, intellectuals, and journalists generally committed to a liberal point of view were overtly hostile to the WOW. In newspaper articles and public discussion, they claimed that their actions were a "provocation."&lt;/ref&gt; and women's organisations in Israel viewed their behaviour as "weird and objectionable."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Naveh|2003|p=130}}: "The WoW group has also failed to rally support from Israeli women's organizations: their struggle was and is still considered weird and objectionable."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hillel Halkin]] called them "childish provocateurs"&lt;ref&gt;Halkin, Hillel. (June 24, 2013). [http://forward.com/articles/179034/womens-prayer-protests-at-western-wall-are-just-ch/ Women's Prayer Protests at Western Wall Are Just Childish Provocation], ''Forward''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Itamar Ben Canaan|Ithamar Handelman-Smith]] wondered what the Women of the Wall wanted to achieve.&lt;ref&gt;Handelman-Smith, Ithamar. [http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/women-of-the-wall-what-do-you-want.premium-1.524057 Women of the Wall, what do you want?], ''Haaretz'', (May 14, 2013).: "I really don't get this Women of the Wall thing. Is it a tasteless joke, meaningless silliness or an effort to cause aggravation and anger? What's the point of Women of the Wall's praying? What do they hope to achieve beyond provocation, media exposure, ratings and the intoxication of power..."&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli society in general and the secular media were also initially unsympathetic to their cause,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|1999|p=217}}: "The secular newspapers have been antagonistic to the Women of the Wall, thus depriving them of a major social resource."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2001|p=203}}: "Still, secular newspaper reports, editors, and other public figures have also had their say. Interestingly, their stance has not been overly sympathetic to the Women of the Wall,..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robinson|Klotz|1989}}: "The Israeli secular public cannot see why this issue is important to us."&lt;/ref&gt; possibly reflecting a general hostility to feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Halperin-Kaddari|2004|p=170}}: "Significantly, there has been little sympathy or understanding in the media for the women's cause, perhaps expressing Israeli society's general hostility to feminist causes."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lahav|2000}}: "I fear that the general indifference at best, and hostility at worst, of the Jewish secular majority towards the Women of the Wall stems from the hostility to feminism in general. It has long been observed that feminism has not been kindly accepted in Israel."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Starr Sered|Susan Sered]] suggests the public saw the group as "symbolically desecrating Judaism's holiest site"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|1999|p=211}}: "The Women of the Wall are themselves seen as a symbol, symbolically desecrating Judaism's holiest site."&lt;/ref&gt; and claims that many in Israel saw the group as "American Reform interlopers trying to appropriate a state symbol of national identity."&lt;ref name="Starr Sered 2000 138–9"/&gt; Their demands were seen as radical and foreign to Israeli society&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Swirski|Safir|1991|p=16}}: "In the context of Israeli society, the demands of Women of the Wall represent unprecedented, radical demands. Jews in Israel, including the secular majority, generally accept the domination of Orthodoxy in religious matters, perhaps because they do not perceive it as meaningful to their daily lives."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lahav|2006|p=133}}: "In Israel of the early 1990s, which experienced the surge of religion and the rise of religious political power, WOW's action was perceived as radical and unacceptable."&lt;/ref&gt; and their actions "alienated Israelis of almost all political persuasions."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2001|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, the women at first received minimal [[grass-roots]] support.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|1999|p=157}}: "There has not been as much grass-roots support in Israel for the Women of the Wall."&lt;/ref&gt;  Lahav explains that secular indifference results from an acceptance of the view espoused by the Orthodox establishment when it comes to religious issues&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lahav|2000}}: "A deeper reason has to do with the historical attitude of secular Zionism towards religion. From the perspective of the secular majority, Jewish religion is what the orthodox say it is. They fail to see in the women's fight a struggle to open up orthodoxy and make it more egalitarian; if they do, they do not consider it to be of any significance because they do not have an interest in religion anyway."&lt;/ref&gt; and that those on the [[Left-wing politics|Left]] of the political spectrum ignore the women in an attempt to gain Orthodox support for their dovish positions on the Arab-Israeli conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lahav|2000}}: "Politically, the secular majority is interested in the orthodox sector only in as much as it can support their views concerning the peace process. The Left is impatient with the Women of the Wall because they pose yet another obstacle on the road to some Orthodox support of the dovish resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The Right supports the orthodox (against the women) because it wishes to strengthen its bond with the religious sector, thereby guaranteeing more support for it hawkish opposition to the formula of land for peace."&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular support for the women initially came mainly from Reform and Liberal communities in North America. In 1990, the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]] encouraged its members to support Women of the Wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stevens|1990|p=160}}: "Therefore be, it resolved that the CCAR encourage its members and their constituencies to support the Women of the Wall by writing to the Ministers of Religion and Justice, the Prime Minister, the Chief rabbis, public figures, and President of Israel about... b) Women having the option of joining prayer groups at the Wall."&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the [[Union for Reform Judaism]] declared it "warmly commends the Women of the Wall for its courageous and principled struggle to be allowed to pray at the Western Wall" and urged Reform congregations to "express solidarity with the Women of the Wall in appropriate ways."&lt;ref&gt;[http://urj.org//about/union/governance/reso//?syspage=article&amp;item_id=1945 In Support of Women of the Wall], URJ, (June 4, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, a number of non-Orthodox gatherings and services have been held publicly in America in solidarity with the Women of the Wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/132071/nyc-prayer-service-supports-women-of-the-wall NYC Prayer Service Supports Women of the Wall], ''Tablet, (May 10, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the Reform movement, WOW has faced both support and criticism. Rabbi [[Gilad Kariv]], who is considered the leader of the Reform movement in Israel, argued that WOW's request of 11 hours a year{{clarify|date=December 2017}} did not indicate an urgency that required a change in policy, but he came to support WOW's goals because they align with the Reform movement's opposition to the exclusion of women from religious society in Israel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

By 2013, however, about half of Israeli Jews approved of Women of the Wall and their mission, with the greatest support coming from educated Ashkenazi Jews. Pollsters for the Israeli Democracy Institute (IDI) and Tel Aviv University surveyed Jews in Israel and found that a clear majority, 64%, of those who defined themselves as secular, and 53% of those who described themselves as traditional but not religious supported the right of Women of the Wall to worship in their fashion. A minority of those who described themselves as traditional religious or Ultra-Orthodox approved. The results showed that overall,  51.8% of men and 46% of women supported Women of the Wall and their right to pray in their fashion at the Wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/almost-half-of-israeli-jews-back-women-of-the-wall/ Almost half of Israeli Jews back Women of the Wall] Times of Israel, May 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly opinions==
Some Jewish feminist activists in Israel have seen the Women of the Wall's activities as being inconsistent with their political activities. Leah Shakdiel of the anti-war group [[Women in Black]] describes the Wall as "all maleness and war."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raday|2007|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shakdiel maintains that Israeli society's general opposition to the Women of the Wall is a result of a religious and secular alliance against what they perceive as a feminist challenge. Ran Hirschl believes the conflict is "a contest for cultural hegemony between a secularist-libertarian elite and traditionally peripheral group," namely the ultra-Orthodox community. [[Frances Raday]] posits that the violent opposition by Orthodox Jews stems from the "desire of the Orthodox establishment to preserve religious patriarchal hegemony against the challenge of religious feminism," rather than an attempt to preserve Jewish Law itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raday|2007|p=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phyllis Chesler]] of Women of the Wall wrote: "We asked for our rights under civil and religious law. When we prayed, other worshipers, both men and women, verbally and physically assaulted us. We asked the Israeli state to protect us so that we could exercise our rights. The state claimed it could not contain the violence against us, and that we ourselves had provoked the violence by "disturbing/offending" the "sensibilities of Jews at worship." Women are not seen as "Jews" or as "worshipers" with "sensibilities."&lt;ref name="Chesler 1996"/&gt;
