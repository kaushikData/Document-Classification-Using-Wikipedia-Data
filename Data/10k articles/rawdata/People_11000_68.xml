'''Sir Angus James Bruce Ogilvy''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100|KCVO}} (14 September 1928 – 26 December 2004) was a British businessman, best known as the husband of [[Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy|Princess Alexandra]], a first cousin of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]].

Ogilvy is also remembered for his role in a scandal involving the breaking of [[International sanctions|sanctions]] against the regime in [[Rhodesia]] in the 1970s in the [[Lonrho affair]]. In later years, he was heavily involved in charity work.

==Early life==
The Hon. Angus Ogilvy was born in [[London]], the second son of the [[David Ogilvy, 12th Earl of Airlie|12th Earl of Airlie]] and Lady Alexandra Coke, the daughter of the [[Thomas Coke, 3rd Earl of Leicester|3rd Earl of Leicester]].&lt;ref name=early&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Angus Ogilvy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/dec/27/guardianobituaries.monarchy|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his relatives had close links with the [[British Royal Family]].&lt;ref name=early/&gt; His grandmother, [[Mabell Ogilvy, Countess of Airlie]], was a close friend and [[Lady-in-Waiting]] to [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]].&lt;ref name=early/&gt; His father was a [[Lord-in-waiting]] to [[George V|King George V]] and [[Lord Chamberlain]] to [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]] (later the Queen Mother).&lt;ref name=early/&gt;
He was a second cousin of [[Diana Mosley]], second cousin of [[Lavinia Fitzalan-Howard, Duchess of Norfolk]], and a second cousin once removed of [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 5th Marquess of Salisbury]]. He was also third cousin, once removed of [[Pamela Harriman]].

==Education and career==
Ogilvy was educated at [[Heatherdown School]], near [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]] in [[Berkshire]]; and later at [[Eton College]] (also in Berkshire). Between 1946 and 1948, while on [[National service]], he was commissioned as an officer in the [[Scots Guards]]. In 1947 he attended [[Trinity College, Oxford]], graduating in 1950 with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in [[Philosophy, Politics, and Economics]].

After university, Ogilvy worked at the Drayton company, later working with the tycoon [[Tiny Rowland]] in Drayton's subsidiary, London and Rhodesia Mining and Land Company ([[Lonrho]]). The [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Edward Heath]], criticised the company and described it in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] as "an unpleasant and unacceptable face of capitalism" on a 1973 court case over the company's management style. His career ended in 1976 after he was criticised in a Department of Trade report into the company's activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Marriage==

On 24 April 1963, Ogilvy married [[Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy|Princess Alexandra of Kent]], a granddaughter of [[George V|King George V]] and a cousin of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], at [[Westminster Abbey]] in [[London]].&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |first= Wolfgang|last= Saxon|authorlink= |title=Angus Ogilvy, 76, Banker With Ties to British Royalty, Dies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/28/international/europe/28ogilvy.html|quote=He and Princess Alexandra had a son, James Robert Bruce Ogilvy, and a daughter, Marina Victoria Alexandra.

The Queen had offered Ogilvy an [[earl]]dom on his wedding, which he declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Kenneth J.|last=Panton|title=Historical Dictionary of the British Monarchy|publisher=Scarecrow Press, Inc|year=2011 |isbn=0-8108-5779-0 |url=|ref=harv|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also rejected a grace-and-favour apartment at one of the Royal Palaces. Instead, he leased [[Thatched House Lodge]] in [[Richmond, London]] from the Crown Estate for him and Princess Alexandra to live in, and where she still lives today. However, Princess Alexandra retained an apartment at [[St James's Palace]], which is customary for the royal family.

Together, the couple had two children: 
* [[James Ogilvy|James Robert Bruce Ogilvy]]  (born 29 February 1964 in [[Thatched House Lodge]], [[Richmond Park]], Surrey), married Julia Caroline Rawlinson on 30 July 1988 at St Mary the Virgin Church in [[Saffron Walden]], [[Essex]]. They have two children:&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|title=Royal baby for leap year day |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/29/newsid_2758000/2758983.stm|quote=The Ogilvy baby was one of several royal babies due within months of each other.

* Marina Victoria Alexandra Ogilvy (born 31 July 1966 in [[Thatched House Lodge]], [[Richmond Park]], Surrey), married on 2 February 1990 at Richmond Park, Surrey, and divorced on 15 October 1997 Paul Julian Mowatt ([[Hendon]], 28 November 1962), a photographer. Marina's first pregnancy, which was announced in late 1989, caused a controversy as the couple were not married. This resulted in a feud with her parents who suggested she either married her companion or aborted the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/17/world/one-more-scandal-for-british-royalty.html|title=One More Scandal For British Royalty|publisher=The New York Times|date=17 October 1989|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-10-09/news/mn-238_1_royal-family|title=Unwed Pregnant Royal Cousin Petitions Queen|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=9 October 1989|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They eventually had two children:
** Zenouska May Mowatt (born 26 May 1990 in London)
** Christian Alexander Mowatt (born 4 June 1993 in London)

==Later years==
Ogilvy was created a [[Royal Victorian Order|Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order]] on 31 December 1988&lt;ref name="kcvo"&gt;[http://www.stgeorges-windsor.org/history/hist_chivalry.asp St George's Chapel - Orders of Chivalry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820080536/http://www.stgeorges-windsor.org/history/hist_chivalry.asp |date=20 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by Queen Elizabeth II. In the [[1997 New Year Honours]], he was made a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Counsellor]].

After his business career was blighted, Ogilvy was involved with charity work.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; He served as president of the [[Imperial Cancer Research Fund]], and as chairman of Youth Clubs UK, the biggest non-uniformed youth organisation in Britain. He was patron of Arthritis Care; vice-patron of the National Children's Homes; chairman of the advisory council of [[The Prince's Trust]]; a trustee of the Leeds Castle Foundation, as well as being a member of the governing council of [[Business in the Community]], and of the [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]]. He was also a member of the [[Royal Company of Archers]], the Sovereign's Bodyguard in Scotland, in which his father served as one of its four lieutenants.

He suffered from throat cancer in later years and his last public appearance with his wife was when he accompanied her to [[Thailand]] for an official tour.

Ogilvy died in [[Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames|Kingston upon Thames]], London, on 26 December 2004. His funeral took place at [[St. George's Chapel, Windsor]] in [[Windsor Castle]] on 5 January 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Death of the Rt Hon Sir Angus Ogilvy|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/LatestNewsandDiary/Pressreleases/2004/DeathoftheRtHonSirAngusOgilvy.aspx|publisher=British Monarchy|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried at the [[Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore]] at Windsor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Angus Ogilvy is buried at Windsor|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1480518/Sir-Angus-Ogilvy-is-buried-at-Windsor.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Ogilvy and his wife attended a special service at [[St Anne's Church, Kew]], on Sunday 10 May 1964, to mark the church's 250th anniversary. Two pew cushions in the church are embroidered with their names and coats of arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blomfield|first=David|title=St Anne's Kew: 1714-2014|date=2014|publisher=RJL Smith and Associates|pages=68, 72|ISBN=978-0-9573492-8-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Celia Elizabeth Green''' (born 26 November 1935) is a British writer on [[philosophical skepticism]] and [[psychology]].

== Biography ==

Green's parents were both primary school teachers, who together authored a series of geography textbooks which became known as The Green Geographies.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Times, 8 September 1989, Obituary: ''Mr William Green, Headmaster and author.''&lt;/ref&gt;

She was educated first at the [[Ursuline Academy Ilford|Ursuline Convent in Ilford]], and later at the Woodford High School for Girls, a [[state school]]. In a book, ''Letters from Exile'',&lt;ref&gt;Green, C., ''Letters from Exile, Observations on a Culture in Decline''. Oxford: Oxford Forum, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; she compared these two schools and made conclusions that preferred parentally financed to state education. She won the Senior Open Scholarship to [[Somerville College, Oxford]] aged 17.

In 1960 she was awarded a [[Degrees_of_the_University_of_Oxford#Bachelors.27_degrees|B.Litt.]] degree from [[Oxford University]]'s faculty of Literae Humaniores (Philosophy), for a thesis, supervised by [[H. H. Price]], entitled ''An Enquiry into Some States of Consciousness and their Physiological Foundation''.&lt;ref&gt;Green, C., ''An Enquiry into Some States of Consciousness and their Physiological Foundation'', B. Litt thesis, University of Oxford, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1957 to 1960, Green held the post of Research Officer at the [[Society for Psychical Research]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;[[Renée Haynes]], ''The Society for Psychical Research 1882-1982'', London: McDonald, 1982, p.52.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, Green founded and became the Director of the Institute of Psychophysical Research. The Institute's areas of interest were initially listed as philosophy, psychology, theoretical physics, and ESP.&lt;ref&gt;The Psychophysical Research Unit, Oxford: undated pamphlet of 3 pages, in circulation ca 1962-1965 &lt;/ref&gt; However, its principal work during the sixties and seventies concerned hallucinations and other quasi-perceptual experiences in normal subjects. Its main benefactor, from 1963 to 1970, was [[Cecil Harmsworth King]], then Chairman of the IPC group, which owned the ''[[Daily Mirror]]''.

In 1996 Green was awarded a DPhil degree by the Oxford faculty of Literae Humaniores for a thesis on causation and the [[mind-body problem]].&lt;ref&gt;Green, C., ''Causation and the Mind-Body Problem'', D. Phil thesis, University of Oxford, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  Green is an Honorary Research Fellow at the Department of Philosophy, [[University of Liverpool]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cis1.liv.ac.uk/pls/portal/tulwwwmerge.mergepage?p_template=phil_staff&amp;p_tulipproc=dir&amp;p_params=%3Fp_dept%3DPL%26p_template%3Dphil_staff ''Staff page''] of the Department of Philosophy, Liverpool University.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== General ===
Green's basic philosophical position may be described as one of radical scepticism, based on a perception of what she calls 'the total uncertainty'.&lt;ref&gt;Green, C., ''The Human Evasion''. London: Hamish Hamilton, 1969, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; This perception leads her to agnostic positions, not just on traditional philosophical issues such as the nature of physical causation,&lt;ref&gt;Green, C., ''The Lost Cause, Causation and the Mind-Body Problem''. Oxford: Oxford Forum, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; but also on current social arrangements, such as state education and the monopolistic power of the medical profession, of both of which she is a relentless critic.&lt;ref&gt;Green, C., ''Letters from Exile, Observations on a Culture in Decline''. Oxford: Oxford Forum, 2004,'' ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; Green writes in ''Letters from Exile'' and elsewhere of the damage which she believes can be done to exceptional children by holding back, rather than pushing, a topic which she regards as subject to extreme misrepresentation among current educational theorists.

There are also strong hereditarian and anti-feminist elements in her thinking. The former element may have been part of the reason she received support from the psychologist, the late Professor [[Hans Eysenck]], who for a number of years was Director of the Institute of Psychophysical Research which Green founded.

Reinforcing the impression of someone out of sympathy with the modern Zeitgeist is Green's interest in the concepts of royalty and aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Cf.Green, C., ''Advice to Clever Children''. Oxford: Institute of Psychophysical Research, 1981, Ch.29.&lt;/ref&gt;  This interest appears to relate, not to their political significance, but to their symbolic power as representing certain ideals of responsibility and self-reliance. In several of her books Green develops a concept of ‘centralisation’, which is far removed from the ‘Californian’ concept of ‘centredness’, and has more to do with a heroic reaction to the perception that the human condition is intolerable, and that single-mindedness and urgency are the only appropriate responses.

To the extent that a conventional political position can be inferred from Green’s writings it would appear to be one of extreme [[libertarianism]], and in fact a pamphlet of Green's on education was published in the 1990s by the [[Libertarian Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;Green, C.,'Freedom and the exceptional child', ''Educational Notes'', No. 26, Libertarian Alliance, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Green's most widely read philosophical book is probably ''The Human Evasion'', which has been translated into Dutch,&lt;ref&gt;Green, C., ''Vlucht en de Medemens''. Meppel: Boom. 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; German,&lt;ref&gt;Green, C., ''Die Flucht ins Humane''. Stuttgart: Ernst Klett Verlag. 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Italian,&lt;ref&gt;Green, C., ''L'Evasione dell' Umanita''. Roma: Ubaldini Editore. 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; and Russian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nadprof.ru/library/books/the_human_evasion.shtml ''The Human Evasion''] in Russian.&lt;/ref&gt; Its tone is somewhat different from Green's other books, being a curious combination of the oracular and the humorous. It consists almost entirely of a destructive analysis of twentieth century thinkers, from [[Wittgenstein]] to [[Paul Tillich|Tillich]], but at the same time it seems to have a positive sub-text of its own, which is never made explicit.

=== Ethics ===
On questions of ethics, Green proposes a distinction between tribal and territorial morality.&lt;ref&gt;Green, C., ''Letters from Exile, Observations on a Culture in Decline''. Oxford: Oxford Forum, 2004, pp. 3–51.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is largely negative and proscriptive: it defines a person’s territory, which is not to be invaded, stolen or damaged, such as his or her property, dependants and family. Outside this defined area territorial morality is permissive, leaving the individual free to have whatever wealth, opinions or behavioural habits that do not harm others.

Tribal morality, by contrast, Green characterises as prescriptive, imposing the norms of a group on the individual. Whereas territorial morality attempts to set up rigid, universal, abstract principles (such as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s [[categorical imperative]]), tribal morality is contingent, culturally determined, and 'flexible'.

Green links the rise of territorial morality to the development of the concept of private property, and eventually of market capitalism, including the primacy of contract over status. Her evident preference for territorial morality can be related to the centrality of the existential uncertainty in her thinking: under territorial morality it is prohibited to do good to someone against their will because it is impossible for another individual to know with certainty what is in that individual’s best interests.

=== Empirical research ===
Green’s empirical work, some of it undertaken in collaboration with an Oxford psychologist, [[Charles McCreery]], has focussed mainly on hallucinatory experiences in ostensibly normal people.

In 1968 Green published ''Lucid Dreams'',&lt;ref&gt;Green, C., ''Lucid Dreams'', London: Hamish Hamilton, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; a study of dreams in which the subject is aware that he or she is asleep and dreaming. The possibility of conscious insight during dreams had previously been treated with scepticism by some philosophers&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Malcolm, N., ''Dreaming''. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1959, pp.48–50.&lt;/ref&gt; and psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Hartmann, E., ‘Dreams and other hallucinations: an approach to the underlying mechanism,’ in Siegal, R.K. and West, L.J., eds., ''Hallucinations''. New York: Wiley, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Green collated both previously published first-hand accounts and the results of longitudinal studies of four subjects of her own. She predicted that [[lucid dream]]s would be found to be correlated with the [[rapid eye movement sleep|rapid eye movement (REM) stage of sleep]], a prediction which was subsequently confirmed by experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Laberge, S., Nagel, L., Taylor, W., Dement, W.C. &amp; Narcone, V. (1981): 'Psychophysiological correlates of the initiation of lucid dreaming.' ''Sleep Research'', 10, 149.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ogilvie, R., Hunt, H., Kushniruk, A. &amp; Newman, J. (1983): 'Lucid dreams and the arousal continuum.' ''Sleep Research'', 12, 182.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fenwick, P., Schatzmann, M., Worsley, A., Adams, J., Stone, S., &amp; Backer, A., (1984): 'Lucid dreaming: correspondence between dreamed and actual events in one subject during REM sleep.' ''Biological Psychology'', 18, 243–252.&lt;/ref&gt;

Green also speculated that it might be possible to set up a rudimentary two-way signalling system between the lucid dreamer and a waking observer, a possibility which was subsequently realised, independently of each other, by researchers in two different laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;Hearne, K.M.T. (1978). ''Lucid dreams: an electrophysiological and psychological study''. PhD thesis, University of Liverpool.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laberge, S., Nagel, Dement, W.C. &amp; Narcone, V. (1981): 'Lucid dreaming verified by volitional communication during REM sleep'. ''Perceptual and Motor Skills'', 52, 727–732.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968 Green published an analysis of 400 first-hand accounts of [[out-of-body experiences]].&lt;ref&gt;Green, C., ''Out-of-the-body Experiences'', London: Hamish Hamilton, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975 Green and McCreery published a similar taxonomy of 'apparitions', or hallucinations in which the viewpoint of the subject was not ostensibly displaced, based on a collection of 1500 first-hand accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Green, C., and McCreery, C., ''Apparitions'', London: Hamish Hamilton, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

Green has put forward the idea that lucid dreams, out-of-body experiences and [[apparitional experiences]] have something in common, namely that in all three types of case the subject's field of perception is entirely replaced by a hallucinatory one. In the first two types of case she considers this self-evident from the nature of the experience, but in the case of apparitional experiences in the waking state the idea is far from obvious. The hypothesis, and the evidence and arguments for it, were first put forward in her book ''Apparitions'', and later developed in her book ''Lucid Dreaming, the Paradox of Consciousness during Sleep'',&lt;ref&gt;Green, C., and McCreery, C., ''Lucid Dreaming, the Paradox of Consciousness during Sleep'', London: Routledge, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; both of which she co-authored with McCreery.

This preoccupation with the extent of the hallucinatory element in various anomalous perceptual experiences is an indication that for Green the main interest of all these experiences is in the light they shed on normal perception, and on our theories of such perception, both philosophical and psychological. Prior to Green’s work these various hallucinatory phenomena had been of interest only to parapsychologists, who had studied them with a view to seeing, either whether they provided evidence for [[extra-sensory perception]], or whether they shed light on the question of whether human beings could be said to survive death.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Gurney, E., Myers, F.W.H. and Podmore, F.. ''Phantasms of the Living'', Vols. I and II. London: Trubner and Co.,1886.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aphorisms ===
One of Green’s most distinctive contributions is to the form of the [[aphorism]] or [[epigram]], the majority of her aphorisms being grouped together in two of her books, ''The Decline and Fall of Science'' &lt;ref&gt;Cf. Green, C., ''The Decline and Fall of Science''. London: Hamish Hamilton, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Advice to Clever Children'' &lt;ref&gt;Cf. Green, C., ''Advice to Clever Children''. Oxford: Institute of Psychophysical Research, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;. Ten are included in the ''Penguin Dictionary of Epigrams''&lt;ref&gt;M.J. Cohen, ed., ''The Penguin Dictionary of Epigrams'', London: Penguin Books, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;, a relatively high number for a living author, and three in the ''Penguin Dictionary of Modern Quotations''&lt;ref&gt;J.M. and M.J. Cohen, eds., ''The Penguin Dictionary of Modern Quotations'', London: Penguin Books, 2nd edition 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;. The aphorism, with its tendency to paradox and extreme compression, seems to be particularly suited to Green’s confrontational mode of thought. For example:&lt;blockquote&gt; ‘In an autocracy, one person has his way; in an aristocracy, a few people have their way; in a democracy, no one has his way.’&lt;ref&gt;J.M. and M.J. Cohen, ''The Penguin Dictionary of Modern Quotations''. London: Penguin Books, 2nd edition 1980, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; ‘People have been marrying and bringing up children for centuries now. Nothing has ever come of it.’&lt;ref&gt;M.J. Cohen, ''The Penguin Dictionary of Epigrams''. London: Penguin Books, 2001, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; ‘The way to do research is to attack the facts at the point of greatest astonishment.’ &lt;ref&gt;M.J. Cohen, ''The Penguin Dictionary of Epigrams''. London: Penguin Books, 2001, p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Deborah Jane Trimmer''' [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] ({{IPAc-en|k|ɑr}}; 30 September 1921{{spaced ndash}}16 October 2007), known professionally as '''Deborah Kerr''', was a Scottish film, theatre and television actress. During her career, she won a [[Golden Globe Award]] for her performance as [[Anna Leonowens]] in the musical film ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King and I]]'' (1956) and a [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her performance as Laura Reynolds in the play ''[[Tea and Sympathy (play)|Tea and Sympathy]]'' (a role she originated on Broadway). She was also a three-time winner of the [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress]].

Kerr was nominated six times for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], more than any other actress without ever winning. In 1994, however, having already received honorary awards from the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]], she received an [[Academy Honorary Award]] with a citation recognising her as "an artist of impeccable grace and beauty, a dedicated actress whose motion picture career has always stood for perfection, discipline and elegance".&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7051206.stm |title=British actress Kerr dies at 86 |work=BBC News |date=18 October 2007 |accessdate=10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King and I]]'' (1956), her films include ''[[An Affair to Remember]]'', ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'', ''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis]]'', ''[[The Innocents (1961 film)|The Innocents]]'', ''[[Black Narcissus]]'', ''[[Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison]]'', ''[[King Solomon's Mines (1950 film)|King Solomon's Mines]]'', ''[[The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp]]'', ''[[The Sundowners (1960 film)|The Sundowners]]'', and ''[[Separate Tables (film)|Separate Tables]]''.

Kerr had a younger brother, Edmund ("Teddy"), who became a journalist. He was killed in a [[road rage]] incident in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Road rage' killer's appeal win |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_midlands/4861328.stm |work=BBC News |date=30 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Killer's term cut |url=http://archive.worcesternews.co.uk/2006/4/5/408116.html |publisher=Worcester News |date=5 April 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722210505/http://archive.worcesternews.co.uk/2006/4/5/408116.html |archivedate=22 July 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerr was educated at the independent Northumberland House School, [[Henleaze]] in [[Bristol]], and at Rossholme School, [[Weston-super-Mare]]. Kerr originally trained as a ballet dancer, first appearing on stage at [[Sadler's Wells Theatre|Sadler's Wells]] in 1938. After changing careers, she soon found success as an actress. Her first acting teacher was her aunt, Phyllis Smale, who ran the Hicks-Smale Drama School in [[Bristol]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5212/is_2000/ai_n19128627 |title=Deborah Kerr profile |year=2000 |work=International Dictionary of Film and Filmmakers |publisher=FindArticles.com |first=Richard |last=Sater |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020185730/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5212/is_2000/ai_n19128627 |archivedate=20 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She adopted the name Deborah Kerr on becoming a film actress ("Kerr" was a family name going back to the maternal grandmother of her grandfather Arthur Kerr-Trimmer).&lt;ref name="Deborah"&gt;Braun, Eric.

== Career ==

===Theatre===
Kerr's first stage appearance was at Weston-super-Mare in 1937, as "Harlequin" in the mime play ''Harlequin and Columbine''. She then went to the Sadler's Wells ballet school and in 1938 made her début in the corps de ballet in ''Prometheus''. After various walk-on parts in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] productions at the Open-Air Theatre in [[Regent's Park]], London, she joined the Oxford Playhouse repertory company in 1940, playing, ''inter alia'', "Margaret" in ''Dear Brutus'' and "Patty Moss" in ''The Two Bouquets''.&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt;

In 1943, aged 21, Kerr made her West End début as "Ellie Dunn" in a revival of ''Heartbreak House'' at the [[Cambridge Theatre]], stealing attention from stalwarts such as [[Edith Evans]] and [[Isabel Jeans]]. "She has the rare gift", wrote critic Beverley Baxter, "of thinking her lines, not merely remembering them. The process of development from a romantic, silly girl to a hard, disillusioned woman in three hours was moving and convincing".&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt;

Kerr returned to the London stage 29 years later, in many productions including the old-fashioned, ''The Day After the Fair'' (Lyric, 1972), a [[Peter Ustinov]] comedy, ''Overheard'' (Haymarket, 1981) and a revival of [[Emlyn Williams]]'s ''The Corn is Green''.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; After her first London success in 1943, she toured England and Scotland in ''Heartbreak House''. Near the end of the Second World War, she also toured Holland, France, and Belgium for [[ENSA]] as "Mrs Manningham" in ''Angel Street'', and Britain (with [[Stewart Granger]]) in ''Gaslight''.

Having established herself as a film actress in the meantime, she made her Broadway debut in 1953, appearing in [[Robert Woodruff Anderson|Robert Anderson]]'s ''[[Tea and Sympathy (play)|Tea and Sympathy]]'', for which she received a [[Tony Award]] nomination. Kerr repeated her role along with her stage partner [[John Kerr (actor)|John Kerr]] (no relation) in [[Vincente Minnelli]]'s film adaptation of the drama. In 1955, Kerr won the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her performance in Chicago during a national tour of the play. After her Broadway début in 1953, she toured the United States with ''Tea and Sympathy''. In 1975, she returned to Broadway, creating the role of Nancy in [[Edward Albee]]'s [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning play ''[[Seascape (play)|Seascape]]''.

In 1977, she came back to the West End, playing the title role in a production of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Candida (play)|Candida]]''.

The theatre, despite her success in films, was always to remain Kerr's first love, even though going on stage filled her with trepidation:
{{quote|I do it because it's exactly like dressing up for the grown ups. I don't mean to belittle acting but I'm like a child when I'm out there performing—shocking the grownups, enchanting them, making them laugh or cry. It's an unbelievable terror, a kind of masochistic madness. The older you get, the easier it should be but it isn't.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1566509/Deborah-Kerr.html |title=Deborah Kerr profile in |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=19 October 2007 |accessdate=20 October 2007 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Films===
[[File:Deborah Kerr in Young Bess trailer.jpg|thumb|Kerr in ''[[Young Bess]]'' (1953)]]
[[File:Deborah Kerr in An Affair to Remember trailer.jpg|thumb|180px|Kerr in ''[[An Affair to Remember]]'' (1957)]]
[[File:Deborah Kerr 4.jpg|thumb|Deborah Kerr in ''[[The Sundowners (1960 film)|The Sundowners]]'' (1960)]]
Kerr's first film role was in the British production ''[[Contraband (1940 film)|Contraband]]'' in 1940, but her scenes were edited out. With her next two British films—''[[Major Barbara]]'' and ''[[Love on the Dole]]'' (both 1941)—her screen future seemed assured and her performance, said James Agate of ''Love on the Dole'', "is not within a mile of Wendy Hiller's in the theatre, but it is a charming piece of work by a very pretty and promising beginner, so pretty and so promising that there is the usual yapping about a new star".&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt; She went on to make ''[[Hatter's Castle (film)|Hatter's Castle]]'' (1942), in which she starred opposite [[Robert Newton]] and [[James Mason]], and then played a Norwegian resistance fighter in ''[[The Day Will Dawn]]'' (1942). She was an immediate hit with the public: British exhibitors voted her the most popular local female star at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article44833626 |title=FILM NOTES. |newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |location=Perth |date=7 December 1945 |accessdate=9 July 2012 |page=13 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, she played three women in [[Michael Powell]] and [[Emeric Pressburger]]'s ''[[The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp]]''. During the filming, according to Powell's autobiography, Powell and she became lovers:&lt;ref name="Powell"&gt;{{cite book |last=Powell |first=Michael |title=A Life in Movies |publisher=[[Heinemann (publisher)|Heinemann]] |year=1986 |ISBN=0-434-59945-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "I realised that Deborah was both the ideal and the flesh-and-blood woman whom I had been searching for".&lt;ref name="Powell"/&gt; Kerr made clear that her surname should be pronounced the same as "car". To avoid confusion over pronunciation, [[Louis B. Mayer]] of [[MGM]] billed her as "Kerr rhymes with Star!"&lt;ref name="car"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/movies/19kerr.html |title=Deborah Kerr, Actress Known for Genteel Grace and a Sexy Beach Kiss, Dies at 86 |date=19 October 2007 |accessdate=20 October 2007 |author=New York Times |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[British Army]] refused to co-operate with the producers—and [[Winston Churchill]] thought the film would ruin wartime morale—''Colonel Blimp'' confounded critics when it proved to be an artistic and commercial success.&lt;ref name="Powell"/&gt; Powell hoped to reunite Kerr and lead actor [[Roger Livesey]] in his next film, ''[[A Canterbury Tale]]'' (1944), but her agent had sold her contract to MGM. According to Powell, his affair with Kerr ended when she made it clear to him that she would accept an offer to go to Hollywood if one were made.&lt;ref name="Powell"/&gt;

Her role as a troubled nun in the Powell and Pressburger production of ''[[Black Narcissus]]'' in 1947 did indeed bring her to the attention of Hollywood producers. The film was a hit in the US, as well as the UK, and Kerr won the New York Film Critics' Award as Actress of the Year. British exhibitors voted her the eighth-most popular local star at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;'Bing's Lucky Number: Pa Crosby Dons 4th B.O. Crown', ''The Washington Post'' (1923–1954) [Washington, D.C] 3 January 1948: 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon she received the first of her [[Academy Award]] nominations for ''[[Edward, My Son]]'', a 1949 drama set in England that co-starred [[Spencer Tracy]].

In Hollywood, Kerr's British accent and manner led to a succession of roles portraying refined, reserved, and "proper" English ladies. Kerr, nevertheless, used any opportunity to discard her cool exterior. She starred in the 1950 adventure film ''[[King Solomon's Mines (1950 film)|King Solomon's Mines]]'', shot on location in Africa with [[Stewart Granger]] and [[Richard Carlson (actor)|Richard Carlson]]. This was immediately followed by her appearance in the religious epic ''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis?]]'' (1951), shot at [[Cinecittà]] in Rome, in which she played the indomitable Lygia, a first-century Christian. She then played Princess Flavia in a remake of ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda (1952 film)|The Prisoner of Zenda]]'' (1952). In 1953, Kerr "showed her theatrical mettle" as Portia in [[Joseph Mankiewicz]]'s ''[[Julius Caesar (1953 film)|Julius Caesar]]''.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; She then departed from typecasting with a performance that brought out her sensuality, as "Karen Holmes", the embittered military wife in [[Fred Zinnemann]]'s ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'' (1953), for which she received an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]. The [[American Film Institute]] acknowledged the iconic status of the scene from that film in which [[Burt Lancaster]] and she romped illicitly and passionately amidst crashing waves on a Hawaiian beach. The organisation ranked it 20th in its [[AFI's 100 Years…100 Passions|list of the 100 most romantic films of all time]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afi.com/100Years/passions.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Thereafter, Kerr's career choices would make her known in Hollywood for her versatility as an actress.&lt;ref name="car" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/10/18/asia/obits.php "Deborah Kerr, versatile British actress, dies at 86."] ''International Herald Tribune'', 18 October 2007. Retrieved on 11 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; She played the repressed wife in ''[[The End of the Affair (1955 film)|The End of the Affair]]'' (1955), with [[Van Johnson]]; a nun in ''[[Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison]]'' (1957) opposite her long-time friend [[Robert Mitchum]]; a mama's girl in ''[[Separate Tables (film)|Separate Tables]]'' (1958) opposite [[David Niven]]; and a governess in both ''[[The Chalk Garden (film)|The Chalk Garden]]'' (1964) and ''[[The Innocents (1961 film)|The Innocents]]'' (1961) where she plays a governess tormented by apparitions. She also portrayed an earthy Australian sheep-herder's wife in ''[[The Sundowners (1960 film)|The Sundowners]]'' (1960) and appeared as lustful and beautiful screen enchantresses in both ''[[Beloved Infidel]]'' (1959) and ''[[Bonjour Tristesse (film)|Bonjour Tristesse]]'' (1958).

Among her most famous roles were [[Anna Leonowens]] in the film version of the [[Richard Rodgers|Rodgers]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II|Hammerstein]] musical ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King and I]]'' (1956); and opposite [[Cary Grant]] as his shipboard romantic interest Terry McKay in the bittersweet love story ''[[An Affair to Remember]]'' (1957). She reunited with Grant and Mitchum for a sophisticated comedy, ''[[The Grass Is Greener]]'' (1960), and then joined [[Dean Martin]] and [[Frank Sinatra]] in a love triangle for a romantic comedy, ''[[Marriage on the Rocks]]'' (1965). In 1966, the producers of ''[[Carry On Screaming!]]'' offered her a fee comparable to that paid to the rest of the cast combined, but she turned it down in favor of appearing in an aborted stage version of ''[[Flowers for Algernon]]''.

In 1967, Kerr appeared in the comedy ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'', achieving the distinction of being, at 46, the oldest "[[Bond Girl]]" in any [[James Bond]] film, until [[Monica Bellucci]], at the age of 50, in ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' (2015). In 1969, pressure of competition from younger, upcoming actresses made her agree to appear nude in [[John Frankenheimer]]'s ''[[The Gypsy Moths]]'', the only nude scene in her career. Concern about the parts being offered to her, as well as the increasing amount of nudity included in films, led her to abandon the medium at the end of the 1960s in favour of television and theatre work.&lt;ref name="Deborah"/&gt;

===Television===
Kerr experienced a career resurgence on television in the early 1980s when she played the role of the nurse—played by [[Elsa Lanchester]] in the 1957 movie—in ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1982 film)|Witness for the Prosecution]]''. Later, Kerr rejoined screen partner Robert Mitchum in ''[[Reunion at Fairborough]]''. She also took on the role of the older Emma Harte, a tycoon, in the adaptation of [[Barbara Taylor Bradford]]'s ''[[A Woman of Substance (miniseries)|A Woman of Substance]]''. For this performance, Kerr was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]].

== Personal life ==
Kerr's first marriage was to [[Squadron Leader]] [[Tony Bartley|Anthony Bartley]] [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] on 29 November 1945. They had two daughters, Melanie Jane (born 27 December 1947) and Francesca Ann (born 20 December 1951 and subsequently married to the actor [[John Shrapnel]]). The marriage was troubled, owing to Bartley's jealousy of his wife's fame and financial success,&lt;ref name="Deborah"/&gt; and because her career often took her away from home. They divorced in 1959.

Her second marriage was to author [[Peter Viertel]] on 23 July 1960. In marrying Viertel, she became stepmother to Viertel's daughter, Christine Viertel. Although she long resided in [[Klosters]], Switzerland and [[Marbella]], Spain, she moved back to Britain to be closer to her own children as her health began to deteriorate. Her husband, however, continued to live in Marbella.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/actress-deborah-kerr-dies-at-86/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
Kerr died aged 86 on 16 October 2007 at [[Botesdale]], a village in county of [[Suffolk]], England, from the effects of [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref name="ClarkM-USAT-obit"&gt;Clark, Mike.

Kerr was made a Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in 1998, but was unable to accept the honour in person because of ill health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Baxter |title=Deborah Kerr |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/oct/18/obituaries.news |format=obituary |publisher=Guardian Unlimited |date=18 October 2007 |accessdate=10 May 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also honoured in Hollywood, where she received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 1709 Vine Street for her contributions to the motion picture industry.

==Politics==

==Personal life==
Zimmerman was married to [[Davao City mayor]] [[Rodrigo Duterte]] (who later became [[President of the Philippines]]) for over 25 years with whom she has three children including [[Paolo Duterte|Paolo]] and [[Sara Duterte]]. She filed for a civil annulment in 1998. For a few months at the time the annulment was filed, Zimmerman had been living with her brother in Manila but occasionally visited Davao City since her children with Duterte were still studying there. Duterte has admitted that his ex-wife left him after she caught him cheating. The civil annulment was granted in 2000.&lt;ref name="philandering"/&gt; After the annulment, Zimmerman remained friends with her former husband.&lt;ref name=ties/&gt; She chose to continue using "Duterte" as part of her surname despite the annulment, saying that her marriage with Duterte has never been [[declaration of nullity|declared null]] by the [[Roman Catholic Church]].&lt;ref name="campaignroadtrip"/&gt;

'''Ernest François Eugène Douwes Dekker''' also known as ''[[Setyabudi]]'' or ''Setiabudi'' (8 October 1879 – 28 August 1950) was an [[Indonesia]]n-[[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Indonesian National Revolution|nationalist]] and politician of [[Indo people|Indo]] descent. He was related to the famous Dutch anti-colonialism writer [[Multatuli]], whose real name was Eduard Douwes Dekker ("Douwes Dekker" being their surname). In his youth, he fought in the [[Second Boer War]] in South Africa on the [[Boer]] side. His thoughts were highly influential in the early years of the Indonesian freedom movement.

After Indonesian independence, he adopted the [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]] name '''Danoedirdja Setiaboedi'''.

==Early years==
Douwes Dekker was born in Pasuruan, in the north eastern city of Java, 80&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Surabaya]]. His father was Auguste Henri Edouard Douwes Dekker, a broker and bank agent,&lt;ref name = "Douwes"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.inghist.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/BWN/lemmata/bwn5/douwes_de
|title=DOUWES DEKKER, Ernest François Eugène, 1879–1950|publisher=Instituut voor Nederlandse Geschiedenis
|accessdate=8 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a Dutch family living in the then-[[Dutch East Indies]].  His [[Indo people|Indo (Eurasian)]] mother was Louisa Margaretha Neumann, of half-[[Germans|German]] and half-[[Javanese people|Javanese]] descent. Douwes Dekker's great-uncle was the famous writer [[Multatuli|Eduard Douwes Dekker]], author of ''[[Max Havelaar]]''.&lt;ref name="Setiabuddhi"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After studying in Lower School in Pasuruan, he moved to Surabaya, and later to [[Jakarta|Batavia]]. In 1897, he gained his diploma and worked on a coffee [[plantation]] in [[Malang]], [[East Java]]. Later he moved to a sugar [[plantation]] in Kraksaan, East Java. During his years in these plantations, he came in contact with ordinary [[Javanese people|Javanese]] and saw the realities of their hard work.&lt;ref name = "Douwes" /&gt;

==Second Boer War==
In 1900, along with his brothers Julius and Guido, he decided to [[Boer foreign volunteers|volunteer]] for service in the [[Second Boer War]].&lt;ref name = "Setiabuddhi" /&gt;  They arrived in [[South African Republic|Transvaal]], and became citizens of that state.&lt;ref name = "Douwes" /&gt; He based his actions on the belief that the [[Boer]]s were victims of [[British Empire|British]] expansionism, and as fellow descendant of the Dutch, he was obliged to help.  In the course of the war, he was captured by the British and placed in an internment camp on [[Ceylon]].

Dekker was later released and returned to the Dutch East Indies via Paris in 1903.

==Indonesian struggle==
In the Dutch East Indies, Dekker, then still in his twenties, started a career as a journalist, first in [[Semarang]] and later in [[Jakarta|Batavia]]. There he worked with [[Indo people|Indo]] activist [[Karel Zaalberg]], the chief editor of the newspaper ''[[Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad]]'', whom he befriended. On 5 May 1903 he married Clara Charlotte Deije, who would bear him three children. Unlike other people of European descent, he did not favour [[colonialism]], strongly advocating self-management, and finally the independence, of the Dutch East Indies. This was prompted partly by his experience in watching the lives of plantation workers and partly by discrimination he had suffered, through being only considered half-Dutch and a second-class citizen.

During these times, he published many articles advocating independence, and "Indies nationalism".&lt;ref name = "Movements"&gt;{{cite book
|title=Indonesia, Early Political Movements|publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies
|accessdate=8 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1913, close associates of Douwes Dekker, including physicians [[Tjipto Mangunkusumo]] and [[Suwardi Surjaningrat]], established the Native Committee in [[Bandung]], which later became the [[Indische Party|Indische Partij]].&lt;ref name = "Douwes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://countrystudies.us/indonesia/14.htm
|title=The Growth of National Consciousness|publisher=[[Federal Research Division]] of the [[Library of Congress]]
|accessdate=8 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was considered a breakthrough, because most organisations had never so openly advocated independence. In March 1913, the party claimed approximately 7000 members, approximately 5500 of whom were [[Indo people|Indo]]s (people of mixed Dutch-Indonesian ancestry) along with 1500 native Indonesians. The Colonial government quickly became worried and the party was forbidden. This led to the [[exile]] to the [[Netherlands]] of Douwes Dekker and his two Javanese associates.

In exile, they worked with liberal Dutchmen and compatriot students. It is believed that the term ''Indonesia'' was first used in the name of an organization, the Indonesian Alliance of Students, with which they were associated during the early 1920s.&lt;ref name = "Movements" /&gt; After his party was forbidden it directly inspired the foundation of the [[Insulinde (political party)|Insulinde]] and an [[Indo people|Indo]]-European party named '[[Indo Europeesch Verbond]]' chaired by his friend [[Karel Zaalberg]] and also advocated independence. Many of the former 'Indische Partij' members joined the new party that grew to 10.000 members.&lt;ref&gt;Postma, Ulbe: ''Karel Zaalberg, journalist en strijder voor de Indo.'' (Publisher [[KITLV]], Leiden, 1997.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918 he was allowed to return to the East Indies and was responsible for reforming the 'Insulinde' into the new 'National Indische Party' (NIP). Together with his new associate [[P.F. Dahler]] and old companion [[Tjipto Mangoenkoesoemo]], he became a prominent leader of the NIP.  After the NIP was involved in the [[Surakarta]] farmers' strike he was imprisoned again by the colonial authorities in 1921.&lt;ref name="Dutch Institute for History – ING"&gt;[http://www.inghist.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/BWN/lemmata/bwn5/douwes_de  Dutch Institute for History – ING.]&lt;/ref&gt;

After his release from prison in 1922, he taught in Bandung in a lower school. Two years later as head of the school, he renamed it the "Ksatrian Institute". This institute was officially recognised by the government in 1926. In the same year, he married Johanna Mussel, one of its teachers, six years after divorcing his first wife. [[Sukarno]] was a teacher at one of his schools.
&lt;ref&gt;Penders, Christiaan Lambert Maria [http://www.papuaweb.org/dlib/bk/penders1974/01.pdf ''The life and times of Sukarno''] (Publisher: [[Sidgwick &amp; Jackson]], London, 1974) P.20 {{ISBN|0283484144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, however, his activities were branded illegal, and in 1936 he was condemned to three months in prison.&lt;ref name = "Douwes" /&gt; He was still actively advocating independence and sharing his thoughts with other intellectuals, among them [[Sukarno]], who considered Douwes Dekker as his teacher.&lt;ref name = "Setiabuddhi" /&gt; Later, however, his influence was overshadowed by the politics of his student Sukarno's [[Indonesian National Party]] (PNI), Islamist [[Sarekat Islam]], and [[Communist Party of Indonesia]].

During [[World War II]], Dutch authorities, who considered him a dangerous activist, exiled him, along with many Indo-European of [[Germans|German]] descent, to [[Suriname]].&lt;ref name = "Setiabuddhi" /&gt; He would spend years in a forest prison camp called [[Jodensavanne]].

Dekker returned to Indonesia on 2 January 1947.

==Later years==
After he returned to Indonesia, he was appointed a member of the provisional parliament, or ''Komite Nasional Indonesia Pusat'' (''Indonesian National Central Committee''). In February 1947, he changed his name to ''Danudirja Setiabudi'' which means 'powerful substance, faithful spirit'. In 1947 he divorced his second wife and married the [[Indo people|Indo European]] ''Nelly Alberta Kruymel'', who had changed her name to ''Haroemi Wanasita'', in an Islamic ceremony.&lt;ref name="inghist.nl"&gt;[http://www.inghist.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/BWN/lemmata/bwn5/douwes_de Dutch Institute for History – ING.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1948 he was lifted from his sick bed and arrested by Dutch troops, but released due to his poor health.&lt;ref name="Dutch Institute for History – ING"/&gt;

He spent his last years in Bandung, writing his autobiography, ''70 Jaar Konsekwent''.
On his seventieth birthday to his delight he witnessed the formal Dutch transfer of sovereignty to Indonesia in 1949. He died eight months later in 1950.&lt;ref name="inghist.nl"/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Ernest Douwes Dekker 1962 Indonesia stamp.jpg|thumb|280px|1962 Indonesian stamp in the series "National Heroes" featuring Dekker]]
In Dutch literature he is portrayed as a tragic and misunderstood historic figure.&lt;ref name="inghist.nl"/&gt; However, his legacy as a national hero is still appreciated in Indonesia; a district and a main street in [[Jakarta]] are named ''[[Setiabudi, South Jakarta|Setiabudi]]'' in his honour. In Bandung, there is also a main street called ''Setiabudi'', and another is named ''Ksatrian'' after his school. He was recognized as National Hero by President Sukarno.  His life is recorded in a biography, '''Het Leven van EFE Douwes Dekker'', by Frans Glissenaar in 1999.

[[File:Sanpablotregua.JPG|thumb|350px|Foresters of [[Southern University of Chile]] in the [[Valdivian forest]]s of [[San Pablo de Tregua]], [[Chile]].]]
A '''forester''' is a person who practices [[forestry]], the science, art, and profession of managing [[forest]]s. Foresters engage in a broad range of activities including [[Restoration ecology|ecological restoration]] and management of [[Protected forest|protected areas]]. Foresters manage forests to provide a variety of objectives including direct extraction of [[Forest product|raw material]], [[outdoor recreation]], conservation, hunting and aesthetics. Emerging [[Forest management|management practices]] include managing forestlands for [[biodiversity]], [[carbon sequestration]] and air quality.

Many people confuse the role of the forester with that of the [[Lumberjack|logger]], but most foresters are concerned not only with the harvest of timber, but also with the [[Sustainable forestry|sustainable management]] of forests to (in the words of [[Gifford Pinchot]]) "provide the greatest good for the greatest number in the long term".{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Another notable forester, Jack C. Westoby, remarked that "forestry is concerned not with trees, but with how trees can serve people".{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

The median salary of foresters in the [[United States]] was $53,750, in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos048.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106205746/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos048.htm |date=November 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning foresters without bachelor's degrees make considerably less. Those with master's degrees are able to command salaries closer to the average. The [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] considers the [[Society of American Foresters]] as the principal [[Educational accreditation|accreditor]] for academic degree programs in professional forestry, both at a [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor's]] and [[Master's degree|Master's]] level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chea.org/userfiles/Recognition/SAF.pdf|title=COUNCIL FOR HIGHER EDUCATION ACCREDITATION|last=|first=|date=2015|website=www.chea.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually a bachelor's degree is considered the minimum education required, but some individuals are able to secure a job without a college education based on their experience.  Some states have a licensing requirement for foresters, and most of those require at least a four-year degree.

Foresters are often employed by private industry, federal and state land management agencies, or private consulting firms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.safnet.org/fs/careerbro.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval foresters==

'''Forester''' was also a title used widely during [[Medieval]] times. The forester usually held a position equal to a sheriff or local law enforcer, and he could act as a barrister or arbiter. He was often based in a [[forester's lodge]], and was responsible for patrolling the woodlands on a lord or noble's property, hence the synonymous term 'woodward'. His duties included negotiating sales of lumber and timber and stopping poachers from illegally hunting. Frequently outlaws would take refuge in heavily wooded regions. When this occurred it was the duty of the forester to organize armed [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse]]s to capture or disperse the criminals. The pay and status of foresters was usually above average,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://hkcarms.tripod.com/oc8.html|title = Medieval Occupations|date = |accessdate = March 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting the responsibility of their role in a medieval environment and economy.

'''Frances Mary Buss''' (16 August 1827 &amp;ndash; 24 December 1894) was a British [[headmistress]] and a pioneer of [[women's education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9018290/Frances-Buss|title=Britannica Online Encyclopedia|accessdate=2008-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MLCS"&gt;{{cite web|title=In Memoriam: Frances Mary Buss|url=http://nlcsarchives.daisy.websds.net/PDFFiles/MemorialBooks/NLCSMBK0005.pdf|website=North London Collegiate School|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
The daughter of [[Robert William Buss]], a painter and etcher, and his wife, Frances Fleetwood, Buss was one of six of their ten children to survive into adulthood. Her grandparents, whom she was visiting in [[Aldersgate]], sent her to a private school housed in the most basic accommodation "...to get me out of the way".&lt;ref&gt;A. E. Ridley, Frances Mary Buss and her work for education (1895) pg 3&lt;/ref&gt; Next she was sent to a similar school in [[Kentish Town]] which she remembered as simply consisting of children learning [[Lindley Murray|Murray]]'s ''[[History of English grammars|Grammar]]''. Aged 10 she attended a more advanced school in [[Hampstead]]; by the age of fourteen she herself was teaching there and by sixteen she was occasionally left in charge of the school.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;Elizabeth Coutts, 'Buss, Frances Mary (1827–1894)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Her father's career as an artist being at times unsuccessful, to help the family finances her mother set up a private school in Clarence Road, Kentish Town, in 1845, at which Frances assisted,&lt;ref&gt;Kamm, Josephine 'How Different From Us: A Biography of Miss Buss and Miss Beale' London: The Bodley Head (1958)&lt;/ref&gt; and which was based on the ideas of [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]].

During 1848&amp;ndash;9, she attended evening lectures at the newly opened [[Queen's College, London|Queen's College]] in [[Harley Street]], London. She was taught by [[Frederick Denison Maurice|F. D. Maurice]], [[Charles Kingsley]], and [[R. C. Trench]], and gained certificates in French, German and Geography. To [[Dorothea Beale]], a contemporary at Queen's, she described the education she had gained there as opening 'a new life to me, I mean intellectually'.&lt;ref&gt;Buss to Beale, 13 Jan 1889, North London Collegiate School archives&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
The school was renamed the [[North London Collegiate School|North London Collegiate School for Ladies]] and moved to larger premises in Camden Street on 4 April 1850. Buss was its first Headmistress and remained so for the rest of her life. Under her headship, and with the help of family members, the school became a model for [[girls' education]]. By 1865 the school had 200 day girls, with a few boarders, but was still run as a private, family concern, with her father [[Robert William Buss]] and her brother Septimus Buss teaching [[Art]] and [[Bible|Scripture]] respectively.

In July 1870 Frances Mary Buss handed over the school to trustees, and in the following year she founded the [[Camden School for Girls]] with the aim of offering more affordable education for girls. She was the first person ever to use the title Headmistress.&lt;ref&gt;'The North London Collegiate School 1850-1950: A Hundred Years of Girls' Education' Published by Oxford University Press (1950)&lt;/ref&gt;

Buss was at the forefront of campaigns for the endowment of girls' schools, and for girls to be allowed to sit public examinations and to enter universities. She became the founding president of the [[Association of Head Mistresses]] in 1874, a position she held until 1894,&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of British Educationists By Richard Aldrich and Peter Gordon Published by Routledge (1989) {{ISBN|0-7130-0177-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also involved in establishing the Teachers' Guild in 1883 and the Cambridge Training College (later [[Hughes Hall, Cambridge|Hughes Hall]]) for training teachers in 1885.

In 1869 she became the first woman [[Fellow]] of the [[College of Teachers|College of Preceptors]], helping to establish the College's professorship of the science and art of education in 1872. Her election to a Fellowship of the College in 1873 was the only public recognition she ever received.&lt;ref&gt;College of Teachers' Archive&lt;/ref&gt; She was also a member of the Council of the Teachers' Training and Registration Society.

Buss was also a [[suffragist]], participating in the [[Kensington Society (suffragette group)|Kensington Society]], a woman's discussion society, and the London Suffrage Committee.

She is buried in the churchyard of Theydon Bois in Essex.

==Legacy==
Her name is associated with that of [[Dorothea Beale]] in a satirical rhyme:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Miss Buss and Miss Beale,
[[Cupid]]'s darts do not feel.
How different from us,
Miss Beale and Miss Buss.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the spring of each year North London Collegiate School, North London Collegiate School Jeju (in [[South Korea]]) and [[Camden School for Girls]] all hold Founder's Day to commemorate Frances Mary Buss and her legacy. Pupils, staff and guests each carry a daffodil in memory of Miss Buss's favourite flower.

The educational values that Frances Mary Buss taught at the [[North London Collegiate School]] became the model for many schools throughout the UK and overseas.  This included [[Pretoria High School for Girls]], founded in [[South Africa]] by Edith Aitken, a former pupil of Miss Buss.&lt;ref&gt;http://hamiltonschool.pta.myweb.absamail.co.za/hamiltonhistory.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gad''' ({{IPAc-en|ɡ|æ|d}}) was a seer or [[prophet]] mentioned in the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the writings of Jewish historian [[Josephus]]. He was one of the personal prophets of [[King David]] of [[Israel]] and, according to the [[Talmud]]ic tradition, some of his writings are believed to be included in the [[Books of Samuel]].&lt;ref&gt;Apologetics Press, [http://www.apologeticspress.org/articles/1972 The Canon and Extra-Canonical Writings], 2003&lt;/ref&gt; He is first mentioned in {{bibleverse|1|Samuel|22:5|HE}} telling David to return from refuge in [[Moab]] to the forest of [[Hereth]] in the [[land of Judah]].

The next biblical reference to Gad is {{bibleverse|2|Samuel|24:11-13|HE}} where, after David [[Confession of sin|confesses his sin]] of taking a census of the people of Israel and Judah, God sends Gad to David to offer him a choice of three forms of punishment.&lt;ref&gt;See also Josephus, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/josephus/ant-7.htm ''Antiquities''], 7:13,4&lt;/ref&gt;

Gad is mentioned a final time in the [[Books of Samuel]] in {{bibleverse|2|Samuel|24:18|HE}}, coming to David and telling him to build an altar to God after God stops the plague that David had chosen as punishment. The place indicated by Gad for the altar is "in the [[threshing-floor]] of [[Araunah]] the [[Jebusite]]".

{{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|21:18|HE}} tells of an encounter Gad had with the [[angel of the Lord]].

A tomb attributed to Gad is located at [[Halhul]].&lt;ref&gt;''Burial Places of the Fathers'', published by Yehuda Levi Nahum in book: ''Ṣohar la-ḥasifat ginzei teiman'' (Heb. '''צהר לחשיפת גנזי תימן'''), Tel-Aviv 1986, p. 253 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Chronicles of Gad the seer==
{{main|Book of Gad the Seer}}

The words, or chronicle, of Gad the seer are mentioned in {{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|29:29|HE}} and are generally considered a [[Lost books of the Hebrew Bible|lost text]].

'''Goetz Oertel''' (born August 24, 1934) is an American [[physicist]] and science manager.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;

==Youth==

===Flight from West Prussia===

Oertel was born in [[Stuhm]], [[West Prussia]], Germany (today Sztum, Poland). In January 1945, Oertel escaped from the advancing [[Red Army]] with his parents, milling director Egon Oertel and his wife Margarete (née Wittek) westwards, initially to Gransee in Brandenburg, then continuing to Triptis in Thuringia which was captured by US forces rather than the Soviets.  When Thuringia fell under Soviet control in the course of the [[Potsdam Agreement]], the flight continued by horse and carriage, further westwards to Öhringen in southwestern Württemberg. Goetz's father was able to support the family through his hobby, genealogy. His hometown, lying east of the [[Oder–Neisse line]], was transferred to Poland after the war.

===Education===

After the [[Abitur]] at the Robert-Mayer-High School in Heilbronn and first work experiences in the private economy at the energy corporation AEG in Stuttgart, Oertel commenced his studies of physics at the [[Christian-Albrechts University]] in Kiel in 1953. A son of a member of the Corps (student fraternity) Masovia, he equally sought membership  in the Kiel Corps Palaiomarchia-Masovia, where he sustained in four fencing duels.&lt;ref&gt;Kösener Corpslisten 1996, ''' 114''', 61&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physicist in the US==

Goetz followed his supervisor of his doctoral thesis to the US in 1957 with a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright stipend]], and got a position as physics research associate at the [[University of Maryland]]. He married Brigitte Beckmann in 1960, and became neighbor as well as friends with Karl-Ludwig Stellmacher, a German – American mathematician.

After his successful PhD promotion he was hired by [[NASA]] in January 1963 at their [[Langley Research Center]] as a researcher. The agency promoted his naturalization to US citizenship and provided him with responsibility over a current research project. He had to convince the NASA and [[General Electric]] engineers that the project was  unviable and had to be restructured substantially. At the same time, his experimental research results from his PhD thesis became published and resulted in the application for two patents.

===Solar physics===

In 1967, the NASA HQ offered Goetz Oertel a senior position in Washington, D.C. and thus enabled a continuation of his theoretical work. When he was finally named leader of the program of the ATM of [[Skylab]], consequentially becoming responsible for continuously increasing roles and functions, and finally was promoted Chief of Solar Physics, he had to come to an end with his experimental work, albeit successfully.

===Nuclear energy===

In 1974, the [[Nixon administration]] drafted its Federal Executive Development Program, with the goal to reduce the isolation of the Federal ministries, specifically among the higher level civil servants, the so-called super-grades. As a consequence, management skills gained a higher weight than the academic knowledge of the subject matter.  Around 8.000 mid-level civil servants had to apply for 25 positions. Oertel applied successfully and was offered „free choice“ among the Federal ministries.  After the introduction course in [[Charlottesville]], South Carolina{{check|date=September 2014}} he became, for six months each, scientific advisor to the President and at the [[Office of Management and Budget]] of the President's Office – Department for Space, Science and Energy. In 1975, he was appointed Head of the Astronomy Program at the [[Ministry of Science]]{{clarify|date=September 2014}}, and in 1976 Chief of Staff of the Assistant Administrator for nuclear energy. From 1977 to 1984, he served as director for nuclear energy facilities (including nuclear waste- and secondary products of the defense sector) in the newly created [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]].  New positions at the [[Savannah River Site]] in [[South Carolina]] in Albuquerque brought responsibilities for 32,000 employees and an overall budget of USD 3 billion.

===Astronomy===

Oertel returned to the Ministry of Energy in 1985 as deputy assistant. Dealing with  the consequences of the [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]] space shuttle accident and the [[Chernobyl disaster]], the appointment to President and Chief Executive of [[Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy|AURA]] came at a suitable moment. AURA operated the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], space- and solar observatories in Arizona, New Mexico and Chile, and, more recently, also the [[Gemini Observatory]]s in Hawaii and Chile. After thirteen successful years at this position, Oertel finally declined a five-year renewal of his contract.

==Honorations==

Oertel remains an active member of The National Academy of Sciences, and continues his work for various foundations and universities, as well as for ministries of science in North- and South America. The National Academies elected  him as Associate for life. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers honored him with the [[Dixy Lee Ray]] Prize. Finally, the International Astronomic Union baptized an [[asteroid]] after him: [[5074&amp;nbsp;Goetzoertel]].&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;

==Private life==

Oertel and his wife have one daughter and one son. He is a member of the Corps Masovia and Palaiomarchia.&lt;ref&gt;R. Döhler: ''Verzeichnis sämtlicher Mitglieder des Corps Masovia 1823-2005''. Potsdam 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  He is an active member of the [[Cosmos Club]] in Washington D.C.

Prince '''Iraj Mirza''' ({{lang-fa|ایرج میرزا}}, literally ''Prince Iraj''; October 1874 – 14 March  1926) (titled '''Jalāl-ol-Mamālek''', {{lang-fa|جلال‌الممالک}}), son of prince Gholam-Hossein Mirza, was a famous [[Iran]]ian poet. He was a modern poet and his works are associated with the criticism of traditions. He also made translation of literary works from French into Persian.

==Life==
Iraj was born in October 1874 in [[Tabriz]], northwestern Iran. His [[pedigree chart]] shows that he was a great-grandson of [[Fath Ali Shah Qajar]], the second shah of [[Qajar dynasty]] (reigned 1797–1834). Iraj's father, prince Gholam-Hossein Mirza was son of prince Malek Iraj Mirza son of Fath Ali Shah Qajar.

Gholam-Hossein Mirza, Iraj's father, was a poet laureate or the official court-poet of [[Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar|Mozaffar al-Din Mirza]]. [[Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar|Mozaffar al-Din Mirza]], the son of [[Nasser-al-Din Shah]] (the fourth shah of [[Qajar dynasty]] reigned 1848–1896), was the [[Crown Prince]] of Iran at the time. (As a tradition, all Crown Princes during Qajar era used to reside in [[Tabriz]]).

Though some sources indicate that Iraj was schooled privately, there are reliable evidences that he studied at a branch of the [[Dar ul-Funun (Persia)|Dārolfonoon]] (House of Sciences and Techniques) in Tabriz. At 15, he was fluent in [[Persian language|Persian]], [[French language|French]], [[Arabic]] and [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]]. He was also familiar with the art of [[calligraphy]]. His handwriting was very artistic and he was and still is considered as one of the famous [[List of Persian calligraphers|calligraphers of Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Solati|first1=Bahman|title=Persian Words of Wisdom: Sayings and Proverbs by Masters of Persian Poetry|date=5 October 2015|publisher=Universal Publishers|isbn=1627340548|page=539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and offices==
In 1890, at the age of 16, Iraj got married. When he was 19, both his father and wife died.

He then took the position of his late father and became the court-poet of [[Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar|Mozaffar al-Din Mirza]] . At 22, when Mozaffar al-Din Mirza acceded to the throne in 1896 and became Mozaffar al-Din Shah; Iraj was titled as the Head of Poets (in Persian: Sadr o-Shoʻarā). He was then titled as ''Jalāl ol-Mamālek''.

Few years later, however, he left the royal court and joined the [[Tabriz]] office of Ali Khan Amin al-Dowleh who was the governor of [[Iranian Azarbaijan]]. At this time, Iraj learned [[French language|French]] and became very familiar with [[Russian language|Russian]] too.

In 1905, when Amino-Dowleh was relocated and moved to [[Tehran]], Iraj also accompanied him and soon became involved in the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution]]. In 1907 when [[Ahmad Ghavam]] (Qavam os-Saltaneh), a governmental authority, was assigned to go to [[Europe]], Iraj was asked to join him. Two years later, Iraj returned to [[Tehran]] where he started to work as a staff member in the ''Office of Official Compositions'' (in Persian: Dār ol-ʻenshā).

In 1915, his first son, Ja'afar Gholi Mirza, due to some psychological problems, committed suicide.

In 1917, Iraj joined the newly established Ministry of Culture, and three years later he was transferred to the Ministry of Finance and Revenue. From 1920 to 1925 he worked as a Revenue Officer in [[Mashhad]], the capital city of Khorasan Province (now [[Razavi Khorasan]]), in northeast of [[Iran]].

At 52, Iraj moved back to [[Tehran]] where he died on March 14, 1926.

He was survived by his second son, Khosrow Iraj.

==Poems==
Iraj is considered as one of the famous contemporary poets of [[Iran]] and also as the first Iranian master of colloquial poetry. In his verses he uses words from everyday speech. The origin of this tendency has come to be identified with his name. Through Iraj, poetic language was enriched with many colloquial words and expressions. His simple poetic language is also famous for its witticism and [[satire]].

During Qajar era, Iraj was influenced by the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution]] (1906–1911) and by the changing circumstances in the country. This fact is manifested in the particular style of poetry that he created. Modern and imported concepts, combined with what were obtained from his own thoughts, form the framework of his style. He criticizes the social conditions of the country, and the striking originality in his use of metaphor when addressing diverse social problems has been admirable by his critics.

His style is rich in the art of [[simile]]. His striking sarcasm, pungent and fanged words are pointed at the dishonest clergy, businessmen, merchants and statesmen. In addition to those colloquial poems, Iraj also composed [[elegies]] to praise [[Mozzafar-al-Din Shah]], Hassan Ali Khan Garroosy (also known as [[Amir Nezam Garroosy]], the governor of [[Iranian Azarbaijan]] (now [[East Azarbaijan]] and [[West Azarbaijan]]) and [[Kermanshah]] during Qajar era), and many other Qajar personalities. His praise never shaded into flattery. Iraj also composed very nice [[Masnavi (poetic form)|massnawi]] and [[qat'aa]] on the raising and education of children, maternal affection, love and romance.

He was an enlightened and innovative poet, and tended towards European thought.

Despite his famous technical skills, he sometimes used similar cases of rhyme, which is considered by some poetry researchers as an intentional rejection of strict traditional poetical rules. Although Iraj was one of the pioneers of the innovative movement in the Persian poetry, he never thought of abandoning the rules of the classic poetry. Some scholars believe that because of the time in which he lived, his depth of literary knowledge and his familiarity with [[French language|French]] and other foreign languages, he could also have been one of the masters of free verse if he wanted to.

He is particularly famous for his [[Pederasty|pederastic]] and satirical poetry.

Among many poems that Iraj composed, his well-known poems include Satan (in Persian: Ebleess), Mother (in Persian: Maadar), A Letter to a Poet [[Aref Ghazvini]] (in Persian: Arefnameh), Woman's Picture (in Persian: Tassvir-e Zan), Story of the Veil or Hijab (in Persian: hejab) and the Story of Zohreh and Manouchehr (in Persian: Daastan-e Zohreh o Manouchehr), which is based on [[William Shakespeare]]'s [[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)|Venus and Adonis]].

In Mother, the poet describes a child's affection for his/her mother and how the mother nurtures the child from birth onwards. The words Iraj uses are so exquisitely descriptive and lovely not only in its original Persian but also in translated versions.

The Story of Zohreh and Manouchehr is one of his famous poetic works. Here Iraj tells the story based on the [[Greek mythology|Greek myth]] of Venus and Adonis. In this poem, Zohreh leaves the gods and comes to Earth, where she is overcome by the pleasing charm of Manouchehr in his armor. He rejects her advances while Zohreh attempts her first seduction. She goes to great pains to explain the beauty of lovemaking and she finally goes her own way as she returns to the gods.

(Just for the record: On December 8, 2004 the last Iranian movies launched in France was The Story of Zohreh and Manouchehr directed by [[Mitra Farahani]]. The film had already participated in [[Berlin]] film festival and several other international events and attracted many viewers).

Iraj was known to believe that the status of Iranian women at his time was devastatingly reminiscent of the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]. Iraj could not bear to see that life was intolerable, unbearable and miserable for the courageous and valorous women of Iran. That was why he composed the very powerful and memorable pieces of Woman's daily lives in his poems.

==Tomb==

'''Itsik Moshe''' ({{lang-he|איציק משה}}) was born on December 31, in 1959 and is currently President of the Israel-Georgia Chamber of Business and the founder and Chair of Israeli House, the organization concentrated on Israeli Hasbara in the former USSR.  Formerly he was the representative of the Jewish Agency in 5 USSR countries and today continues de facto representation of Israel, after he achieved significant successes while being de jure representative.

== Biography ==
He immigrated to Israel in 1971 from Georgia with his parents Anna and Ruben, a religious Zionist family. After rapid absorption,  he continuous studding in religious school of Torah in Petah Tikva. He was elected as the Student Council chair.  After graduating from the high school served in the air forces, as part of the reserve and was named an honorary soldier.

In 1987, during his studies he became the Chairman of Student Unity and editor of newsletter "Meitar" at the university.
Despite career advancement in the department of communication, left his job in 1988 in favor of the Zionist challenge offered to him by WUJS (World Union of Jewish students) for the purpose of introducing the organization to the Soviet Union.
In 1989, during the Soviet regime established the first mission of WUJS in the capital of Georgia, Tbilisi and after that in other countries of the Soviet Union.

In 1989 established the first representation center of the Jewish Agency in Soviet Socialist Republic of Georgia.
In 1990 arranged the first historic conference in Tbilisi, in the period of “Iron Curtain”, while this kind of activities were prohibited by the totalitarian Soviet rule. Delegations of Jewish organizations from 46 cities of the Soviet Union attended the conference. 
In 1990-1992 opened 5 Representation Centers of the Jewish Agency in FSU (South Caucasus and Central Asia). 
In 1991 supported establishing two representation centers of JOINT in the Caucasus.

Furthermore, he was the organizer of 15 economic forums between Israel and Georgia in order to promote cooperation between the City Halls of Jerusalem and Tbilisi, as well as between Governmental authorities of Israel and Georgia, to deepen working links between Georgian Parliament and the Knesset.
In 2017 a cooperation between Israeli House, the Ministry of Culture of Georgia and the [http://www.jewisheritage.org/web/ AEPJ - The European Association of Jewish Heritage] has been launched regarding the promoting of Jewish Heritage in Georgia.
 
== Typical views ==
The philosophy of his life is based on three main points:
# Israeli and Jewish activities abroad - under the activities he consider the necessity of reforms in the Jewish world after the Great Allyiah.
# Israeli Hasbara - strengthening Hasbara policy led by the slogan "Let’s do and let them hear!" deepening the links with friendly countries without mediators and parochial organizations of the same ethnic origin or nationality.
# The necessity of full Israelization - Itsik Moshe considers the ethnic gap and antipathy as the greatest challenge and danger to Israel society, which still continuously develops in the newly repatriated groups in Israel and stays unsolvable. He also believes "complete disengagement from the culture and lifestyle of the past" is the only way to reach complete Israelization and Absorption.
It should be noted that his opinions in these fields create an atmosphere of confrontation with Georgian Jews and other groups, as well as International Jewish Organizations (which he represented in the past) and institutions and business persons, who use the existing cultural ghettos as the means of achieving their political success.

'''Javan''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] יָוָן, [[Standard Hebrew]] ''Yavan'', [[Tiberian Hebrew]] ''Yāwān'') was the fourth son of [[Noah]]'s son [[Japheth]] according to the "[[Generations of Noah]]" (Genesis chapter 10) in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. [[Josephus]] states the traditional belief that this individual was the ancestor of the [[Greeks]].

[[File:Noahsworld map Version2.png|thumb|right|The world as known to the Hebrews]]
Also serving as the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] name for [[Greece]] or Greeks in general, יָוָן ''Yavan'' or ''Yāwān'' has long been considered cognate with the name of the eastern Greeks, the [[Ionians]] (Greek Ἴωνες ''Iōnes'', [[Homeric Greek]] Ἰάονες ''Iáones''; [[Mycenaean Greek]] [[*#Historical linguistics|*]]Ιαϝονες ''Iawones'').&lt;ref&gt;The /v/ of Hebrew ''yavan'' supports the generally accepted reconstruction of the early form of the name of the Ionians. See: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=tUomAQAAIAAJ&amp;q= Jewish Language Review]'', Volume 3, Association for the Study of Jewish Languages, 1983, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek race has been known by cognate names throughout the Eastern [[Mediterranean]], [[Near East]] and beyond: see [[Sanskrit]] ''[[Yona]]'' &amp; [[Sanskrit]] ({{script|Deva|[[wikt:यवन#Sanskrit|यवन]]}} ''[[yavana]]'') or proto Aryan languages Sanskrit probably originated. In [[Greek mythology]], the eponymous forefather of the Ionians is similarly called [[Ion (mythology)|Ion]], a son of [[Apollo]]. The opinion that Javan is synonymous with Greek Ion and thus fathered the Ionians is common to numerous writers of the [[early modern period]] including Sir [[Walter Raleigh]], [[Samuel Bochart]], [[John Mill (theologian)|John Mill]] and [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]], and is still frequently encountered today.

Javan is also found in [[apocalyptic literature]] in the [[Book of Daniel]], 8:21-22 and 11:2, in reference to the King of Greece (יון)—most commonly interpreted as a reference to [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;See the classic reference commentary of Matthew Henry: http://www.ccel.org/ccel/henry/mhc4.Dan.ix.html&lt;/ref&gt;

While Javan is generally associated with the ancient Greeks and Greece (cf. Gen. 10:2, Dan. 8:21, Zech. 9:13, etc.), his sons (as listed in Genesis 10) have usually been associated with locations in the Northeastern Mediterranean Sea and Anatolia: [[Elishah]] (modern Cyprus), [[Tarshish]] (Tarsus in [[Cilicia]], but after 1646 often identified with Tartessus in Spain), [[Kittim]] (modern Cyprus), and [[Dodanim]] (alt. 1 Chron. 1:7 'Rodanim,' the island of [[Rhodes]], west of modern Turkey between Cyprus and the mainland of Greece).&lt;ref&gt;Anson F. Rainey, ''The Sacred Bridge: Carta’s Atlas of the Biblical Word'', Carta: Jerusalem, 2006, 27; and Yohanan Aharoni, Michael Avi-Yonah, Anson F.

'''Johan Botha''' (19 August 1965 &amp;ndash; 8 September 2016) was a South African operatic [[tenor]].

==Life and career==
Born in [[Rustenburg]], South Africa, Botha began his vocal training with Jarmilla Tellenger from the age of 10 through 17. He then served for two years in the South African Air Force before pursuing further studies in Pretoria with Eric Muller. His voice initially was trained as a bass-baritone and his first opera performance was portraying the title role in a student production of Verdi's ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]''. As his studies progressed under Muller his voice moved towards that of a tenor.&lt;ref name="ON"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2008/2/Features/Singing_Saved_His_Life.html|title=Singing Saved His Life|work=[[Opera News]]|date=February 2008|volume=72|number=8|author=Richard Dyer}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 he moved to Europe and became a longtime pupil of Irmgard Hartmann.&lt;ref name="ON"/&gt;

Botha made his professional stage debut at the municipal theatre in [[Roodepoort]] as Max in ''[[Der Freischütz]]'' in 1989. He then became a member of the opera chorus at the [[Bayreuth Festival]] in 1990. In 1991 he sang Riccardo in ''[[Un ballo in maschera]]'' at the [[Pfalztheater]] [[Kaiserslautern]]. This was followed by performances at opera houses in Dortmund, Hagen, Hildesheim and Bonn.&lt;ref name="ON"/&gt; His international breakthrough occurred in 1993 at the [[Opéra Bastille]] as Pinkerton in [[Puccini]]'s ''[[Madama Butterfly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jahn|first1=George|title=South African tenor Johan Botha dies at age 51|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/south-african-star-tenor-johan-botha-dies-at-age-51/2016/09/08/0daa9cbc-75a5-11e6-9781-49e591781754_story.html|accessdate=8 September 2016|work=Washington Post|agency=Associated Press|date=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then he performed at leading opera venues around the world such as the [[Metropolitan Opera]], [[Vienna State Opera]] which made him a [[Kammersänger]] in 2003, [[Opera Australia]], [[Royal Opera House]] (London), [[La Scala]] and the [[Salzburg Festival]].

[[File:Wiener Zentralfriedhof - Gruppe 40 - Johan Botha (1).jpg|thumb|upright|Botha's grave, [[Vienna Central Cemetery]]]]

'''Jörg Tauss''' (born 5 July 1953) is a [[Germans|German]] politician and former member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD). He was born in [[Stuttgart]]. From 2000 to 2009, Tauss was the spokesperson of the Education and Research workgroup of the SPD in the [[Bundestag]]. He also served within that time as regional party general secretary for [[Baden-Württemberg]].

On 6 March 2009, his home and offices in [[Berlin]] and [[Karlsruhe]] were raided by the [[Landeskriminalamt|LKA]]s of both Berlin and Baden-Württemberg in a search for [[child pornography]] which he had allegedly obtained on his mobile phone. Although he claimed that the raid and investigation were politically motivated, he resigned from all government posts on 7 March, and was stripped of his [[parliamentary immunity]] on the same day. Prosecutors began the investigation after they had obtained access to phone numbers and addresses found on the mobile phone of a [[Bremerhaven]] man who was suspected of participation in a child pornography ring. He stated on 11 March that he had purchased the material only for investigation purposes pertinent to his office. He reports that his research suggests that child pornography is typically distributed by [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]] and traditional mail, so that [[Internet censorship|blocking websites]] is ineffective.

On 20 June 2009, Tauss announced he was leaving the SPD for the [[Pirate Party Germany]] in protest against that party's support of legislation that would block child pornography websites, which he said would set up a technical infrastructure of [[Internet censorship in Germany|censorship]] without judicial review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Jörg Tauss verlässt die SPD, um "Pirat" zu werden |url=https://www.welt.de/politik/article3961700/Joerg-Tauss-verlaesst-die-SPD-um-Pirat-zu-werden.html |work=[[Die Welt]] |publisher= |date=June 20, 2009 |accessdate= |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/capress/090620/world/eu_germany_internet_curbs|title=Lawmaker quits German governing party over Internet curbs aimed at halting child porn|date=June 20, 2009|publisher=[[Yahoo]]|agency=[[The Canadian Press]] / [[Associated Press|AP]]|accessdate=2009-06-20}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Jörg Tauss zu seinem Austritt aus der SPD |url=http://www.tauss.de/index.php?nr=440&amp;menu=1|work=Website of Jörg Tauss |publisher= |date=June 20, 2009 |accessdate= |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 July, Tauss appealed against the law because of formal reasons at the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] in Karlsruhe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/Verfassungsbeschwerde-gegen-Netzsperren-Gesetz--/meldung/141425 |title=Verfassungsbeschwerde gegen Netzsperren-Gesetz |accessdate=2009-07-01 |date=2009-07-01 |publisher= [[Heinz Heise|Heise Verlag]] |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 September 2009, he was stripped of his parliamentary immunity and the next day he was formally charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8247060.stm | work=BBC News | title=German MP charged over child porn | date=September 9, 2009 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010 he got a suspended prison sentence of 15 months. The judge concluded that he had been active in the online child pornography scene for private reasons rather than out of political motives relating to his parliamentary work. However, the judge did not think his motivation had necessarily been sexual, it could have been sheer curiosity. 'This is a judgement which I cannot live with and do not want to live with,' Tauss said after the trial. He plans to appeal the verdict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/europe/news/article_1559195.php/German-politician-sentenced-for-child-porn-Roundup]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is a former [[King College Prep High School]] and [[Lane Technical High School]] chemistry teacher, her occupation for 22 years before becoming president of the teachers union. She is a graduate of Dartmouth College.

==Early life==
Lewis is the daughter of a family of teachers. She left [[Kenwood Academy|Kenwood High School]] (now Kenwood Academy) after her junior year to attend [[Mount Holyoke College]]. She transferred to [[Dartmouth College]] in 1972 and is the only African American woman in the class of 1974, with a degree in sociology and music.&lt;ref&gt;Greg Hinz (August 12, 2013), [http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20130810/ISSUE01/308109979/so-you-think-you-know-karen-lewis "So you think you know Karen Lewis?"] Crain's Chicago, Business.&lt;/ref&gt; A widow, her second husband is a former Chicago schools physical education teacher.

==Chicago Teachers Union==
Lewis is the president of the Chicago Teachers Union. She has been a member of the union since 1988. In 2010, Lewis, running with the Caucus of Rank and File Educators (CORE),  gained control over the CTU by winning 60% of the vote in a run-off election.&lt;ref name="Canon - 12 June 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Canon|first=Ramsin|title=Caucus of Rank-and-File Educators (CORE) Takes Over Chicago Teachers Union|url=http://gapersblock.com/mechanics/2010/06/12/caucus-of-rank-and-file-educators-core-takes-over-chicago-teachers-union/|newspaper=Gapers Block|date=June 12, 2010|accessdate=September 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CORE ran an aggressive grassroots organizing campaign, and took a strong stance against school privatization.&lt;ref name="Canon 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Canon|first=Ramsin|title=The Education Revolt: The Chicago Model's Fallout|url=http://gapersblock.com/mechanics/2010/05/03/the-education-revolt-the-chicago-models-fallout/|newspaper=Gapers Block|date=May 3, 2010|accessdate=September 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; CORE accused the incumbent United Progressive Caucus (UPC) of capitulating to corporate interests, silencing dissent within the union, and collaborating with the city to prevent union outreach at schools.&lt;ref name="Abowd - 7 June 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Abowd|first=Paul|title=Chicago's Rank and File Educators Well-Positioned Against "Play it Safe" Incumbents|url=http://labornotes.org/2010/06/chicagos-rank-and-file-educators-well-positioned-against-play-it-safe-incumbents|newspaper=Labor Notes|date=June 7, 2010|accessdate=September 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; CORE quickly took action to distinguish itself from UPC, the previous caucus controlling the CTU, reaffirm its grassroots support, and launch a campaign to defend public education.

===2012 Strike===
In early September 2012 she led the Chicago Teachers Union on a 10-day strike. Emerging victorious, the union softened the proposed teacher evaluation system, prevented the instituting of merit pay, and ensured protections for veteran teachers in phased out schools.&lt;ref&gt;Hirst, Ellen Jean, and Delgado, Jennifer (September 19, 2012), [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-09-19/news/chi-todays-assignment-seal-deal-with-chicago-teachers-20120918_1_chicago-teachers-union-chicago-students-first-day "It's back to school again for Chicago students"], ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the strike she went through several months of negotiations with Chicago mayor [[Rahm Emanuel]] and Emanuel appointee [[Chicago Public Schools]] board president [[Penny Pritzker]]. Lewis claimed that during a disagreement over lengthening the school day, Emanuel said, "Fuck you, Lewis."&lt;ref&gt;Rossi, Rosalind (September 9, 2011), [http://www.suntimes.com/news/education/7558652-418/teachers-union-president-says-mayor-emanuel-exploded-at-her.html "Teachers union president Mayor Emanuel ‘exploded’ at her"], ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Being an indigenous tribe in [[Borneo]], the '''Kayan people''' are similar to their neighbours, the [[Kenyah people|Kenyah]] tribe, with which they are grouped together with the [[Bahau people]] under the [[Apo Kayan people]] group.

The population of the Kayan ethnic group may be around 27,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cache.britannica.com/eb/article-9044919 ''Kayan'' in the Encyclopædia Britannica] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614150107/http://cache.britannica.com/eb/article-9044919 |date=14 June 2006 }}, retrieved on 12 August 2006, from Encyclopædia Britannica Premium Service.&lt;/ref&gt; They are part of a larger grouping of people referred collectively as the [[Orang Ulu]], or upriver people. Like some other [[Dayak people]], they are known for being fierce warriors, former [[headhunting|headhunters]], adept in [[Upland rice]] cultivation, and having extensive tattoos and [[Stretching (body piercing)|stretched earlobes]] amongst both sexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=|title=Monthly Packet, Volume 12|year=1857|publisher=J. and C.

==History==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Een Europeaan wordt op de oever van een rivier omringd door Kajan Dajak krijgers en bevolking tijdens een expeditie naar de berg Boekit Batoe op Serawak TMnr 60043369.jpg|thumb|left|A European man discussing with the leaders of the Kayan people in [[Sarawak]], circa 1900 to 1940.]]
They may have originated from along the Kayan river in the [[North Kalimantan province]] of Borneo. They live along the upper Kayan and the middle [[Kapuas River|Kapuas]] and [[Mahakam River|Mahakam]] rivers.&lt;ref name="TK8"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Ibuh|title=The Kayans|year=2014|publisher=Partridge Publishing Singapore|page=8|isbn=14-828-2683-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They seem to have expanded to the south in [[Sarawak]] in historic times, generating some conflicts with the [[Iban people|Iban]] that were expanding north at the same time.&lt;ref name="TK8"/&gt; They have settled in Sarawak on the middle [[Baram River]], the Bintulu River and along the [[Rajang River]],&lt;ref name="TK8"/&gt; having been pressed back a little during the late 19th century. In 1863 [[West Kalimantan]], [[Iban people]] migrated to the upstreams of Saribas River and [[Rejang River]] and started to attack the Kayan people in those areas and continued doing so northwards and later eastwards. Wars and headhunting attacks have caused many other tribes to be displaced, including the Kayan people, who make up of 1.4% of the [[West Kutai Regency]] population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michaela Haug|title=Poverty and Decentralisation in East Kalimantan|year=2010|publisher=Centaurus Verlag &amp; Media KG|isbn=9783825507701}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant expansion to the east Borneo also occurred during the historical times, the conversion of the Kayan people to [[Islam]] forming the [[ethnogenesis]] of the [[Sultanate of Bulungan|Bulungan people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony Milner|title=The Malays|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=|isbn=14-443-9166-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
The [[Kayan language (Borneo)|Kayan language]] belongs to the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] branch of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language family]].&lt;ref name="TK8"/&gt;

==Main activities==
[[File:Feuererzeugen bei den Kajan durch Reiben eines Strickes un ein Stück weichen, trockenen Holzes.jpg|thumb|left|A Kayan using [[rattan]] to "[[fire-saw|saw]]" a piece of firewood.]]
Their basic culture is similar to the other [[Dayak people]] in [[Borneo]]. Their agriculture was based upon [[shifting cultivation]] techniques and the cultivation of [[Upland rice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jérôme Rousseau|title=Central Borneo: Ethnic Identity and Social Life in a Stratified Society|year=1990|publisher=Clarendon Press|page=134|isbn=01-982-7716-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other farming such as [[sago]], corn, yams, pumpkin and tobacco are also cultivated. During the years of famine, sago is mined. Fishing (killing fish with poisons) plays an important role,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kathy MacKinnon &amp; Gusti Hatta|title=Ecology of Kalimantan: Indonesian Borneo|year=2013|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|page=|isbn=14-629-0505-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a smaller role is played by hunting with a ''[[Blowgun|sumpitan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Odoardo Beccari; Enrico Hillyer Giglioli; F H H Guillemard|title=Wanderings In The Great Forests Of Borneo Travels And Researchers Of A Naturalist In Sarawak|year=1904|publisher=London, A. Constable &amp; co., ltd.|page=264|oclc=933143659}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kayan people are engaged in breeding pigs and chickens, while dogs are kept for ritual purposes. The Kayan people are known as excellent blacksmiths (the Kayan [[Mandau (knife)|Mandau]] swords are the main item of exchange), boat builders and carpenters.&lt;ref name="EGOISA170"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank M.

==Social structure==
Traditionally, they live in [[long house]]s on river banks. Their settlement consists of one or several [[long house]]s as long as 300 meters, which can accommodate up to 100 families (400–600 people) and consist of a common veranda and rooms. Residents of a long house constitute a [[Tribe|tribal community]]. The Kayan people are divided into three [[endogamous]] caste-estate groups; "house owning group" or aristocrat (''ipun uma'' or ''keta'u''), community members or commoners (''panyun'') and slaves (''lupau'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|contribution=Great Britain.

The leader is usually elected from the nobility class (in the 19th century, he also served as a military leader). The settlement is bi-localized,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabrizain.org/malaya/library/enc-sea.pdf |title=Encyclopedia of World Cultures, Volume V: East And Southeast Asia |editor=David Levinson |publisher=G.K.

==Myth and religion==
The Kayan people a developed mythology and a complex cult (bounty hunting and human sacrifices&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=|title=Monthly Packet, Volume 12|year=1857|publisher=J. and C.

      <comment>There was no lawsuit. References to "sued" in other sources have been misinterpreted to mean "lawsuit" instead of "appeal formally to a person for something." State law was passed in 1920 allowing women into publicly funded professional and graduate schools in VA. UVA added the stipulation that women must first complete at least two years of college elsewhere. Also edited the "graduated from." She only attended Sweet Briar for the two years required to enter UVA.) I am her daughter.</comment>

'''Kitty O'Brien Joyner''' (July 11, 1916 – August 16, 1993) was an American [[electrical engineering|electrical engineer]] with the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA), and then with the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) upon its replacement of NACA in 1958. She was hired in 1939 as the organization's first woman engineer, shortly after she had completed her degree as the first woman to graduate from the [[University of Virginia]]'s engineering program.

==Early life and education==
Joyner was born in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]]. In 1937, women had not been admitted to the [[University of Virginia]] (UVA) Engineering School despite the 1920 state law allowing it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://voicesandvisibilityuva.org/about-these-portraits/women-at-uva-history/ "History of Women at UVA"]&lt;/ref&gt; UVA added several admittance requirements for women; one that women must have completed at least two years of college elsewhere. Joyner petitioned the university to gain admission and was accepted after two years at [[Sweet Briar College]]. Two years later, in 1939, she became the first woman to graduate from the University of Virginia with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[electrical engineering]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite web|work=Daily Press|url=http://articles.dailypress.com/1993-08-20/news/9308200268_1_mrs-banks-senior-choir-kiwanis-club/2|title=Obituaries - Kitty Joyner|date=20 August 1993|last=Lineberry|first=Trivia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Local author spotlights under-the-radar female mathematicians at NASA |first=Joshua |last=Adams |date=December 23, 2016 |work=C-Ville |publisher= |url=http://www.c-ville.com/local-author-spotlights-radar-female-mathematicians-nasa/#.WoZbQ-jwY2w }}&lt;/ref&gt; While at UVA, she received the [[Algernon Sydney Sullivan Award]] for excellence of character and service to humanity.&lt;ref name=obit /&gt;&lt;ref name=crgis&gt;{{cite web|work=NASA CRGIS|title=Kitty O'Brien Joyner|publisher=NASA|url=http://crgis.ndc.nasa.gov/historic/Kitty_O'Brien_Joyner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[NACA]] [[Langley Research Center|Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory]] (LMAL, later the Langley Research Center) hired Joyner as an electrical engineer in September 1939, making her their first woman engineer. Joyner worked for NACA/NASA for several decades, achieving the title Branch Head of the Facilities Cost Estimating Branch, Office of Engineering and Technical Services, and managing several [[wind tunnel]]s, including supersonic wind tunnels.&lt;ref name=hatch&gt;{{cite book|title=Changing Our World: True Stories of Women Engineers |last=Hatch |first=Sybil E. |publisher=ASCE Publications |date=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dKptTDl6eUcC&amp;pg=PA149 |location=Reston, VA |oclc=835993427 |isbn=9780784408353 |page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=crgis /&gt;

Joyner retired from NASA in May 1971.

Joyner was active in engineering organizations and societies. She was a member of the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers]] and an Honorary Life Member of the Engineers Club of the Virginia Peninsula.&lt;ref name=crgis /&gt;

==Personal life==
Joyner's husband, Upshur T. Joyner, also worked at NACA/NASA Langley for 40 years as a physicist, retiring in 1971, the same year as Kitty.&lt;ref name=crgis /&gt;

Joyner and her husband lived in [[Poquoson, Virginia]], and had two children, a son named Upshur, who died of leukemia at the age of 47 in 1990, and a daughter, Kate.&lt;ref name=crgis /&gt;

Joyner died on August 16, 1993, at the age of 77. Her husband died a few months later, in November 1993, at the age of 85.&lt;ref name=crgis /&gt;&lt;ref name=obit /&gt;

In addition to her professional and personal engineering activities, she was also the first regent and organizer for the Charles Parish Chapter of the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]], which named an annual scholarship after her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Daily Press|title=Faces/scholarships/degrees/honors|date=5 July 1989|url=http://articles.dailypress.com/1989-07-05/news/8906300084_1_full-tuition-student-leaders-attend/2|}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also a recipient of the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]] Winnie Davis Award.&lt;ref name=obit /&gt;

'''Engla Maria Magdalena Graaf''' (born 2 September 1975 in [[Gothenburg]]) is a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] [[model (person)|model]], [[singer]], and [[author]]. In 1998, she and her sister [[Hannah Graaf|Hannah]] joined together and formed the group [[The Graaf Sisters]], who became popular with the song "You Got What I Want Baby". She was also the wife of [[association football|footballer]] [[Magnus Hedman]] and as a result has been voted the sexiest footballer's wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006210542/http://www.nordinagency.se/?id=423&amp;type=fiction|title=Nordin Agency - Graaf, Magdalena|date=2011-10-06|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Graaf was born in [[Gothenburg]], but she grew up in [[Kungsängen]] in [[Stockholm County]], to [[Pentecostalism|Swedish Pentecostal]] parents.

In her late teens, Graaf became pregnant with her son Isak. Instead of burdening or embarrassing her religious parents, she married her Finnish gangster boyfriend Jorma whom she was already living with. During this time, she was physically and emotional abused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/wendela/article361558.ab |title="Jag flydde med min son i famnen" - Wendela - Aftonbladet |publisher=Aftonbladet.se |date= |accessdate=2012-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magdalenagraaf.nu/ |title=magdalenagraaf.nu |publisher=magdalenagraaf.nu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206080600/http://www.magdalenagraaf.nu/ |archivedate=February 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Graaf was shot in the leg, she left her husband despite threats against her and her family. She eventually reported him to the proper authorities. As a result, she was placed under protective custody and given new identities.&lt;ref name="aftonbladet.se"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article361032.ab |title=Hon sköts med pistol - Nyheter - Aftonbladet |publisher=Aftonbladet.se |date=2006-03-14 |accessdate=2012-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; She and her son were moved throughout Sweden but eventually settled in [[Gothenburg]] and was given the new names of Michaela and Ville for her son.&lt;ref name="Magdalena Graaf 2006"&gt;{{cite book| title= Det ska bli ett sant nöje att döda dej| author = Magdalena Graaf | publisher=Bokförlaget Lind &amp; Co AB | year = 2006 | isbn= 978-91-85267-66-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her husband was eventually released from prison and he put a 50 000 SEK bounty on her and a reward for hurting her sister model, [[Hannah Graaf|Hannah]]. After her husband's indictment, the police did little to help Graaf. She did receive some help from a policewoman who would eventually get fired for helping Graaf. To this day, Graaf has a bitter disdain for the Swedish authorities. Her plight eventually was heard by former MC gang leader who felt bad for her and decided to protect Graaf. Finally, Graaf had enough of hiding and returned home to her mother. Later her ex-husband decided to stop the harassment.&lt;ref name="Magdalena Graaf 2006"/&gt;

==Career==

=== Modeling ===
Due to all the stress following the aftermath her ex-husband's indictment, Graaf lost a great deal of weight and suffered from lack of confidence. She underwent [[breast augmentation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/sofismode/article48596.ab |title=Kändisarna som valt operation - Sofis mode - Aftonbladet |publisher=Aftonbladet.se |date=2001-12-11 |accessdate=2012-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216124655/http://www.aftonbladet.se/sofismode/article48596.ab |archivedate=December 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and started an exercise regimen. Her sister Hannah, an established model, took her to a celebrity party where she met [[E-Type (musician)|E-Type]] who hit on her. She claims this boosted her confidence and being seen on the party scene with her sister landed her a modeling career.&lt;ref name="Magdalena Graaf 2006"/&gt;

Graaf followed the footsteps of her younger sister and began glamour modeling. Graaf would often model with her sister Hannah. The two gained noterity for appearing in countless men's magazines. The controversy catapulted lesser known Graaf's career. She has appeared in the magazines ''[[Café Magazine|Café]]'', ''[[Moore Magazine|Moore]]'', and ''[[Slitz]]''. In 1998, Graaf appeared on three separate'' Café ''covers.

In 2004, The Graaf were looking for a comeback. The sisters flew to [[Los Angeles]] and did a pictorial for ''[[FHM]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expressen.se/1.215471 |title=Systrarna Graaf gör comeback - Nöje - Expressen Nöje - Nöjesnyheter Musiknyheter Filmnyheter |publisher=Expressen.se |date=2005-06-09 |accessdate=2012-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
The Graaf sisters became a cultural phenomenon and, by 1998 both sisters gave up glamour modeling to pursue a music career. That same year, she formed a musical duo [[The Graaf Sisters]] with Hannah and was quickly signed to [[Sony BMG]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/noje/9807/30/graaf.html |title=Aftonbladet nöje: Graafs debutlåt på singeltoppen |publisher=Aftonbladet.se |date= |accessdate=2012-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two worked with producers [[Christer Sandelin]], Tommy Ekman, and Rob 'n' Raz. The record yielded the Swedish #1 hit "You Got (What I Want)". The duo has since been on hiatus with both women marrying and having children.

In 2002, the sisters were involved in a civil suit against [[Mikael Brinkstierna]]. Brinkstierna alleged that the sisters began working with him in 1996 and that they had a management contract in which he was entitled to 25% of all revenues from the sisters' future disc sales. After the success of their first album, Brinkstierna received no money after he allegedly spent hours helping them be a success. The sisters claim that Brinkstierna gave them nothing but money and accused him of being a crook after a similar dispute Brinkstierna had with the pop group [[Aqua (band)|Aqua]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/musik/article99592.ab |title=Miljonkrav mot systrarna Graaf - Musik - Nöjesbladet - Aftonbladet |publisher=Aftonbladet.se |date=2002-10-12 |accessdate=2012-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Author===
In March 2006, Graaf released her biography ''Det ska bli ett sant nöje att döda dig'' ("It is going to be a true pleasure to kill you"), where she tells about her childhood and her first, problematic marriage. The title of her book was the last thing her ex-husband Jorma said to her before she left him and fled with their son Isak.&lt;ref name="aftonbladet.se"/&gt;

===Television===
Graaf participated in the Swedish edition of ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'' (''Let's Dance'') until the end of January 2009, when she was forced to quit due to a [[cerebral hemorrhage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expressen.se/noje/1.1446757/magdalena-graaf-akut-till-sjukhus-efter-blodning-i-hjarnan|title=Magdalena Graaf akut till sjukhus efter blödning i hjärnan|accessdate=2009-01-28|publisher=Expressen|author=Kai-Anders Nilsson|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also works for Postkodlotteriet and gives the winners money, Postkodsmiljonären where the main show is broadcast on [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]].

==Personal life==
In 1995, she gave birth to her first son, Isak, with her first husband.  A year and a half after Isak's birth, Graaf left her husband in 1996. In 1999, Graaf married Swedish football goalkeeper [[Magnus Hedman]]. The couple had two sons named Lancelot (born in 2000) and Tristan (born in 2004). During their early marriage, the couple lived in [[Scotland]] where Hedman was playing soccer in [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1402247/bio|title=Magdalena Graaf|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2012-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Hedman's retirement the couple resided in Stockholm. In 2006, Graaf separated from Hedman after news papers reported an alleged affair with singer [[Linda Bengtzing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Se hela veckans tv-tablå på |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/klick/article437589.ab |title="Hon är en wannabe" - Klick! - Nöjesbladet - Aftonbladet |publisher=Aftonbladet.se |date=2006-09-15 |accessdate=2012-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple have since divorced.

Her fourth son, Charlie, was born in 2011. Her oldest son Isak died in an accident on August 25, 2014. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://magdalenagraaf.se/|title=Magdalena Graafs blogg|last=blogg|first=Magdalena Graafs|website=magdalenagraaf.se|language=sv-SE|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; She gave birth to her fifth son Louie in 2016.

==Charity==
The Sisters made [[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'s List of European Heroes for their charity work. Magdalena along with Hannah have donated earnings from their modeling to aid [[orphanage]]s in [[Nagpur]] in central [[India]]. The sisters maintain that they never have strayed too far from their Pentecostal upbringing and that their commitment for charity was inherited from their mother Linda Bergling who worked as a [[missionary]] in Asia and Africa. Not only have the donated money to the cause but they have built two orphanages and school. Magdelena's then husband, Magnus claimed Magdalena would constantly hits up friends for donations at parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article135000.ab |title=Systrarna Graaf - svenska hjältar - Nyheter - Aftonbladet |publisher=Aftonbladet.se |date=2003-04-20 |accessdate=2012-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Malaika Tamu Griffin''' (born May 11, 1971) is an [[United States|American]] woman serving a life sentence at the LaVista Correctional Facility in [[Pueblo, Colorado]] for shooting her neighbor Jason Patrick Horsley to death in May 1999. After the shooting, Griffin became a fugitive from justice for six years, but after she was profiled on ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'', Griffin was captured in [[El Cajon, California]], a suburb of [[San Diego]], in June 2005.&lt;ref name="Woman"&gt;{{cite news|title=Woman Arrested in 1999 Denver Slaying|publisher=Denver News|date=2005-06-07|accessdate=2011-05-17|url=http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/4578641/detail.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Malaika Tamu Griffin was born on May 11, 1971.&lt;ref name=Griffin&gt;{{cite news|title=Griffin, Malaika|publisher=Colorado Department of Corrections|year=2011|accessdate=2011-05-17|url=http://www.doc.state.co.us/oss/}}&lt;/ref&gt;   She graduated [[magna cum laude]] from [[Jackson State University]] and received a [[Bachelor of Science]] in chemistry. Griffin was known to be a 'loner', and after her [[graduation]] from JSU, she went on a solo backpacking journey in Europe. In 1999, she moved to [[Denver, Colorado]], where she was working in a pharmacy and was renting a room in a house next door to a white couple: Jason Patrick Horsley and his girlfriend Deborah Loiselle.  Jason Horsley was a carpenter, and Griffin became angry when Horsley laid his tools on the sidewalk in front of her house after work. A bitter argument ensued on May 18, 1999.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;{{cite news|title=Black Female Terrorist-Undercover?|publisher=Panache Report|year=2011|accessdate=2011-05-17|url=http://panachereport.com/channels/hip%20hop%20gallery/HipHopShortStories/Blk%20Terror.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crime==
After arguing with Jason Horsley on May 18, 1999, Griffin returned to her apartment and came out with a 9&amp;nbsp;mm handgun with a laser sight and shot Horsley point blank in the back, killing him instantly.&lt;ref name="Trial"&gt;{{cite news|title=Trial Begins For Woman Profiled On 'America's Most Wanted'|publisher=Denver News|date=2006-02-27|accessdate=2011-05-17|url=http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/7498160/detail.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the incident, Griffin fled to the nearby home of an acquaintance, Monique Thomas. Griffin stole Thomas' car at gunpoint and then drove away. The car was later found abandoned in [[Iowa City, Iowa]].&lt;ref name="Woman"/&gt; 

Inside Malaika Griffin's apartment, police found a 9&amp;nbsp;mm carbine, ammunition, hand grenades and the library of a terrorist, with books about terrorism and bomb making including ''[[The Anarchist Cookbook]]'', ''Home Workshop Silencers'' and ''[[The Poor Man's James Bond]]''. In addition, Griffin's diary was also discovered. In it, Griffin expresses her deep hatred for white people.&lt;ref name="Black"/&gt;

==Fugitive years and capture==
Griffin had last been seen boarding a bus to [[Chicago, Illinois]].  After that, there had been no sighting of her for years.&lt;ref name="Black"/&gt;  On May 22, 2004, more than five years after the murder, Griffin was profiled again on ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'', and then again a year later on June 4, 2005. After the second showing, authorities received a tip from Griffin's co-workers.&lt;ref name="Malaika Tamu"&gt;{{cite news|title=Malaika Tamu Griffin|publisher=America's Most Wanted|year=2011|accessdate=2011-05-17|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212121345/http://www.amw.com:80/fugitives/case.cfm?id=24797}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[FBI]] and the [[El Cajon Police Department]] contacted the suspect, who had been going by the name "Lake Griffin." After the FBI confronted her, Griffin admitted her identity.&lt;ref name="Black"/&gt; She had been working at a biotech firm as a lab assistant, at a fast-food restaurant and thrift store.&lt;ref name="Woman"/&gt; Griffin was charged with first-degree murder, aggravated robbery, and aggravated motor vehicle theft. She waived her extradition and was returned to Colorado to stand trial.&lt;ref name="Malaika Tamu"/&gt;

==Trial==
Griffin's trial began on February 27, 2006.&lt;ref name="Trial"/&gt; Prosecutors also entered into evidence the weapons found in Griffin's apartment after she fled. Griffin decided to testify in her own defense at the trial. She claimed to be innocent of the offenses, and said her diary was about a play she was writing. After a one-week-long trial and seven hours of jury deliberations, Malaika Griffin was convicted on all counts.&lt;ref name="America's"&gt;{{cite news|title='America's Most Wanted' Female Fugitive Guilty Of Murder|work=Denver News|date=2006-03-06|accessdate=2011-05-17|url=http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/7756412/detail.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Colorado law, a [[first-degree murder]] conviction results in an automatic sentence of [[life in prison without parole]].

==Aftermath==
Griffin's case was profiled on the [[Oxygen Network]] program ''[[Snapped]]'' on February 3, 2008 and on [[Investigation Discovery]]'s ''[[Deadly Women]]'' on October 12, 2012.

Griffin filed an appeal in April 2009 to the [[Colorado Court of Appeals]]. She argued that her convictions should be overturned because her trial [[Lawyer|attorney]] was not licensed to practice law in Colorado, her notebook entries, self-defense instructions, and [[prosecutorial misconduct]]. All of her claims were denied, and her convictions were all affirmed on April 16, 2009.&lt;ref name="Colorado"&gt;{{cite news|title=Colorado Court of Appeals -- April 16, 2009 No. 06CA0784. People v.

'''Marc Vincent Sappington''' (born February 9, 1978) is an American [[spree killer]] convicted of murdering four acquaintances in March and April 2001 in [[Kansas City, Kansas]].&lt;ref name=APDraper&gt;{{cite news |last=Draper |first=Bill |publisher=Associated Press |date=23 July 2004 |title=Man suspected of eating victim convicted of three murders counts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AP04Dec10&gt;{{cite news |author=(no byline) |publisher=Associated Press |date=10 December 2004 |title=Another life sentence for Kansas man convicted in four murders}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gained notoriety for eating part of the leg of one of his victims, Alton "Fred" Brown.&lt;ref name=StuffMag&gt;{{cite news |last= McGraw |first= Seamus |publisher= Stuff Magazine |date= 13 August 2004 |title= Friends for Dinner |url= http://www.stuffmagazine.com/articles/index.aspx?id=799 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070929131559/http://www.stuffmagazine.com/articles/index.aspx?id=799 |archivedate= 29 September 2007 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawyers for Sappington blamed the four-day killing spree on a history of [[schizophrenia]] and daily use of the [[hallucinogen]]ic drug [[Phencyclidine|PCP]]. Sappington himself claimed that voices in his head told him to eat flesh and blood or he would die.&lt;ref name=APDraper /&gt;

Sappington was convicted on June 23, 2004 of murdering Terry T. Green, 25, Michael Weaver Jr., 22, and Alton "Fred" Brown Jr., 16 in April 2001.&lt;ref name=APDraper /&gt;
Sappington was convicted on December 10, 2004 of an attempted [[aggravated robbery]] and murder of David Mashak at his auto dealership in March 2001.&lt;ref name=AP04Dec10 /&gt; Sappington's conviction was affirmed by the Kansas Supreme Court on November 2, 2007.
  
In an April 2001 videotape, Sappington had confessed to stabbing Weaver to death, leaving Green's body in a car, and shooting Brown before dismembering his body and eating a small piece of his leg.&lt;ref name=APDraper /&gt;

'''Mehran Karimi Nasseri''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: مهران کریمی ناصری pronounced {{IPA-fa|mehˈrɒn kʲæriˈmi nɒseˈri|}}; born 1942), also known as '''Sir, Alfred Mehran''',&lt;ref name=Snopes&gt;{{cite web |accessdate = 2 September 2009 |url = http://www.snopes.com/travel/airline/airport.asp |title = Stranded at the Airport |work = [[Snopes]] |date = 2 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Iran]]ian [[refugee]] who lived in the departure lounge of Terminal One in [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] from 26 August 1988 until July 2006, when he was hospitalized for an unspecified ailment. His autobiography has been published as a book, ''The Terminal Man'', in 2004. His story was the inspiration for the 2004 [[Steven Spielberg]] film ''[[The Terminal]]''.

==Early life==
Nasseri was born in the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] settlement located in [[Masjed Soleiman]], Iran. His father was an Iranian doctor working for the company. Nasseri stated that his mother was a nurse from [[Scotland]] working in the same place.&lt;ref name=Berczeller /&gt; He arrived in the [[United Kingdom]] in September 1973, to take a three-year course in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] studies at the [[University of Bradford]].

== Life in Terminal 1 ==
[[File:Merhan Karimi Nasseri Walkway Look 2005-12-30 01.jpg|thumb|300px|Nasseri's residency site in Terminal 1 of [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]].]]
Nasseri claims he was expelled from Iran in 1977 for protests against the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]] and after a long battle, involving applications in several countries, was awarded refugee status by the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] in [[Belgium]]&lt;nowiki&gt;. This allegedly permitted residence in many other European countries. However, this claim has been disputed, with investigations showing that Nasseri was never expelled from Iran.&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref name=Berczeller&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/sep/06/features.features11 |title = The man who lost his past |date = 6 September 2004 |last = Berczeller |first = Paul |accessdate = 1 August 2008 |work= [[The Guardian]] |location = London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having claimed to have one British parent, although he has produced no evidence to support this claim, he decided to settle in the UK in 1986, but en route there in 1988, his papers were lost when his briefcase was allegedly stolen&lt;ref name=BBC_20080528&gt;{{cite web |accessdate = 20 August 2008 |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A33471100 |title = Mehran Karimi Nasseri - In Transit |work = [[h2g2]] |publisher = BBC |date = 28 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (others indicate that Nasseri actually mailed his documents to Brussels while onboard a ferry to Britain, lying about them being stolen).&lt;ref name="sundaytimes"&gt;{{cite book |publisher = Corgi Adult |isbn = 9780552152747 |title = The Terminal Man |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL7815505M/The_Terminal_Man |first = Alfred |last = Merhan |date = 2004 |id = 0552152749 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this setback, he boarded the plane for [[London]] but was promptly returned to France when he failed to present a passport to British immigration officials. He was initially arrested by the French, but then released as his entry to the airport was legal and he had no country of origin to be returned to; thus began his residency at Terminal 1.

His case was later taken on by French human rights lawyer Christian Bourget. In 1992, a French court ruled that, having entered the country legally, he could not be expelled from the airport, but it could not grant him permission to enter France.

Attempts were then made to have new documents issued from Belgium, but the authorities there would only do so if Nasseri presented himself in person. However, under Belgian law a refugee who voluntarily leaves a country that has accepted him cannot return. In 1995, the Belgian authorities granted permission for him to return, but only if he agreed to live there under supervision of a social worker. Nasseri refused this on the grounds of wanting to enter the UK as originally intended.&lt;ref name=BBC_20080528 /&gt;

Both France and Belgium offered Nasseri residency, but Nasseri refused to sign the papers as they listed him as being Iranian (he wanted it to be British) and did not show his preferred name, "Sir, Alfred Mehran".&lt;ref name=Snopes /&gt; His refusal to sign the documents that would give him his freedom was much to the frustration of his lawyer, Bourget.&lt;ref name="sundaytimes" /&gt; When contacted about Nasseri's situation, his family stated that they believed he was living the life he wanted.&lt;ref name=Berczeller /&gt;

In 2003 Spielberg's [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] production company paid US$250,000 to Nasseri for the rights to his story, but ultimately did not use his story in the subsequent film, ''[[The Terminal]]''.

Nasseri's stay at the airport ended in July 2006 when he was hospitalized and his sitting place dismantled. Towards the end of January 2007 he left the hospital and was looked after by the airport's branch of the [[French Red Cross]]; he was lodged for a few weeks in a hotel close to the airport. On 6 March 2007 he transferred to an [[Emmaus (charity)|Emmaus charity]] reception-centre in [[Paris]]'s [[20th arrondissement of Paris|20th arrondissement]]. Since 2008 he has continued to live in a Paris shelter.&lt;ref name=BBC_20080528 /&gt;

During his 18-year-long stay at Terminal 1 in the Charles de Gaulle Airport, Nasseri had his luggage at his side and spent his time reading, writing in his diary or studying economics.&lt;ref name="TSD"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1347/has-a-guy-been-stuck-in-the-paris-airport-since-1988-for-lack-of-the-right-papers |title = Has a guy been stuck in the Paris airport since 1988 for lack of the right papers? |last1 = Adams |first1 = Cecil |date = 20 August 1999 |website = [[The Straight Dope]] |publisher =  |access-date =  |quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He received food and newspapers from employees of the airport, visits from journalists eager to hear his story and letters of support.

== Autobiography ==
In 2004 Nasseri's autobiography, ''The Terminal Man'',&lt;ref name="sundaytimes" /&gt; was published.  It was co-written by Nasseri with British author Andrew Donkin and was reviewed in '' [[The Sunday Times]]'' as being "profoundly disturbing and brilliant".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/memoir-the-terminal-man-by-sir-alfred-mehran-sxhvrht3wzt |title = Memoir: The Terminal Man by Sir Alfred Mehran |last = Wavell |first = Stuart |work = The Sunday Times |location = London }}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Documentaries and fictionalizations ==

Nasseri's story provided the inspiration for the 1994 French film ''[[Tombés du ciel]]'', starring [[Jean Rochefort]], internationally released under the title ''Lost in Transit''. The [[short story]] "The Fifteen-Year Layover", written by Michael Paterniti and published in ''[[GQ]]'' and ''The Best American Non-Required Reading'', chronicles Nasseri's life. [[Alexis Kouros]] made a documentary about him, ''Waiting for Godot at De Gaulle'' (2000). [[Glen Luchford]] and Paul Berczeller made the ''Here to Where'' [[mockumentary]] (2001), also featuring Nasseri. Hamid Rahmanian and Melissa Hibbard made a documentary called ''Sir Alfred of Charles De Gaulle Airport'' (2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.fictionvillestudio.com/films/alfred/sir-alfred.html |title = Fictionville Studio promo website |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141106223419/http://fictionvillestudio.com/films/alfred/sir-alfred.html |archive-date = 6 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasseri was reportedly the inspiration behind the character Viktor Navorski, from the 2004 Steven Spielberg film ''[[The Terminal]]'';&lt;ref name=CSM062104&gt;{{cite news |first = Ethan |last = Gilsdorf |url = http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0621/p11s02-almo.html |title = Behind ''The Terminal'', a true story |work = The Christian Science Monitor |date = 21 June 2004 |access-date = 17 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, neither publicity materials, nor the [[DVD]] "special features" nor the film's website mentions Nasseri's situation as an inspiration for the film. Despite this, in September 2003, ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that [[Steven Spielberg]] had bought the rights to his life story as the basis for ''The Terminal''.&lt;ref name=NYT092103&gt;{{Cite web |last = Rose |first = Matthew |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/21/magazine/magazinespecial/MFMERHANT.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5007&amp;en=360b6f8f63635c6a&amp;ex=1379476800 |title = Waiting For Spielberg |work= [[The New York Times]] |date = 21 September 2003 |accessdate = 12 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' indicates that Spielberg's [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] production company paid US$250,000 to Nasseri for rights to his story and report that, as of 2004, he carried a poster advertising Spielberg's film draping his [[suitcase]] next to his bench. Nasseri was reportedly excited about ''The Terminal'', but it was unlikely that he would ever have had a chance to see it in cinemas.&lt;ref name="Berczeller"/&gt;

Nasseri's story was also the inspiration for the contemporary opera ''[[Flight (opera)|Flight]]'' by British composer [[Jonathan Dove]], which won the Helpmann Award at the [[Adelaide Festival Theatre]] in March 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.playbillarts.com/news/article/4995.html |first1 = Vivien  |last1 = Schweitzer |first2 = Matthew |last2 = Westphal |last-author-amp = yes |title = Australia's Helpmann Awards Name Winners |work = Playbill Arts |date = 2 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Noel William Hinners''' (December 25, 1935 – September 5, 2014) was an [[United States|American]] [[geologist]] and [[soil]] [[chemist]] who is primarily remembered for his work with [[NASA]] where he worked in a variety of scientific and administrative roles from 1963-1989, including two years as [[NASA Chief Scientist]]. In 1977 he was awarded the [[NASA Distinguished Service Medal]].

At NASA Hinners helped plan and execute the [[Apollo program]] and was also responsible for the successful launches of numerous scientific probes into space; achieving such notable objectives as the first retrieval of moon rocks, mapping the surface of Mars, and capturing the first photographic images of the birthplace of stars among other achievements. His later work at [[Lockheed Martin]] as vice president of Flight Systems from 1989-2002 remained closely linked with [[NASA]].&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

==Life and career==
Born in Brooklyn and raised in [[Chatham, New Jersey]], Hinners was one of eight children born to William and Hazel Hinners. His father was an insurance agent, and his mother a homemaker. He earned degrees from [[Rutgers University]] (Bachelor of Agricultural Science, 1958), [[California Institute of Technology]] (master's in Geology), and [[Princeton University]] (Ph.D in Geochemistry, 1963).&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

After graduating from Princeton, Hinners worked for [[Bellcomm]], a subsidiary of AT&amp;T that worked closely with [[NASA]]. With Bellcomm he spent the next nine years working on the science of the [[Apollo program]], including making many of the site selections for the Apollo missions. From 1972 to 1974 he served as NASA's director of Lunar Programs and from 1974 to 1979 he was NASA's associate administrator for Space Science.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

In 1979, Hinners left NASA to become the director of the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian's]] [[National Air and Space Museum]]. He left that post in 1982 to become director of the [[NASA Goddard Space Flight Center]] where he remained for almost 6 years. From 1987 to 1989 he served as [[NASA Chief Scientist]] and associate deputy administrator of NASA. He then became vice president of Flight System at [[Lockheed Martin]] where he remained until his retirement in 2002. His work at Lockheed Martin was still closely tied to NASA, including responsibilities for NASA's [[Mars Global Surveyor]], [[Mars Surveyor Program]], [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]], Stardust and Genesis Discovery missions, Space (Nuclear) Power Systems and Mission Operations for NASA/LM planetary missions.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

Hinners died of [[basal-cell carcinoma]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]], ''Obituary'', 15 September 2014, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; at the age of 78 in [[Littleton, Colorado]].&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/12/us/noel-w-hinners-voice-for-scientific-research-at-nasa-dies-at-78.html?ref=obituaries|title=Noel W.

In 1990 Hargitay produced the production of ''King''; a musical based on the life of [[Martin Luther King]].&lt;ref name="CassidyTimes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cassidy|first1=Suzanne|last2=Times|first2=Special to the New York|title=After Struggle, Musical on Dr. King Is Opening|work=The New York Times|page=11|date=23 April 1990|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/23/theater/after-struggle-musical-on-dr-king-is-opening.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After Hargitay sold Consulting Group Europe and spent 10 years in Jamaica to focus on his family and producing documentaries, Peter Hargitay re-entered the consulting field in 2002 when he formed ECN Ltd, which was involved in managing numerous high profile corporates and industrial crises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Hargitay|url=http://www.zoominfo.com/s/#!search/profile/person?personId=386760405&amp;targetid=profile|work=ZoomInfo|publisher=zoominfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prince William, Duke of Gloucester''' (24 July 1689&amp;nbsp;– 30 July 1700{{efn|All dates in this article are in the [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]] [[Julian calendar]] in use in Britain throughout Gloucester's life; however, years are assumed to start on 1 January rather than 25 March, which was the English New Year.}}) was the son of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Princess Anne]], later Queen of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] from 1702, and her husband, [[Prince George of Denmark]]. He was their only child to survive infancy. Styled [[Duke of Gloucester]], he was viewed by contemporaries as a Protestant champion because his birth seemed to cement the Protestant succession established in the "[[Glorious Revolution]]" that had deposed his Catholic grandfather [[James II]] the previous year.

Gloucester's mother was estranged from her brother-in-law and cousin, [[William III of England|William III]], and her sister, [[Mary II]], but supported links between them and her son. He grew close to his uncle William, who created him a [[Knight of the Garter]], and his aunt Mary, who frequently sent him presents. At his nursery in Campden House, [[Kensington]], he befriended his Welsh body-servant, Jenkin Lewis, whose memoir of the Duke is an important source for historians, and operated his own miniature army, called the "Horse Guards", which eventually comprised 90 boys.

Gloucester's precarious health was a constant source of worry to his mother. His death, in 1700 at the age of 11, precipitated a succession crisis as his mother was the only individual remaining in the Protestant line of succession established by the [[Bill of Rights 1689]]. The [[English Parliament]] did not want the throne to revert to a Catholic, and so passed the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which settled the throne of England on [[Electress Sophia of Hanover]], a cousin of King James II, and her Protestant heirs.

==Birth and health==

In late 1688, in what became known as the "[[Glorious Revolution]]", the [[Roman Catholic]] [[James II of England|King James]] of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] was deposed by his [[Protestant]] nephew and son-in-law, Dutch [[stadtholder]] [[William III of Orange]]. William and his wife, James's elder daughter [[Mary II of England|Mary]], were recognised by the [[Parliament of England|English]] and [[Parliament of Scotland|Scottish]] parliaments as king and queen. As they had no children, Mary's younger sister, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]], was designated their [[heir presumptive]] in England and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, pp. 63–69; Somerset, pp. 98–110&lt;/ref&gt; The accession of William and Mary and the succession through Anne were enshrined in the [[Bill of Rights 1689]].&lt;ref&gt;Somerset, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne was married to [[Prince George of Denmark]], and in their six years of marriage Anne had been pregnant six times, but none of her children had survived. Her seventh pregnancy resulted in the birth of a son at 5 a.m. on 24 July 1689 in [[Hampton Court Palace]]. As it was usual for the births of potential heirs to the throne to be attended by several witnesses, the King and Queen and "most of the persons of quality about the court" were present.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, p. 72; Somerset, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, the newborn baby was baptised William Henry after his uncle King William by [[Henry Compton (bishop)|Henry Compton]], [[Bishop of London]]. The King, who was one of the godparents along with the [[George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax#Family|Marchioness of Halifax]]&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Lord Chamberlain]], [[Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset|Lord Dorset]],&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; declared him [[Duke of Gloucester]],&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, p. 21; Green, p. 54; Gregg, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; although the peerage was never formally created.&lt;ref name=Gibbs&gt;Gibbs and Doubleday, p. 743&lt;/ref&gt; Gloucester was second in line to the throne after his mother, and because his birth secured the Protestant succession, he was the hope of the revolution's supporters.&lt;ref name=Chapman46&gt;Chapman, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; The ode ''The Noise of Foreign Wars'', attributed to [[Henry Purcell]], was written in celebration of the birth.&lt;ref&gt;White, Brian (Winter 2007). "Music for a 'brave livlylike boy': the Duke of Gloucester, Purcell and 'The noise of foreign wars'" ''The Musical Times'' '''148''' (1901): 75–83&lt;/ref&gt; Other congratulatory odes, such as Purcell's last royal ode ''Who Can From Joy Refrain?'' and [[John Blow]]'s ''The Duke of Gloucester's March'' and ''A Song upon the Duke of Gloucester'', were composed for his birthdays in later years.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, Olive; Wilson, Thelma (September 1981). "Who Can from Joy Refraine? Purcell's Birthday Song for the Duke of Gloucester" ''The Musical Times'' '''122''' (1663): 596–599&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGuinness, Rosamund (April 1965). "The Chronology of John Blow's Court Odes" ''Music and Letters'' '''46''' (2): 102–121&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of the revolution, supporters of James known as the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], spoke of Gloucester as "a sickly and doomed usurper".&lt;ref name=Chapman46/&gt;

Though described as a "brave livlylike {{sic}} boy",&lt;ref&gt;Letter from [[George Melville, 1st Earl of Melville|Lord Melville]] to the [[William Douglas-Hamilton, Duke of Hamilton|Duke of Hamilton]], 26 July 1689, quoted in Gregg, p. 76 and Waller, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; Gloucester became ill with [[convulsions]] when he was three weeks old, so his mother moved him into Craven House, Kensington, hoping that the air from the surrounding gravel pits would have a beneficial effect on his health.&lt;ref&gt;Waller, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; His convulsions were possibly symptomatic of [[meningitis]], likely contracted at birth and which resulted in [[hydrocephalus]].&lt;ref name="Somerset, p. 116"&gt;Somerset, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; As was usual among royalty, Gloucester was placed in the care of a governess, [[Barbara Berkeley, Viscountess Fitzhardinge|Lady Fitzhardinge]],&lt;ref name=Chapman49/&gt; and was suckled by a [[wet nurse]], [[Mrs. Pack]], rather than his mother.{{efn|Mrs Pack was said to be so ugly that she was "fitter to go to a pigsty than to a prince's bed".&lt;ref&gt;Somerset, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; She apparently failed to gain Gloucester's affection; on her death in 1694, he was asked by the Queen if he was sad at the news, to which he replied, "No, madam".&lt;ref name="Somerset 145"&gt;Somerset, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;}} As part of his treatment, Gloucester was driven outside every day in a small open carriage, pulled by [[Shetland pony|Shetland ponies]], to maximise his exposure to the air of the gravel pits.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; When the effectiveness of this treatment exceeded their expectations, Princess Anne and her husband acquired a permanent residence in the area, Campden House, a [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] mansion, in 1690.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt; It was here that Gloucester befriended Welsh body-servant Jenkin Lewis, whose memoir of his master is an important source for historians.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his life, Gloucester suffered from a recurrent "ague", which was treated with regular doses of [[Jesuit's bark]] (an early form of [[quinine]]) by his physician, [[John Radcliffe (physician)|John Radcliffe]]. Gloucester disliked the treatment intensely, and usually vomited after being given it.&lt;ref&gt;Green, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly as a result of hydrocephalus,&lt;ref name="Green55"&gt;Green, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Somerset, p. 116"/&gt; he had an enlarged head, which his surgeons pierced intermittently to draw off fluid.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, pp. 30–31; Curtis, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; He could not walk properly, and was apt to stumble.&lt;ref name="Green55" /&gt; Nearing the age of five, Gloucester refused to climb stairs without two attendants to hold him, which Lewis blamed on indulgent nurses who over-protected the boy. His father [[Birching|birched]] him until he agreed to walk by himself.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, pp. 57, 74–75&lt;/ref&gt; [[Corporal punishment]] was usual at the time, and such treatment would not have been considered harsh.&lt;ref&gt;Somerset, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[File:PrinceWilliamDukeOfGloucester.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait by Edmund Lilly of Prince William in the azure mantle of the [[Order of the Garter]], c. 1698.]]
Gloucester's [[language acquisition]] was delayed: he did not speak correctly until the age of three,&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, p. 100; Waller, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; and consequently the commencement of his education was postponed by a year.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; The Reverend Samuel Pratt, a [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] graduate, was appointed the Duke's tutor in 1693.&lt;ref name=Chapman49&gt;Chapman, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Lessons concentrated on geography, mathematics, Latin, and French.&lt;ref name="Somerset 145"/&gt; Pratt was an enemy of Jenkin Lewis, and they frequently disagreed over how Gloucester should be educated.&lt;ref name=Chapman49/&gt; Lewis remained Gloucester's favourite attendant because, unlike Pratt, he was knowledgeable in military matters and could therefore help him with his "Horse Guards",&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; a miniature army consisting of local children.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 141; Chapman, pp. 53, 59&lt;/ref&gt; Over a couple of years from 1693, the size of the army grew from 22 to over 90 boys.&lt;ref name=Kilburn&gt;{{Cite web|author=Kilburn, Matthew|year=2004|title=William, Prince, duke of Gloucester (1689–1700)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29454|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=8 October 2011|doi= 10.1093/ref:odnb/29454}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Princess Anne had fallen out with her sister and brother-in-law, William and Mary, and reluctantly agreed to the advice of her friend, the [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough|Countess of Marlborough]], that Gloucester should visit his aunt and uncle regularly to ensure their continued goodwill towards him.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, pp. 98–99&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to heal the rift, Anne invited the King and Queen to see Gloucester drill the "Horse Guards".&lt;ref&gt;Waller, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; After watching the boys' display at [[Kensington Palace]], the King praised them, and made a return visit to Campden House the following day.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Gloucester grew closer to his aunt and uncle: the Queen bought him presents from his favourite toy shop regularly.&lt;ref&gt;Waller, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; Her death in 1694 led to a superficial reconciliation between Anne and William, which occasioned a move to [[St James's Palace]], London.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, pp. 105–107&lt;/ref&gt; Gloucester having tired of him, Lewis only attended St James's every two months.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

On his seventh birthday, Gloucester attended a ceremony at [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]], to install him as a knight of the [[Order of the Garter]], an honour the King had given him six months before. Gloucester became ill during the celebratory banquet afterwards and left early, but after his recovery went [[deer hunting]] in [[Windsor Great Park]], where he was [[wiktionary:blood#Verb|blooded]] by [[Samuel Masham, 1st Baron Masham|Samuel Masham]], his father's [[Page (occupation)|page]].&lt;ref name=Green74&gt;Green, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; Princess Anne wrote to the Countess of Marlborough, "My boy continues yet very well, and looks better, I think, than ever he did in his life; I mean more healthy, for though I love him very well, I can't brag of his beauty."&lt;ref name=Green74/&gt;

[[File:King William and Prince William.jpg|thumb|left|King William III entrusting Prince William to Bishop Burnet, illustrated in [[John Cassell]]'s ''Illustrated History of England'']]
During the trial of [[Sir John Fenwick, 3rd Baronet|Sir John Fenwick]], who was implicated in [[Jacobite assassination plot 1696|a plot to assassinate King William]],&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, vol. I, p. 401&lt;/ref&gt; Gloucester signed a letter to the King promising his loyalty. "I, your Majesty's most dutiful subject," the letter read, "had rather lose my life in your Majesty's cause than in any man's else, and I hope it will not be long ere you conquer France."&lt;ref name=Churchill446&gt;Churchill, vol. I, p. 446&lt;/ref&gt; Added to the letter was a declaration by the boys in Gloucester's army: "We, your Majesty's subjects, will stand by you while we have a drop of blood."&lt;ref name=Churchill446/&gt;

In 1697, Parliament granted King William £50,000 to establish a household for the Duke of Gloucester, though the King only permitted the release of £15,000, keeping the difference for himself.&lt;ref name=Gregg114&gt;Gregg, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of Gloucester's own household in early 1698 revived the feud between Anne and William.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; William was determined to limit Anne's involvement in the household, and therefore appointed, against her wishes, the [[low church]] [[Gilbert Burnet]], [[Bishop of Salisbury]], as Gloucester's [[preceptor]].&lt;ref&gt;Green, p. 78; Gregg, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Anne was [[high church]],&lt;ref&gt;Somerset, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; and Burnet, knowing she was unhappy, attempted to decline the appointment, but the King insisted he accept it.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, p. 133; Green, p. 78; Gregg, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Anne's anger was only placated by an assurance from King William that she could choose all the lower servants of the household.&lt;ref name=Gregg115&gt;Gregg, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; The [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Earl of Marlborough]], a friend of Anne's, was appointed Gloucester's governor, after the [[Charles Talbot, 1st Duke of Shrewsbury|Duke of Shrewsbury]] declined the office on the grounds of ill health.&lt;ref name=Gregg114/&gt; Shortly before the King sailed for the Netherlands, he received Anne's choices from Marlborough but he refused to confirm them.&lt;ref name=Gregg115/&gt; His favourite, the [[Arnold van Keppel, 1st Earl of Albemarle|Earl of Albemarle]], eventually convinced him to agree to Anne's appointments, and the King's acceptance was sent from the Netherlands in September 1698.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; The Marlboroughs' twelve-year-old son, [[John Churchill, Marquess of Blandford|Lord Churchill]], was appointed Gloucester's [[Master of the Horse]], and became a friend and playmate.&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, vol. I, p. 433&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abigail Masham, Baroness Masham|Abigail Hill]], a kinswoman of the Countess of Marlborough, was appointed his laundress, and Abigail's brother, [[John Hill (courtier)|Jack Hill]], was made one of Gloucester's [[Gentleman of the Bedchamber|gentlemen of the bedchamber]].&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, vol. I, pp. 433–434&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William, Duke of Gloucester by Sir Godfrey Kneller, Bt.jpg|thumb|Portrait by [[Godfrey Kneller|Sir Godfrey Kneller]], c. 1698]]
Burnet lectured Gloucester for hours at a time on subjects such as the feudal constitutions of Europe and law before the time of Christianity.&lt;ref name=Chapman137&gt;Chapman, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Burnet also encouraged Gloucester to memorise facts and dates by heart.&lt;ref name=Chapman137/&gt; Government ministers inspected Gloucester's academic progress every four months, finding themselves "amazed" by his "wonderful memory and good judgement".&lt;ref name=Chapman137/&gt; His childhood troop was disbanded, and King William made him the honorary commander of a real regiment of Dutch footguards.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; In 1699, he attended the [[List of trials of peers in the House of Lords|trials in the House of Lords]] of [[Charles Mohun, 4th Baron Mohun|Lord Mohun]] and [[Edward Rich, 6th Earl of Warwick|Lord Warwick]], who were accused of murder.&lt;ref name=Kilburn/&gt; Mohun was acquitted; Warwick was found guilty of manslaughter but escaped punishment by pleading [[privilege of peerage]].&lt;ref&gt;Lovell, C. R. (October 1949). "The Trial of Peers in Great Britain" ''The American Historical Review'' '''55''': 69–81&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
As he neared his eleventh birthday, Gloucester was assigned the rooms in Kensington Palace that had been used by his aunt, Queen Mary, who died in 1694.&lt;ref name=Kilburn/&gt; At his birthday party at Windsor, on 24 July 1700, he complained of a sudden fatigue, but was initially thought to have overheated himself while dancing.&lt;ref name=Waller352&gt;Waller, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; By nightfall, he was suffering from a sore throat and chills, followed by a severe headache and a high fever the next day.&lt;ref name=Waller352/&gt;&lt;ref name=Somerset164&gt;Somerset, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; A physician, Hannes, did not arrive until 27 July. Gloucester was immediately [[Bloodletting|bled]], but his condition continued to deteriorate. Over the next day, he developed a rash and suffered a bout of diarrhoea. A second physician, Gibbons, arrived early on 28 July, followed by Radcliffe that evening.&lt;ref name=Somerset164/&gt;

The physicians could not agree on a diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Waller352/&gt; Radcliffe thought he had [[scarlet fever]], while others thought it was [[smallpox]].&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;Green, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; They administered "cordial powders and cordial juleps".&lt;ref name=Somerset164/&gt; Gloucester was bled, to which Radcliffe strongly objected. He told his colleagues, "you have destroyed him and you may finish him".&lt;ref name="Green" /&gt; He prescribed blistering, which was no more effective.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; In great pain, Gloucester passed the evening of 28 July "in great sighings and dejections of spirits&amp;nbsp;... towards morning, he complained very much of his blisters."&lt;ref name=Somerset164/&gt; Anne, who had spent an entire day and night by her son's bedside, now became so distressed that she fainted.&lt;ref name=Somerset164/&gt; However, by midday on 29 July, Gloucester was breathing more easily and his headache had diminished, leading to hopes that he would recover. The improvement was fleeting, and that evening, he was "taken with a convulsing sort of breathing, a defect in swallowing and a total deprivation of all sense".&lt;ref name=Somerset164/&gt; Prince William died close to 1 a.m. on 30 July 1700, with his parents beside him. In the end, the physicians decided the cause of death was "a malignant fever".&lt;ref name=Somerset164/&gt; An autopsy revealed severe swelling of the [[lymph nodes]] in the neck and an abnormal amount of fluid in the [[Ventricular system|ventricles]] of his brain:&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; "four and a half ounces of a limpid humour were taken out."&lt;ref name=Somerset164/&gt; A modern diagnosis is that Gloucester died of acute [[Streptococcal pharyngitis|bacterial pharyngitis]], with associated [[pneumonia]]. Had he lived, though, it is almost certain the prince would have succumbed to complications of his hydrocephalus.&lt;ref name=Somerset164/&gt;

King William, who was in the Netherlands, wrote to Marlborough, "It is so great a loss to me as well as to all England, that it pierces my heart."&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, p. 142; Churchill, vol. I, p. 447&lt;/ref&gt; Anne was prostrate with grief, taking to her chamber.&lt;ref name="Somerset 163"&gt;Somerset, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; In the evenings, she was carried into the garden "to divert her melancholy thoughts".&lt;ref name=Somerset164/&gt; Gloucester's body was moved from Windsor to Westminster on the night of 1 August, and he lay in state in the [[Palace of Westminster]] before being entombed in the Royal Vault of the [[Henry VII Chapel]] in [[Westminster Abbey]] on 9 August.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, pp. 143–144; Green, p. 80; Gregg, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; As was usual for royalty in mourning, his parents did not attend the funeral service, instead remaining in seclusion at Windsor.&lt;ref name="Somerset 163"/&gt;

In an allusion to Prince William's death, [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] politician [[William Shippen (MP)|William Shippen]] wrote:
:So by the course of the revolving spheres,
:Whene'er a new-discovered star appears,
:Astronomers, with pleasure and amaze,
:Upon the infant luminary gaze.
:They find their heaven's enlarged, and wait from thence
:Some blest, some more than common influence,
:But suddenly, alas! The fleeting light,
:Retiring, leaves their hopes involv'd in endless night.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, pp. 306–307&lt;/ref&gt;

Gloucester's death destabilised the succession, as his mother was the only person remaining in the Protestant line to the throne established by the [[Bill of Rights 1689]].&lt;ref name=Waller352/&gt; Although Anne had ten other pregnancies after the birth of Gloucester, none of them resulted in a child who survived more than briefly after birth.&lt;ref&gt;Green, p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; The English parliament did not want the throne to revert to a Catholic,&lt;ref&gt;Starkey, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; so it passed the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which settled the throne of England on a cousin of King James, [[Sophia of Hanover|Sophia, Electress of Hanover]], and her Protestant heirs.&lt;ref&gt;Starkey, pp. 215–216&lt;/ref&gt; Anne succeeded King William in 1702, and reigned until her death on 1 August 1714. Sophia predeceased her by a few weeks, and so Sophia's son [[George I of Great Britain|George]] ascended the throne as the first British monarch of the [[House of Hanover]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, pp. 384, 394–397&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ria Ramnarine''' (born October 12, 1978 in [[Carapichaima]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]]), is a professional [[boxing|boxer]] and the first female world boxing champion from that country. She made her boxing debut in [[Port of Spain]] on December 9, 1999, and won the WIBA Mini Flyweight World title on May 27, 2005 at the Jean Pierre Sports Complex in Port of Spain. On July 31, 2009, she won the interim WBA Female minimumweight title against Ana Fernández and was put "in recess" on August 20, 2009 due to an eye injury. A rematch was ordered due to the controversial decision as soon as Ria will be medically cleared.

She is 5 feet 2&amp;nbsp;inches tall and 110&amp;ndash;105&amp;nbsp;lbs, and is also active in [[Muay Thai]] events.

'''Rudolf Christoph Eucken''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɔʏkn̩|lang}}; 5 January 1846 – 15 September 1926) was a [[Germany|German]] [[philosopher]]. He received the 1908 [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] "in recognition of his earnest search for truth, his penetrating power of thought, his wide range of vision, and the warmth and strength in presentation with which in his numerous works he has vindicated and developed an idealistic philosophy of life", after he had been nominated by a member of the [[Swedish Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show.php?id=3471 nobelprize.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Eucken was born on 5 January 1846 in [[Aurich]], then in the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] (now [[Lower Saxony]]). His father, Ammo Becker Eucken (1792–1851) died when he was a child, and he was brought up by his mother, Ida Maria (1814–1872, née Gittermann).&lt;ref name="Bio2"/&gt; He was educated at Aurich, where one of his teachers was the classical philologist and philosopher Ludwig Wilhelm Maximilian Reuter (1803–1881).&lt;ref name=eb1911&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Eucken, Rudolf Christoph}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at [[Göttingen University]] (1863–66), where [[Hermann Lotze]] was one of his teachers, and [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin University]].&lt;ref name=Bio2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz19591.html|title=Biografie Rudolf Christoph Eucken (German)|publisher=Bayerische Nationalbibliothek|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter place, [[Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg]] was a professor whose ethical tendencies and historical treatment of philosophy greatly attracted him.

==Career==
Eucken received his [[Ph.D.]] in classical [[philology]] and ancient [[history]] at [[Göttingen University]] in 1866 with a dissertation under the title ''De Aristotelis dicendi ratione''.&lt;ref&gt;The dissertation is available [https://archive.org/details/dearistotelisdi00euckgoog online at Internet Archive].&lt;/ref&gt; However, the inclination of his mind was definitely towards the philosophical side of [[theology]].&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; In 1871, after five years working as a school teacher at [[Husum]], Berlin und [[Frankfurt]], he was appointed Professor of [[Philosophy]] at the [[University of Basel]], [[Switzerland]], succeeding another of his former teachers at Göttingen, [[Gustav Teichmüller]]. He stayed there until 1874 when he took up a similar position at the [[University of Jena]].&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; He stayed there until he retired in 1920. In 1912-13, Eucken spent half of the year as an exchange professor at Harvard University, and in 1913 he served as a Deem lecturer at [[New York University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L3Q7AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=rudolf+eucken+harvard+university&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8EUvlhqgGU&amp;sig=6ECFFeU4QB3DLpomwooKz8gNtRQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjYlN3giOvZAhVM7IMKHXDJCCMQ6AEISjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=rudolf%20eucken%20harvard%20university&amp;f=false|title=Harvard University Catalogue|last=University|first=Harvard|date=1912|publisher=The University.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1908/eucken-bio.html|title=Rudolf Eucken - Biographical|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War I]], Eucken, like many of his academic colleagues, took a strong line in favour of the causes with which his country had associated itself.&lt;ref name="Bio2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1922|wstitle=Eucken, Rudolf Christoph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethical activism&lt;!--'Ethical activism' and 'Activism (Eucken)' redirect here---&gt;==
Eucken's philosophical work is partly historical and partly constructive, the former side being predominant in his earlier, the latter in his later works. Their most striking feature is the close organic relationship between the two parts. The aim of the historical works is to show the necessary connexion between philosophical concepts and the age to which they belong; the same idea is at the root of his constructive speculation. All philosophy is [[philosophy of life]], the development of a new culture, not mere intellectualism, but the application of a vital religious inspiration to the practical problems of society. This practical idealism Eucken described by the term "'''ethical activism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;."&lt;ref name="Gibson"/&gt; In accordance with this principle, Eucken gave considerable attention to social and educational problems.&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt;

He maintained that humans have [[soul]]s, and that they are therefore at the junction between nature and spirit. He believed that people should overcome their non-spiritual nature by continuous efforts to achieve a [[spirituality|spiritual]] life, another aspect of his ethical activism and [[meaning of life]].

==Later life and death==
He married Irene Passow (1863–1941) in 1882 and had a daughter and two sons. His son [[Walter Eucken]] became a famous founder of [[Ordoliberalism|ordoliberal]] thought in [[Neoliberal economics|economics]]. His son [[Arnold Eucken]] was a chemist/physicist.&lt;ref name="Bio2"/&gt;

Rudolf Eucken died on 15 September 1926 in [[Jena]] at the age of 80.&lt;ref name="Bio2"/&gt;

'''Sam Houston''' (March 2, 1793{{spaced ndash}}July 26, 1863) was an American soldier and [[politician]]. An important leader of the [[Texas Revolution]], Houston served as the 1st and 3rd [[President of the Republic of Texas|president]] of the [[Republic of Texas]], and was one of the first two individuals to represent Texas in the [[United States Senate]]. He also served as the 6th [[Governor of Tennessee]] and the 7th [[governor of Texas]].

Born in [[Rockbridge County, Virginia]], Houston and his family migrated to [[Maryville, Tennessee]] when Houston was a teenager. Houston later ran away from home and spent time with the [[Cherokee]], becoming known as "Raven". He served under General [[Andrew Jackson]] in the [[War of 1812]], and after the war he presided over the [[Indian removal|removal]] of many Cherokee from Tennessee. With the support of Jackson and others, Houston won election to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1823. He strongly supported Jackson's presidential candidacies, and in 1827 Houston won election as the Governor of Tennessee. In 1829, after divorcing his first wife, Houston resigned from office, joined his Cherokee friends in [[Arkansas Territory]], and began a relationship with a Native American woman.&lt;ref&gt;"That D--d Brownlow", page 163. Steve Humphrey. Appalachian Consortium Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

Houston settled in Texas in 1832. After the [[Battle of Gonzales]], Houston helped organize Texas's provisional government and was selected as the top-ranking official in the [[Texian Army]]. He led the Texian Army to victory at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]], the decisive battle in Texas's war for independence against [[Mexico]]. After the war, Houston won election in the [[Republic of Texas presidential election, 1836|1836 Texas presidential election]]. He left office due to term limits in 1838, but won election to another term in the [[Republic of Texas presidential election, 1841|1841 Texas presidential election]]. Houston played a key role in the [[Texas annexation|annexation of Texas]] by the United States in 1845, and in 1846 he was elected to represent Texas in the United States Senate. He joined the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and supported President [[James K. Polk]]'s prosecution of the [[Mexican–American War]].

Houston's Senate record was marked by his unionism and opposition to extremists from both the North and South. He voted for the [[Compromise of 1850]], which settled many of the territorial issues left over from the Mexican–American War and the annexation of Texas. He later voted against the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]] because he believed it would lead to increased sectional tensions over slavery, and his opposition to that act led him to leave the Democratic Party. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the presidential nomination of the [[Know Nothing|American Party]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1856|1856 presidential election]] and the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860 presidential election]]. In 1859, Houston won election as the Governor of Texas. In that role, he opposed secession and unsuccessfully sought to keep Texas out of the [[Confederate States of America]]. He was forced out of office in 1861 and died in 1863. Houston's name has been honored in numerous ways, and he is the namesake of the city of [[Houston]], the [[List of United States cities by population|fourth most populous city in the United States]].

==Early life==
[[File:Houstonbirthplacemarker.jpg|thumbnail|left|Sam Houston Birthplace Marker in [[Rockbridge County, Virginia]]]]

Houston was born in [[Rockbridge County, Virginia]] on March 2, 1793, to Samuel Houston and Elizabeth Paxton. Both of Houston's parents were descended from [[British people|British]] and [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrants who had settled in [[British North America]] in the 1730s.&lt;ref name="williams1318" /&gt; Houston's father was descended from [[Ulster Scots people]]; he could trace his ancestry to [[Sir Hugh de Paduinan]], a [[Normans|Norman]] knight.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; By 1793, the elder Samuel Houston owned a large farm and a handful of [[slavery in the United States|slaves]], and served as a colonel in the Virginia militia.

Houston's uncle, the Presbyterian Rev. Samuel Houston, was an elected member of the "lost" [[State of Franklin]] then in the western frontier of [[North Carolina]], who advocated for the passage of his proposed "A Declaration of Rights or Form of Government on the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Frankland" at the convention that was assembled in [[Greeneville, Tennessee|Greeneville]] on November 14, 1785. Rev. Houston returned to Rockbridge County, Virginia after the assembled State of Franklin convention rejected his constitutional proposal.&lt;ref&gt;"Dr. J.G.M. Ramsey Autobiography and Letters", p. 317. Edited by Willaim B. Hesseltine. The University of Tennessee Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Houston had five brothers and three sisters, as well as dozens of cousins who lived in the surrounding area. According to biographer John Hoyt Williams, Houston was not close with his siblings or his parents, and he rarely spoke of them in his later life.&lt;ref name="williams1318"&gt;Williams (1994), pp. 13–18&lt;/ref&gt; Houston did take an interest in his father's library, however, reading works by [[Classical antiquity|classical]] authors like [[Virgil]], as well as more recent works by authors such as [[Jedidiah Morse]].&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt;

Houston's father was not a good manager and got into debt, in part because of his militia service.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; He planned to sell the farm and move west to Tennessee, where land was less expensive, but he died in 1806. Houston's mother followed through on those plans and settled the family near [[Maryville, Tennessee|Maryville]], the seat of [[Blount County, Tennessee]]. At that time, Tennessee was on the [[American frontier]], and even larger towns like [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] were vigilant against [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] raids. Houston disliked farming and working in the family store, and at the age of sixteen he left his family to live with a [[Cherokee]] tribe led by [[Ahuludegi]] (also spelled Oolooteka).&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1994), pp. 21–24&lt;/ref&gt; Houston formed a close relationship with Ahuludegi and learned the Cherokee language, becoming known as "Raven".&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1994), pp. 25–26&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Maryville in 1812, and he was hired at age 19 for a term as the schoolmaster of a one-room schoolhouse.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==War of 1812 and aftermath==
In 1813, Houston enlisted in the [[United States Army]], which was then engaged in the [[War of 1812]] against [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and Britain's Native American allies. He quickly impressed the commander of the [[39th Infantry Regiment (War of 1812)|39th Infantry Regiment]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (politician)|Thomas Hart Benton]], and by the end of 1813 Houston had risen to the rank of third lieutenant. In early 1814, the 39th Infantry Regiment became a part of the force commanded General [[Andrew Jackson]], who was charged with putting an end to raids by a faction of the [[Muscogee]] (or "Creek") tribe in the [[Old Southwest]].&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 11–14&lt;/ref&gt; Houston was badly wounded in the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]], the decisive battle in the [[Creek War]]. Although army doctors expected him to die of his wounds, Houston survived and convalesced in Maryville and other locations. While many other officers lost their positions after the end of the War of 1812 due to military cutbacks, Houston retained his commission with the help of Congressman [[John Rhea]].&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 15–17&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1817, Houston was assigned to a clerical position in Nashville, serving under the adjutant general for the army's Southern Division. Later in the year, Jackson appointed Houston as a sub-agent to handle the [[Indian removal|removal]] of Cherokee from East Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1818, he received a strong reprimand from [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[John C. Calhoun]] after he wore Native American dress to a meeting between Calhoun and Cherokee leaders, beginning an enmity that would last until Calhoun's death in 1850.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; Angry over the incident with Calhoun and an investigation into his activities, Houston resigned from the army in 1818. He continued to act as a government liaison with the Cherokee, and in 1818 he helped some of the Cherokee resettle in [[Arkansas Territory]].&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 26–29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early political career==
After leaving government service, Houston began an apprenticeship with Judge James Trimble in Nashville. He quickly won admission to the state bar and opened a legal practice in [[Lebanon, Tennessee]]. With the aid of Governor [[Joseph McMinn]], Houston won election as the solicitor general for Nashville in 1819. He was also appointed as the adjutant general of the Tennessee militia.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 31–33&lt;/ref&gt; Like his mentors, Houston was a member of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], which dominated state and national politics in the decade following the War of 1812.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Tennessee gained three seats in the [[United States House of Representatives]] after the [[1820 United States Census]], and, with the support of Jackson and McMinn, Houston ran unopposed in the 1823 election for [[Tennessee's 9th congressional district]].&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt; In his first major speech in Congress, Houston advocated for the recognition of [[Greece]], which was fighting a [[Greek War of Independence|war of independence]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt;

Houston strongly supported Jackson's candidacy in the [[United States presidential election, 1824|1824 presidential election]], which saw four major candidates, all from the Democratic-Republican Party, run for president. As no candidate won a majority of the vote, the House of Representatives held a [[contingent election]], which was won by [[John Quincy Adams]].&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 40–41&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of Jackson would eventually coalesce into the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], while those who favored Adams would become known as [[National Republican Party|National Republicans]]. With Jackson's backing, Houston won election as [[Governor of Tennessee]] in 1827.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt; Governor Houston advocated the construction of [[internal improvements]] such as canals, and sought to lower the price of land for homesteaders living on [[public domain]]. He also aided Jackson's successful campaign in the [[United States presidential election, 1828|1828 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 47–49&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1829, Houston married Eliza Allen, the daughter of wealthy plantation owner John Allen of [[Gallatin, Tennessee]]. The marriage quickly fell apart, possibly because Eliza loved another man.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 49–57&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1829, following the collapse of his marriage, Houston resigned as Governor of Tennessee. Shortly after leaving office, he traveled to Arkansas Territory to rejoin the Cherokee.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political exile and controversy==
Houston was reunited with Ahuludegi's group of Cherokee in mid-1829.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 64–65&lt;/ref&gt; Because of Houston's experience in government and his connections with President Jackson, several local Native American tribes asked Houston to mediate disputes and communicate their needs to the Jackson administration.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 68–69&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1829, the Cherokee accorded Houston tribal membership and dispatched him to Washington to negotiate several issues.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt; In anticipation of the removal of the remaining Cherokee east of the Mississippi River, Houston made an unsuccessful bid to supply rations to the Native Americans during their journey.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt; When Houston returned to Washington in 1832, Congressman [[William Stanbery]] alleged that Houston had placed a fraudulent bid in 1830 in collusion with the Jackson administration. After Stanbery refused to answer Houston's letters regarding the incident, Houston beat Stanbery with a cane.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 80–82&lt;/ref&gt; After the beating, the House of Representatives brought Houston to trial. By a vote of 106 to 89, the House convicted Houston, and Speaker of the House [[Andrew Stevenson]] formally reprimanded Houston. A federal court also required Houston to pay $500 in damages.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 82–86&lt;/ref&gt;

==Texas Revolution==
[[File:General Sam Houston, the hero of San Jacinto.jpg|thumb|General Sam Houston (postcard, circa 1905)]]

In mid-1832, Houston's friends, [[William H. Wharton]] and [[John Austin Wharton (1806–38)|John Austin Wharton]], wrote to convince him to travel to the [[Mexico|Mexican]] possession of [[Mexican Texas|Texas]], where unrest among the American settlers was growing.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 87–88&lt;/ref&gt; The Mexican government had invited Americans to settle the sparsely populated region of Texas, but many of the settlers, including the Whartons, disliked Mexican rule. Houston crossed into Texas in December 1832, and shortly thereafter he was granted land in Texas.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt; Houston was elected to represent [[Nacogdoches, Texas|Nacogdoches]] at the [[Convention of 1833]], which was called to petition Mexico for statehood (at the time, Texas was part of the state of [[Coahuila y Tejas]]). Houston strongly supported statehood, and he chaired a committee that drew up a proposed state constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 96–97&lt;/ref&gt; After the convention, Texan leader [[Stephen F. Austin]] petitioned the Mexican government for statehood, but he was unable to come to an agreement with [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Valentín Gómez Farías]]. In 1834, [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] assumed the presidency, took on new powers, and arrested Austin.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1835, the [[Texas Revolution]] broke out with the [[Battle of Gonzales]], a skirmish between Texan forces and the [[Mexican Army]]. Shortly after the battle, Houston was elected to the [[Consultation (Texas)|Consultation]], a congregation of Texas leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 109–113&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Austin and others, Houston helped organize the Consultation into a provisional government for Texas. In November, Houston joined with most other delegates in voting for a measure that demanded Texas statehood and the restoration of the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico]]. The Consultation appointed Houston as a [[Major General (United States)|major general]] and the highest-ranking officer of the [[Texian Army]], though the appointment did not give him effective control of the militia units that constituted the Texian Army.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 113–118&lt;/ref&gt; Houston helped organize the [[Convention of 1836]], where the [[Republic of Texas]] [[Texas Declaration of Independence|declared independence]] from Mexico. Shortly after the declaration, the convention received a plea for assistance from [[William B. Travis]], who commanded Texan forces [[Siege of the Alamo|under siege]] by Santa Anna at [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|the Alamo]]. The convention confirmed Houston's command of the Texian Army and dispatched him to lead a relief of Travis's force, but the Alamo fell before Houston could organize his forces at [[Gonzales, Texas]]. Seeking to intimidate Texan forces into surrender, the Mexican army killed every defender at the Alamo; news of the defeat outraged many Texans but also caused desertions in Houston's ranks.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 121–124&lt;/ref&gt; Commanding a force of about 350 men that was numerically inferior to that of Santa Anna, Houston retreated east across the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]].&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 125–128&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the provisional government, as well as many of his own subordinates, urged him to attack the Mexican army, Houston continued the [[Runaway Scrape|retreat east]], informing his soldiers that they constituted "the only army in Texas now present ... There are but a few of us, and if we are beaten, the fate of Texas is sealed."&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 128–129&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Another Texan force had been defeated at the [[Battle of Coleto]]; the Texans captured in that battle were subsequently [[Goliad massacre|massacred]] by order of Santa Anna.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;}} Santa Anna divided his forces and finally caught up to Houston in mid-April 1837.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 144–147, 158&lt;/ref&gt; Santa Anna's force of about 1350 soldiers trapped Houston's force of 783 men in a marsh; rather than pressing the attack, Santa Anna ordered his soldiers to make camp. On the April 21, Houston ordered an attack on the Mexican army, beginning the [[Battle of San Jacinto]]. The Texans quickly routed Santa Anna's force, though Houston's ankle was shattered by a stray bullet.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 147–151&lt;/ref&gt;  In the aftermath of the Battle of San Jacinto, a detachment of Texans captured Santa Anna.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 153–154&lt;/ref&gt; Santa Anna was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Velasco]], granting Texas its independence. Houston stayed on briefly for negotiations, then returned to the United States for treatment of his ankle wound.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==President of Texas==
[[File:Wpdms republic of texas.svg|thumb|upright=1|The Republic of Texas after the [[Texas Revolution]]]]

Victory in the Battle of San Jacinto made Houston a hero to many Texans, and he won the [[Republic of Texas presidential election, 1836|1836 Texas presidential election]], defeating Stephen F. Austin and former governor [[Henry Smith (Texas governor)|Henry Smith]]. Houston took office on October 22, 1836, after interim president [[David G. Burnet]] resigned.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 163–165&lt;/ref&gt; During the presidential election, the voters of Texas overwhelmingly indicated their desire for Texas to be annexed by the United States.  Houston, meanwhile, faced the challenge of assembling a new government, putting the country's finances in order, and handling relations with Mexico. He selected [[Thomas Jefferson Rusk]] as secretary of war, Smith as secretary of the treasury, [[Samuel Rhoads Fisher]] as secretary of the navy, [[James Collinsworth]] as attorney general, and Austin as secretary of state.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 166–169&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|After Austin died of an illness in December 1836, Houston ordered a month of mourning.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 175–176&lt;/ref&gt;}} Houston sought normalized relations with Mexico and, despite some resistance from the legislature, arranged the release of Santa Anna.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 171–172&lt;/ref&gt; Concerned about upsetting the balance between [[slave states and free states]], U.S. President Andrew Jackson refused to push for the annexation of Texas, but in his last official act in office he granted Texas [[diplomatic recognition]].&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 175, 190&lt;/ref&gt; With the United States unwilling to annex Texas, Houston began courting British support; as part of this effort, he urged the end of the importation of slaves into Texas.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 189–190&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SHouston 2.jpg|thumb|Sam Houston]]

In early 1837, the government moved to a new capital, [[Houston]], named for the country's first president.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; In 1838, Houston frequently clashed with Congress over issues such as a treaty with the Cherokee and a land-office act.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 201–202&lt;/ref&gt; The Texas constitution barred presidents from seeking a second term, so Houston did not stand for re-election in the [[Republic of Texas presidential election, 1838|1838 election]] and left office in late 1838. He was succeeded by [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]], who, along with Burnet, led a faction of Texas politicians opposed to Houston.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 205–206&lt;/ref&gt; The Lamar administration removed many of Houston's appointees, launched a [[Texas–Indian wars#Cherokee War: 1838–39|war against the Cherokee]], and established a new capital, [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 213–215&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Houston opened a legal practice and co-founded a land company with the intent of developing the town of [[Sabine Pass, Port Arthur, Texas|Sabine City]].&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 210–211&lt;/ref&gt; In 1839, he was elected to represent [[San Augustine County, Texas|San Augustine County]] in the Texas House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts (1993), pp. 23–25, 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Houston defeated Burnet in the [[Republic of Texas presidential election, 1841|1841 Texas presidential election]], winning a large majority of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 226–227&lt;/ref&gt; Houston appointed [[Anson Jones]] as secretary of state, [[Asa Brigham]] as secretary of the treasury, [[George Washington Hockley]] as secretary of war, and [[George Whitfield Terrell]] as attorney general.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 233–236&lt;/ref&gt; The republic faced a difficult financial situation; at one point, Houston commandeered an American brig used to transport Texas soldiers because the government could not afford to pay the brig's captain.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 245–246&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Texan Santa Fe Expedition|Santa Fe Expedition]] and other initiatives pursued by Lamar had stirred up tensions with Mexico, and rumors frequently raised fears that Santa Anna would launch an invasion of Texas.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 238–242&lt;/ref&gt; Houston continued to curry favor with Britain and [[France]], partly in the hope that British and French influence in Texas would encourage the United States to annex Texas.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 262–263&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Presidency of John Tyler|Tyler administration]] made the annexation of Texas its chief foreign policy priority, and in April 1844 Texas and the United States signed an annexation treaty. Annexation did not have sufficient support in Congress, and the [[United States Senate]] rejected the treaty in June.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 279–281, 286&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry Clay]] and [[Martin Van Buren]], the respective front-runners for the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] and Democratic nominations in the [[United States presidential election, 1844|1844 presidential election]], both opposed the annexation of Texas. However, Van Buren's opposition to annexation damaged his candidacy, and he was defeated by [[James K. Polk]], an acolyte of Jackson and an old friend of Houston's, at the [[1844 Democratic National Convention]]. Polk went on to defeat Clay in the general election, giving backers of annexation an [[Mandate (politics)|electoral mandate]]. Meanwhile, Houston's term ended in December 1844, and he was succeeded by his secretary of state, Anson Jones. In the waning days of his own presidency, Tyler used Polk's victory to convince Congress to approve of the [[annexation of Texas]]. Seeking Texas's immediate acceptance of annexation, Tyler made Texas a generous offer that allowed the state to retain control of its public lands, though it would also be required to keep its public debt.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 285–287&lt;/ref&gt; A Texas convention approved of the offer of annexation in July 1845, and Texas became a U.S. state in February 1846.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 293–294&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1846, shortly before Texas became a state, the Texas legislature elected Houston and Thomas Jefferson Rusk as Texas's two inaugural U.S. senators. Houston chose to align with the Democratic Party, which contained many of his old political allies, including President Polk.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 294–295&lt;/ref&gt; As a former President of Texas, Houston is the most recent former foreign head of state to serve in the U.S. Congress.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} He is the only individual to serve as the governor of a state and then be elected to the U.S. Senate by another state, though [[William Wyatt Bibb|William W. Bibb]] had previously accomplished the same feat in reverse order. In 2018, [[Mitt Romney]] became the second individual to serve as governor of one state and then win election to represent another state in the Senate.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://editions.lib.umn.edu/smartpolitics/2017/09/14/mitt-romney-prepares-for-unusual-us-senate-bid/|title=Mitt Romney Prepares for Unusual US Senate Bid {{!}} Smart Politics|website=editions.lib.umn.edu|language=en-CA|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breaking with the Senate tradition that held that freshman senators were not to address the Senate, in early 1846 Houston strongly advocated for the annexation of [[Oregon Country]]. In the [[Oregon Treaty]], which was reached later in 1846, Britain and the United States agreed to split Oregon Country.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Polk ordered General [[Zachary Taylor]] to lead a U.S. army to the [[Rio Grande River]], which had been set as the Texas-Mexico border under the Treaty of Velasco; Mexico claimed the [[Nueces River]] constituted the true border. After a skirmish between Taylor's unit and the Mexican army, the [[Mexican–American War]] broke out in April 1846. Houston initially supported Polk's prosecution of the war, but differences between the two men emerged in 1847.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 297–298&lt;/ref&gt; After two years of fighting, the United States defeated Mexico and, through the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], acquired the [[Mexican Cession]]. Mexico also agreed to recognize the Rio Grande River as the border between Mexico and Texas.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

After the war, disputes over the extension of slavery into the [[United States territory|territories]] raised sectional tensions. Unlike most of his Southern colleagues, Houston voted for the [[Oregon Bill of 1848]], which organized [[Oregon Territory]] as a free territory. Defending his vote to create a territory that excluded slavery, Houston stated, "I would be the last man to wish to do anything injurious to the South, but I do not think that on all occasions we are justified in agitating [slavery]."&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), p. 301&lt;/ref&gt; He criticized both Northern [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] and Democratic followers of Calhoun as extremists who sought to undermine the union.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 302–304&lt;/ref&gt; He supported the [[Compromise of 1850]], a sectional compromise on slavery on the territories. Under the compromise, California was admitted as a free state, the slave trade was prohibited in the District of Columbia, a more stringent [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|fugitive slave law]] was passed, and [[Utah Territory]] and [[New Mexico Territory]] were established. Texas gave up some of its claims on New Mexico, but it retained [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], and the United States assumed Texas's large public debt.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 304–308&lt;/ref&gt; Houston sought the Democratic nomination in the [[United States presidential election, 1852|1852 presidential election]], but he was unable to consolidate support outside of his home state. The [[1852 Democratic National Convention]] ultimately nominated a compromise nominee, [[Franklin Pierce]], who went on to win the election.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 311–313&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pierce and Buchanan administrations (1853–1859)===

[[File:Sam Houston c1856-59-crop.png|thumb|Houston in 1859]]

In 1854, Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]] led the passage of the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]], which organized [[Kansas Territory]] and [[Nebraska Territory]]. The act also repealed the [[Missouri Compromise]], an act that had banned slavery in territories north of parallel 36°30′ north. Houston voted against the act, in part because he believed that Native Americans would lose much of their land as a result of the act. He also perceived that it would lead to increased sectional tensions over slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 321–326&lt;/ref&gt; Houston's opposition to the Kansas–Nebraska Act led to his departure from the Democratic Party.&lt;ref&gt;Cantrell (1993), p. 333&lt;/ref&gt; In 1855, Houston began to be publicly associated with the American Party, the political wing of the [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] and unionist [[Know Nothing]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Cantrell (1993), pp. 328–330&lt;/ref&gt; The Whig Party had collapsed after the passage of the Kansas–Nebraska Act, and the Know Nothings and the anti-slavery [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] had both emerged as major political movements.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 340–341&lt;/ref&gt; Houston's affiliation with the party stemmed in part from his fear of the growing influence of [[Catholicism|Catholic]] voters; though he opposed barring Catholics from holding office, he wanted to extend the [[naturalization]] period for immigrants to twenty-one years.&lt;ref&gt;Cantrell (1993), pp. 330–333&lt;/ref&gt; He was also attracted to the Know Nothing's support for a Native American state, as well the party's unionist stance.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 341–342&lt;/ref&gt;

Houston sought the presidential nomination at the [[1856 American National Convention|Know Nothing party's 1856 national convention]], but the party nominated former President [[Millard Fillmore]]. Houston was disappointed by Fillmore's selection as well as the party platform, which did not rebuke the Kansas–Nebraska Act, but he eventually decided to support Fillmore's candidacy. Despite Houston's renewed support, the American Party split over slavery, and Democrat [[James Buchanan]] won the [[United States presidential election, 1856|1856 presidential election]]. The American Party collapsed after the election, and Houston did not affiliate with a national political party for the remainder of his Senate tenure.&lt;ref&gt;Cantrell (1993), pp. 340–342&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Texas gubernatorial election, 1857|1857 Texas gubernatorial election]], Texas Democrats nominated [[Hardin Richard Runnels]], who supported the Kansas–Nebraska Act and attacked Houston's record. In response, Houston announced his own candidacy for governor, but Runnels defeated him by a decisive margin.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 344, 352&lt;/ref&gt; After the gubernatorial election, the Texas legislature denied Houston re-election in the Senate; Houston rejected calls to resign immediately and served until the end of his term in early 1859.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 353, 360&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governor of Texas==
{{see also|Texas in the American Civil War}}
[[File:Sam Houston by Mathew Brady.jpg|thumb|Sam Houston in 1861.]]

Houston ran against Runnels in the [[Texas gubernatorial election, 1859|1859 gubernatorial election]]. Capitalizing on Runnels's unpopularity over state issues such as Native American raids, Houston won the election and took office in December 1859.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 362–365&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860 presidential election]], Houston and [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] were the two major contenders for the presidential nomination of the newly-formed [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]], which consisted largely of Southern unionists. Houston narrowly trailed Bell on the first ballot of the [[1860 Constitutional Union Convention]], but Bell clinched the nomination on the second ballot.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 371–372&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, some of Houston's Texan supporters nominated him for president in April 1860. Other backers attempted to launch a nationwide campaign, but in August 1860 Houston announced that he would not be a candidate for president. He refused to endorse any of the remaining presidential candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 372–374&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1860, Houston campaigned across his home state, calling on Texans to resist those who advocated for secession if Republican nominee [[Abraham Lincoln]] won the 1860 election.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 380–382&lt;/ref&gt;

After Lincoln won the November 1860 presidential election, several Southern states seceded from the United States and formed the [[Confederate States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 383–384&lt;/ref&gt; A Texas [[political convention|convention]] voted to secede from the United States on February 1, 1861, and Houston proclaimed that Texas was once again an independent republic, but he refused to recognize that same convention's authority to join Texas to the Confederacy. After Houston refused to swear an oath of loyalty to the Confederacy, the legislature declared the governorship vacant. Houston did not recognize the validity of his removal, but nor did he attempt to use force to remain in office, and he refused aid from the federal government to prevent his removal. His successor, [[Edward Clark (governor)|Edward Clark]], was sworn in on March 18.&lt;ref&gt;Westwood (1984), pp. 128–129, 133–134&lt;/ref&gt; In an undelivered speech, Houston wrote:

{{quote|Fellow-Citizens, in the name of your rights and liberties, which I believe have been trampled upon, I refuse to take this oath.  In the name of the nationality of Texas, which has been betrayed by the Convention, I refuse to take this oath.  In the name of the Constitution of Texas, I refuse to take this oath.  In the name of my own conscience and manhood, which this Convention would degrade by dragging me before it, to pander to the malice of my enemies, I refuse to take this oath.  I deny the power of this Convention to speak for Texas....I protest....against all the acts and doings of this convention and I declare them null and void.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 390–391.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On April 19, 1861, he told a crowd:

{{quote|Let me tell you what is coming.  After the sacrifice of countless millions of treasure and hundreds of thousands of lives, you may win Southern independence if God be not against you, but I doubt it.  I tell you that, while I believe with you in the doctrine of states rights, the North is determined to preserve this Union. They are not a fiery, impulsive people as you are, for they live in colder climates. But when they begin to move in a given direction, they move with the steady momentum and perseverance of a mighty [[avalanche]]; and what I fear is, they will overwhelm the South.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), p. 397&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Retirement and death==
[[File:Sam Houston Grave.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|Houston's grave in [[Huntsville, Texas]].]]

After leaving office, Houston returned to his home in Galveston.&lt;ref&gt;Westwood (1984), p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; He later settled in [[Huntsville, Texas]], where he lived in a structure known as the [[Steamboat House (Huntsville, Texas)|Steamboat House]]. In the midst of the Civil War, Houston was shunned by many Texas leaders, though he continued to correspond with Confederate officer [[Ashbel Smith]] and Texas governor [[Francis Lubbock]]. His son, Sam Houston, Jr., served in the Confederate army during the Civil War, but returned home after being wounded at the [[Battle of Shiloh]].&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 399–405&lt;/ref&gt; Houston's health suffered a precipitous decline in April 1863, and he died on July 26, 1863.&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 412–415&lt;/ref&gt;

The inscription on Houston's tomb reads:
&lt;poem&gt;
A Brave Soldier. A Fearless Statesman.
A Great Orator—A Pure Patriot.
A Faithful Friend, A Loyal Citizen.
A Devoted Husband and Father.
A Consistent Christian—An Honest Man.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Personal life ==
[[File:Margaret Lea Houston 1839.jpg|right|thumb|[[Margaret Lea Houston]]]]

Houston married Tiana Rogers (d. 1838), daughter of Chief John "Hellfire" Rogers (1740–1833), a Scots-Irish trader, and Jennie Due (1764–1806), a sister of Chief John Jolly, in a ceremony according to Cherokee customs. Tiana was in her mid-30s, of mixed-race, and a widow. She had two children from her previous marriage: Gabriel, born 1819, and Joanna, born 1822. She and Houston lived together for several years, though, under civil law, he was still legally married to Eliza Allen Houston.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} After declining to accompany Houston to Texas in 1832, Tiana later remarried. She died in 1838 of [[pneumonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 9, 1840, Houston, aged 47, married for a third time. His bride was 21-year-old [[Margaret Lea Houston|Margaret Moffette Lea]] of [[Marion, Alabama]], the daughter of planters. They had eight children. Margaret acted as a tempering influence on her much older husband and convinced him to stop drinking. Although the Houstons had numerous houses, they kept only one continuously: Cedar Point (1840–1863) on [[Trinity Bay (Texas)|Trinity Bay]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

In 1833, Houston was baptized into the Catholic faith in order to qualify under the existing Mexican law for property ownership in [[Coahuila y Tejas]]. The sacrament was held in the living room of the [[Adolphus Sterne House]] in [[Nacogdoches, Texas|Nacogdoches]].&lt;ref&gt;Haley (2002), pp. 104–105&lt;/ref&gt; By 1854, Margaret had spent 14 years trying to convert Houston to the [[Baptist church]]. With the assistance of [[George Washington Baines]], she convinced Houston to convert, and he agreed to adult baptism. Spectators from neighboring communities came to [[Independence, Texas]] to witness the event. On November 19, 1854, Houston was baptized by Rev. [[Rufus Columbus Burleson|Rufus C. Burleson]] by immersion in Little Rocky Creek, two miles southeast of Independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Augustin|first=Byron|title=Independence, Texas|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hli03|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=March 9, 2012|author2=Pitts, William L}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seale (1992) pp. 167–171&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[Houston, Texas|Houston]], the largest city in Texas, is named for Sam Houston. Several [[List of places named for Sam Houston|other things and places]] are also named for Houston, including [[Sam Houston State University]], [[Houston County, Minnesota]], [[Houston County, Tennessee]], and [[Houston County, Texas]]. Other [[List of monuments and memorials to Sam Houston|monuments and memorials]] include [[Sam Houston National Forest]], [[Sam Houston Regional Library and Research Center]], [[Fort Sam Houston]], the [[USS Sam Houston (SSBN-609)|USS ''Sam Houston'' (SSBN-609)]], and [[Sam Houston (sculpture)|a sculpture of Houston]] in the city of Houston's [[Hermann Park]]. Along with Stephen F. Austin, Houston is one of two Texans with a statue in the [[National Statuary Hall]]. Houston has been portrayed in works such as ''[[Man of Conquest]]'', ''[[Gone to Texas (film)|Gone to Texas]]'', ''[[Texas Rising]]'', and ''[[The Alamo (1960 film)|The Alamo]]''.

==Concept==

Spoofer McGraw is a young boy who, as his name implies, enjoys playing spoofs and pranks on others. He would tell lengthy and completely made up explanations to answer questions sent in by readers of the magazine. His [[sidekick]], Bo, was a young boy who played the [[straight man (stock character)|straight man]] to his outlandish comments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6913">==The Battle of Amalinde==
In October 1818, two AmaXhosa chiefs of the Rharhabe clan, namely: Chief Ngqika and his paternal uncle Chief Ndlambe, went to battle in Amalinde, the isiXhosa name for the Debe Hollows of Kommetjie, 19 kilometres west of [[King Williams Town]] &lt;ref&gt;South African Military History| http://samilitaryhistory.org/vol135hk.html&lt;/ref&gt;, in what is today part of [[East London, Eastern Cape]]. However, the exact site of the battle remains uncertain. Ngqika’s father, Mlawu, died when Ngqika was too young to rule and therefore his uncle Ndlambe, as per custom, became the regent. Under Ndlambe’s leadership, the chieftaincy grew in strength as he consolidated his power by absorbing smaller chiefdoms or expelling them to far afield lands. It was in 1795 when Ngqika had entered manhood that he soon demanded his rightful place as regent and leader of the AmaRharhabe. Ndlambe refused to relinquish power and because of this stalemate, a minor civil battle ensued. The two adversaries co-existed for almost two decades, in a state of immense tensions. 

[[File:INGRAM1891 pg056 East London.jpg|thumb|INGRAM1891 pg056 East London]]
The battle of Amalinde, which lasted from midday to nightfall was a result of this longstanding rivalry between the two chiefs, stemming from both personal and socio-political conflict&lt;ref&gt;South African Military History| http://samilitaryhistory.org/vol135hk.html&lt;/ref&gt;. On the personal, Ngqika fell deeply in love with Thuthula, the beautiful daughter of Dibi and wife of his uncle, Ndlambe. This is incestuous event was a remote but direct cause of the Battle of Amalinde. A more substantial cause of the battle was in 1817 when Ngqika met with Lord Charles Somerset, Governor of the Cape, and was forced to give up both the [[Great Fish River]] and [[Keiskamma River]].&lt;ref&gt;Couzens, T. (2004) ''Battles of South Africa''. Claremont. David Phillips Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;. The Amaxhosa felt aggrieved, that since Ngqika was not the paramount chief, he could not then authorise the alienation of the land. Ndlambe used this resentment of Ngqika by the people to exploit for his own selfish gains. 

===Ngqika’s strategy===
Most sources reveal that Ngqika and his men went forth towards the Debe, known in isiXhosa as ''indebe'' meaning pockmark. He followed a route that skirted the foothills of the Amathole region, the route that is today followed by the roads and railway. Having travelled for over 45 kilometres that morning, Ngqika and his men arrived only at noon. It is said that Ngqika watched the battle from the hillside, some believing that possibly even on the foothills of the Ntaba kaNdoda area that flanks the Debe River valley to the north &lt;ref&gt;Brownlee, C (1896). ''Reminiscences of Kaffir life and History''. Lovedale Mission Press&lt;/ref&gt;. Sources report that Ngqika himself was neither a great fighter nor military strategist&lt;ref&gt;Stapleton, T. J. (1994) Maqoma: ''Xhosa Resistance to Colonial Advance, 1798-1873''. Johannesburg. Jonathan Ball Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;. As such, he appointed his eldest son Maqoma, who had no actual battle experience, together with Jingqi, a renowned fighter, as lead forces in the battle against Ndlambe. In October 1818, Ngqika mobilised his warriors and sent for help from the British Cape Colony. Ngqika and his men sought advice from Ntsikana, the royal diviner and spiritual counsellor, in his quest to destroy the Ndlambe Great Place. Ntsikana first offered his visionary services to Ndlambe, who then rejected them since he was already served by [[Nxele]], prompting Ntsikana to find his spiritual home under the trusteeship of Ngqika. As with the other charismatic millenarian prophet Nxele, who was in service to Ndlambe, Ntsikana came under the influence of the missioner, [[Johannes van der Kemp]], stationed at [[Bethelsdorp]] near [[Port Elizabeth]].

===Ndlambe’s strategy===
Ndlambe had the advantage of distance and did, in fact, use it wisely. Having to travel a much shorter distance to the battle site as compared to Ngqika, Ndlambe’s great place was at Mount Coke, only 25 kilometres away from the Debe, it is probable that he selected an area which held the greater advantage for him and his men. For this, he and his men had to first cross a large area covered by the Amalinde, proving true that indeed it was the battle of Amalinde &lt;ref&gt;South African Military History| http://samilitaryhistory.org/vol135hk.html&lt;/ref&gt;). Ndlambe’s army was led by his son, Mdushane and further supported by the amaGcaleka nation who were led personally into the battlefield by their paramount, Chief Hintsa, who was his cousin.&lt;ref&gt;Buffalo City Tourism|http://www.bctourism.co.za/itemdetail.php?id=566&amp;category=15&lt;/ref&gt;. Another important figure in Ndlambe had in his camp was the other charismatic millenarian prophet &lt;ref&gt;Mostert, N. (1992) ''Frontiers: the Epic of South Africa's creation and the tragedy of the Xhosa people''. Alfred. A. Knopf. Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nxele, otherwise known as [[Makana]]. Proclaiming himself to be the son of God, Nxele offered to Ndlambe and his men a way of thinking which provided them with some exploration of and resistance to the pressures being exerted by the encroaching whites&lt;ref&gt;Couzens, T. (2004) ''Battles of South Africa''. Claremont. David Phillips Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;. Ndlambe also made use of Nxele’s growing influence in his power struggle with Ngqika. 

==The End of the Battle==
Wounded and facing defeat, Ngqika’s remaining army men, as led by his eldest son Maqoma, fled up to the slopes of Ntaba ka Ndoda. It is reported that over 500 &lt;ref&gt;South African Military History| http://www.bctourism.co.za/itemdetail.php?id=566&amp;category=15&lt;/ref&gt; men lost their lives on that fateful day in October 1818. As the sun went down on that same day, Mdushane’s men fueled huge bonfires with the lifeless bodies of Ngqika’s men, leaving behind very little of what used to be people. In the final analysis, there was no real victor between the amaNgqika and the amaNdlambe as the consequences for both were profound. Soon after the battle, Ngqika applied to the British for assistance and in December 1818, a military expedition under the leadership of Colonel Brereton set out to attack Ndlambe. Matters become extremely worse when Nxele attacked [[Grahamstown]], albeit unsuccessfully. The amaXhosa, in their entirety, lost access to the fertile tract of the country between the Keiskamma and Fish Rivers and soon the area was filled with colonial settlers. A once proud and independent people were inexorably placed under British control.

The '''War Childhood Museum''' ([[Bosnian language|Bosnian]]: ''Muzej ratnog djetinjstva'') is a historical museum in [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] that opened in January 2017. The museum presents the experiences of children who lived through the [[war in Bosnia]], told through objects, video testimonies, and excerpts from oral histories. The 2018 Council of Europe Museum Prize – one of the most prestigious awards in the museum industry – has been awarded to the War Childhood Museum as part of the European Museum of the Year Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Council of Europe Museum Prize 2018|url=https://europeanforum.museum/winners/council-europe/|accessdate=17 May 2018|work=European Museum Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=War Childhood Museum, Sarajevo, wins 2018 Museum Prize|url=http://www.assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/News/News-View-EN.asp?newsid=6891&amp;lang=2&amp;cat=|accessdate=17 May 2018|work=European Museum Forum|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project began in 2010 when Jasminko Halilovic, a Sarajevan entrepreneur, activist, and “war child,” used an online platform to collect short recollections of young adults who had been children during the Bosnian war. Over 1,000 young adults submitted their memories. Halilovic assembled these recollections into a book which was published in 2013. The book has subsequently been translated into German and Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sheehan|first1=Dan|title=Jasminko Halilovic: Children of War|url=https://www.guernicamag.com/children-of-war/|accessdate=5 February 2017|work=Guernica Magazine|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Halilovic began corresponding with the young adults who submitted memories, he realized that many of the former “war children” still had specific objects that they connected with their memories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Toe|first1=Rodolfo|title=Sarajevo Museum to Preserve Wartime Childhood Memories|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/bosnian-museum-preserves-war-childhood-memories-05-11-2016|work=Balkan Transitional Justice|agency=Balkan Insight|date=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began working with a team of other young professionals to develop a museum collection, eventually collecting over 3,000 objects and over 60 oral history testimonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rose|first1=Eleanor|title=Bosnia's War Childhood Museum Finally Opens|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/bosnia-s-war-childhood-museum-finally-opens-01-30-2017|accessdate=5 February 2017|work=Balkan Transitional Justice|agency=Balkan Insight|date=January 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Zosimades''' ({{lang-el|Ζωσιμάδες}}) or '''Zosimas brothers''' were 18th-19th century [[Greeks|Greek]] benefactors and merchants.

The Zosimades were six brothers:

*Ioannis Zosimas (1752–1771)
*[[:File:Anastasios Zosimas.JPG|Anastasios Zosimas]] (1754–1828)
*[[Nikolaos Zosimas]] (1758–1842)
*Theodosios Zosimas (1760–1793)
*[[Zois Zosimas]] (1764–1828)
*Michael Zosimas (1766–1809)

They were born in [[Ioannina]], a city that was under [[Ottoman Greece|Ottoman]] rule and a major center of the [[Greek Enlightenment]] that time. Their father was a local merchant, Panagis Zosimas. At 1875, Nikolaos, Theodosios and Michael started their trading activities in [[Livorno]], [[Italy]], while Ioannis, Anastasios and Zois ran their trade business in [[Nizhyn]] ([[Ukraine]]) and then in [[Moscow]]. Their trade network soon became profitable and they managed to make a fortune.

==Benefaction==
After Theodosis' death (1793), he wrote in his testament that they should financially support the education of their home city Ioannina. So they donated astronomical amounts of money for the establishment and function of various schools and public libraries. Another huge donation went for the ''National Library'', of [[Adamantios Korais]], one of the major contributors of the Greek Enlightenment movement. Apart from educational institutions, orphanages were also financed.  The Zosimades also subsidized the publication of several books.

At 1820, after Zois' death, they supported the establishment of a new school in their home place, which became known as [[Zosimaia School|Zosimaia]]. This institution would become the center of Greek education the following century in the region of [[Epirus]].

During the following outbreak of the [[Greek War of Independence]] (1821–1830) the remaining Zosimades became active members of the patriotic organization [[Philiki Etaireia]] and supported financially the struggle. Zosimades also completely financed the erection of the Monetary Museum of Athens, donating their personal collection of Ancient Greek and Roman currency, as well as the orphanage in [[Patmos]].
