'''Animere''' (sometimes ''Anyimere'' or ''Kunda'', the latter being a toponym) is a language spoken in [[Ghana]], in the Kecheibe and Kunda villages of the ''Benimbere'' people. It is most closely related to [[Akebu language|Kebu or Akebu]] of [[Togo]]. Both are [[Ghana Togo Mountain languages]] (GTM), classified as members of the Ka-Togo group by Heine (1968). Like most other GTM languages, Animere is a noun-class language.

Animere is an endangered language which is no longer being passed on to children; the speaker count is approximately 30 (Blench 2006).&lt;ref name=blench&gt;[http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/Niger-Congo/GTML%20Website/GTMLanguagetables/GTMLlocations.mht#_ftn1 Blench (2006)]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} notes that all 30 speakers are over 35 years old. A 2003 ''Ethnologue'' estimate of 700 probably counts all ethnic Benimbere.  Bodomo 1996:38 states that "Animere (...) is said to be dying out (only 250 speakers now)". Bodomo's figure probably derives from an older edition of the Ethnologue also cited by Sommer 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Already in 1965 [[Adele language|Adele]], another GTM language, was the dominant language among the younger generation in the Animere area, and only elderly people spoke Animere among themselves, leading Heine (1968) to expect that 'the language is going to be extinct in a few decades'.&lt;ref&gt;Heine (1968) says that only members of Nkwantá and Kontrô clans of the Benimbere speak (some) Animere; cf. Sommer 1992:308&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge of [[Twi language|Twi]], a dominant regional language, is also widespread among the Benimbere.

'''Antoine Thomson d'Abbadie d'Arrast''' (3 January 1810{{snd}}19 March 1897)&lt;ref name=EB /&gt; was an Irish-born French explorer, [[geographer]], [[ethnologist]], [[linguist]] and [[astronomer]] notable for his travels in [[Ethiopia]]&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Although referred to as Ethiopia here, the region that they traveled is more accurately defined as [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] or in today's geography northern Ethiopia and [[Eritrea]].&lt;/ref&gt; during the first half of the 19th century. He was the older brother of [[Arnaud Michel d'Abbadie]], with whom he travelled.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{harvnb|Thorne|1984|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
d'Arrast was born a British subject, in [[Dublin]], Ireland, from a partially [[Basque people|Basque]] noble family of the [[Provinces of France|French province]] of [[Soule]]. His father, Michel Abbadie, was born in [[Arrast-Larrebieu]] and his mother was Irish. His grandfather Jean-Pierre was an [[abbot]] and a [[Notary public|notary]] in Soule. The family moved to France in 1818 where the brothers received a careful scientific education.&lt;ref name=EB /&gt;{{refn|group=nb|The date of the move to France by the family is given as 1820 by some.&lt;ref name=ww /&gt;}} In 1827, Antoine received a bachelier (bachelor) degree in [[Toulouse]].&lt;ref name=ww&gt;{{harvnb|Debus|Calinger|Collins|Kennedy|1968|p=400}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1829, he began his education in Paris, where he studied law.&lt;ref name=ww /&gt;

He married Virginie Vincent de Saint-Bonnet on 21 February 1859,&lt;ref name=ww /&gt; and settled in [[Hendaye]] where he purchased 250[[Hectare|ha]] to build a castle, and became the mayor of the city from 1871 to 1875.

Abbadie was a knight of the [[Légion d’honneur|Legion of Honour]], which he received on 27 September 1850,&lt;ref name=ww /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. He died in 1897, and bequeathed the Abbadi domain and castle in Hendaye, yielding 40,000 francs a year, to the Academy of Sciences.{{sfn|Keltie|1911}}

== Science and explorations ==
In 1835 the [[French Academy]] sent Antoine on a scientific mission to Brazil, the results being published at a later date (1873)&lt;ref name=EB /&gt;{{refn|group=nb|The date of the trip to Brazil is stated as 1836 by some sources.&lt;ref name=ww /&gt;}} under the title of ''Observations relatives à la physique du globe faites au Brésil et en Éthiopie''. In 1837, the two brothers started for Ethiopia, landing at [[Massawa]] in February 1838.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; They journeyed throughout Ethiopia, travelling as far south as the [[Kingdom of Kaffa]], sometimes together and sometimes separately. In addition to his studies in the sciences, he delved into the political fray exerting influence in favour of France and the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] missionaries.&lt;ref name=ce&gt;{{harvnb|Shahan|1907}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Ethiopia they returned to France in 1848 with notes on the geography, geology, archaeology, and natural history of the region.{{sfn|Keltie|1911}}

Antoine became involved in various controversies relating both to his geographical results and his political intrigues. He was especially attacked by [[Charles Tilstone Beke]], who impugned his veracity, especially with reference to the journey to [[Kana, Ethiopia|Kana]]. But time and the investigations of subsequent explorers have shown that Abbadie was quite trustworthy as to his facts, though wrong in his contention—hotly contested by Beke—that the [[Blue Nile]] was the main stream. The topographical results of his explorations were published in Paris between 1860 and 1873&lt;ref name=EB /&gt; in ''Géodésie d'Éthiopie'', full of the most valuable information and illustrated by ten maps. Of the ''Géographie de l'Éthiopie'' (Paris, 1890)&lt;ref name=EB /&gt; only one volume was published. In ''Un Catalogue raisonné de manuscrits éthiopiens'' (Paris, 1859) is a description of 234 Ethiopian [[manuscript]]s collected by Antoine.&lt;ref name=EB /&gt; He also compiled various vocabularies, including a ''Dictionnaire de [[Amharic language|la langue amariñña]]'' (Paris, 1881), and prepared an edition of the ''[[Shepherd of Hermas]]'', with the Latin version, in 1860. He published numerous papers dealing with the geography of Ethiopia, Ethiopian coins and ancient inscriptions. Under the title of ''Reconnaissances magnétiques'' he published in 1890 an account of the [[magnetic]] observations &lt;ref name="Delpech" /&gt;made by him in the course of several journeys to the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Levant]]. The general account of the travels of the two brothers was published by Arnaud in 1868 under the title of ''Douze ans dans la Haute Ethiopie''.{{sfn|Keltie|1911}}

Antoine was responsible for streamlining techniques towards [[geodesy]], along with inventing a new [[theodolite]] for measuring angles.

==Abbadie, a Basque and bascophile==
Basque through his father, Abbadie developed a particular interest about the [[Basque Language]] after meeting the Prince [[Louis Lucien Bonaparte]] in London. He started his academic work on Basque in 1852.

A speaker of both [[Souletin]] and [[Lapurdian]], a resident of [[Lapurdi]], Abbadie considered himself a [[Basque people|Basque]] from [[Soule]]. The popularity of the [[motto]] [[Zazpiak Bat]] is attributed to Abbadie, coined in the framework of the ''[[Jocs Florals|Lore Jokoak]]'' Basque festivals, fostered by himself.

==The castle or château==
[[File:Chateau d Abbadie.jpg|thumb|400px|Domaine d'Abbadia in [[Hendaye]], designed by [[Viollet-le-Duc]]]]
Abbadie gave his castle home the name ''Abbadia'', which is the name still used in Basque. However, in French it is usually referred to as ''[[Château d'Abbadie|Chateau d'Abbadie]]'' or ''Domaine d'Abbadia'', and locally it is not unusual for it to be called ''le Chateau d'Antoine d'Abbadie''.

The château was built between 1864 and 1879 on a cliff by the Atlantic Ocean, and was designed by [[Viollet Le Duc]] in the [[Neo Gothic]] style, and is considered one of the most important examples of French Gothic Revival Architecture.&lt;ref name=Delpech&gt;{{harvnb|Delpech|2014|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is divided in three parts : the observatory and library, the chapel, and the living quarters.

Nowadays the château still belongs to the [[Académie des sciences|Academy of Science]] to which it was bequeathed in 1895 on condition of its producing a catalogue of half-a-million [[star]]s within fifty years' time,&lt;ref name=ce /&gt; with the work to be carried out by members of religious orders.&lt;ref name=ce/&gt;

The château was classified as a protected historical monument by France in 1984. Most of the château property now belongs to the [[Conservatoire du littoral|Coastal Protection Agency]], and is managed by the city of Hendaye.

Arabic is classified as a [[macrolanguage]] comprising [[varieties of Arabic|30 modern varieties]], including its standard form, [[Modern Standard Arabic]],&lt;ref name="www-01.sil.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Documentation for ISO 639 identifier: ara|url=http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=ara|access-date=20 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303211429/http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=ara#|archive-date=3 March 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is derived from [[Classical Arabic]].

As the modern written language, Modern Standard Arabic is widely taught in schools and universities, and is used to varying degrees in workplaces, government, and the media. The two formal varieties are grouped together as [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]] (''{{transl|ar|fuṣḥā}}''), which is the official language of 26 states and the [[liturgical language]] of [[Islam]]. Modern Standard Arabic largely follows the grammatical standards of Classical Arabic, and uses much of the same vocabulary. However, it has discarded some grammatical constructions and vocabulary that no longer have any counterpart in the spoken varieties, and has adopted certain new constructions and vocabulary from the spoken varieties. Much of the new vocabulary is used to denote concepts that have arisen in the [[post-classical era]], especially in modern times.

During the Middle Ages, Literary Arabic was a major vehicle of culture in Europe, especially in science, mathematics and philosophy. As a result, many European languages have also [[loanword|borrowed]] many words from it. Arabic influence, mainly in vocabulary, is seen in [[European languages]], mainly [[Arabic influence on the Spanish language|Spanish]] and to a lesser extent Portuguese, Galician, and Catalan, owing to both the proximity of Christian European and Muslim Arab civilizations and 800 years of Arabic culture and language in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], referred to in Arabic as ''{{transl|ar|[[al-Andalus]]}}''. [[Sicilian dialect|Sicilian]] has about 500 Arabic words as result of Sicily being progressively conquered by Arabs from North Africa, from the mid-9th to mid-10th centuries. Many of these words relate to agriculture and related activities (Hull and Ruffino). [[Balkan]] languages, including [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], have also acquired a significant number of Arabic words through contact with [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]].

Arabic has influenced many languages around the globe throughout its history. Some of the most influenced languages are [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], Spanish, [[Urdu language|Urdu]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Hindi]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Maldivian language|Maldivian]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], and [[Hausa language|Hausa]], and some languages in parts of Africa. Conversely, Arabic has borrowed words from other languages, including Greek and Persian in medieval times, and contemporary European languages such as English and [[French language|French]] in modern times.

Classical Arabic is the [[Sacred language|liturgical language]] of 1.8 billion Muslims, and Modern Standard Arabic is one of six [[official languages of the United Nations]].&lt;ref name="gordonconwell.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gordonconwell.edu/resources/documents/1IBMR2015.pdf|title=Christianity 2015: Religious Diversity and Personal Contact|date=January 2015|publisher=gordonconwell.edu|accessdate=2015-05-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525141543/http://www.gordonconwell.edu/resources/documents/1IBMR2015.pdf#|archive-date=25 May 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pewmuslim4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/the-future-of-the-global-muslim-population|title=Executive Summary|publisher=Pew Research Center|access-date=22 December 2011|work=Future of the Global Muslim Population|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805044735/http://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/the-future-of-the-global-muslim-population/#|archive-date=5 August 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all|date=2011-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://features.pewforum.org/muslim-population/?sort=Pop2030|title=Table: Muslim Population by Country|date=2011-01-27|publisher=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project|access-date=2014-05-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801220350/http://features.pewforum.org/muslim-population/?sort=Pop2030#|archive-date=1 August 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/sections/about-un/official-languages/|title=UN official languages|date=2014-11-18|publisher=un.org|access-date=18 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017035124/http://www.un.org/en/sections/about-un/official-languages/#|archive-date=17 October 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; All varieties of Arabic combined are spoken by perhaps as many as 422 million speakers (native and non-native) in the Arab world,&lt;ref name="World Arabic Language Day"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/events/prizes-and-celebrations/celebrations/international-days/world-arabic-language-day/ |title= World Arabic Language Day |work= UNESCO |date= 18 December 2014 |access-date= 12 February 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171027161442/http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/events/prizes-and-celebrations/celebrations/international-days/world-arabic-language-day/# |archive-date= 27 October 2017 |dead-url= no |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the fifth [[List of languages by number of native speakers|most spoken language in the world]].

==History==

=== Classification ===
{{Further|Classification of Arabic languages}}
Arabic is a [[Central Semitic languages|Central Semitic]] language, closely related to the [[Northwest Semitic languages]] ([[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]], and [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]]), the Ancient South Arabian languages, and various other Semitic languages of Arabia such as [[Dadanitic]]. The [[Semitic languages]] changed a great deal between [[Proto-Semitic]] and the establishment of the Central Semitic languages, particularly in grammar. Innovations of the Central Semitic languages—all maintained in Arabic—include:
# The conversion of the suffix-conjugated stative formation (''jalas-'') into a past tense.
# The conversion of the prefix-conjugated preterite-tense formation (''yajlis-'') into a present tense.
# The elimination of other prefix-conjugated mood/aspect forms (e.g., a present tense formed by doubling the middle root, a perfect formed by infixing a {{IPA|/t/}} after the first root consonant, probably a jussive formed by a stress shift) in favor of new moods formed by endings attached to the prefix-conjugation forms (e.g., ''-u'' for indicative, ''-a'' for subjunctive, no ending for jussive, ''-an'' or ''-anna'' for energetic).
# The development of an internal passive.
There are several features which Classical Arabic, the modern Arabic varieties, as well as the [[Safaitic]] and [[Hismaic (Old Arabic)|Hismaic]] inscriptions share which are unattested in any other Central Semitic language variety, including the [[Dadanitic]] and [[Taymanitic]] languages of the [[Hijaz|northern Hejaz]]. These features are evidence of common descent from a [[Proto-language|hypothetical ancestor]], [[Proto-Arabic]]. The following features can be reconstructed with confidence for Proto-Arabic:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6X29BwAAQBAJ|title=An Outline of the Grammar of the Safaitic Inscriptions|last=Al-Jallad|first=Ahmad|date=2015-03-27|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004289826|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# negative particles ''m'' *''mā''; ''lʾn'' *''lā-ʾan'' &gt; CAr ''lan''
# ''mafʿūl'' G-passive participle
# prepositions and adverbs ''f'', ''ʿn'', ''ʿnd'', ''ḥt'', ''ʿkdy''

=== Old Arabic ===
{{Main|Old Arabic}}
[[File:Arabian_Languages.png|thumb|Arabian languages]]
Arabia boasted a wide variety of Semitic languages in antiquity. In the southwest, various [[Central Semitic languages]] both belonging to and outside of the [[Old South Arabian|Ancient South Arabian]] family (e.g. Southern Thamudic) were spoken. It is also believed that the ancestors of the [[Modern South Arabian languages]] (non-Central Semitic languages) were also spoken in southern Arabia at this time. To the north, in the oases of northern [[Hejaz]], [[Dadanitic]] and [[Taymanitic]] held some prestige as inscriptional languages. In [[Najd]] and parts of western Arabia, a language known to scholars as Thamudic C is attested. In eastern Arabia, inscriptions in a script derived from ASA attest to a language known as [[Hasaitic dialect|Hasaitic]]. Finally, on the northwestern frontier of Arabia, various languages known to scholars as Thamudic B, Thamudic D, [[Safaitic]], and [[Hismaic]] are attested. The last two share important isoglosses with later forms of Arabic, leading scholars to theorize that Safaitic and Hismaic are in fact early forms of Arabic and that they should be considered [[Old Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/18470301|title=Al-Jallad. The earliest stages of Arabic and its linguistic classification (Routledge Handbook of Arabic Linguistics, forthcoming)|access-date=2016-07-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023221343/http://www.academia.edu/18470301/Al-Jallad._The_earliest_stages_of_Arabic_and_its_linguistic_classification_Routledge_Handbook_of_Arabic_Linguistics_forthcoming_#|archive-date=23 October 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all|last1=Al-Jallad|first1=Ahmad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1st century CE, fragments of Northern Old Arabic are attested in the [[Nabataean alphabet|Nabataean script]] across northern Arabia. By the 4th century CE, the Nabataean Aramaic writing system had come to express varieties of Arabic other than that of the Nabataeans.

===Old Hejazi and Classical Arabic===
{{Main|Old Hijazi|Classical Arabic}}
In late pre-Islamic times, a transdialectal and transcommunal variety of Arabic emerged in the [[Hejaz]] which continued living its parallel life after literary Arabic had been institutionally standardized in the 2nd and 3rd century of the [[Islamic calendar|Hijra]], most strongly in Judeo-Christian texts, keeping alive ancient features eliminated from the "learned" tradition (Classical Arabic).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopedia-of-arabic-language-and-linguistics/middle-arabic-EALL_COM_vol3_0213?s.num=0&amp;s.rows=20&amp;s.f.s2_parent=s.f.book.encyclopedia-of-arabic-language-and-linguistics&amp;s.q=middle+arabic|title=Middle Arabic - Brill Reference|journal=Encyclopedia of Arabic Language and Linguistics|access-date=2016-07-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815171843/http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopedia-of-arabic-language-and-linguistics/middle-arabic-EALL_COM_vol3_0213?s.num=0&amp;s.rows=20&amp;s.f.s2_parent=s.f.book.encyclopedia-of-arabic-language-and-linguistics&amp;s.q=middle+arabic#|archive-date=15 August 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all|date=2011-05-30|last1=Lentin|first1=Jérôme}}&lt;/ref&gt; This variety and both its classicizing and "lay" iterations have been termed Middle Arabic in the past, but they are thought to continue an [[Old Higazi]] register. It is clear that the orthography of the [[Quran|Qur'an]] was not developed for the standardized form of Classical Arabic; rather, it shows the attempt on the part of writers to record an archaic form of Old Higazi.

In the late 6th century AD, a relatively uniform intertribal "poetic koine" distinct from the [[Vernacular|spoken vernaculars]] developed based on the [[Bedouin]] dialects of [[Najd]], probably in connection with the court of [[Al-Hirah|al-Ḥīra]]. During the first Islamic century, the majority of Arabic poets and Arabic-writing persons spoke Arabic as their mother tongue. Their texts, although mainly preserved in far later manuscripts, contain traces of non-standardized [[Classical Arabic]] elements in morphology and syntax. The standardization of Classical Arabic reached completion around the end of the 8th century. The first comprehensive description of the ''ʿarabiyya'' "Arabic", [[Sibawayh|Sībawayhi's]] ''al''-''Kitāb'', is based first of all upon a corpus of poetic texts, in addition to Qur'an usage and Bedouin informants whom he considered to be reliable speakers of the ''ʿarabiyya''.&lt;ref name="referenceworks.brillonline.com" /&gt; By the 8th century, knowledge of Classical Arabic had become an essential prerequisite for rising into the higher classes throughout the Islamic world.

=== Neo-Arabic ===
Charles Ferguson's [[koiné language|koine]] theory (Ferguson 1959) claims that the modern Arabic dialects collectively descend from a single military koine that sprang up during the Islamic conquests; this view has been challenged in recent times. Ahmad al-Jallad proposes that there were at least two considerably distinct types of Arabic on the eve of the conquests: Northern and Central (Al-Jallad 2009). The modern dialects emerged from a new contact situation produced following the conquests. Instead of the emergence of a single or multiple koines, the dialects contain several sedimentary layers of borrowed and areal features, which they absorbed at different points in their linguistic histories.&lt;ref name="referenceworks.brillonline.com"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopedia-of-arabic-language-and-linguistics/polygenesis-in-the-arabic-dialects-EALL_SIM_000030?s.num=1&amp;s.f.s2_parent=s.f.book.encyclopedia-of-arabic-language-and-linguistics&amp;s.q=neo-arabic|title=Polygenesis in the Arabic Dialects - Brill Reference|journal=Encyclopedia of Arabic Language and Linguistics|access-date=2016-07-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815234348/http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopedia-of-arabic-language-and-linguistics/polygenesis-in-the-arabic-dialects-EALL_SIM_000030?s.num=1&amp;s.f.s2_parent=s.f.book.encyclopedia-of-arabic-language-and-linguistics&amp;s.q=neo-arabic#|archive-date=15 August 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all|date=2011-05-30|last1=Al-Jallad|first1=Ahmad}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Veersteegh and Bickerton, colloquial Arabic dialects arose from pidginized Arabic formed from contact between Arabs and conquered peoples. Pidginization and subsequent creolization among Arabs and [[Arabization|arabized]] peoples could explain relative morphological and phonological simplicity of vernacular Arabic compared to Classical and MSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=RiarBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA299&amp;lpg=PA299|title=The Arabic Language|last=Versteegh|first=Kees|date=2014-05-31|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=9780748645299|language=en|access-date=16 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181004103921/https://books.google.pl/books?id=RiarBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA299&amp;lpg=PA299#|archive-date=4 October 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=VM6M1351GWsC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;lpg=PA198|title=Diathesis in the Semitic Languages: A Comparative Morphological Study|last=Retsö|first=Jan|date=1989|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-9004088184|language=en|access-date=16 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181004104045/https://books.google.pl/books?id=VM6M1351GWsC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;lpg=PA198#|archive-date=4 October 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Arabic'' usually designates one of three main variants: [[Classical Arabic]], [[Modern Standard Arabic]] and [[Varieties of Arabic|''colloquial'' or ''dialectal'' Arabic]]. Classical Arabic is the language found in the [[Quran]], used from the period of [[Pre-Islamic Arabia]] to that of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. Theoretically, Classical Arabic is considered normative, according to the [[syntactic]] and grammatical norms laid down by classical grammarians (such as [[Sibawayh]]) and the vocabulary defined in classical dictionaries (such as the [[Ibn Manzur#Lis.C4.81n al-.CA.BFArab|Lisān al-ʻArab]]). In practice, however, modern authors almost never write in pure Classical Arabic, instead using a [[literary language]] with its own grammatical norms and vocabulary, commonly known as Modern Standard Arabic (MSA).

MSA is the variety used in most current, printed Arabic publications, spoken by some of the [[Arabic media]] across [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]], and understood by most educated Arabic speakers. "Literary Arabic" and "Standard Arabic" ({{rtl-lang|ar|فُصْحَى}} ''{{transl|ar|fuṣḥá}}'') are less strictly defined terms that may refer to Modern Standard Arabic or Classical Arabic.

Some of the differences between Classical Arabic (CA) and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) are as follows:
* Certain grammatical constructions of CA that have no counterpart in any modern dialect (e.g., the [[energetic mood]]) are almost never used in [[Modern Standard Arabic]].
* No modern spoken variety of Arabic has [[Grammatical case|case]] distinctions. As a result, MSA is generally composed without case distinctions in mind, and the proper cases are added after the fact, when necessary. Because most case endings are noted using final short vowels, which are normally left unwritten in the Arabic script, it is unnecessary to determine the proper case of most words. The practical result of this is that MSA, like English and [[Standard Chinese]], is written in a strongly determined word order and alternative orders that were used in CA for emphasis are rare. In addition, because of the lack of case marking in the spoken varieties, most speakers cannot consistently use the correct endings in extemporaneous speech. As a result, spoken MSA tends to drop or regularize the endings except when reading from a prepared text.
* The numeral system in CA is complex and heavily tied in with the case system. This system is never used in MSA, even in the most formal of circumstances; instead, a significantly simplified system is used, approximating the system of the conservative spoken varieties.

MSA uses much Classical vocabulary (e.g., ''{{transl|ar|ALA|dhahaba}}'' 'to go') that is not present in the spoken varieties, but deletes Classical words that sound obsolete in MSA. In addition, MSA has borrowed or coined a large number of terms for concepts that did not exist in Quranic times, and MSA continues to evolve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kaye|1991|p=?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some words have been borrowed from other languages—notice that transliteration mainly indicates spelling and not real pronunciation (e.g., {{rtl-lang|ar|فِلْم}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|film}}'' 'film' or {{rtl-lang|ar|ديمقراطية}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|dīmuqrāṭiyyah}}'' 'democracy').

However, the current preference is to avoid direct borrowings, preferring to either use [[loan translation]]s (e.g., {{rtl-lang|ar|فرع}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|farʻ}}'' 'branch', also used for the branch of a company or organization; {{rtl-lang|ar|جناح}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|janāḥ}}'' 'wing', is also used for the wing of an airplane, building, air force, etc.), or to coin new words using forms within existing [[Semitic root|roots]] ({{rtl-lang|ar|استماتة}} ''{{transl|ar|istimātah}}'' '[[apoptosis]]', using the root {{rtl-lang|ar|موت}} ''m/w/t'' 'death' put into the [[Arabic verbs#Form X|Xth form]], or {{rtl-lang|ar|جامعة}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|jāmiʻah}}'' 'university', based on {{rtl-lang|ar|جمع}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|jamaʻa}}'' 'to gather, unite'; {{rtl-lang|ar|جمهورية}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|jumhūriyyah}}'' 'republic', based on {{rtl-lang|ar|جمهور}} ''{{transl|ar|jumhūr}}'' 'multitude'). An earlier tendency was to redefine an older word although this has fallen into disuse (e.g., {{rtl-lang|ar|هاتف}} ''{{transl|ar|hātif}}'' 'telephone' &lt; 'invisible caller (in Sufism)'; {{rtl-lang|ar|جريدة}} ''{{transl|ar|jarīdah}}'' 'newspaper' &lt; 'palm-leaf stalk').

''Colloquial'' or ''dialectal'' Arabic refers to the many national or regional varieties which constitute the everyday spoken language and evolved from Classical Arabic. Colloquial Arabic has many regional variants; geographically distant varieties usually differ enough to be [[mutual intelligibility|mutually unintelligible]], and some linguists consider them distinct languages.&lt;ref&gt;"Arabic Language." Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2009. Retrieved on 29 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The varieties are typically unwritten. They are often used in informal spoken media, such as [[soap opera]]s and [[talk show]]s,&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;{{Citation |last=Jenkins |first=Orville Boyd |url=http://strategyleader.org/articles/arabicpercent.html |title=Population Analysis of the Arabic Languages |date=18 March 2000 |access-date=12 March 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318105008/http://strategyleader.org/articles/arabicpercent.html# |archive-date=18 March 2009 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as occasionally in certain forms of written media such as poetry and printed advertising.

The only variety of modern Arabic to have acquired official language status is [[Maltese language|Maltese]], which is spoken in (predominantly [[Catholic Church|Catholic]]) [[Malta]] and written with the [[Maltese alphabet|Latin script]]. It is descended from Classical Arabic through [[Siculo-Arabic]], but is not mutually intelligible with any other variety of Arabic. Most linguists list it as a separate language rather than as a dialect of Arabic.

Even during Muhammad's lifetime, there were dialects of spoken Arabic. Muhammad spoke in the dialect of [[Mecca]], in the western [[Arabian peninsula]], and it was in this dialect that the Quran was written down. However, the dialects of the eastern Arabian peninsula were considered the most prestigious at the time, so the language of the Quran was ultimately converted to follow the eastern [[phonology]]. It is this phonology that underlies the modern pronunciation of Classical Arabic. The phonological differences between these two dialects account for some of the complexities of Arabic writing, most notably the writing of the [[glottal stop]] or ''[[hamzah]]'' (which was preserved in the eastern dialects but lost in western speech) and the use of ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif maqṣūrah}}'' (representing a sound preserved in the western dialects but merged with ''{{transl|ar|ā}}'' in eastern speech).{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Language and dialect==
The sociolinguistic situation of Arabic in modern times provides a prime example of the linguistic phenomenon of [[diglossia]], which is the normal use of two separate varieties of the same language, usually in different social situations. In the case of Arabic, educated Arabs of any nationality can be assumed to speak both their school-taught Standard Arabic as well as their native, mutually unintelligible "dialects";&lt;ref&gt;Janet C.

Arabic speakers often improve their familiarity with other dialects via music or film.

The issue of whether Arabic is one language or many languages is politically charged, in the same way it is for the [[varieties of Chinese]], [[Hindi language|Hindi]] and [[Urdu language|Urdu]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Scots language|Scots]] and English, etc. In contrast to speakers of Hindi and Urdu who claim they cannot understand each other even when they can, speakers of the varieties of Arabic will claim they can all understand each other even when they cannot.&lt;ref&gt;Clive Holes, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8E0Rr1xY4TQC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;ei=6AGMU8HGD4ynyATW1YDYCw&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwCA Modern Arabic: Structures, Functions, and Varieties], pg. 3. [[Washington, D.C.]]: [[Georgetown University Press]], 2004. {{ISBN|978-1-58901-022-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of diglossia between spoken and written language is a significant complicating factor: A single written form, significantly different from any of the spoken varieties learned natively, unites a number of sometimes divergent spoken forms. For political reasons, Arabs mostly assert that they all speak a single language, despite significant issues of mutual incomprehensibility among differing spoken versions.&lt;ref&gt;Nizar Y. Habash,[https://books.google.com/books?id=kRIHCnC74BoC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;ei=9xGMU-rDBYajyASWhoDgAw&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwADgK Introduction to Arabic Natural Language Processing], pgs. 1–2. [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]]: Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers, 2010. {{ISBN|978-1-59829-795-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a linguistic standpoint, it is often said that the various spoken varieties of Arabic differ among each other collectively about as much as the [[Romance languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Bate, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8uP7LHS3cDMC&amp;pg=PT38&amp;ei=-AWMU_6OC8GjyAS4_oK4Bg&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ Tamil Oratory and the Dravidian Aesthetic: Democratic Practice in South India], pgs. 14–15. [[New York City|New York]]: [[Columbia University Press]], 2013. {{ISBN|978-0-231-51940-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an apt comparison in a number of ways. The period of divergence from a single spoken form is similar—perhaps 1500 years for Arabic, 2000 years for the Romance languages. Also, while it is comprehensible to people from the [[Maghreb]], a linguistically innovative variety such as [[Moroccan Arabic]] is essentially incomprehensible to Arabs from the [[Mashriq]], much as French is incomprehensible to Spanish or Italian speakers but relatively easily learned by them. This suggests that the spoken varieties may linguistically be considered separate languages.

== Influence of Arabic on other languages ==
{{See also|List of Arabic loanwords in English}}
The influence of Arabic has been most important in Islamic countries, because it is the language of the Islamic sacred book, the Quran. Arabic is also an important source of vocabulary for languages such as [[Amharic language|Amharic]], [[Baluchi language|Baluchi]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Berber languages|Berber]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic|Chaldean]], [[Chechen language|Chechen]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Dagestani language|Dagestani]], [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Hausa language|Hausa]], [[Hindi]], [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Kutchi Language|Kutchi]], [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]], [[Malay language|Malay]] ([[Malaysian language|Malaysian]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]), [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Rohingya language|Rohingya]], [[Romance languages]] ([[French language|French]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], etc.) [[Saraiki language|Saraiki]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Somali language|Somali]], [[Sylheti language|Sylheti]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]], [[Urdu]], [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]], [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], [[Visayan languages|Visayan]] and [[Wolof language|Wolof]], as well as other languages in countries where these languages are spoken.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} France has recently been emphasizing the learning and usage of Arabic in their classroom(s)/school(s). Arabic is considered to be a popular second-language choice in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/europe/2018/09/22/teaching-arabic-in-france|title=Teaching Arabic in France|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180925193050/https://www.economist.com/europe/2018/09/22/teaching-arabic-in-france#|archive-date=25 September 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, English has many Arabic loanwords, some directly, but most via other Mediterranean languages. Examples of such words include admiral, adobe, alchemy, alcohol, algebra, algorithm, alkaline, almanac, amber, arsenal, assassin, candy, carat, cipher, coffee, cotton, ghoul, hazard, jar, kismet, lemon, loofah, magazine, mattress, sherbet, sofa, sumac, tariff, and zenith.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Other languages such as Maltese&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=EB staff |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9050379/Maltese-language |title=Maltese language – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=4 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605045845/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9050379/Maltese-language# |archive-date=5 June 2008 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kinubi]] derive ultimately from Arabic, rather than merely borrowing vocabulary or grammatical rules.

Terms borrowed range from religious terminology (like Berber ''taẓallit'', "prayer", from ''[[salat]]'' ({{rtl-lang|ar|صلاة}} ''{{transl|ar|ṣalāh}}'')), academic terms (like [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] ''mentiq'', "logic"), and economic items (like English ''coffee'') to [[placeholder name|placeholders]] (like Spanish ''fulano'', "so-and-so"), everyday terms (like Hindustani ''lekin'', "but", or Spanish ''taza'' and French ''tasse'', meaning "cup"), and expressions (like Catalan ''a betzef'', "galore, in quantity"). Most Berber varieties (such as [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]]), along with Swahili, borrow some numbers from Arabic. Most Islamic religious terms are direct borrowings from Arabic, such as {{rtl-lang|ar|صلاة}} (''salat''), "prayer", and {{rtl-lang|ar|إمام}} (''imam''), "prayer leader."

In languages not directly in contact with the Arab world, Arabic loanwords are often transferred indirectly via other languages rather than being transferred directly from Arabic. For example, most Arabic loanwords in Hindustani and Turkish entered through Persian though Persian is an [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian language]]. Older Arabic loanwords in Hausa were borrowed from [[Kanuri language|Kanuri]].

Arabic words also made their way into several West African languages as Islam spread across the Sahara. Variants of Arabic words such as {{rtl-lang|ar|كتاب}} ''kitāb'' ("book") have spread to the languages of African groups who had no direct contact with Arab traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Gregersen|1977|p=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since throughout the Islamic world, Arabic occupied a position similar to that of Latin in Europe, many of the Arabic concepts in the fields of science, philosophy, commerce, etc. were coined from Arabic roots by non-native Arabic speakers, notably by Aramaic and Persian translators, and then found their way into other languages. This process of using Arabic roots, especially in Kurdish and Persian, to translate foreign concepts continued through to the 18th and 19th centuries, when swaths of Arab-inhabited lands were under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]].

==Influence of other languages on Arabic==
The most important sources of borrowings into (pre-Islamic) Arabic are from the related (Semitic) languages [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]],&lt;ref&gt;See the seminal study by Siegmund Fraenkel, ''Die aramäischen Fremdwörter im Arabischen'', Leiden 1886 (repr. 1962)&lt;/ref&gt; which used to be the principal, international language of communication throughout the ancient Near and Middle East, [[Ge'ez language|Ethiopic]], and to a lesser degree Hebrew (mainly religious concepts). In addition, many cultural, religious and political terms have entered Arabic from [[Iranian languages]], notably [[Middle Persian]], [[Parthian language|Parthian]], and (Classical) Persian,&lt;ref&gt;See for instance Wilhelm Eilers, "Iranisches Lehngut im Arabischen", ''Actas IV. Congresso des Estudos Árabes et Islâmicos, Coimbra, Lisboa'', Leiden 1971, with earlier references.&lt;/ref&gt; and Hellenistic Greek (''kīmiyāʼ'' has as origin the Greek ''khymia'', meaning in that language the melting of metals; see [[Roger Dachez]], ''Histoire de la Médecine de l'Antiquité au XXe siècle'', Tallandier, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;251), ''alembic'' (distiller) from ''ambix'' (cup), ''almanac'' (climate) from ''almenichiakon'' (calendar). (For the origin of the last three borrowed words, see Alfred-Louis de Prémare, ''Foundations of Islam'', Seuil, L'Univers Historique, 2002.) Some Arabic borrowings from Semitic or Persian languages are, as presented in De Prémare's above-cited book:
* ''madīnah''/[[medina]] (مدينة, city or city square), a word of Aramaic or Hebrew origin מדינה (in which it means "a state");
* ''jazīrah'' (جزيرة), as in the well-known form الجزيرة "Al-Jazeera," means "island" and has its origin in the Syriac ܓܙܝܪܗ ''gazīra''.
* ''lāzaward'' (لازورد) is taken from Persian لاژورد ''lājvard'', the name of a blue stone, lapis lazuli. This word was borrowed in several European languages to mean (light) blue - azure in English, ''azur'' in French and ''azul'' in Portuguese and Spanish.

==Arabic alphabet and nationalism==
There have been many instances of national movements to convert Arabic script into Latin script or to Romanize the language. Currently, the only language derived from [[Classical Arabic]] to use Latin script is [[Maltese language|Maltese]].

===Lebanon===
The Beirut newspaper ''La Syrie'' pushed for the change from Arabic script to Latin letters in 1922. The major head of this movement was [[Louis Massignon]], a French Orientalist, who brought his concern before the Arabic Language Academy in Damacus in 1928. Massignon's attempt at Romanization failed as the Academy and population viewed the proposal as an attempt from the Western world to take over their country. [[Sa'id al-Afghani|Sa'id Afghani]], a member of the Academy, mentioned that the movement to Romanize the script was a [[Zionism|Zionist]] plan to dominate Lebanon.&lt;ref name="shrivtiel179"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shrivtiel|first=Shraybom|title=The Question of Romanisation of the Script and The Emergence of Nationalism in the Middle East|date=1998|publisher=Mediterranean Language Review|pages=179–196}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shirvtiel188"&gt;Shrivtiel, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===
After the period of colonialism in Egypt, Egyptians were looking for a way to reclaim and re-emphasize Egyptian culture. As a result, some Egyptians pushed for an Egyptianization of the Arabic language in which the formal Arabic and the colloquial Arabic would be combined into one language and the Latin alphabet would be used.&lt;ref name="shrivtiel179" /&gt;&lt;ref name="shirvtiel188" /&gt; There was also the idea of finding a way to use [[Hieroglyphics]] instead of the Latin alphabet, but this was seen as too complicated to use.&lt;ref name="shrivtiel179" /&gt;&lt;ref name="shirvtiel188" /&gt; A scholar, [[Salama Musa]] agreed with the idea of applying a Latin alphabet to Arabic, as he believed that would allow Egypt to have a closer relationship with the West. He also believed that Latin script was key to the success of Egypt as it would allow for more advances in science and technology. This change in alphabet, he believed, would solve the problems inherent with Arabic, such as a lack of written vowels and difficulties writing foreign words that made it difficult for non-native speakers to learn.&lt;ref name="shrivtiel179" /&gt;&lt;ref name="shirvtiel188" /&gt; Ahmad Lutfi As Sayid and Muhammad Azmi, two Egyptian intellectuals, agreed with Musa and supported the push for Romanization.&lt;ref name="shrivtiel179" /&gt;&lt;ref name="shrivtiel189"&gt;Shrivtiel, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that Romanization was necessary for modernization and growth in Egypt continued with Abd Al-Aziz Fahmi in 1944. He was the chairman for the Writing and Grammar Committee for the Arabic Language Academy of Cairo.&lt;ref name="shrivtiel179" /&gt;&lt;ref name="shrivtiel189" /&gt; However, this effort failed as the Egyptian people felt a strong cultural tie to the Arabic alphabet.&lt;ref name="shrivtiel179" /&gt;&lt;ref name="shrivtiel189" /&gt;  In particular, the older Egyptian generations believed that the Arabic alphabet had strong connections to Arab values and history, due to the long history of the Arabic alphabet (Shrivtiel, 189) in Muslim societies.

==The language of the Quran and its influence on poetry==
The [[Quran]] introduced a new way of writing to the world. People began studying and applying the unique styles they learned from the Quran to not only their own writing, but also their [[culture]]. Writers studied the unique [[structure]] and [[Text formatting|format]] of the Quran in order to identify and apply the figurative devices and their impact on the reader.

=== Quran's figurative devices ===
The Quran inspired musicality in poetry through the internal rhythm of the verses. The arrangement of words, how certain sounds create harmony, and the agreement of rhymes create the sense of rhythm within each verse. At times, the chapters of the Quran only have the rhythm in common.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nicholson|first1=Reynold|title=A Literary History of the arabs|publisher=The Syndics of the Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The repetition in the Quran introduced the true power and impact repetition can have in poetry. The repetition of certain words and phrases made them appear more firm and explicit in the Quran. The Quran uses constant metaphors of blindness and deafness to imply unbelief. Metaphors were not a new concept to poetry, however the strength of extended metaphors was. The explicit imagery in the Quran inspired many poets to include and focus on the feature in their own work. The poet [[Abdallah ibn al-Mu'tazz|ibn al Mu'tazz]]  wrote a book regarding the figures of speech inspired by his study of the Quran. Poets such as badr Shakir al sayyab expresses his political opinion in his work through imagery inspired by the forms of more harsher imagery used in the Quran.&lt;ref name="Allen" /&gt;
The Quran uses figurative devices in order to express the meaning in the most beautiful form possible. The study of the pauses in the Quran as well as other rhetoric allow it to be approached in a multiple ways.&lt;ref name="Adonis" /&gt;

===Structure===
Although the Quran is known for its [[fluency]] and [[harmony]], the structure can be best described as chaotic. The [[suras]] also known as chapters of the Quran are not placed in chronological order. The only constant in their structure is that the longest are placed first and shorter ones follow. The topics discussed in the chapter often have no relation to each other and only share their sense of [[rhyme]]. The Quran introduces to poetry the idea of abandoning order and scattering narratives throughout the text. Harmony is also present in the sound of the Quran. The elongations and accents present in the Quran create a harmonious flow within the writing. Unique sound of the Quran recited, due to the [[Diacritic|accents]], create a deeper level of understanding through a deeper emotional connection.&lt;ref name="Allen" /&gt;

The Quran is written in a language that is simple and understandable by people. The simplicity of the writing inspired later poets to write in a more clear and clear-cut style.&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=Roger|title=An introduction to Arabic literature|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=978-0521776578|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The words of the Quran, although unchanged, are to this day understandable and frequently used in both formal and informal Arabic. The simplicity of the language makes memorizing and reciting the Quran a slightly easier task.

===Culture and the Quran===
The writer [[I'jaz|al-Khattabi]] explains how [[culture]] is a required element to create a sense of art in work as well as understand it. He believes that [[fluency]] and [[harmony]] the Quran possess are not the only elements that make it beautiful and create a bond between the reader and the text. 
While a lot of poetry was deemed comparable to the Quran in that it is equal to or better than the composition of the Quran, a debate rose that such statements are not possible because humans are incapable of composing work comparable to the Quran.&lt;ref name="Adonis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cobham|first1=Adonis ; translated from the Arabic by Catherine|title=An introduction to Arab poetics|date=1990|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin|isbn=978-0-292-73859-1|edition=1st University of Texas Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because the structure of the Quran made it difficult for a clear timeline to be seen, [[Hadith]] were the main source of chronological order. The Hadith were passed down from generation to generation and this tradition became a large resource for understanding the context. Poetry after the Quran began possessing this element of [[tradition]] by including ambiguity and background information to be required to understand the meaning.&lt;ref name="Nicholson" /&gt;

After the Quran came down to the people, the tradition of memorizing the [[Verse (poetry)|verses]] became present. It is believed that the greater the amount of the Quran memorized, the greater the faith. As technology improved over time, hearing [[recitation]]s of Quran became more available as well as more tools to help memorize the verses. 
The tradition of Love Poetry served as a symbolic representation of a Muslim's desire for a closer contact with their Lord.

While the influence of the Quran on Arabic poetry is explained and defended by numerous writers, some writers such as [[Al-Baqillani|Al- Baqillani]] believe that poetry and the Quran are in no conceivable way related due to the [[uniqueness]] of the Quran. Poetry's imperfections prove his points that they cannot be compared with the fluency the Quran holds.

=== Arabic and Islam ===
Classical Arabic is the language of poetry and literature (including news); it is also mainly the language of the [[Quran]]. Classical Arabic is closely associated with the religion of [[Islam]] because the Quran was written in it. Most of the world's [[Muslims]] do not speak Classical Arabic as their native language, but many can read the Quranic script and recite the Quran. Among non-Arab Muslims, translations of the Quran are most often accompanied by the original text. At present, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is also used in modernized versions of literary forms of the Quran.

Some Muslims present a [[Proto-Human language|monogenesis]] of languages and claim that the Arabic language was the language revealed by God for the benefit of mankind and the original language as a prototype system of symbolic communication, based upon its system of triconsonantal roots, spoken by man from which all other languages were derived, having first been corrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alislam.org/topics/arabic/ |title=Arabic – the mother of all languages – Al Islam Online |publisher=Alislam.org |date= |accessdate=4 May 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100430215148/http://www.alislam.org/topics/arabic/| archivedate= 30 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="meforum"&gt;{{cite web|last=Coffman|first=James|url=http://www.meforum.org/article/276|title=Does the Arabic Language Encourage Radical Islam?|accessdate=5 December 2008|publisher=Middle East Quarterly|date=December 1995|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201142003/http://www.meforum.org/article/276#|archive-date=1 February 2009|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judaism]] has a similar account with the [[Tower of Babel]].

== Dialects and descendants ==
{{Main|Varieties of Arabic}}
[[File:Arabic Dialects.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|Different dialects of Arabic]]
''Colloquial Arabic'' is a collective term for the spoken dialects of Arabic used throughout the [[Arab world]], which differ radically from the literary language. The main dialectal division is between the varieties within and outside of the Arabian peninsula, followed by that between [[Varieties of Arabic#Sedentary vs. Bedouin|sedentary]] varieties and the much more conservative [[Bedouin]] varieties. All of the varieties outside of the Arabian peninsula (which include the large majority of speakers) have a large number of features in common with each other that are not found in Classical Arabic. This has led researchers to postulate the existence of a prestige koine dialect in the one or two centuries immediately following the Arab conquest, whose features eventually spread to all of the newly conquered areas. (These features are present to varying degrees inside the Arabian peninsula. Generally, the Arabian peninsula varieties have much more diversity than the non-peninsula varieties, but have been understudied.)

Within the non-peninsula varieties, the largest difference is between the non-Egyptian [[Maghrebi Arabic|North African dialects]] (especially Moroccan Arabic) and the others. Moroccan Arabic in particular is hardly comprehensible to Arabic speakers east of [[Libya]] (although the converse is not true, in part due to the popularity of Egyptian films and other media).

One factor in the differentiation of the dialects is influence from the languages previously spoken in the areas, which have typically provided a significant number of new words and have sometimes also influenced pronunciation or word order; however, a much more significant factor for most dialects is, as among Romance languages, retention (or change of meaning) of different classical forms. Thus Iraqi ''aku'', Levantine ''fīh'' and North African ''kayən'' all mean 'there is', and all come from Classical Arabic forms (''yakūn'', ''fīhi'', ''kā'in'' respectively), but now sound very different.

===Examples===
Transcription is a [[broad transcription|broad IPA transcription]], so minor differences were ignored for easier comparison. Also, the [[Arabic phonology|pronunciation]] of [[Modern Standard Arabic]] differs significantly from region to region.

=== Koine ===
According to [[Charles A. Ferguson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Charles|last=Ferguson|title=The Arabic Koine|journal=Language|volume=35|year=1959|pages=616–630|issue=4|doi=10.2307/410601|jstor=410601}}&lt;/ref&gt; the following are some of the characteristic features of the [[Koiné language|koine]] that underlies all of the modern dialects outside the Arabian peninsula. Although many other features are common to most or all of these varieties, Ferguson believes that these features in particular are unlikely to have evolved independently more than once or twice and together suggest the existence of the koine:
* Loss of the [[dual (grammatical number)|dual number]] except on nouns, with consistent plural agreement (cf. feminine singular agreement in plural inanimates).
* Change of ''a'' to ''i'' in many affixes (e.g., non-past-tense prefixes ''ti- yi- ni-''; ''wi-'' 'and'; ''il-'' 'the'; feminine ''-it'' in the [[construct state]]).
* Loss of third-weak verbs ending in ''w'' (which merge with verbs ending in ''y'').
* Reformation of geminate verbs, e.g., ''{{transl|ar|ḥalaltu}}'' 'I untied' → ''{{transl|ar|ḥalēt(u)}}''.
* Conversion of separate words ''lī'' 'to me', ''laka'' 'to you', etc. into indirect-object [[clitic]] suffixes.
* Certain changes in the [[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]] system, e.g., ''{{transl|ar|khamsat ayyām}}'' 'five days' → ''{{transl|ar|kham(a)s tiyyām}}'', where certain words have a special plural with prefixed ''t''.
* Loss of the feminine [[elative (gradation)|elative]] (comparative).
* Adjective plurals of the form ''{{transl|ar|kibār}}'' 'big' → ''{{transl|ar|kubār}}''.
* Change of [[Arabic grammar#Nisba|nisba]] suffix ''{{transl|ar|-iyy}}'' &gt; ''{{transl|ar|i}}''.
* Certain lexical items, e.g., ''{{transl|ar|jāb}}'' 'bring' &lt; ''{{transl|ar|jāʼa bi-}}'' 'come with'; ''{{transl|ar|shāf}}'' 'see'; ''{{transl|ar|ēsh}}'' 'what' (or similar) &lt; ''{{transl|ar|ayyu shayʼ}}'' 'which thing'; ''{{transl|ar|illi}}'' (relative pronoun).
* Merger of {{IPA|/ɮˤ/}} and {{IPA|/ðˤ/}}.

=== Dialect groups ===
* [[Egyptian Arabic]]  is spoken by around 53 million people in [[Egypt]] (55 million worldwide).&lt;ref name="EA"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/arz | title=Arabic, Egyptian Spoken | publisher=[[Ethnologue]] | year=2006 | edition=18th | access-date=28 January 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225013906/http://www.ethnologue.com/language/arz# | archive-date=25 February 2015 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most understood varieties of Arabic, due in large part to the widespread distribution of Egyptian films and television shows throughout the Arabic-speaking world
* [[Levantine Arabic]] includes [[North Levantine Arabic]], [[South Levantine Arabic]] and [[Cypriot Arabic]]. It is spoken by about 21 million people in [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Israel]], [[Cyprus]] and [[Turkey]].
** [[Lebanese Arabic]] is a [[Varieties of Arabic|variety]] of [[Levantine Arabic]] spoken primarily in [[Lebanon]].
** [[Jordanian Arabic]] is a continuum of mutually intelligible varieties of [[Levantine Arabic]] spoken by the population of the [[Jordan|Kingdom of Jordan]].

** [[Samaritan alphabet|Samaritan Arabic]], spoken by only several hundred in the [[Nablus]] region
** [[Cypriot Maronite Arabic]], spoken in [[Cyprus]]
* [[Maghrebi Arabic]], also called "Darija" spoken by about 70 million people in [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]] and Libya. It also forms the basis of [[Maltese language|Maltese]], which is not part of the Arabic [[macrolanguage]]&lt;ref name="www-01.sil.org"/&gt; but is descended from the extinct [[Siculo-Arabic|Sicilian Arabic]] dialect which had Maghrebi origin.&lt;ref name="Borg, Albert J. 1997"&gt;Borg, Albert J.; Azzopardi-Alexander, Marie (1997). Maltese. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-02243-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maghrebi Arabic]] is very hard to understand for Arabic speakers from the Mashriq or Mesopotamia, the easiest being Libyan Arabic and the hardest Moroccan Arabic.  The others such as Algerian Arabic can be considered "in between".
** [[Libyan Arabic]] spoken in [[Libya]] and neighboring countries.
** [[Tunisian Arabic]] spoken in [[Tunisia]] and North-eastern [[Algeria]]

** [[Andalusian Arabic]], spoken in [[Spain]] until the 16th century.
** [[Siculo-Arabic]] ([[Sicilian Arabic]]), was spoken in [[Sicily]] and [[Malta]] between the end of the ninth century and the end of the twelfth century and eventually evolved into the [[Maltese language]].
*** [[Maltese language|Maltese]], spoken on the island of Malta, is the only fully separate standardized language to have originated from an Arabic dialect (the extinct [[Siculo-Arabic]] dialect), with independent literary norms. It has its own [[List of ISO 639-1 codes|language code]] that is distinct from that used for the Arabic macrolanguage.  Maltese has evolved independently of [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]] and its varieties into a standardized language over the past 800 years in a gradual process of Latinisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Borg and Azzopardi-Alexander, 1997|title=Maltese|date=1997| publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-0-415-02243-9|page=xiii|quote=In fact, Maltese displays some areal traits typical of Maghrebine Arabic, although over the past 800 years of independent evolution it has drifted apart from Tunisian Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book|author1=Brincat, 2005|title=Maltese - an unusual formula|quote=Originally Maltese was an Arabic dialect but it was immediately exposed to Latinisation because the Normans conquered the islands in 1090, while Christianisation, which was complete by 1250, cut off the dialect from contact with Classical Arabic.

== Phonology ==
{{Main|Arabic phonology}}

=== History ===
Of the 29 Proto-Semitic consonants, only one has been lost: {{IPA|*/ʒ/}}, which merged with {{IPA|/ʃ/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lipinski|1997|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the consonant {{IPA|*/ʒ/}} is still found in many colloquial Arabic dialects. Various other consonants have changed their sound too, but have remained distinct. An original {{IPA|*/p/}} lenited to {{IPA|/f/}}, and {{IPA|*/ɡ/}} - consistently attested in pre-Islamic Greek transcription of Arabic languages&lt;ref&gt;Al-Jallad, 42&lt;/ref&gt; - became palatalized to {{IPA|/ɡʲ/}} or {{IPA|/ɟ/}} by the time of the Quran and {{IPAslink|d͡ʒ}}, {{IPAslink|ɡ}}, {{IPAslink|ʒ}} or {{IPA|/ɟ/}} after [[early Muslim conquests]] and in MSA (see [[Arabic phonology#Local variations]] for more detail).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Watson|2002|pp=5, 15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An original [[voiceless alveolar lateral fricative]] {{IPA|*/ɬ/}} became {{IPA|/ʃ/}}.&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Watson|2002|p=2"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Watson|2002|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[emphatic consonant|emphatic]] counterpart {{IPA|/ɬˠ~ɮˤ/}} was considered by Arabs to be the most unusual sound in Arabic (Hence the Classical Arabic's appellation {{rtl-lang|ar|لُغَةُ ٱلضَّادِ}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|lughat al-ḍād}}'' or "language of the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ḍād}}''"); for most modern dialects, it has become an emphatic stop {{IPA|/dˤ/}} with loss of the laterality&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Watson|2002|p=2" /&gt; or with complete loss of any pharyngealization or velarization, {{IPA|/d/}}. (The classical ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ḍād}}'' pronunciation of [[pharyngealization]] {{IPA|/ɮˤ/}} still occurs in the [[Mehri language]] and the similar sound without velarization, {{IPAslink|ɮ}}, exists in other [[Modern South Arabian languages]].)

Other changes may also have happened. Classical Arabic pronunciation is not thoroughly recorded and different [[comparative method (linguistics)|reconstructions]] of the sound system of Proto-Semitic propose different phonetic values. One example is the emphatic consonants, which are pharyngealized in modern pronunciations but may have been velarized in the eighth century and glottalized in Proto-Semitic.&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Watson|2002|p=2" /&gt;

Reduction of {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/w/}} between vowels occurs in a number of circumstances and is responsible for much of the complexity of third-weak ("defective") verbs. Early Akkadian transcriptions of Arabic names shows that this reduction had not yet occurred as of the early part of the 1st millennium BC.

The Classical Arabic language as recorded was a poetic [[koine]] that reflected a consciously archaizing dialect, chosen based on the tribes of the western part of the [[Arabian Peninsula]], who spoke the most conservative variants of Arabic. Even at the time of Muhammed and before, other dialects existed with many more changes, including the loss of most glottal stops, the loss of case endings, the reduction of the diphthongs {{IPA|/aj/}} and {{IPA|/aw/}} into monophthongs {{IPA|/eː, oː/}}, etc. Most of these changes are present in most or all modern varieties of Arabic.

An interesting feature of the writing system of the Quran (and hence of Classical Arabic) is that it contains certain features of Muhammad's native dialect of Mecca, corrected through diacritics into the forms of standard Classical Arabic. Among these features visible under the corrections are the loss of the glottal stop and a differing development of the reduction of certain final sequences containing {{IPA|/j/}}: Evidently, final {{IPA|/-awa/}} became {{IPA|/aː/}} as in the Classical language, but final {{IPA|/-aja/}} became a different sound, possibly {{IPA|/eː/}} (rather than again {{IPA|/aː/}} in the Classical language). This is the apparent source of the ''alif maqṣūrah'' 'restricted alif' where a final {{IPA|/-aja/}} is reconstructed: a letter that would normally indicate {{IPA|/j/}} or some similar high-vowel sound, but is taken in this context to be a logical variant of ''alif'' and represent the sound {{IPA|/aː/}}.

Although Classical Arabic was a unitary language and is now used in Quran, its pronunciation varies somewhat from country to country and from region to region within a country. It is influenced by [[varieties of Arabic#Phonetics|colloquial dialects]].

=== Literary Arabic ===
The "colloquial" spoken dialects of Arabic are learned at home and constitute the native languages of Arabic speakers. "Formal" [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]] (usually specifically Modern Standard Arabic) is learned at school; although many speakers have a native-like command of the language, it is technically not the native language of any speakers. Both varieties can be both written and spoken, although the colloquial varieties are rarely written down and the formal variety is spoken mostly in formal circumstances, e.g., in radio and TV broadcasts, formal lectures, parliamentary discussions and to some extent between speakers of different colloquial dialects. Even when the literary language is spoken, however, it is normally only spoken in its pure form when reading a prepared text out loud and communication between speakers of different colloquial dialects. When speaking [[extemporaneous]]ly (i.e. making up the language on the spot, as in a normal discussion among people), speakers tend to deviate somewhat from the strict literary language in the direction of the colloquial varieties. In fact, there is a continuous range of "in-between" spoken varieties: from nearly pure Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), to a form that still uses MSA grammar and vocabulary but with significant colloquial influence, to a form of the colloquial language that imports a number of words and grammatical constructions in MSA, to a form that is close to pure colloquial but with the "rough edges" (the most noticeably "vulgar" or non-Classical aspects) smoothed out, to pure colloquial. The particular variant (or ''[[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]]'') used depends on the social class and education level of the speakers involved and the level of formality of the speech situation. Often it will vary within a single encounter, e.g., moving from nearly pure MSA to a more mixed language in the process of a radio interview, as the interviewee becomes more comfortable with the interviewer. This type of variation is characteristic of the [[diglossia]] that exists throughout the Arabic-speaking world.[[File:Poem by Abu 'ala al-Ma'arri ("I no longer steal from nature") read in Arabic.ogg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Recording of a poem by [[Al-Maʿarri#Asceticism|Al-Ma'arri titled "I no longer steal from nature"]]]]
Although Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is a unitary language, its pronunciation varies somewhat from country to country and from region to region within a country. The variation in individual "accents" of MSA speakers tends to mirror corresponding variations in the colloquial speech of the speakers in question, but with the distinguishing characteristics moderated somewhat. Note that it is important in descriptions of "Arabic" phonology to distinguish between pronunciation of a given colloquial (spoken) dialect and the pronunciation of MSA by these same speakers. Although they are related, they are not the same. For example, the phoneme that derives from Classical Arabic {{IPA|/ɟ/}} has many different pronunciations in the modern spoken varieties, e.g., {{IPA|[d͡ʒ ~ ʒ ~ j ~ ɡʲ ~ ɡ]}} including the proposed original {{IPA|[ɟ]}}. Speakers whose native variety has either {{IPAblink|d͡ʒ}} or {{IPAblink|ʒ}} will use the same pronunciation when speaking MSA. Even speakers from [[Cairo]], whose native Egyptian Arabic has {{IPAblink|ɡ}}, normally use {{IPAblink|ɡ}} when speaking MSA. The {{IPAblink|j}} of Persian Gulf speakers is the only variant pronunciation which isn't found in MSA; {{IPA|[d͡ʒ~ʒ]}} is used instead, but may use [j] in MSA for comfortable pronunciation. Another reason of different pronunciations is influence of [[varieties of Arabic#Phonetics|colloquial dialects]]. The differentiation of [[varieties of Arabic#phonetics|pronunciation of colloquial dialects]] is the influence from other languages previously spoken and some still presently spoken in the regions, such as [[Coptic language|Coptic]] in Egypt, [[Berber languages|Berber]], [[Punic language|Punic]] or [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] in North Africa, [[Himyaritic language|Himyaritic]], [[Modern South Arabian]] and [[Old South Arabian]] in Yemen and Oman, [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]] languages (including [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]]) in the Levant and Mesopotamia.

Another example: Many colloquial varieties are known for a type of [[vowel harmony]] in which the presence of an "emphatic consonant" triggers backed [[allophone]]s of nearby vowels (especially of the low vowels {{IPA|/aː/}}, which are backed to {{IPAblink|ɑ|ɑ(ː)}} in these circumstances and very often fronted to {{IPAblink|æ|æ(ː)}} in all other circumstances). In many spoken varieties, the backed or "emphatic" vowel allophones spread a fair distance in both directions from the triggering consonant; in some varieties (most notably Egyptian Arabic), the "emphatic" allophones spread throughout the entire word, usually including prefixes and suffixes, even at a distance of several syllables from the triggering consonant. Speakers of colloquial varieties with this vowel harmony tend to introduce it into their MSA pronunciation as well, but usually with a lesser degree of spreading than in the colloquial varieties. (For example, speakers of colloquial varieties with extremely long-distance harmony may allow a moderate, but not extreme, amount of spreading of the harmonic allophones in their MSA speech, while speakers of colloquial varieties with moderate-distance harmony may only harmonize immediately adjacent vowels in MSA.)

==== Vowels ====
Modern Standard Arabic has six pure [[vowel]]s (while most modern dialects have eight pure vowels which includes the long vowels {{IPA|/eː oː/}}), with short {{IPA|/a i u/}} and corresponding long vowels {{IPA|/aː iː uː/}}. There are also two [[diphthongs]]: {{IPA|/aj/}} and {{IPA|/aw/}}.

The pronunciation of the vowels differs from speaker to speaker, in a way that tends to reflect the pronunciation of the corresponding colloquial variety. Nonetheless, there are some common trends. Most noticeable is the differing pronunciation of {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/aː/}}, which tend towards fronted {{IPAblink|æ|æ(ː)}}, {{IPAblink|a|a(ː)}} or {{IPAblink|ɛ|ɛ(ː)}} in most situations, but a back {{IPAblink|ɑ|ɑ(ː)}} in the neighborhood of [[emphatic consonant]]s. Some accents and dialects, such as those of the [[Hijaz|Hejaz]] region, have an open {{IPAblink|a|a(ː)}} or a central {{IPAblink|ä|ä(ː)}} in all situations. The vowel {{IPA|/a/}} varies towards {{IPAblink|ə|ə(ː)}} too.  Listen to the final vowel in the recording of ''{{transl|ar|al-ʻarabiyyah}}'' at the beginning of this article, for example.  The point is, Arabic has only three short vowel phonemes, so those phonemes can have a very wide range of allophones.  The vowels {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/ɪ/}} are often affected somewhat in emphatic neighborhoods as well, with generally more back or centralized [[allophone]]s, but the differences are less great than for the low vowels. The pronunciation of short {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} tends towards {{IPA|[ʊ~o]}} and {{IPA|[i~e~ɨ]}}, respectively, in many dialects.

The definition of both "emphatic" and "neighborhood" vary in ways that reflect (to some extent) corresponding variations in the spoken dialects. Generally, the consonants triggering "emphatic" allophones are the [[pharyngealization|pharyngealized]] consonants {{IPA|/tˤ dˤ sˤ ðˤ/}}; {{IPAslink|q}}; and {{IPAslink|r}}, if not followed immediately by {{IPA|/i(ː)/}}. Frequently, the {{lcons|velar}} [[fricative]]s {{IPA|/x ɣ/}} also trigger emphatic allophones; occasionally also the [[pharyngeal consonant]]s {{IPA|/ʕ ħ/}} (the former more than the latter). Many dialects have multiple emphatic allophones of each vowel, depending on the particular nearby consonants. In most MSA accents, emphatic coloring of vowels is limited to vowels immediately adjacent to a triggering consonant, although in some it spreads a bit farther: e.g., {{rtl-lang|ar|وقت}} ''{{transl|ar|waqt}}'' {{IPA|[wɑqt]}} 'time'; {{rtl-lang|ar|وطن}} ''{{transl|ar|waṭan}}'' {{IPA|[wɑtˤɑn]}} 'homeland'; {{rtl-lang|ar|وسط المدينة}} ''{{transl|ar|wasṭ al-madīnah}}'' {{IPA|[wæstˤɑl-mædiːnɐ]}} 'downtown' (sometimes {{IPA|[wɑstˤɑl-mædiːnæ]}} or similar).

In a non-emphatic environment, the vowel {{IPA|/a/}} in the diphthong {{IPA|/aj/}} tends to be fronted even more than elsewhere, often pronounced {{IPA|[æj]}} or {{IPA|[ɛj]}}: hence {{rtl-lang|ar|سيف}} ''{{transl|ar|sayf}}'' {{IPA|[sajf ~ sæjf ~ sɛjf]}} 'sword' but {{rtl-lang|ar|صيف}} ''{{transl|ar|ṣayf}}'' {{IPA|[sˤɑjf]}} 'summer'. However, in accents with no emphatic allophones of {{IPA|/a/}} (e.g., in the [[Hijaz|Hejaz]]), the pronunciation {{IPA|[aj]}} or {{IPA|[äj]}} occurs in all situations.

The phoneme {{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}} is represented by the Arabic letter ''{{transl|ar|ALA|jīm}}'' ({{rtl-lang|ar|[[ج]]}}) and has many standard pronunciations. {{IPAblink|d͡ʒ}} is characteristic of north Algeria, Iraq, also in most of the Arabian peninsula but with an allophonic {{IPAblink|ʒ}} in some positions; {{IPAblink|ʒ}} occurs in most of the [[Levant]] and most North Africa; and {{IPAblink|ɡ}} is used in most of Egypt and some regions in Yemen and Oman. Generally this corresponds with the pronunciation in the colloquial dialects.&lt;ref name="Watson 2002 16"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Watson|2002|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some regions in Sudan and Yemen, as well as in some Sudanese and Yemeni dialects, it may be either {{IPA|[ɡʲ]}} or {{IPAblink|ɟ}}, representing the original pronunciation of Classical Arabic. Foreign words containing {{IPAslink|ɡ}} may be transcribed with {{rtl-lang|ar|[[ج]]}}, {{rtl-lang|ar|[[غ]]}}, {{rtl-lang|ar|[[ك]]}}, {{rtl-lang|ar|[[ق]]}}, {{rtl-lang|fa|[[گ]]}}, {{script/Arabic|[[ݣ]]}} or {{script/Arabic|ڨ}}, mainly depending on the regional spoken variety of Arabic or the commonly diacriticized Arabic letter. Note also that in northern Egypt, where the Arabic letter ''{{transl|ar|jīm}}'' ({{rtl-lang|ar|[[ج]]}}) is normally pronounced {{IPAblink|ɡ}}, a separate phoneme {{IPAslink|ʒ}}, which may be transcribed with {{rtl-lang|ar|چ}}, occurs in a small number of mostly non-Arabic loanwords, e.g., {{IPA|/ʒakitta/}} 'jacket'.

{{IPA|/θ/}} ({{rtl-lang|ar|ث}}) can be pronounced as {{IPAblink|t}} or even {{IPAblink|s}}. In some places of Maghreb it can be also pronounced as {{IPAblink|t͡s}}.

{{IPA|/x/}} and {{IPA|/ɣ/}} ({{rtl-lang|ar|خ,&amp;lrm; غ}}) are velar, post-velar, or uvular.&lt;ref name="Watson 2002 18"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Watson|2002|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many varieties, {{IPA|/ħ, ʕ/}} ({{rtl-lang|ar|ح,&amp;lrm; ع}}) are actually [[epiglottal consonant|epiglottal]] {{IPA|[ʜ, ʢ]}} (despite what is reported in many earlier works).

{{IPA|/l/}} is pronounced as velarized {{IPAblink|ɫ}} in الله {{IPA|/ʔallaːh/}}, the name of God, q.e. [[Allah]], when the word follows ''a'', ''ā'', ''u'' or ''ū'' (after ''i'' or ''ī'' it is unvelarized: {{rtl-lang|ar|بسم الله}} ''bismi l–lāh'' {{IPA|/bismillaːh/}}). Some speakers velarize other occurrences of {{IPA|/l/}} in MSA, in imitation of their spoken dialects.

The emphatic consonant {{IPA|/dˤ/}} was actually pronounced {{IPA|[ɮˤ]}}, or possibly {{IPA|[d͡ɮˤ]}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Charles|last=Ferguson|title=The Arabic Koine|journal=Language|volume=35|year=1959|page=630|issue=4|doi=10.2307/410601|jstor=410601}}&lt;/ref&gt;—either way, a highly unusual sound. The medieval Arabs actually termed their language ''{{transl|ar|ALA|lughat al-ḍād}}'' 'the language of the [[Ḍād]]' (the name of the letter used for this sound), since they thought the sound was unique to their language. (In fact, it also exists in a few other minority Semitic languages, e.g., Mehri.)

Arabic has consonants traditionally termed "emphatic" {{IPA|/tˤ, dˤ, sˤ, ðˤ/}} ({{rtl-lang|ar|ط,&amp;lrm; ض,&amp;lrm; ص,&amp;lrm; ظ}}), which exhibit simultaneous [[pharyngealization]] {{IPA|[tˤ, dˤ, sˤ, ðˤ]}} as well as varying degrees of [[velarization]] {{IPA|[tˠ, dˠ, sˠ, ðˠ]}}, so they may be written with the "Velarized or pharyngealized" diacritic (&lt;big&gt;{{IPA| ̴ }}&lt;/big&gt;) as: {{IPA|/t̴, d̴, s̴, ð̴/}}. This simultaneous articulation is described as "Retracted Tongue Root" by phonologists.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., {{Harvcoltxt|Thelwall|2003|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some transcription systems, emphasis is shown by capitalizing the letter, for example, {{IPA|/dˤ/}} is written {{angle bracket|D}}; in others the letter is underlined or has a dot below it, for example, {{angle bracket|{{transl|ar|ḍ}}}}.

Vowels and consonants can be phonologically short or long. Long ([[gemination|geminate]]) consonants are normally written doubled in Latin transcription (i.e. bb, dd, etc.), reflecting the presence of the [[Arabic diacritics|Arabic diacritic]] mark ''{{transl|ar|shaddah}}'', which indicates doubled consonants. In actual pronunciation, doubled consonants are held twice as long as short consonants. This consonant lengthening is phonemically contrastive: {{rtl-lang|ar|قبل}} ''{{transl|ar|qabila}}'' 'he accepted' vs. {{rtl-lang|ar|قبّل}} ''{{transl|ar|qabbala}}'' 'he kissed'.

==== Syllable structure ====
Arabic has two kinds of syllables: open syllables (CV) and (CVV)—and closed syllables (CVC), (CVVC) and (CVCC). The syllable types with two [[morae]] (units of time), i.e. CVC and CVV, are termed ''[[heavy syllable]]s'', while those with three morae, i.e. CVVC and CVCC, are ''[[superheavy syllable]]s''. Superheavy syllables in Classical Arabic occur in only two places: at the end of the sentence (due to [[pausa]]l pronunciation) and in words such as {{rtl-lang|ar|حارّ}} ''{{transl|ar|ḥārr}}'' 'hot', {{rtl-lang|ar|مادّة}} ''{{transl|ar|māddah}}'' 'stuff, substance', {{rtl-lang|ar|تحاجوا}} ''{{transl|ar|taḥājjū}}'' 'they disputed with each other', where a long ''{{transl|ar|ā}}'' occurs before two identical consonants (a former short vowel between the consonants has been lost). (In less formal pronunciations of Modern Standard Arabic, superheavy syllables are common at the end of words or before [[clitic]] suffixes such as ''{{transl|ar|-nā}}'' 'us, our', due to the deletion of final short vowels.)

In surface pronunciation, every vowel must be preceded by a consonant (which may include the [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[ʔ]}}). There are no cases of [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]] within a word (where two vowels occur next to each other, without an intervening consonant). Some words do have an underlying vowel at the beginning, such as the definite article ''al-'' or words such as {{rtl-lang|ar|اشترا}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ishtarā}}'' 'he bought', {{rtl-lang|ar|اجتماع}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ijtimāʻ}}'' 'meeting'. When actually pronounced, one of three things happens:
* If the word occurs after another word ending in a consonant, there is a smooth transition from final consonant to initial vowel, e.g., {{rtl-lang|ar|اجتماع}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-ijtimāʻ}}'' 'meeting' {{IPA|/alid͡ʒtimaːʕ/}}.
* If the word occurs after another word ending in a vowel, the initial vowel of the word is [[elision|elided]], e.g., {{rtl-lang|ar|بيت المدير}} ''{{transl|ar|baytu (a)l-mudīr}}'' 'house of the director' {{IPA|/bajtulmudiːr/}}.
* If the word occurs at the beginning of an utterance, a glottal stop {{IPA|[ʔ]}} is added onto the beginning, e.g., {{rtl-lang|ar|البيت هو}} ''{{transl|ar|al-baytu huwa ...}}'' 'The house is ...' {{IPA|/ʔalbajtuhuwa ... /}}.

==== Stress ====
Word stress is not phonemically contrastive in Standard Arabic. It bears a strong relationship to vowel length. The basic rules for Modern Standard Arabic are:
* A final vowel, long or short, may not be stressed.
* Only one of the last three syllables may be stressed.
* Given this restriction, the last [[heavy syllable]] (containing a long vowel or ending in a consonant) is stressed, if it is not the final syllable.
* If the final syllable is super heavy and closed (of the form CVVC or CVCC) it receives stress.
* If no syllable is heavy or super heavy, the first possible syllable (i.e. third from end) is stressed.
* As a special exception, in Form VII and VIII verb forms stress may not be on the first syllable, despite the above rules: Hence ''{{transl|ar|in&lt;u&gt;ka&lt;/u&gt;tab(a)}}'' 'he subscribed' (whether or not the final short vowel is pronounced), ''{{transl|ar|yan&lt;u&gt;ka&lt;/u&gt;tib(u)}}'' 'he subscribes' (whether or not the final short vowel is pronounced), ''{{transl|ar|yan&lt;u&gt;ka&lt;/u&gt;tib}}'' 'he should subscribe (juss.)'. Likewise Form VIII ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ish&lt;u&gt;ta&lt;/u&gt;rā}}'' 'he bought', ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yash&lt;u&gt;ta&lt;/u&gt;rī}}'' 'he buys'.

Examples:''{{transl|ar|ki&lt;u&gt;tā&lt;/u&gt;b(un)}}'' 'book', ''{{transl|ar|&lt;u&gt;kā&lt;/u&gt;-ti-b(un)}}'' 'writer', ''{{transl|ar|&lt;u&gt;mak&lt;/u&gt;-ta-b(un)}}'' 'desk', ''{{transl|ar|ma-&lt;u&gt;kā&lt;/u&gt;-ti-b(u)}}'' 'desks', ''{{transl|ar|mak-&lt;u&gt;ta&lt;/u&gt;-ba-tun}}'' 'library' (but ''{{transl|ar|&lt;u&gt;mak&lt;/u&gt;-ta-ba(-tun)}}'' 'library' in short pronunciation), ''{{transl|ar|&lt;u&gt;ka&lt;/u&gt;-ta-bū}}'' (Modern Standard Arabic) 'they wrote' = ''{{transl|ar|&lt;u&gt;ka&lt;/u&gt;-ta-bu}}'' (dialect), ''{{transl|ar|ka-ta-&lt;u&gt;bū&lt;/u&gt;-h(u)}}'' (Modern Standard Arabic) 'they wrote it' = ''{{transl|ar|ka-ta-&lt;u&gt;bū&lt;/u&gt;}}'' (dialect), ''{{transl|ar|ka-&lt;u&gt;ta&lt;/u&gt;-ba-tā}}'' (Modern Standard Arabic) 'they (dual, fem) wrote', ''{{transl|ar|ka-&lt;u&gt;tab&lt;/u&gt;-tu}}'' (Modern Standard Arabic) 'I wrote' = ''{{transl|ar|ka-&lt;u&gt;tabt&lt;/u&gt;}}'' (short form or dialect). Doubled consonants count as two consonants: ''{{transl|ar|ma-&lt;u&gt;jal&lt;/u&gt;-la-(tan)}}'' 'magazine', ''{{transl|ar|ma-&lt;u&gt;ḥal&lt;/u&gt;l(-un)}}'' "place".

These rules may result in differently stressed syllables when final case endings are pronounced, vs. the normal situation where they are not pronounced, as in the above example of ''{{transl|ar|mak-&lt;u&gt;ta&lt;/u&gt;-ba-tun}}'' 'library' in full pronunciation, but ''{{transl|ar|&lt;u&gt;mak&lt;/u&gt;-ta-ba(-tun)}}'' 'library' in short pronunciation.

The restriction on final long vowels does not apply to the spoken dialects, where original final long vowels have been shortened and secondary final long vowels have arisen from loss of original final ''-hu/hi''.

Some dialects have different stress rules. In the Cairo (Egyptian Arabic) dialect a heavy syllable may not carry stress more than two syllables from the end of a word, hence ''{{transl|ar|mad-&lt;u&gt;ra&lt;/u&gt;-sah}}'' 'school', ''{{transl|ar|qā-&lt;u&gt;hi&lt;/u&gt;-rah}}'' 'Cairo'. This also affects the way that Modern Standard Arabic is pronounced in Egypt. In the Arabic of [[Sana'a|Sanaa]], stress is often retracted: ''{{transl|ar|&lt;u&gt;bay&lt;/u&gt;-tayn}}'' 'two houses', ''{{transl|ar|&lt;u&gt;mā&lt;/u&gt;-sat-hum}}'' 'their table', ''{{transl|ar|ma-&lt;u&gt;kā&lt;/u&gt;-tīb}}'' 'desks', ''{{transl|ar|&lt;u&gt;zā&lt;/u&gt;-rat-ḥīn}}'' 'sometimes', ''{{transl|ar|mad-&lt;u&gt;ra&lt;/u&gt;-sat-hum}}'' 'their school'. (In this dialect, only syllables with long vowels or diphthongs are considered heavy; in a two-syllable word, the final syllable can be stressed only if the preceding syllable is light; and in longer words, the final syllable cannot be stressed.)

==== Levels of pronunciation ====
The final short vowels (e.g., the case endings ''-a -i -u'' and mood endings ''-u -a'') are often not pronounced in this language, despite forming part of the formal paradigm of nouns and verbs. The following levels of pronunciation exist:

===== Full pronunciation with [[pausa]] =====
This is the most formal level actually used in speech. All endings are pronounced as written, except at the end of an utterance, where the following changes occur:
* Final short vowels are not pronounced. (But possibly an exception is made for feminine plural ''-na'' and shortened vowels in the jussive/imperative of defective verbs, e.g., ''irmi!'' 'throw!'".)
* The entire indefinite noun endings ''-in'' and ''-un'' (with [[nunation]]) are left off. The ending ''-an'' is left off of nouns preceded by a ''[[tāʾ marbūṭah]]'' ة (i.e. the ''-t'' in the ending ''-at-'' that typically marks feminine nouns), but pronounced as ''-ā'' in other nouns (hence its writing in this fashion in the Arabic script).
* The ''tāʼ marbūṭah'' itself (typically of feminine nouns) is pronounced as ''h''. (At least, this is the case in extremely formal pronunciation, e.g., some Quranic recitations. In practice, this ''h'' is usually omitted.)

===== Formal short pronunciation =====
This is a formal level of pronunciation sometimes seen. It is somewhat like pronouncing all words as if they were in pausal position (with influence from the [[varieties of Arabic|colloquial varieties]]). The following changes occur:
* Most final short vowels are not pronounced. However, the following short vowels ''are'' pronounced:
** feminine plural ''-na''
** shortened vowels in the jussive/imperative of defective verbs, e.g., ''irmi!'' 'throw!'
** second-person singular feminine past-tense ''-ti'' and likewise ''anti'' 'you (fem. sg.)'
** sometimes, first-person singular past-tense ''-tu''
** sometimes, second-person masculine past-tense ''-ta'' and likewise ''anta'' 'you (masc. sg.)'
** final ''-a'' in certain short words, e.g., ''laysa'' 'is not', ''sawfa'' (future-tense marker)
* The [[nunation]] endings ''-an -in -un'' are not pronounced. However, they ''are'' pronounced in adverbial accusative formations, e.g., ''{{transl|ar|taqrīban}}'' تَقْرِيبًا 'almost, approximately', ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ʻādatan}}'' عَادَةً 'usually'.
* The ''[[tāʾ marbūṭah]]'' ending ة is unpronounced, ''except'' in [[construct state]] nouns, where it sounds as ''t'' (and in adverbial accusative constructions, e.g., ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ʻādatan}}'' عَادَةً 'usually', where the entire ''-tan'' is pronounced).
* The masculine singular [[Arabic grammar#Nisba|nisbah]] ending ''{{transl|ar|ALA|-iyy}}'' is actually pronounced ''{{transl|ar|-ī}}'' and is unstressed (but plural and feminine singular forms, i.e. when followed by a suffix, still sound as ''{{transl|ar|ALA|-iyy-}}'').
* ''Full endings'' (including case endings) occur when a [[clitic]] object or [[possessive suffix]] is added (e.g., ''{{transl|ar|-nā}}'' 'us/our').

===== Informal short pronunciation =====
This is the pronunciation used by speakers of Modern Standard Arabic in [[extemporaneous]] speech, i.e. when producing new sentences rather than simply reading a prepared text. It is similar to formal short pronunciation except that the rules for dropping final vowels apply ''even'' when a [[clitic]] suffix is added. Basically, short-vowel case and mood endings are never pronounced and certain other changes occur that echo the corresponding colloquial pronunciations. Specifically:
* All the rules for formal short pronunciation apply, except as follows.
* The past tense singular endings written formally as ''-tu -ta -ti'' are pronounced ''-t -t -ti''. But masculine ''{{transl|ar|ʾanta}}'' is pronounced in full.
* Unlike in formal short pronunciation, the rules for dropping or modifying final endings are also applied when a [[clitic]] object or possessive suffix is added (e.g., ''{{transl|ar|-nā}}'' 'us/our'). If this produces a sequence of three consonants, then one of the following happens, depending on the speaker's native colloquial variety:
** A short vowel (e.g., ''-i-'' or ''-ǝ-'') is consistently added, either between the second and third or the first and second consonants.
** Or, a short vowel is added only if an otherwise unpronounceable sequence occurs, typically due to a violation of the [[sonority hierarchy]] (e.g., ''-rtn-'' is pronounced as a three-consonant cluster, but ''-trn-'' needs to be broken up).
** Or, a short vowel is never added, but consonants like ''r l m n'' occurring between two other consonants will be pronounced as a [[syllabic consonant]] (as in the English words "butter bottle bottom button").
** When a doubled consonant occurs before another consonant (or finally), it is often shortened to a single consonant rather than a vowel added. (But note that Moroccan Arabic never shortens doubled consonants or inserts short vowels to break up clusters, instead tolerating arbitrary-length series of arbitrary consonants and hence Moroccan Arabic speakers are likely to follow the same rules in their pronunciation of Modern Standard Arabic.)
* The clitic suffixes themselves tend also to be changed, in a way that avoids many possible occurrences of three-consonant clusters. In particular, ''-ka -ki -hu'' generally sound as ''-ak -ik -uh''.
* Final long vowels are often shortened, merging with any short vowels that remain.
* Depending on the level of formality, the speaker's education level, etc., various grammatical changes may occur in ways that echo the colloquial variants:
** Any remaining case endings (e.g. masculine plural nominative ''-ūn'' vs. oblique ''-īn'') will be leveled, with the oblique form used everywhere. (However, in words like ''{{transl|ar|ab}}'' 'father' and ''{{transl|ar|ALA|akh}}'' 'brother' with special long-vowel case endings in the [[construct state]], the nominative is used everywhere, hence ''{{transl|ar|ALA|abū}}'' 'father of', ''{{transl|ar|ALA|akhū}}'' 'brother of'.)
** Feminine plural endings in verbs and clitic suffixes will often drop out, with the masculine plural endings used instead. If the speaker's native variety has feminine plural endings, they may be preserved, but will often be modified in the direction of the forms used in the speaker's native variety, e.g. ''-an'' instead of ''-na''.
** Dual endings will often drop out except on nouns and then used only for emphasis (similar to their use in the colloquial varieties); elsewhere, the plural endings are used (or feminine singular, if appropriate).

As mentioned above, many spoken dialects have a process of ''emphasis spreading'', where the "emphasis" ([[pharyngealization]]) of [[emphatic consonant]]s spreads forward and back through adjacent syllables, pharyngealizing all nearby consonants and triggering the back allophone {{IPAblink|ɑ|ɑ(ː)}} in all nearby [[low vowel]]s. The extent of emphasis spreading varies. For example, in Moroccan Arabic, it spreads as far as the first full vowel (i.e. sound derived from a long vowel or diphthong) on either side; in many Levantine dialects, it spreads indefinitely, but is blocked by any {{IPAslink|j}} or {{IPAslink|ʃ}}; while in Egyptian Arabic, it usually spreads throughout the entire word, including prefixes and suffixes. In Moroccan Arabic, {{IPA|/i u/}} also have emphatic allophones {{IPA|[e~ɛ]}} and {{IPA|[o~ɔ]}}, respectively.

Unstressed short vowels, especially {{IPA|/i u/}}, are deleted in many contexts. Many sporadic examples of short vowel change have occurred (especially {{IPA|/a/}}→{{IPA|/i/}} and interchange {{IPA|/i/}}↔{{IPA|/u/}}). Most Levantine dialects merge short /i u/ into {{IPA|/ə/}} in most contexts (all except directly before a single final consonant). In Moroccan Arabic, on the other hand, short {{IPA|/u/}} triggers [[labialization]] of nearby consonants (especially [[velar consonant]]s and [[uvular consonant]]s), and then short /a i u/ all merge into {{IPA|/ə/}}, which is deleted in many contexts. (The labialization plus {{IPA|/ə/}} is sometimes interpreted as an underlying phoneme {{IPA|/ŭ/}}.) This essentially causes the wholesale loss of the short-long vowel distinction, with the original long vowels {{IPA|/aː iː uː/}} remaining as half-long {{IPA|[aˑ iˑ uˑ]}}, phonemically {{IPA|/a i u/}}, which are used to represent ''both'' short and long vowels in borrowings from Literary Arabic.

Most spoken dialects have [[monophthongization|monophthongized]] original {{IPA|/aj aw/}} to {{IPA|/eː oː/}} in most circumstances, including adjacent to emphatic consonants, while keeping them as the original diphthongs in others e.g. {{rtl-lang|ar|مَوْعِد}} {{IPA|/m'''aw'''ʕid/}}. In most of the [[Moroccan Arabic|Moroccan]], [[Algerian Arabic|Algerian]] and [[Tunisian Arabic|Tunisian]] (except Sahil and Southeastern) Arabic dialects, they have subsequently merged into original {{IPA|/iː uː/}}.

====Consonants====
In some dialects, there may be more or fewer phonemes than those listed in the chart above. For example, non-Arabic {{IPAblink|v}} is used in the Maghrebi dialects as well in the written language mostly for foreign names. Semitic {{IPAblink|p}} became {{IPA|[f]}} extremely early on in Arabic before it was written down; a few modern Arabic dialects, such as Iraqi (influenced by Persian and [[Kurdish Language|Kurdish]]) distinguish between {{IPAblink|p}} and {{IPAblink|b}}. The Iraqi Arabic also uses sounds {{IPAblink|ɡ}}, {{IPAblink|t͡ʃ}} and uses Persian adding letters, e.g.: {{lang|fa|گوجة}} ''{{transl|ar|gawjah}}'' – ''a plum''; {{lang|fa|چمة}} ''{{transl|ar|chimah}} – ''a truffle'' and so on.

Early in the expansion of Arabic, the separate emphatic phonemes {{IPA|[ɮˤ]}} and {{IPA|[ðˤ]}} coalesced into a single phoneme {{IPA|[ðˤ]}}. Many dialects (such as Egyptian, Levantine, and much of the Maghreb) subsequently lost {{lcons|interdental}} [[fricative]]s, converting {{IPA|[θ ð ðˤ]}} into {{IPA|[t d dˤ]}}. Most dialects borrow "learned" words from the Standard language using the same pronunciation as for inherited words, but some dialects without interdental fricatives (particularly in Egypt and the Levant) render original {{IPA|[θ ð ðˤ dˤ]}} in borrowed words as {{IPA|[s z zˤ dˤ]}}.

Another key distinguishing mark of Arabic dialects is how they render the original velar and uvular plosives {{IPAslink|q}}, {{IPAslink|d͡ʒ}} (Proto-Semitic {{IPAslink|ɡ}}), and {{IPAslink|k}}:
* {{rtl-lang|ar|ق}} {{IPAslink|q}} retains its original pronunciation in widely scattered regions such as Yemen, Morocco, and urban areas of the Maghreb. It is pronounced as a [[glottal stop]] {{IPAblink|ʔ}} in several [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige dialects]], such as those spoken in Cairo, Beirut and Damascus. But it is rendered as a voiced velar plosive {{IPAblink|ɡ}} in Persian Gulf, Upper Egypt, parts of the Maghreb, and less urban parts of the Levant (e.g. Jordan). In Iraqi Arabic it sometimes retains its original pronunciation and is sometimes rendered as a voiced velar plosive, depending on the word. Some traditionally Christian villages in rural areas of the Levant render the sound as {{IPAblink|k}}, as do Shiʻi Bahrainis. In some Gulf dialects, it is palatalized to {{IPAblink|d͡ʒ}} or {{IPAblink|ʒ}}. It is pronounced as a voiced uvular constrictive {{IPAblink|ʁ}} in Sudanese Arabic. Many dialects with a modified pronunciation for {{IPAslink|q}} maintain the {{IPAblink|q}} pronunciation in certain words (often with religious or educational overtones) borrowed from the Classical language.
* {{rtl-lang|ar|ج}} {{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}} is pronounced as an affricate in Iraq and much of the Arabian Peninsula, but is pronounced {{IPAblink|ɡ}} in most of North Egypt and parts of Yemen and Oman, {{IPAblink|ʒ}} in Morocco, Tunisia and the Levant, and {{IPAblink|j}}, {{IPA|[i̠]}} in most words in much of the Persian Gulf.
* {{rtl-lang|ar|ك}} {{IPAslink|k}} usually retains its original pronunciation, but is palatalized to {{IPAslink|t͡ʃ}} in many words in Israel and the Palestinian Territories, Iraq, and countries in the eastern part of the Arabian Peninsula. Often a distinction is made between the suffixes {{IPA|/-ak/}} ('you', masc.) and {{IPA|/-ik/}} ('you', fem.), which become {{IPA|/-ak/}} and {{IPA|/-it͡ʃ/}}, respectively. In Sana'a, Omani, and Bahrani {{IPA|/-ik/}} is pronounced {{IPA|/-iʃ/}}.

Pharyngealization of the emphatic consonants tends to weaken in many of the spoken varieties, and to spread from emphatic consonants to nearby sounds. In addition, the "emphatic" allophone {{IPAblink|ɑ}} automatically triggers pharyngealization of adjacent sounds in many dialects. As a result, it may difficult or impossible to determine whether a given [[coronal consonant]] is phonemically emphatic or not, especially in dialects with long-distance emphasis spreading. (A notable exception is the sounds {{IPAslink|t}} vs. {{IPAslink|tˤ}} in Moroccan Arabic, because the former is pronounced as an [[affricate]] {{IPAblink|t͡s}} but the latter is not.)

== Grammar ==
[[File:Fa33aalah EN.pdf|thumb|upright=1.5|right|Examples of how the Arabic root and form system works]]
{{Main|Arabic grammar}}

=== Literary Arabic ===
{{main|Modern Standard Arabic}}
As in other Semitic languages, Arabic has a complex and unusual [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (i.e. method of constructing words from a basic [[root (linguistics)|root]]). Arabic has a [[nonconcatenative morphology|nonconcatenative]] "root-and-pattern" morphology: A root consists of a set of bare consonants (usually [[triliteral|three]]), which are fitted into a discontinuous pattern to form words. For example, the word for 'I wrote' is constructed by combining the root '''{{transl|ar|k-t-b}}''' 'write' with the pattern '''{{transl|ar|-a-a-tu}}''' 'I Xed' to form ''{{transl|ar|katabtu}}'' 'I wrote'. Other verbs meaning 'I Xed' will typically have the same pattern but with different consonants, e.g. ''{{transl|ar|ALA|qaraʼtu}}'' 'I read', ''{{transl|ar|ALA|akaltu}}'' 'I ate', ''{{transl|ar|ALA|dhahabtu}}'' 'I went', although other patterns are possible (e.g. ''{{transl|ar|ALA|sharibtu}}'' 'I drank', ''{{transl|ar|ALA|qultu}}'' 'I said', ''{{transl|ar|ALA|takallamtu}}'' 'I spoke', where the subpattern used to signal the past tense may change but the suffix ''{{transl|ar|-tu}}'' is always used).

From a single root '''{{transl|ar|k-t-b}}''', numerous words can be formed by applying different patterns:
* ''{{transl|ar|ALA|katabtu}}'' 'I wrote'
* ''{{transl|ar|ALA|kattabtu}}'' 'I had (something) written'
* ''{{transl|ar|ALA|kātabtu}}'' 'I corresponded (with someone)'
* ''{{transl|ar|ALA|aktabtu}}'' 'I dictated'
* ''{{transl|ar|ALA|iktatabtu}}'' 'I subscribed'
* ''{{transl|ar|ALA|takātabnā}}'' 'we corresponded with each other'
* ''{{transl|ar|ALA|aktubu}}'' 'I write'
* ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ukattibu}}'' 'I have (something) written'
* ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ukātibu}}'' 'I correspond (with someone)'
* ''{{transl|ar|ALA|uktibu}}'' 'I dictate'
* ''{{transl|ar|ALA|aktatibu}}'' 'I subscribe'
* ''{{transl|ar|ALA|natakātabu}}'' 'we correspond each other'
* ''{{transl|ar|ALA|kotiba}}'' 'it was written'
* ''{{transl|ar|ALA|uktiba}}'' 'it was dictated'
* ''{{transl|ar|ALA|maktoub}}'' 'written'
* ''{{transl|ar|ALA|muktab}}'' 'dictated'
* ''{{transl|ar|ALA|kitāb}}'' 'book'
* ''{{transl|ar|ALA|kotub}}'' 'books'
* ''{{transl|ar|ALA|kātib}}'' 'writer'
* ''{{transl|ar|ALA|kuttāb}}'' 'writers'
* ''{{transl|ar|maktab}}'' 'desk, office'
* ''{{transl|ar|maktabah}}'' 'library, bookshop'
* etc.

====Nouns and adjectives====
Nouns in Literary Arabic have three grammatical [[noun case|cases]] ([[nominative case|nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], and [[genitive case|genitive]] [also used when the noun is governed by a preposition]); three [[grammatical number|numbers]] (singular, dual and plural); two [[gender (grammar)|genders]] (masculine and feminine); and three "states" (indefinite, definite, and [[Status constructus|construct]]). The cases of singular nouns (other than those that end in long ā) are indicated by [[suffix]]ed short vowels (/-u/ for nominative, /-a/ for accusative, /-i/ for genitive).

The feminine singular is often marked by /-at/, which is reduced to /-ah/ or /-a/ before a pause. Plural is indicated either through endings (the [[sound plural]]) or internal modification (the [[broken plural]]). Definite nouns include all proper nouns, all nouns in "construct state" and all nouns which are [[prefix]]ed by the definite article /al-/. Indefinite singular nouns (other than those that end in long ā) add a final /-n/ to the case-marking vowels, giving /-un/, /-an/ or /-in/ (which is also referred to as [[nunation]] or [[tanwīn]]).

[[Adjective]]s in Literary Arabic are marked for case, number, gender and state, as for nouns. However, the plural of all non-human nouns is always combined with a singular feminine adjective, which takes the /-ah/ or /-at/ suffix.

[[Pronoun]]s in Literary Arabic are marked for person, number and gender. There are two varieties, independent pronouns and [[Enclitic#Enclitic|enclitics]]. Enclitic pronouns are attached to the end of a verb, noun or preposition and indicate verbal and prepositional objects or possession of nouns. The first-person singular pronoun has a different enclitic form used for verbs (/-ni/) and for nouns or prepositions (/-ī/ after consonants, /-ya/ after vowels).

Nouns, verbs, pronouns and adjectives agree with each other in all respects. However, non-human plural nouns are grammatically considered to be feminine singular. Furthermore, a verb in a verb-initial sentence is marked as singular regardless of its semantic number when the subject of the verb is explicitly mentioned as a noun. Numerals between three and ten show "chiasmic" agreement, in that grammatically masculine numerals have feminine marking and vice versa.

====Verbs====
Verbs in Literary Arabic are marked for person (first, second, or third), gender, and number. They are [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] in two major paradigms ([[past]] and [[non-past]]); two [[grammatical voice|voices]] (active and passive); and six [[grammatical mood|moods]] ([[indicative]], [[imperative mood|imperative]], [[subjunctive]], [[Irrealis mood#Jussive|jussive]], shorter [[energetic mood|energetic]] and longer energetic), the fifth and sixth moods, the energetics, exist only in Classical Arabic but not in MSA.&lt;ref&gt;Rydin, Karin C. (2005). A reference grammar of Modern Standard Arabic. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also two [[participle]]s (active and passive) and a [[verbal noun]], but no [[infinitive]].

The past and non-past paradigms are sometimes also termed [[perfective]] and [[imperfective]], indicating the fact that they actually represent a combination of [[Grammatical tense|tense]] and [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]]. The moods other than the [[indicative]] occur only in the non-past, and the [[future tense]] is signaled by prefixing ''{{transl|ar|sa-}}'' or ''{{transl|ar|sawfa}}'' onto the non-past. The past and non-past differ in the form of the stem (e.g., past ''{{transl|ar|katab-}}'' vs. non-past ''{{transl|ar|-ktub-}}''), and also use completely different sets of affixes for indicating person, number and gender: In the past, the person, number and gender are fused into a single [[suffix]]al morpheme, while in the non-past, a combination of [[prefix]]es (primarily encoding person) and suffixes (primarily encoding gender and number) are used. The passive voice uses the same person/number/gender affixes but changes the vowels of the stem.

The following shows a paradigm of a regular Arabic verb, ''{{transl|ar|kataba}}'' 'to write'. Note that in Modern Standard, the energetic mood (in either long or short form, which have the same meaning) is almost never used.

====Derivation====
Like other [[Semitic languages]], and unlike most other languages, Arabic makes much more use of [[nonconcatenative morphology]] (applying a large number of templates applied roots) to [[Morphological derivation|derive]] words than adding prefixes or suffixes to words.

For verbs, a given root can occur in many different [[Derived stem|derived verb stems]] (of which there are about fifteen), each with one or more characteristic meanings and each with its own templates for the past and non-past stems, active and passive participles, and verbal noun. These are referred to by Western scholars as "Form I", "Form II", and so on through "Form XV" (although Forms XI to XV are rare). These stems encode grammatical functions such as the [[causative]], [[intensive]] and [[reflexive verb|reflexive]]. Stems sharing the same root consonants represent separate verbs, albeit often semantically related, and each is the basis for its own [[Verb conjugation|conjugational]] paradigm. As a result, these derived stems are part of the system of [[derivational morphology]], not part of the [[inflection]]al system.

Examples of the different verbs formed from the root ''{{transl|ar|k-t-b}}'' 'write' (using ''{{transl|ar|ḥ-m-r}}'' 'red' for Form IX, which is limited to colors and physical defects):

|}

Form II is sometimes used to create transitive [[denominative verb]]s (verbs built from nouns); Form V is the equivalent used for intransitive denominatives.

The associated participles and verbal nouns of a verb are the primary means of forming new lexical nouns in Arabic. This is similar to the process by which, for example, the [[English gerund]] "meeting" (similar to a verbal noun) has turned into a noun referring to a particular type of social, often work-related event where people gather together to have a "discussion" (another lexicalized verbal noun). Another fairly common means of forming nouns is through one of a limited number of patterns that can be applied directly to roots, such as the "nouns of location" in ''ma-'' (e.g. ''{{transl|ar|maktab}}'' 'desk, office' &lt; ''{{transl|ar|k-t-b}}'' 'write', ''{{transl|ar|maṭbakh}}'' 'kitchen' &lt; ''{{transl|ar|ṭ-b-kh}}'' 'cook').

The only three genuine suffixes are as follows:
* The feminine suffix ''-ah''; variously derives terms for women from related terms for men, or more generally terms along the same lines as the corresponding masculine, e.g. ''{{transl|ar|maktabah}}'' 'library' (also a writing-related place, but different from ''{{transl|ar|maktab}}'', as above).
* The [[Arabic grammar#Nisba|nisbah]] suffix ''-iyy-''. This suffix is extremely productive, and forms adjectives meaning "related to X". It corresponds to English adjectives in ''-ic, -al, -an, -y, -ist'', etc.
* The feminine [[Arabic grammar#Nisba|nisbah]] suffix ''-iyyah''. This is formed by adding the feminine suffix ''-ah'' onto nisba adjectives to form abstract nouns. For example, from the basic root ''{{transl|ar|sh-r-k}}'' 'share' can be derived the Form VIII verb ''{{transl|ar|ishtaraka}}'' 'to cooperate, participate', and in turn its verbal noun ''{{transl|ar|ishtirāk}}'' 'cooperation, participation' can be formed. This in turn can be made into a nisbah adjective ''{{transl|ar|ishtirākī}}'' 'socialist', from which an abstract noun ''{{transl|ar|ishtirākiyyah}}'' 'socialism' can be derived. Other recent formations are ''{{transl|ar|jumhūriyyah}}'' 'republic' (lit. "public-ness", &lt; ''{{transl|ar|jumhūr}}'' 'multitude, general public'), and the [[Gaddafi]]-specific variation ''{{transl|ar|jamāhīriyyah}}'' 'people's republic' (lit. "masses-ness", &lt; ''{{transl|ar|jamāhīr}}'' 'the masses', pl. of ''{{transl|ar|jumhūr}}'', as above).

=== Colloquial varieties ===
{{main|Varieties of Arabic}}
The spoken dialects have lost the case distinctions and make only limited use of the dual (it occurs only on nouns and its use is no longer required in all circumstances). They have lost the mood distinctions other than imperative, but many have since gained new moods through the use of prefixes (most often /bi-/ for indicative vs. unmarked subjunctive). They have also mostly lost the indefinite "nunation" and the internal passive.

The following is an example of a regular verb paradigm in Egyptian Arabic.

[[File:Menulis khat.jpg|thumb|[[Islamic calligraphy]] written by a Malay Muslim in Malaysia. The calligrapher is making a rough draft.]]
The Arabic alphabet derives from the Aramaic through [[Nabatean alphabet|Nabatean]], to which it bears a loose resemblance like that of [[Coptic alphabet|Coptic]] or [[Cyrillic script]]s to [[Greek alphabet|Greek script]]. Traditionally, there were several differences between the Western (North African) and Middle Eastern versions of the alphabet—in particular, the ''faʼ'' had a dot underneath and ''qaf'' a single dot above in the Maghreb, and the order of the letters was slightly different (at least when they were used as numerals).

However, the old Maghrebi variant has been abandoned except for calligraphic purposes in the Maghreb itself, and remains in use mainly in the Quranic schools ([[zaouia]]s) of West Africa. Arabic, like all other Semitic languages (except for the Latin-written Maltese, and the languages with the [[Ge'ez script]]), is written from right to left. There are several styles of script, notably [[Naskh (script)|naskh]], which is used in print and by computers, and [[Ruq'ah|ruqʻah]], which is commonly used in [[handwriting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hanna|Greis|1972|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Calligraphy ===
{{Main|Islamic calligraphy}}
After [[Khalil ibn Ahmad al Farahidi]] finally fixed the Arabic script around 786, many styles were developed, both for the writing down of the Quran and other books, and for inscriptions on monuments as decoration.

Arabic calligraphy has not fallen out of use as calligraphy has in the Western world, and is still considered by [[Arabs]] as a major art form; calligraphers are held in great esteem. Being cursive by nature, unlike the Latin script, Arabic script is used to write down a [[ayah|verse]] of the Quran, a [[hadith]], or simply a [[proverb]]. The composition is often abstract, but sometimes the writing is shaped into an actual form such as that of an animal. One of the current masters of the genre is [[Hassan Massoudy]].

In modern times the intrinsically calligraphic nature of the written Arabic form is haunted by the thought that a typographic approach to the language, necessary for digitized unification, will not always accurately maintain meanings conveyed through calligraphy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Osborn|first=J.R.|year=2009|title=Narratives of Arabic Script: Calligraphic Design and Modern Spaces|journal=Design and Culture|volume=1|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of different standards for the [[romanization of Arabic]], i.e. methods of accurately and efficiently representing Arabic with the Latin script. There are various conflicting motivations involved, which leads to multiple systems. Some are interested in [[transliteration]], i.e. representing the ''spelling'' of Arabic, while others focus on [[Phonetic transcription|transcription]], i.e. representing the ''pronunciation'' of Arabic. (They differ in that, for example, the same letter {{rtl-lang|ar|[[ي]]}} is used to represent both a consonant, as in "'''y'''ou" or "'''y'''et", and a vowel, as in "m'''e'''" or "'''ea'''t".) Some systems, e.g. for scholarly use, are intended to accurately and unambiguously represent the phonemes of Arabic, generally making the phonetics more explicit than the original word in the Arabic script. These systems are heavily reliant on [[diacritic]]al marks such as "š" for the sound equivalently written ''sh'' in English. Other systems (e.g. the [[Bahá'í orthography]]) are intended to help readers who are neither Arabic speakers nor linguists with intuitive pronunciation of Arabic names and phrases.&lt;ref&gt;Kharusi, N. S. &amp; Salman, A. (2011) The English Transliteration of Place Names in Oman. Journal of Academic and Applied Studies Vol. 1(3) September 2011, pp. 1–27 Available online at www.academians.org&lt;/ref&gt; These less "scientific" systems tend to avoid [[diacritics]] and use [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] (like ''sh'' and ''kh''). These are usually simpler to read, but sacrifice the definiteness of the scientific systems, and may lead to ambiguities, e.g. whether to interpret ''sh'' as a single sound, as in ''gash'', or a combination of two sounds, as in ''gashouse''. The [[ALA-LC]] romanization solves this problem by separating the two sounds with a [[Prime (symbol)|prime]] symbol ( ′ ); e.g., ''as′hal'' 'easier'.

During the last few decades and especially since the 1990s, Western-invented text communication technologies have become prevalent in the Arab world, such as [[personal computer]]s, the [[World Wide Web]], [[email]], [[bulletin board system]]s, [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], [[instant messaging]] and [[mobile phone text messaging]]. Most of these technologies originally had the ability to communicate using the Latin script only, and some of them still do not have the Arabic script as an optional feature. As a result, Arabic speaking users communicated in these technologies by transliterating the Arabic text using the Latin script, sometimes known as IM Arabic.

To handle those Arabic letters that cannot be accurately represented using the Latin script, numerals and other characters were appropriated. For example, the numeral "3" may be used to represent the Arabic letter {{angle bracket|{{rtl-lang|ar|ع}}}}. There is no universal name for this type of transliteration, but some have named it [[Arabic Chat Alphabet]]. Other systems of transliteration exist, such as using dots or capitalization to represent the "emphatic" counterparts of certain consonants. For instance, using capitalization, the letter {{angle bracket|{{rtl-lang|ar|د}}}}, may be represented by '''d'''. Its emphatic counterpart, {{angle bracket|{{rtl-lang|ar|ض}}}}, may be written as '''D'''.

=== Numerals ===
In most of present-day North Africa, the [[Western Arabic numerals]] (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) are used. However, in Egypt and Arabic-speaking countries to the east of it, the [[Eastern Arabic numerals]] ({{script/Arabic|٠}} – {{script/Arabic|١}} – {{script/Arabic|٢}} – {{script/Arabic|٣}} – {{script/Arabic|٤}} – {{script/Arabic|٥}} – {{script/Arabic|٦}} – {{script/Arabic|٧}} – {{script/Arabic|٨}} – {{script/Arabic|٩}}) are in use. When representing a number in Arabic, the lowest-valued [[positional notation|position]] is placed on the right, so the order of positions is the same as in left-to-right scripts. Sequences of digits such as telephone numbers are read from left to right, but numbers are spoken in the traditional Arabic fashion, with units and tens reversed from the modern English usage. For example, 24 is said "four and twenty" just like in the German language (''vierundzwanzig'') and [[Classical Hebrew]], and 1975 is said "a thousand and nine-hundred and five and seventy" or, more eloquently, "a thousand and nine-hundred five seventy"

== Language-standards regulators ==
[[Academy of the Arabic Language (disambiguation)|Academy of the Arabic Language]] is the name of a number of language-regulation bodies formed in the Arab League. The most active are in [[Academy of the Arabic Language in Damascus|Damascus]] and [[Academy of the Arabic Language in Cairo|Cairo]]. They review language development, monitor new words and approve inclusion of new words into their published standard dictionaries. They also publish old and historical Arabic manuscripts.
{{see also|Arabic Language International Council}}

== As a foreign language ==
Arabic has been taught worldwide in many [[elementary school|elementary]] and [[secondary school|secondary]] schools, especially Muslim schools. Universities around the world have classes that teach Arabic as part of their [[Foreign Languages|foreign languages]], [[Middle Eastern studies]], and [[religious studies]] courses. [[Arabic language school]]s exist to assist students to learn Arabic outside the academic world. There are many Arabic [[language school]]s in the Arab world and other [[Muslim world|Muslim]] countries. Because the Quran is written in Arabic and all [[Glossary of Islam|Islamic terms]] are in Arabic, millions{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} of Muslims (both Arab and non-Arab) study the language. Software and books with tapes are also important part of Arabic learning, as many of Arabic learners may live in places where there are no academic or Arabic language school classes available. Radio series of Arabic language classes are also provided from some radio stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quesada|first1=Thomas C.|title=Arabic Keyboard|publisher=Peter Jones|location=Madisonville|page=49|edition=Atlanta|url=https://arabic-keyboard.online|accessdate=11 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927072656/http://www.arc-news.com/read.php?lang=en&amp;id_articol=1059#|archive-date=27 September 2007|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of websites on the [[Internet]] provide online classes for all levels as a means of distance education; most teach Modern Standard Arabic, but some teach regional varieties from numerous countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reviews of Language Courses|url=http://Lang1234.com|publisher=Lang1234|accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arabic speakers and other languages==
[[File:Bahrain classroom.jpg|thumb|In [[Bahrain]], Arabic is largely used in educational settings.]]
With the sole example of Medieval linguist [[Abu Hayyan al-Gharnati]] - who, while a scholar of the Arabic language, was not ethnically Arab - scholars of the Arabic language made no efforts at studying comparative linguistics, considering all other languages inferior.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kees Versteegh]], ''The Arabic Linguistic Tradition'', pg. 106. Part of Landmarks in Linguistic Thought series, vol. 3. [[New York City|New York]]: [[Routledge]], 1997. {{ISBN|978-0-415-15757-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, the educated upper classes in the Arab world have taken a nearly opposite view. [[Yasir Suleiman]] wrote in 2011 that "studying and knowing English or French in most of the Middle East and North Africa have become a badge of sophistication and modernity and ... feigning, or asserting, weakness or lack of facility in Arabic is sometimes paraded as a sign of status, class, and perversely, even education through a mélange of code-switching practises."&lt;ref&gt;Suleiman, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=FQAiPgBRUkoC&amp;pg=PA93 93]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arab-American]] professor Franck Salamah went as far as to declare Arabic a dead language conveying dead ideas, blaming its stagnation for Arab intellectual stagnation and lamenting that great writers in Arabic are judged by their command of the language and not the merit of the ideas they express with it.&lt;ref&gt;Franck Salamah, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BL44ZZwSwbYC&amp;pg=PR16 Language, Memory, and Identity in the Middle East: The Case for Lebanon], Introduction, pg. xvi.

{{Semiotics}}
'''Biosemiotics''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] βίος ''bios'', "life" and σημειωτικός ''sēmeiōtikos'', "observant of signs") is a field of [[semiotics]] and [[biology]] that studies the prelinguistic meaning-making, or production and [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] and [[Code (semiotics)|code]]s&lt;ref&gt;Marcello Barbieri, 2008. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00114-008-0368-x#/ ''Biosemiotics: a new understanding of life''], ''Naturwissenschaften'', Vol. 95, Iss. 7, pp. 577–599&lt;/ref&gt; in the biological realm. Biosemiotics attempts to integrate the findings of biology and semiotics and proposes a [[paradigm shift|paradigmatic shift]] in the scientific view of [[life]], demonstrating that  [[semiosis]] (sign process, including [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] and interpretation) is one of its immanent and intrinsic features. The term ''biosemiotic'' was first used by [[Friedrich S. Rothschild]] in 1962, but [[Thomas Sebeok]] and [[Thure von Uexküll]] have implemented the term and field.&lt;ref&gt;Kull, Kalevi 1999. Biosemiotics in the twentieth century: A view from biology. ''Semiotica'' 127(1/4): 385–414.&lt;/ref&gt; The field, which challenges normative views of biology, is generally divided between theoretical and applied biosemiotics.

==Definition==
Biosemiotics is ''biology interpreted as a sign systems study'', or, to elaborate, a study of 
* [[Sign (semiotics)|signification]], [[communication]] and [[habituation|habit]] formation of [[life|living]] processes 
* [[semiosis]] (changing sign relations) in living nature
* the biological basis of all signs and sign interpretation

==Main branches==
According to the basic types of semiosis under study, biosemiotics can be divided into 
*vegetative semiotics (also '''endosemiotics''', or [[phytosemiotics]]), the study of semiosis at the cellular and molecular level (including the translation processes related to genome and the organic form or phenotype);&lt;ref&gt;Kull, Kalevi 2000. [https://www.academia.edu/3520416/An_introduction_to_phytosemiotics_Semiotic_botany_and_vegetative_sign_systems An introduction to phytosemiotics: Semiotic botany and vegetative sign systems.] ''Sign Systems Studies'' 28: 326–350.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Witzany, Guenther 2008. The biosemiotics of plant communication. ''American Journal for Semiotic Studies'' 24: 39–56.&lt;/ref&gt; vegetative semiosis occurs in all organisms at their cellular and tissue level; vegetative semiotics includes prokaryote semiotics, sign-mediated interactions in bacteria communities such as [[quorum sensing]] and quorum quenching.
*[[zoosemiotics]] or animal semiotics,&lt;ref&gt;[[Timo Maran|Maran, Timo]]; [[Dario Martinelli|Martinelli, Dario]]; [[Aleksei Turovski|Turovski, Aleksei]] (eds.), 2011. ''Readings in Zoosemiotics.'' ([[Semiotics, Communication and Cognition]] 8.). Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt; or the study of animal forms of knowing;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]] 2014. Zoosemiotics is the study of animal forms of knowing. ''Semiotica'' 198: 47–60.[https://www.academia.edu/6116777/Zoosemiotics_is_the_study_of_animal_forms_of_knowing]&lt;/ref&gt; animal semiosis occurs in the organisms with [[neuromuscular]] system, also includes [[anthroposemiotics]], the study of semiotic behavior in humans.

According to the dominant aspect of semiosis under study, the following labels have been used: biopragmatics, biosemantics, and biosyntactics.

==History==
Apart from [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839–1914) and [[Charles W. Morris]] (1903–1979), early pioneers of biosemiotics were [[Jakob von Uexküll]] (1864–1944), [[Heini Hediger]] (1908–1992), [[Giorgio Prodi]] (1928–1987), [[Marcel Florkin]] (1900–1979) and [[Friedrich S. Rothschild]] (1899–1995); the founding fathers of the contemporary interdiscipline were [[Thomas Sebeok]] (1920–2001) and [[Thure von Uexküll]] (1908–2004).&lt;ref&gt;Favareau, D. (ed.) (2010). [https://www.springer.com/life+sciences/book/978-1-4020-9649-5 Essential Readings in Biosemiotics: Anthology and Commentary.] Berlin: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s a circle of mathematicians active in Theoretical Biology, [[René Thom]] ([[Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques]]), Yannick Kergosien ([[Dalhousie University]] and [[Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques]]), and [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen]] ([[Dalhousie University]], also a former member of the Buffalo group with [[Howard H. Pattee]]), explored the relations between Semiotics and Biology using such headings as "Nature Semiotics",&lt;ref&gt;Kergosien, Y. (1985) Sémiotique de la Nature, IVe séminaire de l'Ecole d'automne de Biologie Théorique (Solignac, juin 1984), G. BENCHETRIT éd., C.N.R.S.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kergosien, Y. (1992) Nature Semiotics : The Icons of Nature.  Biosemiotics : The Semiotic Web 1991,  T. Sebeok et J. Umiker -Sebeok (eds), Berlin : Mouton de Gruyter, pp. 145-170&lt;/ref&gt; "Semiophysics",&lt;ref&gt;Thom, R., (1989) Semio physics: a sketch. Redwood City, Calif. : Addison-Wesley Pub. Co.&lt;/ref&gt; or "Anticipatory Systems" &lt;ref&gt;Rosen, R. (1985) Anticipatory systems, Pergamon Press&lt;/ref&gt; and taking a modeling approach.

The contemporary period (as initiated by [[Copenhagen-Tartu school]])&lt;ref&gt;See an account of recent history in: Petrilli, Susan (2011). ''Expression and Interpretation in Language''. Transaction Publishers, pp. 85–92.&lt;/ref&gt; include biologists [[Jesper Hoffmeyer]], [[Kalevi Kull]], [[Claus Emmeche]], [[Terrence Deacon]], semioticians [[Martin Krampen]], [[Marcel Danesi]], philosophers Donald Favareau, [[John Deely]], [[John Collier (reformer)|John Collier]], Guenther Witzany and complex systems scientists [[Howard H. Pattee]], [[Michael Conrad (biologist)|Michael Conrad]], [[Luis M. Rocha]],  [[Cliff Joslyn]] and [[Léon Croizat|León Croizat]].

In 2001, an annual international conference for biosemiotic research known as the '''Gatherings in Biosemiotics'''&lt;ref&gt;Rattasepp, Silver; Bennett, Tyler (eds.) 2012. [https://www.academia.edu/19524232/Tartu_Semiotics_Library_11_Gatherings_in_Biosemiotics ''Gatherings in Biosemiotics'']. (Tartu Semiotics Library 11.) Tartu: University of Tartu Press.&lt;/ref&gt; was inaugurated, and has taken place every year since.

In 2004, a group of biosemioticians – [[Marcello Barbieri]], [[Claus Emmeche]], [[Jesper Hoffmeyer]], [[Kalevi Kull]], and Anton Markos – decided to establish an international journal of biosemiotics. Under their editorship, the ''Journal of Biosemiotics'' was launched by [[Nova Science Publishers]] in 2005 (two issues published), and with the same five editors ''Biosemiotics'' was launched by [[Springer Science|Springer]] in 2008. The book series ''Biosemiotics'' (Springer, since 2007) is edited by [[Jesper Hoffmeyer]], [[Kalevi Kull]], and Alexei Sharov.

The [[International Society for Biosemiotic Studies]] was established in 2005 by Donald Favareau and the five editors listed above.&lt;ref&gt;Favareau, Donald 2005. Founding a world biosemiotics institution: The International Society for Biosemiotic Studies. ''[[Sign Systems Studies]]'' 33(2): 481–485.&lt;/ref&gt; A collective programmatic paper on the basic theses of biosemiotics appeared in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]]; [[Terrence Deacon|Deacon, Terrence]]; [[Claus Emmeche|Emmeche, Claus]]; [[Jesper Hoffmeyer|Hoffmeyer, Jesper]]; Stjernfelt, Frederik 2009.

'''Chilean Sign Language''', or ''Lengua de Señas Chilena'' (LSCh), is the [[deaf sign language|sign language]] of Chile's seven deaf institutions. It is used by people all over Chile and is the primary language used by the deaf community, being used for television interpretations. There is variation within the language depending on factors such as geographical location, age, and educational background.&lt;ref name="Parks"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parks|first=Elizabeth|last2=Parks|first2=Jason|last3=Williams|first3=Holly|date=2011|title=A Sociolinguistic Profile of the Deaf People of Chile|url=http://www.sil.org/system/files/reapdata/38/94/20/38942092294949625251859003265857053622/silesr2011_027.pdf|journal=Sil International|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910053850/http://www.sil.org/system/files/reapdata/38/94/20/38942092294949625251859003265857053622/silesr2011_027.pdf|archivedate=2016-09-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geographic Distributions ==
Mainly spoken all across [[Chile]]

=== Regions ===
* [[Santiago]]
* [[Iquique]]
* [[Puerto Montt]]
* [[Punta Arenas]]

=== Estimated Population Use ===
In 2004, it had been estimated that about 292,700 people (1.8%) of the Chilean population had some type of auditory deficiency. About half of the people with auditory deficiency are over the age of 65. This leaves the estimated amount of users who actually use LSCh at only about 21,000 people.&lt;ref name="Parks" /&gt;

== Recognition and Status ==
There have been many movements to get the Chilean government to try to get LSCh (chilean sign language) regulated within the country. Schools and churches are trying to create more programs to try to encourage deaf leadership training and empowering deaf people to make decisions for their own communities.&lt;ref name="Parks" /&gt;

=== Government Services and Laws ===
There are no government services specifically for sign language and deaf people. Fondo Nacional de la Discapacidad (FONADIS) is the government department responsible for the providing services. There are also no laws to prevent discrimination while applying for jobs, although there is a branch created to look for jobs for deaf people.

=== Education ===
There are about 20 schools spread across Chile geared towards deaf students.&lt;ref name="Parks" /&gt; There is not one system of doing it with different towns doing it differently. For example, in the town of Santiago, students are only identified as speech only or sign only and learn in different environments. Students with implants are identified as speech only.&lt;ref name="Parks" /&gt; There are 4 universities developed for deaf students based on standardized test scores.&lt;ref name="Parks" /&gt; Studies show that out of 17 people, about 10 were taught LSCh through school while the other 7 were either taught by a family member or out of school environments.&lt;ref name="Parks" /&gt;

===Dictionaries===
LSCh has a couple of standard Spanish-to-LSCh dictionaries, such as the ''Diccionario Bilingüe Lengua de Señas Chilena-Español''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mineduc.cl/index2.php?id_seccion=4270&amp;id_portal=20&amp;id_contenido=20646|title=Educación Especial|author=|date=|website=www.mineduc.cl|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151027090519/http://www.mineduc.cl/index2.php?id_portal=20&amp;id_seccion=4270&amp;id_contenido=20646|archivedate=27 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, 30 representatives from all across Chile came together to create a standard dictionary.&lt;ref name="Parks" /&gt;

==Fingerspelling==
The [[manual alphabet]] of LSCh has 27 letters, and, as in many sign languages, is used to spell names and words that do not have standard signs. [[Fingerspelling]] is defined as a visual form that reflects the graphemes that make up words, providing a means by which to gain access to the segmental information of words.&lt;ref name="Puente"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Puente|first=Anibal|last2=Alvarado|first2=Jesus|last3=Herrera|first3=Valeria|date=2006|title=Fingerspelling and Sign Language as Alternative Codes for Reading and Writing Words for Chilean Deaf Signers|url=|journal=American Annals of the Deaf|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been integrated into the deaf community for a variety reasons which include "when a concept lacks a specific sign, for proper nouns, for loan signs, or when signs are ambiguous."&lt;ref name="Puente" /&gt;

'''Common Technical Regulation''' (CTR). In [[telecommunications]], CTR refers to a rule governing the connection of [[terminal equipment]] to [[telephone network|networks]]. CTRs are drawn up, under the provisions of the [[European Union directive|EU directive]] 98/13/EC by the [[Telecommunications research and action center]] (TRAC) and [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]] (ETSI), at the request of ACTE, which is chaired by the [[European Commission]]. These rules apply to all [[List of European Union member states|EU member states]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="99077">A '''drug cartel''' is any [[Organized crime|criminal organization]] with the intention of supplying [[Illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]] operations. They range from loosely managed agreements among various drug traffickers to formalized [[commercial enterprise]]s. The term was applied when the largest trafficking organizations reached an agreement to coordinate the production and distribution of cocaine. Since that agreement was broken up, drug cartels are no longer actually [[cartel]]s, but the term stuck and it is now popularly used to refer to any criminal narcotics related organization.

The basic structure of a drug cartel is as follows:

* Falcons (Spanish: ''Halcones''): Considered the "eyes and ears" of the streets, the "falcons" are the lowest rank in any drug cartel. They are responsible for supervising and reporting the activities of the police, the military, and rival groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Va Marina por 'halcones del crimen organizado|url=http://www.mundonarco.com/2011/04/va-marina-por-halcones-del-crimen.html|newspaper=Blog del Narco|date=21 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827061101/http://www.mundonarco.com/2011/04/va-marina-por-halcones-del-crimen.html|archivedate=27 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Hitmen (Spanish: ''Sicarios''): The armed group within the drug cartel, responsible for carrying out assassinations, kidnappings, thefts, extortions, operating protection rackets, and [[wikt:turf war|defending their ''plaza'' (turf)]] from rival groups and the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bowden|first=Charles|title=El sicario, un documental proscrito en México (1)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7C45xR_48mQ|date=Feb 6, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411020804/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7C45xR_48mQ|archivedate=2016-04-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bowden|first=Charles F|title=El sicario, un documental proscrito en México (2)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDFDxtjGuuI&amp;feature=related|date=Feb 6, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630083554/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDFDxtjGuuI&amp;feature=related|archivedate=2016-06-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lieutenants (Spanish: ''Teniente''): The second highest position in the drug cartel organization, responsible for supervising the hitmen and falcons within their own territory. They are allowed to carry out low-profile murders without permission from their bosses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ejército detiene a lugarteniente del cártel del Golfo|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/602145.html|newspaper=El Universal|date=2 June 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012114558/http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/602145.html|archivedate=12 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Drug lord]]s (Spanish: ''Capos''):  The highest position in any drug cartel, responsible for supervising the entire drug industry, appointing territorial leaders, making alliances, and planning high-profile murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DATOS&amp;nbsp;— Principales capos de la droga en México|url=http://mx.ibtimes.com/articles/6593/20101106/lideres-droga-mexico-narcotrafico.htm|publisher=International Business Times|accessdate=November 6, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120715171715/http://mx.ibtimes.com/articles/6593/20101106/lideres-droga-mexico-narcotrafico.htm|archivedate=July 15, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other operating groups within the drug cartels. For example, the drug producers and suppliers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Uncovering the link between the Mexican drug cartels|journal=National Defense University: Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies|url=http://www.ndu.edu/chds/SRC-peru07/SRC_PAPERS/TRACK%201/VELARDE_SPA%20final.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615194812/http://www.ndu.edu/chds/SRC-peru07/SRC_PAPERS/TRACK%201/VELARDE_SPA%20final.pdf|archivedate=2011-06-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although not considered in the basic structure, are critical operators of any drug cartel, along with the financiers and money launderers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Las 5 caras del lavado de dinero |url=http://www.cnnexpansion.com/economia/2010/06/07/lavado-de-dinero-narco-mexico-eu |newspaper= CNNExpansión |date=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cae 'El Adal' operador financiero de los Zetas |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBEDcgepE6M&amp;feature=channel_video_title |accessdate=3 August 2011 |newspaper=TV Milenio |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110120521/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBEDcgepE6M&amp;feature=channel_video_title |archivedate=10 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cae 'El Míchel' operador financiero de Los Zetas en Aguascalientes |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpM93oU7ICM&amp;feature=related |accessdate=3 August 2011 |newspaper=Tele Diario |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110120525/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpM93oU7ICM&amp;feature=related |archivedate=10 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the arms suppliers operate in a completely different circle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Entrevista a el Mamito, presunto fundador de los Zetas |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HacDTEn2TDs |newspaper=CNN Videos |date=Jul 6, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529140022/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HacDTEn2TDs |archivedate=2016-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are technically not considered part of the cartel's logistics.

=====American Mafia=====
[[Italian-American#The main immigration|Italian immigrants to the United States]] in the early 19th century formed various small-time gangs which gradually evolved into sophisticated crime syndicates which dominated organized crime in America for several decades. Although government crackdowns and a less-tightly knit Italian-American community have largely reduced their power, they remain an active force in the underworld.

The [[yakuza]] of Japan are similar to the Italian mafias in that they originated centuries ago and follow a rigid set of traditions, but have several aspects that make them unique, such as their [[Body suit (tattoo)|full-body tattoos]] and their fairly open place in Japanese society. Many yakuza groups are umbrella organizations, smaller gangs reporting to a larger crime syndicate.

The [[Triad (underground society)|Triads]] is a popular name for a number of Chinese criminal secret societies, which have existed in various forms over the centuries (see for example [[Tiandihui]]). However, not all Chinese gangs fall into line with these traditional groups, as many non-traditional criminal organizations have formed, both in China and the Chinese diaspora.

===Russia===
Although organized crime existed in the Soviet era, the gangs really gained in power and international reach during the [[Perestroika|transition to capitalism]]. The term [[Russian Mafia]], 'mafiya' or mob is a blanket (and somewhat inaccurate) term for the various organized crime groups that emerged in this period from the 15 former republics of the [[USSR]] and unlike their Italian counterparts does not mean members are necessarily of Russian ethnicity or uphold any ancient criminal traditions, although this is the case for some members.

'''Francysk Skaryna''' or '''Francisk Skorina''' ({{lang-be|Францыск (Францішак)&lt;ref&gt;[http://slounik.org/120813.html Чалавек і грамадства: Энцыклапедычны даведнік. Мн: Беларуская Энцыклапедыя, 1998.] {{ISBN|985-11-0108-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Скарына}} {{IPA-be|franˈt͡sɨsk skaˈrɨna|}}; {{lang-lat|Franciscus Scorina}}, {{lang-pl|Franciszek Skaryna}}; {{ca.|1490}} – before 29 January 1552) was a [[Belarusians|Belarusian]] humanist, physician, translator and one of the first [[printing|book printers]] in [[Eastern Europe]], laying the groundwork for the development of the [[Belarusian language]].

== Early life and education ==
Skaryna was born into the family of a wealthy merchant in [[Polotsk|Polatsk]], then a major trade and manufacturing center of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. His older brother, Ivan, was also a merchant. The brothers had a property, possibly ancestral, in Polatsk.&lt;ref name="sokolova1992"&gt;Sokolová Františka. Francisko Skoryna v dile českých slavistů. Sbornik k 500-jubileju narozeni významného bĕloruského humanisty, 1490-1990. – Praha: Narodní knihovna, Slovanská knihovna, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact date of Skaryna's birth is unknown. The year 1490 is often proposed based on the assumption that he was 14 when he came to study in [[Kraków]] in 1504. The date is an upper boundary; while new students younger than 14 were rare, older ones were not unusual, and Skaryna could have started his studies at the age of 18 or even older. N. Shchakacihin suggested that the overlapping sun and moon on Skaryna's personal emblem indicates he was born around the time of the 1486 solar eclipse, which was observed in Polatsk.&lt;ref name = 'nemir'&gt;Е. Немировский. Франциск Скорина. Минск, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|154–156}}

It is conjectured that he received his primary education in Polatsk and possibly partly in Vilnius.&lt;ref name='evkl'&gt;Г. Галенчанка. Скарына, Францыск // Энцыклапедыя ВКЛ, т.3, Мінск, 2007, с. 576.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1504, Skaryna is recorded as a student of [[Jagiellonian University]]. In 1506, he graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree.&lt;ref name = 'evkl'/&gt; In 1512, after passing all required tests, he received a doctorate in medicine at the [[University of Padua]] in [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="dile"&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/35738930/Again_About_Skaryna_in_Padua_New_Possibilities_of_Reading_the_Old_Documents._In_Three_Parts_Time_and_Context_Circumstances_Attendees._Belarusian_Review._Winter_2014_vol._26_No._4._P._17-23_Spring_2015_vol._27_No_1._P._23_ Shutova, Olga.

P. 21-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The records suggest that he requested to take his examination in Padua but had not studied in the city. Earlier, he obtained an "artium doctor" degree, but the exact date and place are unknown.

== Later life ==
Skaryna arrived in [[Prague]] by 1517. According to one hypothesis, he had been a student of [[Charles University]] in Prague, but there is no documentary evidence. In the same year, he rented the [[printing house]] from merchant Severin&lt;ref name="voit2015"&gt;[https://biblioteka.vu.lt/publikacijos/VU-bibliotekos-metrastis-2015.pdf Войт Пётр.

On 6 August 1517, his first edition was released in the Old Belarusian (Old Ruthenian): “The Psalter”. “The Psalter” nearly comprises all, what was in other biblical books of [[Holy Scripture]]. “It contains everything people needed for the welfare of human life on earth.” Then he released a new book every two months (10 September, 6 October, 5 December, 2 January 1518, 9 January, 19 January). Then, on the 10th of August, he published four books at the same time. The culmination of his life's work was printing a translation of the [[Bible]] in twenty-three books during 1517 to 1519.&lt;ref name="galenchanka1993"&gt;Галенчанка Г. Я.

In 1520, Skaryna became involved in combating an epidemic of a deadly disease in Prague. The epidemic subsided later that year but civil unrest broke out in the autumn in Bohemia. Skaryna left the country and moved to [[Vilnius]], the capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

In 1522, Skaryna opened the first printing house in Vilnius. Initially he published “The Little Travel Book”. Then in 1525 “Apostol” was published.  "Apostol" was released in the same order as it is used in [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] worship now.&lt;ref name="galenchanka1993" /&gt;

In the late 1520s or early 1530s, he visited [[Moscow]]. He wished to distribute his books in Moscow but was unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="shutova2017"&gt;[https://skaryna.com/en/shutova-francysk-skaryna-thevet-fletcher-voyage-to-moscow Шутова Ольга. «Уликовая» парадигма в историографии: новые возможности исследования биографии Франциска Скорины.] In ''Францыск Скарына: асоба, дзейнасць, спадчына'' / Цэнтр. навук. б-ка імя Якуба Коласа Нац. акад. навук Беларусі ; уклад. Аляксандр Груша; рэдкал.: Л. А. Аўгуль [і інш.]. – Мінск : Беларуская навука, 2017. С. 74-102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Skaryna married Margarita, the widow of a Vilnius city councilor. In 1529, following his brother's death, he went to [[Poznań]] and obtained a share of Ivan's property. In 1530, he moved with his wife to [[Königsberg]] but they soon returned to Vilnius. The 1530 fire in Vilnius destroyed three-quarters of the city, probably including Skaryna's publishing house.

In 1532, he worked as a doctor and secretary of [[John of the Lithuanian Dukes|John, Bishop in Vilnius]]. After two years creditors of his brother Ivan considered Skaryna as the main brother’s heir and put him into Pazan jail. He was there for several months. Roman Skaryna, Ivan's son and Francysk’s nephew, actively helped his uncle in this situation. Roman had a meeting with the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://strannik.tv/skorina-dok.htm#ex25 |title=Актовая запись об установлении уполномоченного для кредитора ИВАНА СКОРИНЫ от 12 апреля 1532 г., г. Познань |publisher=Strannik.tv |date= |accessdate=2013-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Skaryna was released he sent a complaint letter with a counterclaim against the creditors to the [[Sigismund I the Old|King Sigismund I]]. Later in the response to the complaint letter, he was awarded two royal privilege certificates (from 21 November and 25 November 1532). Those certificates exempted him from the jurisdiction of all authorities except the King.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://strannik.tv/skorina-dok.htm#ex33Первая |title=привелигированная грамота короля ПОЛЬШИ И Великого князя ЛИТОВСКОГО СИГИЗМУНДА I в защиту Ф.

The last information about Skaryna is mentioned only in the archives of 1534. He moved from Vilnius to Prague. Probably he served in the royal garden in Prague until his death.&lt;ref name="sokolova1992" /&gt;{{rp|163}} According to some theories, Skaryna taught as a professor at the Charles University in Prague. It is possible however it is not a fact. Presumably he died in 1551 or 1552.

In 1552, his son Simeon Rus Skaryna got a royal certificate according to which he, as the sole heir, was given all the property of his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://strannik.tv/skorina-dok.htm#ex45 |title=Доверительная грамота короля ФЕРДИНАНДА I, выданная сыну Ф. СКОРИНЫ СИМЕОНУ от 29 января 1552 г., г. Прага |publisher=Strannik.tv |date= |accessdate=2013-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The property included manuscripts, letters and books.

==Religion==
It is not known for sure whether Skaryna was [[Catholic]] or [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]]. His name is Catholic, but it is often suggested that he changed it before entering the university. A single copy of a document in which he is called ''Georgius Franciscus'' instead of just ''Franciscus'' gave birth to a theory that ''Georgius'' was his original name; today, however, it is mostly accepted to be a scribe's error (the presumed correct reading being ''egregius Franciscus'', ''venerable Francysk''). In any case the once popular theory that he changed his name from ''Georgius'' to ''Franciscus'' to be able to enter the university is without ground: the name ''Georgius'' was equally popular among the Catholic and the Orthodox in the region, and in fact in Skaryna's year there were more students named ''Georgius'' than ''Franciscus'' in Kraków.&lt;ref name = 'nemir'/&gt;{{rp|157}}

In 1552, after Skaryna's death (and long after his final departure from the country) king [[Sigismund August]] mentioned in a letter that a man from his country printed a translation of the Bible and tried to sell his edition in Moscow, the books were burned there because they were produced "by a subject of the Roman Church". The books mentioned in the letter are most probably Skaryna's.&lt;ref name = 'nemir'/&gt;{{rp|488}}

==Publishing activities==
Skaryna devoted his life to the publication of the biblical texts. He sought to make the [[Bible]] more available to the common people and write it in an easy language. Skaryna also composed prefaces to his editions, in which he emphasized that the purpose of his publishing activities is to help ordinary people "become acquainted with wisdom and science". He contributed to the development of the Belarusian literary language. This Bible became the second printed Bible in the Slavic world, following the publication of a Czech edition.&lt;ref&gt;История Беларуси : вторая половина XIII — первая половина XVI в. : учеб. пособие для 7-го кл. общеобразоват. учреждений с рус. яз. обучения / Г. В. Штыхов, Ю. Н. Бохан, М. А. Краснова ; под ред. Ю. Н. Бохана. — Минск: Нар. асвета, 2009.{{ISBN|978-985-03-1189-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
In  1517 Skaryna started his publishing  career in Prague. He printed his Psalter, and then twenty-two books of the [[Old Testament]] under the common name ''Biblia Ruska.'' His books were not very characteristic for the West European printed [[Bibles]] of that time. The reason is that all of them are published in the format of a fourth part of a leaf [quarto?]. Texts of the Bible are printed in the [[Church Slavonic]] language with a large amount of [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] words. More than that Belarusian linguists can identify the influence of the [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Czech language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nlb.by/portal/page/portal/index/content?lang=en&amp;classId=EE3E6D8BBF0848008567B56DC20D828C FRANCISK SKORINA: A JOURNEY TO THE FATHERLAND]&lt;/ref&gt;

Skaryna's Bible breaks the existing rules of that time. It contains text from the publisher, his comments, forewords and afterwords. In addition it contains prints with his image. It is the first such case and the last in the history of the publication of Bibles in [[Eastern Europe]].

All Skaryna’s editions are very rare, especially those published in Vilnius. Copies are stored in libraries in [[Minsk]], [[Moscow]], [[St. Petersburg]], [[Kiev]], [[Vilnius]], [[Lviv]], [[London]], [[Prague]], [[Copenhagen]], and [[Kraków]].

==Legacy==
Skaryna was one of the first to publish in the [[Cyrillic script]], but not the first, as the ''[[Oktoikh, 1491|Oktoikh]]'' was published by [[Schweipolt Fiol]] in 1491.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/portal/libraries/Libraries.php?launch=1&amp;language=en&amp;page=Treasures&amp;country=Russia-Moscow Treasures of the National Library - Moscow], retrieved on November 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; While it was an [[East Slavic languages|Eastern Slavic language]], it is difficult to determine precisely what language he used as there was no conventional Belarusian language as we know it today. Some researchers maintain that Skaryna's books were in [[Church Slavonic]] heavily saturated with [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]]. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that Skaryna laid the foundations of the Belarusian literary language.

Some Belarusian scholars see Skaryna as a Renaissance man, on par with Copernicus and Erasmus, whose work was a part of European Reformation in the Slavic lands.&lt;ref&gt;450 год беларускага кнігадрукавання. Рэд. К. Крапіва. Мінск, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], [[Minsk]], the capital of [[Belarus]], had Skaryna Avenue (''praspiekt Franciška Skaryny''). However, in 2005, under the rule of [[Alexander Lukashenko]], it was renamed into Independence Avenue (''praspekt Nezalezhnastsi''). The Old [[Barysau]] Path (''Starabarysauski trakt'') was renamed into Skaryna Street (''vulica Skaryny'').

Two awards presented by Belarus were named in honor of Skaryna: the [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Belarus#Medals|Medal of Francysk Skaryna]] and [[Order of Francysk Skaryna]].

Several cultural organizations are named after Skaryna, particularly the [[Frantsishak Skaryna Belarusian Language Society]] and the [[Francis Skaryna Belarusian Library and Museum]], London.

'''Gilbert Harman''' (born 1938) is an [[United States|American]] [[philosopher]], who taught at [[Princeton University]] from 1963 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S16/18/71C28/ |title=Like father, like daughter: Family ties bind philosophers |first=Jennifer Greenstein |last=Altmann |publisher=Princeton University |date=26 Oct 2006 |accessdate=31 Dec 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; until his retirement in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://philosophy.princeton.edu/content/gilbert-harman&lt;/ref&gt;  He has published widely in philosophy of language, cognitive science, philosophy of mind, ethics, moral psychology, epistemology, statistical learning theory, and metaphysics.  He and [[George Armitage Miller|George Miller]] co-directed the Princeton University Cognitive Science Laboratory.  Harman has taught or co-taught courses in Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Psychology, Philosophy, and Linguistics.

==Education and career==
Harman has a BA from [[Swarthmore College]] and a Ph.D. from [[Harvard University]], where he was supervised by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]].  He taught at Princeton from 1963 until his retirement in 2017 as the James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor in Philosophy.  He has been named a Fellow of the Cognitive Science Society and a Fellow of the Association for Psychological Science.  He is also a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences]].  He received the [[Jean Nicod Prize]] in Paris in 2005.  In 2009 he received Princeton University's Behrman award for distinguished achievement in the humanities.  His acceptance speech was titled "We need a linguistics department."

Some of his well-known PhD students include [[Graham Oppy]], [[Stephen Stich]], [[Joshua Greene (psychologist)|Joshua Greene]], [[Joshua Knobe]], [[David Wong (philosopher)|David Wong]], [[Richard Joyce (philosopher)|Richard Joyce]], James Dreier, and Nicholas Sturgeon.

His daughter [[Elizabeth Harman (philosopher)|Elizabeth Harman]] is also a philosopher and a member of the philosophy department and the Center for Human Values at Princeton University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Elizabeth Harman joins father on the philosophy faculty - 10/23/2006 - PWB - Princeton |url=https://pr.princeton.edu/pwb/06/1023/3a.shtml |website=Princeton University |accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epistemology ==

Harman's 1965 account of the role of "inference to the best explanation"—inferring the existence of that which we need for the best explanation of observable phenomena—has been very influential.  In later work, he argued that all inference or reasoning should be conceived as rational "change in view," balancing conservatism against coherence, where simplicity and explanatory considerations are relevant to positive coherence and where avoiding inconsistency is relevant to negative coherence.  He has expressed doubts about appeals to a priori knowledge and has argued that logic and decision theory are theories of implication and consistency and should not be interpreted as theories that can be followed: they are not theories of inference or reasoning.

In ''Thought'' and ''Change in View'' Harman argued that intuitions about knowledge are useful in thinking about inference.  More recently, he and Brett Sherman have suggested that knowledge can rest on assumptions that are not themselves known.  He and Sanjeev Kulkarni have suggested that elementary statistical learning theory offers a kind of response to the philosophical problem of induction.

== Mind ==

Harman has also argued that perceptual experience has "intentional content" and that it is important not to confuse qualities of the intentional object of experience with qualities of the experience.  Perceivers are only aware of qualities that are presented to them in experience, as opposed to properties of experience that represent what we experience as a kind of mental paint.

He has also proposed that perceptual and other psychological states are self-reflective so that the content of a perceptual experience might be: this very experience is the result of perceiving a tree with such and such features (except that the experience is not in language).  The content of an intention might be: this very intention will lead me to go home by six o'clock.

== Ethics ==

In "The Nature of Morality," Harman, relying on inference to the best explanation, argued that there are no objective moral facts because we do not need such facts to explain our moral judgments. He has argued that there is not a single true morality.  In that respect, [[moral relativism]] is true.  (This sort of moral relativism is not a theory about what ordinary people mean by their moral judgments.)

Harman has rejected attempts to base moral theory on conceptions of human flourishing and character traits and has expressed skepticism about the need for a good person to be susceptible to moral guilt or shame.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5394">'''Gustav Höcker''' (28 September 1832 - 11 October 1911) was a [[German people|German]] [[author]] and [[translator]] of popular historical novels.

==Biography==
Gustav Höcker was born on 28 September 1832 in a suburb of [[Eilenburg]]. His father was a [[colorist]] in the textile industry, and his younger brother was [[Oskar Höcker]], who also became a writer. He spent his childhood in Eilenburg, an early industrial center, and received his secondary education in [[Chemnitz]]. Until the age of 26 he was, against his will, a merchant (in 1862 he published ''Kaufmännische Carrieren: Wahrheit und Dichtung aus dem Geschäftsleben'', inspired by his career in trade), an occupation he left to become a professional writer.

Höcker made a name for himself as a writer of narratives, many of which recount the events of the nineteenth century. He published studies and biographies of drama authors and politicians, and of musicians such as [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], [[Joseph Haydn]], and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Botstein|first=Leon|title=Haydn Studies|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge UP|isbn=978-0-521-02835-6|pages=1–34|editor=W.

He spent much of his life in [[Karlsruhe]], and died in [[Breslau]] on 11 October 1911.

He attained a measure of commercial success with adaptations of novels in English, including novels by [[James Fenimore Cooper]] (''[[The Deerslayer]]'' and two collections of adapted "[[Leatherstocking Tales]]"), [[Robert Montgomery Bird]] (''[[Nick of the Woods]]''), and [[Daniel Defoe]] (''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jugendbuch-Autoren: H|url=http://www.abenteuerroman.info/kurz/autorlst.htm|publisher=Jugendbücher: Abenteuerromane des 19.

'''Ivan Grigoryevich Istomin''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Иван Григорьевич Истомин}}; February 7, 1917 – 1988)  was a [[Nenets people|Nenets]] and [[Komi peoples|Komi]] writer.

== Personal life ==
Istomin was born into a family of Komi fishermen. In 1934, he graduated from the seven-year middle school in Muzhi. He graduated with distinction from the national pedagogical institute in [[Salekhard]] four years later, in 1938. While studying at the pedagogical institute, he helped organize the institute’s [[literary society]].

== Career ==
From 1938 to 1950, he taught [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Nenets language|Nenets]] and drawing at schools in the [[Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug]]. After that, he worked as the sub-editor for the Nenets-language newspaper "Nyaryana Ngerm". In 1955, he was admitted to the [[Soviet Union of Writers]]. From 1958 to 1965, he served as the assistant managing editor of national literature at the Tyumen Publishing House.

In 1936, a local newspaper published his first poem ”Reindeer”. Later on, his poems and short stories were published in literary magazines such as ''Siberian Lights'', ''Druzhba Narodov'', ''Ural'', ''Neva'', ''Voyvyv kodzuv''. In 1953, ''Our North'', Istomin’s first anthology of  [[Nenets language|Nenets]] poems, was published as a stand-alone edition. Since then, more than 20 editions of his short stories, novellas, and novels, including his novels ''Zhivun'' and ''Vstany-trava,'' have been published in Russian, Nenets and Komi. In addition to his literary talents, Istomin also studied painting and two of his paintings are on display in the local museum in Salehkard.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9830">'''Jewish Koine Greek''', or '''Jewish Hellenistic Greek''', is the variety of [[Koine Greek]] or "common Attic" found in a number of Alexandrian dialect texts of [[Hellenistic Judaism]], most notably in the [[Septuagint]] translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] and associated literature, as well as in Greek Jewish texts from Palestine. The term is largely equivalent with '''Greek of the Septuagint''' as a cultural and literary rather than a linguistic category. The minor syntax and vocabulary variations in the Koine Greek of Jewish authors are not as linguistically distinctive as the later language [[Yevanic]], or [[Judeo-Greek]], spoken by the [[Romaniotes]] Jews in Greece.

The term "Jewish Koine" is to be distinguished from the concept of a "Jewish koine" as a literary-religious, not a linguistic concept.&lt;ref&gt;
Matthew Kraus ''How should rabbinic literature be read in the modern world?'' 2006, page 214. "It is suggestive of a “Jewish koine” that stretched beyond the frontiers of Jewish Palestine.50 Interpretations of biblical narrative scenes have also been discovered in the Land of Israel. The visit of the angels to Abraham was found at Sepphoris "
&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of scholarship==
Primary work on this area was conducted by scholars such as [[Henry Barclay Swete]] in chapter 4 of his ''Introduction to the Old Testament in Greek''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Barclay Swete]] ''Introduction to the Old Testament in Greek'' [http://christianbookshelf.org/swete/an_introduction_to_the_old_testament_in_greek_additional_notes/chapter_iv_the_greek_of.htm#1 Chapter 4: The Greek of the Septuagint]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Swete's emphasis on the peculiarity of the Greek of the Septuagint compared to other Greek texts of the period has largely been retracted by later scholars as plentiful non-Jewish Koine domestic and administrative papyri and inscriptions have been better recovered and studied. Since Swete the equation of Jewish common Attic with the "Greek of the Septuagint" has also been broadened, placing the Septuagint in the context of a wide range of Jewish texts of the period, most recently including the Greek texts among the [[Dead Sea scrolls]].&lt;ref&gt;W. D. Davies, Louis Finkelstein ''The Cambridge History of Judaism: Volume 2, The Hellenistic Age'' 1990 Page 105 "Even in the expression of central theological concepts, such as that of love or that of the 'people' (of God), the LXX commonly uses the general terminology of its own time.1 Good examples of fairly colloquial Jewish koine can also be found in non-canonical writings like Joseph and Asenath or the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs... Nevertheless the LXX has something of a local atmosphere belonging to Alexandria. Some terms, especially those representing things and places known in Egypt, are rendered with customary words of the contemporary Egyptian linguistic usage; ... in Egypt, has effected the viability of certain choices of rendering in the LXX;1 but these are essentially a minor element in the ... Much more important is the Semitic influence upon the Greek of those biblical books which were translated from Hebrew (or Aramaic)"&lt;/ref&gt;

No ancient or medieval writer recognizes a distinct Jewish dialect of Greek.&lt;ref&gt;A.-F. Christidis  A History of Ancient Greek: From the Beginnings to Late Antiquity – Page 640 2007 "No ancient or medieval writer recognizes a distinct Jewish dialect of Greek. In particular, Jews themselves have no name for any “Jewish- Greek” idiolect (contrast later terms like Yiddish [Judeo-German] or Judezmo [Judeo-Spanish])."&lt;/ref&gt; General academic consensus is that the Greek used in the Jewish Koine Greek texts does not differ significantly enough from pagan Koine Greek texts to be described as "Jewish Greek." This also applies to the [[language of the New Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam B. Jacobsen –  Proceedings of the 20th International Congress of Papyrologists Page 57 1994  "Mark does reflect Semitic interference in certain regards (loan-word borrowings, semantics), but his syntax and style are largely free of it.39 While the editor of P.Yadin does not speak of a 'Jewish dialect' of Greek, I believe that in his ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chang-Wook Jung ''The Original Language of the Lukan Infancy Narrative'' 2004– Page 11 "... or at other times 'a special Jewish dialect of Greek'. Cadbury declares with certainty that no spoken Greek by the Jews existed which 'differed extensively and uniformly from the language of other nationals'. He concedes that there are some ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry Joel Cadbury The making of Luke-Acts – Page 116  1968 "Septuagint and other Jewish Greek writings as well, seemed to represent a distinct dialect of Greek. The differences between the sacred writers were less than those which existed between all of them taken together and pagan Greek, whether the ... there is no evidence that Jews spoke a Greek that differed extensively and uniformly from the language of other nationals."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John M. Court -Revelation – Page 87 1995 "It is a first-century CE Jewish dialect of Greek, as used in Palestine ('distinguishable dialect of spoken and written Jewish Greek' — Nigel Turner; 'while he writes in Greek, he thinks in Hebrew' — R.H. Charles; 'Greek language... little more ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the dominant influence of the Septuagint the [[Apostolic Fathers|first documents of "Christian Greek"]] and early [[Church Fathers#Greek Fathers|"Patristic Greek"]] are both an extension of classical Greek on the one hand, and of biblical and Jewish-Hellenistic Greek on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Natalio Fernández Marcos ''The Septuagint in Context: Introduction to the Greek Version of ... '' Page 343- 2000 "Christian Greek has to be studied as an extension of classical Greek on the one hand, and of biblical and Jewish-Hellenistic Greek on the other. Generally, it seems clear that it has fewer neologisms than Christian Latin.24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christine Mohrmann  Études sur le latin des chrétiens – Volume 3 Page 195  1965 "Early Christian Greek has, as point of departure, the Jewish-Hellenistic Greek of the Septuagint. During the first two centuries, Early Christian Greek develops very rapidly, and is distinguished from the general koinè by numerous semantic "&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a thousand years later did there arise a true Jewish dialect of Greek, [[Yevanic]].&lt;ref&gt;E. A. Judge, James R. Harrison ''The First Christians in the Roman World'' Page 370 " ... powerful Jewish community in Alexandria imprinted itself on the koine as seen in Egyptian papyri should also be carefully checked in the light of these cautions.9 A thousand years later there did arise a true Jewish dialect of Greek, Yevanic, ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven M. Lowenstein ''The Jewish Cultural Tapestry: International Jewish Folk Traditions – Page 19 – 2002 "From 3000 to 5000 Jews in the Yanina region (Epirus) of northern Greece who spoke a Jewish dialect of Greek, unlike the other Greek Jews, who spoke Judeo-Spanish (see group 3). 9. From 1500 to 2000 Jews of Cochin in southern India, ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
[[Koine Greek grammar]] already departs from earlier Greek grammar in several areas, but the Jewish texts are generally consistent with Gentile texts, with the exception of a small number of [[Koine Greek grammar|grammatical semitisms]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Milgrom, David Pearson Wright, David Noel Freedman ''Pomegranates and Golden Bells: Studies in Biblical, Jewish, and ... '' 1995  Page 808 "On the pronounced [[paratactic]] character of the Jewish Koine, influenced by both popular Greek and Semitic Hebrew and Aramaic, see F. Blass and A. Debrunner, A Greek Grammar of the New Testament (trans. and rev. R. W. Funk: Chicago: ..."&lt;/ref&gt; As would be expected many Jewish texts show virtually no departures from the Koine or "common Attic" used by Gentile authors. Authors writing for Gentile audiences such as [[Josephus]] and [[Philo of Alexandria]] observe a standard of Greek grammar well above that of many surviving pagan sources.

==Neologisms==
A major difference between the Septuagint, and associated literature, and contemporary non-Jewish Koine texts is the presence of a number of pure [[neologism]]s (new coinages) or new usage of vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Katrin Hauspie, ''Neologisms in the Septuagint of Ezekiel. 17–37.'' JNSL 27/1 in Journal of Northwest Semitic Languages – Universiteit van Stellenbosch&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johan Lust, Erik Eynikel and Katrin Hauspie. ''Greek-English Lexicon of the Septuagint'' 2008 Preface&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. Muraoka ''A Greek-English Lexicon of the Septuagint'' 2009 {{ISBN|978-90-429-2248-8}} Preface to the 3rd Edition&lt;/ref&gt; However [[hapax legomena]] may not always indicate neologisms, given the specialist subject matter of the Septuagint.&lt;ref&gt;The Greek and Hebrew Bible: Collected Essays on the Septuagint – Volume 72 – Page 140 ed. Emanuel Tov "There is another reason for a cautious use of the label 'neologism': a word described as a neologism on the basis of our present knowledge may, in fact, be contained in an as yet unpublished papyrus fragment or the word may never have been used in written language."&lt;/ref&gt; Also some of the "neologisms" of the Septuagint are not totally new coinages and may be combinations of existing terms as ''Neubildungen'' in German, such as the large number of [[compound word]]s representing two or more Hebrew words.&lt;ref&gt;Tov "...Neubildungen is more precise..."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===
* ''sabbatizo'' (σαββατίζω): "(I) keep the sabbath"
* ''pseudoprophetes'' ({{lang|grc|ψευδοπροφήτης}}): "false prophet" (classical texts use {{lang|grc|ψευδόμαντις}} ''pseudomantis'')

'''Ludic''', or ''Ludian'', or ''Ludic Karelian'' (''Luudi, Lyydi'' or ''lüüdi''), is a [[Finnic language]] in the [[Uralic language family]]. It is transitional between the [[Olonets Karelian language]] and the [[Veps language]].&lt;ref name=e18/&gt; It originated as a northern dialect of Veps transformed under heavy Karelian influence.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} It is spoken by 3,000 [[Karelians]] in the [[Republic of Karelia]] in [[Russia]], near the northwestern shore of [[Lake Onega]], including a few children.

==Classification==
In the Finnish research tradition, Ludic has been considered, on historical grounds, a transitional dialect area between Karelian and Veps, while in the Russian research tradition it is, on [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] grounds, normally considered a dialect of Karelian. A status as an independent language has been proposed in recent times.{{sfn|Pahomov|2011|p=10}} Ludic is characterised by a specific mixture of Karelian-like traits (such as the diphthongisation of the [[Proto-Finnic]] non-open long vowels: e.g. *pää &gt; ''piä'' 'head', *soo &gt; ''suo'' 'swamp', contrast Veps ''pä'', ''so''){{sfn|Pahomov|2011|p=29}} and Veps-like traits (such as an almost complete loss of [[consonant gradation]]).{{sfn|Pahomov|2011|p=32}}

===Dialects===
Ludic comprises three main dialect groups:{{sfn|Pahomov|2011|p=10}}
* Northern (Lake) Ludic, at the northwestern shores of [[Lake Onega]]
* Central (River) Ludic, at settlements along river [[Shuya River (Karelia)|Shuya]] and near the city of [[Petrozavodsk]]
* Kuďäŕv (Forest) Ludic, in the [[Mikhaylovskoye, Republic of Karelia|Mikhaylovskoye]] rural locality
The strongest Karelian influence is found in Northern Ludic, while the Kuďäŕv dialect shares the most features with Veps.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3426">'''Magsud Mammadibrahim oglu Ibrahimbeyov''', also spelled '''Ibragimbekov''' ({{lang-az|Maqsud İbrahimbəyov}}; 11 May 1935 – 22 March 2016), was an [[Azerbaijan]]i writer and member of the [[National Assembly of Azerbaijan]].

==Life and contributions==
Ibrahimbeyov was born in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]] to Mammad Ibrahimbeyov and Fatima Meshadibeyova. He was the older brother of [[Rustam Ibragimbekov]], a prominent [[Russia]]n screenwriter. In 1960, he received a B.A. in Industrial and Civil Construction from [[Baku Polytechnical Institute]]. He later worked at the [[Azerbaijan SSR]] Ministry of Construction and tried himself as a reporter representing Azerbaijan at the All-Union Radio and Television.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.eurasianhome.org/xml/t/databases.xml?lang=ru&amp;nic=databases&amp;letter=m&amp;person=568 Magsud Ibrahimbeyov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927045429/http://www.eurasianhome.org/xml/t/databases.xml?lang=ru&amp;nic=databases&amp;letter=m&amp;person=568 |date=2007-09-27 }}. ''Eurasianhome.org''&lt;/ref&gt; At this stage he began focusing on literary studies and attended courses for advanced screenwriting and directing in [[Moscow]] from 1960 until 1964. Since
After that time he became known as a [[Russophone]] [[Azerbaijan]]i writer. Some of his plays were later acted out in theatres throughout the [[USSR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.peoples.ru/art/literature/prose/roman/ibragimbekov/ Magsud Ibrahimbeyov]. ''Peoples.ru''&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote screenplays for 12 feature-length movies and 11 documentary films.

==Politics and criticism==
Magsud Ibrahimbeyov entered politics in 1985. He was elected to the National Assembly of Azerbaijan twice: in 2000 and in 2004. Even though during the elections he ran as an independent candidate, he was known for his extreme loyalty to the ruling [[New Azerbaijan Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.ng.ru/saturday/2005-05-13/13_ibragimbekov.html Magsud Ibrahimbeyov's Big Joy] by Georgi Zaslavsky. ''Nezavisimaya Gazeta''. 13 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; When in 2005 an independent Azerbaijani journalist [[Elmar Huseynov]] (famous for his criticism of Azerbaijani authorities) was murdered, Ibrahimbeyov refused to stand in his memory during a minute of silence in the Azerbaijani parliament, which provoked severe criticism and hostility towards him.

'''Manyika''' is a dialect of the [[Shona language]] largely spoken by the Manyika people in the eastern part of [[Zimbabwe]] and across the border in [[Mozambique]]. It includes dialects ChiBocha, ChiUngwe, and ChiManyika, from which the broad Manyika language gets its name.

ChiManyika is spoken by people in the northern parts of Manicaland Province of Zimbabwe, (Nyanga, Honde Valley Mutasa area) whilst ChiBocha is spoken by people in the southern part of Manicaland. Manyika differs from the more predominant [[Zezuru]] dialect in a variety of small ways.

==Characteristics==
Certain variations in vocabulary and word prefixes exist. For example, the prefix 'va-' (used in Shona before male names to signify seniority and respect) is replaced by 'sa-' in the Manyika language. Also the prefix 'va-' used as in people, for example standard Shona ''vanhu vakaenda vakawanda'', is replaced by 'wa-' to become ''wanhu wakaenda wakawanda''. As a result, the Manyika do not use the prefix 'va' in any form as they pronounce it as either 'sa' or 'wa'. This is how they are generally recognised as being Manyika.

The verbs in this language are tonally divided into two groups. The tonal patterns of the verbs belonging to one group are as shown below in the case of the infinitive, which has ku- as its prefix:
*''kupá'' 'to give', ''kubátá'' 'to catch', ''kupómérá'' 'to scold', ''kukúrúdzíra'' 'to encourage';
*''kumúpá'' 'to give him (something)', ''kumúbátá'' 'to catch him', ''kumúpómérá'', ''kumúkúrúdzíra'';
*''kuzvípa'' 'to give (something to) oneself', ''kuzvíbatá'' 'to catch oneself', ''kuzvípomerá'', ''kuzvíkurudzirá''.

These tonal patterns can be represented by kuCV’CV’CV’X, kuÓCV’CV’CV’X, kuŔXCá, where X stands for a string of phonemes of any length, O for an object prefix, and R for a reflexive prefix, with an adjustment rule to the first two formulae that if X=Ø, the last CV’ can be Ø, and if both are Ø, the second CV’ can also be Ø, and with one to the last formula that if X=Ø, Cá becomes Ca.

The tonal patterns of the verbs belonging to the other group are as shown below:
*''kubwa'' 'to leave', ''kumutsa'' 'to wake up', ''kutarisa'' 'to look at', ''kuswatanudza'' 'to make (somebody) stand up';
*''kumúmútsa'', ''kumútárisa'', ''kumúswátanudza'';
*''kuzvímutsá'', ''kuzvítarisá'', ''kuzvíswatanudzá''.

The tonal representation would be: kuX, kuÓCV’X, kuŔXCá.

This language has many indicative tenses (such as Remote Past, Recent Past, Past Progressive, Present, etc.) including negative ones.

'''Maria Elsa da Rocha''' was a Goan short-story writer and poet in Portuguese.

==Life==

Maria Elsa da Rocha was a school teacher by profession, which took her all over [[Goa]] (and [[Damão]]). The experiences she accrued would feed into her stories, which were also often based on hearsay and anecdotes.

==Works==

Throughout the 1960s, Rocha contributed short stories to the [[Margão]]-based Portuguese language newspaper ''A Vida'', in which she co-edited a cultural page together, and the Portuguese-language programme 'Renascença' broadcast on All-India Radio.

In 2005 a collection of her short stories appeared under the title ''Vivências Partilhadas'' [Shared Lives].&lt;ref&gt;Panjim, Goa: Third Millennium, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vivências Partilhadas===

''Vivências Partilhadas'' provides widest range of representations of the Goan subaltern in Portuguese-language Goan literature post-1961, with a particular focus on the experiences of women,&lt;ref&gt;Paul Melo e Castro, 'How the Other Half Live: The Goan Subaltern in the Stories of Vimala Devi, Maria Elsa da Rocha and Epitácio Pais', in Portuguese Language and Literature in Goa: Past, Present and Future, Carmo D'Souza (ed.), Margão, India: CinnamonTeal, 2014, pp.26-32.&lt;/ref&gt; though this deep-seated sympathy at times appears to be at cross-purposes with a certain social conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;Hélder Garmes and Paul Melo e Castro 'Lirismo e Conservadorismo na Arena Política: o conto "Shivá, brincando..." da escritora goesa Maria Elsa da Rocha'. ''Revista Abril'', 4.6 (2011), pp.77-87&lt;/ref&gt; Rocha's writing is notable for the use she makes of particularly Goan-inflected Portuguese and the considerable use of Konkani in her dialogues.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4151">A '''money shot''' is a moving or stationary visual element of a [[film]], [[video]], [[broadcast television|television broadcast]], or [[print media|print publication]] that is disproportionately expensive to produce or is perceived as essential to the overall importance or revenue-generating potential of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patches|first1=Matt|title=We’re Living in the Age of the Movie Trailer Money Shot|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/07/brief-history-of-the-movie-trailer-money-shot.html|website=Vulture|accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cinema==
Originally, in general film-making usage, the "money shot" was simply the scene that cost the most money to produce.&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt; In general, a money shot (also called a ''money-making shot''&lt;ref&gt;From the "Filmmaker's Dictionary" by Ralph S. Singleton and James A. Conrad, edited by Janna Wong Heatly, (2nd edition, 2000, Lone Eagle Publishing Co., Hollywood, California).&lt;/ref&gt;) is a provocative, sensational, or memorable sequence in a film, on which the film's commercial performance is perceived to depend.&lt;ref&gt;"Money Shot". Oxford English Dictionary Online.&lt;/ref&gt; The scene may or may not be a [[special effects|special-effects]] sequence, but may be counted on to become a selling point for the film. For example, in an action [[thriller film|thriller]], an expensive special-effects sequence of a dam bursting might be considered the money shot of the film. Many filmmakers read a [[film script|script]] and look for the most dramatic or climactic moment&amp;mdash;the money shot&amp;mdash;in the proposed film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Approved for All Audiences: A Brief History of the Modern Movie Trailer|url=https://www.yahoo.com/movies/approved-for-all-audiences-a-brief-history-of-the-91800184247.html|publisher=Yahoo! Movies|accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the costs or technical challenges of filming such an impressive scene may be huge, producers and directors will do whatever it takes to get that shot completed. It is because of its box-office importance and expensive set-up, that this climactic scene is often referred to as a money shot.

More broadly, it can be any notably dramatic or emotional footage.

===Pornographic films===
The term money shot has also been used as another name for a [[cum shot]] in [[pornographic film]]s. Referring to the [[ejaculation]] scene as a money shot has been attributed to producers paying the male actors extra for it. According to Steven Ziplow, author of ''The Film Maker's Guide to Pornography'', "the cum shot, or, as some refer to it, 'the money shot', is the most important element in the movie and that everything else (if necessary) should be sacrificed at its expense."&lt;ref name=Mills&gt;Mills, Jane.

== Etymology, meaning and origins ==
[[File:Thai wai.jpg|thumb|225px|Statue in a Thai temple.]]
''Namaste'' (''Namah'' + ''te'', [[Devanagari]]: नम:+ ते = नमस्ते) is derived from  [[Sanskrit]] and is a combination of the word ''namah'' and the second person [[dative]] pronoun in its [[enclitic]] form, ''[[Sanskrit pronouns and determiners#First-_and_second-person_pronouns|te]]''.&lt;ref name=fm&gt;Thomas Burrow, ''The Sanskrit Language'', pp. 263–268&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''namaḥ'' takes the [[Sandhi]] form ''namas'' before the sound ''te''.&lt;ref name=fn&gt;Thomas Burrow, ''The Sanskrit Language'', pp. 100–102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sanskritdictionary.org/namah Namah] Sanskrit Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''namas'' is found in the Vedic literature. ''Namas-krita'' and related terms appear in the Hindu scripture ''[[Rigveda]]'' such as in the ''Vivaha Sukta'', verse 10.85.22&lt;ref&gt;"उदीर्ष्वातो विश्वावसो '''नमसेळा महे त्वा''' । अन्यामिच्छ प्रफर्व्यं सं जायां पत्या सृज [https://sa.wikisource.org/s/139l ॥२२॥], Griffith translates it as, "Rise up from hence, Visvavasu, '''with reverence we worship thee'''. Seek thou another willing maid, and with her husband leave the bride; [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Rig_Veda/Mandala_10/Hymn_85 RV, Griffith, Wikisource]; other instances include RV 9.11.6 and many other Vedic texts; for a detailed list, see Maurice Bloomfield, [https://archive.org/stream/vedicconcordance00bloouoft#page/532/mode/2up Vedic Concordance], Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; in the sense of "worship, adore", while ''Namaskara'' appears in the sense of "exclamatory adoration, homage, salutation and worship" in the ''[[Atharvaveda]]'', the ''Taittiriya Samhita'', and the ''Aitareya Brahmana''. It is an expression of veneration, worship, reverence, an "offering of homage" and "adoration" in the Vedic literature and post-Vedic texts such as the ''Mahabharata''.&lt;ref&gt;Monier Monier-Williams, [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/2014/web/webtc/servepdf.php?page=528 Sanskrit-English Dictionary with Etymology Namas], Oxford University Press, p. 528&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/2014/web/webtc/indexcaller.php?input=HK&amp;output=SktRomanUnicode&amp;citation=caraka namas], Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary 1899 edition], Harvard University update (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase ''Namas-te'' appears with this meaning in ''Rigveda'' 8.75.10,&lt;ref&gt;[https://sa.wikisource.org/s/13ky RV 8.75.10, Wikisource]:&lt;br&gt; '''नमस्ते''' अग्न ओजसे गृणन्ति देव कृष्टयः ।&lt;br&gt;Translation: "'''Homage to''' your power, Agni!

According to the Indologist Stephen Phillips, the terms "''te'' and ''tvam''" are an informal, familiar form of "you" in Sanskrit, and it is typically not used for unfamiliar adults. It is reserved for someone familiar, intimate, divine or a child.&lt;ref name=phillips2009p272/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This is similar to ''[[T–V distinction|tu / vous]]'' of French and Romance languages in Europe, states the Indologist [[Patrick Olivelle]], see: {{cite book|author=Patrick Olivelle|title=Manu's Code of Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PnHo02RtONMC |year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-517146-4|pages=346 note 11.205}}&lt;/ref&gt; By using the dative form of ''tvam'' in the greeting ''Namas-te'', there is an embedded secondary, metaphorical sense in the word. This is the basis of the pragmatic meaning of ''Namas-te'', that is "salutations to the (divine) child (in your heart)", states Phillips.&lt;ref name=phillips2009p272&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen H. Phillips|title=Yoga, Karma, and Rebirth: A Brief History and Philosophy|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=cRg2AAAAQBAJ |year= 2009|publisher= Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-51947-2|pages=272 note 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the contemporary era, ''Namaḥ'' means 'bow', 'obeisance', 'reverential salutation' or 'adoration'&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/tamil/recherche?dictionary=mwd&amp;st=namas&amp;prst=exact&amp;en=&amp;pren=exact&amp;maxhits=50 | contribution = Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon | type = search results | title = Cologne Digital Sanskrit Dictionaries | publisher = [[University of Cologne]] | accessdate = March 24, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''te'' means 'to you' (singular [[dative case]] of 'tvam'). Therefore, Namaste literally means "bowing to you".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=namaste&amp;searchmode=none Namaste] Douglas Harper, Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hinduism]], it also has a spiritual import reflecting the belief that "the divine and self ([[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]], soul) is same in you and me", and connotes "I bow to the divine in you".&lt;ref name=ying/&gt;&lt;ref name=kvsingh/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, J. D. (2007), "The Boundaries of Faith: A Journey in India", ''Homily Service'', 41(2), pp. 1–3&lt;/ref&gt; According to sociologist Holly Oxhandler, it is a Hindu term which means, “the sacred in me recognizes the sacred in you”.&lt;ref name="Oxhandlerp168"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Oxhandler | first=Holly | title=Namaste Theory: A Quantitative Grounded Theory on Religion and Spirituality in Mental Health Treatment | journal=Religions | volume=8 | issue=9 | year=2017 | doi=10.3390/rel8090168 | page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A less common variant is used in the case of three or more people being addressed namely ''Namo vaḥ'' which is a combination of ''namaḥ'' and the enclitic 2nd person plural pronoun ''vaḥ''.&lt;ref name="fm"/&gt; The word ''namaḥ'' takes the [[Sandhi]] form ''namo'' before the sound ''v''.&lt;ref name="fn"/&gt; An even less common variant is used in the case of two people being addressed, namely, ''Namo vām'', which is a combination of ''namaḥ'' and the enclitic 2nd person [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]] pronoun ''vām''.&lt;ref name="fm"/&gt;

== Uses ==
[[File:Namaste to the rising sun, Hindu culture religion rites rituals sights.jpg|thumb|225px|A side view of man in Namaste pose.]]
The gesture is widely used throughout the Indian subcontinent, parts of [[Asia]] and beyond where people of South and Southeast Asian origins have migrated.&lt;ref name=ying/&gt; Namaste or namaskar is used as a respectful form of greeting, acknowledging and welcoming a relative, guest or stranger.&lt;ref name=jonesryan/&gt; In some contexts, Namaste is used by one person to express gratitude for assistance offered or given, and to thank the other person for his or her generous kindness.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Shaules (2007), Deep Culture: The Hidden Challenges of Global Living, {{ISBN|978-1847690166}}, pp. 68–70&lt;/ref&gt;

Namaskar is also part of the 16 [[upachara]]s used inside temples or any place of formal [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] (worship). ''Namaste'' in the context of deity worship, scholars conclude,&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Volume 2, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, pages 720&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Fuller|first=C.

It expresses politeness, courtesy, honor, and hospitality from one person to the other. It is used in goodbyes as well.

===Regional variations===
In the Hindi and Nepalese speaking populations of the Indian subcontinent, Namaste ({{IPA-hns |nəməsteː| langhi |Namaste_indian_pronounciation.ogg}}, [[Devanagari]]: नमस्ते) and Namaskār are used synonymously. In [[Nepal]], people generally use Namaskāra for greeting and respecting their elders. In [[Odia language|Odia]] Namaste is also known as ନମସ୍କାର (namaskār) General greeting. In [[Kannada language|Kannada]], Sharanu (ಶರಣು) is used in Northern Karnataka and Namaskāra (ನಮಸ್ಕಾರ) for singular and Namaskaragalu (ನಮಸ್ಕಾರಗಳು) is widely used in the rest of Karnataka for Namaste. In [[Telugu language|Telugu]], Namaste is also known as Dandamu (దండము) or namaskaram (నమస్కారం) for singular and Dandaalu or namaskaralu for plural form. Pranamamu (ప్రణామము) is also used in formal Telugu.  In [[Bengali language|Bengali]], the Namaste gesture is expressed as Nōmōshkar (নমস্কার), and as Prōnäm (Bengali: প্রণাম) informally. In [[Assamese language|Assamese]], Nômôskar (নমস্কাৰ) is used. In Marathi, Namaskār (नमस्कार) is used. In [[Tamil culture|Tamil]], Namaste is known as ''Vanakkam'' (வணக்கம்) which is derived from the root word ''vanangu'' (வணங்கு) meaning ''to bow'' or ''to greet''. In [[Malayalam]], Namaskāram (നമസ്കാരം) is used. The [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]]  word ''namaskāra'' (නමස්කාර) which derived from [[Pali]] also has the same meaning as namaskār/namaskāra in Hindi, Nepali, Odia and Kannada languages, or a different greeting word is ''āyubōvan'' (ආයුබෝවන්) which has the meaning ''wishing long life''.

[[File:OpenSeaMap-Warnemünde.png|thumb|A nautical chart of the [[Warnemünde]] harbor shown on [[OpenSeaMap]]]]

A '''nautical chart''' is a graphic representation of a [[Sea|maritime]] area and adjacent [[coast]]al regions. Depending on the [[scale (map)|scale]] of the chart, it may show depths of [[water]] and heights of land ([[topographic map]]), natural features of the seabed, details of the coastline, navigational hazards, locations of natural and human-made aids to [[navigation]], information on [[tide]]s and [[Ocean current|current]]s, local details of the [[Earth's magnetic field]], and human-made structures such as [[harbor|harbours]], buildings and [[bridge]]s. Nautical charts are essential tools for marine navigation; many countries require vessels, especially commercial ships, to carry them. Nautical charting may take the form of charts printed on paper or computerized [[electronic navigational chart]]s. Recent technologies have made available paper charts which are printed "on demand" with cartographic data that has been downloaded to the commercial printing company as recently as the night before printing. With each daily download, critical data such as Local Notice to Mariners is added to the on-demand chart files so that these charts will be up to date at the time of printing.

== Sources and publication of nautical charts ==

Nautical charts are based on [[hydrographic survey]]s. As surveying is laborious and time-consuming, hydrographic data for many areas of sea may be dated and not always reliable. Depths are measured in a variety of ways. Historically the [[sounding line]] was used. In modern times, [[echo sounding]] is used for measuring the seabed in the open sea. When measuring the safe depth of water over an entire obstruction, such as a [[shipwreck]], the minimum depth is checked by sweeping the area with a length of horizontal [[wire]]. This ensures that difficult to find projections, such as [[Mast (sailing)|masts]], do not present a danger to vessels navigating over the obstruction.

Nautical charts are issued by power of the national [[hydrographic office]]s in many countries. These charts are considered "official" in contrast to those made by commercial publishers. Many hydrographic offices provide regular, sometimes weekly, manual updates of their charts through their sales agents. Individual hydrographic offices produce national chart series and international chart series. Coordinated by the [[International Hydrographic Organization]], the international chart series is a worldwide system of charts ("INT" chart series), which is being developed with the goal of unifying as many chart systems as possible.

There are also commercially published charts, some of which may carry additional information of particular interest, e.g. for yacht skippers.

== Chart correction ==

The nature of a waterway depicted by a chart may change, and artificial aids to navigation may be altered at short notice. Therefore, old or uncorrected charts should never be used for navigation. Every producer of nautical charts also provides a system to inform mariners of changes that affect the chart. In the United States, chart corrections and notifications of new editions are provided by various governmental agencies by way of [[notice to mariners|Notice to Mariners]], [[Local Notice to Mariners]], [[Summary of Corrections]], and [[Broadcast Notice to Mariners]]. In the U.S., NOAA also has a printing partner who prints the "POD" (print on demand) NOAA charts, and they contain the very latest corrections and notifications at the time of printing. To give notice to mariners, radio broadcasts provide advance notice of urgent corrections.

A good way to keep track of corrections is with a ''Chart and Publication Correction Record Card'' system. Using this system, the navigator does not immediately update every chart in the portfolio when a new ''Notice to Mariners'' arrives, instead creating a card for every chart and noting the correction on this card. When the time comes to use the chart, he pulls the chart and chart's card, and makes the indicated corrections on the chart. This system ensures that every chart is properly corrected prior to use. A prudent mariner should obtain a new chart if he has not kept track of corrections and his chart is more than several months old.

Various Digital Notices to Mariners systems are available on the market such as Digitrace, Voyager, or ChartCo, to correct British [[Admiralty chart]]s as well as NOAA charts. These systems provide only vessel relevant corrections via e-mail or web downloads, reducing the time needed to sort out corrections for each chart. Tracings to assist corrections are provided at the same time.

The [[Canadian Coast Guard]] produces the Notice to Mariners publication which informs mariners of important navigational safety matters affecting Canadian Waters. This electronic publication is published on a monthly basis and can be downloaded from the Notices to Mariners (NOTMAR) Web site. The information in the Notice to Mariners is formatted to simplify the correction of paper charts and navigational publications.

Various and diverse methods exist for the correction of electronic navigational charts.

=== Limitations ===

In 1973 the cargo ship ''[[MV Muirfield]]'' (a merchant vessel named after [[Muirfield]], [[Scotland]]) struck an unknown object in waters charted at a depth of greater than 5,000 metres (16,404&amp;nbsp;ft), resulting in extensive damage to her [[keel]].&lt;ref&gt;Calder, Nigel. ''How to Read a Navigational Chart: A Complete Guide to the Symbols, Abbreviations, and Data Displayed on Nautical Charts.'' International Marine/Ragged Mountain Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, [[HMAS Moresby (1963)|HMAS ''Moresby'']], a [[Royal Australian Navy]] [[survey ship]], surveyed the area where ''Muirfield'' was damaged, and charted in detail a previously unsuspected hazard to navigation, the [[Muirfield Seamount]]. The dramatic accidental discovery of the Muirfield Seamount is often cited as an example of limitations in the vertical [[geodetic datum]] accuracy of some offshore areas as represented on nautical charts, especially on small-[[Level of measurement|scale]] charts. 

A similar incident involving a passenger ship occurred in 1992 when the [[Cunard Line|Cunard]] liner ''[[Queen Elizabeth 2]]'' struck a submerged rock off [[Block Island]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;British Admiralty. ''The Mariner's Handbook''. 1999 edition, page 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1999, the [[semi-submersible]], [[heavy-lift ship]] ''[[Mighty Servant 2]]'' capsized and sank after hitting an uncharted single underwater isolated pinnacle of granite off Indonesia. Five crew members died and ''Mighty Servant 2'' was declared a total loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Maritime Casualties 1999 And Before | url=http://www.cargolaw.com/presentations_casualties_a.html | work=The Cargo Letter | year=2007 | accessdate=August 25, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, in 2005 the submarine [[USS San Francisco (SSN-711)|USS ''San Francisco'']] ran into an uncharted sea mount (sea mountain) about 560 kilometres (350 statute miles) south of Guam at a speed of {{convert|35|kn|mph km/h|1|lk=in}}, sustaining serious damage and killing one seaman. In September 2006 the [[jack-up barge]] ''Octopus'' ran aground on an uncharted sea mount within the [[Orkney Islands]] (United Kingdom) while being towed by the tug ''Harold''. £1M worth of damage was caused to the barge and delayed work on the installation of a tidal energy generator prototype. As stated in the Mariners Handbook and subsequent accident report: "No chart is infallible. Every chart is liable to be incomplete".&lt;ref&gt;Marine Investigation Accident Branch (2007) Report Number 18/2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Map projection, positions, and bearings ==
[[File:Fernão Vaz Dourado 1571-1.jpg|thumb|250px|A pre-Mercator nautical chart of 1571, from Portuguese cartographer [[Fernão Vaz Dourado]] (c. 1520 – c.1580). It belongs to the so-called ''plane chart'' model, where observed latitudes and magnetic directions are plotted directly into the plane, with a constant scale, as if the Earth's surface were a flat plane (Portuguese National Archives of Torre do Tombo, Lisbon)]]

The [[Mercator projection]] is used on the vast majority of nautical charts.  Since the Mercator projection is [[conformal map|conformal]], that is, bearings in the chart are identical to the corresponding angles in nature, courses plotted on the chart may be used directly as the course-to-steer at the helm.

The [[gnomonic projection]] is used for charts intended for plotting of [[Great-circle distance|great circle routes]]. [[NOAA]] uses the [[polyconic projection]] for some of its charts of the [[Great Lakes]], at both large and small scales.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, NOAA 14860 - Lake Huron 1:500,000 and NOAA 14853 Detroit River 1:15,000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Positions of places shown on the chart can be measured from the [[longitude]] and [[latitude]] scales on the borders of the chart, relative to a [[geodetic datum]] such as [[WGS 84]].

A [[Bearing (navigation)|bearing]] is the angle between the line joining the two points of interest and the line from one of the points to the north, such as a ship's [[course (navigation)|course]] or a compass reading to a landmark. On nautical charts, the top of the chart is always [[true north]], rather than [[North Magnetic Pole|magnetic north]], towards which a compass points. Most charts include a [[compass rose]] depicting the [[Magnetic declination|variation]] between magnetic and true north.

However, the use of the Mercator projection is not without its drawbacks. Mercator's technique was to make the lines of longitude parallel. On the real globe, the lines of longitude converge as one goes north or south away from the equator, until they meet at the pole. This distortion means that horizontal distances are exaggerated. Mercator's solution, imperfect as it might be, was to increase the distance between lines of latitude in proportion; in a Mercator's projection map, a square is a square no matter where you are on the chart, but a square on the Arctic Circle is much bigger than a square at the equator, even though both occupy the same number of degrees on the globe. The result of this is that scale in a nautical chart is dependent on latitude. In practical use, this is less of a problem than it sounds. One minute of latitude is, for practical purposes, a nautical mile. Distances in nautical miles can therefore be measured on the latitude gradations printed on the side of the chart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sailingissues.com/navcourse2.html Nautical charts] on sailingissues.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electronic and paper charts ==
[[File:US NOAA nautical chart of Bering Strait.png|thumb|Portion of an electronic chart of the [[Bering Strait]]]]

Conventional nautical charts are printed on large sheets of paper at a variety of [[scale (map)|scale]]s. Mariners will generally carry many charts to provide sufficient detail for the areas they might need to visit. [[Electronic navigational chart]]s, which use computer software and electronic databases to provide navigation information, can augment or in some cases replace paper charts, though many mariners carry paper charts as a backup in case the electronic charting system fails.

=== Labeling nautical charts ===
[[File:Nautical-chart-1.jpg|left|thumb|Automatically labeled nautical chart]]

Nautical charts must be labeled with navigational and depth information. There are a few commercial software packages that do [[automatic label placement]] for any kind of map or chart.

== Details on a nautical chart ==
Many countries' hydrographic agencies publish a "Chart 1", which explains all of the symbols, terms and abbreviations used on charts that they produce for both domestic and international use.  Each country starts with the base symbology specified in IHO standard INT 1, and is then permitted to add its own supplemental symbologies to its domestic charts, which are also explained in its version of Chart 1.  Ships are typically required to carry copies of Chart 1 with their paper charts.

=== Pilotage information ===
[[File:NOAA chart 25664 1976 detail.png|right|thumb|Detail of a United States NOAA chart, showing a harbour area]]

The chart uses symbols to provide [[pilotage]] information about the nature and position of features useful to navigators, such as sea bed information, [[sea mark]], and landmarks. Some symbols describe the sea bed with information such as its depth, materials as well as possible hazards such as [[shipwreck]]s. Other symbols show the position and characteristics of [[buoy]]s, [[light characteristic|lights]], [[lighthouse]]s, coastal and land features and structures that are useful for [[position fixing]]. The abbreviation "ED" is commonly used to label geographic locations whose existence is doubtful.

Colours distinguish between man-made features, dry land, sea bed that dries with the tide, and seabed that is permanently [[underwater]] and indicate water depth.

=== Depths and heights ===
[[File:British Admiraly chart colours.svg|thumb|250px|Use of colour in British [[Admiralty chart]]s]]

Depths which have been measured are indicated by the numbers shown on the chart. Depths on charts published in most parts of the world use metres. Older charts, as well as those published by the United States government, may use [[Foot (length)|feet]] or [[fathom]]s. Depth [[contour line]]s show the shape of underwater [[relief]]. Coloured areas of the sea emphasise shallow water and dangerous underwater obstructions. Depths are measured from the [[chart datum]], which is related to the local sea level. The chart datum varies according to the standard used by each national [[Hydrographic Office]]. In general, the move is towards using [[lowest astronomical tide]] (LAT), the lowest tide predicted in the full tidal cycle, but in non-tidal areas and some tidal areas [[Mean Sea Level]] (MSL) is used.

Heights, e.g. a lighthouse, are generally given relative to [[mean high water spring]] (MHWS). Vertical clearances, e.g. below a bridge or cable, are given relative to [[highest astronomical tide]] (HAT). The chart will indicate what datum is in use.

The use of HAT for heights and LAT for depths, means that the mariner can quickly look at the chart to ensure that they have sufficient clearance to pass any obstruction, though they may have to calculate height of tide to ensure their safety.

=== Tidal information ===

[[Tidal race]]s and other strong currents have special chart symbols. Tidal flow information may be shown on charts using [[tidal diamond]]s, indicating the speed and bearing of the tidal flow during each hour of the tidal cycle.

'''Ouargli''', or '''Teggargrent''' (also ''Twargrit, Təggəngusit''), is a [[Zenati languages|Zenati]] [[Berber language]]. It is spoken in the oases of [[Ouargla]] (''Wargrən'') and [[N'Goussa]] (''Ingusa'') in [[Algeria]].

As of 1987, Ouargli had no more than 10,000 speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Delheure 1987:1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethnologue]] estimated only 5,000 speakers as of 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=oua|title=Tagargrent|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2018-02-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some differences between the dialects of Ouargla (''Təggargrənt'') and N'Goussa (''Təggəngusit''), notably in the position of pronominal [[clitic]]s; within Ouargla, there are minor differences between the three tribes At-Brahim, At-Sisin and At-Waggin.&lt;ref&gt;Delheure 1987:2&lt;/ref&gt;

Speakers from Ouargla regard the varieties of Ouargla, N'Goussa, [[Tugurt language|Tugurt]]/Temacine and [[Mozabite language|Tumzabt]]/Mozabite, and possibly other Zenati varieties, as dialects of a single language they call ''Twargrit''.&lt;ref&gt;Delheure 1988:20, 24; Delheure 1987:273&lt;/ref&gt; According to Delheure (1987:355), ''at Wargrən fəhhəmən d awəḥdi tawsint'', "the Ouarglis understand Temacine very well."

The principal grammatical study is Biarnay (1908);&lt;ref&gt;S. Biarnay, 1908, ''[https://archive.org/details/tudesurledialec00biargoog Étude sur le dialecte berbère de Ouargla]'', Paris: Ernest Leroux&lt;/ref&gt; a less detailed sketch is provided in Basset (1893).&lt;ref&gt;[[René Basset]], 1893, ''[http://www.amazighworld.org/studies/grammar/DIALECTE%20BERBERE%20(zenatya%20du%20Mzab,%20de%20Ouargla%20et%20de%20l'Oued%20Righ).pdf Étude sur la Zenatia du Mzab, de Ouargla et de l'Oued-Rir']''. Paris: Ernest Leroux.&lt;/ref&gt; Its lexicon is fairly extensively documented in Delheure's (1987) dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Delheure, 1987, ''Agerraw n iwalen teggargarent-tarumit / Dictionnaire ouargli-français'', Paris: SELAF&lt;/ref&gt; The bilingual texts in Biarnay and Basset are more recently supplemented by the texts on daily life in Delheure (1988)&lt;ref&gt;Jean Delheure, 1988, ''Vivre et mourir à Ouargla. Tameddurt t-Tmettant Wargren.'' Paris: SELAF&lt;/ref&gt; and the folk tale collection in Delheure (1989);&lt;ref&gt;Jean Delheure, 1989, ''Contes et légendes berbères de Ouargla : Tinfusin'', Paris: Boîte à Documents&lt;/ref&gt; the latter, unlike other work on Ouargli, includes texts from N'Goussa as well.

'''Patwin''' (Patween) is a critically endangered [[Wintuan language]] of [[Northern California]]. As of 2003&lt;!--2011 is publication date--&gt;, there was "at least one first language speaker of Patwin."&lt;ref name = "calsurvey"&gt;
{{Cite web
| title = Patwin – Survey of California and Other Indian Languages
| accessdate = 2012-08-30
| url = http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~survey/languages/patwin.php
}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, Patwin language classes were taught at the [[Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation]] (formerly [[Rumsey Rancheria]]) tribal school (Dubin 2010).

Patwin has two (excl. Southern Patwin) or three (incl. Southern Patwin) dialects: "River Patwin (or Valley Patwin) was traditionally spoken along the Sacramento River in Colusa County ... Hill Patwin, was spoken in the plains and foothills to the west."&lt;ref name = "calsurvey"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Southern Patwin language|Southern Patwin]] became extinct shortly after contact. It is very poorly attested, and may be a separate Southern Wintuan language (Mithun 1999).

As of 2012, the Tewe Kewe Cultural Center of the Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation has "a California Indian Library Collection and an extensive Patwin language and history research section."&lt;ref&gt;

==Phonemes==

===Consonants===

Patwin has 24 [[consonant]] phonemes.  In the table below, the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] form(s) of each consonant are given.  This is followed by the form commonly used in published Patwin linguistics literature, if this is different from the IPA form.

[[File:Swansea City AFC League Performance.svg|thumb|right|250px|[[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] have played in all fully professional divisions of the [[English football league system]]. Their history shows how teams can move quickly between the levels through successive promotions or relegations.]]
In [[sports league]]s, '''promotion and relegation''' is a process where teams are transferred between multiple divisions based on their performance for the completed [[Season (sports)|season]]. The best-ranked team(s) in the lower division are ''promoted'' to the higher division for the next season, and the worst-ranked team(s) in the higher division are ''relegated'' to the lower division for the next season. In some leagues, [[playoffs]] or qualifying rounds are also used to determine rankings. This process can continue through [[League system|several levels of divisions]], with teams being exchanged between levels 1 and 2, levels 2 and 3, levels 3 and 4, and so on. During the season, teams that are high enough in the [[Standings#Sport|league table]] that they would qualify for promotion are sometimes said to be in the ''promotion zone'', and those at the bottom are in the ''relegation zone'' (or, colloquially, the ''drop zone'' or ''facing the drop'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/aug/28/match.sport1|title= Hulse sinks limp Canaries|author= Buckley, Will|date= 27 August 2005|work= The Observer|publisher= Guardian News and Media Ltd.|quote=[I]t is Leeds who are in the promotion zone of the Championship.... |accessdate=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2125709/Steve-Kean-confident-Blackburn-avoid-relegation.html|title= We WILL beat the drop!

An alternate system of league organisation which is used primarily in the USA and Canada is a closed model based on licensing or [[Franchising|franchise]]s. This maintains the same teams from year to year, with occasional admission of [[expansion teams]] and [[Relocation of professional sports teams|relocation of existing teams]], and with no team movement between the [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major league]] and [[minor league]]s.

==Overview==
[[File:Södertälje SK vs Leksands IF, Axa Sports Center 2007-03-22.jpg|mini|thumb|200px|[[Södertälje SK]]-[[Leksands IF]] during a [[2007 Kvalserien]] game.]]
[[File:SVDarmstadt98Aufstieg2015.jpg|thumb|200px|[[SV Darmstadt 98]] fans celebrated promotion to the German [[Bundesliga]] in 2015.]]
[[File:Funeral Procession (5969830903).jpg|thumb|200px|... while [[Preston North End]] fans [[Burial of the Coffin|mourned relegation]] to English [[Football League One|League One]] in 2011.]]
The number of teams exchanged between the divisions is almost always identical. Exceptions occur when the higher division wishes to change the size of its membership, or has lost one or more of its clubs (to financial insolvency or expulsion, for example) and wishes to restore its previous membership size, in which case fewer teams are relegated from that division, or (less often) more teams are accepted for promotion from the division below. Such variations usually cause a "knock-on" effect through the lower divisions. For example, in 1995 the [[Premier League]] voted to reduce its numbers by two and achieved the desired change by relegating four teams instead of the usual three, whilst allowing only two promotions from [[Football League Division One]]. Even in the absence of such extraordinary circumstances, the pyramid-like nature of most European sports league systems can still create knock-on effects at the regional level. For example, in a higher league with a large geographical footprint and multiple feeder leagues each representing smaller geographical regions, should most or all of the relegated teams in the higher division come from one particular region then the number of teams to be promoted or relegated from each of the feeder leagues may have to be adjusted, or one or more teams playing near the boundary between the feeder leagues may have to transfer from one feeder league to another to maintain numerical balance.

The system is said to be the defining characteristic of the "European" form of [[professional sports league organization]]. Promotion and relegation have the effect of allowing the maintenance of a hierarchy of leagues and divisions, according to the relative strength of their teams. They also maintain the importance of games played by many low-ranked teams near the end of the season, which may be at risk of relegation.  In contrast, a low-ranked US or Canadian team's final games serve little purpose, and in fact losing may be beneficial to such teams, yielding a better position in the next year's [[draft (sports)|draft]].

Although not intrinsic to the system, problems can occur due to the differing monetary payouts and revenue-generating potential that different divisions provide to their clubs. For example, financial hardship has sometimes occurred in leagues where clubs do not reduce their wage bill once relegated. This usually occurs for one of two reasons: first, the club can't move underperforming players on, or second, the club is gambling on being promoted back straight away and is prepared to take a financial loss for one or two seasons to do so. Some leagues (most notably English football's [[Premier League]]) offer "[[parachute payment (Sports)|parachute payments]]" to its relegated teams for the following year(s).&lt;ref&gt;[http://football.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1837801,00.html  "Football"], ''The Guardian''.  Article discusses the financial disparity between the Premier League and the Football League]&lt;/ref&gt;  The payouts are higher than the prize money received by some non-relegated teams and are designed to soften the financial hit that clubs take whilst dropping out of the Premier League. However, in many cases these parachute payments just serve to inflate the costs of competing for promotion among the lower division clubs as newly relegated teams retain a financial advantage.

In some countries and at certain levels, teams in line for promotion may have to satisfy certain non-playing conditions in order to be accepted by the higher league, such as financial solvency, stadium capacity, and facilities. If these are not satisfied, a lower-ranked team may be promoted in their place, or a team in the league above may be saved from relegation.

While the primary purpose of the promotion/relegation system is to maintain competitive balance, it may also be used as a disciplinary tool in special cases. On several occasions, the
[[Federazione Italiana Giuoco Calcio|Italian Football Federation]] has relegated clubs found to have been involved in [[Match fixing|match-fixing]].  This occurred most recently in 2006, when the season's initial champions [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] were relegated to Serie B, and two other teams were initially relegated but then restored to Serie A after appeal (see [[2006 Serie A scandal]]). In some Communist nations, particularly several in Europe after World War II, clubs were promoted and relegated for political reasons rather than performance; clubs in [[DDR-Oberliga|East Germany]], [[Liga I|Romania]], and [[Yugoslav First League|Yugoslavia]] were given top-flight placements by the Communist authorities from their beginnings, and often held onto their places with these authorities' backing.

===International sport===
Promotion and relegation may be used in international sports tournaments. In tennis, the [[Davis Cup]] and [[Fed Cup]] have promotion and relegation, with a 'World Group' (split into two divisions in the Fed Cup) at the top and series of regional groups at a lower level. The World Groups in both use a [[knockout tournament]] format, with the first-round losers entering play-offs with winners from regional groups to avoid relegation. In international tournaments, this format allows teams from countries in which a sport is less well established to have competitive matches, while opening up the possibility of competing against higher ranked nations as a sport grows. Other international tournaments which employ promotion and relegation include the [[Ice Hockey World Championships]], [[Bandy World Championship (disambiguation)|Bandy World Championship]]s, [[Floorball World Championships]], the [[UEFA Nations League]], the [[World Cricket League]] and the [[European Team Championships]] in athletics.

==Historical comparisons==

===Early baseball leagues in the United States===
In baseball, the earliest American sport to develop professional leagues, the [[National Association of Base Ball Players]] (NABBP) was established in 1857 as a national governing body for the game. In many respects, it would resemble England's [[The Football Association|Football Association]] when founded in 1863. Both espoused strict [[amateurism]] in their early years and welcomed hundreds of clubs as members.

Baseball's National Association was not able to survive the onset of [[professional sport|professionalism]].  It responded to the trend &amp;mdash; clubs secretly paying or indirectly compensating players &amp;mdash; by establishing a "professional" class for 1869. As quickly as 1871, most of those clubs broke away and formed the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players]] (NAPBBP).&lt;ref&gt;Both were associations ''of clubs'' despite their names.&lt;/ref&gt; That new, professional Association was open at a modest fee, but it proved to be unstable.  It was replaced by the [[National League|National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs]] in 1876, which has endured to the present day.  The founders of the new League judged that in order to prosper, they must make baseball's highest level of competition a "closed shop", with a strict limit on the number of teams, each member having exclusive local rights.&lt;ref&gt;At least one economically and competitively viable incumbent was excluded, the second of three 1875 clubs in Philadelphia.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modest National League guarantee of a place in the league year after year would permit the owners to monopolize fan bases in their exclusive territories and give them the confidence to invest in infrastructure, such as improved ballparks. In turn, those would guarantee the revenues to support traveling halfway across a continent for games.&lt;ref&gt;For comparison, the distance between [[Boston]] and [[St. Louis]], the longest road trip in Major League Baseball before 1953, is similar to that between [[Madrid]] and [[Frankfurt]], or [[Rome]] and [[Amsterdam]].&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, after its first season, the new league banked on its still doubtful stability by expelling its members in New York and Philadelphia (the two largest cities), because they had breached agreements to visit the four western clubs at the end of the season.

The NL's dominance of baseball was challenged several times but only by entire leagues, after its first few years.  Eight clubs, the established norm for a national league, was a prohibitively high threshold for a new venture.  Two challengers succeeded beyond the short-term, with the National League fighting off a challenge from the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] after a decade (concluded 1891).  In 1903 it accepted parity with the [[American League]] and the formation of the organization that would become [[Major League Baseball]].  The peace agreement between the NL and the AL did not change the "closed shop" of top-level baseball but entrenched it by including the AL in the shop. This was further confirmed by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court's]] 1922 ruling in ''[[Federal Baseball Club v. National League]]'', giving MLB a legal monopoly over professional baseball in the US.

The other [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada]] have followed the MLB model of a closed shop with no merit-based promotion or relegation since their inceptions.

===Early football leagues in England===
In contrast to baseball's [[NABBP]], the first governing body in English football survived the onset of professionalism, which it formally accepted in 1885. Perhaps the great geographical concentration of population&lt;ref&gt;To emphasize this point, compare England with [[Texas]]. Today, England's population is twice that of Texas, with slightly less than one-fifth of Texas' land area.&lt;/ref&gt; and the corresponding short distances between urban centres was crucial. Certainly it provided the opportunity for more clubs' developing large fan bases without incurring great travel costs. Professional football did not gain acceptance until after the turn of the 20th century in most of [[Southern England]]. The earliest league members travelled only through the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] and [[Northern England|North]].&lt;ref&gt;The modern [[regions of England|regions]] that encompass the Midlands and North—the [[East Midlands]], [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]], [[North East England]], [[North West England]], and [[Yorkshire and the Humber]]—have a combined land area slightly larger than that of [[West Virginia]], [[Latvia]], or [[Lithuania]].&lt;/ref&gt;

When The Football League (now the [[English Football League]]) was founded in 1888, it was not intended to be a rival of [[The Football Association]] but rather the top competition within it. The new league was not universally accepted as England's top-calibre competition right away. To help win fans of clubs outside The Football League, its circuit was not closed; rather, a system was established in which the worst teams at the end of each season would need to win [[re-election (Football League)|re-election]] against any clubs wishing to join.

A rival league, the [[Football Alliance]], was formed in 1889. When the two merged in 1892, it was not on equal terms; rather, most of the Alliance clubs were put in the new [[Football League Second Division]], whose best teams would move up to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in place of its worst teams. Another merger, with the top division of the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] in 1920, helped form the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] in similar fashion. Since then no new league has been formed of [[non-league]] clubs to try to achieve parity with The Football League (only to play at a lower level, like independent professional leagues in American baseball today).

For decades, teams finishing near the bottom of The Football League's lowest division(s) faced re-election rather than automatic relegation. But the principle of promotion and relegation had been firmly established, and it eventually expanded to the [[English football league system|football pyramid]] in place today. Meanwhile, The FA has remained English football's overall governing body, retaining amateur and professional clubs rather than breaking up.

== Use in other competitions ==
Promotion and relegation has been used in several [[eSports]] leagues. In the [[World Cyber Games]] realm, [[Blizzard Entertainment]]'s video game ''[[StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty]]'' uses a seven-level promotion and relegation system&lt;ref&gt;The details of this system are still under development as of [http://forums.battle.net/thread.html?topicId=23094049316&amp;sid=5000 ßeta Patch 6] on 25 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; for its tournament structure. Individual players and pre-made teams can be promoted and relegated during the first few weeks of a league season, which generally lasts around 11 weeks, with promotion and relegation taking place based on a hidden skill rating, which is in turn based on wins and losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/blog/10117387|title=StarCraft II Ladder, League, and Season FAQ|author=|date=|website=StarCraft II}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most professional ''[[League of Legends]]'' leagues like the [[League of Legends Championship Series]] and [[League of Legends Champions Korea]] use a promotion and relegation system. The ''[[Counter-Strike: Global Offensive]]'' Majors use a similar system wherein the top eight finishers of one of the tri-annual Majors are designated with the "Legends" seed and automatically qualified for the next Major tournament. The bottom eight teams must play in a qualifying tournament in order to compete at the next Major.

From 1993 until 2003, the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] used various systems of relegation to reconcile the number of countries wishing to participate (approximately 30 at the time) with the number of performances allowed considering time constraints of a live television program. The addition of a semi-final in 2004 allowed for more than 26 songs, but in 2008 automatic qualification of the previous year's top 10 to the final was removed.

== Argentinian football and the average performance system ==
From 1957 to 1966 and from 1981 to the present, the [[Argentine Primera División|Argentine First Division]] has used a system called ''Promedios'' based on the average performance over a number of seasons. Originally the previous two seasons, and later three or four seasons, clubs avoid relegation by having a high coefficient, which is obtained by dividing the points achieved in the last four seasons by the number of matches played in the same period. Teams with the lowest points coefficient at the end of the season are relegated to the [[Primera B Nacional]].

This system has both positive and negative aspects, since all of the matches played for the championship in the last seasons are included in the coefficient for the clubs. Teams have an incentive to score points in every match of the season, meaning teams that are not challenging for the title or fighting relegation in the current season want to win even in the final matches to reduce the risk of relegation in the next season; examples are [[Club Atlético Banfield]] being champion of the Torneo Apertura in 2009 and last place in the next championship, the Torneo Clausura 2010, without being relegated until the end of the Torneo Apertura 2010 with a second-to-last place finish.

Similarly, [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] finished last in the Torneo Apertura 2008 and after two bad campaigns and a regular one was relegated in the Torneo Clausura 2011 despite being in fifth place and qualifying for the [[2011 Copa Sudamericana]]. This system forces the newly promoted teams to fight relegation from the very beginning of the season. It also allows teams with a low budget with previous good campaigns to compete in international competitions without having to prioritize the championship to avoid relegation; examples of this are [[Club Atlético Lanús]], winner of the [[2013 Copa Sudamericana]], or [[Talleres de Córdoba|Club Atlético Talleres]], winner of the [[1999 Copa CONMEBOL|1999 Conmebol Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/es-ar/noticias/la-historia-de-los-promedios-en-el-futbol-argentino-como-y/bjqejl02vgky1pspg5tj6ojre|title=La historia de los promedios en el fútbol argentino: cómo y cuándo se inventaron {{!}} Goal.com|access-date=2018-01-30|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.infobae.com/2007/05/31/319564-la-verdadera-historia-la-creacion-los-promedios8206/|title=La verdadera historia de la creación de los promedios|website=Infobae|language=es-LA|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elgrafico.com.ar/2012/03/02/C-4102-maldito-promedio.php|title=Maldito Promedio|website=www.elgrafico.com.ar|language=es|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/2099098-promedios-un-invento-argentino-que-llega-a-su-fin|title=El final de un invento argentino: los promedios dejarán de existir dentro de tres años|access-date=2018-01-30|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Uruguayan Primera División|Uruguayan First Division]] adopted the same system in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ladiaria.com.uy/articulo/2015/10/mas-de-lo-mismo/|title=Más de lo mismo|last=ladiaria|access-date=2018-01-30|language=es-uy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1753">A '''prosleptic syllogism''' ({{IPAc-en|p|r|ə|ˈ|s|l|ɛ|p|t|ɪ|k}}; from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] πρόσληψις ''proslepsis'' "taking in addition") is a class of [[syllogism]]s that use a prosleptic proposition as one of the premises.

The term originated with [[Theophrastus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/346217/history-of-logic/65923/Theophrastus-of-Eresus "History of Logic: Theophrastus of Eresus"] in [[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Figures==
Prosleptic syllogisms are classified in three figures, or potential arrangements of the terms according to the figure of the prosleptic proposition used.
First figure: "A is universally predicated of everything that is universally predicated of G"
Second figure: "Everything predicated universally of A is predicated universally of G"
Third figure: "A is universally predicated of everything of which G is universally predicated"

Consequently, a third figure prosleptic syllogism would read "A is universally affirmed of everything of which G is universally affirmed; G is universally affirmed of B; therefore, A is universally affirmed of B." ("All G are A; all B are G; therefore, all B are A" or "Statement A is always true of everything for which statement G is always true; statement G is true of all things B; therefore, statement A is true of all things B.")

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4522">In [[computer sciences]] the '''separation of [[Protection mechanism|protection]] and [[Computer security|security]]''' is a [[computer design|design]] choice. Wulf et al. identified protection as a [[Mechanism (technology)|mechanism]] and security as a [[policy]],&lt;ref name="Wulf74"&gt;Wulf 74 pp.337-345&lt;/ref&gt; therefore making the protection-security distinction a particular case of the [[separation of mechanism and policy]] principle.

== Overview ==
The adoption of this distinction in a [[computer architecture]], usually means that protection is provided as a [[fault tolerance]] mechanism by [[Electronic hardware|hardware]]/[[firmware]] and [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]], whereas the [[operating system]] and [[Process (computing)|applications]] implement their security policies. In this design, security policies rely therefore on the protection mechanisms and on additional [[cryptography]] techniques.

The major hardware approach&lt;ref name="Swift05"&gt;Swift 2005 p.26&lt;/ref&gt; for security or protection is the use of [[hierarchical protection domains]]. Prominent example of this approach is [[Ring (computer security)|ring]] architecture with "[[Ring (computer security)#Supervisor mode|supervisor mode]]" and "user mode").&lt;ref&gt;Intel Corporation 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Such approach adopts a policy already at the lower levels (hardware/firmware/kernel), restricting the rest of the system to rely on it. Therefore, the choice to distinguish between protection and security in the overall architecture design implies rejection of the hierarchical approach in favour of another one, the [[capability-based addressing]].&lt;ref name="Wulf74" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Houdek et al. 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of models with protection and security separation include: [[access matrix]], [[UCLA Data Secure Unix]], [[take-grant]] and [[filter (security)|filter]]. Such separation is not found in models like: [[High watermark (computer security)|high-water mark]], [[Bell–LaPadula model|Bell–LaPadula]] (original and revisited), [[Information flow (information theory)|information flow]], [[strong dependency]] and [[constraints security model|constraints]].&lt;ref&gt;Landwehr 81, pp. 254, 257; there's a table showing which models for computer security separates protection mechanism and security policy on p. 273&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Paranormal}}

A '''shadow person''' (also known as a '''shadow figure''', '''shadow being''' or '''black mass''') is the perception of a patch of shadow as a living, humanoid figure, particularly as interpreted by believers in the [[paranormal]] or [[supernatural]] as the presence of a spirit or other entity.&lt;ref name="Idiot's Guide"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahlquist|first=Diane|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Life After Death|year=2007|publisher=[[Penguin Group]]|location=USA|isbn=978-1-59257-651-7|page=122|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0lkscwxGSoAC&amp;pg=PA122 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and folklore==
A number of religions, legends, and belief systems describe shadowy spiritual beings or [[supernatural]] entities such as [[Shade (mythology)|shades]] of the underworld, and various shadowy creatures have long been a staple of folklore and ghost stories.

The ''[[Coast to Coast AM]]'' late night radio talk show helped popularize modern beliefs in shadow people.&lt;ref name="Kinsella2011" /&gt; The first time the topic of shadow people was discussed at length on the show was April 12, 2001 when host Art Bell interviewed [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] elder Thunder Strikes, who is also known as Harley "SwiftDeer" Reagan. During the show, listeners were encouraged to submit drawings of shadow people that they had seen and a large number of these drawings were immediately shared publicly on the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bell|title=Art Bell - Shadow People|archivedate=September 25, 2001|url=http://artbell.com/shadows.html|archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20010925192530/http://www.artbell.com/shadows.html|accessdate=3 October 2014}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In October that year, Heidi Hollis published her first book on the topic of shadow people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Heidi Hollis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YyAXPQAACAAJ |title=The Secret War: The Heavens Speak of the Battle |publisher=iUniverse |date=October 1, 2001 |isbn=9780595203314}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later became a regular guest on ''Coast to Coast''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Heidi Hollis - Guests|url = http://www.coasttocoastam.com/guest/hollis-heidi/5884|website = Coast to Coast AM|access-date = 2016-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hollis describes shadow people as dark silhouettes with human shapes and profiles that flicker in and out of peripheral vision, and claims that people have reported the figures attempting to "jump on their chest and choke them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.coasttocoastam.com/show/2008/07/23 | title=Shadow People &amp; the "Hat Man" | publisher=Coast to Coast AM | date=2008-03-07 | accessdate=2013-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; She believes the figures to be negative, alien beings that can be repelled by various means, including invoking "the [[Holy Name of Jesus|Name of Jesus]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.coasttocoastam.com/show/2006/03/27 | title=Shadow Beings | publisher=Coast to Coast | date=2006-03-27 | accessdate=2013-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although participants in online discussion forums devoted to [[paranormal]] and supernatural topics describe them as menacing, other believers and paranormal authors do not agree whether shadow people are either evil, helpful, or neutral, and some even speculate that shadow people may be the extra-dimensional inhabitants of another universe.&lt;ref name="Kinsella2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Kinsella|title=Legend-Tripping Online: Supernatural Folklore and the Search for Ong's Hat|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aBK8Nr4edm4C&amp;pg=PA117|accessdate=9 February 2013|date=17 May 2011|publisher=Univ.

Shadow people feature in two episodes of [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] paranormal documentary series ''[[Extreme Ghost Stories]]'', where the phenomenon is described as a "black mass".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Extreme Ghost Stories]]''. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. 2006. Episodes 1 and 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific explanations==
Several [[physiological]] and [[psychological]] conditions can account for reported experiences of shadowy shapes seeming alive. A [[sleep paralysis]] sufferer may perceive a "shadowy or indistinct shape" approaching them when they lie awake paralyzed and become increasingly alarmed.&lt;ref name="Adler2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shelley Adler|title=Sleep Paralysis: Night-mares, Nocebos, and the Mind-Body Connection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_t63WJiZb3cC&amp;pg=PA3|accessdate=10 February 2013|date=15 January 2011|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|isbn=978-0-8135-5237-8|pages=3–|quote=''In the field of sleep research, this experience is termed sleep paralysis: an individual, in the process of falling asleep or awakening, finds himself or herself completely awake, but unable to move or speak…Frequently, he or she sees a shadowy or indistinct shape approaching and becomes increasingly terrified.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Neuroscientists Baland Jalal and [[Vilayanur S.

The '''Siona language''' (otherwise known as Sioni, Pioje, Pioche-Sioni, Ganteyabain, Ganteya, Ceona, Zeona, Koka, Kanú) is a [[Tucanoan language]] of [[Colombia]] and [[Ecuador]].

As of 2013, Siona is spoken by about 550 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Teteté dialect (Eteteguaje) is extinct.&lt;ref&gt;Hammarström (2015) Ethnologue 16/17/18th editions: a comprehensive review: online appendices&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phonology ==
;Vowels
There are 6 oral vowels and six nasal vowels. Only nasal vowels occur next to a nasal consonant {{IPA|/m/}} or {{IPA|/n/}}.

{| class="wikitable IPA"
|
! [[Back vowel|Back]]
! [[Central vowel|Central]]
! [[Front vowel|Front]]
|-

| align="center" |
| align="right" | o õ
|-
! [[Low vowel|Low]]
| align="center" |
| align="center" | a ã
| align="center" |
|}

;Consonants
There are two series of obstruent consonant. Both often produce a noticeable delay before the onset of the following vowel: the 'fortis' series (written ''p t č k kw s h hw'') tends to be [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]], with a noisy transition to the vowel, while the 'lenis' series (written ''b d g gw ’ z''), optionally voiced, is [[glottalized]], with a silent transition to the vowel, which in turn tends to be [[laryngealized]]. The [[glottal stop]] is faint, and noticeable primarily in the laryngealizing effect it has on adjacent vowels.

| align="center" | w
|
|}
{{IPA|/ʈˀ/}} is realized as {{IPA|[ɾ]}} between vowels. {{IPA|/j/}} is realized as {{IPA|[ɲ]}} next to nasal vowels.
 
;Stress
Stress is obligatory on all verb stems, root words, and some suffixes. It disappears when the syllable is not the nucleus of a [[phonological word]]. Some monosyllabic morphemes have both stressed and unstressed forms. Although the position of stress within a word is not contrastive, vocalic and consonantal allophony depends on whether a syllable is stressed. Initial stressed vowels followed by unstressed vowels are long and have a falling tone.

Despite the similar names, Talian is not derived from standard [[Italian language|Italian]] (usually called {{lang|pt|italiano gramático}} or "grammatical Italian" in Brazil), but is mainly a mix of [[Venetian language|Venetian]] dialects influenced by other [[Gallo-Italian languages]] as well as local [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

==History==

[[Italians|Italian]] settlers first began arriving into these regions in a wave of immigration lasting from approximately 1875 to 1914.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|title=Approvato il progetto che dichiara il 'Talian' come patrimonio del Rio Grande del Sud - Brasile|url=http://www.sitoveneto.org/talian_patrimonio_de_rio_grando_do_sul.html|publisher=Sitoveneto|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;{{cite web|title=ESPIRITO SANTO, LO STATO PIU' VENETO DEL BRASILE|url=http://www2.regione.veneto.it/videoinf/periodic/precedenti/01/6/espirito.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040316191344/http://www2.regione.veneto.it/videoinf/periodic/precedenti/01/6/espirito.htm|archivedate=2004-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These settlers were mainly from [[Veneto]], a region in [[Northern Italy]], where [[Venetian language|Venetian]] was spoken, but also from [[Trentino]] and [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt; In the south of Brazil these immigrants settled as smallholders in the region of Encosta da Serra.  There they created three settlements: Conde D'Eu (now, [[Garibaldi, Rio Grande do Sul]]), Dona Isabel (now [[Bento Gonçalves, Rio Grande do Sul]]), and Campo dos Bugres (now [[Caxias do Sul]]).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|last=Losekann|first=Silvana|title=Sancionada lei que declara o Talian dialeto integrante do patrimônio do RS|url=http://www.defender.org.br/sancionada-lei-que-declara-o-talian-dialeto-integrante-do-patrimonio-do-rs/|publisher=Defender - Defesa Civil do Patrimônio Histórico|accessdate=9 March 2012|date=June 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As more people arrived, the Italian settlement expanded beyond these localities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  Approximately 100,000 immigrants from Northern Italy arrived between 1875 and 1910.  As time went by, a uniquely southern Brazilian dialect emerged. Veneto became the basis for Italian-Brazilian regionalism.

Talian was very much influenced not only by other Italian languages but by [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], the national language of Brazil.  However, because its grammar and lexicon remain predominantly Venetian, Talian is not considered a [[creole language]], despite the preponderance of non-Venetian [[loanword]]s.  It has been estimated that there have been 130 books published in Talian, including works of both poetry and prose.&lt;ref name="Parlons"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sRPrAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34 |title=Parlons Talian: Dialecte vénitien du Brésil |last=Alves |first=Ozias |publisher=L'Harmattan |year=2013 |isbn=978-2-343-01576-7 |location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[Riograndenser Hunsrückisch]] (''hunsriqueano riograndense''), the main [[German language|German]] dialect spoken by southern Brazilians of [[German people|German]] origin, Talian has suffered great deprecation since the 1940s. At that time, then-President [[Getúlio Vargas]] started a campaign of nationalization (similar to the [[Nacionalismo (Argentine political movement)|Nacionalismo]] of neighboring [[Argentina]]) to try to force non-Portuguese speakers of Brazil to "better integrate" into the national mainstream culture. Speaking Talian or German in public, especially in education and press, was forbidden.

==Current status==
Talian is mainly spoken in the [[Southern Region, Brazil|southern Brazilian states]] of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] and [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], as well as in [[Espirito Santo]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated4/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated5/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated6/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated9/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated10/&gt; Nowadays, there are approximately 3 million people of Italian ancestry in Rio Grande do Sul, about 30% of the local population,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; and approximately 1.7 million people in Espirito Santo, which accounts for 65% of the local population.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11&gt;{{cite web|title=Estatísticas ítalo-brasileiras|url=http://www.italianossa.com.br/estatistica.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some estimates, there are up to one million speakers of Talian today; Ethnologue reported 4,000,000 speakers in the year 2006.&lt;ref name="ethnologue.com"/&gt;  During the "[[Estado Novo (Brazil)|Estado Novo]]" period of the government of [[Getúlio Vargas]], the use of Talian was declared illegal.&lt;ref name="Jornal Hoje 2014"/&gt;  As a result of the traumas of Vargas' policies, there is, even to this day, a stigma attached to speaking these languages. 

In 2009, the legislative assemblies of the states of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina approved laws declaring the Talian dialect to be an integral part of the historical heritage of their respective states.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al.rs.gov.br/filerepository/replegis/arquivos/13.178.pdf Law No. 13.178], of 10 June 2009.

"Declaring the Talian dialect as historical and cultural patrimony of the State, originating from Italians and descendants living in Santa Catarina". DO No. 18.728, of 11 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the city of [[Serafina Corrêa]], in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, elected Talian as co-official language, alongside [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.serafinacorrea.rs.gov.br/site/noticia/noticia_detalhe.php?gCdNoticia=406 |title=Vereadores aprovam o talian como língua co-oficial do município|language=Portuguese |accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://rosario.redescalabriniana.org/noticia/Talian-em-busca-de-mais-reconhecimento |title=Talian em busca de mais reconhecimento |language=Portuguese |accessdate=24 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120801012132/http://rosario.redescalabriniana.org/noticia/Talian-em-busca-de-mais-reconhecimento |archivedate=1 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 2014 Talian was declared to be part of the cultural heritage of Brazil (''Língua e referência cultural brasileira'') by the [[National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage]]. According to the figure given at this time, there would be about 500,000 active speakers in 133 towns.&lt;ref name="Jornal Hoje 2014"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://g1.globo.com/jornal-hoje/noticia/2014/11/dialeto-de-imigrantes-italianos-se-torna-patrimonio-brasileiro.html |title=Dialeto de imigrantes italianos se torna patrimônio brasileiro |last=Bolson |first=Bibiana |date=2014-11-20 |work=Jornal Hoje |access-date=2018-09-03 |language=pt-BR |trans-title=Italian immigrants' dialect becomes Brazilian patrimony}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Língua Talian |url=http://portal.iphan.gov.br/pagina/detalhes/183/ |publisher=National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage |language=pt-br}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspapers in the Talian-speaking region feature articles written in the language.  There are  approximately 500 radio programs broadcast in Talian.&lt;ref name="Parlons" /&gt;

The '''Tsimshianic''' languages are a [[language family|family]] of languages spoken in northwestern [[British Columbia]] and in Southeast [[Alaska]] on [[Annette Island]] and [[Ketchikan, Alaska|Ketchikan]]. All Tsimshianic languages are endangered, some with only around 400 speakers. Only around 2,170 people of the ethnic Tsimshian {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|m|ʃ|i|ən}} population in Canada still speak a Tsimshian language;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/topics/RetrieveProductTable.cfm?Temporal=2006&amp;APATH=3&amp;PID=89149&amp;THEME=73&amp;PTYPE=88971&amp;VID=0&amp;GK=NA&amp;GC=99&amp;FL=0&amp;RL=0&amp;FREE=0&amp;METH=0&amp;S=1 Statistics Canada 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; about 50 of the 1,300 Tsimshian people living in Alaska still speak [[Coast Tsimshian]].&lt;ref name="anlc"&gt;[[Alaska Native Language Center]].

(online version).] Dallas, TX: SIL International Retrieved on 2007-04-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Tsimshianic languages are considered by most linguists to be an independent language family, with four main languages: Coast Tsimshian, Southern Tsimshian, Nisg̱a’a, and Gitksan.&lt;ref name="anhc"&gt;Alaska Native Heritage Center. (2000). [http://www.alaskanative.net/38.asp "Eyak, Haida, Tlingit &amp; Tsimshian."] Retrieved on 2007-04-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tsimshianic languages were included by [[Edward Sapir]] in his [[Penutian languages|Penutian]] hypothesis, a theory which is currently not widely accepted but is undergoing investigation by [[Marie-Lucie Tarpent]].

==Family division==

Tsimshianic consists of 4 [[Variety (linguistics)|lect]]s:

# '''Tsimshian''' (also known as Maritime Tsimshianic, Lower Tsimshian, Northern Tsimshian)
#* [[Coast Tsimshian language|Coast Tsimshian]] (also known as Tsimshian proper, Sm’algyax̣, Sm’algax)
#* [[Southern Tsimshian language|Southern Tsimshian]] (also known as Sgüüx̣s, Ski:xs, Old Klemtu) †
# '''Nass–Gitksan''' (also known as Interior Tsimshianic, Inland Tsimshianic)
#* [[Nisga'a language|Nisga’a]] (also known as Nisqa’a, Nisg̱a’a, Nishga, Nisgha, Niska, Nass, Nishka)
#* [[Gitxsan language|Gitksan]] (also known as Gitxsan, Gitksanimx̣)

Coast Tsimshian is spoken along the lower [[Skeena River]] in Northwestern [[British Columbia]], on some neighbouring islands, and to the north at [[Metlakatla, Alaska|New Metlakatla, Alaska]]. Southern Tsimshian was spoken on an island quite far south of the Skeena River in the village of [[Klemtu]], however it became extinct in 2013. Nisga’a is spoken along the [[Nass River]]. Gitksan is spoken along the Upper Skeena River around [[Hazelton, British Columbia|Hazelton]] and other areas.

Nisga’a and Gitksan are very closely related and are usually considered [[dialect]]s of the same language by linguists. However, speakers from both groups consider themselves ethnically separate from each other and from the Tsimshian and thus consider Nisga’a and Gitksan to be separate languages. Coast and Southern Tsimshian are also often regarded as dialects of the same language.

As of 2013, Tsimshian courses are available at the [[University of Alaska Southeast]].&lt;ref name = "ktoo201310"&gt;{{Cite episode

'''UMvelinqangi''' is an IsiZulu word which translates to the Most High or Divine Consciousness; that is considered the source of all that has been, that is and all that ever will be. UMvelinqangi contrary to widespread belief is not personified(not made to seem like a person or external being). Umvelinqangi is most accurately described as the inner light of creation. Ukukhothama(meditation) was a widespread practice prior westernisation among the Zulu clan. Ukukhothama was seen as a way of attaining ubunye noMvelinqangi(oneness with the divine conscious), This practice is primarily the reason why the amaZulu clan survived through the ages without any form of western/modern resources.

The attainment/realisation of uMvelinqangi enabled the amaZulu to find natural cures and solutions for their ailments, much like the tribes of the Amazon rain forest today.

'''Vladimír von Szmurlo''' (pronounced "shmurlo"; 1865-1931) was a Russian Esperantist and railway engineer.

He studied in [[Saint Petersburg]]. Before learning Esperanto, he spoke the earlier auxiliary language of [[Volapük]], but was nonetheless very quick to adopt Esperanto. He launched the first Esperanto literature competition in Saint Petersburg in 1896. In 1905, following the [[Russian Revolution (1905)|Russian Revolution]] he moved to [[Stuttgart]] until 1908, when he moved to [[Riga]], where he lived until his death. In 1910 he founded the Esperanto association [[Riga Stelo|La Riga Stelo]] and became its first president. From 1910 to 1915 he was a [[Universal Esperanto Association|UEA]] delegate in Riga.

He published:
* Bibioteko de Lingvo Internacia Esperanto, ("Library of the International Language Esperanto") (1895)
* Jarlibro Esperantista ("Esperantist's Yearbook") (1897)
* Esperanta Universalbiblioteko ("Esperanto Universal Library") (1910-1914)
* a collection of original works in Esperanto ''[[Verda Radio]]'' (1911)

He worked with others on publications such as ''[[La Esperantisto]]'', ''[[Internacia Scienca Revuo]]'', ''[[Lingvo Internacia (magazine)|Lingvo Internacia]]'' and ''[[Scienca Gazeto]]''. He edited and published the magazine ''Riga Stelo'', from 1910 to 1911. He wrote ''ANA ([[Alfabeta Nomaro-Adresaro]])'', also known as ''[[Ariadna fadeno]] ("Ariadne's Thread")'', a first attempt at an Esperanto encyclopedia, in 1916/1917. However, because of [[World War I]], publication was forced to cease after the initial letter 'E', and the content of the whole was somewhat lacking.

Szmurlo also compiled a Complete Russian-Esperanto Dictionary in 1916. In his last years, he was interested principally in the various systems and institutions of the Lingvo Internacia (Esperanto, as it is most commonly known today).

In 1920 he created a derivative auxiliary language called [[Arlingo]], based on Esperanto, which was never published.

Old World wines tend to have more stringent regulations than New World wines.&lt;ref name="Old World vs. New World"&gt;[http://winegeeks.com/resources/107 "Wine Regulations: New World Countries."  winegeeks.com.]&lt;/ref&gt;   Various wine laws, however, may include [[appellation]]-based regulations that cover boundaries as well as permitted [[List of grape varieties|grape varieties]] and winemaking practice-such as the [[French wine|French]] ''[[Appellation d'origine contrôlée]]'' (AOC), [[Italian wine|Italian]] ''[[Denominazione di origine controllata]]'' (DOC), [[Spanish wine|Spanish]] ''[[Denominación de Origen]]'' (DO) and [[Portuguese wine|Portuguese]] ''[[Denominação de Origem Controlada]]'' (DOC). In some [[New World wine]] regions, such as the [[American wine|United States]] and [[Australian wine|Australia]], the wine laws of the appellation systems ([[American Viticultural Area]] (AVA) and Australian Geographical Indication (GIs)) only pertain to boundary specifics and guaranteeing that a certain percentage of grapes come from the area listed on the wine label.

Some wine laws are established by local governments and are specific to that wine region, such as the 1954 [[municipal]] decree in the village of [[Châteauneuf-du-Pape AOC|Châteauneuf-du-Pape]] that banned the overhead flying, landing or taking off of [[aviation]] in the commune which could negatively affect the region's vineyards and wine production.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 249"&gt;K. MacNeil. ''The Wine Bible'', pg 249. Workman Publishing (2001). {{ISBN|1-56305-434-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. Prial. "[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0D8173EF937A35752C0A961948260 WINE; Identified Flying Object.]" ''The New York Times'', January 4, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The oldest known wine laws were created by the [[Roman emperor]] [[Domitian]], who c. 92 issued an [[edict]] that banned the plantings of any new vineyards in [[Italy]] and ordered the uprooting of half of the vineyards in Roman provinces. The purpose of the edict was to improve the food supply of Roman cities by increasing the production of [[cereal]]s. There is evidence to suggest that Domitian's edict was largely ignored in the Roman provinces. Domitian's edict, while probably not followed to any greater extent, stayed in effect for 188 years until Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] repealed the measure in 280.&lt;ref name="OCW Domitian"&gt;J. Robinson (ed), ''The Oxford Companion to Wine'', Third Edition, p. 234, Oxford University Press 2006, {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the oldest wine law was created by the ''[[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|Reichstag]]'' 1498 to combat wine fraud.

In the wake of the [[Great French Wine Blight]], which led to much wine fraud to supplement diminishing supply, wine laws were created in [[France]] to combat fraud. The French wine legislation later evolved to the AOC system, and inspired common [[European Union]] regulations.

==Comparative wine laws==

===European Union===

In the [[European Union]] (EU), much of the wine law is common to all countries through the [[European Union wine regulations]] which is a part of the [[Common Agricultural Policy]] (CAP).&lt;ref name="EU Wine Laws"&gt;[http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodrin/wine/regime.htm "Cap Regime and Reform."  Department for Environmental and Rural Affairs.]&lt;/ref&gt; The CAP Wine Regime consists of a set of rules that govern the [[wine]] sector, with the aim of achieving a balanced and open market. The principal features are rules governing [[Winemaking|production]], [[Oenology|oenological practices and processes]], [[classification of wine]]s, a range of structural and support measures, detailed rules governing the description and [[Wine label|labeling of wines]], and [[import]]s from non-EU countries.&lt;ref name="EU Wine Laws"/&gt;

In addition to regulations that apply to all EU members, each EU country has its own framework of laws which govern aspects of winemaking such as the percentage of a grape to be included in a wine labeled with that variety name.&lt;ref name="EU Local Law"&gt;[http://www.cellarnotes.net/whats_in_a_name.html "What's in a Name: Regionals, Varietals, Generics and Proprietaries?."  CellarNotes.net.]&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, in France wine professionals acribe to the [[Appellation d’Origine Contrôlée]] (AOC) system, which guarantees the origin of wine and other food products, such as [[cheese]].&lt;ref name="French Regulation"&gt;[http://winegeeks.com/resources/106 "Wine Regulations: Old World Countries."  winegeeks.com.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the [[United States]], the wine laws are more flexible than European standards in regards to regulations on what viticultural and winemaking practice are allowed in each wine region. The [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] (BATFE) defines and approves applications for regions to become American Viticultural Areas. This system was established in 1978 with the [[Augusta AVA]] in [[Missouri wine|Missouri]] designated as the first recognized AVA on June 20, 1980.&lt;ref name=ATF&gt;Code of Federal Regulations [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/get-cfr.cgi?TITLE=27&amp;PART=9&amp;SECTION=22&amp;TYPE=TEXT Title 27, Volume 1] ALCOHOL, TOBACCO PRODUCTS AND FIREARMS&lt;/ref&gt; A sizable portion of American wine laws relate to [[wine label]]ling practices and include the stipulations that if an AVA name appears on the label that at least 85% of grapes used to produce the wine must come from that AVA.&lt;ref name=Crowe&gt;B. Crowe, The Society of Wine and Jurisprudence, [http://wineandjurisprudence.org/an-introduction-to-appellations/ “An Introduction to Appellations”]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to AVAs, every American [[U.S. state|state]] and [[County (United States)|county]] can produce wine and label it under their state/county wide appellation provided at least 75% of the grapes come from that area.&lt;ref name=id&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt; The state of [[California wine|California]] and [[Texas wine|Texas]] have wine laws increasing the requirement to 100% and 85%, respectively, for use of a statewide appellation on the wine label.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 632-635"&gt;K. MacNeil. ''The Wine Bible'', pp. 632-636. Workman Publishing (2001). {{ISBN|1-56305-434-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The appearance of grape variety (or [[varietal]]) and [[vintage]] year is also regulated by US wine labeling laws with requirements of at least 75% for the grape variety and 95% being [[harvest (wine)|harvested]] in that vintage year for either to appear on the wine label. The state of [[Oregon wine|Oregon]] has increased the restriction for grape variety to 90%, with exception of [[Cabernet Sauvignon]] which under Oregon wine laws can have a minimum 75%. Additionally, all US wine must include the [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] warning about [[Long-term effects of alcohol|dangers associated with alcohol]] consumption and a warning about the possible use of [[sulfite]]s. Several wineries and importers have had conflicts with the BATFE over these labeling requirements, one notable example being the importer [[Kermit Lynch]]. The criticism is typically centered on the absence of inclusion about the potential positive aspects of moderate wine consumption (such as the so-called "[[French paradox]]") and that many wineries are forced to label their wines as "containing sulfites" when the decision to use sulfites are normally not made until long after wine labels have been ordered and the finished wine may contain no added sulfites.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 632-635"/&gt;

[[File:Yaghnobi regions.jpg|right|thumb|Yaghnobi-speaking areas and enclaves of Yaghnobi-speakers among a Tajik majority]]

The '''Yaghnobi language'''&lt;ref&gt;Also rendered ''Yaghnabi, Yagnobi'' or ''Yagnabi'';
– '''yaɣnobī́ zivók''' (in Tajik variant of [[Cyrillic script]] '''яғнобӣ зивок''' {{IPA-ira|jɑʁnɔːˈbiː zɪ̆ˈvoːkʰ|}}, [[Russian language|Russian]] '''ягнобский язык''' ''jagnobskij jazyk'', [[Tajik language|Tajik]] '''забони яғнобӣ''' ''zabon-i yaɣnobî'', [[Persian language|Persian]] '''زبان یغنابى''' ''zæbɑ̄n-e yæɣnɑ̄bī'', [[Ossetic language|Ossetic]] '''ягънобаг æвзаг''' ''jaɣnobag ævzag'',  [[German language|German]] '''Jaghnobisch''', [[Czech language|Czech]] '''jaghnóbština''', [[Slovak language|Slovak]] '''jagnóbčina''', [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] '''ягнобська мова''' ''jahnobs’ka mova'', [[Polish language|Polish]] '''jagnobski język''', [[Croatian language|Croatian]] '''jagnopski jezik''', [[Modern Greek|Greek]] '''γιαγκνομπί''', '''γιαγνομπί''', [[Turkish language|Turkish]] '''yagnabca''', '''yagnobca''', '''yagnob dili'''; linguistic abbreviation: YAGH&lt;/ref&gt; is a living [[Eastern Iranian languages|Eastern Iranian]] language (the other living members being [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Ossetic language|Ossetic]] and the [[Pamir languages]]). Yaghnobi is spoken in the [[Yagnob Valley|upper valley]] of the [[Yaghnob River]] in the [[Zarafshan]] area of [[Tajikistan]] by the [[Yaghnobi people]]. It is considered to be a direct descendant of [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] and has often been called '''Neo-Sogdian''' in academic literature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/yaghnobi Bielmeier. R.  Yaghnobi in Encyclopedia Iranica]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some 12,500 Yaghnobi speakers. They are divided into several communities. The principal group lives in the [[Zafarobod]] area. There are also resettlers in the [[Yagnob Valley|Yaghnob Valley]]. Some communities live in the villages of Zumand and Kůkteppa and in [[Dushanbe]] or in its vicinity.

Most Yaghnobi speakers are bilingual in the West Iranian [[Tajik language|Tajik]]. Yaghnobi is mostly used for daily family communication, and [[Tajik language|Tajik]] is used by Yaghnobi-speakers for business and formal transactions. A single Russian ethnographer was told by nearby Tajiks, long hostile to the Yaghnobis, who were late to adopt Islam, that the Yaghnobis used their language as a "secret" mode of communication to confuse the Tajiks. The account led to the belief by some, especially those reliant solely on Russian sources, that Yaghnobi or some derivative of it was used as a code for nefarious purposes.&lt;ref&gt;See С. И. Климчицкий: Секретный язык у ягнобцев и язгулёмцев. In: Академия наук СССР – Труды Таджикистанской базы, т. IX – 1938 – История – язык – литература. Akademijaji Fanho SSSR: Asarhoji ʙazaji Toçikiston, çildi IX – Tarix – zaʙon – adaʙijot. Москва – Ленинград (: Издательство Академии наук СССР), 1940. 104–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two main dialects: a western and an eastern one. They differ primarily in phonetics. For example, historical ''*θ'' corresponds to ''t'' in the western dialects and ''s'' in the eastern: ''met'' – ''mes'' 'day' from Sogdian ''mēθ'' {{angbr|myθ}}. Western ''ay'' corresponds to Eastern ''e'': ''wayš'' – ''weš'' 'grass' from Sogdian ''wayš'' or ''wēš'' {{angbr|wyš}}. The early Sogdian group ''θr'' (later ''ṣ̌'') is reflected as ''sar'' in the east but ''tir'' in the west: ''saráy'' – ''tiráy'' 'three' from Sogdian ''θrē''/''θray'' or ''ṣ̌ē''/''ṣ̌ay'' {{angbr|δry}}. There are also some differences in verbal endings and in the [[Lexis (linguistics)|lexicon]]. In between the two main dialects is a transitional dialect that shares some features of both other dialects.

==Writing==
Yaghnobi was unwriten until the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;The Cyrillic [[Tajik alphabet]]-based script was invented by Sayfiddīn Mīrzozoda in the 1990s.&lt;/ref&gt; but according to Andreyev, some of the Yaghnobi mullahs used the [[Arabic script]] for writing the language before 1928, mainly when they needed to hide some information from the Tajiks.&lt;ref&gt;М. С. Андреев,  Материалы по этнографии Ягноба, Душанбе (Дониш) 1970, pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays,  the language is transcribed by scholars using a modified [[Latin alphabet]], with the following symbols:
a (á), ā (ā́), b, č, d, e (é), f, g, ɣ, h, ḥ, i (í), ī (ī́), ǰ, k, q, l, m (m̃), n (ñ), o (ó), p, r, s, š, t, u (ú), ū (ū́), ʏ (ʏ́), v, w (u̯), x, x°, y, z, ž, ع

[[TITUS (project)|TITUS]] transcribes the alphabet as such: a (á), b, č, d, e (é), ĕ (ĕ́), ẹ (ẹ́), ẹ̆ (ẹ̆́), ə (ə́), f, g, ɣ, h, x̣, i (í), ĭ (ĭ́), ī (ī́), ǰ, k, q, l, m (m̃), n (ñ), o (ó), ọ (ọ́), p, r, s, š, t, u (ú), ŭ (ŭ́), ı̥ (í̥), v, u̯, x, x°, y, z, ž, ع

In recent times, Sayfiddīn Mīrzozoda, from the Tajik Academy of Sciences, uses a modified [[Tajik alphabet]] for writing Yaghnobi. The alphabet is quite unsuitable for Yaghnobi, as it does not distinguish short and long vowels or v and w and it does not mark stress. Latin equivalents are given in parentheses:

'''А а''' (a), '''Б б''' (b), '''В в''' (v), '''Ԝ ԝ''' (w), '''Г г''' (g), '''Ғ ғ''' (ɣ), '''Д д''' (d), '''Е е''' (e/ye), '''Ё ё''' (yo), '''Ж ж''' (ž), '''З з''' (z), '''И и''' (i, ī), '''Ӣ ӣ''' (ī), '''й''' (y), '''К к''' (k), '''Қ қ''' (q)
'''Л л''' (l), '''М м''' (m), '''Н н''' (n), '''О о''' (o), '''П п''' (p), '''Р р''' (r), '''С с''' (s), '''Т т''' (t), '''У у''' (u, ū, ʏ), '''Ӯ ӯ''' (ū, ʏ), '''Ф ф''' (f), '''Х х''' (x), ''Хԝ хԝ'' (x°), '''Ҳ ҳ''' (h, ḥ), '''Ч ч''' (č), '''Ҷ ҷ''' (ǰ), '''Ш ш''' (š),  '''Ъ ъ''' (ع), '''Э э''' (e), '''Ю ю''' (yu, yū, yʏ), '''Я я''' (ya)

# The letter ''й'' never appears at the beginning of a word. Words beginning with ''ya-'', ''yo-'' and ''yu-/yū-/yʏ-'' are written as ''я-'', ''ё-'' and ''ю-'', and the combinations are written in the middle of the word: ''viyóra'' is ''виёра'' {{IPA|[vɪ̆ˈjoːra]}}.
# Use of ''ӣ'' and ''ӯ'' is uncertain, but they seem to distinguish two similar-sounding words: {{lang|yai|иранка}} and {{lang|yai|ӣранка}}, {{lang|yai|рупак}} and {{lang|yai|рӯпак}}. Perhaps ''ӣ'' is also used as a stress marker as it is also in [[Tajik alphabet|Tajik]], and ''ӯ'' can also be used in [[Tajik language|Tajik]] loanwords to indicate a [[Tajik language|Tajik]] vowel {{angbr|ů}} {{IPA|[ɵː]}}, but it can have some other unknown use.
# In older texts, the alphabet did not use letters ''Ъ ъ'' and ''Э э''. Instead of Tajik ''ъ'', Yaghnobi ''’'' and ''е'' covered both [[Tajik alphabet|Tajik]] ''е'' and ''э'' for {{IPA|/e/}}. Later, the letters were integrated into the alphabet so the older {{lang|yai|етк}} was changed into {{lang|yai|этк}} to represent the pronunciation {{IPA|[ˈeːtkʰ]}} (and not {{IPA|*[ˈjeːtkʰ]}}). Older {{lang|yai|ша’мак}} was changed to {{lang|yai|шаъмак}} {{IPA|[ʃʲɑʕˈmak]}}.
# {{IPA|/je/}} and {{IPA|/ji/}} are written ''е'' and ''и''. Yaghnobi  ''и'' can be {{IPA|*/ji/}} after a vowel like in [[Tajik alphabet|Tajik]], and ''ӣ'' after a vowel is {{IPA|*/jiː/}}. Also, ''е'' has two values: word-initially and after a vowel, it is pronounced {{IPA|[jeː]}}, but after a consonant, it is {{IPA|[eː]}}. {{IPA|/je/}} is rare in Yaghnobi and is only in [[Tajik language|Tajik]] or [[Russian language|Russian]] loans, the only example for {{IPA|/je/}} is {{lang|yai|Европа}} {{IPA|[ˈjeːvrɔpa]}}, a [[Russian language|Russian]] loanword.
# [[Russian alphabet|Russian]] letters ''Ц ц'', ''Щ щ'', ''Ы ы'' and ''Ь ь'', which can be used in [[Tajik language|Tajik]] loans from [[Russian language|Russian]], are not used in Yaghnobi. They are written as they are pronounced by the Yaghnobi speakers, not as they are written originally in [[Russian alphabet|Russian]]: ''aeroplane'' is {{lang|ru|самолет/самолёт}} in [[Russian alphabet|Russian]], written {{lang|tg|самолёт}} in [[Tajik language|Tajik]] and pronounced {{IPA|[səmɐˈlʲɵt]}} in [[Russian language|Russian]] and in [[Tajik language|Tajik]]. In Yaghnobi, it is written as {{lang|yai|самалиёт}} and follows the Yaghnobi pronunciation {{IPA|[samalɪˈjoːtʰ]}} or {{IPA|[samajlˈoːtʰ]}}. The word ''concert'' is borrowed to Yaghnobi from [[Russian language|Russian]] {{lang|ru|концерт}} {{IPA|[kɐnˈtsɛrt]}} in form {{lang|yai|кансерт}} {{IPA|[kʰanˈseːrtʰ]}}). Compare with [[Tajik language|Tajik]] {{lang|tg|консерт}}.
# By consultation with Sayfiddīn Mīrzozoda, the distinction between sounds {{IPA|/v/}} and {{IPA|/w/}} needs to be established. For {{IPA|/v/}}, ''в'' is used, but for {{IPA|/w/}}, another letter should be adopted. ''W w'' would be the best choice. For {{IPA|/χʷ/}}, ''Хw хw'' should be used. Mīrzozoda uses ''w'' in some texts, but notatis that is inconsistent.

==Phonology==
Yaghnobi includes 9 monophthongs (3 short, 6 long), 8 diphthongs, and 27 consonants.

===Vowels===

The diphthongs in Yaghnobi are {{IPA|/ai̯, ɔːi̯, ʊi̯, uːi̯, yːi̯, ɪi̯, ɔːu̯, au̯/}}. {{IPA|/ai̯/}} only appears in native words in the western dialects, eastern dialects have {{IPA|/ɛː/}} in its place, except in loanwords.

* The monophthongs have these allophonic variants:
** {{IPA|/ɪ/}}: {{IPA|[i~ɪ~e]}}
** {{IPA|/a/}}: {{IPA|[(æ~)a(~ɑ)]}}
** {{IPA|/ʊ/}}: {{IPA|[(y~)u~ʊ~o]}}
** {{IPA|/iː/}}: {{IPA|[iː]}}
** {{IPA|/ɛː/}}: {{IPA|[ɛː~eː]}}
** {{IPA|/ɑː/}}: {{IPA|[(aː~)ɑː]}}
** {{IPA|/ɔː/}}: {{IPA|[(ɒː~)ɔː(~oː~uː)]}}
** {{IPA|/uː/}}: {{IPA|[uː]}}
** {{IPA|/yː/}}: {{IPA|[(uː~)yː(~iː)]}}
* {{IPA|/ɑː/}} was the result of compensatory lengthening ({{IPA|/dʒɑːm &lt; dʒaʕm &lt; dʒamʕ/}}).
* In recent loans from [[Tajik language|Tajik]] {{IPAblink|ɵː}} and/or [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] {{IPA|[{{IPAlink|ɵ}}, {{IPAlink|ø}}]}} can also appear, but its pronunciation usually merges to {{IPA|/uː/}}.
* {{IPA|/yː/}} is only recognised by some authorities. IIt seems that it is an [[allophone]] of {{IPA|/uː/}}, originating from historical stressed *''ū'', but historical *''ō'', changed in Yaghnobi to ''ū'', remains unchanged. It seems that {{IPA|/yː/}} is unstable, and it is not recorded in all varieties of Yaghnobi. It is often realised as {{IPA|[uː(j), uːʲ, ʊj, ʊʲ]}}, as well as {{IPA|/yː/}}. By summary: *''ū́'' ''(under stress)'' &gt; ''ū/ūy/uy/ʏ'' or ''ū'', *''ō'' &gt; ''ū'' ({{lang|yai|вуз}} {{IPA|[vyːz~vuːz]}} "goat"; {{lang-tg|буз|tr=buz}}, {{lang-ae|𐬠𐬏𐬰𐬀|tr=būza}}). 
* Before a nasal, {{IPA|/ɔː/}} can change to {{IPA|/uː/}}, e.g. {{lang|yai|Тоҷикистун}} {{IPA|[tɔːdʒɪkɪsˈtɔːn~tɔːdʒɪkɪsˈtuːn]}} "Tajikistan", {{lang|yai|нум}} {{IPA|[nɔːm~nuːm]}} "name".
* {{IPA|/ɛː/}} is considered as a long vowel, however before {{IPA|/h, ʕ/}}, its pronunciation is somewhat shorter, and is realised as a half-short (or even short) vowel. Etymologically, the "short" ''e'' before {{IPA|/h, ʕ/}} comes from older *''i'' (there is an alternation ''e/i'' before {{IPA|/h, ʕ/}}) if the historical cluster ''*ih'' or ''*iع'' appears in a closed syllable, and ''*i'' changes to ''e''. In open syllables, the change did not take place (that is similar to Tajik). The change can be seen in the verb ''dih-/deh-'': infinitive {{IPA|[ˈdɪhak]}} vs. 3rd sg. present {{IPA|[ˈdɛ(ˑ)htʃɪ]}}.
* In Yaghnobi dialects, there can be seen a different development of historical [[epenthesis|svarabhakti vowel]]: in the Western and Transitional dialects, it is rendered as {{IPA|/ɪ/}} (or {{IPA|/ʊ/}} under certain circumstances), but in the Eastern dialects it changes to {{IPA|/a/}} (but also {{IPA|/ɪ/}} or {{IPA|/ʊ/}}): ''*θray'' &gt; ''*θəráy'' &gt; W./Tr. ''tiráy'' vs. E. ''saráy'' but ''*βrāt'' &gt; ''*vərāt'' &gt; W./Tr./E. ''virót''.&lt;br&gt;When the second vowel is a back vowel, ''*ə'' usually changes to {{IPA|/ʊ/}} in Western or Transitional dialects: ''*(čə)θβār'' &gt; ''*tfār'' &gt; ''*təfór'' &gt; W./Tr. ''tufór'' (but also ''tifór'') vs. E. ''tafór'', ''*pδūfs-'' &gt; ''*bədū́fs'' &gt; W./Tr./E. ''budū́fs-''. The later change appears also in morphology: verb ''tifárak'' (the form is same in all three dialects) has form in 3rd sg. present ''tufórči'' &lt; ''*təfár-'' &lt; ''*tfar-'' &lt; ''*θβar-''. The alternation {{IPA|/ɪ~a/}} can be seen also in Tajik loans where an unstressed vowel can undergo this change: W./Tr. ''širī́k'' vs. E. ''šarī́k'' &lt; Tajik {{lang|tg|шарик}} ''/š&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;rīk/'' "partner", W./Tr. ''xipár'' vs. E. ''xapár'' &lt; Tajik {{lang|tg|хабар}} ''/x&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;bar/'' "news". The former svarabhakti vowels are often ultra-short or reduced in pronunciation, and they can even disappear in fast speech: ''xišáp /xišáp'' vs. ''xⁱšáp'' vs. ''xšap/'' &lt; ''*xəšáp'' &lt; ''*xšap''.
* The {{IPA|/a/}} changes to {{IPA|/ɔː/}} in verbal stems of type -Car- if an ending containing historic ''*θ'' or ''*t'' is added: ''tifár-'', infinitive ''tifárak'', 1st sg. present ''tifarómišt'' but 3rd sg. present ''tufórči'' (ending ''-či'' comes from older ''-tišt''), 2nd pl. present W./Tr. ''tufórtišt'' E. ''tufórsišt'', ''x°ar-: x°árak : x°arómišt : xórči : xórtišt/xórsišt'' (when {{IPA|/a/}} changes to {{IPA|/ɔː/}} after {{IPA|/χʷ/}}, {{IPA|/χ/}} loses its labilisation). The change takes place with all verbs of Yaghnobi origin and also with older loans from Tajik. For new loans, ''a'' remains unchanged.: ''gudár(ak) : gudórči'' vs. ''pár(ak) : párči'': the first verb is an old loan from Tajik ''guzaštan &lt; guδaštan'', the later a recent loan from ''parrīdan''.

* {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} are palatalised to {{IPAblink|c}} and {{IPAblink|ɟ}} respectively before a front vowel or after a front vowel word-finally.
* {{IPA|[ɦ]}} appears as an allophone between vowels or voiced consonants.
* {{IPAslink|m}}, {{IPAslink|n}} both have allophones {{IPAslink|ŋ}} and {{IPAslink|ɱ}} before {{IPA|/k, ɡ/}} and {{IPA|/f, v/}}, respectively
* All voiced consonants are pronounced voiceless at the end of the word when after an unvoiced consonant comes a voiced one. Likewise, unvoiced consonants become voiced by assimilation. In voicing ''q'', the voiced opposition is {{IPAblink|ɣ}}, not {{IPAblink|ɢ}}.
* The consonants {{IPAslink|b}}, {{IPAslink|ɡ}}, {{IPAslink|h}}, {{IPAslink|ħ}}, {{IPAslink|dʒ}}, {{IPAslink|q}}, {{IPAslink|l}}, {{IPAslink|ʕ}} appear mostly in loanwords, native words with those sounds are rare and mostly [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]].

===Verb===
Personal endings – present:

{|class="wikitable"
! Person || Singular || Plural
|-
| 1st || -omišt || -īmišt
|-
| 2nd || -īšt || -tišt (W, Tr.), -sišt (E)
|-
| 3rd || -tišt (W), -či (E, Tr.) || -ošt
|}

Personal endings – [[preterite]] (with [[augment (linguistics)|augment]] ''a-''):

{|class="wikitable"
! Person || Singular || Plural
|-
| 1st || ''a-'' -im || ''a-'' -om (W), ''a-'' -īm (E, Tr.)
|-
| 2nd || ''a-'' -ī || ''a-'' -ti (W, Tr.), ''a-'' -si (E)
|-
| 3rd || ''a-'' – || ''a-'' -or
|}
By adding the ending ''-išt'' (''-št'' after a vowel; but ''-or+išt'' &gt; ''-ošt'') to the preterite, the durative preterite is formed.

The present [[participle]] is formed by adding ''-na'' to the verbal stem. Past participle (or perfect participle) is formed by addition of ''-ta'' to the stem.

The [[infinitive]] is formed by addition of ending ''-ak'' to the verbal stem.

[[Negation]] is formed by prefix ''na-'', in combination with augment in preterite it changes to ''nē-''.

The [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] is this:

{|class="wikitable"
! Person || Singular || Plural
|-
| 1st || īm || om
|-
| 2nd || išt || ot (W, Tr.), os (E)

| 3rd || ast, -x, xast, ásti, xásti || or
|}

==Lexicon==

Knowledge of Yaghnobi lexicon comes from three main works: from a Yaghnobi-[[Russian language|Russian]] dictionary presented in '''Yaghnobi texts''' by ''Andreyev'' and ''Peščereva'' and then from a supplementary word list presented in '''Yaghnobi grammar''' by ''Xromov''. The last work is '''Yaghnobi-Tajik Dictionary''' compiled by Xromov's student, ''Sayfiddīn Mīrzozoda'', himself a Yaghnobi native speaker. Yaghnobi [[Tajik language|Tajik]] words represent the majority of lexicon (some 60%), followed by words of [[Turkic language|Turkic]] origin (up to 5%, mainly from [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]]) and a few [[Russian language|Russian]] words (about 2%; through [[Russian language]] also many [[Internationalism (linguistics)|international words]] came to Yaghnobi). Only a third of the lexicon is Eastern-Iranian origin and can be easily comparable to those known from [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]], [[Ossetic language|Ossetian]], [[Pamir languages]] or [[Pashto language|Pashto]].
