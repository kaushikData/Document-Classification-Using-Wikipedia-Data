==Synopsis==
===Act I===
[[Death Eater#Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] and [[Death Eater#Yaxley|Yaxley]] meet to discuss [[Lord Voldemort]]'s defeat at the hands of [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]]. Lucius describes that if it were not for Harry Potter, they would be reigning supreme. Lucius then explains his plan to use a [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Time-Turners|Time Turner]] to go back in time to Harry's first year at [[Hogwarts]] to destroy him before he can become a threat for the [[Death Eater]]s ("Not Over Yet").

In the past Harry Potter shows up at [[London King's Cross railway station#Harry Potter|King's Cross station]] for his first year at Hogwarts and cannot seem to find [[Places in Harry Potter#Platform Nine and Three-Quarters|Platform 9¾]]. He then meets the Weasleys, who help him find the way. In the midst of this, Harry meets [[Ron Weasley]] and the two quickly become the best of friends. Ron and the others at Platform 9¾ discover who Harry is and begin to treat him like a celebrity. Harry asks Ron why they are acting this way toward him, and Ron tells Harry that he is "The Boy Who Lived," as he survived the [[Avada Kedavra|Killing Curse]] and defeated Voldemort as a child. [[List of supporting Harry Potter characters#Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]] also tells Harry about the murderer [[Order of the Phoenix (organisation)#Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], who betrayed his parents and is now after his life ("Harry Freakin' Potter").

On the [[Hogwarts#Hogwarts Express|Hogwarts Express]], Harry and Ron meet [[Hermione Granger]]. Meanwhile, a Death Eater knocks out the candy lady and attempts to use the Killing Curse on Harry, but is disarmed by [[Order of the Phoenix (organisation)#Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]], who is the new [[Magic in Harry Potter#Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher at Hogwarts. As the train arrives at Hogwarts, Lupin tells Harry not to go looking for trouble. At this point, Harry is introduced to [[Severus Snape]], who instantly takes a disliking to Harry, but Lupin stands up for Harry and Snape flees. Lupin leaves Harry after mentioning that his parents spent the best years of their lives at Hogwarts, leading Harry to believe he has finally found a home ("To Have a Home").

After Harry, Ron, and Hermione are sorted by the Scarf of Sexual Preference (or "Scarfy") into "Metrosexual", "Bi-curious", and "Waiting 'til marriage", respectively, and by the Sorting Hat (or "Sorty") into [[Hogwarts#Gryffindor|Gryffindor]] house together, they meet [[Hogwarts#Slytherin|Slytherin]] [[Draco Malfoy]], who wants to be Harry's friend very badly and tells his associates [[List of supporting Harry Potter characters#Crabbe and Goyle|Vincent Crabbe]] and [[List of supporting Harry Potter characters#Crabbe and Goyle|Gregory Goyle]] to torture Ron and Hermione until he agrees. Hogwarts headmaster [[Albus Dumbledore]] arrives to cease the fighting and welcome everyone to Hogwarts. Dumbledore then introduces the House Cup and "the silliest of all wizard sports", [[Quidditch]]. Dumbledore introduces Lupin and Snape as the coaches of the Gryffindor and Slytherin Quidditch teams, respectively. As Snape begins to taunt Lupin about the full moon, Lupin begins to take on a [[werewolf]] transformation and runs away. Dumbledore then introduces the terrifying and musclebound professor [[Ministry of Magic#Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]], who has been assigned by the [[Ministry of Magic]] to keep Harry and the rest of the school safe from Sirius Black. Snape escorts the boys to their dorm, and Dumbledore tells Harry he should be proud to be in Gryffindor, like himself and his parents were. Umbridge is left to instruct the girls on the rules of the dormitory, but intimidates them into submission.

Harry and Ron go to try out for the Gryffindor Quidditch team, but before they can begin practicing, Snape shows up and he and Lupin argue over which team has the field reserved for the day. The two go to see Dumbledore to settle the matter. Meanwhile, Draco approaches Harry to boast about a picture he drew of him. Hermione attempts to stand up for Harry, but the tables are turned on her as everyone makes fun of her for not being able to draw ("Hermione Can't Draw"). Lupin returns to tell the team that he messed up the schedule, but no one seems to care as they are all having too much fun making fun of Hermione. Hermione wishes she could show everyone who she really is ("The Coolest Girl").

The students of Hogwarts are taking a field trip to [[Places in Harry Potter#Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]], but Harry does not have a signed permission form, so Umbridge decides to harshly punish him. Fortunately for Harry, [[Dumbledore's Army#Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]] shows up to give Umbridge flowers from "Big D," which puts her in a much better mood. Harry is still not allowed to go, but he manages to escape Umbridge's wrath. Draco also does not have a permission form, so he stays behind to write a letter to his father. Harry meets up with Lupin, who gives him [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#The Marauder's Map|the Marauder's Map]] so that he can go secretly to Hogsmeade without a permission slip, but advises him not to go to the [[Places in Harry Potter#Shrieking Shack|Shrieking Shack]].

Umbridge has become a lot less strict with rules after finding out she has a secret admirer, who is revealed to be Dumbledore. The two then begin a [[flirtatious|flirting]] relationship ("Gettin' Along"), and after sweeping "Mr. Umbridge" off her feet, Dumbledore spirits Umbridge away to make love. Meanwhile, the kids are swapping horrific stories about Sirius Black in Hogsmeade, which ends with Hermione being dared to go to the Shrieking Shack and draw a picture of the monster inside. The other kids are scared off by a werewolf howl. When Harry arrives, he convinces Ron that they must go in to save her. They manage to find her, but are then attacked by a werewolf. Harry fends it off by throwing Hermione's cat [[Magical creatures in Harry Potter#Crookshanks|Crookshanks]] at it as bait. The group flees into the [[Hogwarts#Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]], where they each discuss their flaws, but because they are at Hogwarts, those flaws do not matter. Harry and Ron finally accept Hermione as their friend. Suddenly, the werewolf returns, but [[Magical creatures in Harry Potter#Firenze|Firenze]] arrives to save the trio and brings them back to Hogwarts.

While everyone is preparing for the Quidditch match, Neville and Rita Skeeter find Lupin half-naked and covered in blood in the woods with the body of a dead doe, which he claims is part of a pre-game ritual. Meanwhile, Dumbledore tells Snape of his evening with Umbridge, which quickly became a disaster when Dumbledore realized Umbridge was actually a woman. Contrary to this, Umbridge has become very clingy to Dumbledore, but when Snape and Dumbledore break the news to her, she goes back to being her old self, declaring that she will destroy Dumbledore and take his job as headmaster of Hogwarts. Lucius (from the future), arrives to meet with Snape, stating he has a lot riding on the Quidditch match, and replaces the majority of the Slytherin team with Death Eaters in order to kill Harry.

The Quidditch match finally begins ("Let the Games Begin"). At half-time, [[Magical creatures in Harry Potter#Hedwig|Hedwig]] shows up with a package for Harry, but Lucius intercepts it. Hermione manages to get it back by cursing Lucius. Lupin scolds the Gryffindor team for their sloppy playing, but Hermione arrives to give Harry his package, which turns out to be just what he needs: a [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Broomsticks|Firebolt broomstick]]. Draco accidentally interferes with the Death Eaters' attempt on Harry's life and Harry manages to catch the [[Quidditch#The Golden Snitch|Golden Snitch]], winning the game for Gryffindor. Lucius is furious with Draco and crumples up the drawing Draco had made for him, disowning him.

Hermione prepares to leave Hogwarts for the holidays and gives Harry and Ron a scrapbook of their first semester at Hogwarts, including a newspaper clipping about Sirius Black that mentions Harry. Snape charges into the room screaming that Sirius Black has infiltrated Hogwarts. Harry becomes enraged after being reminded that Sirius was the man responsible for his parents' murder and decides to go find him using the Marauder's Map. The map leads Harry, Ron, and Hermione to a room containing a large mirror. As Harry approaches the mirror, he sees two mysterious figures in it. Sirius Black reveals himself and explains that it is [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#The Mirror of Erised|the Mirror of Erised]], which shows one's deepest desires. In the case of both Harry and Sirius, it shows Harry's parents. Sirius explains that he was framed for the murder of Harry's parents, so Harry and Sirius reconcile ("Those Voices"). Sirius then tells the trio that someone named "Little D" helped him escape from [[Places in Harry Potter#Azkaban|Azkaban prison]] and make his way to Hogwarts. Sirius also gives Harry his [[Order of the Phoenix (organisation)#James Potter|father]]'s [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Cloak of Invisibility|Cloak of Invisibility]] as well as telling him that it was he who sent the Firebolt. Hermione sees someone coming on the Marauder's Map, so Sirius tries to throw the Invisibility Cloak over the trio, but Harry ends up putting it on Sirius. Snape arrives and begins taking his anger out on Harry, forcing Sirius to reveal himself. After the two trade insults about how Harry's mother chose James over Snape, Dumbledore and Umbridge show up. Umbridge tries to take Harry, Ron, and Hermione to Azkaban for helping Sirius get into Hogwarts, but Dumbledore tells her that it was he who helped Sirius get in. Umbridge then presents an ultimatum: "Either kiss the dementors, or kiss Umbridge". Desperate, Dumbledore [[Magic in Harry Potter#Apparition and Disapparition|Disapparates]] with Scarfy, leaving Umbridge to take over Hogwarts. As she corrals Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Sirius away, [[Severus Snape|Snape]] looks in the Mirror of Erised and sees [[Lily Evans|Lily]].

===Act II===
Everyone is shaken up by all the new regulations instated by Umbridge, including cancelling the Valentine's Day Dance, removing the moving paintings, and having the Ghostbusters chase away all the ghosts in the school, as well as put strict regulations on what the professors are allowed to teach. Lupin tries to cheer everyone up by teaching them a spell to ward off [[Magical creatures in Harry Potter#Dementors|Dementors]], called the [[List of spells in Harry Potter#Expecto Patronum (Patronus Charm)|Patronus Charm]]. Umbridge interrupts the lesson and fires Lupin due to not following the proper curriculum or even the assigned textbook (to which Lupin replies "That textbook is like a thousand years old! It still refers to dementors as [[ringwraiths]].") Lupin leaves, much to Snape's delight, but apologizes to him for making fun of him when they were children. Umbridge takes the position of Professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts, and introduces "Mama's Little Love Hand", which she threatens them with. Hermione tries to stand up to Umbridge, but Umbridge sees her as herself at her age and promises to mold her in her image, starting by punishing her first. The whole class then stands up for Hermione and Snape decides to step in and take them to Potions class. Umbridge gives up but gives the class detention. She then asks Harry where Dumbledore is hiding, but Harry tells her that even if he did know he wouldn't tell her.

Umbridge is having a good time teasing the Sorting Hat and replacing Dumbledore's Zac Efron poster with one of Taylor Lautner, but still has her doubts about being liked. She is then visited by the spirit of her dead mother who whips Umbridge into shape, and convinces her to kill the students of Hogwarts. Umbridge calls Snape to her office to ask him to kill Harry for her. Lucius also arrives and suggests that he and Umbridge team up to capture Dumbledore and kill Harry. Snape threatens to report their planning to the Ministry of Magic, but Lucius convinces him otherwise by showing Snape his memories of James and [[Order of the Phoenix (organisation)#Lily Potter|Lily Potter]] using the [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Pensieve|Pensieve]] to show him the type of people the Potters really are ("Guys Like Potter").

The students read in ''[[Harry Potter universe#The Daily Prophet|The Daily Prophet]]'' that Sirius has been sentenced to death, and Umbridge will now have Dementors surrounding Hogwarts full-time. While most of the first years are ordered to clean the Owlery, Harry is asked to come to Umbridge's office alone. When Harry arrives, Lucius appears from the shadows and attacks him. As the others are cleaning, Ron assures Hermione that she is nothing like Umbridge (using [[Spider-Man]]  as an analogy like in the first show), and hints that he may have a crush on her. They are interrupted by a message from "Little D," who wants to meet them in order to save Harry. "Little D" is revealed to be Draco, but this Draco is from the future like Lucius. Draco explains that Lucius came back in time to kill Harry and that he, Draco, was actually the one behind helping Sirius escape from Azkaban and having Firenze save Harry and company from the werewolf. Harry wakes up to find Lucius and the Death Eaters preparing to torture him and that Lucius and Umbridge have formed an alliance. Ron, Hermione, and Draco enter the room disguised as Death Eaters and manage to free Harry. Lucius grabs Draco, but Snape enters and saves them, allowing the children to escape.

Harry and company free Sirius and Lupin returns to help. Lupin and Sirius explain that their and James' supposedly deceased friend [[Death Eater#Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]], who was disguised as a nearby [[Taylor Lautner]] poster, was actually behind the crimes Sirius was accused of. Ron tricks Pettigrew by offering him a [[Red Vines|Red Vine]] and the group captures him. As the group prepares to head to the Ministry of Magic to turn Pettigrew in, Lupin sees the [[full moon]] and becomes a werewolf. Pettigrew uses this as a distraction to get away. Lupin attacks Sirius, but suddenly, werewolf calls emanate from the Forbidden Forest, causing Lupin to chase after them. As the kids tend to Sirius, Umbridge appears, determined to finally punish them. Dumbledore returns and stands up to Umbridge, announcing that he is gay and will use force if necessary to end her reign of terror. Umbridge is too strong, however, and refuses to back down ("Stutter"). Harry tries to save Sirius from the Dementors, but passes out.

Dumbledore manages to get the kids out of danger, but tells them to stay put while he goes to search for help. Harry and the others feel all is hopeless, but Draco remembers that he has Lucius' Time Turner, which the group uses to travel back in time one hour. Harry meets up with the past Snape and inspires him to save Harry and friends later on during the fight with Lucius. Ron is still discouraged of their chances for victory, but Harry boosts the group's morale by convincing them that there is a way ("No Way"). Harry and the others run into Lucius, but Draco stands up to him at last and recruits Yaxley to their side. Lucius, however, shocks Draco with a horrible secret: he is not his real father. Years ago, his wife had an affair with their house-elf, Dobby, which resulted in Draco's birth. Lucius gets free and tortures Hermione, making her howl in pain. Before he is able to kill her, Lupin shows up in his werewolf form and kills him.

Harry and the others then arrive at the scene of Umbridge and her dementors just as Dumbledore disapparates with their past selves. They each use the Patronus Charm to scare off the Dementors. Harry is about to take Umbridge down when she grabs hold of him. Firenze arrives just in time to save him and fights an epic battle with Umbridge, which ends with Firenze falling in love with Umbridge's brute incredible strength and taking her as a mate to save the dying race of [[centaur]]s.

Harry, Lupin, and the others provide evidence to clear Sirius' name. Sirius and Lupin, both jobless and homeless, decide to travel the world together. The rest of the people at Hogwarts decide to have a huge party to celebrate ("Hermione Can't Draw (Reprise)"). The future Draco tells Hermione he is not going with as he could run into his past self, causing a [[Grandfather paradox|temporal paradox]]. Before he leaves, he confesses his love for Hermione, but she shoots him down. However, Draco meets [[Dumbledore's Army#Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]], and the two bond over Pigfarts, the wizarding school on Mars. In Dumbledore's office, the Sorting Hat and Scarfy are reunited and they both decide to get married. Harry visits Dumbledore and the two discuss that their days away from Hogwarts are what make the time they have there so precious. Harry and the others all say goodbye for the summer, knowing that there will always be a way back. ("Days of Summer"/"Goin' Back to Hogwarts").

==Development==
Similarly to ''[[A Very Potter Musical]]'', [[Darren Criss]] had altered some of the songs he had already written in order to use them in the musical. The song "Guys Like Potter" was adapted from a song he had written about a friend named Peter, while "Days of Summer" was a [[Running gag|running joke]] in [[StarKid Productions]] as it was a song originally written for the [[web series]] ''[[Little White Lie (web series)|Little White Lie]]'' that ended up not being used until the ''Sequel''. The song "Stutter" was also previously written by Criss, subsequently being used for the musical. The remaining songs in ''Sequel'' were written specifically for the show, and Criss wrote them all in about a month.&lt;ref name="Ew.com"/&gt;

==Productions==
''A Very Potter Sequel'' was performed May&lt;ref name="Ew.com"/&gt; 14&lt;ref name="Billboard"/&gt;-16th, 2010, on the [[University of Michigan]] campus. The video version of the musical premiered in its entirety at Infinitus, a Harry Potter convention.&lt;ref name="Hollywood News"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wizard"/&gt; The video premiered on YouTube July 22, 2010.

==Recording==
{{Main|A Very StarKid Album|A Very Potter Sequel (soundtrack)}}

A formal [[cast recording]] of the musical was not released. However, the musical's songs were recorded by the cast and released on two separate albums. The first, ''[[A Very StarKid Album]]'',&lt;ref name="Hollywood News"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ew.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bandcamp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teamstarkid.bandcamp.com/album/a-very-starkid-album|title=A Very StarKid Album – StarKid|publisher=[[Bandcamp]]|date=August 3, 2010|accessdate=July 30, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110707210802/http://teamstarkid.bandcamp.com/album/a-very-starkid-album| archivedate= July 7, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Billboard2"/&gt; was released alongside the YouTube premiere of ''A Very Potter Sequel'' on July 22, 2010, through [[iTunes]] and [[Amazon.com]].&lt;ref name="iTunes3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/a-very-starkid-album/id382263536|title=A Very StarKid Album bs Various Artists – Download A Very StarKid Album on iTunes|publisher=[[iTunes]]|date=July 22, 2010|accessdate=July 30, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110707154439/http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/a-very-starkid-album/id382263536| archivedate= July 7, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Amazon"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003V0MZA4|title=Amazon.com: A Very StarKid Album: Various Artists: MP3 Downloads|publisher=Amazon.com|date=July 22, 2010|accessdate=July 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album features seven of the musical's twelve songs (excluding the "Hermione Can't Draw (Reprise)" and "Goin' Back to Hogwarts") along with other songs from members of StarKid.

'''"Aussie Aussie Aussie, Oi Oi Oi"''' is a [[cheering|cheer]] or [[chant]] often performed at [[Sport in Australia|Australian sport events]]. It is a variation of the [[Oggy Oggy Oggy]] chant used by both [[association football]] and [[rugby union]] fans in Great Britain from the 1960s onwards. It is usually performed by a [[crowd]] uniting to support a sports team or athlete. The alternate is for an individual to chant the line "Aussie, Aussie, Aussie!" and the crowd to respond with "[[Oi (interjection)|Oi!]] Oi! Oi!". A variation of this is for an individual to chant, "Aussie!", with the crowd responding, "Oi!", along the lines of, "Aussie, Aussie, Aussie!", "Oi, Oi, Oi!"' "Aussie!", "Oi!", "Aussie", Oi!", "Aussie, Aussie, Aussie!", "Oi, Oi, Oi!".

==Definition==
The full version of the chant, as heard prior to a free outdoor concert at the time of the [[Sydney 2000 Olympics]] and quoted by Luba Vangelova of [[CNNSI]],&lt;ref name=LV&gt;{{cite web| first=Luba| last=Vangelova| title=Oi, Oi, Oy| work=CNN Sports Illustrated| date=27 September 2000 | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/news/2000/09/27/sydney_scene/| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105192340/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/news/2000/09/27/sydney_scene/| archivedate=5 November 2013| dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; is as follows:

::Crowd: ''"Oi!"''
:Individual: ''"Aussie!"''
::Crowd: ''"Oi!"''
:Individual (faster): ''"Aussie, Aussie, Aussie!"''
::Crowd (equally fast): ''"Oi! Oi! Oi!"''

The chant was widely used during the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, being heard at many public entertainment venues and also on public transport. The chant came to be commonly heard at international sporting events where an Australian team was competing.

==Origins and explanation==

A chant of similar form, "[[Oggy Oggy Oggy]]", has been used for decades by football crowds in [[Great Britain|Britain]].

Members of the British [[Royal Navy]] claim to have used the Oggy Oggy Oggy chant, or a version of it, since the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/navysong/Data%20Song/S0022%20Oggie%20Song.HTM "Oggie Song" Wednesday, January 18, 2012 Retrieved: July 14, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Englishman Ron Knox claims to have used the "Oggy" chant while playing for the Box Hill Rugby Club in [[Melbourne]] in the late 1960s. Various conflicting stories of how it was introduced from Britain to Australia can be found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_96221.html?nav_src=newsIndexHeadline Aussie 'Oggie, Oi' chant introduced by Englishman] – ''Ananova''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Stephen Alomes, a professor of Australian studies at [[Deakin University]], the chant represents "enthusiasm for the tribe" and a "celebration of 'us'", but at the extreme may act as a symbol of aggressive nationalism and [[xenophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/sport/flagging-jingoism/2006/03/09/1141701636796.html|date=9 March 2006|accessdate=22 May 2007|publisher=The Age|title=More than a game}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, after [[Foxtel]] offered a $10,000 prize in a competition for coming up with a new phrase to cheer on athletes, [[Germaine Greer]] argued:

"The cry is catchy.  Any crowd can pick it up and it cuts through the surrounding white noise like a military tattoo. It is as jingoistic to reject it because it was originally British as it would be to prize it for the same reason ... There will be no silencing Australian fans at the Olympics and they won't be bullied by Foxtel, either."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/political-news/as-chants-would-have-it-aussie-is-here-to-stay-20120726-22s1q.html#ixzz240JIeR7z
|publisher=The Age|title=As chants would have it, 'Aussie' is here to stay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial and publicity uses==
At the closing ceremony of the [[Sydney 2000 Olympics]], the IOC President, [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]] reflected
the spirit of the whole affair when, during his formal speech, he said, "What can I say? Maybe, with my Spanish accent,
Aussie! Aussie! Aussie!". The response to these words came from all around the stadium, "Oi! Oi! Oi!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/story?id=100347|date=1 October 2000|accessdate=3 June 2014|publisher=ABC News|title=Sydney Games Closing Ceremony}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, a [[Melbourne]] couple, inspired by a [[Dick Smith (entrepreneur)|Dick Smith]] campaign supporting Australian-made products, and following publicity surrounding the ownership of the trademark for the Australian-developed [[Ugg boots]] being owned by a United States company, registered the phrase as an official trademark in an effort to protect it from overseas exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/03/04/1078295490745.html|date=4 March 2004|accessdate=22 May 2007|publisher=The Age|title=Oi, Oi, Oi. What's this?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the conclusion of winning the main event of the [[2005 World Series of Poker]], Australian supporters of winner [[Joe Hachem]] chanted this victoriously during the primetime viewing of the [[poker]] event on [[ESPN]].

At the conclusion of the Prize giving ceremony for the [[2008 Super 14 season#Grand final|2008 Super 14 final]] at [[Lancaster Park|AMI Stadium]] in [[Christchurch]], New Zealand, the winning team, the [[Crusaders (rugby)|Crusaders]], chanted "Robbie Robbie Robbie Oi Oi Oi" to farewell their Coach [[Robbie Deans]], who was leaving to coach the Australian national team, the [[Australia national rugby union team|Wallabies]].

It is also a popular chant during [[Australian Cricket Team]]'s matches.

The chant is also a fixture at [[Saint Mary's Gaels men's basketball|men's basketball]] games at [[Saint Mary's College of California]], a school that has regularly featured Australian players in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/9002827/saint-mary-gaels-penalized-recruiting-violations |title=Gaels hit with 'failure to monitor' |author=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=''[[ESPN.com]]'' |date=1 March 2013 |accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Basic Instinct''''' is a 1992 [[neo-noir]] [[erotic thriller]] film directed by [[Paul Verhoeven]] and written by [[Joe Eszterhas]], and starring [[Michael Douglas]] and [[Sharon Stone]]. The film follows a police detective, Nick Curran (Douglas), who is investigating the brutal murder of a wealthy [[Celebrity|rock star]]. During the investigation Curran becomes involved in a torrid and intense relationship with the prime suspect, [[Catherine Tramell]] (Stone), an enigmatic writer.

Even before its release, ''Basic Instinct'' generated heated controversy due to its overt sexuality and graphic depiction of violence. It was strongly opposed by gay rights activists, who criticized the film's depiction of homosexual relationships and the portrayal of a bisexual woman as a murderous, narcissistic [[psychopath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last1 = Leistedt | first1 = Samuel J. | last2 = Linkowski | first2 = Paul | title = Psychopathy and the Cinema: Fact or Fiction? | journal = Journal of Forensic Sciences | date = January 2014 | volume = 59 | issue = 1 | pages = 167–174 | publisher = American Academy of Forensic Sciences | doi = 10.1111/1556-4029.12359 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1556-4029.12359/abstract | accessdate = January 17, 2014 | ref = harv | pmid=24329037}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychitect.com/blogfilm/archives.cfm/category/narcissistic-personality-disorder|title=Dr. Fredricks Cinema Therapy Blog - Narcissistic personality disorder|publisher=Dr. Randi Fredricks, Ph.D.|accessdate=2014-04-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915022411/http://psychitect.com/blogfilm/archives.cfm/category/narcissistic-personality-disorder|archivedate=September 15, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2006 interview, Stone alleged that a scene in which her [[vulva]] was exposed as she crossed her legs was filmed without her knowledge.&lt;ref name="Basic Instinct 2006"&gt;"A Conversation with Sharon Stone" from the ''Basic Instinct'': Ultimate Edition DVD (Lions Gate Home Entertainment, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In [[San Francisco]], homicide detective Nick Curran investigates the murder of retired rock star Johnny Boz, who has been brutally stabbed to death with an [[ice pick]] during sex by a mysterious blonde woman. Nick's only suspect is Boz's [[bisexual]] girlfriend, crime novelist Catherine Tramell, who has written a novel that mirrors the crime. It is concluded that either Catherine is the murderer or someone is attempting to frame her. Catherine is uncooperative and taunting during the investigation, smoking and [[indecent exposure|exposing herself]] during her interrogation. She has an [[alibi]] and passes a lie detector test. Nick discovers Catherine has a history of befriending murderers, including her girlfriend Roxy, who killed her two younger brothers, on impulse, when she was 16, and Hazel Dobkins, who killed her family.

Nick, who accidentally shot two tourists while high on [[cocaine]], attends counseling sessions with police psychologist Dr. Beth Garner, with whom he once had an affair. Nick discovers that Catherine is basing the protagonist of her latest book on him, wherein his character is murdered after falling for the wrong woman. Catherine has bribed Lt. Nielsen for information from Nick's psychiatric file; Beth gives it to Nielsen after he recommends Nick's termination. After Nick assaults Nielsen, he becomes a [[prime suspect]] when Nielsen is killed. Nick suspects Catherine, and when he joins in her behavior in front of his co-workers, he is put on leave.

Nick and Catherine begin a torrid affair with the air of a [[cat-and-mouse game]]. Nick arrives at a club and witnesses Catherine doing coke with Roxy and another man. Nick and Catherine dance, make out, and are later observed having sex by Roxy. Catherine ties Nick to her bed with a white silk scarf the same way the blonde woman did with Boz, but does not kill him. Roxy, jealous of Nick, attempts to run him over with Catherine's car, but dies when the car crashes. Catherine grieves Roxy's death and tells Nick about a previous [[lesbian]] encounter at college that went awry. The girl became obsessed with her, causing Nick to believe that Catherine may not have killed Boz. Nick identifies the girl as Beth, who acknowledges the encounter, but claims it was Catherine who became obsessed.

Nick discovers the final pages of Catherine's book in which the fictional detective finds his partner's body. Catherine breaks off their affair; Nick becomes upset and suspicious. Nick later meets his partner Gus, who has arranged to meet with Catherine's college roommate at an office building to find out what really went on between Catherine and Beth. As Nick waits in the car, Gus is stabbed to death with an ice pick. Nick runs into the building, only to find Gus' body in a manner similar to the scene described in the book. Beth, standing in the hallway, explains that she received a message to meet Gus. Nick suspects she murdered Gus and, believing she is reaching for a gun, shoots her, only to find that Beth was only fingering an ornament on her key chain.

A search of the scene and Beth's apartment turns up the evidence needed to identify her as the killer. Despite knowing Catherine's apparent foreknowledge of Gus' death, that she must actually have been the killer, and that she must have set up Beth, Nick tells no one. He returns to his apartment where Catherine meets him. She explains her reluctance to commit to him and the two have sex. As they discuss their future, an ice pick is revealed to be under the bed.

Filming in San Francisco was attended by [[LGBT social movements|gay and lesbian rights activists]] and demonstrators,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | title = Basic Instinct (Making of, The) | publisher=[[20th Century Fox]] |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and San Francisco Police Department riot police were present at every location daily to deal with the crowds.

In the scene in which Stone's [[vulva]] was exposed on camera as she crossed her legs, Stone believed that the character's not wearing underwear would only be alluded to and not shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N3P20iv2uI| title=Sharon Stone talking about Basic Instinct| via=YouTube| date=2014-09-12| access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had been wearing white underwear until Verhoeven said they reflected light on the camera lens and asked her to take them off, assuring her that only shadow would be visible. It was not until Stone saw the film in a screening room with a [[test audience]] that she became aware of it, leading her to slap Verhoeven in the face and leave the screening.&lt;ref name="Basic Instinct 2006"/&gt; However, Verhoeven strongly denied her claim, and said she was fully aware in advance that her vulva would be filmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pagesix.com/2000/08/20/instinct-tells-him-no/|title=‘INSTINCT’ TELLS HIM NO|date=August 20, 2000|website=Pagesix.com|accessdate=November 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[film score]] to ''Basic Instinct'' was composed by [[Jerry Goldsmith]]. The score to ''Basic Instinct'' garnered Goldsmith nominations for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Academy Award]] and a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score|Golden Globe Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/basic_instinct.html|title=Filmtracks: Basic Instinct (Jerry Goldsmith)|website=Filmtracks.com|accessdate=November 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Goldsmith described it as one of his most challenging efforts, later stating, "''Basic Instinct'' was probably the most difficult I've ever done. It's a very convoluted story with very unorthodox characters. It's a murder mystery, but it isn't really a murder mystery. The director, Paul Verhoeven, had a very clear idea of how the woman should be, and I had a hard time getting it. Because of Paul pushing me, I think it's one of the best scores I've ever written. It was a true collaboration."&lt;ref&gt;Velez, Andy. [http://music.barnesandnoble.com/search/interview.asp?CTR=7251 "Evening the Score" Jerry Goldsmith interview]. [[Barnes &amp; Noble]]. Retrieved 2011-06-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the score, professionally released music did not play a major part in the film. The scene in which source music plays a prominent role occurs during the club scene; Curran, Tramell, and Roxy are seen at Downtown San Francisco. It features "Blue" by Chicago [[house music]] performer [[LaTour]] and "Rave the Rhythm" by the group Channel X. It also features "Movin' on Up" by [[Jeff Barry]] and [[Ja'Net DuBois]].

The soundtrack was released on March 17, 1992. A considerably expanded release of [[Jerry Goldsmith]]'s score, featuring previously omitted sections and alternative compositions of certain elements, was issued by Prometheus Records in 2004.

==Distribution==
[[File:Basic Instinct Cannes 1992.jpg|thumb|right|Director, producer and stars [[Sharon Stone]], [[Jeanne Tripplehorn]] and [[Michael Douglas]] at the [[1992 Cannes Film Festival]].]]
The film was entered into the [[1992 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3/year/1992.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Basic Instinct |accessdate=2009-08-13|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MPAA rating===
''Basic Instinct'' is rated R for "strong violence and sensuality, and for drug use and language". It was initially given an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film ratings|NC-17]] rating by the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]], but under pressure from TriStar, Verhoeven cut 35–40 seconds to gain an R rating.&lt;ref name="nyt920315"/&gt; Verhoeven described the changes in a March 1992 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'': {{cquote|Actually, I didn't have to cut many things, but I replaced things from different angles, made it a little more elliptical, a bit less direct.&lt;ref name="nyt920315"/&gt;}}
The film was subsequently re-released in its uncut format on video and later on DVD.

===Home media===
Following the theatrical version, the film was first released in its uncut format in an unrated version onto video in 1992, running at 129 minutes. This was followed by a DVD release in 1997, in a "barebones" format that contained the R-rated version. A Collector's Edition was released on DVD in 2001, containing the uncut version of the film with a commentary by [[Camille Paglia]] and a small ice-pick (the villain's weapon of choice). This version of the film, running 127 minutes, was re-released twice: in 2003 and 2006.{{Verify source|Basic Instinct|date=April 2008}}

In March 2006, the unrated version (also known as the Director's Cut) was re-released on DVD and labeled as the Ultimate Edition. In 2007, the film was released on Blu-ray with the Director's Cut label.

The film was cut by 35–40 seconds to avoid an NC-17 rating on its theatrical release in 1992,&lt;ref name="nyt920315"/&gt; with some violence and sexuality explicit content removed. The missing or censored material (later released on video and DVD unrated as the ''director's cut'') included:
* The murder of Johnny Boz in the opening scene. Instead, the killer is seen stabbing him in his neck, in the chest, and through his nose. In addition, Tramell is still having violent sex with him while stabbing him at the same time.
* The scene where Nick has sex with Beth is cut in the US theatrical version, as he is seen ripping off her clothes and forcing her over the couch, before a cut to the two of them lying on the floor. In the uncut version they are seen having rougher sex.
* The scene where Nick and Tramell have sex after going to the club is longer and much more explicit in the uncut version.

==Reception==
===Box office===
''Basic Instinct'' opened in theaters in the United States and was one of the [[1992 in film|highest-grossing films of 1992]], after its March 29 release. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $15 million. It was the fourth highest-grossing film of 1992, grossing $352,927,224 worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1992 Worldwide Grosses |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&amp;yr=1992 |accessdate=May 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
The film's critical reaction was mixed. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a score of 54% based on 61 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10 and the consensus: "Unevenly echoing the work of [[Alfred Hitchcock]], ''Basic Instinct'' contains a star-making performance from Sharon Stone, but is ultimately undone by its problematic, overly lurid plot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/basic_instinct/ | title=Basic Instinct | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher=[[Flixster]] | accessdate=February 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]] the film holds a score of 41 based on 28 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/basic-instinct | title=Basic Instinct | work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | accessdate=February 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised the film, saying "''Basic Instinct'' transfers Mr. Verhoeven's flair for action-oriented material to the realm of [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcockian]] intrigue, and the results are viscerally effective even when they don't make sense."&lt;ref&gt;Maslin, Janet. ''Basic Instinct''.

Retrieved November 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' also praised the film, saying it was a guilty pleasure film; he also expressed admiration for Verhoeven's direction, saying "[his] cinematic wet dream delivers the goods, especially when Sharon Stone struts on with enough come-on carnality to singe the screen," and praised Stone's performance: "Stone, a former model, is a knockout; she even got a rise out of Ah-nold in Verhoeven's ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]''. But being the bright spot in too many dull movies (''[[He Said, She Said (film)|He Said, She Said]]''; ''[[Irreconcilable Differences (film)|Irreconcilable Differences]]'') stalled her career. Though ''Basic Instinct'' establishes Stone as a bombshell for the Nineties, it also shows she can nail a laugh or shade an emotion with equal aplomb."&lt;ref&gt;Travers, Peter. ''Basic Instinct''. [https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/basic-instinct-19920320 ''Rolling Stone'']. Retrieved March 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The international critical reception was favorable, with [[Australia]]n critic Shannon J. Harvey of the ''[[Sunday Times]]'' calling it one of the "1990s['] finest productions, doing more for female empowerment than any [[Feminism|feminist]] rally. Stone – in her star-making performance – is as hot and sexy as she is ice-pick cold."&lt;ref name="RottenTomatoes"&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/movies/basicinstinct] {{dead link|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was not without its detractors.&lt;ref name="CB1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lundin|first=Leigh |title=Erotic Mystery Thrillers |url=http://www.criminalbrief.com/?p=13152|work=sex-n-violence |publisher=Criminal Brief |date=2010-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' dismissed the film, giving it two out of four stars, stating that the film is well crafted, yet dies down in the last half hour: "The film is like a crossword puzzle. It keeps your interest until you solve it. Then it's just a worthless scrap with the spaces filled in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19920320/REVIEWS/203200301/1023|title=Basic Instinct Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (1992) - Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last=Ebert|website=Rogerebert.suntimes.com|accessdate=November 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dave Kehr]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' also gave a negative review, calling it psychologically empty: "Verhoeven does not explore the dark side, but merely exploits it, and that makes all the difference in the world." &lt;ref&gt;Kehr, Dave. "''Blatant 'Instinct' – Thriller Crosses The Line Into Exploitation''."

===Controversy===
The film generated [[controversy]] due to its overt sexuality and graphic depiction of violence. During principal photography, the film was protested against by [[gay rights]] activists who felt that the film followed a pattern of negative depiction of homosexuals in film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toobeautiful.org/lat0429.html Los Angeles Times, April 29, 1991: Gays Bashing ''Basic Instinct''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060727164513/http://www.toobeautiful.org/lat0429.html |date=July 27, 2006 }}. See also Phyllis Burke, ''Family Values: Two Moms and Their Son''. New York: Random House (1993), which covers the protests over several chapters.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the lesbian and bisexual activist group LABIA protested against the film on its opening night. Others also picketed theatres to dissuade people from attending screenings, carrying signs saying "Kiss My Ice Pick", "Hollywood Promotes Anti-Gay Violence" and "Catherine Did It!"/"Save Your Money—The Bisexual Did It".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Couvares|first=Francis G.|title=Movie Censorship and American Culture|isbn=1-55849-575-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=D5R7NNAuH1AC&amp;pg=PA298&amp;lpg=PA298|edition=2nd|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verhoeven himself defended the groups' right to protest, however he criticized the disruptions they caused, saying "[[Fascism]] is not in raising your voice; the fascism is in not accepting the no."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keesey|first=Douglas|year=2005|title=Paul Verhoeven|page=130|isbn=3-8228-3101-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] mentioned the controversy in his review, saying "As for the allegedly offensive homosexual characters: The movie's protesters might take note of the fact that this film's [[Heterosexuality|heterosexuals]], starting with Douglas, are equally offensive. Still, there is a point to be made about Hollywood's unremitting insistence on typecasting homosexuals&amp;mdash;particularly lesbians&amp;mdash;as twisted and evil."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19920320/REVIEWS/203200301/1023 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=Basic Instinct}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Camille Paglia]] denounced gay activist and feminist protests against ''Basic Instinct'', and called Sharon Stone's performance "one of the great performances by a woman in screen history", praising her character as 
"a great vamp figure, like Mona Lisa herself, like a pagan goddess".&lt;ref&gt;Paglia, Camille. ''Vamps &amp; Tramps: New Essays''. London: Penguin Books, 1994. p. 489&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was also widely criticized for glamorizing cigarette smoking. Screenwriter [[Joe Eszterhas]] was later diagnosed with [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]] and publicly apologized for glamorizing smoking in his films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3581820/A-smoking-star-is-a-loaded-gun.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=A smoking star is a loaded gun | first=Ian | last=Ball | date=August 22, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Baudolino''''' is a [[2000 in literature|2000]] novel by [[Umberto Eco]] about the adventures of a man named Baudolino in the known and mythical [[Christianity|Christian]] world of the 12th century.

''Baudolino'' was translated into English in 2001 by [[William Weaver]]. The novel presented a number of particular difficulties in translation, not the least of which is that there are ten or so pages written in a made-up language that is a mixture of Latin, medieval Italian and other languages (intended to reconstruct how a barely-literate Italian peasant boy of the 12th century would have tried to write in the vernacular).

==Plot summary==
In the year of 1204, Baudolino of [[Alessandria]] enters [[Constantinople]], unaware of the [[Fourth Crusade]] that has thrown the city into chaos. In the confusion, he meets [[Niketas Choniates]] and saves his life. Niketas is amazed by his language genius, speaking many languages he has never heard, and on the question: if he is not part of the crusade, who is he? Baudolino begins to recount his life story to Niketas.

His story begins in 1155, when Baudolino – a highly talented Italian peasant boy – is sold to and adopted by the emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]]. At court and on the battlefield, he is educated in reading and writing [[Latin]] and learns about the power struggles and battles of northern [[Italy]] at the time. He is sent to [[Paris]] to become a scholar.

In Paris, he gains friends (such as the [[Archpoet]], Abdul, [[Robert de Boron]] and [[Kyot]], the purported source of [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]'s ''[[Parzival]]'') and learns about the legendary kingdom of [[Prester John]]. From this event onward, Baudolino dreams of reaching this fabled land.

The earlier parts of the story follow the general historical and geographical outlines of 12th-century Europe, with special emphasis on the Emperor Frederick's futile efforts to subdue the increasingly independent and assertive city states of Northern Italy. Baudolino, being both a beloved adopted son to the Emperor and a loyal native of the newly founded and highly rebellious town of [[Alessandria]], plays a key role in effecting reconciliation between the Emperor and the Alessandria townspeople, who are led by Baudolino's biological father; a way is found for the Emperor to recognize Alessandria's independence without losing face. (It is no accident that Alessandria is Umberto Eco's own hometown.)

The  incident of the death of Emperor Frederick, while on the [[Third Crusade]], is a key element of the plot. This part involves an element of [[secret history]] – the book asserts that Emperor Frederick had not drowned in a river, as history records, but died mysteriously at night while hosted at the castle of a sinister Armenian noble. This part also constitutes a [[Historical mystery|historical detective mystery]] – specifically, a historical [[locked room mystery]] – with various suspects suggested, each of whom had a clever means of killing the Emperor, and with Baudolino acting as the detective.

After the Emperor's death, Baudolino and his friends set off on a long journey, encompassing 15 years, to find the Kingdom of Prester John. From the moment when they depart eastwards, the book becomes pure fantasy – the lands which the band travels bearing no resemblance to the continent of Asia at that or any other historical time, being rather derived from the various myths which Europeans had about Asia – including the aforementioned Christian myth of the Kingdom of Prester John, as well as the Jewish myth of the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] and the River [[Sambation]], and some earlier accounts provided by [[Herodotos]]. Baudolino meets [[eunuch]]s, [[unicorn]]s, [[Blemmyes (legendary creatures)|Blemmyes]], [[Monopod (creature)|skiapods]] and [[Pygmy (mythology)|pygmies]]. At one point, he falls in love with a female [[satyr]]-like creature who recounts to him the full [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] creation myth; [[Gnosticism]] is a pervasive presence in another of Eco's novels, ''[[Foucault's Pendulum]]''. Philosophical debates are mixed with comedy, epic adventure and creatures drawn from the strangest medieval bestiaries.

After many disastrous adventures, the destruction of Prester John's Kingdom by the [[Hephthalite Empire|White Huns]] followed by a long stint of slavery at the hands of the [[Rashid_ad-Din_Sinan|Old Man of the Mountain]], Baudolino and surviving members of his band of friends return to Constantinople undergoing the agony of the Fourth Crusade – the book's starting point. The wise and rather cynical Niketas Choniates helps Baudolino to at last discover the truth about how the Emperor Frederick died – with shattering results for Baudolino and his friends.

'''The bushranger ban''' refers to a ban on films about [[bushrangers]] that came in effect in Australia in 1911-12. Films about bushrangers had been the most popular genre of local films ever since ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'' (1906). Governments were worried about the influence this would have on the population and bans against films depicting bushrangers were introduced in [[South Australia]] (1911), [[New South Wales]] (a 1912 amendment to the 1908 New South Wales Theatres and Public Halls Act&lt;ref&gt;Graham Shirley &amp; Brian Adams, ''Australian Cinema The First Eighty Years'', Currency Press 1989 p 53&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] (1912).&lt;ref&gt;[http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/film-in-australia "Films in Australia", ''Australia.gov.au''] accessed 2 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15376293 |title=THE CENSOR. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=18 November 1912 |accessdate=4 May 2013 |page=8 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision had a considerable impact on the local industry as it meant filmmakers could not work in a popular genre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/01/28/1043534055850.html Philippa Hawker, "Cinema's anti-hero rides again", ''The Age'', 29 January 2003] accessed 2 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Australian film production, which in 1911 was one of the highest in the world, went into decline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aso.gov.au/chronology/1910s/ Australian film and television chronology] at [[Australian Screen Online]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sensesofcinema.com/2001/feature-articles/oz_western/ More Australian than Aristotelian: The Australian Bushranger Film, 1904-1914by William D. Routt December 2001, ''Senses of Cinema''] accessed 2 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The ban was still in effect in the 1930s and hurt efforts to make a number of Australian movies, including an adaptation of ''[[Robbery Under Arms]]'' from director [[Ken G. Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51199259 |title=HOLLYWOOD Bushranger Film is "OUT". |newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]] | date=27 October 1934 |accessdate=2 May 2013 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17119163 |title=BONUSES FOR FILMS. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=20 October 1934 |accessdate=12 May 2013 |page=20 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ban on a film about [[Ned Kelly]], ''[[When the Kellys Rode]]'' was not lifted until 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47176334 |title=FILM OF KELLY GANG. |newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |location=Perth |date=7 January 1942 |accessdate=3 May 2013 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hollywood bushranging film ''[[Stingaree (1934 film)|Stingaree]]'' (1934) was screened in every state of Australia except for New South Wales because of the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article96373244 |title="OUT!"

== ''The Story of the Kelly Gang'' ==
[[File:The Story of the Kelly Gang - Poster.jpg|thumb|Poster for ''The Story of the Kelly Gang'' (1906)]]
The bushranger genre of Australian film fictionalized the experiences of [[Bushranger|bushrangers]] from Australian history. Bushrangers were outlaws, most active in the 19th century, and remembered in Australian folklore for their acts of robbery and violent crime, including murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.records.nsw.gov.au/archives/collections-and-research/guides-and-indexes/bushrangers-nsw|title=Bushrangers in NSW|website=www.records.nsw.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genre showed how the bushrangers’ intimate connection with the bush allowed them to skirt the law and engage in outlaw activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheckels|first=Theodore F.|date=June 1998|title="New Wave" Cinema's Redefinition of Australian Heroism|url=|journal=Antipodes|volume=12|pages=29-36|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the films made before the ban glorified bushrangers, rather than making them seem criminal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793340159|title=Historical dictionary of crime films|last=Geoff,|first=Mayer,|isbn=9780810867697|location=Lanham, Md.|oclc=793340159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early bushranger films include ''[[Bushranging in North Queensland|Bushranging in Northern Queensland]]'' and ''Robbery of a Mail Coach by Bushrangers.'' Both were released in 1904 and ran five minutes long and six minutes long respectively.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/757462033|title=Australian horror films, 1973-2010|last=1962-|first=Shelley, Peter,|date=2012|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers|isbn=9780786461677|location=Jefferson, N.C.|oclc=757462033}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'', about the bushranger [[Ned Kelly]], was released in [[Melbourne]] on December 26, 1906.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ''The Story of the Kelly Gang'' is notable for being the first feature film ever made.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At the time of its release, it was considered to be the longest film that had ever been made, running at around seventy to eighty minutes.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/exhibitions/irish_in_australia/bushrangers|title=National Museum of Australia - Bushrangers|last=|first=|date=|website=www.nma.gov.au|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the majority of the bushranger films that would follow it, ''The Story of the Kelly Gang'' was relatively sympathetic to the outlaws whose lives it fictionalized. As a result, the government of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] tried to censor it when it was first released, claiming that it was encouraging crime. It was banned in two towns that had a relation to the gang presented in the movie.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Despite government discontent, ''The Story of the Kelly Gang'' was a major commercial success, both nationally and internationally. One of the producers of the film stated that it made 25,000 pounds, in comparison to its budget of 1000 pounds.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Bushranger films from 1906 to 1912 ==
[[File:Mad Dog Morgan.jpg|thumb|252x252px|Wood carving of the bushranger Dan "Mad Dog" Morgan]]
The success of ''The Story of the Kelly Gang'' encouraged filmmakers to produce even more bushranger films.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/587198895|title=Australia &amp; New Zealand|date=2010|publisher=Intellect Books|others=Goldsmith, Ben, 1967-, Lealand, Geoffrey.|isbn=9781841503738|location=Bristol, UK|oclc=587198895}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1900 and 1914, one hundred and sixteen bushranger films were made in Australia.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/910448038|title=Censorship : a World Encyclopedia.|last=Stockbridge|first=Sally L.|date=2015|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=|isbn=9781136798641|editor-last=Jones|editor-first=Derek|location=Hoboken|pages=|chapter="Australia: Film and Video"|oclc=910448038}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most, if not all, of these films focused on the lives of white male bushrangers.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/435778744|title=The A to Z of Australian and New Zealand cinema|last=Albert.|first=Moran,|date=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|others=Vieth, Errol, 1950-, Moran, Albert.|isbn=9780810863477|location=Lanham|oclc=435778744}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few of the most significant bushranger films made in this period include ''[[Thunderbolt (1910 film)|Thunderbolt]]'' (1910), ''[[Captain Midnight, the Bush King]]'' (1911), multiple adaptations of the classic bushranger novel ''[[Robbery Under Arms]]'', and ''[[Dan Morgan (film)|Dan Morgan]]'' (1911). ''Dan Morgan'' was notable for depicting its protagonist, the historical outlaw [[Dan Morgan (bushranger)|Dan Morgan]], as a true criminal, rather than an anti-hero.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793340159|title=Historical dictionary of crime films|last=Geoff,|first=Mayer,|isbn=9780810867697|location=Lanham, Md.|oclc=793340159}}&lt;/ref&gt; The graphic violence of ''Dan Morgan'' was unlike the content of any bushranger film before it, and it spurred the governments of New South Wales and Victoria to pass regulations on film content the very next year.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Theatres and Public Halls Act of 1912 ==
In 1912, New South Wales’s Theatres and Public Halls Act was amended to directly target the content of films. Specifically, the 1912 amendment was meant to prohibit the screening of “objectionable” films – films with&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/117688374?searchTerm=bushranger%20film%20ban%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;searchLimits=l-availability=y&amp;#124;&amp;#124;&amp;#124;l-australian=y&amp;#124;&amp;#124;&amp;#124;l-decade=191|title=Censoring Films: Regulations Gazetted.|last=|first=|date=November 6, 1912|work=Evening News|access-date=|location=Sydney, NSW}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“scenes suggestive of immorality or indecency, executions, murders, or other revolting scenes; scenes of debauchery, low habits of life, or other scenes such as would have a demoralizing effect on young person; successful crime, such as bushranging, robberies, or other acts of lawlessness…”&lt;/blockquote&gt;The New South Wales government claimed that the Theatres and Public Halls Act of 1912 was meant to protect film audiences, particularly young audiences, from “injurious influence.”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This included the criminal activity of bushrangers. They were also against most bushranger films' depiction of the police as an antagonistic force.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Anyone going against the Act could be subject to a fine of up to 20 pounds.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The police were placed in charge of censoring films in accordance with the standards set by the 1912 amendment. They were to look over film summaries in order to determine their appropriateness, and could also demand a screening of a film if they thought it contained any “objectionable” material.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Censorship of film imports and exports ==
In 1917, state censor boards were supplemented by a national Commonwealth Film Censorship Board. The national Censorship Board judged the content of imported films, primarily those from Britain and the USA. State censor boards could take additional action if they believed that the Commonwealth Film Censorship Board had acted too leniently.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In 1920, the Chief Secretary of Victoria attempted to prevent the development of a film about the [[Kelly Gang]] that he believed would spread a negative image of Victoria. The Australian government feared that attempts to ban the film in Australia would result in its international distribution. The government worried that the international release of any films that portrayed Australia negatively would damage the country’s global image. Though the government could not intervene in the creation of a film, it could control its distribution. That year, the Minister of Customs was placed in charge of regulating the export of films from Australia to other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/127388446?searchTerm=bushranger%20film%20ban%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=192&amp;#124;&amp;#124;&amp;#124;l-australian=y|title=Export of Films: Why Prohibition Was Applied.|last=|first=|date=January 3, 1920|work=The Maitland Weekly Mercury|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact of the ban on Australian film ==
Before the bushranger ban, bushranging had been the most common topic for Australian films. After the ban, film production in Australia decreased as creators lost their most popular genre and the audiences it drew to the theatres.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Unsurprisingly, the new censorship forces were met with discontent from the Australian film industry. H.M. Hawkins, the managing director of [[Spencer's Pictures|Spencer’s Pictures]], argued that censorship would limit the industry’s ability grow, since depictions of crime were essential to the creation of a successful drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/228833817?searchTerm=bushranger%20film%20ban%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;searchLimits=l-availability=y&amp;#124;&amp;#124;&amp;#124;l-australian=y&amp;#124;&amp;#124;&amp;#124;l-decade=191|title=Film Censorship "Will Cripple the Picture Business"|last=|first=|date=November 17, 1912|work=The Sun|access-date=|location=Sydney, NSW}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December of 1916, a week after a violent film about gambling was prevented from being screened, a group of Australian film exhibitors gathered to discuss the impact of censorship on their business.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/121345461?searchTerm=bushranger%20film%20ban%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;searchLimits=l-availability=y&amp;#124;&amp;#124;&amp;#124;l-australian=y&amp;#124;&amp;#124;&amp;#124;l-decade=191|title=Film Censorship: Exhibitors Meet To-Day|last=|first=|date=December 17, 1916|work=Sunday Times|access-date=|location=Sydney, NSW}}&lt;/ref&gt; They expressed frustration with the fact that the police were in charge of film censors, claiming that the police department was most threatened by bushranger films' depictions of crime and as a result was hardest on crime in film over all other content.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; They also pointed out that films were being censored far more harshly than written material with the same content.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The primary threat the New South Wales government saw in bushranger films was their apparent glorification of crime. As a result, some bushranger films could get through the censors if the criminal activity they depicted was condemned within the film and law enforcement wasn’t shown in a negative light.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, because of the stigma that had developed around the genre, few directors were willing to risk making bushranger films, especially if they had established reputations to uphold. In 1920, the director [[Raymond Longford]] avoided adapting ''Robbery Under Arms'' in order to preserve his status within the Australian film industry.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Decline of the bushranger ban ==

The end of the bushranger ban was arguably indicated by the 1942 release of ''[[When the Kellys Rode]]'' in New South Wales. ''When the Kellys Rode'', a bushranger film about the Kelly Gang, had been banned in 1934. It was the last film banned under the Theatres and Public Halls Act for bushranging content.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/18077432?searchTerm=bushranger%20film%20ban%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;searchLimits=l-australian=y&amp;#124;&amp;#124;&amp;#124;l-decade=194|title=Film Banned in N.S.W.: 'Brighton Rock'|last=|first=|date=July 10, 1948|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack Baddeley]], Chief Secretary of New South Wales, finally allowed it to screen in New South Wales in the midst of [[World War II]], claiming that the crimes that the film depicted were nothing compared to “the unbridled horrors of war.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/205278235?searchTerm=bushranger%20film%20ban%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;searchLimits=l-availability=y&amp;#124;&amp;#124;&amp;#124;l-australian=y|title=Ban on Kelly Gang Film Removed|last=|first=|date=January 7, 1942|work=The Age|access-date=|location=Melbourne, Victoria}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ''When the Kellys Rode'', the Theatres and Public Halls Act was invoked again by Chief Secretary Baddeley to ban the violent British film ''[[Brighton Rock (1948 film)|Brighton Rock]]''. ''Brighton Rock'' had been allowed into Australia by the Commonwealth Film Censorship Appeals Board, and the Chief Secretary would state no reason for the decision to ban the film in New South Wales.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

By the time that bushranger ban was finally lifted in the 1940s, the popularity of and demand for the genre had already faded.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Even after bushranging in film was legal, at least one attempt to produce a bushranger film was met with discontent from Australian citizens. In 1947, residents of [[Glenrowan, Victoria|Glenrowan]], a town associated with the Kelly Gang, protested against [[Harry Southwell]]’s plans to shoot a film about Ned Kelly in their town. Glenrowan’s farmers sent a petition to Parliament to ban the film, claiming that bushranger films had given a negative reputation to the descendants of the Kelly Gang.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/161306059?searchTerm=bushranger%20film%20ban%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;searchLimits=l-australian=y&amp;#124;&amp;#124;&amp;#124;l-decade=194|title=Ned Kelly Revival: Bitter Opposition to Film|last=|first=|date=August 16, 1947|work=National Advocate|access-date=|location=Bathurst, New South Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The game was originally created as a [[Ludum Dare]] prototype by [[Ján Ilavsky]].

==Gameplay==
Chameleon Run is an auto runner and does require the user to do anything else but short and long jumps by holding the screen and to allow colour change between 2 of the same characters, the first is purple and the second is yellow. Player controls his cube-like character that moves to the right and forward direction. The player's task is to help him to get to the end on the white cubic road. He has to jump over obstacles and pits. The game features an original mechanic &lt;!--mechanism?--&gt; that the player can touch only objects that have the same colour as his character. Player has to switch his player´s colour so that he can move on different platforms. Every level features three tasks—finish level, collect all coins and crystals and to finish level without switching colour.&lt;ref name="TechCrunch"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Felicia|title=Game Review: Chameleon Run|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/15/game-review-chameleon-run/|website=TechCrunch|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Comic Cavalcade''''' was an [[anthology]] comic book published by [[DC Comics]] from 1942 to 1954.

Most American comic book publishers in the 1930s and 1940s [[Golden Age of comic books]] published anthology titles that showcased a variety of characters, usually with one star—such as [[Alan Scott|Green Lantern]] in ''[[All-American Comics]]'' or [[Wonder Woman]] in ''[[Sensation Comics]]''. ''Comic Cavalcade'', however, featured both those star characters as well as the [[Jay Garrick|Flash]], a star in his own namesake title as well as the spin-off ''[[All-Flash]]''.

At 96 pages initially, ''Comic Cavalcade'' was about one-and-one-half-times the length of the average comic book of the time. It was priced at 15 cents, when the average comic cost a dime.
&lt;!--[[Image:ComicCavalcade38.jpg|thumb|''Comic Cavalcade'' #38 (April-May [[1950 in comics|1950]]), with The Fox and the Crow; The Dodo and the Frog; and Nutsy Squirrel. Artist unknown.]]--&gt;
Many stories in ''Comic Cavalcade'' were scripted by other than the characters' regular writers, for deadline reasons.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} [[Batman]] writer [[Bill Finger]], for example, would occasionally write Flash stories for ''Comic Cavalcade'' when regular Flash writer [[Gardner Fox]] was preoccupied with other projects.

One non-superhero ongoing character introduced in ''Comic Cavalcade'' was newspaperman Johnny Peril. His roots, prior to his first appearance, came in the one-off story "Just a Story" in issue #15 (July 1946), by writer-artist [[Howard Purcell]]. With issue #22 (Sept. 1947), the anthological "Just a Story" series gained Peril as, generally, a witness or narrator rather than as an integral part of the narrative. With this issue, the series title became "Johnny Peril Tells Just a Story", eventually changed to  "Johnny Peril's Surprise Story" as Johnny became the series' two-fisted hero until the series ended with issue #29 (Nov. 1948). The character went on to appear in his own feature in ''[[All-Star Comics]]'', ''Danger Trail'' and ''[[Sensation Comics]]'' through 1953. He returned in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] in 1958, in ''[[The Unexpected]]''.&lt;ref name=toonopedia&gt;[http://toonopedia.com/jperil.htm Johnny Peril] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]. [https://www.webcitation.org/6XEJtuSP0 Archived] from the original on March 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially published quarterly, the title went bi-monthly beginning with #14 (April–May [[1946 in comics|1946]]). It was revamped completely with #30 (December–January [[1948 in comics|1948]]), becoming a [[funny-animal]] [[humor]] book when [[superhero]]es faded from popularity in the post-war era. Featured were [[animator]] [[Frank Tashlin]]'s [[movie]]-[[cartoon]] duo ''[[The Fox and the Crow]]'', along with cartoonist [[Woody Gelman]]'s creations, ''[[The Dodo and the Frog]]'' and ''[[Nutsy Squirrel]]''. The book's length by this time had been reduced to 76 pages.

The title would later be referenced with DC's 1970s ''[[Cancelled Comic Cavalcade]]'' series.

'''Danish folk dance''' is characterized by being easy going, gentle, and relatively easy to learn.

The canonized history of Danish folk dance highlights a performance by Philochoros in [[Copenhagen]] in 1899 with some Danish students in the audience as a triggering factor. The students were immediately so inspired that they started a folk dance club. In 1901 some of the same students who were now students of gymnastics founded a formal organization, the Danish Association for the Promotion of Folk-Dancing (Foreningen til Folkedansens Fremme).&lt;ref&gt;Hoppu, Petri and Karen Vedel (2014).

The '''dramatistic pentad''' forms the core structure of [[dramatism]], a method for examining motivations that the renowned [[literary critic]] [[Kenneth Burke]] developed.  Dramatism recommends the use of a [[metalinguistic]] approach to stories about human action that investigates the roles and uses of five [[rhetoric]]al elements common to all narratives, each of which is related to a question. These five rhetorical elements form the "dramatistic pentad." Burke argues that an evaluation of the relative emphasis that is given to each of the five elements by a human drama enables a determination of the motive for the behaviour of its [[Character (arts)|character]]s. A character's stress on one element over the others suggests their [[world view]].

Burke introduced the pentad in his 1945 book "A Grammar of Motives". Burke based his pentad on the scholastic hexameter which defines "questions to be answered in the treatment of a topic: Who, what, where, by what means, why, how, when".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "A Grammar of Motives". University of California Press, 1969, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; Burke created the pentad by combining several of the categories in the scholastic hexameter. The result was a pentad that has the five categories of: act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose. Burke states, "The 'who' is obviously covered by agent. Scene covers the 'where' and the 'when'. The 'why' is purpose. 'How' and 'by what means' fall under agency. All that is left to take care of is act in our terms and 'what' in the scholastic formula".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "A Grammar of Motives". University of California Press, 1969, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pentad also closely follows the journalistic '[[Five Ws]]': who, what, when, where, why. 'Who' maps to agent. 'What' maps to action. 'When' and 'Where' map to scene. 'Why' maps to purpose. There is no direct mapping from the Five Ws to the pentads category of agency but Geoff Hart states "Some authorities add a sixth question, “how”, to this list, but “how to” information generally fits under what, where, or when, depending on the nature of the information." &lt;ref&gt;"The Five Ws of Online Help". by Geoff Hart, TECHWR-L. Retrieved April 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetorical elements of the dramatistic pentad==
The dramatistic pentad comprises the five rhetorical elements: Act, Scene, Agent, Agency, and Purpose. The “world views” listed below reflect the prominent schools of thought during Burke’s time, “without dismissing any of them," to read them "at once sympathetically and critically in relation to each other," and "in a wider context than any of them recognizes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fergusson|first1=Francis|title=Kenneth Burke's A Grammar of Motives|date=1957|publisher=Doubleday Anchor Books|location=NY|pages=193–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Act===
Act, which is associated with dramatic action verbs and answers the question "what?", is related to the world view of [[Philosophical realism|realism]]; What happened? What is the action? What is going on? What action; what thoughts? Burke defines the act as that which “names what took place, in thought or deed.” Since an act is likely composed of many separate actions, Burke states that “any verb, no matter how specific or general, that has connotations of consciousness or purpose falls under this category.”&lt;ref name="A Grammar of Motives"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scene===
Scene, which is associated with the [[Setting (fiction)|setting]] of an act and answers the questions "when?" and "where?", is related to the world view of [[materialism]] and minimal or non-existent [[free will]]. Burke defines the scene as “the background of an act, the situation in which it occurred.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agent===
Agent, which answers the question "by whom?", reflects the world view of [[philosophical idealism]]. Burke defines the agent as “what person or kind of person performed the act.” &lt;ref name="A Grammar of Motives"/&gt;

===Agency===
Agency (means), which is associated with the person or the organization that committed the deed and answers the question "how?", implies a [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] point of view. Burke defines agency as “what instrument or instruments he used.”&lt;ref name="A Grammar of Motives"/&gt;

===Purpose===
Purpose, which is associated with meaning and answers the question "why?", indicates that the agent seeks unity through identification with an ultimate meaning of life. Reflects the world view of mysticism. Purpose is inextricably linked to the analysis of “Motive” which, derived from the title of A Grammar of Motives, is the main subject of its analysis. Since Purpose is both the subject of analysis and an element of the dramatistic pentad, it is not a common element to be included in a ratio.

==Ratios within the dramatistic pentad==
In A Grammar of Motives, Burke provides a system of analysis for the Scene-Act ratio and the Scene-Agent ratio, though his analysis of ratios in the analysis of rhetoric is not limited to these. He states that, “The principles of dramatic consistency would lead one to expect such cases of overlap among the terms; but while being aware of them we should firmly fix in our minds such cases as afford a clear differentiation. Our terms leaning themselves towards merger and division, we are here trying to divide two of them while recognizing their possibilities of merger.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus any two dramatistic elements can be analyzed in relation to each other, creating a ratio, and can produce individual, yet separate meanings which are equally valid. However, the rhetor’s selection of elements to compose a ratio should be scrutinized, as it can deflect attention away from or direct attention towards aspects of the rhetor’s desire.

This is what Burke calls the “Ubiquity of the Ratios,” claiming that the composition of ratios “are at the very centre of motivational assumptions,” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1307}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, “The maxim ‘terrain determines tactics’ is a strict localization of the scene-act ratio, with ‘terrain’ as the casuistic equivalent for ‘scene’ in a military calculus of motives, and ‘tactics’ as the corresponding ‘act.’"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|page=1308}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The analysis of a situation as a multi-faceted occurrence is central to Burke’s concept of ratios. 
Likewise, the substitution of a dramatistic element with another can change an interpretation of the motive, allowing the analyst to modify the ratio in order to highlight the importance of a specific factor. For example, “the resistance of the Russian armies to the Nazi invasion could be explained ‘scenically’ in terms of the Soviet political and economic structure; or one could use the act-agent ratio, attributing the power and tenacity to ‘Russian’ traits of character. However, in deriving the act from the scene, one would have to credit socialism as a major scenic factor, whereas a derivation of the act from agents would allow for a much more felicitous explanation from the standpoint of capitalist apologists.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rhetor-agent also has a significant amount of power in crafting the perception of these ratios to their effect, “If an agent acts in keeping with his nature as an agent (act-agent ratio), he may change the nature of the scene accordingly (scene-act ratio) and thereby establish a state of unity between himself and his world (scene-agent ratio)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scene-Act ratio===
The scene, or the setting, will contain the act, or the what/actions. The way in which the agent interacts with the scene draws out specific analyses usually related to the atmosphere of the setting. While Burke states that, “It is a principle of drama that the nature of acts and agents should be consistent with the nature of the scene,” some “comic and grotesque works may deliberately set these elements at odds with one another, audiences make allowances for such liberty, which reaffirms the same principle of consistency in its very violation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1302}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reflects the division of most plays into very literal “acts,” as the agents who construct the scene are very literally “acters” whose work is played against the backdrop of the scene.The actions that a person performs are interpreted through the setting or happenings.&lt;ref name="Burke1978"&gt;Burke,Kenneth."Questions and Answers about the Pentad". National Council of Teachers of English, 1978, p. 332-333.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scene-Agent ratio===
A relationship between the agent (person) and the scene (place or setting). A scene can pose restrictions on the agent; in a narrative, the person and place should have some connection.&lt;ref name="Burke1978" /&gt;

===Act-Agent ratio===
While requiring the scene to contain them, the agent does not contain the act. Burke states that, “the agent is an author of his acts,” which can “make him or remake him in accordance with their nature.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1309}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the main principles that separates act and agent, producing a linked cycle which constructs the presentation of the agent’s identity.

==A sixth element==
In A Grammar of Motives, Burke mentions that attitude is “a state of mind,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Situation|date=2001|page=1302}}&lt;/ref&gt; remaining exterior from the pentad, as it is often “a preparation for an act, which would make it kind of symbolic act, or incipient act. But in its character as a state of mind that may or may not lead to an act, it is clearly classified under the head of agent.”. Burke also refers to attitude as a variation of agency.&lt;ref name=Anderson2010 /&gt; Prior to 1969 the term attitude is placed under agency, act or agent and is not considered a sixth element.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "A Grammar of Motives". University of California Press, 1969, p. 476&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1969, Burke places attitude as a new sixth element, yet he does not refer to the pentad as a hexad.&lt;ref name="Anderson2010"&gt;Anderson, F. D., &amp; Althouse, M. T. (2010). “Five Fingers or Six? Pentad or Hexad”. KB Journal, 6(2). Retrieved October 27, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Attitude is defined as "the preparation for an act, which would make it a kind of symbolic act, or incipient act." The attitude, like the agency, would answer the “how?”.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. (1965). “Permanence and Change”. 1954. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill.&lt;/ref&gt; There is still some uncertainty over whether attitude is an additional element, and thus makes the dramatistic pentad a hexad, or if it is still a sub-element of the original pentad.&lt;ref name="Anderson2010" /&gt; While Burke has never directly stated that the pentad is a hexad, he has admitted that the addition of attitude to the pentad is similar to gaining “another soul” or an “extra existence.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew|title=Disciplining The Master: Finding the Via Media for Kenneth Burke|journal=American Communication Journal|date=2001|volume=4|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have read this as Burke’s desire not to “dispose of” ambiguity, but rather to “study and clarify the resources of ambiguity.”&lt;ref name=Anderson2010 /&gt; As a result, many diagrams of the pentad depict attitude as a derivative of agent.

'''Désiré''' is a French [[indie video game|indie]] [[Adventure game#Point-and-click adventure games|point-and-click adventure video game]] by Sylvain Seccia, it was published in 2016. The game is about the titular character, Désiré, an [[Achromatopsia|achromatic]] boy who only sees black and white, and the player guides him in 4 various parts of his life. The game contains themes such as [[sexuality]], [[bullying]], [[pedophilia]], [[zoophilia]], [[suicide]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[morality]],
[[feminism]], [[BDSM]] and criticism of aspects of modern society such as [[capitalism]] and [[materialism]].

==Plot==
The game begins with a cutscene of a young Désiré who is asked by his [[kindergarten]] teacher why he hasn't drawn the sun like the other children, he replies that he has never seen the sun, since it "is always night in his head".

The actual game starts on a beach in 1992, where a young Désiré wants to cast a "love spell" to a classmate he has a crush on. The player directs Désiré in all his actions, and can pick up objects, talk to various characters and explore the world.
After successfully burrying a box with an egg, which has the name of Désiré's crush on it, in it, the game continues to the next chapter.

Désiré, who lives in the suburbs of [[Lyon]] with his parents and brother Bruno, is advised by an old man, who is apparently imaginary as other characters imply, to stand up against a boy who bullies him at school, David. Désiré plots to catch David, who has an addiction to [[masturbating]], in the act and distribute pictures of it around the school. After successfully doing this, David and Désiré are both expelled from school.

The next chapter starts in 2003, Désiré, now an adult man living in Paris, is informed that his company is firing him because they are outsourcing part of its operations. Désiré is in love with Elma, who doesn't seem to return the feeling, and he promises her a gig at a restaurant in an attempt to woo her. After successfully doing this, Elma doesn't show up at the day of the gig, and a heartbroken Désiré comes to believe that it is better not to love.

In 2011, Désiré has discarded love and instead visits brothels to satisfy his desires. The chapter begins with a dream or hallucination of Désiré standing before a brothel which appears as a giant woman's genital area. Désiré also visits, Élodie, one of his friends who is in love with her dog Rocco. He decides to visit another friend, Damien and recruits the help of Andy, another friend, to find him after discovering threatening letters from Damien's neighbour. Eventually, it turns out Damien committed [[suicide]], and it is also revealed he was a pedophile, but never actually acted on it. The chapter ends with Désiré talking to a hallucination of an obese man who tries to convince him to stop changing society, however corrupt it might be, and just accept everything.

The final chapter starts in 2020. Désiré has been living a village in Congo for 2 years, but wants to return to France and find the manuscript which an old sailor give him when he was a child. His parents gave the manuscript to a charity, and Désiré returns to [[Lyon]] in search of it. A clue in a secondhand shop gives him a lead, but the shop salesman, who is revealed to be David, confronts Désiré, who is forced to beat up the former. Désiré tracks down the manuscript to a small village. He finds a young girl, Léa, alone on the streets and reveals her grandfather is Martin Lacour, an antique collector who currently owns the manuscript. Désiré accompanies Léa back home, and Lacour reluctantly allows Désiré to read the manuscript. After realizing it is the real one, he steals it from Lacour's safe and reads it in the local church. Désiré is now able to see colors, and is ecstatic, but can't bring himself to steal it and decides to return it to Léa, who thanks him. The chapters ends with Désiré hallucinating an apparition of [[Jesus]], who claims Désiré is afraid of change and gave the manuscript away for that reason.

The game ends with Désiré finally accepting the world as it ends, yet feeling condemned to live while pursuing his path.

==Reception==
Reception to the game on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] was mixed.&lt;ref name="desire1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216015139/http://store.steampowered.com/app/399700|title=The Steam page of the game on the Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later removed from the Steam Store because the author had created multiple accounts to improve the game's rating. The French gaming website Joypad gave it a positive review.&lt;ref name="desire2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joypad.fr/test-desire-point-click-pour-joueurs-avertis/|title=DÉSIRÉ – POINT &amp; CLICK POUR JOUEURS AVERTIS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was notable enough to receive coverage on a TV report of [[La Une]].&lt;ref name="desire3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7QAL6Y2nHU|title=La Une TV report on Désiré}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game won Best Mobile Game and Best Game Audio at the Tel Aviv Indie Game Awards 2016,&lt;ref name="desire4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indieprize.org/kyiv2017/#telaviv2016-winners|title=Indie Showcase}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Best Game Narrative in the Asia Indie Game Awards 2016. It also won Best Game Audio in the Évry Games City Awards 2016.

'''''EU Jacksonville''''' is a monthly entertainment magazine published in [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. It contains feature reporting and entertainment and cultural guides for Jacksonville and the [[Northeast Florida]] region.

==History==
The publication was founded as the ''Southeast Entertainer'' in 1976 by Jacksonville businessman and musician Tony Trotti. Originally an occasional publication, Trotti made it a [[Weekly newspaper|weekly]] in the 1980s and changed the name to ''First Coast Entertainer'', leaving his job as vice president of George Washington Life Insurance to work on the paper. In addition to covering Jacksonville's entertainment scene, the paper had a promotion arrangement with film companies to give out free movie tickets to readers.&lt;ref name=Kerr&gt;{{cite news |title= First Coast Entertainer owner dies at 59 |author= Jessie-Lynne Kerr|url= http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/031803/met_12032471.shtml |newspaper= [[The Florida Times-Union]] |date= March 18, 2003 |accessdate=July 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.metrojacksonville.com/article/2012-jul-a-brief-history-of-jacksonville-music-news4jax |title= A Brief History of Jacksonville Music |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= July 7, 2012 |website= [[metrojacksonville.com]] |publisher= |accessdate=July 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Henley&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.eujacksonville.com/urbanjax.htm |title= EU talks with Urban Jacksonville Blog |author= Rachel Best Henley |date= 2007 |website= eujacksonville.com| publisher= EU Jacksonville |accessdate=July 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trotti died in 2003, and the ''Entertainer'' briefly stopped publication. Associate publisher Will Henley started a similar weekly called ''Entertaining U'' or ''EU Jacksonville'', and then bought and absorbed the ''Entertainer'', retaining most of its staff. ''EU'' underwent several format shifts and redesigns during the 2000s.&lt;ref name=Kerr/&gt;&lt;ref name=Henley/&gt; In March 2008 it shifted to its present monthly tabloid format with expanded web offerings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.eujacksonville.com/pages/03-08/index.html |title= A letter from eu |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= March 2008 |website= eujacksonville.com |publisher= |accessdate=July 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper includes feature stories as well as reviews of films, music, entertainment and nightlife in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Insiders' Guide to Jacksonville, 3rd Edition|last= Reiss|first= Sarah W. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2009 |publisher= Globe Pequot |location= |isbn= 0-7627-5032-4|page= 218 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=rlHWoqDYZHkC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=%22Entertaining+U%22+jacksonville.com&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Npf1UazdNK-y4APU3YDwAw&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Entertaining%20U%22%20jacksonville.com&amp;f=false|accessdate= July 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This game can be played about people of all ages. You need at least 5 players for this game to work. The aim of the game is to be the player who stays in the game the longest..

* To start the game, first choose a player to be the leader.
* Players think of a 'key word'. It can be any word or a name. For example, 'cheese'.
* All players lie on their backs.
* The leader shouts out "Fire on the mountain!" All the players respond with "Fire!" but stay lying down. Then the leader shouts out "Fire on the river!" Again the players reply with "Fire" but do not jump up. This continues on with the leader changing the last word of the phrase. He tries to think of as many different places for the fire.
* The leader is able to shout out the key word at any time, as part of the phrases or in between them. When he shouts it out the players must all jump up. The last one to jump up is out of the game.
* The winner is the player who stays in the game the longest.

'''For Your Consideration''' is a heading frequently used in [[advertisement]]s in [[entertainment]] [[entertainment industry|trade]] publications such as ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]], [[Backstage (magazine)|Backstage]],'' and ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''.

[[File:Wheel of Fortune Navy.jpg|thumb|[[U.S. military]] servicemen participate in television game show ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' with [[game show host|host]] [[Pat Sajak]].]]
A '''game show''' is a type of radio, television, or stage show in which contestants, individually or as teams, play a [[game]] which involves answering questions or solving puzzles, usually for money or prizes. Alternatively, a ''gameshow'' can be a demonstrative program about a game [while usually retaining the spirit of an awards ceremony]. In the former, contestants may be invited from a pool of public applicants. Game shows often reward players with prizes such as cash, trips and [[goods and services]] provided by the show's [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]] prize suppliers.

== History ==
[[File:Game Show.jpg|thumb|Game show]]

===1930s–1950s===
Game shows began to appear on radio and television in the late 1930s. The very first television game show, ''[[Spelling Bee (game show)|Spelling Bee]]'', as well as the first radio game show, ''[[Information Please]]'', were both broadcast in 1938; the first major success in the game show genre was ''[[Dr. I.Q.]]'', a radio quiz show that began in 1939. ''[[Truth or Consequences]]'' was the first game show to air on commercially licensed television; the ''[[CBS Television Quiz]]'' followed shortly thereafter.  Its first episode  aired in 1941 as an experimental broadcast. Over the course of the 1950s, as television began to pervade the popular culture, game shows quickly became a fixture. Daytime game shows would be played for lower stakes to target stay-at-home housewives.  Higher-stakes programs would air in [[primetime]]. During the late 1950s, high-stakes games such as ''[[Twenty-One (game show)|Twenty-One]]'' and ''[[The $64,000 Question]]''  began a rapid rise in popularity.  However, the rise of quiz shows proved to be short-lived.  In 1959, many of the higher stakes game shows were [[quiz show scandals|discovered to be rigged]] and ratings declines led to most of the primetime games being canceled.

An early variant of the game show, the [[panel game]], survived the quiz show scandals. On shows like ''[[What's My Line?]]'', ''[[I've Got A Secret]]'', and ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'', panels of celebrities would interview a guest in an effort to determine some fact about them; in others, celebrities would answer questions. Panel games had success in primetime until the late 1960s, when they were collectively dropped from television because of their perceived low budget nature. Panel games made a comeback in American daytime television (where the lower budgets were tolerated) in the 1970s through comedy-driven shows such as ''[[Match Game]]'' and ''[[Hollywood Squares]]''. In the UK, commercial demographic pressures were not as prominent, and restrictions on game shows made in the wake of the scandals limited the style of games that could be played and the amount of money that could be awarded. Panel shows there were kept in primetime and have continued to thrive; they have transformed into showcases for the nation's top stand-up comedians on shows such as ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'', ''[[Would I Lie to You? (TV series)|Would I Lie to You?]]'', ''[[Mock the Week]]'', ''[[QI]]'', and ''[[8 Out of 10 Cats]]'', all of which put a heavy emphasis on comedy, leaving the points as mere formalities. The focus on quick-witted comedians has resulted in strong ratings, which, combined with low costs of production, have only spurred growth in the UK panel show phenomenon.

===1960s–1970s===
Game shows remained a fixture of US daytime television through the 1960s after the quiz show scandals. Lower-stakes games made a slight comeback in daytime in the early 1960s; examples include ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' which began in 1964 and the original version of ''The Match Game'' first aired in 1962.  ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]''  began in 1963 and the 1960s also marked the debut of ''Hollywood Squares'', ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]'', ''[[The Dating Game]]'', and ''[[The Newlywed Game]]''.

Though [[CBS]] gave up on daytime game shows in 1968, the other networks did not follow suit. [[Color television]] was introduced to the game show genre in the late 1960s on all three networks. The 1970s saw a renaissance of the game show as new games and massive upgrades to existing games made debuts on the major networks. ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The New Price Is Right]]'', an update of the 1950s-era game show ''[[The Price Is Right (1956 U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'', debuted in 1972 and marked CBS's return to the game show format in its [[rural purge|effort to draw wealthier, suburban viewers]]. ''The Match Game'' became "Big Money" ''[[Match Game]] 73'', which proved popular enough to prompt a spin-off, ''[[Family Feud]]'', on ABC in 1976. ''[[Pyramid (game show)|The $10,000 Pyramid]]'' and its numerous higher-stakes derivatives also debuted in 1973, while the 1970s also saw the return of formerly disgraced producer and [[game show host|host]] [[Jack Barry (television personality)|Jack Barry]], who debuted ''[[The Joker's Wild]]'' and a clean version of the previously rigged ''[[Tic-Tac-Dough]]'' in the 1970s. ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' debuted on NBC in 1975. The [[Prime Time Access Rule]], which took effect in 1971, barred networks from broadcasting in the 7-8 p.m. time slot immediately preceding [[prime time]], opening up time slots for [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programming. Most of the syndicated programs were "nighttime" adaptations of network daytime game shows. These game shows originally aired once a week, but by the late 1970s and early 1980s most of the games had transitioned to five days a week.

===1980s–1990s===
Game shows were the lowest priority of television networks and were rotated out every thirteen weeks if unsuccessful. Most tapes were [[wiping#Game shows|destroyed]] until the early 1980s. Over the course of the late 1980s and early 1990s, as fewer new hits were produced, game shows lost their permanent place in the daytime lineup. ABC transitioned out of the daytime game show format in the mid-1980s (briefly returning to the format for one season in 1990 with a ''Match Game'' revival). NBC's game block also lasted until 1991, but the network attempted to bring them back in 1993 before cancelling its game show block again in 1994. CBS phased out most of its game shows, except for ''The Price Is Right'', by 1993. To the benefit of the genre, the moves of ''Wheel of Fortune'' and a modernized revival of ''Jeopardy!'' to [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] in 1983 and 1984, respectively, was and remains highly successful; the two are, to this day, fixtures in the prime time "access period".

[[Cable television]] also allowed for the debut of game shows such as ''[[Supermarket Sweep]]'' (Lifetime), ''[[Trivial Pursuit (US game show)|Trivial Pursuit]]'' and ''[[Family Challenge]]'' (Family Channel), and ''[[Double Dare (1986 game show)|Double Dare]]'' (Nickelodeon). It also opened up a previously underdeveloped market for game show reruns. General interest networks such as [[Television networks preceding ABC Family|CBN Cable Network]] and [[USA Network]] had popular blocks for game show reruns from the mid-1980s to the mid-'90s before that [[niche market|niche]] was overtaken by [[Game Show Network]] in 1994.

After the popularity of game shows hit a nadir in the mid-1990s United States (at which point ''The Price Is Right'' was the only game show still on daytime network TV), the British game show ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' began distribution across the globe. Upon the show's American debut in 1999, it was a hit and became a regular part of ABC's prime time lineup until 2002. Several shorter-lived high-stakes games were attempted around the time of the [[millennium]], both in the United States and the United Kingdom, such as ''[[Winning Lines]]'', ''[[The Chair (game show)|The Chair]]'', ''[[Greed (game show)|Greed]]'', and ''[[Shafted]]'', leading to some dubbing this period as "The Million-Dollar Game Show Craze". These higher stakes contests also opened the door to [[reality television]] contests such as ''[[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]'' and ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'', in which contestants win large sums of money for outlasting their peers in a given environment. Several game shows returned to daytime in syndication during this time as well, such as ''Family Feud'', ''Hollywood Squares'', and ''Millionaire''.

The popularity of game shows in the United States was closely paralleled around the world. [[Reg Grundy Organisation]], for instance, would buy the international rights for American game shows and reproduce them in other countries, especially in Grundy's native [[Australia]]. In the [[United Kingdom]], game shows have had a more steady and permanent place in the television lineup and never lost popularity in the 1990s as they did in the United States, due in part to the fact that game shows were highly regulated by the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] in the 1980s and that those restrictions were lifted in the 1990s, allowing for higher-stakes games to be played. Game shows have had an inconsistent place in [[Television in Canada|Canadian television]], with most homegrown game shows there being made for the French-speaking [[Quebec]]ois market and the majority of English-language game shows in the country being rebroadcast from, or made with the express intent of export to, the United States. There have been exceptions to this (see, for instance, the long-running ''[[Definition (TV series)|Definition]]''). Unlike [[reality television]] franchises, international game show franchises generally only see Canadian adaptations in a series of specials, based heavily on the American versions but usually with a Canadian host to allow for [[Canadian content]] credits. The smaller markets and lower revenue opportunities for Canadian shows in general also affect game shows there, with Canadian games (especially Quebecois ones) often having very low budgets for prizes, unless the series is made for export. Canadian contestants are generally allowed to participate on American game shows, and there have been at least three Canadian game show hosts – [[Monty Hall]], [[Jim Perry (television personality)|Jim Perry]], and [[Alex Trebek]] – who have gone on to long careers hosting American series.

===2000s and 2010s===
In the U.S., CBS is currently the only major network airing daily national game shows. It still airs ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' and, as of 2009, is also airing a revival of ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]''. ''Deal'' airs on weekdays at a time chosen by each CBS affiliate, while ''Price'' airs weekdays at 10 am or 11 am in most markets.  In addition, ABC's syndication wing [[Disney-ABC Domestic Television]] distributes ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'', and many of their local affiliates air it in syndication. The oldest, continually aired radio quiz show in the United States was ''Simply Trivia'', which aired on public radio station [[WYSO]] in [[Yellow Springs, Ohio]]. It ran from 1972 through 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wyso.org/programs/simply-trivia|title=Programs A-Z|work=wyso.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of digital television in the United States opened up a large market for rerun programs. [[Buzzr]] was established by [[FremantleMedia North America]], owners of numerous classic U.S. game shows, as a broadcast outlet for its archived holdings in June 2015. There has also been a rise of live game shows at festivals and public venues, where the general audience can participate in the show, such as the science-inspired [http://www.philasciencefestival.org/event/269-geek-out-game-show ''Geek Out Game Show''] or the [http://www.yuckshow.com/ ''Yuck Show''].

A boom in [[prime time]] revivals of classic daytime game shows began to emerge in the mid-2010s. In 2016, ABC packaged the existing  ''[[Celebrity Family Feud]]'', which had returned in 2015, with new versions of ''[[To Tell the Truth]],'' ''[[Pyramid (game show)|The $100,000 Pyramid]]'', and ''[[Match Game]]'' in 2016. [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]], in turn, launched a [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]-themed revival of ''[[The Joker's Wild]]'', hosted by [[Snoop Dogg]], in October 2017. This is in addition to a number of original game concepts that appeared near the same time, including ''[[The Million Second Quiz]]'', ''[[Hollywood Game Night]]'', ''[[1 vs. 100]]'', and ''[[The Wall (game show)|The Wall]]'', and a string of music-themed games such as ''[[Don't Forget the Lyrics!]]'', ''[[The Singing Bee (U.S. game show)|The Singing Bee]]'', and ''[[Beat Shazam]]''.

==Prizes==
Many of the prizes awarded on game shows are provided through [[product placement]], but in some cases they are provided by private organizations or purchased at either the full price or at a discount by the show. There is the widespread use of "promotional consideration", in which a game show receives a subsidy from an advertiser in return for awarding that manufacturer's product as a prize or [[consolation prize]]. Some products supplied by manufacturers may not be intended to be awarded at all and are instead just used as part of the gameplay (such as the low-priced items used in several [[List of The Price Is Right pricing games|pricing games]] of ''[[The Price Is Right]]'').

For high-stakes games, a network may purchase [[prize indemnity insurance]] to avoid paying the cost of a rare but expensive prize out of pocket. If the said prize is won too often, the insurance company may refuse to insure a show. (This was a factor in the discontinuation of ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular]]'' series of prime-time specials.) In 2008, three of the contestants on ''The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular'' won the top prize in a five-episode span after fifteen episodes without a winner, due in large part to a change in the rules. The insurance companies had made it extremely difficult to get further insurance for the remaining episodes. A network or syndicator may also opt to distribute large cash prizes in the form of an [[annuity (finance theory)|annuity]], spreading the cost of the prize out over several years or decades.

From about 1960 through the rest of the 20th century, American networks placed restrictions on the amount of money that could be given away on a game show, in an effort to avoid a repeat of the scandals of the 1950s. This usually took the form of an earnings cap that forced a player to retire once they had won a certain amount of money or a limit on how many episodes, usually five, on which a player could appear on a show. The introduction of [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] games, particularly in the 1980s, eventually allowed for more valuable prizes and extended runs on a particular show. British television was under even stricter regulations on prizes until the 1990s, seriously restricting the value of prizes that could be given and disallowing games of chance to have an influence on the results of the game. (Thus, the British version of ''[[The Price Is Right (UK game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' at first did not include the American version's "Showcase Showdown", in which contestants spun a large wheel to determine who would advance to the Showcase bonus round.) In Canada, prizes were limited not by bureaucracy but necessity, as the much smaller population limited the audience of shows marketed toward that country. The lifting of these restrictions in the 1990s was a major factor in the explosion of high-stakes game shows in the later part of that decade in both the U.S. and Britain and, subsequently, around the world.

==Bonus round==
A bonus round (also known as a bonus game or an end game) usually follows a main game as a bonus to the winner of that game. In the bonus round, the stakes are higher and the game is considered to be tougher.&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;Graham, Jefferson, "Come On Down!!! The TV Game Show Book," Abbeville Press Publishers, New York, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

The game play of a bonus round usually varies from the standard game play of the front game, and there are often borrowed or related elements of the main game in the bonus round to ensure the entire show has a unified premise. Though some end games are referred to as "bonus rounds", many are not specifically referred to as such in games but fit the same general role.

There is no one formula for the format of a bonus round. There are differences in almost every bonus round, though there are many recurring elements from show to show. The bonus round is often played for the show's top prize.

Until the 1960s, most game shows did not offer a bonus round. In traditional two-player formats, the winner — if a game show's rules provided for this — became the champion and simply played a new challenger either on the next show or after the commercial break.&lt;ref name="Graham"/&gt;

One of the earliest forms of bonus rounds was the Jackpot Round of the original series ''[[Beat the Clock]]''. After two rounds of performing stunts, the wife of the contestant couple would perform at a jackpot board for a prize. The contestant was shown a famous quotation or common phrase, and the words were scrambled. To win the announced bonus, the contestant had to unscramble the words within 20 seconds. The contestant received a consolation gift worth over $200 if she was unsuccessful.

Another early bonus round ended each episode of ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'' with the team who won the most money answering one final question for a jackpot which started at $1,000 and increased $500 each week until won.

Another early example was the Lightning Round on the word game ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]'', starting in 1961. The contestant who won the front game played a quick-fire series of passwords within 60 seconds, netting $50 per correctly guessed word, for a maximum bonus prize of $250.&lt;ref name="Graham"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, David, Steve Ryan and Fred Westbock. "The Encyclopedia of TV Game Shows: 3rd Edition", Checkmark Books, Facts on File Inc., 1999, pg. xviii. {{ISBN|0-8160-3847-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bonus round came about after game show producer [[Mark Goodson]] was first presented ''Password'', contending that it was not enough to merely guess passwords during the show. "We needed something more, and that's how the Lightning Round was invited," said [[Howard Felsher]], who produced ''Password'' and ''[[Family Feud]]''. "From that point on every game show had to have an end round. You'd bring a show to a network and they'd say, 'What's the endgame?' as if they had thought of it themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

The end game of ''[[Match Game]]'', hosted for most of its run by [[Gene Rayburn]], served as the impetus for a completely new game show. The first part of ''Match Game''{{'}}s "Super-Match" bonus round, called the "Audience Match", asked contestants to guess how a studio audience responded to a question. In 1975, with then regular panelist [[Richard Dawson]] becoming restless and progressively less cooperative, Goodson decided that this line of questioning would make a good game show of its own, and the concept eventually became ''[[Family Feud]]'', as whose inaugural host Dawson was hired.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Greg Day''' (born 1957) is a playwright who created several radio and stage plays between 1983 and the present day. His 1983 play ''The Arrangement'' was described as "the most disturbing bedsitcom since Polanski's ''The Tenant''" by ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Time Out, 18 February 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stage plays==
Day's first play, ''The Rocking Chair'', was performed at the [[Fountains Abbey]] pub theatre in Paddington, and directed by Murray Shelmerdine. The two-hander revolves around Gary, a reclusive would-be writer, whose peace of mind is rudely interrupted by a new neighbour, who starts off making unwelcome advances. When he tries to borrow Gary's rocking chair in which to commit suicide, the play develops into a two-edged study of selfishness.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Cushman, The Observer, 16 June 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, adapted for radio, it aired on BBC Radio Four's ''Thirty Minute Theatre'' in 1983, directed by David Johnston and featuring John Rye and Richard Huw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davalle.|first=Peter|title=Television and radio programmes|newspaper=The Times|date=21 May 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dear, Peter, ''The Times'', 24 May 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

Day's 1984 play ''Tenderhooks'' follows the lives of three flatmates fixated on the same woman, and explored the "surrealism of unprivate lives".&lt;ref&gt;Hampstead &amp; Highgate Express, 10 August 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; Although never produced as a stand-alone play, ''Tenderhooks'' was later staged as part of ''Changing Rooms'' at the [[Odyssey Theatre]], an umbrella title for three of Day's plays - ''The Rocking Chair'', ''Tenderhooks'' and ''The Arrangement'', each one examining games of sex and power in "[[bedsit]] land".&lt;ref&gt;City Limits 14 August 1984&lt;/ref&gt; The plays were directed by David Robson.

The 1984 production ''Behind The Clouds'' explored the "cloudy" personal life of [[Socrates]], ending with his trial for seducing young men, in particular [[Alcibiades]]. The play explored the power struggles and intrigues of ancient Athens.&lt;ref&gt;What's On In London, 14 November 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

Day's 1986 play ''Bust'' is on the subject of the gender gap, and traces a young man's journey into womanhood - a situation which places him on the front line in 'the battle of the sexes'.&lt;ref&gt;The Observer (magazine), 9 November 1986&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 it was performed in German as ''Titten'' at the Theater Chambinzky in Wurzberg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chambinzky.com/theater/chronik Theater Chambinzky archive]&lt;/ref&gt; After being rewritten and retitled as ''Stripped'' the play was performed at London's [[Riverside Studios]] in 1998,&lt;ref name=Doollee&gt;{{cite web|title=Plays by Gregory Day|url=http://www.doollee.com/PlaywrightsD/day-gregory.html|work=Doollee|accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  centring on Leslie and Zoe, an American couple visiting London. After a row that leads to them splitting up, Leslie starts to realise that everyone believes him to be a woman. What follows is a struggle for sexual identity and the forming of new kinds of relationships. [[Kevin Day]] described it as a "genuinely black comedy"&lt;ref&gt;Comedian Kevin Day, Evening Standard, 21 October 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Daily Mail]] called it a "genuine fringe find".&lt;ref&gt;The Daily Mail, 10 October 1998&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bust'' and ''Stripped'' were both directed by Tony Craven.&lt;ref&gt;Craven, Tony, ''Crashing Through Constellations'', Douglas Foote Publishing, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additional songs and score changes===
During the recording process and development of the show, many lyrics were switched around, parts added and/or cut, as the play was finalized after this soundtrack was recorded. Some songs in the stage show now differ from their respective recordings on the cast recording, including "(The Legend of) Miss Baltimore Crabs" and "Cooties".

For the cast recording of the show, some songs that were present in the stage show were not included on the recording. "The Madison", one of these numbers, occurs after "(The Legend of) Miss Baltimore Crabs" and is sung by Corny and Company. The song, however, was included on the [[Hairspray (2007 soundtrack)|2-Disc Collector's Soundtrack]] titled "Boink-Boink". Another such song, "The Nicest Kids in Town (Reprise)", sung by Corny and Council Members, appears in the show before "It Takes Two". An additional song not included on the album is "Velma's Revenge", sung by Velma after "It Takes Two", which serves as a short reprise of "(The Legend of) Miss Baltimore Crabs".

'''''High Road to China''''' (a.k.a. '''''Raiders of the End of the World''''') is a 1983 American [[adventure film|adventure]]-[[romance film]] set in the 1920s starring [[Tom Selleck]] in his first major starring role, playing a hard-drinking [[biplane]] pilot hired by society heiress Eve "Evie" Tozer ([[Bess Armstrong]]) to find her missing father ([[Wilford Brimley]]). The supporting cast includes [[Robert Morley]] and [[Brian Blessed]]. The [[Orange Sky Golden Harvest|Golden Harvest]] film (released by [[Warner Bros.]]) is loosely based on a [[High Road to China (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Jon Cleary]].  However, little beyond character names and the basic premise of an aerial race to China survived the translation to film.

While [[Brian G. Hutton]] ended up as the final director, originally, ''High Road to China'' was helmed by [[John Huston]], before being replaced by [[Sidney J. Furie]]. The musical score was composed by [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]]. It was the 27th highest-grossing film of 1983, bringing in $28,445,927 at the domestic [[box office]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies.go.com/boxoffice?cat=1983 "1983 Box office results: ''High Road to China''{{-"}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113050955/http://movies.go.com/boxoffice?cat=1983 |date=2006-11-13 }}.

==Plot==
Eve Tozer ([[Bess Armstrong]]) is a society heiress and [[flapper]] living the high-life in 1920s [[Istanbul]]. She needs to find her father, Bradley Tozer ([[Wilford Brimley]]), before he is officially declared dead or risk losing her inheritance to his scheming business partner, Bentik ([[Robert Morley]]). She only has 12 days. Eve hires [[World War I]] [[Flying ace|ace]] pilot Patrick O'Malley ([[Tom Selleck]]) and his aircraft. O'Malley is eager to take the job as he needs to leave town rather urgently himself.  Eve, also an accomplished pilot, however, is determined to accompany him in his other aircraft, which causes the first of many arguments on the way from Istanbul and China.

Their journey in two biplanes (named [[Dorothy Gish|"Dorothy"]] and [[Lillian Gish|"Lillian"]] after the famous Gish silent film star sisters&lt;ref name="Santoir"&gt;Santoir, Christian. [http://www.aeromovies.fr/articles.php?lng=en&amp;pg=294 "Review: Raiders of the End of the World."] '' Aeromovies'', October 18, 2010. Retrieved: December 4, 2015. (In French.)&lt;/ref&gt;) through six countries leads them to finally find the eccentric Bradley Tozer in China, where he is helping a small village defend itself against a local warlord. O'Malley and Eve help them win the final battle, but their one remaining aircraft is damaged in the process, leaving her seemingly unable to meet her deadline.

==Production==
''High Road to China'' is regarded as one of the better 'imitators' that populated movie theaters in the years following ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' however, as in the case of [[Romancing the Stone]], another so-called 'imitator', the source material actually predated the aforementioned Lucasfilm production by four years.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Road_to_China_(novel)&lt;/ref&gt; Rumor has it that it was "given" to Selleck as a sort of consolation prize for having to pass on ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' due to scheduling conflicts with ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]''&lt;ref&gt;Bricken, Rob. [http://io9.com/tom-selleck-reveals-the-truth-about-him-and-indiana-jon-1537704359 "Tom Selleck sets the record straight about him and Indiana Jones."] io9.com, March 6, 2014. Retrieved: December 4, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early development, the film was slated to star [[Roger Moore]] and [[Jacqueline Bisset]] under the direction of [[John Huston]].&lt;ref&gt;Warga, Wayne. "Author! Author!: Upwardly Prolific Down Under". ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', July 4, 1980, p. e2.&lt;/ref&gt; Then Huston and Bissett dropped out and [[Bo Derek]] was to co star with Moore. The budget was to be $16 million. Then Derek dropped out because she only wanted to be directed by her husband.&lt;ref&gt;AT THE MOVIES; THE MAN BEHIND ''BAD TIMING''; The man behind 'Bad Timing.' New York Times19 Sep 1980: C.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Filming for ''High Road to China'' took place in Yugoslavia with a crew of 231 (145 Yugoslavs, 60 British, 15 Italians, 10 Americans, and one Frenchman).  They also added 50 Yugoslav actors to the speaking cast and hired 4,000 extras. Headquarters for the film company was in the small Adriatic coastal town of [[Opatija]], [[Croatia]], located on the northwest coast of the Gulf of Rijeka at the foot of [[Učka|Mt. Ucka]]. It was filmed in Opatija and [[Istria]], Croatia. Scenes set in Afghanistan were shot at Kamenjak near [[Rijeka]], while scenes set in Turkey were filmed at [[Volosko]], and the final battle in China was shot in [[Boljun]].

Originally, [[Bristol F.2 Fighter|Bristol F2B]] replicas were built by Vernon Ohmert of Ypsilanti, Michigan. This aircraft type was in the novel, but after construction, the  replicas were thought to be dangerous to fly at high altitude and were replaced by two [[Stampe et Vertongen|Stampe SV-4]] biplanes, (G-AZGC and G-AZGE), provided by Bianchi Aviation Film Services.

==Reception==
''High Road to China'' was the only new wide release on the March 18–20 weekend, and debuted atop the box office with $6,156,049.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?view=&amp;yr=1983&amp;wknd=11&amp;p=.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It eventually grossed over $28 million domestically.&lt;ref&gt;Champlin, Charles. "Selleck: A runaway male sex symbol." ''Los Angeles Times'', December 7, 1984, p. l1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom Selleck later recalled:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Patrick O'Malley I'm very fond of ... There were actors at that point who had left a series and started a feature career, but there was no one at that point who was trying to do both at the same time. So that was unique. It also made the jury rather tough, because a lot of people didn't see it that way, so I was walking into an arena where that wasn't accepted. But it's a good movie. It holds up.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Will. [http://www.avclub.com/article/tom-selleck-jesse-stone-friends-and-fighting-magnu-226560 "Tom Selleck on Jesse Stone, Friends, and fighting for Magnum, P.I."]  ''avclub.com'', October 14, 2015. Retrieved: December 4, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Aerofiles'', a historical aviation website, considered the film as "Strictly mediocre, with substandard action scenes and the flattest dialogue this side of the Great Wall."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aerofiles.com/film-h.html "Review: 'High Road to China'."] ''Aerofiles''. Retrieved: December 4, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Aviation film historian Christian Santoir described the film thusly: "Arriving two years after 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', 'Raiders of the End of the World' was in the same vein, despite certain missing qualities. This, however, could have been the start of another 'Indiana Jones'–type franchise."&lt;ref name="Santoir"/&gt; Film historian Stephen Pendo found ''High Road to China'' "... notable mainly for its aviation sequences, for it lacks character and plot development."&lt;ref&gt;Pendo 1985, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honors===
''High Road to China'' was nominated for the 1984 Saturn Award as Best Fantasy Film, while Bess Armstrong was nominated as Best Actress at the [[Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films]] Festival.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085678/awards?ref_=tt_awd "Awards: 'High Road to China' (1983)."] ''IMDb''.

An '''inclusion rider''' or '''equity rider''' is a provision in a actor's or [[filmmaker]]'s contract that provides for a certain level of [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]] in casting and production staff. For example, the rider might require a certain proportion of actors or staff to be women, [[people of color]], [[LGBT]] people or people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/05/what-is-an-inclusion-rider-frances-mcdormand-oscars-2018|title=Woman behind 'inclusion rider' explains Frances McDormand's Oscar speech|last=Belam|first=Martin|last2=Levin|first2=Sam|date=5 March 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent actors or filmmakers may use their negotiating power to insist on such provisions. The term is derived from the "[[Rider (theater)|rider]]", a provision in the contract of performing actors to ensure certain aspects of a performance such as personal amenities or technical infrastructure.

This list details [[Australian]] people working in the [[film industry]] who have been nominated for, or won, [[Academy Award]]s (also known as Oscars). These awards honour outstanding achievements in theatrically released motion pictures and were first presented by the [[United States]] [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (AMPAS) in 1929. {{as of|2016}}, a total of 43 awards from 154 nominations have been won by Australians. Additionally, awards for Scientific and Engineering achievements have been given to Australians four times.

[[Cate Blanchett]] is the most nominated individual in this list with seven nominations, which resulted in a win for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Leading Actress]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]]. [[Peter Weir]] has received five nominations in the [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay)|Best Original Screenplay]] categories without a win.

In [[15th Academy Awards|1942]], [[Ken G. Hall]] became the first Australian to win an Academy Award for his documentary ''[[Kokoda Front Line!]]'' in the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Best Documentary]] category. [[Suzanne Baker]] was the first Australian woman to win an Oscar, which was given to her in [[49th Academy Awards|1977]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short]] for ''Leisure''.

'''Mango TV''' (芒果TV, ''Mángguǒ TV'') is a Chinese Internet enterprise operated by [http://mgtv.com mgtv.com] Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us_mgtv.com|url=http://corp.mgtv.com/en/about/#1st|website=mgtv.com|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mango TV was established on May 26, 2006 in [[Changsha]], [[Hunan Province|Hunan]] and later decided to use 'Mango TV(Internet TV, PC, Phone and Pad)' as its video platform branding title in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=公司信息_湖南快乐阳光互动娱乐传媒有限公司(About Us_mgtv)|url=http://corp.mgtv.com/about/#1st|website=Mango TV|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mango TV specializes in creating online videos and is an online platform providing all of the content that is presented in TV channels, and all other copyright works from [[Hunan Broadcasting System]] and [[Hunan Television|Hunan Satellite TV]]. Its current headquarter is located in Golden Eagle Movie&amp;TV Cultural City, Changsha, Hunan, China. Mango TV provides audience with all kinds of content including [[films]], [[TV series]], [[music]], [[cartoons]] and [[entertainment]].

On April 31, 2016, Mango TV was reported to have 39 million [[daily active users]] on its website, with the content from Hunan Satellite TV only accounting for 38% in all that Mango TV has produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wang|first1=Xiaoyi|title=芒果TV：出资超一亿 做内容孵化平台_网易财经|url=http://money.163.com/16/0505/18/BMAQ5L6N00253B0H.html|accessdate=22 October 2016|publisher=21jingji.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 9, 2018, the license which Hunan Broadcasting System got to broadcast the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] was taken away after it was revealed that Mango TV, which broadcast Eurovision 2018 for Chinese audiences, censored the Albanian and Irish performances, along with censoring any [[Rainbow flag (LGBT movement)|rainbow flags]] which were seen in the audience.

== History  ==

Mango TV was established on May 26, 2006, in Changsha, Hunan by Ruobo Zhang, the former Mango TV Chairman&amp;CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=芒果TV_创业公司_新芽(Mango TV_startup_newseed)|url=http://newseed.pedaily.cn/company/37559|website=newseed|accessdate=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=张若波  湖南快乐阳光互动娱乐传媒有限公司CEO_经济频道_央视网(cctv.com)|url=http://jingji.cntv.cn/2014/05/14/ARTI1400048903474143.shtml|accessdate=22 October 2016|work=jingji.cntv.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 20, 2014, the original Mango TV and Golden Eagle website were integrated into a single online video platform which exclusively holds all of Hunan Broadcasting System and Hunan Satellite TV's content and enjoys their copyright works, also known as "Mango Exclusive Broadcast".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cao|first1=Jie|title=芒果TV的独播战略(Mango Exclusive Broadcast)_|journal=Baidu Wenku|url=http://wenku.baidu.com/view/7ad1dea8783e0912a3162ac1.html?from=search|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014, Mango TV created the first self-produced [[web series]] 'Huayang Jianghu'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zhang|first1=Chun|title=芒果TV打造马栏山出品 自制剧《花样江湖》(Mango TV produced the first network drama 'Huayang Jianghu)|url=http://ent.news.cn/2014-08/07/c_126843542.htm|publisher=Xinhua Net|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2014 New Year Countdown Night, held by Hunan Satellite TV, Mango TV launched '''five-screen''' live broadcast mode, allowing audience to select different camera positions and angles to watch the celebration show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zhang|first1=Zhen|title=芒果TV创新网台互动模式 多屏全景直播小年夜春晚|url=http://news.sina.com.cn/o/2015-02-12/170831514361.shtml|accessdate=22 October 2016|publisher=Rednet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Mango TV has experienced a shift from 'Exclusive Broadcast' to 'Unique Content',{{explain|date=December 2016}} during which period the number of users has increased to 60 million on the platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=Lei|title=丁诚+芒果tv 除了独播，还有什么？|journal=Economic Weekly|url=http://finance.sina.com.cn/2015-12-24/doc-ifxmxxsp6860249.shtml|accessdate=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, Mango TV built collaboration and signed a memorandum with BBC World, seeking for more opportunities on co-production in the global market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC Worldwide, China's Mango TV to Explore Co-Productions|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bbc-worldwide-chinas-mango-tv-831283|accessdate=22 October 2016|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
=== Mango TV originals ===
Mango TV originals refers to work or content that are produced by Mango TV itself, compared to a large proportion of content that it exclusively broadcasts from Hunan Satellite TV.
==== Drama ====
In October 2014, Mango TV's first self-produced network drama 'Huayang Jianghu' debuted, which featured ancient Chinese world as well as costumes and starred young idols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=芒果TV首部定制剧《花样江湖》顺利杀青(图)-新华网|url=http://ent.news.cn/2014-08/21/c_126900028.htm|accessdate=22 October 2016|work=ent.news.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2014, Mango TV produced the second drama 'Jinpai Hongniang'. The drama featured fixed cast compared to previous network dramas which preferred to take each episode with different actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=芒果TV电影级标准拍网剧 《金牌红娘》破千万_网易娱乐|url=http://ent.163.com/14/1104/17/AA7MPVAS00031GVS.html|accessdate=22 October 2016|work=ent.163.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==== Network show ====
In 2015, Mango TV produced the first interactive network live show 'Perfect Holiday', featuring normal young participants living in the same house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=芒果TV粉丝经济《完美假期》成网生综艺标杆_厂商动态-中关村在线(Mango TV's fans economy: Perfect Holiday)|url=http://news.zol.com.cn/550/5509826.html|accessdate=22 October 2016|work=news.zol.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The production used multi-positioned cameras which enabled audience to watch the show with different angles of rooms. Later in July 2016, 'Perfect Holiday 2' debuted with more rooms in different themes.

Later in 2015, Mango TV introduced '[[the Million Second Quiz]]' from [[NBC]], hosted by [[Kevin Tsai]].

=== Mango Hi Q ===
Mango Hi Q is a HD IPTV [[set-top box]](STB) which enables users to request TV programs, movies, music and games. 

Users can enjoy all the copyright works of Hunan Satellite TV and Mango TV provided by the box.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=真我个性年轻优选 芒果TV定制款芒果嗨Q H5重磅上市_网易数码|url=http://digi.163.com/16/0913/13/C0RJF0ET001680NS.html|accessdate=22 October 2016|work=digi.163.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, they can use Mobile App [[Wechat]] to search video content and watch it on their television.
== Financing ==
On June 23, 2016, Mango TV has completed series B funding with nearly 1.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=芒果TV宣布完成近15亿元B轮融资|url=http://finance.sina.com.cn/roll/2016-06-23/doc-ifxtmwri4314182.shtml|accessdate=22 October 2016|work=finance.sina.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its estimated value now is 13.5 billion and was planning to [[go public]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=估值近135亿元 芒果TV为何放弃单独上市|url=http://tech.ifeng.com/a/20160906/44447982_0.shtml|accessdate=22 October 2016|work=tech.ifeng.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the plan failed and Mango TV ended up in being included into Happigo Home Shopping Co. Ltd, going public with other six companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=芒果TV独立上市流产背后：湖南卫视综艺节目难再一家独大|url=http://www.techweb.com.cn/finance/2016-09-07/2388026.shtml|accessdate=22 October 2016|work=techweb.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics stated that it would be better for Mango TV to obtain fully controlled operating authority. With Hunan Broadcasting System owning more than 50% shares, it's hard for Mango TV to make decisions all by itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=调令芒果TV借壳上市，湖南广电还要绝对控股多久？_网易财经|url=http://money.163.com/16/0823/10/BV587SK7002580S6.html|accessdate=22 October 2016|work=money.163.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Homophobic controversy ==

In May 2018, during the Eurovision's performance of [[Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2018|Irish singers]], Mango TV allegedly blurred and censored gay love symbols such as a kiss and [[Rainbow flag (LGBT movement)|LGBT flags]], resulting in the Eurovision administration ending contract with the Chinese TV channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Eurovision 2018: Chinese channel barred from airing contest|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-44078305 |work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ringwood Il Medicine show1.JPG|thumb|250px|right|A reenactment of a medicine show in [[Ringwood, Illinois]]]]
'''Medicine shows''' were touring acts (traveling by truck, horse, or wagon teams) that peddled "miracle cure" [[patent medicine]]s and other products between various entertainments. They developed from European [[Charlatan|mountebank]] shows and were common in the United States in the nineteenth century, especially in the [[American Old West|Old West]] (though some continued until [[World War II]]).&lt;ref name="Step Right Up"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McNamara|first1=Brooks|title=Step Right Up|date=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; They usually promoted "miracle [[elixir]]s" (sometimes referred to as [[snake oil]]), which, it was claimed, had the ability to cure disease, smooth wrinkles, remove stains, prolong life or cure any number of common ailments. Most shows had their own patent medicine (these medicines were for the most part unpatented but took the name to sound official). Entertainments often included a [[freak show]], a [[flea circus]], [[musical ensemble|musical act]]s, [[magic (illusion)|magic trick]]s, jokes, or [[storytelling]]. Each show was run by a man posing as a doctor who drew the crowd with a monologue. The entertainers, such as acrobats, musclemen, magicians, dancers, ventriloquists, exotic performers, and [[Exhibition shooting|trick shots]], kept the audience engaged until the salesman sold his medicine.

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2016}}

===Origins===
[[File:Clark Stanley's Snake Oil Liniment.png|thumb|Advertisement for Clark Stanley's [[snake oil|Snake Oil]] [[Liniment]]]]
While showmen pitching miraculous cures have been around since classical times,&lt;ref name="Anderson-1"&gt;{{cite book |last= Anderson |first= Ann |year= 2000 |title= Snake Oil, Hustlers and Hambones: The American Medicine Show |publisher= McFarland |location= Jefferson, NC |page= 1 |isbn= 0786408006}}&lt;/ref&gt; the advent of mixed performance and medicine sales in western culture originated during the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] in Europe after circuses and theatres were banned and performers had only the marketplace or patrons for support.&lt;ref name="Anderson-1"/&gt; [[Charlatan|Mountebank]]s traveled through small towns and large cities, selling miraculous elixirs by offering small street shows and miraculous cures.&lt;ref name="Step Right Up"/&gt; Itinerant [[peddler]]s of dubious medicines appeared in the American colonies before 1772, when legislation prohibiting their activities was enacted. Increasingly elaborate performances were developed to appeal to a largely rural population.

===Nineteenth century===
Over the course of the nineteenth century, traveling mountebanks gave way to more polished medicine shows, which availed themselves of a burgeoning patent medicine industry. At least 1,500 patent medicines were recorded by 1858, affording enterprising drifters a specific product to sell.&lt;ref name=Anderson-1 /&gt; These "medicines" seldom treated the specific symptoms of an illness, instead relying on stimulants or other drugs to produce a pleasurable effect. [[Alcohol]], [[opium]] and [[cocaine]] were typical ingredients, and their addictive qualities provided an additional incentive for consumers to continue buying them, while their supposed medicinal benefit afforded a sufficient excuse. By 1900, the patent medicine industry was an $80 million business. Also contributing to the rise of the medicine show was the expansion of the advertising industry, through which shows were able to procure inexpensive posters, fliers, handbills, and other merchandising to promote their products.&lt;ref name="Step Right Up"/&gt; Other forms of advertising included the use of memorable [[jingle]]s, sensational testimonials, and [[fear mongering#in marketing|scare tactics]].

Medicine shows combined various forms of popular entertainment with sales pitches from a self-proclaimed "doctor" who sold an astounding cure-all medicine or device. Shows played either outdoors from a wagon, platform or tent, or indoors in a theatre or opera hall. Admission was usually free or nominal. Pitchmen would make grandiose claims about their product’s efficacy, sometimes planting testimonials in the audience. The speaker's goal was to create a need, or fear, then offer his unique medicine as the only cure. Alternating entertainment with sales pitches wore down the audience's resistance, until the crowd was saturated with a desire for the product. The show would continue to run as many days as possible, then move on to the next town. A show might remain in a given location between one night and six weeks, depending on how the troupe behaved itself.

Medicine shows often brought entertainment to rural communities that might not have any other sort of performances for years at a time. Whatever the quality of the medical advice, spectators got their money's worth from the free entertainment. Some shows followed circuits covering the entire United States, though most shows focused on the rural midwest and south, where the inhabitants were considered particularly gullible.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

==Hamlin's Wizard Oil Company and Kickapoo Indian Medicine Company==
The two largest, most successful American medicine shows were [[Hamlin’s Wizard Oil Company]], founded in Chicago by John and Lysander Hamlin, and the [[Kickapoo Indian Medicine Company]], founded in 1881 by Charles Bigelow and John Healey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.pantagraph.com/news/local/indian-medicine-shows-once-popular-entertainment/article_3fa0072d-764a-57ef-b6ea-91afd32021d6.html |title=‘Indian’ medicine shows once popular entertainment |newspaper= [[The Pantagraph]] |date= 2016-03-20 |accessdate= 2016-04-11 |last= Kemp |first= Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamlin’s Wizard Oil Company troupes travelled in specially designed wagons, with built-in organs and space for musical performers. Their appeal was clean, moral, musical entertainment for the whole family. Part of their advertising included songsters, or small booklets of song lyrics and Wizard Oil advertising.&lt;ref name="Step Right Up"/&gt; The Kickapoo Indian Medicine Company created traveling shows based around sham Indian presentational ceremonies, such as war dances and marriages. "Representatives" of the Kickapoo tribe translated for the Indians and sold Sagwa, the most famous patent medicine. The company also presented other forms of entertainment, such as vaudeville shows, trained dog acts, dances, and acrobatics.

==20th century==
As reliable commercial pharmaceuticals were produced on an industrial level in the early 20th century, the reputation of and market for home remedies began to dwindle, and medicine shows came to rely ever more on their entertainment value. But as America's population became less rural and more urbanized, the availability of other forms of entertainment, such as [[film|motion pictures]], [[vaudeville]] and later [[radio]], led to the gradual disappearance of the traveling medicine show. By the 1930s few such companies continued to tour in the United States. Even fewer shows endured the economic and social upheaval of the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]]. Those that survived into the 1950s found themselves competing with [[television]] and came to be regarded as relics of an earlier, more innocent era.  This novelty, far more than the availability of the remedies peddled, provided the chief support for the last of the traveling medicine shows.

===The Hadacol Caravan===
One of the most famous of the 20th-century traveling shows was the Hadacol Caravan, sponsored by [[Louisiana]] State Senator [[Dudley J. LeBlanc]] and his LeBlanc Corporation, makers of the dubious [[patent medicine]]/[[vitamin|vitamin tonic]] [[Hadacol]], known for both its alleged curative powers and its high alcohol content. The stage show, which ran throughout the [[Deep South]] in the 1940s with great publicity, featured a number of notable music acts and [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] celebrities and promoted Hadacol, which was sold during [[intermission]] and after the show. Admission to the show was paid in [[boxtop]]s of the vitamin tonic, sold in stores throughout the southern United States. The Caravan came to a sudden halt in 1951, when the Hadacol enterprise fell apart in a financial scandal.

===Chief Thundercloud and Peg Leg Sam===
One of the last great medicine shows had its swan song in the summer of 1972, when the two-man show of Chief Thundercloud (pitchman Leo Kahdot, a [[Potawatomi]] from [[Oklahoma]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Herbs! Roots! Bark!

It was the last show of the year for them; Kahdot died that winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Born for Hard Luck (1976) Directed by Tom Davenport |type= movie review |series= 13 More Essential Southern Documentaries |last= Ridley |first= Jim |url= http://oxfordamericanmag.com/content.cfm?ArticleID=169&amp; |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070621014457/http://oxfordamericanmag.com/content.cfm?ArticleID=169&amp; |archivedate= 2007-06-21 |magazine= [[Oxford American]] |issue= 56 |accessdate= 2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Doc" Scott’s Last Real Old Time Medicine Show===
Perhaps the last of the medicine shows was run by [[Ramblin' Tommy Scott|Tommy Scott]], who staged as many as three hundred shows per year until about 1990. As a teenager in the 1930s, Scott joined the ''"Doc" Chambers Medicine Show'', established by M. F. Chambers in the late nineteenth century. Scott sang, played guitar, performed [[ventriloquism]] and [[blackface]] acts, and pitched Chambers's Herb-O-Lac herbal [[laxative]]. When Chambers retired in the late 1930s, Scott took charge of the show, performing for many years with his wife, Mary, and his sidekick, Gaines Blevins, known as "Old Bleb". Scott's daughter, Sandra, performed in the show as a singer, bass player, and acrobat, and from the 1960s onward managed the business end of the show. Herb-O-Lac eventually gave way to a [[menthol]]ated skin [[liniment]], which Scott dubbed Snake Oil. For decades, the show toured arenas and senior centers as ''"Doc" Scott's Last Real Old Time Medicine Show''. From the 1960s to the 1980s, the show also solicited donations for charitable organizations such as the [[Lions Clubs International|Lions Club]] and the [[Optimist International|Optimist Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/15/arts/music/tommy-scott-singer-songwriter-and-pitchman-dies-at-96.html?hpw |title= Tommy Scott, Country Singer with a Traveling Medicine Show, Dies at 96 |newspaper= [[The New York Times|New York Times]] |date= 2013-10-14 |accessdate= 2014-01-04 |last= Yardley |first= William}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The 1930 film ''[[The Medicine Man (1930 film)|The Medicine Man]]'' mixes comedy and melodrama with a medicine show coming into a small town.

In the 1932 [[Fleischer Studios]] cartoon ''[[Betty Boop, M.D.]]'', Betty, Bimbo and Koko are the owners of a traveling medicine show. They are selling "Jippo", an all-purpose health tonic, which appears to be water pumped from a fire hydrant, although consuming it has a number of bizarre effects.

In the 1933 [[Krazy Kat]] cartoon ''[[The Medicine Show]]'', Krazy runs a medicine show where he performs some acts and sells bottled liquids which have a variety of uses.

[[James Thurber]]'s eponymous "Doc Marlowe" (published in ''Let Your Mind Alone!'', in 1937) is a retired [[snake oil]] salesman in a traveling show, later selling the product as ''Blackhawk Liniment''. In a typical Thurber twist, Marlowe cheats in a small way at cards and in other games of chance, but his massages with snake-oil (a harmless but expensive preparation) are in fact highly effective.

In the 1949 film ''[[The Inspector General (film)|The Inspector General]]'', the character played by [[Danny Kaye]] works for a medicine show, selling "Yakov's Golden Elixir".

Several modern musical acts have named themselves after this old-time phenomenon, including [[Old Crow Medicine Show]], [[Dr. West's Medicine Show and Junk Band]], [http://www.moondogmedicineshow.com/ Moondog Medicine Show],  [[Dr. Hook &amp; The Medicine Show]] and [[MV &amp; EE|MV &amp; EE Medicine Show]]. The name was also used in the titles of [[The Dream Syndicate]]'s album ''[[Medicine Show (album)|Medicine Show]]'', [[Big Audio Dynamite]]'s song "Medicine Show", [[Moxy Früvous]]'s song "The Incredible Medicine Show", and [[The Band]]'s song "[[Stage Fright (album)|W.S. Walcott Medicine Show]]". Throughout 2010 and 2011, the hip hop artist [[Madlib]] released a 12-part mix series with the title "[[Madlib Medicine Show]]".

[[Science fiction]] author [[Orson Scott Card]] titled his online sci-fi journal "The [[Intergalactic Medicine Show]]".

British comedy trio [[The Goodies]] perform a scene as part of "The Goodies Traveling Medicine Show" in the episode of [[The Goodies (TV series)|their TV series]] entitled "[[Hospital For Hire]]". The scene includes a planted shill ([[Tim Brooke-Taylor]]) being pulled from the audience to 'prove' that the mystery elixir cured all ailments.

In [[Rockstar Games|Rockstar's]] video game ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'', one of the main characters plays the role of an early 20th-century hustler peddling what John Marston refers to as snake oil.

"[[Your Song]]", by [[Elton John]], also mentions a man who makes "potions in a traveling show".

In 1970 two original members of [[The Open Theater]], Barbara Vann and James Barbosa, founded [[Medicine Show Theatre Ensemble]] also in New York. It moved around a number of times in its early years, having permanent performing spaces in 14 different locations until finally settling on West 52nd Street, where it remains today. Its work has consisted of new plays, original adaptations of classic books, reconstructions of classic musicals (especially those by [[Cole Porter]]) which were thought to have been lost, and clever adaptations of famous works, like inserting Cole Porter songs into Shakespeare plays and turning them into musical comedies.

On the 1974 album ''[[Everything You Know Is Wrong]]'' by the comedy troupe [[The Firesign Theatre]], the recording's narrator plays a wire recording of "Dr. Firesign's" medicine show, in which "Professor Archer" promotes "Chief Dancing Knockout's Pyramid Pushover Paste" and "Don Brouhaha's Inca Hell-Oil Tonic". Archer and his assistant prepare and ingest an [[hallucinogen]]ic potion with these ingredients which leads to an encounter with an Indian [[shaman]]. The entertainment consists of a play parodying ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''.

The song "[[Gypsys, Tramps &amp; Thieves]]", performed by [[Cher]], is about a girl who was "born in the wagon of a traveling show". Her father would sell bottles of [[snake oil]] medicine called "Doctor Good".

The music video for the [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Paul McCartney]] song "[[Say, Say, Say]]" shows McCartney, [[Linda McCartney|his wife]], and Jackson performing a traditional medicine show.

In the "Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy" episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Grampa Simpson]] travel across country, giving medicine shows for their aphrodisiac, "Simpson and Son's Tonic".

Performing as medicine pitchman J. Phineas Flusterbeck, magician Mark Nilsen presents shows based on the old medicine shows. He pitches "Blue Root Elixir", which (according to a fabricated biography) "restored his confidence in the gullibility of the American public".

Magician [[Whit Haydn|"Pop" Haydn]] models his magic shows after old-time medicine shows, complete with the selling of several products such as "Pop Haydn's Miracle Oil", which he claims to have received from "[[Placebo]] Indians".

The 1977 live-action/animated musical film ''[[Pete's Dragon (1977 film)|Pete's Dragon]]'' features a medicine showman called Dr. Terminus (played by [[Jim Dale]]), and local townspeople being first skeptical, then duped, by his claimed healing abilities.

The '''North Carolina Film Office''', originally called the "North Carolina Film Commission," is a member of the [[Association of Film Commissioners International]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afci.org/wwwapps/profile.ami?workingSearchKeyword=north%20carolina&amp;workingCommissionID=4605 "North Carolina Film Office"], ''Association of Film Commissioners International'', Retrieved 2007-11-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
&lt;!-- [[WP:Citing IMDb]] --&gt;
Founded in 1980 by Governor [[Jim Hunt|James B. Hunt]], the office was [[Film commission|commissioned]] to help facilitate and provide a base of operation for [[North Carolina|North Carolina's]] burgeoning film industry.  Governor Hunt appointed William "Bill" Arnold to lead the office.&lt;ref name="ncfilm1"&gt;[http://www.ncfilm.com/about-us.html "About Us"], ''North Carolina Film Office'', Retrieved 2008-02-15.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] created [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group]].  He built and based a studio complex (now [[EUE/Screen Gems]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screengemsstudios.com/ |title=EUE/Screen Gems |publisher=Screengemsstudios.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]].  The area quickly became one of the busiest production centers for film and television east of Hollywood.  The North Carolina Film Office was created during a time when new technology, audience demand for location authenticity, and Hollywood’s need for lower production costs were driving filmmakers to search distant sites throughout the United States for fresh places to make movies.&lt;ref name="ncfilm1"/&gt;

With Bill Arnold leading, the North Carolina Film Commission witnessed a dramatic increase in production during the 1980s and the 1990s.  Notable films during this time include: ''[[The Color Purple (1985 film)|The Color Purple]]'' (1985),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088939/locations The Color Purple (1985) - Filming Locations - IMDb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'' (1987),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092890/locations Dirty Dancing (1987) - Filming Locations - IMDb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Bull Durham]]'' (1988),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094812/locations Bull Durham (1988) - Filming Locations - IMDb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Days of Thunder]]'' (1990),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099371/locations Days of Thunder (1990) - Filming Locations - IMDb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Sleeping with the Enemy (1991 film)|Sleeping with the Enemy]]'' (1991),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102945/locations Sleeping with the Enemy (1991) - Filming Locations - IMDb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Last of the Mohicans (1992 film)|Last of the Mohicans]]'' (1992),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104691/locations The Last of the Mohicans (1992) - Filming Locations - IMDb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]'' (1993),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106977/locations The Fugitive (1993) - Filming Locations - IMDb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  and ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]'' (1994).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109506/locations The Crow (1994) - Filming Locations - IMDb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1998 Wilmington, NC became the home of [[The WB Television Network|the WB's]] critically acclaimed television network series ''[[Dawson's Creek]]''. The series remained in Wilmington until 2003 when it was cancelled and replaced with ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]''—a series on The WB/[[The CW Television Network|CW]] that calls North Carolina "home." ''One Tree Hill'' ended in 2012 after nine seasons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368530/locations "ONE TREE HILL: Filming Locations"], ''Internet Movie Database'', Retrieved on 2007-11-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Wilmington, NC continued to sustain itself with television, the international film climate began to shift out of North Carolina's favor. In an effort to keep production costs even cheaper, early 2000 saw [[Runaway production|production companies making films internationally]].&lt;ref&gt;Carvajal, Doreen [http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/05/18/news/cash.php "The Cannes Festival: A modern twist on 'location, location, location'"], ''International Herald Tribune'', May 18, 2005, Retrieved on 2007-11-19&lt;/ref&gt; The North Carolina Film Commission was made most aware of this trend when it lost [[Charles Frazier]]'s North Carolina tale, ''[[Cold Mountain (film)|Cold Mountain]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0159365/locations "COLD MOUNTAIN: Filming Locations"], ''Internet Movie Database'', Retrieved on 2007-11-19.&lt;/ref&gt; to the country of [[Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;Fellerath, David, [http://www.indyweek.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A20684 "North Carolina gets its close-up"], ''Independent Weekly'', December 13, 2003, Retrieved 2007-11-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Hoping to bring an international industry back to the United States, many law-makers across the US began creating incentives packages to encourage filming in individual states.

'''Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus''' was the final of three [[Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus Comedy Tour|comedy event series]], [[concert tour]] starring [[comedian]]s featured on [[Opie and Anthony]], a talk radio show which aired on [[XM Satellite Radio]]. It was the third annual Traveling Virus tour, the first [[Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus Comedy Tour (2006)|one]] occurring in 2006 in four different US cities, and the [[Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus Comedy Tour (2007)|second]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laughspin.com/2007/06/11/opie-anthony-something-wickedly-funny-this-way-comes/ Opie &amp; Anthony: Something Wickedly Funny This Way Comes]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==

The tour was a goal of Opie and Anthony's since coming together as a radio talk duo in [[Long Island]] in the early 1990s.{{cn|date=February 2015}} The tour was intended to reward the comedians that had been guesting on the show over the years, and to serve as a thank you to fans nationwide.{{cn|date=February 2015}} They were finally able to present the tour in 2006 because of their terrestrial radio deal with CBS. 

The 2006 tour was notable for the Philadelphia incident where comedian [[Bill Burr]] went on a 12-minute tirade attacking the audience after the previous act, [[Dom Irrera]], was heckled heavily by the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jonathan-valania/the-mouth-that-roared-qa-_b_4242841.html The Mouth That Roared: Q&amp;A With Comedian Bill Burr, The Man Who Told Philadelphia To Go F*ck Itself, Hard, And Lived To Tell]&lt;/ref&gt; At many of the shows that followed the fans would boo the comedians in order to try and relive the same excitement as Philadelphia. The 2008 full tour was eventually canceled in favor of one final show held on August 2 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/970-lineup-talk-article-1.315712 970 AM's lineup could be all the talk]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Opie and Anthony the tour was cancelled due to the crowd consistently booing new comedians off the stage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shayne-michael.com/links.php?searchFor=Jim%20Norton&amp;findBio=full Jim Norton Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The socio-legal history of prostitution in Finland is similar to that of other European and Western countries, with various periods of tolerance, regulation and abolition.

===18th century - early 20th century===

The passing of the [[Civil Code of 1734]] was the first nation-wide law for all of Sweden, as well as Finland, that prohibited prostitution.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Venla Roth [https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=ZVkyAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP3&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false''Defining Human Trafficking and Identifying Its Victims: A Study on the Impact and Future Challenges of International, European and Finnish Legal Responses to Prostitution-Related Trafficking in Human Beings''] (Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, Boston, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; The historical position of [[sexual morality]] was based on the [[Christian]] standard of condemning both premarital and extramarital sexual relations. These religious values were reflected in the common law across Europe and most Western societies throughout this period.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The next major development came in the form of the 1889 Penal Code of Finland,&lt;ref&gt;[https://prostitution.procon.org/sourcefiles/FinlandPenalCode.pdf "The Penal Code of Finland 1899".] Retrieved 5 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; which prohibited both [[Procuring (prostitution)|pandering]] and prostitution.  The code extended the prohibition to cover ‘any professional fornication’, meaning the law would not tolerate prostitution no matter where it was taking place. International activism concerning prostitution at the end of the 19th century transformed the societal view of prostitution as an aspect of urban life to one which perceived the labour as a social problem.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Greggor Mattson [https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=3VR7CwAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''The Cultural Politics of European Prostitution Reform: Governing Loose Women''] (Palsgrave Macmillan, Hampshire, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; This evolution demanded the removal of prostitutes from the public eye through criminalisation of the female prostitutes as delinquents.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

From 1937 to 1986 the Vagrancy Act was also in effect in Finland. In accordance with the legislation prostitutes could be taken under control and given orders by the police and social and health care authorities.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Marjut Jyrkinen [https://helda.helsinki.fi/dhanken/bitstream/handle/10227/118/146-951-555-882-4.pdf?sequence=2''The Organisation of Policy Meets the Commercialisation of Sex: Global Linkages, Policies, Technologies''] (Helsingfors, Helsinki, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; This could include interrogations, sending to institutions, arrests, obligations to undergo health examinations and various other regulatory requests.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.housingrightswatch.org/sites/default/files/2012-12-11_RPT_FINLAND_anti_soc_laws_en.pdf Housing Rights Watch "Finland"] (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Activism after [[World War II]] and the gradual 20th century abandoning of the standard of absolute sexual morality again shifted social perceptions of prostitution.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The economic depression, alongside other structural and political reasons, contributed to an increase in the sex trade after the Second World War.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; The universal human rights movement of the time pushed for the decriminalisation of prostitution so as not to punish women who were victims of poverty or exploitation.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

===Late 20th century – present===

The geopolitical position of Finland, and its position in the [[European Union]] as of 1995, had a significant influence on the sex trade in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Access to sex services became increasingly easier across most cities and rural areas in Finland during this time. The established political connection with Western Europe allowed people to move more freely across borders and hence engage in the sex services market in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;Charlotta Holmstrom and May-Len Skilbrei [http://www.nikk.no/wp-content/uploads/NIKKpub2008_prostitution_conferanceEng1.pdf "Prostitution in the Nordic Countries"] (Nordic Gender Institute, Conference report, Stockholm, 16–17 October 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities estimated that in the 1990s the amount of prostitutes working in Finland was approximately 2000, with 200 of these being of foreign origin.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; The effects of [[economic depression]], mass unemployment and the resulting economic position of women also contributed to the intensification in the volume and forms of national prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;Antti Häkkinen [https://books.google.co.nz/books/about/Rahasta_vaan_ei_rakkaudesta.html?id=SSoJPQAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Rahasta - vaan ei rakkaudesta: prostituutio Helsingissä 1867-1939''] (Otava, Helsinki, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; The increased trend of [[transnational organised crime]] in pandering and [[human trafficking]] operations shifted public concern from the protection of public morality to protection of public order and security.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children|UN Trafficking Protocol]], adopted in Finland in 2000, and the European Union Council Framework Decision on combating trafficking in human beings,&lt;ref&gt;T Pedersen [https://ec.europa.eu/anti-trafficking/sites/antitrafficking/files/framework_decision_2002_629_on_combating_trafficking_en_1.pdf “Council Framework Decision of 19 July 2002 on Combating Trafficking in Human Beings"] (2002) 629 JHA 203.&lt;/ref&gt; adopted in 2002, both obligated cooperating states to criminalise trafficking and increase border control to prevent transnational organised crime.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; These international obligations acted as the starting point for the restructuring of prostitution legislation in Finland. In 2003 both the purchasing and selling of sexual services were prohibited under Finnish law where either occurred in a public place.

== Types of Prostitution ==

=== Street Prostitution ===
[[Street prostitution]] consisted of both foreign and native prostitutes; however, a majority of the bunch are foreign prostitutes. This was made up of the female prostitutes and males referred to as "[[Kerb crawler|kerb-crawlers]]" that sought out the services of the female prostitutes. Street prostitution made its way to the center of the capital city of Helsinki where it became very popular with about 50 street prostitutes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tani|first=Sirpa|date=June 2002|title=Whose Place is This Space? Life in the Street Prostitution Area of Helsinki, Finland|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|language=en|volume=26|issue=2|pages=343–359|doi=10.1111/1468-2427.00383|issn=0309-1317}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local residents of Helsinki were upset with the allowance of street prostitution in their neighborhoods, so in 1994 a female activist group formed in order to abolish street prostitution as a whole. They started the movement called "Prostitution Off the Streets" where they patrolled the streets at night for any potential street prostitution as well as initiated a petition against street prostitution.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MMjfCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA290&amp;lpg=PA290&amp;dq=Prostitution+Off+The+Streets+movement+finland#v=onepage&amp;q=Prostitution%20Off%20The%20Streets%20movement%20finland&amp;f=false|title=The Urban Sociology Reader|last=Lin|first=Jan|last2=Mele|first2=Christopher|date=2012-11-12|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136244155|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of prostitution was legal until 1999 when laws prohibited prostitution in public spaces. This new law pushed the business of street prostitution north to the city of Vantaa until a year later when Vantaa also began prohibiting prostitution in public spaces.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Niemi|first=Johanna and Jussi Aaltonen|date=April 2013|title=Abuse of a victim of prostitution: Evaluation of the effectiveness of the sex purchase ban|url=https://ec.europa.eu/anti-trafficking/sites/antitrafficking/files/abuse_of_a_victim_of_prostitution_evaluation_of_the_effectiveness_of_the_sex_purchase_ban_en_0.pdf|journal=Kuvailulehti|volume=|pages=121|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Online Prostitution ===
The Internet has become a popular place for advertising business; prostitution is no exception. Pictures of prostitutes and their services began being advertised online with about 80%-90% of the industry utilizing the internet in some capacity to advertise.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the early 2000’s, Finland removed servers that advertised prostitution due to ‘[[Procuring (prostitution)|procuring]]’ that the Criminal Code has outlined since 2004. However, these operations are still being run remotely in countries such as Spain. This makes it difficult for police to take action against ‘procuring’ online because, as behind the scenes operations are being taken care of remotely, they cannot trace any of the activity; they can only uncover the prostitute.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Erotic Restaurants ===
Restaurants became a location for a lot of foreign prostitutes in Finland to sell their services, particularly in the city center of Helsinki. Restaurants were willing to partake in this form of prostitution because they were able to make a profit off of the prostitutes by charging them a fee when entering the restaurant for business as well as when they leave with a client.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition to the fees, the women in erotic restaurants also lured more traffic into the restaurants which allowed the restaurants to profit even further. In the grand scheme of things, Finland as a whole also technically benefits from erotic restaurants as they are legal establishments that pay taxes so when these women create more clients for the restaurants, more money goes to taxes.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/82367747|title=Globalization, prostitution and sex-trafficking : corporeal politics|last=Elina.|first=Penttinen,|date=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415420990|location=London|oclc=82367747}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Newspaper Ads ===
In Finland, newspaper publications promoted prostitution. This was a pretty common form of advertising before the introduction of online prostitution in the early 2000s. However, the newspapers were not blatant in their advertising. They used phrases such as 'company for daytime coffee' to suggest prostitution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Occasionally, the ads would reference a “massage”, which was also a phrase that soon became synonymous with prostitution. In addition to these phrases, the newspaper ad included a phone number for the potential clients to call to obtain the desired services. Most of the newspaper ad clients, specifically, were men from Finland rather than foreign clients.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Newspaper ads for prostitution are no longer common due to the changing technological times.

== Legal framework ==

Buying or attempting to buy sex from a minor is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/teen_prostitution_a_silent_problem_in_finland/6671108|title=Teen prostitution a silent problem in Finland|website=Yle Uutiset|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Public Law and Order Act prohibits offering or buying sex in a public place. Although prostitution has become legal, [[Procuring (prostitution)|procuring]] still remains illegal. Procuring includes anything that would be considered the organization or facilitation of services for prostitutes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The criminalisation of the purchase of sex from adults has been a continuing topic of discussion in the Nordic countries. In June 2006, [[Eduskunta|parliament]] voted by 158 to 15 with four abstentions to approve a bill which outlaws the buying of sexual services from sex workers if it is linked to [[human trafficking]].&lt;ref name=swhealth&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finnbay.com/media/news/sex-workers-finland-healthy-government-reports/?PageSpeed=noscriptSex|title=Sex Workers in Finland Are Healthy, Government Reports|website=Finnbay.com|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5103132.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - Finns pass anti-prostitution law|publisher=|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was raised again in 2013 by the Justice Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/justice_minister_to_seek_full_ban_on_purchasing_sex/6814089|title=Justice Minister to seek full ban on purchasing sex|website=Yle Uutiset|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current legal position in Finland therefore allows for the private sale of sexual services, for example in brothels, but any form of human trafficking is both against the law and in breach of international human rights obligations.

Venla Roth comments that the current Finnish penal position can be seen as a compromise between the two conflicting positions on the legality of prostitution.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Foreign prostitutes==

A significant number of the prostitutes working in Finland are foreign. The proportion of the prostitutes that are migrants has increased over time, largely due to increased accessibility, political positions and economic factors.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Jaana Kauppinen and Essi Thesslund [http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CEDAW/Shared%20Documents/FIN/INT_CEDAW_NGO_FIN_16298_E.pdf ''Trafficking and Exploitation of Prostitution''] (Pro-tukipiste, Submission to the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, 31 January 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; This increased accessibility may be attributed to the geographic location of Finland because of its proximity to other European countries as well as the fact that Finland is considered to be a transit country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/akka-info/FWS.html|title=Women's Studies in Finland|last=all/SUNS|website=www.helsinki.fi|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 a special section was enacted under the Aliens Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/2004/en20040301.pdf|title=Aliens Act 2004 (Finland)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Finland. It specifies that where there are reasonable grounds to suspect an alien may sell sexual services he or she may be refused entrance into the country. The provision was justified as an objective to protect Finnish citizens from the social disturbances caused by prostitutes coming in from the East.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Statistics===

Following the enactment of the special provision, between 1999 and 2007, Border Guard authorities refused the entry of more than 1730 persons on the grounds of suspicion that they sold sexual services or had earned their income though dishonest means.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; By 2006 this number had escalated to 3300 refusals.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; These figures continue to increase, with Finnish police reporting that during the years of 2011 and 2012 there were more persons than ever deported because of suspicions of the sale of sexual services.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

Despite legislative prevention measures, there continues to be a significant number of foreign prostitutes working in Finland. The National Bureau of Investigation estimated in 2002 that the annual number of foreign prostitutes was between 10,000 and 15,000, with most of them originating from Russia and Estonia but also from other European countries.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|The Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW) noted that the majority of prostitutes working in Finland are estimated to be either foreigners living permanently in Finland or travelling from country to country under tourist visas.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women [https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G13/411/12/PDF/G1341112.pdf?OpenElement ''Consideration of reports submitted by States parties under article 18 of the Convention''] (United Nations, Seventh periodic reports of states parties, 11 May 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Bureau of Investigation (Finland)|Finnish Bureau of Investigation]] suspects that almost all of these foreign prostitutes work under the control of organised procurers.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Implications and objections===

The Aliens Act and the enforcement of the refusal to enter by authorities has been subject to polarised opinions and various human rights concerns.

In 2003 the National Bureau of Investigation stated trafficking of human beings for the purposes of sexual exploitation did not occur in Finland, and said that all foreign prostitutes were “fully aware of the nature and conditions of the work”.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; This statement, and the 1999 amendment of the Aliens Act, have however been severely critiqued on the basis that they ignore the disadvantaged status of foreign prostitutes.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Marte Mesna argues that deporting foreigners where they are suspected of coming into the country to sell sex portrays that when there are people other than citizens involved, “it is the prostitutes who suddenly become the problem again”.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;Marte Mesna [http://www.nikk.no/en/news/mixed-signals-in-nordic-prostitution-policy/ "Mixed signals in Nordic prostitution policy"] (14 November 2013) Nordic Information on Gender.&lt;/ref&gt; Venla Roth also argues along these lines, claiming that placing foreign prostitutes outside of the public system means they are not protected and are more vulnerable to exploitation.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Knowledge that a person has sold sexual services in the past constitutes reasonable grounds to believe he or she intends to do it again, hence qualifying as a ground for denial of entrance into Finland.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== National advocacy ==

Pro-tukipiste r.y. (Pro Centre Finland),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pro-tukipiste.fi/|title=Prostituution, seksityön ja ihmiskaupan asiantuntija Pro-tukipiste|date=31 January 2014|publisher=|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a registered non-profit organisation, supports and promotes the civil and human rights of sex workers in Finland, offering professional social support, health care services and legal advice, operating in Helsinki and Tampere. Services are provided without charge, anonymously, and the centre is politically and religiously independent. It also offers consultation on issues concerning sex work and human trafficking. They are a partner in the Indoors Project, a European Union initiative for analysis and policy recommendations on sex work inside the EU.

Pro-tukipiste estimates that the number of individual persons in contact with the organisation and their services each year is between 1500 and 2000.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; The majority of these people are women with migrant backgrounds.

On a smaller scale, a union group by the name of [[Salli|SALLI]], United Sex Professionals formed in 2002, also aimed to protect the human rights of sex workers in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/314828868|title=Sex worker union organising : an international study|last=Gregor.|first=Gall,|date=2006|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|others=Palgrave Connect (Online service)|isbn=9780230502482|location=Basingstoke [England]|oclc=314828868}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group of 9 sex workers that founded this organization focused on  "sex workers' human rights in terms of their well being, safety at work, professional skills, and control of workplace working conditions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/936429868|title=Sex worker unionization : global developments, challenges and possibilities|last=Gregor,|first=Gall,|isbn=9781137320131|location=New York|oclc=936429868|date=2016-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political and social debates==

Legislation concerning the purchase of sexual services remains subject to ongoing debate in Finland and the wider Nordic region.&lt;ref&gt;Ida Måwe [http://www.nikk.no/en/news/debate-on-sex-purchase-legislation-keeps-simmering/ "Debate on sex purchase legislation keeps simmering"] (17 February 2015) Nordic Information on Gender.&lt;/ref&gt; The two fundamental polarised views are those promoting legalisation of the profession and those promoting total abolition.

===Legalisers===

Legaliser is the term given to those who advocate for the rights of prostitutes, including the right to work. It is argued that the [[United Nations]] resolutions guaranteeing the right to work, such as the 1988 [[International Labour Organization]] recognition of sex work, align with promoting the rights of sex workers.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The [[U.S. Department of State]]'s [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor]], in its annual [[Country Report on Human Rights Practices]] for Finland, discuss discrimination in respect to employment and occupation in their 2016 report on Finland.&lt;ref&gt;Rex W. Tillerson [https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm#wrapper ''Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2016: Finland''] (Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; While the Bureau does not explicitly state the law on prostitution to be in breach of the right to work, those who adopt the legaliser approach stress this relationship.

===Abolitionists===

Abolitionists are the people whom advocate for the opposing view in relation to prostitution. This argument is largely based on United Nations statements against prostitution from the early days of the [[League of Nations]] and the Palermo Protocol (2002) on preventing trafficking in persons, especially women and children.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; This position reflects the increased public concern about human trafficking and its connection to prostitution.

The [[Ministry of Social Affairs and Health]] in Finland started a five-year national programme for the Prevention of Prostitution and Violence against Women from 1998 to 2002, demonstrating its preference of total prohibition.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;Women's Studies in Finland  [http://www.helsinki.fi/akka-info/FWS.html#PREVENTION%20OF%20PROSTITUTION%201998%20- "Prevention of Prostitution 1998-2002"] (April 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; The Minister of Social Affairs and Health, who chaired this programme, claims the negative health implications of prostitution raise concerns related to human rights and ethics.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt; Finland’s Minister of Justice, [[Anna-Maja Henriksson]], argued for total prohibition of all forms of sex purchase in 2012.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;

===Nordic model===

The [[Prostitution in Sweden|Nordic Model]] refers to the legal position of Sweden where it is illegal to buy sexual services but the sale of one’s own body for the sexual services is not illegal. This position attempts to reduce the demand for prostitution by punishing the clients instead of the prostitutes.&lt;ref name="auto7"&gt;Bosse Parbring [http://www.nikk.no/en/news/european-parliament-wants-to-punish-the-clients-of-prostitution/ "European Parliament wants to punish the clients of prostitution"] (27 February 2014) Nordic Information on Gender.&lt;/ref&gt; The European Parliament advanced in a non-binding resolution passed on 26 February 2014 that all EU countries should adopt this approach.&lt;ref&gt;European Parliament [http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20140221IPR36644/punish-the-client-not-the-prostitute "Punish the client, not the prostitute"] (press release, 26 February 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; It was emphasised that prostitution as a profession violates human dignity and human rights whether the work is forced or voluntary. The European Parliament therefore focuses on finding exit strategies and alternative sources of income for women working as prostitutes. This resolution, calling on the example of the Nordic model, was adopted by 343 votes to 139, with 105 abstentions.&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt;

===International input===

In September 2009 the Ministry of Justice submitted a report to Parliament.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; The report discussed the link between the demand for sexual services and human trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation. CEDAW however stress that the prevalence of trafficking is also influenced by multiple other factors, including those relating to economic and political instability. They therefore advance that it is important to view prostitution and the demand for sexual services and trafficking from a broad, holistic point of view.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

Pro-tukipiste also provides their perspective in relation to the information in the Ministry of Justice report. They claim the data is bias, narrow and questionable with no voice given to those who sell the sexual services.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; It is also suggested by the organisation in their own studies that the current law in Finland has caused the position of prostitutes to deteriorate, the risk of violence to increase and has introduced further negative impacts for foreign workers.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

The United States attributed Finland a Tier 2 rating through their State Department Trafficking in Person (TIP) Report League in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of State [https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/21555.pdf ''Trafficking in Persons Report''] (Office of the Under Secretary for Global Affairs, June 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside Uganda and Albania, Finland was given this rating on the basis of rumours of ‘enclosed prostitution camps’. The Finnish Minister of Justice and several EU allies rebutted the US claims.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

=== Social Perspectives ===
Over time, prostitution has become more accepted by people, prodominately men, in Finland. The 2012 Gender Equality Barometer study showed that from 2004 to 2008, only 60% of men found it socially acceptable to pay prostitutes for sex. However, that number increased to 66% of males in 2012.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This study also showed that men find it more socially acceptable to pay for sex than women do, as they are the main clientele for prostitution services. However, the amount of men that actually reported purchasing sex in the Finsex survey conducted in 2007, was significantly lower around about 3% of men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Men buying services from prostitutes view it as a normal behavior that speaks to their sexuality. Weather these men are using prostitution as a way to avoid relationships or responsibilities, they enjoy the feeling of power they achieve through these acts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In contrast, prostitution was often controversial for those opposed to it as it was synonymous with drugs, crime, and immoral behavior.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Street prostitution, specifically, was seen by residents as a downturn in their neighborhoods. Residents of neighborhoods in which street prostitution became increasingly popular viewed it as an issue of morality. They believed it was their moral duty to "clean" the streets of these prostitutes, because of the negative connotations it brought to their neighborhoods, which they believed would create a better environment for everyone.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Research ==

The health of sex workers in Finland has been an ongoing project of the Finnish Government&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thl.fi/fi/web/thlfi-en/research-and-expertwork/projects-and-programmes/projects/30576|title=Prostitution and health in Finland|website=National Institute for Health and Welfare|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and data suggests a good level of health, and in particular an absence of [[sexually transmitted diseases]].&lt;ref name=swhealth/&gt;

The National Council of Women in Finland notes that obtaining evidence and research on the purchase of sexual services overall has proven difficult in practice, particularly from procured prostitutes.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The Association suggests that authorities must either allocate sufficient resources to the enforcement of the current penal provision or reconsider the most appropriate legal position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naisjarjestot.fi|title=Etusivu - Naisjärjestöjen Keskusliitto|website=www.naisjarjestot.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Finland}}
Finland is a transit, destination, and limited source country for women and girls subjected to [[sex trafficking]]. Traffickers operate from abroad using threats of violence, debt leverage, and other forms of coercion. Victims originate primarily in [[Eastern Europe]], [[West Africa]], and [[Asia]]. Authorities report a surge in potential trafficking victims among rejected asylum-seekers returning to Finland under the [[Dublin Regulation|Dublin Agreement]], including a rise in the number of individuals exploited prior to their arrival in Finland, such as [[Nigeria]]n women who account for the majority of sex trafficking victims.&lt;ref name="state18"&gt;{{cite web |title=Finland 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282655.htm |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=28 July 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Finland as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 1]]' country.&lt;ref name="state18" /&gt;

{{see also|Seriality}}
'''Seriality''' or '''serial collectivity''' is a term that [[feminist]] scholar [[Iris Marion Young]] used to describe a reconceptualization of the category of [[woman]] in her 1994 essay ''Gender as Seriality''. [[Iris Marion Young|Young]] borrows the concept of [[seriality]] from [[Sartre]]'s ''[[Critique of Dialectical Reason]]'', where he originally developed the idea to describe the relationship of individuals to social classes and the capitalist system of production and consumption. Understanding women as a ''series'', rather than a ''group'', entails the recognition that the category ''woman'' is not defined by any common biological or psychological characteristics; rather, individuals are positioned as ''woman'' by a set of material and immaterial social constructs that are the product of previous human actions.

==Group vs series==

A group, in [[Sartre]]'s definition, is a collection of people who self-consciously recognize themselves to be in a unified relationship with each other in the undertaking of a common project. A mutual acknowledgment of actively shared goals is the chief feature of a group. Guilds, reading groups, addiction support groups and animal cruelty prevention groups are all examples of groups.

Seriality, in contrast to the active effort of group being, describes a level of social existence that is habitually constrained and directed by existing circumstances and material conditions.
In a series, a collection of people are unified ''passively'' by objects, routines practices and habits around which their actions are oriented. For instance, people waiting in line for a bus, radio listeners, prison inmates and [[street theatre]] spectators are all examples of series. In each example, individuals are oriented toward the same goals by their response to existing conditions and structures in the environment, which are the collective legacy of human actions and decisions in the past. To illustrate concretely, the actions of people who stop and watch a street theatre performance may be shaped by existing conditions which constrain and permit their actions, such as the social acceptability of staging a performance on the street, the attractive costumes of the performers, high unemployment rates among actors, the existence of a public square, social expectations of their roles as spectators. Members of a series are anonymous and isolated, although not alone, often individuals in a series take into account the expected behavior of other members when pursuing their own actions – for instance, a bus rider may choose to avoid rush hour traffic. Members of a series are also interchangeable, although not identical, in relation to the objects that effect their serialized condition: from the point of view of a radio program broadcaster, one listener is interchangeable with another.

Groups and series are related in that groups arise out of a backdrop of seriality, and disperse to fall back into serialized conditions. In other words, groups are the product of individuals' response to shared conditions; Young gives the example of commuters at a bus stop who, when the bus fails to appear, organize themselves into a group to hail taxis, complain to the bus company, etc.

==Seriality as a solution to a conceptual dilemma in feminism==

Young's reconceptualization of ''women'' as a ''series'' is an attempt to provide a solution to the problems in [[feminist]] discourse surrounding the grouping of all [[women]] in a single category. This problem exists as a dilemma between two conflicting positions: &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Iris Marion|date=1994-04-01|title=Gender as Seriality: Thinking about Women as a Social Collective|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/494918|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume=19|issue=3|pages=713–738|doi=10.1086/494918|issn=0097-9740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

i) On one hand, it is important to be able to speak of [[women]] as a group for practical political reasons. Feminist politics is organized around this category of ''woman''; its existence as a movement fundamentally depends on this conceptualization. Additionally, the category of ''women'' is necessary in order to understand [[oppression]] and disadvantage as something that is systematically inflicted upon women (or any societal group) in a structured, [[institution]]alized process, as opposed to being a natural or unique condition. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

ii) On the other hand, the category of ''woman'' is fraught with problems of essentialization, [[normalization (sociology)|normalization]] and exclusion. As [[Elizabeth Spelman]] points out, social categories are [[social construct|constructs]] that carry latent expressions of privilege and subordination; in this manner, feminist theories have often assumed the experience of white, [[middle-class]] [[heterosexual]] women as representative for all women, excluding less privileged points of view. [[Chandra Talpade Mohanty|Chandra Mohanty]] suggests that the category of ''woman'' creates the false impression of a coherent, homogeneous group, which leads to the mistake of assuming that all women are equally powerless and oppressed, rather than generating specific questions about oppression that can be empirically investigated. [[Judith Butler]] goes as far as to argue that the very act of defining such a gender category is what produces the [[normalization (sociology)|normalizations]] that privilege some viewpoints and exclude others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Thinking of ''woman'' as a series solves these conceptual problems. It allows one to meaningfully use the category while avoiding the mistake of falsely [[essentialism|essentializing]] women as a group. An [[essentialist]] approach attempts to define ''woman'' by common biological characteristics – evidently false when one considers, for instance, [[transgender]], [[bigender]] or [[intersex]] people, for instance – or by finding commonality in the vast diversity of women's actual lives, clearly not a viable enterprise.
A serial conception of ''woman'' also disconnects the idea of gender from an individual's personal identity, as it defines gender as a pre-existing set of societal forces that are visited upon each individual; this approach does not make any claims about the way individuals respond to these pressures. Indeed, the conception of gender as seriality derives its strength from precisely the fact that it does not attempt a comprehensive definition of the individual, but acknowledges that individuals exist within structures that constrain and channel their actions in particular ways.

==Other potential applications of seriality==

[[Iris Marion Young|Young]] has suggested that the concept of seriality might also be usefully applied to relationships of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] or [[nationality]] as linkages which also result from historical conditions – such as the institution of [[slavery]] and projects of [[nation-building]] – which also function to limit and enable individuals' actions on the level of everyday life and habit.

==Synopsis==
An unforeseen event changes the life of Qu Tan'er (Liang Jie), after a suicide attempt over her love for Mo Yihuai (Wang Ruichang). She wakes up to find that another person has entered her body, namely Qu Xiaotan, who has time-traveled from the modern world. Both girls share a different personality, with Qu Tan'er being gentle and submissive while Qu Xiaotan is wild and uninhibited; whenever one of them tells a lie, the other takes over their shared body. Duty forces Qu Tan'er to marry Mo Liancheng ([[Xing Zhaolin]]), thus beginning an unexpected romance between two people thrown together by circumstance: infact, as Tan'er persists in her love for Yihuai, Liancheng falls in love with modern girl Xiaotan.

'''''Under the Mat: Inside Wrestling's Greatest Family''''' is a [[book]] co-written by [[Diana Hart]] (daughter of [[Stu Hart|Stu]] and [[Helen Hart (wrestling)|Helen Hart]], ex-wife of [[Davey Boy Smith]] and mother of [[Harry Smith (wrestler)|Harry Smith]]) and journalist Kirstie McLellan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingHarts/nov5_jenkinson-sun.html | title = Slam and sleaze is Diana's expertise | author = Michael Jenkinson | publisher = Edmonton Sun | accessdate=2007-06-18 | date = November 5, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://slam.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingHarts/diana_june01-can.html|title= Diana Hart book out this fall |accessdate=June 5, 2001 |publisher=[[canoe.ca]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://slam.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingHarts/diana_01oct4-can.html|title=Mother's health, book on Diana Hart-Smith's mind |date=October 4, 2001 |publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subtitle, ''Inside Wrestling's Greatest Family'', refers to the Canadian [[Hart wrestling family]], which includes wrestlers such as [[Smith Hart]], [[Bruce Hart (wrestler)|Bruce Hart]], [[Keith Hart (wrestler)|Keith Hart]], [[Dean Hart]], [[Bret Hart]], [[Ross Hart]], [[Owen Hart]], [[Teddy Hart]], David Hart Smith and [[Natalya Neidhart]] among others. The book is highly controversial and was pulled from stores after [[Martha Hart]], widow of Owen Hart and Diana Hart's sister-in-law, filed a lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1 = Kristian Pope |author2= Ray Whebbe | title = The Encyclopedia of Professional Wrestling: 100 Years of History, Headlines &amp; Hitmakers |publisher = [[Krause Publications]] | year = 2003 | location =  | url =   | doi = | id = | isbn = 0873496256| page = 66 pp}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book became an Alberta top ten nonfiction best-seller on its release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.publisherpage.com/index.php/2/20052 |title= CAULIFLOWER HEART: A ROMANTIC WRESTLER |date=2016 |publisher= Publisherpage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.se/books?id=eMwgAQAAMAAJ&amp;q="diana+hart"+"book"+wrestling&amp;dq="diana+hart"+"book"+wrestling&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi05Oa-36vaAhVIDywKHRX_A2sQ6AEIXjAH&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The writing of the book was at least partially motivated by the death of her younger brother Owen Hart. Hart has also stated that she hoped that the book would lead to her brother Bret respecting her and taking her seriously, which she did not feel he had done during the investigation and trial which surrounded the death of Owen Hart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingChats/hart_diana_nov01-can.html |title= SLAM! Wrestling - Diana Hart Chat |accessdate= November 2, 2001 |publisher=[[canoe.ca|Canadian Online Explorer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McLellan has stated that she and Hart know each other personally and Hart approached her to make the book together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.macleans.ca/general/on-theo-fleurys-drug-and-alcohol-addled-memories-and-the-bob-probert-she-knew/|title= On Theo Fleury’s drug- and alcohol-addled memories, and the Bob Probert she knew|accessdate= November 16, 2011|publisher= macleans.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
The book focuses mainly on the realities of professional wrestling. ''Under the Mat'' recounts Diana's life growing up in the [[Hart wrestling family|Hart home]], being sister to [[Owen Hart|Owen]] and [[Bret Hart|Bret]], witnessing their rise to fame and [[Owen Hart#Death|the terrible tragedy]] which claimed Owen's life. She remembers her father training some of the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWF]]'s and [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]]'s biggest names in her family's basement gym, the famous [[Hart  Dungeon|Dungeon]], and recounts their tales to stardom.

In the chapter "Roots" she also discusses her family's history on her mother's side. It focuses mostly on her grandfather, American marathon runner [[Harry Smith (athlete)|Harry Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Hart  | first = Diana  | authorlink = Diana Hart  |author2=McLellan, Kirstie  | title = [[Under the Mat: Inside Wrestling's Greatest Family]]  | publisher = [[Fenn]]  | year = 2001  | location =     | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 1-55168-256-7| page = 16 pp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

The book has received generally negative critique. It has been criticised for its factual errors, grammatical mistakes, spelling issues and unstructured content.&lt;ref&gt;"{{cite web|url= http://www.inlewd.com/exclusives/reviews/books/dhart.shtml|title= Inlewd Book Review: Under The Mat: Inside Wrestling's Greatest Family|date= 2002|publisher= inlewd.com|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304065737/http://www.inlewd.com/exclusives/reviews/books/dhart.shtml|archivedate= 2016-03-04|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Heath McCoy  | title = Pain and Passion: The History of Stampede Wrestling  | publisher = ECWPress  | year = 2007  | location =     | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 978-1-55022-787-1| page = 273 pp}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been criticised for its overwhelming focus on negative events. According to employees of the Toronto-based law firm Cassels Brock &amp; Blackwell LLP, a preliminary review of the book identified dozens of significant factual errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingHarts/nov20_lawsuit-can.html | title = Martha Hart sues Diana over book | author = Greg Oliver | publisher = SLAM!

===Controversy===

Hart has been accused of using ''Under the Mat'' as a way to express the "dirty secrets" of the Hart family and friends. Hart elaborates on negative details related to several people including [[Dynamite Kid]], [[Bret Hart]], [[Martha Hart]], Andrea Hart and [[Davey Boy Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://slam.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingReviews/underthemat-can.html|title= Diana Hart book will shock |date=Oct 26, 2001 |publisher=[[canoe.ca]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Heath McCoy  | title = Pain and Passion: The History of Stampede Wrestling| publisher = ECWPress  | year = 2007  | location =     | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 978-1-55022-787-1| page = 273 pp}}&lt;/ref&gt; People like Dynamite Kid, [[Ben Bassarab]], Davey Boy Smith and [[Jim Neidhart|Bret]] are in the book accused of several occasions of criminal activity. Hart has especially been accused of trying to discredit her brother [[Bret Hart]] and attempting to portray him as an obsessive egomaniac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://411mania.com/wrestling/under-the-mat-book-review/|title=Under The Mat – Book Review |work=WRESTLING / COLUMNS|author=Scotsman|date=December 8, 2002|accessdate= 2016-05-25|publisher=411MANIA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Toronto Star]]'' book reviewer Michael Holmes stated that the book was "terribly underwritten, ridiculously simplistic and pointlessly episodic, repetitive and error-riddled." He also said that the book was "one of the most manipulative, megamaniacal, deliberately unselfconscious books I have ever read. Reading it makes you feel dirty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1 = [[Martha Hart]] |author2= Eric Francis | title = Broken Harts: The Life and Death of Owen Hart |publisher = [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] | year = 2004  | isbn = 978-1-59077-036-8| page = 250 pp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, when asked about whether she had noticed any backlash from family or others, such as Jim Neidhart, Diana stated that she didn't care what Neidhart thought about the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingChats/hart_diana_nov01-can.html |title= SLAM! Wrestling - Diana Hart Chat |accessdate= November 2, 2001 |publisher=[[canoe.ca|Canadian Online Explorer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also stated that the book was not intended to be vindictive and that she is very proud to be a Hart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingChats/hart_diana_nov01-can.html |title= SLAM! Wrestling - Diana Hart Chat |accessdate= November 2, 2001 |publisher=[[canoe.ca|Canadian Online Explorer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her brother [[Bret Hart|Bret]] is a vocal critic of the book and has said that it is a very disturbing read and called it pornographic. He goes on to say that there are enough true Hart stories that Diana didn't need to resort to fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingHarts/nov5_book-sun.html | title = Explosive tell-all book brings on family feud | author = Michael Wood | publisher = Calgary Sun | accessdate=2007-06-18 | date = November 5, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bret and others have also questioned the legitimacy of the foreword which Diana claims to be written by their father, [[Stu Hart|Stu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Hart  | first = Bret  | authorlink = Bret Hart  | title = Hitman: My real life in the cartoon world of wrestling  | publisher = Ebury Press  | year = 2007  | location =     | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 9780091932862| page = 531 pp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.inlewd.com/exclusives/reviews/books/dhart.shtml|title= Inlewd Book Review: Under The Mat: Inside Wrestling's Greatest Family|date= 2002|publisher= inlewd.com|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304065737/http://www.inlewd.com/exclusives/reviews/books/dhart.shtml|archivedate= 2016-03-04|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; McLellan has stated that Bret was very upset by the book and that he confronted her about it in public at a gym which they both went to at the time.&lt;ref&gt;"In conversation with author Kirstie McLellan Day"{{cite web|url= http://www.macleans.ca/general/on-theo-fleurys-drug-and-alcohol-addled-memories-and-the-bob-probert-she-knew/|title= On Theo Fleury’s drug- and alcohol-addled memories, and the Bob Probert she knew|accessdate= November 16, 2011|publisher= macleans.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of her other brothers, [[Bruce Hart (wrestler)|Bruce]], has also criticised the book, and called it "ill conceived" and expressed that he can't understand why his sister would write such a book. He has hypothesized that Hart may have been mentally unstable at the time of the writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Straight From the Hart|last=[[Bruce Hart (wrestler)|Hart]]|first=[[Bruce Hart (wrestler)|Bruce]]|page=65|publisher=[[ECW Press]]|year=2011|isbn=978-1-55022-939-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal action was pursued by [[Martha Hart]], Owen Hart's widow. Martha claims that Diana made inaccurate and irresponsible statements about her and her family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | author1 = [[Martha Hart]] |author2= Eric Francis | title = Broken Harts: The Life and Death of Owen Hart |publisher = [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] | year = 2004  | location =     | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 978-1-59077-036-8| page = 249 pp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | author1 = [[Martha Hart]] |author2= Eric Francis | title = Broken Harts: The Life and Death of Owen Hart |publisher = [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] | year = 2004  | location =     | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 978-1-59077-036-8| page = 250 pp}}&lt;/ref&gt; She stated that the book was “filled with distortions, misstatements and unjustified slurs that attempt to destroy the reputation of my family and me, and undermine the memory of Owen.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingHarts/nov20_lawsuit-can.html | title = Martha Hart sues Diana over book | author = Greg Oliver | publisher = SLAM! Wrestling | accessdate=2007-06-18 | date = November 20, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diana defended herself in an interview for the National Post and stated that she stood by what she has written, insinuating that Martha was a rich bully who was trying to use her money to suppress her recounts.

Fenn and Co. Ltd. in January 2002. Removing the book was part of a settlement between Martha Hart and the publisher. As part of the settlement, the publisher expressed its regrets and a financial settlement was paid to the Owen Hart Foundation, a Calgary-based charity created by Martha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.vancouversun.com/mobile/story.html?id=11602569|title= Diana Hart, youngest daughter of Calgary's iconic wrestling clan, finds romance in the ring with Cauliflower Heart trilogy |accessdate=December 21, 2015|publisher= The Vancouver Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long-time wrestling announcer and Stampede alumni [[Ed Whalen (broadcaster)|Ed Whalen]] also discredited the book, referring to it as a "fairy tale" and considered joining Martha Hart in the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hart | first = Martha | authorlink1 = Martha Hart |author2=Francis, Eric  | title = Broken Harts: The Life and Death of Owen Hart |publisher = [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] | year = 2004  | location =     | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 978-1-59077-036-8| page = 250 pp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart has later asserted that the stories that were printed in the book, were completely twisted and changed from how she had written them originally, and was deeply hurt by the controversy that was caused for her family from the book. Her brother Bret has questioned her claim that she wasn't aware of the book's content before publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Hart  | first = Bret  | authorlink = Bret Hart  | title = Hitman: My real life in the cartoon world of wrestling  | publisher = Ebury Press  | year = 2007  | location =     | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 9780091932862| page = 533 pp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legitimacy===

[[Heath McCoy]], the author of the book ''[[Pain and Passion: The History of Stampede Wrestling]]'' has stated that there is some truth to some of the statements in the book, such as Hart's claim of her mother Helen's alcoholism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Heath McCoy  | title = Pain and Passion: The History of Stampede Wrestling  | publisher = ECWPress  | year = 2007  | location = | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 978-1-55022-787-1| page = 273 pp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom Billington, The Dynamite Kid has admitted to some of the criminal actions which he was accused of in the book.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTUkiWjHp-k The Dynamite Kid KickStarter Preview]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

Martha Hart's book, ''Broken Harts: The Life and Death of Owen Hart'', was partially written in response to ''Under The Mat''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Heath McCoy  | title = Pain and Passion: The History of Stampede Wrestling  | publisher = ECWPress  | year = 2007  | location =     | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 978-1-55022-787-1| page = 273 pp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=114&amp;p=1|title=MIKE JOHNSON LOOKS AT BROKEN HARTS: THE LIFE AND DEATH OF OWEN HART|author=Johnson, Mike|work=Slam! Wrestling|publisher=PWInsider.com|date= January 30, 2004|accessdate=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diana Hart has later on disowned the book and called it a failure as a journey and has stated that she is now on good terms with her brothers and sisters. She has later written a trilogy of fiction books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.vancouversun.com/mobile/story.html?id=11602569|title= Diana Hart, youngest daughter of Calgary's iconic wrestling clan, finds romance in the ring with Cauliflower Heart trilogy |accessdate=December 21, 2015|publisher= The Vancouver Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though Hart has disowned the book she has decided that it will still be mentioned in her author bio at the back of her new books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://calgaryherald.com/entertainment/books/diana-hart-youngest-daughter-of-calgarys-iconic-wrestling-clan-finds-romance-in-the-ring-with-cauliflower-heart-trilogy|title= Diana Hart, youngest daughter of Calgary's iconic wrestling clan, finds romance in the ring with Cauliflower Heart trilogy|accessdate=December 19, 2015|publisher= The Calgary Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= A ROMANTIC SPIN: Cauliflower Heart series telling the tale of a fictional wrestling clan should sidestep more hurt feelings, feuds and lawsuits |publisher=PressReader.com| url= http://www.pressreader.com/canada/edmonton-journal/20160122/281943131895383/TextView }}&lt;/ref&gt;

McLellan has stated that Hart took her on "an amazing journey" when writing the book. After the release of Under the Mat McLellan has helped write several other nonfiction books and autobiographies, including the best selling [[autobiography]] of former [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) player [[Theoren Fleury]] named ''[[Playing with Fire (book)|Playing with Fire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Hockeybookreviews"{{cite web|url= http://www.hockeybookreviews.com/2009/12/interview-with-author-kirstie-mclellan.html|title= Interview With The Author: Kirstie McLellan Day |accessdate= December 10, 2009|publisher= hockeybookreviews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''vegetation deity''' is a [[nature deity]] whose disappearance and reappearance, or [[Life-death-rebirth deity|life, death and rebirth]], embodies the growth cycle of plants. In [[nature worship]], the [[deity]] can be a [[god]] or [[goddess]] with the ability to [[Regeneration (biology)|regenerate]] itself. A vegetation deity is often a [[List of fertility deities|fertility deity]]. The deity typically undergoes dismemberment (see ''[[sparagmos]]''), scattering, and reintegration, as narrated in a [[myth]] or reenacted by a religious [[ritual]]. The cyclical pattern is given theological significance on themes such as [[immortality]], [[resurrection]], and [[reincarnation]].&lt;ref&gt;Lorena Stookey, ''Thematic Guide to World Mythology'' (Greenwood Press, 2004), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Vegetation myths have [[structuralism|structural]] resemblances to certain [[creation myth]]s in which parts of a [[wikt:primordial|primordial]] being's body generate aspects of the [[cosmology|cosmos]], such as the [[Norse mythology|Norse myth]] of [[Ymir]].&lt;ref&gt;Stookey, ''Thematic Guide to World Mythology'', p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mythography]] of the 19th and early 20th century, as for example in ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' of [[J.G. Frazer]], the figure is related to the "'''corn spirit'''", "corn" in this sense meaning grain in general. That triviality is giving the concept its tendency to turn into a meaningless generality, as [[Walter Friedrich Otto]] remarked of trying to use a "name as futile and yet pretentious as 'Vegetation deity'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Friedrich Otto|Walter F. Otto]], ''Dionysus: Myth and Cult'', translated by Robert B. Palmer (Indiana University Press, 1965), pp. 7–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of vegetation myths==
[[File:MotherGoddessFertility.JPG|100px|thumb|Cucuteni-Trypillian figurine with a sown field pattern]]
In the [[Mesopotamian religion|Mesopotamian tradition]], during the journey of [[Inanna]] or [[Ishtar]] to the underworld, the earth becomes sterile, and neither humans nor animals are able to procreate. After confronting [[Ereshkigal]], her sister and ruler of the underworld, Inanna is killed, but an emissary from the gods administers potions to restore her to life. She is allowed to return to the upper world only if someone else will take her place. Her husband, the vegetation god [[Tammuz (deity)|Dumuzi]], agrees to spend half the year in the underworld, during which time vegetation dies off. His return brings regrowth.&lt;ref name="Stookey, p. 99"&gt;Stookey, ''Thematic Guide to World Mythology'', p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ancient Egyptian religion]], the cultural achievements of [[Osiris]] among the peoples of the earth provokes the envy of his brother [[Set (mythology)|Set]], who kills and dismembers him. Osiris's wife [[Isis]] makes a journey to gather his fourteen scattered body parts. In some versions, she buries each part where she finds it, causing the desert to put forth vegetation. In other versions, she reassembles his body and resurrects him, and he then becomes the ruler of the afterlife.&lt;ref name="Stookey, p. 99"/&gt;

In [[European folklore]], a woman's fertility has an influence on farming.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SLACTsmH4aYC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;lpg=PA205&amp;dq=sown+field&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ycZReM9flc&amp;sig=lMA4arVRRhrmkUiCIzUmu2sC30k&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fhHVTqGkHsK4tgfN-6idAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CF4Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=sown%20field&amp;f=false Gimbutas, The gods and goddesses of Old Europe, p. 201]&lt;/ref&gt; Vegetation goddess figurines from the [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture]] have a [[lozenge]] and dot pattern that represents a [[sown]] [[Field (agriculture)|field]] and female fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Linda | last=Welters | title=Folk dress in Europe and Anatolia: beliefs about protection and fertility | publisher = Berg |year= 1999 | pages = 16–21 | isbn = 1-85973-282-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=35oIbNIIn-8C&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=lozenge+in+Ukrainian+embroidery#v=onepage&amp;q=lozenge%20in%20Ukrainian%20embroidery&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The death of vegetation is also associated with the travel to the underworld of [[Ningishzida]].&lt;ref name=Oracc&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stone|first1=Adam|title=Ningišzida (god)|url=http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/amgg/listofdeities/ningizida/|publisher=Ancient Mesopotamian Gods and Goddesses, Oracc and the UK Higher Education Academy|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Christianity===
In the [[parables of Jesus]], such as the [[Parable of the Sower]], "the sower soweth the word" where the [[seed]] is the word of God.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-CsVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA996&amp;dq=dead+are+sown+as+seed&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2j3VTpmGMou-tgeckbWvAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=dead%20are%20sown%20as%20seed&amp;f=false The people's Bible encyclopedia] p.996&lt;/ref&gt; The parables of [[Parable of the Mustard Seed|the mustard seed]] and [[Parable of the Growing Seed|the growing seed]] explain the [[Kingdom of God]] where growth is due to God, not man,&lt;ref name="Longenecker"&gt;Richard N. Longenecker, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JojVvncUgk0C&amp;pg=PA97 The Challenge of Jesus' Parables]'', Eerdmans, 2000, {{ISBN|0-8028-4638-6}}, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; and follows its own timetable.&lt;ref name="Edwards"&gt;James R. Edwards, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=0MjWS_4La_EC&amp;pg=PA142 The Gospel According to Mark]'', Eerdmans, 2002, {{ISBN|0-85111-778-3}}, pp. 142-144.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Gospel of John]] 12:24,&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblos.com/john/12-24.htm Text analysis John 12:24]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[death and resurrection of Jesus]] is compared to a kernel that falls in the ground and dies, and then produces many seeds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.cc/john/12-24.htm John 12:24 Parallel commentaries]&lt;/ref&gt; In many [[Christian]] traditions, [[Easter]] [[sunrise service]] or ''Resurrection Service'' is held in [[God's Acre]] where the bodies of the dead are "sown as seed." The [[sowing of seeds]] also refers to scattering of people away from their ancestral homeland.&lt;ref name=webster&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/diaspora |title=Diaspora |accessdate=2011-02-22 |quote= |publisher=[[Merriam Webster]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[lottery]] exists within the '''United States Virgin Islands''', the only US lottery outside the mainland and [[Puerto Rico]]. It was established in 1937 and became an independent agency of the territorial government in 1971.[https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-DOI-IGREPORTS-01-i-290/html/GPO-DOI-IGREPORTS-01-i-290.htm] The USVI is a member of the [[Multi-State Lottery Association]] (MUSL). It is the smallest US lottery to offer either [[Powerball]], [[Mega Millions]] or [[scratchcard]] games. The USVI Lottery is also a member of the [[Caribbean Lottery]], in which other islands, such as [[Sint Maarten]], [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], and [[Barbados]], participate. Minimum age to play the Virgin Islands Lottery is 18.

The lottery headquarters is in [[Charlotte Amalie, United States Virgin Islands|Charlotte Amalie]] on [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2973">[[Image:Westerglen AM transmitter, masts.jpg|right|thumb|The four masts at the Westerglen transmitting station]]
The '''Westerglen transmitting station''' is a facility for [[longwave]] and [[mediumwave]] broadcasting established in 1932 at Westerglen Farm, 3&amp;nbsp;km south west of [[Falkirk]], [[Stirlingshire]], [[Scotland]] ({{gbmapping|NS868773}}).

Four medium wave radio programmes are broadcast from the site on frequencies of 810, 909, 1089 and 1215&amp;nbsp;kHz and a long wave service on 198&amp;nbsp;kHz.

There are three guyed steel lattice [[mast radiator]]s on the site, which are insulated against ground. These carry combinations of the above services. There is a shorter fourth mast that carries non broadcast services.

One of the masts carries the long wave transmission in a synchronised group with the transmitters at [[Droitwich transmitting station|Droitwich]] and [[Burghead transmitting station|Burghead]] on the same frequency (until 1989 200&amp;nbsp;kHz, now 198&amp;nbsp;kHz). This mast is of guyed steel lattice construction with triangular cross-section and it carries a 'capacity hat', which increases the antenna's efficiency, at the top. 

The site is owned and operated by [[Arqiva]].

==Transmissions==
A number of items in the BBC Radio 4 schedule are carried on the longwave frequency only: these include Yesterday In Parliament at 0835&amp;ndash;0900 on Tuesdays to Fridays, [[The Daily Service]] at 0945&amp;ndash;1000 on Mondays to Fridays, the [[Shipping Forecast]] at 1201&amp;ndash;1204 daily and 1754&amp;ndash;1757 on Mondays to Fridays, and ''[[Test Match Special]]'' during international cricket games.

A number of Programs on [[BBC Radio Scotland]] are different on Medium wave compared to the FM schedule as well.

The medium wave broadcast is strong enough to be heard as far south as [[Staffordshire]] at certain times of the day.

'''The Women's Media Centre of Cambodia''' ({{lang-km|មណ្ឌលព័ត៌មានស្ត្រីកម្ពុជា}}), commonly known as WMC is a Cambodian non-governmental, non profit media organization.  WMC delivers national awareness and informative programs on a diverse range of issues affecting contemporary Cambodia, with a special focus on the roles and rights of Cambodian women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmc.org.kh/images/stories/Publication/Annual%20Report%202009.pdf Annual Report 2009-A Step Further][http://wmc.org.kh/images/Files/pdf/Four_Year_Impact_Evaluation_Eng_.pdf Four Year Impact Evaluation 2006-2009][http://wmc.org.kh/images/Files/pdf/WMC%20Annual%20Report-2008.pdf Annual Report 2008-Innovative for Change][http://wmc.org.kh/images/Files/pdf/5Years_Strategic_Plan.pdf Strategic Plan 2005-2009][http://wmc.org.kh/images/Files/pdf/FM102%20National%20Survey%20Report%20to%20Donors%20and%20Partners%202006.pdf FM 102 National Radio Survey Final Report]&lt;/ref&gt; The centre is best known for its radio channel ''Women's Radio, FM102 or FM102 (វិទ្យុស្ត្រី អេហ្វអឹម ១០២)''.

==Background==

During the UN-backed 1993 elections in Cambodia, a coalition of women formed the Cambodian Women's Committee for Non-Violence and the Election (CWCNVE). Their mission was to increase the participation of women in the democratic processes of voting and drafting the constitution. In collaboration with United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ([[UNTAC]]),and with  CWCNVE launched advocacy and media campaigns and produced radio programmes about voting. They collaborated with the NGO MediaTies to train a group of women in video production skills in order to document the election from a non-partisan perspective.

The momentum continued during the drafting of the Constitution of Cambodia. Through workshops, they gathered ideas from rural women, and presented them to the Constituent Assembly. One outcome of those workshops was the production of a seven-minute video. It was called 'The Rights of Women To Be Guaranteed' and was broadcast nationally as the Constitution was being drafted.&lt;/p align&gt;

Some of the coalition members recognized the need to continue to promote the rights of women even after the elections and UNTAC. They recognized the power of the media in promoting and protecting these rights as well as raising pressing development issues in the country. This core group of women went on to become the founders of the Women's Media Centre of Cambodia, and officially established it as a non-profit, non-governmental organization in January 1995.

Since 1995 ‘Women's Media Centre of Cambodia’ (WMC) continues acknowledging the power of media in promoting social change in Cambodian society. WMC is committed towards promoting gender equity, women's empowerment, and raising gender awareness in Cambodian society by discussing and bringing different issues that are often being not discussed openly and considered less important by various stakeholders. We have given voice and tried to unfold hidden and untold stories by discussing issues of developmental debates of decentralization and poverty together covering the issues like [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]], trafficking, elections and [[domestic violence]]. WMC encourages promoting inclusive and optimistic media environment equally to all of its members and to the Cambodian community.&lt;ref&gt;http://wmc.org.kh/index.php/about-us/wwa&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's radio, FM102MHZ==
[[Image:fm102-station.jpg|thumb|alt=WMC Radio Station|WMC Radio Station in Phnom Penh]]

Women's Radio FM 102 (Khmer: វិទ្យុស្ត្រីអេហ្វអឹម ១០២) produces educational radio programs designed for all sectors of Cambodian society, especially women in rural areas.

We potentially reach out to 75 percent of the population through a 10&amp;nbsp;kW antenna located in Phnom Penh, four relay stations in [[Kampong Thom Province|Kampong Thom]] province, [[Svay Rieng Province|Svay Rieng]] province, [[Battambang Province|Battambang]] province, and [[Kratie Province|Kratie]] province and via extensive partner radio networks throughout the country.

[[Radio Free Asia]] rated Women's Radio FM 102 as the most popular radio station in Cambodia in 2010. The Cambodian Sentinel Survey carried out by [[BBC World Service]] Trust from 2007 to 2009 consistently rated Women's Radio, FM 102 as one of the top two leading radio stations in Cambodia. Unlike the other leading stations, Women's Radio FM 102 is more popular with female audiences than men.

Women's Radio FM 102 does not advertise spots promoting tobacco, alcohol, cosmetic and a few other items which may cause health concern to consumers.

==TV Unit==

[[Image:wmc-redsky.jpg|thumb|alt=TV team is shooting for the drama "មេឃក្រហម-Red Sky"|TV team is shooting for the drama "មេឃក្រហម-Red Sky"]]

WMC does not have its own TV Channel, but it has a TV unit which cooperates with local and international NGOs to produce television programs on social issues in Cambodia. This unit also produces weekly TV dramas, comedies and documentaries, which explore pressing social issues in the country. WMC does not own a TV station; thus, its programs are broadcast on SEA (South East Asia) TV, TVK (National Television—Television Kampuchea) and CTN (Cambodian Television Network) and through contact provinces, which enables the programs to be available to the general public.

The TV unit researches and examines “hot topics” in Cambodia and produces and broadcasts high-quality weekly TV programs as well as Edutainment Videos in response to these topics. Through popular television genres of drama, comedy, documentaries, and vox-pop, WMC positively impacts national audiences by covering the following topics;

:* Violence against women and children: anti-domestic violence, anti-sexual trafficking, prevention of rape, drug and child labor;
:* Human rights issues, including women’s rights, gender and the law relating to women and children;
:* Family and community development;
:* Health, birth control and spacing, maternal health;
:* Education, advocating the importance of children’s education; and
:* Women’s rights in community development;

In March 2006, the TV unit was selected by the Women's Film Festival Committee in Paris, to screen a WMC drama called "Live" which focused on human trafficking of Cambodian women. This was a huge achievement for WMC.

To broaden the TV unit's capacity to produce more educational programs on demand, WMC has two TV teams, the weekly TV team (WTV) and the edutainment video team (ETV), respectively. Both teams of TV unit are managed by women. Key members of these teams including manager, editor, script writers, camera operators are also women. Most of the men involved in the teams are to help in manual work.

==Mobile Broadcasting Units==
[[Image:wmc-mbu.jpg|thumb|alt=Villagers are watching WMC programs through the MBU in Ouddor Mean Chey province in 2008|Villagers are watching WMC programs through the MBU in Ouddor Mean Chey province in 2008]]

WMC launched its first Mobile Broadcasting Units (MBUs) in 2002 to educate and inform rural communities residing in “media black spots” across Cambodia where mainstream broadcast signal could not reach or the communities have no electricity and lack financial means to purchase televisions or radios.

On average, each MBU viewing attracts 300 villagers, of which 50 percent are women. Using LCD projector, DVD player, wide screen and speakers, MBUs broadcast the radio programs and TV programs at popular meeting places in the community. This usually takes place in the evening after working hours. MBU facilitators also effectively engage the audience by discussing about the key messages of the programs through question and answer activities. This reinforces the key messages and encourages the community to carry out the advocated “call to action”. Relevant learning materials, such as posters, brochures and fliers to reinforce messages are also provided.
