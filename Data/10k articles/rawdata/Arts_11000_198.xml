{{italic title}}
'''''A Philosophical View of Reform''''' is a major prose work by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] written in 1819-20 and first published in 1920 by [[Oxford University Press]]. The political essay is Shelley's longest prose work.

==Analysis==

Shelley composed ''A Philosophical View of Reform'' between November, 1819 and 20 May 1820, meant to address political developments in England at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Sandy, Mark. "A Philosophical View of Reform". ''The Literary Encyclopedia''. First published 21 March 2002 [http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=7042, accessed 20 July 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; He advocated non-violence and a moderate response to the repressive measures imposed by the British government. One of the events he addressed was the [[Peterloo Massacre]], which occurred on 16 August 1819, in St. Peter's Field near Manchester, where a peaceful demonstration seeking parliamentary reform was attacked by militia.

The bookseller [[Richard Carlile]] had been found guilty of blasphemy by a jury in November, 1819 for printing an edition of ''[[The Age of Reason]]'' (1794-6) by [[Thomas Paine]]. The “Six Acts” had been promulgated in December which placed restrictions on public gatherings and freedom of the press.

It was during this unstable political period in England in late 1819 when Shelley started writing ''A Philosophical View of Reform''. Shelley told John and [[Maria Gisborne]] on 6 November: "I have deserted the odorous gardens of literature to journey across the great sandy desert of Politics."

Shelley proposed five reforms:&lt;ref&gt;Ripley, Brian. "Percy Bysshe Shelley's 'A Philosophical View of Reform'": www.shelley.235.ca/&lt;/ref&gt;

#abolish the national debt. 
#disband the standing army. 
#abolish sinecures. 
#abolish tithes, and make all religions, all forms of opinion regarding the origin and government of the universe, equal under the law. 
#make justice inexpensive, certain, and speedy, and extend the institution of juries to every possible occasion of jurisprudence.

Shelley opposed revolution, advocating instead gradual change through non-violence. He argued that individual and institutional reform went hand in hand. He maintained that poets, writers, and philosophers would stimulate reforms of the social institutions that would benefit everyone in society.

Shelley informed his publisher [[Charles Ollier]] on 19 December 1819 that he sought ''A Philosophical View of Reform'' "to be an instructive and readable book, appealing from the passions to the reason of men", informing him that he would not finish it "this season".

On 26 May 1820 he asked [[James Henry Leigh Hunt|Leigh Hunt]] if he could find a publisher for the work: "Do you know any bookseller who wd publish for me an octavo volume entitled 'A philosophical View of Reform'. It is boldly but temperately written – &amp; I think readable – It is intended for a kind of standard book for the philosophical reformers."

[[Mary Shelley]] had a transcript made of the manuscript with plans to publish the work. The political essay remained unpublished, however, until 1920 when it appeared for the first time in print in an edition published by [[Humphrey Milford]], Oxford University Press, with an introduction and appendix by [[Thomas William Rolleston]].

'''Anjumani-shuara''' (Persian - "Poets council") was a literary council of the 19th century in [[Azerbaijan]].
It was first held by Sheykhali khan Kangarli in 1831 in [[Ordubad]]. From 1870-80 the council was led by Haji agha Fagir Ordubadi. Later this mission was obliged to Mohammad Taghi Sidgi. The council’s activity operated with different intervals and there were lots of well-known writers and poets. After the death of Fagir and shifting of Sidgi in [[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhchivan]] the council was weakened and suspended its activities in 1890-1895.&lt;ref&gt;http://azerbaijans.com/content_1787_en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Another Way''''' ({{lang-hu|Egymásra nézve}}), is a 1982 [[cinema of Hungary|Hungarian film]] directed by [[Károly Makk]] about an affair between two women. It is based on a semi-autobiographical novella ''Another Love'' (''Törvényen belül'') by [[Erzsébet Galgóczi]] (1930–89), who co-wrote the screenplay with Makk. It won the [[Best Actress Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actress]] award at the [[1982 Cannes Film Festival]] for [[Jadwiga Jankowska-Cieślak]] and was nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1579/year/1982.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Another Way |accessdate=2009-06-09|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
At Christmas 1958 in Hungary, the body of Éva Szalánczky, an apparent murder victim, is recovered from a forest. In hospital, Livia Horváth, bandaged around her neck is recuperating, and is told that she will be unable to live her life as before; the reason is not made explicit.

The lesbian Éva, already known to the authorities for her private life,  begins a new job as a journalist at ''The Truth'', a weekly periodical, and meets the married Livia when the two women share an office. The attraction is immediate, but Livia is initially resistant. Late at night, while kissing in darkness on a park bench, the women are discovered by a policeman, who warns Livia that her husband and employer will be informed if she is found in the same uncompromising position again. Éva is arrested, but soon released.

At a collective farm, Éva finds the authorities have blocked an attempt at a more democratic way of organising their cooperative venture. Her understanding editor, a supporter of the short-lived government of the recently executed [[Imre Nagy]], refuses to publish the article, and she resigns before she is sacked. Éva and Livia have a brief affair. The previously mild Dönci Horváth, an army officer, shoots his wife while she in the bath after her confession of love for Éva. Livia survives and her husband is imprisoned for the offence. At the hospital, Livia rejects Éva, who then journeys to the countryside. At night, Éva is challenged to stop walking by border guards, but is shot dead when she fails to do.

The '''Apollo 11 missing tapes''' were those that were recorded from [[Apollo 11]]'s [[slow-scan television]] (SSTV) telecast in its raw format on [[telemetry]] data tape at the time of the first [[moon landing]] in 1969 and subsequently lost. The data tapes were recorded as a backup in case the live television broadcasts failed for any reason.

In order to broadcast the SSTV transmission on standard television, NASA ground receiving stations performed real-time [[scan conversion]] to the [[NTSC]] television format. The moonwalk's converted video signal was broadcast live around the world on July 21, 1969 (2:56 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). At the time, the NTSC broadcast was recorded on many [[videotape]]s and [[kinescope]] films. Many of these low-quality recordings remain intact. The SSTV signal was recorded on telemetry data tapes as a backup in the event that real-time conversion and broadcast failed. As the real-time broadcast worked, was shown and widely recorded, preservation of the backup video was not deemed a priority in the years immediately following the mission.{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}} In the early 1980s NASA's Landsat program was facing a severe data tape shortage and it is likely the tapes were erased and reused at this time.{{sfnp|Nafzger|2009|p=13}}

A team of retired NASA employees and contractors tried to find the tapes in the early 2000s but was unable to do so. The search was sparked when several still photographs appeared in the late 1990s that showed the superior-looking raw SSTV transmission on ground station monitors. The research team conducted a multi-year investigation in the hopes of finding the most pristine and detailed video images of the moonwalk. If copies of the original SSTV format tapes were to be found, more modern digital technology could make a higher-quality conversion, yielding better images than those originally seen. The researchers concluded that the tapes containing the raw unprocessed Apollo 11 SSTV signal were [[Bulk eraser|erased]] and reused by NASA in the early 1980s, following standard procedure at the time.{{sfnp|Perlman|2009|}}{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}}{{sfnp|Sarkissian|2006|p=14}} 

Although the researchers never found the telemetry tapes they were looking for, they did discover the best visual quality NTSC videotapes as well as [[Super 8 mm film|super 8 movie film]] taken of a video monitor in Australia, showing the SSTV transmission before it was converted. These visual elements were processed in 2009, as part of a NASA approved restoration project of the first moonwalk. At a 2009 news conference in Washington, D.C., the research team released its findings regarding the tapes' disappearance. They also partially released newly enhanced footage obtained during the search. [[Lowry Digital]] completed the full moonwalk restoration project in late 2009.

[[Apollo 11]] was the spaceflight that landed the first two people on the Moon. [[Neil Armstrong]] became the first person to step onto the lunar surface on July 21, 1969, at 02:56 UTC; [[Buzz Aldrin]] joined him about 20 minutes later.

Only limited radio bandwidth was available to transmit the video signal from the lunar landings, which needed to be [[multiplexing|multiplexed]] with other communication and telemetry channels beamed from the [[Lunar Module]], back to Earth.{{sfnp|Coan|1973|pp=1–2}} Therefore, Apollo 11's moonwalk video was transmitted from the [[Apollo TV camera]] in a monochrome [[slow-scan television|SSTV]] format at 10 frames per second (fps) with 320 lines of resolution, [[progressive scan|progressively scanned]].{{sfnp|Lebar|Hoffman|1967|p=3}} These SSTV signals were received by [[radio telescopes]] at [[Parkes Observatory]], the [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone]] [[tracking station]], and [[Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station|Honeysuckle Creek]] tracking station.{{sfnp|MacKellar|2005|p=2}} The camera's video format was incompatible with existing [[NTSC]], [[PAL]], and [[SECAM]] broadcast television standards. It needed to be converted before it could be shown on broadcast television networks. This live [[scan conversion|conversion]] was crude, essentially using a video camera pointing at a high-quality 10-inch TV monitor.

===Video signal processing===
Since the camera's scan rate was much lower than the approximately 30 fps for NTSC video,{{refn|group="Note"|For the purposes of clarity and simplicity in this article, 60 fields and 30 frames per second are used. NTSC actually runs at 59.94 fields per second, and 29.97 frames per second. Two interlaced fields create one complete video frame.}} the television standard used in North America at the time, a real-time [[scan conversion]] was needed to be able to show its images on a regular TV set. NASA selected a scan converter manufactured by [[RCA]] to convert the black-and-white SSTV signals from the Apollo 7, 8, 9, and 11 missions.{{sfnp|Steven-Boniecki|2010|p=129}}

When the Apollo TV camera radioed its images, the ground stations received its raw unconverted SSTV signal and split it into two branches. One signal branch was sent unprocessed to a fourteen-track analog [[data]] [[tape recorder]] where it was recorded onto fourteen-inch diameter reels of one-inch-wide [[analog signal|analog]] [[Magnetic tape data storage|magnetic data tapes]] at {{nowrap|120 inches}} per second.{{sfnp|Sarkissian|2006|p=8}} The other raw SSTV signal branch was sent to the RCA scan converter where it would be processed into an NTSC broadcast television signal.{{sfnp|Sarkissian|2006|p=8}}

The RCA scan converter operated on an optical conversion principle.{{sfnp|Sarkissian|2006|p=6}} The conversion process started when the signal was sent to a high-quality 10-inch video monitor where a conventional RCA TK-22 television camera—using the NTSC broadcast standard of 525 scanned lines [[interlaced video|interlaced]] at 30 fps—merely re-photographed its screen. The monitor had persistent phosphors, that acted as a primitive [[framebuffer]].{{sfnp|Wood|2005|pp=5–6}} An analog disk recorder, based on the [[Ampex#HS-100 .26 HS-200 .22slo-mo.22 disc recorder|Ampex HS-100 model]], was used to record the first field from the camera.{{sfnp|Wood|2005|pp=5–6}} It then fed that field, and an appropriately time-delayed copy of the first field, to the NTSC Field Interlace Switch (encoder). The combined original and copied fields created the first full 525-line interlaced frame and the signal was then sent to Houston.{{sfnp|Wood|2005|pp=5–6}} The disk recorder repeated this sequence five more times, until the camera imaged the next SSTV frame.{{sfnp|Wood|2005|pp=5–6}} The converter then repeated the whole process with each new frame downloaded from space in real-time.{{sfnp|Sarkissian|2006|p=6}} In this way, the RCA converter produced the extra 20 frames per second needed to produce flicker-free images to the world's television broadcasters.{{sfnp|Steven-Boniecki|2010|p=129}}

This live conversion was crude compared to early-21st-century electronic digital conversion techniques. Image degradation was unavoidable with this system as the monitor and camera's optical limitations significantly lowered the original SSTV signal's [[contrast (vision)|contrast]], [[brightness]] and [[Display resolution|resolution]]. If the scan converter's settings were incorrectly set, as they were at the Goldstone station during the first few minutes of Apollo 11's moonwalk, the negative impact on the image could be very obvious.{{sfnb|Wood|2005|pp=22–24}} When Armstrong first came down the Lunar Module's ladder, he was barely visible because the contrast and the vertical phase were not set correctly by the scan converter operator.{{sfnb|Wood|2005|pp=22–24}} The video seen on home television sets was further degraded by the very long and noisy analog transmission path.{{sfnp|Von Baldegg|2012|}} The converted signal was sent by satellite from the three receiving ground stations to Houston, Texas. Then the network [[Press pool|pool feed]] was sent by microwave relay to New York, where it was broadcast live to the United States and the world.{{sfnp|Steven-Boniecki|2010|p=130}} Because all of these links were analog, each one added additional noise and distortion to the signal.{{sfnp|Steven-Boniecki|2010|p=130}}

===NTSC broadcast tapes===
This low-quality optical conversion of the Apollo 11 moonwalk video images—made with a TV camera taking pictures of a video monitor—is what was widely recorded in real-time onto [[kinescope]] film and NTSC broadcast-quality [[Quadruplex videotape|2-inch quadruplex videotape]]. Recordings of this conversion were not lost and have long been available to the public (along with much higher quality video from later [[Apollo program|Apollo]] missions). If the one inch data tapes, with the raw unprocessed Apollo 11 SSTV signals on them, were to be found, modern digital technology would allow for significantly better conversion and processing.{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}}{{sfnp|MacKellar|2009|}} The quality would be similar to what a few technicians and others saw at SSTV receiving ground stations before it got converted to NTSC.{{sfnp|MacKellar|2005|}}

In 2005, an amateur [[Super 8 film|Super 8]] movie with about 15 minutes of Apollo 11 images was rediscovered. The footage had been taken by Ed von Renouard at Honeysuckle Creek tracking station during or immediately after the Apollo 11 moonwalk. The images show mainly the scan converted monitor and briefly the slow scan monitor.{{sfnp|MacKellar|2008|}} This is some of the best quality recording of brief segments of the Apollo 11 moonwalk available.{{sfnp|MacKellar|2009|}} The images are available on DVD.{{sfnp|MacKellar|2006|}}

[[File:Apollo11D.jpg|thumb|right|The degraded image after the SSTV scan conversion]]

News that these analog data tapes were missing emerged on August 5, 2006 when the printed and online versions of ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' published a story with the title ''One giant blunder for mankind: how NASA lost moon pictures''.{{sfnp|Macey|2006a|}} The missing tapes were among over 700 boxes of magnetic data tapes recorded throughout the Apollo program which have not been found.{{sfnp|Sarkissian|2006|pp=11–12}}  On August 16, 2006 NASA announced its official search saying, "The original tapes may be at the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] ... or at another location within the NASA archiving system", "NASA engineers are hopeful that when the tapes are found they can use today's digital technology to provide a version of the moonwalk that is much better quality than what we have today."{{sfnp|Macey|2006b|}} NASA also had ongoing research reasons for finding these higher resolution tapes, as the [[Constellation program]] then planned shared some similar tasks with the original Apollo program.{{sfnp|Wheeler|2006|}}

The Goddard Center's Data Evaluation Laboratory has the only known surviving piece of equipment which can read the missing tapes and was set to be closed in October 2006, causing some fear that, even if the tapes were later found, there would be no ready way to read and copy them.{{sfnp|Hansen|2006}} However, equipment that could read the tapes was maintained.{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}}

On November 1, 2006 [[Cosmos (magazine)|''Cosmos'' magazine]] reported that some NASA telemetry tapes from the Apollo project era had been found in a small marine science laboratory within the main physics building at [[Curtin University]] in [[Perth|Perth, Western Australia]]. One of these tapes was sent to NASA for analysis.{{sfnp| Amalfi |2006|}} It carried no video but did show that if any of the tapes are ever found, data could likely be read from them.{{sfnp|Nafzger|2009|p=6}}

== NASA news conference ==
NASA held a news conference at the [[Newseum]], in Washington, D.C. regarding the missing tapes on July 16, 2009 – the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11's launch from Cape Kennedy.{{sfnp|Perlman|2009|}} The multinational research team looking into the missing tapes – mostly retired engineers who had worked on the original broadcast in 1969 — was represented at the event by Richard Nafzger from the Goddard Space Flight Center, and Stanley Lebar, the former lead engineer at Westinghouse that developed the Apollo Lunar Camera and the Apollo Color Camera.{{sfnp|Von Baldegg|2012|}} They concluded that the data tapes – with the SSTV signal – were shipped from Australia to Goddard and then routinely erased and reused a few years later.{{sfnp|Perlman|2009|}} Australian backup tapes were also erased after Goddard received the reels,{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}} following the procedures established by NASA.{{sfnp|Sarkissian|2006|p=14}} The SSTV signal was recorded on telemetry data tapes mostly as a backup in case the real-time conversion and broadcast around the world failed. Since the real-time broadcast conversion worked, and was widely recorded on both videotape and [[kinescope|film]], the backup video was not deemed important at the time.{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}} In the early 1980s, NASA's Landsat program was facing a severe data tape shortage and it is likely that during this period the tapes were erased and reused.{{sfnp|Nafzger|2009|p=13}}

There was also documentation that the Apollo 11 moonwalk SSTV was recorded at the Parkes, Australia facility on modified Ampex 2-inch helical scan VTRs.{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}}{{sfnp|Nafzger|2009|p=14}} The VTRs were modified by Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Labs to record 320-line slow-scan video directly to the videotape without converting it.{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}}{{sfnp|Nafzger|2009|p=13}}  It was confirmed that these tapes were shipped to Johns Hopkins University, but could not be found by the search team.{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}}

Nafzger stated that they did find several post-conversion copies of the broadcast that were higher quality than what was previously seen by the public.{{sfnp|Perlman|2009|}} Their findings included: a videotape recorded in Sydney after the conversion but before the satellite transmission around the world; videotape from [[CBS News]] archives (direct from NASA, without commentary); and kinescopes at [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Johnson Space Center]].{{sfnp|Perlman|2009|}} At the news conference, it was mentioned that Lowry Digital would complete enhancing and restoring the tapes.{{sfnp|Perlman|2009|}} Mike Inchalik, president of Lowry Digital, mentioned that they would only restore the video and not remove defects (such as reflections that looked like flag poles) that their software could remove.{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}} A few short clips were shown at the news conference, showing their improved quality.{{sfnp|Perlman|2009|}} NASA released some partially restored samples on their website after the news conference.{{sfnp|Jacobs|Hess|2009|}} The full restoration of the footage, about three hours long, was completed in December 2009.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Some other footage from Australian ground station feeds showing SSTV video of Armstrong's descent and first steps surfaced through John Sarkissian's efforts.{{sfnp|SPACE.com Staff|2010|}} Highlights of this fully enhanced video were shown to the public for the first time at the Australian Geographic Society Awards on October 6, 2010, where [[Buzz Aldrin]] was the guest of honor.{{sfnp|Barry|2010|}}{{sfnp|AG Staff|2010|}}

'''''Aurora Triumphans''''' ({{lang-la|Triumphant Aurora}}) is a painting by [[Evelyn De Morgan]], featuring the Roman goddess of dawn [[Aurora (mythology)|Aurora]], that breaks the shackles of night. Aurora lies naked in the lower right corner, covered with carefully draped ropes of pink roses. Taking up two-thirds of the painting, there are three red-winged angels with trumpets and gold [[tunic]]s. Set in opposition to Aurora, in the lower left corner is a dark-robed Night, who swirls away a black cloak. In 1886 the painting was exhibited at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]] in London.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The flowers strewn around Aurora and the pale glow of her naked body are set in opposition to the shadowy drapery of Night. Aurora's frontal, open pose reverses the anonymity of Night, who is turned away from the viewer.
The painting currently belongs to the [[Russell-Cotes Museum]] in Bournemouth. Merton Russell-Cotes' son Herbert bought it for the museum in around 1922 thinking that it was a [[Edward Burne-Jones|Burne-Jones]] original after an unscrupulous art dealer had painted over the signature with Burne-Jones' initials to get a higher price.

According to art historian Elise Lawton Smith, Aurora's "lethargic pose ... may signify her transitional state between night/matter and light/spirit. She will move beyond torpor toward a new energy, as heralded by the three angels blowing their trumpets. Thus her power (or ''triumph'', as suggested by the title) derives not from her mythological status, but from her role as a spiritualist metaphor."&lt;ref name="Smith2002"/&gt;

'''Auður Jónsdóttir''' (born 30 March 1973)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Auður Jónsdóttir {{!}} Literature Web |url=https://bokmenntaborgin.is/en/literature-web/author/audur-jonsdottir |website=City of literature UNESCO |accessdate=25 June 2018 |language=is-IS |date=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the most accomplished authors writing in Icelandic today. Her novels have aroused interest in Iceland as well as abroad for their rare blend of incisive candor and humor. She won the [[Icelandic Literary Prize]] for '''The People in the Basement''' and the Icelandic Women’s Literature Prize for '''Secretaries to the Spirits'''. Both of these novels were nominated for the [[Nordic Council's Literature Prize]].

Auður's debut novel, '''Bliss''' (Stjórnlaus Lukka), was nominated for the [[Icelandic Literary Prize]] in 1998. Since then her output has included further novels, as well as books for children and teenagers, most notably Skrýtnastur er maður sjálfur (One self is the strangest of all, 2002), a portrait of her grandfather, the Nobel prize-winning author Halldor Laxness.
The People in the Basement (Fólkið í kjallaranum) won the 2004 [[Icelandic Literary Prize]] followed by a nomination for [[Nordic Council's Literature Prize]] in 2006. It came out and was very well received in Denmark and Sweden in the same year.

'''Deposit''' (Tryggðarpantur) was published in Reykjavik in November 2006 and was nominated to the [[Icelandic Literary Prize]]. It came out in Denmark the year after.
Wintersun (Vetrarsól), was published by btb Random House (Germany) as "Jenseits des Meeres liegt die ganze Welt" in 2011. It harvested great reviews in Der Spiegel and Hamburger Abendblatt among others. It was subsequently published by Querido (Netherlands) in 2012.

In 2009 Auður worked at the [[Reykjavik City Theater]] as an in-house writer for one year resulting in a play being adapted from '''The People in the Basement''' in the following year. The show was a huge success with critics and audience alike and Auður won the Icelandic Theatre awards (Griman) for the adaption from the book along with Olafur Egilsson.
Secretaries to the Spirits (Ósjálfrátt) published in 2012, was the best selling Icelandic fine literature fiction of the Christmas season. It won the Fjöruverðlaun (Women's literary award) and was nominated for the [[Icelandic Literary Prize]] as well as the [[Nordic Council's Literature Prize]]. The publishing rights were sold to btb Random House (Germany), Tiderne Skifter (Denmark) and Presse de la Cité (France).

Auður latest novel, '''Grand Mal''' (Stóri skjálfti), was published last autumn in Reykjavík. It became Auður's most successful novel to date and gathered a huge following among Icelandic readers of all ages, strengthening Auður's position as an important writers of her generation.

The People In The Basement, Deposit and Grand Mal are now all being adapted for the silver screen.
Other work by Auður includes international news articles, essays and two books for children with reading disabilities published by The National Centre for Educational Materials. Auður now divides her time between Berlin and Reykjavik with her family.

[[File:Butuan Ivory Seal.jpg|right|thumb|The actual image of the ivory seal housed at the [[National Museum of the Philippines]].]]
{{History of the Philippines}}
The '''Butuan Ivory Seal'''  or '''BIS''' ({{lang-fil|Garing Pantatak ng Butuan}}; {{lang-ceb|Garing Patik sa Butuan}}), is an ivory stamp or seal stamp or a [[privy seal]] associated with a Rhinoceros Ivory Tusk {{huh?|date=October 2018}}, dated 9th–12th century, was found in Libertad, [[Butuan]] in [[Agusan del Norte]] in southern [[Philippines]]. Inscribed on the seal is the word ''Butban'' in stylized [[Kawi script|Kawi]]. The script has a similarity to the [[Baybayin|Tagalog script]]. ''Butban'', was presumed to stand for Butwan or Butuan, since the letters “b” and “w” were frequently interchanged. The discovery of the seal proved the theory that pre-colonial Filipinos, or at least in coastal areas, used seals on paper. Before the discovery of the seal, it was only thought that ancient Filipinos used bamboo, metal, bark, and leaves for writing. The presence of paper documents in the classical era of the Philippines is also backed by a research of Otley Beyer stating that Spanish friars 'boasted' about burning ancient Philippine documents with ''suyat'' inscriptions, one of the reasons why ancient documents from the Philippines are almost non-existent in present time. The ivory seal is now housed at the [[National Museum of the Philippines]].&lt;ref name="nationalmuseum.gov.ph"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationalmuseum.gov.ph/nationalmuseumbeta/Collections/Archaeo/Seal.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-02-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324035749/http://nationalmuseum.gov.ph/nationalmuseumbeta/Collections/Archaeo/Seal.html# |archive-date=2017-03-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
{{Further|Rajahnate of Butuan}}
Another archaeological piece with ancient inscription, the Butuan Ivory Seal was recovered in the 1970s by pot hunters in a prehistoric shell midden site in Ambangan, Libertad, Butuan City in Agusan del Norte. Made of [[rhinoceros]] ivory [[tusk]], the object could have been used to stamp documents or [[Barter|goods]] during trading.&lt;ref name="filipiknow.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filipiknow.net/national-museum-of-the-philippines/|title=12 Astonishing Artifacts You Didn't Know You Could Find At The National Museum|date=5 June 2015|website=Filipiknow.net|accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ivory seal as well as other archaeological materials recovered in Ambangan archaeological sites are proof that [[Rajahnate of Butuan]] was an important trading center whose official seal marked the source of commodities it produced and exported.&lt;ref name="filipiknow.net"/&gt;

{| style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;"

| &lt;small&gt;The "[[Butuan]] Ivory Seal" (The left hand image is the seal itself; the right hand image shows how a print from the seal would appear.)&lt;br&gt;The Kawi lettering reads "Butban".  The three square seal style characters are BA, TA and NA; the leftward curl underneath BA is the /u/ vowel diacritic, changing the syllable to BU; the small heart-shaped character under TA is the subscript conjunct form of BA which also removes the default /a/ vowel from TA; the large curl to the upper right is the Kawi [[virama]], which indicates the default /a/ vowel on NA is not pronounced. The three blocks of characters together read "[Bu][Tba][N-]. In both [[Balinese script]] and [[Javanese language|Javanese script]], which are descended from Kawi, the word is spelled in a very similar pattern, using a similar /u/ diacritic, conjunct form for B, and virama. &lt;/small&gt;
|}

==Dating==
Dated 1002 A.D., the seal could have been used for documentation in trading, Butuan was the center of trade and commerce  in North eastern [[Mindanao]] since 10th century.&lt;ref name="nationalmuseum.gov.ph"/&gt;

There were other notable discoveries like the Ivory Seal and the [[Butuan Silver Paleograph|Silver Paleograph]], Gold and tools for gold processing of ornaments have also been recovered from a village site Over a hundred clay crucibles and tools for the processing of gold items were discovered in the area, leading to the conclusion that an extensive gold ornaments industry was located in these areas as far back as a thousand years ago. Altogether, these data demonstrate that Butuan was a thriving international trading port a thousand years ago. This site has a tremendous historical impact in the [[Asia]]n region.

Left to right Abstract / Bougouni / Southern region style, Vertical/ Segu/ Northern region style, the Horizontal / Bamako / Northern region style, and the Abstract / Sikasso region style.]]
[[File:Chiwara Chicago sculpture.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Two Chiwara at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. Female (left) and male Vertical styles.]]

A '''Chiwara''' (also '''Chi wara''', '''Ci Wara''', or '''Tyi Wara'''; {{lang-bm|ciwara}}; {{lang-fr|tchiwara}}) is a ritual object representing an [[antelope]], used by the [[Bambara people|Bambara]] ethnic group in [[Mali]]. The Chiwara initiation society uses Chiwara masks, as well as dances and rituals associated primarily with agriculture, to teach young Bamana men social values as well as agricultural techniques.

== Stylistic variations ==
Chiwara masks are categorized in three ways: [[Horizontal plane|horizontal]], [[vertical direction|vertical]], or abstract. In addition, Chiwara can be either male or female. Female Chiwara masks are denoted by the presence of a baby antelope and straight horns. Male Chiwara masks have bent horns and a [[phallus]]. The sex of a Chiwara mask is much clearer on horizontal and vertical masks while abstract masks tend to be difficult to classify.

The appearance of the Chiwara form varies greatly both by region and time produced. Specific master wood carvers also subtly modified the accepted (or even religiously mandated) local forms, forming a distinct "signature" or "school" of Chiwara figures.&lt;ref&gt;Allen Wardwell (November 1984) A Bambara Master Carver, ''African Arts'', '''18'''(1):pp83–84.&lt;/ref&gt;   These regional variations have been roughly assigned the stylistic categories above. Thus ''the [[Bougouni]] / Southern region style'' are an amalgam of several animal motifs combined in the same work, in an abstract style; ''the [[Bamako]] / Northern region style'' is usually of the horizontal style; ''the [[Ségou|Segu]]/ Northern region style'' (the heartland of the [[Bambara Empire]]) matches the vertical style with the unique "cut out" triangular body motif of the males. Other regional styles have been proposed, including ''the [[Sikasso]] region style'', with a thin, delicate, vertical form within almost human, snoutless face.&lt;ref&gt;See descriptions at  [http://www.quaibranly.fr/en/programmation/exhibitions/last-exhibitions/ciwara-african-chimeras/index.html Ciwara, African chimeras. Exhibition, Musée du quai Branly, Paris. 23 June – 17 December 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926235258/http://www.quaibranly.fr/en/programmation/exhibitions/last-exhibitions/ciwara-african-chimeras/index.html |date=26 September 2007 }}. and see the galleries at [http://www.hamillgallery.com/BAMANA/BamanaChiWara/BamanaChiWara.html Hamill Gallery:Bamana Chi Wara].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ceremonial usage==
In [[Bambara language|Bambara]], ''chi'' ''wara'' means ''laboring'' ''wild animal'',&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Salzhauer Axel, Nina Sobol Levent (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; and is a representation of Bambara [[Mythology|mythos]] about the creation of farming.

=== Mousso Koroni ===
While there are several versions of the story, the discovery of agriculture is credited to the hero Chi Wara, a half antelope, half human figure born from the union of the sky goddess Mousso Koroni and an earth spirit in the shape of a cobra. The Chi Wara came to earth to teach humans to sow crops, and thus is honored at both sowing and harvest festivals.

=== The Chi Wara figure ===
The Chi Wara itself is usually represented as a [[Roan Antelope]] with an almost human face, but also takes shapes of other creatures and emblems of farming. The hero descends from the sky goddess, and thus represents the sun, its body is often elongated and short legged to represent the [[aardvark]] who burrows into the earth like a farmer. Its high horns echo the stalks of [[millet]], and it stands on a dancer clad in a mass of [[raffia]] stalks to represent both flowing water and a bountiful harvest. The zig-zag patterns echo the movement of the sun across the sky, and the penis of the male figure stands low to the ground, fertilizing the earth.
The Chi Wara figures always appear as a male/female pair, combining the elements of fertility of humans with fertility of the earth. The female figure usually carries a young antelope on her back, and is said to represent human beings carried by the Chi Wara hero, as well as a newborn human carried on a mother's back.

===''chi wara ton''===
As farmers of the upper [[Niger river]] [[savanna]], the blessing of agriculture is of central importance to Bambara society. These traditions survive in part because the Bambara were one of the last cultures in the area to embrace [[Islam]], after the fall of the [[Bambara Empire]] in the late 19th century.
Bambara culture has traditionally had a strict set of age and caste cofraternities (''ton''/''jo''/''jow''), and the ''chi wara ton'' society is one of the more important. It gathers all young adult males of the ''Soli'' age group to work the fields at clearing, sowing and harvest, when the greatest number of laborers is needed. Secret teachings of the ''chi wara ton'' pass the needed skills for this work, upon which the very survival of the community depends.

The ''chi wara ton'' is also the only major Bambara society which includes both sexes. Women's labor is needed for agriculture, just as both sexes are needed for human reproduction.

=== Dance ===
The Chi Wara is always danced with each wooden figure attached to a basket on the dancer's head, and the body covered in a huge pile of raffia. Often the face is obscured with raffia that has been colored or decorated, and the dancer carries a long staff. The figures are always in one or more male/female pairs, with the female usually dancing behind the male, fanning him and spreading his powers into the gathered community. The Male figures leap to represent the antelope, and then scratch the earth with their staves or horns as the Chi Wara teaches humans to cultivate crops. In some communities the Mousso Koroni figure also appears.

== World influence ==
African sculptural forms became fashionable amongst European artists and collectors at the beginning of the Twentieth century, and the Chiwara, especially in its more abstract forms, became one of the icons of what Europeans called ''Primitive Art''. The artist [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] and collector [[Paul Guillaume]] published images of the Chiwara in their ''Sculptures nègres'' in 1917, while [[Picasso]], [[Braque]], and [[Les Fauves]] became fascinated with African sculpture and masks in general, and the Chiwara figure in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Some examples of French studies of African sculpture among the artists, critics, and collectors of Modern Art include: ''À propos d'art nègre'' by Guillaume Apollinaire; ''Opinions sur l'art nègre'' with contributions by Braque, [[Matisse]], and Picasso; ''Rencontre avec l'art nègre'' by [[Jean Laude]]; ''La Sculpture nègre et l'art moderne'' by Paul Guillaume; and  ''L'art nègre'' by [[Henri Clouzot]] and [[André Level]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A vertical, male, semi-abstracted Chiwara figure was included in the 1935 [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] exhibit ''African Negro Art'', and the ''Masterpieces of African Art'' at the [[Brooklyn Museum]] in 1954, (as well as shows in London&lt;ref&gt;The Sculptor [[Henry Moore]] singles out the Chiwara in a review of a 1951 London show.

'''''En attendant les hommes''''' is a 2007 documentary film by [[Katy Léna N'diaye]] about women [[muralist]]s in [[Oualata]], [[Mauritania]]. In this town on the far edge of the [[Sahara|Sahara desert]], three women practice traditional painting, and decorate the walls of the town. In a society apparently dominated by tradition, religion and men, these women unreservedly express themselves and comment freely on the relationship between men and women.&lt;ref name=Pialeprat&gt;{{cite web|last=Pialeprat|first=Sarah|title=En attendant les hommes de Katy Lena Ndiaye|url=http://www.cinergie.be/webzine/en_attendant_les_hommes_de_katy_lena_ndiaye|work=Cinergie|accessdate=18 March 2012|location=Belgium|date=Webzine n°122, December 2007|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Feminist literary criticism''' is [[literary criticism]] informed by [[feminist theory]], or more broadly, by the politics of [[feminism]]. It uses the principles and ideology of feminism to critique the language of literature. This school of thought seeks to analyze and describe the ways in which literature portrays the narrative of male domination by exploring the economic, social, political, and psychological forces embedded within literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/722/11/|title=Literary Theory and Schools of Criticism|publisher=[[Purdue OWL]]|accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This way of thinking and criticizing works can be said to have changed the way literary texts are viewed and studied, as well as changing and expanding the canon of what is commonly taught. It is used a lot in Greek myths.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Feminist Literary Criticism|last=Plain|first=Gill|last2=Sellers|first2=Susan|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, feminist literary criticism has sought to examine old texts within literary canon through a new lens. Specific goals of feminist criticism include both the development and discovery female tradition of writing, and rediscovering of old texts, while also interpreting symbolism of women's writing so that it will not be lost or ignored by the male point of view and resisting sexism inherent in the majority of mainstream literature. These goals, along with the intent to analyze women writers and their writings from a female perspective, and increase awareness of the sexual politics of language and style&lt;ref&gt;Tuttle, Lisa: Encyclopedia of feminism. Harlow: Longman 1986, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; were developed by [[Lisa Tuttle]] in the 1980s, and have since been adopted by a majority of feminist critics.

The history of feminist literary criticism is extensive, from classic works of nineteenth-century women authors such as [[George Eliot]] and [[Margaret Fuller]] to cutting-edge theoretical work in [[women's studies]] and [[gender studies]] by  "[[third-wave feminism|third-wave]]" authors.  Before the 1970s—in the [[first-wave feminism|first]] and [[second-wave feminism|second wave]]s of feminism— feminist literary criticism was concerned with women's authorship and the representation of women's condition within literature; in particular the depiction of fictional female characters. In addition, feminist literary criticism is concerned with the exclusion of women from the literary canon, with theorists such as Lois Tyson suggesting that this is because the views of women authors are often not considered to be universal ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Critical Theory: A User Friendly Guide 2nd Edition|last=Tyson|first=Lois|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=978-0-415-61617-1|location=270 Madison Avenue New York, NY 10016|pages=107, 108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, feminist criticism has been closely associated with the birth and growth of [[queer studies]]. Modern feminist literary theory seeks to understand both the literary portrayals and representation of both women and people in the queer community, expanding the role of a variety of identities and analysis within feminist literary criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Reader's Guide to Contemporary Literary Theory 3rd Edition|last=Raman|first=Selden|last2=Widdowson|first2=Peter|publisher=The University Press of Kentucky|year=1993|isbn=978-0813108162|location=Lexington, Kentucky|pages=238, 239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods employed==
Feminist scholarship has developed a variety of ways to unpack literature in order to understand its essence through a feminist lens. Scholars under the camp known as Feminine Critique sought to divorce literary analysis away from abstract diction-based arguments and instead tailored their criticism to more “grounded” pieces of literature (plot, characters, etc.) and recognize the perceived implicit misogyny of the structure of the story itself. Others schools of thought such as [[gynocriticism]]- which is considered a 'female' perspective on women's writings - uses a historicist approach to literature by exposing exemplary female scholarship in literature and the ways in which their relation to gender structure relayed in their portrayal of both fiction and reality in their texts. Gynocriticism was introduced during the time of second wave feminism. [[Elaine Showalter]] suggests that feminist critique is an “ideological, righteous, angry, and admonitory search for the sins and errors of the past,” and says gynocriticism enlists “the grace of imagination in a disinterested search for the essential difference of women’s writing.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lanser, Susan S. "Feminist Literary Criticism: How Feminist? How Literary? How Critical?." ''NWSA Journal'' 3.1 (1991): 3. ''Academic Search Complete''.&lt;/ref&gt;

More contemporary scholars attempt to understand the intersecting points of femininity and complicate our common assumptions about gender politics by accessing different categories of identity (race, class, sexual orientation, etc.) The ultimate goal of any of these tools is to uncover and expose patriarchal underlying tensions within novels and interrogate the ways in which our basic literary assumptions about such novels are contingent on female subordination. In this way, the accessibility of literature broadens to a far more inclusive and holistic population. Moreover, works that historically received little or no attention, given the historical constraints around female authorship in some cultures, are able to be heard in their original form and unabridged. This makes a broader collection of literature for all readers insofar as all great works of literature are given exposure without bias towards a gender influenced system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bcs.bedfordstmartins.com/virtualit/poetry/critical_define/crit_femin.html|title=Bedford / St. Martin's|publisher=|accessdate=29 January 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150901143656/http://bcs.bedfordstmartins.com/Virtualit/poetry/critical_define/crit_femin.html|archivedate=1 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women have also begun to employ anti-patriarchal themes to protest the historical censorship of literature written by women. The rise of decadent [[feminist literature]] in the 1990s was meant to directly challenge the sexual politics of the patriarchy. By employing a wide range of female [[sexual exploration]] and lesbian and queer identities by those like Rita Felski and Judith Bennet, women were able attract more attention about feminist topics in literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=398842d6-fc94-48bc-84be-1f4e5f7ea20c%40sessionmgr115&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=112|title=EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|publisher=|accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the development of more complex conceptions of gender and subjectivity and [[third-wave feminism]], feminist literary criticism has taken a variety of new routes, namely in the tradition of the [[Frankfurt School]]'s [[critical theory]], which analyzes how the dominant ideology of a subject influences societal understanding. It has also considered gender in the terms of [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]ian and [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]]ian [[psychoanalysis]], as part of the [[deconstruction]] of existing relations of power, and as a concrete political investment.&lt;ref name="Barry"&gt;Barry, Peter, 'Feminist Literary Criticism' in ''Beginning theory'' (Manchester University Press: 2002), {{ISBN|0-7190-6268-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The more traditionally central feminist concern with the representation and politics of women's lives has continued to play an active role in criticism. More specifically, modern feminist criticism deals with those issues related to the perceived intentional and unintentional patriarchal programming within key aspects of society including education, politics and the work force.

When looking at literature, modern feminist literary critics also seek ask how feminist, literary, and critical the critique practices are,with scholars such as Susan Lanser looking to improve both literature analysis and the analyzer's own practices to be more diverse.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==History and critics==
While the beginning of more mainstream feminist literary criticism is typically considered during second-wave feminism, there are multiple texts prior to that era that contributed greatly to the field. Feminist literary criticism can be traced back to medieval times, with some arguing that Geoffrey Chaucer’s Wife of Bath could be an example of early feminist literally critics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, the period considered First wave feminism also contributed extensively to literature and women's presence within it. For example,1929's [[A Room of One's Own]] by Virginia Woolf is undoubtedly considered one of these formative texts. In it, Woolf argues that in order to write creatively and be critically successful, a woman must be able to own her own space and financial stability. And though the basis of the plot is around a Woolf speaking at a conference for women's literature, she speculates that there is still a long way to go for women and so-called 'women's issues' in creative space, especially based on the differences in educational quality Woolf observed between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Room of One's Own|last=Woolf|first=Virginia|publisher=Martino Fine Books|year=2012|isbn=978-1614272779|location=Eastford, CT 06242|pages=17–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern feminist literary criticism finds most of its roots in the 1960s second-wave feminist movements. Beginning with the interrogation of male-centric literature that portrayed women in a demeaning and oppressed model, theorist such as Mary Ellman, Kate Millet and [[Germaine Greer]] challenged past imaginations of the feminine within literary scholarship. Within second-wave feminism, three phases can be defined: the feminine phase, the feminist phase, and the female phase. During the feminine phase, female writers adhered to male values. In the feminist phase, there was a theme of criticism of women's role in society. And in the female phase, it was now assumed that women's works were valid, and the works were less combative than in the feminist phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://writersinspire.org/content/feminist-approaches-literature|title=Feminist Approaches to Literature {{!}} Great Writers Inspire|website=writersinspire.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Susan Lanser suggested changing the name of feminist literary criticism to “critical literary feminism” to change the focus from the criticism to the feminism, and points out that writing such works requires “consciousness of political context.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In a similar vein, Elaine Showalter became a leading critic in the gynocritical method with her work ''A Literature of their Own'' in 1977. By this time, scholars were not only interested in simply demarcating narratives of oppression but also creating a literary space for past, present and future female literary scholars to substantiate their experience in a genuine way that appreciates the aesthetic form of their works.

Additionally, Black literary feminist scholars began to emerge, in the post-Civil Rights era of the United States, as a response to the masculine-centric narratives of Black empowerments began to gain momentum over female voices. Although not a ”critical” text, ''The Black Woman: An Anthology'', edited by Cade (1970) is seen as essential to the rise of Black literary criticism and theory. It’s compilation of poems, short stories and essays gave rise to new institutionally supported forms of Black literary scholarship. The literary scholarship also included began with the perception of Black female writers being under received relative to their talent. The [[Combahee River Collective]] released what is called one of the most famous pieces in Black literary scholarship known as "A Black Feminist Statement" (1977), which sought to prove that literary feminism was an important component to black female liberation.

In 1977 Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar published [[The Madwoman in the Attic]], an analysis of women's poetry and prose, and how it fits into the larger feminist literary canon. This publication has become a staple of feminist criticism and has expanded the realm of publications considered to be feminist works, especially in the 19th century. The book specifically argues that women have largely been considered in two distinct categories by men in academia, monsters or angels. Gilbert and Gubar argued that being trapped in these categories regulated women writers to specific areas of literature and writing, leaving the rest open only to men, and causing a distinct anxiety in women's writers to stay specifically within those categories or be ridiculed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Madwoman In the Attic 2nd Edition|last=Gilbert|first=Sandra|last2=Gubar|publisher=New Haven : Yale University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0300084580|location=London|pages=45–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert and Gubar's specific focus on literary criticism in the realm of poetry and other short pieces has expanded the possibilities of feminist literary contributions today, as they were previously seen as less valid than longer works. Today, writers like [[Gloria E. Anzaldúa]] have been able to contribute to the feminist canon, while still working with writing forms other than full-sized novels.

In the 1980s, [[Hazel Carby]], [[Barbara Christian]], [[bell hooks]], [[Nellie Y. McKay|Nellie McKay]], [[Valerie Smith (academic)|Valerie Smith]], [[Hortense Spillers]], Eleanor Traylor, [[Cheryl Wall]] and Sheryl Ann Williams all contributed heavily to the Black Feminist Scholarship of the period. During that same time, [[Deborah E. McDowell]] published ''New Directions for Black Feminist Criticism'', which called for a more theoretical school of criticism versus the current writings, which she deemed overly practical. In this essay McDowell also extensively discussed black women's portrayal in literature, and how it came across as even more negative than white women's portrayal. As time moved forward, the theory began to disperse in ideology. Many decided to shift towards the nuanced psychological factors of the Black experience and further away from broad sweeping generalizations. Others began to connect their works to the politics of lesbianism. Some decided to analyze the Black experience through their relationship to the Western world. Regardless, these scholars continue to employ a variety of methods to explore the identity of Black feminism in literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=def1ba3e-5b36-406d-be55-510c610a09f1%40sessionmgr198&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=112|title=EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|publisher=|accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French scholars such as [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Hélène Cixous]], [[Luce Irigaray]] and [[Bracha L. Ettinger]] introduced psychoanalytic discourses into their work by way of Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan as a way to truly “get to the root” of feminine anxieties within text to manifest broader societal truths about the place of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writersinspire.org/content/feminist-approaches-literature|title=Feminist Approaches to Literature|publisher=|accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;Bracha L. Ettinger, Matrix and Metramorphosis. ''Differences'', Vol.4, N.3,. 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;Bracha L. Ettinger ''The Matrixial Borderspace''. University of Minnesota Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Current feminist scholars in the field of literature include [[Hortense Spillers]], Nancy Armstrong, Annette Kolodny and Irene Tayler who all come from a variety of backgrounds who use their own nuanced and subjective experiences to inform their understanding of feminist literature. Currently, several university scholars all employ the usage of literary feminism when critiquing texts. The mainstreaming of this school has given academia an extremely useful tool in raising questions over the gender relationships within texts.

==Modern applications==

As with other aspects of feminist theory, over the course of the second half of twentieth century feminist literary criticism has expanded to include a significantly broader spectrum of identities under the umbrella term of 'feminism.' Third wave feminist theory and beyond has striven to include more identities and aspects of [[intersectionality]], and feminist literary criticism has followed suit. Third wave feminism and feminist literary criticism is concerned more with the intersection of race and other feminist concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=VanNewkirk|first1=Robbin Hillary|title=Third Wave Feminist History and the Politics of Being Visible and Being Real|url=http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=wsi_theses|website=ScholarWorks @ Georgia State University|publisher=Georgia State University|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the variety and nature of texts examined has grown to include more texts from transnational perspective, while still maintaining its roots in analyzing how male dominated society effects the interpretation and creation of literature. At the same time, new feminist literary critics examine the universal images used by women writers to uncover the unconscious symbolism women have used to describe themselves, their world, female society across time and nationalities to uncover the specifically feminine language in literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gorski|first1=Hedwig Irene|title=The Riddle of Correspondences in A. S. Byatt's ''Possession: A Romance'' with H. D.'s ''Trilogy''|url=https://www.amazon.com/Riddle-Correspondences-S-Byatts-Possession/dp/1725926466}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Feminist literature and criticism minimize the focus on male influences and disruptions in a woman's text by socio-political hegemony to better uncover the universal unconscious of the female mind in its own context.

Nietzsche's thought enjoyed renewed popularity in the 1960s and his ideas have since had a profound impact on 20th and early-21st century thinkers across philosophy—especially in schools of [[continental philosophy]] such as [[existentialism]], [[postmodernism]] and [[post-structuralism]]—as well as art, literature, [[psychology]], politics and popular culture.&lt;ref name="Raymond A.

==Life==
===Youth (1844–1868)===
{{anchor|youth}}
Born on 15 October 1844, Nietzsche grew up in the small town of [[Röcken]], near [[Leipzig]], in the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] [[Province of Saxony]]. He was named after King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia]], who turned 49 on the day of Nietzsche's birth (Nietzsche later dropped his middle name Wilhelm).{{Sfn |Kaufmann |1974 |p=22}} Nietzsche's parents, Carl Ludwig Nietzsche (1813–1849), a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] pastor and former teacher; and {{ill|Franziska Nietzsche|de|Franziska Oehler}} (1826–1897), married in 1843, the year before their son's birth. They had two other children: a daughter, [[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche]], born in 1846; and a second son, Ludwig Joseph, born in 1848. Nietzsche's father died from a brain ailment in 1849; Ludwig Joseph died six months later at age two.&lt;ref name="Wicks"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/nietzsche/ |title=Friedrich Nietzsche |last=Wicks |first=Robert |date=1 January 2014 |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |edition=Winter 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family then moved to [[Naumburg]], where they lived with Nietzsche's maternal grandmother and his father's two unmarried sisters. After the death of Nietzsche's grandmother in 1856, the family moved into their own house, now [[Nietzsche-Haus, Naumburg|Nietzsche-Haus]], a museum and Nietzsche study centre.

[[File:Nietzsche1861.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Nietzsche, 1861]]
Nietzsche attended a boys' school and then a private school, where he became friends with Gustav Krug, [[Rudolf Wagner]] and Wilhelm Pinder, all of whom came from highly respected families.

In 1854, he began to attend Domgymnasium in [[Naumburg]]. Because his father had worked for the state (as a pastor) the now-fatherless Nietzsche was offered a scholarship to study at the internationally recognized [[Pforta|Schulpforta]] (the claim that Nietzsche was admitted on the strength of his academic competence has been debunked: his grades were nowhere near the top of the class).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brobjer|first1=Thomas H.|title=Why Did Nietzsche Receive a Scholarship to Study at Schulpforta?|journal=Nietzsche-Studien|volume=30|pages=322–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He transferred and studied there from 1858 to 1864, becoming friends with [[Paul Deussen]] and Carl von Gersdorff. He also found time to work on poems and musical compositions. Nietzsche led "Germania", a music and literature club, during his summers in Naumburg.&lt;ref name="Wicks"/&gt; At [[Schulpforta]], Nietzsche received an important grounding in languages—Greek, Latin, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and French—so as to be able to read important [[primary source]]s;&lt;ref&gt;Krell, David Farrell, and Donald L. Bates. ''The Good European: Nietzsche's work sites in word and image''. University of Chicago Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; he also experienced for the first time being away from his family life in a small-town conservative environment. His end-of-semester exams in March 1864 showed a 1 in Religion and German; a 2a in Greek and Latin; a 2b in French, History, and Physics; and a "lackluster" 3 in Hebrew and Mathematics.{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=37}}

While at [[Pforta]], Nietzsche had a penchant for pursuing subjects that were considered unbecoming. He became acquainted with the work of the then almost-unknown poet [[Friedrich Hölderlin]], calling him "my favorite poet" and composing an essay in which he said that the mad poet raised consciousness to "the most sublime ideality."&lt;ref&gt;Hayman, Ronald. ''Nietzsche: A Critical Life'', p. 42. Oxford University Press, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; The teacher who corrected the essay gave it a good mark but commented that Nietzsche should concern himself in the future with healthier, more lucid, and more "German" writers. Additionally, he became acquainted with [[Ernst Ortlepp]], an eccentric, blasphemous, and often drunken poet who was found dead in a ditch weeks after meeting the young Nietzsche but who may have introduced Nietzsche to the music and writing of [[Richard Wagner]].&lt;ref&gt;Kohler, Joachim. ''Nietzsche &amp; Wagner: A Lesson in Subjugation'', p. 17. Yale University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps under Ortlepp's influence, he and a student named Richter returned to school drunk and encountered a teacher, resulting in Nietzsche's demotion from first in his class and the end of his status as a [[Prefect#Academic|prefect]].{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=21}}

After graduation in September 1864,&lt;ref&gt;His "valedictorian paper" (''Valediktionsarbeit'', graduation thesis for Pforta students) was titled "On [[Theognis of Megara]]" ("''De Theognide Megarensi''"); see Anthony K. Jensen, Helmut Heit (eds.), ''Nietzsche as a Scholar of Antiquity'', A&amp;C Black, 2014, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche commenced studies in theology and classical philology at the [[University of Bonn]] with hope of becoming a minister. For a short time he and Deussen became members of the [[Burschenschaft]] ''[[Franconia|Frankonia]]''. After one semester (and to the anger of his mother), he stopped his theological studies and lost his faith.&lt;ref name=Schaberg&gt;{{Citation |last=Schaberg |first=William |title=The Nietzsche Canon |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1996 |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as his 1862 essay "Fate and History", Nietzsche had argued that historical research had discredited the central teachings of Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Jörg |last=Salaquarda |contribution=Nietzsche and the Judaeo-Christian tradition |title=The Cambridge Companion to Nietzsche |place=Cambridge |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1996 |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[David Strauss]]'s ''[[Life of Jesus in the New Testament|Life of Jesus]]'' also seems to have had a profound effect on the young man.&lt;ref name=Schaberg/&gt; In addition, [[Ludwig Feuerbach]]'s ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' influenced young Nietzsche with its argument that people created God, and not the other way around.&lt;ref name=Higgins&gt;{{Citation |last=Higgins |first=Kathleen |title=What Nietzsche Really Said|publisher=Random House, NY |year=2000|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1865, at the age of 20, Nietzsche wrote to his sister Elisabeth, who was deeply religious, a letter regarding his loss of faith. This letter contains the following statement:

[[File:Frankfurt Am Main-Portraits-Arthur Schopenhauer-1845.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] strongly influenced Nietzsche's earliest philosophical thought]]
Nietzsche subsequently concentrated on studying philology under Professor [[Friedrich Wilhelm Ritschl]], whom he followed to the [[University of Leipzig]] in 1865.{{sfn|Magnus|1999}} There, he became close friends with his fellow student [[Erwin Rohde]]. Nietzsche's first philological publications appeared soon after.

In 1865, Nietzsche thoroughly studied the works of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]. He owed the awakening of his philosophical interest to reading Schopenhauer's ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' and later admitted that Schopenhauer was one of the few thinkers whom he respected, dedicating the essay "[[s:Schopenhauer as Educator|Schopenhauer as Educator]]" in the ''[[Untimely Meditations]]'' to him.

In 1866, he read [[Friedrich Albert Lange]]'s ''[[History of Materialism and Critique of its Present Importance|History of Materialism]]''. Lange's descriptions of [[Kant]]'s anti-materialistic philosophy, the rise of European [[Materialism]], Europe's increased concern with science, [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]], and the general rebellion against tradition and authority intrigued Nietzsche greatly. Nietzsche would ultimately argue the impossibility of an evolutionary explanation of the human aesthetic sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pence |first=Charles H. |title=Nietzsche's aesthetic critique of Darwin |journal=History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=165–90 |year=2011 |pmid=22288334 |url=https://www.academia.edu/759427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867, Nietzsche signed up for one year of voluntary service with the Prussian artillery division in Naumburg. He was regarded as one of the finest riders among his fellow recruits, and his officers predicted that he would soon reach the rank of captain. However, in March 1868, while jumping into the saddle of his horse, Nietzsche struck his chest against the [[Saddle|pommel]] and tore two muscles in his left side, leaving him exhausted and unable to walk for months.&lt;ref&gt;Hayman, Ronald. ''Nietzsche: A Critical Life'', p. 93. Oxford University Press (New York), 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich. [[s:Selected Letters of Friedrich Nietzsche#To Freiherr Karl Von Gersdorff – June, 1868|Letter to Karl Von Gersdorff]], June 1868.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Nietzsche turned his attention to his studies again, completing them in 1868 and meeting with [[Richard Wagner]] for the first time later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Selected_Letters_of_Friedrich_Nietzsche#To_Rohde_-_October.2C_1868 |title=Letter to Rohde |date=November 1868 |last=Nietzsche |first=Friedrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professor at Basel (1869–1878)===
{{anchor|Professor at Basel|Basel}}
[[File:Rohde Gersdorff Nietzsche.JPG|thumb|upright|From left to right: [[Erwin Rohde]], Karl von Gersdorff and Nietzsche, October 1871]]
In part because of Ritschl's support, Nietzsche received a remarkable offer in 1869 to become professor of [[classical philology]] at the [[University of Basel]] in Switzerland. He was only 24 years old and had neither completed his doctorate nor received a teaching certificate ("[[habilitation]]"). He was awarded an honorary doctorate by the [[Leipzig University|University of Leipzig]], again with Ritschl's support.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony K. Jensen, Helmut Heit (eds.), ''Nietzsche as a Scholar of Antiquity'', A&amp;C Black, 2014, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that the offer came at a time when he was considering giving up philology for science, he accepted.{{Sfn |Kaufmann |1974 |p=25}} To this day, Nietzsche is still among the youngest of the tenured Classics professors on record.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Paul |last=Bishop |title=Nietzsche and Antiquity |year=2004 |page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche's 1870 projected [[doctoral thesis]], ''Contribution toward the Study and the Critique of the Sources of Diogenes Laertius'' (''Beiträge zur Quellenkunde und Kritik des Laertius Diogenes''), examined the origins of the ideas of [[Diogenes Laërtius]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony K. Jensen, Helmut Heit (eds.), ''Nietzsche as a Scholar of Antiquity'', A&amp;C Black, 2014, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Though never submitted, it was later published as a ''Gratulationsschrift'' (congratulatory publication) at [[Basel]].&lt;ref&gt;George E. McCarthy, [http://personal.kenyon.edu/mccarthy/Book1.htm ''Dialectics and Decadence'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Between 1868 and 1870, he published two other studies on Diogenes Laertius: ''De Fontibus Diogenis Laertii'' ("On the Sources of Diogenes Laertius"; Part I: 1868, Part II: 1869) and ''Analecta Laertiana'' (1870); see Jensen and Heit (eds.), 2014, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before moving to Basel, Nietzsche renounced his Prussian citizenship: for the rest of his life he remained officially [[Stateless person|stateless]].&lt;ref&gt;Hecker, Hellmuth: "Nietzsches Staatsangehörigkeit als Rechtsfrage", ''Neue Juristische Wochenschrift'', Jg. 40, 1987, nr. 23, pp. 1388–91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;His, Eduard: "Friedrich Nietzsches Heimatlosigkeit", ''Basler Zeitschrift für Geschichte und Altertumskunde'', vol. 40, 1941, p. 159–86. Note that some authors (among them Deussen and [[Mazzino Montinari|Montinari]]) mistakenly claim that Nietzsche became a Swiss citizen.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Nietzsche served in the Prussian forces during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870–1871) as a medical [[orderly]]. In his short time in the military, he experienced much and witnessed the traumatic effects of battle. He also contracted [[diphtheria]] and [[dysentery]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] speculates that he might also have contracted [[syphilis]] at a brothel along with his other infections at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Sax|first1=L.|title=What was the cause of Nietzsche's dementia?|journal=[[Journal of Medical Biography]]|volume=11|issue=1|pages=47–54|year=2003|pmid=12522502|doi=10.1177/096777200301100113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Richard |last=Schain |title=The Legend of Nietzsche's Syphilis |place=Westwood |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=2001}}.{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On returning to Basel in 1870, Nietzsche observed the establishment of the [[German Empire]] and [[Otto von Bismarck]]'s subsequent policies as an outsider and with a degree of skepticism regarding their genuineness. His inaugural lecture at the university was "[[s:Homer and Classical Philology|Homer and Classical Philology]]". Nietzsche also met [[Franz Overbeck]], a professor of theology who remained his friend throughout his life. [[Afrikan Spir]], a little-known Russian philosopher responsible for the 1873 ''Thought and Reality'', and Nietzsche's colleague the famed historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]], whose lectures Nietzsche frequently attended, began to exercise significant influence on him during this time.&lt;ref&gt;Green, M.S. ''Nietzsche and the Transcendental Tradition''. University of Illinois Press, 2002.{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche had already met [[Richard Wagner]] in Leipzig in 1868 and later Wagner's wife, [[Cosima Wagner|Cosima]]. Nietzsche admired both greatly and during his time at Basel frequently visited Wagner's house in [[Tribschen]] in [[Canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]]. The Wagners brought Nietzsche into their most intimate circle—including [[Franz Liszt]], of whom Nietzsche colloquially described: "Liszt or the art of running after women!".&lt;ref&gt;[[Rupert Hughes]], [http://www.bookrags.com/ebooks/11419/1.html#gsc.tab=0 ''The Love Affairs of Great Musicians, Volume 2''].&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche enjoyed the attention he gave to the beginning of the [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus|Bayreuth Festival]]. In 1870, he gave Cosima Wagner the manuscript of "The Genesis of the Tragic Idea" as a birthday gift. In 1872, Nietzsche published his first book, ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]''. However, his colleagues within his field, including Ritschl, expressed little enthusiasm for the work in which Nietzsche eschewed the classical philologic method in favor of a more speculative approach. In his [[polemic]] ''Philology of the Future'', [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff]] dampened the book's reception and increased its notoriety. In response, Rohde (then a professor in [[Kiel]]) and Wagner came to Nietzsche's defense. Nietzsche remarked freely about the isolation he felt within the philological community and attempted unsuccessfully to transfer to a position in philosophy at Basel instead.

[[File:Friedrich Nietzsche-1872.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Nietzsche, c. 1872]]
In 1873, Nietzsche began to accumulate notes that would be posthumously published as ''[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]''. Between 1873 and 1876, he published four separate long essays: "[[David Strauss]]: the Confessor and the Writer", "On the Use and Abuse of History for Life", "Schopenhauer as Educator" and "Richard Wagner in Bayreuth". These four later appeared in a collected edition under the title ''[[Untimely Meditations]]''. The essays shared the orientation of a cultural critique, challenging the developing German culture along lines suggested by Schopenhauer and Wagner. During this time in the circle of the Wagners, he met [[Malwida von Meysenbug]] and [[Hans von Bülow]]. He also began a friendship with [[Paul Rée]], who in 1876 influenced him into dismissing the pessimism in his early writings. However, he was deeply disappointed by the [[Bayreuth Festival]] of 1876, where the banality of the shows and baseness of the public repelled him. He was also alienated by Wagner's championing of "German culture", which Nietzsche felt a contradiction in terms as well as by Wagner's celebration of his fame among the German public. All this contributed to his subsequent decision to distance himself from Wagner.

With the publication in 1878 of ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'' (a book of [[aphorism]]s ranging from metaphysics to morality to religion to gender studies), a new style of Nietzsche's work became clear, highly influenced by [[Afrikan Spir]]'s ''Thought and Reality''&lt;ref&gt;Safranski, Rüdiger (trans. Shelley Frisch). ''Nietzsche: A Philosophical Biography'', p. 161. W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2003. "This work had long been consigned to oblivion, but it had a lasting impact on Nietzsche. Section 18 of ''Human, All Too Human'' cited Spir, not by name, but by presenting a 'proposition by an outstanding logician' (2,38; HH I §18)."&lt;/ref&gt; and reacting against the pessimistic philosophy of Wagner and Schopenhauer. Nietzsche's friendship with Deussen and Rohde cooled as well. In 1879, after a significant decline in health, Nietzsche had to resign his position at Basel. Since his childhood, various disruptive illnesses had plagued him, including moments of shortsightedness that left him nearly blind, [[migraine]] headaches, and violent indigestion. The 1868 riding accident and diseases in 1870 may have aggravated these persistent conditions, which continued to affect him through his years at Basel, forcing him to take longer and longer holidays until regular work became impractical.

===Independent philosopher (1879–1888)===

[[File:Nietzsche paul-ree lou-von-salome188.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Lou Andreas-Salomé|Lou Salomé]], [[Paul Rée]] and Nietzsche in 1882 as the three traveled through Italy, planning to establish an educational commune together, but the friendship disintegrated in late 1882 due to complications from Rée and Nietzsche's mutual romantic interest in Salomé]]
Living off his pension from Basel and aid from friends, Nietzsche travelled frequently to find climates more conducive to his health and lived until 1889 as an independent author in different cities. He spent many summers in [[Sils im Engadin/Segl|Sils Maria]] near [[St. Moritz]] in Switzerland. He spent his winters in the Italian cities of [[Genoa]], [[Rapallo]], and [[Turin]] and the French city of [[Nice]]. In 1881, when [[French conquest of Tunisia|France occupied Tunisia]], he planned to travel to [[Tunis]] to view Europe from the outside but later abandoned that idea, probably for health reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Stephan |last=Güntzel |url=http://www.hypernietzsche.org/navigate.php?sigle=sgunzel-4 |title=Nietzsche's Geophilosophy |page=85 |journal=Journal of Nietzsche Studies |volume=25 |place=University Park (Penn State) |date=15 October 2003 |language=English, German |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927184745/http://www.hypernietzsche.org/navigate.php?sigle=sgunzel-4 |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df= }}; republished on HyperNietzsche.&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche occasionally returned to Naumburg to visit his family, and, especially during this time, he and [[Elisabeth Forster-Nietzsche|his sister]] had repeated periods of conflict and reconciliation.

While in [[Genoa]], Nietzsche's failing eyesight prompted him to explore the use of [[typewriter]]s as a means of continuing to write. He is known to have tried using the [[Hansen Writing Ball#Sale and popular use|Hansen Writing Ball]], a contemporary typewriter device. In the end, a past student of his, [[Heinrich Köselitz]] or [[Heinrich Köselitz|Peter Gast]], became a sort of private secretary to Nietzsche. In 1876, Gast transcribed the crabbed, nearly illegible handwriting of Nietzsche for the first time with Richard Wagner in Bayreuth.{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=221}} He subsequently transcribed and proofread the galleys for almost all of Nietzsche's work from then on. On at least one occasion on 23 February 1880, the usually poor Gast received 200 marks from their mutual friend, Paul Rée.{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=297}} Gast was one of the very few friends Nietzsche allowed to criticize him. In responding most enthusiastically to ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', Gast did feel it necessary to point out that what were described as "superfluous" people were in fact quite necessary. He went on to list the number of people [[Epicurus]], for example, had to rely on even to supply his simple diet of goat cheese.{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=415}}

To the end of his life, Gast and Overbeck remained consistently faithful friends. [[Malwida von Meysenbug]] remained like a motherly patron even outside the Wagner circle. Soon Nietzsche made contact with the music-critic [[Carl Fuchs]]. Nietzsche stood at the beginning of his most productive period. Beginning with ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'' in 1878, Nietzsche published one book or major section of a book each year until 1888, his last year of writing; that year, he completed five.

In 1882, Nietzsche published the first part of ''[[The Gay Science]]''. That year he also met [[Lou Andreas-Salomé]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.f-nietzsche.de/lou_e.htm |contribution=Nietzsche and Lou Andreas-Salomé |title=F Nietzsche |place=DE}}&lt;/ref&gt; through Malwida von Meysenbug and [[Paul Rée]].

Salomé's mother took her to Rome when Salomé was 21. At a literary salon in the city, Salomé became acquainted with [[Paul Rée]]. Rée proposed marriage to her, but she instead proposed that they should live and study together as 'brother and sister', along with another man for company, where they would establish an academic commune.{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=149}} Rée accepted the idea, and suggested that they be joined by his friend Nietzsche. The two met Nietzsche in Rome in April 1882, and Nietzsche is believed to have instantly fallen in love with Salome, as Rée had done.  Nietzsche asked Rée to propose marriage to Salome, which she rejected. She had been interested in Nietzsche as a friend, but not as a husband.{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=149}} Nietzsche nonetheless was content to join together with Rée and Salome touring through Switzerland and Italy together, planning their commune.  The three traveled with Salomé's mother through Italy and considered where they would set up their "Winterplan" commune.   This commune was intended to be set up in an abandoned monastery, but no suitable location was found.  On 13 May, in Lucerne, when Nietzsche was alone with Salome, he earnestly proposed marriage to her again, which she rejected. He nonetheless was happy to continue with the plans for an academic commune.
.{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=149}} After discovering the situation, Nietzsche's sister Elizabeth became determined to get Nietzsche away from the "immoral woman".{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=151}} 
Nietzsche and Salomé spent the summer together in [[Tautenburg]] in Thuringia, often with Nietzsche's sister Elisabeth as a chaperone. Salomé reports that he asked her to marry him on three separate occasions and that she refused, though the reliability of her reports of events has come into question.{{Sfn |Kaufmann |1974 |p=49}} Arriving in [[Leipzig]], (Germany) in October, Salomé and Rée separated from Nietzsche after a falling-out between Nietzsche and Salomé, in which Salomé believed that Nietzsche was desperately in love with her.

While the three spent a number of weeks together in Leipzig in October 1882, the following month Rée and Salome ditched Nietzsche, leaving for Stibbe without any plans to meet again. Nietzsche soon fell into a period of mental anguish, although he continued to write to Rée, stating "We shall see one another from time to time, won't we?"{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=152}} In later recriminations, Nietzsche would blame on separate occasions the failure in his attempts to woo Salome both on Salome, Rée, and on the intrigues of his sister (who had written letters to the family of Salome and Rée to disrupt the plans for the commune). Nietzsche wrote of the affair in 1883, that he now felt "genuine hatred for my sister."{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=152}}

Amidst renewed bouts of illness, living in near-isolation after a falling out with his mother and sister regarding Salomé, Nietzsche fled to Rapallo, where he wrote the first part of ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' in only ten days.

[[File:Nietzsche1882.jpg|thumb|Photo of Nietzsche by {{ill|Gustav Adolf Schultze|de}}, 1882]]
By 1882, Nietzsche was taking huge doses of [[opium]], but he was still having trouble sleeping.{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=389}} In 1883, while staying in Nice, he was writing out his own prescriptions for the sedative [[chloral hydrate]], signing them "Dr. Nietzsche".{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=453}}

After severing his philosophical ties with [[Schopenhauer]] (who was long dead and never met Nietzsche) and his social ties with Wagner, Nietzsche had few remaining friends. Now, with the new style of ''Zarathustra'', his work became even more alienating, and the market received it only to the degree required by politeness. Nietzsche recognized this and maintained his solitude, though he often complained about it. His books remained largely unsold. In 1885, he printed only 40 copies of the fourth part of ''Zarathustra'' and distributed only a fraction of these among close friends, including [[Helene von Druskowitz]].

In 1883, he tried and failed to obtain a lecturing post at the [[University of Leipzig]]. It was made clear to him that, in view of his attitude towards Christianity and his concept of God, he had become effectively unemployable by any German university. The subsequent "feelings of revenge and resentment" embittered him: "And hence my rage since I have grasped in the broadest possible sense what wretched means (the depreciation of my good name, my character, and my aims) ''suffice'' to take from me the trust of, and therewith the possibility of obtaining, pupils."&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich. [[s:Selected Letters of Friedrich Nietzsche#Nietzsche To Peter Gast – August 1883 2|Letter to Peter Gast]]. August 1883.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886, Nietzsche broke with his publisher Ernst Schmeitzner, disgusted by his antisemitic opinions. Nietzsche saw his own writings as "completely buried and unexhumeable in this anti-Semitic dump" of Schmeitzner—associating the publisher with a movement that should be "utterly rejected with cold contempt by every sensible mind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenietzschechannel.com/correspondence/corresp.htm#schmei |title=Correspondences |publisher=Thenietzschechannel.com |date=1 February 2000 |accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then printed ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'' at his own expense. He also acquired the publication rights for his earlier works and over the next year issued second editions of ''The Birth of Tragedy'', ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'', ''[[The Dawn (book)|Daybreak]]'', and ''[[The Gay Science]]'' with new prefaces placing the body of his work in a more coherent perspective. Thereafter, he saw his work as completed for a time and hoped that soon a readership would develop. In fact, interest in Nietzsche's thought did increase at this time, if rather slowly and hardly perceptibly to him. During these years Nietzsche met [[Meta von Salis]], [[Carl Spitteler]], and [[Gottfried Keller]].

In 1886, his sister Elisabeth married the [[Antisemitism|antisemite]] [[Bernhard Förster]] and travelled to Paraguay to found [[Nueva Germania]], a "Germanic" colony—a plan Nietzsche responded to with mocking laughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title= |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |edition=online |contribution=Förster-Nietzsche, Elisabeth |url=http://www.search.eb.com.librarypx.lclark.edu/eb/article-9034925 |date=10 October 2008 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2015}} Through correspondence, Nietzsche's relationship with Elisabeth continued through cycles of conflict and reconciliation, but they met again only after his collapse. He continued to have frequent and painful attacks of illness, which made prolonged work impossible.

In 1887, Nietzsche wrote the polemic ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]''. During the same year, he encountered the work of [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], to whom he felt an immediate kinship.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich. [[s:Selected Letters of Friedrich Nietzsche#Nietzsche To Peter Gast – March, 1887|Letter to Peter Gast]]. March 1887.&lt;/ref&gt; He also exchanged letters with [[Hippolyte Taine]] and [[Georg Brandes]]. Brandes, who had started to teach the philosophy of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] in the 1870s, wrote to Nietzsche asking him to [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche#Relation to Søren Kierkegaard|read Kierkegaard]], to which Nietzsche replied that he would come to [[Copenhagen]] and read Kierkegaard with him. However, before fulfilling this promise, he slipped too far into illness. In the beginning of 1888, Brandes delivered in Copenhagen one of the first lectures on Nietzsche's philosophy.

Although Nietzsche had previously announced at the end of ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]'' a new work with the title ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]: Attempt at a [[transvaluation of values|Revaluation of All Values]]'', he eventually seems to have abandoned this idea and instead used some of the draft passages to compose ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'' and ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'' in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Mazzino |last=Montinari |title=Friedrich Nietzsche |year=1974}} translated as {{Citation |language=German |year=1991 |title=Friedrich Nietzsche. Eine Einführung |place=Berlin-New York |publisher=De Gruyter}}; and {{Citation |language=French |title=Friedrich Nietzsche |publisher=[[PUF]] |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His health seemed to improve and he spent the summer in high spirits. In the fall of 1888, his writings and letters began to reveal a higher estimation of his own status and "fate". He overestimated the increasing response to his writings, however, especially to the recent polemic, ''[[The Case of Wagner]]''. On his 44th birthday, after completing ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'' and ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'', he decided to write the autobiography ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]''. In its preface—which suggests Nietzsche was well aware of the interpretive difficulties his work would generate—he declares, "Hear me! For I am such and such a person. Above all, do not mistake me for someone else."{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888d |loc=Preface, section 1}} In December, Nietzsche began a correspondence with [[August Strindberg]] and thought that, short of an international breakthrough, he would attempt to buy back his older writings from the publisher and have them translated into other European languages. Moreover, he planned the publication of the compilation ''[[Nietzsche contra Wagner]]'' and of the poems that made up his collection ''[[Dionysian-Dithyrambs]]''.

===Psychological illness and death (1889–1900)===

[[File:NietzscheHouseTurin.jpg|thumb|left|[[Turin]] house where Nietzsche stayed (background) seen from Piazza Carlo Alberto, where he is said to have had his breakdown (at left: rear façade of [[Palazzo Carignano]])]]
On 3 January 1889, Nietzsche suffered a [[mental breakdown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Magnus|editor1-first=Bernd|editor2-last=Higgins|editor2-first=Kathleen Marie|title=The Cambridge Companion to Nietzsche|date=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521367677|pages=79–81|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Xeb80itrlRIC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two policemen approached him after he caused a public disturbance in the streets of [[Turin]]. What happened remains unknown, but an often-repeated tale from shortly after his death states that Nietzsche witnessed the flogging of a horse at the other end of the Piazza Carlo Alberto, ran to the horse, threw his arms up around its neck to protect it, and then collapsed to the ground.{{Sfn |Kaufmann |1974 |p=67}}&lt;ref&gt;Anacleto Verrecchia, "Nietzsche's Breakdown in Turin," in ''Nietzsche in Italy'', ed. Thomas Harrison (Stanford University: ANMA Libri, 1988) 105–12&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following few days, Nietzsche sent short writings—known as the ''Wahnzettel'' ("Madness Letters")—to a number of friends including [[Cosima Wagner]] and [[Jacob Burckhardt]]. Most of them were signed "[[Dionysos]]", though some were also signed "der Gekreuzigte" meaning "the crucified one". To his former colleague Burckhardt, Nietzsche wrote: "I have had [[Caiaphas]] put in [[fetters]]. Also, last year I was crucified by the German doctors in a very drawn-out manner. Wilhelm, [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], and all anti-Semites abolished."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Simon |first=Gerald |url=http://www.thenietzschechannel.com/correspondence/ger/nilettersg.htm |publisher=The Nietzsche Channel |title=Nietzsches Briefe.

Wahnbriefe. |accessdate=24 August 2013 |date=January 1889 |quote="Ich habe Kaiphas in Ketten legen lassen; auch bin ich voriges Jahr von den deutschen Ärzten auf eine sehr langwierige Weise gekreuzigt worden. Wilhelm, Bismarck und alle Antisemiten abgeschafft."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he commanded the German emperor to go to Rome to be shot and summoned the European powers to take military action against Germany,&lt;ref&gt;[[Stefan Zweig|Zweig, Stefan]] (1939), ''Master Builders [trilogy], The Struggle with the Daimon'', Viking Press, p. 524.&lt;/ref&gt; that the pope should be put in jail and that he, Nietzsche, created the world and was in the process of having all anti-Semites shot dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenietzschechannel.com/correspondence/ger/nlett1889g.htm Nietzsches Briefe, Ausgewählte Korrespondenz, Wahnzettel 1889].&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 January 1889, Burckhardt showed the letter he had received from Nietzsche to Overbeck. The following day, Overbeck received a similar letter and decided that Nietzsche's friends had to bring him back to Basel. Overbeck travelled to Turin and brought Nietzsche to a psychiatric clinic in Basel. By that time Nietzsche appeared fully in the grip of a serious mental illness, and his mother Franziska decided to transfer him to a clinic in [[Jena]] under the direction of [[Otto Binswanger]]. In January 1889, they proceeded with the planned release of ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'', by that time already printed and bound. From November 1889 to February 1890, the art historian [[Julius Langbehn]] attempted to cure Nietzsche, claiming that the methods of the medical doctors were ineffective in treating Nietzsche's condition. Langbehn assumed progressively greater control of Nietzsche until his secretiveness discredited him. In March 1890, Franziska removed Nietzsche from the clinic and, in May 1890, brought him to her home in Naumburg. During this process Overbeck and Gast contemplated what to do with Nietzsche's unpublished works. In February, they ordered a fifty-copy private edition of ''[[Nietzsche contra Wagner]]'', but the publisher [[C. G. Naumann]] secretly printed one hundred. Overbeck and Gast decided to withhold publishing ''The Antichrist'' and ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'' because of their more radical content. Nietzsche's reception and recognition enjoyed their first surge.{{Chronology citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In 1893, Nietzsche's sister Elisabeth returned from [[Nueva Germania]] in Paraguay following the suicide of her husband. She read and studied Nietzsche's works and, piece by piece, took control of them and their publication. Overbeck eventually suffered dismissal and Gast finally co-operated. After the death of Franziska in 1897, Nietzsche lived in [[Weimar]], where Elisabeth cared for him and allowed visitors, including [[Rudolf Steiner]] (who in 1895 had written one of the first books praising Nietzsche),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Rudolf |last=Steiner |title=Friedrich Nietzsche, ein Kämpfer gegen seine Zeit |place=Weimar |year=1895}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp |needed=yes|date=April 2012}} to meet her uncommunicative brother. Elisabeth at one point went so far as to employ Steiner as a tutor to help her to understand her brother's philosophy. Steiner abandoned the attempt after only a few months, declaring that it was impossible to teach her anything about philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Andrew |last=Bailey |title=First Philosophy: Fundamental Problems and Readings in Philosophy |publisher=Broadview Press |year=2002 |page=704}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eh-dm-27.JPG|thumb|[[Heinrich Köselitz|Peter Gast]] "corrected" Nietzsche's writings after the breakdown without his approval]]
Nietzsche's mental illness was originally diagnosed as [[Syphilis#Tertiary|tertiary syphilis]], in accordance with a prevailing medical paradigm of the time. Although most commentators regard his breakdown as unrelated to his philosophy, [[Georges Bataille]] dropped dark hints ("'Man incarnate' must also go mad")&lt;ref&gt;Bataille, Georges (translated by Annette Michelson), "Writings on Laughter, Sacrifice, Nietzsche, Un-Knowing,"  Special issue, ''[[October (journal)|October]]'' no. 36, Spring 1986, pp. 42–45.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[René Girard]]'s postmortem psychoanalysis posits a worshipful rivalry with [[Richard Wagner]].&lt;ref&gt;René Girard, "Superman in the Underground: Strategies of Madness—Nietzsche, Wagner, and Dostoevsky", ''MLN'', Vol. 91, No. 6, ''Comparative Literature''. (December 1976), pp. 1161–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche had previously written, "All superior men who were irresistibly drawn to throw off the yoke of any kind of morality and to frame new laws had, if they were not actually mad, no alternative but to make themselves or pretend to be mad." (Daybreak, 14) The diagnosis of syphilis has since been challenged and a diagnosis of "[[bipolar disorder|manic-depressive illness]] with periodic [[psychosis]] followed by [[vascular dementia]]" was put forward by Cybulska prior to Schain's study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cybulska |first=EM |title=The madness of Nietzsche: a misdiagnosis of the millennium? |journal=Hospital Medicine |volume=61 |issue=8 |pages=571–75 |date=August 2000 |pmid=11045229 |doi=10.12968/hosp.2000.61.8.1403}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Schain |first=Richard |title=The Legend of Nietzsche's Syphilis |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-313-31940-2}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonard Sax]] suggested the slow growth of a right-sided retro-orbital [[meningioma]] as an explanation of Nietzsche's dementia;&lt;ref name=matthews/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Sax, "What was the cause of Nietzsche's dementia?"

In 1898 and 1899, Nietzsche suffered at least two strokes. This partially paralyzed him, leaving him unable to speak or walk. He likely suffered from clinical [[hemiparesis]]/hemiplegia on the left side of his body by 1899. After contracting [[pneumonia]] in mid-August 1900, he had another stroke during the night of 24–25 August and died at about noon on 25 August.&lt;ref&gt;Concurring reports in Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche's biography (1904) and a letter by Mathilde Schenk-Nietzsche to [[Meta von Salis]], 30 August 1900, quoted in Janz (1981) p. 221.

[[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche]] compiled ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]'' from Nietzsche's unpublished notebooks and published it posthumously. Because his sister arranged the book based on her own conflation of several of Nietzsche's early outlines and took great liberties with the material, the scholarly consensus has been that it does not reflect Nietzsche's intent. (For example, Elisabeth removed aphorism 35 of ''The Antichrist'', where Nietzsche rewrote a passage of the Bible.) Indeed, [[Mazzino Montinari]], the editor of Nietzsche's ''[[Nachlass]]'', called it a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;Montinari, Mazzino. ''The 'Will to Power' Does Not Exist''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A member of this family named Gotard Nietzsche had left Poland for Prussia, and his descendants had eventually settled in Saxony around the year 1700.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche wrote in 1888, "My ancestors were Polish noblemen (Nietzky); the type seems to have been well preserved despite three generations of German mothers."{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=6}} At one point, Nietzsche becomes even more adamant about his Polish identity.

Most scholars dispute Nietzsche's account of his family's origins.

It is not known why Nietzsche wanted to be thought of as Polish nobility. According to biographer [[R. J. Hollingdale]], Nietzsche's propagation of the Polish ancestry myth may have been part of his "campaign against Germany".{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=6}}

===Relationships and sexuality===
Nietzsche never married. He proposed to [[Lou Andreas-Salomé|Lou Salomé]] three times, but his proposal was rejected each time.&lt;ref&gt;
"Nietzsche's and Nietzsche and Lou Andreas-Salomé." Nietzsche's and Nietzsche and Lou Andreas-Salomé.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=June 2017}} There is a theory that blamed Salomé's view on sexuality as one of the reasons for her alienation from Nietzsche. As articulated in the 1898 [[novella]] ''Fenitschka'', she viewed the idea of sexual intercourse as prohibitive and marriage as a violation, with some suggesting that they indicated [[sexual repression]] and [[neurosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nietzsche's Women: Beyond the Whip|last=Diethe|first=Carol|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=1996|isbn=978-3110148190|location=Berlin|pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche scholar {{ill|Joachim Köhler|de|Joachim Köhler (Philosoph)}} has attempted to explain Nietzsche's life history and philosophy by claiming that Nietzsche was homosexual. Köhler argues that Nietzsche's syphilis, which is "...usually considered to be the product of his encounter with a prostitute in a brothel in [[Cologne]] or [[Leipzig]], is equally likely, it is now held, to have been contracted in a male brothel in [[Genoa]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Köhler |first=Joachim |title=Zarathustra's secret: the interior life of Friedrich Nietzsche |year=2002 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=978-0-300-09278-3 |page=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acquisition of the infection from a homosexual brothel was confirmed by [[Sigmund Freud]], who cited Otto Binswanger as his source.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nietzsche and Jewish Culture|last=Golomb|first=Jacob|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|isbn=978-0415095129|location=London|pages=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Köhler also suggests Nietzsche may have had a romantic relationship as well as a friendship with [[Paul Rée]].&lt;ref name="Megill" /&gt; There is the claim that Nietzsche's homosexuality is widely known in the [[Vienna Psychoanalytic Society]], with Nietzsche's friend [[Paul Deussen]] claiming that the philosopher never "touched a woman".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Young Nietzsche: Becoming a Genius|last=Pletsch|first=Carl|publisher=The Free Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0029250426|location=New York|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nietzsche and Rée: A Star Friendship|last=Small|first=Robin|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=2007|isbn=9780199278077|location=Oxford|pages=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Köhler's views have not found wide acceptance among Nietzsche scholars and commentators. Allan Megill argues that, while Köhler's claim that Nietzsche was in a confrontation with his homosexual desire cannot simply be dismissed, "the evidence is very weak," and Köhler may be projecting twentieth-century understandings of sexuality on nineteenth-century notions of friendship.&lt;ref name="Megill"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Allan Megill | year = 1996 | title = Historicizing Nietzsche?

Because of Nietzsche's [[evocative]] style and provocative ideas, his philosophy generates passionate reactions. His works remain controversial, due to their varying interpretations and misinterpretations. In the Western philosophy tradition, Nietzsche's writings have been described as the unique case of free revolutionary thought, that is, revolutionary in its structure and problems, although not tied to any revolutionary project.&lt;ref name="Bennett2001"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Benjamin Bennett |title=Goethe As Woman: The Undoing of Literature |url=https://books.google.com/?id=AVYbszVKUO4C&amp;pg=PA184 |accessdate=3 January 2013 |year=2001 |publisher=Wayne State University Press |isbn=978-0-8143-2948-1 |page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; His writings have also been described as a revolutionary project in which his philosophy serves as the foundation of a European cultural rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Friedrich Nietzsche: A Philosophical Biography|last=Young|first=Julian|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Friedrich Nietzsche: Herald of a New Era|last=Bowman|first=William|publisher=Hazar Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0997570304|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apollonian and Dionysian===
{{Main|Apollonian and Dionysian}}
The ''Apollonian and Dionysian'' is a two-fold philosophical concept, based on certain features of ancient Greek mythology: [[Apollo]] and [[Dionysus]]. Even though the concept is famously related to ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'', the poet [[Friedrich Hölderlin|Hölderlin]] had already spoken of it, and [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann|Winckelmann]] had talked of [[Dionysus|Bacchus]]. One year before the publication of ''The Birth of Tragedy'', Nietzsche wrote a fragment titled "On Music and Words".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://nietzsche.holtof.com/Nietzsche_various/on_music_and_words_and_rhetoric.htm |title=On Music and words}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it he asserted the [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauerian]] judgment that music is a primary expression of the essence of everything. Secondarily derivative are [[Lyric poetry|lyrical poetry]] and drama, which represent mere [[Phenomenon|phenomenal]] appearances of objects. In this way, [[tragedy]] is born from music.

Nietzsche found in classical Athenian tragedy an art form that [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcended]] the pessimism found in the so-called [[Silenus#The wisdom of Silenus|wisdom of Silenus]]. The Greek spectators, by looking into the abyss of human suffering depicted by characters on stage, passionately and joyously affirmed life, finding it worth living. A main theme in ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'' was that the fusion of Dionysian and Apollonian ''Kunsttrieben'' ("artistic impulses") forms dramatic arts, or tragedies. He goes on to argue that this fusion has not been achieved since the ancient Greek [[tragedians]]. Apollo represents harmony, progress, clarity and logic, whereas Dionysus represents disorder, intoxication, emotion and ecstasy. Nietzsche used these two forces because, for him, the world of mind and order on one side, and passion and chaos on the other formed principles that were fundamental to the [[Culture of Greece|Greek culture]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.historyguide.org/europe/dio_apollo.html |title=Nietzsche, Dionysus and Apollo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iP4sA3kwcFsC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=Jim+Morrison+Apollonian+and+Dionysian |title=Ideas About Art|isbn=9781444396003|author1=Desmond|first1=Kathleen K|date=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Apollonian side being a dreaming state, full of illusions; and Dionysian being the state of intoxication, representing the liberations of instinct and dissolution of boundaries. In this mold, man appears as the [[satyr]]. He is the horror of the annihilation of the principle of [[individuation|individuality]] and at the same time someone who delights in its destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.bachelorandmaster.com/creationofknowledge/apollonianism-dyonysianisism.html |title=The Apollonianism and Dionysiansism by Friedrich Nietzsche}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these principles are meant to represent [[Cognition|cognitive]] states that appear through art as the power of nature in man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.primordialtraditions.net/prime/Library/DionysusinNietzscheandGreekMyth.aspx |title=Dionysus in Nietzsche and Greek Myth |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814164705/http://www.primordialtraditions.net/prime/Library/DionysusinNietzscheandGreekMyth.aspx |archive-date=14 August 2012 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between the Apollonian and Dionysian juxtapositions is apparent, in the interplay of tragedy: the tragic hero of the drama, the main protagonist, struggles to make order (in the Apollonian sense) of his unjust and chaotic (Dionysian) fate, though he dies unfulfilled in the end. Elaborating on the conception of [[Hamlet]] as an intellectual who cannot make up his mind, and therefore is a living [[antithesis]] to the man of action, Nietzsche argues that a Dionysian figure possesses knowledge to realize that his actions cannot change the eternal balance of things, and it disgusts him enough not to be able to make any act at all. Hamlet falls under this category—he has glimpsed the supernatural reality through the Ghost, he has gained true knowledge and knows that no action of his has the power to change this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://issuu.com/mcc1289/docs/hamlet-and-nietzsche |title=Procrastination in Shakespeare's Hamlet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://geoffklock.blogspot.com/2006/11/nietzsche-on-hamlet-commonplace-book.html |title=Nietzsche on Hamlet (Commonplace Book)|date=2006-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the audience of such drama, this tragedy allows them to sense an underlying essence, what Nietzsche called the ''Primordial Unity'', which revives Dionysian nature. He describes this primordial unity as the increase of strength, experience of fullness and plenitude bestowed by [[wikt:frenzy#Noun|frenzy]]. Frenzy acts as an intoxication, and is crucial for the [[Physiology|physiological]] condition that enables making of any art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://jorbon.tripod.com/niet01.html |title=The role of art in Nietzsche's philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stimulated by this state, a person's artistic will is enhanced:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In this state one enriches everything out of one's own fullness: whatever one sees, whatever wills is seen swelled, taut, strong, overloaded with strength. A man in this state transforms things until they mirror his power—until they are reflections of his perfection. This having to transform into perfection is—art.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nietzsche is adamant that the works of [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]] represent the apex of artistic creation, the true realization of tragedy; it is with [[Euripides]], he states, that tragedy begins its ''Untergang'' (literally "going under" or "downward-way," meaning decline, deterioration, downfall, death, etc.). Nietzsche objects to Euripides' use of [[Socratic method|Socratic rationalism]] and [[morality]] in his tragedies, claiming that the infusion of [[ethics]] and [[reason]] robs tragedy of its foundation, namely the fragile balance of the Dionysian and Apollonian. [[Socrates]] emphasized reason to such a degree that he diffused the value of [[myth]] and suffering to human knowledge. [[Plato]] continued with this path in his dialogues, and the modern world eventually inherited reason at the expense of artistic impulses that could be found only in the Apollonian and Dionysus dichotomy. This leads to his conclusion that European culture from the time of Socrates had always been only Apollonian and thus [[decadence|decadent]] and unhealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.carnaval.com/prophecy/ |title=Dionysus versus Apollo}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that whenever Apollonian culture dominates, the Dionysian lacks the structure to make a coherent art, and when Dionysian dominates, the Apollonian lacks the necessary passion. Only the beautiful middle, the interplay of these two forces, brought together as an art, represented real Greek tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/nietzsche/section1.html |title=The Birth of Tragedy Summary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the impact of this idea can be seen in the book ''Patterns of Culture'', where [[anthropologist]] [[Ruth Benedict]] uses Nietzschean opposites of "Apollonian" and "Dionysian" as the stimulus for her thoughts about [[Native American culture]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://classes.yale.edu/03-04/anth500b/projects/project_sites/02_alexy/ruthpatterns.html |first=Ruth |last=Benedict |title=Patterns of Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Jung]] has written extensively on the dichotomy in ''[[Psychological Types]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://pkdreligion.blogspot.com/2011/11/influence-of-cg-jung-on-pkd-by-frank.html |title=Influence of C.G.

Here Foucault references Nietzsche's description of the birth and death of tragedy and his explanation that the subsequent tragedy of the Western world was the refusal of the tragic and, with that, refusal of the sacred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4aNoFpNfYeMC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=foucault+genealogy |title=Foucault's Nietzschean Genealogy|isbn=9780791411490|author1=Mahon|first1=Michael|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Painter [[Mark Rothko]] was influenced by Nietzsche's view of tragedy, which were presented in ''The Birth of Tragedy.''

===Perspectivism===
{{Main|Perspectivism}}

Nietzsche claimed the death of God would eventually lead to the loss of any universal perspective on things, and along with it any coherent sense of [[objective truth]].{{Sfn |Lampert |1986 |pp=17–18}}{{Sfn |Heidegger}}{{Rp |needed=yes |date=March 2012}} Nietzsche himself rejected the idea of objective reality, arguing that knowledge is [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] and conditional, relative to various fluid perspectives or interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=TxlMccAak4wC&amp;q=Objective |title=Nietzsche: Naturalism and Interpretation |first=Cox |last=Cristoph|isbn=9780520921603 |year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to constant reassessment of rules (i.e., those of philosophy, the scientific method, etc.) according to the circumstances of individual perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;Schacht, Richard, ''Nietzsche'', 1983, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; This view has acquired the name ''[[perspectivism]]''.

In ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', Nietzsche proclaims that a table of values hangs above every great person. He points out that what is common among different peoples is the act of esteeming, of creating values, even if the values are different from one people to the next. Nietzsche asserts that what made people great was not the content of their beliefs, but the act of valuing. Thus the values a community strives to articulate are not as important as the collective will to see those values come to pass. The willing is more essential than the intrinsic worth of the goal itself, according to Nietzsche. "A thousand goals have there been so far," says Zarathustra, "for there are a thousand peoples. Only the yoke for the thousand necks is still lacking: the one goal is lacking. Humanity still has no goal." Hence, the title of the aphorism, "On The Thousand And One Goals". The idea that one value-system is no more worthy than the next, although it may not be directly ascribed to Nietzsche, has become a common premise in modern social science. [[Max Weber]] and [[Martin Heidegger]] absorbed it and made it their own. It shaped their philosophical and cultural endeavor, as well as their political understanding. Weber, for example, relies on Nietzsche's perspectivism by maintaining that objectivity is still possible—but only after a particular perspective, value, or end has been established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.criticism.com/md/weber1.html |title=Max Weber's View of Objectivity in Social Science |first=Hoenisch |last=Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://socialsciences.scielo.org/scielo.php?pid=S1518-44712006000200006&amp;script=sci_arttext |title=Culture and perspectivism in Nietzsche's and Weber's view|journal=Teoria &amp; Sociedade|volume=2|issue=SE|pages=0|date=00/2006|last1=Nobre|first1=Renarde Freire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his critique of traditional philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]] and [[Plato]] in ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'', Nietzsche attacked ''[[thing in itself]]'' and ''[[cogito ergo sum]]'' ("I think, therefore I am") as [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] beliefs based on naive acceptance of previous notions and [[fallacy|fallacies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.monomorphic.org/wordpress/objective-and-subjective-reality-perspectivism/ |title=Objective and subjective reality; perspectivism|date=2011-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] puts Nietzsche in a high place in the history of philosophy. While criticizing nihilism and Nietzsche together as a sign of general decay,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3JA3vyj4slsC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=Alasdair+MacIntyre+Nietzsche+Kant |title=From Hegel to Existentialism|isbn=9780195061826|author1=Solomon|first1=Robert C|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; he still commends him for recognizing psychological motives behind Kant and [[David Hume|Hume]]'s moral philosophy:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=TN7sop-yILMC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=Alasdair+MacIntyre+Nietzsche+Kant |title=Alasdair MacIntyre|isbn=9780521793810|author1=Murphy|first1=Mark C|date=23 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For it was Nietzsche's historic achievement to understand more clearly than any other philosopher...not only that what purported to be appeals of [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] were in fact expressions of subjective will, but also the nature of the problems that this posed for philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z9RaG9ccs44C&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=Alasdair+MacIntyre+Nietzsche+Kant |title=Tradition in the ethics of Alasdair MacIntyre|isbn=9780739141489|author1=Lutz|first1=Christopher Stephen|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The "slave revolt" in morals===
{{Main|Master–slave morality}}
{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}&lt;!--4 paragraphs have no citations--&gt;
In ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'' and ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]'', Nietzsche's [[Genealogy (philosophy)|genealogical]] account of the development of modern moral systems occupies a central place. For Nietzsche, a fundamental shift took place during human history from thinking in terms of ''good and bad'' toward ''good and evil''.

The initial form of morality was set by a warrior [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] and other ruling castes of ancient civilizations. Aristocratic values of good and bad coincided with and reflected their relationship to lower [[caste]]s such as slaves. Nietzsche presents this "master morality" as the original system of morality—perhaps best associated with [[Homer]]ic Greece. To be "good" was to be happy and to have the things related to happiness: wealth, strength, health, power, etc. To be "bad" was to be like the slaves the aristocracy ruled over: poor, weak, sick, pathetic—an object of pity or disgust rather than hatred.

"Slave morality" comes about as a reaction to master-morality. Here, value emerges from the contrast between good and evil: good being associated with other-worldliness, charity, piety, restraint, meekness, and submission; and evil seen as worldly, cruel, selfish, wealthy, and aggressive. Nietzsche sees slave morality as pessimistic and fearful, values for them serving only to ease the existence for those who suffer from the very same thing. He associates slave-morality with the Jewish and Christian traditions, in a way that slave-morality is born out of the [[ressentiment]] of slaves. Nietzsche argued that the idea of equality allowed slaves to overcome their own condition without hating themselves. And by denying the inherent inequality of people (such as success, strength, beauty or intelligence), slaves acquired a method of escape, namely by generating new values on the basis of rejecting something that was seen as a perceived source of frustration. It was used to overcome the slave's own sense of inferiority before the (better-off) masters. It does so by making out slave weakness to be a matter of choice, by, e.g., relabeling it as "meekness". The "good man" of master morality is precisely the "evil man" of slave morality, while the "bad man" is recast as the "good man".

Nietzsche sees the slave-morality as a source of the nihilism that has overtaken Europe. Modern Europe and Christianity exist in a hypocritical state due to a tension between master and slave morality, both values contradictorily determining, to varying degrees, the values of most Europeans (who are "[[motley]]"). Nietzsche calls for exceptional people to no longer be ashamed of their uniqueness in the face of a supposed morality-for-all, which he deems to be harmful to the flourishing of exceptional people. He cautions, however, that morality, per se, is not bad; it is good for the masses, and should be left to them. Exceptional people, on the other hand, should follow their own "inner law". A favorite motto of Nietzsche, taken from [[Pindar]], reads: "Become what you are."

A long standing assumption about Nietzsche is that he preferred master over slave morality. However, the Nietzsche scholar [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] rejected this interpretation, writing that Nietzsche's analyses of these two types of morality were only used in a [[descriptive ethics|descriptive]] and historic sense, they were not meant for any kind of acceptance or glorifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=wvKRUSdUsnkC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;dq=Master+slave+morality |title=From Shakespeare to existentialism|isbn=978-0691013671|author1=Kaufmann|first1=Walter Arnold|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, it is clear from his own writings that Nietzsche wanted the victory of master morality. He linked the "salvation and future of the human race with the unconditional dominance"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Genealogy of Morals|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|publisher=|year=1887|isbn=|location=|pages=First essay, section 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; of master morality and called master morality "a higher order of values, the noble ones, those that say Yes to life, those that guarantee the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ecce Homo|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|publisher=|year=1908|isbn=|location=|pages=Chapter on The Case of Wagner, section 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as "there is an order of rank between man and man," there is also an order of rank "between morality and morality."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond Good and Evil|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|publisher=|year=1886|isbn=|location=|pages=Section 228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Nietzsche waged a philosophic war against the slave morality of Christianity in his "revaluation of all values" in order to bring about the victory of a new master morality that he called the "philosophy of the future" (''Beyond Good and Evil'' is subtitled ''Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Friedrich Nietzsche: Herald of a New Era|last=Bowman|first=William|publisher=Hazar Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0997570304|location=|pages=31–38, 60–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Dawn (book)|Daybreak]]'', Nietzsche begins his "Campaign against Morality".{{Sfn |Kaufmann |1974 |p=187}}{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888d |loc=M I}} He calls himself an "immoralist" and harshly criticizes the prominent moral philosophies of his day: Christianity, [[Kantianism]], and [[utilitarianism]]. Nietzsche's concept "[[God is dead]]" applies to the doctrines of Christendom, though not to all other faiths: he claimed that [[Buddhism]] is a successful religion that he compliments for fostering critical thought.{{Sfn |Sedgwick |2009 |p=26}} Still, Nietzsche saw his philosophy as a counter-movement to nihilism through appreciation of art:

{{quote|text=Art as the single superior counterforce against all will to negation of life, art as the anti-Christian, anti-Buddhist, anti-Nihilist par excellence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://jorbon.tripod.com/niet01.html |title=Art in Nietzsche's philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nietzsche claimed that the Christian faith as practised was not a proper representation of Jesus' teachings, as it forced people merely to believe in the way of Jesus but not to act as Jesus did, in particular his example of refusing to judge people, something that Christians had constantly done the opposite of.{{Sfn |Sedgwick |2009 |p=26}} He condemned institutionalized Christianity for emphasizing a morality of [[pity]] (''Mitleid''), which assumes an inherent illness in society:{{Sfn |Sedgwick |2009 |p=27}}
{{quote|text=Christianity is called the religion of ''pity''. Pity stands opposed to the tonic emotions which heighten our vitality: it has a depressing effect. We are deprived of strength when we feel pity. That loss of strength which suffering as such inflicts on life is still further increased and multiplied by pity. Pity makes suffering contagious.&lt;ref&gt;''The Antichrist'', section 7. transl. Walter Kaufmann, in ''The Portable Nietzsche'', 1977, pp. 572–73.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'' Nietzsche called the establishment of moral systems based on a dichotomy of [[good and evil]] a "calamitous error",{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888d |loc=Why I Am a Destiny, §3}} and wished to initiate a [[transvaluation of values|re-evaluation]] of the [[Value (ethics)|values]] of the Judeo-Christian world.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888c |pp=4, 8, 18, 29, 37, 40, 51, 57, 59}} He indicates his desire to bring about a new, more naturalistic source of value in the vital impulses of life itself.

While Nietzsche attacked the principles of [[Judaism]], he was not [[antisemitic]]: in his work ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]'', he explicitly condemns antisemitism, and points out that his attack on Judaism was not an attack on contemporary Jewish people but specifically an attack upon the ancient Jewish priesthood whom he claims [[antisemitic Christians]] paradoxically based their views upon.{{Sfn |Sedgwick |2009 |p=69}} An Israeli historian who performed a statistical analysis of everything Nietzsche wrote about Jews claims that cross references and context make clear that almost all (85%) negative comments are actually attacks on Christian doctrine or, sarcastically, on Richard Wagner.&lt;ref&gt;Zev Golan, "Nietzsche: Anti- or Philo-Semite? An Examination of His Books," in ''God, Man and Nietzsche'', iUniverse, 2008 edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche felt that modern antisemitism was "despicable" and against European ideals.{{Sfn |Sedgwick |2009 |p=68}} Its cause, in his opinion, was the growth in European nationalism and the endemic "jealousy and hatred" of Jewish success.{{Sfn |Sedgwick |2009 |p=68}} He wrote that Jews should be thanked for helping uphold a respect for the philosophies of ancient Greece,{{Sfn |Sedgwick |2009 |p=68}} and for giving rise to "the noblest human being (Christ), the purest philosopher ([[Baruch Spinoza]]), the mightiest book, and the most effective moral code in the world."&lt;ref name=nebraska&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm. ''Human, All Too Human: A Book for Free Spirits'', Univ. of Nebraska Press (1986) p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of God and nihilism===
{{Main|God is dead|Nihilism}}
The statement "[[God is dead]]", occurring in several of Nietzsche's works (notably in ''[[The Gay Science]]''), has become one of his best-known remarks. On the basis of it, most commentators&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Morgan |first=George Allen |title=What Nietzsche Means |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |location=Cambridge, MA |year=1941 |page=36 |isbn=978-0-8371-7404-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; regard Nietzsche as an [[atheism|atheist]]; others (such as Kaufmann) suggest that this statement reflects a more subtle understanding of divinity. Recent developments in modern science and the increasing [[secularization]] of European society had effectively 'killed' the [[Abrahamic]] God, who had served as the basis for meaning and value in the West for more than a thousand years. The death of God may lead beyond bare perspectivism to outright [[nihilism]], the belief that nothing has any inherent importance and that life lacks purpose. Here he states that the Christian moral doctrine provides people with [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]], belief in God (which [[Theodicy|justifies]] the evil in the world) and a basis for [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective knowledge]]. In this sense, in constructing a world where objective knowledge is possible, Christianity is an antidote to a primal form of nihilism—the despair of meaninglessness. As [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] put the problem, "If God as the suprasensory ground and goal of all reality is dead, if the suprasensory world of the ideas has suffered the loss of its obligatory and above it its vitalizing and upbuilding power, then nothing more remains to which man can cling and by which he can orient himself."{{Sfn |Heidegger |p=61}}

One such reaction to the loss of meaning is what Nietzsche calls ''passive nihilism'', which he recognises in the [[pessimism|pessimistic]] philosophy of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]. Schopenhauer's doctrine—which Nietzsche also refers to as [[Buddhism in the West#Philosophical interest|Western Buddhism]]—advocates separating oneself from will and desires in order to reduce suffering. Nietzsche characterises this [[Asceticism|ascetic]] attitude as a "will to nothingness", whereby life turns away from itself, as there is nothing of value to be found in the world. This moving away of all value in the world is characteristic of the nihilist, although in this, the nihilist appears to be inconsistent:&lt;ref&gt;This "will to nothingness" is still a willing of some sort, because it is exactly ''as'' a pessimist that Schopenhauer clings to life. See F. Nietzsche, ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'', III:7&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|A nihilist is a man who judges that the real world ought ''not'' to be, and that the world as it ought to be does not exist. According to this view, our existence (action, [[suffering]], willing, feeling) has no meaning: this 'in vain' is the nihilists' pathos—an inconsistency on the part of the nihilists.|Friedrich Nietzsche, KSA 12:9 [60]|taken from ''The Will to Power'', section 585, translated by [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]]}}

Nietzsche approaches the problem of nihilism as a deeply personal one, stating that this problem of the modern world is a problem that has "become conscious" in him.&lt;ref&gt;F. Nietzsche, KSA 12:7 [8]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he emphasizes both the danger of nihilism and the possibilities it offers, as seen in his statement that "I praise, I do not reproach, [nihilism's] arrival. I believe it is one of the greatest crises, a moment of the deepest self-reflection of humanity. Whether man recovers from it, whether he becomes master of this crisis, is a question of his strength!"&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche, Complete Works Vol. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nietzsche, it is only when nihilism is ''overcome'' that a culture can have a true foundation on which to thrive. He wished to hasten its coming only so that he could also hasten its ultimate departure. Heidegger interprets the death of God with what he explains as the death of [[metaphysics]]. He concludes that metaphysics has reached its potential and that the ultimate fate and downfall of metaphysics was proclaimed with the statement "God is dead".

===Will to power===
{{Main|Will to power}}
A basic element in Nietzsche's philosophical outlook is the "[[will to power]]" (''der Wille zur Macht''), which he maintained provides a basis for understanding human behavior—more so than competing explanations, such as the ones based on pressure for adaptation or survival.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1886 |p=13}}{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1882 |p=349}}{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1887 |p=II:12}} As such, according to Nietzsche, the drive for conservation appears as the major motivator of human or animal behavior only in exceptions, as the general condition of life is not one of emergency, of 'struggle for existence'.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888b |loc=Skirmishes of an untimely man, §14}} More often than not, self-conservation is but a consequence of a creature's will to exert its strength on the outside world.

In presenting his theory of human behavior, Nietzsche also addressed, and attacked, concepts from philosophies popularly embraced in his days, such as Schopenhauer's notion of an aimless will or that of [[utilitarianism]]. Utilitarians claim that what moves people is mainly the desire to be happy, to accumulate pleasure in their lives. But such a conception of happiness Nietzsche rejected as something limited to, and characteristic of, the bourgeois lifestyle of the English society,&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Leiter]], ''Routledge guide to Nietzsche on morality'', p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; and instead put forth the idea that happiness is not an aim ''per se''—it is instead a consequence of a successful pursuit of one's aims, of the overcoming of hurdles to one's actions—in other words, of the fulfillment of the will.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888c |loc=§2}}

Related to his theory of the will to power is his speculation, which he did not deem final,{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1886 |loc=I, §36}} regarding the reality of the physical world, including inorganic matter—that, like man's affections and impulses, the material world is also set by the dynamics of a form of the will to power. At the core of his theory is a rejection of [[atomism]]—the idea that matter is composed of stable, indivisible units (atoms). Instead, he seems to have accepted the conclusions of [[Ruđer Bošković]], who explained the qualities of matter as a result of an interplay of forces.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche comments in many notes about matter being a hypothesis drawn from the metaphysics of substance: G. Whitlock, "Roger Boscovich, Benedict de Spinoza and Friedrich Nietzsche: The Untold Story", ''Nietzsche-Studien'' 25, 1996, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1886 |loc=I, §12}} One study of Nietzsche defines his fully developed concept of the will to power as "the element from which derive both the quantitative difference of related forces and the quality that devolves into each force in this relation" revealing the will to power as "the principle of the synthesis of forces."{{Sfn |Deleuze |2006 |p=46}} Of such forces Nietzsche said they could perhaps be viewed as a primitive form of the will. Likewise he rejected as a mere interpretation the view that the movement of bodies is ruled by inexorable laws of nature, positing instead that movement was governed by the power relations between bodies and forces.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1886 |loc=I, §22}} Other scholars disagree that Nietzsche considered the material world to be a form of the will to power: Nietzsche thoroughly criticized metaphysics, and by including the will to power in the material world, he would simply be setting up a new metaphysics. Other than aphorism 36 in ''Beyond Good and Evil'', where he raised a question regarding will to power as being in the material world, it was only in his notes (unpublished by himself), where he wrote about a metaphysical will to power. Nietzsche directed his landlord to burn those notes in 1888 when he left Sils Maria for the last time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/nie/summary/v031/31.1leddy.html |title=Project MUSE – Nietzsche's Mirror: The World as Will to Power (review) |journal=The Journal of Nietzsche Studies |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=66–68 |doi=10.1353/nie.2006.0006 |accessdate=22 August 2014|date=2006-06-14 |last1=Leddy |first1=Thomas }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eternal return===
{{Main|Eternal return}}

"Eternal return" (also known as "eternal recurrence") is a hypothetical concept that posits that the universe has been recurring, and will continue to recur, in a self-similar form for an infinite number of times across infinite time or space. It is a purely [[physics|physical]] concept, involving no supernatural [[reincarnation]], but the return of beings in the same bodies. Nietzsche first invokes the idea of eternal return in a parable in Section 341 of ''[[The Gay Science]]'', and also in the chapter "Of the Vision and the Riddle" in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', among other places.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1961 |pp=176–80}} Nietzsche contemplates the idea as potentially "horrifying and paralyzing," and says that its burden is the "heaviest weight" imaginable ("''das schwerste Gewicht''").&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Kundera |first=Milan |title=The Unbearable Lightness of Being |year=1999 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wish for the eternal return of all events would mark the ultimate affirmation of life, a reaction to [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s praise of denying the will‐to‐live. To comprehend eternal recurrence in his thought, and to not merely come to peace with it but to embrace it, requires ''[[amor fati]]'', "love of fate".&lt;ref name=dudl&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dudley |first=Will |title=Hegel, Nietzsche, and Philosophy: Thinking Freedom |year=2002 |page=201 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4dLeWFK6qp0C&amp;pg=PA201|isbn=9780521812504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Heidegger]] points out in his lectures on Nietzsche, Nietzsche's first mention of eternal recurrence presents this concept as a [[Thought experiment|hypothetical ''question'']] rather than postulating it as a fact.  According to Heidegger, it is the burden imposed by the ''question'' of eternal recurrence—whether or not such a thing could possibly be true—that is so significant in modern thought: "The way Nietzsche here patterns the first communication of the thought of the 'greatest burden' [of eternal recurrence] makes it clear that this 'thought of thoughts' is at the same time 'the most burdensome thought.'"&lt;ref&gt;See Heidegger, ''Nietzsche. Volume II: The Eternal Recurrence of the Same'' trans. [[David Farrell Krell]]. New York: Harper and Row, 1984. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only does Nietzsche posit that the universe is recurring over infinite time and space, but that the different versions of events that have occurred in the past may at one point or another take place again, hence "all configurations that have previously existed on this earth must yet meet..."&lt;ref name="Vintage Books"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kaufmann |first=Friedrich Nietzsche. Transl., with comm., by Walter |title=The Gay Science with a Prelude in Rhymes and an Appendix of Songs |date=1974 |publisher=Vintage Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0394719856 |page=16 |edition=[1st ed.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; And with each version of events is hoping that some knowledge or awareness is gained to better the individual, hence "And thus it will happen one day that a man will be born again, just like me and a woman will be born, just like Mary—only that it is hoped to be that the head of this man may contain a little less foolishness..."&lt;ref name="Vintage Books"/&gt;

[[Alexander Nehamas]] writes in ''Nietzsche: Life as Literature'' of three ways of seeing the eternal recurrence: "(A) My life will recur in exactly identical fashion." This expresses a totally fatalistic approach to the idea. "(B) My life may recur in exactly identical fashion." This second view conditionally asserts [[cosmology]], but fails to capture what Nietzsche refers to in ''The Gay Science'', 341. Finally, "(C) If my life were to recur, then it could recur only in identical fashion." Nehamas shows that this interpretation exists totally independently of physics and does not presuppose the truth of cosmology. Nehamas draws the conclusion that if individuals constitute themselves through their actions, then they can only maintain themselves in their current state by living in a recurrence of past actions (Nehamas 153). Nietzsche's thought is the negation of the idea of a history of salvation.&lt;ref name="Tongeren2000"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Paul Van Tongeren |title=Reinterpreting Modern Culture: An Introduction to Friedrich Nietzsche's Philosophy |url=https://books.google.com/?id=TqxrlA9Qxg0C&amp;pg=PA295 |accessdate=18 April 2013 |year=2000 |publisher=Purdue University Press |isbn=978-1-55753-157-5 |page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Übermensch===
{{Main|Übermensch}}

Another concept important to an understanding of Nietzsche's thought is the ''Übermensch''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Nietzsche |first=Friedrich |title=The Portable Nietzsche |others=trans. Walter Kaufmann |location=New York |publisher=Penguin |year=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Nietzsche |first=Friedrich |others=ed. Adrian Del Caro and Robert Pippin |title=Nietzsche: Thus Spoke Zarathustra |isbn=978-0-521-60261-7 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lampert |first=Laurence |title=Nietzsche's Teaching |location=New Haven, CT |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Rosen |first=Stanley |title=The Mask of Enlightenment |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developing the idea of nihilism, Nietzsche wrote ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', therein introducing the concept of a value-creating Übermensch, not as a project, but as an anti-project, the absence of any project.&lt;ref name="Bennett2001"/&gt; According to Lampert, "the death of God must be followed by a long twilight of piety and nihilism (II. 19; III. 8). Zarathustra's gift of the overman is given to a mankind not aware of the problem to which the overman is the solution."{{Sfn |Lampert |1986 |p=18}} Zarathustra presents the overman as the creator of new values, and he appears as a solution to the problem of the death of God and nihilism. The overman does not follow morality of common people since that favors mediocrity but instead rises above the notion of [[good and evil]] and above the "[[Herd behavior|herd]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/notes-nietzsche.html |title=Philosophy 302: Ethics Nietzsche, "Slave and Master Morality"}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way Zarathustra proclaims his ultimate goal as the journey towards the state of overman. He wants a kind of spiritual evolution of self-awareness and overcoming of traditional views on morality and justice that stem from the [[superstition]] beliefs still deeply rooted or related to the notion of God and Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.gradesaver.com/thus-spoke-zarathustra/study-guide/major-themes/ |title=Thus Spoke Zarathustra themes}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=July 2018}}

While interpretations of Nietzsche's overman vary wildly, here is one of his quotations from ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' (Prologue, §§3–4):

{{quote|text=I teach you the overman. Man is something that shall be overcome. What have you done to overcome him?... All beings so far have created something beyond themselves; and do you want to be the ebb of this great flood, and even go back to the beasts rather than overcome man? What is ape to man? A laughing stock or painful embarrassment. And man shall be that to overman: a laughing stock or painful embarrassment. You have made your way from worm to man, and much in you is still worm. Once you were apes, and even now, too, man is more ape than any ape... The overman is the meaning of the earth. Let your will say: the overman shall be the meaning of the earth... Man is a rope, tied between beast and overman—a rope over an abyss ... what is great in man is that he is a bridge and not an end.}}

Zarathustra contrasts the overman with the [[last man]] of egalitarian modernity (most obvious example being democracy), an alternative goal humanity might set for itself. The last man is possible only by mankind's having bred an [[Apathy|apathetic]] creature who has no great passion or commitment, who is unable to dream, who merely earns his living and keeps warm. This concept appears only in ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', and is presented as a condition that would render the creation of the overman impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.nietzschespirit.com/files/The_Most_Despicable_Man_is_Coming...the_Last_Man.html |title=Nietzsche and Heidegger |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607060856/http://www.nietzschespirit.com/files/The_Most_Despicable_Man_is_Coming...the_Last_Man.html |archivedate=7 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have suggested that the notion of eternal return is related to the overman, since willing the eternal return of the same is a necessary step if the overman is to create new values, untainted by the spirit of gravity or [[asceticism]]. Values involve a rank-ordering of things, and so are inseparable from approval and disapproval; yet it was dissatisfaction that prompted men to seek refuge in other-worldliness and embrace other-worldly values. It could seem that the overman, in being devoted to any values at all, would necessarily fail to create values that did not share some bit of asceticism. Willing the eternal recurrence is presented as accepting the existence of the low while still recognizing it as the low, and thus as overcoming the spirit of gravity or asceticism. One must have the strength of the overman in order to will the eternal recurrence; that is, only the overman will have the strength to fully accept all of his past life, including his failures and misdeeds, and to truly will their eternal return. This action nearly kills Zarathustra, for example, and most human beings cannot avoid other-worldliness because they really are sick, not because of any choice they made.

The Nazis tried to incorporate the concept into their ideology. After his death, [[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche]] became the curator and editor of her brother's manuscripts. She reworked Nietzsche's unpublished writings to fit her own [[German nationalism#1871 to World War I, 1914–1918|German nationalist]] ideology while often contradicting or obfuscating Nietzsche's stated opinions, which were explicitly [[philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche#Nietzsche's criticism of anti-Semitism and nationalism|opposed to antisemitism and nationalism]]. Through her published editions, Nietzsche's work became associated with [[fascism]] and [[Nazism]];&lt;ref name="Golomb 2002"/&gt; 20th century scholars contested this interpretation of his work and corrected editions of his writings were soon made available.

Although Nietzsche has famously been misrepresented as a predecessor to Nazism, he criticized anti-Semitism, [[pan-Germanism]] and, to a lesser extent, [[nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Keith Ansell-Pearson, ''An Introduction to Nietzsche as Political Thinker: The Perfect Nihilist,'' Cambridge University Press, 1994, pp 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, he broke with his editor in 1886 because of his opposition to his editor's anti-Semitic stances, and his rupture with [[Richard Wagner]], expressed in ''[[The Case of Wagner]]'' and ''[[Nietzsche contra Wagner]],'' both of which he wrote in 1888, had much to do with Wagner's endorsement of pan-Germanism and anti-Semitism — and also of his rallying to Christianity. In a March 29, 1887 letter to [[Theodor Fritsch]], Nietzsche mocked anti-Semites, Fritsch, [[Eugen Dühring]], Wagner, Ebrard&lt;!-- is it [[Johannes Heinrich August Ebrard]] ? --&gt;, [[Adolf Wahrmund|Wahrmund]], and the leading advocate of pan-Germanism, [[Paul de Lagarde]], who would become, along with Wagner and [[Houston Chamberlain]], the main official influences of [[Nazism]].&lt;ref name=Bataille/&gt; This 1887 letter to Fritsch ended by: "And finally, how do you think I feel when the name Zarathustra is mouthed by anti-Semites?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20150815060910/http://www.geocities.com/thenietzschechannel/nlett1887.htm March 29, 1887 letter] to [[Theodor Fritsch]] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critique of mass culture===
Friedrich Nietzsche held a pessimistic view on modern society and culture. His views stand against the concept of popular culture. He believed the press and mass culture led to conformity and brought about mediocrity. Nietzsche saw a lack of intellectual progress, leading to the decline of the human species. According to Nietzsche, individuals needed to overcome this form of mass culture. He believed some people were able to become superior individuals through the use of will power. By rising above mass culture, society would produce higher, brighter and healthier human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kellner |first=Douglas |title=Nietzsche's Critique of Mass Culture |journal=International Studies in Philosophy |year=1999 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=77–89 |doi=10.5840/intstudphil199931353 |url=http://www.pdcnet.org/pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&amp;fp=intstudphil&amp;id=intstudphil_1999_0031_0003_0077_0089&amp;onlyautologin=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reading and influence==
[[File:Nietzsche Archives in Weimar.jpg|thumb|The residence of Nietzsche's last three years along with archive in [[Weimar]], Germany, which holds many of Nietzsche's papers]]
{{Main|Library of Friedrich Nietzsche}}
A trained philologist, Nietzsche had a thorough knowledge of [[Greek philosophy]]. He read [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Plato]], [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] and [[Afrikan Spir|Spir]],&lt;ref&gt;Brobjer, Thomas. "Nietzsche's Reading and Private Library, 1885–1889." Published in ''Journal of History of Ideas.''&lt;/ref&gt; who became his main opponents in his philosophy, and later [[Baruch Spinoza]], whom he saw as his "precursor" in many respects&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Franz Overbeck, 30 July 1881&lt;/ref&gt; but as a personification of the "ascetic ideal" in others. However, Nietzsche referred to Kant as a "moral fanatic", Plato as "boring", Mill as a "blockhead", and of Spinoza he said: "How much of personal timidity and vulnerability does this masquerade of a sickly recluse betray?"{{Sfn|Russell|2004|pp=693–97}} He likewise expressed contempt for British author [[George Eliot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Thomas J. |last=Joudrey |title=The Defects of Perfectionism: Nietzsche, Eliot, and the Irrevocability of Wrong |journal=[[Philological Quarterly]] |number=96.1 |year=2017 |pages=77–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche's philosophy, while innovative and revolutionary, was indebted to many predecessors. While at Basel, Nietzsche offered lecture courses on pre-Platonic philosophers for several years, and the text of this lecture series has been characterized as a "lost link" in the development of his thought. "In it concepts such as the will to power, the eternal return of the same, the overman, gay science, self-overcoming and so on receive rough, unnamed formulations and are linked to specific pre-Platonics, especially Heraclitus, who emerges as a pre-Platonic Nietzsche."{{Sfn|Nietzsche|2001|p=xxxvii}} The [[pre-Socratic]] thinker [[Heraclitus]] was known for the rejection of the concept of [[being]] as a constant and eternal principle of universe, and his embrace of "flux" and incessant change. His symbolism of the world as "child play" marked by amoral spontaneity and lack of definite rules was appreciated by Nietzsche.{{Sfn|Roochnik|2004|pp=37–39}} From his Heraclitean sympathy, Nietzsche was also a vociferous detractor of [[Parmenides]], who opposed Heraclitus and believed all world is a single Being with no change at all.{{Sfn|Roochnik|2004|p=48}}

In his ''Egotism in German Philosophy'', [[George Santayana|Santayana]] claimed that Nietzsche's whole philosophy was a reaction to Schopenhauer. Santayana wrote that Nietzsche's work was "an emendation of that of Schopenhauer. The will to live would become the will to dominate; pessimism founded on reflection would become optimism founded on courage; the suspense of the will in contemplation would yield to a more biological account of intelligence and taste; finally in the place of pity and asceticism (Schopenhauer's two principles of morals) Nietzsche would set up the duty of asserting the will at all costs and being cruelly but beautifully strong. These points of difference from Schopenhauer cover the whole philosophy of Nietzsche."{{Sfn|Santayana|1916|p=114}}

Nietzsche expressed admiration for 17th-century French moralists such as [[François de La Rochefoucauld (writer)|La Rochefoucauld]], [[Jean de La Bruyère|La Bruyère]] and [[Luc de Clapiers, marquis de Vauvenargues|Vauvenargues]],&lt;ref&gt;Brendan Donnellan, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/404869 "Nietzsche and La Rochefoucauld"] in ''[[The German Quarterly]]'', Vol. 52, No. 3 (May 1979), pp. 303–18&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for [[Stendhal]].{{Sfn|Nietzsche|1888d|loc="Why I am So Clever", §3}} The [[organicism]] of [[Paul Bourget]] influenced Nietzsche,&lt;ref&gt;Johan Grzelczyk, [http://www.hypernietzsche.org/navigate.php?sigle=jgrzelczyk-4 "Féré et Nietzsche: au sujet de la décadence"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116213847/http://www.hypernietzsche.org/navigate.php?sigle=jgrzelczyk-4 |date=16 November 2006 }}, ''HyperNietzsche'', 1 November 2005 {{fr icon}}.

Nietzsche's works did not reach a wide readership during his active writing career. However, in 1888 the influential Danish critic [[Georg Brandes]] aroused considerable excitement about Nietzsche through a series of lectures he gave at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. In the years after Nietzsche's death in 1900, his works became better known, and readers have responded to them in complex and sometimes controversial ways.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri19chisrich#page/672/mode/1up 1910 article from the Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; Many Germans eventually discovered his appeals for greater [[individualism]] and personality development in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', but responded to them divergently. He had some following among left-wing Germans in the 1890s; in 1894–1895 German conservatives wanted to ban his work as [[subversive]]. During the late 19th century [[Anarchism and Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche's ideas were commonly associated with anarchist movements]] and appear to have had influence within them, particularly in France and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;O.

Writer on music [[Donald Mitchell (writer)|Donald Mitchell]] notes that [[Gustav Mahler]] was "attracted to the poetic fire of Zarathustra, but repelled by the intellectual core of its writings." He also quotes Mahler himself, and adds that he was influenced by Nietzsche's conception and affirmative approach to nature, which Mahler presented in his [[Symphony No. 3 (Mahler)|Third Symphony]] using [[Zarathustra's roundelay]]. [[Frederick Delius]] produced a piece of choral music, ''[[A Mass of Life]]'', based on a text of ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', while [[Richard Strauss]] (who also based his [[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|''Also sprach Zarathustra'']] on the same book), was only interested in finishing "another chapter of symphonic autobiography".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=yKCq909vSpwC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=Mahler+Nietzsche+influence |title=Gustav Mahler: The Early Years |first=Mitchell |last=Donald|isbn=9780520041417 |year=1980 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Famous writers and poets influenced by Nietzsche include [[André Gide]], [[August Strindberg]], [[Robinson Jeffers]], [[Pío Baroja]], [[D.

Nietzsche's growing prominence suffered a severe setback when his works became closely associated with [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Nazi Germany]]. Many political leaders of the twentieth century were at least superficially familiar with Nietzsche's ideas, although it is not always possible to determine whether they actually read his work. It is debated among scholars whether Hitler read Nietzsche, although if he did his reading of him may not have been extensive.&lt;ref&gt;"We know, from his [Hitler's] secretary, that he could quote Schopenhauer by the page, and the other German philosopher of willpower, Nietzsche, whose works he afterwards presented to [[Mussolini]], was often on his lips."

Enigma Books (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"'Landsberg,' Hitler told [[Hans Frank]], was his 'university paid for by the state.' He read, he said, everything he could get hold of: Nietzsche, [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]], [[Leopold von Ranke|Ranke]], [[Heinrich von Treitschke|Treitschke]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]'s Thoughts and Memories, and the war memoirs of German and allied generals and statesmen....But Hitler's reading and reflection were anything but academic, doubtless he did read much. However, as was noted in an earlier chapter, he made clear in [[Mein Kampf|My Struggle]] that reading for him had purely an instrumental purpose. He read not for knowledge or enlightenment, but for confirmation of his own preconceptions." Kershaw, Ian Hitler: ''Hubris 1889–1936''.

A decade after World War II, there was a revival of Nietzsche's philosophical writings thanks to exhaustive translations and analyses by [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] and [[R. J. Hollingdale]]. Others, well known philosophers in their own right, wrote commentaries on Nietzsche's philosophy, including [[Martin Heidegger]], who produced a four-volume study, and [[Lev Shestov]], who wrote a book called ''Dostoyevski, Tolstoy and Nietzsche'' where he portrays Nietzsche and Dostoyevski as the "thinkers of tragedy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Nietzsche |first=Shestov |last=Lev|isbn=978-0821400531}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georg Simmel]] compares Nietzsche's importance to ethics to that of [[Copernicus]] for [[cosmology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.philosophynow.org/issues/29/Nietzsche_and_Germany |title=Nietzsche &amp; Germany |first=Sorgner |last=Stefan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] read Nietzsche avidly from his early life, and later frequently discussed many of his concepts in his own works.

==Early life==
Fritz Neugass was of Jewish origin. His father Julius Neugass (1869-1939) was an [[Otorhinolaryngology|ear, nose and throat specialist]] in [[Mannheim]]. Neugass took part in [[World War I]] in 1917, but was released in 1918 after being seriously injured. Influenced by the [[Wandervogel]] youth movement, he temporarily turned to [[Protestantism]]. 

==Art historian==
From 1919 he studied art history and archeology in [[Munich]], [[Berlin]] and [[Bonn]] and completed his doctorate in 1924, writing a thesis on [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[Choir (architecture)|choir stalls]], supervised by art historian [[Carl Neumann Degler|Carl Neumann]] (1860-1934) in [[Heidelberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000584035 Neugass, F. (1927). Mittelalterliches chorgestühl in Deutschland. Strassburg: J. H. E. Heitz.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925 he was a volunteer at the [[German Archaeological Institute|Deutschen Archäologischen Institut]] (German Archaeological Institute) in [[Rome]] and then in [[Florence]] and participated in excavations on [[Sicily]]. 

==Photographer and journalist==
In 1926 he settled in Paris and became a photographer and correspondent for numerous German and international newspapers. He reported for the ''[[Berliner Tageblatt]]'', the ''[[Vossische Zeitung]]'', [[Cicerone (publisher)|Cicerone]], ''[[KUNST Magazin|Kunst]]'', and especially Weltkunst. He became known for his reviews for world art and reports on the current [[Paris]] art scene. In addition to exhibition reports and essayistic works he wrote knowledgeable monographs on artists including [[Giorgio de Chirico|de Chirico]], [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]], [[Camille Pissarro|Pissarro]], and [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]]. In autumn 1933 he was romantically involved with {{ill|Luise Straus-Ernst|de}}, first wife of [[Max Ernst]] (m. 1918–1927), who had fled to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Weissweiler, Eva | title=Notre Dame de Dada : Luise Straus-Ernst, das dramatische Leben der ersten Frau von Max Ernst | publication-date=2016 | publisher=Köln Kiepenheuer &amp; Witsch | edition=1. Auflage | isbn=978-3-462-04894-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1933-39, he set out as a photographer and correspondent traveling widely and reported for English, American, French and Swiss newspapers mainly on travel and politics in Mediterranean countries.

Shortly after the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]] Neugass was interned in the camp [[Fort Carré]] in [[Antibes]]. In November 1939 he was transferred to [[Les Milles]] near [[Aix-en-Provence]]. There he met amongst others Max Ernst, [[Walter Hasenclever]] and [[Lion Feuchtwanger]]. In 1939, under the pseudonym "François Neuville" he wrote the novel ''Das Geheimnis um die Venus'' (‘The Mystery about Venus’), originally planned as a movie starring the actor [[Raimu]], which appeared in two separate Swiss newspapers. In the spring of that year he joined the French army.

As a journalist, he was accused by the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]] in 1941 of distributing enemy propaganda and sentenced. In order to forestall the impending expulsion to Germany, he emigrated in late 1941 via [[Casablanca]] and [[Cuba]] to the [[United States]]. 

==Life in the United States==
From 1942 to 1947 Neugass worked in various bookstores and for the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]]. In 1944 he married librarian Lotte Labus, who had earned her own Ph.D in Berlin, and was granted American citizenship in 1947 and freelanced for several magazines, including articles illustrated with his own photographs ’Window Shopping With Your Camera’ for ''[[Popular Photography]].''&lt;ref&gt;Popular Photography, Dec 1949, Vol. 25, No. 6. pps 40-43&lt;/ref&gt; and 'Portraiture with Match and Candle' for ''The American Annual of Photography''&lt;ref&gt;The American Annual of Photography, Volume 67, p.52ff Tennant and Ward, 1953&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s he wrote for various European newspapers [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'']], ''[[Handelsblatt]]'', ''[[Aufbau]]'', and [[ARTnews|''Art News'']] and was the American correspondent to the Swiss [[Camera (magazine)|''Camera'']] magazine&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=49hTAAAAMAAJ Tom Maloney U.S. Camera Annual 1952, Page 58]&lt;/ref&gt; in which, in writing on 'The photographers of the United Nations' he expressed the opinion that “The aim of the United Nations is identical with that which lies closest to the hearts of photographers: to bring the nations closer together through mutual understanding,”&lt;ref&gt;Fritz NEUGASS, “The photographers of the United Nations.” Camera, 1954, issue 9, page 405&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibitions ==
Neugass became a member of the [[American Society of Media Photographers|American Society of Magazine Photographers]] and was exhibited in the Village Camera Club. He traveled to [[Mexico]] to make [[Ethnology|ethnological]] photographic documentation of rural life&lt;ref&gt;[http://luna.albany.edu/luna/servlet/view/search/what/Fritz+Neugass+Papers?q=neugass&amp;sort=archive_collection%2Cdate%2Ctitle%2Csubject&amp;os=0&amp;pgs=50 See University of Albany image search]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1953 which was shown in an exhibit at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in 1954. His photography was featured by [[Edward Steichen]] in two exhibitions at the [[Museum of Modern Art]]; ''Abstraction in Photography'', May 1–July 4, 1951 which featured his photographs of New York skyscrapers reflected in puddles, windows and on car duco, and [[The Family of Man|''The Family of Man'']] January 24–May 8, 1955, his contribution to the latter being made on [[Coney Island]] of swimsuit-clad couples embracing on the beach. The photograph later illustrated a 1979 book on body language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Givens, David B | author2=Center for Nonverbal Studies | title=The nonverbal dictionary of gestures, signs &amp; body language cues : from Adam's-apple-jump to zygomatic smile | publication-date=1998 | publisher=Center for Nonverbal Studies Press | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/22295917 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Legacy==
Neugass' late work as a journalist included critical evaluations of the buying policy of the museums and strategies of the art market. Due to failing health, in January 1979, Neugass turned down their offer to be American editor for the German magazine ''Kunst''. He passed away in June. A memorial exhibit of Neugass' work was held on the 15th of October 1979 at [[Goethe-Institut, New York|Goethe House]] in New York City.

His estate is kept in the [[University at Albany, SUNY|University at Albany]], New York and was compiled by Lotte Neugass (née Labus) prior to their deposit there in the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections. There are approximately 4500 original photographs by Neugass in the collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://meg.library.albany.edu:8443/archive/view?docId=ger007.xml Fritz Neugass Papers 1913-1979, M.E.

'''''Grön eld''''' (''Fire in Green'') is a glass sculpture by [[Vicke Lindstrand]] at [[Järnvägstorget, Umeå|Järnvägstorget]], which is located in front of [[Umeå Central Station]], in [[Umeå]], Sweden. It was, at nine meters, the tallest glass sculpture in the world at the time of its inauguration in 1970.&lt;ref name="Vicke"&gt;{{cite web|title=Skulptören Vicke Lindstrand |url=http://www.vickelindstrand.com/skulptor.html |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120525145518/http://www.vickelindstrand.com/skulptor.html |archivedate=25 May 2012 |accessdate=20 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Sven Wallander]], the head of [[HSB (Sweden)|HSB]], commissioned the sculpture after he had seen the glass sculpture ''Prisma'' by Vicke Lindstrand in [[Norrköping]]. HSB donated ''Grön eld'' to [[Umeå Municipality]], which paid for the foundation.&lt;ref name="Vicke"/&gt; 

Lennart Johansson, who assembled the sculpture in 1970, told the press in December 2013 that he had hidden an image of [[Mao Zedong]] in one of the glass flames of the sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mao Zedong gömd i svenskt konstverk |url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/mao-zedong-gomd-i-svenskt-konstverk |newspaper=[[Dagens Nyheter]] |date=5 December 2013 |accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Sindra Grahn |title=Mao gömd i känd Umeå-skulptur |url=http://www.svt.se/kultur/mao-gomd-i-svenskt-konstverk |newspaper=[[SVT]] |date=5 December 2013 |accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The sculpture ==
''Grön eld'' consists of three twisted glass pillars that grow thinner at the top. The glass pillars are constructed of three thousand, nine millimeter thin, plates of glass made by [[Emmaboda glasverk]] in Sweden. The glass pieces are glued together with [[epoxy glue]] in order to cope with the harsh climate. The nine meter high sculpture weighs 45 [[ton]]s and is standing on a heavy concrete [[pedestal]] with a [[piled foundation]].&lt;ref name="Vicke"/&gt;

[[File:Haug1-138.jpg|thumb|200px|Arms in courtoisie]]
'''Heraldic courtesy''' or '''courtoisie''' is a term used in [[heraldry]] when two arms are combined next to each other. The [[dexter and sinister|dexter]] arms is flipped horizontally so its charge is turned towards the [[dexter and sinister|sinister]] arms, out of courtesy. This is usually done when the arms show an alliance.&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Matthias Hildebrandt (Begr.): ''Handbuch der Heraldik'', 19. Auflage, Neustadt an der Aisch, 1998, S. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Bernhard |last=Peter |url=http://www.dr-bernhard-peter.de/Heraldik/courtoisie.htm |title=Courtoisie und Wenden: Wann und wie? |accessdate=6 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723210933/http://www.dr-bernhard-peter.de/Heraldik/courtoisie.htm |archive-date=2012-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This placement of two arms next to each other is often used in German armorial practice, while in English heraldry [[impalement (heraldry)|impalement]] is more usual.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4444">'''Kadiatou Konaté''' is a [[Mali]]an film director and screenwriter. Her most notable work is ''L'Enfant terrible'', an animated short based on African myths. She has also produced several documentaries, often focusing on the issues of women and children in Mali.

==Personal history==
Konaté was born in [[Bamako]], Mali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africultures.com/php/?nav=personne&amp;no=3694|title=Kadiatou Konaré |accessdate=27 October 2016|language=French|work=africultures.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her family, the Konates, were royalty that had once belonged to the [[Gbara]] of [[Mali Empire|Old Mali]]. 

She was educated at [[Cheikh Anta Diop University]].&lt;ref name="Bolly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musow.com/spip.php?article356|title=Fanta Régina Nacro et kadiatou Konaré : Les amazones d’une nouvelle ère du cinéma africain|language=French|year=2007|accessdate=27 October 2016|first=Moussa |last=Bolly|work=musow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film career==
After leaving university, Konaté worked as a member of the crew on [[Souleymane Cissé]]'s 1985 classic film ''[[Yeelen]]''.&lt;ref name="Bolly"/&gt; In 1989 she wrote the screenplay for the short animated film ''La Geste de Ségou'', directed by fellow Malian Mambaye Coulibaly.&lt;ref name="Bolly"/&gt; Her first credited solo work is listed as the documentary ''Des Yeux Pour Pleurer'' (Crying Eyes), shot on video in 1992.&lt;ref name="Karthala"&gt;{{cite book|title=Les cinémas d'Afrique: dictionnaire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=61Ol3PLhYhsC&amp;pg=PA269|year=2000|publisher=KARTHALA Editions|isbn=978-2-84586-060-5|pages=269–270}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Konaté followed this with a second documentary, also shot on video, ''Circulation Routiere'' (''Traffic''), co-directed with Kabide Djedje.&lt;ref name="Karthala"/&gt; In 1993 she produced three short films, the most notable of which was ''L'Enfant terrible'' (''The Terrible Child''), co-produced with the Belgian workshop Graphoui.&lt;ref name="Bolly"/&gt; ''L'Enfant terrible'', which is based upon a [[Enfant terrible (folklore)|Central African myth]], is, like ''La Geste de Ségou'', an animated story that used puppets.&lt;ref name="terrible child"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africanfilmny.org/2012/the-terrible-child-l%E2%80%99enfant-terrible/|title=The Terrible Child / L’Enfant Terrible|accessdate=27 October 2016|work=africanfilmny.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It follows a benevolent spirit, a child which is born with teeth and the ability to talk and walk, who finds its older brother and begins an unusual journey.&lt;ref name="terrible child"/&gt; It remains her most highly acclaimed work.&lt;ref name="Bolly"/&gt;

Konaté followed her short films by returning to documentaries, releasing ''Femmes et Développement'' in 1995.&lt;ref name="Karthala"/&gt; ''Femmes et Développement'' makes comparison between women in Mali from different socioeconomic groups. The film looks at what has been accomplished by women in her country and what still needs to be accomplished.&lt;ref name="Karthala"/&gt; In 1998 she directed ''Un mineur en milieu carcéral'', a short documentary which explored the plight of children who have been incarcerated, often for minor offenses.&lt;ref name="Karthala"/&gt;

Her 2008 documentary ''Daman Da'' (''Yellow Mirage''), follows the day-to-day lives of gold miners in Mali. She was drawn to the topic after watching a local news report on the subject.&lt;ref name="Diop"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africine.org/?menu=art&amp;no=8507|title=Daman da, le mirage jaune, de Kadiatou Konaté|accessdate=27 October 2016|work=africine.org|language=French|first=Baba |last=Diop}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film showed the difficulties faced by the miners, working in crude conditions, but also the honesty and work ethic they displayed.&lt;ref name="Diop"/&gt;

'''''Life of the Party: A Political Press Tart Bares All''''' is a 2011 memoir by Lisa Baron describing her time as a spokesperson for [[Ralph Reed]].

Lisa Baron is a Jewish woman who, despite not sharing Reed's political reviews, went to work for him. Baron stated that the book reveals previously secret information including Reed's view of the [[Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal]] and Baron's sexual life; [[Kirkus Reviews]] stated that sexual encounters "seem almost quaint" since there was a "long list of prominent conservatives who have been caught doing much worse".&lt;ref name=Kirkus&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/lisa-baron/life-party/|title=Life of the Party|date=2011-05-20|accessdate=2018-11-27}} - Published in print on June 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Michelle Goldberg]], an opinion columnist of ''[[The New York Times]]'', characterized the book as "a self-portrait of a cynical, fame-hungry narcissist".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news|author=Goldberg, Michelle|authorlink=Michelle Goldberg|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/opinion/trump-supporters-bill-white-bryan-eure.html|work=Op-Ed|title=Maybe They’re Just Bad People|publisher=''The New York Times''|date=2018-11-26|accessdate=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kirkus Reviews]] described the book as "A misguided focus on sex and booze overshadows the moments of insight and inspiration."&lt;ref name=Kirkus/&gt; It criticized the focus on social life over day-to-day life in politics.&lt;ref name=Kirkus/&gt;

'''Michael David Bishop, Baron Glendonbrook''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (born 10 February 1942) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] businessman and [[life peer]] who rose to prominence as owner of the airline [[BMI (airline)|BMI]]. He sold his stake in the airline to [[Lufthansa]] on 1 July 2009 and has an estimated personal fortune of £280&amp;nbsp;[[million]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/specials/rich_list/article3762149.ece |title=Sir Michael Bishop |author=[[Sunday Times Rich List]] |date=27 April 2008 |accessdate=2 November 2008 |work=The Times |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the country's first executives.&lt;ref name="Businesses '"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8202485.stm |title=Businesses |date=14 August 2009 |accessdate=27 August 2009 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Michael Bishop was born in [[Bowdon, Greater Manchester|Bowdon]], [[Cheshire]]. The son of a factory boss, aged six he was given a pleasure flight, and in 1949 his parents took him on an [[Aer Lingus]] flight to [[Dublin]] in search of [[chocolate]], a rarity in the post-war [[rationing]] in Manchester.&lt;ref name="Guard1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2002/may/18/theairlineindustry |title=A generation game |work=The Guardian |date=18 May 2002 |accessdate=2 November 2008 |location=London |first=Andrew |last=Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Educated at the independent [[Mill Hill School]] in north [[London]], he enjoyed flying and as a result took a series of school holiday jobs with an [[Aerial photography|aerial photographer]].&lt;ref name="Times1"/&gt;

==British Midland==
In 1963, Bishop joined the [[ground handling]] operation of Manchester-based Mercury Airlines, a schedule and charter airline, which was taken over by [[BMI (airline)|British Midland Airways]] (later re-branded as BMI) in October 1964. Bishop joined British Midland, and rose to become General Manager of the airline in 1969 and Managing Director in 1972.

In 1978, the London-based Minster Assets investment group, which owned British Midland, decided to sell its stake. With the help of an entrepreneurial [[California]]n [[dentist]], Bishop raised £2.5&amp;nbsp;million to lead the [[management buy-out]], and was subsequently appointed chairman: "I had to borrow the money from an American citizen. Most venture capitalists want a return of 40% to make up for all their other failures, and they want an exit strategy."&lt;ref name="Guard1"/&gt; From 1969 he was the key driving force behind the steady growth of the airline, which held eleven percent of the landing and take-off slots at [[London Heathrow]] airport, second only to [[British Airways]],&lt;ref name="Times1"/&gt; with a route network spanning Europe, North America, Asia and Africa.

Bishop formerly held a controlling 50% + 1 share stake of BMI, with [[Germany|German]] airline [[Lufthansa]] holding 30% minus 1 share, and [[SAS Group|SAS Airlines]] a further 20%. In October 2008, under a deal agreed in 1999 as part of the package for BMI to join the [[Star Alliance]],&lt;ref name="Times1"/&gt; Bishop agreed to sell his 50% stake to Lufthansa for an undisclosed sum, though reports suggested it was about £318m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7697261.stm |title=BMI being taken over by Lufthansa |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-10-29 |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; BDLH (LH's holding vehicle) acquired Bishop's share on 1 July 2009, assuming full control of the company.

==Honours and appointments==
Between 1991 and 1993, Bishop was deputy chairman of [[Channel 4]] television, becoming chairman from 1993 to 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/sir-michael-bishop-quiet-man-of-bmi-has-fullthrottle-air-rage-562630.html |title=Sir Michael Bishop: Quiet man of BMI has full-throttle air rage |work=The Independent|date=9 May 2004 |accessdate=2 November 2008 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a board member at [[Nigel Rudd|Sir Nigel Rudd's]] Williams plc., and deputy chairman at [[Airtours]].&lt;ref name="Times1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/transport/article5061705.ece |title=Lufthansa roars into Heathrow |publisher=The Sunday Times |date=2 November 2008 |accessdate=2 November 2008 |location=London |first=Dominic |last=O'Connell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, he was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=50551 |date=14 June 1986 |page=7 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1991 he was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=52858 |date=10 March 1992 |page=4257}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws from the [[University of Leicester]] on 12 July 2007.

In an annual survey by [[The Independent]] of the UK's most influential gay men and women, Bishop was ranked as number 5 in 2005 and number 6 in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article1153578.ece |title=Gay Power: The pink list |publisher=News.independent.co.uk |date=2006-07-02 |accessdate=2013-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107115957/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article1153578.ece |archivedate=7 January 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 February 2011, Bishop was created a [[life peer]] as '''Baron Glendonbrook''', of [[Bowdon, Greater Manchester|Bowdon]] in the County of [[Cheshire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=59690 |date=4 February 2011 |page=1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Times |title=Baronies |date=4 February 2011 |page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was [[Introduction (House of Lords)|introduced]] in the [[House of Lords]] on 22 March 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/minutes/110323/ldordpap.htm#minproc House of Lords Minute of Proceedings for 22 March 2011].&lt;/ref&gt; where he sits as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]

==Personal life==
Bishop is openly [[homosexual|gay]] and, since 2008, has spoken out publicly about gay rights&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/a-revolution-in-the-boardroom-why-it-pays-to-be-gay-901851.html |title=A revolution in the boardroom |work=The Independent |date=19 August 2008 |accessdate=2 November 2008 |location=London |first=Jerome |last=Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt; and success in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Businesses 'retain gay prejudice'"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8202485.stm |title=Businesses 'retain gay prejudice' |date=14 August 2009 |accessdate=27 August 2009 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop is often referred to as "dapper" by the press to note his keen sense of elegance. A member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] since the age of 17, he is chairman of the Board of Trustees of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]]—which performs the operas of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]—due to his personal financial sponsorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20000726/ai_n14336239/pg_2?tag=artBody;col1 |title=Twenty Questions: Sir Michael Bishop, owner and chairman of British |publisher=The Independent |date=26 July 2000 |accessdate=2 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130804233504/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20000726/ai_n14336239/pg_2?tag=artBody;col1 |archivedate=4 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt; Bishop lives in [[London]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.192.com/ |title=– Search for Michael David Bishop in London |publisher=192.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at [[Bruern Abbey]], West Oxfordshire, having purchased the 18th-century property in 2013.

[[File:Norbulingka Institute, with Dhauladhar range in the background.jpg|right|thumb|Norbulingka Institute, with [[Dhauladhar]] range in the background.]]
'''Norbulingka Institute''', founded in 1995 by Kelsang and [[Kim Yeshi]] at Sidhpur, near [[Dharamshala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharamshala]], [[India]], is dedicated to the preservation of the Tibetan culture in its literary and artistic forms.

==Etymology==
The institute is named after [[Norbulingka]], the traditional summer residence of the [[Dalai Lama]]s, in [[Lhasa]], [[Tibet]]. The ground plan is based on the proportions of Avalokitesvara, the thousand-armed god of compassion, with the temple as the head.

==Overview==
[[File:Thangkaschilder.jpg|220x220px|thumb|A [[thangka]] painter, Norbulingka Institute]]
Norbulingka is dedicated to handing down tradition and restoring standards by providing training, education and employment for Tibetans. It supports an environment in which Tibetan community and family values can flourish. It reconciles the traditional creatively and respectfully with the modern, and seeks to create an international awareness of Tibetan values and their expression in art and literature. Norbulingka produces high quality, traditionally crafted art objects, as well as clothing and home furnishings. Free guided tours of the institute are available to visitors every day except Sunday. Workshop are also offered for those wishing to study Tibetan arts. The institute also runs two guesthouses—Norling Guesthouse and Chonor House. All proceeds from all Norbulingka's projects go directly back into the institute to further our endeavors to preserve Tibetan culture.

Norbulingka's art studios include Tibetan statue making, [[thangka]] painting, screen-printing, applique and tailoring, woodcarving, wood painting, papermaking, and wood and metal craft.

The Academy of Tibetan Culture, established in 1997, offers a three-year course of higher education in traditional Tibetan studies, as well as English, Chinese, and world history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norlingaotc.org] Academy of Tibetan Culture Website.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Research Department of Norbulingka houses the team composing the official biography of the Dalai Lama, of which nine volumes in Tibetan have already been published. The research section is also compiling a comprehensive encyclopedia of Tibetan culture.

[[File:Seat of Happiness Temple, Norbulingka Institute, Dharamsala.jpg|right|thumb|''Seat of Happiness Temple'', Norbulingka Institute.]]
The institute also has the two-storeyed 'Seat of Happiness Temple' (Deden Tsuglakhang) built in 1985 and set amidst the Japanese inspired Norbulingka gardens. It is known for its 1,173 murals of Buddha, frescoes of all the [[Dalai Lama]]s and drawings chronicling the life of the [[14th Dalai Lama]]. In the main hall stands the 4 mt high gilded copper Buddha [[Sakyamuni]] statue, made by institute's master statue-maker, the late Chenmo Pemba Dorje, and one of largest such statues outside Tibet. Around the temple are workshops of artisans and apprentices that produce various art objects, which are sold at the Norbulingka Shop, for the benefit of Tibetan refugees.

The Losel Doll Museum has [[diorama]] displays of traditional Tibetan scenes, using miniature Tibetan dolls in traditional costumes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qMqBvtL_nI0C&amp;pg=PA513&amp;dq=Norbulingka+Institute&amp;as_brr=0#PPA514,M1 Norbulingka Institute] ''Frommer's India'', by Pippa De Bruyn, Keith Bain, Niloufer Venkatraman, Shonar Joshi.

The '''Norman Mailer Society''' is a non-profit [[literary society]] dedicated to American author [[Norman Mailer]]. The Society promotes the legacy of its eponym by holding an annual meeting of scholars and enthusiasts, publishing ''The Mailer Review'', Project Mailer, and The NMS Podcast, awarding the Robert F. Lucid Award for the year's best scholarship, and encouraging continued interest in his work through all forms of media.

==History==
On July 11, 2002, [[J. Michael Lennon]], Barry H. Leeds, and John Whalen-Bridge met Norman Mailer in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]] to discuss the creation of the organization and gain Mailer's approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Leeds |first1=Barry H. |date=2008 |title=The Death of Norman Mailer: The Birth of the Norman Mailer Society |url=https://mailerreview.org/leeds-tribute-8abb4fb03b9e |journal=The Mailer Review |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=135–37 |doi= |access-date=2017-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mailer's biographer Robert Lucid could not attend, but he was one of the original quartet planning the Society. Having received Mailer's blessing, the Norman Mailer Society was officially founded in 2003.&lt;ref name="wolcott"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wolcott |first=James |date=June 2010 |title=The Norman Conquests |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2010/06/wolcott-201006 |work=Vanity Fair |location= |access-date=2017-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Light |first1=David |date=2008 |title=From a Novelist in Waiting |url=https://mailerreview.org/light-tribute-da9f2ececdd8 |journal=The Mailer Review |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=144–45 |doi= |access-date=2017-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the [[American Literature Association]]'s conference in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] on May 22, 2003, there was a planning meeting and interim officers elected for the Norman Mailer Society.&lt;ref name="lennon"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://normanmailersociety.org/2003/05/22/minutes-of-the-first-meeting-of-the-norman-mailer-society/ |title=Minutes of the First Meeting of the Norman Mailer Society |last=Lennon |first=J. Michael |date=May 22, 2003 |website=Project Mailer |publisher=The Norman Mailer Society |access-date=2017-03-20 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On November 1, 2003, the Society had its inaugural meeting in [[Brooklyn]] prompted in part as a reaction to Mailer's being dropped from the sixth edition of ''[[The Norton Anthology of American Literature]]'' because (according to the editors) "regular surveys of professors had shown declining use of Mr. Mailer's work".&lt;ref name="lee"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lee |first=Flora |date=November 9, 2003 |title=Another Advertisement for Mailer |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/09/nyregion/neighborhood-report-new-york-reputations-another-advertisement-for-mailer.html |work=The New York Times |location= |access-date=2017-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ron Rosenbaum, a ''New York Observer'' columnist, commented about the creation of the Society: "It's good to recognize people for their service while they're still around to appreciate it".&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt;

Non-profit incorporation papers were filed in the State of New York, July 21, 2004, and were approved on September 14, 2004.{{Citation needed|reason=Facts in this paragraph are from an email from J. Michael Lennon, but need formal citations which are forthcoming |date=April 2017}} The Society was incorporated in Windham, Connecticut in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nonprofitfacts.com/CT/Norman-Mailer-Society.html |title=Norman Mailer Society in Windham, Connecticut (CT) |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2008 |website=Nonprofit Facts |publisher= |access-date=2017-09-09 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2017 conference, J. Michael Lennon and David Light stepped down as President and Treasurer respectively. The Board unanimously elected former-VP Maggie McKinley, chair of the English Department at [[Harper College]], as President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2018 |title=Buzz |url=https://provincetownarts.org/home/?p=1543 |magazine=Provincetown Arts |location= |publisher= |page=35 |access-date=2018-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gerald Lucas (Professor of English at [[Middle Georgia State University]]) became VP and Jason Mosser (Professor of English at [[Georgia Gwinnett College]]) replaced Light as Treasurer.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://normanmailersociety.org/about|title=About the Norman Mailer Society|website=normanmailersociety.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==

Members meet annually for paper presentations, panel discussions, film viewings, and other activities centered around the life and work of Norman Mailer.&lt;ref name="bylaws" /&gt; In 2015, the Society reconvened in Provincetown, MA, for its annual conference, bringing together Society members, two of Mailer's daughters, and a reading of ''[[Tough Guys Don't Dance (novel)|Tough Guys Don't Dance]]'', Mailer's 1984 novel about his adopted hometown.&lt;ref name="wood"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wood |first=Ann |date=September 25, 2015 |title=Mailer Society Brings 'Tough Guys' Home |url=http://www.barnstablepatriot.com/home2/index.php/option=com_content/task=view/id=39846/Itemid=34 |work=Barnstable Patriot |location= |access-date=2017-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=P-town Hosts Mailer Conference |url= |work=Boston Globe |location=New England Literary News |date=September 27, 2015 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norman and [[Norris Church Mailer|Norris]] hosted Society members at post-conference parties, in 2003 at their house in [[Brooklyn Heights]], and 2004 through 2007 at their [[Provincetown, Massachusetts|Provincetown, MA]] residence.&lt;ref name="lennon732"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lennon |first=J.

The Society sponsored the 50th Anniversary March on the Pentagon that Mailer wrote about in his [[Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction|Pulitzer-Prize]]-winning book ''[[Armies of the Night]]''. Organized by the Vietnam Peace Commemoration Committee, the events took place on October 24, 2017 in Washington D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vietnampeace.org/oct-21-event |title=October 20–21 Event: From Protest to Resistance |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017 |website=Vietnam Peace Commemoration Committee |publisher= |access-date=2018-03-29 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mailer Long Branch Plaque.jpg|thumb|Plaque in Long Branch, NJ.]]

On May 23, 2018, the Society co-sponsored with the city of [[Long Branch, New Jersey|Long Branch]] the installation of a bronze memorial to Mailer and the Scarboro Hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Norman Mailer Plaque Dedication |url=http://thelinknews.net/2018/05/16/16075/ |work=The Link News |location= |date=May 22, 2018 |access-date=2018-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hotel was run and eventually owned by the Mailer family until it burned down in 1941. Members of the Society and the local community attended the unveiling ceremony where the beachside hotel used to stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.app.com/story/news/local/people/2018/05/23/long-branch-norman-mailer-scarboro-hotel-plaque/636828002/ |title=In Long Branch, a rock for native-son Norman Mailer |author=Dan Radel |date=May 23, 2018 |website=APP |publisher=USA Today |access-date=2018-05-23 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
During the fourth annual conference in Provincetown (October 12–14, 2006), the membership voted to establish the brainchild of Phillip Sipiora, ''[[The Mailer Review]]'', co-sponsored by the [[University of South Florida]] and edited by Sipiora and co-edited by Gerald Lucas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Walker |first=Kevin |date=February 12, 2007 |title=Bull's-Eye |url= |work=The Tampa Tribue |location=Bay Life, p. 1, 6–7 |access-date= |quote=USF scores a coup with an agreement to publish a literary journal linked with iconic author Norman Mailer. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://normanmailersociety.org/2007/05/19/a-new-journal-for-mailer-studies/ |title=A New Journal for Mailer Studies |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=May 18, 2007 |website=The Norman Mailer Society |publisher= |access-date=2017-10-22 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal is published annually in the fall.

In 2014 under the leadership of board member Gerald R. Lucas, the Society launched Project Mailer, a [[Digital Humanities]] initiative to "augment Mailer Studies for a digital age".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://projectmailer.net/about/ |title=About Project Mailer |last=Lucas |first=Gerald R. |date=November 11, 2014 |website=Project Mailer |publisher= |access-date=2018-10-22 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first publication was an open-access, digital version of Mike Lennon's ''Norman Mailer: Works and Days'' that's "meant to be read and used on the screen".&lt;ref name=wd&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lennon |first1=J.

Created and hosted by Society member [[Justin Bozung]], The Norman Mailer Society Podcast had its premiere episode in February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-norman-mailer-society-podcast/id978108636?mt=2 |title=The Norman Mailer Society Podcast |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Apple iTunes |publisher=Project Mailer |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Podcast is released twice monthly and features rare audio, interviews, analysis, and discussions about, as [[James Wolcott]] put it, the "wooly-bully exploits" of Norman Mailer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Wolcott |first=James |date=February 2016 |title=So, Like, Why Are We So Obsessed with Podcasts Right Now? |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2016/01/james-wolcott-on-podcasts |magazine=Vanity Fair |location= |publisher= |access-date=2017-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spring 2018, the Society sponsored the publication of [[Library of America]]'s two-volume boxed set ''Norman Mailer: the Sixties'' edited by J. Michael Lennon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://loa.org/books/575-the-sixties-boxed-set |title=Norman Mailer: The Sixties (boxed set) |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=March 2018 |website=Library of America |publisher= |access-date=2018-03-29 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The set includes ''Four Books of the 1960s'' and ''Collected Essays of the 1960s''.

==Robert F. Lucid Award==
In 2003, the Society established The Robert F. Lucid Award for Mailer Studies in recognition of Lucid's long and distinguished career as a Mailer scholar. The Lucid Award is given annually based on the recommendation of a Society committee. The winner receives a plaque and a $250 honorarium, and he or she is invited to speak at the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://normanmailersociety.org/2003/11/28/to-the-charter-members-of-the-norman-mailer-society/ |title=To the Charter Members |last=Lennon |first=J.

The '''Normansfield Theatre '''is a [[Victorian era]] building located in [[Teddington]], England.

The theatre is on the site of [[Normansfield Hospital]], which was a self-sufficient Victorian hospital complex run by Dr [[John Langdon Down]]. The hospital was where Doctor Langdon Down conducted the pioneering research into the syndrome now known as [[Down's Syndrome]]. The theatre was constructed in 1877 and completed in 1879 for the use of the patients.&lt;ref name=lost&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ezitis.myzen.co.uk/normansfield.html | title=Normansfield Hospital | work=Lost Hospitals of London | accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Notre-Dame Affair''' was an action performed by [[Michel Mourre]], [[Serge Berna]], Ghislain Desnoyers de Marbaix, and Jean Rullier, members of the radical wing of the [[Lettrist]] movement, on Easter Sunday, 9 April 1950, at [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame Cathedral]] in Paris, while the mass was aired live on national TV. Mourre, dressed in the habit of a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[monk]] and backed by his co-conspirators, chose a quiet moment in the Easter High Mass to climb to the rostrum and declaim before the whole congregation a blasphemous anti-sermon on the death of God, penned by Berna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snarkout.org/archives/2002/11/24/ Snarkout: to have done with the judgment of god!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031113002215/http://www.snarkout.org/archives/2002/11/24/ |date=2003-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
    Aujourd’hui, jour de Pâques en l’Année sainte, 
    Ici, dans l’insigne Basilique de Notre-Dame de Paris,
    J’accuse l’Église Catholique Universelle du détournement mortel de nos forces vives en faveur d’un ciel vide ;
    J’accuse l’Église Catholique d’escroquerie ;
    J’accuse l’Église Catholique d’infecter le monde de sa morale mortuaire,
    d’être le chancre de l’Occident décomposé.
    En vérité je vous le dis : Dieu est mort.
    Nous vomissons la fadeur agonisante de vos prières,
    car vos prières ont grassement fumé les champs de bataille de notre Europe.
    Allez dans le désert tragique et exaltant d’une terre où Dieu est mort
    et brassez à nouveau cette terre de vos mains nues,
    de vos mains d’orgueil,
    de vos mains sans prière.
    Aujourd’hui, jour de Pâques en l’Année sainte,
    Ici, dans l’insigne Basilique de Notre-Dame de France,
    nous clamons la mort du Christ-Dieu pour qu’enfin vive l’Homme.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
{{col-2}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
    Today, Easter day of the Holy Year,
    Here, under the emblem of Notre-Dame of Paris,
    I accuse the universal Catholic Church of the lethal diversion of our living strength toward an empty heaven,
    I accuse the Catholic Church of swindling,
    I accuse the Catholic Church of infecting the world with its funereal morality,
    Of being the running sore on the decomposed body of the West.
    Verily I say unto you: God is dead,
    We vomit the agonizing insipidity of your prayers,
    For your prayers have been the greasy smoke over the battlefields of our Europe.
    Go forth then into the tragic and exalting desert of a world where God is dead,
    And till this earth anew with your bare hands,
    With your PROUD hands,
    With your unpraying hands.
    Today Easter day of the Holy Year,
    Here under the emblem of Notre-Dame of Paris,
    We proclaim the death of the Christ-god, so that Man may live at last.

==The aftermath==
The action and the events leading up to and following it are described in detail in Michel Mourre's autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Mourre, ''In Spite of Blasphemy'', John Lehmann, 1953; translated from the French by A.W. Fielding&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the action, young [[Bohemianism|bohemians]] tied to [[Lettrism]], an avant-garde movement surrounding [[Isidore Isou]], were all arrested by the police, and thereby saved, in effect, from the furious mob that chased them from the church.&lt;ref name="Marcus89p279-86"&gt;[[Greil Marcus]] (1989) ''[[Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the 20th Century]]'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=TVAoeipLL38C preview] at Google books, pp.279-86&lt;/ref&gt; The only one held for any length of time was Mourre, himself a former Dominican monk and the instigator of the whole affair. As his fate was being decided, dozens of prominent voices from culture, the church and the state joined a debate in the newspapers on the merits or (more commonly) not, of the provocation. 

In particular ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]'', an organ of the [[French Resistance]], began with a commentary by its editor Louis Pauwels condemning the action; but a vehement letter in response by [[André Breton]], attacking Pauwels for his "partial account," and defending the actions, escalated the debate;&lt;ref name="Boucharenc05"&gt;Boucharenc, Myriam (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=uYKf2PLK1BgC ''L'universel reportage''], pp.94-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Breton50NotreDame"&gt;[[André Breton|Breton, André]] (1950) [http://juralibertaire.over-blog.com/article-le-scandale-de-notre-dame-41681161.html ''Lettre a Louis Pauwels" sur le «"scandale" de Notre Dame»''], in ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]'', April 12, 1950, ''OC III'', pp.1024-5&lt;/ref&gt; to it were devoted eight days of coverage and a running editorial forum amounting to a total of twenty-some articles by such figures as [[Jean Paulhan]], Pierre Emmanuel, [[Maurice Nadeau]], Messieur the Police Commissioner, le curé de Saint-Pierre de Chaillot, [[Gabriel Marcel]], [[Benjamin Péret]], and [[René Char]].

The police and the Church, for their part, unable to let the insult pass unpunished, nevertheless wanted to avoid amplifying it through a public trial. After a few days they brought in a psychiatrist of questionable integrity, who recommended locking Mourre away in an asylum. Participants in the Combat debate, attentive to the case, protested, and upon the intervention of a second psychiatrist, Mourre was released on 21 April.

The scandal resonated into the heart of the Lettrist movement. Consistent with practices of agitation on which Isou had founded his movement in 1945, the Notre-Dame affair nevertheless put Isou's radicality, and that of his supporters, to the test. The action thus advanced a nascent rupture in the movement, between two blocs which could be called, respectively, "artistic" and "actionist," a rupture which two years later would lead to a schism and formation of the [[Lettrist International]]. It was after [[Gil J. Wolman]], Jean-Louis Brau, and [[Guy Debord]], the principal agents of this schism, joined the Lettrist movement, siding with the actionist Ultra-Lettrist bloc still distinguished by the Notre-Dame Affair, and who, along with [[Ivan Chtcheglov]] and Berna, formed the LI. It was the LI, launched on the occasion of an intervention directed against [[Charlie Chaplin]], that between 1952 and 1957 experimented with new forms of art and action that would lead to the [[Situationist International]].

The contributors to the Combat debate sought to diminish the importance of the Notre-Dame action by pointing out that it was not entirely without precedent, as, on 22 March 1892, young [[Blanquistes]] had interrupted mass, shouting "Long live the Republic! Long live the Commune! Down with the Church!"

The '''Novelty Theatre''' (later renamed the '''Great Queen Street Theatre''' from 1900 to 1907, and the '''Kingsway Theatre''' from 1907 to 1941) was a London theatre.  It opened in 1882 in [[Great Queen Street]] and was accessed off Little Queen Street until 1905, and from the new [[Kingsway (London)|Kingsway]] road from 1905 onwards. It hosted the London premiere of ''[[A Doll's House]]'' in 1889.  The theatre closed in 1941 and was demolished in 1959.

==History==
The first theatre on the site was built to designs by [[Thomas Verity]] with decorations by E. W. Bradwell, and opened on 9 December 1882.  Its first show was the comic opera ''Melita or the Parsee's Daughter'',&lt;ref name=lloyd&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/NoveltyTheatreHolborn.htm "Novelty Theatre, Great Queen Street, Holborn, London"], Arthur Lloyd (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; composed by Henry Pontet, with a libretto by Juba Kennerley.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/3421273|publisher=National Library of Australia|title=Melita, or, The Parsee's daughter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The theatre was also the subject of many other short-lived name changes, each time reverting to its original name - from 29 March 1883 to 5 January 1884 it was known as the '''Folies Dramatique Theatre'''; from 22 October 1888 to 7 June 1889 as the '''Jodrell Theatre'''; from 4 August to 30 August 1890 as the '''New Queen's Theatre'''; and from March to August 1894 as the '''Eden Palace of Varieties'''.  See [http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/NoveltyTheatreHolborn.htm this 2008 Arthur Lloyd article].&lt;/ref&gt;  It hosted, among other notable works, a revival of ''[[Les Cloches de Corneville]]'' and ''Ascot'', by Percy Fendall, in 1883.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Edward Solomon]] and James Mortimer's ''Polly or The Pet of the Regiment'' played at the theatre in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;[http://musicaltheatreguide.com/composers/solomon/solomon_edward.htm Edward Solomon] at the Musical Theatre Guide website&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Blue Bells of Scotland'', by [[Robert Williams Buchanan]], premiered at the theatre in 1887, followed by [[James Mortimer (chess)|James Mortimer]]'s ''The Alderman'' and Fred Marsden's ''Bob'', both in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, pp. 31, 177 and 179&lt;/ref&gt;  The Russian National Opera Company produced ''The Demon'' at the Novelty in 1888, and the theatre hosted the London premiere of [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[A Doll's House]]'' in 1889.  In August 1896, Wilfred Moritz Franks accidentally stabbed Temple E. Crozier fatally onstage during a performance of [[Frank Harvey (Australian screenwriter)|Frank Harvey]]'s melodrama, ''Sins of the Night''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianlondon.org/entertainment/novelty.htm Description of Crozier's death] in ''The Sketch'', 19 August 1896, reprinted in ''The Victorian Dictionary'' at the ''Victorian London'' website&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' was presented at the theatre in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shakespeare.emory.edu/playdisplay.cfm?playid=18 "The Merchant of Venice",] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718015155/http://shakespeare.emory.edu/playdisplay.cfm?playid=18 |date=18 July 2011 }} ''Shakespeare and the Players'', Emory University (2003 Emory University)&lt;/ref&gt;

Its interior was rebuilt in 1898-1900 and 1907, reopening after the two reconstructions as the Great Queen Street Theatre (1900–1907) and Kingsway Theatre (1907–1941) respectively.  From 1900 to 1907, [[W. S. Penley]] managed the theatre, producing and starring in ''A Little Ray of Sunshine'' by [[Mark Ambient]] and revivals of ''[[The Private Secretary]]'' and ''[[Charley's Aunt]]'' in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, David. [http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/whowaswho/P-Q/PenleyWS.htm W. S. Penley Biography], Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte]&lt;/ref&gt;  It also featured the 1915 premiere of Pearn and [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]]'s ''[[The Starlight Express]]'' and the London premiere of the musical ''[[Oh, Boy! (musical)|Oh, Boy!]]'' in 1919, which ran for 167 performances.

In 1939 it hosted the premiere of [[Rutland Boughton]]'s third symphony and finally closed on 11 May 1941. It was heavily bomb-damaged during the [[The Blitz|Blitz]] and remained closed until its demolition in 1959.  Its site is now occupied by an extension of Newton Street into Great Queen Street, and an office block.

'''The painting of the Tarnovo Artistic School''' was the mainstream of the [[Bulgaria]]n fine arts between 13th and 14th centuries named after the capital and the main cultural center of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]], [[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]]. Although it was influenced by some tendencies of the [[Byzantine Art|Palaeogan Renaissance]] in the [[Byzantine Empire]], the Tarnovo painting had its own unique features which makes it a separate artistic school.&lt;ref&gt;[[André Grabar|Grabar, A.]] La peinture religiouse en Bulgarie., Paris, 1928, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;  It includes mural decoration of churches, easel painting [[icon]]s, and [[illuminated manuscript]]s. A few remains of [[mosaics]] have been found during archaeological excavation which shows that this technique was only rarely used in the Bulgarian Empire. The works of that school have some degree of realism, individualised portraits and psychological insight.&lt;ref&gt;Цончева, М. За Търновската живописна школа. - В: ''Търновска книйовна школа. 1371-1971'', С., 1974, с. 343.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mural painting ==
[[Image:Church of SS. Peter and Paul, Veliko Tarnovo, Bulgaria.jpg|200px|left|thumb|The interior of SS Peter and Pavel]]
For the first time in [[Eastern Europe]] the [[tempera]] method became widespread in the murals of the Tarnovo School of Art.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Старобългарско изкуство", Том ІІ - Никола Мавродинов, издателство "Наука и изкуство", София, 1959 г.&lt;/ref&gt; That technique allowed the work to proceed slower than the [[fresco]] method as well brighter and more saturated colouring and had potential for more additional colours. The fresco technique continued to be used, for instance in the beautiful frescoes of the [[Rock-hewn Churches of Ivanovo]] and the [[chapel]] of the Hrelyo Tower in the [[Rila Monastery]].

During the Second Empire the murals on the church walls closely encompassed every part of the surface: walls, vaults, columns, wall piers, arches, apses.&lt;ref&gt;"Старобългарско изкуство", Богдан Филов, издателство "Отечество", София, 1993 г.&lt;/ref&gt; Their positioning was in [[Horizontal plane|horizontal]] layers according to the church [[Canon law|canon]].
[[Image:Plinth from Forty Martyrs Church.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Plinth from SS Forty Martyrs Church in Tarnovo]]
[[Image:Kalojan desislava.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The ''ktitors'' of the Boyana Church sevastokrator Kaloyan and his wife Desislava.]]
On the first layer were depicted [[saint]]s who were usually stepped on a high painted plinth, which is one of the characteristic features of the School. Its lines imitated the panel plates of coloured [[marble]]. The selection of saints depended on the preferences of the ''[[ktitor]]s'' or on the general theme of the frescoes. Typical feature of the Tarnovo Artistic School are the numerous depictions of warrior-saints. For instance, in the [[Boyana Church]] there are ten warrior-saints. Widely spread was the image St [[Demetrius]] of Salonica, the patron saint of the [[Asen dynasty]], who was particularly popular in Bulgaria in 13th and 14th centuries. The ''ktitors'' were depicted in the narthex of the churches. Portraits of many noble [[Bulgarians]] from the [[Middle Ages]] have survived throughout the centuries due to that practice. In the Boyana  Church are preserved the images of Emperor [[Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria|Constantine Tikh Asen]], his wife Irina, ''sebastokrator'' [[Kaloyan (sebastocrator)|Kaloyan]] and his wife Desislava.&lt;ref&gt;Дуйчев, И. Боянската църква в научната литература - В ''Българското средновековие, С., 1972, 478-512&lt;/ref&gt; There is a beautiful fresco of Emperor [[Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria|Ivan Alexander]] in the [[ossuary]] of the [[Bachkovo Monastery]] and in the church of Dolna Kamenitsa there are eleven images: [[Despotism|despot]] Michael (son of [[Michael Shishman of Bulgaria|Michael Shishman]]) his wife an unknown noble holding a model of the church; his wife and children and two clerics. Images of warrior saints and ktitors were common in the preserved detailed mural paintings on the foundations of the churches in Trapezitsa.&lt;ref&gt;Димов, В. Разкопките на Трапезица в град Търново. - ИБАД, 5, 1915, 112-176&lt;/ref&gt; These paintings are featured with mild tones and a sense of realism in the rendered portraits and cloths. One of the churches in Trapeztisa was covered with mosaics.&lt;ref&gt;Миятев, Кр. Мозайките от Трапезица - ИБАИ, 1, 1921/1922, с. 163-165&lt;/ref&gt; The palace church also had some mosaic decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Георгиева, С., Я. Николова и Н. Ангелов. Архитектурата на двореца, с. 57, обр. VII&lt;/ref&gt;

The unique and realistic portraits in the Boyana Church are considered to be forerunners of the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The wall piers and the arches were often decorated with medallion-shaped bust images of saints. Magnificent examples of those can be observed in SS Peter and Paul Church in Tarnovo. Along with the traditional scenes such as "Christ's passions" and "Feast cycle" in the second layer; "Christ Pantokrator" in the dome and the Madonna with the infant [[Christ]] in the apse, there were also specific images and scenes. In the narthex of the  [[Holy Forty Martyrs Church, Veliko Tarnovo|SS. Forty Martyrs Church]] in Tarnovo there were frescoes of St Anna nursing the infant Mary and St Elisabeth nursing the infant John the Baptist, unfortunately the last one did not survive. The iconographic type ''Galaktotrophousa'' was a predecessor of the widely-spread images of Madonna with the infant Christ in [[Western Europe]]. Although it was canonical, that scene was rarely used in the Byzantine Iconography. In the 35 calendar scenes from the same church some of the characters were painted with contemporary garments. The large number of images of Jesus Christ in the Boyana Church makes an impression: ''Pantokrator'' (All-powerful); ''Emmanuel'' (Young man); ''Evergetes'' (Blessing); ''Mandilion''; ''Keramidion'' and the unique image ''Christ Ancient of Days'' in which He is depicted as a white-bearded Old man.
[[Image:Sv ubrus 1259.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Christ Urbus, Boyana Church near Sofia.]]
Thеre are original themes in the Transfiguration of God Chapel in the Hrelyo Tower situated in the Rila Monastery. In the dome is depicted the composition ''Sophia-Great Wisdom of God'' and in the narthex ''Psalms of David''. The scenes ''Musicians'' and ''[[Horo (dance)|Horo]]'' are especially interesting because they represent the cloths and the way of living of the Bulgarians during the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Прашков, Л. Хрельовата кула. С., 1973&lt;/ref&gt; There are scenes of [[Saint Ivan of Rila]] life.&lt;ref&gt;Прашков, Л. Един стенописен цикъл от житието на Свети Иван Пилски от XIV век. - В: ''Търновската книжовна школа''. 1371-1971, С., 1974, с. 429-442&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are relatively few preserved monuments of the Tarnovo School of Painting, they refute the popular opinion that the religious murals are inveterate and that they are inappropriate for artistic imagination.

The archaeological research shows that some public edifices and the palaces were also richly decorated with mural paintings&lt;ref&gt;"Царстващият град Търновград. Археологически проучвания.", съставители Атанас Попов и Йордан Алексиев, издателство "Наука и изкуство", София, 1985 г.&lt;/ref&gt; but unfortunately the few remaining fragments are not enough for the themes to be determined. The fragments of richly dressed men were discovered in the throne hall&lt;ref&gt;Георгиева, С., Я. Николова и Н. Ангелов. Архитектурата на двореца, с. 58, обр. VII&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that probably the hall was decorated with the depictions of the Bulgarian Emperors and Empresses.

==Illuminated manuscripts==
[[Image:Tomic Psalter.JPG|right|thumb|Page from the [[Tomić Psalter]] (1360)]]
The most famous manuscripts are the [[Sofia Psalter]], 1337, [[Tomić Psalter]], c 1360, and the [[Gospels of Tsar Ivan Alexander]], 1355&amp;ndash;1356, now in Sofia, Moscow and London respectively.  All are heavily illuminated.

== Icons ==

The Tarnovo school continued and enriched the traditions and icon design of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]]. Some notable icons include ''St Eleusa'' (13th century) from [[Nessebar]] which is currently kept in the [[Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Sofia|Alexander Nevski Cathedral]] in [[Sofia]] and ''St John of Rila'' (14th century) kept in the Rila Monastery. Like the Boyana Church frescoes in the second one there is realism and non-canonical design. Another feature of the school's iconography were the large icons which were made to fascinate the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;Härtel/Schönfeld: Kulturelle Blüte - die Schule von Tarnovo in Bulgarien S.64-67&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such icon is the Poganovo icon in the cathedral of Sofia depicting St Mary with John the Baptist which was produced in 1395. It is double-sided and with a size of 93x61 cm.

The icons were produced with varied material. The famous ceramics icon from the Preslav School during the First Empire remained relatively popular during 13th century. Icons for domestic use were usually 30x35 cm while those in the church altar could reach very large sizes. Bulgarian icon painting declined after the Ottoman conquest of the country but those traditions were continued during the [[Bulgarian National Revival]].

== Approaches ==
Through actions of [[tactical media]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://zararah.net/blog/2015/03/15/digital-rights-play-parody/ Zara Rahman: Claiming back digital rights through play and subversion]&lt;/ref&gt; the Peng Collective wants to inspire other activists and civil society organisations to be more courageous in their campaigning methods. "Let's learn from our enemies," one of their members says in an interview. "If you look at the economics of corporations, their state of mind is: 'let's look at every possible gray area of laws and use them.' And NGOs just don't do that."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobilisationlab.org/google-nest-parody-pushes-limits-of-ngo-tactics/ Mobilisation Lab: Google Nest parody pushes limits of NGO tactics]&lt;/ref&gt; They are known for wearing animal masks as sign of biological appropriation whenever they are on stage and to break the law "whenever necessary for the greater good. And yes, the arts can be a greater good."

== Projects ==

=== googlenest ===

They got international media attention, when they held a presentation called "Your data, our future" in the Name of [[Google]] at Europe's largest tech conference [[re:publica]] in 2014. All presented products were designed to gather more data from the consumers, claiming that this is in their best interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fastcocreate.com/3030418/how-activists-fooled-the-internet-with-these-convincing-new-google-nest-products Fast Company: How Activists Fooled The Internet With These Convincing New Google Nest Products]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenhuet/2014/05/07/google-nest-spoof-by-german-activists-promises-eerie-data-driven-future/ Forbes Magazine: Google Nest Spoof By German Activists Promises Eerie, Data-Driven Future]&lt;/ref&gt; After Google threatened them to take down their parody website,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/google-nest-parody-taken-down-2014-5?IR=T Business Insider: Google Got A Parody Site That Made Fun Of Its Privacy Policies To Take Everything Down]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) supported them legally:

{{quote|Unfortunately, Google's skin was not thick enough to withstand this relatively gently ribbing. The company wrote a polite note to the collective, expressing their sincere respect for political commentary—but nonetheless demanding that Peng! revise the site and assign the domain name to Google. Note to Google: polite trademark bullying is still bullying.

EFF responded to Google on Peng's behalf, explaining what should be obvious: the site was pure noncommercial political commentary. Trademark owners should not and cannot punish activists simply because they happen to use trademarks in the course of that kind of commentary.|''Corynne Mcsherry in an EFF letter to Google: Parody Is Not Trademark Infringement''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/05/dear-google-parody-not-trademark-infringement]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Slamshell ===
Invited as fake persona to a conference of the oil company [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], they created an oil spill on stage instead of the expected presentation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/14/shell-berlin-science-slam-video_n_4440676.html Shell's Berlin 'Science Slam' Event Reportedly Disrupted By Anti-Drilling Activists (Huffington Post)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/151440-oil-spill-nigeria-activists-prank-shell-hijack-science-slam-berlin-slamshell.html Premium Times Nigeria: Activists prank Shell, hijack “Science Slam” in Berlin]&lt;/ref&gt; The evening was a public relations event organized by [[Burson Marsteller]] in Berlin, where one member of the Collective could enter the stage because he claimed to have created a car that is cleaning the air.

=== Cooperation with the Yes Men and Pussy Riot ===
In 2015, the group infiltrated the [[Cinema for Peace]] Gala in Berlin with a fake polar bear and [[The Yes Men]] to go on stage and insist that divestment from fossil fuels is helping more against climate change than charity projects. [[Pussy Riot]], who was invited as speaker to the [[Charity (practice)|charity]] gala came to support them, when the organizers of the event tried to silence them with security guards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://taz.de/Cinema-for-Peace-Eklat-naechste-Runde-/!156929/ German article about the event in the newspaper taz]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://apologytonatalieportman.com/ Letter of apology to Natalie Portman for hijacking her stage and the video of the evening]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zero Trollerance ===
In May 2015, they developed a bot script that scans [[Twitter]] for abusive and sexist language. Once detected, plenty of automated Twitter profiles would reply to those tweets with an invitation to a self-help program for trolls to become [[feminist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/social-media/11535405/How-do-you-stop-Twitter-trolls-Unleash-a-robot-swarm-to-troll-them-ba Daily Telegraph Article "How do you stop Twitter trolls? Unleash a robot swarm to troll them back"]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intelexit ===
In September 2015, the Peng Collective staged an association named [[Intelexit]] helping anyone working for [[Intelligence agency|secret services]] to quit their jobs and transition to civil life, be it for ethical or psychological reasons. A spokesman of the British secret service [[GCHQ]] responded to the launch of the association, that GCHQ doesn't actually do anything illegal or immoral, and that staff can report any concerns they do have to managers or to GCHQ's own counselors. Furthermore, they responded to the Intelexits critique of their lack of ethical standards that the GCHQ "has several formal lines of accountability and a culture and ethos of high ethical standards among our workforce." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2015/09/campaign-help-surveillance-agents-quit-nsa-gchq/ Wired US article "This New Campaign Wants To Help Surveillance Agents Quit NSA or GCHQ"]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the launch of the campaign, they rallied with an advertising trucks and mobile billboards in front of several secret services workplaces around the world like the German BND, the GCHQ Headquarters in the UK, the US military bases in Germany [[Dagger Complex]] and [[Lucius D. Clay Kaserne]] and the [[NSA]]'s Headquarters in the USA, Maryland, where they also drove to the employees lunch place [http://cafejoe.homestead.com/ Café Joe]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/09/30/these-german-artists-tried-to-convince-nsa-employees-to-quit/?postshare=8101443594963254 Washington Post article "These German artists tried to persuade NSA employees to quit"]&lt;/ref&gt; They also performed an [[Airborne leaflet propaganda|airborne leaflet operation]] over the [[Dagger Complex]] with a drone advertising for the exit program.&lt;ref&gt;[https://theintercept.com/2015/10/05/drone-flies-over-nsa-complex-in-germany-dropping-pamphlets/ The Intercept article "Drone Flies Over NSA Complex in Germany, Dropping Leaflets"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Intelexit now operates phone booth installations in arts and journalists venues where participants can call up secret service employees such as the [[FBI]], [[NSA]], [[CIA]] and private subcontractors like [[Trovicor]] or [[Booz Allen Hamilton]] in the USA, but also officers from Germany, France, Canada and Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2016/03/15/peng-le-collectif-qui-veut-aider-les-espions-a-raccrocher_4883226_4408996.html Le Monde article about the Call a Spy launch]&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation invites people to set up the call installation all over the world to create an ongoing dialogue between civil society and the intelligence community.

=== Artikel 26 ===
In Schwenke (Halver), Peng! had founded a fictitious CDU local association, which appealed to party leader Angela Merkel to campaign against the export of small arms in the next legislative period. This appeal was also reported in international media. Later the communication guerrilla action was confirmed by Peng!

In the same week, Peng! started an alleged recall of small arms from the manufacturer Heckler &amp; Koch by sending letters to US arms dealers on its behalf. The web pages of Heckler &amp; Koch in the USA and Germany were then provided for several days with the news that they had been the victims of a hacker attack and fake news.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mic.com/articles/176439/anonymous-art-collective-trolls-hundreds-of-heckler-and-kochs-us-gun-vendors-with-bogus-recall-prank#.ocoh91DVr Mic article about the weapon prank]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same week, the group released a video documenting how they awarded a peace prize for the arms industry and how Thyssen Krupp Marine Systems only left shortly before the alleged award ceremony.

As part of this series of actions, Peng! published five legislative proposals for the renewal of the War Weapons Control Act and for the "Rescue of Article 26 GG".

=== Deutschland Geht Klauen ===
With this Campaign PENG called people to snatch goods in supermarkets and to pay unions of the producers in the global south instead. They created an online-system with which it is possible to do so through their website, seemingly an online-shop. You can thus pay eight unions fighting for the rights of the workers while PENG is fighting for the introduction of a law in Germany with which you can take German companies accountable for the violation of human rights abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[https://deutschlandgehtklauen.de/en Deutschlandgehtklauen website]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mask.ID ===
PENG created a photo-booth in which you could create portraits that contain your own face and from someone else by morphing them together. The technology was based on neural networks by OpenAI and megapixels by Adam Harvey.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/PengBerlin/status/1043529657168089088 Tweet from Peng revealing the sources]&lt;/ref&gt; They themselves created a German passport that contained both one member from their team and [[Federica Mogherini]]. They also sent five passports to co-artists in Libya with whom they morphed the faces to let them enter Europa as both real and symbolic gesture of civil disobedience against the border regime.&lt;ref&gt;[https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pa9vyb/peng-collective-artists-hack-german-passport article by Motherboard, "German Art Activists Get Passport Using Digitally Altered Photo of Two Women Merged Together" Oct 9 2018, 6:09pm]&lt;/ref&gt;. The photo booth was further shown in Vienna and Munich on art exhibitions.

=== Civil Financial Regulation Office ===
On the [[Athens Biennale]] 2018 named "ANTI", Peng contributed by installing a call center with six Greek employees payed by German tax money on minimum wage who are calling the [[Financial_regulation | financial regulation institutions]] for six weeks. They ask tem questions that are being posted on their website and try to get them to explain the logic of financial argumentation in understandable language. &lt;ref&gt;[https://cfro.eu Project Website]&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Rembrandt The Hundred Guilder Print.jpg|thumb|''The Hundred Guilder Print'', c.1647-1649, [[etching]] by [[Rembrandt]].  Most large print rooms have an example of this print]]

A '''print room''' is either a room or industrial building where [[printing]] takes place, or a room in an [[art gallery]] or [[museum]], where a collection of [[old master print|old master]] and modern prints, usually together with [[drawing]]s, [[watercolour]]s and [[photograph]]s, are held and viewed. The latter meaning is the subject of this article. 

A further meaning is a room decorated by pasting prints onto the wall in a quasi-[[collage]] style to form a sort of [[wallpaper]], an 18th-century fashion, of which several examples survive. One of the largest, though atypically the prints are cut out around shapes, that are pasted well spaced apart, is at [[The Vyne]], [[Basingstoke]], [[Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nttreasurehunt.wordpress.com/2011/05/02/the-many-layers-of-the-vyne/|title=The many layers of The Vyne|work=Treasure Hunt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==
For conservation reasons works on paper cannot be permanently displayed, as light, temperature and humidity conditions leave them vulnerable to damage, normally limiting an open display to no more than 6 months.  They are kept in inert, acid-free boxes, albums or portfolios behind closed doors; which considerations of space would dictate in any case for the vast majority.  Where possible, they are mounted on archivally safe supports, but large collections still contain less important items loose in boxes. Storage may be in the same room as the viewing is done (the 'Reading-' or 'Study Room'), but as the largest collections have well over a million items stores are often located 'behind the scenes', along with the [[curator]]s' offices. Typically, a large print room appears like a library reading room, and the visitor sits at a desk equipped with a stand or easel, fills in a request slip, and the material requested is brought out for them by curatorial staff, who are able to offer further information about works and artists. Visitors are often able to compare a selection of works by different artists, aiding connoisseurial study.

== Visiting==
[[File:Guercino - Martirio dei Santi Giovanni e Paolo.jpg|thumb|[[Drawing]] of martyrs [[John and Paul]] by [[Guercino]], [[Courtauld Institute]], London]] 
Most national collections can be seen by the public more easily than is often realised. Usually, visitors of all sorts, whether researchers or not, are entitled to view works on paper not on display in the galleries, which will form the great majority of an institution's collection, thereby making print rooms an essential resource for enabling our understanding and appreciation of works on paper - in particular, how artists conceive of finished paintings through preparatory studies, and how printmaking traditions and techniques have evolved over the centuries. On a national level, print rooms tend to differ, each having their own specialism, however collections often overlap in content.

There are links to lists of print rooms at the end of this article; most lead to the gallery's or museum's web-pages, which explain visiting arrangements. In many cases appointments need to be made in advance, and proof of identity should usually be provided. While it is helpful to outline what you would like to see (including artists' names and catalogue numbers, which may be available online or in books), visitors are also usually welcome to discuss their needs more casually by phoning or emailing in advance of their appointment. It is important to remember that not all material will be available to view, depending on current loans and exhibitions commitments and the condition of works.  Some especially fragile or valuable items may not normally be available for viewing.

Within the print room setting rules and regulations will vary from institution to institution. Some print rooms may allow visitors to photograph works (without a flash), while others may permit sketching. Though the V&amp;A's Prints and Drawings Study Room allows photography, Tate Britain's Prints and Drawings Rooms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/research/prints-and-drawings|title=Prints and Drawings Rooms|work=tate.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; do not - however at Tate visitors are allowed to sketch and paint in watercolour (with appropriate precautions).

Print Rooms need not be 'passive' spaces - though they are places for study (perhaps suggestive of quiet contemplation), they are also geared towards fostering creative engagement in diverse audiences. Several internationally renowned print rooms lead, or contribute to, a range of public educational programmes, including talks, tours and study days for groups. In particular, university print rooms, including those of the [[Yale University Art Gallery]], are regularly set aside for art historical lectures.

== Often not in the expected museum ==
[[File:Hokusai 1760-1849 Ocean waves.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ukiyo-e]] coloured [[woodcut]] by [[Hokusai]]]]
Because of the historical development of museums, and also funding, prints and drawings are sometimes associated with [[library]] collections rather than collections of paintings. For example, in Paris the main print (but not drawings) collection is in the [[Bibliotheque Nationale de France]], not the [[Louvre]]. In New York and Washington, both the main art museums ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and [[National Gallery of Art Washington]]) and the libraries ([[New York Public Library]] and [[Library of Congress]]) all have important, though very different, collections. Sometimes, material from non-Western traditions - in particular, Asian material, including Japanese prints - may or may not be held in the same department, or the same institution.

In the US public libraries are officially more accessible than art museum print rooms,  which are often privately funded and only open to academic researchers. But most public libraries with prints and drawings collections tend to house these in discrete rooms, where they are tended to by specialist works on paper curators (see, for example, the Art and Architecture Room and Prints and Photographs Room of [[New York Public Library]]).

In the UK national collections of art on paper are, in the main, publicly funded and thus widely accessible in gallery and museum print rooms; they rarely form part of library holdings. The UK's main collection of Western prints and drawings is held in the [[British Museum]] and includes fine examples by the Old Masters. The [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]] holds no works on paper; only paintings and sculptures of the European tradition. Originally known as the national gallery of British art, [[Tate Britain]] holds British prints and drawings, which include the world's largest collection of watercolours, sketches and engravings by JMW Turner, historic works on paper from the late 18th and 19th centuries, and modern and contemporary British and International prints. The [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]'s works on paper collection has a particularly broad remit, encompassing works of fine and applied art (including posters) as well as ephemera.

When the British Museum's main collection and library collection separated in 1997, evinced by the establishment of the [[British Library]] (on separate premises in St Pancras), art on paper remained within the British Museum's Department of Prints and Drawings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/departments/prints_and_drawings.aspx|title=British Museum - Prints and Drawings|work=britishmuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; with, for example, the exception of the library's East India Company collection which largely comprises maps and topographical drawings, now held within the Asia, Pacific and Africa Department of the British Library. Because of a decision in the late 19th century, where the bulk of the collection of topographical prints were classed with maps and put under the British Museum Library rather than the Prints and Drawings Department, these are now also in the British Library. The decision reflected the traditional view going back to the Renaissance that [[fine art]] required the use of the imagination, and that mere illustration of real scenes (often in practice considerably rearranged by the artist) did not qualify.

When, conversely, the Victoria and Albert Museum united its art and library collections, with the establishment of the Word and Image division, the Prints and Drawings Study Rooms and the National Art Library, however, remained discrete entities, each with their own specialist staff (with different areas of academic and professional training) and facilities and services catered to the public's and collections' needs.

One of the relatively few print rooms to exist as a separate institution (rather than as part of a larger museum or library), the [[Albertina (Vienna)]] is by general consent the world's greatest collection of Western art on paper. The [[Kupferstichkabinett Berlin|Berlin Kupferstichkabinett]] at [[Kulturforum]] is, similarly, a major museum with an exclusive focus on prints and drawings.  Though housed in the same building as the main paintings collection, the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]], it has separate direction and administration.  (The [[list of museums with major collections of European prints and drawings]] has some very incomplete figures on the holdings of major collections.)

[[File:Titian - Diana and Actaeon - 1556-1559.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Diana and Actaeon (Titian)|''Diana and Actaeon'']] by [[Titian]] has a full provenance covering its passage through several owners and four countries since it was painted for [[Philip II of Spain]] in the 1550s.]]

'''Provenance''' (from the [[French language|French]] ''provenir'', 'to come from/forth') is the chronology of the ownership, custody or location of a historical object.&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]'': "The fact of coming from some particular source or quarter; source, derivation"&lt;/ref&gt; The term was originally mostly used in relation to [[works of art]] but is now used in similar senses in a wide range of fields, including [[archaeology]], [[paleontology]], [[archive]]s, [[manuscript]]s, printed books and science and computing. The primary purpose of tracing the provenance of an object or entity is normally to provide contextual and circumstantial evidence for its original production or discovery, by establishing, as far as practicable, its later history, especially the sequences of its formal ownership, [[chain of custody|custody]] and places of storage. The practice has a particular value in helping [[Authentication|authenticate]] objects. Comparative techniques, expert opinions and the results of scientific tests may also be used to these ends, but establishing provenance is essentially a matter of [[document]]ation. The term dates to the 1780s in English. Provenance is conceptually comparable to the legal term ''[[chain of custody]]''.

In [[archaeology]] and [[paleontology]], the derived term '''provenience''' is used with a related but very particular meaning, to refer to the location (in modern research, recorded precisely in three dimensions) where an artifact or other ancient item was found.&lt;ref name="nps"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130210004312/http://www.nps.gov/history/seac/terms.htm Selected Archeological Terms, National Park Service (Internet archive)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Provenance'' covers an object's complete documented history. An artifact may thus have both a provenience and a provenance.

==Works of art and antiques==
The provenance of works of [[fine art]], antiques and [[antiquities]] is of great importance, especially to their owner. There are a number of reasons why painting provenance is important, which mostly also apply to other types of fine art. A good provenance increases the value of a painting, and establishing provenance may help confirm the date, artist and, especially for portraits, the subject of a painting. It may confirm whether a painting is genuinely of the period it seems to date from. The provenance of paintings can help resolve ownership disputes. For example, provenance between 1933 and 1945 can determine whether a painting was looted by the Nazis. Many galleries are putting a great deal of effort into researching the provenance of paintings in their collections for which there is no firm provenance during that period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalmuseums.org.uk/what-we-do/contributing-sector/spoliation/ National Museum Directors' Conference]&lt;/ref&gt; Documented evidence of provenance for an object can help to establish that it has not been altered and is not a forgery, a reproduction, [[art theft|stolen]] or [[looted art]]. Provenance helps assign the work to a known artist, and a documented history can be of use in helping to prove ownership. An example of a detailed provenance is given in [[Arnolfini Portrait#Provenance|the Arnolfini portrait]].

The quality of provenance of an important work of art can make a considerable difference to its selling price in the market; this is affected by the degree of certainty of the provenance, the status of past owners as collectors, and in many cases by the strength of evidence that an object has not been illegally excavated or exported from another country. The provenance of a work of art may vary greatly in length, depending on context or the amount that is known, from a single name to an entry in a scholarly catalogue some thousands of words long.

An expert [[certification]] can mean the difference between an object having no value and being worth a fortune. Certifications themselves may be open to question. [[Jacques van Meegeren]] forged the work of his father [[Han van Meegeren]] (who in his turn had forged the work of [[Vermeer]]). Jacques sometimes produced a certificate with his forgeries stating that a work was created by his father.

[[John Drewe]] was able to pass off as genuine paintings, a large number of forgeries that would have easily been recognised as such by scientific examination. He established an impressive (but false) provenance and because of this galleries and dealers accepted the paintings as genuine. He created this false provenance by forging letters and other documents, including false entries in earlier exhibition catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum-security.org/myatt-drewe.htm A 20th Century Master Scam]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes provenance can be as simple as a photograph of the item with its original owner. Simple yet definitive documentation such as that can increase its value by an order of magnitude, but only if the owner was of high renown. Many items that were sold at auction have gone far past their estimates because of a photograph showing that item with a famous person. Some examples include antiques owned by politicians, musicians, artists, actors, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkauctions.com/a-2-6-million-lesson-about-provenance/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Researching the provenance of paintings===
[[File:SirWilliamPetre.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|[[William Petre|Sir William Petre]], 1567: artist unknown. By the turn of the 17th century, this portrait was in the [[Lumley inventories|collection]] of [[John Lumley, 1st Baron Lumley|John, 1st Baron Lumley]], a fact indicated by the ''cartellino'' (a ''[[trompe-l'œil]]'' representation of an inscribed label) added to the painting at upper right. It is now in the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]]]]
The objective of provenance research is to produce a complete list of owners (together, where possible, with the supporting documentary proof) from when the painting was commissioned or in the artist's studio through to the present time. In practice, there are likely to be gaps in the list and documents that are missing or lost. The documented provenance should also list when the painting has been part of an exhibition and a [[bibliography]] of when it has been discussed (or illustrated) in print.

Where the research is proceeding backwards, to discover the previous provenance of a painting whose current ownership and location is known, it is important to record the physical details of the painting – style, subject, signature, materials, dimensions, frame, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Lisa, ''An Art Provenance Research Guide'' available at [http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/s_papers&amp;CISOPTR=1071&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=15 University of North Carolina Master's Papers] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120707092307/http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/s_papers&amp;CISOPTR=1071&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=15 |date=2012-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The titles of paintings and the attribution to a particular artist may change over time. The size of the work and its description can be used to identify earlier references to the painting. The back of a painting can contain significant provenance information. There may be exhibition marks, dealer stamps, gallery labels and other indications of previous ownership. There may also be shipping labels. In the BBC TV programme ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'' the provenance of the painting ''[[Bords de la Seine à Argenteuil]]'' was investigated using a gallery sticker and shipping label on the back. Early provenance can sometimes be indicated by a ''cartellino'' (a representation of an inscribed label) added to the front of a painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/cartellino |title=Cartellino |publisher=The National Gallery |location=London |work=Glossary |accessdate=31 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these can be forged, or can fade or be painted over.

Auction records are an important resource to assist in researching the provenance of paintings. 
*The [[Witt Library]] houses a collection of cuttings from auction catalogs which enables the researcher to identify occasions when a picture has been sold. 
*The Heinz Library at the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]] maintains a similar collection, but restricted to portraits. 
*The National Art Library at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] has a collection of UK sales catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/a/study-guide-art-auction-sales-sales-catalogues-price-guides/ V&amp;A Study Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The University of York is establishing a web site with on-line resources for investigating art history in the period 1660–1735.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artworld.york.ac.uk/news.jsp The Art World in Britain 1660-1735]&lt;/ref&gt; This includes diaries, sales catalogues, bills, correspondence and inventories.  
*The [[Getty Research Institute]] in Los Angeles has a ''Project for the Study of Collecting and Provenance'' (PSCP) which includes an on-line database, still being compiled, of auction and other records relating to painting provenance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/provenance/charts.html Provenance Index Databases]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The [[Frick Art Reference Library]] in New York has an extensive collection of auction and exhibition catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frick.org/library/index.htm Frick Library]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] (RKD) has a number of databases related to artists from the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.rkd.nl/Databases Netherlands Institute for Art History Databases]&lt;/ref&gt;

If a painting has been in private hands for an extended period and on display in a [[stately home]], it may be recorded in an inventory – for example, the [[Lumley inventories|Lumley inventory]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dynasties'', a catalogue of an exhibition at the Tate Gallery, Karen Hearn, page 158&lt;/ref&gt; The painting may also have been noticed by a visitor who subsequently wrote about it. It may have been mentioned in a will or a diary. Where the painting has been bought from a dealer, or changed hands in a private transaction, there may be a bill of sale or sales receipt that provides evidence of provenance. Where the artist is known, there may be a [[catalogue raisonné]] listing all the artist's known works and their location at the time of writing. A database of catalogues raisonnés is available at the [http://www.ifar.org/cat_rais.php International Foundation for Art Research]. Historic photos of the painting may be discussed and illustrated in a more general work on the artist, period or genre. Similarly, a photograph of a painting may show inscriptions (or a signature) that subsequently became lost as a result of overzealous restoration. Conversely, a photograph may show that an inscription was not visible at an earlier date. One of the disputed aspects of the [[Ozias Humphry|"Rice" portrait]] of [[Jane Austen]] concerns apparent inscriptions identifying artist and sitter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arthistorynews.com/ Bendor Grosvenor blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archives==
[[File:BRA stamp.jpg|thumb|right|Stamp on a historic document, showing that it has passed through the hands of the Records Preservation Section of the [[British Records Association]], a rescue service for archival material: the number indicates its earlier provenance]]
Provenance – also known as "custodial history" – is a core concept of [[archival science]] and [[archival processing]]. The term refers to the individuals, groups, or organizations that originally created or received the items in an accumulation of records, and to the items' subsequent [[chain of custody]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Kerstin |editor1-last=Abukhanfusa |editor2-first=Jan |editor2-last=Sydbeck |title=The Principle of Provenance: report from the First Stockholm Conference on Archival Theory and the Principle of Provenance, 2–3 September 1993 |location=Stockholm |publisher=Swedish National Archives |year=1994 |isbn=9789188366115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of provenance (sometimes also termed the principle of ''archival integrity'' or ''[[respect des fonds]]'') stipulates that records originating from a common source (or [[fonds]]) should be kept together – where practicable, physically; but in all cases intellectually, in the way in which they are catalogued and arranged in [[finding aid]]s. Conversely, records of different provenance should be preserved and documented separately. In archival practice, proof of provenance is provided by the operation of control systems that document the history of records kept in archives, including details of amendments made to them. The authority of an archival document or set of documents of which the provenance is uncertain (because of gaps in the recorded chain of custody) will be considered to be severely compromised.

The principles of archival provenance were developed in the 19th century by both French and Prussian archivists, and gained widespread acceptance on the basis of their formulation in the ''Manual for the Arrangement and Description of Archives'' by Dutch state archivists Samuel Muller, J. A. Feith, and R. Fruin, published in the Netherlands in 1898 (often referred to as the "[[Archival appraisal#History of appraisal theory|Dutch Manual]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Douglas |first=Jennifer |year=2010 |chapter=Origins: evolving ideas about the principle of provenance |title=Currents of Archival Thinking |editor1-first=Terry |editor1-last=Eastwood |editor1-link=Terry Eastwood |editor2-first=Heather |editor2-last=MacNeil |location=Santa Barbara, Calif. |publisher=Libraries Unlimited |isbn=9781591586562 |pages=23-43 (27-28) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seamus Ross has argued a case for adapting established principles and theories of archival provenance to the field of modern digital preservation and curation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ross |first=Seamus |year=2012 |title=Digital Preservation, Archival Science and Methodological Foundations for Digital Libraries |journal=New Review of Information Networking |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=43-68 (esp. 50-53) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Provenance'' is also the title of the journal published by the Society of Georgia Archivists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitalcommons.kennesaw.edu/provenance/ |title=Provenance, Journal of the Society of Georgia Archivists }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
In the case of books, the study of provenance refers to the study of the ownership of individual copies of books. It is usually extended to include study of the circumstances in which individual copies of books have changed ownership, and of evidence left in books that shows how readers interacted with them.&lt;ref name="Pearson"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Pearson  | first = David  | title = Provenance Research in Book History: a Handbook  | publisher = British Library  | year = 1998 | page=132 | isbn=978-0-7123-4598-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearson2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Pearson, David |chapter=Provenance and Rare Book Cataloguing: Its Importance and Its Challenges | pages=1–9|editor=Shaw, David J. | title=Books and Their Owners: Provenance Information and The European Cultural Heritage |publisher=[[Consortium of European Research Libraries]] | year=2005 |isbn=0-9541535-3-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Provenance studies may shed light on the books themselves, providing evidence of the role particular titles have played in social, intellectual and literary history. Such studies may also add to our knowledge of particular owners of books. For instance, looking at the books owned by a writer may help to show which works influenced him or her.

Many provenance studies are historically focused, and concentrated on books owned by writers, politicians and public figures. The recent ownership of books is studied, however, as is evidence of how ordinary or anonymous readers have interacted with books.&lt;ref name="Curwen"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Curwen, Tony  |author2=Jonsson, Gunilla  |lastauthoramp=yes |chapter=Provenance and the Itinerary of the Book: Recording Provenance Data in On-line Catalogues | pages=31–47|editor=Shaw, David J. | title=Imprints and Owners: Recording the Cultural Geography of Europe |publisher=Consortium of European Research Libraries | year=2007 |isbn=978-0-9541535-6-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Jackson  | first = H. J.  | title = Marginalia: Readers Writing in Books  | publisher = Yale University Press  | year = 2001 | page=2 | isbn=978-0-300-08816-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Provenance can be studied both by examining the books themselves (for instance looking at inscriptions, [[marginalia]], [[bookplate]]s, [[book rhyme]]s, and bindings) and by reference to external sources of information such as auction catalogues.&lt;ref name="Pearson"/&gt;

==Wines==
In transactions of old wine with the potential of [[Storage of wine|improving with age]], the issue of provenance has a large bearing on the assessment of the contents of a bottle, both in terms of quality and the risk of [[wine fraud]]. A documented history of [[wine cellar]] conditions is valuable in estimating the quality of an older vintage due to the fragile nature of wine.&lt;ref name=OCW-ageing&gt;winepros.com.au. {{Cite web|last= ''Oxford Companion to Wine''| title= ageing |url= http://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/reference/oxford_entry.jsp?entry_id=30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent technology developments have aided collectors in assessing the temperature and humidity history or the wine which are two key components in establishing perfect provenance. For example, there are devices available that rest inside the wood case and can be read through the wood by waving a smartphone equipped with a simple app. These devices track the conditions the case has been exposed to for the duration of the battery life, which can be as long as 15 years, and sends a graph and high/low readings to the smartphone user. This takes the trust issue out of the hands of the owner and gives it to a third party for verification.

==Science==

===Archaeology, anthropology, and paleontology===
[[Archaeology]] and [[anthropology]] researchers use ''provenience'' to refer to the exact location or '''find spot''' of an [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]], a bone or other remains, a soil sample, or a feature within an ancient site,&lt;ref name="nps" /&gt; whereas ''provenance'' covers an object's complete documented history. Ideally, in modern excavations, the provenience is recorded in three dimensions on a site grid with great precision, and may also be recorded on video to provide additional proof and context. In older work, often undertaken by amateurs, only the general site or approximate area may be known, especially when an artifact was found outside a professional excavation and its specific position not recorded. The term ''provenience'' appeared in the 1880s, about a century after ''provenance''. Outside of academic contexts, it has been used as a [[synonym]]ous variant spelling of ''provenance'', especially in [[American English]].

Any given antiquity may have both a provenience (where it was found) and a provenance (where it has been since it was found). A summary of the distinction is that "provenience is a fixed point, while provenance can be considered an itinerary that an object follows as it moves from hand to hand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Rosemary A. |last=Joyce |chapter=From Place to Place: Provenience, Provenance, and Archaeology |title=Provenance: An Alternate History of Art |editor1-first=Gail |editor1-last=Feigenbaum |editor2-first=Inge |editor2-last=Jackson Reist |date=2012 |page=48 |publisher=Getty Research Institute |series=Issues &amp; Debates |isbn=978-1606061220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another metaphor is that provenience is an artifact's "birthplace", while provenance is its "[[résumé]]",&lt;ref name="Hirst"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.thoughtco.com/provenience-vs-provenance-3971058 |first=K. Kris |last=Hirst |date=December 22, 2016 |title=Provenience, Provenance, Let's Call the Whole Thing Off: What is the difference in meaning between provenience and provenance? |work=ThoughtCo |publisher=Dotdash/IAC |access-date=September 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this is imprecise (many artifacts originated as trade goods created in one region but were used and finally deposited in another).

Aside from scientific precision, a need for the distinction in these fields has been described thus:&lt;ref name="Hirst" /&gt;
{{blockquote|1=Archaeologists ... don't care who owned an object—they are more interested in the context of an object within the community of its (mostly original) users. ... [W]e are interested in why a Roman coin turned up in a shipwreck 400 years after it was made; while art historians don't really care, since they can generally figure out what mint a coin came from by the information stamped on its surface. "It's a Roman coin, what else do we need to know?" says an art historian; "The shipping trade in the Mediterranean region during late Roman times" says an archaeologist. ... [P]rovenance for an art historian is important to establish ownership, but provenience is interesting to an archaeologist to establish meaning.}}

In this context, the ''provenance'' can occasionally be the detailed history of where an object has been since its creation,&lt;ref name="Hirst" /&gt; as in art history contexts – not just since its modern finding. In some cases, such as where there is an inscription on the object, or an account of it in written materials from the same era, an object of study in archaeology or [[cultural anthropology]] may have an early provenance – a known history that predates modern research – then a provenience from its modern finding, and finally a continued provenance relating to its handling and storage or display after the modern acquisition.

Evidence of provenance in the more general sense can be of importance in archaeology. Fakes are not unknown, and finds are sometimes removed from the context in which they were found without documentation, reducing their value to science. Even when apparently discovered ''[[in situ]]'', archaeological finds are treated with caution. The provenience of a find may not be properly represented by the context in which it was found (e.g. due to [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic layers]] being disturbed by erosion, earthquakes, or ancient reconstruction or other disturbance at a site. Artifacts can also be moved through looting as well as trade, far from their place of origin and long before modern rediscovery. Further research is often required to establish the true provenance of a find, and what the relationship is between the exact provenience and the overall provenance.

In [[paleontology]] and [[paleoanthropology]], it is recognized that [[fossil]]s can also move from their primary context and are sometimes found, apparently ''in-situ'', in deposits to which they do not belong because they have been moved, for example, by the erosion of nearby but different [[outcrop]]s. It is unclear how strictly paleontology maintains the ''provenience'' and ''provenance'' distinction. For example, a short glossary at a website (primarily aimed at young students) of the [[American Museum of Natural History]] treats the terms as synonymous,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://collections.paleo.amnh.org/24/glossary |publisher=American Museum of Natural History |work=PaleoPortal Collections Management |title=Glossary |author=&lt;!--Staff writers; no by-line.--&gt; |date=2009 |access-date=September 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while scholarly paleontology works make frequent use of ''provenience'' in the same precise sense as used in archaeology and paleoanthropology.

While exacting details of a find's provenience are primarily of use to scientific researchers, most natural history and archaeology museums also make strenuous efforts to record how the items in their collections were acquired. These records are often of use in helping to establish a chain of provenance.

===Data provenance===

[[Scientific research]] is generally held to be of good provenance when it is documented in detail sufficient to allow [[reproducibility]].&lt;ref&gt;Altintas, I.; Berkley, C.; Jaeger, E.; Jones, M.; Ludascher, B.; Mock S.

In that case it is the Research Data Provenance Interest Group.&lt;ref&gt;https://rd-alliance.org/groups/research-data-provenance.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer science===
Within [[computer science]], [[Information science|informatics]] uses the term 'provenance'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tan|first=Yu Shyang|last2=Ko|first2=Ryan K.L.|last3=Holmes|first3=Geoff|date=November 2013|title=Security and Data Accountability in Distributed Systems: A Provenance Survey|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6832103/|journal=2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications &amp; 2013 IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing|language=en-US|publisher=IEEE|doi=10.1109/hpcc.and.euc.2013.221|isbn=9780769550886}}&lt;/ref&gt; to mean the [[Data lineage|lineage of data]], as per data provenance, with research in the last decade extending the conceptual model of causality and relation to include processes that act on data and agents that are responsible for those processes. See, for example, the proceedings of the International Provenance Annotation Workshop (IPAW)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipaw.info/&lt;/ref&gt; and Theory and Practice of Provenance (TaPP).&lt;ref&gt;http://workshops.inf.ed.ac.uk/tapp2015/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Semantic web]] standards bodies, including the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] in 2014, have ratified a standard data model for provenance representation known as PROV&lt;ref&gt;http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/&lt;/ref&gt; which draws from many of the better-known provenance representation systems that preceded it, such as the [[Proof Markup Language]] and the Open Provenance Model.&lt;ref&gt;http://openprovenance.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Interoperability is a design goal of most recent computer science provenance theories and models, for example the Open Provence Model (OPM) 2008 generation workshop aimed at "establishing inter-operability of systems" through information exchange agreements.&lt;ref&gt;Moreau et al. (2008) The Open Provenance Model: An Overview, in J. Freire, D. Koop, and L. Moreau (Eds.): IPAW 2008, LNCS 5272, pp. 323–326, 2008. Springer. [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.148.7394&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Data models and serialisation formats for delivering provenance information typically reuse existing metadata models where possible to enable this. Both the OPM Vocabulary&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, J. (2010) "[http://purl.org/net/opmv/ns Open Provenance Model Vocabulary Specification]", accessed 2016-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt; and the PROV Ontology&lt;ref&gt;Lebo et al. (eds.)

===Petrology===
{{See also|Provenance (geology)}}
[[Image:QFLtriangle.jpg|thumb|A [[QFL diagram]] (Quartz, Feldspar, Lithic fragments) used to determine [[tectonic]] provenance in sandstones]]
In the [[geologic]] use of the term, provenance instead refers to the origin or source area of particles within a rock, most commonly in [[sedimentary rocks]]. It does not refer to the circumstances of the collection of the rock. The provenance of sandstone, in particular, can be evaluated by determining the proportion of quartz, feldspar, and lithic fragments (see diagram).

===Seed provenance===
Seed provenance refers to the specified area in which plants that produced seed are located or were derived. Local provenancing is a position maintained by ecologists that suggests that only seeds of local provenance should be planted in a particular area. However, this view depends on the [[adaptationist program]] – a view that populations are universally locally adapted.&lt;ref&gt;Gould S. J.; Lewontin; R. C. (1979). "The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme". ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series B: Biological Sciences'', 205: 581-598&lt;/ref&gt; It is maintained that local seed is best [[Adaptation|adapted]] to local conditions, and that [[outbreeding depression]] will be avoided. [[Evolutionary biologists]] suggest that strict adherence to provenance collecting is not a wise decision because:
# Local adaptation is not as common as assumed.&lt;ref name="Gould &amp; Lewontin 1979"&gt;Gould &amp; Lewontin 1979&lt;/ref&gt;
# Background population [[maladaptation]] can be driven by natural processes.&lt;ref name="Gould &amp; Lewontin 1979"/&gt;
# Human actions of [[habitat fragmentation]] drive maladaptation up and adaptive potential down.&lt;ref&gt;Willi Y, Van Buskirk J, Hoffmann AA (2006) Limits to the adaptive potential of small populations. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics 37: 433-458.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Natural selection]] is changing rapidly due to [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;Parmesan C (2006) Ecological and evolutionary responses to recent climate change. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics 37: 637-669.&lt;/ref&gt; and habitat fragmentation
# Population fragments are unlikely to divergence by natural selection since fragmentation (&lt;&amp;nbsp;500 years). This leads to a low risk of outbreeding depression.&lt;ref&gt;Frankham R, Ballou J, Eldridge M, Lacy R, Ralls K, et al. (2011) Predicting the probability of outbreeding depression. Conservation Biology.&lt;/ref&gt;

Provenance trials, where material of different provenances are planted in a single place or at different locations spanning a range of environmental conditions, is a way to reveal [[genetic variation]] among provenances. It also contributes to an understanding of how different provenances respond to various climatic and environmental conditions and can as such contribute with knowledge on how to strategically select provenances for [[climate change adaptation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Konnert, M., Fady, B., Gömöry, D., A’Hara, S., Wolter, F., Ducci, F. Koskela, J., Bozzano, M., Maaten, T. and Kowalczyk, J.|title=Use and transfer of forest reproductive material in Europe in the context of climate change|journal=[[European Forest Genetic Resources Programme]] (EUFORGEN), Bioversity International, Rome, Italy|date=2015|page=xvi and 75 p|url=http://www.euforgen.org/fileadmin/templates/euforgen.org/upload/Publications/Thematic_publications/EUFORGEN_FRM_use_transfer.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computers and law==
The term ''provenance'' is used when ascertaining the source of goods such as computer hardware to assess if they are genuine or counterfeit. [[Chain of custody]] is an equivalent term used in law, especially for evidence in criminal or commercial cases.

Software provenance encompasses the origin of software and its [[Software license|licensing terms]]. For example, when incorporating a free, open source or proprietary software component in an application, one may wish to understand its provenance to ensure that licensing requirements are fulfilled and that other software characteristics can be understood.

Data provenance covers the provenance of computerized data. There are two main aspects of data provenance: ownership of the data and data usage. Ownership will tell the user who is responsible for the source of the data, ideally including information on the originator of the data. Data usage gives details regarding how the data has been used and modified and often includes information on how to cite the data source or sources. Data provenance is of particular concern with electronic data, as data sets are often modified and copied without proper citation or acknowledgement of the originating data set. Databases make it easy to select specific information from data sets and merge this data with other data sources without any documentation of how the data was obtained or how it was modified from the original data set or sets.&lt;ref name="Ma, et al." /&gt;
The automated analysis of data provenance graphs has been described as a mean to verify compliance with regulations regarding data usage such as introduced by the EU [[General_Data_Protection_Regulation|GDPR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pasquier |first1=Thomas |last2=Singh |first2=Jatinder |last3=Powles |first3=Julia |last4=Eyers |first4=David |last5=Seltzer |first5=Margo |last6=Bacon |first6=Jean |title=Data provenance to audit compliance with privacy policy in the Internet of Things |journal=Personal and Ubiquitous Computing |date=1 April 2018 |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=333–344 |doi=10.1007/s00779-017-1067-4 |url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3210921 |issn=1617-4909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secure Provenance refers to providing integrity and confidentiality guarantees to provenance information. In other words, secure provenance means to ensure that history cannot be rewritten, and users can specify who else can look into their actions on the object.&lt;ref name="fast09"&gt;[http://www.usenix.org/events/fast09/tech/full_papers/hasan/hasan_html/index.html The Case of the Fake Picasso: Preventing History Forgery with Secure Provenance], Hasan et al., USENIX FAST 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title=Chaining for securing data provenance in distributed information networks | author=Xinlei (Oscar) Wang, Kai Zeng, Kannan Govindan and Prasant Mohapatra. | booktitle=In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference for Military Communications. | year=2012 | conference=MILCOM '12 | DOI=10.1109/MILCOM.2012.6415609}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple method of ensuring data provenance in computing is to mark a file as [[File system permissions#Permissions|read only]]. This allows the user to view the contents of the file, but not edit or otherwise modify it. Read only can also in some cases prevent the user from accidentally or intentionally [[File deletion#Problem with accidental removal|deleting the file]].

'''Punchinello Players''', founded in 1914, was a [[theatre]] organization of the [[University of Minnesota]]. When it closed it was the second oldest student-run [[community theater]] in the U.S.&lt;ref name=UNS&gt;{{cite web|title=UNM News Service 4.19.82|publisher=University of Minnesota News Service|accessdate=December 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Punchinello - located on the [[University of Minnesota#St. Paul campus|St. Paul campus]] - originated for the purpose of improving the lives of the greater community, and as a University-associated theater it continued that purpose throughout its existence via production of chosen works.&lt;ref name=Manhood&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Country Plays with Country Players|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wiREAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA417&amp;dq=back+to+the+farm+minnesota+rural+manhood&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK4ZSg0MPYAhWK5oMKHTmqDaoQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=back%20to%20the%20farm%20minnesota%20rural%20manhood&amp;f=false|journal=’Rural Manhood: Devoted to the County (Rural) work of the Young Men’s Christian Associations in Village, Town and Open Country |publisher=The International Committee of Young Men’s Christian Associations, New York |date=January 1918 |accessdate=December 30, 2017 |pages=417–418}}&lt;/ref&gt; Punchinello Players closed in 1994 due primarily to its home, North Hall (formerly a student dormitory), being slated for demolition.

==Debut==
'''Back to the Farm'''

''Back to the Farm'' was a two-year production (1913–1915) written by School of Agriculture student Merline H. Shumway and directed by Estelle Cook &lt;ref name=Manhood /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bookdepository.com/Back-Farm-Merline-H-Merline-Henderson-Shumway/9781360495736 Back to the Farm : A Play in Three Acts]&lt;/ref&gt; to create awareness of the University's new Agricultural Extension Program &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1= |first1= |authorlink= | title=Exension History|url=https://www.extension.umn.edu/about/history/|work=[[University of Minnesota]] |accessdate=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the rural communities of [[Minnesota]]. 
''Back to the Farm'' was created to demonstrate the value of scientifically trained farmers. It centers around a farm family in which the father is an old-school farmer, who isn't open to his sons' new ideas about how to do things. The son leaves the farm and enrolls at a nearby agricultural college for their 4-year program. They mend their relationship and he returns to the farm, implementing what he's learned - with the result that the farm becomes the most productive in the state.&lt;ref name="Card"&gt;{{cite book|title= The Gopher: Annual Publication of the Student Body of the University of Minnesota|volume=39|location=Minneapolis, Minnesota|work= University of Minnesota|date=1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|426}} 
Initially presented at County Fairs around the state, its popularity exceeded expectations and the play continued to tour at farmers' institutes and other educational sessions, eventually being performed fifty times in the first year and many more times for years afterwards.{{refn|group=note| From notes of a freshman: October 11. Saw “Back the Farm” in chapel, and nearly died laughing. Ted Thorson as “Gus” is certainly a card.&lt;ref name="Card"/&gt;}}{{rp|58}}  Follow-up plays including ''Kindling the Hearth Fire'' and ''Partners'' - written/directed by Shumway, Cook and others - were also well received, and in those years a set of plays were created, performed and made available in bulletin form for communities to perform themselves.&lt;ref name=Extension&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Suggested Plays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=52hRAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq |journal= Extension Circular |volume=1 |publisher=South Dakota State College |date=January 1918 |accessdate=December 30, 2017 |pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ADWilson&gt;{{cite magazine |title=University Extension – The Agricultural Extension Division |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q5POAAAAMAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|journal= ''President’s Report'' |volume=21 |issue=37 |publisher=[[University of Minnesota]] |date=1918 |accessdate=December 30, 2017 |pages=129–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pageant&gt;{{cite magazine |title= Minnesota Extension Service News. |url= https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/174490s | volume=1 |issue=1 |publisher=University of Minnesota, Department of Agriculture, Extension Division |date=October 1921 |accessdate=December 30, 2017 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Agricultural Extension Program (along with General Extension, founded 4 years later in 1913) was instituted to increase the university's outreach. [[George Edgar Vincent]] - University President from 1911-1917 - put in place innovative programming including 'University Weeks' with plays, lectures, concerts and debates similar to the [[Chautauqua Institute]] he had previously led, in the spirit of increasing educational and cultural opportunities for the general public.&lt;ref name=Vincent&gt;{{cite web|title=Presidential History|url=https://president.umn.edu/about/presidential-history/george-edgar-vincent|publisher=University of Minnesota|accessdate=December 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chautauqua&gt;{{cite book| last1= |first1=|authorlink= | title=’ ‘The Pursuit of Knowledge under Difficulties: From Self-Improvement to Adult Education in America, 1750-1990.”|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BjGrAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA573&amp;dq=minnesota+The+pursuit+of+knowledge+under+difficulties+:+from+self-improvement+to+adult+education+in+America,+1750-1990.%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi8-IGg-MTYAhVD9IMKHeFaCKwQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=minnesota&amp;f=false|work=[[Stanford University Press]] |date=1994|page=291 |accessdate=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=150years&gt;{{cite book| last1=Lehmberg |first1=Stanford |authorlink=Stanford Lehmberg| last2=Pflaum|first2=Ann M. |authorlink2=Ann M.

Those initial rural productions of ''Back to the Farm'' launched the existence of Punchinello Players in 1914, originally under the name the Minnesota Agriculture Dramatic Club. The organization changed its name to Punchinello Players in 1923.&lt;ref name=snac&gt;{{cite web|title=Punchinello Players|url=http://snaccooperative.org/ark:/99166/w6bd25ct|publisher=Snac Cooperative|accessdate=December 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Faculty Advisors==

The first committed, long-term faculty advisor of Punchinello was William J.

Starting with the 1941-1942 school year, Francis E. Drake was Faculty Advisor, but Punchinello - like many University organizations - was largely dormant during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;"The University of Minnesota Directory of Student Organizations", Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Punchinello's faculty advisor and frequent production director for over three decades was William M. Marchand, Humanities Professor of the Rhetoric Department, [[CFANS]].&lt;ref name=Legacy&gt;{{cite web|title=William Marchand Obituary|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/twincities/obituary.aspx?pid=181696415|publisher=Pioneer Press|accessdate=December 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ParkBugle&gt;{{cite web|title=William Marchand Obit|url=http://www.parkbugle.org/william-marchand/|publisher=Park Bugle|accessdate=December 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bill Marchand had a PhD in theatre, and prior to coming to the University in 1960 he had co-founded the Paul Bunyan Theatre, a summer theatre in [[Bemidji]].&lt;ref name=MNDaily_Baumann&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Baumann |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Baumann|title='Born in 1914, Punchinello Players is still young at heart'|work=[[Minnesota Daily]]|date=October 13, 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==North Hall==

Punchinello took over the former cafeteria area of North Hall (formerly a dormitory) in the 1960s, while [[O. Meredith Wilson]] was president.

Punchinello had operated out of various spaces prior to that point, including the Ag Auditorium during the 1940s and one of the World War II -era temporary buildings on the St. Paul Campus through the 1960s.&lt;ref name='42 Gopher'/&gt;

When Wilson became aware of that, he felt that something better could be arranged. Soon, Punchinello had a new home.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite web|title=O.

==Theater Genre==

Punchinello mainly performed traditional classics as well as some musicals, and the occasional newer work. Among the rare melodrama/related productions were ''[[Kind Lady (play)|Kind Lady]]'' by [[Edward Chodorov]], in 1942.&lt;ref name='42 Gopher'/&gt; and ''[[Dracula]]'' (from the novel by [[Bram Stoker]]) in 1969.&lt;ref name=1969UMN&gt;{{cite web| title = UMN Press Releases | website = UMN Conservancy | publisher = [[University of Minnesota]] News Service | date = 1969 | url = https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/51858| access-date = December 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comedies have included ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'' by [[Oscar Wilde]] in 1973 and ''[[Hay Fever]]'' by [[Noel Coward]] in 1978.&lt;ref name=73-74&gt;{{cite web| title = UMN Press Releases | website = UMN Conservancy | publisher = [[University of Minnesota]] News Service | date = 1973 | url = https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/51875| access-date = December 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=78-79&gt;{{cite web| title = UMN Press Releases | website = UMN Conservancy | publisher = [[University of Minnesota]] News Service | date = 1978 | url = https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/51894/1978October-DecemberPressReleases.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y| access-date = December 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Punchinello produced the [[Metatheatre|metatheatrical]] play [[Our Town]] by [[Thornton Wilder]] in 1969.

Punchinello often explored social issues, with sell-out productions such as ''[[The Crucible]]'' by [[Arthur Miller]] and ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' by [[Samuel Beckett]] in 1983,&lt;ref name=Wtr83&gt;{{cite web| title = UMN Press Releases | website = UMN Conservancy | publisher = [[University of Minnesota]] News Service | date = 1983 | url = https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/51968/1983January-MarchPressReleases.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y| access-date = December 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as lesser known works including ''Play with a Tiger'' by [[Doris Lessing]] in 1979 and ''[[The Shadow Box|Shadow Box]]'' by [[Michael Cristofer]] in 1982.&lt;ref name=78-79 /&gt;

The students who were involved often were sometimes but not always theater majors, representing the range of disciplines within the University.&lt;ref name="MNDaily_Roberts"/&gt;

==Finale==
Its final two productions continued that tradition: [[William Saroyan]]'s ''[[The Time of Your Life]]'' was the second-to-last production. The final production, directed by William Marchand, was [[Thornton Wilder]]'s ''[[Our Town]]''.&lt;ref name=Curtains&gt;{{cite web|title=It's curtains for Punchinello Players|url=http://parkbugle.org.s3.amazonaws.com/backissues/1994/02.pdf|publisher=ParkBugle|accessdate=December 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Reasons and Persons'''''  is a 1984 [[philosophy|philosophical]] work by [[Derek Parfit]], in which the author discusses [[ethics]], [[rationality]] and [[personal identity]].

It is divided into four parts, dedicated to self-defeating theories, rationality and time, personal identity and responsibility toward future generations.

==Self-defeating theories==

Part 1 argues that certain ethical theories are ''self-defeating''. One such theory is [[ethical egoism]], which Parfit claims is 'collectively self-defeating' due to the [[prisoner's dilemma]]. Ultimately, Parfit rejects "common sense morality" on similar grounds.

In this section, Parfit does not explicitly endorse a particular view; rather, he shows what the problems of different theories are. His only positive endorsement is of "impersonal ethics" – impersonality being the common denominator of the different parts of the book.

==Rationality and time==

Part 2 focuses on the relationship between [[rationality]] and [[time]], dealing with questions such as: ''should we take into account our past desires?'', ''should I do something I will regret later, even if it seems a good idea now?'', and so on.

One of Parfit's arguments is as follows: self-interest theorists consider the differences between different persons at the same time as significant in terms of rationality, but do not consider the difference between the same person at different times to be as significant. But if, as Parfit argues, a reductionist theory of personal identity holds, then the difference between different persons at the same time is more like the difference between the same person at different times. So, if reductionism is true, [[Individualism|self-interest]] theorists are inconsistent in viewing spatial relations as significant but temporal relations insignificant. Thus, the foundations of the self-interest theory are undermined by non-reductionism, which lends support to the present-aim theory of rationality, the critical version of which Parfit favours.

==Personal identity==

Part 3 argues for a reductive account of [[personal identity]]; rather than accepting the claim that our existence is a deep, significant fact about the world, Parfit's account of personal identity is like this:

At time 1, there is a person. At a later time 2, there is a person. These people seem to be the same person. Indeed, these people share memories and personality traits. But there are no [[further facts]] in the world that make them the ''same person''.

{{anchor|teletransportation problem|Star Trek problem|}} Parfit's argument for this position relies on our intuitions regarding [[thought experiment]]s such as [[teleportation]], the fission and fusion of persons, gradual replacement of the matter in one's brain, gradual alteration of one's psychology, and so on.  For example, Parfit asks the reader to imagine entering a "teletransporter," a machine that puts you to sleep, then destroys you, breaking you down into atoms, copying the information and relaying it to Mars at the speed of light.  On Mars, another machine re-creates you (from local stores of carbon, hydrogen, and so on), each atom in exactly the same relative position.  Parfit poses the question of whether or not the teletransporter is a method of travel—is the person on Mars the ''same person'' as the person who entered the teletransporter on Earth?  Certainly, when waking up on Mars, you would feel like being you, you would remember entering the teletransporter in order to travel to Mars, you would even feel the cut on your upper lip from shaving this morning.

Then the teleporter is upgraded. The teletransporter on Earth is modified to not destroy the person who enters it, but instead it can simply make infinite replicas, all of whom would claim to remember entering the teletransporter on Earth in the first place.

Using thought experiments such as these, Parfit argues that any criteria we attempt to use to determine sameness of person will be lacking, because there is no further fact.  What matters, to Parfit, is simply "Relation R," psychological connectedness, including memory, personality, and so on.

Parfit continues this logic to establish a new context for morality and social control. He cites that it is morally wrong for one person to harm or interfere with another person and it is incumbent on society to protect individuals from such transgressions. That accepted, it is a short extrapolation to conclude that it is also incumbent on society to protect an individual's "Future Self" from such transgressions; tobacco use could be classified as an abuse of a Future Self's right to a healthy existence. Parfit resolves the logic to reach this conclusion, which appears to justify incursion into personal freedoms, but he does not explicitly endorse such invasive control.

Parfit's conclusion is similar to [[David Hume]]'s view, and also to the view of the self in [[Buddhism]], though it does not restrict itself to a mere reformulation of them. For besides being ''reductive'', Parfit's view is also ''deflationary'': in the end, "what matters" is not personal identity, but rather mental continuity and connectedness.

==Future generations==

Part 4 deals with questions of our responsibility towards future generations, also known as [[population ethics]]. It raises questions about whether it can be wrong to create a life, whether environmental destruction violates the rights of future people, and so on.

One question Parfit raises is this: given that the course of history drastically affects what people are actually born (since it affects which potential parents actually meet and have children; and also, a difference in the time of conception will alter the genetic makeup of the child), do future persons have a right to complain about our actions, since they likely wouldn't exist if things had been different?

Another problem Parfit looks at is the ''[[mere addition paradox]]'', which supposedly shows that it is better to have a lot of people who are slightly happy, than a few people who are very happy. Parfit calls this view "repugnant", but says he has not yet found a solution.

== Reception ==
[[Bernard Williams]] described ''Reasons and Persons'' as "brilliantly clever and imaginative", and commended it as part of a wave of work in [[analytic philosophy]] that deals with concrete moral problems rather than abstract meta-ethics.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Bernard|title=Personal Identity|journal=London Review of Books|date=7 June 1984|volume=6|issue=10|pages=14–15|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v06/n10/bernard-williams/personal-identity|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip Kitcher]] wrote in his review of Parfit's ''[[On What Matters]]'' that ''Reasons and Persons'' "was widely viewed as an outstanding contribution to a cluster of questions in metaphysics and ethics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kitcher|first=Philip|title=The Lure of the Peak|journal=The New Republic|date=11 January 2012|url=http://www.tnr.com/article/books/magazine/99529/on-what-matters-derek-parfit|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Singer]] included ''Reasons and Persons'' on a top ten list of favourite books in ''The Guardian'', stating that "Parfit's penetrating thought and spare prose make this one of the most exciting, if challenging, works by a contemporary philosopher".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Singer|first=Peter|title=Peter Singer's top 10 books|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/apr/06/bestbooks.philosophy|accessdate=6 April 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=6 April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sam Harris]] included it on a similar list of his own, describing the work as "incredibly insightful" and "written as though by an alien intelligence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/07/21/sam-harris-reading-list/|title=Neuroscientist Sam Harris Selects 12 Books Everyone Should Read|last=Popova|first=Maria|date=2015-07-21|work=Brain Pickings|access-date=2018-10-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Year-round, the Red Bull Music Academy maintains an online magazine, radio station (Red Bull Radio) and lecture video archive. The Academy hosts additional music workshops and club nights and curates stages at festivals in around 60 countries worldwide.

== History ==

The Academy was initiated in 1998 in [[Berlin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tantum|first=Bruce|title=Red Bull Music Academy kicks off its month-long NYC takeover.|url=http://www.timeout.com/newyork/clubs/interview-red-bull-music-academys-davide-bortot|work=Time Out New York|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has taken place annually in subsequent years in Toronto, London, São Paulo, Seattle, Cape Town, Rome, London, Melbourne, New York, Madrid, Barcelona,Tokyo, Paris, Montréal and Dublin. While the first few editions saw a greater emphasis on DJ culture, the program and recording facilities now accommodate all genres and aspects of the musical spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gentles|first=Tim|title=RBMA NYC Report|url=http://www.dummymag.com/reviews/rbma-nyc-report-review|work=Dummy|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prospective applicants to the Academy must prepare a demo CD of their work, be it original productions, songs or a DJ set, along with a completed questionnaire, and mail it to a Red Bull Music Academy office in [[Cologne]], Germany. From there, each application is taken into consideration, with no quota on country or musical genre. From these applications, 60 are selected and broken down into two groups of 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Roper|first=Chris|title=Just Do Your Own Thing|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2011-12-02-just-do-your-own-thing|newspaper=Mail &amp; Guardian|date=2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each group of 30 is flown in to the location of the respective year's event for one of two fortnightly "terms". In 2012, the Academy received over 4000 applications to take part in the 2013 New York City edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paolozzi|first=John|title=Red Bull Music Academy Picks 3 Canadians|url=http://music.cbc.ca/#/blogs/2012/7/Red-Bull-Music-Academy-picks-3-Canadians-for-2012-edition|work=CBC Music|accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Remarks on Colour''' ({{lang-de|Bemerkungen über die Farben}}) was one of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s last works, written during a visit to [[Vienna]] in 1950 while dying of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/history/ghcc/research/global-arts/workshops/materialculture/a218.4finlay.pdf "Weaving the Rainbow: Visions of Color in World History"] by Robert Finlay, [[University of Arkansas]], at warwick.ac.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Believing that philosophical puzzles about colour can only be resolved through attention to the involved [[language-games]], he considers [[Goethe]]'s propositions in the ''[[Theory of Colours (book)|Theory of Colours]]'', and the observations of [[Philipp Otto Runge]] in an attempt to clarify the use of language about colour.&lt;ref name="McGinn 1991"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McGinn | first1 = M. | title = Wittgenstein's ''Remarks on Colour'' | journal = [[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]] | volume = 66 | issue = 258| pages = 435–453 | date=October 1991 | doi = 10.1017/S0031819100065104| jstor = 3751218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Goethe's theory of the constitution of colours of the spectrum has not proved to be an unsatisfactory theory, rather it really isn't a theory at all. Nothing can be predicted with it. It is, rather a vague schematic outline of the sort we find in [[William James|James]]'s psychology. Nor is there any ''[[experimentum crucis]]'' which could decide for or against the theory. Someone who agrees with Goethe believes that Goethe correctly recognized the nature of colour. And nature here is not what results from experiments, but it lies in the concept of colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Ludwig |last1=Wittgenstein |author-link=Ludwig Wittgenstein |title=Remarks on Colour |publisher=University of California Press |editor=[[G. E. M. Anscombe]] |year=1977|pages=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Wittgenstein was interested in the fact that some propositions about colour are apparently neither empirical nor exactly a priori, but something in between: phenomenology, according to Goethe. However, he took the line that 'There is no such thing as phenomenology, though there are phenomenological problems.' He was content to regard Goethe's observations as a kind of logic or geometry. Wittgenstein took his examples from the Runge letter included in the "Farbenlehre", e.g. "White is the lightest colour", "There cannot be a transparent white", "There cannot be a reddish green", and so on. The logical status of these propositions in Wittgenstein's investigation, including their relation to physics, was discussed in [[Jonathan Westphal]]'s ''Colour: a Philosophical Introduction'' (1991).

{{cquote|There seem to be propositions that have the character of experiential propositions, but whose truth is for me unassailable.. There are, in any case, errors.. which must be set apart from the rest of my judgements as temporary confusions. But aren't there transitional cases between these two. If we introduce the concept of knowing into this investigation, it will be of no help; because knowing is not a psychological state whose special characteristics explain all kinds of things. On the contrary, the special logic of the concept 'knowing' is not that of a psychological state. (Wittgenstein, pp. III.348-350)}}

Although ''Remarks on Colour'' is considered difficult on account of its fragmentation,&lt;ref name="McGinn 1991"/&gt; his last work, ''[[On Certainty]]'' (German: Über Gewissheit) is considered to be his most lucid.

{{unreferenced|date=August 2012}}
In [[Programming language|computer programming]], a '''return code''' or an '''error code''' is an enumerated message that corresponds to the status of a specific [[software application]]. They are typically used to identify faults, such as those in faulty [[computer hardware|hardware]], [[software]], or incorrect user input.

==In systems software==

[[Exit status]] is the return code of computer programs running as [[process (computing)|processes]], and is communicated through [[system call]]s.

==In networking software==

[[Network protocol]]s typically support returning status codes. In the [[TCP/IP stack]], it's a common feature of higher level protocols. For example:

* [[List of HTTP status codes]]
* [[List of FTP server return codes]]
* [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol#Protocol overview]]

==Error codes and exception handling==
Error codes are used in various methods of solving the [[semipredicate problem]]. They are generally similar to [[exception handling]] in programming languages that support it.

Error codes are slowly disappearing from the programmer's environment as modern [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] [[programming languages]] replace them with [[Exception handling|exceptions]].{{editorializing|date=April 2017}}{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Exceptions have the advantage of being handled with explicit blocks of code, separate from the rest of the code.  While it is considered poor practice in methodologies that use error codes and return codes to indicate failure, programmers often neglect to check return values for error conditions. That negligence can cause undesirable effects, as ignored error conditions often cause more severe problems later in the program. Exceptions are implemented in such a way as to separate the error handling code from the rest of the code. Separating the error handling code from the normal logic makes programs easier to write and understand, since one block of error handling code can service errors from any number of function calls. Exception handling also makes the code more readable than implementations with error codes, since exception handling does not disrupt the flow of the code with frequent checks for error conditions.

The pattern includes [[kilim motifs|motifs used on kilims]], such as the eye, cross, and hook, to ward off the [[evil eye]]; the central diamond-shaped motif represents the dragon.]]

'''Soumak''' (also spelled '''Soumakh''', '''Sumak''', '''Sumac''', or '''Soumac''') is a [[tapestry]] technique of weaving strong and decorative textiles used as [[Oriental rug|rugs]] and domestic bags. Baks used for bedding are known as '''Soumak Mafrash'''. Soumak is a type of flat weave, somewhat resembling but stronger and thicker than [[kilim]], with a smooth front face and a ragged back, where kilim is smooth both sides. Soumak lacks the slits characteristic of kilim, as it is usually woven with supplementary weft threads as continuous supports.

The technique involves wrapping coloured [[weft]] threads over and under the warp threads, adding strength and [[embroidery]]-like pattern.

==Technique==

[[File:Soumak weave.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Soumak weave wraps the [[weft]] threads over 4 warps and back over 2. The weaver may sometimes, as here, go backwards and forwards, reversing the direction of the wrapping.]]

The technique of making a soumak involves wrapping [[weft]]s over a certain number of [[warp (weaving)|warps]] (usually 4) before drawing them back under the last two warps. The process is repeated from [[selvedge]] to selvedge. The wefts are discontinuous; the weaver selects coloured threads in turn, and wraps each within the area which is to have that particular colour. Unlike kilim, the back is left ragged, with all the loose ends of the differently-coloured weft threads visible, sometimes several inches long, providing extra thickness and warmth. Also unlike kilim, there are no slits where colours meet, as there is a supplementary or structural weft which supports the coloured pattern weft. Some late Soumaks made by the Kurds are however "weftless", lacking the structural weft support, and the stitches naturally overlap.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thompson |first1=Jon |title=Carpets from the Tents, Cottages and Workshops of Asia |date=1988 |publisher=Barrie &amp; Jenkins |isbn=0-7126-2501-1 |pages=78, 167-168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mallett&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marlamallett.com/techniques.htm#SOUMAK |title=Basic Tribal and Village Weaves |author=Mallett, Marla |accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cassin&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weavingartmuseum.org/ex2_main.htm |title=Soumak and Kelim weaving of the Caucasus |author=Cassin, Jack |publisher=Weaving Art Museum |date=1998 |accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Haack&gt;{{cite book |last1=Haack |first1=Hermann |last2=Wingfield Digby |first2=George &amp; Cornelia (trans.) |title=Oriental Rugs: An Illustrated Guide |date=1960 |publisher=Faber &amp; Faber |pages=25-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wendorf|first1=Michael|title=The Nature of Kurdishness|journal=Hali|date=November 2000|volume=113|page=73|quote=Kurds also continued to create weavings using simple and ancient techniques such as weft wrapping without intervening ground wefts (weftless soumak), paired warp tapestry, and other techniques long abandoned by other weavers.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soumaks tend to be finely woven, and although not as durable as [[carpet|piled carpet]]s, they are stronger than [[kilim]]s. The soumak wrapping often covers the whole surface of a bag or rug, but it can equally be applied in decorative strips, contrasting with the plainer and thinner flatweave areas.&lt;ref name=Mallett/&gt;&lt;ref name=Middleton&gt;{{cite book |first=Andrew |last=Middleton |title=Rugs &amp; Carpets |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, camel bags from [[Malatya]] in Eastern Turkey could be woven in simple flatweave stripes of red and blue, with broad strips of soumak weft-wrapping with [[kilim motifs|motifs for fertility and protection]].&lt;ref name=GillowSentance&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gillow |first1=John |last2=Sentance |first2=Bryan |title=World Textiles. A Visual Guide to Traditional Techniques |date=1999 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |pages=64-65 |isbn=0-500-01950-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bags were sometimes woven with a face of soumak, with a [[tapestry]]-woven kilim-like top creating slits between blocks of colour: a rope was threaded in and out of the series of slits to fasten and close the bag.&lt;ref name=VandABagface&gt;{{cite web |title=Bag face (T.205-1922) |url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O68518/bag-face-unknown/ |publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]] |accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sizes vary, from carpet format through bags for bedding or for use on [[pack animal]]s, to tiny tribal domestic bags.&lt;ref name=Mallett/&gt;&lt;ref name=Middleton/&gt; The following images show the appearance and construction of just such a soumak [[saddle bag]], woven in [[Luristan]] at the end of the 20th century.

Soumak products are made in the [[Caucasus]] (especially the [[Shirvan]] region), Southern and Western [[Persia]] including [[Luristan]], Turkish [[Anatolia]], by the [[Shahsavan]] tribe and the [[Kurdish people|Kurds]] in north-western Persia, and by the [[Baloch people]] on the [[Persia]]–[[Afghanistan]] border.&lt;ref name=Mallett/&gt;&lt;ref name=Middleton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Haack/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=O'Connell |first1=Barry |title=Fantastic Animal Shahsavan Soumak Bagface 3rd quarter 19th c |url=http://www.persiancarpetguide.com/sw-asia/Rugs/Persian/Shahsavan/Shah997.htm |publisher=Persian Carpet Guide |accessdate=25 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140215011629/http://www.persiancarpetguide.com/sw-asia/Rugs/Persian/Shahsavan/Shah997.htm |archivedate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kurd Soumak Bagface Late 19th C |url=http://www.persiancarpetguide.com/sw-asia/Rugs/Kurdish/Kurd_Soumak_Bagface_late_19t_C_Lot_86.htm |publisher=Persian Carpet Guide |accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The name Soumak may plausibly derive from the old town of [[Shemakja]] in [[Azerbaijan]], once a major trading centre in the Eastern Caucasus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metropolitancarpet.com/html/soumac.htm |title=Soumac |accessdate=10 June 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714214457/http://www.metropolitancarpet.com/html/soumac.htm |archivedate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other theories include an etymology from Turkish ''sekmek'', to skip up and down, meaning the process of weaving; or from any of about 35 species of flowering plant in the [[Anacardiaceae]] or [[sumac]] family, such as [[dyer's sumach]] (''Cotinus coggygria''), used to make dyestuffs.&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt; If this last is the source of the name, then it is derived from the Arabic and [[Syriac language|Syriac]] word ''summāq'', red.&lt;ref&gt;Etymology of Sumac at [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=sumac Etymonline.com] and also at {{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/14047074/Dictionary-English-Etymology-Origins-A-Short-Etymological-Dictionary-of-Modern-English-Rouledge-1958-Parridge |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012185830/http://www.scribd.com/doc/14047074/Dictionary-English-Etymology-Origins-A-Short-Etymological-Dictionary-of-Modern-English-Rouledge-1958-Parridge |archivedate=2014-10-12 |df= }} and [https://archive.org/details/etymologicaldict00weekuoft/].

'''Stella Crawford''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', played by [[Sophie Thompson]] from 7 September 2006 to 23 July 2007.

==Storylines==
Stella is introduced as [[Phil Mitchell]]'s ([[Steve McFadden]]) new lawyer. They begin dating but Phil's son [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] ([[Charlie Jones (actor)|Charlie Jones]]) is unhappy about it. Stella moves in with them and Ben tries breaking them up. Stella tricks him into trusting her, and attempts to end his friendship with [[Abi Branning]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]). After some time, Stella begins physically and mentally abusing Ben. She later forces Ben to get Phil to propose to her, and lies that she has taken a job in [[Manchester]]. Phil proposes and she accepts. She continues tormenting Ben by calling him names, pinching him and manipulating him to confess to things he has not done. She also convinces him that he caused a car accident that he and Phil were involved in. Ben then goes to football camp during the school holidays, upsetting Stella. Ben returns, and Stella creeps into his room and tells him she loves him, knowing Phil is listening outside. This finalises Phil's feelings towards her and he is determined to marry for Ben. Ben tells Abi what is happening, but he believes it is a normal part of growing up that will happen to her too. The pair try to run away from home, but Stella stops them. She smashes a photo of Ben's mother, and says he is too pathetic to be Phil's real son. Abi later realises what Stella is doing and stands up to Stella.

On the day of Phil and Stella's wedding day, Ben tells Stella he does not want her to be his mum and Stella threatens Ben, warning him to keep quiet. Halfway through the ceremony, Ben confesses what Stella has been doing to him. Stella runs home, spills orange juice on Ben's bed and takes a picture of Phil and Ben, tearing Phil out and keeping the piece with Ben tucked in her bra. [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) sees Stella in shock who says she has discovered something out about Phil. Phil bursts into the Vic and Ian tells Stella to go. She takes the car again and Phil follows her to an abandoned factory, where she locks the gates so Phil cannot get to her. She says that in her childhood, she was always blamed for her sister's death and she felt like she was a ghost in her own home and she feels the same with Phil, and that when she feels like in a dream she sometimes has to pinch herself to wake herself up. Phil, reasoning that Stella is insane, drives his car into the gates and runs after her onto the roof. She threatens to jump off unless Phil says he loves her. Phil answers that he chose her because he thought she was "easy", "safe", and would "look after Ben, iron [his] shirts and keep [her] mouth shut for the next 30 years". Stella looks down from the roof and then jumps,&lt;!--STELLA JUMPED!!! SHE DID NOT FALL --&gt; killing herself instantly. Phil publicly declares that he killed her at the Vic and is arrested for murder, but CCTV shows that she jumped.

In January 2012, [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]) is led to believe that Phil had murdered her husband [[Kevin Wicks]] ([[Phil Daniels]]) in late December 2007. Denise later suspects that Phil pushed Stella to her death on their wedding day, but Phil denies her accusations and insists that Stella committed suicide. However, Denise goes to the police, telling them she believes that Phil murdered Stella. Ben (now Joshua Pascoe) goes to the police and tells police officer [[Jill Marsden (EastEnders)|DCI Jill Marsden]] ([[Sophie Stanton]]), who has been trying to imprison Phil for years, that Phil forced Stella to jump, telling her that if she did not, then he would push her. Phil is then arrested for Stella's murder and is later charged. Phil is later released when Ian reveals to Marsden that Ben had lied about Phil murdering Stella.

==Creation and development==
{{Quote_box |width=30% |align=right|quote="Part of Stella believes that once she's down the aisle with the ring on her finger, everything will be alright. That happens in real life, doesn't it? You think that if you get to a certain point, everything that'd happened will be forgotten or swept away. But everything catches up with you, just like it does with Stella…"|source=—Sophie Thompson explains Stella's motives&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Kris|title=Sophie Thompson|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/interviews/a66012/sophie-thompson.html|work=Digital Spy|publisher=Hachette Filipacchi |accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In July 2007, the entertainment website ''[[Digital Spy]]'' interviewed Sophie Thompson about the basics of her character Stella. She revealed that even though her character is a very nasty piece of work, nobody has shouted any comments to her on the street. She commented: "I've been pleasantly surprised. Occasionally you get the odd kid laughing and pointing but it's not been unpleasant at all. I've been amazed by the amount of post you get up at Elstree and how thoughtful the correspondence is. It's really nice to read a letter and see how people become engaged and involved in the storylines and want to have a good yarn about them!"

Stella was created solely as a [[love interest]] for the character [[Phil Mitchell]]. When [[Steve McFadden]], who plays Phil, returned to the show in October 2005, a story conference was held between the show's producers, who decided that his relationship with his son [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben]] would take priority over any new love interests. Another story conference was held in February 2006, where it was decided to introduce a new love interest. ''EastEnders''' series story producer, [[Brigie de Courcy]], said; "To create her, we took all of Phil's past lovers and came up with somebody completely different from them!"&lt;ref name="inside"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producers created a "wish list" of actresses they wanted to see. The ''EastEnders'' casting director offered the role to Sophie Thompson, who accepted. Producers were so excited that the whole office cheered when they found out that Thompson had accepted the role.&lt;ref name="inside"/&gt; Thompson has said of the role that "joining ''EastEnders'' is a bit like being welcomed into a really special playground that you never thought you had the chance to play in, and you are rather in awe of all the kids, but very excited."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5221790.stm Actress Thompson joins Eastenders] BBC News, 27 July 2006; Retrieved 22 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Personality ===
When she was first introduced, Stella appeared to be a scatterbrained but well-meaning character who lived on her own and had developed something of a drink problem when Phil first met her. She dryly comments on this, saying "You're getting a basic picture of a spinster here, aren't you? You're probably wondering if I've got any cats." However, as the show went on and her relationship with Phil's son, Ben, was explored, it became clear that Stella was a deranged and mentally unstable character, who psychologically and physically abused Ben whilst manipulating him in her attempts to improve her relationship with his father. Supposedly, Stella's instability is a result of parental neglect. This is hinted at by her telling Ben that his friend [[Abi Branning]] was an unpleasant and untrustworthy person, probably as a result of poor parenting. Later in the same episode, she picks up a Mother's Day picture that she did with Ben and glares at the word "Mother" before later tearing up the card. It is known that something ghastly happened to Stella's sister for which her parents blamed her. However, it is never revealed what happened to her or how, or if it was Stella's fault. This is later confirmed to be true when she tells Phil Mitchell that as a child she was ignored by her parents and felt like a ghost within her own home.

Stella, at times, gives the impression of being emotionally immature, a frequent side-effect of parental neglect. An interview with Sophie Thompson says that [[Charlie Jones (actor)|Charlie Jones]] who plays Ben mused that her vicious nature is caused by the fact that she had a very unhappy childhood.

==Reception==
''[[Radio Times]]'' included Stella in their feature on bunny boilers.&lt;ref name="bunny"&gt;{{cite web|last=McLean|first=Gareth|title=Soapland's top bunny-boilers|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/blogs/810-soaps-bunny-boilers/|work=Radio Times|publisher=BBC Magazines|accessdate=1 January 2011|date=29 November 2009&lt;!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vOscOXuK|archivedate=01 January 2011 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; They stated that anyone who falls in love with Phil needs "their head examined". They added that she was [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] and "proved to be a basket-case".&lt;ref name="bunny"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2521">'''Stella Moroundia Oyedepo''' (sometimes '''Stella Dia Oyedepo''') (born c. 1954) is a [[Nigeria]]n playwright.

Oyedepo has written over 300 plays over the course of her career; of these, only around 30 have been published.&lt;ref name="Sheldon2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kathleen Sheldon|title=Historical Dictionary of Women in Sub-Saharan Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HwqQCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA283|date=4 March 2016|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-1-4422-6293-5|pages=283–}}&lt;/ref&gt; She takes as her subject daily life and problems, and her work often addresses such themes as marriage, corruption, politics, and family life. A typical example is her 1988 play ''The Greatest Gift'', which contrasts the life of a family destroyed by the father's drunkenness with the life of a successful family. Her 2001 play ''Brain Has No Gender'' was written for the [[Kwara State]] Ministry of Education for Women-in-Science Programme.&lt;ref name="Sheldon2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kathleen E.

Oyedepo's origins are from [[Ondo State]]. She trained as a linguist, and for some time in the 1980s she served as Senior Principal Leturer at the [[Kwara State College for Education]] in [[Ilorin]]. She has also served as director of the Kwara State Council for Arts and Culture. Many of her plays were commissioned for specific occasions.&lt;ref name="BanhamGibbs2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Martin Banham|author2=James Gibbs|author3=Femi Osofisan|title=African Theatre: Women|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7atGWTy1XRsC&amp;pg=PA99|year=2002|publisher=James Currey|isbn=978-0-253-21539-0|pages=99–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9934">'''Tactile graphics''', including '''tactile pictures''', '''tactile diagrams''', '''tactile maps''', and '''tactile graphs''', are images that use raised surfaces so that a [[Visual impairment|visually impaired]] person can feel them. They are used to convey non-textual information such as maps, paintings, graphs and diagrams.

Tactile graphics can be seen as a subset of [[accessible image]]s. Images can be made accessible to the visually impaired in various ways, such as verbal description, sound, or [[haptic perception|haptic]] (tactual) feedback.
One of the most common uses for tactile graphics is the production of tactile maps.

==Tactile maps==
[[File:Disability5 200.jpg|thumb|Paper tactile map]]
The types and forms of tactile maps began with the oldest and most rudimentary or a mixed media format. This tactile map is produced by simply attaching objects to a substrate to represent different items or symbols. More recent tactile maps are produced by computers through different means such as an ink-jet printers.

'''Thermoform''' is one of the most common methods of producing tactile maps. This process is also known as [[vacuum forming]]. Thermoform maps or plans are created from a process where a sheet of plastic is heated and vacuumed on top of a model or master. The master can be made from many substances, although certain materials are more durable than others. Since this process involves creating a mold, it is somewhat time consuming.

'''Swell paper''' has a special coating of heat-reactive chemicals. Microcapsules of alcohol implanted in the paper fracture when exposed to heat and make the surface of the paper inflate. Placing black ink on the paper prior to a heat process provides control over the raised surface areas. This type of map is not as robust as the Thermoform map, but can be produced with less effort and expense.

'''Modified [[Braille embosser]]s''' can also be used to produce tactile paper maps.&lt;ref&gt;McCallum, Don. et al. 2005. The design and manufacture of tactile maps using an ink-jet process. Journal of Engineering Design. Vol. 16, no. 6. December. pp. 525–544. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ink-jet tactile maps''' are made by layering a specially designed ink. Each layer is cured by UV irradiation before the next layer is added. This technology is an offshoot of other industries, such as circuit board manufacturing and biomedical applications.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, Kafeel., McCallum, Don., &amp; Sheldon, Derek F. 2005. Multiphase Micro-Drop Interaction In Ink-jet Printing of 3D Structures for Tactile Maps. Modern Physics Letters B. Nos. 28&amp;29 pp. 1699–1702. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

The substrate for tactile maps is a very important attribute, since different materials can enhance or reduce legibility and durability. Several types of substrates can be used to produce a tactile map. These include rough and smooth plastic, rough and smooth paper, microcapsule paper, Braillon, and aluminum. Many factors should be considered when choosing a [[Substrate (printing)|substrate]]; these include but are not limited to function, durability, and portability.&lt;ref&gt;Jehoel, Sandra. et al. 2005. An Evaluation of Substrates for Tactile Maps and Diagrams:
Scanning Speed and Users’ Preferences. Journal of Visual Impairment &amp; Blindness. February. pp. 85–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tactile map variables:''' Just as [[Jacques Bertin]] retinal variables help determine how visual maps are produced; tactile maps have a formula as well. Although researchers have not standardized tactile map variables, these nine are usually included depending on the ''substrate'': vibration, flutter, pressure, temperature, size, shape, texture/grain, orientation, and elevation.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, A.L. 2002 Feeling it out : the use of haptic visualization for exploratory geographic visualization. Cartographic Perspectives, 39. pp. 12–29&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Typical tactile elevations:''' Thermoformed maps usually have an elevation of at least 1mm. Swell Paper averages 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm and braille embossers have a range from 0.25–1&amp;nbsp;mm. Ink-jet printers can be controlled to vary elevation as needed. A (2009) study conducted by Sandra Jehoel tested various height levels and estimated that preferred tactile elevations fall between 40 and 80 micrometres depending on the substrate background, shape of the object and smoothness of lines. Symbols such as a triangle, square and a circle should have a minimum base line length of 6.4, 5.0 and 5.5&amp;nbsp;mm respectively for proper recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Jehoel, Sandra. et al. 2005. An Evaluation of Substrates for Tactile Maps and Diagrams:
Scanning Speed and Users’ Preferences. Journal of Visual Impairment &amp; Blindness. February. pp. 85–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Audio tactile maps''' or [[graphic tablet]]s are interactive devices. Electronic tactile talking touch pad instruments use [[Macromedia Flash]] software with audio files to convey information to the blind or visually impaired user. As the user’s finger engages a feature or symbol a recording provides information about the object, symbol or area. For example, the sound of splashing water can be used for areas such as rivers or oceans. This format has great potential for transmitting information over the Internet which can be downloaded to a computer or hand-held device.&lt;ref&gt;Siekierska, Eva., Muller, Anita. 2003. Tactile and Audio-tactile Maps within the Canadian Government On-Line Program. The Cartography Journal. Vol 40, 3. pp. 299–304.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
A great deal of hardware already exists that can be used by the blind or visually impaired to interact with computer screen graphics. A vibrating mouse or other force feedback devices can be adapted to turn any visual software generated map into a hybrid tactile map. The interactive signal to a device can be varied when crossing a boundary or symbol.&lt;ref&gt;Golledge, Reginald G, Rice Matthew., &amp; Jacobson Denial R. 2005. A Commentary on the use of Touch for Accessing On-Screen Spatial Representations: The Process of Experiencing Haptic Maps and Graphics. The Professional Geographer. 57, 3 pp. 339–349.&lt;/ref&gt;

High resolution refreshable braille displays containing 1,500 to 12,000 pixels are already available in market. Graphic braille display available in the market is DV-2 (from KGS &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kgs-jpn.co.jp/ | title=Home of KGS Corporation|publisher=KGS Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;) with 1,536 pixels, Hyperbraille &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hyperbraille.de/?lang=en | title=Hyperbraille|publisher=Hyperbraille}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 7,200 pixels and TACTISPLAY Table/Walk (from Tactisplay Corp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tactisplay.com/ | title=Home of Tactisplay Corp.|publisher=Tactisplay Corp.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) with 2,400/12,000 pixels respectively. TACTISPLAY table &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tactisplay.com/product/tactisplay-table | title=Full Page Braille Display being Launched by Tactisplay Corp.|publisher=Tactisplay Corp.}}&lt;/ref&gt; has total 12,000 pixels arranged in 120x100.

'''Zoom maps''' are a recently developed tactile map. These maps are designed specifically for those who can read braille and have had no previous interaction with tactile maps. The term zoom is comparable to a zoom-able visual [[wikt: raster|raster]] internet map. A country is divided into regions on the first map then the next zoomed map will have a breakdown of the regions and so forth until a city level is reached. These successive maps rely on a dependable texture as the map zoom progresses. This produces a familiarity as one zooms from the proceeding map. This is achieved in many instances with line orientation, area and consistent shape. The Braille text on the map is placed next to a rectangular textured legend for area identification.&lt;ref&gt;Yayla, Lisa. 2009. Huseby Zoom Maps: A design Methodology for Tactile Graphics. Journal of Visual Impairment &amp; Blindness. May. pp. 270–276.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Life of Henry Brulard''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Vie de Henri Brulard'''}}) is an unfinished autobiography by [[Stendhal]]. It was begun on November 23, 1835 and abandoned March 26, 1836 while the author was serving as the French [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] in [[Civitavecchia]]. Stendhal had severe doubts about contemporary interest in his autobiography, so he bequeathed it to the reader of 1880, or of 1935, or 2000. The manuscript, including Stendhal's numerous diagrams and illustrations, was published in 1890. Stendhal primariliy discusses his unhappy and dull childhood, touching briefly on his time as a soldier. ''The Life of Henry Brulard'' is considered a masterpiece of  autobiographical writing and ironic self-reflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Life-of-Henry-Brulard |title=The Life of Henry Brulard  |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/apr/13/classics.nicholaslezard |title=Witty once a week:Nicholas Lezard on ''The Life of Henry Brulard'', Stendhal's rambunctious memoir |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=April 13, 2002 |accessdate=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
''The Life of Henry Brulard'' begins in 1832, with Stendhal on the [[Janiculum]] (named for [[Janus]], the two-faced god of beginnings) looking down at [[Rome]]. He begins questioning his accomplishments as he approaches 50 years of age. He reflects on the churches and monuments of the city and how much they have changed since he was a young man. He heads home through a cold mist at night and decides he will reflect upon his past until its truth emerges. He also decides to write as fast as he can without revising, to avoid lies. He believes a quickly-written rough draft would, like [[automatic writing]], disclose the truth about himself. Stendhal explicitly compares himself with [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] and calls ''The Life of Henry Brulard'' his own ''[[Confessions (Rousseau)|Confessions]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Michael |date=1971 |title=Stendhal |url= |location=Ithaca, NY |publisher=Cornell University Press |page=97 |isbn=978-0801491245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, Stendhal was 52 years old when he began the memoir and the first scene is a small fiction. The  first chapter was written in two days in November 1835, and Stendhal also claims that ''The Life of Henry Brulard'' is an imitation of [[Oliver Goldsmith|Oliver Goldsmith's]] novel ''[[The Vicar of Wakefield]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Michael |date=1971 |title=Stendhal |url= |location=Ithaca, NY |publisher=Cornell University Press |page=103–104 |isbn=978-0801491245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Stendhal notes at the start that other men's biographies naturally focus on their public career. Stendhal himself campaigned with Napoleon in Russia and became consul at [[Civitavecchia]]. But Stendhal asserts that his real life can be found in a list of names: Virginie, Angela, Adele, Melanie, Mina, Alexandrine, Angelina, Metilde, Clementine, Giulia, Madame Azur, Amalia. Stendhal says that none of these women ever honored him with her favors and, despite others who did, the “habitual condition of my life is that of an unhappy lover.”

Stendhal forthrightly admits to wanting to sleep with his mother, who died when he was seven. While discussing his childhood in [[Grenoble]], Stendhal describes how Eighteenth-century French society habitually crushed his natural feelings. He often compares his father to a tyrant or king, on slender pretenses: young Henry is not allowed to play with other kids, not allowed to leave home at age 10, and must accompany his father on walks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Michael |date=1971 |title=Stendhal |url= |location=Ithaca, NY |publisher=Cornell University Press |page=146 |isbn=978-0801491245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stendhal's descriptions of scenes from his youth often provoke present-moment commentaries, blurring together the feelings of a young boy and the reflections of a middle-aged man. 

Stendhal only found happiness when he crossed the Alps into Italy as a 17-year-old in Napoleon's army. Stendhal describes the first time in his life that he mounted a horse, which went berserk and ran towards the willows on the shore of [[Lake Geneva]]. For a quarter of an hour he was in fear of breaking his neck. This became a favorite motif of Stendhal's; the heroes of ''[[The Red and the Black]]'', ''[[Lucien Leuwen]]'', and ''[[The Charterhouse of Parma]]'' all fall off their horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vizinczey |first=Stephen  |date=February 20, 1986 |title=Lucky Lucien |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v08/n03/stephen-vizinczey/lucky-lucien |journal=The London Review of Books |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=17–18 |access-date=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stendhal loved Italy, which he considered a land where his truest self could be freely expressive without fear of reprisals. ''The Life of Henry Brulard'' ends with the beginning Stendhal's love for Italy and his mistress Angela Pietragrua, countess Simonetta. Stendhal asks, "How can I talk reasonably about those times? I prefer to put it off until another day...What does one do? How does one describe one's wildest happiness?" Stendhal ends the work by saying, "One spoils such tender feelings by recounting them in detail."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Michael |date=1971 |title=Stendhal |url= |location=Ithaca, NY |publisher=Cornell University Press |page=98 |isbn=978-0801491245 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/review/the-life-of-henry-brulard|title=The Life of Henry Brulard, Essay by Michael Dirda|publisher=[[Barnes &amp; Noble]] Review |date=April 28, 2008 |accessdate=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Night of Enitharmon's Joy''''', often referred as '''''The Triple Hecate''''' or simply '''''Hecate''''', is a 1795 work of art by the English artist and poet [[William Blake]] which depicts [[Enitharmon]], a female character in [[Blake's mythology|his mythology]], or [[Hecate]], a [[chthonic]] [[Greco-Roman mythology|Greco-Roman goddess]] of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and the [[underworld]]. The work presents a nightmarish scene with [[Legendary creature|fantastic creatures]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Gilchrist, ''The Life of William Blake'', General Books LLC, 2009, p.287. {{ISBN|1-150-51671-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Scott Littleton, ''Gods, goddesses, and mythology'', vol. 1, Marshall Cavendish, 2005, p. 620. {{ISBN|0-7614-7559-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''The Triple Hecate'' is painted with deep [[Lightness (color)|tones]] and bold masses. Blake employed a new technique whose "effect is darker and richer than [his] illuminated books".&lt;ref&gt;[[Kathleen Raine]], ''William Blake'' (London: Thames and Hudson 1970; reprint: Oxford University [nd]) at 85-86 (illustration no.63). Works created using the technique, involving [[Distemper (paint)|distemper]] on mill-board, include: ''God creating Adam, Newton, Nebuchadnezzar, Ruth, Pity, The House of Death'', and ''God judging Adam''.&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar interprets his colour print ''Hecate'' thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"She is triple, according to mythology: a girl and a boy hide their heads behind her back. Her left hand lies on a book of magic; her left foot is extended. She is attended by a thistle-eating ass, the mournful owl of false wisdom, the head of a crocodile (blood-thirsty hypocrisy), and a cat-headed bat."&lt;ref&gt;[[S. Foster Damon]], ''A Blake Dictionary. The ideas and symbols of William Blake'' (Brown University 1965; reprint Shambhala, Boulder, 1979) at 391, under the entry "Superstition". Higher-resolution reproductions show the "crocodile" behind the rock as likely a frog or snake. Here, however, Prof. Damon compares Blake's Hecate not to [[Enitharmon]] (the ''Eternal Female'' who as 'Spiritual Beauty' is also the consort of [[Los (Blake)|Los]]), but rather to the ''Rephaim'' (ghosts). Damon (1965, 1979) at 124-125, 346, 391.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Blake often drew on [[Michelangelo]] to create and compose his epic images, including Hecate's, according to a consensus of critics. "Blake is indebted to Michelangelo for many of his giant forms".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jenijoy La Belle]], "Blake's Visions and Re-Visions of Michaelangelo" 13-22, at 13, in ''Blake in his time'' (Indiana University 1978), edited by Robert N. Essick and Donald Pearce.&lt;/ref&gt; Michelangelo contributed many "characters to Blake's gallery of mythic persons and heroes".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Howard Hagstrum|Jean H. Hagstrum]], ''William Blake. Poet and Painter'' (University of Chicago 1964) at 39-40. Hagstrum here includes "Blake's Triple Hecate, Urizen, Los, Albion, Newton".&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the ''Hecate'' colour print, a suggested trail may be traced. From Michelangelo, Blake copied his early sketch entitled ''The Reposing Traveller'', which then evolved into a figure for his work (1795-1797) regarding ''Night Thoughts'',&lt;ref&gt;Blake created 537 watercolor designs for a new issue of Edward Young's ''Night Thoughts'' (1742-45), of which only 43 were then published. In 1980 two volumes containing 728 reproductions of Blake's work here were published by Oxford University. Joseph Viscomi, "William Blake's Designs for Edward Young's ''Night Thoughts''. A complete edition" in ''Fine Print'' (Spring 1982): 49-50. [http://site.unc.edu/viscomi/night_fineprint.htm]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; and also into the similarly posed figure of Hecate here.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., La Belle, "Blake's Visions and Re-Visions of Michelangelo" 13-22, at 18-20 with Plate 22 (''The Reposing Traveller'') &amp; Plate 24 (figure re ''Night Thoughts'', VII, p. 40) in ''Blake in his time'' (Indiana University 1978).&lt;/ref&gt;

The image may also allude to the Three Fates — the [[Moirai]] of [[Greek mythology]] and the [[Parcae]] of [[Roman mythology|Roman]]. Notwithstanding these allusions, critics point out that a contemporary trigger for Blake's inspiration probably was the return popularity of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Macbeth]]''.&lt;ref name="Emory"&gt;[http://www.english.emory.edu/ Emory University]. "[http://www.english.emory.edu/classes/Shakespeare_Illustrated/Blake.Hecate.html Blake. Hecate]". Consulted on September 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; As Hecate listens offstage,&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare's Hecate describes herself as "the close contriver of all harms". ''Macbeth'' III,v.&lt;/ref&gt; the three witches, in arranging Macbeth's doom, chant: "Double, double, toil and trouble; Fire burn and cauldron bubble". Each witch in turn adds her verses, the second's being:

:"Fillet of a fenny snake,
:In the cauldron boil and bake;
:Eye of newt and toe of frog,
:Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
:Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,
:Lizard's leg and owlet's wing,
:For a charm of powerful trouble,
:Like a hell-broth boil and bubble." (''[[Macbeth]]'', IV.i)

Hence, [[bat]], [[owl]], [[snake]] or [[frog]] would be appropriate to ''The Triple Hecate''.&lt;ref name="Emory" /&gt; 

Blake printed his illuminated ''[[Europe a Prophecy]]'' in 1794. The bulk of the book, according to one scholar, "is devoted to ''the night of Enitharmon's joy'', when she establishes her Woman's World with its false religion of chastity and vengeance: a religion of eighteen hundred years, which is the error of official [[Christianity]]."&lt;ref name="FosterEaves"&gt;S. Foster Damon, ''A Blake dictionary: the ideas and symbols of William Blake'' (Brown University 1965; Shambhala 1979; UPNE 1988) at 125. Index (1979) by Morris Eaves. {{ISBN|0-87451-436-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it is said to represent a Feminine Will over a [[patriarchal]] Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;S. Foster Damon, ''A Blake dictionary: the ideas and symbols of William Blake'' (1965; 1988) at 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas M. Williams, ''Ideology and utopia in the poetry of William Blake'', Cambridge University Press, 1998, p. 81. {{ISBN|0-521-62050-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Howard, ''Infernal poetics: poetic structures in Blake's Lambeth prophecies'', Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1984, p.143. {{ISBN|0-8386-3176-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blake's character is described as "the [[Moon]] of love to [[Los (Blake)|Los]]'s [[Sun]]",&lt;ref name="FosterEaves" /&gt; hence its relationship with Hecate, one of the Moon Goddesses alongside [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]/[[Artemis]] and [[Selene]]. She is also invoked in ''[[Hamlet]]'', in the [[Story within a story|play within the play method]], by the (actor) Lucianus: "With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected, Thy natural magic and dire property [...]"&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare, ''Hamlet'', III. ii.&lt;/ref&gt; but in ''[[Europe: a Prophecy]]'' Enitharmon's night is presented in this way:

:"Now comes the night of Enitharmon's joy!
:Who shall I call? Who shall I send?
:That Woman, lovely Woman! may have dominion
:Arise O [[Rintrah]] thee I call! &amp; Palamabron thee.
:Go! tell the human race that Womans love is Sin!
:That an Eternal life awaits the worms of sixty winters
:In an allegorical abode where existence hath never come:
:Forbid all Joy, &amp; from her childhood shall the little female
:Spread nets in every secret path."

There are other literary sources for the myth of Hecate, such as ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' by [[Ovid]], VI 140, VII 74, 94, 174, 177, 194, 241, XIV 44, 405, and Blake himself: "The Gods all Serve her at her will; so great her Power is, like fabled Hecate, she doth bind them to her law." (Blake, ''[[s:Then She bore Pale desire%E2%80%A6|Then She bore Pale desire…]]''). But not only in his poetry ''The Triple Hecate'' makes a connection: it is seen as an opposition to his painting ''[[Pity (William Blake)|Pity]]'', circa 1795, where the [[piety]] provides a "possibility of [[salvation]]" in the fallen world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Butlin]], ''William Blake 1757-1827'', Tate Gallery Collections, V, London 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, both [[witchcraft]] and [[curse]], associated with Hecate, are factors to human perdition. [[Geoffrey Keynes]] wrote about it:

{{quote|"Hecate, an infernal Trinity, crouches in the centre. An evil winged spectre hovers over her. On her left an ass is grazing on rank vegetation, while an owl and a great toad watch from between rocks. The theme of the Moon Goddess is derived from Shakespeare's ''[[Midsummer Night's Dream]]''."&lt;ref name="Keynes"&gt;[[Geoffrey Keynes]], ''Drawings of William Blake: 92 pencil studies'', Courier Dover Publications, 1970, p.18. {{ISBN|0-486-22303-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The image was created in a time in which Shakespeare's ''Macbeth'' had a revival, being performed nine times.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Rawlinson, ''William Blake's comic vision'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2003, p.48. {{ISBN|0-312-22064-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other works by Blake, such as ''[[The Ghost of a Flea]]'', the picture is part of W. Graham Robertson's [[private collection]] and was presented to the [[Tate Gallery]] by himself in 1939. It is considered to be one of the most brilliant and significant pictures of William Blake.&lt;ref name="NewMexico"&gt;''Blake'', Volumes 14-15. University of New Mexico. Dept. of English. Ardent Media, 1980, p.59&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8831">The '''United States Society for Education through Art (USSEA)''' is an [[United States|American]] national association whose members work in curriculum development, teaching and research related to [[art education]] and [[Culture|cultural]] differences, and who share interests in [[art]] educational content and strategies which promote tolerance and appreciation of [[the arts]] of non-mainstream cultural peoples. The mission of the society is to promote greater understanding and respect for learners from all [[ethnic]], [[Minority group|minority]], and socio-cultural backgrounds through research, art curricula, instruction, and practices that are inclusive and culturally sensitive.&lt;ref name="dejong1985"&gt;DeJong, M. (Ed.) (1985). ''USSEA Handbook and Operations Manual''. Cincinnati, OH: United States Society for Education through Art. Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The society provides a platform for networking and a resource base for art educators nationally and internationally, who seek to work collaboratively on projects of interest to [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] or cross-cultural [[Community|communities]] and [[student]]s, [[Publishing|publishes]] instructional resources for [[Teacher|classroom teachers]], encourages and sponsors cross-cultural research, and facilitates international and intra-national professional relationships through online sites, [[Symposium|symposia]], [[Academic conference|conferences]], and publications.&lt;ref name="manifold2008"&gt;Manifold, M. C., Zimmerman, E. (Eds) (2008). ''USSEA Handbook and Operations Manual''. 5th edition Cincinnati, OH: United States Society for Education through Art. Page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, USSEA honors one national and one international art educator, each of whom has demonstrated exemplary teaching, service, or research in the area of multicultural or cross-cultural art education with the Ziegfeld Art Education award. The ''Journal of Cultural Research in Art Education'' is a publication of USSEA that is made available to all members of the art educational profession. Through the [[website]], members may access suggestions and recommendations for appropriate multi-culturally oriented [[K-12 (education)|K-12]] art lessons, and receive up-to-date news and information about USSEA initiatives, programs and opportunities. Additionally, exhibitions of [[Child|children's]] art from countries around the world are presented at national conferences of art educators and through an online gallery of children's art, which is organized by topical themes and maintained on the USSEA website.&lt;ref name="manifold2008" /&gt;

==History==
USSEA was founded in 1977 as an affiliate of the [[International Society for Education Through Art]] (InSEA) and the [[National Art Education Association]] (NAEA). The goals of USSEA reflect, on a national level, the goals of its international parent organization InSEA, which in turn, was inspired by the spirit of [[Aftermath of World War II|postwar]] hope and optimism of its parent affiliate [[UNESCO]]. In a paper describing the early history of InSEA, the motivational energy and overarching goals of UNESCO and InSEA are explained.

"The world had just come through a terrible and protracted [[World War II|war]], one initiated by false philosophies working on ignorance through massive control of [[Freedom of speech|free speech]]. The impulse in 1945, to try to ensure that it did not happen again, and that people should understand each other better through [[education]] and all forms of cultural and [[Science|scientific]] exchanges, the passionate emphasis on [[truth]], [[justice]], [[peace]] and the [[Individualism|importance of the individual]] – these impulses were irresistible."&lt;ref name=steers2001&gt;Steers, J. (2001). InSEA: A Brief History and a Vision of its Future Role. International Journal of Art &amp; Design Education 20 (2), 215-229.&gt;, additional text. (Hoggart quoted in Steers, 2001, p. 216)&lt;/ref&gt;

These sentiments, which gave root to InSEA in 1954, are also guiding principles of USSEA. Art educator Kenneth Marantz was instrumental in establishing the United States organization and served as its first president. Other founding members who served as officers included Maryl Fletcher De Jong, Larry Kantner, Eugenia Oole, Helen Patton, and Tom Sletterhaugh.&lt;ref name="dejong19852"&gt;De Jong, M. F. (1985). ''USSEA Handbook: Historical Record''. Cincinnati, OH: United States Society for Education through Art.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sponsored Activities==
As a means of disseminating shared ideas about the importance of teaching art to increasingly diverse populations and to develop research agenda for determining effective practices of multicultural art education, USSEA began sponsored conferences and symposia. Fourteen such events were held between 1977 and 2010. The topics addressed included "Limits and Extents of International Research in Art Education" (1977), "Art Education: The [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] Basin" (1982), "International Aspects of Teaching [[Aesthetics]] and Critical Skills" (1987), "[[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous People]], Art, and Place: Interactions of Culture and Environment in Contemporary Life" (1994) and "Crossing Cultural, Artistic, and Cyber Borders" (2000),&lt;ref name="lapierre2000"&gt;LaPierre, S.

Since 1986, USSEA has presented two annual awards in the name of Edwin Ziegfeld, founding president of InSEA (1954–1960) and NAEA (1947–1951), to honor an American art educator and a foreign art educator who have made distinguished leadership contributions to international art education. These awards are presented to the recipients during a USSEA Awards banquet held during the annual NAEA conference.&lt;ref name="ussea2007"&gt;USSEA. (2007). The Edwin Ziegfeld Awards.

The first issue of the USSEA publication ''The Journal of Multicultural and Cross-cultural Research in Art Education'' was issued in 1983 with Larry Kantner as senior editor. In 2001, the title of the journal was changed to the ''Journal of Cultural Research in Art Education'' (JCRAE). Articles published in JCRAE focus on social/cultural research relevant for art education, including cultural foundations of art education, cross-cultural and multicultural research in art education, and cultural aspects of art in education. These areas may be interpreted in a broad sense to include arts administration, [[art therapy]], community arts organizations, and other disciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches relevant to art education. Articles considered for publication may feature theoretical research and research in which qualitative and/or quantitative methods as well as other formats and strategies are employed. In addition to the publication of a [[Magazine|journal]], USSEA sponsors [[monograph]]s and sponsors or endorses books that address issues of interest and concern to art educators.&lt;ref name="jcrae"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ussea.sdstate.org/AboutJCRAE.htm|title=Journal of Cultural Studies in Art Education|work=Official site|publisher=USSEA|accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Unwanted Cinema''''' is a [[documentary film]] by Petrus van der Let and Armin Loacker that looks at the lives and careers of [[Jewish]] filmmakers in [[Budapest]] and [[Vienna]] during the 1930s after [[Hitler]] came to power. ''Unwanted Cinema'' features [[Henry Koster]], Felix Jackson, [[Joe Pasternak]], [[Otto Wallburg]], Hans Jaray, Franziska Gaal, Rosy Rarsony, [[Hortense Raky]], Oskar Pilzer, Zolan Vidor, Ernst Verebes. The documentary shares clips from their films and interviews with their family.

==Summary==
On his American debut, director Henry Koster stood in the lobby waiting to see if the audience would laugh at his film. If they laughed, he knew he could make a career for himself. If they didn’t, he’d have to return to Europe, where he could be killed by the Nazis. The audience laughed uncontrollably. ''Unwanted Cinema'' profiles Koster and other Jews who were involved in the movie business before and during World War II, as they struggled to preserve both their careers and their lives.

Until the dawn of Hitler, Jewish actors and producers throughout [[Europe]] enjoyed critical acclaim and stardom. But once [[anti-Semitism]] began to spread, it threatened not only their celebrity but also their lives.  Filmmakers and actors moved to Vienna and Budapest where their “unwanted cinema” was produced independently. Later, in hopes of escaping war-torn Europe, many Jews involved in cinema traveled to [[Hollywood]] to test their skills and their luck.

The documentary points to both the cruelty and irony of anti-Semitism. Talent that was  “unwanted” in Europe because of prejudice was celebrated on the other side of the ocean. The charming clips interspersed throughout the documentary prove the injustice of rejecting Jewish talent. [[100 Men and a Girl]], which was nominated for five [[Oscars]], is just one example of the exceptional films that these [[refugees]] were responsible for.

'''Writers Theatre''' is a [[non-profit]] [[theatre company]] founded in 1992 and located on the [[North Shore (Chicago)|North Shore of Chicago]] in Glencoe, Illinois. [[Michael W. Halberstam]], the founder of the company, has been artistic director since its inception and Kathryn M. Lipuma has been executive director since 2007.

==History==

In 1992, Writers Theatre was founded in order to create an environment where the written word and the nurturing of artists were the foundation of all productions. Writers Theatre opened its first venue in the ante-room of a newly opened bookstore in Glencoe. Because of its growing reputation and audience, a second 108-seat performance space was opened in 2003 in The Woman's Library Club of Glencoe on Tudor Court. The company has produced more than 100 productions, including more than 20 world premieres.

In 2007, Writers Theatre debuted nationally with a New York premiere of ''[[Crime and Punishment (play)|Crime and Punishment]]'' adapted by Marilyn Campbell and [[Curt Columbus]],&lt;ref name="Simmons"&gt;{{cite web|last=Simmons|first=Paulanne|title=A CurtainUp Review: Crime and Punishment|url=http://www.curtainup.com/crimeandpunishment07.html|publisher=CurtainUp.com|accessdate=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Genzlinger"&gt;{{cite news|last=Genzlinger|first=Neil|title=Dostoyevsky's Homicidal Student, the 90-Minute Version |url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2007/11/09/theater/reviews/09crim.html?scp=1&amp;sq=crime%20and%20punishment%20Marilyn%20Campbell&amp;st=cse|accessdate=11 July 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|date=9 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has received more than 30 subsequent regional theater productions.

In 2011, [[Lincoln Center Theater]] produced another work that began at Writers Theatre: ''A Minister's Wife'', a musical adaptation of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Candida (play)|Candida]]'', conceived and directed by Halberstam, with music by Joshua Schmidt, lyrics by Jan Trannen and book by Austin Pendleton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Isherwood|first1=Charles|title='A Minister's Wife,' at Mitzi E.

==Critical Reception==

Writers Theatre has grown to become a cultural destination with a national reputation for excellence, being called "America's No. 1 theatre company" by ''The Wall Street Journal'', who said in 2008, "The best drama company [in the nation] is to be found not in New York, but in Glencoe,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Teachout|first1=Terry|title=Peripatetic Critic's Picks|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123005221542830311|website=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=1 June 2017|date=27 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2016 named Writers Theatre "Company of the Year," adding "The best regional drama company in America now has a home worthy of its shows."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Teachout|first1=Terry|title=The Best Theater of 2016: Away From the Great White Way|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-best-theater-of-2016-away-from-the-great-white-way-1481727604|website=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=4 June 2017|date=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company, which plays to a sold-out audience of more than 50,000 patrons each season, has garnered critical praise for the consistent high quality and intimacy of its artistry. Its 2010 production of ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire]]'' directed by [[David Cromer]] was reviewed as "the most uniformly well-acted production yet seen" by [[The New York Times]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Isherwood|first1=Charles|title=Small Space, Big Egos: Something Will Explode|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/19/theater/reviews/19streetcar.html?pagewanted=all&amp;module=Search&amp;mabReward=relbias%3Ar|website=The New York Times|accessdate=1 June 2017|date=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has garnered numerous awards and accolades, including 113 [[Joseph Jefferson Award]] nominations and 26 awards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3199">'''Zecchino d'Oro''' ({{IPA-it|dzekˈkiːno ˈdɔːro; tsek-}}; meaning "Golden [[Sequin (coin)|Sequin]]") is an international children's song festival that has taken place every year since 1959. It is broadcast by [[Rai 1]].

It was started by [[Cino Tortorella]], and the first two festivals were held in [[Milan]]. In 1961, the festival was taken up by the [[Antoniano Institute]] and moved to [[Bologna]]. In 2009, Cino Tortorella left Zecchino d'Oro.

[[Image:Zecchinodoro.jpg|180px|right]]
In 1963, [[Mariele Ventre]], a conductor and director of young performers, created the [[Piccolo Coro dell'Antoniano]] Children's Choir (called Piccolo Coro "Mariele Ventre" dell'Antoniano after her death in 1995, and directed by [[Sabrina Simoni]]).
From 1976 the festival took on an international perspective - each year seven Italian songs and seven foreign songs are sung by children and voted for by a children's jury. The winning song is rewarded with the Zecchino d'Oro award.

As has been regularly stated during the event, the winners of the Zecchino d'Oro and Zecchino d'Argento are the writers and composers of the songs, not the children who interpret them. This rule applies to all editions.

Younger songwriters are Yumiko Ashikawa (芦川祐美子, 7, who also has sung her song), Miruna Codruța Oprea (13), Ioachim Octavian Petre (13) and Lara Polli (13).

'''Zoomorphic architecture''' is the practice of using animal forms as the inspirational basis and blueprint for architectural design.  "While animal forms have always played a role adding some of the deepest layers of meaning in architecture, it is now becoming evident that a new strand of [[biomorphism]] is emerging where the meaning derives not from any specific representation but from a more general allusion to biological processes."&lt;ref name="zoomorphic" /&gt;

The practice is said by some to be a reaction against some of the modern schools of architecture, such as [[Modernism]] and their apparent opposition to nature and organic form.  Commenting on the movement away from these rigid and artificial design trends, Susannah Hagan, in her book ''Taking Shape'', has this to say: "The oppositions between culture and nature, so importantly and brutally drawn up by modernism, are dissolving again, not in a return to what was, but a transformation of it...The division between the living organism and the machine continues to collapse."&lt;ref name="hagan" /&gt;

==Famous works==

Some well-known examples of Zoomorphic architecture can be found in the [[TWA Flight Center]] building in [[New York City]], by [[Eero Saarinen]], or the [[Milwaukee Art Museum]] by [[Santiago Calatrava]], both inspired by the form of a bird’s wings.&lt;ref name="NYT08" /&gt;

Also the Oriental village by the sea by [[Basil Al Bayati]] which "is based upon Oriental building types arranged in a plan originating in patterns of insect and plant life.  The exoskeleton of a dragonfly forms the main body of the building's layout, its triangular mouth of stairs on the waterfront leading to the creature's circular head of the entrance lobby. The insect's long segmented yellow body is the central corridor, dome-lit, which intertwines with a branch of a tree, its stem a road and its leaves the roofs of condominiums and leisure facilities.  The colourful berries are cone-topped villas intended to be reminiscent of Chinese temples."&lt;ref name="Bingham" /&gt;
