== The concept of an ACM ==
The anti-cult movement is conceptualized as a collection of individuals and groups, whether formally organized or not, who oppose some new religious movements (or "[[cult]]s"). This [[countermovement]] has reportedly recruited participants from family members of "cultists", former group members (or [[apostates]]), religious groups (including [[Judaism|Jewish]] groups)&lt;ref&gt;Feher, Shoshanah. 1994. "Maintaining the Faith: The Jewish Anti-Cult and Counter-Missionary Movement, pp. 33–48 in Anson Shupe and David G. Bromley ''Anti-Cult Movements in Cross-Cultural Perspective'', New York, NY: Garland.
&lt;/ref&gt; and associations of health professionals.&lt;ref&gt;Shupe, Anson and David G. Bromley. 1994. "The Modern Anti-Cult Movement in North America," pp. 3–31 in Anson Shupe and David G. Bromley ''Anti-Cult Movements in Cross-Cultural Perspective'', New York, NY: Garland, p. 3.&lt;br&gt;Barker, Eileen. 1995 The Scientific Study of Religion? You Must Be Joking!", ''Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion'' 34 (3): 287–310, p. 297.
&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is a trend towards globalization,&lt;ref&gt;Shupe, Anson and David G. Bromley. 1994. "Introduction," pp. vii–xi in Anson Shupe and David G. Bromley ''Anti-Cult Movements in Cross-Cultural Perspective'', New York, NY: Garland, p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; the social and organizational bases vary significantly from country to country according to the social and political [[opportunity structures]] in each place.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Richardson (sociologist)|Richardson, James T.]] and Barend von Driel. 1994 "New Religious Movements in Europe: Developments and Reactions," pp. 129–70 in Anson Shupe and David G. Bromley ''Anti-Cult Movements in Cross-Cultural Perspective'', New York, NY: Garland, pp. 137ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

As with many subjects in the social sciences, the movement is variously defined. A significant minority opinion suggests that analysis should treat the secular anti-cult movement separately from the religiously motivated (mainly Christian) groups.&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, Douglas E. 2002. [http://journalsonline.tandf.co.uk/link.asp?id=uul6l9b0cc8cy0lw "Exits and Migrations: Foregrounding the Christian Counter-cult"]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[Journal of Contemporary Religion]]'' 17 (3): 339–54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/cultsect/anticounter.htm "Cult Group Controversies: Conceptualizing 'Anti-Cult' and 'Counter-Cult'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827231058/http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/cultsect/anticounter.htm |date=2006-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-cult movement might be divided into four classes:

# secular counter-cult groups;
# Christian evangelical counter-cult groups;
# groups formed to counter a specific cult; and
# organizations that offer some form of exit counseling.&lt;ref&gt;Chryssides, George D. 1999. ''Exploring New Religions.'' London &amp; New York: Cassell, p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most, if not all, the groups involved express the view that there are potentially deleterious effects associated with some new religious movements.&lt;ref&gt;Possamaï, Adam and Murray Lee. 2004. "New Religious Movements and the Fear of Crime," ''[[Journal of Contemporary Religion]]'' 19 (3): 337–52, p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Practices--&gt;

=== Religious and secular critics ===

Commentators differentiate two main types of opposition to "cults":

* religious opposition: related to [[theology|theological]] issues.
* secular opposition: related to emotional, social, financial, and economic consequences of cult involvement, where "cult" can refer to a religious or to a secular group.

=== Barker's five types of cult-watching groups ===

According to sociologist [[Eileen Barker]], cult-watching groups (CWGs) disseminate information about "cults" with the intent of changing public and government perception as well as of changing [[public policy]] regarding [[new religious movements|NRMs]].

Barker has identified five types of CWG:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cesnur.org/2001/london2001/barker.htm|title=CESNUR 2001 - Cult-Watching Groups (Barker)|first=|last=moreorless|date=|website=www.cesnur.org|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# cult-awareness groups (CAGs) focusing on the harm done by "destructive cults"
# counter-cult groups (CCGs) focusing on the (heretical) teaching of non-mainstream groups
# research-oriented groups (ROGs) focusing on beliefs, practices and comparisons
# human-rights groups (HRGs) focusing on the human rights of religious minorities
# cult-defender groups (CDGs) focusing on defending cults and exposing CAGs

=== Hadden's taxonomy of the anti-cult movement ===

[[Jeffrey K. Hadden]] sees four distinct classes of opposition to "cults":&lt;ref&gt;
[[Jeffrey K. Hadden|Hadden, Jeffrey K.]], ''SOC 257: New Religious Movements Lectures: The Anti-Cult Movement'', University of Virginia, Department of Sociology
&lt;/ref&gt;

#'''Opposition grounded on Religion'''
#*Opposition usually defined in theological terms.
#*Cults considered heretical.
#*Endeavors to expose the heresy and correct the beliefs of those who have strayed from a truth.
#*Prefers metaphors of deception rather than possession.
#*Serves two important functions:
#**protects members (especially youth) from heresy, and
#**increases solidarity among the faithful.
#'''Secular opposition'''
#*Regards individual autonomy as the manifest goal – achieved by getting people out of groups using [[mind control]] and deceptive proselytization.
#*Regards the struggle as an issue of control rather than theology.
#*Organizes around families of children currently or previously involved in a cult.
#*Has the unannounced goal of disabling or destroying NRMs organizationally.
#'''Apostates'''
#*Former members who consider themselves egregiously wronged by a cult, often with the coordination and encouragement of anti-cult groups.
#'''Entrepreneurial opposition'''
#*A few "[[entrepreneur]]s" who have made careers of organizing opposition groups.
#*Broadcasters, journalists, and lawyers who base a reputation or career on anti-cult activities

== Cult-watching groups and individuals, and other opposition to cults ==

=== Family-members of adherents ===

Some opposition to cults (and to some new religious movements) started with family-members of cult-adherents who had problems with the sudden changes in character, lifestyle and future plans of their young adult children who had joined NRMs. [[Ted Patrick]], widely known as "the father of [[deprogramming]]", exemplifies members of this group. The former [[Cult Awareness Network]] (old CAN) grew out of a [[grassroots]]-movement by parents of cult-members. The [[American Family Foundation]] ({{As of|2007|alt= today}} the [[International Cultic Studies Association]]) originated from a father whose daughter had joined a high-control group.

=== Clinical psychologists and psychiatrists ===

From the 1970s onwards some psychiatrists and clinical psychologists accused "cults" of harming some of their members. These accusations were sometimes based on observations made during therapy, and sometimes were related to theories regarding brainwashing or mind-control.

=== Former members ===
{{See also|Apostasy#Other religious movements|l1=Apostasy in alleged cults and new religious movements}}

[[Anson Shupe]], [[David G. Bromley]] and Joseph Ventimiglia coined the term [[atrocity story|''atrocity tales'']] in 1979,&lt;ref&gt;
Bromley, David G., Shupe, Anson D., Ventimiglia, G.C.: "Atrocity Tales, the Unification Church, and the Social Construction of Evil", ''Journal of Communication'', Summer 1979, p. 42–53.
&lt;/ref&gt; which [[Bryan R. Wilson]] later took up in relation to former members' narratives. Bromley and Shupe defined an "atrocity tale" as the symbolic presentation of action or events, real or imagined, in such a context that they come to flagrantly violate the (presumably) shared premises upon which a given set of social relationships should take place. The recounting of such tales has the intention of reaffirming normative boundaries. By sharing the reporter's disapproval or horror, an audience reasserts normative prescription and clearly locates the violator beyond the limits of [[public morality]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christian countercult movement ===
{{Main|Christian countercult movement}}
In the 1940s, the long-held opposition by some established Christian denominations to non-Christian religions or supposedly [[heresy|heretical]], or counterfeit, Christian sects crystallized into a more organized [[Christian countercult movement|Christian counter cult movement]] in the United States. For those belonging to the movement, all religious groups claiming to be Christian, but deemed outside of Christian [[orthodoxy]], were considered "cults".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cowan2003|Cowan]], 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Christian cults are new religious movements which have a Christian background but are considered to be [[Theology|theologically]] deviant by members of other Christian churches.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Gordon Melton]], ''Encyclopedic Handbook of Cults in America'' (New York/London: Garland, 1986; revised edition, Garland, 1992). p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; In his influential book ''[[The Kingdom of the Cults]]'', first published in the United States in 1965, Christian scholar [[Walter Ralston Martin|Walter Martin]] defines Christian cults as groups that follow the personal interpretation of an individual, rather than the understanding of the [[Bible]] accepted by [[mainstream Christianity]]. He mentions [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], [[Christian Science]], the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Unitarian Universalism]], and [[Unity Church|Unity]] as examples.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Ralston Martin, ''The Kingdom of the Cults'', Bethany House, 2003, {{ISBN|0764228218}}  p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian countercult movement asserts that Christian sects whose beliefs are partially or wholly not in accordance with the [[Bible]] are erroneous. It also states that a religious sect can be considered a "cult" if its beliefs involve a denial of what they view as any of the essential [[Christian]] teachings such as [[salvation]], the [[Trinity]], [[Jesus]] himself as a person, the [[ministry of Jesus]], the [[Miracles of Jesus]], the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]], the [[Death of Christ]], the [[Resurrection of Christ]], the [[Second Coming of Christ]], and the [[Rapture]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter R. Martin, ''The Rise of the Cults'', rev.ed. Santa Ana: Vision House, 1978, pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Abanes, ''Defending the Faith: A Beginner's Guide to Cults and New Religions'', Grand Rapids: Baker Book House, 1997, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Wayne House &amp; Gordon Carle, ''Doctrine Twisting: How Core Biblical Truths are Distorted'', Downers Grove: IVP, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Countercult literature usually expresses doctrinal or theological concerns and a [[missionary]] or [[apologetics|apologetic]] purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Garry W. Trompf,"Missiology, Methodology and the Study of New Religious Movements," ''Religious Traditions'' Volume 10, 1987, pp. 95–106.&lt;/ref&gt; It presents a rebuttal by emphasizing the teachings of the [[Bible]] against the beliefs of non-fundamental Christian sects. Christian countercult activist writers also emphasize the need for Christians to [[evangelism|evangelize]] to followers of cults.&lt;ref&gt;Walter R. Martin, ''The Kingdom of the Cults'', rev.ed. Ravi Zacharias ed. Bloomington: Bethany House, 2003, pp. 479–93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Enroth ed. ''Evangelising the Cults'', Milton Keynes: Word, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman L Geisler &amp; Ron Rhodes, ''When Cultists Ask: A Popular Handbook on Cultic Misinterpretations'', Grand Rapids: Baker Book House, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governmental opposition===
{{details|Governmental lists of cults and sects}}

The secular opposition to cults and new religious movements operates internationally, though a number of sizable and sometimes expanding groups originated in the United States. Some European countries, such as France, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland have introduced legislation or taken other measures against cults or "cultic deviations".

In the Netherlands "[[cult]]s", [[sect]]s, and [[new religious movement]]s have the same legal rights as larger and more mainstream religious movements.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Singelenberg|Singelenberg, Richard]] ''Foredoomed to Failure: the Anti-Cult Movement in the Netherlands'' in ''Regulating religion: case studies from around the globe'', redacted by [[James T. Richardson]], Springer, 2004, {{ISBN|0-306-47887-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-306-47887-1}}, pp. 214–15&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2004, the Netherlands do not have an anti-cult movement of any significance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Singelenberg|Singelenberg, Richard]] ''Foredoomed to Failure: the Anti-Cult Movement in the Netherlands'' in ''Regulating religion: case studies from around the globe'', redacted by [[James T. Richardson]], Springer, 2004, {{ISBN|0-306-47887-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-306-47887-1}}, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

== National anti-cult movements ==
===United States===
The first organised opposition to new religions in the United States appeared in 1972 with the formation of FREECOG (Parents Committee to Free Our Sons and Daughters from the Children of God).{{sfn|Barrett|2001|pp=98–99}} In 1973 FREECOG renamed itself as the Volunteer Parents of America, and then the Citizens Freedom Foundation (CFF), before becoming the Cult Awareness Network (CAN) in 1984.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=99}}  In 1987, [[Ian Harworth]] founded another such group, the [[Cult Information Centre]].{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=102}}  In 1979, another anti-cult group, the American Family Foundation (AFF) was founded; it began organising annual conferences, launching an information phone line, and publishing the ''Cult Observer'' and the ''Cultic Studies Journal''.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=99}} The CAN and AFF were separate organisations although fashioned a number of joint boards and programmes.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=99}} In 1996 the CAN was sued for its involvement in the deprogramming of a member of the [[American Pentecostal Church]]. This bankrupted the organisation, and its name was purchased by a group which included a number of Scientologists.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=101}} In the 1970s and 1980s American anti-cultist [[Ted Patrick]] was convicted several times for [[kidnapping]] and [[unlawful imprisonment]] for his deprograming activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Brigham Young University Law Review|title=Regulation of religious proselytism in the United States|url=http://lawreview.byu.edu/archives/2001/2/hun6.pdf|format=PDF|author1=Hunter, Howard O. |author2=Price, Polly J. |year=2001|volume=2001|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-08301980"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ted Patrick Convicted of Seizing Woman Said to Have Joined Cult; Escaped From Abductors|date=August 30, 1980|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1980/08/30/archives/ted-patrick-convicted-of-seizing-woman-said-to-have-joined-cult.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, the politician [[Paul Rose (British politician)|Paul Rose]] established an anti-cult group called FAIR (Family Action Information and Resource) in 1976.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=101}}

===Russia===
In [[Russia]] "anticultism" appeared in early 1990s. Some Russian [[Protestantism|Protestants]] criticized foreign missionaries, sects and new religious movements. They perhaps hoped that taking part in anti-cult declarations could demonstrate that they were not "sectarians".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Effects of the Western anti-cult movement on development of laws concerning religion in post-communist Russia MS Shterin, JT Richardson - Journal of Church and State, 2000 - JSTOR&lt;/ref&gt; Some religious studies have shown that anti-cult movements, especially with support of the government, can provoke serious religious conflicts in Russian society.&lt;ref name="iv"&gt;{{cite web|author=Сергей Иваненко|date=2009-08-17|url=http://www.sclj.ru/news/detail.php?SECTION_ID=214&amp;ELEMENT_ID=2546|script-title=ru:О религиоведческих аспектах "антикультового движения"|language=ru|publisher=|accessdate=2009-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs]] prepared a list of "extremist groups". At the top of the list were Islamic groups outside of "traditional Islam", which is supervised by the Russian government. Next listed were "[[Modern paganism|Pagan cults]]".&lt;ref&gt;''The new nobility : the restoration of Russia's security state and the enduring legacy of the KGB'', Author: Andreĭ Soldatov; I Borogan,
Publisher: New York, NY : PublicAffairs, ©2010. pp. 65–66&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the [[Ministry of Justice (Russia)|Russian Ministry of Justice]] created a council which it named the ''Council of Experts Conducting State Religious Studies Expert Analysis''. The new council listed 80 large sects which it considered potentially dangerous to Russian society, and mentioned that there were thousands of smaller ones.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Large sects listed included [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and what were called "neo-Pentecostals."&lt;ref&gt;''Persecuted: The Global Assault on Christians (Google eBook), Paul Marshall, 2013, Thomas Nelson Inc&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==

=== Polarized views among scholars ===

Social scientists, sociologists, religious scholars, psychologists and psychiatrists have studied the modern field of "cults" and new religious movements since the early 1980s. Debates about certain purported cults and about cults in general often become polarized with widely divergent opinions, not only among current followers and disaffected former members, but sometimes among scholars as well.

All academics agree that some groups have become problematic and sometimes very problematic, but they disagree over the extent to which new religious movements in general cause harm.&lt;ref&gt;The Future of New Religious Movements, By David G. Bromley https://books.google.com/books?id=NHNeOx8UZJYC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bryan R. Wilson|Bryan Wilson]] makes this point in his paper saying that the Bruderhof is not a cult, pointing out that the public imagination is captured by five events that have occurred in religious groups: [[Jonestown]], the [[Branch Davidians]], [[Order of the Solar Temple|Solar Temple]], [[Aum Shinrikyo]] and [[Heaven's Gate (religious group)|Heaven's Gate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/Is-the-Bruderhof-a-cult|title=Is the Bruderhof a cult? - Quora|website=www.quora.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/115621228/Why-the-Bruderhof-is-not-a-cult-by-Bryan-Wilson|title=Why the Bruderhof is not a cult - by Bryan Wilson {{!}} Cult And Sect {{!}} Religion And Belief|website=Scribd|language=en|access-date=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several scholars have questioned Hadden's attitude towards NRMs and cult critics as one-sided.&lt;ref&gt;
Robbins and Zablocki 2001, Beit-Hallahmi 2001, Kent and Krebs 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars in the field of new religious movements confront many controversial subjects:
* The validity of the testimonies of [[#Former members|former members]].
* The validity of the testimonies of current members.
* The validity of and differences between [[Deprogramming#Exit counseling|exit counseling]] and coercive [[deprogramming]].
* The validity of evidence of harm caused by "cults". 
* Ethical concerns regarding new religious movements, for example [[free will]] and [[freedom of speech]].
* Opposition to "cults" vs. [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious intolerance]].
* The objectivity of all scholars studying new religious movements (see [[NRM apologist]]s).

=== Brainwashing and mind-control ===
{{further|Mind control#New religious movements}}
Over the years various controversial theories of [[religious conversion|conversion]] and member retention have been proposed that link mind control to NRMs, and particularly those religious movements referred to as "[[cult]]s" by their critics. These theories resemble the original political brainwashing theories first developed by the [[CIA]] as a propaganda device to combat communism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[Philip Zimbardo]] discusses mind control as "... the process by which individual or collective freedom of choice and action is compromised by agents or agencies that modify or distort perception, motivation, affect, cognition and/or behavioral outcomes",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zimbardo |first=Philip G. |authorlink=Philip Zimbardo |date=November 2002 |title=Mind Control: Psychological Reality or Mindless Rhetoric? |journal=Monitor on Psychology |url=http://www.icsahome.com/infoserv_articles/zimbardo_philip_mindcontrol.htm |accessdate=2008-12-30 |quote=Mind control is the process by which individual or collective freedom of choice and action is compromised by agents or agencies that modify or distort perception, motivation, affect, cognition and/or behavioral outcomes. ... In some combinations, they create a powerful crucible of extreme mental and behavioral [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] when synthesized with several other real-world factors, such as charismatic, authoritarian leaders, dominant ideologies, social isolation, physical debilitation, induced phobias, and extreme threats or promised rewards that are typically deceptively orchestrated, over an extended time period in settings where they are applied intensively. A body of social science evidence shows that when systematically practiced by state-sanctioned police, military or destructive cults, mind control can induce false confessions, create converts who willingly torture or kill 'invented enemies,' and engage indoctrinated members to work tirelessly, give up their money—and even their lives—for 'the cause.' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113001223/http://www.icsahome.com/infoserv_articles/zimbardo_philip_mindcontrol.htm |archivedate=2009-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he suggests that any human being is susceptible to such manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zimbardo |first=P |authorlink=Philip Zimbardo |url= http://www.csj.org/studyindex/studycult/study_zimbar.htm |page=14 |title=What messages are behind today's cults? |journal=Monitor on Psychology |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1999 book, [[Robert Jay Lifton|Robert Lifton]] also applied his original ideas about thought reform to [[Aum Shinrikyo]], concluding that in this context thought reform was possible without violence or physical coercion. [[Margaret Singer]], who also spent time studying the political brainwashing of Korean prisoners of war, agreed with this conclusion: in her book ''[[Cults in Our Midst]]'' she describes six conditions which would create an atmosphere in which thought reform is possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refocus.org/singerne.html ''Cults in Our Midst: The Continuing Fight Against Their Hidden Menace''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202034934/http://www.refocus.org/singerne.html |date=February 2, 2015 }}, Margaret Thaler Singer, Jossey-Bass, publisher, April 2003, {{ISBN|0-7879-6741-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James T. Richardson]] observes that if the NRMs had access to powerful brainwashing techniques, one would expect that NRMs would have high growth rates, yet in fact most have not had notable success in recruitment. Most adherents participate for only a short time, and the success in retaining members is limited.&lt;ref name= 'Richardson1985'&gt;{{cite journal |title=The active vs. passive convert: paradigm conflict in conversion/recruitment research |journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |date=June 1985 |first=James T. |last=Richardson |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=163–79 |doi=10.2307/1386340 |publisher=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, Vol. 24, No. 2 |jstor=1386340}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this and other reasons, sociologists of religion including [[David G. Bromley]] and [[Anson D. Shupe]] consider the idea that cults are brainwashing American youth to be "implausible".&lt;ref name="brain_wash"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/brain_wa.htm|title=Brainwashing by Religious Cults|author=|date=|website=religioustolerance.org|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Bromley, [[Thomas Robbins (sociologist)|Thomas Robbins]], [[Dick Anthony]], [[Eileen Barker]], [[Newton Maloney]], [[Massimo Introvigne]], John Hall, [[Lorne L. Dawson]], Anson D. Shupe, [[J. Gordon Melton]], [[Marc Galanter (psychiatrist)|Marc Galanter]], Saul Levine of [[Mount Wilson FM Broadcasters, Inc]], amongst other scholars researching NRMs, have argued and established to the satisfaction of courts, relevant professional associations and scientific communities that there exists no scientific theory, generally accepted and based upon methodologically sound research, that supports the brainwashing theories as advanced by the anti-cult movement.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, James T. 2009. "Religion and The Law" in The Oxford Handbook of the Sociology of Religion. Peter Clarke. (ed) Oxford Handbooks Online. p. 426&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deprogramming or exit-counseling ===

{{further|Deprogramming}}

Some members of the secular opposition to cults and to some new religious movements have argued that if brainwashing has deprived a person of their free will, treatment to restore their free will should take place, even if the "victim" opposes this.

Precedents for this exist in the treatment of certain [[mental illness]]es: in such cases medical and legal authorities recognize the condition as depriving sufferers of their ability to make appropriate decisions for themselves. But the practice of forcing treatment on a presumed victim of "brainwashing" (one definition of "[[deprogramming]]") has constantly proven controversial. [[human rights|Human-rights]] organizations (including the [[ACLU]] and [[Human Rights Watch]]) have criticized deprogramming, too. While only a small fraction of the anti-cult movement has had involvement in deprogramming, several deprogrammers (including a deprogramming-pioneer, [[Ted Patrick]]) have served prison-terms for acts sometimes associated with deprogramming including kidnapping and rape, while courts have acquitted others.&lt;ref name="nyt-08301980" /&gt;

=== Responses of targeted groups and scholars ===
The Foundation against Intolerance of Religious Minorities, associated with the [[Adidam]] NRM, sees the use of terms "cult" and "cult leader" as detestable and as something to avoid at all costs. The Foundation regards such usage as the exercise of prejudice and discrimination against them in the same manner as the words "[[nigger]]" and "commie" served in the past to denigrate [[black (people)|blacks]] and [[communism|Communists]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.firmstand.org/ The Foundation Against Intolerance of Minority Religions]
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CESNUR]]'s president [[Massimo Introvigne]], writes in his article ''"So many evil things: Anti-cult terrorism via the Internet"'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cesnur.org/testi/anticult_terror.htm|title=CESNUR - "So Many Evil Things": Anti-Cult Terrorism via the Internet|first=|last=MoreOrLess|date=|website=www.cesnur.org|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that fringe and extreme anti-cult activists resort to tactics that may create a background favorable to extreme manifestations of [[discrimination]] and [[hate]] against individuals that belong to new religious movements. Professor [[Eileen Barker]] points out in an interview that the controversy surrounding certain new religious movements can turn violent by a process called [[deviancy amplification spiral]].&lt;ref&gt;
Interview with Eileen Barker, ''Introducing New Religious Movements'' [http://www.fathom.com/feature/121938/ Available online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014065725/http://www.fathom.com/feature/121938/ |date=2007-10-14 }} (Retrieved 2007-10-17 'What can be observed in most of these tragedies is a process which sociologists sometimes call "deviance amplification" building up. The antagonists on each side behave rather badly, and that gives permission for the other side to behave more badly, so you get this spiral and increasing polarisation with each side saying: "Look what they did."')
&lt;/ref&gt;

In a paper presented at the 2000 meeting of the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion, Anson Shupe and Susan Darnell argued that although the [[International Cultic Studies Association]] (ICSA, formerly known as AFF or American Family Foundation) has presented "... slanted, stereotypical images and language that has inflamed persons to perform extreme actions", the extent to which one can classify the ICSA and other anti-cult organizations as "[[hate group|hate-group]]s" (as defined by law in some jurisdictions or by racial or ethnic criteria in sociology) remains open to debate. In 2005, the Hate Crimes Unit of the Edmonton Police Service confiscated anti-[[Falun Gong]] materials distributed at the annual conference of the ICSA by staff members of the Chinese Consulate in [[Calgary]]. The materials, including the calling of Falun Gong a "cult", were identified as having breached the Criminal Code, which bans the willful promotion of hatred against identifiable religious groups&lt;ref&gt;[http://organharvestinvestigation.net/ Edmonton Police Report of Wilful Promotion of Hatred by Chinese Consular Officials against Falun Gong], Appendix 8 to "Bloody Harvest: Revised Report into Allegations of Organ Harvesting of Falun Gong Practitioners in China," By David Matas, Esq. and Hon. David Kilgour, Esq.&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Hate group#Verbal violence|Verbal violence in hate groups]]).

An article on the categorization of new religious movements in US media published by ''The Association for the Sociology of Religion'' (formerly the American ''Catholic Sociological Society'') criticizes the print media for failing to recognize social-scientific efforts in the area of new religious movements, and its tendency to use anti-cultist definitions rather than social-scientific insight, and asserts that ''The failure of the print media to recognize social-scientific efforts in the area of religious movement organizations (as our previous research [van Driel and Richardson, 1985] also shows) impels us to add yet another failing mark to the media report card Weiss (1985) has constructed to assess the media's reporting of the social sciences.''&lt;ref&gt;van Driel, Barend and James T. Richardson. ''Research Note Categorization of New Religious Movements in American Print Media''. Sociological Analysis 1988, 49, 2:171–83&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bandian Fire Temple''' is an archaeological site in [[Dargaz County]], [[Razavi Khorasan Province]], [[Iran]], near the medieval city [[Abiward]].&lt;ref name=sasanika /&gt; The primary excavations were carried out to reveal precious remains of art and architecture of the pre-Islamic Iran, dating from the [[Sassanian]] period (224-651 AD) when the archaeological significance of Bandian was recognized.

Found at the site, near the town of [[Dargaz]] were a stucco-decorated hall with columns, Sassanian Pahlavi inscriptions, and at last the some remains of brick architecture, which are considered to be one of the most invaluable finds of that period. Additionally, the excavations yielded a [[Zoroastrian]] sanctuary, with a substantial amount of its decoration and design features undamaged. while the upper parts of the stucco reliefs were not preserved, but a good deal had remained in place (info from Bandian of Daregaz).

Throughout six seasons of the site's excavations, the building's central part was found; its main hall, measuring 10.25x8.45 m, as well as a number of rooms and corridors were unearthed. The hall had four lime columns that supported the flat ceiling of the structure. The columns' strengthening structure is quite interesting. Another outstanding facet of the building is its mihrab (arched niche) in about 2.80x1.70 m.

The large hall features extensive stucco reliefs, depicting scenes of a hunt, battle, triumph, ritual, investiture, and banquet.&lt;ref name=sasanika /&gt; It contains depictions of Persian victories in the [[Hephthalite–Persian Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;https://iranatlas.info/atashkade/atashkade52.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The complex has been dated to the reign of [[Peroz]] (459-484 CE) or his son [[Kavad I]] (488-497 CE).&lt;ref name=sasanika /&gt;

The excavated area has been turned into a site-museum.&lt;ref name=sasanika&gt;https://www.sasanika.org/sites/bandiyan/&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ceremonial magic]], '''banishing''' refers to one or more rituals intended to remove non-physical influences ranging from spirits to negative influences.&lt;ref name="magick"&gt;{{cite book |title=Magick in Theory and Practice |last=Crowley |first=Aleister |authorlink=Aleister Crowley |pages=103–6 |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/oto/lib4.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although banishing rituals are often used as components of more complex ceremonies, they can also be performed by themselves.

In [[Wicca]] and various forms of [[neopaganism]], banishing is performed before [[Magic circle|casting a Circle]] in order to purify the area where the ritual or magic is about to take place. In his books on Nocturnal Witchcraft, for example, [[Konstantinos]] recommends performing banishings regularly, in order to keep the magical workspace free of negativity, and to become proficient in banishing before attempting acts that are much more spiritually taxing on the body, such as magical spellworking.&lt;ref&gt;Konstantinos.''Nocturnal Witchcraft: Magick After Dark''. St. Paul, Minn:Llewellyn Publications, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Banishing can be viewed as one of several [[Magick (Aleister Crowley)#Techniques of Magick|techniques of magick]], closely related to [[ritual purification]] and a typical prerequisite for [[consecration]] and [[invocation]].

For actual workings [[Aleister Crowley]] recommends a short, general banishing, with a comment that "in more elaborate ceremonies it is usual to banish everything by name." &lt;ref name="magick"/&gt;

Crowley also recommended that a banishing ritual be done at least once daily by [[Thelemites|Thelema]] in ''Liber Aleph vel CXI''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crowley|first=Aleister|title=Liber Aleph vel CXI|publisher=A.:.A.:.|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/oto/aleph_1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], the ''[[Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram]]'' ([[LBRP]] for shorthand) must be learned by the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn#The Grades of the Golden Dawn|Neophyte]] before moving on to the next grade ([[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn#The Grades of the Golden Dawn|Zelator]]).&lt;ref&gt;The Golden Dawn by I.

The roots of '''[[Buddhism]] in [[Poland]]''' can be found in the early 20th century in the nation's connections to the origin countries of the religion, like [[Vietnam]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://nguoiphattu.com/?id/343/ba-lan-dai-le-vu-lan-tai-thanh-pho-krakow Ba Lan: Đại lễ Vu lan tại thành phố Krakow]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nguoiphattu.com/?id/304/ba-lan-chua-thien-viet-warszawa-to-chuc-le-vu-lan Ba Lan: Chùa Thiên Việt - Warszawa tổ chức lễ Vu Lan]&lt;/ref&gt; [[China]], [[Japan]], and [[Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vesakday.mcu.ac.th/vesak50/article/pdf_file/03_Buddhism_in_Poland-17May.pdf Buddhism in Poland - by Joanna Grela]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War II]], primarily expatriate Poles joined various Buddhist groups and organizations. Since the breakdown of the [[Eastern Bloc]], which promoted an [[Polish anti-religious campaign (1945–1990)|antireligious campaign]], Buddhism has been able to develop further in the more tolerant atmosphere.

Today all of the principal schools of Buddhism including [[Mahayana]] ([[Zen]] and [[Jodo Shinshu]]) and [[Tibetan Buddhism]] can be found in Poland. Movements like the [[Friends of the Western Buddhist Order]] are also active in the country. Umbrella organizations like the [[Buddhist mission]] (''Misja Buddyjska'') and the Buddhist Union of Poland unite more than two dozen groups of Buddhists. The [[Diamond Way]] centres founded and directed by [[Ole Nydahl]] are also active in Poland.

In May 2000, the XIV Dalai Lama [[Tenzin Gyatso]] opened a Buddhist department in the [[Pomeranian Library]] in [[Szczecin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dalailama.com/news/post/292-dalai-lama-lecture-draws-thousands-in-poland |title=Dalai Lama Lecture Draws Thousands in Poland |access-date=2013-07-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420183825/http://dalailama.com/news/post/292-dalai-lama-lecture-draws-thousands-in-poland |archive-date=2014-04-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chaquén''' was the [[deity|god]] of [[sport]]s and [[fertility]] in the [[Muisca religion and mythology|religion of the Muisca]].&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, Ch.10, p.63&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Muisca people|Muisca]] and their [[Muisca Confederation|confederation]] were one of the four advanced civilizations of the [[Americas]] and as they were warriors, sports was very important to train the fighters for wars, mainly fought between the ''[[zipa]]zgo'' and the ''[[zaque|zacazgo]]'' but also against other [[indigenous peoples of Colombia|indigenous peoples]] as the [[Panche people|Panches]], [[Muzo people|Muzos]] and others. When the [[Spanish conquest of the Americas|Spanish]] arrived in the highlands of central [[Colombia]], the [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]], they encountered resistance of the [[guecha warrior]]s, trained by Chaquén.
{{stack|[[File:Tejo field full.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The game of [[tejo (sport)|tejo]]&lt;br&gt;national sport of Colombia]]}}

== Description ==
Chaquén flew over the boundaries of the sowing fields of the rich agriculture of the Muisca. During the contests and festivities of the Muisca people Chaquén manifestated himself. 17th century [[chronicler]] [[Pedro Simón]] said about Chaquén: "The Muisca organized races on their holidays where the [[vassal]]s of the ''[[cacique]]s'' would compete in many aspects; dances with new inventions and a lot of [[feather]]s, [[flute]]s, horns and drums. The people would have interludes with delights, wearing uniforms and many of them wore animal skins with [[diadem]]s of fine gold. As prizes for the winners there were richly decorated mantles and the festivities were celebrated with a lot of ''[[chicha#Colombia|chicha]]''.&lt;ref name=p64&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, Ch.10, p.64&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first months of the [[Muisca calendar|year]], the people celebrated their agricultural festivities around the edges of their crop fields honouring Chaquén to ensure a good harvest. With playing flutes and horns the men would dance holding hands with the women and sang both happy and sad songs. They held the earthenware bowls filled with ''chicha'' in their hands. The festivities not only served to get good harvest, as well to gain partners; men and women, all drunk would find each other at these celebrations and the ''caciques'' and other nobles gained their women here".&lt;ref name=p64/&gt;

The honouring of Chaquén was a celebration of [[fertility]], not only for the agriculture, but also for the people. Sexual rites were encompassed with a lot of feathers and costumes also used in the warfare of the Muisca.&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, Ch.10, p.65&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
Chaquén not only was the god of sports and fertility, he also made sure those who committed [[adultery]] were punished, like happened to Tintoa and Sunuba. The young and brave [[guecha warrior]] Tintoa fell in love with the beautiful Sunuba, principal wife&amp;nbsp;– the Muisca had extensive [[polygamy]]&amp;nbsp;– of a prince. When the husband of Sunuba went to war, he named his wife as guardian. When the warrior prince returned from battle and found out about his wife cheating with Tintoa, he decided to punish them both. The lovers ran away and escaped the law. When Chaquén found out where they were located, he punished them converting them into vegetables; the beautiful Sunuba into a type of cane or reed, condemned to live close to the waters of the various [[swamp]]s of the [[Bogotá savanna]] and Tintoa into a dry weed, growing only in arid areas, separating the two forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://pueblosoriginarios.com/sur/caribe/muisca/chaquen.html Chaquén punishing Tintoa and Sunuba] - Pueblos Originarios&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heritage of Chaquén ===
In Boyacá and other parts of central Colombia the game of [[tejo (sport)|tejo]] survived from Muisca times. The goal of tejo is to throw clay dishes and hit pieces of small explosive, gaining points. This game has been played before the arrival of the Spanish [[conquistador]]es and is still very popular in the villages of the [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]].

Honouring Chaquén a theme park in [[Sumapaz (Bogotá)|Sumapaz]], [[Bogotá]] has been named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.esenazareth.gov.co/ptch.html Parque Temático Chaquén Sumapaz] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426175833/http://www.esenazareth.gov.co/ptch.html |date=2016-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chenjiamman''' or '''Senjiamman''' (aka Gingee Amman) is the guardian deity of [[Gingee]].&lt;ref name=gopalan&gt;{{cite news |first= Madhumita |last= Gopalan|coauthors= |title= Photo essay: The Gingee Fort- one of south India’s most magnificent citadels |date= 19 March 2016 |accessdate=27 March 2017 |url= http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/photo-essay-gingee-fort-one-south-indias-most-magnificent-citadels-40508}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her shrine sits atop the Rajagiri hillock in the [[Gingee Fort]].

==History==
===Early period===
In local legend, Gingee Amman is one of the seven virgin guardian deities of the village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Lester |first= Meera |year= 2011|title= Sacred Travels: 274 Places to Find Joy, Seek Solace, and Learn to Live More Fully |publisher= Adams Media |page= 70 |isbn= 1440524890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=srinivasachari&gt;{{cite book |last= C.S |first= Srinivasachari |year= 1943 |title= History Of Gingee And Its Rulers |url= https://archive.org/stream/historyofgingeea035396mbp/historyofgingeea035396mbp_djvu.txt }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the seven deities is another goddess known as '''Kamalakanni Amman''', who is perhaps identical with Senjiamman herself.&lt;ref name=srinivasachari/&gt;

The Senjiamman shrine is supposedly the oldest one in the Gingee Fort, perhaps even older than the fort.&lt;ref name=srinivasachari/&gt; In local lore, the name Senji for the fort and the town comes from Senjiamman.&lt;ref name=srinivasachari/&gt; It is generally believed that the shrine was developed around 1200 AD when the early structure of Gingee Fort was constructed by Ananda Kon, chief of the local shepherd community.

The small shrine of Senjiamman houses within its precincts a sacrificial altar.&lt;ref name=vilnic&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.viluppuram.nic.in/touristpage.htm |title= District Tourist Places |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= 27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the historian C.S.Srinivasachari wrote his book ''History of the Gingee and Its Rulers'' in 1943, he noted that the goddesses Senjiamman and Kamalakanni Amman were still in worship.&lt;ref&gt;Note1: The worship has ceased to exist today&lt;/ref&gt; An annual festival used to be conducted at the foot of the hill and buffaloes were sacrificed to honor Kamalakanni Amman.&lt;ref name=srinivasachari/&gt; He notes the presence of a stone slab, "''with representations of a bow, five arrows, a buffalo's, a ram's and four human heads which refer to the sacrifices of men and animals that were practiced''".&lt;ref name=srinivasachari/&gt;

===Nayak Period===
There are well-preserved mural paintings dating to the Nayak period in the temple,&lt;ref name=vilnic/&gt; indicating the temple was patronized during the Nayak period. The goddess came to be considered as [[Durga]].&lt;ref name=alf/&gt; The name Senjiamman and Senji supposedly lends their origin from the word ''[[Sanjeevani (plant)|sanjivi]]'', the famous herb, with the name being a combination of two roots, ''"*nn"'' (pleasure) and ''"ji"'' (giving), with the name also traced to Singavaram,&lt;ref&gt;http://temple.dinamalar.com/en/new_en.php?id=747&lt;/ref&gt; a neighboring Vaishnava shrine, whose god is also supposed to be the guardian deity of the place.&lt;ref name=srinivasachari/&gt;

Two Tamil manuscripts in the MacKenzie Collection, shed light on the gingee goddesses and the [[Draupadi]] cult in Gingee. One of the manuscripts was commissioned by a Gingee resident, Narayana Pillai, a [[Konar (caste)|Konar]] himself; whose community supplies priests to the Gingee Draupadi or Melachheri temple. He refers to a myth in which the goddess Draupadi revealed her hair, in which a flower was fastened, to [[Tubaki Krishnappa Nayak|Tubbaki Krishnappa Nayaka]] (1500-1521).&lt;ref name=jch&gt;{{cite book |editors= J.C.

The MacKenzie manuscript states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When Draupadi-amman had revealed herself to the king, the kings of Madurai, Tiruchirappalli, and Thanjavur in their own regions had royal gopurams and walls built for the great temples. So when the Gingee king first paid tribute to the royal residence of the [Vijayanagar] Rayar, the kings came to undertake their rule without cruelty [niṣṭuramillāmal]. (Dikshitar 1952, 25; Diagou 1939, 31) 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In local legend, Draupadi was born in Gingee, Gingee was Draupadi's avatara and Gingee was Hastinapura. [[Alf Hiltebeitel|Hiltebeitel]] notes such transpositions are unknown outside of Gingee with select communities involved, confirms the presence of Draupadi cult at Melaccheri&lt;ref&gt;Note 2: Melaccheri is another name for Gingee; though Melaccheri is located not in Gingee proper but a very short distance away.&lt;/ref&gt; and notes similarity with the [[Ankalamma]] cult in which soil is taken from the Pallava-period Mattilesvara temple or the Draupadi temple itself.&lt;ref name=alf/&gt; Several temples claim to have brought soil / sand or stone from Gingee, even as far away as Cuddalore and Pondicherry. [[Alf Hiltebeitel|Hiltebeitel]] also brings out the link between the Gingee Fort Buffalo sacrifices and the Draupadi festival at Melacheri, with the dates for the fire-walk and the buffalo sacrifice arranged in close proximity even until the time (in 1988) when he wrote his book.&lt;ref name=alf/&gt;

Narayanan Pillai states in his manuscript:&lt;ref name=alf/&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It was to that king [Tubakki Krishnappa] that Draupadi-amman, revealing herself [''piratti(ya)kṣamāy''], showed the hair in the flower that had been fastened to her [icon]. From that day, appointing Raja Gopalan [a Konar] as trustee [of the temple" ''tarmakartta''], building a Dharmaraja-Draupadi temple on the northern boundary of Gingee [''ceñcikku vaṭakku mukaṉaiyil''], and digging a tank, having granted hereditary rights and emoluments [''mirācu''] to that Amman in the kingdom under his rule, establishing [or creating] it as the premier [or original] temple [āti kōvilā uṇṭu panṇị] he made arrangements, as per custom, that respect [mariyātai] in all temples be given to the trustee of that [Dharmaraja-Draupadi] temple. From the Coleroon to Tirupati, emoluments were made to that Amman. A descendant of those trustees, Appacāmi Piḷḷai, is an important pūcāri [''periya pūcāri''] down to today.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The historian van den Hoek notes Draupadi as the goddess of Gingee's northern boundary and Cellattāmmaṉ as the goddess of Madurai's northern boundary are linked to Mahishasuramarshini, the slayer of Mahishasura; with Cellattamman also being a recipient of buffalo sacrifice on the 8th day of her 10-day festival, with the priest for the sacrifice supplied by the Madurai [[Meenakshi Amman Temple]].&lt;ref name=alf/&gt; The Cellattāmmaṉ myth states when [[Ishvara]] and Ishvari (Shiva and his spouse) were walking through a forest, Ishvari became thirsty, killed a buffalo and drank its blood. When Isvara found her decorated with the animal's entrails, he no longer wanted her in his vicinity, but left her with the power to guard the northern boundary with her fierce character. Draupadi and Cellattāmmaṉ are both virgins in the legends. The Konar kings and thereafter the Nayak kings invoked her power of protection.&lt;ref name=alf/&gt;

The legends mention Pothurāja (aka ''Pōttu Rāja, Pōrmaṇṇaṇ, Pōttu Rāja-Pōrmaṇṇaṇ'') [with his Telugu name ''Pōta Rāju''], the king of buffaloes, whose identity has wide recognition in the South Arcot region, and is identical with [[Mahishasura]].&lt;ref name=alf/&gt; The communities of [[Brahmins]], [[Vellalar|Velala Mudaliyar]], [[Vanniyar]], [[Konar (caste)|Konar]] and [[Nattar]] hold the tradition of Potu Raja but there are variants in the story as retold by some communities. In one version, Potu Raja was a learned Brahmin minister in the court of King Cunītaṉ, a grandson of King Janmajeya of Hastinapura, who helps Draupadi kill Rōcakaṇ which is why Potu Raja is installed in every Draupadi temple with the first respects  [mariyātai] to be paid to him.&lt;ref name=alf/&gt; The legend of Pōta Rāju survives in the north coastal areas of Andhra, between Vijaywada and Vishakhapatnam.&lt;ref name=alf/&gt;  In the Gingee legend, King Cunītaṉ does his penance in Gingee but he must go to Kalinga-desa (north coastal Andhra) to find Pōta Rāju.&lt;ref name=alf/&gt;

The legend was possibly a religious affirmation which aided Tubbaki Krishnappa in founding the [[Nayaks of Gingee|Gingee line]] whilst absorbing its Konar founders into their fold.  [[Alf Hiltebeitel|Hiltebeitel]] quotes Edwardes for his summarization of an alleged MacKenzie manuscript in which [[Nayaks of Gingee|Tubbaki Krishnappa Nayaka]] establishes Gingee with the help of a descendant of Ananda-Kon named Tristapitla, who became the Prime Minister of Gingee.&lt;ref name=alf/&gt;&lt;ref name=srinivasachari/&gt;

About 200 yards from the Melacheri temple is the Tī-Pañchaṉ-Kōyil adjacent to which the King Cunītaṉ was cremated. But the [[Sati (practice)|Sati]] who entered the fire was his concubine, a Telugu-speaking Nayudu named Kṣatriya-Maṅkapāy for whom Cunitan left provisions since his wife (the queen) failed to display chastity as implied in performing [[Sati (practice)|Sati]]. In legends which came to be merged, King Cunītaṉ found mention as the founder of the Konar line as is also mentioned in Narayanan Pillai's narration of the Draupadi myth in which she reveals her hair to Tubbaki Krishnappa. However, according to the version stated by Munnacami Naidu from the pāratiyār (praiser, bard) who claimed descent from the story's priest, the king was [[Desingh|Raja-Design]],&lt;ref name=alf/&gt; though this version is not possible as Raja Desingh's wife historically committed sati.&lt;ref name=srinivasachari/&gt;

With the legend of Senjiamman and the Draupadi cult were merged three important characters of Gingee -- first, King  Cunītaṉ with his [[Pandava]] ancestors and his descendants the early Kōn kings (1190 CE - 1260 CE); second, [[Nayaks of Gingee#Krishnappa.27s rule|King Tubbaki Krishnappa]] (1509 - 1521 CE); and third, [[Desingh|Raja Design]] (circa 1714). To rule without cruelty in the stories of Tubbaki Krishnappa was a period of peace and harmony under the Vijayanagar emperor [[Krishnadevaraya|Krishnadeva Raya]], where the three nayaks of [[Thanjavur Nayak kingdom|Tanjavur]], [[Madurai Nayak dynasty|Madurai]] and [[Nayaks of Gingee|Gingee]] supposedly accepted his sovereignty and imperial power without harboring thoughts of independence or rebellion.&lt;ref name=alf/&gt;

The Nayaks added their own shrines to the Gingee Fort as they expanded it. On the top of Rajagiri hill a temple to God Ranganatha was built though the sanctum is now empty. In addition, a mantapam was built in the Vijayanagara style of architecture, along with two big brick granaries, a masonry flagstaff and a strongly built chamber which was perhaps the treasury of the fort.&lt;ref name=srinivasachari/&gt;

'''''De Providentia''''' ("On Providence") is a short [[essay]] in the form of a [[dialogue]] in six brief sections, written by the [[Latin]] [[philosopher]] [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] (died AD 65) in the last years of his life. He chose the dialogue form (as in the well-known [[Plato]]'s works) to deal with the problem of the co-existence of the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] design of providence with the evil in the world.

==Dating and title==
The work cannot be precisely dated, but since it is addressed to [[Lucilius Junior|Lucilius]], who is the addressee of some of Seneca's final works including his ''[[Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium|Letters]]'', and since the essay has similarities to letters 106, 108, and 109
then the work is usually considered a late one dating to around 64 AD.&lt;ref name="smithy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott Smith|first=R.|chapter=De Providentia|title=Brill's Companion to Seneca: Philosopher and Dramatist|pages=115-6|editor1-first=Andreas|editor1-last=Heil|editor2-first=Gregor|editor2-last=Damschen|year=2013|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004217088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The full title of the work is ''Quare bonis viris multa mala accidant, cum sit providentia'' ("Why do misfortunes happen to good men, if providence exists"). This longer title reflects the true theme of the essay which is not so much concerned with [[Divine providence|providence]] but with [[theodicy]] and the question of why bad things happen to good people.&lt;ref name="smithy"/&gt;

==Contents==
The dialogue is opened by [[Lucilius Junior|Lucilius]] complaining with his friend Seneca that adversities and misfortunes can happen to good men too. How can this fit with the goodness connected with the design of providence? Seneca answers according to the Stoic point of view. Nothing actually bad can happen to the good man (the wise man) because opposites don't mix. What looks like adversity is in fact a means by which the man exerts his virtues. As such, he can come out of the ordeal stronger than before.

So, in perfect harmony with the Stoic [[philosophy]], Seneca explains that the truly wise man can never surrender in the face of  misfortunes but as he will always go through them and even if he should fall he will continue fighting on his knees ("''si cecidit de genu pugnat''"). 
The wise man understands [[destiny]] and its design, and therefore he has nothing to fear from the future. Neither does he hope for anything, because he already has everything he needs – his good behaviour.

The conclusion is that actually nothing bad happens to good men. One just has to understand what ''bad'' means: ''bad'' for the wise man would be to have bad thoughts, to commit crimes, to desire money or fame. Whoever behaves wisely already has all the good possible.

==Biography==
Fayga Ostrower was born Fayga Perla Krakowski to a Jewish family at Łódź. In 1921 the family moved to [[Elberfeld]] and [[Barmen]] in Germany, where Ostrower attended primary and secondary schools. In the early 1930s, following difficulties with the German authorities, the family sought refuge in Belgium, and emigrated to Brazil in 1934, where they took up residence in [[Nilópolis]]. Ostrower began work as a secretary while studying art at the Fine Arts Association, and in 1946 attended design classes at the [[Fundação Getúlio Vargas|Getúlio Vargas Foundation]]’s Brazilian Society of Fine and Graphic Arts, where she studied  [[Engraving|metal]] and [[Woodcut|wood engraving]], and [[art history]], with tutors Axel Leskoschek, Tomás Santa Rosa, Carlos Oswald and Anna Levy. In 1955 she spent a year in New York through a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Scholarship]], engraving under the tutelage of [[Stanley Hayter]].&lt;ref name=JWE/&gt;&lt;ref name=Biog/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dialogos&gt;Nairn, Olivia (31 January 2012); [http://www.creaturesofculture.com/2012/01/brazil-focus-part-ii-fayga-ostrower-e.html Brazil Focus Part II: Fayga Ostrower e Alex Gama: Díalogos], Creatures of Culture. Retrieved 9 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Ostrower exhibited and won prizes in the international Art Biennials of [[São Paulo Art Biennial|São Paulo]] (1951 to 1967), [[Venice Biennale|Venice]] (1958 and 1962) and Mexico (1960).&lt;ref name=JWE/&gt;&lt;ref name=Biog/&gt;

In 2002 the Fayga Ostrower Institute was founded in Rio de Janeiro in memory of Ostrower, to house her works and documents, and to provide for creative, fine art and [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] study.

In 1941 Ostrower married [[Marxism|marxist]] [[Activism|activist]] Heinz Ostrower, both becoming [[Naturalization|naturalized]] in 1951. They had a son Carl Robert (b. 1949), and daughter Anna Leonor (b. 1952).&lt;ref name=JWE/&gt;&lt;ref name=Biog/&gt;

==Teaching==
Between 1954 and 1970 Ostrower lectured in Composition and [[Critical thinking|Critical Analysis]] at the [[Museum of Modern Art, Rio de Janeiro]]. In the 1960s she taught at the [[Slade School of Fine Art]], London, and in 1964 at [[Spelman College]], [[Atlanta]]. Subsequently, she held posts within [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] programmes within various Brazilian universities.  Consecutively she developed art courses for workers and community centres, and gave lectures at various cultural institutions.&lt;ref name=JWE/&gt;&lt;ref name=Biog/&gt;

'''Ancient Hindu wars''' are the [[battle]]s described in the [[Hindu texts]] of ancient [[India]]. These battles depict great [[hero]]es, [[demon]]s, celestial weapons and beings, and the [[supernatural]].

While no Hindu epic or scripture fails to describe the horrors of war and its fallout, major wars are fought with the purpose of upholding the ''[[Dharma]]'' (righteousness that brings [[prosperity]] to [[human]]ity) over ''[[Adharma]]'' (wickedness that causes humanity to suffer). The purpose of the wars is often to eliminate demonic beings or lords and rulers who pursue war want only for [[:wikt:ambition|ambition]] (wicked wishes) and domination (for worldly pleasures). Hindu teachings prescribe war as the final option, to be employed only after all peaceful methods are exhausted. But when this time comes, war is taught to be a matter of great personal and social importance, where every man who belongs to the warrior caste must do his duty, exemplifying courage, [[honor]], and fearsome prowess against all odds and even at the cost of his life.

The major Hindu gods, including [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Shiva]], often engage in war, either in the form of [[Avatars]] or in their true form. They and many Hindu heroes use ''[[Astra (weapon)|astra]]'' – celestial weapons with fearsome supernatural power – to aid them in battle.

==In Vedic literature==

===Indra and Vrtra===

The central battle in the ''Vedas'' is between [[Indra]] and Vrtra, and the defeat of the demon Vrtra leads to the liberation of rivers, cattle and [[Ushas]] ([[dawn]]/light). While this battle does reinforce the timeless good v/s evil theme, close examination of various hymns and verses in the Rig Veda suggest this might have been an allegorical account of the end of the last ice age in the Himalayan glacial system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rigvedaanalysis.wordpress.com/2014/04/19/vrtra-myth-the-bharadvaja-version/ A record of the end of the last ice age in the Himalayan glacial system?]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important battle is the historic [[Battle of the Ten Kings]], alluded to in the [[Rigveda]], in which the [[Tritsu]] clan, led by [[Sudas]], defeat the [[Puru (Vedic tribe)|Puru]] confederation of ten [[Indo Aryan]] clans.&lt;ref name="schmidt1980"&gt;Schmidt, H.P. ''Notes on Rgveda 7.18.5-10''. Indica. Organ of the Heras Institute, Bombay. Vol.17, 1980, 41-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Devas and Asuras===

The perennial battle between the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] and [[Asura]]s is undertaken over the dominion of the three worlds: [[Svarga]], [[Bhūmi|Bhumi]] and [[Patala]], or [[Heaven]], [[Earth]] and the Nether worlds. Both races are technically equal, possessors of great religious and martial powers, but the Devas are committed to the worship of the [[Supreme Being]] and the practice of [[virtue]]. The Asuras have atheistic and devious tendencies that grow over time. The divide is the greatest in the [[Kali Yuga]], the final age.&lt;ref name="Yukteswar"&gt;[[The Holy Science]], by Jnanavatar Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri, Yogoda Sat-Sanga Society of India, 1949&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Shukra]]: the [[Preceptor]] of the [[Asura]]s, their [[high priest]] and guru, worshiper of the Supreme Lord, but remains supportive of the Asuras.&lt;ref&gt;Subramaniam, Kamala (2007). "Adi Parva". The ''Mahabharata''. Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan [[India]]. {{ISBN|81-7276-405-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Bṛhaspati|Brhaspati]]:&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, Charles. ''Mythology of the Hindus'', p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Preceptor]] (Guru)  of the Devas. Possessing unparalleled knowledge of the ''[[Vedas]]'', scripture, religion and mysticism, Bṛhaspati's mastery of the military arts is akin to [[Shukra]], his counterpart.
He is also known as Guru Brihaspati. 
*[[Indra]]: the God of thunder and [[lightning]], [[King of Heaven]], the leader of all the Devas against the demons. The greatest performer of [[sacrifice]]s, Indra is the most famous and fearsome warrior in the three worlds. When facing opponents like [[Vritra]], Indra seeks the aid of [[Vishnu]].
*[[Kartikeya]]: army commander of Devas. He is also god of war and victory. He is the son of Lord [[Shiva]] and Goddess [[Parvati]].&lt;ref&gt;Chandra, Suresh. (1998). ''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mfTE6kpz6XEC Encyclopaedia of Hindu gods and goddesses]''. pp.&amp;nbsp;173–175.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Kshatriya order ===

{{Main|Kshatriya}}
'''War Sacrifices:'''

*''[[Ashvamedha]]'': The famous horse-sacrifice was conducted by allowing a [[horse]] to roam freely for a slated period of time, with the king performing the sacrifice laying claim to all the lands it touched. The king whose authority is contested must prove himself in battle or accept the imperial supremacy of the challenging king. When the horse returns safely after the period of time, the main sacrifice is performed, and the king, if successful in obtaining dominance over other kings, is crowned ''Emperor of the World''. The ''Ashwamedha'' allows the opportunity to maintain peace if the kings do not choose to contest the sacrificial horse. In Mahabharat era, [[Arjuna]] alone had conquered whole world for the sake of Ashvamwdha yagya of his brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m14/m14085.htm|title=Digivijaya of Arjuna|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Rajasuya]]'': Considered the ultimate sacrifice, the king performing the sacrifice must openly challenge every king in the world to accept his supremacy or defeat him in battle. If and when the king returns successfully, having beaten all other known rulers, the performance of the sacrifice will send him to the abode of Lord [[Indra]]. It was performed by the Pandava hero [[Yudhishthira]] in the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' epic. Arjuna had conquered many kingdom for the sake of Yudhisthira's Rajasuya.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m02/m02029.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 2: Sabha Parva: Jarasandhta-badha Parva: Section XXIX|website=www.sacred-texts.com|access-date=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Rama]]: the Seventh [[Avatar]] of Vishnu, a great warrior-[[tapasvin]]. Rama single-handedly slays the 14,000 demon hordes of [[Khara (Ramayana)|Khara]] (in one hour, according to the ''Ramayana''), the demons [[Maricha]] and [[Subahu]], Ravana's chief commander [[Prahasta]] and is responsible for the ultimate killing of [[Ravana]] himself.
*[[Lakshmana]] is as powerful and an excellent warrior as his brother, and slayed extremely powerful demons, including [[Atikaya]] and [[Indrajit]].
*[[Hanuman]]: the [[Vanara]] minister of [[Sugriva]] is the greatest devotee of [[Rama]], famous for his unerring service, absolute loyalty and great feats of courage. Hanuman is responsible for killing many demons, as well as burning the city of Lanka. His strength is given by his father [[Vayu]], and by virtue of the boons bestowed on him by various Gods, he could increase his size and strength beyond any limit he desired.
*[[Ravana]]: blessed by his fearsome 10,000 year [[tapasya]] to be the most powerful being on earth, invulnerable to every God, demon and living being, save man.

Master of mystical warfare and celestial weapons, and blessed by boons from Gods, Indrajit was considered the most fearful and knowledgeable warrior, virtually invincible. He was said to be invincible in battle because of a Yajna he used to perform before every battle.At a very young age, Meghnada became the possessor of several supreme celestial weapons, including Brahmandastra, Pashupatastra and Vaishnavastra, under the guidance of Shukra, the guru of the daityas (demons).During the Devasura Sangram (the battle between the devas and the asuras) he defeated Indra, tying him up and mounting him onto his celestial chariot.At this juncture, Brahma intervened and asked him to free Indra. Meghanada obliged, and was granted a chance to ask for a boon from Brahma. Meghanada asked for immortality, but Brahma remarked that absolute immortality is against the law of nature. Instead, he was then granted another boon: he would never be won over in any battle, until his Yagna (fire-worship) of his native goddess Nikumbala was disturbed and destroyed. On the completion of the Yagna, a supreme celestial chariot would appear, boarding which, Indrajit would become invincible in any battle. But Brahma also cautioned him that whosoever would destroy this yagna would also kill him. It was Brahma who gave him the name Indrajit ("the conqueror of Indra"). He was finally killed by Lakshmana employed deceit to kill him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Indrajit]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Kumbhakarna]]: the gigantic brother of Ravana is a fearsome monster-demon who sleeps for six months at a stretch, rising for only one day and then returning to his slumber.

*[[Prahasta]]: the chief commander of Lanka's army who was killed on the 1st day of the war of Rama and Ravana.*[[Atikaya]]: the second son of Ravana, who had an indestructible armor given to him by [[Brahma]] that can only be pierce by the Brahmastra. Once he caught Lord [[Shiva]] trident in Mount Kailash when the Lord was angry at him. Both Atikaya and his cousin [[Trishira]] were the reincarnations of [[Madhu and Kaitabha]], who were defeated by [[Mahavishnu]].
*[[Akshayakumara]]: the youngest son of Ravana who died, fighting Hanuman in Ashoka Vatika, who later set Lanka on fire.

==Major Deities==

===Shakti===
{{Main|Devi}}
Shakti is the Supreme God in Shaktism Sect of Hinduism. Both a Supreme Being and an energy that is considered to be the source of all works of creation, preservation and destruction, [[Adi Parashakti]] is the mother of [[Trimurti]], the [[universe]] and all of [[:wikt:creaton|creation]]. She took many incarnations to fight with demons, including [[Parvati]], wife of Shiva,&lt;ref&gt;Wilkins pp.240-1&lt;/ref&gt; the complete avatar of Shakti herself, according to the [[Devi-Bhagavata Purana|Devi Gita]] and Durga Saptashati, the main scriptures for Shakti worshipers. As the goddess Parvati, she is considered to be the most powerful of all deities.&lt;ref name="shaktisadhana.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shaktisadhana.org  |accessdate=March 23, 2015 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, the gods worship [[Parvati]], who came before them in different ''avatars'':
* [[Durga]], who killed the demon [[Durgamasur]]
* [[Kali]], the most ferocious Form of the Goddess, who can not be pacified by anyone after war. No one can stop her because she is the only deity who is omnipotent, free from all rules and regulations.
* [[Chandi]], the gentle manifestation of Durga or Kali, Goddess Lakshmi, [[Saraswati]], who killed Mahishasura in the Battle of Alkapuri.

* [[Minakshi]], who defeated all the demigods and destroyed the arrogance of all demi-gods.

Apart from Parvati, there are some demons who were killed by Laksmi's incarnation. One example is Muru.&lt;ref name="shaktisadhana.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chandi Purana, Tantra Chuda Mani&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakti is usually depicted as having the weapons of all the gods, even the [[Trimurti]]. She holds the trident of Shiva, the ''Chakra'' of Vishnu, the ''Vajra'' of Indra, the ''Gada'' of Yamaraaj. It indicates that she is the one who actually having all kinds of powers. It is she from whom strength arose.

Shiva employs his power to kill the [[Asura]] Tripura, destroying the flying three cities of Tripura.
In battle, Shiva and his Avatars deploy formidable weapons controlled by him. Some of these are:

*''[[Chandrahas]]'': Sword of [[Ravana]] granted by Maha [[Shiva]] as a boon.
*''Ekasha Gada'': The mace of Lord [[Shiva]]. A blow from the weapon is the equivalent of being hit by a million elephants.

*''[[Trishul (weapon)|Trishula]]'' (Trident): The trident of [[Shiva]]
*Third eye : The third eye situated in the center of the forehead of lord Shiva (also the point where the three nadis – Ida, pingala and suhasmana meet – pituitary gland) is the most destructive weapon/power in the entire universe. It is proved to destruct kaala (time) hence ending all the creation. Once opened for a purpose, its immense energy is so intense that it can burn down the entire universe into ashes. No other weapon can match its powers.

===Vishnu===
{{Main|Avatar#Avatars of Krishna|Dashavatara}}
[[Vishnu]], the Inconceivable Supreme, is the Supreme God in Vaishnavism sect of [[Hinduism]]. "Vishnu" means "all pervading" supreme being, the source of everything. In the [[Vishnu Sahasranama]] he is called Paramatman or Parameshwara(the highest form of God), and is periodically reborn as an [[Avatar]] upon earth in order to destroy evil and bring deliverance to the pious. He is also the refuge of the Devas in their battles against Asuras. The most martial Avatars include [[Matsya]], [[Kurma]], [[Varaha]], [[Narasimha]], [[Mohini]], [[Vamana]], [[Parshurama]], [[Rama]], [[Krishna]], [[Kalki]]. He is also considered to be the first God, 'Adideva'. He is beyond birth, death, time. He is Beyond all. 
In battle, the Avatars of Vishnu are aided by a variety of ''[[Astra (weapon)|astra]]'' or celestial weapons. His two human avatars, Parashuram and Rama were fearsome warriors and possessed many celestial weapons that accompany the past times of Vishnu. Sri Krishna also used a few of these weapons in Mahabharata. These include:

*''[[Kaumodaki]]'': The divine [[Gada (mace)|mace]] weapon of Vishnu; invincible and without parallel, Lord Krishna slayed demon Dantavakra with it.
*''Kodandam'': The bow of [[Rama]], 7th avatar of [[Vishnu]].

*''[[Narayanastra]]'': Narayanastra is the most powerful astra in the universe along with the Vaishnavastra. The personal missile weapon of Vishnu in his [[Narayana]] (Naraina) form, this ''astra'' lets loose a powerful tirade of millions of deadly missiles simultaneously. The intensity of the shower increases with resistance. The only solution is total submission before the missile; only then will it cease. The Narayanastra was first used by Lord Rama in the ''Ramayana''. Then, thousands of years later, this astra was again used by [[Ashwatthama]] in the [[Kurukshetra War]] against the [[Pandava]] army.
*''[[Parashu]]'': The axe of [[Parashurama]], 6th Avatar of [[Vishnu]], given by [[Shiva]].
*''[[Sharanga (Hindu mythology)|Sharanga]]'': The Celestial bow of Vishnu
*''Sharkha'': The bow of [[Krishna]], 8th avatar of [[Vishnu]].
*''[[Sudarshana Chakra]]'': The magical ''Chakra'', a spinning disc with sharp outer spears. It is the most powerful Shastra in the universe, and without any parallel. The Chakra was famously designed by Vishwakarma for Lord Vishnu. The Sudarshan flies at the command of Krishna, spinning away to tear off the heads of His opponents, or to perform any function desired by Vishnu. It was most famously used by His Avatar [[Krishna]] in the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.
*''[[Vaishnavastra]]'': Vaishnavastra is the most powerful astra in the universe along with the Narayanastra. The personal missile weapon of [[Krishna]], once fired it cannot be thwarted by any means, save by the will of [[Vishnu]] Himself. 
[[File:Shiva as the Lord of Dance LACMA.jpg|thumb|250px|11th-century statue of Shiva performing the dance of destruction.]]

==Celestial Weapons==
An ''[[Astra (weapon)|astra]]'' is a weapon that is to be hurled at an enemy. Examples include arrows from bows. A ''[[shastra]]'' is a personal weapon, like swords and maces, that must be constantly operated by the warrior.

*''[[Brahmastra]]'': Embedded with the mystical force of [[Brahma]], this weapon releases millions of missiles, great fires and a destructive potential capable of extinguishing all creation, if not used by and aimed only at a celestial fighter. Modern speculation has equated its destructive nature to be similar to that of a [[nuclear weapon]], it has been used multiple times in Ramayana, Indrajit used it against hanuman, Lakshmana asked permission to use it against Indrajit, which Lord Rama declined, Lakshmana used it to kill Atikaya, Lord Rama used it as final arrow to kill Ravana. In the epic Mahabharata, it is said that the weapon manifest with the single head of Lord Brahma as its tip. In Mahabharata era Parasurama, Bhishma, Drona, Karna, Kripa, Ashwatthama, Arjuna, Yudhishtir and several [[Maharathi (warrior)|Maharathi]]'s possessed the knowledge to invoke this weapon.
*''[[Brahmashirsha astra]]'': A weapon capable of greater destruction than the ''Brahmastra''. It can burn all creation to ashes once discharged, Arjuna and Ashwatthama both used it against each other after the Mahabharata war.Capable of killing even heavens. Was used by Ashwatthama on Parikshit. It is thought that the Brahmashirsha is the evolution of the Brahmastra, 4 times stronger than Brahmastra.Its similar to modern day hydrogen bomb or thermonuclear (fusion) bomb.In the epic Mahabharata, it is said that the weapon manifest with the four heads of Lord Brahma as its tip.In Mahabharata era sage Agnivesha, Drona, Ashwatthama, Arjuna possessed the knowledge to invoke this weapon.
*''[[Brahmanda astra]]'': This is the most powerful weapon of Lord Brahma. It was first used by sage Vashishtha against vishwamitra's (who was King Vishwarath at that time) Brahmashirsha, as only Brahmanda astra can stop Brahmashirsha astra, it was also used by sage Piplad against [[Shani]] to avenge his father's death.In the epic Mahabharata, it is said that the weapon manifest with the all five heads of Lord Brahma as its tip.Brahma earlier lost his fifth head when he fought with Lord Siva.This weapon is said to possess the power to destroy entire solar system or brahmand, the 14 realms according to Hindu cosmology. In Mahabharata era no one possessed the knowledge to invoke this weapon. In some texts it is called Brahma-dhanda astra, the weapon created by [[Saptarishi]]'s to counter any weapon ever created, even that of [[Trimurti]]'s. The rishi of this weapon is [[Para Brahman]]. It is said to be the most difficult astra to obtain. Capable of destroying entire multiverse in a blink of an eye. [[Vishvamitra]] used all kinds of divine weapons against sage [[Vashistha]], even [[Pashupatastra]], but the Brahma-dhanda astra of [[Vashistha]] neutralized and swallowed all [[astra (weapon)]] of Vishwamitra proving that Brahma-dhanda astra is the most powerful of all astras.&lt;ref name="Bala Khanda Sarga 56"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.indiadivine.org/content/topic/1093926-bala-kanda-sarga-56/ | title=Brahmadhanda astra | accessdate=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*''[[Pashupatastra]]'': It is believed in Hinduism that Pashupatastra is most devastating weapons, as it is the weapon of the consort of the Godhead Mahadeva, i.e. Mahakali. Mahadeva literally means "Highest of all gods" and Mahakali means "Goddess who is beyond time". This weapon, granted to Arjuna by Shiva, is one of the most destructive and foreboding weapon in ''Mahabharata'' it was first used by lord Shiva for the destruction of tripura, also acc. To Ramayana, Indrajit used it against Lakshmana, lord Shiva also granted this astra to Arjuna. In Mahabharat era, Apart from Arjuna no one knew this weapon.
*''[[Narayanastra]]'': Invincible and painful, this ''astra'' is unconquerable except by total submission, this astra was used by Lord Krishna against lord Shiva, when lord Lord Shiva was fighting on behalf of the evil Banasura, when lord shiva charged his personal Pashupatastra on Lord Krishna, he vanquished it with his personal Narayanastra, In Mahabharata ashwathama used it against Pandava army to avenge his father's death.
*''[[Vaishnavastra]] '' : One of the most powerful astras, this cannot be stopped by anyone except its creator, [[Vishnu]]. Only [[Rama]], [[Krishna]] &amp; [[Arjuna]] possessed this weapon. 
*''[[Nagastra]]'': The snake weapon used by Indrajit against Rama and Lakshmana, used by [[Karna]] against [Arjuna].

*''[[Garudastra]]'':The eagle weapon to counter against the Nagastra.
*''[[Anjalikastra]]'': The personal weapon of Lord [[Indra]]. This is the astra used by [[Arjuna]] to slay [[Karna]] in the Mahabharata war.

The three potential astras are Vaishnavastra, Pashupatastra and Brahmanda astra. However, these astras cannot harm four principle gods i.e. [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], [[Shiva]], and [[Devi]] as they are the supreme manifestation of the divine. Especially, these astras cannot harm Vishnu, the greatest of all gods, Shiva, the god of gods and the destroyer himself, and Shakti, the original energy behind all astras. With these five gods, the astras also can not harm [[Hanuman]], the son of god [[vayu]], as he obtained vardanas (boons) from several gods.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8623">'''Hong Meng''', '''Hung Meng''', or '''Hung Mung''' ({{zh|s=鸿蒙|t=鴻蒙|p=Hóng Méng|w=Hung Meng}}) is a character in the [[Daoist]] text ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' and a metaphor for the "primordial world, primeval chaos" in [[Chinese creation myth]]s. Like many Zhuangist names, Hong Meng is a [[word play]], translated as "Mists-of-Chaos", "Vast Obscurity", "Big Concealment", "Vital Principle", and "Natural Energy".

==Name==
[[image:iching-hexagram-04.svg|right|''Hong'', [[Yijing]]'' hexagram 4]]
Hong Meng compounds ''hong'' [[Wikt:鴻|鴻]] "wild goose, swan; vast, great" and ''meng'' [[Wikt:蒙|蒙]] "covered; ignorant (esp. in childhood), untutored; encounter, receive; (''[[Yijing]]'') [[I Ching hexagram 04#Hexagram 4|Hexagram 4]]". The (ca. 111 CE) ''[[Hanshu]]'' biography of the Daoist author [[Yang Xiong (author)|Yang Xiong]] writes Hong Meng as 鴻濛, with the [[variant Chinese character]] ''meng'' [[Wikt:濛|濛]] "mist, drizzling rain" (sharing the 氵 "water [[Radical (Chinese character)|radical]] in ''hong'' 鴻). In [[Modern Standard Chinese]] usage, ''hongmeng'' 鴻蒙 is a literary [[metonym]] meaning "primordial world; primeval atmosphere of nature" before [[Pangu]] created the world.

==Zhuangzi==
Hong Meng first appears in the (ca. 3rd century BCE) "Outer Chapters" of ''Zhuangzi'' (chapter 11, Zài Yòu 在宥) paired with Yun Jiang ({{zh|s=云将|t=雲將|p=Yún Jiàng|w=Yün Chiang}}). This character name combines ''yun'' [[Wikt: 雲|雲]] "cloud, clouds" and ''[[Jiang (rank)|jiang]]'' [[Wikt:將|將]] "military commander, general officer; (Chinese chess) [[Chinese_chess#General|general]] corresponding to (chess) [[King (chess)|king]]". English translators of the ''Zhuangzi'' have rendered Yun Jiang and Hong Meng as:  
*[[Frederic H. Balfour]] (1881:127) Spirit of the Clouds, Mists-of-Chaos
*[[James Legge]] (1891:300) Yün Kiang, Hung Mung 
*[[Herbert Giles]] (1926:129) Spirit of the Clouds, Vital Principle
*[[Burton Watson]] (1968:120) Cloud Chief, Big Concealment 
*[[Victor H. Mair]] (1994:97) Cloud General, Vast Obscurity
*[[Sam Hamill]] and [[Jerome P. Seaton]] (1998:76) Cloud General, Big Goose Dummy
*Wang Rongpei (1999:163) General Cloud, Natural Energy 

Yun Jiang meets Hong Meng twice in three years, both times when wandering or traveling eastward. First, Yun Jiang was passing the ''fuyao zhi zhi'' 扶搖之枝 "branch(es) of a whirlwind". Watson (1968:121) notes ''fuyao'' 扶搖 "whirlwind; typhoon" appears in ''Zhuangzi'' chapter 1, but suggests this context is an error for ''[[fusang]]'' 扶桑 "a huge mythical tree in the eastern sea from whose branches the sun rises." Both interpretations are possible, compare "an offshoot of a whirlwind" (tr. Mair 1994:97) and "the branches of the sacred wood" (tr. Wang 1999:163). Second, they meet when Yun Jiang was passing the ''Song zhi ye'' 宋之野 "wilds of [[Song (state)|Song]]" (present day [[Henan]]), and respectfully addresses Hong Meng as ''[[tian]]'' 天 "heaven; heavenly master".

&lt;blockquote&gt;Cloud Chief was traveling east and had passed the branches of the Fu-yao when he suddenly came upon Big Concealment. Big Concealment at the moment was amusing himself by slapping his thighs and hopping around like a sparrow. When Cloud Chief saw this, he stopped in bewilderment, stood dead still in his tracks, and said, "Old gentleman, who are you? What is this you're doing?"

Big Concealment, without interrupting his thigh-slapping and sparrow-hopping, replied to Cloud Chief, "Amusing myself."

"I would like to ask a question," said Cloud Chief.

"Oh dear!" said Big Concealment, for the first time raising his head and looking at Cloud Chief.

"The breath of heaven is out of harmony, the breath of earth tangles and snarls," said Cloud Chief. "The six breaths do not blend properly," the four seasons do not stay in order. Now I would like to harmonize the essences of the six breaths in order to bring nourishment to all living creatures. How should I go about it?"

Big Concealment, still thigh-slapping and sparrow-hopping, shook his head. "I have no idea! I have no idea!" 

So Cloud Chief got no answer. Three years later he was again traveling east and, as he passed the fields of Sung, happened upon Big Concealment once more. Cloud Chief, overjoyed, dashed forward and presented himself, saying, "Heavenly Master, have you forgotten me? Have you forgotten me?" Then he bowed his head twice and begged for some instruction from Big Concealment.

Big Concealment said, "Aimless wandering does not know what it seeks; demented drifting does not know where it goes. A wanderer, idle, unbound, I view the sights of Undeception. What more do I know?"

Cloud Chief said, "I too consider myself a demented drifter, but the people follow me wherever I go and I have no choice but to think of them. It is for their sake now that I beg one word of instruction!"

Big Concealment said, "If you confuse the constant strands of Heaven and violate the true form of things, then Dark Heaven will reach no fulfillment. Instead, the beasts will scatter from their herds, the birds will cry all night, disaster will come to the grass and trees, misfortune will reach even to the insects. Ah, this is the fault of men who 'govern'!"

"Then what should I do?" said Cloud Chief.

"Ah," said Big Concealment, "you are too far gone! Up, up, stir yourself and be off!"

Cloud Chief said, "Heavenly Master, it has been hard indeed for me to meet with you – I beg one word of instruction!"

"Well, then – mind-nourishment!" said Big Concealment. "You have only to rest in inaction and things will transform themselves. Smash your form and body, spit out hearing and eyesight, forget you are a thing among other things, and you may join in great unity with the deep and boundless. Undo the mind, slough off spirit, be blank and soulless, and the ten thousand things one by one will return to the root – return to the root and not know why. Dark and undifferentiated chaos – to the end of life none will depart from it. But if you try to know it, you have already departed from it. Do not ask what its name is, do not try to observe its form. Things will live naturally and of themselves."

Cloud Chief said, "The Heavenly Master has favored me with this Virtue, instructed me in this Silence. All my life I have been looking for it, and now at last I have it!" He bowed his head twice, stood up, took his leave, and went away. (tr. Watson 1968:120-123) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Watson (1968:120) notes that Hong Meng apparently represents "the Taoist Sage".

==Huainanzi==
The (2nd century BCE) ''[[Huainanzi]]'' uses Hong Heng twice, translated as "primal chaos" and "Profound Mist", and both contexts echo the ''Zhuangzi''. The "Activating the Genuine" (''Chuzhen'' 俶真訓)  chapter says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;In an age of Utmost Potency, [people] contentedly slept in boundless realms and moved [between] and lodged in indeterminate dwellings. They clasped Heaven and Earth and discarded the myriad things. They took primal chaos as their gnomon and floated freely in a limitless domain. (2, tr. Major et al. 2010:99) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
And "Responses of the Way" (''Daoying'' 道應訓) says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;One such as I – to the south, I wander to the wilderness of [[Wangliang]] [Penumbra]; to the north, I rest in the countryside of Chenmu [Sunken Tomb]; to the west, I go as far as the hamlet of Yaoming [Deep Obscurity]; to the east, I close myself up within Hongmeng [Profound Mist]. In such places, no Earth lies below; no Heaven spreads above. You listen but do not hear; you look but do not see. (12, tr. Major et al. 2010:471) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Hybrid beasts''' appear in the [[folklore]] of a variety of cultures as [[legendary creature]]s.

==In burial sites==
Remains similar to those of mythological hybrids have been found in burial sites discovered by archaeologists. Known combinations include horse-cows, sheep-cows, and a six-legged sheep. The skeletons were formed by ancient peoples who joined together body parts from animal carcasses of different species. The practice is believed to have been done as an offering to their gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/science/weird-science/weird-horse-cows-6-legged-sheep-found-iron-age-burials-n395871|title=Horse-Cows? Bizarre 'Hybrid' Animals Found in Ancient Burials|publisher=LiveScience|author=Laura Geggel|date=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
These forms' [[Motif (narrative)|motif]]s appear across cultures in many [[mythologies]] around the world.

Such hybrids can be classified as partly human hybrids (such as [[mermaid]]s or [[centaur]]s) or non-human hybrids combining two or more non-human animal species (such as the [[griffin]] or the [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]]). Hybrids often originate as [[zoomorphic]] deities who, over time, are given an [[anthropomorphic]] aspect.

===Paleolithic===
Partly human hybrids appear in [[petroglyph]]s or [[cave painting]]s from the [[Upper Paleolithic]], in [[shamanism|shamanistic]] or [[totemism|totemistic]] contexts. Ethnologist Ivar Lissner theorized that [[cave paintings]] of beings combining human and animal features were not physical representations of mythical hybrids, but were instead attempts to depict [[shaman]]s in the process of acquiring the mental and spiritual attributes of various beasts or [[power animal]]s.&lt;ref name="Steiger 1999"&gt;{{cite book| last=Steiger| first= B.| year=1999| title=The Werewolf Book: The Encyclopedia of Shape-Shifting Beings| location=Farmington Hills, MI| publisher=Visible Ink| isbn=1-57859-078-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious historian [[Mircea Eliade]] has observed that beliefs regarding animal identity and [[shapeshifting|transformation into animals]] are widespread.&lt;ref name=Eliade&gt;{{cite book | last=Eliade | first=Mircea | title=Rites and Symbols of Initiation: the mysteries of birth and rebirth | publisher=Harper &amp; Row | year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iconography of the [[Vinca culture]] of [[Neolithic Europe]] in particular is noted for its frequent depiction of an owl-beaked "[[bird goddess]]".&lt;ref&gt;a term of [[Marija Gimbutas]]', see e.g. ''The language of the goddess: unearthing the hidden symbols of western civilization'' San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row; London: Thames and Hudson (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Egypt===
[[File:Seth + Horus = 2 terres.jpg|thumb|The falcon-headed Horus and crane-headed Seth.]]
Examples of humans with animal heads ([[theriocephaly]]) in the [[ancient Egyptian pantheon]] include jackal-headed [[Anubis]], cobra-headed [[Amunet]], lion-headed [[Sekhmet]], falcon-headed [[Horus]], etc. Most of these deities also have a purely zoomorphic and a purely anthropomorphic aspect, with the hybrid representation seeking to capture aspects of both of which at once. Similarly, the [[Gaul]]ish ''[[Artio]]'' sculpture found in [[Berne]] shows a juxtaposition of a bear and a woman figure, interpreted as representations of the theriomorphic and the anthropomorphic aspect of the same goddess.

Non-human hybrids also appear in ancient Egyptian iconography as in [[Ammit]] (combining the [[crocodile]], the [[lion]], and the [[hippopotamus]]).

===Ancient Middle East===
Mythological hybrids became very popular in [[Luwian]] and [[Neo-Assyrian|Assyrian]] art of the [[Late Bronze Age]] to [[Early Iron Age]]. The angel (human with birds' wings, see [[winged genie]]) the mermaid (part human part fish, see [[Enki]], [[Atargatis]], [[Apkallu]]) and the [[Shedu]] all trace their origins to Assyro-Babylonian art. In [[Mesopotamian mythology]] the ''urmahlullu'', or lion-man served as a guardian spirit, especially of bathrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Black, Jeremy A. and Anthony Green |title=Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=1992 |isbn=0-292-70794-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wiggermann |first=F. A. M. |title=Mesopotamian Protective Spirits: The Ritual Texts |publisher=Styx |year=1992 |isbn = 90-72371-52-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Old Babylonian [[Lilitu]] demon, particularly as shown in the [[Burney Relief]] (part-woman, part-owl) prefigures the [[harpy]]/[[Siren (mythology)|siren]] [[Motif (narrative)|motif]].

===Mediterranean===
[[File:Zeus Typhon Staatliche Antikensammlungen 596.jpg|thumb|[[Zeus]] darting his lightning at [[Typhon]], shown as a hybrid with a human torso, bird's wings and a reptilian lower body (Chalcidian black-figured [[hydria]], c. 550 BC, [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]] Inv. 596).]]

In [[Archaic Greece]], Luwian and Assyrian motifs were imitated, during the [[Orientalizing Period]] (9th to 8th centuries BC), inspiring the monsters of the [[Greek mythology|mythology]] of the [[Classical Greek period]], such as the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]], the [[Harpy]], the [[Centaur]], the [[Griffin]], the [[Hippocampus (mythology)|Hippocampus]], [[Talos]], [[Pegasus]], etc.

The motif of the winged man appears in the Assyrian [[winged genie]], and is taken up in the Biblical [[Seraphim]] and [[Chayot]], the Etruscan [[Vanth]], Hellenistic [[Eros]]-[[Cupid|Amor]], and ultimately the Christian iconography of [[angel]]s.

The motif of otherwise human figures sporting [[Horn (anatomy)|horn]]s may derive from partly [[goat]] hybrids (as in [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] and the [[Devil]] in Christian iconography) or as partly [[Bull (mythology)|bull]] hybrids ([[Minotaur]]). The [[Gundestrup cauldron]] and the [[Pashupati]] figure have [[stag]]'s [[antlers]] (see also [[Horned God]], [[horned helmet]]). The Christian representation of [[Moses]] with horns, however, is due to a mistranslation of the Hebrew text of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 34:29–35 by [[Jerome]].

===Hinduism===
[[File:Ganesh mimarjanam EDITED.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Street festivities in [[Hyderabad, India]], during the festival of [[Ganesha Chaturthi]].]]
The most prominent hybrid in [[Hinduism|Hindu]] iconography is [[elephant]]-headed [[Ganesha]], god of wisdom, knowledge and new beginnings.

Both [[Nāga]] and [[Garuda]] are non-hybrid mythical animals ([[snake]] and [[bird]], respectively) in their early attestations, but become partly human hybrids in later iconography.

The [[Hindu deities|god]] [[Vishnu]] is believed to have taken his first four [[incarnation]]s in human-animal form, namely: [[Matsya]] ([[human]] form with [[fish]]'s body below waist), [[Kurma]] (human form with [[turtle]]'s body below waist), [[Varaha]] (human form with a [[boar]]'s head), [[Narasimha]] (human form with [[lion]]'s head).

[[Kamadhenu]], the [[mythical]] cow which is considered to be the mother of all other [[cattle]] is often portrayed as a cow with human head, [[peacock]] tail and bird wings.

'''Jehovah's Witnesses Association of Romania''' ({{lang-ro|Organizația Religioasă "Martorii lui Iehova" din România}}) is the formal name used by [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] for their operations in [[Romania]], with a branch office located in [[Bucharest]]. It is one of eighteen officially recognised religious denominations in the country.&lt;ref name="culte2"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.culte.gov.ro/biserici-culte "Culte recunoscute oficial în România" ("Religious Denominations Officially Recognized in Romania")], at the [[Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs (Romania)|Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs]], [http://www.culte.ro/ Under-Secretariat for Culture and Religious Affairs]; accessed January 24, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; According to a national census held in 2011, it has 49,820 adherents, making it the country's tenth-largest denomination. Each congregation is supervised by a group of elders appointed by the [[Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses]]. The magazines ''[[The Watchtower]]'' and ''[[Awake!]]'' are both published in Romanian.&lt;ref name="culte"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.culte.gov.ro/organizaia-religioas-martorii-lui-iehova "Organizația Religioasă 'Martorii Lui Iehova'" ("The Jehovah's Witnesses Religious Body")], at the [[Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs (Romania)|Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs]], [http://www.culte.ro/ Under-Secretariat for Culture and Religious Affairs]; accessed July 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="INSSE-etnie-2011"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.recensamantromania.ro/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/sR_Tab_13.xls Populaţia stabilă după religie  - judeţe, municipii, oraşe, comune], National Institute of Statistics; accessed September 6, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Founding and interwar period===
[[Bible Student movement|Bible Student]] groups first appeared in present-day Romania through [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] missionaries in [[Transylvania]].&lt;ref name="Ramet190"/&gt; In particular, two emigrants who in 1911 returned from the [[United States]] to their hometown of [[Târgu Mureș]] (''Marosvásárhely'') managed to convert local Hungarians to their creed. They published the first edition of ''The Watchtower'' in Hungarian in 1914, with the first Romanian version coming out two years later, also in Târgu Mureș.&lt;ref name="tiu"/&gt; Similar groups were also active in the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]] prior to [[World War I]], and there remain groups under the "Bible Student" name in Romania today. In 1920, Ioan B. Sima, a former [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Greek-Catholic]], was sent from the United States to organise the community, which was divided into four groups in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Ramet190"/&gt; After the [[Union of Transylvania with Romania]] in 1918, the headquarters moved to [[Cluj]], with the first Watch Tower Society set up there two years later, its congregation mainly Hungarian. The society functioned as a regional hub, coordinating activities for [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and [[Principality of Albania|Albania]].&lt;ref name="tiu"/&gt; Following a leadership dispute in the Bible Student movement in the United States, those who remained associated with the [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Watch Tower Society]] became known as ''Jehovah's witnesses'' in 1931.&lt;ref name="culte"/&gt;

During the [[Interwar period|interwar]] period of [[Greater Romania]] the government imposed successive bans on the group's operations. The first came in 1926: the group was considered a deviation from mainstream Christianity and an extra headache for authorities busy dealing with new extremist movements.&lt;ref name="tiu"/&gt; At that point, ''The Watchtower'' was banned, part of a wider move to curtail the group's publications.&lt;ref name="p106"&gt;Pintilie, Fătu-Tutoveanu, p.106&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1930s, pressure had eased and the headquarters moved to Bucharest,&lt;ref name="tiu"/&gt; as part of a shift into eastern and southern Romania.&lt;ref name="p106"/&gt; Orthodox [[Ukrainians of Romania|Ukrainians]] and [[Serbs of Romania|Serbs]] were converted, followed by Romanian [[Romanian Union Conference of Seventh-day Adventists|Seventh-day Adventists]] in [[Moldavia]] and inroads into [[Dobruja]], [[Oltenia]] and [[Muntenia]].&lt;ref name="tiu"/&gt; The group was legalised again in 1933; its application to register as a [[joint-stock company]] claimed 2000 members at the time.&lt;ref name="tiu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="p106"/&gt; The following ban came in 1937, as the rule of [[Carol II of Romania|King Carol II]] was sliding into authoritarianism. In the piece of legislation passed to this effect by the [[Gheorghe Tătărescu]] cabinet, they were defined as one of the "religious associations and sects" whose activity on Romanian soil was prohibited; the list also included the [[Pentecostal Union of Romania|Pentecostals]], the [[Apostolic Faith Church of God]], the [[Apostolic Christian Church (Nazarene)|Nazarenes]], the [[Old Calendar Romanian Orthodox Church|Old Calendar Orthodox]], the [[Inochentism|Inochentist church]] and [[Bible society|Bible societies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/vestitorul/1937/BCUCLUJ_FP_279921_1937_013_017_018.pdf "Interzicerea sectelor şi asociaţiilor religioase" ("The Banning of Sects and Religious Associations")], in ''Vestitorul'', Nr. 17-18/1937, p.165 (digitized by the [[Babeş-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tiu"/&gt;

As a result of their [[Conscientious objector|conscientious objection]], Jehovah's Witnesses were persecuted during [[World War II]] under the [[Ion Antonescu]] regime.&lt;ref name="fate"&gt;[http://www.r-s-g.info/downloads/rsg-1-2007.pdf "Jehovah's Witnesses in East Central, South Eastern and Southern Europe. The Fate of a Religious Minority (book reviews)"], in LIT Verlag's [http://www.r-s-g.info/index.html ''Religion-Staat-Gesellschaft''], 1/2007&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the leadership withdrew to [[Northern Transylvania]] after the area was ceded to Hungary in 1940.&lt;ref name="tiu"/&gt; One leader, Martin Magyarosi, was arrested in September 1942, followed later by another, Pamfil Albu.&lt;ref name="p106"/&gt; A number of Witnesses from Northern Transylvania were interned in a prison camp in the Serbian town of [[Bor, Serbia|Bor]], alongside Jews and Adventists.&lt;ref name="tiu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="p106"/&gt;

===Communist era and subsequent developments===
[[File:2010-IMG 3897.jpg|thumb|300px|A Kingdom Hall in [[Turda]]]]
In the aftermath of the August 1944 [[King Michael Coup]], the Witnesses reverted to their 1933 status, and were given enhanced protections when they registered as a "legal entity" in July 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Pintilie, Fătu-Tutoveanu, p.106-07&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945&amp;ndash;46, the Witnesses were permitted to openly publish their literature in Romanian; however, in 1948, their operations were again banned when the new [[Communist Romania|Romanian Communist regime]] excluded them from its list of official religious communities;&lt;ref name="Ramet190"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tiu"/&gt; another account places the ban in 1949, by governmental decree.&lt;ref name="tiu"/&gt; In August of that year, the Bucharest office was closed, its subsidiary buildings and equipment seized.&lt;ref name="p107"&gt;Pintilie, Fătu-Tutoveanu, p.107&lt;/ref&gt; The group presented forthright critiques of ecclesiastical, social and political institutions, as well as [[Apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] pronouncements that were considered subversive by the Communist regime. Even more than their radical [[millenarianism]], their opposition to military service and what officials understood as the Witnesses' attitude to the Romanian state were also considered unacceptable. Stories claiming that Jehovah's Witnesses were prepared to become personally involved in overcoming the powers of darkness and to bring to a consummation the [[Eschatology of Jehovah's Witnesses|climactic eschatological moment]] were circulated, increasing pressure on the group.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, p.189-90&lt;/ref&gt; Its close ties to the United States also proved problematic, with members accused of espionage on behalf of the Cold War superpower. At the time of the ban, the group had some 15,000 members. A number of leaders, as well as ordinary faithful, were imprisoned on charges including public instigation, distribution of banned material and conspiracy against the social order, as well as draft evasion.&lt;ref name="tiu"&gt;{{ro icon}} Ilarion Țiu, [http://www.adevarul.ro/cultura/Istoria_crestinismului-Martorii_lui_Iehova-Biserici_neoprotestante_0_804519724.html "Martorii lui Iehova aşteaptă cu răbdare bătălia Armaghedonului"], ''Adevărul'', November 4, 2012; accessed November 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Among those arrested were the leadership; Albu, Magyarosi and Petre Ranca were convicted of spying on behalf of an "Anglo-American network".&lt;ref name="p107"/&gt;

Officials maintained close surveillance of the Witness community, subjected its members to intense harassment and discrimination, and deprived them of their civil rights on various occasions. The media and other methods were also employed against the Witnesses. Religious scholar Earl A. Pope cites an American report which stated that in 1975 there were "heavy persecutions" in a number of major cities, including brutal beatings, continuous questioning in excess of fifty hours at a time, and physical torture, as well as many hundreds of house searches throughout the country and seizure of religious literature.&lt;ref name="Ramet190"/&gt; However, repression began to diminish somewhat at that point, although sentences for draft evasion continued to be pronounced.&lt;ref name="p107"/&gt; The Governing Body tried to negotiate with the Romanian government, but their communications were unanswered. No precise figures are available as to the size of the movement under Communism, but it was large enough to create considerable apprehension for officials.&lt;ref name="Ramet190"&gt;Pope, p.190&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated there were 17,000 adherents in 1989.&lt;ref name="tiu"/&gt;

While repressive measures were relaxed starting in the mid-1970s, gaining new converts proved difficult. One method involved members traveling in pairs by train, starting a conversation on religious topics and beginning to [[Proselytism|proselytize]] after gaining the interest of others in their compartment. Another strategy was to start religious discussions in cemeteries or in crowded areas like rail and bus stations. ''The Watchtower'' was sent into Romania in English, translated by Witnesses into Romanian, the manuscript sent into [[Austria]] and copies then brought back into Romania, distributed to members and used in conversion efforts.&lt;ref name="tiu"/&gt; According to [[United Kingdom|British]] [[political science|political scientist]] [[Thomas Gerard Gallagher|Tom Gallagher]], by the 1980s, one source of converts to the Witnesses, as well as to [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations, was the new working class housed in urban high-rise settlements, as the Orthodox hierarchy was reluctant to take care of this group's religious needs.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, p.65&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with the [[World Council of Churches]]' official magazine, [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] [[Antonie Plămădeală]] of the dominant [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] said that gaining official recognition would have been very difficult for Jehovah's Witnesses in Romania because of their attitude toward the Communist state and to military service, but it would not have been impossible if the state had better understood their views and been less paranoid. He claimed that if they kept a low profile and were not active against the state, the authorities would be unconcerned about them.&lt;ref name="Ramet190"/&gt;

Following the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], Jehovah's Witnesses in Romania received legal status as a religious association on April 9, 1990.&lt;ref name="corlatan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ramet289"/&gt;&lt;ref name="p107"/&gt; That year, their first congresses took place at [[Brașov]] and then Bucharest, resulting in the baptism of 1500 new members; they claimed 35,000 adherents by 1996.&lt;ref name="tiu"/&gt; Since its legalization, opposition has come from the Orthodox Church, which considers the group to be a heretical sect that employs "aggressive proselytism". In July 1996, the Orthodox Church influenced the authorities to cancel a planned international convention of Jehovah's Witnesses that had been scheduled to take place in Bucharest in July 1996.&lt;ref&gt;''Human Rights Watch World Report 1997: Events of 1996'', [[Human Rights Watch]], 1996, p.230. {{ISBN|1-56432-207-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="corlatan"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Mirela Corlăţan]], [http://www.ziaruldeiasi.ro/local/iasi/martorii-lui-iehova-au-intrat-in-legalitate~ni31mj "Martorii lui Iehova au intrat în legalitate" ("Jehovah's Witnesses Legalised")], in ''[[Ziarul de Iaşi]]'', June 20, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ramet289"&gt;Ramet, p.289&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, at a time when they were encountering difficulty obtaining authorization for new buildings and cemeteries, the [[Ministry of Culture and National Patrimony (Romania)|Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs]] rejected a request for the Witnesses' recognition as a religious denomination. In 2000, fourteen young members were involved in cases before the military authorities, having refused both obligatory army service and two years of community service in exchange for a year of conscription duty. They received suspended prison sentences, drawing condemnation from [[Amnesty International]], but these were subsequently annulled by the [[High Court of Cassation and Justice|Supreme Court of Justice]].&lt;ref name="tiu"/&gt; Pursuant to a ruling by the same court in 2000, the Culture Ministry granted the group official recognition in 2003,&lt;ref name="culte"/&gt; making it the first denomination to be recognised since the aftermath of the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51575.htm "Romania"], International Religious Freedom Report 2005, [[United States Department of State]], [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, there were an estimated 300 Kingdom Halls serving some 500 congregations; the group claimed 100,000 members that year, of whom 20,000 were living abroad.&lt;ref name="tiu"/&gt; The census held the prior year, the country's first to record Witnesses, found 49,820 adherents or 0.26% of the population for whom data were available. The highest numbers were found in the counties of [[Mureș County|Mureș]] (6981), [[Maramureș County|Maramureș]] (5960), [[Cluj County|Cluj]] (5783), [[Satu Mare County|Satu Mare]] (3841) and [[Brașov County|Brașov]] (2455), all in Transylvania.&lt;ref name="INSSE-etnie-2011"/&gt;

[[Image:Serp manif1917.jpg|frame|1917 Seymist rally]]The '''Jewish Socialist Workers Party''' ({{lang-ru|Социалистическая еврейская рабочая партия}}, 'SERP', which means '[[sickle]]' in Russian), often nicknamed ''Seymists'', was a [[Jew]]ish [[socialist]] [[political party]] in the [[Russian Empire]]. The party was founded in April 1906, emerging out of the ''Vozrozhdenie'' (Renaissance) circles. The ''Vozrozhdenie'' was a non-[[Marxist]] tendency which was led by the nonmarxist thinker and politician [[Chaim Zhitlowsky]]. Zhitlowsky became the theoretician of the new party that advocated with the same emphasis Jewish self-reliance and socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Patkin, A. L. ''The Origins of the Russian-Jewish Labour Movement'', Melbourne and London 1947, pp. 153 ff&lt;/ref&gt; Leaders of the party included Avrom Rozin ([[Ben-Adir]]), N. Shits, [[Moishe Zilberfarb|Dr. M. Zilberfarb]] and Mark Ratner. The party was close to the [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]] (PSR).&lt;ref name="pink"&gt;Pinkus, Benjamin. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=52Ew77pZsNUC The Jews of the Soviet Union: the history of a national minority. (Soviet and East European Studies)]''.  [[Cambridge]]: Cambridge University Press, 1988; p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

The party favored the idea of a Jewish National Assembly (a Seym). It envisaged a federation of nationalities in Russia, each led by an elected body of representatives with political powers inside their community. At a later stage, the Jews would seek territorial concentration.&lt;ref name="pink"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ber Borochov|Borochov, Ber]], and Mitchell Cohen. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JswkC1HQ6cIC Class Struggle and the Jewish Nation: selected essays in Marxist Zionism].'' [[New Brunswick]]: Transaction Books, 1984. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="harn"&gt;Ėstraĭkh, G. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=oVQKYbTFpPsC In Harness: Yiddish writers' romance with Communism; Judaic traditions in literature, music, and art.]'' [[Syracuse, New York]]: Syracuse University Press, 2005. p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frankel, Jonathan. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-ycwctuCSpQC Prophecy and Politics: Socialism, Nationalism, and the Russian Jews, 1862-1917]''. [[Cambridge]]: Cambridge University Press, 1981. p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marx2mao.com/Lenin/CRNQ13.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The party actively supported [[Yiddish]] language and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Ėstraĭkh, G. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=oVQKYbTFpPsC In Harness: Yiddish writers' romance with Communism; Judaic traditions in literature, music, and art.]'' [[Syracuse, New York]]: Syracuse University Press, 2005. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The party published the Yiddish-language newspaper ''Folks-shtime'' ('People's Voice') from [[Kiev]] and [[Vilna]].&lt;ref&gt;Ėstraĭkh, G. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=oVQKYbTFpPsC In Harness: Yiddish Writers' Romance with Communism. Judaic traditions in literature, music, and art.]'' [[Syracuse, New York]]: Syracuse University Press, 2005. p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yivoinstitute.org/pdf/newspapers_periodicals.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212222942/http://www.yivoinstitute.org/pdf/newspapers_periodicals.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The party also published the organ ''Vozrozhdenie''.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8z8mdUYp-6gC Anarchist Voices: an oral history of Anarchism in America]''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1995; p. 387&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1906 period, the party had 3,000 of its cadres organized in paramilitary self-defense units. However, about 400 of them were killed or wounded in fighting and 1,000 arrested.&lt;ref&gt;Frankel, Jonathan. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-ycwctuCSpQC Prophecy and Politics: Socialism, Nationalism, and the Russian Jews, 1862-1917]''. [[Cambridge]]: Cambridge University Press, 1981. p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907 a formal alliance between SERP and the PSR was signed, making SERP a sub-section of the PSR. The alliance was however mainly the product of the relations between Zhitlowsky and Mark Ratner, and did not have full support from the SERP grassroots. Many local SERP branches wanted unity with the Marxist groups rather than the PSR. Through the link-up with PSR, SERP was included in the [[Second International]]. Just after the deal with PSR, SERP gained a consultative vote at the 1907 [[Stuttgart]] congress of the International.&lt;ref&gt;Frankel, Jonathan. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-ycwctuCSpQC Prophecy and Politics: Socialism, Nationalism, and the Russian Jews, 1862-1917]''. [[Cambridge]]: Cambridge University Press, 1981. p. 283&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="j8"&gt;Jacobs, Jack Lester. ''Jewish Politics in Eastern Europe: the Bund at 100''. Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2001; p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911 SERP, [[Zionist Socialist Workers Party]] and [[Poalei Zion]] signed a joint appeal to the [[International Socialist Bureau]], asking the International to recognize the national character of the Jewish people.&lt;ref name="j8"/&gt;

In 1917 the party merged with the Zionist Socialist Workers Party, forming the [[United Jewish Socialist Workers Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Schatz, Jaff.

'''John Winston Ono Lennon'''{{efn|Lennon changed his name by [[deed poll]] on 22 April 1969, adding "Ono" as a middle name. Although he used the name John Ono Lennon thereafter, official documents referred to him as John Winston Ono Lennon, since he was not permitted to revoke a name given at birth as per British statute.{{sfn|Coleman|1984b|p=64}}}}&lt;!-- This has been subject of debate, but both "Winston" AND "Winston Ono" are correct; Lennon wished for it to be solely Ono; however, as the Beatles Bible puts it, "Technically, Lennon was unable to lose the Winston from his name, as UK law dictates that a person is unable to fully revoke a name given at birth. As a result, his official name became John Winston Ono Lennon, with the ten 'O's he wished to avoid." See the YOKO ONO section of the article, which explains the legality of the matter.--&gt; {{post-nominals|country=GBR|MBE}} (9 October 1940{{snds}}8 December 1980) was an English singer, songwriter, and peace activist who co-founded [[the Beatles]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://johnlennonpeace.weebly.com/the-john-lennon-peace-movement.html|title=The John Lennon Peace Movement|website=The John Lennon Peace Movement Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most commercially successful band in the history of [[popular music]]. He and fellow member [[Paul McCartney]] formed a [[Lennon–McCartney|much-celebrated songwriting partnership]]. Along with [[George Harrison]] and [[Ringo Starr]], the group would ascend to worldwide fame during the 1960s.

He was born as '''John Winston Lennon'''&lt;!-- See: Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Biographies --&gt; in [[Liverpool]], where he became involved in the [[Skiffle#Skiffle in Britain|skiffle craze]] as a teenager. In 1957, he formed his first band, [[the Quarrymen]], which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. Lennon began to record as a solo artist before [[Break-up of the Beatles|the band's break-up]] in April 1970; two of those songs were "[[Give Peace a Chance]]" and "[[Instant Karma!]]" Lennon subsequently produced albums that included ''[[John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band]]'' and ''[[Imagine (John Lennon album)|Imagine]]'', and songs such as &lt;!-- Before adding to this list of Lennon's most significant songs, please seek consensus on the talk page first. Thank you. --&gt; "[[Working Class Hero]]", "[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]" and "[[Happy Xmas (War Is Over)]]". After he married [[Yoko Ono]] in 1969, he added "Ono" as one of his middle names. Lennon disengaged himself from the music business in 1975 to raise his infant son [[Sean Lennon|Sean]], but re-emerged with Ono in 1980 with the album ''[[Double Fantasy]]''. He was [[Murder of John Lennon|shot and killed]] in the archway of his [[Manhattan, New York City|Manhattan]] apartment building three weeks after the album was released.

Lennon revealed a rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews. Controversial through his political and [[peace activist|peace activism]], he moved from London to Manhattan in 1971, where his criticism of the [[Vietnam War]] resulted in a lengthy attempt by the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon administration]] to deport him. Some of his songs were adopted as anthems by the [[anti-war movement]] and the larger [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]].

By 2012, Lennon's solo album sales in the United States had exceeded 14 million units. He had 25 number-one singles on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart as a writer, co-writer, or performer. In 2002, Lennon was voted eighth in a BBC poll of the [[100 Greatest Britons]] and in 2008, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked him the fifth-greatest singer of all time.  In 1987, he was posthumously inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]]. Lennon was twice posthumously inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]: first in 1988 as a member of the Beatles and again in 1994 as a solo artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/event/john-lennon/?flavour=mobile|title=Lennon's 70th birthday|publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]|accessdate=8 October 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402120534/http://rockhall.com/event/john-lennon/?flavour=mobile|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===1940–1957: Early years===
[[File:Mendipsnationaltrust.JPG|thumb|alt=A grey two-storey building, with numerous windows visible on both levels|Lennon's home at 251 Menlove Avenue in Liverpool, where he lived for most of his childhood|left]]Lennon was born on 9 October 1940 at Liverpool Maternity Hospital, to [[Julia Lennon|Julia (née Stanley)]] (1914–1958) and [[Alfred Lennon]] (1912–1976). Alfred was a [[Merchant Navy|merchant seaman]] of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent who was away at the time of his son's birth.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=504}} His parents named him John Winston Lennon after his paternal grandfather, John "Jack" Lennon, and Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]].{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=24: "Julia offered the name in honour of&amp;nbsp;... Winston Churchill"}} His father was often away from home but sent regular pay cheques to 9{{nbsp}}Newcastle Road, Liverpool, where Lennon lived with his mother;{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=24: "The entire Stanley clan gathered nightly at Newcastle Road"}} the cheques stopped when he went [[AWOL|absent without leave]] in February 1944.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=54: "Until then he had sent her money each month from his wages, but now it stopped"}}{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=26: "In February 1944&amp;nbsp;... he was arrested and imprisoned. Freddie subsequently disappeared for six months"}} When he eventually came home six months later, he offered to look after the family, but Julia, by then pregnant with another man's child, rejected the idea.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=27}} After her sister [[Mimi Smith|Mimi]] complained to Liverpool's Social Services twice, Julia gave her custody of Lennon. In July 1946, Lennon's father visited her and took his son to Blackpool, secretly intending to emigrate to New Zealand with him.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=56: "Alf admitted to her that he had planned to take John to live in New Zealand"}} Julia followed them—with her partner at the time, 'Bobby' Dykins—and after a heated argument his father forced the five-year-old to choose between them. Lennon twice chose his father, but as his mother walked away, he began to cry and followed her,{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=30: "Julia went out of the door&amp;nbsp;... John ran after her"}} although this has been disputed. According to author Mark Lewisohn, Lennon's parents agreed that Julia should take him and give him a home as Alf left again. A witness who was there that day, Billy Hall, has said the dramatic scene often portrayed with a young John Lennon having to make a decision between his parents never happened.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|p=41-42}} It would be 20 years before he had contact with his father again.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=497}}

Throughout the rest of his childhood and adolescence, Lennon lived at [[251 Menlove Avenue|Mendips, 251{{nbsp}}Menlove Avenue]], [[Woolton]] with Mimi and her husband [[George Toogood Smith]], who had no children of their own.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=56: "Hard to see why Mimi wanted John, as she had always said she didn't want children"}} His aunt purchased volumes of short stories for him, and his uncle, a dairyman at his family's farm, bought him a mouth organ and engaged him in solving {{linktext|crossword}} puzzles.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=32: "When he was old enough, taught John how to solve crossword puzzles"}} Julia visited Mendips on a regular basis, and when John was 11 years old he often visited her at 1&amp;nbsp;Blomfield Road, Liverpool, where she played him [[Elvis Presley]] records, taught him the banjo, and showed him how to play [[Ain't That a Shame]] by [[Fats Domino]].{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=48: "To get them started, she applied the triad to 'Ain't That a Shame'"}} In September 1980, Lennon commented about his family and his rebellious nature:

{{quote|Part of me would like to be accepted by all facets of society and ''not'' be this loudmouthed lunatic poet/musician. But I cannot be what I am not&amp;nbsp;... I was the one who all the other boys' parents—including Paul's father—would say, 'Keep away from him' ...&amp;nbsp;The parents instinctively recognised I was a troublemaker, meaning I did not conform and I would influence their children, which I did. I did my best to disrupt every friend's home&amp;nbsp;... Partly out of envy that I didn't have this so-called home&amp;nbsp;... but I ''did'' ...&amp;nbsp;There were five women that were my family. Five ''strong'', ''intelligent'', ''beautiful'' women, five sisters. One happened to be my mother. [She] just couldn't deal with life. She was the youngest and she had a husband who ran away to sea and the war was on and she couldn't cope with me, and I ended up living with her elder sister. Now those women were fantastic&amp;nbsp;... And that was my first feminist education&amp;nbsp;... I would infiltrate the other boys' minds. I could say, "Parents are not gods because I don't live with mine and, therefore, I know."{{sfn|Sheff|1981|pp=134–136}}}}

He regularly visited his cousin, Stanley Parkes, who lived in [[Fleetwood]] and took him on trips to local cinemas.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=32: "Parkes recalled&amp;nbsp;... Leila and John to the cinema as often as three times a day"}} During the school holidays, Parkes often visited Lennon with Leila Harvey, another cousin, and the threesome often travelled to Blackpool two or three times a week to watch shows. They would visit the [[Blackpool Tower Circus]] and see artists such as [[Dickie Valentine]], [[Arthur Askey]], [[Max Bygraves]] and [[Joe Loss]], with Parkes recalling that Lennon particularly liked [[George Formby, Jr.|George Formby]].{{sfn|Harry|2009}} After Parkes's family moved to Scotland, the three cousins often spent their school holidays together there. Parkes recalled, "John, cousin Leila and I were very close. From Edinburgh we would drive up to the family croft at [[Durness]], which was from about the time John was nine years old until he was about 16."{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=702}} He was 14 years old when his uncle George died of a liver haemorrhage on 5 June 1955, at age 52.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=819}}

[[File:John Lennon's stamp collection.jpg|thumb|Lennon's childhood stamp collection|alt=]]Lennon was raised as an [[Anglican]] and attended [[Dovedale Primary School]].{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=411}} After passing his [[eleven-plus]] exam, he attended [[Quarry Bank High School]] in Liverpool from September 1952 to 1957, and was described by Harvey at the time as a "happy-go-lucky, good-humoured, easy going, lively lad".{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=32–33}} He often drew comical cartoons that appeared in his own self-made school magazine called ''The Daily Howl''.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=40}}

In 2005, the [[National Postal Museum]] in the US acquired a stamp collection that Lennon had assembled when he was a boy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/john-lennons-first-album-71943851/?no-ist John Lennon's First Album.] Owen Edwards, Smithsonian.com, September 2005. Retrieved 17 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Julia bought John his first guitar. The instrument was an inexpensive [[Gallotone Champion]] acoustic for which she lent her son five pounds and ten shillings on the condition that the guitar be delivered to her own house and not Mimi's, knowing well that her sister was not supportive of her son's musical aspirations.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=45}} Mimi was sceptical of his claim that he would be famous one day, and she hoped that he would grow bored with music, often telling him, "The guitar's all very well, John, but you'll never make a living out of it".{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=89}} On 15 July 1958 (when Lennon was 17 years old) his mother was struck and killed by a car while she was walking home after visiting the Smiths' house.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=48}}

Lennon failed his O-level examinations and was accepted into the [[Liverpool College of Art]] after his aunt and headmaster intervened.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=100}} Once at the college, he started wearing [[Teddy Boy]] clothes and was threatened with expulsion for his behaviour.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=553–555}} He was "thrown out of the college before his final year".{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=50}}

====1957–1966: Formation, commercial break-out and touring years====
[[File:Paul, George &amp; John.png|thumb|Lennon (right) performing with fellow band mates [[Paul McCartney]] and [[George Harrison]] in 1964]]
At age 15, Lennon formed the [[skiffle group]], the Quarrymen. Named after Quarry Bank High School, the group was established by Lennon in September 1956.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=738}} By the summer of 1957, the Quarrymen played a "spirited set of songs" made up of half skiffle and half [[rock and roll]].{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=95}} Lennon first met Paul McCartney at the Quarrymen's second performance, which was held in Woolton on 6 July at the St. Peter's Church garden fête. Lennon then asked McCartney to join the band.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=93–99}}

McCartney said that Aunt Mimi "was very aware that John's friends were lower class", and would often patronise him when he arrived to visit Lennon.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=44}} According to Paul's brother Mike, McCartney's father was also disapproving, declaring that Lennon would get his son "into trouble",{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=32}} although he later allowed the fledgling band to rehearse in the McCartneys' front room at [[20 Forthlin Road|20{{nbsp}}Forthlin Road]].{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=38–39}}{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=47}} During this time, 18-year-old Lennon wrote his first song, "[[Hello Little Girl]]", a UK top 10 hit for [[The Fourmost]] nearly five years later.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=337–338}}[[File:Beatles Trenter 1963 (cropped).jpg|alt=A black-and-white image of a young John Lennon smiling, taken from 1963|left|thumb|Lennon in 1963]]

McCartney recommended his friend [[George Harrison]] to be the lead guitarist.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=47, 50}} Lennon thought that Harrison, then 14 years old, was too young. McCartney engineered an audition on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, where Harrison played [[Raunchy (instrumental)|Raunchy]] for Lennon and was asked to join.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=47}} [[Stuart Sutcliffe]], Lennon's friend from art school, later joined as bassist.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=64}} Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Sutcliffe became "The Beatles" in early 1960. In August that year, the Beatles engaged for a 48-night [[The Beatles in Hamburg|residency in Hamburg]], Germany and were desperately in need of a drummer. They asked [[Pete Best]] to join them.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=57}} Lennon was now 19, and his aunt, horrified when he told her about the trip, pleaded with him to continue his art studies instead.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=53}} After the first Hamburg residency, the band accepted another in April 1961, and a third in April 1962. As with the other band members, Lennon was introduced to [[Preludin]] while in Hamburg,{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=66–67}} and regularly took the drug as a stimulant during their long, overnight performances.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=57}}

[[Brian Epstein]] managed the Beatles from 1962 until his untimely death in 1967. He had no prior experience managing artists, but he had a strong influence on the group's dress code and attitude on stage.{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=67}} Lennon initially resisted his attempts to encourage the band to present a professional appearance, but eventually complied, saying, "I'll wear a bloody balloon if somebody's going to pay me".{{sfn|Frankel|2007}} McCartney took over on bass after Sutcliffe decided to stay in Hamburg, and Pete Best was replaced with drummer [[Ringo Starr]]; this completed the four-piece line-up that would remain until the group's break-up in 1970. The band's first single, "[[Love Me Do]]", was released in October 1962 and reached No. 17 on the British charts. They recorded their debut album, ''[[Please Please Me]]'', in under 10 hours on 11 February 1963,{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=721}} a day when Lennon was suffering the effects of a cold,{{sfn|Lewisohn |1988|pp=24–26: "Twist and Shout, which had to be recorded last because John Lennon had a particularly bad cold"}} which is evident in the vocal on the last song to be recorded that day, "[[Twist and Shout]]".{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=376: "He had been struggling all day to reach notes, but this was different, this hurt"}} The Lennon–McCartney songwriting partnership yielded eight of its fourteen tracks. With a few exceptions, one being the album title itself, Lennon had yet to bring his love of wordplay to bear on his song lyrics, saying: "We were just writing songs{{nbsp}} ... pop songs with no more thought of them than that—to create a sound. And the words were almost irrelevant".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=721}} In a 1987 interview, McCartney said that the other Beatles idolised John: "He was like our own little Elvis{{nbsp}} ... We all looked up to John. He was older and he was very much the leader; he was the quickest wit and the smartest."{{sfn|Doggett|2010|p=33}}[[File:Televisie-optreden van The Beatles in Treslong te Hillegom vlnr. Paul McCartney, Bestanddeelnr 916-5099.jpg|thumb|Lennon (right) performing in 1964 at the height of [[Beatlemania]]|alt=Monochrome image of The Beatles performing on a stage wearing dark suits]]

The Beatles achieved mainstream success in the UK early in 1963. Lennon was on tour when his first son, [[Julian Lennon|Julian]], was born in April. During their [[Royal Variety Show]] performance, which was attended by the Queen Mother and other British royalty, Lennon poked fun at the audience: "For our next song, I'd like to ask for your help. For the people in the cheaper seats, clap your hands{{nbsp}} ... and the rest of you, if you'll just rattle your jewellery."{{sfn|Shennan|2007}} After a year of [[Beatlemania in the United Kingdom|Beatlemania in the UK]], the group's historic February 1964 US debut appearance on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' marked their breakthrough to international stardom. A two-year period of constant touring, filmmaking, and songwriting followed, during which Lennon wrote two books, ''[[In His Own Write]]'' and ''[[A Spaniard in the Works]]''.{{sfn|Coleman|1984a|pp=239–240}} The Beatles received recognition from the British Establishment when they were appointed [[Order of the British Empire|Members of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in the [[1965 Birthday Honours|1965 Queen's Birthday Honours]].{{sfn|London Gazette|1965|pp=5487–5489}}

Lennon grew concerned that fans who attended Beatles concerts were unable to hear the music above the screaming of fans, and that the band's musicianship was beginning to suffer as a result.{{sfn|Coleman|1984a|p=288}} Lennon's "[[Help! (song)|Help!]]" expressed his own feelings in 1965: "I ''meant'' it{{nbsp}} ... It was me singing 'help'".{{sfn|Gould|2008|p=268}} He had put on weight (he would later refer to this as his "Fat Elvis" period),{{sfn|Lawrence|2005|p=62}} and felt he was subconsciously seeking change.{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=171}} In March that year he was unknowingly introduced to [[LSD]] when a dentist, hosting a dinner party attended by Lennon, Harrison and their wives, spiked the guests' coffee with the drug.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2012|pp=51–52}} When they wanted to leave, their host revealed what they had taken, and strongly advised them not to leave the house because of the likely effects. Later, in a lift at a nightclub, they all believed it was on fire: "We were all screaming{{nbsp}} ... hot and hysterical."{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=570}}
{{Anchor|BiggerThanJesus}} In March 1966, during an interview with ''Evening Standard'' reporter [[Maureen Cleave]], Lennon remarked, "Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink{{nbsp}} ... We're more popular than Jesus now—I don't know which will go first, rock and roll or Christianity."{{sfn|Cleave|2007}} The comment went virtually unnoticed in England but caused [[More popular than Jesus|great offence in the US]] when quoted by a magazine there five months later. The furore that followed, which included the burning of Beatles records, [[Ku Klux Klan]] activity and threats against Lennon, contributed to the band's decision to stop touring.{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=5–6, 249, 281, 347}}

====1967–1970: Studio years, break-up and solo work====
After the Beatles' final concert on 29 August 1966, Lennon was deprived of the routine of live performances; he felt lost and considered leaving the band.{{sfn|Brown|1983|p=222}} Since his involuntary introduction to LSD, he had increased his use of the drug and was almost constantly under its influence for much of 1967.{{sfn|Gould|2008|p=319}} According to biographer Ian MacDonald, Lennon's continuous experimentation with LSD during the year brought him "close to [[Egolessness|erasing his identity]]".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=281}} The year 1967 saw the release of "[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]", hailed by ''Time'' magazine for its "astonishing inventiveness",{{sfn|Time|1967}} and the group's landmark album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', which revealed lyrics by Lennon that contrasted strongly with the simple love songs of the 'Lennon–McCartney' early years.

After the Beatles were introduced to the [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]], the group attended an August weekend of personal instruction at his [[Transcendental Meditation]] seminar in Bangor, Wales.{{sfn|BBC News|2007b}} During the seminar, they were informed of Epstein's death. "I knew we were in trouble then", Lennon said later. "I didn't have any misconceptions about our ability to do anything other than play music, and I was scared".{{sfn|Brown|1983|p=276}} Led primarily by Harrison and Lennon's interest in Eastern religion, the Beatles later travelled to Maharishi's [[ashram]] in India for further guidance.{{sfn|Doggett|2010|pp=33, 34}} While there, they composed most of the songs for ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'' and ''[[Abbey Road]]''.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=397}}

The anti-war, black comedy ''[[How I Won the War]]'', featuring Lennon's only appearance in a non–Beatles full-length film, was shown in cinemas in October 1967.{{sfn|Hoppa|2010}} McCartney organised the group's first post-Epstein project,{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=349-373}} the self-written, produced and directed television film ''[[Magical Mystery Tour (film)|Magical Mystery Tour]]'', which was released in December that year. While the film itself proved to be their first critical flop, its [[Magical Mystery Tour|soundtrack release]], featuring Lennon's acclaimed, [[Lewis Carroll]]-inspired "[[I Am the Walrus]]", was a success.{{sfn|Logan|1967}}{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=131}} With Epstein gone, the band members became increasingly involved in business activities, and in February 1968 they formed [[Apple Corps]], a multimedia corporation composed of [[Apple Records]] and several other subsidiary companies. Lennon described the venture as an attempt to achieve "artistic freedom within a business structure",{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=31}} but his increased drug experimentation and growing preoccupation with [[Yoko Ono]], combined with the Beatles' inability to agree on how the company should be run, left Apple in need of professional management. Lennon asked [[Lord Beeching]] to take on the role, but he declined, advising Lennon to go back to making records. Lennon was approached by [[Allen Klein]], who had managed [[the Rolling Stones]] and other bands during the [[British Invasion]]. In early 1969, Klein was appointed as Apple's chief executive by Lennon, Harrison and Starr,{{sfn|TelegraphKlein|2010}} but McCartney never signed the management contract.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=549: "Paul never did sign the management contract"}}

At the end of 1968, Lennon was featured in the film ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]'' in the role of a [[The Dirty Mac|Dirty Mac]] band member. The film was not released until 1996. The [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]], composed of Lennon, [[Eric Clapton]], [[Keith Richards]] and [[Mitch Mitchell]], also backed a vocal performance by Ono in the film.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=774–775}} Lennon and Ono were married on 20 March 1969, and soon released a series of 14 [[lithograph]]s called "Bag One" depicting scenes from their honeymoon,{{sfn|Fawcett|1976|p=185}} eight of which were deemed indecent and most of which were banned and confiscated.{{sfn|Coleman|1984a|p=279}} Lennon's creative focus continued to move beyond the Beatles and between 1968 and 1969 he and Ono recorded three albums of experimental music together: ''[[Unfinished Music No.1: Two Virgins]]''{{sfn|Coleman|1984a|pp=48–49}} (known more for its cover than for its music), ''[[Unfinished Music No.2: Life with the Lions]]'' and ''[[Wedding Album]]''. In 1969, they formed the [[Plastic Ono Band]], releasing ''[[Live Peace in Toronto 1969]]''. Between 1969 and 1970, Lennon released the singles "Give Peace a Chance", which was widely adopted as an anti-Vietnam-War anthem in 1969,{{sfn|Perone|2001|pp=57–58}} "[[Cold Turkey]]", which documented his withdrawal symptoms after he became addicted to heroin,{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=160–161}} and "[[Instant Karma!]]"

Lennon left the Beatles in September 1969,{{sfn|Edmondson|2010|pp=129–130}} and agreed not to inform the media while the group renegotiated their recording contract, but he was outraged that McCartney publicised his own departure on releasing [[McCartney (album)|his debut solo album]] in April 1970. Lennon's reaction was, "Jesus Christ! He gets all the credit for it!"{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=853–54}} He later wrote, "I started the band. I disbanded it. It's as simple as that."{{sfn|Loker|2009|p=348}} In later interviews with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, he revealed his bitterness towards McCartney, saying, "I was a fool not to do what Paul did, which was use it to sell a record."{{sfn|Wenner|2000|p=32}} Lennon also spoke of the hostility he perceived the other members had towards Ono, and of how he, Harrison, and Starr "got fed up with being sidemen for Paul&amp;nbsp;... After Brian Epstein died we collapsed. Paul took over and supposedly led us. But what is leading us when we went round in circles?"{{sfn|Wenner|2000|p=24}}

===1970–1980: Solo career===

====1970–1972: Initial solo success and activism====
[[File:John Lennon Imagine 1971.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Advertisement for "[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]" from ''Billboard'', 18 September 1971]]

In 1970, Lennon and Ono went through [[Primal therapy#John Lennon|primal therapy]] with [[Arthur Janov]] in Los Angeles, California. Designed to release emotional pain from early childhood, the therapy entailed two half-days a week with Janov for four months; he had wanted to treat the couple for longer, but they felt no need to continue and returned to London.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=408–410}} Lennon's debut solo album, ''[[John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band]]'' (1970), was received with praise by many music critics, but its highly personal lyrics and stark sound limited its commercial performance.{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|pp=144, 146}} Critic [[Greil Marcus]] remarked, "John's singing in the last verse of '[[God (John Lennon song)|God]]' may be the finest in all of rock."{{sfn|Blaney|2005|p=56}} The album featured the song "[[Mother (John Lennon song)|Mother]]", in which Lennon confronted his feelings of childhood rejection,{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=640–641}} and the Dylanesque "[[Working Class Hero]]", a bitter attack against the bourgeois social system which, due to the lyric "you're still fucking peasants", fell foul of broadcasters.{{sfn|Riley|2002|p=375}}{{sfn|Schechter|1997|p=106}} The same year, [[Tariq Ali]] expressed his revolutionary political views when he interviewed Lennon. This inspired the singer to write "[[Power to the People (song)|Power to the People]]". Lennon also became involved with Ali during a protest against the prosecution of [[Oz (magazine)|''Oz'' magazine]] for alleged obscenity. Lennon denounced the proceedings as "disgusting fascism", and he and Ono (as Elastic Oz Band) released the single "God Save Us/Do the Oz" and joined marches in support of the magazine.{{sfn|Wiener|1990|p=157}}

{{Listen|type=music|filename=Imagine.ogg|title="Imagine"|description=Sample of "[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]", Lennon's most widely known post-Beatles song.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=382}} Like "Give Peace a Chance", the song became an anti-war anthem, but its lyrics offended religious groups. Lennon's explanation was: "If you can imagine a world at peace, with no denominations of religion—not without religion, but without this 'my god is bigger than your god' thing—then it can be true."{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=382–383}} }}

Eager for a major commercial success, Lennon adopted a more accessible sound for his next album, ''Imagine'' (1971).{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=146}} ''Rolling Stone'' reported that "it contains a substantial portion of good music" but warned of the possibility that "his posturings will soon seem not merely dull but irrelevant".{{sfn|Gerson|1971}} The album's title track later became an anthem for anti-war movements,{{sfn|Vigilla|2005}} while the song "[[How Do You Sleep? (John Lennon song)|How Do You Sleep?]]" was a musical attack on McCartney in response to lyrics on ''[[Ram (album)|Ram]]'' that Lennon felt, and McCartney later confirmed,{{sfn|Goodman|1984}} were directed at him and Ono. Lennon softened his stance in the mid-1970s, however, and said he had written "How Do You Sleep?" about himself.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=354–356}} He said in 1980: "I used my resentment against Paul{{nbsp}} ... to create a song{{nbsp}} ... not a terrible vicious horrible vendetta{{nbsp}}... I used my resentment and withdrawing from Paul and the Beatles, and the relationship with Paul, to write 'How Do You Sleep'. I don't really go 'round with those thoughts in my head all the time."{{sfn|Peebles|1981|p=44}}

Lennon and Ono moved to New York in August 1971 and released "[[Happy Xmas (War Is Over)]]" in December.{{sfn|Allmusic|2010f}} During the new year, the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon administration]] took what it called a "strategic counter-measure" against Lennon's anti-war and anti-Nixon propaganda. The administration embarked on what would be a [[#Deportation attempt|four-year attempt to deport him]].  After [[George McGovern]] lost the presidential election to Richard Nixon in 1972, Lennon and Ono attended a post-election wake held in the New York home of activist [[Jerry Rubin]].&lt;ref name="DeMain"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://performingsongwriter.com/john-lennon-fbi-files/ | title=John Lennon and the FBI | publisher=Performing Songwriter | work=Dangerous Liaisons: The FBI Files of Musicians | accessdate=19 January 2013 | author=Bill DeMain | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117225323/http://performingsongwriter.com/john-lennon-fbi-files/ | archivedate=17 January 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Glenn"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://annarborchronicle.com/2009/12/27/the-day-a-beatle-came-to-town/ | title=The Day a Beatle Came to Town | work=The Ann Arbor Chronicle | date=27 December 2009 | accessdate=19 January 2013 | author=Alan Glenn | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114181138/http://annarborchronicle.com/2009/12/27/the-day-a-beatle-came-to-town/ | archivedate=14 November 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lennon was embroiled in a continuing legal battle with the immigration authorities, and he was denied [[Permanent residence (United States)|permanent residency in the US]]; the issue would not be resolved until 1976.{{sfn|Wiener|1990|p=204}} Lennon was depressed and got intoxicated; he left Ono embarrassed after he had sex with a female guest.

''[[Some Time in New York City]]'' was recorded as a collaboration with Ono and was released in 1972 with backing from the New York band [[Elephant's Memory]]. A double LP, it contained songs about women's rights, race relations, Britain's role in Northern Ireland and Lennon's difficulties in obtaining a green card.{{sfn|BBC News|2006a}} The album was a commercial failure and was maligned by critics, who found its political sloganeering heavy-handed and relentless.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2010|pp=95, 180–82}} The ''[[NME]]''{{'}}s review took the form of an [[open letter]] in which [[Tony Tyler]] derided Lennon as a "pathetic, ageing revolutionary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hunt, Chris (ed.)|title=NME Originals: Beatles – The Solo Years 1970–1980|year=2005|publisher=IPC Ignite!|location=London|isbn=|page=65|title-link=NME}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, "[[Woman Is the Nigger of the World]]" was released as a single from the album and was televised on 11 May, on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]''. Many radio stations refused to broadcast the song because of the word "[[nigger]]".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=979–980}} Lennon and Ono gave two benefit concerts with Elephant's Memory and guests in New York in aid of patients at the [[Willowbrook State School]] mental facility.{{sfn|Deming|2008}} Staged at [[Madison Square Garden]] on 30 August 1972, they were his last full-length concert appearances.{{sfn|The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum|1994}}

====1973–1975: "Lost weekend"====
[[File:John Lennon last television interview Tomorrow show 1975.JPG|thumb|right|Publicity photo of Lennon and host [[Tom Snyder]] from the television programme ''[[Tomorrow (TV series)|Tomorrow]]''. Aired in 1975, this was the last television interview Lennon gave before his death in 1980.]]

While Lennon was recording ''[[Mind Games (John Lennon album)|Mind Games]]'' in 1973, he and Ono decided to separate. The ensuing 18-month period apart, which he later called his "[[The Lost Weekend (novel)|lost weekend]]",{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=698–699}} was spent in Los Angeles and New York City in the company of [[May Pang]]. ''Mind Games'', credited to the "Plastic U.F.Ono Band", was released in November 1973. Lennon also contributed "[[I'm the Greatest]]" to Starr's album ''[[Ringo (album)|Ringo]]'' (1973), released the same month. An alternate take, from the same 1973 ''Ringo'' sessions, with Lennon providing a guide vocal, appears on ''[[John Lennon Anthology]]''.

In early 1974, Lennon was drinking heavily and his alcohol-fuelled antics with [[Harry Nilsson]] made headlines. In March, two widely publicised incidents occurred at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]] club. In the first incident, Lennon stuck an unused menstrual pad on his forehead and scuffled with a waitress. The second incident occurred two weeks later, when Lennon and Nilsson were ejected from the same club after heckling the [[Smothers Brothers]].{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=927–929}} Lennon decided to produce Nilsson's album ''[[Pussy Cats]]'', and Pang rented a Los Angeles beach house for all the musicians.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=735}} After a month of further debauchery, the recording sessions were in chaos, and Lennon returned to New York with Pang to finish work on the album. In April, Lennon had produced the [[Mick Jagger]] song "Too Many Cooks (Spoil the Soup)" which was, for contractual reasons, to remain unreleased for more than 30 years. Pang supplied the recording for its eventual inclusion on ''[[The Very Best of Mick Jagger]]'' (2007).&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Very Best of Mick Jagger]]'' liner notes&lt;/ref&gt;

Lennon had settled back in New York when he recorded the album ''[[Walls and Bridges]]''. Released in October 1974, it included "[[Whatever Gets You thru the Night]]", which featured [[Elton John]] on backing vocals and piano, and became Lennon's only single as a solo artist to top the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart during his lifetime.{{sfn|Badman|2001|loc=1974}}{{Ref|fn_b|b}} A second single from the album, "[[Number 9 Dream|#9 Dream]]", followed before the end of the year. Starr's ''[[Goodnight Vienna]]'' (1974) again saw assistance from Lennon, who wrote the title track and played piano.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=284}} On 28 November, Lennon made a surprise guest appearance at Elton John's Thanksgiving concert at [[Madison Square Garden]], in fulfilment of his promise to join the singer in a live show if "Whatever Gets You thru the Night", a song whose commercial potential Lennon had doubted, reached number one. Lennon performed the song along with "[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]" and "[[I Saw Her Standing There]]", which he introduced as "a song by an old estranged fiancé of mine called Paul".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=970}}

Lennon co-wrote "[[Fame (David Bowie song)|Fame]]", [[David Bowie]]'s first US number one, and provided guitar and backing vocals for the January 1975 recording.{{sfn|The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum|1996}} In the same month, Elton John topped the charts with his cover of "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds", featuring Lennon on guitar and back-up vocals; Lennon is credited on the single under the moniker of "Dr. Winston O'Boogie". He and Ono were reunited shortly afterwards. Lennon released ''[[Rock 'n' Roll (John Lennon album)|Rock 'n' Roll]]'' (1975), an album of cover songs, in February. "[[Stand by Me (Ben E. King song)|Stand by Me]]", taken from the album and a US and UK hit, became his last single for five years.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=240, 563}} He made what would be his final stage appearance in the [[Associated TeleVision|ATV]] special ''A Salute to [[Lew Grade]]'', recorded on 18 April and televised in June.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=758}} Playing acoustic guitar and backed by an eight-piece band, Lennon performed two songs from ''Rock 'n' Roll'' ("Stand by Me", which was not broadcast, and "Slippin' and Slidin'") followed by "Imagine".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=758}} The band, known as Etc., wore masks behind their heads, a dig by Lennon, who thought Grade was two-faced.&lt;ref&gt;Madinger, ''Eight Arms to Hold You'', 44.1 Publishing, 2000, {{ISBN|0-615-11724-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1975–1980: Hiatus and return====
[[File:Lennon's Green Card.jpg|thumb|Lennon's Green Card allowing him to live and work in the United States, awarded in 1976]]
[[Sean Lennon|Sean]] was Lennon's only child with Ono. Sean was born on 9 October 1975 (Lennon's thirty-fifth birthday), and John took on the role of househusband. Lennon began what would be a five-year hiatus from the music industry, during which time he gave all his attention to his family.{{sfn|Sheff|1981}} Within the month, he fulfilled his contractual obligation to EMI/Capitol for one more album by releasing ''[[Shaved Fish]]'', a compilation album of previously recorded tracks.{{sfn|Sheff|1981}} He devoted himself to Sean, rising at 6{{nbsp}}am daily to plan and prepare his meals and to spend time with him.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=553}} He wrote "Cookin' (In the Kitchen of Love)" for Starr's ''[[Ringo's Rotogravure]]'' (1976), performing on the track in June in what would be his last recording session until 1980.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=166}} He formally announced his break from music in Tokyo in 1977, saying, "we have basically decided, without any great decision, to be with our baby as much as we can until we feel we can take time off to indulge ourselves in creating things outside of the family."{{sfn|Bennahum|1991|p=87}} During his career break he created several series of drawings, and drafted a book containing a mix of autobiographical material and what he termed "mad stuff",{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=814}} all of which would be published posthumously.

Lennon emerged from his five-year interruption in music recording in October 1980, when he released the single "[[(Just Like) Starting Over]]". The following month saw the release of ''[[Double Fantasy]]'', which contained songs written during a June 1980 journey to [[Bermuda]] on a 43-foot sailing boat.{{sfn|BBC News|2006b}} The music reflected Lennon's fulfilment in his new-found stable family life.{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=178}} Sufficient additional material was recorded for a planned follow-up album ''[[Milk and Honey (album)|Milk and Honey]]'', which was released posthumously, in 1984.{{sfn|Ginell|2009}} ''Double Fantasy'' was jointly released  by Lennon and Ono very shortly before his death;  the album was not well received and drew comments such as ''[[Melody Maker]]'''s "indulgent sterility{{nbsp}} ... a godawful yawn".{{sfn|Badman|2001|loc=1980}}

[[File:Strawberry Fields in the Central Park with The Dakota behind.jpg|thumb|right|Strawberry Fields in [[Central Park]] with the Dakota in the background]]

After an evening at the [[Record Plant]] on 8 December 1980, Lennon and Ono returned to their Manhattan apartment in a limousine at around 10:50{{nbsp}}p.m. (EST). They exited the vehicle and walked through the archway of [[The Dakota]], when lone gunman [[Mark David Chapman]] shot Lennon four times in the back at close range. Lennon was rushed in a police cruiser to the emergency room of nearby [[St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center|Roosevelt Hospital]], where he was pronounced dead on arrival at 11:00{{nbsp}}p.m. (EST).{{sfn|Ingham|2006|p=82}} Earlier that evening, Lennon had autographed a copy of ''Double Fantasy'' for Chapman.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=145}}

Ono issued a statement the next day, saying "There is no funeral for John", ending it with the words, "John loved and prayed for the human race. Please do the same for him."{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=692}} His remains were cremated at [[Ferncliff Cemetery]] in [[Hartsdale, New York]]. Ono scattered his ashes in New York's [[Central Park]], where the [[Strawberry Fields (memorial)|Strawberry Fields memorial]] was later created.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=510}} Chapman avoided going to trial when he ignored his attorney's advice and pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced to 20-years-to-life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nysdoccslookup.doccs.ny.gov/GCA00P00/WIQ3/WINQ130|title=Inmate Population Information Search|publisher=Nysdoccslookup.doccs.ny.gov|accessdate=27 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016225037/http://nysdoccslookup.doccs.ny.gov/GCA00P00/WIQ3/WINQ130|archivedate=16 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2018, he was denied parole for a 10th time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/aug/24/john-lennon-killer-mark-chapman-denied-parole-for-tenth-time | title=John Lennon's killer denied parole for 10th time | date=24 August 2018 | work=The Guardian | accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cynthia Lennon===
&lt;!-- Put in-line references into this article from books (with page numbers) or from web pages. --&gt;

Lennon met [[Cynthia Powell]] (1939–2015) in 1957, when they were fellow students at the [[Liverpool College of Art]].{{sfn|Lennon|2005|pp=17–23}} Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress [[Brigitte Bardot]], so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, "I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?"{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=21}} She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|pp=89–95}} Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=492–493}} Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song "[[Getting Better]]" told his own story, "I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically—any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace."{{sfn|Sheff|1981}}

Recalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, "There's only one thing for it Cyn. We'll have to get married."{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=91}} The couple wed on 23 August at the [[Mount Pleasant, Liverpool|Mount Pleasant]] [[Register Office]] in Liverpool, with Brian Epstein serving as best man. His marriage began just as [[Beatlemania in the United Kingdom|Beatlemania]] was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=493–495}} Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=113}}

Cynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and she felt that he slowly lost interest in her as a result of his use of the drug.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=496–497}} When the group travelled by train to [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]], Wales in 1967 for the [[Maharishi Yogi]]'s Transcendental Meditation seminar, a policeman did not recognise her and stopped her from boarding. She later recalled how the incident seemed to symbolise the end of their marriage.{{sfn|Warner Brothers|1988}} After Cynthia arrived home at [[Kenwood, St. George's Hill|Kenwood]], she found Lennon with Ono and left the house to stay with friends. [[Magic Alex|Alexis Mardas]] later claimed to have slept with her that night, and a few weeks later he informed her that Lennon was seeking a divorce and custody of Julian on the grounds of her adultery with him. After negotiations, Lennon capitulated and agreed to let her divorce him on the same grounds. The case was settled out of court in November 1968, with Lennon giving her £100,000 ($240,000 in US dollars at the time), a small annual payment and custody of Julian.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=305–306: "He had agreed that I should have custody of Julian", "He raised his offer to £100,000"}}

===Brian Epstein===

The Beatles were performing at Liverpool's [[The Cavern Club|Cavern Club]] in November 1961 when they were introduced to [[Brian Epstein]] after a midday concert. Epstein was a [[homosexual]], and according to biographer [[Philip Norman (author)|Philip Norman]], one of Brian's reasons for wanting to manage the group was that he was physically attracted to Lennon. Almost as soon as Julian was born, Lennon went on holiday to Spain with Epstein, which led to speculation about their relationship. When he was later questioned about it, Lennon said, "Well, it was almost a love affair, but not quite. It was never consummated. But it was a pretty intense relationship. It was my first experience with a homosexual that I was conscious was homosexual. We used to sit in a café in [[Torremolinos]] looking at all the boys and I'd say, 'Do you like that one? Do you like this one?' I was rather enjoying the experience, thinking like a writer all the time: I am experiencing this."{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=232}} Soon after their return from Spain, at McCartney's twenty-first birthday party in June 1963, Lennon physically attacked Cavern Club Master of ceremonies [[Bob Wooler]] for saying "How was your honeymoon, John?" The MC, known for his wordplay and affectionate but cutting remarks, was making a joke,{{sfn|Harry|2000a|pp=1165, 1169}} but ten months had passed since Lennon's marriage, and the deferred honeymoon was still two months in the future.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|pp=94, 119–120}} Lennon was drunk at the time and the matter was simple: "He called me a [[queer]] so I battered his bloody ribs in".{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=1169}}

Lennon delighted in mocking Epstein for his homosexuality and for the fact that he was Jewish.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=232}} When Epstein invited suggestions for the title of his autobiography, Lennon offered ''Queer Jew''; on learning of the eventual title, ''[[A Cellarful of Noise]]'', he parodied, "More like ''A Cellarful of Boys''".{{sfn|Coleman|1992|pp=298–299}} He demanded of a visitor to Epstein's flat, "Have you come to blackmail him? If not, you're the only bugger in London who hasn't."{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=232}} During the recording of "[[Baby, You're a Rich Man]]", he sang altered choruses of "Baby, you're a rich fag Jew".{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=503}}{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=206}}

===Julian Lennon===

[[File:Julian Lennon.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Julian Lennon]] at the unveiling of the [[John Lennon Peace Monument]] in Liverpool, October 2010]]

During his marriage to Cynthia, Lennon's first son [[Julian Lennon|Julian]] was born at the same time that his commitments with the Beatles were intensifying at the height of [[Beatlemania in the United Kingdom|Beatlemania]]. Lennon was touring with the Beatles when Julian was born on 8 April 1963. Julian's birth, like his mother Cynthia's marriage to Lennon, was kept secret because Epstein was convinced that public knowledge of such things would threaten the Beatles' commercial success. Julian recalled that as a small child in [[Weybridge]] some four years later, "I was trundled home from school and came walking up with one of my watercolour paintings. It was just a bunch of stars and this blonde girl I knew at school. And Dad said, 'What's this?' I said, 'It's Lucy in the sky with diamonds.'"{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=517}} Lennon used it as the title of a [[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds|Beatles song]], and though it was later reported to have been derived from the initials [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], Lennon insisted, "It's not an acid song."{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=574}} McCartney corroborated Lennon's explanation that Julian innocently came up with the name.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=574}} Lennon was distant from Julian, who felt closer to McCartney than to his father. During a car journey to visit Cynthia and Julian during Lennon's divorce, McCartney composed a song, "Hey Jules", to comfort him. It would evolve into the Beatles song "[[Hey Jude]]". Lennon later said, "That's his best song. It started off as a song about my son Julian{{nbsp}} ... he turned it into 'Hey Jude'. I always thought it was about me and Yoko but he said it wasn't."{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=341}}

Lennon's relationship with Julian was already strained, and after Lennon and Ono moved to Manhattan in 1971, Julian would not see his father again until 1973.{{sfn|Pang|2008|loc=back cover}} With Pang's encouragement, arrangements were made for Julian (and his mother) to visit Lennon in Los Angeles, where they went to [[Disneyland]].{{sfn|Lennon|2005|pp=252–255}} Julian started to see his father regularly, and Lennon gave him a drumming part on a ''[[Walls and Bridges]]'' track.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=258}} He bought Julian a [[Gibson Les Paul]] guitar and other instruments, and encouraged his interest in music by demonstrating guitar chord techniques.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=258}} Julian recalls that he and his father "got on a great deal better" during the time he spent in New York: "We had a lot of fun, laughed a lot and had a great time in general."{{sfn|Times Online|2009}}

In a ''Playboy'' interview with David Sheff shortly before his death, Lennon said, "Sean was a planned child, and therein lies the difference. I don't love Julian any less as a child. He's still my son, whether he came from a bottle of whiskey or because they didn't have pills in those days. He's here, he belongs to me, and he always will." He said he was trying to reestablish a connection with the then 17-year-old, and confidently predicted, "Julian and I will have a relationship in the future."{{sfn|Sheff|1981}} After his death it was revealed that he had left Julian very little in his will.{{sfn|Badman|2003|p=393}}

[[File:Lennons by Jack Mitchell.jpg|thumb|right|Lennon and [[Yoko Ono]] in 1980, the year John Lennon was murdered.]]
Two versions exist of how Lennon met [[Yoko Ono]]. According to the first, told by the Lennons, on 9 November 1966 Lennon went to the [[Indica Gallery]] in London, where Ono was preparing her conceptual art exhibit, and they were introduced by gallery owner [[John Dunbar (artist)|John Dunbar]].{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=682}} Lennon was intrigued by Ono's "Hammer A Nail": patrons hammered a nail into a wooden board, creating the art piece. Although the exhibition had not yet begun, Lennon wanted to hammer a nail into the clean board, but Ono stopped him. Dunbar asked her, "Don't you know who this is? He's a millionaire! He might buy it." Ono had supposedly not heard of the Beatles, but relented on condition that Lennon pay her five [[wikt:shilling|shillings]], to which Lennon replied, "I'll give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer an imaginary nail in."{{sfn|Sheff|1981}} Ono subsequently related that Lennon had taken a bite out of the apple on display in her work ''[[Apple (artwork)|Apple]]'', much to her fury.&lt;ref name='MOMA'&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple. Yoko Ono. 1966.|url=https://www.moma.org/audio/playlist/15/368|publisher=Museum of Modern Art|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second version, told by McCartney, is that in late 1965, Ono was in London compiling original musical scores for a book [[John Cage]] was working on, ''[[Notations]]'', but McCartney declined to give her any of his own manuscripts for the book, suggesting that Lennon might oblige. When asked, Lennon gave Ono the original handwritten lyrics to "[[The Word (song)|The Word]]".{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=272}}

Ono began visiting and telephoning Lennon's home and, when his wife asked him for an explanation, Lennon explained that Ono was only trying to obtain money for her "avant-garde bullshit".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=683}} While his wife was on holiday in Greece in May 1968, Lennon invited Ono to visit. They spent the night recording what would become the ''[[Two Virgins]]'' album, after which, he said, they "made love at dawn."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Two Virgins]]'' liner notes&lt;/ref&gt; When Lennon's wife returned home she found Ono wearing her bathrobe and drinking tea with Lennon who simply said, "Oh, hi."{{sfn|Lennon|1978|p=183}} Ono became pregnant in 1968 and miscarried a male child on 21 November 1968,{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=510}} a few weeks after Lennon's divorce from Cynthia was granted.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=800}}

Two years before the Beatles disbanded, Lennon and Ono began public protests against the [[Vietnam War]]. They were married in [[Gibraltar]] on 20 March 1969,{{sfn|Coleman|1992|p=705}} and spent their honeymoon at the [[Hilton Amsterdam]], campaigning with a week-long [[Bed-In|Bed-In for Peace]]. They planned another Bed-In in the United States, but were denied entry,{{sfn|Kruse|2009|p=16}} so held one instead at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hotel]] in Montreal, where they recorded "[[Give Peace a Chance]]".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=276}} They often combined advocacy with performance art, as in their "[[Bagism]]", first introduced during a Vienna press conference. Lennon detailed this period in the Beatles song "[[The Ballad of John and Yoko]]".{{sfn|Coleman|1992|p=550}} Lennon changed his name by [[deed poll]] on 22 April 1969, adding "Ono" as a middle name. The brief ceremony took place on the roof of the [[Apple Corps]] building, made famous three months earlier by the Beatles' ''[[Let It Be]]'' [[The Beatles' rooftop concert|rooftop concert]]. Although he used the name John Ono Lennon thereafter, official documents referred to him as John Winston Ono Lennon, since he was not permitted to revoke a name given at birth.{{sfn|Coleman|1984b|p=64}} The couple settled at [[Tittenhurst Park]] at [[Sunninghill, Berkshire|Sunninghill]] in [[Berkshire]].{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=615 et seq}} After Ono was injured in a car accident, Lennon arranged for a king-sized bed to be brought to the recording studio as he worked on the Beatles' last album, ''[[Abbey Road]]''.{{sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|pp=279–280}} To escape the acrimony of the band's break-up, Ono suggested they move permanently to Manhattan, which they did on 31 August 1971.

They first lived in [[The St. Regis Hotel]] on 5th&amp;nbsp;Avenue, East [[55th Street (Manhattan)|55th Street]], then moved to a street-level flat at 105&amp;nbsp;[[Bank Street (Manhattan)|Bank Street]], [[Greenwich Village]], on 16 October 1971. After a robbery, they relocated in 1973 to the more secure [[The Dakota|Dakota]] at 1{{nbsp}}West{{nbsp}}[[72nd Street (Manhattan)|72nd Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/07/nyregion/07appraisal.html|title=Sharing the Dakota With John Lennon|work=NYTimes.com|date=6 December 2010|accessdate=19 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320060102/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/07/nyregion/07appraisal.html|archivedate=20 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===May Pang===
&lt;!-- Put in-line references into this article from books (with page numbers) or from web pages. --&gt;

[[File:May Pang 2002.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.60|alt=Profile picture of a bespectacled Asian woman in her early fifties. She has long red hair, and shows a toothy smile.|[[May Pang]]]]

ABKCO Industries was formed in 1968 by [[Allen Klein]] as an umbrella company to [[ABKCO Records]]. Klein hired [[May Pang]] as a receptionist in 1969. Through involvement in a project with ABKCO, Lennon and Ono met her the following year. She became their personal assistant. After she had been working with the couple for three years, Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged. She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, "He likes you a lot." Pang, 22, astounded by Ono's proposition, eventually agreed to become Lennon's companion. The pair soon moved to California, beginning an 18-month period he later called his "[[May Pang#"Lost Weekend"|lost weekend]]".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=698–699}} In Los Angeles, Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian, whom he had not seen for two years. He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles roadie [[Mal Evans]], and [[Harry Nilsson]]. While Lennon was drinking with Nilsson, he misunderstood something that Pang had said and attempted to strangle her. Lennon relented only after he was physically restrained by Nilsson.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=700}}

When Lennon and Pang returned to their newly rented Manhattan apartment, they prepared a spare room for Julian when he visited them.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=700}}  Lennon, who had been inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends.  By December, he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he refused to accept Ono's telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. Lennon told Pang that his separation from Ono was now over, although Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his [[mistress (lover)|mistress]].{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=700–701}}

===Sean Lennon===

Ono had previously suffered three [[miscarriage]]s in her attempt to have a child with Lennon. When Ono and Lennon were reunited, she became pregnant. She initially said that she wanted to have an abortion but changed her mind and agreed to allow the pregnancy to continue on condition that Lennon adopt the role of [[househusband]], which he agreed to do.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=535, 690}} Following Sean's birth, Lennon's subsequent hiatus from the music industry would span five years. He had a photographer take pictures of Sean every day of his first year and created numerous drawings for him, which were posthumously published as ''Real Love: The Drawings for Sean''. Lennon later proudly declared, "He didn't come out of my belly but, by God, I made his bones, because I've attended to every meal, and to how he sleeps, and to the fact that he swims like a fish."{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=535}}

===Former Beatles===
{{Further|Collaborations between ex-Beatles|Paul McCartney|George Harrison|Ringo Starr}}

[[File:The Beatles in America.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Black-and-white picture of four young men outdoors in front of a staircase, surrounded by a large assembled crowd. All four are waving to the crowd.|Lennon (left) and the rest of the Beatles [[The Beatles#"British Invasion"|arriving in New York City in 1964]]]]

While Lennon and Starr remained consistently friendly during the years that followed the Beatles' break-up in 1970, his relationships with McCartney and Harrison varied. He was initially close to Harrison, but the two drifted apart after Lennon moved to Manhattan in 1971. When Harrison was in New York for his December 1974 ''[[Dark Horse (George Harrison album)|Dark Horse]]'' tour, Lennon agreed to join him on stage, but failed to appear after an argument over Lennon's refusal to sign an agreement that would finally dissolve the Beatles' legal partnership. Lennon eventually signed the papers while he was on holiday in Florida with Pang and Julian.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=195}} Harrison offended Lennon in 1980 when he published an autobiography that made little mention of him.{{sfn|Tillery|2011|p=121}} Lennon told ''[[Playboy]]'', "I was hurt by it. By glaring omission{{nbsp}} ... my influence on his life is absolutely zilch{{nbsp}} ... he remembers every two-bit sax player or guitarist he met in subsequent years. I'm not in the book."{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=327}}

Lennon's most intense feelings were reserved for McCartney. In addition to attacking him with the lyrics of "[[How Do You Sleep? (John Lennon song)|How Do You Sleep?]]", Lennon argued with him through the press for three years after the group split. The two later began to reestablish something of the close friendship they had once known, and in 1974, they even played music together again before eventually growing apart once more. During McCartney's final visit in April 1976, Lennon said that they watched the episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in which [[Lorne Michaels]] made a $3,000 cash offer to get the Beatles to reunite on the show.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=934–935}} The pair considered going to the studio to make a joke appearance, attempting to claim their share of the money, but were too tired.{{sfn|Sheff|1981}} Lennon summarised his feelings towards McCartney in an interview three days before his death: "Throughout my career, I've selected to work with{{nbsp}} ... only two people: Paul McCartney and Yoko Ono{{nbsp}} ... That ain't bad picking."{{sfn|Cohn|2010–2011|p=95}}

Along with his estrangement from McCartney, Lennon always felt a musical competitiveness with him and kept an ear on his music. During his career break from 1980 until shortly before his death, Lennon was content to sit back as long as McCartney was producing what Lennon saw as mediocre material.{{sfn|Seaman|1991|p=122}} Lennon took notice when McCartney released "[[Coming Up (song)|Coming Up]]" in 1980, which was the year Lennon returned to the studio. "It's driving me crackers!" he jokingly complained, because he could not get the tune out of his head.{{sfn|Seaman|1991|p=122}} That same year, Lennon was asked whether the group were dreaded enemies or the best of friends, and he replied that they were neither, and that he had not seen any of them in a long time. But he also said, "I still love those guys. The Beatles are over, but John, Paul, George and Ringo go on."{{sfn|Sheff|1981}}

In the foreground of the image are three men, one of them a guitarist facing away, and a woman.|Recording "Give Peace a Chance" during the [[Bed-In|Bed-In for Peace]] at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hotel]], Montreal]]

Lennon and Ono used their [[honeymoon]] as a [[Bed-In|Bed-In for Peace]] at the [[Amsterdam Hilton Hotel]]; the March 1969 event attracted worldwide media ridicule.{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=337: "They were ridiculed by the world's media"}}{{sfn|Anderson|2010|p=83: "The Bed-In stunt was ridiculed by the press"}} During a second Bed-In three months later at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal,{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=745–748}} Lennon wrote and recorded "Give Peace a Chance". Released as a single, the song was quickly interpreted as an anti-war anthem and sung by a quarter of a million demonstrators against the [[Vietnam War]] in Washington,&amp;nbsp;DC, on 15 November, the second [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam|Vietnam Moratorium Day]].{{sfn|Perone|2001|pp=57–58}}{{sfn|Holsinger|1999|p=389}} In December, they paid for billboards in 10 cities around the world which declared, in the national language, "War Is Over! If You Want It".&lt;ref&gt;"John Lennons Convey Greetings via Billboards" ''The New York Times'' 16 December 1969: 54&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, Lennon and Ono supported efforts by the family of [[James Hanratty]] to prove his innocence.{{sfn|Wenner|2000|p=43}} Hanratty had been hanged in 1962. According to Lennon, those who had condemned Hanratty were "the same people who are running guns to South Africa and killing blacks in the streets.&amp;nbsp;... The same bastards are in control, the same people are running everything, it's the whole bullshit bourgeois scene."{{sfn|Clark|2002}} In London, Lennon and Ono staged a "Britain Murdered Hanratty" banner march and a "Silent Protest For James Hanratty",{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=362}} and produced a 40-minute documentary on the case. At an [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|appeal hearing]] years later, Hanratty's conviction was upheld after [[DNA evidence]] matched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/1980731.stm|title=Hanratty: The damning DNA|publisher=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=27 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140405134202/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/1980731.stm|archivedate=5 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lennon and Ono showed their solidarity with the [[Clydeside]] [[Upper Clyde Shipbuilders|UCS]] workers' [[work-in]] of 1971 by sending a bouquet of red roses and a cheque for £5,000.{{sfn|McGinty|2010}} On moving to New York City in August that year, they befriended two of the [[Chicago Seven]], [[Youth International Party|Yippie]] peace activists [[Jerry Rubin]] and [[Abbie Hoffman]].{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=344}} Another political activist, [[John Sinclair (poet)|John Sinclair]], poet and co-founder of the [[White Panther Party]], was serving ten years in prison for selling two [[Joint (cannabis)|joints]] of marijuana after previous convictions for possession of the drug.{{sfn|Buchanan|2009}} In December 1971 at [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], 15,000 people attended the "[[John Sinclair Freedom Rally]]", a protest and benefit concert with contributions from Lennon, [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Bob Seger]], [[Bobby Seale]] of the [[Black Panther Party]], and others.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=789–790, 812–813}} Lennon and Ono, backed by [[David Peel (musician)|David Peel]] and Rubin, performed an acoustic set of four songs from their forthcoming ''Some Time in New York City'' album including "John Sinclair", whose lyrics called for his release. The day before the rally, the [[Michigan Senate]] passed a bill that significantly reduced the penalties for possession of marijuana and four days later Sinclair was released on an appeal bond.{{sfn|Glenn|2009}} The performance was recorded and two of the tracks later appeared on ''[[John Lennon Anthology]]'' (1998).{{sfn|Calkin|2002}}

Following the ''[[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]]'' incident in [[Northern Ireland]] in 1972, in which fourteen unarmed [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association|civil rights protesters]] were shot dead by the British Army, Lennon said that given the choice between the army and the [[Official Irish Republican Army|IRA]] (who were not involved in the incident) he would side with the latter. Lennon and Ono wrote two songs protesting British presence and actions in Ireland for their ''Some Time in New York City'' album: "[[The Luck of the Irish (song)|The Luck of the Irish]]" and "[[Sunday Bloody Sunday (John Lennon and Yoko Ono song)|Sunday Bloody Sunday]]". In 2000, [[David Shayler]], a former member of Britain's domestic security service MI5, suggested that Lennon had given money to the IRA, though this was swiftly denied by Ono.{{sfn|Bright|2000}} Biographer Bill Harry records that following Bloody Sunday, Lennon and Ono financially supported the production of the film ''The Irish Tapes'', a political documentary with a [[Irish republicanism|Republican]] slant.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=403}}

According to FBI surveillance reports, and confirmed by [[Tariq Ali]] in 2006, Lennon was sympathetic to the [[International Marxist Group]], a [[Trotskyist]] group formed in Britain in 1968.{{sfn|Ali|2006}} However, the FBI considered Lennon to have limited effectiveness as a revolutionary, as he was "constantly under the influence of narcotics".{{sfn|Brooks|2005}}

In 1973, Lennon contributed a limerick called "Why Make It Sad To Be Gay?" to Len Richmond's ''The Gay Liberation Book''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Richmond|first=Len|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5806324-the-gay-liberation-book|title=The gay liberation book by Len Richmond – Reviews, Discussion, Bookclubs, Lists|publisher=Goodreads.com|accessdate=4 May 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205084434/http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5806324-the-gay-liberation-book|archivedate=5 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lennon's last act of political activism was a statement in support of the striking minority sanitation workers in San Francisco on 5 December 1980. He and Ono planned to join the workers' protest on 14 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crowdog89.tumblr.com/post/42004051247/john-lennons-last-public-political-statement|title=John Lennon's last public political statement. – Dynamic Tension|publisher=Crowdog89.tumblr.com|accessdate=4 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105001018/http://crowdog89.tumblr.com/post/42004051247/john-lennons-last-public-political-statement|archivedate=5 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lennon's former personal assistant Fred Seaman, who had earlier been convicted for, and admitted, stealing from Lennon's personal belongings, has claimed that by this time, however, Lennon had quietly renounced the counterculture views which he had helped promote during the 1960s and 1970s and become more aligned with [[conservatism]] and was supportive of [[Ronald Reagan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/06/30/reports-of-john-lennon-s-conservatism-greatly-exaggerated.html|title=Was John Lennon Conservative?|newspaper=The Daily Beast|accessdate=27 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905075449/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/06/30/reports-of-john-lennon-s-conservatism-greatly-exaggerated.html|archivedate=5 September 2014|df=dmy-all|date=2011-06-30|last1=Romano|first1=Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.john-lennon.com/playboyinterviewwithjohnlennonandyokoono.htm|title=1980 ''Playboy'' Interview With John Lennon And Yoko Ono|publisher=John-lennon.com|accessdate=27 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815092712/http://www.john-lennon.com/playboyinterviewwithjohnlennonandyokoono.htm|archivedate=15 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; though whether Lennon had actually aligned to a more conservative world view is disputed.

===Deportation attempt===
&lt;!-- Put in-line references into this article from books (with page numbers) or from web pages. --&gt;

Following the impact of "Give Peace a Chance" and "[[Happy Xmas (War Is Over)]]", both of which songs were strongly associated with the anti-Vietnam War movement, the Nixon administration heard rumours of Lennon's involvement in a concert to be held in San Diego at the same time as the [[Republican National Convention]] and{{sfn|Wiener|1999|p=2}} tried to have him deported. Nixon believed that Lennon's anti-war activities could cost him his reelection;{{sfn|BBC News|2000}} Republican Senator [[Strom Thurmond]] suggested in a February 1972 memo that "deportation would be a strategic counter-measure" against Lennon.{{sfn|Wiener|1990|p=225}} The next month the United States [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] (INS) began deportation proceedings, arguing that his 1968 misdemeanour conviction for cannabis possession in London had made him ineligible for admission to the United States. Lennon spent the next three and a half years in and out of deportation hearings until 8 October 1975, when a court of appeals barred the deportation attempt, stating "the courts will not condone selective deportation based upon secret political grounds".{{sfn|Coleman|1992|pp=576–583}}{{sfn|BBC News|2006a}} While the legal battle continued, Lennon attended rallies and made television appearances. Lennon and Ono co-hosted ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'' for a week in February 1972, introducing guests such as [[Jerry Rubin]] and [[Bobby Seale]] to mid-America.{{sfn|BBC News|2006c}} In 1972, [[Bob Dylan]] wrote a letter to the INS defending Lennon, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;John and Yoko add a great voice and drive to the country's so-called art institution. They inspire and transcend and stimulate and by doing so, only help others to see pure light and in doing that, put an end to this dull taste of petty commercialism which is being passed off as Artist Art by the overpowering mass media. Hurray for John and Yoko. Let them stay and live here and breathe. The country's got plenty of room and space. Let John and Yoko stay!&lt;ref&gt;Wiener, Jon.

On 23 March 1973, Lennon was ordered to leave the US within 60 days.{{sfn|Wiener|1999|p=326}} Ono, meanwhile, was granted permanent residence. In response, Lennon and Ono held a press conference on 1 April 1973 at the [[New York City Bar Association]], where they announced the formation of the state of [[Nutopia]]; a place with "no land, no boundaries, no passports, only people".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=663}} Waving the white flag of Nutopia (two handkerchiefs), they asked for political asylum in the US. The press conference was filmed, and appeared in 2006 documentary ''[[The US vs. John Lennon]]''.{{sfn|Urish|Bielen|2007|p=143}} Lennon's ''[[Mind Games (John Lennon album)|Mind Games]]'' (1973) included the track "Nutopian International Anthem", which comprised three seconds of silence.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=664}} Soon after the press conference, Nixon's involvement in a political scandal came to light, and in June the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] hearings began in Washington, DC. They led to the president's resignation 14 months later. Nixon's successor, [[Gerald Ford]], showed little interest in continuing the battle against Lennon, and the deportation order was overturned in 1975. The following year, Lennon received his [[United States Permanent Resident Card|"green card"]] certifying his [[permanent residency]], and when [[Jimmy Carter]] was inaugurated as president in January 1977, Lennon and Ono attended the Inaugural Ball.{{sfn|Coleman|1984a|p=289}}

After Lennon's death, historian [[Jon Wiener]] filed a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request for [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] files that documented the Bureau's role in the deportation attempt.{{sfn|Wiener|1999|p=13}} The FBI admitted it had 281 pages of files on Lennon, but refused to release most of them on the grounds that they contained national security information. In 1983, Wiener sued the FBI with the help of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] of [[Southern California]]. It took 14 years of litigation to force the FBI to release the withheld pages.{{sfn|Friedman|2005|p=252}} The ACLU, representing Wiener, won a favourable decision in their suit against the FBI in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] in 1991.{{sfn|Wiener|1999|p=315}} The [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] appealed the decision to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in April 1992, but the court declined to review the case.{{sfn|Wiener|1999|pp=52–54, 76}} In 1997, respecting President [[Bill Clinton]]'s newly instigated rule that documents should be withheld only if releasing them would involve "foreseeable harm", the Justice Department settled most of the outstanding issues outside court by releasing all but 10 of the contested documents.{{sfn|Wiener|1999|pp=52–54, 76}}

Wiener published the results of his 14-year campaign in January 2000. ''Gimme Some Truth: The John Lennon FBI Files'' contained facsimiles of the documents, including "lengthy reports by confidential informants detailing the daily lives of anti-war activists, memos to the White House, transcripts of TV shows on which Lennon appeared, and a proposal that Lennon be arrested by local police on drug charges".{{sfn|Wiener|1999|p=27}} The story is told in the documentary ''The US vs. John Lennon''. The final 10 documents in Lennon's FBI file, which reported on his ties with London anti-war activists in 1971 and had been withheld as containing "national security information provided by a foreign government under an explicit promise of confidentiality", were released in December 2006. They contained no indication that the British government had regarded Lennon as a serious threat; one example of the released material was a report that two prominent British leftists had hoped Lennon would finance a left-wing bookshop and reading room.{{sfn|The Associated Press|2006}}

==Writing and art==
&lt;!-- Put in-line references into this article from books (with page numbers) or from web pages. --&gt;

Beatles biographer [[Bill Harry]] wrote that Lennon began drawing and writing creatively at an early age with the encouragement of his uncle. He collected his stories, poetry, cartoons and caricatures in a Quarry Bank High School exercise book that he called the ''Daily Howl''. The drawings were often of crippled people, and the writings satirical, and throughout the book was an abundance of wordplay. According to classmate Bill Turner, Lennon created the ''Daily Howl'' to amuse his best friend and later Quarrymen bandmate [[Pete Shotton]], to whom he would show his work before he let anyone else see it. Turner said that Lennon "had an obsession for [[Wigan Pier]]. It kept cropping up", and in Lennon's story ''A Carrot in a Potato Mine'', "the mine was at the end of Wigan Pier." Turner described how one of Lennon's cartoons depicted a bus stop sign annotated with the question, "Why?". Above was a flying pancake, and below, "a blind man wearing glasses leading along a blind dog—also wearing glasses".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=179–181}}

Lennon's love of wordplay and nonsense with a twist found a wider audience when he was 24. Harry writes that ''[[In His Own Write]]'' (1964) was published after "Some journalist who was hanging around the Beatles came to me and I ended up showing him the stuff. They said, 'Write a book' and that's how the first one came about". Like the ''Daily Howl'' it contained a mix of formats including short stories, poetry, plays and drawings. One story, "Good Dog Nigel", tells the tale of "a happy dog, [[raised-leg urination|urinating on a lamp post]], barking, wagging his tail—until he suddenly hears a message that he will be killed at three o'clock". ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' considered the poems and stories "remarkable&amp;nbsp;... also very funny&amp;nbsp;... the nonsense runs on, words and images prompting one another in a chain of pure fantasy". ''Book Week'' reported, "This is nonsense writing, but one has only to review the [[Literary nonsense|literature of nonsense]] to see how well Lennon has brought it off. While some of his homonyms are gratuitous word play, many others have not only double meaning but a double edge." Lennon was not only surprised by the positive reception, but that the book was reviewed at all, and suggested that readers "took the book more seriously than I did myself. It just began as a laugh for me".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=393–394}}

In combination with ''[[A Spaniard in the Works]]'' (1965), ''In His Own Write'' formed the basis of the stage play ''The John Lennon Play: In His Own Write'', co-adapted by [[Victor Spinetti]] and [[Adrienne Kennedy]]. After negotiations between Lennon, Spinetti and the artistic director of the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], [[Laurence Olivier|Sir Laurence Olivier]], the play opened at [[The Old Vic]] in 1968. Lennon and Ono attended the opening night performance, their second public appearance together.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=396–397}} In 1969, Lennon wrote "Four in Hand", a skit based on his teenage experiences of [[Circle jerk (sexual practice)|group masturbation]], for [[Kenneth Tynan]]'s play ''[[Oh! Calcutta!]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.specialsections.absoluteelsewhere.net/LennonLoreLegacy/oh_calcutta.html|title=Oh! Calcutta!|publisher=specialsections.absoluteelsewhere.net|accessdate=2 January 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150401000506/http://specialsections.absoluteelsewhere.net/LennonLoreLegacy/oh_calcutta.html|archivedate=1 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Lennon's death, further works were published, including ''[[Skywriting by Word of Mouth]]'' (1986), ''Ai: Japan Through John Lennon's Eyes: A Personal Sketchbook'' (1992), with Lennon's illustrations of the definitions of Japanese words, and ''Real Love: The Drawings for Sean'' (1999). ''[[The Beatles Anthology]]'' (2000) also presented examples of his writings and drawings.

==Musicianship==

===Instruments played===
{{Further|John Lennon's musical instruments|List of the Beatles' instruments}}

[[File:John Lennon's Les Paul Jr..jpg|thumb|upright|Lennon's [[Gibson Les Paul Junior|Les Paul Jr.]]]]

Lennon played a mouth organ during a bus journey to visit his cousin in Scotland; the music caught the driver's ear. Impressed, the driver told Lennon of a harmonica he could have if he came to Edinburgh the following day, where one had been stored in the bus depot since a passenger left it on a bus.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=313}} The professional instrument quickly replaced Lennon's toy. He would continue to play harmonica, often using the instrument during the Beatles' Hamburg years, and it became a signature sound in the group's early recordings. His mother taught him how to play the banjo, later buying him an acoustic guitar. At 16, he played rhythm guitar with the Quarrymen.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=738–740}}

As his career progressed, he played a variety of electric guitars, predominantly the [[Rickenbacker 325]], [[Epiphone Casino]] and [[Gibson J-160E]], and, from the start of his solo career, the [[Gibson Les Paul Junior]].{{sfn|Prown and Newquist|2003|p=213}}{{sfn|Lawrence|2009|p=27}} ''[[Double Fantasy]]'' producer Jack Douglas claimed that since his Beatle days Lennon habitually tuned his D-string slightly flat, so his Aunt Mimi could tell which guitar was his on recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Steve |last=Appleford |title=Yoko Ono Discusses New John Lennon Documentary |work=Rolling Stone |date=6 August 2010 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/yoko-ono-discusses-new-john-lennon-documentary-20100806#ixzz2myfyJ4yY |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614163611/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/yoko-ono-discusses-new-john-lennon-documentary-20100806#ixzz2myfyJ4yY |archivedate=14 June 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally he played a six-string bass guitar, the [[Fender Bass VI]], providing bass on some Beatles numbers ("[[Back in the U.S.S.R.]]", "[[The Long and Winding Road]]", "[[Helter Skelter (song)|Helter Skelter"]]) that occupied McCartney with another instrument.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=297}} His other instrument of choice was the piano, on which he composed many songs, including "Imagine", described as his best-known solo work.{{sfn|Blaney|2005|p=83}} His jamming on a piano with McCartney in 1963 led to the creation of the Beatles' first US number one, "[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]".{{sfn|Everett|2001|p=200}} In 1964, he became one of the first British musicians to acquire a [[Mellotron]] keyboard, though it was not heard on a Beatles recording until "Strawberry Fields Forever" in 1967.{{sfn|Babiuk|2002|pp=164–165}}

===Vocal style===
When the Beatles recorded "[[Twist and Shout]]", the final track during the mammoth one-day session that produced the band's 1963 debut album, ''[[Please Please Me]]'', Lennon's voice, already compromised by a cold, came close to giving out. Lennon said, "I couldn't sing the damn thing, I was just screaming."{{sfn|Wenner|2000|p=14}} In the words of biographer Barry Miles, "Lennon simply shredded his vocal cords in the interests of rock 'n' roll."{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=90}} The Beatles' producer, [[George Martin]], tells how Lennon "had an inborn dislike of his own voice which I could never understand. He was always saying to me: 'DO something with my voice!{{nbsp}} ... put something on it{{nbsp}} ... Make it ''different''.'"{{sfn|Coleman|1992|pp=369–370}} Martin obliged, often using [[double tracking|double-tracking]] and other techniques.

As his Beatles era segued into his solo career, his singing voice found a widening range of expression. Biographer Chris Gregory writes of Lennon "tentatively beginning to expose his insecurities in a number of acoustic-led 'confessional' ballads, so beginning the process of 'public therapy' that will eventually culminate in the primal screams of "[[Cold Turkey]]" and the cathartic ''[[John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band]]''."{{sfn|Gregory|2007|p=75}} Music critic Robert Christgau calls this Lennon's "greatest vocal performance{{nbsp}} ... from scream to whine, is modulated electronically{{nbsp}} ... echoed, filtered, and double tracked."{{sfn|Wiener|1990|p=143}} David Stuart Ryan notes Lennon's vocal delivery to range from "extreme vulnerability, sensitivity and even naivety" to a hard "rasping" style.{{sfn|Ryan|1982|pp=118, 241}} Wiener too describes contrasts, saying the singer's voice can be "at first subdued; soon it almost cracks with despair".{{sfn|Wiener|1990|p=35}} Music historian Ben Urish recalls hearing the Beatles' ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show|Ed Sullivan Show]]'' performance of "[[This Boy]]" played on the radio a few days after Lennon's murder: "As Lennon's vocals reached their peak{{nbsp}} ... it hurt too much to hear him scream with such anguish and emotion. But it was my emotions I heard in his voice. Just like I always had."{{sfn|Urish|Bielen|2007|p=123}}

Music historians Schinder and Schwartz wrote of the transformation in popular music styles that took place between the 1950s and the 1960s. They said that the Beatles' influence cannot be overstated: having "revolutionised the sound, style, and attitude of popular music and opened rock and roll's doors to a tidal wave of British rock acts", the group then "spent the rest of the 1960s expanding rock's stylistic frontiers".{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=160}} [[Liam Gallagher]] and his group [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] were among the many who acknowledged the band's influence; he identified Lennon as a hero. In 1999, he named his first child Lennon Gallagher in tribute.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=265}} On [[National Poetry Month#International Poetry Celebrations|National Poetry Day]] in 1999, the BBC conducted a poll to identify the UK's favourite song lyric and announced "Imagine" as the winner.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=382–383}}

In a 2006 ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' article, Jon Wiener wrote: "For young people in 1972, it was thrilling to see Lennon's courage in standing up to [US President] Nixon. That willingness to take risks with his career, and his life, is one reason why people still admire him today."{{sfn|Wiener|2006}} For music historians Urish and Bielen, Lennon's most significant effort was "the self-portraits&amp;nbsp;... in his songs [which] spoke to, for, and about, the human condition."{{sfn|Urish|Bielen|2007|pp=121–122}}

In 2013, [[Downtown Music Publishing]] signed a publishing administration agreement for the US with Lenono Music and Ono Music, home to the song catalogues of John Lennon and [[Yoko Ono]] respectively.

'''Joshua Meyer''' (born 1974, [[Lubbock, Texas]], United States)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dolbychadwickgallery.com/artists/joshua-meyer/exhibitions|title=Joshua Meyer - Dolby Chadwick Gallery|publisher=Dolbychadwickgallery.com|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American artist, based in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. He earned his B.A. from [[Yale School of Art|Yale University]] and also studied at the [[Bezalel Academy]] in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://art.state.gov/artistdetail.aspx?id=100564|title=U.S. Department of State - Art in Embassies|publisher=Art.state.gov|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is known for his oil paintings of people, and for a searching process by which they emerge, trail off, wander, get lost, experiment and reemerge.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;''Tohu vaVohu: Hebrew College presents paintings by Joshua Meyer,'' catalog, essay by Dr. Steve Copeland (Hebrew College), June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; This searching quality is characterized by a thick texture in many of his paintings, influenced by [[Alberto Giacometti]], [[Frank Auerbach]], and [[Rembrandt van Rijn]]. Every painting emerges from struggle and re-evaluation.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;''Becoming, ''catalog, essay by Dr. Sharrona Pearl (Yale Slifka Center and NYU Bronfman Center), May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist's work has been shown in galleries and museums across the United States, Europe and Asia, including a solo exhibition, ''Tohu vaVohu'' &lt;ref&gt;Community Newspapers of Massachusetts, ''The "Commanding Vision" of Joshua Meyer'', June 24, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Hebrew College]] in Boston (2004), and ''Becoming''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;New Haven Register, ''Heavily textured 'Becoming' draws from primitive energy'', Judy Birke, May 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; (2006) at the [[Yale Slifka Center]] and [[NYU Bronfman Center]]. “Commanding visions,” emerge from the midst of Meyer’s thickly layered paint, according to Hebrew College Professor Steven Copeland in the introduction to the 2004 ''Tohu vaVohu'' catalog. “He engages...fateful questions concerning the character of art and of Judaism, their possibilities, challenges and problems.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Meyer’s subjects play a hide-and-seek game with the viewer, often dissolving into the paint. According to [[Allegra Goodman]], in the introduction to the 2013 exhibition catalog ''Rustle, Sparkle, Flutter, Float,'' these people “will reveal themselves, and they will disappear. Look at them up close and they scatter, self-effacing.” The figures are elusive and appear introspective. “Some artists try to depict our world. Meyer presents people in their own worlds, and invites us to enter.”&lt;ref&gt;''Rustle, Sparkle, Flutter, Float,'' exhibition catalog, essays by Allegra Goodman and Frances Malcolm (Dolby Chadwick Gallery), November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meyer is a recipient of a [[Pollock-Krasner Foundation]] Grant as well as the [[Sustainable Arts Foundation]] Award, and a 2010 Painting Fellowship from the [[Massachusetts Cultural Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artsake.massculturalcouncil.org/blog/artsake/index.php/2010/06/25/nano-interview-with-joshua-meyer/|title=ArtSake|publisher=Artsake.massculturalcouncil.org|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meyer’s work has been written up in The San Francisco Chronicle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2010/12/02/NS381GH3PO.DTL|title='Everything in Between': Joshua Meyer paintings|work=SFGate|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Forward,&lt;ref&gt;The Forward, ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'Paintings That Hang in the Balance,'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' Renee Ghert-Zand, January 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Philadelphia Metro,&lt;ref&gt;The Philadelphia Metro, ''The Knives Have It'', Dorothy Robinson, May 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; New Haven Register,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Art New England,&lt;ref&gt;Art New England, Rich McKown.

'''Khmer sasatra''' is a [[sastra]], or manuscript, written during and after the [[Khmer empire]], from at least the 12th century, in Southeast Asia.

Khmer sastras are written in the [[pali]] language, and some in [[Khmer language|Khmer]], on a variety of material, mostly dried [[palm leaves]] from the ''[[Corypha lecomtei]]'' palm tree, ordered and tied together in what is known as an [[ola leaf|olla]] book or [[palm-leaf manuscript]]. The tradition of producing olla books in Cambodia goes back as far as the influence of Indian civilization in the region and the tradition of Khmer sastras is at least contemporaneous with the introduction of Buddhism and other religions of Indian origin in the Khmer realm. Their presence in Cambodia is attested with certainty in a 12th-century bas-relief in the grandiose [[Angkor Wat]] temple, depicting an ''[[apsara]]'' (female spirit) holding an olla book. The Chinese visitor [[Zhou Daguan]], who toured the Khmer capital in 1292, also relates in his travelogue that monks would recite daily prayers read from books made of "very evenly stacked palm leaves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://khmermanuscripts.efeo.fr/en/manuscripts/tradition.html|title=Manuscript tradition in Cambodia |publisher=EFEO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khmer literature is generally divided into three main categories, namely ''Tes'', containing sacred [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] knowledge, ''Lbaeng'' with literary verses of a rich vocabulary for general entertainment, and the technical ''Kbuon'' containing knowledge of medicine, pharmacopoeia, astronomy, law, chronicles, magics, divination or demonology.

Apart from sastra olla books, the ancient Khmers also made paper books (from [[mulberry]] bark) known as ''[[Kraing]]'' and wrote on stone, metals, and human skin (tattoos) but rarely used animal hide or skins.

== Libraries ==
During the Angkorian era, Khmer sastras were made by monks in the Khmer temples and stored in monastery libraries. Constructed from wood, these libraries were sometimes fitted with a multi-tiered roof, sitting in the middle of small ponds, to protect them from [[termite]]s. Our knowledge about these ancient libraries has only been inferred from the area of present-day Thailand, then part of the Angkorian empire. In Thailand, they are known as  ''ho trai'' today.

In the 16th century, a substantial body of Buddhist literature was created in the Cambodian temples. In later times, up to the present, pagodas served as library storehouses of Khmer sastras and literary works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam|series=The World and its Peoples|volume=6 |author=Marshall Cavendish|publisher=Marshall Canvedish Corporation|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palm-leaves gets attacked by mold, insects, moisture and weather, especially in a [[the tropics|tropical climate]], and in order to preserve Khmer sastras, a strategy of minute copying has been the usual recipe for the Buddhist monks. Because of this practice, most of the present day Khmer sastras were probably produced in the 19th century, as copies of former times sastras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|url=http://americanarchivist.org/doi/pdf/10.17723/aarc.53.2.26824l5408112w76 |title=The Preservation of Books and Manuscripts in Cambodia |author=John F. Dean |journal=American Archivist |volume=53 |pages=282–297|date=Spring 1990 |accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://khmermanuscripts.efeo.fr/en/methodology/age.html|title=A word about the age of Cambodia’s manuscripts |publisher=EFEO|accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
In the 13th century, the [[Khmer Empire]] gradually declined, large parts of the kingdom were conquered by neighboring cultures, such as the [[Thai people|Siamese]] and [[Chams]], founding what became the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] (predecessor of modern-day Thailand) and south Vietnam respectively. At the same time the official state religion of the Khmers changed from [[Brahmanism]] and [[Mahayana Buddhism]] to [[Theravada Buddhism]]. Combined, the result was that much of the former legacy of the Khmer sastras became absorbed by the Thai culture or was forgotten.

In the course of the Cambodian civil war and the subsequent upheavals of the Khmer Rouge regime in the 1960s and 1970s, an estimated 80% of Cambodian pagodas had their libraries destroyed and a large number of monks perished as well. More than half of the Khmer literary legacy from before 1975 was lost in these years.&lt;ref&gt;See "''Cambodian Culture Since 1975: Homeland and Exile''".&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving Khmer sastras are now kept in Cambodian pagodas, the [[National Library of Cambodia]] and a multitude of institutes across the world, including [[Bibliothèque Nationale de Paris]]. Only a few monks in present-day Cambodia have expert knowledge of how to craft sastras.&lt;ref name=Phavy&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/post-weekend/palm-leaves-preserving-history |title=Palm leaves preserving history |author=Sen David and Thik Kaliyann |newspaper=The Phnom Penh Post |volume=6|date=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1980s, several groups, organizations and institutes in Cambodia and abroad are working for the preservation of the Khmer sastras for the future. Many of the ancient manuscripts have now been digitized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amadi.univ-lr.fr/project.php|title=Amadi Project|publisher=AMADI Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://khmermanuscripts.efeo.fr/en/manuscripts/discovery.html|title=Discovery of in situ manuscripts and creation of research tools |publisher=EFEO}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effort is almost exclusively directed at preserving former Khmer sastras, very few people are crafting new ones.&lt;ref name=Phavy/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ndl.go.jp/en/iflapac/preconference/pdf/RujayaAbhakorn.pdf |title=Issues and Future of Preservation Activities and Collaboration in Southeast Asia |author=Rujaya Abhakorn |journal=Preservation and Conservation in Asia |date=August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kondana Caves''' are located in the small village of Kondana, 33&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Lonavala]] and 16&amp;nbsp;km northwest of [[Karla Caves]]. This cave group has 16 [[Buddhist]] [[caves]]. The caves were excavated in first century B.C. The construction on wooden pattern is notable.&lt;ref name=AHIR /&gt; One can reach the cave by descending from Rajmachi village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kapadia|first=Harish|title=Trek the Sahyadris|year=2003|publisher=Indus Publ.|location=New Delhi|isbn=8173871515|page=122|edition=5.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cave only one inscription on the front of the [[Chaitya]], which gives information about donors.&lt;ref name=AHIR&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahir|first=D.

==Description==
About 14&amp;nbsp;km from the Karjat station, on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, and at the base of the old hill fort of [[Rajmachi]], is the Kondane group of caves, first brought to notice in the 19th century by [[Vishnu Sastri]], and soon after visited by Mr. Law, then collector of [[Thane|Thana]]. They are in the face of a steep scarp, and quite hidden from view by the thick forest in front of them. Water trickles down over the face of the rock above them during a considerable part even of the dry season, and has greatly injured them. So much so indeed that it is now difficult to determine whether they or the caves at [[Bhaja Caves]] are the earliest. They must be nearly, if not quite contemporary, and as they must have taken some time to excavate, their dates may overlap to some extent. The [[Vihara]] at Kondane certainly looks more modern, while the Chaitya, which is very similar in plan and dimensions to that at Bhaja, is so much ruined that it is impossible now to decide which may have been first completed.&lt;ref name="Fergusson 220"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fergusson|first1=James|last2=Burgess|first2=James|title=The cave temples of India|date=1880|publisher=London : Allen|pages=220-222|url=https://archive.org/stream/cavetemplesofind00ferguoft#page/220/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Cave No1: Chaitya===
[[File:Kondana Chaitya.jpg|thumb|The Chaitya.]]
They face north-west, and the first to the south-west is a Chaitya-cave of very considerable dimensions, being 66.5 feet from the line of the front pillars to the extremity of the apse, 26 feet 8 inches wide, and 28 feet 5 inches high to the crown of the arch. The nave in front of the [[Stupa|dagoba]] is 49 feet in length by 14 feet 8 inches, and the dagoba 9.5 feet in diameter, with a capital of more than usual height, the neck representing the relic casket being, as at Bhaja, of double the ordinary height, and representing two coffers, one 
above the other, carved on the sides with the Buddhist rail pattern. The fillets that covered this are decayed, as is also the whole of the lower part of the dagoba. 

[[File:Kondana Chaitya dagoba.jpg|thumb|left|Chaitya [[Stupa|dagoba]].]]
[[File:Kondana caves chaitya facade detail.jpg|thumb|left|Chaitya façade detail.]]
The bases with the lower parts of all the thirty columns that surrounded the nave, as well as that of one of the two irregular columns that once ornamented the front, have also decayed, and positions only of most of them can now be ascertained. Between these two latter pillars a wooden screen or front originally filled the opening to a height of about 10 or 12 feet, in which were the doorways leading to the interior and it was fixed to them, as seems to have been the case with all the earlier caves. The Chaitya Cave at Bhaja and that at Kondane had similar fronts constructed in wood. The caves at Bedsa and [[Karla caves|Karle]] are apparently among the earliest, where these screens were carved in the rock instead of being erected in the more perishable material.&lt;ref name="Fergusson 220"/&gt; 

[[File:Kondana half head.jpg|thumb|Remain of the sculpture of a head, with inscription.]]
There are still, however, remains of seven pillars on the left side of the cave, and six on the south, which rake inwards, as do also those at Bhaja and Bedsa, a proof of the early 
date of the work; those behind the dagoba and six near the front on the right side have disappeared entirely. On the upper portion of one column on the left is a symbol or device somewhat resembling a dagoba, with a rude canopy over it. The arched roof has had wooden rafters as at Karle and elsewhere, but they are gone, and the only remains of the woodwork is a portion of the latticed screen in the front arch. The [[façade]] bears a strong family likeness to that at Bhaja. On the left side is a fragment of sculpture in [[high-relief]] part of the head of a single figure about twice life-size. The features are destroyed, but the details of the headdress show the most careful attention to finish of detail. Over the 
left shoulder is an inscription in one line in [[Brahmi]] characters which reads: Kanvasa antevasina Balakena katam ("Made by Balakena, the pupil of Kanha (Krishna)").&lt;ref name="Fergusson 220"/&gt; 

Over this head, at the level of the spring of the great arch in the facade, is a broad projecting belt of sculpture: the lower portion of it is carved with the rail pattern ; the central portion is divided into seven compartments, filled alternately, three with a lattice pattern and five with human figures, one male in the first, a male and female in each of the third and fifth, and a male with a bow and two females in the seventh. Over these is a band with the representations of the ends of tie-beams or bars projecting through it, and then four fillets, each projecting over the one below, and the upper half of the last serrated. The corresponding belt of carving on the right side of the facade is much damaged by the falling away of the rock at the end next the arch.&lt;ref name="Fergusson 220"/&gt;

===Cave No.2: Vihara===
[[File:Kondana Vihara.jpg|thumb|left|Interior of a [[vihara]].]]
A little to north-east is No. II., a [[Vihara]], of which the front of the veranda is totally destroyed except the left end. This verandah was 5 feet 8 inches wide and 18 feet long, with the unique number of five octagon pillars and two [[anta (architecture)|antae]]. In the end of this veranda is a raised recess, and under a Chaitya arch is a small dagoba in half relief, apparently the only object of worship when these caves were excavated. Inside, the hall is 23 feet wide by 29 deep, and 8 feet 3 inches high, with 15 pillars arranged about 3 feet apart and from the side and back walls, but none across the front. The upper portions of these pillars are square, but about 1.5 feet from the top they are octagonal: the bases of all are gone, but they also were probably square. 

[[File:Kondana caves vihara veranda.jpg|thumb|Veranda of the [[vihara]].]]
The roof is panelled in imitation of a structural hall with beams 19 inches deep by 8 thick, 3.5 feet apart, running across through the heads of the pillars, and the spaces between divided by smaller false rafters, 5 inches broad by 2 deep. There are three wide doors into the hall, though most of the front 
wall is broken away, and on each side six cells in all, each with the monk's bed in it, and the first on each side with two. Over the doors of 14 of these cells are carved Chaitya or horse-shoe arches, connected by a string course projecting 6 or 7 inches and carved with the rail pattern.&lt;ref name="Fergusson 220"/&gt;

===Cave No.3===
Cave No.3 is a plain Vihara with nine cells, much ruined, especially in front, but it had probably three doors.&lt;ref name="Fergusson 220"/&gt; 

===Cave No.4===
No.4 is a row of nine cells at the back of what now looks like a natural hollow under the cliff. Beyond them is a tank, now filled with mud, then two cells under a deep ledge of over-hanging rock, and, lastly, a small cistern.&lt;ref name="Fergusson 220"/&gt;

This is a '''list of deities and legendary figures''' found in the '''[[Etruscan mythology#List of Etruscan mythological figures|Etruscan mythology]]'''.

The names below were taken mainly from Etruscan "picture bilinguals", which are Etruscan [[call-out]]s on art depicting mythological scenes or motifs. Several different media provide names. Variants of the names are given, reflecting differences in language in different localities and times.

Many of the names are Etruscan spellings (and pronunciations) of Greek names. The themes may or may not be entirely Greek. Etruscans frequently added their own themes to Greek myths. The same may be said of native Italic names rendered into Etruscan. Some names are entirely Etruscan. Which is often a topic of debate in the international forum of scholarship.

;[[Tinia]], Tina, Tin: Chief Etruscan god, the ruler of the skies, husband of Uni, and father of Hercle, identified with the Greek [[Zeus]] and Roman [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] well within the Etruscan window of ascendance, as the Etruscan kings built the first temple of Jupiter at Rome. Called ''apa'', "father" in inscriptions (parallel to the -piter in Ju-piter), he has most of the attributes of his Indo-European counterpart, with whom some have postulated a more remote linguistic connection.&lt;ref&gt;''The Nostratic Macrofamily: a Study in Distant Linguistic Relationships,'' (1994) Allan R. Bornhard and John C. Kerns, Walter de Gruyter, {{ISBN|3-11-013900-6}}, page 304, previewed on Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt; The name means "day" in Etruscan. He is the god of boundaries and justice. He is depicted as a young, bearded male, seated or standing at the center of the scene, grasping a stock of thunderbolts. According to Latin literature, the bolts are of three types: for warning, good or bad interventions, and drastic catastrophes.&lt;ref name=DGch4&gt;De Grummond, Chapter IV.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Zeus, Tin needs the permission of the Dii Consentes (consultant gods) and Dii Involuti (hidden gods) to wield the last two categories. A further epithet, Calusna (of Calu), hints at a connection to wolves or dogs and the underworld.&lt;ref name="DGch4" /&gt; 

;Tinas cliniar: Etruscan expression, "sons of Tina", designating the [[Dioscuri]], proving that Tin was identified with [[Zeus]].&lt;ref name=SB78/&gt;

;Tiur, Tivr, Tiv: Etruscan deity identified with Greek [[Selene]] and Roman [[Luna (goddess)]].&lt;ref name=SB78/&gt;

;Tlusc, Tluscv, Mar Tlusc: Unknown deity of the [[Piacenza Liver]], which is not a picture bilingual.&lt;ref name=BF2002p174/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thulin page 59.&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding region in [[Martianus Capella]] is ruled by [[Sancus]], an Italic god and Sabine progenitor, who had a temple on the [[Quirinal]] Hill, and appears on an Etruscan boundary stone in the expression Selvans Sanchuneta, in which Sanchuneta seems to refer to the oaths establishing the boundary. Sancus probably comes from Latin sancire, "to ratify an oath."&lt;ref&gt;De Grummond, page 50, features a diagram comparing Capella and the liver, while page 149 presents the boundary stone.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Tuntle: The legendary figure, known to the Greeks as [[Tyndareus]].&lt;ref name=BF2002p208/&gt;

;[[Turan (mythology)|Turan]]: Etruscan goddess identified with Greek [[Aphrodite]] and Roman [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]. She appears in the expression, Turan ati, "Mother Turan", equivalent to Venus Genetrix.&lt;ref name=BF2002p208/&gt; Her name is a noun meaning "the act of giving" in Etruscan, based on the verb stem ''Tur-'' 'to give.'

;[[Turms]], Turmś: Etruscan god identified with Greek [[Hermes]] and Roman [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercurius]]. In his capacity as guide to the ghost of Tiresias, who has been summoned by Odysseus, he is ''Turms Aitas'', "Turms Hades."&lt;ref name=BF2002p208/&gt;

;Turnu: An Etruscan deity, a type of [[Eros]], child of [[Turan]].&lt;ref name=BF2002p208/&gt;

;TV[?]th: Unknown deity of the [[Piacenza Liver]], which is not a picture bilingual.&lt;ref name=BF2002p174/&gt;

;[[Tyrrhenus]]: An Etruscan culture hero and twin brother of [[Tarchon]].

==U==
;[[Uni (mythology)|Uni]]: Supreme goddess of the Etruscan pantheon, wife of Tinia, mother of Hercle, and patroness of [[Perugia]]. With Tinia and Menrva, she was a member of the ruling [[Capitoline Triad|triad]] of Etruscan deities. Uni was the equivalent of the Roman [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], whose name ''Uni'' may be derived from, and the Greek [[Hera]].

;Uthste: Legendary hero, [[Odysseus]]

==V==
;[[Vanth]]: Etruscan winged demon of the underworld often depicted in the company of [[Charun]]. She could be present at the moment of death, and frequently acted as a guide of the deceased to the underworld.&lt;ref name="SB78"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BF2002p210&gt;The Bonfantes (2002), page 210.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Grummond, pages 220-225.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Vea: Etruscan divinity, possibly taking its name from the city of [[Veii]] or vice versa.&lt;ref name=BF2002p210/&gt;

;Vecu, Vecui, Vecuvia, [[Vegoia]]: The prophetic nymph, Vegoia. See under Lasa Vecuvia,&lt;ref name=BF2002p210/&gt; Begoë.

;Veltha, Velthume, Vethune, Veltune: Etruscan deity, possible state god of the [[Etruscan league]] of [[Etruria]], the [[Voltumna]] in the Latin expression ''Fanum Voltumnae'', "shrine of Voltumna", which was their meeting place, believed located at [[Orvieto]]. The identification is based on reconstruction of a root *velthumna from Latin Voltumna, [[Vertumnus]] and Voltumnus of literary sources, probably from Etruscan veltha, "[[chthonic|earth]]" or "field." Representations of a bearded male with a long spear suggest Velthune may be an epithet of Tinia.&lt;ref&gt;A good development of the concept can be found in Harmon.&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Veiovis|Veiove]], Veive, Vetis: Etruscan infernal deity whose temple stood at [[Rome]] near the [[Capitoline]] Hill.&lt;ref name=BF2002p210/&gt; The identification is made from the deity's Latin names related by a number of ancient authors over the centuries: '''Vēi, Vēdi, Vēdii, Veiovis, Vediovis, Vediiovis, Vedius.'''&lt;ref&gt;Lewis &amp; Short, ''Latin Lexicon'', available online at www.perseus.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Velparun: The Greek hero, [[Elpenor]].&lt;ref name=BF2002p210/&gt;

;Vesuna: Italic goddess mentioned also in the [[Iguvine Tables]].&lt;ref name=BF2002p210/&gt;

;Vikare: Son of Taitle, the mythological figure of [[Icarus (mythology)|Icarus]].&lt;ref&gt;Swaddling &amp; Bonfante page 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The name is found inscribed once, on a golden bulla dating to the 5th century BCE now housed at the Walters Art Museum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thewalters.org/works_of_art/itemdetails.aspx?aid=125 The Walters Art Museum&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Baba Sain Mir Mohammed Sahib''' (c. 1550 – 22 August 1635), popularly known as '''Mian Mir''' or '''Miyan Mir''', was a famous [[Sufi]] [[Muslim]] [[saint]] who resided in [[Lahore]], specifically in the town of ''Dharampura'' (in present-day [[Pakistan]]). He was a direct descendant of [[Caliph]] [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]]. He belonged to the [[Qadiri]] order of [[Sufism]]. He is famous for being a spiritual instructor of [[Dara Shikoh]], the eldest son of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Shah Jahan]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanif, N. (2000).

== Mian Mir and Emperor Jahangir ==
[[Image:Mian-Mir-Mausoleum.jpg|thumb|right|[[Shrine of Mian Mir]].]]
Mian Mir was a friend of God-loving people and he would shun worldly, selfish men, greedy [[Emir]]s and ambitious [[Nawab]]s who ran after [[faqir]]s to get their blessings. To stop such people from coming to see him, Mian Mir posted his ''mureeds'' (disciples) at the gate of his house.&lt;ref name="Dawn"&gt;[https://www.dawn.com/news/1235304 A Sufi, a Sikh and their message of love &amp;ndash; A journey from Lahore to Amritsar], Dawn newspaper, Updated 20 May 2017, Retrieved 20 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Once, [[Jahangir]], the Mughal emperor, with all his retinue came to pay homage to the great faqir. He came with all the pomp and show that befitted an emperor. Mian Mir's sentinels however, stopped the emperor at the gate and requested him to wait until their master had given permission to enter. Jahangir felt slighted. No one had ever dared delay or question his entry to any place in his kingdom. Yet he controlled his temper and composed himself. He waited for permission. After a while, he was ushered into Mian Mir's presence. Unable to hide his wounded vanity, Jahangir, as soon as he entered, told Mian Mir in [[Persian language|Persian]]: ''Ba dar-e-darvis darbane naa-bayd'' ("On the doorstep of a faqir, there should be no sentry").{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The emperor was embarrassed and asked for forgiveness. Then, with folded hands, Jahangir requested Mian Mir to pray for the success of the campaign which he intended to launch for the conquest of the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. Meanwhile, a poor man entered and, bowing his head to Mian Mir, made an offering of a [[rupee]] before him. The Sufi asked the devotee to pick up the rupee and give it to the poorest, neediest person in the audience. The devotee went from one [[dervish]] to another but none accepted the rupee. The devotee returned to Mian Mir with the rupee saying: "Master, none of the dervishes will accept the rupee. None is in need, it seems."{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

{{citation needed span|"Go and give this rupee to him," said the faqir, pointing to Jahangir. "He is the poorest and most needy of the lot. Not content with a big kingdom, he covets the kingdom of the Deccan. For that, he has come all the way from [[Delhi]] to beg. His hunger is like a fire that burns all the more furiously with more wood. It has made him needy, greedy and grim. Go and give the rupee to him."|date=October 2018}}

== Mian Mir and Sikhism ==

According to Sikh tradition, the [[Sikhism|Sikh]] guru [[Guru Arjan Dev Ji]] met Mian Mir during their stay in [[Lahore]]. This tradition does not appear in the early Sikh literature, and is first mentioned in the 18th and 19th century chronicles. However, it may be possible that this tradition is historically true, and may have been suppressed during the earlier period because of Sikhs' conflicts with the Muslim [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] and [[Durrani Empire|Afghans]].&lt;ref name="Pashaura_2006"/&gt;

=== Legend about foundation of Harmandir Sahib ===

According to ''Tawarikh-i-Punjab'' (1848), written by Ghulam Muhayy-ud-Din alias Bute Shah, Mian Mir laid the foundation of the [[Sikhism|Sikh]] shrine [[Harmandir Sahib]] (Golden Temple), at the request of [[Guru Arjan Dev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Surindar Singh Kohli |title=The Sikh and Sikhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ED0syBKqafMC&amp;pg=PA68 |publisher=Atlantic |page=68 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the earliest Sikh records state that the foundation stone was laid by Guru Arjun himself, the later Sikh records mention the legend that appears in ''Tawarikh-i-Punjab''. The legend is repeated in several European sources, beginning with ''The Punjab Notes and Queries''.&lt;ref name="MK_1983"&gt;{{cite book |author=Madanjit Kaur |title=The Golden Temple: Past and Present |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7n_XAAAAMAAJ |year=1983 |publisher=Department of Guru Nanak Studies, Guru Nanak Dev University Press |pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the ''Report Sri Darbar Sahib'' (1929), published by the Harmandir Sahib temple authorities, have endorsed this account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pardeep Singh Arshi |title=The Golden Temple: history, art, and architecture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rcmfAAAAMAAJ |year=1989 |publisher=Harman |isbn=978-81-85151-25-0 |page=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this legend is unsubstantiated by historical evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Louis E. Fenech |author2=W. H. McLeod |title=Historical Dictionary of Sikhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xajcAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA205 |year=2014 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=978-1-4422-3601-1 |page=205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=T.

It appears only in the later accounts, and may have been invented to strengthen the Sikh-Muslim relationship.&lt;ref name="Pashaura_2006"&gt;{{cite book |author=Pashaura Singh |author-link=Pashaura Singh (Sikh scholar) |title=Life and Work of Guru Arjan: History, Memory, and Biography in the Sikh Tradition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ciwpDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT126 |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-908780-8 |pages=126–128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death and legacy==
[[File:Mian Mir Grave.jpg|thumb|right|Inside view of [[Shrine of Mian Mir|Mian Mir's Mausoleum]] in [[Lahore]].]]
After having lived a long life of piety and virtuosity, Mian Mir died on 22 August 1635 (7 Rabi' al-awwal, 1045 according to the [[Islamic Calendar]]). He was eighty-eight years old.

His funeral oration was read by Mughal prince [[Dara Shukoh|Dara Shikoh]], who was a highly devoted disciple of the Saint.
There is a hospital named after him in his hometown Lahore, called ''Mian Mir Hospital''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lahorenews.tv/index.php/en/video/1815/Mayor-Lahore-pays-visit-to-Mian-Mir-Hospital- Mayor Lahore pays visit to Mian Mir Hospital], lahorenews.tv website, Published 19 April 2017, Retrieved 17 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tomb ===
{{main|Shrine of Mian Mir}}
[[File:Mian-mir-tomb-ceiling.JPG|thumb|The heavily embellished ceiling of Mian Mir tomb]]
He was buried at a place which was about a mile from Lahore near Alamganj, that is at the south-east of the city.  Mian Mir's spiritual successor was [[Mullah Shah Badakhshi]]. Mian Mir's ''[[Mazar (mausoleum)|Mazar]]'' (Mausoleum) still attracts hundreds of devotees each day and he is revered by many Sikhs as well as Muslims. The tomb's architecture still remains quite intact to this day. His death anniversary ('Urs' in Urdu language) is observed there by his devotees every year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nation.com.pk/picture-gallery/20-Dec-2015/urs-of-mian-mir-sahib Death anniversary of Mian Mir observed in Lahore], The Nation newspaper, Published 20 December 2015, Retrieved 17 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5277">{{about|the American columnist|the Canadian journalist|Michael McManus (journalist)}}
'''Michael McManus''' (born June 11, 1941)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite LAF|id=n92-106369}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the author of "Ethics &amp; Religion", a socially conservative but economic liberal syndicated opinion column which appears in several small and mid-range US publications. The column, archives of which are linked below, is shaped much like a 'gathering point' of views; quotes from prominent conservative activists make up the bulk of each. McManus, an [[evangelical Christian]], is also the founder and president of Marriage Savers, a [[non-profit]] organization that purports to prepare couples for marriage. McManus previously wrote syndicated columns called "Solutions" and the "Northern Perspective."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/opinion/contributors/viewpoints/2016/01/10/mcmanus-fix-fault-divorce/78497624/ McManus: Fix no-fault divorce – Mike McManus is the president of Marriage Savers and a syndicated columnist writing a weekly column on ethics and religion]. Published 5:32 a.m. ET Jan. 10, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stance on issues==
McManus has addressed many modern social, ethical and political issues in his column. Among his published views are:
*'''Gay marriage:''' McManus has described [[LGBT]] relationships as "sordid", "tawdry", "lewd" and a "perversion".&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20080905143425/http://www.ethicsandreligion.com/redesignedcolumns/C1358.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He opposes both [[gay marriage]] and [[civil unions]], or any legal recognition of same-sex relationships, pointing to "the tyranny of unelected judges redefining marriage" &lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20070813225509/http://www.ethicsandreligion.com/redesignedcolumns/C1207.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and claims that same-sex parenting is "harmful to children."  &lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20070720203025/http://www.ethicsandreligion.com/redesignedcolumns/C1311.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Abortion:''' McManus is definitively [[pro-life]].
*'''Divorce:''' McManus is an opponent of the [[no-fault divorce]] law. He believes that "Most divorces are filed by one person who alleges incompatibility, while the other spouse wants to save the marriage. Sadly, divorce is always granted. This column has long advocated that in cases involving children, when adultery or abuse is not alleged, divorce should only be granted if there is 'mutual consent' by husband and wife.  What was entered into by two people, should not be ended, unless both people agree." &lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20070720203025/http://www.ethicsandreligion.com/redesignedcolumns/C1311.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Gun control:''' McManus is critical of what he describes as America's "weak gun control" and says it is time to "re-introduce an assault weapon ban, a national limit of one gun a month to anyone, an expansion of the [[Brady law]] to include gun show sales and a required check on mental backgrounds of buyers." &lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20081013132551/http://www.ethicsandreligion.com/redesignedcolumns/C1339.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Pornography:''' McManus has said that it is a major factor in breakup of marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=McManus |first1=Mike |title=How To Escape Pornography |url=http://ethicsandreligion.com/columns/2014/C1736.htm |accessdate=11 June 2018 |publisher=Ethics &amp; Religion |date=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government payout controversy==
On January 28, 2005, it was discovered that McManus was one of three media figures to accept money from the [[George W. Bush administration]] for targeted public endorsements of government policy.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

McManus was the third person to be implicated in an article by Tom Hamburger of ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]''. It was revealed that McManus, who is a self-described "marriage advocate", was paid through a subcontractor of the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] to endorse a Bush-approved initiative defining marriage as strictly between a man and a woman. The payments were said to be $4,000 plus travel expenses, with an additional $49,000 paid to his organization, "Marriage Savers". McManus did not disclose this payment to his readers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

[[File:Kloster Ephraim, Eingangsbereich.jpg|thumb|Monastery Ephraim, entrance]]
The monastery Ephraim ([[Greek language|Greek]] Ιέρα Γυναικέια Κοινοβιακή Μονή Οσιόυ Εφραίμ του Συρόυ), named after [[Ephraim the Syrian]], was founded in 1983, is inhabited by nuns and one of the youngest [[List of churches and monasteries in Mount Olympus|monasteries near Mount Olympus]].

== Location ==
The monastery is located on a 151 meter high hill, 1.5 kilometers north of the village Kontariotissa and 6 kilometers southwest of the city [[Katerini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.de/maps/@40.2381917,22.4508816,212m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!10m1!1e2|title=Bird eyes view of the monastery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The monastery ==
[[File:Kirche Kloster Ephraim.jpg|thumb|The main church of the convent]]
The monastery is subordinate to the diocese Kitros Katerini, belonging to the archdiocese of Athens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecclesia.gr/English/EnDioceses/EnDioceses.asp?mitra_id=117|title=Diocese Kitros Katerini}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The property stretches over approximately 21 hectares and is surrounded by a wall. Outside the actual monastery, there is an ornamental garden, a church where weddings and christening take place, and an olive grove. The center of the complex is a square planted with a plane tree, bordered on the west by an ornamental garden and then by the church named Agia Irini and the administrative building. The main church, [[Katholikon]], lies to the east of it. The buildings on the south side serve to entertain the guests, here is also one of the two exhibitions housed. In this one the artisan made products of the nuns are sold. The Sisters' home to the north is the largest building in the monastery. To the east of the church there is another ornamental garden and the exhibition offering handicraft products made by the nuns. In the north of the garden is an [[aviary]], in which peacocks, pigeons and chickens are held.

{{Chinese|t=拿督公|p=Ná Dū Gōng|poj=Ná-tok-kong
|pic=NaTukKong003.jpg|piccap=Picture of Na Tuk Kong Shrine (拿督公神龛).}}
'''Na Tuk Kong'''  are local guardian spirits worshipped in Malaysia, Singapore and parts of Indonesia, especially Sumatra. An alternate more generic name for the cult is Datuk Gong, uniting '''Dato''' or '''Datuk''' from the local [[Malay language|Malay]] word for 'grandfather', which is also used as an honorific title, and ''Kong'' or ''Gong'' from Chinese, also an honorific title. According to [[Taoism in Malaysia|Taoist]] tradition, a Na Tuk Kong's could hold the official title 拿督尊王（[[Pinyin]]：nádū zūnwáng, "Revered/Respectable/Noble King Datuk）. It is important to note that [[Datuk Keramat]], Datuk Gong and Na Tuk Kong all refer to the same deity. For the sake of clarity, the term Datuk, which is universally used to describe the spirit in Malaysia, will be used.

==Origins== 
According to local legends, all Datuks were once humans who had a standing in society either for their position or special attributes. They could have been an important leader, a renowned healer, a ''[[silat]]'' warrior, a pious man or even a shaman. Upon their death, locals and their followers would sometimes offer prayers at their gravestones, in line with the concept of ''[[keramat]]''. Local Malay culture prior to the arrival of a more conservative brand of Islam practised the paying of respects to guardian spirits or ''penunggu'' which is believed to reside in seemingly 'unusual' natural formations; a unique shaped rock, an ant mount, a snake's nest, an extraordinarily large tree etc.

With the arrival of Chinese immigrants who carried along with them the Confucianist belief of ancestor worship, both practices converged and formed a new micro-culture as observed today. Datuks, referred to in Chinese as Na Tuk Kong (earth spirits), is considered a localised form in the worship of the spirit of the land, along with Tu Di Gong.

The worship of Datuk among Malays and Indian Muslims declined steadily after Islamic authorities started clamping down on such activities. By that time, Dato worship have taken root in the local Chinese spiritual beliefs.

== Malaysian Chinese definition==
[[Image:DatukAli002.jpg|thumb|right|220px|One of the Malay-Chinese Na Tuk Kongs in Malaysia, Datuk Ali (拿督阿里).]]

To most Malaysian Chinese, Datuk Gong is a local guardian spirit that resides in trees, ant hills, caves, riverbanks and in strange stone formations. A Datuk worship usually begins after a person is granted a vision of the Datuk's spiritual form. Some common forms are a white tiger and the form of an old man dressed in white. A Datuk can also be "invited" to reside outside (never indoors) a family home for spiritual protection and luck.

The Datuk Gong is presented in many forms; an idol bearing his likeness, a [[Spirit tablet|tablet]] with an inscription of his title, a rock, a ''[[songkok]]'', a stack incense and flags are all used to denote the presence of the spirit. Shrines are usually decorated with items related to the Datuk and his position as a Malay guardian; a Malay [[sarong]], songkok, [[keris]], [[rattan]] cane, [[baju Melayu]] are among the items one can find placed right next to the idol. In more urban areas, the Datuk is usually represented with a [[Spirit tablet|central tablet]] bearing his title as the Datuk Gong of the area, written in Chinese.

A common misconception held by most Malaysians is that the Datuk Gong is just another regular Chinese deity. In actual fact, most Datuks are Malay-Muslim spirits. There are also Chinese, Indian, [[Siamese people|Siamese]] and even [[Orang Asli]] Datuks present and they are all considered independent from the Chinese pantheon of gods. The function and position of the Datuk varies across communities but his position as the spirit of the land remains the backbone of the belief. In most Chinese temples, the Datuk is almost always outside of the main building, either on a small altar of his own or a small shrine on the ground. Only in temples dedicated solely to the spirit will the idol or tablet be placed at the main altar.



== Variants ==
The structure of Datuk worship is diversified according to localities. For example, in the old quarters of Georgetown, the presence of The Seven Brothers or ''Tujuh Beradik'' is common while in the royal town of Klang in Selangor, most of the spirits worshipped are believed to be members of the royal court (Sultans, officers, warriors etc.), each with their own unique identity.

Some Datos even have their own personal names, which are revealed to worshippers during a trance session conducted by a medium.

Around the Malaysian countryside some small, red-coloured painted shrines by the roadside or under a tree can be found, and these shrines are usually worshipped by the residents living around the neighbourhood. Older shrines are often seen incorporating Islamic elements such as the crescent moon and inscriptions in [[Jawi alphabet|Jawi]]. Inside the simple room, a small, decorated statue depicting the Datuk is venerated. Offerings are presented on a small altar in front of the spirit. In some places it is possible to find large temples dedicated to the Datuk, all of which started out as much smaller shrines.

== Worship ==
[[Image:NaTukKong007.jpg|thumb|220px|Photo of Malay-Chinese deity Datuk Samsuri, the shrine is at [[Cheras, Kuala Lumpur|Cheras]] of Kuala Lumpur.]]

Offerings are usually placed at the altar or shrine once in the evening, at sunrise and later at sundown. The basic offerings are a pair of white candles, three [[joss sticks]] and burning [[Benzoin resin|gum Benjamin]] ''(kemenyan)''. Datuk worshippers prepare special offerings for the Na Tuk on Thursday evenings. A set of [[betel nut]] leaves complete with lime ''(kapur)'', sliced betel nut ''(pinang)'', Javanese tobacco ''(tembakau Jawa),'' and palm cigarette leaves ''(rokok daun)'', are offered together with fruits and the basic offerings.

Every Datuk is an individual and therefore his birthday is celebrated by worshippers with a grand feast. In the Northern States (Perlis, Kedah and Penang), worshippers usually slaughter chickens, and sometimes goats as the main dish of the ''[[kenduri]]''. It is extremely important for all the dishes prepared to be ''[[halal]]'', including the slaughtering of animals. Pork is considered unclean and therefore is totally forbidden in a shrine. The meat is later cooked into a curry and offered to the Datuk together with turmeric rice''(nasi kunyit)'', which is traditionally served at feasts in Malay culture. As the majority of worshippers are from the Chinese community, [[kenduri]]s today also incorporate Chinese dishes and offerings usually presented to deities within the [[Taoism|Taoist pantheon]] of gods.

Worshippers usually offer fresh flowers, ''sireh'' (betel nuts), ''rokok daun'' (local hand-rolled cigarettes), sliced ''pinang'' ([[areca nut]]s) and local fruits. An important part of the praying ritual is also to burn some ''kemenyan'', the gum Benjamin. If their prayers are answered, the worshippers usually return to the shrine to make offerings or hold a ''kenduri'' (feast) in thanksgiving.

Another common practise is for individuals to renovate the shrines to create a better-looking or grander shrine for the Datuk. In most places where there is a heavy presence of Datuk spirits, it is common to see shrines becoming larger over time, especially if individuals consider the Datuk to be "powerful". The ''kenduri'' items usually consist of yellow ([[saffron]]) rice, lamb or chicken curries, vegetables, ''pisang rastali'' (bananas), young coconuts, rose syrup, [[cheroot]]s (local cigars) and local fruits. Visitors are also asked to show respect when inside or around a shrine.

Datuks and ''keramats'' are seen as an alternative power to help in [[spiritual healing]] and granting protection. Mediums (''bomohs'') are engaged to enable communication between worshippers with the spirits. With the arrival of the spirits, the mediums go into trance and assume the personality of the spirit, giving instructions for further rituals and announcing the start of the consultation session. During this period, the locals would make a line to ask the spirit for blessings, cure for physical and "inexplicable" illness, predictions and sometimes guidance in overcoming certain obstacles in life. Such consultations are usually conducted on the first or 15th day of the month according to the [[lunar calendar]].

==Significant datuk in history ==

===Panglima Ah Chong===
One Datuk was originally a man of [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] [[Hakka people|Hakka]] family, his name was So Ah Chong (苏亚松). He was the leader of the [[Ghee Hin Kongsi|Ghee Hin]] secret society that founded more than 16 [[tin mine]] settlements. The municipal government of [[Taiping, Perak|Taiping]] in Perak named a road after him for his contribution to the economy. In June 1865 he was captured and sentenced to death by the local Malay chief of [[Matang]] during the [[Larut War]] among [[Hui (secret society)|secret societies]], yet the Malay chief honoured him by calling him "Panglima" Ah Chong (Commander Ah Chong). After his heroic death, it was said his godship was very effective for his worshippers and so peoples of Matang and coastal dwellers built shrines to worship him.

===Dato Haji Keramat===
The local Malay term ''[[Datuk Keramat]]'' means deity of the shrine, translated to Chinese is ''Na Tuk Kong'', where "Kong" is a term of respect. Dato Haji Keramat is a very powerful local earth deity that helps many people who sincerely pray to him. He detests alcohol.

===Datuk Zhang===
In the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] chronicle, during the reign of [[Wan Li|Emperor Wan Li]] 1573–1620 (万历皇帝), a man known as Zhang who lived in [[Brunei]], originally from [[Zhangzhou]] in Fujian province, was appointed "Datuk" of Brunei. For certain reasons of injustice done to him, Datuk Zhang committed suicide, and so his countrymen wanted justice for him.

'''Nakayama Shōzen''' (中山 正善, April 23, 1905 – November 14, 1967) was the second [[Shinbashira (Tenrikyo)|Shinbashira]] of [[Tenrikyo]]. He was the first son of [[Nakayama Shinnosuke]], the first Shinbashira, and the great-grandson of [[Nakayama Miki]], the foundress of Tenrikyo.

==Biography==
Nakayama Shōzen was born on April 23, 1905 in what is now [[Tenri, Nara|Tenri]], [[Nara Prefecture|Nara]], [[Japan]]. He was born to parents Nakayama Shinnosuke and Tamae.

On January 21, 1915, at the age of ten, Shōzen was installed as the Shinbashira. However, due to Nakayama's young age, the duties of the office were conducted by Yamazawa Tamenobu. In 1923, Shōzen entered [[Osaka Prefectural Shimizudani High School|Osaka High School]]. In 1925, he founded the Tenri Foreign Language School, the predecessor to [[Tenri University]], and installed as its principal. Later in the same year, he assumed all of the responsibilities of the Shinbashira office.&lt;ref&gt;Sugai, H. (2013) Academic and Cultural Exchanges between Tenri University and Marburg University: Retrospect and Prospect. ''Purification: Religious Transformations of Body and Mind.'' London: Bloomsbury T&amp;T Clark. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, Shōzen graduated from Osaka High School and entered the [[religious studies]] department at [[University of Tokyo]]. The department chair at the time was Prof. [[Masaharu Anesaki|Anesaki Masaharu]], who today is considered the father of religious studies in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;''Purification: Religious Transformations of Body and Mind,'' 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Shōzen's graduation thesis, titled "On Missionary Work" (伝道について ''Dendō ni tsuite''), was an analysis of questionnaire results that were solicited from Tenrikyo church head ministers and missionaries regarding the state of Tenrikyo's missionary activities at the time. His thesis was later edited and published by [[Tenrikyo Doyusha]] as ''Tenrikyō dendōsha ni kansuru chōsa'' in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Shimada, K. (2014).

The '''New Life''' was a period of renunciation, pilgrimage, and spiritual adventures undertaken by the Indian spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] on October 16, 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri, Bhau, ''Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher, The Biography of the Avatar of the Age, Meher Baba'', Volume Ten, 1949-1952 (Manifestation, Inc., 1996), p. 3,429.&lt;/ref&gt; Baba selected twenty companions to join him in this self-described life of complete reliance on God, telling his companions, "Life during that period will be lived at the mercy of the world. It will be a life of complete helplessness and hopelessness."&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri, Bhau, ''Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher, The Biography of the Avatar of the Age, Meher Baba'', Volume Ten, 1949-1952 (Manifestation, Inc., 1996), p. 3,445.&lt;/ref&gt;

After making provisions for those dependent on him, Meher Baba and his companions otherwise gave up all property and financial responsibilities. They then traveled about India incognito, without money, begging for their food, carrying out Baba's instructions and living in strict accordance with a set of "conditions of the New Life." These included absolute acceptance of the circumstances of their lives, and consistent good cheer in the face of any difficulty. Those companions who failed to comply were sent away. This phase of Meher Baba's life culminated in early 1952 after more than two years.

When pressed by inquisitive people for further explanation during the New Life, Meher Baba instructed his New Life companions to say this much: "Hopelessness means renunciation of all hopes. Aimlessness means renunciation of all aims. Helplessness means renunciation of all help. No master, no disciple, means renunciation of spirituality. And the New Life I have in mind eventually means absolute renunciation. Therefore, if any one asks you what this New Life is, say, 'Absolute and perfect renunciation.' If they ask, 'Renunciation of what?' say, 'Of everything – aims, hopes, help and life itself.'"&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri, Bhau, ''Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher, The Biography of the Avatar of the Age, Meher Baba'', Volume Ten, 1949-1952 (Manifestation, Inc., 1996), p. 3,481.&lt;/ref&gt;

About The New Life, Meher Baba wrote: 
{{quote|This New Life is endless, and even after my physical death it will be kept alive by those who live the life of complete renunciation of falsehood, lies, hatred, anger, greed and lust; and who, to accomplish all this, do no lustful actions, do no harm to anyone, do no backbiting, do not seek material possessions or power, who accept no homage, neither covet honor nor shun disgrace, and fear no one and nothing; by those who rely wholly and solely on God, and who love God purely for the sake of loving; who believe in the lovers of God and in the reality of Manifestation, and yet do not expect any spiritual or material reward; who do not let go the hand of Truth, and who, without being upset by calamities, bravely and wholeheartedly face all hardships with one hundred percent cheerfulness, and give no importance to caste, creed and religious ceremonies. This New Life will live by itself eternally, even if there is no one to live it.&lt;ref&gt;Purdom, Charles B., ''The God-Man: The Life, Journeys and Work of Meher Baba with an Interpretation of His Silence and Spiritual Teaching'' (George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1964), pp. 187-188.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An account of the New Life is documented in the book ''Tales From the New Life with Meher Baba'' (1976).&lt;ref&gt;Jessawala, Eruch, Irani, Mehera, Irani, Mani, Irani, Meheru, ''Tales From the New Life with Meher Baba'' (Berkeley, Calif.: The Beguine Library, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; It is also described in detail in ''The God-Man'' by [[Charles Purdom]] (1964),&lt;ref&gt;Purdom, Charles B., ''The God-Man: The Life, Journeys and Work of Meher Baba with an Interpretation of His Silence and Spiritual Teaching'' (George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1964).&lt;/ref&gt; and within ''Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher'' by [[Bhau Kalchuri]] (in volume 10 of first English edition, 1996;&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri, Bhau, ''Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher, The Biography of the Avatar of the Age, Meher Baba'', Volume Ten, 1949-1952 (Manifestation, Inc., 1996), p. 3,429+.&lt;/ref&gt; in volume 5 of the Hyderabad, India edition, 2005&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri, Bhau, ''Lord Meher, The Biography of the Avatar of the Age Meher Baba'', Volume Five, 1948-1953 (Hyderabad, India: Meher Mownavani Publications, 2005), p. 2,416+.&lt;/ref&gt;). The author [[Bhau Kalchuri]]'s account has also been expanded into its own 726-page book, ''Meher Baba's New Life'' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri, Bhau. ''Meher Baba's New Life'' (Pune, India: Flanagan/Witowski/Ladinsky/Beckett/Craig/Dennison, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Song of the New Life ==

In October 1949, as the New Life commenced, disciple of Meher Baba and New Life companion Dr. Abdul Ghani Munsiff wrote a "new life song" (or "Song of the New Life") in Hindi, including some edits by Meher Baba (the first verse from Meher Baba directly), which was then translated into English:&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri, Bhau, ''Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher, The Biography of the Avatar of the Age, Meher Baba'', Volume Ten, 1949-1952 (Manifestation, Inc., 1996), p. 3,468.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
Listen to the silent words of Meher Baba;&lt;br /&gt;
The life-story of all lovers of God is based on the practice of these words.&lt;br /&gt;
If you are serious about living this New Life,&lt;br /&gt;
Then wholeheartedly renounce this ephemeral existence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We have taken to this life, in which we rely only on God;&lt;br /&gt;
In this, our will [to do or die] is strengthened by the oath taken;&lt;br /&gt;
We are merrily singing the song of hopelessness;&lt;br /&gt;
We are inviting all calamities and difficulties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We neither wail over lost hopes, nor complain about broken promises;&lt;br /&gt;
We neither covet honor, nor shun disgrace;&lt;br /&gt;
Backbiting we know not, nor do we fear anyone;&lt;br /&gt;
This is now the color of our New Life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
No confusion in the mind now, nor any ties left;&lt;br /&gt;
Pride, anger, lust and greed we know not.&lt;br /&gt;
We have no religion, nor care for physical and mental fads.&lt;br /&gt;
The [[Sheikh]] and the [[Brahmin]] [typifying all castes and creeds] are now sailing in the same boat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There is no small or great now, for us all;&lt;br /&gt;
The questions of disciple, Master or Godhood no longer arise.&lt;br /&gt;
Brotherliness or fellow-feeling is the link that exists,&lt;br /&gt;
And this contributes to our present enjoyment of suffering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This world or the next, hell or heaven, we no longer bother about;&lt;br /&gt;
[[Shakti]]s and [[siddhi]]s, occultism and miracles, we no longer think of.&lt;br /&gt;
All these false impressions [thoughts] for us have been purged from the mind.&lt;br /&gt;
What has value and importance for us now, is to live in the active present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Dear ones, take seriously the words of Baba when he says:&lt;br /&gt;
"Although now I am on the same level with you all,&lt;br /&gt;
Yet all orders from me, good, bad, extraordinary,&lt;br /&gt;
You should all carry out immediately, leaving the result to God."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Even if the heavens fall,&lt;br /&gt;
Do not let go the Hand of Truth.&lt;br /&gt;
Let despair and disappointment ravage and destroy the garden [of your life];&lt;br /&gt;
Beautify it once again by the seedlings of contentment and self-sufficiency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Even if your heart is cut to bits, let there be a smile on your lips.&lt;br /&gt;
Here I divulge to you a point worth noting:&lt;br /&gt;
Hidden in your penniless hands is Treasure untold;&lt;br /&gt;
Your beggarly life will be the envy of kings!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
God exists indeed, and true are the Prophets.&lt;br /&gt;
Every cycle has an [[Avatar]], and every moment has a [[wali]].&lt;br /&gt;
For us, however, it is only hopelessness and helplessness.&lt;br /&gt;
How else should I tell you what our New Life is?&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri, Bhau, ''Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher, The Biography of the Avatar of the Age, Meher Baba'', Volume Ten, 1949-1952 (Manifestation, Inc., 1996), pp. 3,469-3,470.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avatarmeherbaba.org/erics/nlsong.html Meherbaba.org]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Culmination of New Life and Manonash ==

The New Life travels ended in the semi-desert plains of [[Northwestern India]], during October to December 1951, through a new phase called ''Manonash'' (Annihilation of Mind). As indicated by Baba, the ''Manonash'' work was carried out for "the abnegation of the personal will in the Divine Volition."

From 15 to 24 October 1951, for ten days, Meher Baba maintained periods of fasting, meditation, and seclusion inside a rock cave on a hill top, surrounded by a dargah of Harzat Baba Fakhruddin, and an old temple of [[Vishnu]], near [[Khajaguda]]. On 16 October 1951, Eruch, one of the five companions, carried with him a box of five models containing a temple, a mosque, a church, a ''[[pagoda]]'', and an ''agyari'' (Parsi fire temple), inscribed with [[alabaster]] on a marble stone. The five models represented the major religions of the world: Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, and Zoroastrianism. Eruch arranged them on a ledge inside the rock cave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://ambppct.org/mast7.php| location=Ahmednagar, India | work=ambppct.org| title=Manonash culmination| date=October 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meher Baba conveyed that the spiritually significant work of Man-O-Nash was done on behalf of the spiritual welfare of all humanity.

In the afternoon of October 24, 1951, Baba, with the five companions Gustadji, Baidul, Pendu, Eruch and Daulat Singh, left Khajaguda Pahad with their baggage. It took the group about a month to reach Seclusion Hill at the back of Meherazad by foot from Khajaguda hill to [[Meherazad]] hill.

The book ''Glimpses of the God Man Meher Baba'', by Bal Natu, cites Baba's message on the annihilation of mind during the ''Manonash'' meeting at Hyderabad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ambppct.org/Book_Files/Glimpse_Two_P2.pdf | location=Ahmednagar, India | work=Glimpses of the God-Man, p. 329| title=Manonash Meeting at Hyderabad| date=October 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== New Life Companions ==

In October 1949, at the age of 55, Meher Baba embarked with twenty companions, four women and sixteen men [[Mandali (Meher Baba)|mandali]]. They are listed here with their respective ages at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri, Bhau, ''Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher, The Biography of the Avatar of the Age, Meher Baba'', Volume Ten, 1949-1952 (Manifestation, Inc., 1996), p. 3,435.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Odyssean Wicca''' is a [[Wicca]]n tradition created in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] in the late 1970s. Its principal founders were  Tamarra and Richard James. Most of its practitioners today live in Ontario, but it also has members in the [[United States]]{{Ref|DFW}}. The tradition differs from other [[initiation|initiatory]] Wiccan traditions in its emphasis on preparation of its members for public priesthood.

The Odyssean tradition is strongly connected with the [http://www.wiccanada.ca/ Wiccan Church of Canada], a public [[Wiccan church]] also founded by the Jameses{{Ref|TPP}}.

==Origins and history==
The Odyssean Tradition of Wicca was founded by Richard and Tamara James in 1979, along with other members of their [[coven]]. The name of the tradition was inspired by [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', and is meant to emphasize a belief in life as a "spiritual journey"{{Ref|Landstreet}}.

The tradition grew out of the James' creation of the [[Wiccan Church of Canada]], with which the tradition is still very closely associated. While the James’s and their coven members claimed to have had backgrounds in [[Gardnerian Wicca]], [[Alexandrian Wicca]], and Continental Wicca, these claims were never substantiated—the general consensus of the British Traditional Wiccan community in Ontario prior to 1987 was that these claims had no substance whatsoever{{Ref|FGMP}}. Regardless, those traditions were not ideally suited for the goal of creating a place for public [[Neopagan]] worship, nor did any of these reflect the ritual style that the coven (and, by extension, the church) were adopting—with the exception of Pagan Way (an Outer Court system created by Gardnerian initiates) that had a direct influence upon Wiccan Church of Canada liturgy. The Odyssean tradition is a British Traditional-like Eclectic tradition of Wicca—with a public Wiccan priesthood providing religious services for a Neopagan laity{{Ref label|Landstreet|3|a}}{{Ref label|FGMP|4|a}}. In 1987, the James' purchased much of [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]]'s collection back from Ripleys, this included Ye Bok of Ye Art Magical. It is after this purchase that the James' received valid initiations and elevations into the various traditions and lineages [[British Traditional Wicca]] {{Ref label|FGMP|4|b}}.

The Odyssean tradition and the Wiccan Church of Canada reached their apex in 1992—at that time there were four temples (Toronto, Ottawa, Hamilton, and Kitchener-Waterloo) and three proto-temples in Brampton, Oshawa, and Montreal. Currently, the Wiccan Church of Canada has only two temples; the mother temple in Toronto, Ontario and a temple in [[Hamilton, Ontario]] {{Ref label|FGMP|4|c}}. While the influence of the Wiccan Church of Canada has declined over the past decade, the indirect influence of the Odyssean tradition has grown.  Because the WCC is a public Modern Pagan church, and because many members of the laity, many neophytes, and many initiates step away from the WCC to follow their path elsewhere. There are more former members of the WCC laity and more retired neophytes and initiates of the Odyssean tradition than there are active initiates. Many of these retired Odysseans have gone on to found their own covens and traditions that are based upon Odyssean practices. Many of the other [[Wiccan church]]es that exist in Canada, and to some extent the United States, have drawn upon Odyssean sources and retired Odysseans.

Prior to 1987, an Odyssean initiate who had been elevated into the High Priesthood would be autonomous of both the tradition's founders and of the WCC.  That meant that they could initiate and/or elevate their students up to the highest degree (3rd Degree) without requiring approval from the other High Priesthood of the tradition.  For those initiated after 1987, these initiates would have to retain active status—they must perform a minimal level of religious services (public rituals and public classes) to one of the temples of the Wiccan Church of Canada—for them to even bring a student before the Odyssean Priesthood Council.   The Odyssean Priesthood Council is open to all initiates who currently have active status and it is only after obtaining the approval of the Council that an initiate may initiate or elevate their student.  If an initiate fails to perform the minimum amount of religious services to one of the Wiccan Church of Canada temples, their status will be downgraded to inactive.  An Odyssean initiate who has been inactive for more than one year and one day can be reclassified by the High Priesthood of the tradition as retired. A retired Odyssean initiate can only return to active status with the permission of the High Priesthood of the tradition. Therefore, while the Odyssean tradition and the WCC were separate during the foundation years of the church, it has been the practice for the past twenty years that the Odyssean tradition and the Wiccan Church of Canada are firmly linked one to the other{{Ref label|FGMP|4|d}}.

==Practices==
Beyond the emphasis on public ministry, the Odyssean tradition is characterized by the following: it is an Eclectic tradition in its origins that has a strong [[British Traditional Wicca]] style to its forms of organization and initiation; although it emulates British Traditional the tradition's approach to ritual is more flexible and may often be less structured than many [[British Traditional Wicca]]ns would be comfortable with; the tradition rejects the concepts of Neopagan monism and Neopagan [[monotheism]]; the tradition does accept the base-line Wiccan concept of Neopagan duotheism but does encourage students and seekers alike to choose to affiliate with a particular [[Paganism|Pagan]] [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] and encourages the devotion to a deity (or group of deities) {{Ref label|Landstreet|3|b}}{{Ref label|FGMP|4|f}}.

The Odyssean training system is remarked upon as being notably rigorous{{Ref label|Landstreet|3|c}}{{Ref label|FGMP|4|g}}, which can be observed in the Wiccan Church of Canada weekly classes. These classes comprise the basic body of knowledge considered necessary by Odysseans, and can span upwards of 150 hours of class time or more. Completion of these classes (which includes the student completing the homework exercises assigned) is often considered a minimum requirement by Initiates before they accept a person as a new student.

==Ranks and degrees==
*Dedication is a ceremony performed by Odysseans for those individuals who wish to confirm themselves to a Neopagan (not necessarily Odyssean) path, and to worship of the Old Gods.
*Neophyting is a "pre-degree" marking the candidate's commitment to a study of the tradition. Although not an Initiate of the tradition, a Neophyte student is oathbound. It is typically awarded after one to two years of study with a private teacher, which in turn takes place after completion of a year-long cycle of public classes.
*First Degree Initiation is the rite of [[ordination]] within the Odyssean tradition. A first degree initiate is a priest or priestess and a member of the tradition. Among Odysseans, this is only awarded with the consent of a council composed of members of the tradition's active priesthood. It typically takes three to five years of study after Neophyting. It indicates competency in the demands of public priesthood, including "leading ritual, teaching, counselling [and] handling crises."{{Ref label|Landstreet|3|d}}.
*Second Degree Initiation represents an elevation to "High Priesthood". It is given to those who, in addition to work assigned, have been running a coven or student group successfully for at least a year and trained at least one student through to the first degree level. The time required for elevation to this degree is variable, and many first degree initiates do not actively pursue further training, but for those who do it generally takes five to ten years after initiation.
*Third Degree Initiation is rarely awarded, as it is only given to those people who have made a major contribution to the Neopagan community{{Ref label|Landstreet|3|e}}.

==Relationship with other traditions==
As mentioned above, Odyssean Wicca was inspired at least in part by the Gardnerian, Alexandrian,  Continental, and Blue Star traditions.

Despite the first part of its name, like all forms of Wicca, Odyssean Wicca has no connection to the modern religion of [[Hellenismos]], which is based on the worship of the Greek Gods of antiquity.

[[Blue Star Wicca]] does have a special relationship to the Odyssean tradition, as a "sister" or "cousin" tradition.{{Ref|Gillette}}   The Dymond line of [[Alexandrian Wicca]] also has a unique relationship with the Odyssean tradition and the Wiccan Church of Canada.  Because the Odyssean tradition has been created from the known published material (circa 1979) of [[Gardnerian Wicca]] and [[Alexandrian Wicca]] a greater exposure to the ritual style of other Wiccan and Modern Pagan traditions is offered to Odyssean laity, neophytes, and initiates through the Wiccan Church of Canada {{Ref label|FGMP|4|h}}.

==Temples and Covens==
There are currently two temples in Canada, one based in Toronto and the other in Hamilton. Within the United States, there is a Pagan temple in Connecticut, the [[Panthean Temple]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3563">'''Olcott Estate''' is the administrative headquarters of the [[Theosophical Society]] in America. Its  education department conducts on-site courses, seminars, workshops, and lectures for members and the public. It is located in [[Wheaton, Illinois]].

==History==
For the first fifty years of its history, the Society had its headquarters in various locations, according to the residence of its national presidents. In the mid-1920s, while [[L. W. Rogers]] was president of the American Section, the Wheaton site was selected. The property was purchased and continues to be maintained through the dues and gifts of members. In 1926 the cornerstone of the main building was laid by [[Annie Besant]], second international President of the Society. This building was first occupied in 1927, and since that time has continued as the center of Theosophical work in the United States.  

Olcott Estate derives its name from original society president, Colonel  [[Henry Steel Olcott]], who formed the society in 1875. During the society's annual convention of 1932, members celebrated the centenary of Colonel Olcott's birth by naming the headquarters campus after him. President Sidney A. Cook referred to the estate as "Olcott" in his annual report.&lt;ref&gt;Joy Mills, ''100 Years of Theosophy: A History of the Theosophical Society in America'' (Wheaton, Ill.: Theosophical Publishing House, 1987), 104-5.&lt;/ref&gt; For many years postal mail was delivered to "Olcott, Wheaton, Illinois."

==Theosophical Society use==
The main structure at Olcott is called the L. W. Rogers Building in honor of the national president in whose administration it was constructed. It looks out over a wide sweep of lawn toward the Main Street entrance gate, which has welcomed members and visitors since 1940. Designed by the eminent American architect, writer, and Theosophist [[Claude Fayette Bragdon]], the gate's pillars are capped by two of the five [[Platonic solid]]s, symbolizing the order inherent in the universe.  Many events held by the Society are held at Olcott Mansion, and the publishers of Quest magazine have their main offices at Olcott Mansion as well.

==Education use==
Olcott provides a summer school for members in conjunction with the Society’s Annual Meeting, usually in July, at which prominent Theosophical students gather to learn from one another. A number of these programs have been recorded and are posted online for free listening.  The Theosophical Society Department of Education also provides online courses as well as traditional correspondence courses.  The L. W. Rogers Building houses the Henry S. Olcott Memorial Library, which contains more than 18,000 titles of books, periodicals, and audio and video cassettes. The library is popular with students and inquirers who come to browse or to borrow from its extensive collection of philosophical and religious literature, rare books and archives.

==Location==
Olcott is located in Wheaton, IL, near the [[Billy Graham]] Center, a major [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] Christian organization and [[Cantigny Park]].  Many local college students utilize the Olcott Library, including students from nearby [[Wheaton College, Illinois|Wheaton College]], [[DePaul University]], [[North Central College]], and the [[College of DuPage]].

'''Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh''' (born '''Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/eng/1287056173925/1297368439340 Canadian Heritage]; [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/prince-philip/8566735/Prince-Philips-90th-birthday-a-life-less-ordinary-for-The-Duke-of-Edinburgh.html Daily Telegraph]; [http://news.sky.com/story/861428/the-life-and-times-of-the-royal-consort Sky News]; [https://www.royal.uk/the-duke-of-edinburgh Website of the Royal Family], all retrieved 10 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 10 June 1921),{{#tag:ref|He was born on 10&amp;nbsp;June 1921 according to the [[Gregorian calendar]]. Until 1&amp;nbsp;March 1923, Greece used the [[Julian calendar]], in which the date is 28&amp;nbsp;May 1921.|group=fn}} is the husband and [[Prince consort|consort]] of [[Queen Elizabeth II]].

Philip was born into the [[Greek royal family|Greek]] and [[Danish royal family|Danish royal families]]. He was born in [[Greece]], but his family was exiled from the country when he was an infant. After being educated in [[France]], [[Germany]], and the [[United Kingdom]], he joined the British [[Royal Navy]] in 1939, aged 18. From July 1939, he began corresponding with the 13-year-old Princess Elizabeth, whom he had first met in 1934. During the [[Second World War]] he served with distinction in the [[Mediterranean Fleet|Mediterranean]] and [[British Pacific Fleet|Pacific]] Fleets.

After the war, Philip was granted permission by [[King George VI]] to marry Elizabeth. Before the official announcement of their engagement in July 1947, he abandoned his Greek and Danish royal titles and became a naturalised [[British subject]], adopting the surname [[Mountbatten family|Mountbatten]] from his maternal grandparents. He [[Wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Philip Mountbatten|married Elizabeth]] on 20 November 1947. Just before the wedding, he was created [[Baron Greenwich]], [[Earl of Merioneth]] and [[Duke of Edinburgh]]. Philip left active military service when Elizabeth became monarch in 1952, having reached the rank of [[commander (Royal Navy)|commander]], and was formally made a [[British prince]] in 1957.

Prince Philip and Queen Elizabeth II have four children: [[Prince Charles]], [[Princess Anne]], [[Prince Andrew]], and [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Prince Edward]]. Through a British [[Order in Council]] issued in 1960, descendants of Philip and Elizabeth not bearing royal styles and titles can use the surname [[Mountbatten-Windsor]], which has also been used by some members of the royal family who do hold titles, such as Prince Andrew, Princess Anne and Prince Edward.

A keen sports enthusiast, Philip helped develop the equestrian event of [[carriage driving]]. He is a patron, president or member of over 780 organisations and serves as chairman of [[The Duke of Edinburgh's Award]] for people aged 14 to 24. He is the longest-serving consort of a reigning British monarch and the oldest-ever male member of the [[British royal family]]. Philip retired from his royal duties on 2 August 2017, at the age of 96, after having completed 22,219 solo engagements since 1952.

==Early life==
[[File:Corfu Mon Repos R01.jpg|left|thumb|[[Mon Repos, Corfu|Mon Repos]], the birthplace of Philip]]
Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark was born in [[Mon Repos, Corfu|Mon Repos]] on the Greek island of [[Corfu]] on 10 June 1921, the only son and fifth and final child of [[Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark]] and [[Princess Alice of Battenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Philip's four elder sisters were [[Princess Margarita of Greece and Denmark|Margarita]], [[Princess Theodora of Greece and Denmark (1906–1969)|Theodora]], [[Princess Cecilie of Greece and Denmark|Cecilie]], and [[Princess Sophie of Greece and Denmark|Sophie]]. He was baptised into the [[Greek Orthodox Church]]. His godparents were his paternal grandmother [[Queen Olga of Greece]] and Alexandros S. Kokotos, Mayor of Corfu.&lt;ref name="Yvonne"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.uniserve.com/~canyon/christenings.htm#Christenings|title=Yvonne's Royalty Home Page: Royal Christenings|website=users.uniserve.com|accessdate=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after Philip's birth, his maternal grandfather, [[Prince Louis of Battenberg]], then known as Louis Mountbatten, [[Marquess of Milford Haven]], died in London. Louis was a naturalised British citizen, who, after a career in the [[Royal Navy]], had renounced his German titles and adopted the surname [[Mountbatten family|Mountbatten]], an Anglicized version of [[Battenberg family|Battenberg]], during the First World War due to [[Anti-German sentiment#First World War#Great Britain|Anti-German sentiment]] in Great Britain. After visiting London for the memorial, Philip and his mother returned to Greece where Prince Andrew had remained behind to command an army division embroiled in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)]].&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, pp. 58–59&lt;/ref&gt;

The war went badly for Greece, and the Turks made large gains. On 22 September 1922, Philip's uncle, [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine I]], was forced to abdicate and the new military government arrested Prince Andrew, along with others. The commander of the army, General [[Georgios Hatzianestis]], and five senior [[Trial of the Six|politicians were executed]]. Prince Andrew's life was believed to be in danger, and Alice was under surveillance. In December, a revolutionary court banished Prince Andrew from Greece for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=News in Brief: Prince Andrew's Departure|journal=The Times|date=5 December 1922|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British naval vessel [[HMS Calypso (D61)|HMS ''Calypso'']] evacuated Prince Andrew's family, with Philip carried to safety in a cot made from a fruit box. Philip's family went to France, where they settled in the Paris suburb of [[Saint-Cloud]] in a house lent to them by his wealthy aunt, [[Princess George of Greece and Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra, pp. 35–37; Heald, p. 31; Vickers, pp. 176–178&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Philip left Greece as a baby, he does not have a strong grasp of the [[Greek language]]. In 1992, he said that he "could understand a certain amount".&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/a-strange-life-profile-of-prince-philip-1563268.html |work=The Independent |location=London | title=A strange life: Profile of Prince Philip | first=Fiammetta | last=Rocco | date=13 December 1992 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philip has stated that he has thought of himself as Danish, and his family spoke English, French, and German.&lt;ref name=independent /&gt; Philip, who in his youth was known for his charm, was linked to a number of women including [[Osla Benning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/romances-young-prince-philip/|title=The romances of young Prince Philip|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|first=Philip|last=Eade|date=5 May 2017|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youth==
===Education===

[[File:G House from the South Lawn on an Autumn Afternoon.jpg|thumb|Philip studied at [[Gordonstoun]] School, Scotland.]]

Philip was first educated at The Elms,&lt;ref name="basil"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boothroyd|first1=Basil|title=Prince Philip: An Informal Biography|date=1971|publisher=McCall Publishing Company|location=New York|isbn=0841501165|edition=First American}}&lt;/ref&gt; an American school in Paris run by Donald MacJannet, who described Philip as a "know it all smarty person, but always remarkably polite".&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra, p. 42; Heald, p. 34. Fellow pupils at the school included [[Queen Anne of Romania|Princess Anne of Bourbon]], who later married King [[Michael of Romania]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, he was sent to the United Kingdom to attend [[Cheam School]], living with his maternal grandmother, [[Victoria Mountbatten, Dowager Marchioness of Milford Haven]], at [[Kensington Palace]] and his uncle, [[George Mountbatten, 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven]], at Lynden Manor in [[Bray, Berkshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Heald, pp. 35–39&lt;/ref&gt; In the next three years, his four sisters married German noblemen and moved to Germany, his mother was placed in an asylum after being diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]],&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, p. 66; Vickers, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; and his father took up residence in [[Monte Carlo]].&lt;ref&gt;Eade, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; Philip had little contact with his mother for the remainder of his childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, he was sent to [[Schule Schloss Salem]] in Germany, which had the "advantage of saving school fees" because it was owned by the family of his brother-in-law, [[Berthold, Margrave of Baden]].&lt;ref&gt;Prince Philip quoted in Brandreth, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; With the rise of [[Nazism]] in Germany, Salem's Jewish founder, [[Kurt Hahn]], fled persecution and founded [[Gordonstoun]] School in Scotland. After two terms at Salem, Philip moved to Gordonstoun.&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, p. 72; Heald, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, his sister [[Princess Cecilie of Greece and Denmark|Cecilie]], her husband [[Georg Donatus, Hereditary Grand Duke of Hesse]], her two young sons, [[Prince Ludwig of Hesse and by Rhine|Ludwig]] and [[Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine (1933–1937)|Alexander]], her newborn infant and her mother-in-law, [[Princess Eleonore of Solms-Hohensolms-Lich]], were killed in [[Sabena OO-AUB Ostend crash|an air crash at Ostend]]; Philip, then sixteen years old, attended the funeral in [[Darmstadt]].&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, p. 69; Vickers, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--also in Heald--&gt; The following year, his uncle and guardian Lord Milford Haven died of [[bone marrow cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, pp. 77, 136&lt;!--Heald says cancer but does not specify--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naval and wartime service===
After leaving Gordonstoun in early 1939, Philip enrolled as a cadet at the [[Britannia Royal Naval College|Royal Naval College, Dartmouth]], until he was [[repatriate]]d to Greece, living with his mother in Athens for a month in mid-1939 when, at the behest of the Greek king, [[George II of Greece|George II]], he returned to Britain in September to resume training for the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;Eade, pp. 129–130; Vickers, pp. 284–285, 433&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from Dartmouth the next year as the best cadet in his course.&lt;ref name=royalgov&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/ThecurrentRoyalFamily/TheDukeofEdinburgh/Navalcareer.aspx |title=Naval career |publisher=Official website of the British Monarchy |accessdate=7 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529132154/http://www.royal.gov.uk/ThecurrentRoyalFamily/TheDukeofEdinburgh/Navalcareer.aspx |archivedate=29 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Second World War, he continued to serve in the British forces, while two of his brothers-in-law, [[Prince Christoph of Hesse]] and [[Berthold, Margrave of Baden]], fought on the opposing German side.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, pp. 293–295&lt;/ref&gt; Philip was appointed as a [[midshipman]] in January 1940.

In 1939, [[George VI|King George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]] toured the [[Britannia Royal Naval College|Royal Naval College, Dartmouth]]. During the visit, the Queen and Earl Mountbatten asked Philip to escort the King's two daughters, [[Elizabeth II|Elizabeth]] and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Margaret]], who were Philip's [[Royal descendants of Queen Victoria and King Christian IX#Monarchs descended from Queen Victoria|third cousins]] through [[Queen Victoria]], and [[Royal descendants of Queen Victoria and King Christian IX#Monarchs descended from King Christian IX|second cousins once removed]] through [[King Christian IX of Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexandra of Yugoslavia|Queen Alexandra of Yugoslavia]] quoted in Heald, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth fell in love with Philip and they began to exchange letters when she was thirteen.&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, pp. 132–136, 166–168&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, in the summer of 1946, Philip asked the King for his daughter's hand in marriage. The King granted his request, provided that any formal engagement be delayed until Elizabeth's twenty-first birthday the following April.&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; By March 1947, Philip had abandoned his Greek and Danish royal titles, had adopted the surname [[Mountbatten family|Mountbatten]] from his mother's family, and had become a naturalised British subject. The engagement was announced to the public on 10 July 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Heald, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Though Philip appeared "always to have regarded himself as an Anglican",&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 10 July 1947, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; and he had attended Anglican services with his classmates and relations in England and throughout his Royal Navy days, he had been baptised in the Greek Orthodox Church. The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Geoffrey Fisher]], wanted to "regularise" Philip's position by officially receiving him into the Church of England,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Boothroyd, Basil|authorlink=Basil Boothroyd|year=1971|title=Prince Philip: An Informal Biography|publisher=McCall|isbn=0841501165|pages=45–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he did in October 1947.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1947/10/04/archives/elizabeths-fiance-now-an-anglican.html "Elizabeth's Fiance Now an Anglican"] ''[[The New York Times]]'', 4 October 1947&lt;/ref&gt; The day preceding his wedding, King George VI bestowed the [[Style (manner of address)|style]] of ''[[Royal Highness]]'' on Philip and, on the morning of the wedding, 20 November 1947, he was made the [[Duke of Edinburgh]], [[Earl of Merioneth]], and [[Baron Greenwich]] of Greenwich in the County of London.&lt;ref name="LG 21 Nov 1947"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=38128|pages=5495–5496|date=21 November 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, being already a [[Knight of the Garter]], between 19 and 20 November 1947 he bore the unusual style His Royal Highness Sir Philip Mountbatten and is so described in the Letters Patent of 20 November 1947.&lt;ref name="LG 21 Nov 1947"/&gt;

Philip and Elizabeth were married in a ceremony at [[Westminster Abbey]], recorded and broadcast by [[BBC]] radio to 200&amp;nbsp;million people around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Heald, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; However, in post-war Britain, it was not acceptable for any of the Duke of Edinburgh's German relations to be invited to the wedding, including Philip's three surviving sisters, all of whom had married German princes, some with [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] connections. After their marriage, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh took up residence at [[Clarence House]]. Their first two children were born: [[Prince Charles]] in 1948 and [[Princess Anne]] in 1950. Their marriage is now the longest of any British sovereign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7101094.stm|title=Queen celebrates diamond wedding|date=19 November 2007|accessdate=10 February 2017|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/queen-elizabeth-II/9689130/Queen-and-Duke-of-Edinburgh-celebrate-65th-wedding-anniversary.html|title=Queen and Duke of Edinburgh celebrate 65th wedding anniversary|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=19 November 2012|accessdate=10 February 2017|first=Gordon|last=Rayner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He never spoke in the House.

After his honeymoon at the Mountbatten family home, [[Broadlands]], Philip returned to the navy at first in a desk job at [[the Admiralty]], and later on a staff course at the [[Royal Naval College (Greenwich)|Naval Staff College, Greenwich]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra, pp. 100, 105–106&lt;/ref&gt; From 1949, he was stationed in [[Malta]] (residing at [[Villa Guardamangia]]) after being posted as the first lieutenant of the destroyer [[HMS Chequers (R61)|HMS ''Chequers'']], the lead ship of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean Fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Heald, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 July 1950, he was promoted to [[Lieutenant commander (Royal Navy)|lieutenant commander]] and given command of the frigate [[HMS Magpie (U82)|HMS ''Magpie'']].&lt;ref&gt;Heald, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=38994 |supp=y|page=4152|date=15 August 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 June 1952, Philip was promoted to [[Commander (Royal Navy)|commander]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=39597 |supp=|page=3821|date=15 July 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; though his active naval career had ended in July 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/ThecurrentRoyalFamily/TheDukeofEdinburgh/Militaryinvolvement.aspx |title=The Duke of Edinburgh &gt; Military involvement |publisher=Official website of the British Monarchy |accessdate=7 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528151405/http://www.royal.gov.uk/ThecurrentRoyalFamily/TheDukeofEdinburgh/Militaryinvolvement.aspx |archivedate=28 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heald, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

With the King in ill health, Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh were both appointed to the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] on 4 November 1951, after a coast-to-coast tour of [[Canada]]. At the end of January 1952, Philip and his wife set out on a tour of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. On 6 February 1952, when they were in [[Kenya Colony|Kenya]], Elizabeth's father died and she became queen. It was Philip who broke the news of her father's death to Elizabeth at [[Sagana Lodge]], and the royal party immediately returned to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, pp. 245–247&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consort of the Queen==
[[File:Elizabeth and Philip 1953.jpg|thumb|right|[[Coronation of Elizabeth II|Coronation]] portrait of Queen Elizabeth II with the Duke of Edinburgh, June 1953, by [[Cecil Beaton]]]]

===Royal house===
The accession of Elizabeth to the throne brought up the question of the name of the [[royal house]]. The Duke's uncle, [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma]], advocated the name ''House of Mountbatten'', as Elizabeth would typically have taken Philip's last name on marriage; however, when [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]], Elizabeth's grandmother, heard of this suggestion, she informed the British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], who himself later advised the Queen to issue a royal proclamation declaring that the royal house was to remain known as the [[House of Windsor]]. Churchill's strong personal antipathy to Lord Mountbatten, whom he considered a dangerous and subversive rival who had lost India, may have contributed to this. Prince Philip privately complained, "I am nothing but a bloody amoeba. I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children."&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, pp. 253–254&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 February 1960, several years after the death of Queen Mary and the resignation of Churchill, the Queen issued an [[Order in Council]] declaring that ''[[Mountbatten-Windsor]]'' would be the surname of her and her husband's male-line descendants who are not styled as ''Royal Highness'' or titled as Prince or Princess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/41948/supplement/1003 | work=[[The London Gazette]]| title=Supplement to The London Gazette of Friday, 5th February 1960 | date=8 February 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it seems the Queen had "absolutely set her heart" on such a change and had it in mind for some time, it occurred only eleven days before the birth of [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Prince Andrew]] (19 February), and only after three months of protracted correspondence between constitutional expert [[Edward Iwi]] (who averred that, without such a change, the royal child would be born with "the Badge of Bastardy") and Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] who had attempted to rebuff Iwi.&lt;ref&gt;Travis, Alan (18 February 1999). [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/feb/18/monarchy "Queen feared 'slur' on family", ''The Guardian'']. Retrieved 17 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

After her accession to the throne, the Queen also announced that the Duke was to have "place, pre-eminence and precedence" next to her "on all occasions and in all meetings, except where otherwise provided by [[Act of Parliament]]". This meant the Duke took precedence over his son, the [[Prince of Wales]], except, officially, in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]]. In fact, however, he attends Parliament only when escorting the Queen for the annual [[State Opening of Parliament]], where he walks and sits beside her.&lt;ref&gt;British-Japanese Parliamentary Group.

Contrary to rumours over the years, the Queen and Duke are said by insiders to have had a strong relationship throughout their marriage, despite the challenges of Elizabeth's reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Love and Majesty|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/society/2012/01/queen-elizabeth-201201|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="itv"/&gt; The Queen referred to Prince Philip in a speech on the occasion of her Diamond Jubilee in 2012 as her "constant strength and guide".&lt;ref name="itv"&gt;{{cite news|title=Prince Philip: The Man At The Queen's Side|date=5 June 2012|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2012-06-05/prince-philip-the-man-at-the-queens-side/|publisher=ITV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duties and milestones===
As consort to the Queen, Philip supported his wife in her new duties as sovereign, accompanying her to ceremonies such as the [[State Opening of Parliament]] in various countries, state dinners, and tours abroad. As Chairman of the [[Coronation of the British monarch|Coronation]] Commission, he was the first member of the royal family to fly in a helicopter, visiting the troops that were to take part in the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; Philip was not crowned in the service, but knelt before Elizabeth, with her hands enclosing his, and swore to be her "liege man of life and limb".&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:StateLibQld 1 204880 Greeting Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, during the royal visit in 1954.jpg|left|upright|thumb|The Duke of Edinburgh in [[Brisbane]], Australia, in 1954]]

In the early 1950s, his sister-in-law, [[Princess Margaret]], considered marrying a divorced older man, [[Peter Townsend (RAF officer)|Peter Townsend]]. The press accused Philip of being hostile to the match, to which he replied "I haven't done anything." Philip had not interfered, preferring to stay out of other people's love lives.&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Margaret and Townsend parted. For six months, over 1953–54, Philip and Elizabeth toured the Commonwealth; again their children were left in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, the Duke, with [[Kurt Hahn]], founded [[The Duke of Edinburgh's Award]] in order to give young people "a sense of responsibility to themselves and their communities". In the same year, he also established the [[Commonwealth Study Conference]]s. From 1956 to 1957, Philip travelled around the world aboard the newly commissioned [[HMY Britannia|HMY ''Britannia'']], during which he opened the [[1956 Summer Olympics]] in Melbourne and visited the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]], becoming the first royal to cross the [[Antarctic Circle]].&lt;ref name="royanikkhah"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nikkhah|first1=Roya|title=Prince Philip: The Duke you don't know|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/8273569/Prince-Philip-the-Duke-you-dont-know.html|website=The Telegraph (UK)|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen and the children remained in the UK. On the return leg of the journey, Philip's private secretary, [[Michael Parker (courtier)|Mike Parker]], was sued for divorce by his wife. As with Townsend, the press still portrayed divorce as a scandal and eventually Parker resigned. He later said that the Duke was very supportive and "the Queen was wonderful throughout. She regarded divorce as a sadness, not a hanging offence."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Brandreth, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; In a public show of support, the Queen created Parker a Commander of the [[Royal Victorian Order]].&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, pp. 287, 289&lt;/ref&gt;

Further press reports claimed that the Queen and the Duke were drifting apart, which enraged the Duke and dismayed the Queen, who issued a strongly worded denial.&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 February 1957, she granted her husband the style and title of a Prince of the United Kingdom by [[Letters Patent]], and it was gazetted that he was to be known as "His Royal Highness The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh".&lt;ref name="prince"&gt;{{London Gazette |issue= 41009|date= 22 February 1957|page=1209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philip was appointed to the [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada]] on 14 October 1957, taking his [[Oath of Allegiance (Canada)|Oath of Allegiance]] before the Queen in person at her Canadian residence, [[Rideau Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bousfield|first=Arthur| author2=Toffoli, Gary| title=Fifty Years the Queen| publisher=Dundurn Press| year=2002|location=Toronto|page=12| url=https://books.google.com/?id=w8l5reK7NjoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=|isbn=1-55002-360-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remarks he made two years later to the [[Canadian Medical Association]] on the subject of youth and sport were taken as a suggestion that Canadian children were out of shape. This was at first considered "tactless", but Philip was later admired for his encouragement of physical fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/prince-philip-hrh-the-duke-of-edinburgh/| title=Prince Philip (HRH The Duke of Edinburgh)| work=The Canadian Encyclopedia| publisher=Historica Canada| accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada in 1969, Philip spoke about his views on republicanism:
{{Quote|It is a complete misconception to imagine that the monarchy exists in the interests of the monarch. It doesn't. It exists in the interests of the people. If at any time any nation decides that the system is unacceptable, then it is up to them to change it.&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Philip is [[Patronage|patron]] of some 800 organisations, particularly focused on the environment, industry, sport, and education.

At the beginning of 1981, Philip wrote to his eldest son, Charles, counselling him to make up his mind to either propose to [[Lady Diana Spencer]] or break off their courtship.&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, p. 344; Lacey, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; Charles felt pressured by his father to make a decision and did so, proposing to Diana in February.&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, p. 346; Lacey, pp. 277–278&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer|They married]] six months later.

By 1992, the marriage of the Prince and Princess of Wales had broken down. The Queen and Philip hosted a meeting between Charles and Diana, trying to effect a reconciliation, but without success.&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, pp. 348–349&lt;/ref&gt; Philip wrote to Diana, expressing his disappointment at both Charles's and her extra-marital affairs, and asking her to examine both his and her behaviour from the other's point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, pp. 349–351&lt;/ref&gt; She found the letters hard to take, but nevertheless she appreciated that he was acting with good intent.&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, pp. 351–353&lt;/ref&gt; Charles and Diana separated and later divorced.

A year after the divorce, [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|Diana was killed in a car crash]] in Paris on 31 August 1997. At the time, the Duke was on holiday at Balmoral with the extended royal family. In their grief, Diana's two sons, Princes [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|William]] and [[Prince Harry|Harry]], wanted to attend church and so their grandparents took them that morning.&lt;ref name=brandreth1&gt;Brandreth, p. 358&lt;/ref&gt; For five days, the Queen and the Duke shielded their grandsons from the ensuing press interest by keeping them at Balmoral, where they could grieve in private.&lt;ref name="brandreth1"/&gt; The royal family's seclusion caused public dismay,&lt;ref name=brandreth1 /&gt; but the public mood changed after a live broadcast made by the Queen on 5&amp;nbsp;September.&lt;ref name="brandreth2"&gt;Brandreth, p. 359&lt;/ref&gt; Uncertain as to whether they should walk behind her coffin during the [[Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales|funeral procession]], Diana's sons hesitated.&lt;ref name=brandreth2 /&gt; Philip told William, "If you don't walk, I think you'll regret it later. If I walk, will you walk with me?"&lt;ref name=brandreth2 /&gt; On the day of the funeral, Philip, William, Harry, Charles and Diana's brother, [[Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer|Earl Spencer]], walked through London behind her bier.

Over the next few years, [[Mohamed Fayed]], whose son [[Dodi Fayed]] was also killed in the crash, claimed that Prince Philip had ordered the death of Diana and that the accident was staged. The inquest into the Princess of Wales's death concluded in 2008 that there was no evidence of a conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7322204.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=Duke 'did not order Diana death' | date=31 March 2008 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince Philip retired from his royal duties on 2 August 2017, meeting Royal Marines in his final solo public engagement, aged 96. Since 1952 he had completed 22,219 solo engagements.

On 3 April 2018, Philip was admitted to the King Edward VII Hospital for a planned [[hip replacement]], which took place the next day. This came after the Duke missed the annual Maundy and Easter Sunday services. On 12 April his daughter, Princess Anne, spent about 50 minutes in the hospital and afterwards said her father was "on good form". He was discharged the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43755269|title=Duke of Edinburgh leaves hospital|date=13 April 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 May, six weeks later, he attended the [[Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle|wedding]] of his grandson Prince Harry to actress [[Meghan Markle]] and was able to walk with the Queen unaided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/topics/cpwpy79d6dxt/royal-wedding-2018|title=Royal Wedding 2018|website=BBC News|accessdate=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October that year, he accompanied the Queen to the [[Wedding of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank|wedding]] of their granddaughter [[Princess Eugenie]] to [[Jack Brooksbank]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/in-pictures-45829410|title=Princess Eugenie wedding in pictures: Splendid hats and gusts of wind|publisher=BBC News|date=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reporting that Philip works on a "wake up and see how I feel" basis when deciding whether to attend an event or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2018/10/09/duke-edinburgh-will-decide-day-attends-royal-wedding/|title=Duke of Edinburgh 'will decide at last moment' whether he attends royal wedding of Princess Eugenie|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Camilla|last=Tominey|date=9 October 2018|accessdate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality and image==
Philip played [[polo]] until 1971, when he started to compete in [[Combined driving|carriage driving]], a sport which he helped expand; the early rule book was drafted under his supervision.&lt;ref&gt;Heald, pp. 212–214&lt;/ref&gt; He was a keen yachtsman, striking up a friendship in 1949 with [[Uffa Fox]] in [[Cowes]]. He and the Queen regularly attended [[Cowes Week]] in [[HMY Britannia|HMY ''Britannia'']]. His first airborne flying lesson took place in 1952; by his 70th birthday he had accrued 5,150 pilot hours.&lt;ref&gt;Heald, pp. 148–149&lt;/ref&gt; He was presented with [[Royal Air Force]] wings in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Monarchy |first=British |url=https://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/ArmedForces/TheRoyalAirForce.aspx |title=The Royal Air Force |work=Official website of the British Monarchy |accessdate=6 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617152205/http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/ArmedForces/TheRoyalAirForce.aspx |archivedate=17 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, it was reported that an old [[British Pathe]] newsreel film had been discovered of Philip's 1962 two-month flying tour of [[South America]].

[[File:Her Majesty the Queen at Breakfast.jpg|thumb|left|''Her Majesty the Queen at Breakfast'' painted by her husband in 1957. Biographer [[Robert Lacey]] described the painting as "a tender portrayal, impressionistic in style, with brushstrokes that are charmingly soft and fuzzy".&lt;ref&gt;Lacey, p. 368&lt;/ref&gt;]]
He has painted with oils, and collected artworks, including contemporary [[cartoon]]s, which hang at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, Sandringham House, and Balmoral Castle. [[Hugh Casson]] described Philip's own artwork as "exactly what you'd expect&amp;nbsp;... totally direct, no hanging about. Strong colours, vigorous brushstrokes."&lt;ref&gt;Heald, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt;

His down-to-earth manner was attested to by a White House butler who recalled that, on a visit in 1979, Philip had engaged him and a fellow butler in a conversation, and poured them drinks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/18/obama-inauguration|location=London |newspaper=The Guardian| first=Christopher|last=Goodwin|title=I'm tickled to death.

It so happens that my mother was quite seriously deaf and I have been Patron of the Royal National Institute for the Deaf for ages, so it's hardly likely that I would do any such thing."&lt;ref&gt;Letter of 4 June 1999 quoted in Brandreth, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; When he and the Queen met Stephen Menary, an army cadet blinded by an IRA bomb, and the Queen enquired how much sight he retained, Philip quipped: "Not a lot, judging by the tie he's wearing."

I certainly didn't take any offence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/6805975/Duke-of-Edinburgh-gaffes-by-mocking-blind-boy.html|title=Duke of Edinburgh gaffes by mocking blind boy|last=Leach|first=By Ben|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a state visit to the People's Republic of China in 1986, in a private conversation with British students from [[Xi'an]]'s [[Northwest University (China)|North West University]], Philip joked, "If you stay here much longer, you'll go slit-eyed&lt;!--Prince Philip insists he said "slit-eyed" and not "slitty-eyed": see Heald, p. 245--&gt;."&lt;ref&gt;Heald, pp. 244–245; Lacey, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; The British press reported on the remark as indicative of racial intolerance, but the Chinese authorities were reportedly unconcerned. Chinese students studying in the UK, an official explained, were often told in jest not to stay away too long, lest they go "round-eyed".&lt;ref&gt;Lacey, p. 304; see also Heald, p. 245 for a Hong Kong version of the "round-eyed" joke.&lt;/ref&gt; His comment had no effect on [[China–United Kingdom relations|Sino-British relations]], but it shaped his own reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Heald, p. 246; Lacey, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt;

Philip has held a number of titles throughout his life. Originally holding the title and style of a [[prince of Greece and Denmark]], Philip abandoned these royal titles prior to his marriage, and was thereafter created a British [[duke]], among other noble titles. The Queen formally issued letters patent in 1957 making Philip a [[British prince]].&lt;ref name=prince /&gt;

When addressing the Duke of Edinburgh, as with any male member of the royal family except the monarch, the rules of etiquette are to address him the first time as ''Your Royal Highness'', and thereafter as ''Sir''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112125544/http://www.debretts.com/etiquette/british-behaviour/r-to-s/royalty.aspx|title=Royalty – Debrett's Guide to British Behaviour|date=12 November 2010|publisher=|accessdate=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honours and honorary military appointments===
The Duke of Edinburgh was appointed by King George VI to the [[Order of the Garter]] on 19 November 1947, the eve of his wedding. Since then, Philip has received 17 different appointments and decorations in the Commonwealth, and 48 from foreign states. The inhabitants of some villages on the island of [[Tanna (island)|Tanna, Vanuatu]] [[Prince Philip Movement|worship Prince Philip as a god]]; the islanders possess portraits of the Duke and hold feasts on his birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Squires|first=Nick|title=Is Prince Philip an island god?|publisher=BBC News|date=10 June 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6734469.stm|accessdate=12 October 2008|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancestry==
Philip is a great-grandson of [[Christian IX of Denmark]], and as such belongs in male line to the Danish [[House of Glücksburg]], originally a [[cadet branch]] of the [[House of Oldenburg]], which held several thrones and provided consorts to rulers of Russia and Great Britain in the 19th and 20th centuries.

In 1993, scientists were able to confirm the identity of the remains of several members of [[Empress Alexandra of Russia]]'s family, more than seventy years after their [[execution of the Romanov family|massacre in 1918]], by comparing their [[mitochondrial DNA]] to living [[matrilineal]] relatives, including Prince Philip, her maternal grandnephew. Philip, Alexandra and her children are all descended from [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom]], the daughter of [[Queen Victoria]], through a purely female line.&lt;ref name=gill&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gill |first1=Peter |last2=Ivanov |first2=Pavel L. |last3=Kimpton |first3=Colin |last4=Piercy |first4=Romelle |last5=Benson |first5=Nicola |last6=Tully |first6=Gillian |last7=Evett |first7=Ian |last8=Hagelberg |first8=Erika |last9=Sullivan |first9=Kevin |date=February 1994 |title=Identification of the remains of the Romanov family by DNA analysis |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=130–135 |doi=10.1038/ng0294-130 |pmid=8162066 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eastern Orthodox Christianity ==
{{main|Eastern Orthodoxy in Montenegro}}
[[File:Monasterio de Ostrog, Montenegro, 2014-04-14, DD 14.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Ostrog Monastery]]]]
Orthodox Christianity is the dominant religion in Montenegro. Adherents of Orthodox Christianity in Montenegro are predominantly [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]] and [[Serbs]]. Ethnic Serbs in Montenegro are adherents of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] and its dioceses in Montenegro: [[Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral]], [[Eparchy of Budimlja and Nikšić]] and [[Eparchy of Mileševa]]. Ethnic Montenegrins are divided between the Serbian Orthodox Church and the [[Montenegrin Orthodox Church]] (which is still in its phase of conceivement and is non-canonical and unrecognized).

The current Metropolitan bishop is [[Amfilohije Radović]].  He is a vocal supporter of Russia and has repeatedly denounced NATO; calling its actions similar to that of the Ottoman Empire and that the organization is a "national fascist pact."&lt;ref&gt;Milica Minić. "A Serbian priest in anti-NATO campaign" [http://www.cdm.me/english/a-serbian-priest-in-anti-nato-campaign-they-want-to-have-a-catholic-priest-a-hodja-and-a-rabbi-among ''CDM'' 17 Aug. 2016] &lt;/ref&gt;

== Islam ==
{{main|Islam in Montenegro}}
[[File:Pljevlja City-center Mosque.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Husein-paša's Mosque]] in [[Pljevlja]]]]
[[Muslims]] form the largest minority religion in the country. Montenegro's 118,477 Muslims make up 19.11% of the total population.&lt;ref name="monstat 2011"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims in Montenegro are divided into two main groups, and further subgroups:

*[[Muslim Slavs|Slavic]] Muslims
**[[Bosnian language|Bosnian-speaking]] ethnic [[Bosniak]] Muslims
**[[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin-speaking]] ethnic [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrin Muslims]]
**Other Slavic Muslims ([[Muslims by nationality]]), including [[Gorani people|Gorani]], and other Slavs of the Muslim faith who identify by religion rather than by ethnicity. 
*[[Albanians|Albanian]] Muslims
**[[Albanian language|Albanian-speaking]] ethnic [[Albanians|Albanian]] Muslims

Islam is the dominant religion in the northeastern municipalities, which are part of the [[Sandžak]] geographical region, and in municipalities where Albanians form a majority. Islam is the majority religion in [[Rožaje]], [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]], [[Gusinje]], [[Ulcinj]] and [[Petnjica]].

== Catholic Church ==
{{main|Catholic Church in Montenegro}} 

[[File:Marktplatz Kotor 2014.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Kotor Cathedral|St. Tryphon's Cathedral]] in [[Kotor]]]]
Catholic Christianity is mostly present in the region of [[Boka Kotorska]], where there is a significant presence of ethnic [[Croats]]. Also, a number of ethnic [[Albanians]] are adherents of Catholic Christianity.

According to [http://www.cnewacanada.ca/ecc-bodypg-ca.aspx?eccpageID=73&amp;IndexView=toc CNEWA Canada] Catholics of the [[Byzantine Rite]] number over 20 000 persons in the regions of Montenegro and Serbia: 
 
In 2003 an Apostolic Exarchate was created for [[Eastern Catholicism|Greek Catholics]] in Serbia and Montenegro, headed by Bishop Djura Džudžar (born 1954, appointed 2003). It has 21 parishes and 22,720 faithful, consisting mostly of a group of ethnic Rusyn Greek Catholics in the region of Vojvodina.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnewacanada.ca/ecc-bodypg-ca.aspx?eccpageID=73&amp;IndexView=toc&lt;/ref&gt;

== Judaism ==
{{Main|History of the Jews in Montenegro}}

In February 2012, the Montenegrin Prime Minister [[Igor Lukšić]] signed an agreement with the Montenegrin Jewish community to grant official recognition of Jews as a minority in Montenegro. The agreement also established [[Judaism]] as the country's fourth official religion, along with the Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Christianity, and Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Montenegro.html |title=Jewish history of Montenegro |publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |accessdate=2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Atheism ==
The majority of Montenegro's population, 98.69%, declares to belong to a religion, though observance of their declared religion may vary widely.

On the census from 2011, atheists, those who declared no religion, comprised about 1.24% of the whole population, and agnostics 0.07%. 

Religiosity is lowest in the [[Bay of Kotor]] region and the capital city of [[Podgorica]]. 

Municipalities with highest share of atheists are [[Herceg Novi]] (2.43%), [[Kotor]] (2.03%), [[Podgorica]] (1.99%) and [[Tivat]] (1.7%). In contrast, [[Rožaje]] has the fewest atheists, who make up only 0.01% of its population.&lt;ref name="monstat 2011"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In some municipalities more than half of population are undeclared, however.

A '''religious community''' is a [[community]] (group of people) who practice the same [[religion]]. The term is used in a wider sense and a different narrower sense. People who define themselves as having a particular religion are considered to be members of the religion's community. 

In the wider sense, the term is used to refer to members of one religion who may live in groups, or near or intermingled with members of other religions. Community members may mix with others in everyday life, but worship separately, typically in a dedicated [[temple]] such as a [[church (building)|church]] or [[mosque]]. One might speak of the Catholic community of [[Belfast]] (a city), or the Jewish community of France (a country). In other cases, a person must be formally accepted by community authorities to become acknowledged as a member. In Israel only couples both from the same officially recognized religious community [[marriage in Israel|may marry]].

The term is also used in a different, narrower sense to mean a group of people of the same religion living together specifically for religious purposes, often subject to formal commitments such as [[religious vows]],  as in a [[monastery]].&lt;ref name="Deegan"/&gt;

== Types of Christian Communities ==

=== Order ===
Orders are Institutes in which solemn vows are made by at least some of the members. All members of these orders are called regulars, and if they are women they are called nuns ("moniales"). Additionally, Orders are typically dated in history as older than Congregations.

=== Congregations ===
A group of people assembled for religious worship. The Catholic [[Congregation (Catholic)|congregation]] in the Roman Curia is the most notable congregation.

=== Clerical ===
These Christian [[Institutes of the Christian Religion|institutes]], in accordance with the intentions of the Founder or by reason of legitimate tradition, are governed by [[Clergy|clerics]], assume the exercise of sacred Orders, and are recognized by the Church as clerical Institutes.

=== Lay ===
Lay, also known as lay affiliates or associates, play an important part in a religious community. Men and women who take part, formally, in a religious community, to make their mission and spirituality, and have great influence on the like of the community are known as lay affiliates. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://anunslife.org/blog/nun-talk/the-role-of-lay-associates-in-religious-life}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Canons Regular ===
Canons regular 
=== Monastic Orders ===

=== Mendicant Orders ===

=== Clerks Regular ===

=== Clerical Religious Congregations ===

=== Lay Religious Congregations ===

Lay religious communities include groups such as the Hutterites, [[Bruderhof Communities|Bruderhof]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bruderhof|title=Bruderhof - Why Community|date=2012-01-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pBrSi5jld8|accessdate=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Amish and some Mennonite churches.  Some of these communities are tightly-bound, such as the Bruderhof&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsmax.com/FastFeatures/bruderhof-christians-beliefs-set/2015/05/07/id/643320/|title=5 Beliefs That Set the Bruderhof Apart From Other Christians|work=Newsmax|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hutterites&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/hutterites/|title=Hutterites|last=Ryan|first=John|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The Amish and similar groups tend to be more loosely formed, but still act in a communal way.  All of these communities will claim to be Christ-centred.

'''Rhoda Wise''' (February 22, 1888 &amp;ndash; July 7, 1948) was an [[United States|American]] [[Catholic]] [[Stigmata|stigmatist]] and mystic from [[Canton, Ohio]] (originally in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Cleveland]] and now part of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Youngstown|Diocese of Youngstown]]). Between 1939 and her death in 1948, Wise reported seeing regular visions of [[Jesus Christ]] and Saint [[Thérèse of Lisieux]] in her Canton home. Wise has been associated with a number of sudden and unexplained healings, including the healing of [[Mother Angelica]], the founder of the Catholic television network [[EWTN]], from a painful stomach ailment.&lt;ref name="Hoopes"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Hoopes|first=Tom|authorlink=|coauthors=|date=December 2005|title=Love Bears Fruit: The Triumph of Mother Angelica|journal=Crisis Magazine|url=http://www.crisismagazine.com/december2005/hoopes.htm|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029101115/http://crisismagazine.com/december2005/hoopes.htm|archive-date=2006-10-29|access-date=2017-11-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, [[Bishop]] [[George V. Murry]] of the Diocese of Youngstown declared Wise a [[Servant of God]] as a first step towards her possible [[canonization]] as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=lambo&gt;{{cite news |last=Lambo |first=Ann-Margaret |date=2016-12-31 |title=Diocese opens sainthood cause for Ohio woman known for healing gifts |url=https://cruxnow.com/church-in-the-usa/2016/12/31/diocese-opens-sainthood-cause-ohio-woman-known-healing-gifts/ |dead-url=no |work=Crux |agency=Catholic News Service |location= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102164438/https://cruxnow.com/church-in-the-usa/2016/12/31/diocese-opens-sainthood-cause-ohio-woman-known-healing-gifts/ |archive-date=2017-01-02 |access-date=2017-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Rhoda Wise was born Rhoda Greer on February 22, 1888, in [[Cadiz, Ohio]] to bricklayer Eli Greer and his wife Anna, the sixth of their eight children. When she was two years old, the Greer family moved to [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], where she was raised as a [[Protestant]]. In 1915, she married Ernest Wissmar and moved with him to Canton, Ohio, where Wissmar suddenly died of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] six months later. She then married George Wise in 1917, and the couple continued to live in the Canton area and adopted two daughters, one of whom died in infancy. George Wise was an [[alcoholic]] and changed jobs frequently, resulting in financial hardship and embarrassment for the family. The Wise family lived at seven different addresses; by the early 1930s, they were occupying a three-room "depression shack" house near the Canton city dump.&lt;ref name=sigler&gt;{{cite book |last=Sigler, O.F.S. |first=Karen |date=2000 |title=Her Name Means Rose: The Rhoda Wise Story |url= |location=Birmingham, Alabama |publisher=EWTN Catholic Publisher |pages=5–20 |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stratford&gt;{{cite news |last=Stratford |first=Suzanne |date=2016-10-06 |title=Process of sainthood starts for Canton woman who owned ‘miracle house’ |url=http://fox8.com/2016/10/06/process-of-sainthood-starts-for-canton-woman-who-owned-miracle-house/ |dead-url=no |work=Fox 8 News (WJW) |location=Cleveland, Ohio |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012060603/http://fox8.com/2016/10/06/process-of-sainthood-starts-for-canton-woman-who-owned-miracle-house/ |archive-date=2016-10-12 |access-date=2017-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the early 1930s, Rhoda Wise developed serious health problems, including a 39-pound [[ovarian cyst]] that had to be surgically removed, and a broken foot which failed to heal properly and caused her to suffer pain and difficulty in walking. She was hospitalized frequently and underwent a number of operations for abdominal and foot problems. In late 1933 she was briefly committed to the state [[mental hospital]] by her husband, where she was diagnosed with post-operative [[psychosis]] stemming from her surgeries. She spent two separate periods of fourteen days in the mental hospital before being discharged when her condition improved. During a 1936 stay at a Canton hospital operated by the [[Sisters of Charity of St. Augustine]], Wise befriended one of the sisters, who taught her to pray the [[Rosary]] and told her about Saint Thérèse of Lisieux. Wise began to pray regularly to Saint Therese, and also became devoted to the [[Sacred Heart]] of Jesus. In December 1938, Wise decided to convert to Catholicism, and was received into the Catholic Church in January 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Sigler, pp. 21-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1939, Wise was diagnosed with incurable [[stomach cancer]], discharged from the hospital and sent home to die. According to Wise, she experienced an apparition of Jesus Christ on May 28, 1939 at her home, during which Jesus told her that he would come again with Saint Therese the following month on June 28. Wise reported that Jesus and Saint Therese both appeared on June 28, and during their visit, cured Wise of her stomach cancer, including healing a large open wound on her abdomen caused by her multiple surgeries, from which her bowel had been protruding. Wise further reported that in August 1939, Saint Therese miraculously healed her injured foot, causing the heavy cast then on it to split and fall off in the process.&lt;ref&gt;Sigler, pp. 38-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1939 to 1948, Wise said that she experienced annual apparitions of Jesus and Saint Therese, including a visit by Saint Therese on January 2, the saint's birthday, every year. Wise's reported visions totaled 28 at the time of her death in 1948.&lt;ref name=advance&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=1948-07-30 |title=Funeral rites held for Ohio woman who claimed 28 visions |page=2 |work=The Advance Register |location=Wichita, Kansas |via=Newspapers.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wise was inspired by these visions to offer herself as a [[victim soul]] to save the souls of others, particularly priests and members of religious orders. On [[Good Friday]], April 3, 1942, bleeding [[stigmata]] appeared on Wise's forehead and continued to appear and bleed at intervals over the next two years. In 1943, bleeding stigmata appeared on her hands and feet as well as her forehead. The bleeding stigmata were witnessed by many visitors to the Wise home. In her final apparition of Jesus, on June 28, 1948, Wise said that Jesus asked her to say the Rosary daily for the Conversion of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Sigler, pp. 60-146.&lt;/ref&gt;

The stories of Wise's experiences spread, causing hundreds of people to write to Wise and visit her home seeking physical healing and other spiritual help.&lt;ref&gt;Sigler, p. 74, 147&lt;/ref&gt; Large crowds also gathered outside the Wise home on nights when Wise said that she was expecting an apparition.&lt;ref&gt;Sigler, p. 181 (photograph).&lt;/ref&gt; Many people credited Wise with miraculous cures after they had visited her home or received [[holy water]] from her home, and she developed a reputation as a "miracle woman".&lt;ref name=stratford /&gt;&lt;ref name=kane&gt;{{cite news |last=Kane |first=Ruth |date=1949-07-17 |title=Miracle Woman's House Still Attracts Throngs: Rhoda Wise's Canton Home a 'Shrine' |work=Akron Beacon Journal |url=  |location=Akron, Ohio |page=10B |via=Newspapers.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943,
Rita Rizzo, a Canton teenager who later became known as [[Mother Angelica]], was taken to see Wise by her mother, seeking a cure for Rizzo's painful chronic stomach ailment. Mother Angelica later recounted how Wise led the doubting and ailing Rizzo in a [[novena]] to Saint Therese. At the end of nine days of prayer, Rizzo's stomach condition suddenly disappeared. She eventually became a nun under Wise's mentorship.&lt;ref name="Hoopes"/&gt;

After suffering a [[stroke]] in early July 1948, Wise died of [[hypertension]] on July 7, 1948, in her Canton home.&lt;ref&gt;Sigler, p. 148-149.&lt;/ref&gt; During the two days prior to her funeral, over 14,000 people reportedly visited her bier.&lt;ref name=advance /&gt; Religious pilgrims, many from outside Ohio, continued to visit the Wise home even after her death and credit her with miraculous cures.&lt;ref name=kane /&gt;

==Possible canonization==

In November 2012, the Diocese of Youngstown began to conduct an informal investigation into the life and writings of Rhoda Wise to determine if she might be a candidate for sainthood in the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;Sigler, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; Following this investigation, in 2016, Bishop George V. Murry of the Diocese of Youngstown declared Wise a Servant of God, the first step on the path to sainthood. A formal Diocesan inquiry was launched to determine whether she may be beatified and ultimately canonized as a saint.&lt;ref name=lambo /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sigler, p. 203 (photograph of bishop's Edict for the opening of Rhoda Wise's beatification cause).&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2018, the results of the Diocesan investigation were submitted to the Vatican.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Goshay |first=Charita |date=2018-07-06 |title=Rhoda Wise sainthood case heads to Vatican |url=http://www.cantonrep.com/entertainmentlife/20180706/rhoda-wise-sainthood-case-heads-to-vatican |dead-url=no |work=Canton Repository |location=Canton, Ohio |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706174247/http://www.cantonrep.com/entertainmentlife/20180706/rhoda-wise-sainthood-case-heads-to-vatican |archive-date=2018-07-06 |access-date=2018-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Grotto of the Sacred Heart and Little Flower.jpg|thumb|The Grotto of the Sacred Heart and Little Flower at the Rhoda Wise Shrine, August 2017]]After Wise's death, her adult daughter Anna Mae Wise continued to welcome pilgrims to the Wise family home in Canton, keeping it open to the public for 47 years. When Anna Mae died in 1995, she willed the home to Mother Angelica and EWTN, who kept the house open to visitors. In 2001 the house was renovated and several structural problems repaired, but the bedroom which was the site of the claimed apparitions was left intact. A separate prayer chapel, the Grotto of the Sacred Heart and Little Flower, was erected in 2003 next to the house.&lt;ref&gt;Sigler, p. 152-155, 196-197.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rhoda Wise Shrine, including the house, grounds and prayer chapel, is now a private [[association of the faithful]] that has been approved for visitors' devotions by Bishop Murry of the Diocese of Youngstown.&lt;ref&gt;Sigler, p. 201 (photograph of Bishop's decree document).&lt;/ref&gt;

A biography of Wise, ''Her Name Means Rose: The Rhoda Wise Story'' by Karen Sigler O.F.S., was published by EWTN in 2000.

'''Roger''' is a fictional character in the [[adult animation|adult]] [[animated sitcom]] ''[[American Dad!]]'', voiced by [[Seth MacFarlane]]. The character was created and designed by Seth MacFarlane. Roger is a centuries-year-old [[grey alien|grey space alien]] living with [[List of American Dad! characters#Main characters|the Smith family]], around whom the show revolves. Having lived on Earth since crashing in [[Roswell, New Mexico]] in 1947, Roger came to live with the Smiths after rescuing main character [[Stan Smith (American Dad!)|Stan Smith]] at [[Area 51]] four years prior to the beginning of the series.&lt;ref name="ovguide1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ovguide.com/roger-9202a8c04000641f80000000008d8419 |title=Roger Video &amp;#124; Movie Clips &amp; Character Interview |publisher=Ovguide.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521175723/http://www.ovguide.com/roger-9202a8c04000641f80000000008d8419 |archivedate=2013-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McEwen |first=Lauren |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/therootdc/post/american-dad-one-of-the-most-sophisticated-mainstream-shows-on-african-american-culture/2012/10/08/e8374cba-051d-11e2-91e7-2962c74e7738_blog.html |title='American Dad': One of the most sophisticated mainstream shows on African American culture - The Root DC Live |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2012-10-08 |accessdate=2013-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger began the series as a sensitive pushover who is often taken advantage of, cheated, and ridiculed. Over time, the character has become a textbook [[psychopath]], exhibiting increasingly cruel, selfish, devious, and depraved behavior,&lt;ref name="ovguide1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="avclub4"&gt;{{cite web|author=Todd VanDerWerff September 28, 2012 |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/comedy-showrunners-week-american-dads-cocreators-o,85507/ |title=Comedy Showrunners Week: American Dad's co-creators on the show's weird evolution &amp;#124; TV &amp;#124; Interview |publisher=The A.V. Club |date=2012-09-28 |accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the Smith family are curiously oblivious to his nature despite being his most frequent victims. In early episodes of the show, Roger is disallowed from leaving the Smith house in order to conceal his being an alien.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|author=AWN |url=http://www.awn.com/articles/people/iamerican-dadi-touchdown |title=American Dad Touchdown &amp;#124; AWN &amp;#124; |publisher=AWN |date=|accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This restriction is soon abandoned and Roger begins adopting disguises and fictitious personas in order to have a life outside the house.

Roger's personas have become a major [[plot device]], with his myriad alter egos frequently being the subject or facilitator of an episode's main story or [[subplot]]. This also helps to amplify his [[pansexuality]] and [[androgynous]] nature, which varies dependent on the plot situation and persona he has adopted. Aside from catalyzing the plot or subplot with his various personas, and despite his increasingly evident self-interest, he often serves to counsel the show's main characters, by humorously affirming or bluntly disregarding their opinions.

When voicing the character, MacFarlane speaks in a [[Swish (slang)|swish]] accent intended to resemble [[Paul Lynde]] (who played Uncle Arthur in ''[[Bewitched]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bullz-eye.com/television/interviews/2007/seth_macfarlane_01.htm|title=A Chat with Seth MacFarlane|work=Bullz-eye.com|date=2007-05-21|accessdate=2010-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Roger was voted "Gayest Cartoon Character of All Time" in a first-ever March Madness style competition held by [[Logo TV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/08/roger-gayest-cartoon_n_5112731.html |title=Roger Of ‘American Dad’ Crowned LOGO’s ‘Gayest Cartoon Of All Time’ |last=Nichols |first=James |date=2014-04-08 |website=www.huffingtonpost.com |publisher=The Huffington Post |access-date=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character==
Roger is selfish, cynical, and cruel but deeply sensitive. Having his feelings hurt usually spurs the creation of his egos and schemes. Roger typically displays a lighthearted, carefree temperament while at the same time engaging in his freakish grossness, outrageous malice, and rascally shenanigans.&lt;ref name="ovguide1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="avclub4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="avclub3"&gt;{{cite web|last=McFarland |first=Kevin |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/naked-to-the-limit-one-more-time,92287/ |title="Naked To The Limit, One More Time" &amp;#124; American Dad &amp;#124; TV Club &amp;#124; TV |publisher=The A.V. Club |date=February 18, 2013 |accessdate=April 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crude and brazen, Roger has no qualms with randomly saying and doing whatever is on his mind, having little to no sympathy for anyone who might suffer as a result of his actions, and regularly misleading and finagling others to achieve his desired ends. However, according to the episode "[[American Dad! (season 4)#Episodes|Frannie 911]]", Roger is not this unpleasant by nature; his species of alien must let all unpleasantries out, for if they don't, it will turn into poison and kill them.

=== History ===
Also according to "Frannie 911", Roger has been on earth for over 60 years, having [[Roswell UFO incident|arrived in 1947]] as a result of being tricked,&lt;ref name="americandadscripts1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americandadscripts.com/S03E09_Frannie-911.php|title=American Dad Scripts|date=|publisher=American Dad Scripts|accessdate=2013-06-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104200526/http://www.americandadscripts.com/S03E09_Frannie-911.php|archivedate=2013-01-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; led to believe she was "The Decider" in whose hands the fate of mankind rested. Earlier, after causing his aunt’s spaceship to crash, Roger lived with a family of pioneer fur trappers that died travelling on the [[Oregon Trail]] in the episode OreTron Trail. There is also the possibility, he or another member of his race came to earth in early antiquity, as in the first episode of the 13th season a stone carving is shown depicting an alien looking like Roger squatting above a pyramid with two Egyptians presumably praising him and hieroglyph characters surrounding them. In the episode "[[American Dad! (season 9)|Naked to the Limit, One More Time]]" however, it is evidenced that Roger remains on Earth by will, the episode revealing that he can simply call for his aliens' spaceship to return him to his birth planet if he so desires.

Details on Roger's actual family and pre-Earth life have yet to be shown on the series. Although in the episode "[[Lost in Space (American Dad!)|Lost in Space]]", a brief clip revealed that prior to Roger's life on Earth, he was involved in a [[homosexuality|homosexual]] romantic relationship with another member of his alien race, Zing; however, Roger [[adultery|cheated]] on Zing, blatantly making out with a human male in front of him. It's also been revealed that Roger has lived on Earth for many years prior to his life spent with the Smith family.

Roger came into contact with the Smith family when he saved Stan's life back when Roger was a fugitive of [[Area 51]] (four years prior to the show's beginnings). Feeling he owed Roger a life debt because of this, Stan rescued him from government capture and allowed him to live in his home. Stan has allowed this in defiance of his employer, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. Roger now covertly lives in the Smith home. Roger uses the Smith's attic as his hideout/room/bar.

=== Roger's disguises ===
After Stan took Roger in for saving his life, he felt that it would endanger him and the rest of his family if it were to be discovered that Roger is an alien and living with them. Consequently, Stan disallowed him from leaving the house when the series first began, even in disguise. Confined to the house in the first couple of seasons, Roger was miserable and malcontent.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; However, Roger is able to skillfully use disguises to exist in the outside world, which has become a major [[plot device]] in later episodes. Adding to this, he's created countless [[alter ego]]s to go along with them.&lt;ref name="avclub3" /&gt;

Roger has, however, abused this practice, leading numerous lives and outrageously deceiving numerous people. In fact, some of Roger's characters are in [[prison]], while others are widely despised, and others somehow have full-fledged human families and are even married; several of his characters somehow have birth children while others are graduates of [[Howard University]]. Roger also uses several of these personas to act in a criminal manner, as several of his alter egos have been seen to engage in robbery, sexual assault, police corruption, identity theft, drug trafficking, child abuse and with one persona even admitting to being wanted "for a series of prostitute murders".

Despite his numerous disguises consisting of only a different set of garment and hair with no effort to disguise his gray skin, [[non-human]] face and body features (with some exceptions, like additional body weight, facial hair or wrinkles), Roger has been capable of deceiving virtually every single person he interacts with without ever being discovered as an alien; not even by Stan's colleagues from [[CIA]], who according to him, have "an entire floor" looking for Roger. The Smith family is the only exception; however, for each member of the family there is one individual alter ego they can not recognize as Roger. On top of that, Roger has been sent to the hospital several times over the course of the series, and medical personnel, for some reason, have never found out that he's not a human.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title="American Dad!" Roger Passes the Bar (TV Episode 2014)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3910988/|accessdate=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential film adaptation==
At [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con 2013]] on July 20, Mike Barker revealed that an ''American Dad!'' film centering on Roger and set on his birth planet may take place in the future. Barker did not announce any specifics as it relates to the nature and type of film he and the rest of the show's creators had in mind for the series; however, he strongly suggested that a film is where the show's staff and creators would like to take things. Barker further hinted that an ''American Dad!'' film may already be in the works and partially written.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=' + data.results.personName + ' |url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/07/comic-con-2013-american-dad-season-10-guest-stars-include-zooey-deschanel-alison-brie-and-mariah-car.html |title=Comic-Con 2013: 'American Dad' Season 10 guest stars include Zooey Deschanel, Alison Brie and Mariah Carey - Zap2it |publisher=Blog.zap2it.com |date=2013-07-20 |accessdate=2013-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822112804/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/07/comic-con-2013-american-dad-season-10-guest-stars-include-zooey-deschanel-alison-brie-and-mariah-car.html |archivedate=2013-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sant Ravidas Ki Amar Kahani''''' is [[Bollywood films of 1983|1983]] [[India]]n devotional movie based on renowned saint [[Ravidas]], directed by [[Babubhai Mistri]], with music by [[Chitragupt]]. Ravidas (also Raidas, Rohidas[1] and Ruhidas in eastern India) was a North Indian Sant mystic of the bhakti movement who was active in the 15th century CE. Venerated in the region of Uttar Pradesh as well as the Indian state of Maharashtra, his devotional songs and verses made a lasting impact upon the bhakti movement. He is often given the honorific "Bhagat" or "Sant". This film was released on 1 January 1983 in Hindi language.

==Synopsis==
A shoemaker of the Chamar caste, all of his devotional songs were preserved included in the Sikh holy book, the Adi Granth, by the fifth Sikh Guru, Guru Arjan Dev.[2] There is also a larger body of hymns passed on independently that is claimed and attributed by some to Ravidas ji. Ravidas was subversive in that his devotionalism implied a levelling of the social divisions of caste and gender, yet ecumenical in that it tended to promote crossing of sectarian divides in the name of a higher spiritual unity.[3] He taught that one is distinguished not by one's caste (jāti) but by one's actions (karma) and that every person has the right to worship God and read holy texts.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0242847/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ehZdZYoHBY&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.induna.com/1000002863-productdetails/&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;div class="thumbcaption"&gt;Some examples of Shinto architecture&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

'''Shinto architecture''' is the architecture of [[Japan]]ese [[Shinto]] [[Shinto shrine|shrine]]s.

With a few exceptions, the general blueprint of a Shinto shrine is Buddhist in origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Buddhism, shrines were just temporary structures erected to a particular purpose. Buddhism brought to Japan the idea of permanent shrines and much of Shinto architecture's vocabulary. The presence of verandas, [[Tōrō|stone lanterns]], and elaborate gates are examples of this influence.

The composition of a Shinto shrine is extremely variable, and none of its possible features are necessarily present. Even the ''[[honden]]'' or sanctuary, the part which houses the ''[[kami]]'' and which is the centerpiece of a shrine, can be missing. However, since its grounds are sacred, they usually are surrounded by a fence made of stone or wood called ''[[tamagaki]]'', while access is made possible by an approach called ''[[sandō]]''. The entrances themselves are straddled by gates called ''[[torii]]'', which are therefore the simplest way to identify a Shinto shrine.

A shrine may include within its grounds several structures, each destined to a different purpose.&lt;ref name="HoS"&gt;[http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=696 The History of Shrines], ''Encyclopedia of Shinto'', retrieved on June 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Among them are the ''honden'' or sanctuary, where the ''kami'' are enshrined,  the ''[[heiden (Shinto)|heiden]]'', or hall of offerings, where offers and prayers are presented, and the ''[[Haiden (Shinto)|haiden]]'' or hall of worship, where there may be seats for worshipers.&lt;ref name="HoS"/&gt; The ''[[honden]]'' is the building that contains the ''[[shintai]]'', literally, "the sacred body of the kami". Of these, only the ''haiden'' is open to the [[laity]]. The ''honden'' is located behind the ''haiden'' and is usually much smaller and unadorned. Other notable shrine features are the ''[[Chōzuya|temizuya]]'', the fountain where visitors cleanse their hands and mouth and the ''shamusho'' ({{lang|ja|社務所}}), the office that supervises the shrine.&lt;ref name="HoS"/&gt; Shrines can be very large, as for example [[Ise Shrine]], or as small as a beehive, as in the case of the ''[[hokora]]'', small shrines frequently found on road sides.

Before the forced separation of Shinto and Buddhism (''[[Shinbutsu bunri]]''), it was not uncommon for a Buddhist temple to be built inside or next to a shrine or to the contrary for a shrine to include Buddhist subtemples ([[Shinbutsu shūgō]]). If a shrine was also a Buddhist temple, it was called a ''[[jingu-ji]]''. At the same time, temples in the entire country adopted tutelary [[kami]] ({{nihongo|chinju|鎮守/鎮主}} and built temple shrines called ''[[chinjusha]]'' to house them.&lt;ref name="BT95"&gt;Mark Teeuwen in ''Breen and Teeuwen'' (2000:95-96)&lt;/ref&gt; After the forcible separation of Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines (''[[shinbutsu bunri]]'') ordered by the new government in the [[Meiji period]], the connection between the two religions was officially severed, but continued nonetheless in practice.

==The origin of shrines==
{{main|Shinto_shrine#Birth_and_evolution_of_Shinto_shrines|l1=Birth and evolution of shrines}}
The practice of marking sacred areas began in Japan as early as the [[Yayoi period]] (from about 500 BC to 300 AD) originating from primal [[Shinto]] tenets. Features in the landscape such as rocks, waterfalls, islands, and especially mountains, were places believed to be capable of attracting ''[[kami]]'', and subsequently were worshiped as ''[[yorishiro]]''.&lt;ref name="young-p50"/&gt; Originally, sacred places may have been simply marked with a surrounding fence and an entrance gate or ''[[torii]]''.&lt;ref name="fletcher-p724"/&gt; Later, temporary buildings similar to present day [[mikoshi|portable shrines]]&lt;ref name="nishi-p40"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nishi|Hozumi|1996|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; were constructed to welcome the gods to the sacred place. Over time the temporary structures evolved into permanent structures that were dedicated to the gods. Ancient [[Shinto shrine|shrines]] were constructed according to the style of dwellings ([[Izumo Taisha]])&lt;ref name="young-p50"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|Young|2007|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kishida-p33"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kishida|2008|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; or storehouses ([[Ise Grand Shrine]]).&lt;ref name="young-p50"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fletcher-p724"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fletcher|Cruickshank|1996|p=724}}&lt;/ref&gt; The buildings had [[gabled roof]]s, raised floors, plank walls, and were [[thatching|thatched]] with reed or covered with [[Chamaecyparis obtusa|hinoki cypress]] bark.&lt;ref name="fletcher-p724"/&gt; Such early shrines did not include a space for worship.&lt;ref name="young-p50"/&gt;  Three important forms of ancient shrine architectural styles exist: ''[[taisha-zukuri]]'', ''[[shinmei-zukuri]]'' and ''[[sumiyoshi-zukuri]]''&lt;ref name="nishi-p40"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kishida-p34"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kishida|2008|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are exemplified by [[Izumo Taisha]], [[Nishina Shinmei Shrine]] and [[Sumiyoshi Taisha]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kishida|2008|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively and date to before 552.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kishida|2008|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the tradition of {{nihongo|''Shikinen sengū-sai|式年遷宮祭}}'',  the buildings or shrines were faithfully rebuilt at regular intervals adhering to the original design. In this manner, ancient styles have been replicated through the centuries to the present day.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Presently only the [[Ise Grand Shrine]] is being rebuilt every 20 years.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kishida-p33"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nishi-p41"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nishi|Hozumi|1996|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kuroda2005"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kuroda|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common features==
[[File:Plan of Shinto Shrine.jpg|275 px|thumb|The composition of a Shinto shrine]]

The following is a diagram illustrating the most important elements of a [[Shinto shrine]].

#''[[Torii]]'' – Shinto gate
#Stone stairs
#''[[Sandō]]'' – the approach to the shrine
#[[Chōzuya|''Chōzuya'' or ''temizuya'']] – fountain to cleanse one's hands and face
#''[[Tōrō]]'' – decorative stone lanterns
#''[[Kagura]]-den'' – building dedicated to ''[[Noh]]'' or the sacred ''[[kagura]]'' dance
#''Shamusho'' – the shrine's administrative office
#[[Ema (Shintō)|''Ema'']] – wooden plaques bearing prayers or wishes
#[[Setsumatsusha|''Sessha''/''massha'']] – small auxiliary shrines
#''[[Komainu]]'' – the so-called "lion dogs", guardians of the shrine
#''[[Haiden (Shinto)|Haiden]]'' – oratory
#''[[Tamagaki]]'' – fence surrounding the ''honden''
#''[[Honden]]'' – main hall, enshrining the ''[[kami]]''. On the roof of the ''haiden'' and ''honden'' are visible ''[[Chigi (architecture)|chigi]]'' (forked roof [[finials]]) and ''[[katsuogi]]'' (short horizontal logs), both common shrine ornamentations.

===Gate (''torii'')===

{{main|torii}}
The ''torii'' (see gallery below) is a gate which marks the entrance to a sacred area, usually but not necessarily a shrine.&lt;ref name="torii"&gt;Encyclopedia of Shinto [http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=280 Torii], accessed on December 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; A shrine may have any number of ''torii'' ([[Fushimi Inari-taisha|Fushimi Inari Taisha]] has thousands) made of wood, stone, metal, concrete or any other material. They can be found in different places within a shrine's precincts to signify an increased level of holiness.&lt;ref name="torii"/&gt;

''Torii'' can often be found also at [[Buddhist temples in Japan|Buddhist temples]], however they are an accepted symbol of Shinto, and as such are used to mark shrines on maps.

The origin of the ''torii'' is unclear, and no existing theory has been accepted as valid.&lt;ref name="torii"/&gt; They may for example have originated in India as a derivative of the [[torana]] gates in the monastery of Sanchi, which is located in central India.&lt;ref name=jaanus&gt;JAANUS, [http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/t/torii.htm Torii] accessed on December 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pathway (''sandō'')===

{{main|sandō}}
The ''sandō'' (see gallery) is the road approaching either a [[Shinto shrine]] or a [[Buddhist temples in Japan|Buddhist temple]].&lt;ref name="IK"&gt;Iwanami {{nihongo|[[Kōjien]]|広辞苑}} Japanese dictionary, 6th Edition (2008), DVD version.&lt;/ref&gt; Its point of origin is usually straddled in the first case by a Shinto ''torii'', in the second by a Buddhist ''[[sanmon]]'', gates which mark the beginning of the shrine's or temple territory. There can also be [[Traditional lighting equipment of Japan#Tōrō|stone lanterns]] and other decorations at any point along its course. There can be more than one ''sandō'', in which case the main one is called ''omote-sandō'', or front ''sandō'', ''ura-sandō'', or rear ''sandō'', etc.

===Fountain (''temizuya'')===

{{main|Temizuya}}
Before entering the shrine, visitors are supposed to wash their hands and mouths at a fountain built to the purpose called ''temizuya'' or ''chōzuya'' (see gallery).

===Guardian lion-dogs (''komainu'')===

{{main|Komainu}}
The two "lions" in front of a shrine (see gallery) are in effect warden dogs called {{nihongo|''[[komainu]]''|狛犬}}. They were so called because they were thought to have been brought to Japan from China via Korea, and their name derives from {{nihongo|"Koma"|高麗}}, the Japanese term for the Korean kingdom of [[Koguryo]].&lt;ref name="jaa"&gt;JAANUS, [http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/k/komainu.htm Komainu], accessed on November 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; They are almost identical, but one has the mouth open, the other closed. This is a very common pattern in statue pairs at both temples and shrines, and has an important symbolic meaning. The open mouth is pronouncing the first letter of the [[sanskrit]] alphabet ("a"), the closed one the last ("um"), representing the beginning and the end of all things.&lt;ref&gt;JAANUS, [http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/a/aun.htm A un], accessed on November 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The one with the open mouth is called {{nihongo|''shishi''|獅子}}, the other ''komainu'', a name that in time came to be used for both animals.&lt;ref name="jaa"/&gt;

===Sanctuary (''honden'')===

{{main|Honden}}
The ''honden'', also called {{nihongo|''shinden''|神殿}} (see gallery) is the most sacred building of shrine, intended purely for the use of the  enshrined ''kami''. The ''kami'', in itself incorporeal, is usually represented physically by a mirror or sometimes by a statue.&lt;ref&gt;''Shinden'', [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/540747/shinden Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; The building is normally in the rear of the shrine and closed to the general public. The sections
[[Shinto architecture#Most common shrine styles|Most common shrine styles]] and [[Shinto architecture#Other styles|Other styles]] below are dedicates specifically to ''honden'' and their characteristics.

===Worship hall (''haiden'')===

{{main|Haiden (Shinto)}}
The ''haiden'' (see gallery below) is the hall of worship or [[Oratory (worship)|oratory]] of the shrine. It is generally placed in front of the shrine's main sanctuary (''[[honden]]'') and often built on a larger scale than the latter. The ''haiden'' is often connected to the ''honden'' by a ''[[Heiden (Shinto)|heiden]]'', or hall of offerings. While the ''honden'' is the place for the enshrined ''[[kami]]'' and off-limits to the general public, the ''haiden'' provides a space for ceremonies and for worshiping the ''kami''.&lt;ref name="haiden-encycl"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Offertory hall (''heiden'')===

{{main|Heiden (Shinto)}}
The ''heiden'' (see gallery below) is the part of a shrine used to house offerings, and normally consists of a section linking the ''honden'' and the ''haiden'' .&lt;ref name="jahe"&gt;[http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/h/heiden.htm Heiden], [[JAANUS]], accessed on November 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be called {{nihongo|''chūden''|中殿}} or in other ways, and its position can sometimes vary. In spite of its name, nowadays it is used mostly for rituals.

===Other elements===

====Hokora====
{{main|Hokora}}
A ''hokora'' or ''hokura'' is a very small [[Shinto shrine]] either found on the precincts of a larger shrine and dedicated to folk ''kami'', or on a street side, enshrining ''kami'' not under the jurisdiction of any large shrine.&lt;ref name="eoshokora"&gt;Encyclopedia of Shinto, [http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=249 Hokora]. Accessed on December 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Dōsojin]]'', minor ''[[kami]]'' protecting travelers from evil spirits, may for example be enshrined in a ''hokora''.&lt;ref name="eoshokora"/&gt;

====''Sessha, massha''====
{{main|Setsumatsusha}}
{{nihongo|'''Sessha'''|摂社|auxiliary shrine}} and {{nihongo|'''massha'''|末社|branch shrine}}, also called {{nihongo|''eda-miya''|枝宮|branch shrines}}&lt;ref name="IK"/&gt; are small or miniature shrines (see gallery) having a deep historical relationship with a more important shrine or with the ''[[kami]]'' it enshrines, and fall under that shrine's jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="yahoo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://100.yahoo.co.jp/detail/%E6%91%82%E7%A4%BE%E3%83%BB%E6%9C%AB%E7%A4%BE/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121219003453/http://100.yahoo.co.jp/detail/%E6%91%82%E7%A4%BE%E3%83%BB%E6%9C%AB%E7%A4%BE/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 December 2012|title=Sessha - Massha|publisher=Yahoo! Japan|language=Japanese|accessdate=5 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two terms used to have different meanings, but must be today considered synonyms. For this reason, this kind of shrine is now sometimes called {{nihongo|''setsumatsusha''|摂末社}}.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The term ''setsumatsusha'' is the combination of the two terms ''sessha'' and ''massha''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Most common shrine styles==

Shrine buildings can have many different basic layouts, usually named either after a famous shrine's ''honden'' (e.g. ''hiyoshi-zukuri'', named after [[Hiyoshi Taisha]]), or a structural characteristic (e.g. ''irimoya-zukuri'', after the [[hip roof|hip]]-and [[gable]] roof it adopts. The suffix ''-zukuri'' in this case means "structure".)

The ''honden's'' roof is always gabled, and some styles also have a veranda-like aisle called ''[[hisashi (architecture)|hisashi]]'' (a 1-''[[ken (architecture)|ken]]'' wide corridor surrounding one or more sides of the core of a shrine or temple).
Among the factors involved in the classification, important are the presence or absence of:

*{{nihongo|''[[hirairi]]'' or ''hirairi-zukuri''|平入・平入造}} - a style of construction in which the building has its main entrance on the side which runs parallel to the roof's ridge (non gabled-side). The ''shinmei-zukuri'', ''nagare-zukuri'', ''hachiman-zukuri'', and ''hie-zukuri'' belong to this type.&lt;ref name="yahoo"/&gt;
*{{nihongo|''[[tsumairi]]'' or ''tsumairi-zukuri''|妻入・妻入造}} - a style of construction in which the building has its main entrance on the side which runs perpendicular to the roof's ridge (gabled side). The ''taisha-zukuri'', ''sumiyoshi-zukuri'', ''ōtori-zukuri'' and ''kasuga-zukuri'' belong to this type.&lt;ref name="yahoo"/&gt;

Proportions are also important. A building of a given style often  must have certain proportions measured in ''[[ken (architecture)|ken]]'' (the distance between pillars, a quantity variable from one shrine to another or even within the same shrine).

The oldest styles are the  ''tsumairi'' ''shinmei-zukuri'', ''taisha-zukuri'', and ''sumiyoshi-zukuri'', believed to predate the arrival of [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="yahoo"/&gt;

The two most common are the  ''hirairi'' ''nagare-zukuri'' and the ''tsumairi'' ''kasuga-zukuri''.&lt;ref name="ko"&gt;Encyclopedia of Shinto,[http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=248 History and Typology of Shrine Architecture], accessed on November 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Larger, more important shrines tend to have unique styles.

===''Nagare-zukuri''===

The {{nihongo|''nagare-zukuri''|流造|flowing style}} or {{nihongo|''nagare hafu-zukuri''|流破風造|flowing gabled style}} is a style characterized by a very asymmetrical [[gable]]d roof ({{nihongo|''kirizuma-yane''|切妻屋根}} in Japanese) projecting outwards on the non-gabled side, above the main entrance, to form a portico (see photo).&lt;ref name="ko"/&gt;  This is the feature which gives the style its name, the most common among shrines all over the country. Sometimes the basic layout consisting of an elevated {{nihongo|core|母屋|[[Moya (architecture)|moya]]}} partially surrounded by a veranda called ''hisashi'' (all under the same roof) is modified by the addition of a room in front of the entrance.&lt;ref name="ko"/&gt; The ''honden'' varies in roof ridge length from 1 to 11 ''ken'', but is never 6 or 8 ''ken''.&lt;ref name="jana"&gt;JAANUS, [http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/n/nagarezukuri.htm Nagare-zukuri], accessed on December 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The most common sizes are 1 and 3 ''ken''. The oldest shrine in Japan, [[Uji, Kyoto|Uji]]'s [[Ujigami Shrine]], has a ''honden'' of this type. Its external dimensions are 5x3 ''ken'', but internally it is composed of three {{nihongo|sanctuaries|内殿|naiden}} measuring 1 ''ken'' each.&lt;ref name="jana"/&gt;

===''Kasuga-zukuri''===
{{main|Kasuga-zukuri}}
[[File:Udamikumari Shr Kami detail.jpg|thumb|The ''honden'' at [[Uda Mikumari Shrine]] Kami-gū is made of 3 joined ''Kasuga-zukuri'' buildings]]{{nihongo|''[[Kasuga-zukuri]]''|春日造}} as a style takes its name from [[Kasuga Taisha]]'s ''honden''. It is characterized by the extreme smallness of the building, just 1x1 ''ken'' in size. In Kasuga Taisha's case, this translates in 1.9 m x 2.6 m.&lt;ref name="jaka"&gt;JAANUS, [http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/k/kasugazukuri.htm Kasuga-zukuri], accessed on December 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The roof is gabled with a single entrance at the gabled end, decorated with ''[[Chigi (architecture)|chigi]]'' and ''[[katsuogi]]'', covered with cypress bark and curved upwards at the eaves. Supporting structures are painted vermillion, while the plank walls are white.&lt;ref name="jaka"/&gt;

After the ''Nagare-zukuri'' (see below), this is the most common style, with most instances in the [[Kansai region]] around Nara.&lt;ref name="ko"/&gt;

==Other styles==
Follows a list of other styles (in alphabetical order). Many are rare, some unique. Most deal with the structure of a single building but others, for example the ''ishi-no-ma-zukuri'' style, define instead the relationship between member structures. In that case, the same building can fall under two separate classifications. For example, the ''honden'' and ''haiden'' at {{nihongo|Ōsaki Hachiman Shrine|大崎八幡宮|Ōsaki Hachiman-gū}} are single-storied, ''irimoya-zukuri'' edifices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because they are connected by a passage called ''ishi-no-ma'' and are covered by a single roof, however, the complex is classified as belonging to the ''ishi-no-ma-zukuri'' style (also called ''gongen-zukuri'').

===''Gongen-zukuri''===
The name comes from [[Nikkō Tōshō-gū]] in [[Nikkō]] because it enshrines the Tōshō Daigongen (''Tokugawa Ieyasu''). For further details, see {{nihongo|''ishinoma-zukuri''|石の間造}}.

===''Hachiman-zukuri''===
{{main|Hachiman-zukuri}}
[[File:Isaniwa Jinja Matsuyama Honden Hachiman-zukuri.jpg|thumb|left|The ''honden'' at {{nihongo|Isaniwa Shrine|伊佐爾波神社}} in [[Matsuyama, Ehime]], is a rare example of the ''hachiman-zukuri'' style. The ''honden'' (left) is surrounded by a cloister-like corridor called ''[[kairō]]'' (right).]]{{nihongo|''[[Hachiman-zukuri]]''|八幡造}} is a style used at [[Hachiman]] shrines in which two parallel structures with gabled roofs are interconnected on the non-gabled side, forming one building which, when seen from the side, gives the impression of two.&lt;ref name="jaha"&gt;JAANUS, [http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/h/hachimanzukuri.htm Hachiman-zukuri] accessed on December 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The front structure is called {{nihongo|''gaiden''|外殿|outer sanctuary}}, the rear one {{nihongo|''naiden''|内殿|inner sanctuary}}, and together they form the ''honden''.&lt;ref name="IK"/&gt; There are entrances at the center of the non-gabled side. In general, the rear structure is 3x2 ''ken'', while the front one is 3x1.

The space between the two structures is one ''[[ken (architecture)|ken]]'' wide and forms a room called {{nihongo|''ai-no-ma''|相の間}}.&lt;ref name="jaha"/&gt;  The actual width and height of this room vary with the shrine.

Extant examples are [[Usa Shrine]] and [[Iwashimizu Hachiman-gū]]. This style, of which only five [[Edo period]] examples survive, may be of Buddhist origin, since some Buddhist buildings show the same division. For example, [[Tōdai-ji]]'s ''hokke-dō''&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Literally "[[Lotus Sūtra]] Hall. A hall whose layout allows walking around a statue for meditation&lt;/ref&gt; is divided in two sections laid out front and back. Structural details also show a strong relationship with the [[Heian period]] style called ''[[shinden-zukuri]]'' used in aristocratic residences.&lt;ref name="jaha"/&gt; Another possible origin of this style may have been early palaces, known to have had parallel ridges on the roof.&lt;ref name="jaha"/&gt;

===''Hiyoshi-zukuri''===
{{main|Hiyoshi-zukuri}}
[[File:Hiyoshi-taisha nishihongu-honden.jpg|thumb|Hiyoshi Taisha's Nishi Hon-gū]]{{nihongo|''[[Hiyoshi-zukuri]]'' / ''hie-zukuri''|日吉造}}, also called {{nihongo|''shōtei-zukuri'' / ''shōtai-zukuri''|聖帝造}} or {{nihongo|''sannō-zukuri''|山王造}} is a rare style presently found in only three instances, all at [[Hiyoshi Taisha]] in [[Ōtsu, Shiga]].&lt;ref name="ko"/&gt; They are the East and West {{nihongo|Honden Hon-gū|本殿本宮}} and the {{nihongo|Sessha Usa Jingū Honden|摂社宇佐神宮本殿}}.

The building is composed of a 3x2 ''[[ken (architecture)|ken]]'' core called ''moya'' surrounded on three sides by a 1-''ken'' wide ''hisashi'', totaling 5x3 ''ken'' (see photo).&lt;ref name="jahi"&gt;JAANUS, [http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/h/hiezukuri.htm Hie-zukuri], accessed on December 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The three-sided ''hisashi'' is  unique and typical of this style. The gabled roof extends in small [[portico]]s on the front and the two gabled sides.&lt;ref name="ko"/&gt; The roof on the back has a peculiar and characteristic shape (see photo in the gallery).

===''Irimoya-zukuri''===
{{main|Irimoya-zukuri}}
[[File:Kamomioya-jinja hashidono.jpg|left|thumb|A hip-and-gable roof at [[Shimogamo Shrine]]]]{{nihongo|''[[Irimoya-zukuri]]''|入母屋造|lit. hip and gable roof style}} is a ''honden'' style having a [[hip roof|hip]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A hip roof, or hipped roof, is a type of roof where all sides slope downwards to the walls, usually with a fairly gentle slope.&lt;/ref&gt;-and-[[gable]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A gable is the generally triangular portion of a wall enclosed between the edges of a sloping roof.&lt;/ref&gt; structure, that is, a gabled roof with one or two hips, and is used for example in [[Kitano Tenman-gū]]'s ''honden''.&lt;ref name="jai"&gt;JAANUS, [http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/i/irimoyazukuri.htm Irimoya-zukuri], accessed on December 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The style is of Chinese origin and arrived in Japan together with Buddhism in the 6th century. It was originally used in the ''[[Main Hall (Japanese Buddhism)|Kon-dō]]'' and ''Kō-dō'' (lecture halls) of Buddhist temples, but started to be used also in shrines later, during the [[History of Japan#Feudal Japan (1185-1603)|Japanese Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Iwanami Nihonshi Jiten (岩波日本史辞典), CD-Rom Version. Iwanami Shoten, 1999-2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
The name derives from its {{nihongo|hip and gable roof|入母屋屋根|''irimoya yane''}}. In Japan the gable is right above the edge of the shrine's ''moya'', while the hip covers the ''hisashi''.&lt;ref name="jai"/&gt; In lay architecture it is often called just ''[[Moya (architecture)|moya]]-zukuri''. Extant examples are Mikami Shrine in [[Shiga prefecture]] and [[Yasaka Shrine]] in Kyoto.&lt;ref name="jai"/&gt;

===Ishi-no-ma-zukuri===
{{main|Ishi-no-ma-zukuri}}
[[File:Gongen Zukuri.png|right|160px|thumb|A [[gongen-zukuri]] shrine. From the top: ''honden'', ''ishi-no-ma'', ''haiden''. In yellow the ridges of the various roofs]]
{{nihongo|''[[Ishi-no-ma-zukuri]]''|石の間造}}, also called {{nihongo||権現造|[[gongen]]-zukuri}}, {{nihongo|''yatsumune-zukuri''|八棟造}} and {{nihongo|''miyadera-zukuri''|宮寺造}} is the name of a complex shrine structure in which the ''[[haiden (Shinto)|haiden]]'', or worship hall, and the [[honden]], or main sanctuary, are interconnected under the same roof in the shape of an H.&lt;ref name="sos2"&gt;Encyclopedia of Shinto, [http://www2.kokugakuin.ac.jp/ijcc/wp/bts/bts_g.html#gongen-zukuri ''Gongen-zukuri''] accessed on December 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The connecting passage can be called {{nihongo|ai-no-ma|相の間|}}, {{nihongo|ishi-no-ma|石の間}}, or {{nihongo|chūden|中殿|intermediate hall}}.&lt;ref name="sos2"/&gt; The floor of each of the three halls can be at a different level. If the ''ai-no-ma'' is paved with stones it is called ''ishi-no-ma'', whence the name of the style. It can however be paved with planks or ''[[tatami]]''. Its width is often the same as the ''honden's'', with the ''haiden'' from one to three ''ken'' wider.&lt;ref name="sos2"/&gt;

One of the oldest examples is [[Kitano Tenman-gū]] in [[Kyoto]].&lt;ref name="sos2"/&gt; The ''gongen-zukuri'' name comes from [[Nikkō Tōshō-gū]] in [[Nikkō]], which enshrines the Tōshō Daigongen ([[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]) and adopts this structure.&lt;ref name="Jaa"&gt;Jaanus, [http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/g/gongenzukuri.htm Gongen-zukuri], accessed on December 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kibitsu-zukuri===
{{main|Kibitsu-zukuri}}
[[File:Kibitsu Jinja 10 cropped.jpg|275px|thumb|Kibitsu Shrine's ''honden''-''haiden'' complex. The main entrance (hidden) is on the right.]]
{{nihongo|'''Kibitsu-zukuri'''|吉備津造}}, {{nihongo|''kibi-zukuri''|吉備造}} or {{nihongo|''hiyoku irimoya-zukuri''||入母屋造}} is a style characterized by four [[dormer]] [[gable]]s, two per lateral side, on the roof of a very large ''[[honden]]'' (sanctuary).&lt;ref name="jaanus"/&gt; The gables are set at a right angle to the main roof ridge, and the ''honden'' is part of a single complex also including a ''[[haiden (Shinto)|haiden]]'' (worship hall). [[Kibitsu Jinja|Kibitsu Shrine]] in [[Okayama, Okayama|Okayama]], [[Okayama Prefecture]], [[Japan]] is the sole example of this style.

===Primitive shrine layout without ''honden''===
This style is rare, but historically important. It is also unique in that the ''honden'', normally the very center of a shrine, is missing. It is believed shrines of this type are reminiscent of what shrines were like in prehistorical times. The first shrines had no ''[[honden]]'' because the ''[[shintai]]'', or object of worship, was the mountain on which they stood. An extant example is [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]'s [[Ōmiwa Shrine]], which still has no ''honden''.&lt;ref name="ko"/&gt; An area near the ''[[Haiden (Shinto)|haiden]]'' (hall of worship), sacred and [[taboo]], replaces it for worship. Another prominent example of this style is [[Futarasan Shrine]] near Nikkō, whose ''shintai'' is [[Mount Nantai]]. For details, see [[Shinto shrine#Birth and evolution of Shinto shrines|Birth and evolution of Shinto shrines]] above.

===''Ryōnagare-zukuri''===
{{main|Nagare-zukuri}}
{{nihongo|''Ryōnagare-zukuri''|両流造|double flow style}} is an evolution of the ''nagare-zukuri'' in which the roof flows down to form a portico on both non-gabled sides.&lt;ref name=" ko"/&gt; Examples are the ''honden'' at [[Itsukushima Shrine]] and at Matsuo Taisha.

===''Shinmei-zukuri''===
{{main|Shinmei-zukuri}}
[[File:IseShrineBuilding.jpg|thumb|left|A shrine at Ise]]
{{nihongo|''[[Shinmei-zukuri]]''|神明造}} is an ancient style typical of, and most common at, [[Ise Grand Shrine]], the holiest of Shinto shrines.&lt;ref name=" ko"/&gt; It is most common in Mie prefecture.&lt;ref name="jashi"&gt;JAANUS, [http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/s/shinmeizukuri.htm Shinmei-zukuri] accessed on December 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Characterized by an extreme simplicity, its basic features can be seen in Japanese architecture from the [[Kofun period]] (250–538 C.E.) onwards and it is considered the pinnacle of Japanese traditional architecture. Built in planed, unfinished wood, the ''honden'' is either 3x2 ''ken'' or 1x1''ken'' in size, has a raised floor, a gabled roof with an entry on one the non-gabled sides, no upward curve at the eaves, and decorative logs called ''[[chigi (architecture)|chigi]]'' and ''[[katsuogi]]'' protruding from the roof's ridge.&lt;ref name="jashi"/&gt; The oldest extant example is [[Nishina Shinmei Shrine]], the shrine which gives the style its name.&lt;ref name="yahoo"/&gt;

===''Sumiyoshi-zukuri''===
{{main|Sumiyoshi-zukuri}}
[[File:Sumiyoshi Taisha Hunatama Jinja1.jpg|thumb|Sumiyoshi Taisha's Funatama Jinja]]{{nihongo|''[[Sumiyoshi-zukuri]]''|住吉造}} takes its name from [[Sumiyoshi Taisha]]'s ''honden'' in [[Ōsaka]]. The building is 4 ''ken'' wide and 2 ''ken'' deep, and has an entrance under the gable.&lt;ref name="yahoo2"&gt;[https://archive.is/20121209043808/http://100.yahoo.co.jp/detail/%E7%A5%9E%E7%A4%BE%E5%BB%BA%E7%AF%89/ Jinja Kenchiku], [[Shogakukan]] Nihon Daihyakka Zensho, accessed on November 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Its interior is divided in two sections, one at the front ({{nihongo|''gejin''|外陣}}) and one at the back ({{nihongo|''naijin''|内陣}}) with a single entrance at the front.&lt;ref name="jasu"&gt;JAANUS, [http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/s/sumiyoshizukuri.htm Sumiyoshi-zukuri], accessed on December 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Construction is simple, but the pillars are painted in vermilion and the walls in white.

The style is supposed to have its origin in old palace architecture&lt;ref name="jasu"/&gt; Another example of this style is Sumiyoshi Jinja, part of the [[Sumiyoshi Sanjin]] complex in [[Fukuoka Prefecture]].&lt;ref name="jasu"/&gt; In both cases, as in many others, there is no veranda.

===''Taisha-zukuri''===
{{main|Taisha-zukuri}}
[[File:Kamosu jinja.jpg|thumb|left|Kamosu Jinja's ''honden'']]{{nihongo|''[[Taisha-zukuri]]'' or ''Ōyashiro-zukuri''|大社造|}} is the oldest shrine style, takes its name from [[Izumo Taisha]] and, like Ise Grand Shrine's, has ''chigi'' and ''katsuogi'', plus archaic features like gable-end pillars and a single central pillar (''shin no mihashira'').&lt;ref name="ko"/&gt; Because its floor is raised on stilts, it is believed to have its origin in raised-floor granaries similar to those found in [[Toro (archaeological site)|Toro]], Shizuoka prefecture.&lt;ref name="jata"&gt;JAANUS, [http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/t/taishazukuri.htm Taisha-zukuri], accessed on December 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''honden'' normally has a 2x2 ''ken'' footprint (12.46x12.46 m in Izumo Taisha's case), with an entrance on the gabled end. The stairs to the honden are covered by a cypress bark roof. The oldest extant example of the style is Kamosu Jinja's ''honden'' in [[Shimane prefecture]], built in the 16th century.

===''Owari-zukuri''===
{{nihongo|''Owari-zukuri''|尾張造}} is a complex style found in large shrines of what used to be called [[Owari province]], near [[Nagoya]].&lt;ref name="ko"/&gt; It features many structures within the same compound, among them a ''honden'', a ''haiden'', a ''tsuriwata-rō'' (a suspended passageway), a ''[[Mon (architecture)|yotsuashimon]]'' (a gate built with four pillars), and other buildings. Extant examples of this style include Owari Ōkunitama Shrine and [[Tsushima Shrine]].&lt;ref name="ko"/&gt;

===''Misedana-zukuri''===
[[File:Sanko-jinja massha.jpeg|thumb|A massha at [[Sankō Shrine]] in Ōsaka]]{{nihongo|''Misedana-zukuri''|見世棚造 or 店棚造|showcase style}} owes its name to the fact that, unlike the other shrine styles, it doesn't feature a stairway at the entrance, and the veranda is completely flat.&lt;ref name="ko"/&gt;  It is normally used only in [[Setsumatsusha|''sessha'' and ''massha'']], tiny, 1 ''ken'' shrines sometimes found on the premises of larger ones. They can however be as small as [[beehives]] or relatively large and have 1x2, 1x3 or even, in one case, 1x7 bays.&lt;ref name="jami"&gt;JAANUS, [http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/m/misedanazukuri.htm Misedana-zukuri], accessed on December 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the lack of a staircase, such shrines belong to the ''nagare-zukuri'' or ''kasuga-zukuri'' styles and have their entrance on the non-gabled (''hirairi'') or gabled side (''tsumairi'').

===''Ōtori-zukuri''===
The {{nihongo|''Ōtori-zukuri''|大鳥造}} is a ''tsumairi'' style named after [[Ōtori taisha]] in [[Ōsaka]]. Its floor is elevated and 2x2 ''ken'' in size, without a veranda or railings. This style seems to have the same origins as the ancient ''sumiyoshi-'' and ''taisha-zukuri'' styles, which it resembles, and the absence of a veranda may be due to the use in origin of an earthen floor, still in use in some shrines.&lt;ref name="jaoo"&gt;JAANUS, [http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/o/ootorizukuri.htm Ootori-zukuri], accessed on December 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The interior is divided in two, ''naijin'' (inner chamber) and ''gejin'' (outer chamber).&lt;ref name="jaoo"/&gt; The roof is covered with layers of cypress bark shingles and has a high ridge with an ornamental rather than functional role. It does not curve upwards at the eaves and the [[bargeboard]]s are simple and straight.&lt;ref name="jaoo"/&gt;  ''Chigi'' and three ''katsuogi'' are present.

The basis of Sikhism lies in the teachings of [[Guru Nanak]] and his successors.

In Sikhism, the concept of "God" is ''[[Waheguru]]'' considered [[Nirankar]] (shapeless), [[akal]] (timeless), and [[Alakh Niranjan]] (invisible). The Sikh scripture begins with ''[[Ik Onkar]]'' (ੴ), which refers to the "formless one",&lt;ref name=singhaikonkar&gt;{{cite book|author=H. S. Singha|title=The Encyclopedia of Sikhism (over 1000 Entries)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gqIbJz7vMn0C |year=2000|publisher=Hemkunt|isbn=978-81-7010-301-1|pages=20–21, 103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pashaura Singh (2014), in The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies (Editors: Pashaura Singh, Louis E.

Reichberg and Henrik Syse|title=Religion, War, and Ethics: A Sourcebook of Textual Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t3CFAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA672|year=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-95204-0|page=672}}; Quote: "As an Indian religion, Sikhism affirms transmigration, the continued rebirth after death..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sikhism Sikhism], Encylopaedia Britannica; Quote: "Sikhism, Indian religion founded in the Punjab in the late 15th century."; See also [https://www.britannica.com/topic/classification-of-religions Classification of Religions], Encyclopaedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;

Sikh ethics emphasize the congruence between spiritual development and everyday moral conduct. Its founder Guru Nanak summarized this perspective with "Truth is the highest virtue, but higher still is truthful living".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh|author2=Louis E. Fenech|title=The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8I0NAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA234|year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-969930-8|page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concept of life===
{{Main article|Ik Onkar}}
God in Sikhism is known as Ik Onkar, the One Supreme Reality or the all-pervading [[Para Brahman|spirit]] (which is taken to mean God).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Mayled| first = John| title = Sikhism| publisher = Heinemann| year = 2002| isbn = 0-435-33627-4| page = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This spirit has no gender in Sikhism, though translations may present it as masculine. It is also ''Akaal Purkh'' (beyond time and space) and ''Nirankar'' (without form). In addition, Nanak wrote that there are many worlds on which it has created life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dev|first=Nanak |authorlink=Guru Nanak|title=Gurū Granth Sāhib |url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&amp;Param=15&amp;punjabi=t&amp;id=632#l632 |accessdate=15 June 2006 |page=15 |quote=You are the One True Lord and Master of all the other beings, of so many worlds.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional [[Mul Mantar]] goes from Ik Oankar until Nanak Hosee Bhee Sach. The opening line of the Guru Granth Sahib and each subsequent [[raga]], mentions Ik Oankar (translated by Pashaura Singh):
{{quote|ੴ ਸਤਿ ਨਾਮੁ ਕਰਤਾ ਪੁਰਖੁ ਨਿਰਭਉ ਨਿਰਵੈਰੁ ਅਕਾਲ ਮੂਰਤਿ ਅਜੂਨੀ ਸੈਭੰ ਗੁਰ ਪ੍ਰਸਾਦਿ॥&lt;br/&gt;

"There is one supreme being, the eternal reality, the creator, without fear and devoid of enmity, immortal, never incarnated, self-existent, known by grace through the true Guru."&lt;ref name=pashauramulmantar&gt;{{cite book|author=Pashaura Singh|title=The Guru Granth Sahib: Canon, Meaning and Authority|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aiwpDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT101|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-908773-0|pages=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Worldly illusion===
''[[Maya (illusion)|Māyā]]'', defined as a temporary illusion or "unreality", is one of the core deviations from the pursuit of God and salvation: where worldly attractions which give only illusory temporary satisfaction and pain which distract the process of the devotion of God. However, Nanak emphasised māyā as not a reference to the unreality of the world, but of its values. In Sikhism, the influences of [[ahankar|ego]], [[krodh|anger]], [[lobh|greed]], [[moh|attachment]], and [[kam|lust]], known as the ''[[Five Thieves]]'', are believed to be particularly distracting and hurtful. Sikhs believe the world is currently in a state of ''[[Kali Yuga]]'' (Age of Darkness) because the world is led astray by the love of and attachment to Maya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Nirmal|title=Searches In Sikhism|year=2008|publisher=Hemkunt Press|isbn=978-8170103677|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fate of people vulnerable to the Five Thieves ('Pānj Chor'), is separation from God, and the situation may be remedied only after intensive and relentless devotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Parrinder |first=Geoffrey |authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder |year=1971 |title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present |publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited |location=United States |isbn=978-0-87196-129-7|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timeless truth===
[[File:Sikh.man.at.the.Golden.Temple.jpg|thumb|An [[Nihang singh|Akali-Nihung Sikh Warrior]] at [[Harmandir Sahib]], also called the Golden Temple]]
According to Guru Nanak the supreme purpose of human life is to reconnect with [[Akal]] (The Timeless One), however, egotism is the biggest barrier in doing this. Using the Guru's teaching remembrance of ''[[Nām Japō|nām]]'' (the divine Word or the Name of the Lord)&lt;ref name="Pruthi 2004 204"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pruthi|first=Raj|title=Sikhism and Indian Civilization|year=2004|publisher=Discovery Publishing House|isbn=978-8171418794|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NaamSimran"/&gt; leads to the end of egotism. Guru Nanak designated the word 'guru' (meaning ''teacher'')&lt;ref&gt;Note: some disagree with this viewpoint, and state that guru in Sikhism is "not a teacher or a guide", but "God's own manifestation"; see: Bhagat Singh &amp; G.P. Singh, Japji, 2002, Hemkunt Press, p. 9; Quote: "(...) In Sikh religion the word 'Guru' does not denote a teacher, or an expert or a guide in human body. When God manifested his attributes in person, that person was called 'Guru Nanak'"&lt;/ref&gt; to mean the voice of "the spirit": the source of knowledge and the guide to salvation.&lt;ref name="p254"&gt;{{cite book|last=Parrinder|first=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder|year=1971|title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present|publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited|location=United States|isbn=978-0-87196-129-7|pages=254–256}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Ik Onkar is [[Panentheism|universally immanent]], ''guru'' is indistinguishable from "Akal" and are one and the same.&lt;ref name=singh2013 /&gt; One connects with ''guru'' only with accumulation of selfless search of truth.&lt;ref name=dhillon1999&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dhillon|first=Bikram Singh|title=Who is a Sikh?

===Liberation===
Guru Nanak's teachings are founded not on a final destination of heaven or hell but on a spiritual union with the [[Akal]] which results in [[salvation]] or ''[[Jivanmukta|Jivanmukti]]'' (liberation whilst alive),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Takhar|first=Opinderjit|title=Sikh Identity: An Exploration Of Groups Among Sikhs|year=2005|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0754652021|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; a concept also found in Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Grewal"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/history/south-asian-history/sikhs-punjab?format=PB&amp;isbn=9780521637640 | title=The Sikhs of the Punjab | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Grewal, J.S. | year=1998 | location=United Kingdom | pages=25–36 | isbn=0521637643}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guru Gobind Singh]] makes it clear that human birth is obtained with great fortune, therefore one needs to be able to make the most of this life.&lt;ref name=chahal2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chahal|first=Amarjit Singh|title=Concept of Reincarnation in Guru Nanak's Philosophy|journal=Understanding Sikhism – The Research Journal|date=December 2011|volume=13|issue=1–2|pages=52–59|url=http://www.iuscanada.com/journal/archives/2011/j1312p52.pdf|accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 6th Sikh Guru, [[Guru Hargobind]], after [[Guru Arjan]] martyrdom and faced with oppression by the Islamic [[Mughal Empire]], affirmed the philosophy that the political/temporal (Miri) and spiritual (Piri) realms are mutually coexistent.&lt;ref name="Marty1"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=doCmVaOnh_wC | title=Fundamentalisms and the State: Remaking Polities, Economies, and Militance | publisher=University of Chicago Press |author1=E.

The concept of man as elaborated by [[Guru Nanak]], states Arvind-pal Singh Mandair, refines and negates the "monotheistic concept of self/God", and "monotheism becomes almost redundant in the movement and crossings of love".&lt;ref name="Mandair1"/&gt; The goal of man, taught the Sikh Gurus, is to end all dualities of "self and other, I and not-I", attain the "attendant balance of separation-fusion, self-other, action-inaction, attachment-detachment, in the course of daily life".&lt;ref name="Mandair1"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dzeCy_zL0Q8C | title=Religion and the Specter of the West – Sikhism, India, Postcoloniality and the Politics of Translation | publisher= Columbia University Press | author=Mandair, Arvind-Pal Singh | year= 2009 | pages=372–373 | isbn=0231147244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singing and music===
Sikhs refer to the hymns of the Gurus as [[Gurbani]] (The Guru's word). [[Shabad (hymn)|Shabad]] [[Kirtan]] is the singing of Gurbani. The entire verses of Guru Granth Sahib are written in a form of poetry and rhyme to be recited in thirty one Ragas of the Classical Indian Music as specified. However, the exponents of these are rarely to be found amongst the Sikhs who are conversant with all the Ragas in the Guru Granth Sahib. Guru Nanak started the Shabad Kirtan tradition and taught that listening to kirtan is a powerful way to achieve tranquility while meditating; Singing of the glories of the Supreme Timeless One (God) with devotion is the most effective way to come in communion with the Supreme Timeless One.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Joginder|title=Celestial Gems|year=2004|publisher=Hemkunt Press|isbn=978-8170103455|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three morning prayers for Sikhs consist of [[Japji Sahib]], [[Jaap Sahib]] and [[Tav-Prasad Savaiye]].&lt;ref name="diaspora"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sikhs-Diaspora-Modern-Guide-Practice/dp/0956072801/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1385130558&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=0956072801 | title=Sikhs in the Diaspora: A Modern Guide to the Practice of Sikh Faith | publisher=Sikh Publishing House; First edition | author=Singh Bakhshi, Surinder | chapter=Chapter 22 – Nitnem | year= 2008 |page=133 | isbn=0956072801}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Khalsa|Baptised Sikhs]] – Amritdharis, rise early and meditate and then recite all the [[Five Banis]] of Nitnem before breakfast.

===Remembrance of the divine name===
A key practice by Sikhs is remembrance&lt;ref name="NaamSimran"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Paths-Divine-Ancient-Indian-12/dp/1565182480/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1385026816&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=1565182480 | title=Paths to The Divine: Ancient and Indian: 12 | publisher=Council for Research in Values &amp; | author=McLean, George | authorlink=Paths to the Divine | year=2008| location=1565182480 |page=599}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Divine Name Vaheguru (Naam – the Name of the Lord).&lt;ref name="Pruthi 2004 204"/&gt; This contemplation is done through ''[[Nām Japō|Nām Japna]]'' (repetition of the divine name) or ''[[Simran|Naam Simran]]'' (remembrance of the divine Name through recitation).&lt;ref name="NaamSimran" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doel|first=Sarah|title=Sikh Music: History, Text, and Praxis|year=2008|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0549833697|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The verbal repetition of the name of God or a sacred syllable has been an ancient established practice in religious traditions in India, however, Sikhism developed ''Naam-simran'' as an important Bhakti practice.&lt;ref name="Dhillon1988"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dalbir Singh Dhillon|title=Sikhism, Origin and Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=osnkLKPMWykC|year=1988|publisher=Atlantic Publishers|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cave|first1=David|last2=Norris|first2=Rebecca|title=Religion and the Body: Modern Science and the Construction of Religious Meaning | date=2012| publisher=Brill Academic | isbn=978-9004221116|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author1=Anna S.

Nanak described the result of the disciplined application of ''nām simraṇ'' as a "growing towards and into God" through a gradual process of five stages. The last of these is ''[[Sach Khand|sach khaṇḍ]]'' (''The Realm of Truth''){{snd}}the final union of the spirit with God.&lt;ref name="p254"/&gt;

===Service and action===
The Sikh Gurus taught that by constantly remembering the divine name (''naam simran'') and through selfless service, or ''sēvā'', the devotee overcomes egoism (''[[Haumai]]''). This, it states, is the primary root of five evil impulses and the cycle of [[Reincarnation#Sikhism|rebirth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=W.

Service in Sikhism takes three forms: "Tan" – physical service; "Man" – mental service (such as studying to help others); and "Dhan" – material service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Angela|title=Movement and Change|year=1997|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=9780174370673|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sikhism stresses ''[[kirat karō]]'': that is "honest work". Sikh teachings also stress the concept of sharing, or ''[[vaṇḍ chakkō]]'', giving to the needy for the benefit of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=W.

===Justice and equality===
Sikhism regards God as the true king, the king of all kings, the one who dispenses justice through the law of ''[[karma]]'', a retributive model and divine grace.&lt;ref name="Justice"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IntWqeMeU_oC&amp;pg=PA199 | title=The Spiritual Roots of Restorative Justice (SUNY Series in Religious Studies) | publisher=State University of New York Press | author= Pashaura Singh| editor= L.

The term for justice in the Sikh tradition is "Niau".&lt;ref name="Justice" /&gt; It is related to the term "[[dharma|dharam]]" which in Sikhism connotes 'moral order' and righteousness.&lt;ref name="Justice" /&gt; According to the Tenth Sikh Guru [[Guru Gobind Singh]], states Pashaura Singh – a professor of Sikh Studies, "one must first try all the peaceful means of negotiation in the pursuit of justice" and if these fail then it is legitimate to "draw the sword in defense of righteousness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pashaura Singh|editor=John Renard|title=Fighting Words: Religion, Violence, and the Interpretation of Sacred Texts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fCjVRqPD-HQC |year=2012|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-95408-3 |page=213 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sikhism considers "an attack on dharam is an attack on justice, on righteousness, and on the moral order generally" and the dharam "must be defended at all costs".&lt;ref name="Mcleod"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vTJhC_l1gksC | title=The Sikhs: History, Religion, and Society (ACLS Lectures on the History of Religions) | publisher=Columbia University Press; Reprint edition | author=Mcleod, W.H. | year=1991|page=56 | isbn=0231068158}}&lt;/ref&gt; The divine name is its antidote for all pain and vices. Forgiveness is taught as a virtue in Sikhism, yet it also teaches its faithful to shun those with evil intentions and to pick up the sword to fight injustice and religious persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IntWqeMeU_oC&amp;pg=PA202 | title=The Spiritual Roots of Restorative Justice (SUNY Series in Religious Studies) | publisher=State University of New York Press | author= Pashaura Singh| editor= L.

Sikhism does not differentiate religious obligations by gender. God in Sikhism has no gender, and the Sikh scripture does not discriminate against the woman, nor bar her from any roles.&lt;ref name="McLeod2009p70"/&gt; Women in Sikhism have led battles and issued [[hukamnama]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=xajcAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65|title=Historical Dictionary of Sikhism|page=65|author=Fenech, E.

The term [[guru]] comes from the [[Sanskrit]] ''gurū'', meaning teacher, guide, or mentor. The traditions and philosophy of Sikhism were established by ten gurus from 1469 to 1708.&lt;ref name="Panjab Publishers"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Darshan|title=Indian Bhakti Tradition and Sikh Gurus|date=1968|publisher=Panjab Publishers|location=Chandigarh|page=158|edition=First }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nesbitt2005_a"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eleanor Nesbitt|title=Sikhism: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ai-rpcY-rrgC&amp;pg=PT22|date=22 September 2005|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-157806-9|pages=22–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each guru added to and reinforced the message taught by the previous, resulting in the creation of the Sikh religion. Guru Nanak was the first guru and appointed a disciple as successor. [[Guru Gobind Singh]] was the final guru in human form. Before his death, Guru Gobind Singh decreed in 1708, that the Gurū Granth Sāhib would be the final and perpetual guru of the Sikhs.&lt;ref name="granthfinalguru"/&gt;

Guru Nanak stated that his Guru is God who is the same from the beginning of time to the end of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=History of Sikh Gurus Retold: 1469–1606 C.E | publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors Pvt Ltd | author=Singh Gandhi, Surjit | date=1 Feb 2008 | page=265 | isbn=9788126908578}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nanak claimed to be God's mouthpiece, God's slave and servant, but maintained that he was only a guide and teacher.&lt;ref name=ksingh116&gt;{{cite book|author=Khushwant Singh|title=Hymns of Guru Nanak|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W3jXHMDwOb4C&amp;pg=PA116|year= 1969|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn=978-81-250-1161-3|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=History of Sikh Gurus Retold: 1469–1606 C.E | publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors Pvt Ltd | author=Singh Gandhi, Surjit | year=2007 | page=265 | isbn=978-8126908592}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nanak stated that the human Guru is mortal, who is to be respected and loved but not worshipped.&lt;ref name=ksingh116/&gt; When Guru, or Satguru (The true guru) is used in ''Gurbani'' it is often referring to the highest expression of truthfulness – God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Darshan|title=Indian Bhakti Tradition and Sikh Gurus|date=1968|publisher=Panjab Publishers|location=Chandigarh|page=148|edition=First }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Guru Angad]] succeeded Guru Nanak. Later, an important phase in the development of Sikhism came with the third successor, Guru Amar Das. Guru Nanak's teachings emphasised the pursuit of salvation; Guru Amar Das began building a cohesive community of followers with initiatives such as sanctioning distinctive ceremonies for birth, marriage, and death. Amar Das also established the ''manji'' (comparable to a [[diocese]]) system of clerical supervision.&lt;ref name="p254" /&gt;

[[Guru Amar Das]]'s successor and son-in-law [[Guru Ram Das]] founded the city of [[Amritsar]], which is home of the [[Harimandir Sahib]] and regarded widely as the holiest city for all Sikhs. [[Guru Arjan]] was arrested by [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] authorities who were suspicious and hostile to the religious order he was developing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Parrinder | first=Geoffrey | authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder | year=1971 | title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present | publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited | location=United States | isbn = 978-0-87196-129-7 | page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; His persecution and death inspired his successors to promote a military and political organization of Sikh communities to defend themselves against the attacks of Mughal forces.

[[File:Interior of Akal Takht.jpg|thumb|The interior of the [[Akal Takht]]]]The Sikh gurus established a mechanism which allowed the Sikh religion to react as a community to changing circumstances. The sixth guru, [[Guru Har Gobind|Guru Hargobind]], was responsible for the creation of the concept of [[Akal Takht]] (''throne of the timeless one''), which serves as the supreme decision-making centre of Sikhism and sits opposite the [[Harmandir Sahib]]. The Akal Takht is located in the city of Amritsar. The leader is appointed by the Shiromani Gurdwara Pabandhak Committee (SPGC). The ''[[Sarbat Khalsa|Sarbat Ḵẖālsā]]'' (a representative portion of the Khalsa Panth) historically gathers at the Akal Takht on special festivals such as [[Vaisakhi]] or [[Hola Mohalla]] and when there is a need to discuss matters that affect the entire Sikh nation. A ''[[gurmata|gurmatā]]'' (literally, ''guru's intention'') is an order passed by the Sarbat Ḵẖālsā in the presence of the Gurū Granth Sāhib. A gurmatā may only be passed on a subject that affects the fundamental principles of Sikh religion; it is binding upon all Sikhs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgpc.net/sikhism/tankah.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020606154817/http://sgpc.net/sikhism/tankah.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=6 June 2002 |title=Sikh Reht Maryada&amp;nbsp;– Method of Adopting Gurmatta |accessdate=9 June 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''[[Hukamnama|hukamnāmā]]'' (literally, ''edict'' or ''royal order'') is often used interchangeably with the term gurmatā. However, a hukamnāmā formally refers to a hymn from the Gurū Granth Sāhib which is a given order to Sikhs.

The word Guru in Sikhism also refers to ''Akal Purkh'' (God), and God and Guru are often synonymous in ''[[Gurbani]]'' (Sikh writings).&lt;ref name="Panjab Publishers"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raj|first1=Selva|title=South Asian Religions: Tradition and Today|year =2013| publisher=Routledge| location=Abingdon| isbn=978-0415448512| page=232|edition=First }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scripture==
There is one primary scripture for the Sikhs: the Gurū Granth Sāhib. It is sometimes synonymously referred to as the Ādi Granth.&lt;ref name=shacklexvii/&gt; Chronologically, however, the Ādi Granth – literally, ''The First Volume'', refers to the version of the scripture created by [[Guru Arjan]] in 1604.&lt;ref&gt;William Owen Cole and Piara Singh Sambhi (1995), The Sikhs: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723134}}, pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt; The Gurū Granth Sāhib is the final expanded version of the scripture compiled by [[Guru Gobind Singh]].&lt;ref name=shacklexvii/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Owen Cole and Piara Singh Sambhi (1995), The Sikhs: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723134}}, pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt; While the Guru Granth Sahib is an unquestioned scripture in Sikhism, another important religious text, the [[Dasam Granth]], does not enjoy universal consensus, and is considered a secondary scripture by many Sikhs.&lt;ref name=shacklexvii&gt;Christopher Shackle and Arvind Mandair (2005), Teachings of the Sikh Gurus, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415266048}}, pp. xvii–xx&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adi Granth===
{{Main article|Ādi Granth}}
The Ādi Granth was compiled primarily by [[Bhai Gurdas]] under the supervision of [[Guru Arjan]] between the years 1603 and 1604.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Trumpp | first=Ernest | year=2004 | origyear=1877 | title=The Ādi Granth or the Holy Scriptures of the Sikhs | publisher=Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers | location=India | isbn = 978-8121502443 | page=xxxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is written in the [[Gurmukhi|Gurmukhī]] script, which is a descendant of the [[Laṇḍā]] script used in the Punjab at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Grierson | first=George Abraham | authorlink=George Abraham Grierson | year=1967 | origyear=1927 | title=The Linguistic Survey of India | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass | location=India | isbn = 978-8185395272 | page=624}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gurmukhi|Gurmukhī]] script was standardised by Guru Angad, the second guru of the Sikhs, for use in the Sikh scriptures and is thought to have been influenced by the [[Śāradā script|Śāradā]] and [[Devanāgarī]] scripts.

===Guru Granth Sahib===
[[File:Guru Granth Sahib.jpg|thumb|upright|Gurū Granth Sāhib – the primary scripture of Sikhism]]
{{Main article|Gurū Granth Sāhib}}

The Guru Granth Sahib is the holy scripture of the Sikhs, and regarded as the living Guru.

====Compilation====
The Guru Granth started as a volume of Guru Nanak's poetic compositions. Prior to his death, he passed on his volume to Guru Angad (Guru 1539–1551). The final version of the [[Gurū Granth Sāhib]] was compiled by [[Guru Gobind Singh]] in 1678. It consists of the original Ādi Granth with the addition of [[Guru Tegh Bahadur]]'s hymns. The predominant bulk of Guru Granth Sahib is compositions by seven Sikh Gurus – Guru Nanak, Guru Angad, Guru Amar Das, Guru Ram Das, Guru Arjan, Guru Teg Bahadur and Guru Gobind Singh. It also contains the traditions and teachings of thirteen [[Hindu]] Bhakti movement ''sants'' (saints) such as [[Ramananda]], [[Namdev]] among others, and two [[Muslim]] saints namely [[Kabir]] and the Sufi [[Sheikh Farid]].&lt;ref name=shapiro924/&gt;&lt;ref name="p254"/&gt;

The text comprises 6,000 ''[[shabhad|śabads]]'' (line compositions),&lt;ref name=shacklexvii/&gt; which are poetically rendered and set to rhythmic ancient north Indian classical music.&lt;ref name=king359&gt;Anna S. King and JL Brockington (2005), The Intimate Other: Love Divine in Indic Religions, Orient Blackswan, {{ISBN|978-8125028017}}, pp. 359–361&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of the scripture is classified into thirty one ''[[raga|rāgas]]'', with each [[Ragas in the Guru Granth Sahib|Granth rāga]] subdivided according to length and author. The hymns in the scripture are arranged primarily by the ''rāgas'' in which they are read.&lt;ref name=shacklexvii/&gt;

====Language and script====
The main language used in the scripture is known as ''[[Sant Bhasha|Sant Bhāṣā]]'', a language related to both Punjabi and [[Hindi language|Hindi]] and used extensively across medieval northern India by proponents of popular devotional religion ([[bhakti]]).&lt;ref name="parrinderp259"&gt;{{cite book|last=Parrinder|first=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder|year=1971|title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present|publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited|location=United States|isbn=978-0871961297|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text is printed in Gurumukhi script, believed to have been developed by Guru Angad,&lt;ref name=shacklexvii/&gt; but it shares the Indo-European roots found in numerous regional languages of India.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Shackle and Arvind Mandair (2005), Teachings of the Sikh Gurus, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415266048}}, pp. xxi–xxxii&lt;/ref&gt;

====Teachings====
[[File:Sikh musicians.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A group of [[Sikh music]]ians at the Golden Temple complex]]

The vision in the Guru Granth Sahib, states Torkel Brekke, is a society based on divine justice without oppression of any kind.&lt;ref name=brekke673/&gt;

The Granth begins with the ''[[Mul Mantra|Mūl Mantra]]'', an iconic verse which received Guru Nanak directly from Akal Purakh (God).
The traditional Mul Mantar goes from Ik Oankar until Nanak hosee bhee sach.

====As Guru====
The Tenth Guru, Guru Gobind Singh, named the Sikh scripture Guru Granth Sahib as his successor, terminating the line of human Gurus and making the scripture the literal embodiment of the eternal, impersonal Guru, where Gods/Gurus word serves as the spiritual guide for Sikhs.&lt;ref name="WH McLeod 2014 page 17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="William James 2011 pages 241-242"/&gt;&lt;ref name="granthfinalguru"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jane Bingham (2007), Sikhism, Atlas of World Faiths, {{ISBN|978-1599200590}}, pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; 
:[[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]: {{lang|pa|ਸੱਬ ਸਿੱਖਣ ਕੋ ਹੁਕਮ ਹੈ ਗੁਰੂ ਮਾਨਯੋ ਗ੍ਰੰਥ ।}}
:Transliteration: Sabb sikkhaṇ kō hukam hai [[Guru Maneyo Granth|gurū mānyō granth]].
:{{lang-en|All Sikhs are commanded to take the Granth as Guru}}.

The Guru Granth Sahib is installed in Sikh ''Gurdwara'' (temple); many Sikhs bow or prostrate before it on entering the temple. The Guru Granth Sahib is installed every morning and put to bed at night in many ''Gurdwaras''.&lt;ref&gt;William Owen Cole and Piara Singh Sambhi (1995), The Sikhs: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723134}}, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; The Granth is revered as eternal ''[[gurbani|gurbānī]]'' and the spiritual authority.&lt;ref&gt;Torkel Brekke (2014), ''Religion, War, and Ethics: A Sourcebook of Textual Traditions'' (Editors: Gregory M. Reichberg and Henrik Syse), Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521450386}}, p. 675&lt;/ref&gt;

The copies of the Guru Granth Sahib are not regarded as material objects, but as living subjects which are alive.&lt;ref name=Myrvold&gt;Kristina Myrvold (2016). "Making the Scripture a Person: Reinventing Death Rituals of Guru Granth Sahib in Sikhism", pp. 134-136, 142–143, 152-155; In: Kristina Myrvold (2016), ''The Death of Sacred Texts: Ritual Disposal and Renovation of Texts in World Religions'', Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; According to Myrvold, the Sikh scripture is treated with respect like a living person, in a manner similar to the Gospel in early Christian worship. Old copies of the Sikh scripture are not thrown away, rather funerary services are performed.&lt;ref name=Myrvold/&gt;

In India the Guru Granth Sahib is even officially recognised by the Supreme Court of India as a judicial person which can receive donations and own land.&lt;ref name=Myrvold/&gt; Yet, some Sikhs also warn that, without true comprehension of the text, veneration for the text can lead to [[bibliolatry]], with the concrete form of the teachings becoming the object of worship instead of the teachings themselves.&lt;ref name=Myrvold/&gt;

====Relation to Hinduism and Islam====
The Sikh scriptures use Hindu terminology, with references to the [[Vedas]], and the names of gods and goddesses in Hindu bhakti movement traditions, such as Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma, Parvati, Lakshmi, Saraswati, Rama, Krishna, but not to worship. &lt;ref name=brekke673&gt;Torkel Brekke (2014), Religion, War, and Ethics: A Sourcebook of Textual Traditions (Editors: Gregory M. Reichberg and Henrik Syse), Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521450386}}, pp. 673, 675, 672–686&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AK Sinha (2013), Glimpse of Scriptures of Religions of Indian Origin, Xlibris, {{ISBN|978-1483663081}}, pp. 204–216&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Shackle and Arvind Mandair (2005), Teachings of the Sikh Gurus, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415266048}}, pp. xxxiv–xli&lt;/ref&gt; It also refers to the spiritual concepts in Hinduism (''Ishvara, Bhagavan, Brahman'') and the concept of God in Islam (''Allah'') to assert that these are just "alternate names for the Almighty One".&lt;ref&gt;Nirbhai Singh (1990), [https://books.google.com/books?id=yIMYO-7NurwC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;f=false Philosophy of Sikhism: Reality and Its Manifestations], Atlantic Publishers, pp. 115–122&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Guru Granth Sahib acknowledges  the Vedas, Puranas and Quran,&lt;ref&gt;William Owen Cole and Piara Singh Sambhi (1995), The Sikhs: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723134}}, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; it does not imply a [[Wiktionary|syncretic]] bridge between Hinduism and Islam,&lt;ref&gt;William Owen Cole and Piara Singh Sambhi (1995), The Sikhs: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723134}}, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; but emphasises focusing on nitnem banis like [[Japji Sahib|Japu]] (repeating [[mantra]] of the divine Name of God – Vaheguru), instead of Muslim practices such as circumcision or praying on a carpet, or Hindu rituals such as wearing thread or praying in a river.&lt;ref&gt;William Owen Cole and Piara Singh Sambhi (1995), The Sikhs: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723134}}, pp. 155–156&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dasam Granth===
[[File:Dasam.Granth.Frontispiece.BL.Manuscript.1825-1850.jpg|thumb|The Dasam Granth is a Sikh scripture which contains texts attributed to Guru Gobind Singh. The major narrative in the text is on [[Chaubis Avtar]] (24 [[Avatars]] of Hindu god [[Vishnu]]), [[Rudra]], [[Brahma]], the Hindu warrior goddess [[Chandi]] and a story of [[Rama]] in [[Bachittar Natak]].&lt;ref name=jdeol31&gt;J Deol (2000), Sikh Religion, Culture and Ethnicity (Editors: AS Mandair, C Shackle, G Singh), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700713899}}, pp. 31–33&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main article|Dasam Granth}}

The Dasam Granth is a scripture of Sikhs which contains texts attributed to the Guru Gobind Singh. The ''Dasam Granth'' is important to a great number of Sikhs, however it does not have the same authority as the ''Guru Granth Sahib''. Some compositions of the ''Dasam Granth'' like [[Jaap Sahib]], ([[Amrit Savaiye]]), and [[Chaupai (Sikhism)|Benti Chaupai]] are part of the daily prayers ([[Nitnem]]) for Sikhs.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Zaehner (1988), The Hutchinson Encyclopedia of Living Faiths, Hutchinson, {{ISBN|978-0091735760}}, pp. 426–427&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Dasam Granth'' is largely versions of Hindu mythology from the [[Puranas]], secular stories from a variety of sources called ''Charitro Pakhyan'' – tales to protect careless men from perils of lust.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Shackle and Arvind Mandair (2005), Teachings of the Sikh Gurus, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415266048}}, p. xx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William McLeod (2009), The A to Z of Sikhism, Toronto: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, {{ISBN|978-0810868281}}, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

Five versions of ''Dasam Granth'' exist, and the authenticity of the ''Dasam Granth'' is amongst the most debated topics within Sikhism. The text played a significant role in Sikh history, but in modern times parts of the text have seen antipathy and discussion among Sikhs.&lt;ref name=jdeol31/&gt;

===Janamsakhis===
{{Main article|Janamsākhīs}}

The Janamsākhīs (literally ''birth stories''), are writings which profess to be biographies of Nanak. Although not scripture in the strictest sense, they provide a [[hagiography|hagiographic]] look at Nanak's life and the early start of Sikhism. There are several – often contradictory and sometimes unreliable – Janamsākhīs and they are not held in the same regard as other sources of scriptural knowledge.

==Observances==
[[File:InsideSikhGurdwara.jpg|thumb|The [[Darbar Sahib Hall|Darbar Sahib]] of a [[Gurdwara]]]]
Observant Sikhs adhere to long-standing practices and traditions to strengthen and express their faith. The daily recitation of the divine name of God Vaheguru and from memory of specific passages from the Gurū Granth Sāhib, like the ''Japu'' (or ''Japjī'', literally ''chant'') hymns is recommended immediately after rising and bathing. Baptized Sikhs recite the five morning prayers, the evening and night prayer. Family customs include both reading passages from the scripture and attending the [[gurudwara|gurdwara]] (also ''gurduārā'', meaning ''the doorway to God''; sometimes transliterated as ''gurudwara''). There are many gurdwaras prominently constructed and maintained across India, as well as in almost every nation where Sikhs reside. Gurdwaras are open to all, regardless of religion, background, caste, or race.

Worship in a gurdwara consists chiefly of singing of passages from the scripture. Sikhs will commonly enter the gurdwara, touch the ground before the holy scripture with their foreheads. The recitation of the eighteenth century ''[[ardās]]'' is also customary for attending Sikhs. The ardās recalls past sufferings and glories of the community, invoking divine grace for all humanity.&lt;ref name="p260"&gt;{{cite book|last=Parrinder|first=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder|year=1971|title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present|publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited|location=United States|isbn=978-0-87196-129-7|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gurdwara is also the location for the historic Sikh practice of "[[Langar (Sikhism)|Langar]]" or the community meal. All gurdwaras are open to anyone of any faith for a free meal, always vegetarian.&lt;ref&gt;William Owen Cole and Piara Singh Sambhi (1995), The Sikhs: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723134}}, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; People eat together, and the kitchen is maintained and serviced by Sikh community volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark McWilliams|title=Food &amp; Material Culture: Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery 2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yj8QDgAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Oxford Symposium|isbn=978-1-909248-40-3|page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sikh festivals/events===
[[Guru Amar Das]] chose festivals for celebration by Sikhs like [[Vaisakhi]], wherein he asked Sikhs to assemble and share the festivities as a community.&lt;ref name="ColeSambhi1995p135"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William Owen Cole|author2=Piara Singh Sambhi|title=The Sikhs: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zIC_MgJ5RMUC&amp;pg=PA135|year= 1995|publisher= Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-898723-13-4|pages=135–136}}, Quote: "Since the time of Guru Amar Das it has been customary for Sikhs to assemble before their Guru.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kathleen Kuiper|title=The Culture of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c8PJFLeURhsC&amp;pg=PA127|year=2010|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-61530-149-2|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaisakhi is one of the most important festivals of Sikhs, while other significant festivals commemorate the birth, lives of the Gurus and Sikh martyrs. Historically, these festivals have been based on the moon calendar [[Bikrami calendar]].&lt;ref name=nesbittbc&gt;{{cite book|author=Eleanor Nesbitt|title=Sikhism: a Very Short Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XebnCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA122 |year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-874557-0|pages=122–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the [[SGPC]], the Sikh organisation in charge of upkeep of the historical gurdwaras of Punjab, adopted [[Nanakshahi]] calendar.&lt;ref name=nesbittbc/&gt; The new calendar is highly controversial among Sikhs and is not universally accepted. Sikh festivals include the following:
* [[Vaisakhi]] which includes Parades and Nagar Kirtan occurs on 13 April or 14 April. Sikhs celebrate it because on this day which fell on 30 March 1699, the tenth Guru, Gobind Singh, inaugurated the [[Khalsa]], the 11th body of Guru Granth Sahib and leader of Sikhs till eternity.
** [[Nagar Kirtan]] involves the processional singing of holy hymns throughout a community. While practiced at any time, it is customary in the month of Visakhi (or Vaisakhi). Traditionally, the procession is led by the saffron-robed Panj Piare (the five beloved of the Guru), who are followed by the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy Sikh scripture, which is placed on a float.

* [[Gurpurb]]s are celebrations or commemorations based on the lives of the Sikh gurus. They tend to be either birthdays or celebrations of Sikh martyrdom. All ten Gurus have Gurpurbs on the Nanakshahi calendar, but it is Guru Nanak and Guru Gobind Singh who have a gurpurb that is widely celebrated in Gurdwaras and Sikh homes. The martyrdoms are also known as a Shaheedi Gurpurbs, which mark the martyrdom anniversary of [[Guru Arjan]] and [[Guru Tegh Bahadur]].

Upon death, the body of a Sikh is usually cremated. If this is not possible, any respectful means of disposing the body may be employed. The ''kīrtan sōhilā'' and ''ardās'' prayers are performed during the funeral ceremony (known as ''[[Antam Sanskar|antim sanskār]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sgpc.net/sikhism/antam-sanskar.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020406164549/http://sgpc.net/sikhism/antam-sanskar.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=6 April 2002 |title=Sikh Reht Maryada&amp;nbsp;– Funeral Ceremonies (Antam Sanskar) |accessdate=8 June 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baptism and the Khalsa===

[[Khalsa]] (meaning "Sovereign") is the collective name given by Guru Gobind Singh to those Sikhs who have been initiated by taking part in a ceremony called ''[[ammrit sañcār]]'' (nectar ceremony).&lt;ref name="SinghFenech2014p23"/&gt; During this ceremony, sweetened water is stirred with a double-edged sword while liturgical prayers are sung; it is offered to the initiating Sikh, who ritually drinks it.&lt;ref name="SinghFenech2014p23"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh|author2=Louis E.

The initiated Sikh, considered reborn, is referred to as Khalsa Sikh, while those who do not get baptised are referred to as Kesdhari or Sahajdhari Sikhs.&lt;ref name="SinghFenech2014p23"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Louis E.

The first time that this ceremony took place was on [[Vaisakhi]], which fell on 30 March 1699 at [[Anandpur Sahib]] in Punjab.&lt;ref name="SinghFenech2014p23"/&gt; It was on that occasion that Gobind Singh baptised the [[Panj Piare|Pañj Piārē]] – the five beloved ones, who in turn baptised Guru Gobind Singh himself. To males who initiated, the last name Singh, meaning "lion", was given, while the last name Kaur, meaning "princess", was given to baptised Sikh females.&lt;ref name="SinghFenech2014p23"/&gt;

Baptised [[Sikhs]]  wear five items, called the [[Five Ks]] (in Punjabi known as ''pañj kakkē'' or ''pañj kakār''), at all times. The five items are: ''[[Kesh (Sikhism)|kēs]]'' (uncut hair), ''[[Kanga (Sikhism)|kaṅghā]]'' (small wooden comb), ''[[Kara (Sikhism)|kaṛā]]'' (circular steel or iron bracelet), ''[[kirpan|kirpān]]'' (sword/dagger), and ''[[kaccha|kacchera]]'' (special undergarment).&lt;ref name="SinghFenech2014p23"/&gt; The Five Ks have both practical and symbolic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Simmonds|first=David|year=1992|title=Believers All: A Book of Six World Religions|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn = 978-0-17-437057-4|pages=120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|History of Sikhism}}
Guru Nanak (1469–1539), the founder of Sikhism, was born in the village of ''Rāi Bhōi dī Talwandī'', now called [[Nankana Sahib]] (in present-day [[Pakistan]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Singh | first=Khushwant | authorlink=Khushwant Singh|year=2006|title=The Illustrated History of the Sikhs|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=India|isbn = 978-0-19-567747-8|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were [[Khatri]] [[Hindu]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Louis E.

Together they would sing devotional songs all night in front of the public, and bathe in the river in the morning. One day, at the usual bath, Nanak went missing and his family feared he had drowned. Three days later he returned home, and declared: "There is no Hindu, there is no Muslim" ("''nā kōi hindū nā kōi musalmān''"). Thereafter, Nanak started preaching his ideas that form the tenets of Sikhism. In 1526, Guru Nanak at age 50, started a small commune in Kartarpur and his disciples came to be known as ''Sikhs''.&lt;ref name=shacklexiii&gt;{{cite book|last=Shackle|first=Christopher|author2=Mandair, Arvind-pal Singh|year=2005|title=Teachings of the Sikh Gurus: Selections from the Sikh Scriptures|publisher=Routledge |location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-0-415-26604-8|pages=xiii–xiv|nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the exact account of his itinerary is disputed, hagiographic accounts state he made five major journeys, spanning thousands of miles, the first tour being east towards [[Bengal]] and [[Assam]], the second south towards [[Andhra Pradesh|Andhra]] and [[Tamil Nadu]], the third north to [[Kashmir]], [[Ladakh]], and [[Mount Meru|Mount Sumeru]]&lt;ref&gt;WH McLeod, Essays in Sikh History, Tradition and Society, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195682748}}, pp. 40–44&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Tibet]], and the fourth to [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Harjinder Singh Dilgeer|year=2008|title=Sikh Twareekh|publisher=The Sikh University Press|location=Belgium &amp; India}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his last and final tour, he returned to the banks of the Ravi River to end his days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Finegan|first=Jack|title=The Archeology of World Religions; the Background of Primitivism, Zoroastrianism, Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Shinto, Islam, and Sikhism|year=1952|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two competing theories on Guru Nanak's teachings.&lt;ref name=arvindmandair131&gt;Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair (2013), Sikhism: A Guide for the Perplexed, Bloomsbury Academic, {{ISBN|978-1441102317}}, pp. 131–134&lt;/ref&gt; One, according to Cole and Sambhi, is based on hagiographical [[Janamsakhis]],&lt;ref&gt;William Owen Cole and Piara Singh Sambhi (1995), The Sikhs: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723134}}, pp. 9–12&lt;/ref&gt; and states that Nanak's teachings and Sikhism were a revelation from God, and not a social protest movement nor any attempt to reconcile Hinduism and Islam in the 15th century.&lt;ref name="Cole_Sambhi_Dic"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Popular Dictionary of Sikhism: Sikh Religion and Philosophy | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |author1=W. Owen Cole |author2=Piara Singh Sambhi | year=1997 |page=71 | isbn=0203986091}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other states, Nanak was a [[Guru]]. According to Singha, "Sikhism does not subscribe to the theory of incarnation or the concept of prophethood. But it has a pivotal concept of Guru. He is not an incarnation of God, not even a prophet. He is an illumined soul."&lt;ref name="HS Singha 2009 page 104"/&gt; The hagiographical ''Janamsakhis'' were not written by Nanak, but by later followers without regard for historical accuracy, and contain numerous legends and myths created to show respect for Nanak.&lt;ref&gt;Nikky-Guninder Kaur Singh (2011), Sikhism: An Introduction, IB Tauris, {{ISBN|978-1848853218}}, pp. 2–8&lt;/ref&gt; The term revelation, clarify Cole and Sambhi, in Sikhism is not limited to the teachings of Nanak, they include all Sikh Gurus, as well as the words of past, present and future men and women, who possess divine knowledge intuitively through meditation. The Sikh revelations include the words of non-Sikh [[bhagat]]s, some who lived and died before the birth of Nanak, and whose teachings are part of the Sikh scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;William Owen Cole and Piara Singh Sambhi (1995), The Sikhs: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723134}}, pp. 52–53, 46, 95–96, 159&lt;/ref&gt; The Adi Granth and successive Sikh Gurus repeatedly emphasised, states Mandair, that Sikhism is "not about hearing voices from God, but it is about changing the nature of the human mind, and anyone can achieve direct experience and spiritual perfection at any time".&lt;ref name=arvindmandair131/&gt;

Scholars state that in its origins, Sikhism was influenced by the ''nirguni'' (formless God) tradition of [[Bhakti movement]] in medieval India.&lt;ref name="David Lorenzen 1995 pages 1-2"/&gt; Nanak was raised in a Hindu family and belonged to the Bhakti Sant tradition.&lt;ref name="encyclobritannicasikh"/&gt; The roots of the Sikh tradition are, states Louis Fenech, perhaps in the [[Sant (religion)|Sant]]-tradition of India whose ideology grew to become the Bhakti tradition.&lt;ref name="Louis Fenech 2014 page 35"/&gt; Furthermore, adds Fenech, "Indic mythology permeates the Sikh sacred canon, the ''Guru Granth Sahib'' and the secondary canon, the ''Dasam Granth'' and adds delicate nuance and substance to the sacred symbolic universe of the Sikhs of today and of their past ancestors".&lt;ref&gt;Louis Fenech (2014), in The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies (Editors: Pashaura Singh, Louis E. Fenech), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199699308}}, p. 36, Quote: "Few Sikhs would mention these Indic texts and ideologies in the same breadth as the Sikh tradition, let alone trace elements of their tradition to this chronological and ideological point, '''despite the fact''' that the Indic mythology permeates the Sikh sacred canon, the ''Guru Granth Sahib'' and the secondary canon, the ''Dasam Granth'' (Rinehart 2011), and adds delicate nuance and substance to the sacred symbolic universe of the Sikhs of today and of their past ancestors."&lt;/ref&gt;

The predominant ideology of the Sant ''parampara'' in turn corresponds in many respects to the much wider devotional Bhakti tradition in northern India."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclobritannicasikh&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/Sikhism Sikhism], Encyclopædia Britannica (2014), Quote: "In its earliest stage Sikhism was clearly a movement within the Hindu tradition; Nanak was raised a Hindu and eventually belonged to the Sant tradition of northern India,"&lt;/ref&gt; however, Sikhism was not simply an extension of the Bhakti movement.&lt;ref name="Singha"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pruthi"/&gt; Sikhism developed while the region was being ruled by the [[Mughal Empire]].

Guru Amar Das named his disciple and son-in-law ''Jēṭhā'' as the next Guru, who came to be known as [[Guru Ram Das]].

===Political advancement===
After the martyrdom of Guru Arjan, his son [[Guru Hargobind]] at age eleven became the sixth guru of the Sikhs and Sikhism dramatically evolved to become a political movement in addition to being religious.&lt;ref name=pashaura29&gt;Pashaura Singh (2005), [http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal_12_1/3_singh.pdf Understanding the Martyrdom of Guru Arjan], Journal of Punjab Studies, 12(1), pages 29-62&lt;/ref&gt; Guru Hargobind carried two swords, calling one spiritual and the other for temporal purpose (known as ''mīrī'' and ''pīrī'' in Sikhism).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mahmood|first=Cynthia |year=2002|title=A Sea of Orange|publisher=Xlibris|location=United States|isbn = 978-1-4010-2856-5|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}} According to the Sikh tradition, Guru Arjan asked his son Hargobind to start a military tradition to protect the Sikh people and always keep himself surrounded by armed Sikhs. The building of an armed Sikh militia began with Guru Hargobind.&lt;ref name=pashaura29/&gt; Guru Hargobind was soon arrested by the Mughals and kept in jail in Gwalior.

In 1644, Guru Hargobind named his grandson [[Guru Har Rai|Har Rai]] as the guru. The Mughal Emperor [[Shah Jahan]] attempted political means to undermine the Sikh tradition, by dividing and influencing the succession.&lt;ref name=mandair49/&gt; The Mughal ruler gave land grants to Dhir Mal, a grandson of Guru Hargobind living in Kartarpur, and attempted to encourage Sikhs to recognise Dhir Mal as the rightful successor to Guru Hargobind.&lt;ref name=mandair49/&gt; Dhir Mal issued statements in favour of the Mughal state, and critical of his grandfather [[Guru Arjan]].

Guru Har Rai is famed to have met Dara Shikoh during a time Dara Shikoh and his younger brother Aurangzeb were in a bitter succession fight. Aurangzeb summoned Guru Har Rai, who refused to go and sent his elder son Ram Rai instead.&lt;ref name="McLeod2014p260"/&gt; The emperor found a verse in the Sikh scripture insulting to Muslims, and Ram Rai agreed it was a mistake then changed it. Ram Rai thus pleased Aurangzeb, but displeased Guru Har Rai who excommunicated his elder son. He nominated his younger son [[Guru Har Krishan]] to succeed him in 1661. Aurangzeb responded by granting Ram Rai a [[jagir]] (land grant). Ram Rai founded a town there and enjoyed Aurangzeb's patronage, the town came to be known as Dehradun, after ''Dehra'' referring to Ram Rai's shrine.

====Sikh confederacy and the rise of the Khalsa====
[[Guru Gobind Singh]] inaugurated the [[Khalsa]] (the collective body of all [[Amrit Sanskar|initiated Sikhs]]) as the Sikh temporal authority in the year 1699. It created a community that combines its spiritual purpose and goals with political and military duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shani|first=Giorgio|title=Sikh Nationalism and Identity in a Global Age|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-42190-4|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="granthfinalguru"/&gt;&lt;ref name="parrinderp259"/&gt; Shortly before his death, Guru Gobind Singh proclaimed the [[Guru Granth Sahib|Gurū Granth Sāhib]] (the Sikh Holy Scripture) to be the ultimate spiritual authority for the Sikhs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfe|first=Alvin|title=Anthropological Contributions to Conflict Resolution|year=1996|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0-8203-1765-6|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bodyguard of Ranjit Singh.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Some bodyguard of [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]] at the Sikh capital, Lahore, Punjab]]
The Sikh Khalsa's rise to power began in the 17th century during a time of growing militancy against Mughal rule. The creation of a [[Sikh Empire]] began when Guru Gobind Singh sent a Sikh general, [[Banda Singh Bahadur]], to fight the Mughal rulers of India&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hansra|first=Harkirat|title=Liberty at Stake|year=2007|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-87563-4|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}} and those who had committed atrocities against [[Pir Buddhu Shah]]. Banda Singh advanced his army towards the main Muslim Mughal city of Sirhind and, following the instructions of the guru, punished all the culprits. Soon after the invasion of Sirhind, while resting in his chamber after the Rehras prayer Guru Gobind Singh was stabbed by a [[Pathan]] assassin hired by [[Mughals]]. Gobind Singh killed the attacker with his sword. Though a European surgeon stitched the Guru's wound, the wound re-opened as the Guru tugged at a hard strong bow after a few days, causing profuse bleeding that led to Gobind Singh's death.

After the Guru's death, Baba [[Banda Singh Bahadur]] became the commander-in-chief of the [[Khalsa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Armed Forces Year Book|year=1959|publisher=the University of California|page=419}}&lt;/ref&gt; He organised the civilian rebellion and abolished or halted the [[Zamindar]]i system in time he was active and gave the farmers [[Self-ownership|proprietorship]] of their own land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jawandha|first=Nahar|title=Glimpses of Sikhism|year=2010|publisher=Sanbun Publishers|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-93-80213-25-5|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banda Singh was executed by the emperor [[Farrukhsiyar|Farrukh Siyar]] after refusing the offer of a pardon if he converted to Islam. The [[Sikh Confederacy|confederacy of Sikh warrior bands]] known as ''[[misls]]'' emerged, but these fought between themselves. Ranjit Singh achieved a series of military victories and created a [[Sikh Empire]] in 1799.

The Sikh empire had its capital in [[Lahore]], spread over almost {{convert|200000|mi2|km2|abbr=off}} comprising what is now northwestern [[Indian subcontinent]]. The Sikh Empire entered into a treaty with the colonial British powers, with each side recognizing Sutlej River as the line of control and agreeing not to invade the other side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Khushwant|authorlink=Khushwant Singh|year=2006|title=The Illustrated History of the Sikhs|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=India|isbn = 978-0-19-567747-8|pages=47–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ranjit Singh's most lasting legacy was the restoration and expansion of the [[Harmandir Sahib]], most revered [[Gurudwara]] of the Sikhs, with marble and gold, from which the popular name of the "Golden Temple" is derived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eleanor Nesbitt|title=Sikhism: A Very Short Introduction|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XebnCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA64 |year= 2016|publisher= Oxford University Press|isbn= 978-0-19-874557-0|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of Ranjit Singh in 1839, the Sikh Empire fell into disorder.

====Singh Sabha movement====
The last Maharaja of the Sikh Empire Duleep Singh converted to Christianity in 1853, a controversial but influential event in Sikh history. Along with his conversion, and after Sikh Empire had been dissolved and the region made a part of the colonial British Empire, [[Proselytism|proselytising]] activities of [[Christian]]s, [[Brahmo Samaj]]is, [[Arya Samaj]], Muslim Anjuman-i-Islamia and Ahmadiyah sought to convert the Sikhs in northwestern Indian subcontinent into their respective faiths.&lt;ref name=barrierssm/&gt;&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica SSM"/&gt; These developments launched the [[Singh Sabha Movement]].&lt;ref name=barrierssm&gt;NG Barrier and Nazar Singh (2015), [http://www.learnpunjabi.org/eos/index.aspx Singh Sabha Movement], Encyclopedia of Sikhism, Harbans Singh (Editor in Chief), Punjab University&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica SSM"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Singh-Sabha |title=Singh Sabha (Sikhism)|author= Editors of Encyclopedia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|year= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sikhs sought to revive Sikhism in late 19th century.

====Partition====
Sikhs participated and contributed to the decades-long Indian independence movement from the colonial rule in the first half of the 20th century. Ultimately when the British Empire recognized independent India, the land was partitioned into Hindu majority India and Muslim majority Pakistan (East and West) in 1947. This event, states Banga, was a watershed event in Sikh history.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99-100}}&lt;ref name="Shani2007p86"&gt;{{cite book|author=Giorgio Shani|title=Sikh Nationalism and Identity in a Global Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HKu66SixH6AC |year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-10189-4|pages=86–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sikhs had historically lived in northwestern region of Indian subcontinent on both sides of the partition line ("Radcliffe line"). According to Banga and other scholars, the Sikhs had strongly opposed the Muslim League demands and saw it as "perpetuation of Muslim domination" and anti-Sikh policies in what just a 100 years before was a part of the Sikh Empire. During the discussions with the colonial authorities, Tara Singh emerged as an important leader who campaigned to prevent the partition and for the recognition of Sikhs as the third community.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99-100}} In 1940, a few Sikhs such as the victims of [[Komagata Maru incident|Komagata Maru in Canada]] proposed the idea of Khalistan as a buffer state between Pakistan and India.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99-103}} These leaders, however, were largely ignored.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99-100}}&lt;ref name="Shani2007p86"/&gt; Many other Sikh leaders supported the partition along religious and demographic lines.&lt;ref name="Mann2014p81"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Mann|title=South Asia’s Modern History: Thematic Perspectives|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TBscBQAAQBAJ |year =2014|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-62446-2|pages=81–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When partition was announced, the newly created line divided the Sikh population into two halves. The Sikhs suffered organized violence and riots against them in West Pakistan, and Sikhs moved en masse to the Indian side leaving behind their property and the sacred places of Sikhism. This reprisals on Sikhs were not one sided, because as Sikhs entered the Indian side, the Muslims in East Punjab experienced reprisals and they moved to West Pakistan.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99–100}}&lt;ref name="Mann2014p81"/&gt; Before the partition, Sikhs constituted about 15% of the population in West Punjab that became a part of Pakistan, the majority being Muslims (55%). The Sikhs were the economic elite and wealthiest in West Punjab, with them having the largest representation in West Punjab's aristocracy, nearly 700 Gurdwaras and 400 educational institutions that served the interests of the Sikhs.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99–103}} Prior to the partition, there were a series of disputes between the majority Muslims and minority Sikhs, such as on the matters of [[jhatka]] versus [[halal]] meat, the disputed ownership of [[Shaheed Ganj Mosque|Gurdwara Sahidganj]] in Lahore which Muslims sought as a mosque and Sikhs as a Gurdwara, and the insistence of the provincial Muslim government in switching from Indian [[Gurmukhi]] script to Arabic-Persian [[Nastaliq]] script in schools.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99–100}} During and after the Simla Conference in June 1945, headed by Lord Wavell, the Sikh leaders initially expressed their desire to be recognized as the third party, but ultimately relegated their demands and sought a United India where Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims would live together, under a Swiss style constitution. The Muslim League rejected this approach, demanding that entire Punjab should be granted to Pakistan.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99–104}} The Sikh leaders then sought the partition instead, and Congress Working Committee passed a resolution in support of partitioning Punjab and Bengal.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99–104}}
[[File:Sikh Light Infantry.jpg|thumb|[[Sikh Light Infantry]] personnel march past during the Republic day parade in [[New Delhi]], India]]

Between March and August 1947, a series of riots, arson, plunder of Sikh property, assassination of Sikh leaders, and killings in Jhelum districts, Rawalpindi, Attock and other places made Tara Singh call the situation in Punjab as "civil war", while Lord Mountbatten stated "civil war preparations were going on". The riots had triggered the early waves of migration in April, with some 20,000 people leaving northwest Punjab and moving to Patiala.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=104–105}}&lt;ref name="Shani2007p86"/&gt; In Rawalpindi, 40,000 people became homeless. The Sikh leaders made desperate petitions, but all religious communities were suffering in the political turmoil. Sikhs, states Banga, were "only 4 million out of a total of 28 million in Punjab, and 6 million out of nearly 400 million in India; they did not constitute the majority, not even in a single district".{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=104-105}}&lt;ref name="Wolpert2010p9"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanley Wolpert|title=India and Pakistan: Continued Conflict or Cooperation?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sbEvmBKPgBoC |year=2010|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-94800-6|pages=9–12, 16–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the partition line was formally announced in August 1947, the violence was unprecedented, with Sikhs being one of the most affected religious community both in terms of deaths, as well as property loss, injury, trauma and disruption.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=108–111}}&lt;ref name="Mann2014p81"/&gt; Sikhs and Muslims were both victims and perpetrators of retaliatory violence against each other. Estimates range between 200,000 and 2 million deaths of Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=108-111}}&lt;ref name="Mann2014p81"/&gt; There were numerous rapes of and mass suicides by Sikh women, they being taken captives, their rescues and above all a mass exodus of Sikhs from newly created Pakistan into newly created India. The partition created the "largest foot convoy of refugees recorded in [human] history, stretching over 100 kilometer long", states Banga, with nearly 300,000 people consisting of mostly "distraught, suffering, injured and angry Sikhs". Sikh and Hindu refugees from Pakistan flooded into India, Muslim refugees from India flooded into Pakistan, each into their new homeland.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=108–111}}&lt;ref name="Wolpert2010p9"/&gt;

====Khalistan====
[[File:Thousands-Sikhs-protest-in-London.jpg|thumb|Sikhs in [[London]] protesting against Indian government]]
The early 1980s witnessed some Sikh groups seeking an independent nation named [[Khalistan]] carved out from India and Pakistan. The Golden Temple and Akal Takht were occupied by various militant groups in 1982. These included the [[Dharam Yudh Morcha]] led by [[Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale]], the Babbar Khalsa, the AISSF and the National Council of Khalistan.&lt;ref name="Chima2008p85"/&gt; Between 1982 and 1983, there were [[Anandpur Resolution]] demand-related terrorist attacks against civilians in parts of India.&lt;ref name=horowitz482/&gt; By late 1983, the Bhindranwale led group had begun to build bunkers and observations posts in and around the Golden Temple, with militants involved in weapons training.&lt;ref name="Chima2008p85"/&gt; In June 1984, the then [[Prime Minister of India]] [[Indira Gandhi]] ordered Indian Army to begin [[Operation Blue Star]] against the militants.&lt;ref name="Chima2008p85"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jugdep S Chima|title=The Sikh Separatist Insurgency in India: Political Leadership and Ethnonationalist Movements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qJaHAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA85|date= 2008|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-81-321-0538-1|pages=85–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fierce engagement took place in the precincts of Darbar Sahib and resulted in many deaths, including Bhindranwale, the destruction of the Sikh Reference Library, which was considered a national treasure that contained over a thousand rare manuscripts,&lt;ref name="mann 114"/&gt;&gt; and destroyed Akal Takht. Numerous soldiers, civilians and militants died in the cross fire. Within days of the Operation Bluestar, some 2,000 Sikh soldiers in India mutinied and attempted to reach Amritsar to liberate the Golden Temple.&lt;ref name="Chima2008p85"/&gt; Within six months, on 31 October 1984, Indira Gandhi's Sikh bodyguards [[Assassination of Indira Gandhi|assassinated her]].

The Sikhs and their neighbors, for most part, ignored attempts to provoke riots and communal strife.&lt;ref name=horowitz482/&gt;

Estimates state that Sikhism has some 25 million followers worldwide.&lt;ref name="encyclobritannicasikh"/&gt; According to Pew Research, a religion demographics and research group in Washington DC, "more than nine-in-ten Sikhs are in India, but there are also sizable Sikh communities in the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-other/ The Global Religious Landscape: Other Religions], Pew Research Center, Washington DC&lt;/ref&gt; Within India, the Sikh population is founded in every state and union territory, but it is predominantly found the northwestern and northern states.

Sikhism was founded in northwestern region of the Indian subcontinent in what is now Pakistan. Some of the Gurus were born near [[Lahore]] and in other parts of Pakistan. Prior to 1947, in British India, millions of Sikhs lived in what later became Pakistan. During the partition, Sikhs and Hindus left the newly created Muslim-majority Pakistan and moved to Hindu-majority India, while Muslims in India left and moved to Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=L.A.

===Sikh sects===

Sikh sects are sub-traditions within Sikhism that believe in an alternate lineage of Gurus, or have a different interpretation of the Sikh scriptures, or believe in following a living guru, or other concepts that differ from the orthodox Khalsa Sikhs.&lt;ref name="Syan2014p170"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hardip Singh Syan|editor=Pashaura Singh and Louis E.

===Sikh castes===
[[File:Nagar Kirtan.jpg|thumb|[[Nagar Kirtan]] in [[Bangalore]]]]
According to Surinder Jodhka, the state of Punjab with a Sikh majority has the "largest proportion of [[Dalit|scheduled caste]] population in India". Although decried by Sikhism, Sikhs have practiced a caste system. The system, along with untouchability, has been more common in rural parts of Punjab.The landowning dominant Sikh castes, states Jodhka, "have not shed all their prejudices against the lower castes or [[dalits]]; while dalits would be allowed entry into the village gurdwaras they would not be permitted to cook or serve langar." The Sikh dalits of Punjab have tried to build their own gurdwara, other local level institutions and sought better material circumstances and dignity. According to Jodhka, due to economic mobility in contemporary Punjab, castes no longer mean an inherited occupation nor are work relations tied to a single location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jodhka|first1=Surinder S|title=Caste and Untouchability in Rural Punjab|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=11–17 May 2002|volume= 37|issue=19|page=1822|jstor=4412102}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1953, the government of India acceded to the demands of the Sikh leader, [[Tara Singh (activist)|Master Tara Singh]], to include Sikh dalit castes in the list of scheduled castes.&lt;ref name="Harish K. Puri 2004"&gt;{{cite book|title=Dalits in Regional Context|author=Harish K.

Over 60% of Sikhs belong to the [[Jat Sikh|Jat]] caste, which is an agrarian caste. Despite being very small in numbers, the mercantile [[Khatri]] and [[Arora]] castes wield considerable influence within the Sikh community. Other common Sikh castes include [[Saini]]s, [[Sikh Rajput|Rajputs]], [[Ramgarhia]]s (artisans), [[Ahluwalia]]s (formerly brewers), [[Kamboj]]s (rural caste), [[Labana]]s, [[Kumhar]]s and the two Dalit castes, known in Sikh terminology as the [[Mazhabi]]s (the Chuhras) and the [[Ramdasia]]s (the Chamars).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Encyclopedia|first1=Britannica|title=Sikhism (religion)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/543916/Sikhism/253170/The-rejection-of-caste|website=britannica.com|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sikhism is [[Major religious groups#Religious demographics|the ninth-largest amongst the major world religions]], and one of the youngest.&lt;ref name="Partridge2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Partridge|title=Introduction to World Religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z3AjAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA429|date=1 November 2013|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=978-0-8006-9970-3|pages=429–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McDowellBrown2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael McDowell|author2=Nathan Robert Brown|title=World Religions at Your Fingertips|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K0_dHrRY3gIC&amp;pg=PA232|year=2009|publisher=Alpha Books|isbn=978-1-59257-846-7|pages=232–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Teece2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoff Teece|title=Sikhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kJO1WIABhPQC&amp;pg=PA4|year=2005|publisher=Black Rabbit Books|isbn=978-1-58340-469-0|pages=4–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide, there are 25.8 million Sikhs, which makes up 0.39% of the world's population. Approximately 75% of Sikhs live in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], where they constitute over 50% of the state's population. Large communities of Sikhs migrate to the neighboring states such as Indian State of Haryana which is home to the second largest Sikh population in India with 1.1 million Sikhs as per 2001 census, and large immigrant communities of Sikhs can be found across India. However, Sikhs only comprise about 2% of the Indian population.&lt;ref name="Singh Kalsi 2007 12"&gt;{{cite book |title= Sikhism|last= Singh Kalsi|first= Sewa|year= 2007|publisher= Bravo Ltd.|location= London|isbn= 978-1-85733-436-4|page= 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sikh migration to [[Canada]] began in the 19th century and led to the creation of significant Sikh communities, predominantly in South [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Surrey, British Columbia]], and [[Brampton, Ontario]]. Today temples, newspapers, radio stations, and markets cater to these large, multi-generational [[Indo-Canadians|Indo-Canadian]] groups. Sikh festivals such as Vaisakhi and [[Bandi Chhor Divas|Bandi Chhor]] are celebrated in those Canadian cities by the largest groups of followers in the world outside the Punjab.

Sikhs also migrated to East Africa, West Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia. These communities developed as Sikhs migrated out of Punjab to fill in gaps in imperial labour markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Ballantyne|first=Tony|year=2006|title=Between Colonialism and Diaspora: Sikh Cultural Formations in an Imperial World|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn = 978-0-8223-3824-6|pages=69–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early twentieth century a significant community began to take shape on the west coast of the United States. Smaller populations of Sikhs are found within many countries in Western Europe, Mauritius, Malaysia, Philippines, Fiji, Nepal, China, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Singapore, United States, and many other countries.

==Prohibitions in Sikhism==
{{further information|Prohibitions in Sikhism|Diet in Sikhism}}
Some major prohibitions include:

# Cutting Hair: Cutting hair is forbidden in Sikhism for those who have taken the [[Amrit Sanchar|Amrit]] initiation ceremony. These Amritdhari or [[Khalsa]] Sikhs are required to keep unshorn hair.
#Intoxication: Consumption of alcohol, non-medicinal drugs, tobacco, and other intoxicants is forbidden in Sikhism according to the "Sikh Rahit Maryada".&lt;ref name="Morgan2007p138"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;HS Singha (2009), The Encyclopedia of Sikhism, Hemkunt Press, {{ISBN|978-8170103011}}, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; A Khalsa Amritdhari Sikh who consumes any intoxicant is considered ''patit'' lapsed, and may be readmitted into Khalsa only if re-baptised. In contrast, [[Nihang]]s of Sikh tradition who protect Sikh shrines wearing visible and ready weaponry along with their notable blue turbans, practice meditation with the aid of cannabis.&lt;ref name="Morgan2007p138"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peggy Morgan|title=Ethical Issues in Six Religious Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vt-qBgAAQBAJ |year=2007|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-3002-8|pages=138–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sehajdari Sikhs, in practice however, socially consume some alcohol; the prohibition on smoking is practiced almost universally by all Sikhs.&lt;ref name="Morgan2007p138"/&gt;
# Priestly Class: Sikhism does not have priests, but does have liturgical service which employs people for a salary to sing hymns ([[Kirtan]]), officiate an [[Ardās]] Puja or marriage, and perform services at a Gurdwara.&lt;ref name=colesambhi65&gt;William Owen Cole and Piara Singh Sambhi (1995), The Sikhs: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723134}}, pp. 18, 65&lt;/ref&gt; Any Sikh can become a [[Granthi]] to look after the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], and any Sikh is free to read from the Guru Granth Sahib.&lt;ref name=colesambhi65/&gt;
# Eating Halal Meat: Both initiated and uninitiated Sikhs are strictly prohibited from eating meat from animals slaughtered by the [[Dhabihah|halal]] method, known as [[Kutha meat]], where the animal is killed by pronouncing the name of Allah and then [[exsanguination]] (via throat-cutting).&lt;ref&gt;Sikhs and Sikhism, Dr. I.J.Singh, Manohar Publishers.{{ISBN|978-8173040580}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eleanor Nesbitt, on the general issue of vegetarianism versus non-vegetarianism, there is no definitive instruction in the Sikh code. In an Adi Granth verse, Guru Nanak responds to Hindu Brahmins who teach that it is polluting to eat meat by saying that as human beings, we are part of the chain of life, and even plants are living organisms. In other verses, Guru Nanak says that "Fools wrangle about eating meat", and calls out the Pandits by saying that "The eating of meat is considered sinful, but gratifying of greed is held good", in essence teaching that quelling the cruelty of the human mind is supreme rather than mere abstaining from eating meat.&lt;ref name=HumanistNanak&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir Jogendra Singh &amp; Sir Daljit Singh|title=The Great Humanist Guru Nanak|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xTnMq54D-toC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=nanak+fool+meat&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjhpeKY7KnYAhVGKWMKHWgxAJkQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=nanak%20fool%20meat&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban on ''kutha meat'' (taken along with ban on sexual relations with Muslims and a ban on smoking – a habit common among 18th-century Indian Muslims), states Nesbitt, may have been meant for Sikhs to have a social separation from the Muslims due to the 17th- and 18th-century resistance of the Sikhs to the oppression of the Mughal and Afghan armies (both formed of Muslims).&lt;ref name=nesbitt63&gt;{{cite book|author=Eleanor Nesbitt|title=Sikhism: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ysRDAAAQBAJ|year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-106276-6|pages=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amritdhari Sikhs, or those baptised with the ''Amrit'', have been strict vegetarians, abstaining from all meat and eggs.&lt;ref name=nesbitt63/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[a] {{cite journal|author1-last=Nesbitt|author1-first=Eleanor|title=Splashed with goodness: The many meanings of Amrit for young British Sikhs|journal=[[Journal of Contemporary Religion]]|year=1997|volume=12|issue=1|page=27|doi=10.1080/13537909708580787}}&lt;br&gt;[b] {{cite book|author1-last=Nesbitt|author1-first=Eleanor|editor1-last=Coakley|editor1-first=Sarah|title=Religion and the Body|year=2000|page=299|quote=But for many Sikhs it is as unthinkable as it would be for many Hindus that a holy person as the Guru could have eaten flesh.

'''Sirkap''' ([[Urdu]] and {{lang-pnb|{{nq|سر کپ}}}}) is the name of an [[archaeology|archaeological]] site on the bank opposite to the city of [[Taxila]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]].

The city of Sirkap was built by the [[Greco-Bactrian]] king [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius]] after he invaded ancient [[India]] around 180 BC. Demetrius founded in the northern and northwestern modern Pakistan an [[Indo-Greek]] kingdom that was to last until around 10 BC. Sirkap is also said to have been rebuilt by king [[Menander I]]. 

The excavation of the old city was carried out under the supervision of [[John Marshall (archaeologist)|Sir John Marshall]] by Hergrew from 1912–1930. In 1944 and 1945 further parts were excavated by [[Mortimer Wheeler]] and his colleagues.

The site of Sirkap was built according to the "[[Hippodamian]]" grid-plan characteristic of Greek cities. It is organized around one main avenue and fifteen perpendicular streets, covering a surface of around {{convert|1200|x|400|m|sp=us}}, with a surrounding wall {{convert|5|-|7|m|sp=us}} wide and {{convert|4.8|km|sp=us}} long. The ruins are Greek in character, similar to those of [[Olynthus]] in [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]].

[[File:NereidAndKetos.JPG|thumb|left|A [[Nereid]] riding a [[Ketos]] sea-monster, stone palette, Sirkap, 2nd century BC.]]
Numerous Hellenistic artifacts have been found, in particular coins of Greco-Bactrian kings and stone palettes representing Greek mythological scenes. Some of them are purely Hellenistic, others indicate an evolution of the [[Greco-Bactrian]] styles found at [[Ai-Khanoum]] towards more indianized styles. For example, accessories such as Indian ankle bracelets can be found on some representations of Greek mythological figures such as [[Artemis]].

Following its construction by the Greeks, the city was further rebuilt during the incursions of the [[Indo-Scythians]], and later by the [[Indo-Parthians]] after an earthquake in 30 AD. [[Gondophares]], the first king of the [[Indo-Parthian Kingdom]], built parts of the city including the double headed eagle stupa and the temple of the sun god. The city was overtaken by the [[Kushan]] kings who abandoned it and built a new city at [[Sirsukh]], about {{convert|1.5|km|abbr=on}} to the north-east.

==Religious buildings==
[[Buddhist]] [[stupa]]s with strong [[Hellenistic]] decorative elements can be found throughout the Sirkap site (Stupa of the two eagles [https://web.archive.org/web/20061021053629/http://www.web.virginia.edu/asianarc/public/taxila/eagle02.jpg]), a [[Jain temple]]{{Sfn|Samad|2011|p=71}}, as well as a [[Hindu]] temple, indicating a close interaction of religious cultures. A Greek religious temple of the [[Ionic order]] is also visible at the nearby site of [[Jandial]] ({{convert|650|m|sp=us}} from Sirkap), but there is a possibility that it may have been dedicated to a [[Zoroastrian]] cult.

The site of Sirkap bears witness to the city-building activity of the [[Indo-Greeks]] during their occupation of the Indian territory for close to two centuries, as well as their integration of other faiths, especially Buddhism.

===Round stupa===
One round Stupa is present at Sirkap. It is one of the oldest Stupas in the Indian-Subcontinent. It is assumed that this Stupa was uprooted and thrown to its present location by a strong earthquake in the 1st century AD. When the new city was built later, the Stupa was kept by building a protecting wall around it.
[[File:SirkapRoundStupa.JPG|thumb| The round Stupa at Sirkap.]]

===Apsidal Temple===
The building that is known as the Apsidal Temple is the largest sanctuary of Sirkap, measuring about {{convert|70|by|40|m|sp=us}} (by contrast: the Parthenon in Athens is {{convert|70|by|31|m|sp=us}}). The Apsidal Temple consists of a square nave with several rooms, used by the Buddhist monks, and a circular room, which gives the building its apsidal shape. After the earthquake that destroyed the city in c. 30 AD, the Buddhist shrine was built in a spacious courtyard. The round part was probably in use for a small stupa, but no traces of it remain. Some carvings were probably done by an artist from Greece.

===Double-Headed Eagle Stupa===
A special Stupa at Sirkap is the so-called 'Double-Headed Eagle Stupa'. The pilasters here are of a Greek design, "Corinthian columns". In the middle arch, a Greek temple is shown; in the outer, a shrine of a Hindu design can be seen. On top of these sanctuaries, a [[Double-headed eagle]] is seated from which the name of the Stupa has been derived. This motive is rather odd, to say the least, as it is originally [[Babylonia|Babylonian]]. It seems to have spread to [[Scythia]], and introduced in the [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] by the [[Saka]] rulers.

===Dharmarajika Stupa===
The nearby [[Dharmarajika Stupa]], is a large [[stupa]] that dates from the 2nd century CE.&lt;ref name=gounesco&gt;{{cite web|title=Dharmarajika: The Great Stupa of Taxila|url=http://www.gounesco.com/dharmarajika-great-stupa-of-taxila/|website=GoUNESCO|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=22 June 2017|date=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stupa was built to house relics of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]],&lt;ref name=scarre&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scarre|first1=Geoffrey|last2=Coningham|first2=Robin|title=Appropriating the Past: Philosophical Perspectives on the Practice of Archaeology|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521196062|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=djEKducJvNAC&amp;pg=PA290&amp;dq=dharmarajika+taxila+relics&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjkxrnL0tLUAhUDw2MKHVDJDOQQ6AEIMzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=dharmarajika%20taxila%20relics&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while several monastic buildings were built around the stupa.

==Visit by Apollonius of Tyana==
The Greek philosopher [[Apollonius of Tyana]] is related to have visited ancient India, and specifically the city of [[Taxila]] in the 1st century AD. He describes constructions of the Greek type, probably referring to Sirkap:

:"Taxila, they tell us, is about as big as [[Nineveh]], and was fortified fairly well after the manner of Greek cities".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_2_16.html#§20 (Life of Apollonius Tyana, II 20)]&lt;/ref&gt;

:"I have already described the way in which the city is walled, but they say that it was divided up into narrow streets in the same irregular manner as in Athens, and that the houses were built in such a way that if you look at them from outside they had only one story, while if you went into one of them, you at once found subterranean chambers extending as far below the level of the earth as did the chambers above."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_2_21.html#§23 (Life of Apollonius Tyana, II 23)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Svetlana Iosifovna Alliluyeva''' ({{lang-ru|Светла́на Ио́сифовна Аллилу́ева}}; {{nee|'''Stalina'''}}; {{Lang-ru|link=no|Сталина}}; 28 February 1926 – 22 November 2011), later known as '''Lana Peters''', was the youngest child and only daughter of Soviet Premier [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Nadezhda Alliluyeva]], Stalin's second wife. In 1967, she caused an international furore when she [[Defection|defected]] to, and later became a [[Naturalization|naturalised]] citizen of, the [[United States]]. In 1984, she returned to the Soviet Union and had her Soviet citizenship returned. She later went back to the United States and also spent time in France, before settling in the United Kingdom and becoming a British citizen in 1992. She was Stalin’s last surviving child.&lt;ref name="time002"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,843812,00.html "Land of Opportunity"], ''TIME'' 26 May 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:Lavrenti Beria Stalins family.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A young Svetlana Alliluyeva sitting on [[Lavrentiy Beria]]'s lap, with Stalin (in the background, smoking his pipe) and [[Nestor Lakoba]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rulit.me/books/stalin-the-court-of-the-red-tsar-read-270681-226.html Simon Sebag Montefiore "Stalin: Court of the Red Tsar" Random House, 2005 page 226 (photo with Stalin, Beria and Lakoba)]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Svetlana Alliluyeva was born on 28 February 1926.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; Like most children of high-ranking [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] officials, she was raised by a nanny and only saw her parents occasionally.{{cn|date=December 2017}} On 9 November 1932, her mother, [[Nadezhda Alliluyeva|Nadezhda]], shot herself in the head following a public spat with Stalin at a dinner party over the effects of the government's collectivisation policies on the peasantry. She was 31 years old.&lt;ref name="spat" /&gt; The official announcement was that Nadezhda died from [[appendicitis]].&lt;ref &gt;{{cite book|author=Kotkin, Stephen|title=Stalin: Waiting for Hitler, 1929-1941|year=2017|pages=110–111|isbn=9781594203794}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spat"&gt;{{cite news|title=Stalin's women|date=29 June 2003|url=http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/7244-12.cfm|work=Sunday Times (UK)|accessdate=26 March 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031121181425/http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/7244-12.cfm|archivedate=21 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
On 15 August 1942, [[Winston Churchill]] saw Alliluyeva in Stalin's private apartments at the Kremlin, describing her as "a handsome red-haired girl, who kissed her father dutifully".  Churchill says Stalin "looked at me with a twinkle in his eye as if, so I thought, to convey 'You see, even we [[Bolsheviks]] have a family life.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Winston S. Churchill|title=The Hinge of Fate|work=The Second World War|volume=Book II: Africa redeemed|chapter=XXVIII: Moscow: A Relationship Established – section: He invites me to an impromptu dinner|page=404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of sixteen, Alliluyeva fell in love with [[Aleksei Kapler]], a Jewish Soviet filmmaker who was 38 years old. Her father vehemently disapproved of the relationship and ordered Kapler to be sentenced to ten years in [[Gulag|labour camps]] near [[Vorkuta]] and [[Inta]].&lt;ref Name="Telegraph"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/politics-obituaries/8922681/Lana-Peters.html ''The Telegraph'' obituary for Stalin's daughter, Svetlana Alliluyeva (aka Lana Peters)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriages==
Aged seventeen, Alliluyeva was proposed to by [[Grigory Morozov]] (1921–2001), a fellow student at [[Moscow University]]. Her father grudgingly allowed the couple to marry, although he made a point of never meeting the groom. A son, [[Joseph Alliluyev|Iosif]], was born in 1945. The couple divorced in 1947, but remained close friends for decades afterwards.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;

Alliluyeva's second marriage was arranged for her to [[Yuri Zhdanov]], the son of Stalin's right-hand man [[Andrei Zhdanov]] and himself one of Stalin's close associates. The couple got married in 1949. In 1950, Alliluyeva gave birth to a daughter, Yekaterina. The marriage was dissolved soon afterwards.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; In 1962, she married [[Ivan Svanidze]], the nephew of Stalin through his first wife, Ekaterine "Kato" Svanidze. Her third marriage also proved to be short-lived, and ended in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Sullivan (2015). Stalin's Daughter: The Extraordinary and Tumultuous Life of Svetlana Alliluyeva. HarperCollins. pp. 230, 232. {{ISBN|1443414441}} – via Google Books.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, Alliluyeva lived with an Indian Communist politician named [[Brajesh Singh]].{{cn|date=December 2017}} They were not officially married, but they lived together for four years until his death in 1967; she left for the United States afterwards.{{huh|date=March 2017}} From 1970-73, she was married to American architect [[William Wesley Peters]] (an acolyte of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]), with whom she had a daughter, Olga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Scott Bauer|date=28 November 2011|agency=AP|url=https://news.yahoo.com/stalins-daughter-lana-peters-dies-85-200721334.html|title=Stalin's daughter Lana Peters dies at 85|publisher=News.yahoo.com|access-date=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the death of Stalin==
After her father's death in 1953, Alliluyeva worked as a lecturer and translator in [[Moscow]]. Her training was in History and Political thought, a subject she was forced to study by her father, although her true passion was literature and writing.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/29/world/europe/stalins-daughter-dies-at-85.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin forbade his daughter to be taught in these subjects. She had also studied four languages since childhood, including: English, French, and German, and was fluent in all. She was granted a pension with which she supported herself and her two Russian-born children.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

==Relationship with Brajesh Singh==
In 1963, while in hospital for a [[tonsillectomy]], Alliluyeva  met [[Brajesh Singh|Kunwar Brajesh Singh]], an [[Communist Party of India|Indian Communist]] from the Kalakankar Rajput Zamindar family visiting Moscow. The two fell in love. Singh was mild-mannered and well-educated but gravely ill with [[bronchiectasis]] and [[emphysema]]. The romance grew deeper and stronger still while the couple were recuperating in [[Sochi]] near the [[Black Sea]]. Singh returned to Moscow in 1965 to work as a translator, but he and Alliluyeva were not allowed to marry. He died the following year, in 1966. She was allowed to travel to [[India]] to take his ashes to his family to pour into the [[Ganges]] river. She stayed in the family home in [[Kalakankar]] on the banks of the Ganges for three months and became immersed in local customs, leading to her abandonment of [[atheism]]. In an interview on 26 April 1967, she referred to Singh as her husband but also stated that they were never allowed to marry officially.&lt;ref&gt;ABC News Time Tunnel, re-broadcast 26 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political asylum and later life==
[[File:Svetlana Alliluyeva 1967.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Alliluyeva in 1967]]
On 6 March 1967, Alliluyeva approached the [[Embassy of the United States, New Delhi|United States Embassy in New Delhi]]. After she stated her desire to defect in writing, the United States Ambassador [[Chester Bowles]] offered her [[political asylum]] and a new life in the United States.

{{Quote|At about nine o’clock p.m. in India, eleven in the morning Washington time, I said, "I have a person here who states she's Stalin's daughter, and we believe she's genuine; unless you instruct me to the contrary, I’m putting her on the one a.m. plane for [[Rome]] where we can stop and think the thing through. I’m not giving her any commitment that she can come to the States. I’m only enabling her to leave India, and we will see her to some part of the world—the U.S. or somewhere else—where she can settle in peace. If you disagree with this, let me know before midnight." No comment ever came from Washington. This is one advantage that non-career Ambassadors have; they can go ahead and do unorthodox things without anybody objecting, where a Foreign Service officer might not dare do it.

We talked to her and said, "Point number one—are you really sure that you want to leave home? You’ve got a daughter and a son there, and this is a big step to take. Have you really thought it through? You could go back to the Russian embassy right now (she was staying there in their dormitory) and simply go to sleep and forget it, and get up Wednesday morning and on to Moscow, as your schedule calls for." She immediately said, "If this is your decision, I shall go to the press tonight; and announce that (a) democratic India will not take me (they had turned her down prior to her coming) and (b), now democratic America refuses to take me." Well, she didn't need to do it; I was just trying it on for size to be sure she had thought it through. But she was very quick on this.|Chester Bowles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bowles|first=Chester|title=The Day Stalin's Daughter Asked for Asylum in the U.S.|url=http://adst.org/2013/02/the-day-stalins-daughter-asked-for-asylum-in-the-u-s/|publisher=[[The Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training]]: Foreign Affairs Oral History Project|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Alliluyeva accepted. The Indian government feared condemnation by the Soviet Union, so she was immediately sent from India to Rome. When the [[Qantas]] flight arrived in Rome,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Day Stalin's Daughter Asked for Asylum in the U.S.|url=http://adst.org/2013/02/the-day-stalins-daughter-asked-for-asylum-in-the-u-s/|work=Moments in U.S. Diplomatic History|publisher=Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alliluyeva immediately travelled further to [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], where the government arranged her a [[tourist visa]] and accommodation for six weeks. She travelled to the United States, leaving her adult children in the USSR. Upon her arrival in New York City in April 1967, she gave a press conference denouncing her father's legacy and the Soviet government.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;  She intended to publish an autobiographical book ''Twenty Letters to a Friend'' on the fiftieth anniversary of the [[October Revolution]].{{cn|date=December 2017}}

After living for several months in [[Mill Neck, New York|Mill Neck, Long Island]] under Secret Service protection, Alliluyeva moved to [[Princeton, New Jersey]], where she lectured and wrote, later moving to nearby [[Pennington, New Jersey|Pennington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Patricia|last=Blake|title=Personalities the Saga of Stalin's "Little Sparrow"|date=8 January 1985|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959280,00.html|work=Time|accessdate=10 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Bev|last=Tucker|title=Pennington Piano Teacher Remembers Stalin's Daughter and Granddaughter|date=2 August 2006|url=http://www.towntopics.com/aug0206/mailbox.html|work=[[Town Topics (newspaper)|Town Topics]]|accessdate=10 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her years in exile, it is claimed that Alliluyeva was never happy. Her children who were left behind in the Soviet Union did not maintain contact with her. While Western sources saw a [[KGB]] hand behind this,&lt;ref&gt;[[The Hawk and the Dove (book)|The Hawk and the Dove]]&lt;/ref&gt; her children claimed that this is because of her complex character.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1tv.ru/news/polit/35510 The only interview of her son] on [[Channel One Russia|Channel One]]&lt;/ref&gt; She flirted with various religions.&lt;ref Name="Telegraph"/&gt; While some claim she had money problems, others argue that her financial situation was good, because of her great popularity. For example, her first book, ''Twenty Letters to a Friend'', caused a worldwide sensation and brought her, some allege, about $2,500,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.mail.ru/society/7455922/  Svetlana Alliluyeva dies. [[Rossiya 24|Vesti]].ru]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mk.ru/politics/article/2012/11/20/776299-doch-stalina-byila-pod-kolpakom.html|title=Stalin's daughter lived under surveillance|accessdate=24 March 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FclcHx2W?url=http://www.mk.ru/politics/article/2012/11/20/776299-doch-stalina-byila-pod-kolpakom.html|archivedate=4 April 2013|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Alliluyeva answered an invitation from [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]'s widow, [[Olgivanna Lloyd Wright]], to visit Wright's winter studio, [[Taliesin West]], in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/03/31/my-friend-stalins-daughter&lt;/ref&gt; Alliluyeva described the experience in her autobiographical book, ''Far Away Music''. Olgivanna believed in [[mysticism]] and had become convinced that Alliluyeva was a spiritual replacement for her own daughter, also named Svetlana. Years previously, Olgivanna's daughter had married Wright's chief apprentice [[William Wesley Peters|William Wesley "Wes" Peters]] before she died in a car crash.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

Within a matter of months, Alliluyeva was engaged to Peters, and the two married. They had a daughter, Olga (b. 20 May 1971). Peters was a leading member of the [[Taliesin Associated Architects|Taliesin Fellowship]], a group of architects and designers who had been Wright's apprentices and acolytes and had remained dedicated to his work. Alliluyeva adopted the name '''Lana Peters''', became part of the Fellowship community, and migrated back and forth with them between Taliesin West and Wright's summer home and studio, [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]] (in [[Spring Green, Wisconsin]]).{{cn|date=December 2017}}

By her own account, Alliluyeva retained respect and affection for Peters, but their marriage dissolved because of the pressure of Mrs. Wright's influence, and Alliluyeva's inability to adjust to the cult-like lifestyle of the Taliesin Fellowship, which she compared to life in the Soviet Union under her father. In 1978, Alliluyeva became a US citizen,&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; and in 1982, she moved with her daughter to [[Cambridge|Cambridge, England]], where they shared an apartment near the [[Cambridge University Botanic Garden]].&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=My Friend, Stalin’s Daughter|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/03/31/my-friend-stalins-daughter|website=[[The New Yorker]]|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, Alliluyeva returned to the Soviet Union, where she and her daughter were granted citizenship.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

Alliluyeva lived for a time in [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgian SSR]]. In 1986, she went back to the United States after "feuding with relatives".{{cn|date=December 2017}} Then, in the 1990s, she again went to the United Kingdom, becoming a British citizen in 1992, settling in [[Bristol]], living there until 2009, when she went back to the United States to live there on a permanent visa, while retaining British citizenship.{{Citation needed|reason=Settling in Bristol and British citizenship... edit that introduced these details included a citation that did not actually mention them. Citation since removed, but these details remain in article.|date=October 2017}}

Alliluyeva, for the most part, lived the last two years of her life in southern [[Wisconsin]], either in [[Richland Center, Wisconsin|Richland Center]] or in [[Spring Green, Wisconsin|Spring Green]], the location of Wright's summer studio "[[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]]". She died on 22 November 2011 from complications arising from [[colon cancer]] in Richland Center,&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news|author=Douglas Martin|title=Lana Peters, Stalin's Daughter, Dies at 85|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/29/world/europe/stalins-daughter-dies-at-85.html?hp=&amp;pagewanted=all|quote=At her birth, on Feb. 28, 1926, she was named Svetlana Stalina, the only daughter and last surviving child of the brutal Soviet tyrant Joseph Stalin. ...

At the time of Alliluyeva's death, her youngest daughter, Olga, went by the name Chrese Evans and ran a fashion boutique in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Yekaterina, a geologist, was living in Siberia's [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] studying a volcano.  Her son Iosif, a cardiologist, had died in Russia in 2008.&lt;ref name="chrese"&gt;[http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2011/11/portland_granddaughter_of_jose.html Portland granddaughter of Josef Stalin remembers her mother as a talented writer and lecturer in her own right]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newyorker.com" /&gt;

==Religion==
Alliluyeva was baptised into the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] on 20 March 1963. During her years of exile, she flirted with various religions. She then turned to the [[Greek Orthodox]] church and is also reported to have thought of becoming a nun.&lt;ref Name="Telegraph"/&gt;

In 1967, Alliluyeva found herself spending time with Roman Catholics in [[Switzerland]] and encountered many denominations during her time in the US.  She received a letter from Father Garbolino, an Italian Catholic priest from [[Pennsylvania]], inviting her to make a pilgrimage to [[Our Lady of Fátima|Fátima]], in [[Portugal]], on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the [[Virgin of Fatima|famous apparitions]] there. In 1969, Garbolino, who was in [[New Jersey]], came to visit Alliluyeva at [[Princeton University|Princeton]]. In California, she lived with a Catholic couple, Michael and Rose Ginciracusa, for two years (1976–78). She read books by authors such as [[Raissa Maritain]]. In [[Cambridge, England]], in December 1982, on the feast of [[Saint Lucy's Day|Santa Lucia]], [[Advent]], Alliluyeva converted to the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hazteoir.org/noticia/42644-muerte-svetlana-hija-stalin-que-se-convirtio-catolicismo "Ante la muerte de Svetlana, la hija de Stalin que se convirtió al catolicismo", ''Hazteoir'' 05 December 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

While in the Soviet Union, Alliluyeva had written a memoir in Russian in 1963. The manuscript was carried safely out of the country by Ambassador T. N. Kaul, who returned it to her in New Delhi. Alliluyeva handed her memoir over to the CIA agent Robert Rayle at the time of her own defection. Rayle made a copy of it. The book was titled ''Twenty Letters to a Friend'' (Dvadtsat' pisem k drugu). It was the only thing other than a few items of clothing taken by Alliluyeva on a secret passenger flight out of India.&lt;ref name="RS2015"&gt;{{cite book |title=Stalin's Daughter: The Extraordinary and Tumultuous Life of Svetlana Alliluyeva |author=Rosemary Sullivan |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2015 |ISBN=1443414441 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=o5ydBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT11&amp;vq=Twenty%2BLetters&amp;pg=PT11#v=snippet&amp;q=Twenty+Letters&amp;f=false |pages=11, 16 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryamond Pearson, in ''Russia and Eastern Europe'', described Alliluyeva's book as a naïve attempt to shift the blame for [[Stalinism|Stalinist crimes]] onto [[Lavrentiy Beria]], and whitewash her own father.&lt;ref name="RP"&gt;{{cite book |title=Russia and Eastern Europe, 1789–1985: A Bibliographical Guide |author=Raymond Pearson |publisher=Manchester University Press |year=1989 |ISBN=0719017343 |page=124 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=-99RAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Alliluyeva#v=snippet&amp;q=Alliluyeva&amp;f=false |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth and demographic history==

The records of the LDS Church show membership growth every decade since [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|its beginning in the 1830s]].  Following initial growth rates that averaged 10% to 25% per year in the 1830s through 1850s, it grew at about 4% per year through the last four decades of the 19th century.  After a steady slowing of growth in the first four decades of the 20th century to a rate of about 2% per year in the 1930s (the [[Great Depression]] years), growth [[Post-World War II baby boom|boomed]] to an average of 6% per year for the decade around 1960, staying around 4% to 5% through 1990. After 1990, average annual growth again slowed steadily to a rate around 2.2% for the ten years ending 2015, approximately double the average [[world population]] growth rate of 1.1% for the same period.

==Synopsis==
It was printed in paperback by [[Gold Medal Books]], in 1950, and sold for 25 cents. In December, 1949, prior to the publishing of the book, Keyhoe published an article by the same name in [[True (magazine)|True magazine]], with similar material.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.books.google.com/books?id=lGyPpnFpg7UC The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects: The Original 1956 Edition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727101628/http://books.google.com/books?id=lGyPpnFpg7UC |date=2014-07-27 }}, [[Edward J. Ruppelt]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.books.google.com/books?id=2du2fVYT8ewC Hostile Aliens, Hollywood and Today's News: 1950s Science Fiction Films and 9/11] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727101632/http://books.google.com/books?id=2du2fVYT8ewC |date=2014-07-27 }}, Melvin E. Matthews&lt;/ref&gt; The book was a huge success and popularized many ideas in [[ufology]] that are still widely believed today.

''The Flying Saucers Are Real'' is short&amp;nbsp;— only 175 pages. It is referenced by footnotes, and cites a panoply of sources, including newspapers, magazines, Air Force records and press statements, and personal interviews. It is written in a dramatic, narrative style reminiscent of mystery novels and spy thrillers. (Keyhoe also wrote fiction in these genres.)

Keyhoe contended that the Air Force was investigating these cases of close encounters, with a policy of concealing their existence from the public until 1949. He stated that this policy was then replaced by one of cautious, progressive revelation.

Keyhoe further stated that Earth had been visited by extraterrestrials for two centuries, with the frequency of these visits increasing sharply after the first atomic weapon test in 1945.  Citing anecdotal evidence, he intimated the Air Force may have attained and adapted some aspect of the alien technology, its method of propulsion and perhaps its source of power.  He believed the Air Force or the United States federal government would eventually reveal these technologies to the public when the [[Soviet Union]] was no longer a threat.

==Reception==
"Keyhoe's book ''Flying Saucers Are Real'' ... was the first influential attempt to promote the idea of "flying saucers" as alien spacecraft."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Rothstein, Mikael|chapter=The Rise and Decline of the First-Generation UFO Contactees: A Cognitive Approach |editor=Lewis, James R.|date=2003|title=Encyclopedic Sourcebook of UFO Religions|publisher=[[Prometheus Books]]|location=Amherst, New York|pages=63–76, page 66|isbn=978-1-57392-964-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A loose parody of Keyhoe's book and of reports of UFO sightings and alien abductions is ''The Flying Saucers Are Very Very Real'' (2016).

"'''The Monkey Suit'''" is the twenty-first episode of the [[The Simpsons (season 17)|seventeenth season]] of the American animated sitcom ''[[The Simpsons]]''. It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on May 14, 2006. In the episode, [[Ned Flanders]] is shocked after seeing a new display at the museum about [[evolution]]. Together with [[Reverend Lovejoy]], he spreads the religious belief of [[creationism]] in [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]], and at a later town meeting, teaching evolution is made illegal. As a result, [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] decides to hold secret classes for people interested in evolution. However, she is quickly arrested and a trial against her is initiated.

[[J. Stewart Burns]] wrote "The Monkey Suit", for which he received inspiration from the 1925 [[Scopes Monkey Trial]]. The episode features a few references to this legal case, as well as several references to [[popular culture]]. Many analysts have commented on the episode's treatment of the [[creation–evolution controversy]], a dispute about the origin of humanity between those who support a creationist view based upon their [[religious beliefs]], versus those who accept evolution, as supported by [[scientific evidence]].

Critics have given the episode generally positive reviews, praising it for its satire of the creation–evolution debate. "The Monkey Suit" has won an award from the [[Independent Investigations Group]] (IIG) for being "one of those rare shows in the media that encourage science, critical thinking, and ridicule those shows that peddle [[pseudoscience]] and [[superstition]]."&lt;ref name="iig"/&gt; In 2007, a scene from the episode was highlighted in the scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.

==Plot==
On the last day of summer vacation, [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] brings the family to the museum to see a [[weaving]] exhibit as her summer activity, but they quickly discover that it has been canceled and replaced by a "History of Weapons" exhibit. Faced with an incredibly long line, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] notices [[Ned Flanders]] and his children at the front of the line and cuts in front of them. Others start taking advantage of Ned’s kindness as well, until the Flanders family is stuck at the end. At the end of the day, they are still waiting, and are denied entry, as it is closing time for the weapons exhibit. They therefore decide to check out the [[Human evolution|evolution]] exhibit next door. Ned is horrified to hear that humans evolved from apes and that the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation account]] in the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] is characterized as a myth. Covering his children's eyes, he drags them out of the exhibit.

Ned meets up with the church council to suggest promotion of [[creationism]]. The next day, he and [[Reverend Lovejoy]] blackmail [[Principal Skinner]] into introducing creationism in the school. Lisa is perturbed by this, and at a town meeting asks everyone to make a choice between creationism and [[Darwinism]], as there is only one truth. The townspeople vote for creationism, much to her chagrin, and the act of teaching or learning Darwinism and evolution is made illegal. Lisa therefore decides to start holding secret classes for people interested in evolution. However, just as the first lesson is about to begin, she is arrested by [[Chief Wiggum]]. She asks why she's being arrested when there are far worse crimes out there, and embarrassed he tells her they only have enough manpower to enforce the last three laws passed, even stating that it's the worst law system there is. Lisa is brought to trial, which is dubbed ''Lisa Simpson v. God''. Representing her is Clarice Drummond, a despised [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) lawyer, while on God’s (i.e., Ned's) side is Wallace Brady, a beloved, overweight, [[American South|southern]] lawyer. The trial does not go smoothly for Lisa, as [[Professor Frink]] (called by Clarice) gives ambiguous answers regarding God's existence, while a creationist scientist says that evolution cannot be real, as there is no proof of a "[[Transitional fossil|missing link]]" (depicted in a picture as a savage hominid, holding a rock over his head).

With Lisa now facing a long jail sentence, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] decides to help her out. She starts reading [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' and becomes addicted to it. When the trial resumes, Marge tells Lisa that she now knows a way that she can help her. While Ned is being cross-examined by Clarice, Marge gives Homer a cold beer. Homer, ecstatic at getting a beer, tries to open it unsuccessfully. The more he tries, the more primitive he gets, hooting and banging the bottle on the bench, disrupting the trial. Finally, Ned loses his cool and refers to Homer as a "big monkey-faced gorilla." Clarice then asks Ned to compare the picture of the "missing link" and Homer shaking the beer over his head, and asks if he truthfully believes Homer cannot be related to apes. Ned cannot and concedes victory to Lisa. After the trial, Lisa goes up to Ned and kindly tells him that while she fully respects his and other peoples religious beliefs, she just doesn't think it's proper for the church to dominate the school in the same way that him and Reverend Lovejoy don't want scientists taking over the church. Ned finds himself agreeing with this and offers to take Lisa and his sons out for ice cream.

==Production==
[[File:John t scopes.jpg|thumb|A legal case involving high school science teacher [[John Scopes]] served as inspiration for the episode.]]
"The Monkey Suit" was written by [[J. Stewart Burns]] and directed by [[Raymond S. Persi]] as part of the seventeenth season of ''The Simpsons'' (2005–2006).&lt;ref name=Sanders/&gt; Burns received inspiration for the episode from the [[Scopes Monkey Trial]], a 1925 legal case in which high school science teacher [[John Scopes]] was accused of violating [[Tennessee]]'s [[Butler Act]] which made teaching evolution unlawful.&lt;ref name="iig"/&gt; Clarice Drummond, the ACLU lawyer who represents Lisa, is a reference to the ACLU lawyer [[Clarence Darrow]] who defended Scopes, while Wallace Brady is a reference to [[William Jennings Bryan]], an attorney in the Scopes Monkey Trial.&lt;ref name=Gournelos/&gt; American actor [[Larry Hagman]] guest starred in the episode as Wallace Brady,&lt;ref name=radiotimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=John Yoshito|title=Intelligent Design and educational policy: The case of Kansas|year=2007|publisher=[[ProQuest Dissertations and Theses]]|isbn=978-0-549-27202-1|page=185|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdlink?did=1467887931&amp;Fmt=7&amp;clientI%20d=79356&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD}}&lt;/ref&gt; while American actress [[Melanie Griffith]] played herself as the narrator of an audio tour at the museum.&lt;ref name=radiotimes&gt;{{cite web|title=Series 17 - 21. The Monkey Suit|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/episode/dtjc/the-simpsons-the-monkey-suit|publisher=''[[Radio Times]]''|accessdate=2011-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burns did research for "The Monkey Suit" by reading [[Richard Dawkins]]' book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' and watching ''[[Inherit the Wind (1960 film)|Inherit the Wind]]'' (a film based on the Scopes Monkey Trial). He also visited a natural history museum.&lt;ref name="iig"/&gt;

The opening of the episode, in which Bart rushes to do everything he planned on doing during summer vacation, was originally written and animated for the [[The Simpsons (season 14)|season fourteen]] episode "[[I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can]]" (2003) but was cut. This episode came in short, and to fill in time, the sequence was added.&lt;ref name="Jean"&gt;{{cite video | people=Jean, Al |date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Ninth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Lisa's Sax"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burns has said commented the episode "ended up being incredibly short because when you do an episode where there's really just one good side of an argument &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[creation–evolution controversy|creation vs. evolution]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, you don't fill out as much time as you need to."&lt;ref name="iig"/&gt; The opening sequence features a large number of allusions to popular culture, including references to ''[[The Natural (film)|The Natural]]'' (1984 film), ''[[Happy Days]]'' (television sitcom), and ''[[Men in Black (1997 film)|Men in Black]]'' (1997 film).&lt;ref name=Gournelos/&gt;

==Themes==
"The Monkey Suit" is an episode that tackles the [[creation–evolution controversy]],&lt;ref name="classroom"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Waltonen, Karma |author2=Vernay, Denise Du |title=The Simpsons in the Classroom: Embiggening the Learning Experience with the Wisdom of Springfield|year=2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-4490-8|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to Theresa Sanders in her book ''Approaching Eden: Adam and Eve in Popular Culture'', "skewered [[antievolution]] legislation."&lt;ref name=Sanders/&gt; The authors of the book ''Chronology of the Evolution-Creationism Controversy'' commented that the episode "caricatures creationism as an intellectual joke."&lt;ref name=Chronology&gt;{{cite book|author1=Moore, Randy |author2=Decker, Mark |author3=Cotner, Sehoya |title=Chronology of the Evolution-Creationism Controversy|year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-36287-3|pages=351|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4KwJRNgscdEC&amp;pg=PA351&amp;dq=%22monkey+suit%22+simpsons#v=onepage&amp;q=%22monkey%20suit%22%20simpsons&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burns has cited the episode as "a nice example of ''The Simpsons'' really taking one clear side".&lt;ref name="iig"/&gt; However, as pointed out by Sanders, it "should be pointed out that though the ''Simpsons'' episode clearly sides with Darwin, evolutionists come in for criticism as well. When Ned and his sons go into the museum's Hall of Man, one of the exhibits they see in support of evolution is a collection of dinosaur bones with the title 'Indisputable Fossil Records.' The cartoon's inclusion of the sign can be interpreted as mocking the pretension that science knows all and may not be questioned."&lt;ref name=Sanders&gt;{{cite book|last=Sanders|first=Theresa|title=Approaching Eden: Adam and Eve in Popular Culture|year=2009|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-6333-9|pages=141–144, 230|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lcQAHY9gJxsC&amp;pg=PA141&amp;dq=%22Monkey+Suit%22+simpsons#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Monkey%20Suit%22%20simpsons&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanders cited another scene as an example of this; at the trial, Drummond asks Professor Frink if "this theory of evolution necessarily mean that there is no God?", to which he replies, "No, of course not. It just says that God is an impotent nothing from nowhere with less power than the undersecretary of Agriculture." Sanders wrote that "His arrogance is clear, and equally clear is the show's satirical presentation of science's [[hubris]]."&lt;ref name=Sanders/&gt;

Ted Gournelos analyzed "The Monkey Suit" in his 2009 book ''Popular Culture and the Future of Politics: Cultural Studies and the Tao of South Park'', writing: "More than anything, the episode is used to critique the demonization of evolutionary theory by religious propaganda, by an instructional video used in the school (that shows a drunken Charles Darwin passionately kissing Satan) as well as by the prosecuting attorney. This allows for a somewhat leftist discussion of the issue, but ultimately is unable to address the rise of Christian fundamentalism in the United States [...]".&lt;ref name=Gournelos/&gt; Gournelos noted that the episode focuses on the old Scopes Monkey Trial and does not address contemporary creation–evolution debates, adding: "Interestingly, ''The Simpsons'' continues to place creationism at a higher popular plain than evolution, as the jury and trial audience are obviously biased towards the creationists (who, unlike in contemporary cases, are the prosecutors rather than the plaintiffs)."&lt;ref name=Gournelos&gt;{{cite book|last=Gournelos|first=Ted|title=Popular Culture and the Future of Politics: Cultural Studies and the Tao of South Park|year=2009|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7391-3721-5|pages=89–91|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PCI23BOylt4C&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=%22monkey+suit%22+simpsons#v=onepage&amp;q=%22monkey%20suit%22%20simpsons&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gournelos concluded that the episode "pokes gentle fun at media rhetoric and the questioning of evolutionary theory [...], but is unable or unwilling to address the rise of [[intelligent design]] or contemporary court battles (in Pennsylvania [see ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]''], Kansas [see [[Kansas evolution hearings]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, and elsewhere) that might encourage debate in its audience."&lt;ref name=Gournelos/&gt;

==Release==
The episode originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on May 14, 2006.&lt;ref name=IGN&gt;{{cite web|title=The Monkey Suit|url=http://tv.ign.com/objects/827/827977.html|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2011-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this broadcast, it was seen by approximately 8.41 millions viewers, finishing forty-sixth in the ratings for the week of May 8–14, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=By the numbers - Nielsen TV ratings|newspaper=[[The Dallas Morning News]]|date=2006-05-17|page=3G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since airing, the episode has received generally positive reviews from critics. In a retrospective that was published on the twentieth anniversary of ''The Simpsons'' in 2010, writers for [[BBC News]] selected "The Monkey Suit" as one of the show's "10 classic episodes", one they said demonstrated that "the writers still have fire in their bellies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8449416.stm|title=The Simpsons: 10 classic episodes |date=2010-01-14|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2010-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[TV Squad]] critic Adam Finley wrote that "Last night's episode had some good moments, but it did feel like they were treading upon somewhat familiar ground and not saying anything especially new," referring to the fact the issue of science and religion has been dealt with before on the show, "most notably in the '[[Lisa the Skeptic]]' episode in which the supposed skeleton of a dead angel is found."&lt;ref name=Finley&gt;{{cite web|last=Finley|first=Adam|title=The Simpsons: The Monkey Suit|url=http://www.aoltv.com/2006/05/15/the-simpsons-the-monkey-suit/|publisher=[[TV Squad]]|accessdate=2011-11-05|date=2006-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, "The Monkey Suit" won an award from the [[Independent Investigations Group]] (IIG) for being "one of those rare shows in the media that encourage science, critical thinking, and ridicule those shows that peddle [[pseudoscience]] and [[superstition]]."&lt;ref name="iig"/&gt; J.

While reviewing the seventeenth season of ''The Simpsons'', Jesse Hassenger of [[PopMatters]] noted that he thought the show had declined in quality compared to its earlier years, and added that the stronger episodes in the later seasons are that ones that "satirize topical issues", giving "The Monkey Suit" as an example.&lt;ref name=Hassenger&gt;{{cite web|last=Hassenger|first=Jesse|title=The Simpsons - Managing Bright Spots|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/simpsons-060531|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|accessdate=2011-11-05|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, ''[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]'' staff writer Robert Philpot commented that "Even in its weak seasons, this show has always been good for at least one belly laugh per episode. Not this year [season seventeen]. Aside from an installment that took on the evolution -vs.-creationism edge and a couple of other bits, the satirical edge has really dulled, making the announcement that it will have at least two more seasons a cause for concern rather than celebration."&lt;ref name=Philpot&gt;{{cite news|last=Philpot|first=Robert|title=Time to rewind - The credits have rolled on this season's last series finale.
