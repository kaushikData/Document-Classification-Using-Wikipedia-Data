==Products==

As of 2016, BioMarin has six products on the market, each of which is an [[orphan drug]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmrn.com/products/index.php BioMarin Office Site: Products]&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Tetrahydrobiopterin]] (branded as Kuvan) (sapropterin dihydrochloride), a [[small molecule]] drug for [[phenylketonuria]], introduced in 2007 as the first medication-based intervention to treat [[phenylketonuria]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/14/health/14genetic.html?adxnnl=1&amp;ref=us&amp;adxnnlx=1207246157-x4BfrBsi1FBh9a8XYN40ig | title = Agency Approves Drug to Treat Genetic Disorder That Can Lead to Retardation  | last = Pollack | first = A | date = 2007-12-14 | accessdate = 2008-04-03 | publisher = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Arylsulfatase B]] (branded as Naglazyme) (galsulfase), a [[recombinant protein]] therapeutic for [[Maroteaux–Lamy syndrome]] (also called mucopolysaccharidosis type VI)
*[[Iduronidase]] (branded as Aldurazyme), a recombinant protein therapeutic for [[mucopolysaccharidosis]] I
*[[Amifampridine]] (branded as Firdapse), a small molecule drug for [[Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome]] (as of 2013 approved in the EU only)
*[[Elosulfase alfa]] (branded as Vimizim), is the only enzyme replacement therapy to address the cause of Morquio A Syndrome (MPS IVA), which affects an estimated 3,000 patients in the developed world. The disease occurs as a result of a deficiency of activity in an enzyme involved in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) metabolism.
*[[Cerliponase alfa]] (branded as Brineura), is an enzyme replacement treatment for [[Batten disease]], which is a form of [[neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis]]. It was approved in 2017.

Biomarin is working to develop several new drugs.

*'''Valoctocogene Roxaparvovec''' is an [[experimental drug]] under investigation for treatment of [[Haemophilia A|hemophilia A]]. It is an [[Adeno-associated virus|adeno-associated viral vector]] that aims to transfer a working copy of the [[Factor VIII]] gene into patients who lack one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tirrell|first=Meg|date=7 August 2018|title=Spark Therapeutics shares lose a third of their value as hemophilia gene therapy trial disappoints investors|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/07/spark-therapeutics-gene-therapy-reduces-bleeding-in-hemophilia-a-trial.html|work=[[CNBC]]|location= |access-date=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

In 2010, BioMarin became involved in controversy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-11798183 | title = Drug firms accused of exploiting loophole for profit  | last = Goldberg | first = Adrian | date = 2010-11-21 | accessdate = 2010-11-21 | publisher = [[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1315441/Hospitals-forced-use-unlicensed-medicines-save-millions.html | title = Hospitals are forced to use unlicensed medicines to save millions | date = 2010-09-27 | accessdate = 2010-11-21 | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Daniel | last=Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; surrounding [[3,4-diaminopyridine]] (3,4-DAP). BioMarin markets a phosphate salt of 3,4-DAP under the name [[Firdapse]]. In 2010, BioMarin was granted exclusive licensing rights to Firdapse for 10 years. As a result, the price of a prescribed [[National Health Service]] treatment course has increased from $1,987 for the unlicensed drug to $69,970 for Firdapse. The company states that prior to its licensing, there was no guaranteed quality control of the product and no way of formally monitoring for uncommon side effects through the regulatory process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c6459 | title = What makes an orphan drug? | date = 2010-11-10 | accessdate = 2010-11-21 | publisher = British Medical Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, BioMarin  Pharmaceuticals was at the center of a high profile debate regarding [[expanded access]] of cancer patients to experimental drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Andrea Sloan Faces Pharma Firm With History Of Indifference | date = 2013-09-26 | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/26/andrea-sloan-biomarin_n_3997527.html | work = Huffington Post | accessdate = 2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the advice of her doctor, Andrea Sloan, a patient with advanced ovarian cancer, requested that the company  provide her with access to BMN 673, an unapproved [[PARP inhibitor]] drug candidate that had exhibited promising activity in a small [[Phase 1 clinical trial]].  The company declined, citing safety concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = In cancer drug battle, both sides appeal to ethics | date = 2013-09-20 | url = http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/28/health/compassionate-drug-use/ | work = CNN | accessdate = 2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ms. Sloan eventually received a similar drug candidate from a different company.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Silverman for Pharmalot.

In 2015, there was another controversy over [[expanded access]], concerning the supply of a drug on clinical trial to a German child who was suffering from a brain disorder but who was not part of the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Hannahs Kampf gegen Pharmafirma | date = 2015-05-13 | url = http://www.br.de/nachrichten/ncl2-kinderdemenz-hannah-vogel100.html | work = B5 aktuell | accessdate = 2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Constant Elasticity of Transformation''' (CET) was first advanced by Alan Powell and [[Fred Gruen]] in a 1968 publication.&lt;ref name="Powell"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Powell|first=Alan A.|author2=Gruen, F.H.G.|date=October 1968|title=The Constant Elasticity of Transformation Production Frontier and Linear Supply System|journal=International Economic Review|publisher=Wiley|volume=9|issue=3|pages=315–328|jstor=2556228|doi=10.2307/2556228}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a new form of [[production-possibility frontier]].
Following on that early work, [[George Philippidis]] made a detailed introduction of the CET function in 1999. The CET is the corollary [[Constant elasticity of substitution|CES]] function, where the production possibilities of the firm (industry) are a function of different combination of supply activities.

The '''cost of operation''' is the [[business strategy]] implemented in many companies to gain a huge market. Cost of operation is the cost acquired in completing one operation. It may be a conversion of [[Factors of production|inputs]] into the [[Output (economics)|outputs]] or [[labor costs]] etc. If the cost of operation is low then it is easy to maintain [[cost leadership]] and gain the [[Market (economics)|market]] with [[competitive advantage]].

'''Craig Leonard Heatley''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|CNZM}} (born 29 May 1956)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Alister Taylor| title=New Zealand Who's Who Aotearoa 2001 Edition| publisher=Alister Taylor Publishers | date=2001 | ISSN=1172-9813 | page= 432}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a New Zealand businessman, entrepreneur and philanthropist. He is one of the wealthiest men in New Zealand according to the New Zealand National Business Review.

==Career==
Heatley set up [[Rainbow Corporation]] in the 1980s which had interests in Woolworths supermarkets, entertainment theme parks and property. Rainbow was acquired by [[Brierley Investments]] in the late 80's to gain control of Rainbows significant stake in Woolworths. Rainbow shareholders agreed to a stock swap deal worth $500 million, of which Heatley controlled 20%. Heatley was appointed to the Brierley board.

He then went on to set up [[Sky Network Television]], Famously with a personal investment of only $1, he managed to turn it into New Zealand's only pay TV provider and one of the 10 largest New Zealand companies, whilst still retaining a 15% stake.

Heatley has since sold his stake in Sky Network Television, and now has diversified interests throughout New Zealand, Asia and the U.S. which include property, infrastructure, equities and aviation. He is also a major player in the New Zealand [[private equity]] and [[currency]] markets.&lt;ref name=richlist&gt;http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/the-rich-list-700m-200m-105943#craig-heatley&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2013 Birthday Honours (New Zealand)|2013 Queen's Birthday Honours]], Heatley was appointed a [[New Zealand Order of Merit|Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit]], for services to business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dpmc.govt.nz/publications/queens-birthday-honours-list-2013 |title=Queen's Birthday honours list 2013 |date=3 June 2013 |publisher=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet |accessdate=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other==

'''David Davis''' "'''D. D.'''" '''Walker''' (January 19, 1840 – October 4, 1918) was an American businessman. He started his career as a dry goods wholesaler in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. He was the co-founder of Ely &amp; Walker, which remains a clothing brand to this day.

==Early life==
David Davis Walker was born on January 19, 1840 on a farm near [[Bloomington, Illinois]] to George E. Walker (1797–1864) and Harriet Mercer (1802–1869). His paternal grandfather, [[Thomas Walker (slave trader)|Thomas Walker]], was an English slavetrader.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|title=George W. Bush's Great-Great-Great-Great-Grandfather Was a Slave Trader|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/history_lesson/2013/06/george_w_bush_and_slavery_the_president_and_his_father_are_descendants_of.single.html|date=2013-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Walker was a first cousin of [[United States Senator|Senator]] and [[Supreme Court Justice]] [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|David Davis]].

At age fourteen, he was sent to the Beloit Preparatory Academy, part of [[Beloit College]] in [[Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beloit.edu/~belmag/spring01/html/news.html|title=President Bush's Roots Extend to Beloit|publisher=Beloit College Magazine|date=Spring 2001|accessdate=2006-11-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060915185833/http://www.beloit.edu/~belmag/spring01/html/news.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
In 1857, Walker went to [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] for business training with the merchandiser Crow, McCreery &amp; Co., then the largest wholesale dry goods house in the city. He worked his way up from office boy, and became a partner after just eight years with the firm. He became ill as a result of his [[workaholic]] habits, quitting in 1878, and spent the next two years recovering.

In 1880, he went back to work, forming Ely, Walker &amp; Co. with Frank Ely and others. The business was a huge success, and in 1883 it was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] as the Ely &amp; Walker Dry Goods Company. He remained President of the company until 1892, and thereafter retained the largest interest in the firm. His sons David Davis, Jr., Joseph Sidney and [[George Herbert Walker|George Herbert]] all had involvement with the Ely &amp; Walker firm, which continued as a major clothing manufacturer until it was acquired by [[Burlington Industries]] after [[World War II]], but George went into banking.

==Personal life==
Walker married Martha Adela Beaky. They had a son, [[George Herbert Walker]].

==Death and legacy==
Walker died in 1918 at Walker's Point, his son George's seaside property in [[Kennebunkport, Maine|Kennebunkport]], [[Maine]], the modern-day [[Bush compound]] now occupied by former President George H.W. Bush. His great-grandson, [[George H. W. Bush]], and his great-great-grandson, [[George W. Bush]], both served as [[President of the United States]].

'''Downtown Brooklyn''' is the third largest [[central business district]] in [[New York City]], [[United States]] (following [[Midtown Manhattan]] and [[Lower Manhattan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ny-offices.com/nycity/new-york-city%E2%80%99s-cbds/|title=New York City’s CBDs (Central Business Districts) –         The Office that Never Sleeps|work=ny-offices.com|accessdate=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and is located in the northwestern section of the [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Brooklyn]]. The neighborhood is known for its office and residential buildings, such as the [[Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower]] and the [[MetroTech Center]] office complex. 

Since the rezoning of Downtown Brooklyn in 2004, the area has been undergoing a transformation, with $9 billion of private investment and $300 million in public improvements underway. The area is a growing hub for education. In 2017, [[New York University]] announced that it would invest over $500 million to renovate and expand the [[New York University Tandon School of Engineering|NYU Tandon School of Engineering]] and its surrounding Downtown Brooklyn-based campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://engineering.nyu.edu/in-media/2017/02/02/nyu-invests-500-million-renovations-brooklyn-campus|title=NYU Invests $500 Million in Renovations for Brooklyn Campus|work=NYU Tandon School of Engineering|access-date=2017-11-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early development===
[[File:Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower by DS.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The [[Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower]], a prominent symbol of Downtown Brooklyn]]

This area was originally inhabited by [[Lenape]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], until the 17th century. Area close to the [[Wallabout Bay]] was called Rinnegokonk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Canarsee Indians: The Original Inhabitants|last = Jaffe|first = Herman J.|publisher = The Fourth Largest City In America, Brooklyn College Press|year = 1979|isbn = |location = Brooklyn|pages = 46–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time the Dutch arrived, gained control of the land, and called it Breuckelen. The waterfront area being sold by Indians to [[Joris Jansen Rapelje]], who used the land for farm purposes. Until 1814, Downtown Brooklyn and [[Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn|Brooklyn Heights]] remained sparsely populated.  [[Robert Fulton]]’s new steam ferry then began to offer an easy [[commuting]] option to and from downtown Manhattan. It made Brooklyn Heights Manhattan’s first [[suburb]], and put Downtown Brooklyn on its way to becoming a commercial center, and the heart of the [[History of Brooklyn|City of Brooklyn]].

The city was home to many prominent [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]]s at a time when most of New York was indifferent to slavery. Many Brooklyn churches agitated against legalized slavery in the 1850s and 1860s and some acted as safehouses as part of the [[Underground Railroad]] movement. [[Walt Whitman]] was fired from his job as a reporter at the Brooklyn Eagle due to his support for the [[Wilmot Proviso]] when he lived at Willoughby and [[Myrtle Avenue]]s. A group of buildings at 223, 225, 227, 231, 233, and 235 Duffield Street, in addition to the African Wesleyan Methodist Episcopal Church located in MetroTech Center, were believed to be among the safehouses.&lt;ref name=fny/&gt;

The middle 19th century growth of the Port of New York caused shipping to spill over into the City of Brooklyn; many buildings now used for other purposes were built as warehouses and factories.  Manufacturing intensified with the building of the [[Brooklyn Bridge|Brooklyn]] and [[Manhattan Bridge]]s; buildings from that time include the 1915 [[Sperry Gyroscope Company]] building, now known as the Howard Building of [[CUNY]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Syndicate Takes Title to Hoffman and Albemarle Hotels for $1,700,000 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1915/06/13/archives/latest-dealings-in-the-realty-field-syndicate-takes-title-to.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 13, 1915 |page=XX8 |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; New, extensive infrastructure served the [[Brooklyn Bridge trolleys]].

===20th century===
[[File:AdamsStreetRU.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Adams Street/Brooklyn Bridge Boulevard, a major corridor through Downtown Brooklyn]]
[[File:Downtown Brooklyn streetscape April 2016 5.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Tillary Street, another major corridor]]
Following [[World War II]], the [[New York City Department of City Planning|City Planning Commission]], in conjunction with the Borough President’s Office, presented and adopted a Master Plan for the Civic Center, which included an ambitious public improvements program. The program included plans for new buildings for City and State agencies, significant street widening and major housing construction in adjacent areas. A study conducted eight years later highlighted the progress made, emphasizing the widening of Adams Street (and later Boerum Place), which created a long and sweeping approach to Downtown Brooklyn from a modernized Brooklyn Bridge.

By the late 1960s, the patterns of transition that affected much of urban America initiated concern to protect the borough’s Central Business District from deterioration. In 1969, a comprehensive plan for the entire city was completed and in the report the City Planning Commission stated, “[Downtown Brooklyn’s] economy is vital to the borough and important to the entire metropolitan region.”{{citation needed |date=July 2018}} In re-affirming Downtown Brooklyn’s central role and identifying its problems, the Plan was optimistic that a combination of public and private efforts would stimulate office and commercial construction. A 23-story privately financed office tower at Boerum Place and Livingston Street opened in 1971 and the anticipated growth of the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] (BAM) succeeded far beyond expectations, giving this cultural institution an important role as a symbolic anchor amid increasing decay during the following decade.

After suffering with the rest of New York through the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970s, Borough President [[Howard Golden]], first elected in 1977, moved forward with a more aggressive economic development program to revitalize Downtown Brooklyn. He identified the need for greater equity in resource allocation between Manhattan and the city’s other boroughs. An important moment in the history of Downtown Brooklyn came in 1983 with the release of a Regional Plan Association report for the area. According to the document, Downtown Brooklyn could become the city’s third-largest business district because of its proximity to Lower Manhattan (closer by subway than Midtown). It also could serve as a prime location for high technology industries and new market-rate housing.  The [[State Street Houses]] Historic District was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1980.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|version=2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rezoning===
Historically, Downtown Brooklyn was primarily a commercial and civic center, with relatively little residential development. Housing included a few apartment buildings on Livingston Street, and seven 15-story buildings that make up the over 1,000 unit Concord Village co-op development on Adams Street, at the borders of both [[Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn|Brooklyn Heights]] and [[Dumbo, Brooklyn|Dumbo]].[[File:LawrenceStreet.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Lawrence Street in Downtown Brooklyn]] Since the rezoning of parts of Downtown Brooklyn in 2004 to allow for denser residential development, the area has seen the arrival of new condominium towers, townhouses, and office conversions. In all, 14,000 residential units were planned for Downtown Brooklyn at that time.{{citation needed |date=July 2018}} A New York Sun article from November 7, 2007, reports on the arrival of Downtown Brooklyn as a 24/7 community, estimating that 35,000 residents will come to the area in the next five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stoler|first=Michael|title=Downtown Brooklyn Finally Arrives|newspaper=The New York Sun|date=November 8, 2007|url=http://www.nysun.com/real-estate/downtown-brooklyn-finally-arrives/66134/|accessdate=August 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2008, residents started moving into the new residential buildings, according to a New York Sun article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hope|first=Bradley|title=First Residents Arrive for Downtown Brooklyn 'Renaissance'|newspaper=The New York Sun|date=January 24, 2008|url= http://www.nysun.com/real-estate/first-residents-arrive-for-downtown-brooklyn/70102/|accessdate=August 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[New York City Department of City Planning]] approved another, significant rezoning for portions of Downtown Brooklyn, including the [[Fulton Mall]] area, which resulted in significant expansion of office space and ground-floor retail, such as those at [[City Point (Brooklyn)|City Point]].&lt;ref name="fny"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forgotten-ny.com/2012/03/downtown-brooklyn/ |title=Downtown Brooklyn |work=[[Forgotten New York]] |author=Kevin Walsh |accessdate=August 16, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rezoning consists of "zoning map and zoning text changes, new public open spaces, pedestrian and transit improvements, urban renewal, [and] street mappings".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/dwnbklyn2/dwnbklynintro1.shtml Downtown Brooklyn], [[New York City Department of City Planning]]. Accessed October 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  The City Planning initiative also seeks to improve the connections between Downtown and the adjacent neighborhoods of [[Cobble Hill, Brooklyn|Cobble Hill]], [[Boerum Hill]], and [[Fort Greene, Brooklyn|Fort Greene]].

{{As of|2012|03}}, the rezoning of Downtown Brooklyn had caused gentrification in nearby neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="fny" /&gt; Affordable housing was created in the area after the 2004 rezoning, with 420 affordable units in 2014. The housing increase has also resulted in positive effects on other aspects of Downtown Brooklyn's economy as well, with revenues for the area's hospitality industry having tripled since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Anuta | first=Joe | title=Downtown B'klyn seen as 'shining example' | website=Crain's New York Business | date=July 15, 2014  | url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20140715/REAL_ESTATE/140719927/downtown-bklyn-seen-as-shining-example | accessdate=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of this gentrification was controversial, however. In 2007, the city government was to acquire the houses at 223–235 Duffield Street via [[eminent domain]], then demolish the houses and replace them with 500 new hotel rooms, 1,000 units of [[mixed-income housing]], more than 500,000 square feet of retail space, and at least 125,000 square feet of new office space in the area; however, only 231 Duffield Street was replaced by a hotel.&lt;ref name="fny" /&gt; Still, this caused historians to protest over the planned demolition of the historic houses because of their importance to abolitionists during the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Probasco | first=Mat | title=Historians in push to ‘save’ Duffield Street | website=The Brooklyn Paper | date=June 23, 2007  | url=http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/30/25/30_25duffield.html | accessdate=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Downtown Brooklyn is the civic and commercial [[downtown]] center of the former [[History of Brooklyn|City of Brooklyn]], which, as of 2010, has 2.6 million residents. The area includes [[Brooklyn Borough Hall]], the [[Kings County, New York|Kings County]] New York State courthouse, and the [[Theodore Roosevelt Federal Courthouse|Theodore Roosevelt Courthouse]] for the federal [[Eastern District of New York]]. Schools include [[Brooklyn Friends School]], [[St. Francis College]], [[Saint Joseph's College, New York|St. Joseph's College]], [[Brooklyn Law School]], [[New York University Tandon School of Engineering|NYU Tandon School of Engineering]], [[Center for Urban Science and Progress]], [[New York City College of Technology]], and [[Long Island University]]. Attractions within the area include the [[Fulton Mall]], [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]], [[New York Transit Museum]] and [[Barclays Center]].

Three days a week the Borough Hall [[Greenmarket]], featuring fresh produce from local farmers, operates on the plaza fronting Borough Hall. Formerly called Supreme Court Plaza, the location was renamed as Columbus Park in 1986.

[[File:Jay Street – MetroTech station entrance via AVA DoBro Building.jpg|thumb|right|Jay Street–MetroTech station entrance in the AVA DoBro Building]]

Downtown Brooklyn is connected with [[Manhattan]] by the [[Brooklyn Bridge|Brooklyn]] and [[Manhattan Bridge|Manhattan]] Bridges.

The neighborhood has extensive public transportation accessibility; it is served by the [[New York City Subway]] and many bus lines. All but one [[New York City Subway nomenclature#Current status|Manhattan trunk line]] in [[Lower Manhattan]] has a direct connection to Downtown Brooklyn. From south to north, the [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]] ({{NYCS trains|Lexington Brooklyn}}) via the [[Joralemon Street Tunnel]], the [[BMT Broadway Line|BMT Broadway]] and [[BMT Nassau Street Line]]s ({{NYCS trains|Montague}}) via the [[Montague Street Tunnel]], the [[IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line]] ({{NYCS trains|Broadway-Seventh Brooklyn}}) via the [[Clark Street Tunnel]] and the [[IND Eighth Avenue Line]] ({{NYCS trains|Cranberry}}) via the [[Cranberry Street Tunnel]]  provide that service. Slightly farther north, the [[Manhattan Bridge]] ({{NYCS trains|Manhattan Bridge}}) and [[Rutgers Street Tunnel]] ({{NYCS trains|Sixth Rutgers}}) also feed subway trains from the [[Lower East Side]] into Downtown Brooklyn.

Major stations in the neighborhood are:

* [[Jay Street–MetroTech (New York City Subway)|Jay Street–MetroTech]] ({{NYCS trains|MetroTech}})
* [[Court Street–Borough Hall (New York City Subway)|Court Street–Borough Hall]] ({{NYCS trains|Court-Borough}})

'''Ellen Biddle Shipman''' (November 5, 1869 – March 27, 1950) was an [[United States|American]] [[landscape architect]] known for her formal gardens and lush planting style. Along with [[Beatrix Farrand]] and [[Marian Cruger Coffin]], she dictated the style of the time and strongly influenced landscape design as a member of the first generation to break into the largely male occupation.&lt;ref name=ERothstein&gt;{{cite web |author=Edward Rothstein|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/16/nyregion/groundbreakers-pays-tribute-to-female-landscape-designers.html?_r=0 |title=Grandes Dames of the Gardens |date=15 May 2014|accessdate=2 February 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commenting about the male dominated field to the ''New York Times'' in 1938, she said "before women took hold of the profession, landscape architects were doing what I call cemetery work."&lt;ref name=CGray&gt;{{cite web |author=Christopher Gray|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/30/realestate/30scape.html |title=House of Sweetness and Spite |date=27 August 2009|accessdate=2 February 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shipman preferred to look on her career of using plantings as if she "were painting pictures as an artist." Little of her work remains today because of the labor-intensive style of her designs, but there exist preserved spaces, including the  [[Sarah P. Duke Gardens]] at [[Duke University]], often cited as one of the most beautiful American college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2016-01-29/the-20-most-beautiful-college-campuses-in-america/5 "The 20 most beautiful campuses in America"], ''[[Conde Nast]] Traveller'', January 29, 2016. #5 of 20: Duke University; picture and caption.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.travelandleisure.com/slideshows/americas-most-beautiful-college-campuses/19|title=Duke University: Durham N.C.|last=Tep|first=Ratha|date=|website=Travel + Leisure|publisher=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is buried in [[Plainfield, New Hampshire]], near Brook Place, her estate there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=shipman&amp;GSiman=1&amp;GScid=102872&amp;GRid=28844221&amp; "Ellen McGowan 'Nellie' Biddle Shipman"], ''findagrave.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Shipman was born in [[Philadelphia]], and she spent her childhood in [[Texas]] and the [[Arizona territory]]. Her father, Colonel James Biddle, was a career [[United States Army|Army]] officer, stationed on the western frontier. When the safety of his family was threatened, he moved them to the McGowan farm in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]]. Shipman attended boarding school in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], where her interests in the arts emerged and by her twenties she had already started drawing garden designs.&lt;ref name=ARaver&gt;{{cite web |author=Anne Raver|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/07/arts/private-places-for-flowers-and-dreams.html
 |title=Private Places for Flowers and Dreams|date=7 February 1997|accessdate=29 October 2006|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When she entered the Harvard annex, [[Radcliffe College]], Shipman met a playwright attending Harvard named Louis Shipman. They left school after one year, married, and moved to [[Plainfield, New Hampshire]], in the [[Cornish Art Colony]], which included [[Maxfield Parrish]] and [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]]. The colony is said to have been landscaped by artists who were not architects, but had artistically trained eyes and an awareness for the aesthetics of repose, which gave rise to a collection of some of the finest gardens in the country.  Shipman took strongly to the Cornish style, one that focused on geometric patterns and colonial plantings, and with it created her own style – a style which did not go unnoticed.

==Collaboration==
[[File:Winter Afternoon, Willard Metcalf, 1917.jpg|thumb|left|[[Willard Metcalf]], a fellow member of the [[Cornish Art Colony]] in Plainfield, painted this while staying with the Shipmans at Brook Place. Ellen and her husband renovated the house in an Italianate Style. Painted here is the original part of the house. ]]

Shipman's colleague and fellow member of the [[Cornish Art Colony]], [[Charles A. Platt]], was an artist and architect known for his interest in [[Italian garden]]s. Platt recognized Shipman's talents. He did not know much about [[horticulture]], but was highly respected and thought of as "the man who could design both house and garden for a country estate", for he had recently made a trip to Italy and wrote a book about the gardens there.

David Hanlon, gardener]]

By the time the Shipmans divorced in 1910, Ellen Shipman was well on her way to establishing herself as a talented garden designer nationwide. She and Platt played off their mutual requirements: Platt needed Ellen for her knowledge of horticulture and Ellen needed Platt for his knowledge of drafting and design. Shipman was also heavily influenced by [[Gertrude Jekyll]]'s  brilliant use of borders, as well as memories of her grandparents’ farm. By 1920 she was working independently of Platt, though they continued to collaborate on his residential projects.

=== Designs ===
Among Shipman's earliest collaborations with Platt was the [[Cooperstown, New York]] estate of Fynmere in 1913, owned by the Cooper family on the edge of the village. This project, for descendants of [[William Cooper (judge)|William Cooper]], provided significant visibility for Shipman. While the stone mansion was demolished in 1979, a few elements of the landscape work survive. Shipman also designed the adjoining Cooper estate of Heathcote, which is extant today in private hands. A similar task was undertaken at the Gwinn Estate in [[Cleveland]], where she was asked by Platt to aid him and [[Warren H. Manning]] in their garden designs. It was finished in 1912, one of her earliest projects, and one where her job was largely planting oriented, filling the designs of Platt with lush flower arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lalh.org/the-muses-of-gwinn/|title=The Muses of Gwinn|last=|first=|date=|website=LALH|publisher=Library of American Landscape History|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The courtyard gardens of Manhattan's [[Astor Court Building]] were another Platt-Shipman collaboration.&lt;ref name="CGray2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/01/realestate/streetscapes-89th-street-broadway-1916-astor-building-private-garden-grows.html|title=89th Street and Broadway; In a 1916 Astor Building, a Private Garden Grows|date=1 July 2001|author=Christopher Gray|accessdate=2 February 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Platt and  Shipman's 1915 design  for the Parmelee estate, The Causeway,  in Washington D.C. included a Wild Garden surrounding the mansion and formal gardens. It featured mature trees, large clumps of plants such as rhododendron, walking and riding paths, stone bridges and a pond. This is the only surviving example of Shipman's Wild Gardens.  The Causeway is now called Tregaron Estate and is open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ellen Shipman and the American Garden|last=Tankard|first=Judith B.|publisher=University of Georgia Press|year=2018|isbn=978-0-8203-5208-4|location=Athens, GA|pages=196-198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seen in many ways as Platt's protégé, Shipman was asked on various occasions to rework one of his gardens, including Platt's first major commission, [http://hgarchitects.com/additions/cornish-restoration/ High Court]. Located across the road from Platt's own house in Cornish, New Hampshire, [[Anson Goodyear]] hired Shipman to revitalize the plantings and reconfigure the garden walls.

[[File:Stan Hywett Pool.JPG|thumb|The reflecting pool at [[Stan Hywet Hall]], Akron, Ohio, 1929]]

Her other significant gardens include the Bayou Bend Gardens, [[Longue Vue House and Gardens|Longue Vue Gardens]] in New Orleans, [[Stan Hywet Gardens]], the [[Graycliff]] Estate (now under restoration), [http://metroparkstoledo.com/features-and-rentals/the-manor-house/ Stranahan] Estate (also under reconstruction), [[Middleton House]] and [[Robert M. Hanes House]] at [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]] and [[Duke University]]'s [[Sarah P. Duke Gardens]], which is often named one of her finest works.  

Shipman created her own [[residential garden]]s all over the United States, collaborating with many architects. Her planting plans softened the bones of geometric architecture with planting designs that were muscular enough to speak for themselves. She once said, ''"Remember that the design of your place is its skeleton upon which you will later plant to make your picture. Keep that skeleton as simple as possible."''

==Public recognition and solo work==
[[File:Moonlight Garden, Edison and Ford Winter Estates, Fort Myers, Florida.JPG|thumb|left|Shipman designed The Moonlight Garden at the [[Edison and Ford Winter Estates]] in [[Fort Myers, Florida]] for [[Thomas Edison]]'s wife Mina.]]

Shipman's gardens often appeared in magazines, including ''[[House Beautiful]]''. In 1933, ''[[House &amp; Garden (magazine)|House &amp; Garden]]'' named her the "Dean of Women Landscape Architects". She lectured widely, and completed over 400 projects. Her archives are at [[Cornell University]].  Because much of her work includes labor-intensive plantings and borders, many have not survived. However, it was because of these borders that she was able to connect with her female clientele. Her intent was to provide privacy and a place for interaction with the surroundings. Women found the gardens provided familiarity and comfort.

It is said that throughout the 40 years she practiced landscape architecture, Shipman would only hire graduates from [[Lowthorpe School of Landscape Architecture]], Gardening, and Horticulture for Women. Although it is not thoroughly understood why this was her hiring practice, it is widely believed that because of the time, women were not being given apprenticeships in male offices.

'''Employee exit management''' or '''offboarding''' describes the consciously designed separation process when an employee leaves the company, for which he has previously worked within the scope of a work or service contract. It deals with the formal processes revolving around an employee’s exit from an organization either through voluntary resignation, layoffs or termination.&lt;ref name="offboarding NYU"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nyu.edu/employees/hr-at-your-service/.../offboarding-employees.html|title=Offboarding Employees|website=Nyu.edu|accessdate=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="emptrust"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emptrust.com/blog/off-boarding-best-practices|title=Offboarding Practises|website=Emptrust.com|accessdate=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Offboarding as a technical process==
Offboarding is understood here as a software-supported process in personnel and identity management, which ensures the safe deactivation and documentation of the access rights of employees who have been relieved, thus preventing data misuse and theft. As part of [[computer security]], the process will also ensure that access privileges are revoked when a person leaves, and may also cover other issues such as the recovery of equipment, keys and credit cards to ensure that security integrity be maintained.
In addition, some HR management solutions provide the generation of guidance for the exit interview or "run-offs", by which, for example, the return of company ownership - such as mobile PC and communication devices or company cars - is ensured and the consequences of the departure can be systematically processed for the internal processes (eg the disposition of employee parking spaces or utilization in the cafeteria). The execution of the exit interview itself is already part of the process of offboarding the second variant:
When an employee is relieved there are a number of considerations that an organization needs to make in order to cleanly end the relationship between the company and the employee. The [[company]] as a [[Legal personality|legal entity]] has a responsibility to the employee which may extend beyond the period of employment and this is the primary focus of the exit procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanresources.about.com/od/employeesurveys/a/exitinterview_2.htm|title=Why Don't Employees Participate in Exit Interviews With Their Employer?|website=Humanresources.about.com|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
A good off-boarding process has many benefits including positive employee referral, rehiring and word of mouth. The positive signal to the departing employee as well as to his remaining colleagues by the open handling of an (inevitable) separation and the associated positive effects on the employee satisfaction speaks for the good internal implementation of the off-boarding process (assuming the professional qualification of the internal coaches) Employer's imagination and an open and honest corporate culture. 

In case of the external implementation of the off-boarding process by an external coach, one can say that the latter assumes a more neutral position, which is not colored by common experiences or individual roles and power positions. It may also be advantageous for the external coach to be able to accompany his or her clients free of the objectives of the (former) company and thus - at least in the client's consciousness - more openly and more unobtrusively. The stronger focus on the future, which the coach embodies as an external, can be another argument for this approach. At times the external monitoring can begin before the last working day of the departing employee, but it does not have to end there.

==Termination of contract==
Employees may terminate their contract by resigning or an employer may terminate the contract by dismissing an employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=3968|title=Termination of an employment contract - Acas advice and guidance|date=19 October 2012|website=Acas.org.uk|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Short term employment===
Short term employment is when an employee is hired for less than one year. These will normally end automatically once the end date is reached. However, the employer may wish to end the contract earlier or extend the contract.

===Temporary contract===
A temporary contract is usually around 3 months long. Employers may recruit temporary employees during busy periods such as Christmas. At the end of the temporary contract the employer may wish to offer a permanent position or extend the temporary contract. Temporary contract will also automatically end once the end date is reached.

===Contractor basis===
Employees maybe hired on a contractor basis for the completing of a certain task. Once the task is completed or the event takes place the contract ends.this type of contract employees falls under seasonal works.

==Dismissal==
Dismissal is when the employer ends the contract of an employee. This must be done in a fair way.

There are different types of dismissal:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/dismiss-staff/overview|title=Dismissing staff|website=Gov.uk|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Fair dismissal'''- Based on the reason and the process of dismissal
# '''Unfair dismissal'''- Based on the reason and the process of dismissal
# '''Constructive dismissal'''- This is when a serious breach of contract has been carried out and therefore the employee must resign in response to the employer’s conduct.
# '''Wrongful dismissal'''- This is where you break the terms of an employee’s contract in the dismissal process, e.g. dismissing someone without giving them proper notice.

If the employer dismisses you from 6 April 2009 onwards, they should follow the procedures which are laid out in the Acas Code of Practice on disciplinary and grievance procedures.

The procedure should have the following steps:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/work/work-comes-to-an-end/dismissal/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-11-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208091509/https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/work/work-comes-to-an-end/dismissal/#h-procedures-your-employer-should-follow-when-dismissing-or-disciplining-you |archive-date=2016-02-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#	'''Letter'''- The employer should send you a formal letter explaining the situation.
#	'''Meeting'''- The letter should be followed by a meeting to discuss everything face to face.
#	'''Verdict'''- The employer should then write to you expressing their final decision.
#	'''Appeal'''- You then have the right to appeal against your employer’s decision

===For conduct or performance reasons===
An employer may dismiss you if you are unable to complete the job to the required standard or you have the capability to complete to a high standard but for some reason or another you are unable to.

There is no specific process by law an employer must follow in order to dismiss an individual however it must be carried out fairly.

Misconduct includes persistent lateness or unauthorised absence. It is based on serious misconduct or gross misconduct. Serious misconduct includes poor performance for which the employee should be provided with a formal warning which states that not improving could lead to dismissal. Gross misconduct includes theft, physical violence, serious insubordination and gross negligence for which the employee may be dismissed immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/dismiss-staff/dismissals-on-capability-or-conduct-grounds|title=Dismissing staff|website=Gov.uk|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Due to illness===
An employee may be dismissed due to medical reasons. In some countries, the employer must pay for the employee whilst dismissed for a period not exceeding 20 weeks. The employer may wish to provide the employee with alternative work for the period of time, which is suited to your medical needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/18/part/VII/crossheading/suspension-on-medical-grounds|title=Employment Rights Act 1996|website=Legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Redundancy==
Redundancy is when you dismiss an employee because you no longer need anyone to do their job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/staff-redundant/overview|title=Making staff redundant|website=Gov.uk|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liquidation and administration===
Both company Liquidation and Administration can lead to the end of the company.  Company administration intention is to help the company repay its debts and avoid insolvency. Liquidation is when the company is forced to sell all of its assets before the company vanishes as a whole. This will result in the employees being made redundant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realbusinessrescue.co.uk/articles/business-liquidation-bankruptcy/liquidation-and-administration|title=The Difference Between Liquidation and Administration|website=Realbusinessrescue.co.uk|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
You’ll normally be entitled to statutory redundancy pay if you’re an employee and you’ve been working for your current employer for 2 years or more.

You’ll get:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/redundant-your-rights/redundancy-pay|title=Redundancy: your rights|website=Gov.uk|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#	Half a week's pay for each full year you were under 22
#	One week’s pay for each full year you were 22 or older, but under 41
#	One and half week’s pay for each full year you were 41 or older
Length of service is capped at 20 years and weekly pay is capped at £475. The maximum amount of statutory redundancy pay is £14,250.

'''Enterprise forms automation''' is a company-wide computer system or set of systems for managing, distributing, [[Document processing|completing and processing]] paper-based forms, applications, surveys, contracts and other documents. It plays a vital role towards achieving the goal of a [[paperless office]].

The term "enterprise forms automation" was first used in the mid 1990s by [[JetForm]] Corporation to describe their solution to automating paperwork. This process was later acquired by [[Adobe Systems]] and is now part of the [[Adobe LiveCycle]] suite of products. In 2004 Efficient Technology Inc became the first company to apply this term in the [[software as a service]]. 

This term is intended to refer to the automation of paper-based processes that specifically rely on documents (forms, applications, etc.) that retain their paper-based look and feel even if not printed out during the process. In order for a forms automation solution to be considered an ‘Enterprise Forms Automation’ solution it must meet the requirements of [[enterprise software]] and be specifically focused on automating paperwork and paper-based forms.

==Impact==
Organizations implement enterprise software solutions in order to automate major functions and large processes as these areas offer the greatest cost savings and return on investment compared to smaller projects. Enterprise-level implementations often cost well over $100,000 and therefore take many months to realize cost savings. As such, automating smaller functions are ignored due to the lack of immediate financial benefit or cost savings. As functions become more and more automated while software costs for enterprise systems drop in price, organizations begin automating lower-level functions in order to reap additional cost savings and become more efficient. In addition, through the advent of standards like Adobe’s PDF model and service models like Quik!, automating the process of filling out forms is one such area that companies seek to automate via Enterprise Forms Automation solutions. 

Automating forms also has a positive ‘green’ impact on the environment. In order to reduce waste and carbon emissions, companies seek ways to eliminate paper. By deploying an Enterprise Forms Automation system, companies can eliminate paper entirely or significantly reduce how much paper is used, while greatly reducing shipping and handling costs, storage costs, and printing costs associated to pre-printed forms. In addition, automating paper-based processes greatly speeds up the time it takes to perform transactions, which results in fewer errors, rejections and revisions and has the benefit of freeing up the time spent by users on manual labor.

== Implementation ==
=== DMS ===
In today’s implementation of the paperless office concept there are two main focuses: creating documents and managing documents. Since major systems have already displaced paper altogether (e.g. [[enterprise resource planning]], [[customer relationship management]], [[accounting software]], etc.), the paper that continues to be in use is largely generated by processes that capture data, generate reports and distribute communications. As software and computers have evolved, the first problem to be addressed has been the management of existing and legacy documents through [[document management system]]s. 

Document management and archiving systems do offer some methods of automating forms. Typically, the point in which document management systems start working with a document is when the document is scanned and/or sent into the system. Many document management systems include the ability to read documents via [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) and use that data within the document management system’s framework. While this technology is essential to achieving a paperless office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.quikforms.com/WHITEPAPERAchievingThePaperlessOffice.pdf |title=Achieving The Paperless Office |last=Walker |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard D. Walker |journal=Efficient Technology Inc |date=2009-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it does not address the processes that generate paper in the first place.

The ultimate step towards eliminating paper is to change the way that documents are created. In 1993 Adobe Systems introduced the [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF) in order to facilitate the exchange of documents in a universal manner across most computer platforms. This format has laid the foundation for creating, transporting, working on and archiving electronic documents and in 2008 became an ISO standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = ISO 32000-1:2008  | publisher = International Organization For Standardization  | date = July 1, 2008  | url = http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=51502}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the PDF model established a method for automating forms that allows forms to be prefilled with existing data and manually entered on a PC screen which can greatly reduce and/or eliminate the number of paper forms being printed.

=== Implementation tools ===
A typical Enterprise Forms Automation implementation typically combines the following technologies:
* Library of electronic versions of paper-based documents (PDF format or other comparable format)
* Data store of existing data and/or web page to collect data to fill onto forms
* Software to pre-fill existing data from databases and data stores onto electronic forms
* Software to save forms that are in process and/or partially completed
* Software to capture and translate electronic form data
* Workflow systems to manage the interaction with forms and data
* Two-way messaging between forms and systems during submission and validation
* Barcode software to match images of forms with electronic form data
* Digital signature solutions to capture signatures electronically

=== Implementation challenges ===
The primary challenge to making use of these technologies is a matter of resource planning and implementation costs, however all of the necessary technologies have been in existence since at least 2000. Furthermore, the [[Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act]] (ESIGN Act) was signed into legislation by Congress requiring that digital signatures be accepted as valid signatures. But even with the law in effect, companies have been slow to adopt such solutions due to the cost and skills required to design, build and maintain such systems at a reasonable price.

A secondary challenge is integrating the electronic forms into an existing process, whereby existing data stores can be accessed and supplied to and from the forms. While tools to assist with the integration exist, most implementations require custom programming efforts to the specific forms and data sources.

Many of these challenges are being addressed by middleware solutions, technology platforms and services that tie all the pieces together. Known as [[Enterprise Application Integration]] (“EAI”), developers of EAI solutions are continually introducing new cost-effective methods to take advantage of web-based and centrally-managed capabilities plus the ability to leverage legacy system architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5355">'''Enterprise social software''' (also known as or regarded as a major component of [[Enterprise 2.0]]), comprises [[social software]] as used in "[[Business|enterprise]]" (business/[[commerce|commercial]]) contexts.  It includes social and networked modifications to corporate [[intranet]]s and other classic [[software]] platforms used by large companies to organize their [[communication]].  In contrast to traditional [[enterprise software]], which imposes structure prior to use, enterprise social software tends to encourage use prior to providing structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Makkonen | first1 = H. | last2 = Virtanen | first2 = K. | year = 2015 | title = Social capital approach on Enterprise 2.0: a multiple case study | doi = 10.1080/09537325.2015.1061120 | journal = Technology Analysis &amp; Strategic Management| volume =  27| issue = | pages =  1212–1225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carl Frappaolo and Dan Keldsen defined Enterprise 2.0 in a report written for [[Association for Information and Image Management]] (AIIM) as "a [[system]] of [[World Wide Web|web]]-based [[technology|technologies]] that provide rapid and agile collaboration, information sharing, emergence and integration capabilities in the extended enterprise".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Functionality ===

Social software for an enterprise must (according to [[Andrew McAfee]], Associate Professor, [[Harvard Business School]]) have the following functionality to work well {{Harv|McAfee|2006}}:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;McAfee, Andrew, P. "Enterprise 2.0: The Dawn of Emergent Collaboration" (MIT Sloan Management Review), Spring 2006, Vol.47, No.3&lt;/ref&gt;

* Search: allowing users to search for other users or content
* Links: grouping similar users or content together
* Authoring: including blogs and wikis
* Tags: allowing users to [[tag (metadata)|tag]] content
* Extensions: recommendations of users; or content based on profile
* Signals: allowing people to subscribe to users or content with RSS feeds

McAfee recommends installing easy-to-use software which does not impose any rigid structure on users. He envisages an informal [[roll-out]], but on a common platform to enable future collaboration between areas. He also recommends strong and visible [[management|managerial]] support to achieve this.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2007 [[Dion Hinchcliffe]] expanded the list above by adding the following four functions:&lt;ref&gt;*Hinchcliffe, Dion. [http://www.zdnet.com/blog/hinchcliffe/the-state-of-enterprise-2-0/143 "The state of Enterprise 2.0"], ''ZDNET.com'', London, October 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Freeform function: no barriers to authorship (meaning free from a learning curve or from restrictions)
# Network-oriented function, requiring web-addressable content in all cases
# Social function: stressing transparency (to access), diversity (in content and community members) and openness (to structure)
# Emergence function: requiring the provision of approaches that detect and leverage the collective wisdom of the community

[[Enterprise search]] differs from a typical web search in its focus on "use within an organization by employees seeking information held internally, in a variety of formats and locations, including databases, [[document management system]]s, and other [[wikt:repository|repositories]]".&lt;ref&gt;"Enterprise Search: Seek and Ye Might Find", ''Computers in Libraries'', July/August 2008, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===

There has been recent criticism that the adaptation of the social paradigm (e.g. openness and altruistic behavior) does not always work well for the enterprise setting, which led some authors to question the proper functioning of enterprise social software.&lt;ref&gt;Wang Y, Greaseley A, Thanassoulis E (2011). Combining ERP Systems with Enterprise 2.0, in P. Powell and R. Martinho (eds.) Enterprise Information Systems, Heidelberg: Springer, pp. 198–207&lt;/ref&gt; The findings from a novel study suggests that free and non-anonymous sharing of trusted information (beyond marketing or product information) is significantly influenced by concerns from business users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mettler T, Winter R |title=Are business users social? A design experiment exploring information sharing in enterprise social systems |journal=Journal of Information Technology  |year=2016 |doi=10.1057/jit.2015.28 |volume=31 |pages=101–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Boswell earned his undergraduate and Masters in Computer Science at the [[University of Waterloo]] in [[Ontario]], Canada.
While he was a student and after he earned his masters in 1980, Boswell worked under [[J. Wesley Graham]], a senior Computer Scientist at the University of Waterloo, who had broadly managed teams at Waterloo that developed several widely used [[compiler|computer language compilers]].

One of the first languages that was his design was the ″[[Waterloo Systems Language]]″, intended for systems programming, which introduced some new [[control flow|flow control constructs]].&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Federation of Small Businesses''' ('''FSB''') is a UK business organisation representing [[Small and medium-sized enterprises|small and medium-sized businesses]]. It was formed in 1974 as the National Federation of Self Employed (NFSE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= History|url=https://candidates.fsb.org.uk/our-history.asp|publisher=Federation of Small Businesses}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current name for the organisation was adopted in 1991. It is registered with Companies House as The National Federation of Self Employed &amp; Small Businesses Limited (company number 1263540).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=FSB Annual Report 1991|year=1991|publisher=FSB|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FSB is a member-led, not-for-profit and non-party political organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the FSB|url=http://www.fsb.org.uk/about-us|website=Federation of Small Businesses}}&lt;/ref&gt; FSB is a lobbying organisation representing small firms and the self-employed to UK, national, local and devolved government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FSB Lobbying|url=http://www.fsb.org.uk/benefits/support/lobbying|website=Federation of Small Businesses}}&lt;/ref&gt;  FSB offers its members a range of benefits, such as a 24-hour legal advice line and free business banking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FSB Member Benefits|url=http://www.fsb.org.uk/benefits|website=Federation of Small Businesses}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, FSB's Board of Directors altered the organisation's volunteer structure by switching from elected Branches &amp; Regions to an unelected, ad-hoc approach to local lobbying &amp; representation.
This necessitated changes to FSB's National Council which now comprises 12 appointed representatives, selected from the 9 English regions and the 3 devolved countries.

In 2017 FSB had 184 branches around the UK and these were grouped into 33 regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FSB Annual Report 2016|url=http://www.fsb.org.uk/docs/default-source/fsb-org-uk/fsb-annual-report-and-accounts-2015-2016.pdf|website=Federation of Small Businesses}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each branch and region has its own committee. In addition, there is a national committee which includes representatives from each regional committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=FSB MSP|year=2016|publisher=FSB|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== National campaigns ==

FSB runs a number of national campaigns on behalf of its members, to highlight the needs of Small Businesses and the Self Employed. Most recently FSB ran a ‘Wellbeing’ campaign to support the health of small business owners and their staff.  The campaign was backed by MIND, Public Health England, UK Active, and Seb Coe.  Historically, previous campaigns have included:
* Keep Trade Local: FSB Launched the Keep Trade Local campaign &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FSB Keep Trade Local|url=http://www.fsb.org.uk/docs/default-source/fsb-org-uk/041/assets/press-release-g8-arrives-but-keep-trade-local-140613.pdf|website=Federation of Small Businesses}}&lt;/ref&gt; in August 2008 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FSB Keep Trade Local Launch|url=https://www.fsb.org.uk/media-centre/press-releases/fsb-launches-keep-trade-local-tour-pr-2008-52|website=Federation of Small Businesses}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Real Life Entrepreneurs: FSB launched Real Life Entrepreneurs in October 2011 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FSB Real Life Entrepreneurs Launch|url=http://www.fsb.org.uk/media-centre/press-releases/essex-launch-for-national-real-life-entrepreneurs-campaign-espr-0610er|website=Federation of Small Businesses}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FSB also supports a number of other national campaigns on behalf of its members, to highlight the needs of Small Businesses and the Self Employed.

== Lobbying ==

FSB's past political lobbying activities have led in its own opinion to a number of benefits for small businesses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FSB Policy Issues|url=http://www.fsb.org.uk/standing-up-for-you/policy-issues|website=Federation of Small Businesses}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as:

* Repeatedly overcoming attempts to impose unreasonable National Insurance Contributions
* The introduction of enhanced capital allowances and flexible working hours
* The reduction or removal of Corporation Tax for small limited companies
* VAT reform in the form of a flat rate scheme for small businesses
* An end to automatic fines for incorrect filing of VAT returns

== Events ==

FSB organises events aimed at supporting FSB, its members and the small business community around the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FSB Events|url=http://www.fsb.org.uk/events/events-introduction|website=Federation of Small Businesses}}&lt;/ref&gt;
National events are arranged by FSB's Events Team based in the Blackpool office, with the assistance of a nationwide network of staff and volunteers.

The FSB National Conference attracts more than 1,100 attendees from all over the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FSB Conference|url=http://www.fsb.org.uk/events/past-conferences/2016-conference---glasgow|website=Federation of Small Businesses}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Speakers have included Prime Ministers, Leader of the Opposition, Chancellor of the Exchequer and many more.

The FSB National Conference was replaced with a Business Show in 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FSB Business Show|url=http://www.fsb.org.uk/events/2017-FSB-National-Business-Show|website=Federation of Small Businesses}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

FSB is running a series of regional Awards to celebrate small businesses.  These are open for nomination now, with 12 categories in each.  The awards will take place in Spring 2018, building up to a national final in May 2018 as part of FSB’s Chairman’s Dinner.

FSB is represented at local events like Nottinghamshire County Fair, Lincoln Show, Love Business East Midlands, and others. FSB's Regions and Branches host regular meetings around the country. Generally Branch meetings are open to all members. FSB also runs business networking events around the UK.

FSB is a member-led federation. Membership criteria are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Membership Requirements|url=http://www.fsb.org.uk/about-us/faqs/non-member-faqs|website=Federation of Small Businesses}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hassan Nemazee''' (born January 27, 1950) is a multimillionaire [[Iranian-American]] investment banker and convicted felon.

==Life==
Nemazee was born in [[Washington, D.C.]] on January 27, 1950 and attended [[Landon School]], graduating in 1968. He received his Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree with Honors from [[Harvard University]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranianamericanpac.org/leadership/p_nemazee.shtml Hassan Nemazee&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nemazee has not returned to Iran since the [[Iranian revolution]]. Most of his family's property was seized by the new Iranian government.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}  On August 25, 2009 Nemazee was arrested for fraudulently applying for a loan of over $74 million from Citigroup. The maximum penalty for the offense is 30 years in prison. He was subsequently accused of fraudulently obtaining $292 million of loans from three banks and of using the proceeds to both support his lifestyle and make political contributions&lt;ref&gt;http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/.../hassan-nemazee-indictment.php?...&lt;/ref&gt;

Nemazee is the brother of Susie Nemazee, the wife of the British Ambassador in Washington DC, Sir [[Peter Westmacott]].

Nemazee is the Chairman of Nemazee Capital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nemazee.com NEMAZEE CAPITAL – Hassan Nemazee – 30 Years of Investment Experience&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Based upon the allegations of fraud contained in Mr. Nemazee's indictment, it is difficult to determine what legitimate business, if any, was ever conducted by Nemazee Capital.

==Business interests==
Nemazee Capital was established in 1987 and was purported, on its website, to have, either directly or through associated entities, invested in the following sectors: health care, media, oil and gas, insurance, investment banking, asset management, newspapers, real estate development, technology, and communications.

Nemazee claims to have created Nemazee Holdings in the early 1970s and entered the financial services industry by partnering directly with AIG; at the time, according to information supplied by Nemazee, it was unique for the insurance giant to enter into such a relationship. Around this same time Nemazee claims to have created a joint venture for the establishment of a bank with Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, predecessor to [[JP Morgan &amp; Co]]. Nemazee Capital evolved out of Nemazee Holdings and originally focused on real estate development.&lt;ref&gt;Please note: The majority of information contained in this entry, especially concerning Mr. Nemazee's alleged business achievements and interests cannot be verified and must be evaluated in light of his recent arrest for fraud and grand larceny.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political involvement==
Nemazee was, prior to his arrest, also known as one of the top political bundlers in the United States.

President Clinton nominated Nemazee to be Ambassador to Argentina on January 6, 1999, but the nomination was returned without action on August 5, 1999.

During the [[United States presidential election, 2004]], Nemazee was a supporter of [[John Kerry]] and a major contributor to his campaign. 
He was the New York Finance Chair for the Kerry campaign, and later the national finance chairman of the [[Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://marketplace.publicradio.org/shows/2006/10/30/PM200610304.html Marketplace: Hedge funds leaning blue&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 
With Nemazee as the national finance chair, Chuck Schumer's DSCC in 2006 raised $115 million, outpacing the NRSC by substantial sums, and helping the Democratic Party take control of the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.changetheparty.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=53&amp;Itemid=57&lt;/ref&gt; During his presidency, [[Bill Clinton]] nominated Nemazee to fill the position of U.S. Ambassador to [[Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/16/politics/campaign/16donors.html?ex=1250308800&amp;en=0d1e94d3797ddd53&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland The New York Times &amp;gt; Washington &amp;gt; Campaign 2004 &gt; Cash Collectors for Kerry Race Run the Gamut&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to Congressional concerns about Nemazee's convoluted and controversial business dealings, the nomination was subsequently withdrawn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1999/0503/6309142a.html|title=Warning flags|author=Graham Button|date=3 May 1999|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
More recently, Nemazee served as Finance Chairman to Hillary Clinton's 2007-08 presidential campaign, and also donated $50,000 (the maximum amount) to Barack Obama's [[United States presidential inauguration#Presidential Inaugural Committee|Presidential Inaugural Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pic2009.org/page/content/donors/|title=PicSell, promote your photos online, set up your photo gallery.|work=PicSell Australia|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081214211329/http://www.pic2009.org/page/content/donors/|archivedate=2008-12-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Nemazee was a [[bundler (campaigning)|bundler]] for the 2009 Presidential Inaugural Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pic2009.org/page/content/bundlers/|title=PicSell, promote your photos online, set up your photo gallery.|work=PicSell Australia|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220013726/http://www.pic2009.org/page/content/bundlers/|archivedate=2009-02-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest==
Hassan Nemazee was arrested on August 25, 2009 for allegedly defrauding Citi bank by using false documents to secure a loan.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=aWy8uHSaXZB4&lt;/ref&gt;

Nemazee's additional frauds exceed $100 Million, according to Federal prosecutors &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125192477445680911|title=Fund-Raiser Faces New Allegations|author=Chad Bray|date=3 September 2009|work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010 he was convicted of multiple counts of [[bank fraud]] and [[wire fraud]] and was sentenced to 12½ years in prison by U.S. District Court Judge [[Sidney H. Stein]] in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]] in Manhattan. The sentence was lighter than the 15½ to 19½ years that prosecutors had wanted.

'''Hezekiah Frith, Sr.''' (1763–1848) was an 18th-century British ship owner with the reputation of a "gentleman privateer", who engaged in piracy during the 1790s. One of the richest men in [[Bermuda]] during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, he built the Spithead House in [[Warwick, Bermuda]].&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bermuda-online.org/seewark.htm |title=Bermuda's Warwick Parish |author=Forbes, Keith Archibald |date=20 May 2008 |publisher=Bermuda-online.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was married three times, his daughters all marrying [[Presbyterian]] ministers; his son [[Hezekiah Frith, Jr.]] became a prominent religious figure. Brother and sister [[Heather Nova]] and [[Mishka (musician)|Mishka]], two popular Bermudian singers and songwriters, are descendants of Frith.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Rosemary. ''Moon Bermuda''. Emeryville, California: Avelon Travel Publishing, 2006 (p. 65); {{ISBN|1-56691-902-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable descendants include Graham Frith, one of original Buy Out Riddim and Smirnoff Ice promoters; Duncan Frith-Hunter, Learn-a-lot class of 1994; and Ian Frith, EDM connoisseur, part-time professional fence consultant, and the 4th member of Swedish House Mafia. When pictured together, the three Frith brothers are commonly referred to as Ert, Win &amp; Fyah!

==Biography==
[[File:"Spithead" - 18th Century Bermudian home of Hezekiah Frith and 20th Century home of Eugene O'Neill.jpg|thumb|left|"Spithead", the 18th Century Bermudian home of Hezekiah Frith and 20th Century home of [[Eugene O'Neill]] and [[Oona O'Neill]].]]
Born in Bermuda, he was one of seven children born to [[Captain William Frith]] and Sarah Lee. As a successful shipowner during the 1780s and 90s, he became engaged in privateering and smuggling, from which he reportedly made his fortune.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, Croswell. ''The Curse of the Misbegotten: A Tale of the House of O'Neill''. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1959. (pg. 159)&lt;/ref&gt; As was normal practise in Bermuda, he often mixed slaves and free men in his crews.&lt;ref&gt;Zuill, William S. ''The Story of Bermuda and Her People''. New York: Macmillan, 1973. (pg.108)&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1796 he slipped into the French port of [[Cap-Haïtien|Cap Français]] at [[San Domingo]] during the night and stole away a captured British transport ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boda.bm/pages/boda_heritage.htm |title=Competitive Sailing: Bermuda's Shared Maritime Heritage |author=Bermuda Optimist Dinghy Association |date=21 May 2008 |publisher=Boda.bm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627222926/http://www.boda.bm/pages/boda_heritage.htm |archivedate=27 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His colourful piratical career may very likely be exaggerated. Participating in a number of privateering expeditions with the [[Royal Navy]], he is supposed to have hoarded treasure from at least two captured ships in the store he operated next to the Spithead House; he supposedly used the water tank at Spithead to smuggle captured goods and other valuable items before filing claim at the Customs House. Frith is also claimed to have rescued (or kidnapped) a Frenchwoman, whom he kept there as a [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]: both are said to haunt the house, according to local lore. The house would later be owned successively by dramatist [[Eugene O'Neill]], Sir [[Noël Coward]]&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.experiencebermuda.com/art/ |title=Art Scene: Bookish Bermuda |author=Gorham, Laura |year=2003 |publisher=ExperienceBermuda.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charlie Chaplin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cruisecritic.com/ports/newport.cfm?ID=130 |title=Ports: King's Wharf |year=1995 |publisher=CruiseCritic.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Granaway home on [[Harbor Road (Bermuda)|Harbor Road]], which he had built for his daughter, was later bought by a family of free blacks descended from a slave named Caprice, who had originally been brought to Bermuda on a ship captured by Hezekiah Frith on one of his voyages. [[Adele Tucker]], a well-known Bermudian educator and co-founder of [[Bermuda Union of Teachers]], grew up in the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bermudabiographies.bm/Bios/bio-adeletucker.html |title=Adele Evelina Johnson Tucker |year=2007 |publisher=BermudaBiographies.bm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091115200349/http://bermudabiographies.bm/Bios/bio-adeletucker.html |archivedate=15 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since early in his career, Kotter has received numerous awards for his thought leadership in his field from ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'', ''[[Bloomberg BusinessWeek]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2001-10-14/rating-the-management-gurus |title=Rating the Management Gurus |publisher=Businessweek |date=2001-10-14 |accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thinkers50,&lt;ref name="thinkers50.com"/&gt; Global Gurus&lt;ref name="globalgurus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalgurus.org/management/managementgurus30.php|title=Management Guru's &amp;#124;|publisher=globalgurus.org|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

==Written Work==
Kotter is the author of 20 books, 12 of which have been business bestsellers and two of which are overall New York Times bestsellers.&lt;ref name="Kotter"/&gt;

===''Leading Change''===
His international bestseller ''Leading Change ''(1996), "is considered by many to be the seminal work in the field of change management."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Aiken |first=Carolyn |author2=Keller, Scott |title=The Irrational Side of Change Management |url=https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/the-irrational-side-of-change-management |date=April 2009 |work=The McKinsey Quarterly |publisher=McKinsey &amp; Company |accessdate=18 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; William C. Finnie, Editor-in-Chief of Strategy &amp; Leadership described it as "simply the best single work I have seen on strategy implementation".&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Leading Change|author=Kotter, J.P.|date=1996|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|isbn=9780875847474|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ib9Xzb5eFGQC|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book outlines a practical 8-step process for change management :
* Establishing a Sense of Urgency 
* Creating the Guiding Coalition 
* Developing a Vision and Strategy 
* Communicating the Change Vision 
* Empowering Employees for Broad-Based Action 
* Generating Short-Term Wins 
* Consolidating Gains and Producing More Change 
* Anchoring New Approaches in the Culture

In 2011, TIME magazine listed ''Leading Change'' as one of the "Top 25 Most Influential Business Management Books" of all time.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/completelist/0,29569,2086680,00.html |title=Complete List - The 25 Most Influential Business Management Books - TIME |publisher=content.time.com|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Medintz|first=Scott|title=Top 25 Most Influential Business Management Books: Leading Change (1996), by John Kotter|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2086680_2086683_2087679,00.html|publisher=TIME.com|accessdate=17 September 2013|date=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Our Iceberg is Melting''===
In 2006, Kotter co-wrote ''Our Iceberg is Melting''&lt;ref name="macmillan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.macmillan.com/ouricebergismelting/JohnKotter |title=Our Iceberg Is Melting &amp;#124; John Kotter &amp;#124; Macmillan |publisher=us.macmillan.com|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Holger Rathgeber where those same 8 steps were expanded into an allegory about penguins. In the book, a group of penguins whose iceberg is melting must change in order to survive while their iceberg home melts.

===''Accelerate''===
More recently, Kotter released ''Buy In'' &lt;ref name="kotterinternational"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kotterinternational.com/our-principles/buy-in |title=Buy-In - Kotter International |publisher=kotterinternational.com|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2010), ''A Sense of Urgency''&lt;ref name="amazon"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Sense-Urgency-John-P-Kotter/dp/1422179710 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924174141/http://www.amazon.com/Sense-Urgency-John-P-Kotter/dp/1422179710 |archive-date=24 September 2008 |dead-url=yes |title=Amazon.com: A Sense of Urgency (9781422179710): John P.

Kotter: Books|publisher=amazon.com|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His educational articles in the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' magazine continue to be among the magazine's top sellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hasbe|first=Sudhir|title=25 Best-Selling Harvard Business Review articles of all time|url=http://mgmtblog.com/?p=232|work=mgmtblog.com|publisher=Management and Strategy|accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Harvard Business Review'' article "Accelerate!",&lt;ref name="hbr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hbr.org/2012/11/accelerate |title=Accelerate! - HBR |publisher=hbr.org|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he outlines a new type of business structure, won the 2012 McKinsey Award, recognizing it as the most significant article published in the magazine that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 2012 McKinsey Award Winners|url=http://hbr.org/2013/04/the-2012-mckinsey-award-winners/ar/1|work=www.HBR.org|publisher=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1113">'''Joshua Bell''' (c. 1812 -  24 December 1863) was born in [[Ireland]] and immigrated to [[Canada]] with his brother and father somewhere between 1815 and 1825.

The father, Alexander, was a [[shoemaker]] and the family became successful in that business. After the father's death, the two brothers expanded the business with Joshua taking the lead role. By his death, their company,  J. and T. Bell was one of the larger footwear factories in Montreal. In the 1861, it had  70 employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=4293 Biography at the ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Joshua was important to the economic history of the time in that he was a pioneer of [[mechanization]] of shoe production in Canada.

The '''KPMG tax shelter fraud''' scandal involves allegedly illegal U.S. tax shelters by [[KPMG]] that were exposed beginning in 2003. In early 2005, the United States member firm of KPMG International, KPMG [[Limited liability partnership|LLP]], was accused by the [[United States Department of Justice]] of fraud in marketing abusive [[tax shelter]]s.

==Deferred prosecution agreement==
Under a [[deferred prosecution agreement]], KPMG LLP admitted criminal wrongdoing in creating fraudulent tax shelters to help wealthy clients dodge $2.5 billion in taxes and agreed to pay $456 million in penalties. KPMG LLP will not face criminal prosecution as long as it complies with the terms of its agreement with the government. On January 3, 2007, the criminal conspiracy charges against KPMG were dropped.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/03/AR2007010301883.html&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Federal Attorney [[Michael J. Garcia]] stated that the charges could be reinstated if KPMG does not continue to submit to continued monitorship through September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/01/03/business/NA_FIN_US_KPMG_Tax_Shelters.php&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 August 2005, nine individuals, including six former KPMG partners and the former deputy chairman of the firm, were criminally indicted in relation to the multibillion-dollar criminal tax fraud conspiracy. The nine individuals named in the indictment were:
* Jeffrey Stein, former Deputy Chairman of KPMG, former Vice Chairman of Tax Services, and former KPMG tax partner, a lawyer with a Master's in tax law.
* John Lanning, former Vice Chairman of Tax Services, and former KPMG tax partner, a CPA (Certified Public Accountant).
* Richard Smith, former Vice Chairman of KPMG in charge of Tax, a former leader of KPMG's Washington National Tax, and former KPMG tax partner, a lawyer.
* Philip Wiesner, former Partner-In-Charge of KPMG's Washington National Tax and former KPMG tax partner, a lawyer with a Master's in tax law and a CPA.
* John Larson, a lawyer, CPA and former KPMG Senior Tax Manager who left KPMG to form a series of entities with defendant Robert Pfaff, which entities participated in certain tax shelter transactions as the purported investment advisor.
* Robert Pfaff, a lawyer, CPA and former KPMG tax partner, who left KPMG to form a series of entities with defendant John Larson.
* Raymond J. Ruble, also known as R.J. Ruble, a lawyer and former tax partner in the New York, New York, office of [[Sidley Austin]], a prominent national law firm.
* Mark Watson, former Partner-in-Charge of the Personal Financial Planning division in KPMG'S Washington National Tax, and former KPMG tax partner, a CPA.

On 17 October 2005, another ten individuals were indicted on criminal conspiracy and tax evasion charges:
*

The four tax shelters at issue were known as [[BLIPS]], or bond linked issue premium structure; Flips, or foreign leveraged investment program; OPIS, or offshore portfolio investment strategy and a variant of Flips; and SOS, or short option strategies.

==Chronology==
In August 2005, former official of the German bank Bayerische Hypo-Und Vereinsbank AG (HVB) Domenick DeGiorgio, who worked with KPMG to sell the shelters, pleaded guilty to tax evasion and fraud charges.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/22/AR2005082201484.html&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 February 2006, HVB admitted to criminal wrongdoing for its participation in the KPMG tax shelter fraud. The prosecution against the company was deferred by agreement with the U.S. Attorney. Under its deferred prosecution agreement, the company will pay $29.6 million in fines, restitution and penalties.&lt;ref&gt;http://lib.law.virginia.edu/Garrett/prosecution_agreements/press_release/German_Bank_HVB.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 March 2006, U.S. District Judge [[Lewis A. Kaplan]] released former KPMG accounting executive David Greenberg on $25 million bail.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/03/09/business/kpmg.php&lt;/ref&gt; Kaplan's ruling reversed his previous denial of bail to Greenberg.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.accountancy.com.pk/newsprac.asp?newsid=620&lt;/ref&gt;  Judge Kaplan ordered Greenberg to live in Manhattan under electronic monitoring until his trial for tax fraud begins, and warned his family that they would be financially ruined if Greenberg attempted to flee the country. Kaplan also said that Greenberg's finances were in such disarray that it was impossible to figure out where his assets were and how much he was worth. Called a flight risk by federal prosecutors, Greenberg was the only defendant to be arrested by authorities when the indictments were handed down in October 2005.

On 28 March 2006, David Rivkin pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and tax evasion in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/03/28/business/kpmg.php&lt;/ref&gt;  "I knew that the losses should not have been claimed on the tax forms," Rivkin told Judge Kaplan. Rivkin admitted that he conspired with others between January 1999 and May 2004 to prepare and execute false documents so that clients could file false tax returns. He also admitted that he took steps to conceal the existence of fraudulent tax shelters from the Internal Revenue Service and avoided registering the shelters with the IRS by claiming attorney-client [[privilege (law)|privileges]]. Rivkin signed an agreement to cooperate with prosecutors, who could then ask the judge to consider giving Rivkin a more lenient sentence rather than the years he might face in prison. Sentencing was set for Feb. 9, 2007.

On 27 June 2006, Judge Kaplan ruled that by threatening KPMG with indictment unless the firm reneged on its policy of paying the defense costs of partners who were indicted for work performed in the course of the firm's tax shelter business, the Department of Justice violated the constitutional rights of employees. In his opinion, Judge Kaplan agreed with the defendants' contention that KPMG was improperly pressured not to pay their legal expenses, "because the government held the proverbial gun to its head."

In the meantime, related rulings were handed down in a civil case that had been brought against the Internal Revenue Service in late 2004 by two Texas lawyers, Harold W. Nix and C. Cary Patterson. Nix and Patterson sued the IRS for refunds after the tax agency denied each of their claims for nearly $67 million in deductions stemming from their use of the [[BLIPS]] tax shelter in 2000. Their lawsuit was thought to be relevant to the KPMG tax shelter fraud case, because BLIPS is one of the tax shelters alleged to be abusive by the prosecution in that matter. On 20 July 2006, Judge [[T. John Ward]] of United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas ruled that the use of BLIPS by Nix and Patterson was essentially legitimate, because the I.R.S.'s application of tougher Treasury Department rules in 2003 to liabilities that occurred in BLIPS was "ineffective" and "not enforceable" because it was [[Ex post facto law|retroactive]]. The Internal Revenue Code generally prohibits retroactive regulations. In response to this ruling, prosecutors in the KPMG case have indicated that they will argue that the BLIPS shelter itself was technically valid, but that the way the defendants carried it out was fraudulent. In turn, lawyers for the defendants argue that no court of law has ever ruled that the tax shelters in question were illegal. And in February 2007, Judge Ward essentially reversed himself and ruled the tax shelter consisted of fake bank loans and therefore illegitimate, despite his previous ruling identified in the link above.

On 8 February 2007, [[Deutsche Bank]] reached a settlement with hundreds of investors to whom it sold aggressive U.S. tax shelters similar to those attacked by prosecution in the KPMG tax fraud case.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/02/08/business/tax.php&lt;/ref&gt; This settlement came a year after US DOJ prosecutors in Manhattan announced their investigation of Deutsche Bank's role in questionable tax shelters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/02/15/business/tax.php&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 May 2007, the Second Circuit dismissed a complaint against accounting firm KPMG to recover fees and expenses arising from criminal tax fraud charges involving former KPMG partners and employees.  The court held that the district court, which presides over the criminal case, erred in extending "ancillary" jurisdiction to the civil dispute between the defendants and non-party KPMG.  Treating KPMG's appeal as a petition for writ of mandamus, the court issued the writ, vacated the district court's orders, and dismissed the civil complaint.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysnative/RDpcT3BpbnNcT1BOXDA2LTQzNTgtY3Zfb3BuLnBkZg==/06-4358-cv_opn.pdf#xml=http://10.213.23.111:8080/isysquery/irl30c2/2/hilite ''Stein v. KPMG, LLP'', No. 06-4358 (2d Cir. May 23, 2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 July 2007, Judge Kaplan dismissed charges against 13 former KPMG employees, ruling that he had no alternative because the government had strong-armed KPMG into not paying the legal fees of defendants and had violated their rights.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/17/business/17kpmg.html?ei=5088&amp;en=090bf767b7bcf7ec&amp;ex=1342324800&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;pagewanted=print&lt;/ref&gt;  "This indictment charges serious crimes. They should have been decided on the merits as to every defendant," Kaplan wrote. "But there are limits on the permissible actions of even the best prosecutors." Barring KPMG from paying its former employees' legal bills "foreclosed these defendants from presenting the defenses they wished to present, and, in some cases, even deprived them of the counsel of their choice. This is intolerable in a society that holds itself out to the world as a paragon of justice," Kaplan wrote in his ruling. Kaplan's decision did not affect the prosecution of R.J. Ruble, a former law partner at [[Sidley Austin]] LLP, and three former KPMG partners, including David Greenberg, who worked in the firm's Orange County office and released KPMG from any obligation to him when he left its employ. John Larson and Robert Pfaff, the other two former partners still facing charges, left KPMG eight years before the criminal action was filed and did not initially seek to have the accounting firm pay their legal bills.

On 20 August 2007, the prosecutors announced that one of the aiders and abetters of tax fraud, David Amir Makov, agreed to plead guilty and cooperate with prosecution of his former colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/20/business/20tax.html?ex=1345348800&amp;en=8685cbeba4e14ad3&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink&lt;/ref&gt; In the preceding week, the federal court in Manhattan received $150,000 from Mr. Makov as part of a bail modification agreement that allows him to travel to Israel. Because Makov never worked for KPMG, he was unaffected by Judge Kaplan's dismissal of charges against 13 of his codefendants.

On 10 September 2007, Makov entered a guilty plea to one information count of conspiracy. He agreed to pay a $10 million penalty and provided new details on those involved. Makov gave a brief explanation on the workings of [[BLIPS]], or Bond Linked Issue Premium Structure, which he said he helped create. In previous hearings, Judge Kaplan had chastised prosecutors for failing to explain clearly how BLIPS worked. According to Makov's testimony, the BLIPS shelters were created to generate artificial losses that were then used by wealthy investors to offset gains in legitimate income. The shelter involved a purported investment component as well as banks, extending purported loans to investors. According to prosecutors, BLIPS were marketed and sold around 1999 and 2000 to at least 186 wealthy investors and generated at least $5.1 billion in phony tax losses. The Presidio entities that Makov formed, owned, and operated with co-defendants Robert Pfaff and John Larson, both former KPMG employees, made at least $134 million selling BLIPS. The IRS regards a tax shelter as abusive if it has no legitimate business purpose or genuine economic substance, in contrast to real loans, with money at risk, or real investments. According to Makov, although BLIPS were created on paper to look like seven-year investments, they involved neither real loans nor real investment components. "There was no economic substance," Makov testified. "Instead, we created the appearance of economic substance, rather than the reality." Makov claimed that although he initially thought that BLIPS were legitimate, "as part of the deception" he was eventually "asked by representatives of Bank A," among others, "to come up with an investment rationale." He added that he was "clearly told by Bank A, KPMG" and others "that the loan was not at risk." According to ''The New York Times'', people close to the case have identified "Bank A" as [[Deutsche Bank AG]]. The bank has not been charged, but is expected to reach a settlement with the government. A graduate of the [[Harvard Business School]] and a one-time employee of [[Long-Term Capital Management]], prior to founding Presidio around 1999, Makov worked at [[Deutsche Morgan Grenfell]], an investment banking arm of Deutsche Bank AG. Makov was originally charged with dozens of counts of fraud, tax evasion and conspiracy, with each count carrying five years in jail. Prosecutors are expected to drop all of the other charges if he cooperates throughout the trial.

Jury selection for the KPMG tax shelter fraud trial began on 9 October 2007. However, on 18 October 2007, Judge Kaplan postponed indefinitely the trial set to begin in five days, discharging jurors he had already selected to hear the case, and removing Steven Bauer of [[Latham &amp; Watkins]], a lawyer for former KPMG executive John Larson. The government had previously asked the judge to decide whether Bauer should be removed because he worked as a lawyer for Makov and may have a conflict of interest. Larson had declined to waive his right to have an attorney free of conflicting interests. Kaplan ruled to disqualify Bauer as trial counsel for Larson, and pledged to address the issue of whether Latham &amp; Watkins should also be disqualified if Larson seeks to be represented by another lawyer at that firm.

On 28 August 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the dismissal of criminal charges against 13 former executives at KPMG. The Court held that the government prosecutors "unjustifiably interfered with defendants' relationship with counsel and their ability to mount a defense, in violation of the Sixth Amendment...." by pressuring KPMG to refrain from paying their legal fees.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Stein'', 541 F.3d 130 (2d Cir. 2008), at [https://scholar.google.ca/scholar_case?q=%22541+F.3d+130%22&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=3,44&amp;case=10923022403932047606&amp;scilh=0].&lt;/ref&gt; Separately on the same day, Deputy U.S. Attorney General Mark Filip announced new prosecution rules aimed at not penalizing companies as noncooperative for protecting attorney-client material or paying for their employees' attorneys in probes. "No corporation is obligated to cooperate or to seek cooperation credit by disclosing information to the government," Filip said at a press conference at the New York Stock Exchange. "Refusal by a corporation to cooperate, just like refusal by an individual to cooperate, is not evidence of guilt."

On 15 October 2008, opening arguments began in the trial of David Greenberg and Robert Pfaff, former KPMG tax partners; John Larson, former KPMG senior tax manager; and Raymond Ruble, former partner at law firm Sidley Austin. The four defendants are charged with conspiring to evade taxes for more than 600 clients in a case that was touted as the largest criminal tax prosecution when it started in 2005 with 19 defendants, but is being tried on a much smaller scale. Assistant U.S. attorney John Hillebrecht told the jury in Manhattan federal court that the four men lied and cheated "by making the tax bills of some of our nation's richest citizens disappear." In turn, Larson's defense lawyer, Thomas Hagemann, stated that his client believed in good faith that what he did was allowed under the law, openly conducted his dealings, and acted with "good faith disclosure". Hagemann called David Makov, a former colleague of Larson, turned one of the government's main witnesses, "a liar and perjurer". The trial is expected to last three to four months.

On 24 November 2008, two of the remaining four defendants, former KPMG tax partner Robert Pfaff and former senior tax manager John Larson, filed a motion  to dismiss the charges against them or declare a mistrial. The motion said that during the trial prosecutors elicited testimony from a witness accusing Pfaff and Larson of concealing information from KPMG and its tax department to obtain KPMG approval for BLIPS, thus transforming a tax fraud conspiracy with KPMG against the IRS into an [[honest services fraud]] conspiracy against KPMG. The motion said the defense had received no notice of such a change in the prosecution's theory and could not prepare a defense and so sought to have the judge to dismiss the indictment or grant a mistrial. The motion claimed  that the government's alleged deceitful procurement of KPMG's confidential tax returns through a parallel civil tax fraud investigation by the DOJ was a violation of due process.  The defendants relied on three cases where district courts dismissed indictments or suppressed evidence "where the Government has brought a civil action solely to obtain evidence for its criminal prosecution, or has failed to advise the defendant in its civil proceeding that it contemplates his criminal prosecution."  (Two of these cases were later reversed on appeal.) The prosecution responded that the government has always alleged, and still contends, that KPMG as an entity was a conspirator, not a victim of any kind of fraud. "That for a period of time there was an effort to keep certain facts from certain individual KPMG employees is of no moment whatever," the government said. Judge Kaplan rejected the motion, finding that neither of the circumstances invoked by the defendants applied to their case: "Defendants do not deny that there was a bona fide civil investigation, they complain merely that there was a criminal investigation as well.  And defendants, who were not the targets of the civil investigation, do not claim to have been deceived by the government."  In a footnote, the court notes that the defendants relied in part on the fact that four of the now dismissed defendants had given deposition testimony while unaware of the criminal investigation.  Judge Kaplan added that they "do not suggest that the government deceived these individuals," suggesting perhaps that if the government had engaged in some deceptive conduct, the defendants' motion might have had more traction.

1 December 2008 marked the expiration of the deadline for the federal prosecutors to seek [[certiorari]] by asking the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] to reconsider the 28 August 2008 [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|2nd Circuit appeals court]]'s decision that upheld the 17 July 2007 ruling by Judge Kaplan in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|Southern District Court of New York]], dismissing criminal charges against 13 of the 19 original defendants.

From 8 to 10 December 2008, the jury heard closing arguments in the KPMG tax shelter case. Raymond Ruble's lawyer Jack S. Hoffinger told jurors that it was impossible to conclude that the defendants purposefully tried to break the law in helping at least 600 wealthy people trim their taxes, since they did not try to hide what they were doing from the Internal Revenue Service or others. "What do we have, a massive suicide pact?" he asked. He said that the defendants would not have designed something criminal and then "put it out there so that the IRS will see it, the government will see it and we will end up in court charged with a crime." Assistant U.S. Attorney Margaret Garnett retorted that the defendants created tax shelters that were actually shams meant to appear to be legitimate investments: "These defendants sold these so-called investments for years and years and not a single one of these defendants' clients ever made a dime of profit." She said that the only purpose of the fraudulent tax shelters marketed from 1997 until 2000 was to "generate artificial tax losses to evade millions and millions of taxes." She speculated that the defendants may have had a false sense of safety from the law, and claimed that "their greed and ambition overcame their sense of right and wrong."

On 18 December 2008, lawyer Raymond Ruble, who once was a partner at Brown &amp; Wood, was convicted on 10 counts of tax evasion while investment consultants Robert Pfaff and John Larson were convicted on 12 counts. They were acquitted of conspiracy. David Greenberg, deemed by the prosecution an "ongoing danger to the community" and a flight risk, was acquitted of all charges. Greenberg was jailed for five months and required to wear electronic monitoring for two and a half years afterward. His acquittal came as a result of Steve Acosta, a key government witness, being "utterly incapable of giving a straight answer on cross examination", as conceded by Assistant U.S. Attorney John Hillebrecht in closing arguments. Acosta has pleaded guilty to conspiracy and tax evasion in a cooperation deal aimed at leniency at sentencing, a possibility the government said was now in jeopardy. Without leniency, he could face three years in prison. Judge Kaplan ordered that electronic monitoring begin for Pfaff at his Golden, Colo., home and for Larson at his New York City home, though the judge said he would reassess the need at a bail hearing next month, especially after what happened with Greenberg. Six people, including former KPMG tax partner David Rivkin; David Amir Makov, a one-time currency and fixed-income derivatives trader at Presidio; and Domenick DeGiorgio, a former managing director at German bank HVB, or Bayerische Hypo &amp; Vereinsbank, have pleaded guilty to criminal charges in the matter.

Some of KPMG's tax shelter clients are now suing KPMG for the liability exposure.

'''Battulga Khaltmaa''' ({{lang-mn|Халтмаагийн Баттулга}}, ''Khaltmaagiin Battulga'', {{IPA-mn|xɑɮtʰ.maː.ɡiːŋ ˈbɑtʰ.tʰʊ.ɮɐɢ|}}, born 3 March 1963) is a [[Mongolia]]n politician who has served as the [[President of Mongolia]] since 10 July 2017. He served as Member of the [[State Great Khural]] from 2004 to 2016 and Minister of Roads, Transportation, Construction and Urban Development from 2008 to 2012. He was the [[Democratic Party (Mongolia)|Democratic Party]]'s candidate in the [[Mongolian presidential election, 2017|2017 presidential election]], and was elected President with 50.6% in the run-off, the first ever run-off election in modern Mongolian history.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gec.gov.mn/details/2188&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Battulga is a second child. His father and mother are both from [[Ulaanbaatar]]. The family was allocated a traditional “ger” in Yarmag ger district in Ulaanbaatar after they lost everything in the flood of [[Tuul River]] in 1966. Hence, Battulga grew up in the streets of Yarmag and went to a local secondary school. When he graduated from 8th grade, his teacher recommended that he apply to an arts school given his talents. Battulga graduated in 1982. While studying at the Arts School, Battulga sold his paintings to tourists around Bayangol Hotel area, learning sufficient English to help sell his artwork.

His father was a coach of Mongolian traditional wrestling and thus Battulga grew up wrestling. Battulga was a member of the Mongolian National wrestling team in 1979-1990. Battulga won the world cup championship in Ulaanbaatar in 1989. Wrestling allowed Battulga to travel internationally at a period, when travel abroad for Mongolians was not allowed. Battulga was awarded an Merited Sportsmen of Mongolia in 1995, thereafter being selected as the Chairman of Mongolian [[Judo]] Federation in 2006. Under Battulga’s leadership at the Judo Federation, Mongolian judokas became Olympic Champions for the first time in history.

In 1990, Battulga started sewing and selling jeans locally and in Hungary. This allowed him to make $600, sufficient to buy a video camera and to start an export-import business trading electronics from Singapore to Mongolia, Russia and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gencobook.com/blog/-/2016/1/8 Became national bestseller]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 8 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.24tsag.mn/content/17013.shtml “24 Facts from the Biography of a Mongolian Millionaire: Kh.Battulga”] by D.Undrakh, 24tsag.mn, 22 August 2012,&lt;/ref&gt;

Battulga, like many others of his generation was fascinated with ''[[The Godfather]]'' movie. Thus, he named his first company Genco. This nickname has stuck with him ever since.

Genco acquired controlling interests during the privatization of state-owned assets such as Bayangol Hotel and meat-processing factory Makh-Impex in 1997 and 1999 respectively. In the 1990s Genco group started one of the first taxi businesses in Mongolia called City Taxi, retail store operations under Sapporo name, lottery business, restaurant and night club operations, flour milling and bread making factory Talkh Chikher LLC.

==Political views==
{{BLP sources section|date=August 2017}}
In 2004, Battulga became a Member of Parliament for the first time from [[Bayankhongor Province|Bayankhongor province]]. He was re-elected to parliament in 2008 and 2012.

Battulga believes that every Mongolian citizen should benefit from its mineral wealth according to article 6.1 of the [[Constitution of Mongolia]], under which mineral resources are to be developed in consideration of ensuring the nation's economic security and the development of all forms of property and social development of the population. Due to landlocked geography of Mongolia, Battulga views that a unified railway network would enhance the global competitiveness of its national mining industry by creating multiple access points through which the country can target multiple inland and seaborne markets. Furthermore, Battulga believes, given the cyclical nature of commodity markets, industrial clusters designed to do value-add processing of mineral products should be established to create skilled jobs, introduce downstream industrial technologies and diversify the economy, enhancing local purchasing power that would create economic multiplier effect in housing, services and other economic sectors. Battulga thinks that agriculture has a prominent place in diversifying the economy as Mongolia is rich in livestock, about 60 million, with largest consumers of agricultural products as its neighbors. He believes cashmere and leather products could be successfully marketed internationally because of the scarcity factor.

Recognizing these principles, Battulga sponsored the State Policy of Railway Transportation of Mongolia (“Railway Policy”) with the Parliament approving it with 84% votes in 24 June 2010 to construct 5,600&amp;nbsp;km railway base infrastructure in three phases that calls for providing access to multiple seaports in China and Russia, creating three transportation corridors between China, Russia and Europe, as well as establishing and industrial cluster in Sainshand.

Battulga acknowledges that limited human resources and financial capability of Mongolia requires multilateral international participation in the development of the economy, rather than making bilateral arrangement with its neighbors. Battulga strongly opposes control of mineral resources by a few politically connected businessmen reaping of great profits and increase income gap between the rich and the poor, potentially creating political and social instability in the country. For example, as the Minister responsible for development of infrastructure and industrial projects, Battulga encouraged participation of international companies in the development of business cases, feasibility and necessary detailed engineering studies, resulting in selection of Bechtel Enterprises, BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, Guggenheim, Fluor, McKinsey &amp; Company, Nippon Koei, Pillsbury Winthrop Pittman Shaw LLP, Samsung, Sidley Austin LLP, Taylor Wessing. As a result, many international companies have expressed their interest to invest, provide technologies and construction services, such as Air Liquide (France), Baotou Steel (China), Dandong Port (China), Overseas Infrastructure Alliance (India), OAO Russian Railways (Russia), Rao UES (Russia), Sembcorp (Singapore), Sinohydro (China), Steel Authority of India Limited (India), among many others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.eagle.mn/content/read/37605.htm “Stories Behind Imprisonments”] by G.Mongon, Eagle.com, 27 November 2015,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://talkh-chikher.mn/#page-home Corporate website Talkh Chikher LLC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/education/edurights/media/docs/6a6a23469e136afaa4860bf5869f6f8f659c6688.pdf Constitution of Mongolia, Article 5.4], 13 January 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 November 2012, the Government of Mongolia announced that it resolved to build 1,800&amp;nbsp;km railway infrastructure integrating Phase 1 and 2 of the Railway Policy. Stakeholders such as Hong Kong listed Mongolian Mining Corporation greeted such government policy in its press release stating that the policy is particularly beneficial for Mongolian coal exporters.

Battulga was instrumental in background coordination for preparation work and ultimate signing of a Memorandum of Cooperation between Governments of Mongolia and Japan during official visit of Prime Minister [[Shinzo Abe]] in 22 October 2015. This memorandum expresses intention of Japan to invest in the construction of railway infrastructure from Tavan Tolgoi coal mine to Sainshand railway line connecting it to the Trans-Mongolian Railway Network and providing access to Chinese and Russian seaports. Furthermore, plans have been made for Chinese, Russian and Japanese investments in financing the railway in exchange of coking coal sourcing from Mongolia. Investment blueprint and roadmap was agreed with the Japanese government, Japan Bank for International Cooperation and Japanese major trading companies.

[[File:Vladimir Putin and Khaltmaagiin Battulga (2017-09-07) 01.jpg|thumb|[[Vladimir Putin]] and Battulga Khaltmaa in [[Vladivostok]]]]

Battulga believes foreign direct investment on balanced terms is an important catalyzer for Mongolia’s economic development and job creation. His policies has been aimed at enhancing fair, transparent and reciprocal trade.

Battulga criticizes Mongolian economy’s heavy dependence on a single trade partner, thus faces fierce opposition and attacks from shareholders and stakeholders of coal miners.

==Social contributions==
Battulga sponsored construction of Chingis Khan Equestrian Statue near Ulaanbaatar to celebrate national pride. The statue became one of the main tourist attraction sights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/03/world/asia/03genghis.html Genghis Khan Rules Mongolia Again, in a P.R.

Battulga is also the President of Mongolian Judo Association. Under his guidance, Mongolian judoka Tuvshinbayar Naidan became an Olympic Judo Champion in Beijing 2008 and many other successful judokas that have become national heroes. Thanks to these successes judo has become one of the most popular sports in Mongolia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lldc2conference.org/custom-content/uploads/2014/06/8-Mr.-Yo.-Manlaibayar-MRT_Railways_WTO-meeting_eng.pdfLand Locked Countries Conference, Ministry of Roads and Transportation of Mongolia]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmc.mn/admin/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Announcement_on_the_government_of_Mon_eng.pdf Mongolian Mining Corporation, Announcement On The Government Of Mongolia’s Decision On Unified Railway Network Development] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921160313/http://www.mmc.mn/admin/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Announcement_on_the_government_of_Mon_eng.pdf# |date=21 September 2013 }}, 4 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Klaus Schnellenkamp''' (born 24 December 1972 in [[Colonia Dignidad]], [[Chile]])  is an established Chilean author. He gained worldwide fame after his spectacular escape from Colonia Dignidad to [[Germany]] in December 2005.  His book in German ''Geboren im Schatten der Angst; Ich überlebte die Colonia Dignidad. (Born in the shadow of fear; I survived Colonia Dignidad)''  is a not just a dramatic account of his life within Colonia Dignidad and his struggle to survive but also shows the human nature's reaction and astounding creativity when faced with such inhumane and desperate situations.

==His Life==
Klaus Schnellenkamp parents's Kurt Schnellenkamp Nelaimischkies (14 March 1927 - 26 November 2017) and Elisabeth Witthahn Krüger (31 May 1936 - 23 July 2009) were co-founders of Colonia Dignidad.  In 1961 they followed the [[sect]] leader [[Paul Schäfer]] to [[Chile]] in order to found and built up the colony.

Schnellenkamp attended the German [[private school]] within Colonia Dignidad from 1980 to 1990, where he got the highest grades. Contrary to the official regulations, he studied natural and social sciences, in cooperation with the alliance known as AAG (a German-Chilean spin-off of the [[HIAG]]), sponsored by the circle ChilAl[[Rotary International|Rotary]]. This, in combination with his secretly written [[poems]] and [[ballads]], led to repeated punishment and [[social isolation]] within the community.

After graduation Schnellenkamp became active in the [[business management]] of the [[sect]]. In spite of his very rebellious position towards the [[sect]] leadership, Schnellenkamp managed to develop and strengthen his position within Colonia Dignidad. From this position he was able to get a good insight into the intrigues of the group, which presented itself to the outside world as a charitable community. Due to his public criticism of the [[Organized crime|economic criminal activity]] of the [[sect]], Klaus Schnellenkamp became a victim of several murder attempts.

Two years after the escape of the sect leader [[Paul Schäfer]], Schnellenkamp acquired his still missing official [[Lyceum|Chilean higher education entrance qualification]] and subsequently passed the [[University and college admissions|state university entrance examination]]. Afterwards he qualified as a [[Multilingualism|polyglot]] [[graduation|graduate]] in [[managerial economics]] and [[industrial management]].

Since December, 2005 Klaus Schnellenkamp has been living in [[Munich]], Germany. His [[autobiography]], ''Geboren im Schatten der Angst (Born in the Shadow of the Fear)'', appeared in spring 2007 and has attracted the attention of both the German and Chilean public. Since May 2008, he has been working as an [[Independent business|independent]] [[entrepreneur]] in [[Munich]].

A '''Look-Through Company''' (LTC) is a kind of tax structure for [[New Zealand]] companies with limited liability, which allows the company in question to transfer its income and expenditure to its shareholders directly. The LTC has replaced the previously popular [[Loss Attributing Qualifying Company]] and will be a simpler alternative to Limited Partnership; however, this new structure differs in a number of key areas.

== Introduction ==
In May 2010, as part of the [[2010 New Zealand budget]], Loss Attributing Qualifying Companies (LAQCs) were abolished.&lt;ref name="IRD Budget 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/news/2010-05-20-budget-tax-bill-introduced|publisher=[[Inland Revenue Department (New Zealand)|Inland Revenue]]|title=Budget Tax Bill Introduced|date=20 May 2010|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
LAQCs had been popular among property investors.&lt;ref name="IRD changes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ird.govt.nz/technical-tax/legislation/2010/2010-130/2010-130-changes-company/|title=Changes to the qualifying company rules and introduction of look-through company rules|publisher=[[Inland Revenue Department (New Zealand)|Inland Revenue]]|date=28 March 2011|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community Investors anxiously awaited the appearance of any alternative. In December 2010, new legislation was introduced which approved a new type of companies—or rather, a new kind of taxation structure for companies in the vein of the old LAQCs. These were to be called Look-Through Companies. The draft law was published yet on 15 October 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diana Clement: Time for landlords to confront tax change|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10682398|publisher=[[New Zealand Herald]]|date=23 October 2010|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and successfully passed one and a half months later. This latest LTC legislation went into effect on 1 April 2011

== Features ==

A Look-Through Company is the same as the traditional limited liability company, established in accordance with the New Zealand Companies Act of 1993; However, the laws differ regarding the taxation of the company's income. An LTC is unlike a typical company in that the income and expenditure of the company are expressly in the hands of the shareholders. In fiscal terms, this creates a transparent mechanism that is identical to the New Zealand [[limited partnership]]. In notable contrast to the former rules regarding LAQCs, LTC shareholders have an obligation to pay taxes on the profit of the company personally, as well as being able to claim losses generated by the company against their other income for tax purposes.

* An LTC is a legal entity under the usual rules of management and operation of companies of limited liability.
* In the realm of taxation, LTC is more transparent and the owner(s) of an LTC will be considered the owner(s) of the company's assets in order to calculate income tax.
* Income, expenses, tax credits, deductions, gains and losses of the company are transferred to its owners in proportion to their share in the company.

To obtain the status of the LTC, a company must meet the following criteria:

* A company which resides (tax-wise) in New Zealand; this residency is determined by the location of the company itself and not its shareholders.
* The company's shares can only belong to individuals or managers of a trust, or other Look-through company, to be shares of the same class and to give equal rights to all shareholders.
* The number of shareholders of such company shall not exceed five shareholders.&lt;ref name="IRD changes" /&gt;

Income from LTCs is taxed after deducting the expenses of the company. The share of these revenues and expenses is transferred to shareholders according to their share in the company. Earnings from the company are taxed at the personal tax rate, even if it is more or less than the standard income tax rate for New Zealand companies. This is a significant point of difference with the LAQC.&lt;ref name="IRD changes" /&gt; The rule limits the amount of damages similar to those that apply to limited liability companies. Owners can take into account only the economically justified costs. Losses that can not be claimed in the current period can be extended to subsequent years (periods), but only within the amount of participation of the shareholder. LTCs deliver declarations showing the distribution of income and expenses to shareholders.

== Comparison with LAQCs and Limited Partnerships ==

Unlike with LAQCs, with this kind of tax structure shareholders can claim damages only on a scale proportionate to that individual's share in the company. However, losses in both types of companies may be carried over to subsequent periods: if the amount of damages the company passed to a shareholder who exceeds the amount of participation in the company, this difference carries over to next year. Shareholders of now-defunct LAQCs may elect to conduct a transition into an LTC. 

Unlike a limited partnership (LP), all shareholders have equal rights, but their number is limited to five. Also, in partnership, general financial entities may also participate, while in LTC stockholders may only be natural persons or administering trusts. The general principles of LPs and LTCs are similar in the sense that the costs and revenues of both entities are transferred to shareholders. Nevertheless, the Limited Partnership has more complex tax rules and reporting, and there is no possibility to transfer losses to future periods.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16107">'''Macromarketing''' is an interdisciplinary field that studies [[marketing]] and how societies make business decisions. It focuses on overall [[consumer behavior]], [[Market (economics)|market]] [[regulation]], and [[social responsibility]]. By comparison, "micromarketing" deals with how firms decide what to make, how to market it, and how much to price it.&lt;ref name="mello"&gt;{{cite news |last1 =Mello|first1=James|title=Micro Marketing VS Macro Marketing – Understanding the Differences|url=https://product2market.walkme.com/micro-marketing-vs-macro-marketing-understanding-differences |accessdate=8 February 2018|work=Product2Market|date=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topics include the [[tragedy of the commons]], [[Subliminal stimuli|subliminal]] [[advertising]], and [[environmental sustainability]].

==History ==

The term "macromarketing" was first used in 1962 by Robert Bartels in ''The Development of Marketing Thought'', in which he "forecast future marketing developments, such as increasing [[Conceptualization (information science)|conceptualization]], more [[Comparative research|comparative study]], more interdisciplinary research, and a 'new concept of macro-marketing'".&lt;ref name="dev1962"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Bartels|title=The Development of Marketing Thought|date=1962|page = 218|publisher=Richard D. Irwin|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Development_of_Marketing_Thought.html?id=vn-wAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fifteen years later, he and Jenkins published their seminal 1977 article in the ''[[Journal of Marketing]]'', where they wrote:&lt;ref name="bartels"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Robert Bartels| author2= Roger L. Jenkins|title=Macromarketing|journal=Journal of Marketing|date=October 1977|volume=41|issue=4|pages=17–20|doi =10.2307/1250229 |url= https://archive.ama.org/archive/ResourceLibrary/JournalofMarketing/documents/4996132.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Macromarketing has meant the marketing process in its entirety, and the aggregate mechanism of [[institution]]s performing it. It has meant systems and groups of micro institutions, such as [[Marketing channel|channels]], [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]], industries, and associations, in contrast to their individual component units. More recently, it has meant the social context of micromarketing, its role in the national economy, and its application to the marketing of noneconomic [[goods]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The article won the ''Journal of Marketing'''s Harold H. Maynard Award for its "contribution to marketing thought and theory".&lt;ref name="historyof"&gt;{{cite journal| author1= Eric H. Shaw|author2=Robert D. Tamilia |title=Robert Bartels and the History of Marketing Thought|journal=Journal of Macromarketing| date= December 2001|volume=21|issue=2|pages=156–163|doi= 10.1177/0276146701212006 |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.391.6452&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Macromarketing Society, "an international group of scholars" that studies "matters related to the varied interactions among markets, marketing, and society", was founded in the 1970s. In 1976, Charles Slater organized the first Macro-Marketing Seminar at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], which was followed by subsequent seminars from 1977 to 1979. In 1978, the Macro-Marketing Editorial Advisory Board was formed to come up with a policy for the ''Journal of Macromarketing''. On August 9, 1979, the Advisory Board met again in [[Boulder, Colorado]], and the Macromarketing Society came to be.&lt;ref name="founding"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hunt|first1=Shelby D.|title=On the Founding of the ''Journal of Macromarketing''|journal=Journal of Macromarketing|date=2011|volume=31|issue=2|pages=199–214|doi=10.1177/0276146710383283|url=http://sdh.ba.ttu.edu/JMacro%20On%20the%20Founding%20of%20final.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

Macromarketing models are [[normative]] constructs, and the discipline that reflects society's value judgments and takes a stance on "how the general marketing process should be conducted in the best interests of society".&lt;ref name="bartels"/&gt; Some scholars argued that "improving our knowledge of marketing" was a sort of "social process of [[resource mobilization]] that, among other things, focuses on an understanding of processes of social learning, adoption, and innovation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Robert V. Kozinets|author2=Andrea Hemetsberger|author3=Hope Jensen Schau|title=The Wisdom of Consumer Crowds: Collective Innovation in the Age of Networked Marketing|journal=Journal of Macromarketing|date=December 2008|volume=28|issue=4|pages=339–354|doi=10.1177/0276146708325382|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, some scholars worried that it was falling out of the spotlight, perhaps because the field was seen as "the conscience of marketing practice", which was less appealing in an academia that values "objectivity and scientific enquiry".&lt;ref name="future"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Roger A.

===Examples===
Macromarketing may be a fairly recent term, but the ideas and interests that it comprises have existed as long as human history. For example, ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'' by [[Thucydides]], the [[Magna Carta]], and ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo]]'' are works that embody macromarketing themes. Macromarketing practice moreover is perhaps as old as society itself. Societies emerged for the welfare of the group; the need for [[Division of labour|specialization]] and then exchanges of items produced by specialists surely was evident early on. Greater specialization and support for it begat [[trade]], and eventually [[Market (economics)|markets]]—which linked many systems in any given society, from production to consumption—were an efficient mechanism to sustain a society, which, fundamentally is a series of institutions and systems agreed upon by the members of the group. For example, even ancient markets like the [[agora]] in [[History of Athens|Athens]] or a [[bazaar]] in [[History of Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]] would have been built on systemic organization and coordination, bringing people together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John McMillan|title=Reinventing the Bazaar: A Natural History of Markets|date=2002|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York|isbn=0-393-05021-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F4r6uL2HqSMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern macromarketing literature on contemporary society may discuss topics like [[Subliminal stimuli|subliminal]] [[advertising]], [[Sustainable packaging|environmentally friendly packaging]], and [[transgender]] [[consumers]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Articles in the ''Journal of Macromarketing'' were about marketing ethics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Shelby D.

==The Macromarketing Society ==

The Macromarketing Society has held an Annual Macromarketing Conference since 1976 and has published the quarterly ''Journal of Macromarketing'' since 1981. It also liaises with organizations, governments, universities, and nonprofits that share an interest in macromarketing.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Clifford Shultz II|title=President’s Welcome|url=http://society.macromarketing.org/about |website=The Macromarketing Society|accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society is based on five pillars that "deeply matter" and affect everyone around the world:&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;
* [[Market (economics)|Markets]], [[marketing]], and [[society]] are part of a global network that determines human [[welfare]], the [[economy]], [[politics]], and [[environment (systems)|environment]]
* [[Market economy|Market]] are especially influential; [[free market]]s are very advantageous but regulation is oftentimes necessary to uphold values like [[justice]] and [[sustainability]]
* [[Marketing]] as a discipline plays a key societal role by facilitating [[Trade|exchange]] and [[Co-creation|co-creating]] [[Creating shared value|value]]
* The overarching macromarketing system shapes [[Quality of life|quality of life]], [[well-being]], [[environmental sustainability]], and [[Society|societal]] [[flourishing]]
* [[Political ideologies]], [[normative ethics]], [[technology]], [[geography]], and [[culture]] are embedded in every level of marketing

A more prescribed macromarketing concept seems to have emerged between the late 1950s and mid-1960s (e.g., Holloway and Hancock, 1964; Grether and Holloway, 1967; Slater, 1968). Fisk’s (1967) text on Marketing Systems presented a detailed macrosystems perspective, including chapters on Evolution of Marketing Systems (historical analysis), Characteristics of Marketing Systems (Micro and Macro system characteristics), [[Resource Allocation]] by [[Competition (economics)|Competition]] and the Expanding Role of [[Government]] (aggregate system constraints), and Social Performance of Marketing and Comparative Marketing.

==Childhood and family==
Avni's family moved to Israel from [[Connecticut]] in the United States in 1984.  His father, Richard Lakin, was a civil rights advocate and school principal in Waterbury, Connecticut before the family moved to Israel.&lt;ref name="CoexistenceSlain"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jewish advocate of coexistence slain|url=https://search.proquest.com/news/docview/1727826318/fulltext/BD79228285634A4CPQ/15?accountid=10226|accessdate=10 May 2018|agency=AP|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RudorenBus"/&gt; He was one of the [[Freedom Riders]] who marched with the Rev. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]].&lt;ref name="CoexistenceSlain"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LazaroffMurder"/&gt;  After moving to Israel, Lakin taught English to mixed classes of Arabs and Jews.&lt;ref name="CoexistenceSlain"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LazaroffMurder"/&gt; Avni's mother is Karen Lakin.&lt;ref name="RudorenBus"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rudoren|first1=Jodi|title=Death Came on the No. 78 Bus|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/world/middleeast/champion-of-coexistence-felled-by-its-failure-is-buried-in-israel.html|accessdate=10 May 2018|publisher=New York Times|date=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avni chose to Hebraize his surname.&lt;ref name="RudorenBus"/&gt; Avni studied at the American School in Kfar Shmaryahu and later served in the IDF as a combat soldier and commander in the Golani Brigade. After his military service, he received his LL.B. from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem where he studied from 1992-1995. A few years later, between 2002-2004, Avni continued his studies and completed his MBA in a joint program between Tel Aviv University and the Kellogg School of Business at Northwestern University in Chicago (Kellogg-Recanati Program). 

Avni is married to Rita Avni, founder and CEO of one of Israel’s leading forensic accountant firms, Avni Advisory Services. Together they are parents to two daughters as well as two sons from previous marriages. The family lives in Tel Aviv.

==Career==
Avni is a member of the Israeli Bar Association since 1996, the same year he began working as an attorney at Yigal Arnon &amp; Co. From 2000-2004, he became a General Partner at Jerusalem Global Ventures, an Israel-based venture capital fund. As of 2018, Avni is a member on the board of directors at Charge After. He previously served as a director at Kashya (acquired by EMC) and the advisory board of Fundbox. He also serves as Chairman of the Association of Credit Companies in Israel.

In 2004, Avni founded a private company named Peninsula and serves as its CEO&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.themarker.com/markets/1.2811394|title=ה"פרייווט אקוויטי" של פנינסולה: גייסה 322 מיליון שקל – ותקים קרן לעסקים קטנים ובינוניים|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Peninsula provides credit to growing small and medium-sized Israeli businesses that advance Israeli industries. The company’s shares are divided between the investment firm Meitav Dash (52%), Micah Lakin Avni (16.35%), Migdal Insurance Company Ltd. (8.66%) and the public. In December 2014, Peninsula began to be traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.calcalist.co.il/markets/articles/0,7340,L-3711070,00.html|title=הנפקת אג"ח ראשונה מוצלחת לפנינסולה: ביקושים בהיקף של 740 מיליון שקל|date=5 April 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Peninsula is rated “A” by S&amp;P Maalot. 

Peninsula expanded and also established investment private equity fund. In December 2015, the company won a bid of ILS 450 million to the Ministry of Economy for the establishment and management of an investment fund for long-term growth of medium-sized businesses &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1001125818#utm_source=social&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=facebook|title="לא כלכלי לבנקים לעשות את מה שאנחנו מתכוונים לעשות"|date=20 May 2016|website=גלובס}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In August 2017, another fund was launched called “The Peninsula Fund for 100+ Businesses” scaled at about ILS 200 million &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.themarker.com/markets/1.4346928|title=פנינסולה מרחיבה את פעילות המימון: תפנה 200 מיליון שקל למתן הלוואות לטווח בינוני|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In September 2012, Avni wrote an article published in the “Calcalist” journal which discussed limiting the use of cash. This prompted a discussion that appointed the “Locker Committee” to reduce the use of cash &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.calcalist.co.il/local/articles/0,7340,L-3583541,00.html|title=די לשימוש במזומן|date=28 September 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The committee’s conclusions turned into a bill which was adopted into law by the Israeli parliament in 2018 and will go into effect at the beginning of 2019&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-5162907,00.html|title=סופית: יוגבל השימוש במזומן החל מ-2019|first=אליצפן|last=רוזנברג|date=13 March 2018|publisher=|via=Ynet}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In each of the years 2015, 2016 and 2018 Avni was elected to the list of The Marker’s 100 Most Influential People in Israel following his involvement in opening the credit market to free competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.themarker.com/magazine/1.2722456|title=רשימת 100 המשפיעים ל-2015 נחשפת: "חבורת הגז" וראש הממשלה נתניהו - בראש|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.themarker.com/st/c/prod/tm/2016/influ/3/|title=רשימת 100 המשפיעים לשנת 2016 - מגזין דה מרקר TheMarker|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-terrorism activism==
{{Main|2015 Jerusalem bus attack}}
Avni's father, Richard Lakin, a retired elementary school principal and a peace activist, was stabbed in the face and chest and shot in the head by Palestinian attackers while riding the #78 bus in Jerusalem  during the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict (2015–2016)|wave of Palestinian terrorism]] in October, 2015.&lt;ref name="RudorenBus"/&gt;

After his father’s death, Avni published an opinion piece in The New York Times in November 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/03/opinion/the-facebook-intifada.html|title=Opinion - The Facebook Intifada|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that raised public debate on the issue of social media incitement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.walla.co.il/item/2897119|title="עשרת הדיברות של השהיד": הפוסט של המחבל מפיגוע האוטובוס - וואלה! חדשות|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Due to the increased amount of activities related to the subject, Avni established a movement against incitement on social media titled “Stop Incitement” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G7d-yDf_ms|title="Social Media Killed My Father"|first=|last=Arutz Sheva TV|date=27 October 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and initiated “Lakin’s Law” at the same year. The law proposes regulation of Facebook in Israel in cases of posts that encourage incitement. Avni gave two speeches at the United Nations and interviewed on CNN about it as well as met with the US Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-K5njzBNPk|title=CNN Micah Avni   24 11 15|first=|last=Micah Avni|date=13 April 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In March, 2016, Avni spoke for the first time before the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] in Geneva, urging them, and [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] to condemn the murder of a civilian on a bus in Israel as an act of terrorism, calling the failure of the [[United Nations]] and the Secretary-General to do so an act of "hypocrisy."&lt;ref name="LazaroffMurder"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lazaroff|first1=Tovah|last2=Harov|first2=Lahav|title=Terror victim's son calls on Human Rights Council to condemn dad's murder|url=https://search.proquest.com/news/docview/1775948672/BD79228285634A4CPQ/18?accountid=10226|accessdate=10 May 2018|publisher=Jerusalem Post|date=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“Killing civilians on a bus is terror. I challenge you to specifically condemn the murder of my father, Richard Lakin”, Avni stated when appearing before the UN and Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon, who visited following the murder in Armon Hanatziv. His second appearance occurred on 09.12.2016 when a closed discussion was held on the cessation of incitement that encourages terrorist activity &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g54MY1CqAFM|title=Micah Avni @ UN: Stop incitement to terror - at the UN. Dec. 9, 2016.|first=|last=eyeontheun|date=16 December 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Avni said: “extreme terrorist organizations use social networks to incite and encourage young people around the world to join them”, calling the phenomenon, “open source jihad.” He said social media networks incited Baha ‘Alian, his father’s murderer, who was later described as a shahid on Facebook. Avni called on the UN “to condemn the Chairman of the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian Authority for creating a culture of hatred and an ecosystem of incitement to terror, and demand that the Chairman of the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian Authority stop poisoning the minds of innocent Palestinian children against peace.”

In the wake of his father's murder, Avni became a lead plaintiff in the [[Shurat HaDin#2015 Facebook lawsuit]] filed in a New York state court by 2,000 Israeli victims of Palestinian terror attack against Facebook on the grounds that the social media company permitted the posting of "incitement to murder and the glorification of violence against innocent civilians."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/When-it-comes-to-incitement-is-Facebook-biased-against-Israel-439436|title=When it comes to incitement, is Facebook biased against Israel?|website=The Jerusalem Post {{!}} JPost.com|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YonahPowerhouse"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yonah|first1=jeremy Bob|title=Terrorism cases against Facebook reach climax.

In total, Avni filed two civil suits against Facebook&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/facebook-sued-after-richard-lakin-killed-hamas-terrorists-n609881|title=Facebook Should Pay After Terrorists Killed My Dad: Son|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. One of the suits totaled one billion dollars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yediot.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4916843,00.html|title=שלטון של כאוס|date=3 February 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. At 2017 Avni was involved in efforts to expose the phenomenon of videos on YouTube that encourage terrorism &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4921563,00.html|title=כך מממנים תאגידי ענק ארגוני טרור דרך יוטיוב|first=רועי|last=ינובסקי|date=13 February 2017|publisher=|via=Ynet}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are funded by advertisements of international corporations. Following investigation and publication on the topic by the British Times, there has been a decrease in the number of videos on social media networks that encourage incitement, violence, and racism as well as the removal of Hamas and its leaders’ social media accounts &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/big-brands-fund-terror-knnxfgb98|title=Big brands fund terror through online adverts|first=Alexi Mostrous|last=Head of Investigations|date=9 February 2017|publisher=|via=www.thetimes.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In March 2018 Avni appeared again in front of the UN Human Rights Council where he said: “The Palestinian Authority actually has a pay-to-play law. Palestinians systematically pay terrorists to murder Jews". Members of this council, what if I were to pay 300 million dollars to have all of your fathers butchered, would you report on that?”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/International/What-if-I-paid-to-butcher-your-fathers-terrorism-victim-asks-UNHRC-546539|title='What if I paid to butcher your fathers?' terrorism victim asks UNHRC|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2018, Avni also serves as the Chairman of  Concert – Together for Israel (previously known as “Kela Shlomo,” a public-private partnership established to combat the delegitimization of the State of Israel and the BDS movement &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yediot.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-5066177,00.html|title=הבן השכול שיילחם בארגון החרם נגד ישראל|date=4 January 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/bds-is-a-dirty-business-those-who-battle-it-on-israels-behalf-must-stay-clean/|title=BDS is a dirty business.

The '''motorsport industry''' is the range of [[engineering]] and service businesses that support the sporting discipline of [[motorsport]]s.

In motorsports, a competitors' success is intimately linked with the performance of his or her equipment - in this case a [[vehicle]]. The role of engineering in delivering on-track success has led to the formation of a considerable global [[industry]] which supplies motorsport competitors with the equipment necessary to participate in the sport.

==The industry==
The motorsport industry designs, develops and manufactures [[prototypes]] including [[chassis]], materials, [[electronics]], [[engines]], [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmissions]], [[brakes]], [[telemetry]] and suspension components. The industry relies upon the skills of competitive engineers who, season after season, incrementally improve components to deliver identifiable advantage and ongoing success on the race track. ''Competitive Engineering'' is the centerpiece of these internationally-trading small businesses. Motorsport businesses have developed a unique ability to use sporting endeavour and entertainment as a catalyst for engineering and [[manufacturing]] advances - advances subsequently of real value to other High Performance Engineering (HPE) customer groups – Defence, Marine, Aerospace and [[Automotive]].

== The Motorsport Industry Association (MIA) ==
The Motorsport Industry Association (MIA) is the world's leading trade association for the motorsport, performance engineering, services and tuning sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = MIA Profile|url = http://the-mia.com/About-the-MIA/MIA-Profile|website = the-mia.com|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MIA represents the specialised needs of this highly successful global industry as it undergoes continuing rapid development throughout the world.

In April 1994, leading personalities in British motorsport joined forces to form their own trade association - the MIA - with the aim of promoting one of the UK's most successful industries - motorsport. The original concept was proposed by Founder and original CEO, Brian Sims, with the first Executive Committee comprising Rob Baldock (Accenture); Dick Scammel (Cosworth);Tony Schulp (Haymarket); John Kirkpatrick (Jim Russell Racing Drivers School); Tony Panaro (Euro Northern Travel) and Tony Fletcher (Premier Fuels).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = MIA Profile|url = http://the-mia.com/About-the-MIA/MIA-Profile|website = the-mia.com|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MIA represents its members from motorsport, high performance engineering and tuning companies; race and rally teams; governing bodies; motorsport services; research organisations; race circuits; Universities and colleges - amongst many others. The MIA enjoys membership of the [http://the-mia.com/About-the-MIA/Confederation-of-British-Industry-Member-Benefit Confederation of British Industry (CBI)], in turn providing members access to the UK's “Voice of Industry”.{{Industries}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45010">'''Nielsen ratings''' are the [[audience measurement]] systems operated by [[Nielsen Media Research]] that seek to determine the [[audience]] size and composition of [[broadcast programming|television programming]] in the United States using a rating system.

Nielsen Media Research was founded by [[Arthur Nielsen|Arthur C. Nielsen]], a market analyst whose career had begun in the 1920s with brand advertising analysis and had expanded into radio market analysis during the 1930s, culminating in Nielsen ratings of radio programming, which was meant to provide statistics as to the markets of radio shows. The first Nielsen ratings for radio programs were released the first week of December 1947. They measured the top 20 programs in four areas: total audience, average audience, cumulative audience and homes per dollar spent for time and talent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top 20 Network Shows, Rated 4 Ways, Announced by Nielsen|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1947/1947-12-08-BC.pdf|periodical=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable|Broadcasting-Telecasting]]|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|date=December 8, 1947|accessdate=October 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, Nielsen moved to television, developing a ratings system using the methods he and his company had developed for radio. That method became the primary source of audience measurement information in the television industry.

==Measuring ratings==
Nielsen television ratings are gathered in one of two ways:
# Viewer "diaries," in which a target audience self-records its viewing or listening habits. By targeting various [[demographics]], the assembled statistical models provide a rendering of the audiences of any given show, network, and programming hour.
# A more technologically sophisticated system uses Set Meters, which are small devices connected to televisions in selected homes. These devices gather the viewing [[Habit (psychology)|habits]] of the home and transmit the information nightly to Nielsen through a "Home Unit" connected to a phone line. The technology-based home unit system is meant to allow market researchers to study television viewing habits on a minute to minute basis, seeing the exact moment viewers change channels or turn off their television set. In addition to set meters, individual viewer reporting devices, such as [[people meter]]s, have allowed the company to separate household viewing information into various demographic groups.

Changing systems of viewing have impacted Nielsen's methods of market research. In 2005, Nielsen began measuring the usage of [[digital video recorder|digital video recording devices]] such as [[TiVo]]s. Initial results indicated that time-shifted viewing will have a significant impact on television ratings. A year later, the networks were not yet figuring these new results into their ad rates because of the resistance of advertisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Playback time for Nielsens|author=Gary Levin|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|page=1D|date=October 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since about October 2017, Nielsen has also begun to track select programs from specific partners that air on subscription-based [[video on demand]] (SVOD) services like [[Netflix]]. Partnering distributors insert a "tag" into the program to be distributed on these services which Nielsen can track without input from Netflix. Partnering distributors are able to determine if these ratings can be released publicly or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/nielsen-measurement-netflix-1202592985/ | title = Nielsen Says It Will Measure Audiences for TV Episodes That Stream Via Netflix | first=  Brian  | last = Steinberg | date = October 18, 2017 | accessdate = February 19, 2018 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ratings/share and total viewers===
The most commonly cited Nielsen results are reported in two measurements: ratings points and share, usually reported as: "ratings points/share." There are 119.6&amp;nbsp;million TV homes in the U.S. for the 2017-18 TV season (Nielsen’s National Television Household Universe Estimates).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2017/nielsen-estimates-119-6-million-us-tv-homes-2017-2018-tv-season.html | title=Nielsen Estimates 119.6 Million TV Homes in the U.S. for the 2017-18 TV Season | accessdate=2017-11-05 | date=2017-08-25 | publisher=[[Nielsen Media Research|The Nielsen Company]] | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107032542/http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2017/nielsen-estimates-119-6-million-us-tv-homes-2017-2018-tv-season.html | archivedate=2017-11-07 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of persons age 2 and older in U.S. TV Households is estimated to be 304.5&amp;nbsp;million. A single national ratings point represents 1% of the total number. Nielsen re-estimates the number of television-equipped households each August for the upcoming television season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nielsen Media Research’s Glossary of Media Terms.|at=Glossary Search ''Rating'' / ''Ratings Point''|url=http://www.nielsenmedia.com/glossary/index.htm|author=[[Nielsen Media Research]]|accessdate=November 19, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713105550/http://www.nielsenmedia.com/glossary/index.htm|archivedate=July 13, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Share is the percentage of television sets in use that are tuned to the program of Households Using Television (HUT) or Persons Using Television (PUT) who are tuned to a specific program, station or network in a specific area at a specific time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nielsen Media Research’s Glossary of Media Terms.|at=Glossary Search ''Share''|url=http://www.nielsenmedia.com/glossary/index.htm|author=[[Nielsen Media Research]]|accessdate=November 27, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713105550/http://www.nielsenmedia.com/glossary/index.htm|archivedate=July 13, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a RATING|url=http://www.frankwbaker.com/ratingshare.htm|author=Frank Baker|work=Media Literacy Clearinghouse|date=February 12, 2009|accessdate=December 8, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513175054/http://www.frankwbaker.com/ratingshare.htm|archivedate=May 13, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Nielsen may report a show as receiving a 4.4/8 during its broadcast; this would mean that out of all television-equipped households (that is to say homes with a TV set, not total number of people), 4.4% were tuned in to that program, while among those households watching TV at the time 8% of them watched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Nielsen Ratings. |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/ratings.aspx?id=ratings_faq |author=The Futon Critic Staff (TFC) |date=2010-09-19 |accessdate=December 8, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170905133327/http://www.thefutoncritic.com/ratings.aspx?id=ratings_faq |archivedate=September 5, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because ratings are based on samples, it is possible for shows to get a 0.0 rating, despite having an audience; the [[CNBC]] talk show ''[[McEnroe (TV series)|McEnroe]]'' was one notable example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Where's the Love? CNBC Scrambles to Woo Viewers for 'McEnroe'|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A61516-2004Aug12.html|author=Lisa de Moraes|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Graham Holdings Company|The Washington Post Company]]|date=August 13, 2004|accessdate=December 8, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170721070725/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A61516-2004Aug12.html|archivedate=July 21, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is [[The CW]] show, ''[[CW Now]]'', which received two 0.0 ratings in the same season. In 2014, Nielsen reported that American viewership of live television (totaling on average four hours and 32 minutes per day) had dropped 12 minutes per day compared to the year before. Nielsen reported several reasons for the shift away from live television: increased viewership of time-shifted television (mainly through DVRs) and viewership of internet video (clips from video sharing websites and streams of full-length television shows).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nielsen trends: Total audience measurement|url=http://money.cnn.com/2014/12/03/media/nielsen-trends-total-audience-measurement/index.html?section=money_media|website=[[CNN Money]]|date=December 8, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304104355/http://money.cnn.com/2014/12/03/media/nielsen-trends-total-audience-measurement/index.html?section=money_media|archivedate=March 4, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|RatingDemographics}}

===Demographics===
Nielsen Media Research also provides statistics on specific demographics as advertising rates are influenced by such factors as age, gender, race, economic class, and area. Younger viewers are considered more attractive for many products, whereas in some cases older and wealthier audiences are desired, or female audiences are desired over males.

In general, the number of viewers within the 18–49 age range is more important than the total number of viewers.&lt;ref name=demos&gt;{{cite news|title=THE TV COLUMN: Not in 18–49 age group?

===Commercial ratings===
Nielsen also provides viewership data calculated as the average viewership for only the commercial time within the program. These "Commercial Ratings" first became available on May 31, 2007. Additionally, Nielsen provides different "streams" of this data in order to take into consideration delayed viewing (DVR) data, at any interval up to seven days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nielsen Announces Schedule And Plan For Commercial-Minute Ratings |url=http://www.nielsenmedia.com/nc/portal/site/Public/menuitem.55dc65b4a7d5adff3f65936147a062a0/?allRmCB=on&amp;newSearch=yes&amp;vgnextoid=264b66f7e2c20110VgnVCM100000ac0a260aRCRD&amp;searchBox=media |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828102623/http://www.nielsenmedia.com/nc/portal/site/Public/menuitem.55dc65b4a7d5adff3f65936147a062a0/?allRmCB=on&amp;newSearch=yes&amp;vgnextoid=264b66f7e2c20110VgnVCM100000ac0a260aRCRD&amp;searchBox=media |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 28, 2007 |author=Gary Holmeys |website=Nielsen Media Research |date=January 16, 2006 |accessdate=July 2, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; C3 was the metric launched in 2007, and refers to the ratings for average commercial minutes in live programming plus total playback by digital video recorder out to three days after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commercial Ratings Shuffle the Deck|url=http://www.tvweek.com/news/2007/10/commercial_ratings_shuffle_the.php|author=Jon Lafayette|periodical=Television Week|date=October 7, 2007|accessdate=May 13, 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417025917/http://www.tvweek.com/news/2007/10/commercial_ratings_shuffle_the.php|archivedate=April 17, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2012, some television executives wanted to see C7, ratings for live plus seven days, with [[CBS Corporation]] [[chief executive officer]] [[Les Moonves]] making the claim C7 made ratings increase by 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=C3POh No!

===Sweeps===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Academy Award]] --&gt;
{{Redirect|Sweeps}}
The American television measurement by Nielsen is based on three different methodological approaches. In the 25 TV markets with the highest sales (e. g. New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver) the Local People Meter (LPM) is measured. Individuals register individually, the measurement is carried out on 365 days over 24 hours.&lt;ref name=locmeas&gt;{{cite web|title=Local Measurement: Methodology. LPM, SET-Meter, Diary only.|url=http://en-us.nielsen.com/sitelets/cls/documents/nielsen/Local-Measurement-Methodology-Ex.pdf|publisher=Nielsen – Client Knowledge Service Team|accessdate=December 21, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327180124/http://en-us.nielsen.com/sitelets/cls/documents/nielsen/Local-Measurement-Methodology-Ex.pdf|archivedate=March 27, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SET Meter (Diary &amp; Electronic) is used in 31 smaller markets (such as Nashville, Salt Lake City). In four sweeps in the months of February, May, July and November, target group data are collected with the diary and validated with the data of the devices (TV set on/off) in the participating households.&lt;ref name=locmeas /&gt; In the 154 TV markets with the lowest sales (e. g. Harrisburg, PA or Honolulu) the use of TV is only recorded by means of a diary survey.

Each year, Nielsen processes approximately two million paper diaries from households across the country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Television Measurement &amp;#124; TV Ratings|url=http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/nielsen-solutions/nielsen-measurement/nielsen-tv-measurement.htmlpublisher=Nielsen|accessdate=June 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the months of November, February, May and July—also known as the "sweeps" rating periods.&lt;ref name=bn8614&gt;{{cite news|title=Summertime, when the leaving is easy to figure out|url=http://blogs.buffalonews.com/talkintv/2014/08/summertime-when-the-leaving-is-easy-to-figure-out.html|author=Alan Pergament|newspaper=[[The Buffalo News]]|publisher=[[Berkshire Hathaway|BH Media Group, LLC]]|date=August 6, 2014|accessdate=August 6, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808044901/http://blogs.buffalonews.com/talkintv/2014/08/summertime-when-the-leaving-is-easy-to-figure-out.html|archivedate=August 8, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "sweeps" dates from 1954, when Nielsen collected diaries from households in the [[Eastern United States]] first; from there they would "sweep" west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=For the TV Station Business, Sweeps Stakes Are Still High|periodical=Broadcasting &amp; Cablepublisher=[[NewBay Media]]|page=34|date=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The Nielsen Company |url=http://www.nielsenmedia.com/glossary/terms/S/S.html |title=Nielsen Media Research’s Glossary of Media Terms. |quote=Glossary search for ''Sweeps'' |accessdate=December 23, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141118123110/http://www.nielsenmedia.com/glossary/terms/S/S.html |archivedate=November 18, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven-day diaries (or eight-day diaries in homes with DVRs) are mailed to homes to keep a tally of what is watched on each television set and by whom. Over the course of a sweeps period, diaries are mailed to a new panel of homes each week. At the end of the month, all of the viewing data from the individual weeks is aggregated.

This local viewing information provides a basis for program scheduling and advertising decisions for local television stations, cable systems, and advertisers. Typically, the November, February and May sweeps are considered more important; nevertheless, the July sweeps can have local impact in regard to personnel.&lt;ref name=bn8614/&gt;

In some of the mid-size markets, diaries provide viewer information for up to two additional "sweeps" months (October and January).

===Criticism of ratings systems===
There is some public critique regarding accuracy and potential bias within Nielsen's rating system, including some concerns that the Nielsen ratings system is rapidly becoming outdated because of new technology like [[smartphone]]s, [[Digital video recorder|DVRs]], [[tablet computers]] and [[Internet]] streaming services as preferred or alternative methods for television viewing. In June 2006, however, Nielsen announced a plan to revamp its entire methodology to include all types of media viewing in its sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital TV Prompts Nielsen Ratings Revamp|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/47d9b068-fc0b-11da-b1a1-0000779e2340.html#axzz2t7dWKn7Z|author=Aline van Duynin|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|date=June 15, 2006|accessdate=February 12, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202005442/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/47d9b068-fc0b-11da-b1a1-0000779e2340.html#axzz2t7dWKn7Z|archivedate=December 2, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since viewers are aware of being part of the Nielsen sample, it can lead to [[response bias]] in recording and viewing habits. Audience counts gathered by the self-reporting diary methodology are sometimes higher than those gathered by the electronic meters which eliminate any response bias.

Another criticism of the measuring system itself is that it fails the most important criterion of a sample: it is not random in the statistical sense of the word. A small fraction of the population is selected and only those that actually accept are used as the sample size. In many local areas during the 1990s, the difference between a rating that kept a show on the air and one that would cancel it was so small as to be statistically insignificant, and yet the show that just happened to get the higher rating would survive.&lt;ref name="believe"&gt;{{cite episode|series=[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]] / [[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]|title=Can You Believe TV Ratings?|network=PBS|airdate=February 18, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Nielsen ratings encouraged a strong push for demographic measurements. This caused problems with households that had multiple television sets or households where viewers would enter the simpler codes (usually their child's) raising serious questions to the quality of the demographic data.&lt;ref name="believe"/&gt; The situation further deteriorated as the popularity of cable television expanded the number of viewable networks to the point that the [[margin of error]] has increased, because the sampling sizes are too small.&lt;ref name="believe"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nielsen Ratings: An Inaccurate Truth|url=http://cornellsun.com/node/23180|author=Andrea Segal|newspaper=The Cornell Daily Sun|date=April 26, 2007|accessdate=January 19, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430012300/http://cornellsun.com/node/23180|archivedate=April 30, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Nielsen Ratings Are Inaccurate, and Why They'll Stay That Way|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/01/why-nielsen-ratings-are-inaccurate-and-why-theyll-stay-that-way/|author=John Herrman|website=Splitsider|date=January 31, 2011|accessdate=April 28, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505182637/http://splitsider.com/2011/01/why-nielsen-ratings-are-inaccurate-and-why-theyll-stay-that-way/|archivedate=May 5, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compounding matters is the fact that of the sample data that is collected, advertisers will not pay for [[timeshifting|time shifted]] programs (those that are recorded for replay at a different time),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Networks' top shows at a rating loss|author=Gary Levin|newspaper=USA Today|publisher=Gannett Company|page=1D|date=April 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; rendering the "raw" numbers useless from a statistical point of view. Even in 2013, it was noted that Internet streams of television programs were still not counted because they had either no ads (such as [[Netflix]]) or totally different advertising (such as [[Hulu]]) than their television counterparts, effectively skewing the raw data on how popular a show really is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nielsen Adjusts Its Ratings to Add Web-Linked TVs|author=[[Brian Stelter]]|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=February 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related criticism of the Nielsen ratings system is its lack of a system for measuring television audiences in environments outside the home, such as [[dormitory|college dormitories]], transport terminals, [[Bar (establishment)|bar]]s, [[prison|jail]]s and other public places where television is frequently viewed, often by large numbers of people in a common setting. In 2005, Nielsen announced plans to incorporate viewing by away-from-home college students into its sample. Internet television viewing is another rapidly growing market for which Nielsen ratings fail to account for viewers. [[iTunes]], Hulu, [[YouTube]], and some of the networks' own websites (such as ABC.com and CBS.com) provide full-length web-based programming, either subscription-based or ad-supported. Though web sites can already track popularity of a site and the [[HTTP referrer|referring page]], they cannot track viewer demographics. To both track this and expand their [[market research]] offerings, Nielsen purchased NetRatings in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Briefing: Nielsen to purchase all NetRatings shares|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/02/05/business/techbrief.php|newspaper=[[International New York Times|International Herald Tribune]]|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=February 5, 2007|accessdate=October 10, 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220034301/http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/02/05/business/techbrief.php|archivedate=December 20, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as noted in a February 2012 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article, the computer and mobile streams of a program are counted separately from the standard television broadcasts, further degrading the overall quality of the sampling data. As a result, there was no way for NBC to tell if there was any overlap between the roughly 111.3 million traditional television viewers &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stern.de/news/us-repraesentantenhaus-segnet-trumps-steuerreform-ab-7702224.html|title=US-Repräsentantenhaus segnet Trumps Steuerreform ab|date=16 November 2017|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117181751/https://www.stern.de/news/us-repraesentantenhaus-segnet-trumps-steuerreform-ab-7702224.html|archivedate=17 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/berlin--jamaika-sondierungen-vertagt---keine-einigung-in-sicht-7702436.html|title=Jamaika-Sondierungen gehen in die Verlängerung|website=stern.de|accessdate=16 January 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117112413/https://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/berlin--jamaika-sondierungen-vertagt---keine-einigung-in-sicht-7702436.html|archivedate=17 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2.1 million live stream viewers of [[Super Bowl XLVII]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Youths Are Watching, but Less Often on TV|author=Brian Stelter|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=February 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to the criticism regarding accusations by several media executives (including [[Viacom]] CEO Phillippe Dauman and former [[Fox Entertainment Group]] [[chief operating officer]] [[Chase Carey]]) that it failed to count viewers watching television programs on digital platforms, Nielsen executive vice president of global product leadership Megan Clarken stated in an April 2015 summit by the Coalition for Innovative Media Measurement that the company is able to count digital viewers in audience and demographic reports, but are unable to do so under the current set of rules devised by networks and advertising industries last revised in 2006. As such, Nielsen can only count viewership for television-originated broadcasts, and must exclude viewers who watch programs on digital platforms if the program does not have an identical advertising load or a linear [[watermark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nielsen Says Industry Rules Bar It From Including Digital Viewers In TV Ratings|url=http://deadline.com/2015/04/nielsen-tv-ratings-rules-1201414432/|author=David Lieberman|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=Mail.com Media|date=April 22, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222160728/http://deadline.com/2015/04/nielsen-tv-ratings-rules-1201414432/|archivedate=February 22, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Nielsen took over the contract for producing data on Irish advertising in 2009, agencies said that they were "disastrous" and claimed that the information produced by them is too inaccurate to be trusted by them or their clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Media agencies losing trust in Nielsen for supply of critical data|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/media/media-agencies-losing-trust-in-nielsen-for-supply-of-critical-data-2047454.html|author=Laura Noonan|website=Independent.ie|date=February 4, 2010|accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[News Corporation]] retained the services of [[public relations]] firm Glover Park to launch a campaign aimed at delaying Nielsen's plan to replace its aging household electronic data collection methodology in larger local markets with its newer electronic People Meter system. The advocates in the public relations campaign charged that data derived from the newer People Meter system represented a bias toward underreporting minority viewing, which could lead to a de facto discrimination in employment against minority actors and writers. However, Nielsen countered the campaign by revealing its sample composition counts. According to Nielsen Media Research's sample composition counts, {{As of|2004|alt=as of November 2004}}, nationwide, [[African American]] households using People Meters represented 6.7% of the Nielsen sample, compared to 6.0% in the general population. [[Latino]] households represent 5.7% of the Nielsen sample, compared to 5.0% in the general population. By October 2006, News Corporation and Nielsen settled, with Nielsen agreeing to spend an additional $50 million to ensure that minority viewing was not being underreported by the new electronic people meter system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rupe ends Nielsen tiff|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-154755762.html|author=Michael Learmonth|website=Encyclopedia.com|date=October 26, 2006|accessdate=April 20, 2009}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, CBS and Nielsen proposed a model consisting of six viewer segments which according to their empirical research are more relevant for advertisers than older models based on gender and age. The segments are based on user behavior, motivations, and [[psychographic]]s. It is argued that the model can increase reaching the desired audience as well as message recall and advertisement likeability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CBS: Viewers' Age and Sex Shouldn't Matter to Marketers|url=http://adage.com/article/mediaworks/cbs-viewers-age-sex-matter-marketers/149534/|author=Jack Neff|periodical=Advertising Age|date=March 23, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411223012/http://adage.com/article/mediaworks/cbs-viewers-age-sex-matter-marketers/149534/|archivedate=April 11, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Olivier Lecerf''' (1928 – August 10, 2006) was a French businessman and a [[Thoroughbred]] [[horse racing|racehorse]] owner.

==Business career==
A resident of Paris, from 1974 to 1989 Olivier Lecerf was at the helm of the French-based multinational industrial conglomerate [[Lafarge (company)|Lafarge Group]], serving as its [[CEO]] and [[Chairman]] of the [[Board of Directors]].

He was voted France's 1981 "Manager of the Year" (''{{illm|Manager de l'année (France)|fr}}'') by the French [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]].

Olivier Lecerf was also a member of the [[European Round Table of Industrialists]] (ERT) and an administrator of the global [[cosmetics]] giant [[L'Oréal]] from 1990 to 2004.

In 1991 {{illm|Editions de Fallois|fr}} published Lecerf's book ''Au risque de gagner - Le métier de dirigeant'' ({{ISBN|978-2877061209}}). The book contained his comments and views on being a company leader and the stakes and issues involved.

'''Oloff Hennig''' is a South African businessman, best known for his friendship with [[Ronnie Biggs]], the legendary British train robber. He was also embroiled in a [[tax]] and murder scandal following the death of his [[accountant]].

Oloff is also reputed to have paved the way for South Africa’s rugby legend [[Naas Botha]]’s try-out as goal kicker for the [[Dallas Cowboys]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.citypress.co.za/business/tokyos-guinea-deal-stirs-a-storm-20120623/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax investigation==
Hennig was embroiled in a tax and murder scandal when his accountant Marius van der Westhuizen was convicted of [[fraud]]. Van der Westhuizen was charged with filing false [[tax return]]s and fictitious figures on behalf of Oloff Hennig’s companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.news24.com/dieburger/Suid-Afrika/Nuus/Man-beken-skuldaan-belastingbedrog-20110627 Jan Gerber, "Man beken skuld aan belastingbedrog"], ''News 24'' (28 June 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Van der Westhuizen subsequently committed suicide before a sentencing for his crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/npa-praises-r1m-bail-forfeited-to-state-1505278|title=NPA praises R1m bail forfeited to State {{!}} IOL News|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Links to Ronnie Biggs==
Oloff Hennig was also a close friend of legendary British train robber [[Ronnie Biggs]]. Oloff visited him many times whilst Biggs lived in exile in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Oloff even arranged for South African tourists to meet Biggs in Rio, where he would tell them how his gang conducted the [[Great Train Robbery (1963)]], during which they stole £2.6 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.news24.com/citypress/Business/News/Tokyos-Guinea-deal-stirs-a-storm-20120623 Jacques Dommisse, "Tokyo’s Guinea deal stirs a storm"], ''City Press'' (24 June 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Oloff is the father of [[Walter Hennig]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Joubert|first1=Pearlie|title=Who is Walter Hennig?|url=https://www.pressreader.com/south-africa/sunday-times/20140629/281685432936586|website=pressreader|publisher=Newspaperdirect Inc|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oracle Policy Automation''' (abbreviated '''OPA''') is a suite of [[software]] products for modeling and deploying [[business rules]] within enterprise applications. [[Oracle Corporation]] acquired OPA in December 2008 when it purchased Australian software company RuleBurst Holdings, then trading as Haley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oracle.com/haley/index.html|title=Oracle and Haley - Strategic Acquisitions - Oracle|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oracle Policy Automation was designed by [[RuleBurst]] to transform legislation and policy documents into executable business rules, particularly for the calculation of benefit entitlements and payment amounts. Although OPA was originally developed for and sold to the [[public sector]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sue Bushell |url=http://www.cio.com.au/article/142680/business_rules_boost_centrelink |title=Business Rules Boost to Centrelink |publisher=CIO |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; it can be used in other industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com/eye-on-oracle/oracle-hunts-for-bargains-in-down-economy/ |title=Oracle hunts for bargains in down economy - Eye on Oracle |publisher=Itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com |date=2008-11-04 |accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oracle Policy Automation continues to be available as a standalone offering and an integrated rules solution for SAP and Siebel.

== Features and components ==
'''Oracle Policy Modeling''' is a Windows desktop application for transforming legislation and policy documents into executable business rules. Rules are written in [[Microsoft Word]] and [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] documents using phrases in languages such as [[English language|English]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[French language|French]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/applications/policy-automation/pdf/Oracle%20Policy%20Automation%2010.0%20-%20Features%20and%20Benefits.pdf |title=Oracle Policy Automation on OTN |publisher=Oracle.com |date=2010-09-07 |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rule documents can be shared amongst business and [[information technology]] stakeholders, and commentary can be added into the documents without affecting the structure of the rules themselves. Other features of Oracle Policy Modeling include integrated test case execution and debugging capabilities, and the definition of interviews for interactive rule-based assessments. Interview screen order and branching logic can be defined using visual flow diagrams.

The '''Oracle Policy Automation''' run-time comprises three technologies:
* '''OPA Web Determinations''': An interview application that uses screens, rules and flows defined in Oracle Policy Modeling to deliver [[Internet]]- and [[intranet]]-based interactive assessments. Data entered is used in combination with [[backward chaining]] to determine which screens need to be shown to the user in order to reach a decision.
* '''OPA Determinations Server''': A [[WS-I Basic Profile]] compliant [[SOAP]]-based web service that exposes decision-making endpoints for deployed policy models. By passing data to OPA Determinations Server, and receiving responses in return, enterprises can integrate rule-based decision-making with other applications and [[Business process modeling|BPM]] solutions. Examples include Oracle's [[Siebel]], or [[BPEL]]-orchestrated business processes. If insufficient data is provided to reach a decision, Oracle Determinations Server is able to explain what additional data may be required.
* '''OPA Determinations Engine''': The engine used by both OPA Web Determinations and OPA Determinations Server, it is also available as a native [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[.NET Framework|.NET]] [[API]]. OPA Determinations Engine provides both full [[forward chaining]] and backward chaining capabilities, as well as low-level access to the interview engine.

Both OPA Web Determinations and OPA Determinations Server are supported on a wide variety of application servers, including [[Oracle WebLogic Server]], [[Microsoft IIS]], [[IBM WebSphere Application Server|IBM WebSphere AS]] and [[Apache Tomcat]].

Connectors for enterprise applications such as Oracle's Siebel and [[SAP ERP|SAP]] are also available.

== Versions ==
The product now known as Oracle Policy Automation has been sold under several different names, including Haley Office Rules and RuleBurst.

RuleBurst 7.0 was the successor to STATUTE Expert.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizrules.info/files/BIZRULES.BRE.Family.Tree.2008.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Although customers of STATUTE Expert were able to upgrade to the later versions, RuleBurst 7.0 was the first version of the product that has become known as Oracle Policy Automation today.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oracle.com/support/library/brochure/lifetime-support-applications.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Oracle has released several versions of Oracle Policy Automation (OPA) since it was acquired:

== Applications and academic interest ==
The Oracle Policy Automation software has been publicly deployed within several government web-sites. Australia's Department of Immigration and Citizenship uses it for visitors to check their eligibility for visas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tindal |first=Suzanne |url=http://www.zdnet.com.au/diac-to-unleash-release-this-weekend-339297104.htm |title=DIAC to unleash release this weekend - Software - News |publisher=Zdnet.com.au |date=2009-06-26 |accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK [[HMRC|Revenue and Customs agency]] uses it for their Employment Status Indicator assessment tool;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/oia/oia-esi.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the UK government's old online portal for businesses also used OPA for over 60 interactive tools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://businesslink.gov.uk/tools/ |title=tools |publisher=Business Link |date= |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the United States [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] uses the software for guidance on tax law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasury.gov/about/budget-performance/budget-in-brief/Documents/CJ-IRS.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Oracle Policy Modeling's controlled natural language approach to rule authoring has been the subject of some research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://attempto.ifi.uzh.ch/site/cnl2009/ |title=CNL 2009 |publisher=Attempto.ifi.uzh.ch |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Clarify|date=March 2010}} The product was also used to help establish the viability of the Legal Knowledge Interchange Format&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.estrellaproject.org/lkif-core/ |title=LKIF-Core Ontology: A Commonsense-based Legal Ontology |publisher=Estrellaproject.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; standard developed by the Estrella Project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.estrellaproject.org/?page_id=4 |title=Estrella » Deliverables &amp; Publications |publisher=Estrellaproject.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.estrellaproject.org/doc/4.2%20HALEY.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - VOORBLAD.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RuleBurst acquired the assets of Haley Systems in November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/Acquisitions/Haley/index.html|title=Oracle and Haley - Strategic Acquisitions - Oracle|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the time, RuleBurst and Haley were both marketing "natural language business rules" software and were considered competitors. Prior to being acquired, Haley Systems had licensed its HaleyAuthority rules product to [[Siebel Systems]]. HaleyAuthority was made available in Siebel 8.0 under the name Siebel Business Rules. When RuleBurst acquired Haley, it adopted the better-known Haley name for both its company and product branding. HaleyAuthority then became known as Haley Expert Rules and the RuleBurst product became known as Haley Office Rules.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} When Oracle acquired RuleBurst, Oracle also began jointly marketing OPA with the Siebel CRM solution. The plurality of names has led some commentators {{Who|date=March 2010}} to incorrectly refer to Oracle Policy Automation and Haley products interchangeably as Haley or Haley Rules. However, the two products are separate and distinct offerings.

'''Public consultation''', or simply '''consultation''', is a regulatory process by which the public's input on matters affecting them is sought. Its main goals are in improving the efficiency, transparency&lt;ref name="OECD"&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/4/43/36785341.pdf Background Document on Public Consultation] (from the [[OECD]] Code, 10-Mar-2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and public involvement in large-scale projects or laws and policies. It usually involves ''notification'' (to publicise the matter to be consulted on), ''consultation'' (a two-way flow of information and opinion exchange) as well as ''participation'' (involving interest groups in the drafting of policy or legislation).&lt;ref name="OECD"/&gt; A frequently used tool for understanding different levels of community participation in consultation is known as [[Arnstein's ladder]].

The process is typical of [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shannon|first=Moneo|title=Everyone Has An Opinion: The Art of Community Consultation|url=http://cityspaces.ca/art-community-consultation/|accessdate=April 8, 2014|newspaper=Douglas Magazine|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Zealand]] or [[Australia]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} though most [[democracy|democratic]] countries have similar systems. In the [[United States]], for example, this process is called "public notice and comment" (see [[Rulemaking]]). Some organisations such as the [[OECD]] also use such processes.&lt;ref name="OECD"/&gt; In Canada, the word "consultation" has a special meaning among some First Nations Groups: "it is the duty of the Crown and third parties to consult with First Nations who have asserted, but not proved, [[Indigenous peoples#Indigenous rights, issues and concerns|aboriginal rights]] or title."&lt;ref&gt;Billy Garton and Sandra Carter, "First Nations Consultation: Higher, Wider, Deeper and Sooner", Bull, Housser &amp; Tupper, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is great variation of public consultations. In some countries there is a list of all consultations, or consultations are mentioned in normal news feed. Depending on the country there can be national or regional public consultations.

Ineffective consultations are considered to be cosmetic consultations that were done due to obligation or show and not true participatory decision making.

'''''Re Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd''''' is a 1998 judgment from the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] regarding the priority of employees interests when a company declares bankruptcy. The judgment hinged on the interpretation of the [[Employment Standards Act]] and has been taken to mark the Supreme Court of Canada's adoption of the [[purposive approach]] to legislative interpretation. It has since been frequently cited in subsequent decisions of Canadian courts, nearly every time legislation is interpreted.

==Background==
Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd. filed for bankruptcy; employees subsequently lost their jobs. The company paid all wages, salaries, commissions, and vacation pay through termination. The [[Ministry of Labour (Ontario)|Ministry of Labour for the Province of Ontario]] audited the company to ensure that no further payments were owed to former employees under the Employment Standards Act (ESA). Proof of claim was submitted to a trustee, who subsequently disallowed the claim. According to the trustee, a company's bankruptcy does not constitute dismissal from employment; thus, the former employees of Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes gained no positive right to severance, termination or vacation pay under the ESA.

The case went before the [[Ontario Court of Justice (General Division)|Ontario Court (General Division)]] where the judge agreed with the Ministry of Labour and allowed the former employees to be paid. However, the [[Ontario Court of Appeal]] overturned the ruling and restored the Trustee's decision. The Ministry sought leave to appeal from the Court of Appeal judgment but discontinued its application. Following the discontinuance of the appeal, the Trustee paid a dividend to Rizzo's creditors, thereby leaving significantly less funds in the estate. Subsequently, the appellants, five former employees of Rizzo, moved to set aside the discontinuance, add themselves as parties to the proceedings, and requested and were granted an order granting them leave to appeal.

==Ruling==

In the unanimous decision, the Supreme Court allowed the employees' appeal holding that they were entitled to the payments. While the plain language of the Act seemed to suggest that termination pay and severance pay were payable only when the employer terminates the employment, the Court held that the words of an Act must be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament.

Iacobucci J. wrote:

[[Elmer Driedger]] in Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983) best encapsulates the approach upon which I prefer to rely. He recognizes that statutory interpretation cannot be founded on the wording of the legislation alone. At p.&amp;nbsp;87 he states

''Today there is only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament.''

(Re Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd ''[1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para 21, quoting E. A. Driedger, The Construction of Statutes (2nd ed 1983), at p. 87'')

The Court of Appeal had failed to read the language of the Act in this broad manner the Supreme Court held. It noted that the purpose of the termination and severance pay provisions were to protect employees, to recognize their service and investment in the employer's enterprise and to cushion them against the adverse effects of economic dislocation. To hold that (more junior) employees terminated prior to bankruptcy would be entitled to termination and severance pay while (more senior) employees terminated upon bankruptcy  would be absurd, the Court held:

:The trial judge properly noted that, if the ESA termination and severance pay provisions do not apply in circumstances of bankruptcy, those employees “fortunate” enough to have been dismissed the day before a bankruptcy would be entitled to such payments, but those terminated on the day the bankruptcy becomes final would not be so entitled.  In my view, the absurdity of this consequence is particularly evident in a unionized workplace where seniority is a factor in determining the order of lay-off. The more senior the employee, the larger the investment he or she has made in the employer and the greater the entitlement to termination and severance pay. However, it is the more senior personnel who are likely to be employed up until the time of the bankruptcy and who would thereby lose their entitlements to these payments.

The Court also held that the legislative history of the termination and severance pay provisions and the other provisions in the ESA supported an interpretation that such benefits were payable to employees whose employment is terminated upon bankruptcy. The Court also ordered the Ministry of Labour to pay the employees' costs, since it had not provided the Court with any evidence as to the effort it made to notify or secure the consent of the Rizzo employees before it discontinued its application for leave to appeal to this Court on their behalf.

The '''Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia''' ('''RRIM'''; {{lang-ms|Institut Penyelidikan Getah Malaysia}}) is a research center for problems and matters pertaining to rubber and its industry in [[Malaysia]].

==History==
On 29 June 1925, the bill to incorporate the '''Rubber Research Institute of Malaya''' was passed by the government. Dr G. Bryce was appointed the first Director of the institute on 26 September 1926. On 31 October 1926, its laboratory at Petaling Estate was closed down and from 1 November 1926, the institute took over the equipment of the Rubber Growers' Association. Also in 1926, the institute made a request to the government for the temporary laboratory building of the institute at [[Jalan Damansara|Damansara Road]] in [[Selangor]]. The request was granted and the building was leased for five years. In 1936, the institute decided to relocate to a new building at [[Jalan Ampang|Ampang Road]]. The building was officiated by [[Sultan of Selangor|Selangor Sultan]] [[Sulaiman of Selangor|Sulaiman]] on 22 April 1936 and the institute restarted its operation on 19 May 1937.&lt;ref name="lgm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lgm.gov.my/general/rrim70yrs.aspx|publisher=lgm.gov.my|title=General Information - The Origin and Establishment of RRIM|accessdate=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insulflex.com.my/about_us/certificates/certificate_231110/Rubber_Research_Institute_ASTMD1171_(Ozone_Test).pdf|date=27 April 1995|title=Test Report|website=Insulflex|publisher=Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Shrewsbury Business Park''' is a commercial development on the outskirts of [[Shrewsbury]], [[Shropshire]] (at [[Emstrey, Shropshire|Emstrey]]). Construction commenced in late 2001 on the {{convert|30|acre|m2|adj=on}}, £25 million site, and is still ongoing. Almost {{convert|200,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} of business premises have been delivered, largely attributed to Phase One of the scheme. Over 1,000 people are based there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.shropshirestar.com/money/careers/2011/02/28/1000-jobs-planned-for-shrewsbury-business-park/ |title=1,000 jobs planned for Shrewsbury Business Park |publisher=Shropshire Star |accessdate=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The idea was first promoted by local developer the Alaska Group, which entered into a partnership with Shropshire County Council. Mainly offices, the business park includes a Holiday Inn Express  Hotel and a children's daycare centre. Plans exist for a cafe retail unit at the heart of the development.

Alaska Group was founded in London in 1994 in a former fur factory known as the Alaska Works, where skins were imported from Alaska.  The company has no other connection with Alaska, however it gave the Park several quotes from that State. The main route through the Park, Sitka Drive, is named after the National tree of Alaska. Other names include Anchorage Avenue, Mt McKinley Building, Bering House and Juneau House.

Located around 3 miles / 5km south east of the town centre of Shrewsbury, Shropshire's [[county town]], the [[business park]] lies on the junction of the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]] bypass and the B4380, near to Emstrey. The park's appeal is partly thanks to excellent transport links via the nearby [[M54 motorway]] to [[Telford]], [[Wolverhampton]] and [[Birmingham]], while being near to a fine medieval town and beautiful countryside. 

Other business park developments in and around the town include the [[Oxon Business Park]] to the West of the town centre and the Battlefield Enterprise Park to the North, and Abbey Lawn next to [[Shrewsbury Abbey]], just across the [[Severn]] from the town centre.

==Buildings==
[[Image:Shrewsbury_Business_Park_2.jpg|thumb|288px|right|The Alaska Building]]
[[Image:Shrewsbury_Business_Park_1.jpg|thumb|288px|right|A typical building style on the site]]

The park's buildings are a combination of fully customised modern and traditional structures, all with dedicated parking.

The Creative Quarter is home to five offices, The Alaska Building (Pictured Right), Global House, Mercury House, Jupiter House and the Community Council Building

Mtech's office, seen bottom right, is typical of some of the smaller properties available on the development.

The Professional Quarter is of more traditional brick design and includes professional clients including Handelsbanken.

==Phase 2==
Work started in 2008 on phase 2 of Shrewsbury Business Park after Alaska Group agreed a new Partnership with Shropshire Council, following the success of phase 1.  Another 20,000 m² is planned and the first three buildings are now nearing completion. Deutsche Bank are the first occupiers of phase 2.

Thirdly, employer must pay at least 50% of the full-time employee's premium costs. However, employers are not required to offer coverage to part-time employees (work fewer than 30 works/week) or dependents, or to  seasonal workers  who aren't considered  full-time employees unless they work more than 120 days during the tax year. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.irs.gov/uac/Small-Business-Health-Care-Tax-Credit-Questions-and-Answers:-Determining-FTEs-and-Average-Annual-Wages&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, the coverage to those full-employment must be offered through SHOP Marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.healthcare.gov/small-businesses/provide-shop-coverage/small-business-tax-credits/&lt;/ref&gt; 

Employers should apply to receive this tax credit on the annual [[business tax return]]&lt;ref&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paychex-offers-five-tax-tips-203400203.html&lt;/ref&gt; The tax credit is highest in particularly for small companies with fewer than 10 employees, with an average annual salary of $25,000 or less. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.healthcare.gov/small-businesses/provide-shop-coverage/small-business-tax-credits/&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, if there are 10 employees with total wage of $250,000, employer will receive a tax credit amount of $35,000 as they contribute at least $70,000 to their premiums. &lt;ref&gt; https://www.healthcare.gov/small-businesses/provide-shop-coverage/small-business-tax-credits/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Beacon''' is a skyscraper in [[downtown Cleveland]] that began construction at 515 [[Euclid Avenue (Cleveland)|Euclid Avenue]] in late 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/cleveland-metro/as-beacon-apartment-construction-begins-a-look-at-the-status-of-other-downtown-cleveland-projects|title=As Beacon apartment construction begins a look at the status of other Downtown Cleveland projects|first=John|last=Kosich|date=September 13, 2017|website=News5Cleveland.com|access-date=November 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tower will be {{convert|355|feet|m}} tall, with approval from the city council to exceed the city's {{convert|250|feet|m}} limit.&lt;ref name="cleveland.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2016/07/first_look_beacon_apartment_to.html|title=First look: Beacon apartment tower planned atop 515 Euclid garage in downtown Cleveland (photos)|website=Cleveland.com|access-date=November 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The building will be located on the [[Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority|GCRTA]] Euclid Corridor Rapid Bus Transit line that leads from [[Public Square, Cleveland|Public Square]] to the [[University Circle]] district on the south east side of the city 

Part of the need for the tower is due to the two decade old resurgence of interest in downtown Cleveland. Residential population has upticked, spearheaded by a 77% increase of new housing units and 95% occupancy rate from 2000 to 2015 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.downtowncleveland.com/DCA/media/DCA_Media/Work/Reports/Q1-2017-Market-Update-2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. This surge in residential growth has seen nearly 15,000 people living in the Cleveland neighborhood as of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/news/2017/05/01/downtown-cleveland-residential-population.html 2017/05/01 bizjournals.com]&lt;/ref&gt; That makes downtown Cleveland the largest populated downtown in Ohio (far ahead of [[Downtown Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Cincinnati]], and [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]]) which illustrates the need for more housing capacity in the central location of Cleveland. When completed it will be the third-tallest residential building in the city behind the [[Terminal Tower]], which is slated to be converted into apartments, and [[The 9 Cleveland]].

==Design==
The tower will sit atop a seven-level parking garage that was built nearly ten years earlier for a project that never materialized. This will help keep additional infrastructure costs down. The winning design that was presented to the Cleveland City Council was by Cleveland architecture firm of Westlake Reed Leskosky and the Boston firm Nadaaa. The project will be completed by Stark Enterprises. &lt;ref name="cleveland.com"/&gt;

The Beacon will feature a facade interlocked with colored interchanging metal panels that will reflect the sun and be brightly illuminated with exterior lighting at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crainscleveland.com/article/20170328/NEWS/170329772/start-of-62-million-apartment-tower-in-downtown-cleveland-set-for|title=Start of $62 million apartment tower in downtown Cleveland set for June - Crain's Cleveland Business|date=March 27, 2017|website=CrainsCleveland.com|access-date=November 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pinnacle will feature a multistory ''Beacon'' masthead that can be seen for miles in either direction. 

The chosen site is notable because over ten years ago it was proposed that an apartment tower should sit on the lot behind the [[200 Public Square|Huntington Building]] on East Roadway and Euclid. For various reasons, mostly due to financing and design flaws, that tower never rose. The Beacon will be the first new residential high rise erected in Cleveland's [[central business district]] since 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thebeaconcleveland.com/|title=The Beacon - Apartments in Cleveland, OH|website=www.TheBeaconCleveland.com|access-date=November 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakabpa], Les Cahiers du CEIMA, Numéro 8, décembre 2012, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States.

He works for the Tibetan government in exile in India as CEO of the Tibetan Industrial Rehabilitation Society founded in October 1965 by the Government of India, the Tibetan exile government and foreign aid agencies,&lt;ref&gt;Hubertus von Welck, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eR6qa-BQ8p0C&amp;pg=PA139 Exile as Challenge: The Tibetan Diaspora], p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Römer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nw-hXk8rLIEC&amp;pg=PA71 The Tibetan Government-in-Exile: Politics at Large], p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; and rehabilitates 7000 Tibetan refugees in agribusiness camps in Himachal Pradesh.&lt;ref name="namsebangdzo"&gt;[http://www.namsebangdzo.com/Dead_People_Talking_Collection_of_Poems_p/17192.htm Dead People Talking]&lt;/ref&gt;

There he became an international banker for the [[Republic New York|Republic National Bank of New York]] where he was assistant vice president&lt;ref&gt;Asia, Volumes 1 à 3, 1978, p. 40 : "The son, Tsoltim N. Shakabpa, is an assistant vice president of the Republic National Bank of New York. His memories of Tibet are faint, because when he left there in 1950, he was only 7 years old. Now a United States citizen, he lives with his American wife in Cranford, New Jersey, where their son and daughter attend public school. The young Mr. Shakabpa has become so firmly established here that he says he doubts that he would return to Tibet for more than a visit even if he could."&lt;/ref&gt; based in Hong Kong before being appointed Senior Vice President in 1985,&lt;ref&gt;Asian Finance, Volume 11, Asian Finance Publications, 1985, p. 81 : "TSOLTIM N.

Despite these setbacks, he became president of the Tibetan Association of Washington and founded the festival  [[Festál at Seattle Center|TibetFest]] in Seattle in the state of Washington.&lt;ref name="namsebangdzo"/&gt;

While adopting a healthy attitude towards life, he continues to fight for the independence of Tibet,&lt;ref name="PublishAmerica" /&gt; questioning the Tibetan autonomy requested by the Tibetan government in exile in China, which can not offer freedom as great as that enjoyed by the Tibetan refugees in the world today.&lt;ref&gt;[[Claude Arpi]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=vvuSXV4r2YIC&amp;pg=PA432 Tibet, le pays sacrifié], p. 432&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, he gets a prize of Saint Joseph's College in Darjeeling.&lt;ref name="namsebangdzo"/&gt;

In 2011, he is among the Tibetan poets who participate to [[100 Thousand Poets for Change]].&lt;ref&gt;Teresa Dowell, [http://www.pirenesfountain.com/archives/issue_11/100tpc/dowell.html They Don't Care... Do You?], 100 Thousand Poets for Change, 24 septembre 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
