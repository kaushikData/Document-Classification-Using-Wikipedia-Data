      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3492">A '''sex strike''', a form of [[nonviolent protest]], was held by [[Kenya]]n female activists in 2009 to end the deteriorating relationship between the country’s [[President of Kenya|President]], [[Mwai Kibaki]], and [[Prime Minister of Kenya|Prime Minister]], [[Raila Odinga]], who agreed to share leadership powers in Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/kenya/5245040/Kenyan-women-go-on-sex-strike-to-force-politicians-to-talk.html|title=Kenyan women go on sex strike to force politicians to talk|author=Mike Pflanz in Nairobi|date=29 April 2009|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a seven-day [[sex strike]], which involved thousands of women who vowed to withhold sex from their partner. This sex strike was aimed at forcing the leaders to reconcile as they had different views on how Kenya should be run as well as issued conflicting policies that did not focus on urgent issues that mattered in Kenya such as dealing with corruption and poverty.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8025457.stm |title=Africa &amp;#124; Kenyan women hit men with sex ban |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-04-29 |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of the strike was to revive Kenya and fix the bickering leadership. The women had a set of demands they wanted to be fulfilled which involved principles such as respect and good faith from the leaders. The strike lasted seven days, after which it ended with a joint prayer session where the conflicting leaders finally agreed to talk.

==Tribal violence==
{{main|2007–08 Kenyan crisis}}
In 2009, Kenya was experiencing an [[2007–08 Kenyan crisis|enormous amount of post-election violence]] once the President and Prime Minister were appointed as leaders. This resulted in communal violence between tribes. Kenya had a [[Kenyan general election, 2007|disputed election]] that led to tribal conflict, which killed more than a thousand people and left more than six hundred thousand people homeless.

==Movement==
The sex strike was enforced by a women's group called Women's Development Organization, a group in Kenya that is a prominent women’s rights group.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; The Women's Development Organization group has been around for the longest in Kenya as a form of women’s rights movements. Eleven other women's groups also joined the strike, eventually involving thousands of women. The movement was significant and caused a major challenge because many men in Kenya are [[Polygamy|polygamous]], as it is allowed by law. The sex strike lasted a full week, from May 1, 2009 until May 7. The nonviolent action was the omission of sex by women from men and their husbands.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

The act of resisting sex was enough for the government to reconsider the leadership and how Kenya was being run.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="894">'''Albrecht von Nürnberg''' was a medieval [[Berne]]se master sculptor originally from [[Nürnberg]]. He is first mentioned in 1492 and died some time after 1531 in Berne.

His principal works include the nine-metre wooden [[Saint Christopher|Christophorus]] figure originally installed at the [[Christoffelturm]] in Berne (1496–1498) and the [[baptismal font]] in the [[Münster of Berne]] (1524-1525). With [[Matthäus Ensinger]] and [[Erhard Küng]], Albrecht is one of three outstanding Bernese sculptors.

'''Arthur Guirdham''' (1905–1992) was an English physician, [[psychiatrist]], novelist, and writer on the [[Catharism|Cathar]] sect, [[alternative medicine]], [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]] and [[reincarnation]].

== Biography ==

He was born in [[Workington]], [[Cumbria]],{{refn|group=nb|In ''A foot in both World's'', in conversation with a women born in [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]], in [[Cumberland]], Guirdham states that he did not go there and spent most of his time between the (west) coast and [[Loweswater]].&lt;ref name ="foot-23-24"&gt;{{cite book |author=Guirdham, Arthur |title= A foot in both World's: A Doctor's autobiography of Psychic experience |publisher = Nevill Spearman |location = Jersey |year= 1973 |isbn= 0-85978-002-3 |pages= 23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} into a working-class family of [[Huguenot]] descent – his father was a steel worker – yet he unusually gained a scholarship from technical school in Workington to [[Oxford University]]. He graduated from both Oxford University and [[Charing Cross Hospital|Charing Cross]].&lt;ref name ="foot-198"&gt;{{cite book |author=Guirdham, Arthur |title= A foot in both World's: A Doctor's autobiography of Psychic experience |publisher = Nevill Spearman |location = Jersey |year= 1973 |isbn= 0-85978-002-3 |page= 198}}&lt;/ref&gt; While pursuing a career in psychiatry, Guirdham was also a tireless writer, supported by the nearly full-time secretarial and editing assistance of his wife Mary. His book ''Disease and the Social System'' (1942) was a groundbreaking meditation on the connections between biological [[disease]] and industrialized food and the [[social stress]]es of modernity. His book ''The Theory of Disease'' (1957), mentioned in [[Brian Inglis]]' ''History of Medicine'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Lloyd G. Stephenson (Editor) |journal=Jnl of the History of Med. and Allied S |title=Brian Inglis, A History of Medicine, London, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1965.xv, 196 pp., illus. 16s. |date=July 1966 |url=http://jhmas.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/XXI/3/320}}&lt;/ref&gt; offered an early alternative perspective on mental illness and personality, including some ideas later taken up by the [[anti-psychiatry]] movement. Guirdham continue to write indefatigably in a variety of genres, including poetry.

After writing a couple of wartime thrillers he became increasingly interested in [[esoteric]] history and reincarnation. His books ''The Lake and the Castle'' (1976) and ''The Great Heresy: The History and Beliefs of the Cathars'' (1977) describe the [[Cathar]] faith. He also wrote on [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[C. G. Jung]]. Most successful, however, were his books on reincarnation, notably ''The Cathars and Reincarnation'', which were translated into several languages and won him a loyal audience of enthusiasts and a significant role within British studies of the [[paranormal]] and alternative perspectives on mental illness.

Novelist and occult writer [[Colin Wilson]] was a friend of Guirdham and stayed at his house on a number of occasions. He wrote approvingly of Guirdham's reincarnation claims.&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin Wilson|Wilson, Colin]]. (2000). ''Afterlife''. Caxton Editions. p. 201. {{ISBN|978-1840672831}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson interviewed Guirdham for his book ''Strange Powers'' (1973).&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Lachman|Lachman, Gary]]. (2016). ''Beyond the Robot: The Life and Work of Colin Wilson''. TarcherPerigee. p. 178. {{ISBN|978-0399173080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

Guirdham's unorthodox ideas about [[psychosomatic medicine]] were criticized by the medical community.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous. (1942). ''Review: The Psychosomatic Conception of Disease: Disease and the Social System by Arthur Guirdham''. ''The British Medical Journal'' 1 (4240): 467.&lt;/ref&gt;
Professor D. V. Hubble in the ''[[The BMJ|British Medical Journal]]'' noted that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Dr. Guirdham takes the Freudian theories of repression and the unconscious and extends them to the conclusion that the three types of disease-neurosis, functional (autonomic) disorders, and organic stress diseases-result from a repression of emotion into three strata, differing in depth, of the unconscious mind. The theory appears to be supported by little enough evidence; indeed, throughout the book the factual basis for Dr. Guirdham's theories is not considerable."&lt;ref&gt;Hubble, D. V. (1958). ''Review: Obsessional Nordic Man: A Theory of Disease by Arthur Guirdham.'' ''The British Medical Journal'' 1 (5086): 1526.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Brian Inglis]] who was supportive of some of Guirdham's ideas wrote that a negative aspect of his writing was that he tended "to make sweeping assertions unsupported by evidence".&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Inglis|Inglis, Brian]]. (1958). ''Body and Soul: A Theory of Disease by Arthur Guirdham''. ''[[Encounter (magazine)|Encounter]]''. pp. 84-85&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Robert A. Baker]] listed  Guirdham and [[Carl Wickland]] as early psychiatrists who preferred to "ignore the science and embrace the supernatural".&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert A. Baker|Baker, Robert A]]. (1996). ''Hidden Memories: Voices and Visions From Within''. [[Prometheus Books]]. p. 202. {{ISBN|978-1-57392-094-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical researcher [[Ian Wilson (author)|Ian Wilson]] has criticized the reincarnation claims of Guirdham noting "serious errors and inconsistencies" in his book ''The Cathars and Reincarnation''. Wilson wrote that "Guirdham's claims lacking any means of independent verification, must be regarded as unacceptable."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Wilson (author)|Wilson, Ian]]. (1981). ''Mind Out of Time?: Reincarnation Claims Investigated''. Victor Gollancz Ltd. pp. 42-46. {{ISBN|0-575-02968-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Gray513.png|thumb|right|The [[carotid artery]] is the large vertical artery in red. The blood supply to the [[common carotid artery]] starts at the arch of the [[aorta]] (left) or the [[subclavian artery]] (right). The common carotid artery divides into the [[internal carotid artery]] and the [[external carotid artery]]. Plaque often builds up at that division, and a carotid endarterectomy cuts open the artery and removes the plaque.]]
[[Image:Carotid Plaque.jpg|thumb|right|Carotid endarterectomy specimen. The specimen is removed from within the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the [[common carotid artery]] (bottom), and the [[internal carotid artery]] (left) and [[external carotid artery]] (right).]]

'''Carotid endarterectomy''' ('''CEA''') is a [[surgery|surgical]] procedure performed by [[vascular surgeons]] used to reduce the risk of [[stroke]] by correcting [[carotid stenosis|stenosis]] (narrowing) in the [[common carotid artery]] or [[internal carotid artery]]. [[Endarterectomy]] is the removal of material on the inside (''end(o)-'') of an [[artery]].

[[Atherosclerosis]] causes [[Atheroma|plaque]] to form within the carotid artery walls, usually at the fork where the common carotid artery divides into the internal and external carotid artery. The plaque build up can narrow or constrict the artery [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]], a condition called [[stenosis]]. Rupture of the plaque can cause the formation of a  [[thrombosis|blood clot]] in the artery. A piece of the formed blood clot often breaks off and travels ([[embolization|embolizes]]) up through the internal carotid artery into the brain, where it blocks circulation, and can cause death of the brain tissue, a condition referred to as ischemic [[stroke]].

Sometimes the [[stenosis]] causes temporary symptoms first, known as [[transient ischemic attack|TIAs]], where temporary ischemia occurs in the [[brain]], [[spinal cord]], or [[retina]] without causing an [[infarction]].&lt;ref name="EastonSaver2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Easton|first1=J.

[[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] (NICE) guidelines recommend that patients with moderate to severe (50–99% blockage) stenosis, and symptoms, should have "urgent" endarterectomy within 2 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Swain, Claire Turner, Pippa Tyrrell, Anthony Rudd on behalf of the Guideline Development Group, Diagnosis and initial management of acute stroke and transient ischaemic attack: summary of NICE guidance, [http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/337/jul24_1/a786 BMJ 2008;337:a786], {{doi|10.1136/bmj.a786}} (Published 24 July 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;	

When the plaque does not cause symptoms, patients are still at higher risk of stroke than the general population, but not as high as patients with symptomatic stenosis. The incidence of stroke, including fatal stroke, is 1–2% per year. The surgical mortality of endarterectomy ranges from 1–2% to as much as 10%. Two large randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that carotid surgery done with a 30-day stroke and death risk of 3% or less will benefit asymptomatic patients with ≥60% stenosis who are expected to live at least 5 years after surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Executive Committee for the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS) | year = 1995 | title = Endarterectomy for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 273 | issue = | pages = 1421–1428 | doi=10.1001/jama.273.18.1421}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Halliday A, Mansfield A, Marro J, Peto C, Peto R, Potter J, Thomas D | year = 2004 | title = Prevention of disabling and fatal strokes by successful carotid endarterectomy in patients without recent neurological symptoms: randomised controlled trial | journal = Lancet | volume = 363 | issue = | pages = 1491–1502 | doi = 10.1016/s0140-6736(04)16146-1 | pmid = 15135594}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surgeons are divided over whether asymptomatic patients should be treated with medication alone or should have surgery.&lt;ref&gt;Clinical Decisions: Management of Carotid Stenosis, N Engl J Med 358:1617–1621&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123604022901114761 Drug Therapy Gains Favor to Avert Stroke], By THOMAS M.

In endarterectomy, the surgeon opens the artery and removes the plaque. The plaque forms and enlarges in the inner layer of the artery, or [[endothelium]], hence the name of the procedure which simply means removal of the endothelium of the artery. A newer procedure, endovascular [[angioplasty]] and [[stent]]ing, threads a catheter up from the groin, around the aortic arch, and up the carotid artery. The catheter uses a balloon to expand the artery, and inserts a stent to hold the artery open. In several clinical trials, the 30-day incidence of heart attack, stroke, or death was significantly higher with stenting than with endarterectomy (9.6% vs. 3.9%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://general-medicine.jwatch.org/cgi/content/full/2008/1009/1 Carotid Stenting vs. Endarterectomy: Longer-Term Outcomes] JournalWatch General Medicine&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19028045"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Sidawy AN, Zwolak RM, White RA, Siami FS, Schermerhorn ML, Sicard GA |title = Risk-adjusted 30-day outcomes of carotid stenting and endarterectomy: results from the SVS Vascular Registry |journal = Journal of Vascular Surgery |volume = 49 |issue = 1 |pages = 71–9 |year = 2009 |pmid = 19028045 |doi = 10.1016/j.jvs.2008.08.039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indications==
The aim of CEA is to prevent the adverse sequelae of carotid artery stenosis secondary to atherosclerotic disease, i.e. ischemic stroke.  As with any prophylactic operation, careful evaluation of the relative benefits and risks of the procedure is required on an individual patient basis.  Peri-operative CEA risks for combined 30 day mortality and stroke risk should be &lt; 3% for asymptomatic patients and ≤ 6% for symptomatic patients.  Symptomatic patients typically have either transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke, defined as a focal neurologic defect affecting one side of the body, speech, or vision.   Asymptomatic patients have narrowing of their carotid arteries, but have not experienced a TIA or stroke.

Carotid stenosis is diagnosed with [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound doppler]] studies of the neck arteries, [[magnetic resonance angiography]] (MRA) or [[computed tomography angiography]] (CTA) or invasive angiography. Revascularization of symptomatic stenoses has a much higher [[therapeutic index]] compared to asymptomatic lesions.

The North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) and the European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST) are both large randomized class 1 studies which have helped define current indications for carotid endarterectomy in symptomatic patients.  The NASCET found that for every six patients treated, one major stroke would be prevented at two years (i.e. a [[number needed to treat]] (NNT) of six) for symptomatic patients with a 70–99% stenosis, where percent stenosis was defined as:&lt;ref name="pmid9811916"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barnett HJ |title=Benefit of carotid endarterectomy in patients with symptomatic moderate or severe stenosis. North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial Collaborators |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=339 |issue=20 |pages=1415–1425 |date=November 1998 |pmid=9811916 |doi= 10.1056/NEJM199811123392002|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=short&amp;pmid=9811916&amp;promo=ONFLNS19 |author2=Taylor DW |author3=Eliasziw M |display-authors=3 |last4=Fox |first4=Allan J. |last5=Ferguson |first5=Gary G. |last6=Haynes |first6=R. Brian |last7=Rankin |first7=Richard N. |last8=Clagett |first8=G. Patrick |last9=Hachinski |first9=Vladimir C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: percent stenosis = ( 1 − ( minimal diameter ) / ( poststenotic diameter ) ) × 100%.

Symptomatic patients with less severe carotid occlusion (50–69%) had a smaller benefit, with a NNT of 22 at five years (Barclay).  In addition, co-morbidity adversely affects the outcome; patients with multiple medical problems have a higher post-operative [[mortality rate]] and hence benefit less from the procedure. For maximum benefit patients should be operated on soon after a TIA or stroke, preferably within the first 2 weeks.

For asymptomatic patients (those without TIA or strokes) the European asymptomatic carotid surgery trial (ACST) found that asymptomatic patients may also benefit from the procedure, but only the group with a high grade stenosis.  The key in estimating the potential benefit for revascularization in asymptomatic patients is understanding the natural history of the disease, including the annual risk of stroke.  Most agree that the annual risk of stroke in patients with asymptomatic carotid disease is between 1% and 2%, although some patients are considered to be at higher risk such as those with ulcerated plaques.  In randomized trials of CEA compared to medication therapy, it has been shown that stroke is reduced by surgery, but the benefit does not appear for several years after the surgery is performed.  This is because there are peri-operative complications (stroke and death) in the surgical patients.  The longer a patient lives after surgery magnifies the surgical benefit.

Typically, asymptomatic patients must be expected to survive at least 5 years after surgery to warrant accepting the risk of surgery.&lt;ref name="AANfive"&gt;{{Citation |author1 = American Academy of Neurology |author1-link = American Academy of Neurology |date=February 2013 |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = American Academy of Neurology |work = [[Choosing Wisely]]: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page = |url = http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-academy-of-neurology/ |accessdate = August 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current surgical best-practice restricts surgery for asymptomatic carotid stenosis to patients with ≥70% carotid stenosis if the surgery can be performed with ≤3% risk of perioperative complications.&lt;ref name="AANfive"/&gt;

==Contraindications==
The procedure is not necessary when:
*There is complete internal carotid artery obstruction (because there is no benefit to treating chronic occlusion).
*The patient has a previous complete hemispheric stroke on the [[Anatomical terms of location#Other directional terms|ipsilateral]] and complete cerebrovascular territory side severe neurologic deficits (NIHSS&gt;15), because there is no brain tissue at risk for further damage.
*Patient deemed unfit for the operation by the surgeon or anesthesiologist due to [[Comorbidity|comorbidities]].

High risk criteria for CEA include the following:
*Age ≥80 years.
*Class III/IV congestive heart failure.
*Class III/IV angina pectoris.
*Left main or multi vessel coronary artery disease.
*Need for open heart surgery within 30 days.
*Left ventricular ejection fraction of ≤30%.
*Recent (≤30-day) heart attack.
*Severe lung disease or COPD.
*Severe renal disease.
*High cervical (C2) or intrathoracic lesion.
*Prior radical neck surgery or radiation therapy.
*Contralateral carotid artery occlusion.
*Prior ipsilateral CEA.
*Contralateral laryngeal nerve injury.
*Tracheostoma.

==Procedure==
[[File:Blausen 0172 CarotidEndarterectomy.png|thumb|Illustration depicting a Carotid Endarterectomy]]
An incision is made on the midline side of the [[sternocleidomastoid muscle]]. The incision is between 5 and 10&amp;nbsp;cm in length. The internal, common and external carotid arteries are carefully identified, controlled with vessel loops, and clamped. The lumen of the internal carotid artery is opened, and the atheromatous plaque substance removed. The artery is closed using [[surgical suture|suture]] and a patch to increase the size of the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]]. [[Hemostasis]] is achieved, and the overlying layers closed with suture. The skin can be closed with suture which may be visible or invisible (absorbable). Many surgeons place a temporary [[Shunt (medical)|shunt]] to ensure blood supply to the [[brain]] during the procedure.  The procedure may be performed under general or local [[anaesthesia]]. The latter allows for direct monitoring of neurological status by intra-operative verbal contact and testing of grip strength.  With general anaesthesia, indirect methods of assessing cerebral perfusion must be used, such as [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), transcranial doppler analysis and carotid artery stump pressure monitoring.  At present there is no good evidence to show any major difference in outcome between local and general anaesthesia.

Minimally invasive procedures have been developed, by threading catheters through the [[femoral artery]], up through the [[aorta]], then inflating a balloon to dilate the carotid artery, with a wire-mesh stent and a device to protect the brain from embolization of plaque material. The FDA has approved 7 carotid stent systems as safe and effective in patients at increased risk of complications for carotid surgery and 1 carotid stent system for patients at average or usual risk of carotid surgery.  The SAPPHIRE study of patients at high surgical risk for carotid surgery demonstrated non-inferiority for carotid stenting compared to carotid surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Yadav JS |title=Protected carotid-artery stenting versus endarterectomy in high-risk patients |journal=N.

However, carotid endarterectomy was associated with a slightly higher rate of myocardial infarction around the time of the procedure (2.3% versus 1.1%).  Although the study's composite index including death, stroke, and myocardial infarction is not significantly different between the two groups, myocardial infarction was associated with less impact on quality of life as compared with stroke at one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brott TG, ((Hobson RW 2nd)), ((Howard G ''et al.'')) | year = 2010 | title = Stenting versus endarterectomy for treatment of carotid-artery stenosis | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa0912321 | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 363 | issue = | pages = 11–23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the consensus of experts in the field that carotid artery stenting should be considered an option for high risk patients who require carotid artery revascularization to prevent stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=White CJ, Beckman JA, Cambria RP, Comerota AJ, Gray WA, Hobson RW, Iyer SS | year = 2008 | title = Atherosclerotic Peripheral Vascular Disease Symposium II: controversies in carotid artery revascularization | url = | journal = Circulation | volume = 118 | issue = | pages = 2852–2859 | doi=10.1161/circulationaha.108.191175 | pmid=19106407}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brott TG, Halperin JL, Abbara S | year = 2011 | title = ASA/ACCF/AHA/AANN/AANS/ACR/ASNR/CNS/SAIP/SCAI/SIR/SNIS/SVM/SVS Guideline on the Management of Patients With Extracranial Carotid and Vertebral Artery Disease: Executive Summary A Report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines, and the American Stroke Association, American Association of Neuroscience Nurses, American Association of Neurological Surgeons, American College of Radiology, American Society of Neuroradiology, Congress of Neurological Surgeons, Society of Atherosclerosis Imaging and Prevention, Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, Society of Interventional Radiology, Society of NeuroInterventional Surgery, Society for Vascular Medicine, and Society for Vascular Surgery Developed in Collaboration With the American Academy of Neurology and Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography | url = | journal = J Am Coll Cardiol | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = 1002–44 |display-authors=etal | doi = 10.1016/j.jacc.2010.11.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complications==
For patients to benefit from revascularization, the surgeon's complication rate (30 day stroke and death) must remain ≤3% for asymptomatic and ≤6% of symptomatic patients. Other surgical complications include [[Hemorrhage]] of the wound bed, which is potentially life-threatening, as swelling of the neck due to [[hematoma]] could compress the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]]. Rarely, the [[hypoglossal nerve]] can be damaged during surgery. This is likely to result in [[fasciculations]] developing on the [[tongue]] and paralysis of the affected side: on sticking it out, the patient's tongue will deviate toward the affected side.
Another rare but potentially serious complication is [[hyperperfusion syndrome]] because of the sudden increase in perfusion of the vasculature distal to stenosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=van Mook WN |title=Cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome |journal=Lancet Neurol |volume=4 |issue=12 |pages=877–888 |year=2005 |pmid=16297845 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(05)70251-9 |author2=Rennenberg RJ |author3=Schurink GW |display-authors=3 |last4=Van Oostenbrugge |first4=Robert Jan |last5=Mess |first5=Werner H |last6=Hofman |first6=Paul AM |last7=De Leeuw |first7=Peter W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The endarterectomy procedure was developed and first done by the Portuguese surgeon Joao Cid dos Santos in 1946, when he operated an occluded superficial femoral artery,  at the [[University of Lisbon]]. In 1951 an Argentinian surgeon repaired a carotid artery occlusion using a bypass procedure. The first endarterectomy was successfully performed by [[Michael E. DeBakey|Michael DeBakey]] around 1953, at the [[The Methodist Hospital|Methodist Hospital]] in Houston, TX, although the technique was not reported in the medical literature until 1975.&lt;ref name=Friedman2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedman|first1=SG|title=The first carotid endarterectomy.|journal=Journal of vascular surgery|date=December 2014|volume=60|issue=6|pages=1703–8.e1-4|doi=10.1016/j.jvs.2014.08.059|pmid=25238726}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first case to be recorded in the medical literature was in The Lancet in 1954;&lt;ref name=Friedman2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eastcott|first1=HH|last2=Pickering|first2=GW|last3=Rob|first3=CG|title=Reconstruction of internal carotid artery in a patient with intermittent attacks of hemiplegia.|journal=Lancet|date=13 November 1954|volume=267|issue=6846|pages=994–6|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(54)90544-9|pmid=13213095}}&lt;/ref&gt; the surgeon was Felix Eastcott, a consultant surgeon and deputy director of the surgical unit at [[St Mary's Hospital, London]], UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article6971878.ece | location=London | work=The Times | title=Felix Eastcott, arterial surgeon | date=2009-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eastcott's procedure was not strictly an endarterectomy as we now understand it; he excised the diseased part of the artery and then resutured the healthy ends together.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Since then, evidence for its effectiveness in different patient groups has accumulated.

'''Chanie "Charlie" Wenjack''' (January 19, 1954{{snd}}October 23, 1966) was an [[Ojibwe]] ([[Anishinaabe]]) [[First Nations]] boy who ran away from [[List of Indian residential schools in Canada|Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School]] where he boarded for three years while attending residential school in [[Kenora]], [[Ontario]], Canada. He died of hunger and exposure at [[Farlane, Ontario]] while trying to walk 600&amp;nbsp;km (370&amp;nbsp;mi) back to his home, Ogoki Post on the [[Marten Falls First Nation|Marten Falls Reserve]]. His ordeal and his death brought attention to the treatment of children in the [[Canadian Indian residential school system|Canadian Indian Residential School System]] and following Wenjack's death, an inquest into the matter was ordered by the [[Government of Canada]].&lt;ref name="canenc"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/charlie-wenjack/ |title=Chanie Wenjack|website=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|access-date=October 17, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018010900/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/charlie-wenjack/ |archive-date=October 17, 2016|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mcleans"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.macleans.ca/society/the-lonely-death-of-chanie-wenjack/ |title=The Lonely Death of Charlie Wenjack|access-date=October 17, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913232707/http://www.macleans.ca/society/the-lonely-death-of-chanie-wenjack/ |archive-date=September 13, 2016|dead-url=no|publisher=[[Maclean's]]|last=Adams|first=Ian|author-link= Ian Adams|date=February 1, 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life, education and escape==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File: Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.jpg|thumb|Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School ]] --&gt;
Chanie Wenjak was born in 1954 on the Ogoki Post on the [[Marten Falls First Nation|Marten Falls Reserve]]. At the age of nine, he was sent, along with his two sisters, to board at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School in Kenora. Once there, he was given the name 'Charlie'. The school was funded by the Canadian government and overseen by the Women’s Missionary Society of the [[Presbyterian Church in Canada|Presbyterian Church]]. At the time, 150 students lived at the school. Wenjak began his schooling at the age of nine and was put in [[Remedial education|remedial classes]] soon after. He was known to have a good sense of humour, according to the Cree Principal of the school, and was always the first to recognize a pun or riddle.&lt;ref name="canenc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mcleans"/&gt;

On the morning of October 16, 1966, Wenjack and two school friends, orphaned brothers Ralph and Jackie MacDonald, ran away from the residential school, making it as far as [[Redditt]], {{convert|31|km|abbr=on}} north of Kenora. Wenjack only brought seven matches. The three boys stayed with Ralph and Jackie's uncle, Charley Kelly, in Redditt. After four days with the Kellys, Wenjak left to follow the [[Canadian National Railway]] (CN) mainline, heading towards Ogoki Post, {{convert|600|km|abbr=on}} east and north from Kenora. He had found a CN [[Public transport timetable|passenger timetable]] which included a map and was using it as guide to get back home. The Kellys gave him some food and matches and suggested that he ask for help from the section maintenance crews stationed along the line.&lt;ref name="canenc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mcleans"/&gt;

==Death==

Wenjack had only a light windbreaker and walked for 36 hours in the wind as the temperature dropped to {{convert|-6|C}}. Evidence given at the inquest into his death showed that he had made his way another {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}} east along the CN mainline. Bruises indicated that he fell several times. He collapsed and died sometime on the morning of October 23 in a [[Drilling and blasting|rock cut]] near [[Farlane, Ontario|Farlane]].&lt;ref name="canenc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mcleans"/&gt;

His body was discovered beside the track at 11:20 am on October 23 by Elwood McIvor, a CN railway engineer on freight train number No. 821. Elwood contacted the [[Ontario Provincial Police]] (OPP) who recovered the body an hour later with help from a CN section crew. Coroner Dr. Glenn Davidson determined the cause of the death was attributed to exposure and hunger.&lt;ref name="canenc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mcleans"/&gt;

On October 27, 1966, Wenjack was buried at the cemetery on the [[Indian reserve|reserve]] beside the [[Albany River]].&lt;ref name="canenc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mcleans"/&gt;

==Inquest and aftermath==

On November 17 an inquest was begun and a report was commissioned and determined that:

Ethical questions were raised and it brought to light the abuse and treatment of indigenous children in the residential school system. A year after Wenjack's death an article written by journalist [[Ian Adams]], "The Lonely Death of Charlie Wenjack," was published in February 1967 in ''[[Maclean's]]'' magazine. The article brought the ordeal to national attention.&lt;ref name="mcleans"/&gt;

The Wenjack affair along with many other incidents would bring legislative reforms and class action lawsuits as well as the [[Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement|Indian Residential School Settlement Agreement]] and the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]].

==Impact==

Today the story of Wenjack has been seen as a symbol of resistance against the residential school system. In 1973, indigenous students at [[Trent University]] lobbied for a building to be named after Wenjack. The largest lecture hall on campus was subsequently named Wenjack Theatre in Wenjack's honour. On March 9, 2018 Trent University marked the official launch of the Chanie Wenjack School for Indigenous Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.trentu.ca/indigenous/news-events/20865|title=Wenjack &amp; Downie Families Join Trent University to Celebrate Opening of Chanie Wenjack School for Indigenous Studies|last=|first=|date=March 9, 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Gord Downie-Chanie Wenjack Fund was established to help with reconciliation between Canada and its indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunder-bay/wenjack-fund-2018-budget-1.4554500 |title=Downie-Wenjack fund receives $5M in 2018 federal budget |publisher=CBC News |date=February 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
On June 21, 2016, a [[Heritage Minutes|Heritage Minute]] about Wenjack's death was released by [[Historica Canada]] to coincide with [[National Aboriginal Day]]. Unlike other Heritage Minutes that were narrated by actors, Wenjack's was narrated by his sister, Pearl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/new-heritage-minute-explores-dark-history-of-indian-residential-schools-1.3643363 |title=New Heritage Minute explores dark history of Indian residential schools|access-date=October 17, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018015814/http://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/new-heritage-minute-explores-dark-history-of-indian-residential-schools-1.3643363 |archive-date=October 17, 2016|dead-url=no|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Tragically Hip]] singer [[Gord Downie]] wrote a [[concept album]] based on Wenjack's escape. The album, dubbed ''[[Secret Path]]'', was released on October 18, 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/music/2016/09/11/the-flight-of-chanie-wenjack-the-boy-who-inspired-gord-downies-new-album.html |title=The flight of Chanie Wenjack, the boy who inspired Gord Downie’s new album|access-date=October 17, 2016|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]|last= Talaga|first=Tanya}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=secretpath&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/gord-downie-to-release-solo-album-graphic-novel-next-month-1.3064911 |title=Gord Downie to release solo album, graphic novel next month|publisher= [[CTV News]]|date=September 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916233907/http://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/gord-downie-to-release-solo-album-graphic-novel-next-month-1.3064911 |archive-date=October 16, 2016|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with a concurrent [[graphic novel]] of Wenjack's story by novelist [[Jeff Lemire]] and an animated film which aired on [[CBC Television]].

Published in October 2016, a novella by Canadian author [[Joseph Boyden]] focused on the suffering Wenjack endured and his state of mind during his ordeal. Its title is simply ''[[Wenjack (novella)|Wenjack]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/how-chanie-wenjack-chose-joseph-boyden/|title=How Chanie Wenjack chose Joseph Boyden - Macleans.ca|date=October 21, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles the Deaf''' ({{lang-sv|Karl Döve}}) from the [[House of Bjelbo]] was the [[jarl in Sweden|jarl]] of [[Sweden]] during 1216–1220.  His father was magnate [[Bengt Snivil]]. He was the brother of [[Magnus Minnesköld]] and jarl [[Birger Brosa]] and father of jarl [[Ulf Fase]]. Charles died at the [[Battle of Lihula]] in [[Estonia]] August 8, 1220.&lt;ref&gt;Lindström, p 274.&lt;/ref&gt;

The seal of Charles, discovered in the early 1990s, is dated to the end of the 12th century and thus the oldest preserved personal object in [[History of Sweden|Swedish history]].  Personal seals were normally broken to pieces at the death of the owner in order to prevent later abuse, and the intact seal of Charles is therefore unique.&lt;ref name="auktion-sigill"&gt;Auktionsverket&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Swedish Museum of National Antiquities]] bought it in 2001 for [[Swedish krona|SEK]] 800,000.&lt;ref name="Rötter"&gt;Rötter&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33172">'''Chemical castration''' is [[castration]] via [[anaphrodisiac]] [[drug]]s, whether to reduce [[libido]] and sexual activity, [[management of cancer|to treat cancer]], or otherwise. Unlike [[orchiectomy|surgical castration]], where the [[gonads]] are removed through an incision in the body,&lt;ref name=WashPost&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/04/AR2006070400960_pf.html "Can Castration Be a Solution for Sex Offenders?

In May 2016, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that a number of countries use chemical castration on [[rape|rapists]] and [[pedophilia|pedophiles]], often in return for reduced sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/world/asia/indonesia-chemical-castration.html|title=Indonesia Approves Castration for Sex Offenders Who Prey on Children|first=Joe|last=Cochrane|date=May 25, 2016|accessdate=September 16, 2017|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
===On men===
When used on men, these drugs can reduce sex drive, compulsive sexual fantasies, and capacity for [[sexual arousal]]. Life-threatening side effects are rare, but some users show increases in body fat and reduced bone density, which increase long-term risk of [[cardiovascular disease]] and [[osteoporosis]]. They may also experience [[gynecomastia]] (development of larger-than-normal mammary glands in males) as seen in [[Alan Turing]]'s case.

===On women===
{{further|Oophorectomy}}
When used on women, the effects are similar, though there is little research about chemically lowering women's sex drive or female-specific anaphrodisiacs, since most research focuses on the opposite, but anti-androgenic hormone regimens would lower testosterone in women which can impact sex drive or sexual response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/oophorectomy/basics/risks/prc-20012991|title=Oophorectomy (ovary removal surgery) - Risks|website=Mayoclinic.org|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news-medical.net/health/Oophorectomy-Risks.aspx|title=Oophorectomy Risks|date=16 August 2010|website=News-medical.net|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.3109/13697130903075345|title=Risk of hypoactive sexual desire disorder and associated factors in a cohort of oophorectomized women|first1=C.|last1=Castelo-Branco|first2=S.|last2=Palacios|first3=J.|last3=Combalia|first4=M.|last4=Ferrer|first5=G.|last5=Traveria|date=1 December 2009|journal=Climacteric|volume=12|issue=6|pages=525–532|accessdate=16 September 2017|via=Taylor and Francis+NEJM|doi=10.3109/13697130903075345|pmid=19905904}}&lt;/ref&gt; These drugs also deflate the breast glands and expand the size of the nipple.

==Treatment for sex offenders==
The first use of chemical castration occurred in 1944, when [[diethylstilbestrol]] was used with the purpose of lowering men's testosterone.&lt;ref name=JAAPL /&gt;
The [[antipsychotic]] agent [[benperidol]] is sometimes used to diminish sexual urges in people who display inappropriate sexual behavior, and can likewise be given by depot injection. But benperidol does not affect testosterone and is therefore not a castration agent.
Chemical castration is often seen as an easier alternative to [[life imprisonment]] or the [[death penalty]] because it allows the release of sex offenders while reducing or eliminating the chance that they reoffend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Ocala Star-Banner|date=21 February 1997|title=Bill would impose castration for convicted rapists|page=4B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, in an experiment by P. Gagne, 48 males with long-standing histories of sexually deviant behaviour were given [[medroxyprogesterone acetate]] for as long as 12 months. Forty of those subjects were recorded as to have diminished desires for deviant sexual behaviour, less frequent sexual fantasies, and greater control over sexual urges. The research recorded a continuation of this more positive behaviour after the administration of the drug had ended with no evidence of adverse side effects and recommended medroxyprogesterone acetate along with counselling as a successful method of treatment for serial sex offenders.&lt;ref name="apa"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/138/5/644|title=Treatment of sex offenders with medroxyprogesterone acetate|date=1 April 2006|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|accessdate=16 September 2017|via=ajp.psychiatryonline.org|doi=10.1176/ajp.138.5.644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific critique===
Citing the observation that spaying causes female animals to stop mating in the same species as castration cause male animals to stop mating, and that in the animal species where females continue their mating behaviour after being spayed the males also continue to mate after being castrated, there are scientists who argue that it makes no biological sense to assume that any treatment that emulates castration would remove sex drive in men but not in women. These scientists argue that these observations, along with the fact that humans are animals and subject to [[evolution]], show that it is flawed to think that male sexuality would be treatable by medication if female sexuality is not.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Aunger, Valerie Curtis (2015)"Gaining Control: How human behavior evolved"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(2015). "The myth of female sexual complexity"&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some criminologists argue that the appearance of a lower recidivism rate in male sex offenders who take chemical castration treatment than in those who do not can be explained by factors other than biological effects of the medication. One hypothesis is that men who accept the negative effects of hormonal treatment in exchange for shorter prison sentence are distinct in that they value freedom from incarceration higher than men who rather stay in prison for a longer time than face the side effects of chemical castration. These criminologists explain apparently lower recidivism as an artifact of men who accept chemical castration being more engaged in hiding the evidence for reoffending, and that paroling such offenders constitute a risk of releasing criminals who commit as many new crimes as others but are better at hiding it. These criminologists also argue that police investigators treating castrated men as less likely to reoffend than non-castrated men may cause an investigation bias and [[self-fulfilling prophecy]], and that men who sell some of their prescribed medicines on the black market for drugs get a hidden income that improve their ability to afford measures to hide recidivism that is not available to men without such prescriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Horne, Michael J. Lovaglia (2008). "Experiments in Criminology and Law: A Research Revolution"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sergio Sismondo, Jeremy A. Greene (2015). "The Pharmaceutical Studies Reader"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lorie A. Fridell (2016). "Producing Bias-Free Policing: A Science-Based Approach"&lt;/ref&gt;

Some neurologists acknowledge that testosterone plays a role in sexual arousal but that reducing sex drive will likely not reduce inappropriate sex behaviour. These researchers argue that since a weaker internal signal in the brain means a higher requirement for external stimulation to create a feedback loop that tires the brain circuits out as in orgasm and lead to satisfaction, a reduction of the internal stimulation from hormones would make the required external stimulation stronger and also more specific, as weaker signals involve narrower ranges of other brain functions in their loops. These scientists therefore argue that the biological (as opposed to sociological) effect of reduced testosterone is to make it more difficult and not easier to use masturbation without pornography or other socially acceptable substitutes to manage remaining sex drive in a former offender, and that many community persons (both male and female) find that a lower initial arousal makes it more difficult to orgasm by masturbation without pornography or with non-preferred stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;KC Berridge (2015). "Pleasure systems in the brain"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Feldman Barrett (2017). "How Emotions Are Made: The Secret Life of the Brain"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argentina===
In March 2010, Guillermo Fontana of [[CNN]] reported that officials in [[Mendoza (province)|Mendoza]], a [[Provinces of Argentina|province]] in [[Argentina]], approved the use of voluntary chemical castration for rapists, in return for reduced sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/03/19/argentina.castration/index.html |author=Fontana, Guillermo| work=[[CNN]] | title=Argentina province OKs chemical castration for rapists | date=March 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
In 2010, a repeat child sex offender who had been subject to chemical castration was accused of inappropriately touching and kissing a young girl. He was found not guilty by a jury, which was not informed of the context of his previous offenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Townsville Bulletin|date=30 October 2010|author=Roanne Johnson|title=Convicted paedophile allowed to look after kids|url=https://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2010/10/30/181291_news.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519161443/https://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2010/10/30/181291_news.html |archivedate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
The drug [[cyproterone acetate]] has been commonly used for chemical castration throughout Europe.  It resembles the drug MPA used in America.&lt;ref name=JAAPL /&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], computer scientist [[Alan Turing#Conviction for indecency|Alan Turing]], famous for his contributions to mathematics and computer science, was a homosexual who was forced to undergo chemical castration in order to avoid imprisonment in 1952.&lt;ref name=Independent /&gt;  At the time, homosexual acts between males were still illegal and homosexual orientation was widely considered to be a mental illness that could be treated with chemical castration.&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/the-turing-enigma-campaigners-demand-pardon-for-mathematics-genius-1773480.html The Turing enigma: Campaigners demand pardon for mathematics genius] by Jonathan Brown for the ''Independent'', August 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Turing experienced side effects such as breast enlargement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sullivan|first=Andrew|title=An Apology To Alan Turing|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/daily-dish/archive/2009/09/an-apology-to-alan-turing/196673/|work=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=20 October 2013|authorlink=Andrew Sullivan|archiveurl=http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2009/09/an-apology-to-alan-turing.html|archivedate=11 September 2009|date=11 September 2009|quote=[...] One of the known side effects of these hormone injections was the development of breasts, known as gynecomastia, something which plagued Turing for the rest of his life.

In 2008, an experimental intervention program was launched in three [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[prison]]s: Carregueira ([[Sintra Municipality|Belas, Sintra]]), [[Paços de Ferreira]] and [[Funchal]]. The program developers note the voluntary nature of the program a crucial factor in its success. They initially planned to cover ten inmates per prison, contemplating a possible enlargement to other prisons in the future. The program also included a [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]] component.&lt;ref name="Portugal"&gt;{{cite news |title = Mais condenações por abuso sexual de menor |publisher = [[Diário de Notícias]] |date = 5 October 2011 |url = http://umonline.uminho.pt/ModuleLeft.aspx?mdl=~/Modules/Clipping/NoticiaView.ascx&amp;ItemID=49257&amp;Mid=119&amp;lang=pt-PT&amp;pageid=74&amp;tabid=13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130928013803/http://umonline.uminho.pt/ModuleLeft.aspx?mdl=~%2FModules%2FClipping%2FNoticiaView.ascx&amp;ItemID=49257&amp;Mid=119&amp;lang=pt-PT&amp;pageid=74&amp;tabid=13 |archivedate = 2013-09-28 |deadurl = yes |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 25, 2009, [[Poland]] legislated forcible chemical castration of child molesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE58O4LE20090925|title=Poland okays forcible castration for pedophiles|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law came into effect on June 9, 2010; therefore in Poland "anyone guilty of raping a child under the age of 15 can now be forced to submit to chemical and psychological therapy to reduce sex drive at the end of a prison term".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/06/09/2922199.htm|title=Poland approves chemical castration for paedophiles|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 30, 2010, a man in the [[United Kingdom]] found guilty of attempting to murder a 60-year-old woman in order to abduct and rape her two granddaughters agreed to undergo chemical castration as part of the terms of his sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/8636891.stm|title=BBC News - 'Menace' jailed over child rape and abduction attempt|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 6, 2012, [[Moldova]] legislated forcible chemical castration of child molesters; the law came into effect on July 1, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noi.md/ru/news_id/10565|title=Moldova will punish pedophiles with chemical castration|work=Noi.md|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315010638/http://www.noi.md/ru/news_id/10565|archivedate=2012-03-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 5, 2012, [[Estonia]] passed a law to allow forced chemical castration of sex offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ruvr.ru/2012_06_05/77079747/|title=Estonia passes chemical castration law|website=english.ruvr.ru|accessdate=16 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608064406/http://english.ruvr.ru/2012_06_05/77079747/#|archive-date=2012-06-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October and November 2013, the [[Macedonia (country)|Macedonian]] authorities were working on developing a legal framework and standard procedure for implementation of chemical castration that would be used for convicted [[Child sexual abuse|child molester]]s. The castration is intended to be voluntarily, where as for the child molesters that repeat the criminal act it should be mandatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novamakedonija.com.mk/NewsDetal.asp?vest=11151396396&amp;id=12&amp;prilog=0&amp;setIzdanie=23028 |title=Хемиската кастрација за педофилите  ги подели психијатрите и правниците |work=novamakedonija.com.mk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131119224033/http://www.novamakedonija.com.mk/NewsDetal.asp?vest=11151396396&amp;id=12&amp;prilog=0&amp;setIzdanie=23028 |archivedate=2013-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
After the outrage following the [[2012 Delhi gang rape case|gang rape of a woman]] in [[Delhi]], the Government has submitted a draft proposing chemical castration along with an imprisonment of up to 30 years for rape convicts as part of the anti-rape law in India. The ministry is preparing a detailed bill and the recommended changes are under review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/generalnews/news/cong-draft-anti-rape-law-proposes-chemical-castration/102114/|title=Cong draft anti-rape law proposes chemical castration|author=Press Trust of India|date=30 December 2012|work=business-standard.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/congress-draft-antirape-law-proposes-chemical-castration/313080-37-64.html|title=Congress anti-rape law draft proposes chemical castration|work=IBNLive}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Government is also planning to re-define the Juvenile Act and lower their age. One of the accused in the rape case is a juvenile and aged a few months less than 18 years. A view has been expressed by a section that only those below 15 years should be described as juvenile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-12-30/india/36063952_1_chemical-castration-draft-bill-check-crimes | work=The Times Of India | title=Congress anti-rape draft bill proposes 30 years jail, chemical castration - The Times of India | date=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indonesia===
In 2016, the Indonesian President [[Joko Widodo]] introduced a presidential regulation to allow chemical castration to be handed down as a punishment to child sex offenders and [[Pedophilia|pedophiles]]. The regulation alters the contents of the 2002 Law on Child Protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/world/asia/indonesia-chemical-castration.html|title=Indonesia Approves Castration for Sex Offenders Who Prey on Children|last=Cochrane|first=Joe|date=2016-05-25|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
In May 2009, two brothers from [[Haifa]]—convicted child molesters—agreed to undergo chemical castration to avoid committing further crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Haaretz|author=Tali Libman|date=25 May 2009|title=Losing a battle to win the war|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/losing-a-battle-to-win-the-war-1.276650}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand, the [[Antiandrogen|antilibidinal drug]] [[cyproterone acetate]] is sold under the name Androcur. In November 2000 convicted [[paedophile]] Robert Jason Dittmer attacked a victim while on the drug. In 2009 a study into the effectiveness of the drug by Dr David Wales for the Corrections Department found that no research had been conducted in New Zealand into the effectiveness and such trials were "ethically and practically very difficult to carry out."&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_5264564"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/5264564/Chemicals-don-t-always-stop-sex-offenders |title=Chemicals don't always stop sex offenders |author=Francis, Clio |date=11 July 2011 |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]] |accessdate=23 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
In October 2011, the Russian parliament approved a law that allows a court-requested forensic psychiatrist to prescribe the chemical castration of convicted sex offenders who have harmed children under the age of 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://rt.com/news/pedophilia-russia-chemical-castration-059/ | work=RT | title=Russia introduces chemical castration for pedophiles | date=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===
In July 2011, South Korea enacted a law allowing judges the power to sentence sex offenders who have attacked children under the age of 16 to chemical castration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/07/24/idINIndia-58423020110724 | work=Reuters | title=S. Korea enacts 'chemical castration' law to punish paedophiles | date=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law also allows for chemical castration to be ordered by a Ministry of Justice committee. On May 23, 2012, a serial sex offender legally called Park in the court case was ordered by the committee to undergo this treatment after his most recent attempted offense. On January 3, 2013, a South Korean court sentenced a 31-year-old man to 15 years in jail and chemical castration, the country's first-ever chemical castration sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Hindu| url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/south-korean-court-orders-first-chemical-castration/article4269112.ece |title=South Korean court orders first chemical castration|date=3 January 2013|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://nwww.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20130103000795 | work=Korea Herald| title=Court issues 1st chemical castration sentence | date=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, feminist-backed Moon Jaein administration expanded the sentencing to include all forms of rapes and sexual assault cases against women, including attempted rape.

In South Korea, taking pictures of women without their consent, even in public, is considered to be criminal [[sexual assault]], punishable by a fine of under 10 million [[South Korean won|won]] and up to 5 years' imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.go.kr/%EB%B2%95%EB%A0%B9/%EC%84%B1%ED%8F%AD%EB%A0%A5%EB%B2%94%EC%A3%84%EC%9D%98%20%EC%B2%98%EB%B2%8C%20%EB%93%B1%EC%97%90%20%EA%B4%80%ED%95%9C%20%ED%8A%B9%EB%A1%80%EB%B2%95 "South Korean law on criminal sexual assault, Chapter 1 Article 14"]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017 an amendment to the law was voted on in favour of allowing for chemical castration of people taking such photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edaily.co.kr/news/NewsRead.edy?newsid=01298886615999112&amp;SCD=JG31&amp;DCD=A00703|title=`몰카 찰칵했다간 철컹`…몰카범도 화학적 거세한다|first1=Ⓒ 종합 경제정보 미디어 이데일리-상업적|last1=무단전재|first2=재배포|last2=금지|date=28 July 2017|website=edaily|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment did not pass.

===United States===
In 1966, John Money became the first American to employ chemical castration by prescribing [[medroxyprogesterone acetate]] (MPA, the base ingredient now used in [[Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate|DMPA]]) as a treatment for a patient dealing with pedophilic urges.  The drug has thereafter become a mainstay of chemical castration in America. Despite its long history and established use, the drug has never been approved by the FDA for use as a treatment for sexual offenders.&lt;ref name=JAAPL /&gt;

California was the first U.S. state to specify the use of chemical castration as a punishment for [[child molestation]], following the passage of a modification to Section 645 of the [[California]] [[penal code]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="califsenate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sen.ca.gov/ftp/SEN/COMMITTEE/STANDING/PUBLICSAFETY/bills/_6bill12.htm |title=XII.

The passage of this law led to similar laws in other states such as Florida's Statute Section 794.0235 which was passed into law in 1997.&lt;ref name="floridalawreview"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Florida's 1997 Chemical Castration Law: A Return to the Dark Ages |first=Larry Helm |last=Spalding |journal=[[Florida State University Law Review]] |year=1998 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=117–139 |url=http://neuro.bcm.edu/eagleman/neurolaw/papers/&amp;#91;Spalding&amp;#93;FloridasChemicalCastrationLaw.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613193448/http://neuro.bcm.edu/eagleman/neurolaw/papers/%5BSpalding%5DFloridasChemicalCastrationLaw.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As in California, treatment is mandatory after a second offense.

At least seven other states, including [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Iowa]], [[Louisiana]], [[Montana]], [[Oregon]], [[Texas]] and [[Wisconsin]], have experimented with chemical castration.&lt;ref name=JAAPL /&gt; In Iowa, as in California and Florida, offenders may be sentenced to chemical castration in all cases involving serious sex offenses.  On June 25, 2008, following the Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Kennedy v. Louisiana]]'' that the execution of child rapists where the victim was not killed was ruled unconstitutional,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rossmeier |first=Vincent |title=Jindal approves castration for sex offenders |url=http://www.salon.com/2008/06/26/jindal_castration/ |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |publisher=Salon Media Group |accessdate=October 20, 2013 |date=June 26, 2008 |quote=On Wednesday, the Supreme Court ruled that it's unconstitutional to execute someone for a case of child rape "where the victim's life was not taken."

====Objections====

The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] of [[Florida]] opposes the administration of any drug that is dangerous or has significant irreversible effect as an alternative to incarceration; however, they do not oppose the use of antiandrogen drugs for sex offenders under carefully controlled circumstances as an alternative to incarceration.&lt;ref name="aclufl"&gt;{{cite journal| publisher=Florida State University Law Review | title=Florida's 1997 Chemical Castration Law: A Return to the Dark Ages | author=Larry Helm Spalding | volume=25:117 | pages=124 | url=https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=3B15&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=25+Fla.+St.+U.L.+Rev.+117&amp;key=764569c9c4bb55ecfefa69a00154ff9d | quote=Furthermore, the ACLU of Florida opposes any attempt to offer a defendant the opportunity to avoid incarceration by taking a drug that is dangerous or that has a significant irreversible effect on an individual’s cognitive capacity or an important physical function, such as the ability to conceive children.  The ACLU of Florida does not oppose the use of antiandrogen drugs under certain controlled circumstances as an alternative to incarceration for convicted sex offenders. Because the ACLU of Florida respects individual autonomy and supports the principle that punishment should be no more restrictive of liberty than necessary, an individual’s choice of whether to accept an antiandrogen drug is entitled to considerable respect. In addition, because this choice arises in the inherently coercive context of sentencing, and because of the capacity for abuse of this sentencing option, such treatment should be available only under the most carefully controlled circumstances. | date=1998| access-date=March 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Law professor John Stinneford has argued that chemical castration is a cruel and unusual punishment because it exerts control over the mind of sex offenders to render them incapable of sexual desire and subjects them to the physical changes caused by the female hormones used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=918271|title=Incapacitation through Maiming: Chemical Castration, the Eighth Amendment, and the Denial of Human Dignity|first=John F.|last=Stinneford|date=20 July 2006|website=Paoers.ssrn.com|accessdate=16 September 2017|via=papers.ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people have argued that, based on the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]], the procedure fails to guarantee equal protection: although the laws mandating the treatment do so without respect to gender, the actual effect of the procedure disproportionately falls upon men.&lt;ref name=JAAPL&gt;[http://www.jaapl.org/cgi/reprint/31/4/502.pdf "Castration of Sex Offenders: Prisoners’ Rights Versus Public Safety"] Charles L. Scott, MD, and Trent Holmberg, MD&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of voluntary statutes, the ability to give [[informed consent]] is also an issue; in 1984, the [[U.S. state]] of [[Michigan]]'s court of appeals held that mandating chemical castration as a condition of probation was unlawful on the grounds that the drug [[medroxyprogesterone acetate]] had not yet gained acceptance as being safe and reliable and also due to the difficulty of obtaining informed consent under these circumstances.&lt;ref name="JAAPL" /&gt;

==Treatment for cancer patients==
A major medical use of chemical castration is in the treatment of hormone-dependent cancers, such as some [[prostate cancer]], where it has largely replaced the practice of surgical castration.&lt;ref name="cruk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-help/type/prostate-cancer/treatment/hormone/about-hormone-therapy-for-prostate-cancer|title=About hormone therapy for prostate cancer|work=cancerresearchuk.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LIFEonADT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifeonadt.com/the-adt-book/|title=The ADT Book|work=Life on ADT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemical castration involves the administration of [[antiandrogen]] drugs, such as [[cyproterone acetate]], [[flutamide]], or [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist]]s.

[[File:Red_and_blue_pill.jpg|thumb|In the film ''[[The Matrix]]'', Neo is offered the option of consuming either [[Red pill and blue pill|the red pill or the blue pill]]. Picking the red pill would result in the truth of Neo's world being revealed to him, while picking the blue pill would allow him to continue in [[ignorance]]. Thus, Neo must judge the merits of the possible outcomes of his choice.]]

'''Choice''' involves [[decision making]]. It can include [[judging]] the merits of multiple [[wikt:option|option]]s and [[wikt:select|select]]ing one or more of them. One can make a choice between imagined options ("What would I do if...?") or between real options followed by the corresponding action. For example, a traveller might choose a route for a journey based on the [[preference]] of arriving at a given destination as soon as possible. The preferred (and therefore chosen) route can then follow from information such as the length of each of the possible routes, traffic conditions, etc. The arrival at a choice can include more complex motivators such as [[cognition]], [[instinct]], and [[feeling]].

Simple choices might include what to eat for dinner or what to wear on a Saturday morning – choices that have relatively low-impact on the chooser's [[personal life|life]] overall. More complex choices might involve (for example) what candidate to vote for in an election, what profession to pursue, a life partner, etc. – choices based on multiple influences and having larger ramifications.

Freedom of choice is generally cherished, whereas a severely limited or artificially restricted choice can lead to discomfort with choosing, and possibly an unsatisfactory outcome. In contrast, a choice with excessively numerous options may lead to confusion, regret of the alternatives not taken, and indifference in an unstructured existence;&lt;ref&gt;
Barry Schwartz: ''[[The Paradox of Choice]]'' (2004)
&lt;/ref&gt;
and the illusion that choosing an object or a course, necessarily leads to the control of that object or course, can cause [[psychological]] problems.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Types==
There are four main types of decisions, although they can be expressed in different ways. [[Brian Tracy]] breaks them down into:&lt;ref&gt;''Time Power'', Brian Tracy, 2007, pg. 153 {{ISBN|0-8144-7470-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Command decisions, which can only be made by you, as the "Commander in Chief"; or owner of a company.
# Delegated decisions, which may be made by anyone, such as the [[color of the bike shed]], and should be delegated, as the decision must be made but the choice is inconsequential.
# Avoided decisions, where the outcome could be so severe that the choice should not be made, as the consequences can not be recovered from if the wrong choice is made. This will most likely result in negative actions, such as death.
# "No-brainer" decisions, where the choice is so obvious that only one choice can reasonably be made.
A fifth type, however, or fourth if avoided and "no-brainer" decisions are combined as one type, is the [[collaborative]] decision, which should be made in consultation with, and by agreement of others. Collaborative Decision Making revolutionized air-traffic safety by not deferring to the [[Pilot in command|captain]] when a lesser crew member becomes aware of a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdm.fly.faa.gov/|title=CDM CDM - Collaborative Decision Making|author=|date=|website=cdm.fly.faa.gov|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way of looking at decisions focuses on the thought mechanism used, is the decision:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decision-making-confidence.com/types-of-decision-making.html|title=Types of decision making - an overview|work=decision-making-confidence.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rational
* Intuitive
* Recognition based
* Combination

Recognizing that "type" is an imprecise term, an alternate way to classify types of choices is to look at outcomes and the impacted entity. For example, using this approach three types of choices would be:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decision-making-solutions.com/types_of_decision_making.html|title=Types of Decision Making|work=decision-making-solutions.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Business 
* Personal
* Consumer

In this approach, establishing the types of choices makes it possible to identify the related decisions that will influence and constrain a specific choice as well as be influenced and constrained by another choice.

There are many "executive decision maker" products available, such as the decision wheels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decision-making-confidence.com/decision-wheels.html|title=A variety of decision wheels!|work=decision-making-confidence.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Magic 8-Ball]], which randomly produce yes/no or other "decisions" for someone who cannot make up their mind or just wants to delegate.

A [[ouija]] board is also a delegated decision.

As a moral principle, decisions should be made by those most affected by the decision, but this is not normally applied to persons in jail, who might likely make a decision other than to remain in jail.&lt;ref&gt;''Ethical leadership in schools'', Kenneth A. Strike, 2006, pg. 5 {{ISBN|1-4129-1351-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Gates]] cited this principle in allowing photographs of returning war dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2009/02/pentagon_report.html|title=Pentagon ends photo ban on war dead return|author=|date=|website=boston.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluability in economics==
When choosing between options one must make judgments about the quality of each option's attributes. For example, if one is choosing between candidates for a job, the quality of relevant attributes such as previous work experience, college or high school GPA, and letters of recommendation will be judged for each option and the decision will likely be based on these attribute judgments. However, each attribute has a different level of ''evaluability'', that is, the extent to which one can use information from that attribute to make a judgment.

An example of a highly evaluable attribute is the SAT score. It is widely known in the United States that an SAT score below 800 is very bad while an SAT score above 1500 is exceptionally good. Because the distribution of scores on this attribute is relatively well known it is a highly evaluable attribute. Compare the SAT score to a poorly evaluable attribute, such as the number of hours spent doing homework. Most employers would not know what 10,000 hours spent doing homework means because they have no idea of the distribution of scores of potential workers in the population on this attribute.

As a result, evaluability can cause preference reversals between joint and separate evaluations. For example, Hsee, [[George Loewenstein]], Blount &amp; Bazerman (1999)&lt;ref&gt;Hsee, C.K., Loewenstein, G.F., Blount, S., Bazerman, M.H. (1999). Preference reversals between joint and separate evaluations of option: A review and theoretical analysis. Psychological Bulletin 125(5), 576–590.&lt;/ref&gt; looked at how people choose between options when they are directly compared because they are presented at the same time or when they cannot be compared because one is only given a single option. The canonical example is a hiring decision made about two candidates being hired for a programming job. Subjects in an experiment were asked to give a starting salary to two candidates, Candidate J and Candidate S. However, some viewed both candidates at the same time (joint evaluation), whereas others only viewed one candidate (separate evaluation). Candidate J had experience of 70 KY programs, and a GPA of 2.5, whereas Candidate S had experience of 10 KY programs and a GPA of 3.9. The results showed that in joint evaluation both candidates received roughly the same starting salary from subjects, who apparently thought a low GPA but high experience was approximately equal to a high GPA but low experience. However, in the separate evaluation, subjects paid Candidate S, the one with the high GPA, substantially more money. The explanation for this is that KY programs is an attribute that is difficult to evaluate and thus people cannot base their judgment on this attribute in separate evaluation.

Personal factors determine food choice. They are [[preference]], [[association (psychology)|associations]], [[habit (psychology)|habits]], [[ethnic heritage]], [[tradition]], [[value (personal and cultural)|values]], [[social pressure]], [[emotion|emotional comfort]], [[availability]], [[convenience]], [[economy]], [[image]], [[medical conditions]], and [[nutrition]].

==Number of options and paradox==
A number of research studies in economic psychology have focused on how individual behavior differs when the choice set size (the number of choices to choose from) is low versus when it is high. Of particular interest is whether individuals are more likely to purchase a product from a large versus a small choice set. Currently, the effect of choice set size on the probability of a purchase is unclear. In some cases, large choice set sizes discourage individuals from making a choice&lt;ref&gt;Iyengar and Lepper.&lt;/ref&gt; and in other cases it either encourages them or has no effect.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Norwood, Lusk, Arunachalam, and Henneberry.&lt;/ref&gt; One study compared the allure of more choice to the tyranny of too much choice. Individuals went virtual shopping in different stores that had a randomly determined set of choices ranging from 4 to 16, with some being good choices and some being bad. Researchers found a stronger effect for the allure of more choice. However, they speculate that due to random assignment of number of choices and goodness of those choices, many of the shops with fewer choices included zero or only one option that was reasonably good, which may have made it easier to make an acceptable choice when more options were available.&lt;ref&gt;White, C. M., &amp; Hoffrage, U. (2009). Testing the tyranny of too much choice against the allure of more choice. Psychology &amp; Marketing, 26(3), 280-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some evidence that while greater choice has the potential to improve a person's welfare, sometimes there is such a thing as too much choice. For example, in one experiment involving a choice of free soda, individuals explicitly requested to choose from six as opposed to 24 sodas, where the only benefit from the smaller choice set would be to reduce the cognitive burden of the choice.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; A recent study supports this research, finding that human services workers indicated preferences for scenarios with limited options over extensive-options scenarios. As the number of choices within the extensive-options scenarios increased, the preference for limited options increased as well.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, D. D., DiGennaro Reed, F. D., Chok, J., &amp; Brozyna, G. A. (2011). The 'tyranny of choice': Choice overload as a possible instance of effort discounting. The Psychological Record, 61(4), 547-60.&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to explain why choice can demotivate someone from a purchase have focuses on two factors. One assumes that perusing a larger number of choices imposes a cognitive burden on the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Norwood&lt;/ref&gt; The other assumes that individuals can experience [[regret (emotion)|regret]] if they make a suboptimal choice, and sometimes avoid making a choice to avoid experiencing regret.&lt;ref&gt;Irons and Hepburn.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further research has expanded on [[choice overload]], suggesting that there is a [[paradox of choice]]. As increasing options are available, three problems emerge. First, there is the issue of gaining adequate information about the choices in order to make a decision. Second, having more choices leads to an escalation of expectation. When there are increased options, people's standards for what is an acceptable outcome rise; in other words, choice “spoils you.” Third, with many options available, people may come to believe they are to blame for an unacceptable result because with so many choices, they should have been able to pick the best one. If there is one choice available, and it ends up being disappointing, the world can be held accountable. When there are many options and the choice that one makes is disappointing, the individual is responsible.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, B. (2000). Self-determination: The tyranny of freedom. American Psychologist, 55(1), 79-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a recent meta-analysis of the literature on choice overload calls such studies into question (Scheibehenne, Greigeneder, and Todd, 2010). In many cases, researchers have found no effect of choice set size on people's beliefs, feelings, and behavior. Indeed, overall, the effect of "too many options" is minimal at best.

While it might be expected that it is preferable to keep one's options open, research has shown that having the opportunity to revise one's decisions leaves people less satisfied with the decision outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Daniel T., Ebert, Jane E. J. (2002). Decisions and revisions: The affective forecasting of changeable outcomes. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. 82(4). 503-14.&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study found that participants experienced higher regret after having made a reversible decision. The results suggest that reversible decisions cause people to continue to think about the still relevant choice options, which might increase dissatisfaction with the decision and regret.&lt;ref&gt;Bullens, L., van Harreveld, F., &amp; Förster, J. (2011). Keeping one's options open: The detrimental consequences of decision reversibility. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 47(4), 800-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual personality plays a significant role in how individuals deal with large choice set sizes. Psychologists have developed a personality test that determines where an individual lies on the satisficer-maximizer spectrum. A maximizer is one who always seeks the very best option from a choice set, and may anguish after the choice is made as to whether it was indeed the best. Satisficers may set high standards but are content with a good choice, and place less priority on making the best choice. Due to this different approach to decision-making, maximizers are more likely to avoid making a choice when the choice set size is large, probably to avoid the anguish associated with not knowing whether their choice was optimal.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; One study looked at whether the differences in choice satisfaction between the two are partially due to a difference in willingness to commit to one's choices. It found that maximizers reported a stronger preference for retaining the ability to revise choices. Additionally, after making a choice to buy a poster, satisficers offered higher ratings of their chosen poster and lower ratings of the rejected alternatives. Maximizers, however, were less likely to change their impressions of the posters after making their choice which left them less satisfied with their decision.&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, E. A., Ehrlinger, J., &amp; Eibach, R. P. (2012). Failing to commit: Maximizers avoid commitment in a way that contributes to reduced satisfaction. Personality And Individual Differences, 52(1), 72-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maximizers are less happy in life, perhaps due to their obsession with making optimal choices in a society where people are frequently confronted with choice.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Barry&lt;/ref&gt; One study found that maximizers reported significantly less [[life satisfaction]], happiness, optimism, and self-esteem, and significantly more regret and depression, than did satisficers. In regards to buying products, maximizers were less satisfied with consumer decisions and were more regretful. They were also more likely to engage in social comparison, where they analyze their relative social standing among their peers, and to be more affected by social comparisons in which others appeared to be in higher standing than them. For example, maximizers who saw their peer solve puzzles faster than themselves expressed greater doubt about their own abilities and showed a larger increase in negative mood.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, B., Ward, A., Monterosso, J., Lyubomirsky, S., White, K., &amp; Lehman, D. R. (2002). Maximizing versus satisficing: Happiness is a matter of choice. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 83(5) 1178-97.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, people who refrain from taking better choices through drugs or other forms of escapism tend to be much happier in life.

Others{{Who|date=May 2013}} say that there is never too much choice and that there is a difference between happiness and satisfaction: a person who tries to find better decisions will often be dissatisfied, but not necessarily unhappy since his attempts at finding better choices did improve his lifestyle (even if it wasn't the ''best decision'' he will continually try to ''incrementally improve'' the decisions he takes).

[[Choice architecture]] is the process of encouraging people to make good choices through grouping and ordering the decisions in a way that maximizes successful choices and minimizes the number of people who become so overwhelmed by complexity that they abandon the attempt to choose. Generally, success is improved by presenting the smaller or simpler choices first, and by choosing and promoting sensible default options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sheena Iyengar |title=The Art of Choosing |publisher=Twelve |location= |year=2010 |pages=208–213 |isbn=0-446-50410-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to identity==
[[File:Headresser.jpg|thumb|Choosing a hairstyle.]]
Certain choices, as personal preferences, can be central to expressing one's concept of [[self-identity]] or values. In general, the more utilitarian an item, the less the choice says about a person's self-concept. Purely functional items, such as a [[fire extinguisher]], may be chosen solely for function alone, but non-functional items, such as music, clothing fashions, or home decorations, may instead be chosen to express a person's concept of self-identity or associated values.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Compulsory sterilization''', also known as '''forced''' or '''coerced sterilization''', programs are government policies which force people to undergo surgical or other [[Human sterilization|sterilization]]. The reasons governments implement sterilization programs vary in purpose and intent.&lt;ref name="who-2014"&gt;[http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/gender_rights/eliminating-forced-sterilization/en/ Eliminating forced, coercive and otherwise involuntary sterilization: An interagency statement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711130919/http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/gender_rights/eliminating-forced-sterilization/en/ |date=2015-07-11 }}, [[World Health Organization]], May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of the 20th century, several such programs were instituted in countries around the world, usually as part of [[eugenics]] programs intended to prevent the reproduction of members of the population considered to be carriers of defective [[Genetics|genetic]] traits.&lt;ref&gt;Webster University, Forced Sterilization. Retrieved on August 30, 2014. {{cite web |url=http://www2.webster.edu/~woolflm/forcedsterilization.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907114059/http://www2.webster.edu/~woolflm/forcedsterilization.html |archivedate=2015-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other bases for compulsory sterilization have included general population growth management, sex discrimination, "sex-normalizing" surgeries of [[intersex]] persons, limiting the spread of HIV,&lt;ref name="who-2014" /&gt; and reducing the population of ethnic groups. The last is counted as an act of genocide under the [[Statute of Rome]]. Some countries require transgender people to undergo sterilization before [[Legal aspects of transsexualism|gaining legal recognition of their gender]], a practice that [[Juan E. Méndez]], the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] on [[Convention Against Torture|torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment]] cites as a violation of the [[Yogyakarta Principles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/Regularsession/Session22/A.HRC.22.53_English.pdf|format=PDF|title=Report of the Special Rapporteur on Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (A/HRC/22/53)|at=para.&amp;nbsp;78|publisher=Ohchr.org|accessdate=2013-10-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160824161117/http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session22/A.HRC.22.53_English.pdf|archivedate=2016-08-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compulsory sterilization has been proposed as a means of [[human population planning]].

==Affected populations==

In May 2014, the [[World Health Organization]], [[OHCHR]], [[UN Women]], [[UNAIDS]], [[UNDP]], [[UNFPA]] and [[UNICEF]] issued a joint statement on ''Eliminating forced, coercive and otherwise involuntary sterilization, An interagency statement''. The report references the involuntary sterilization of a number of specific population groups. They include:

* [[Women]], especially in relation to coercive population control policies, and particularly including women living with [[HIV]], indigenous and ethnic minority girls and women. Indigenous and ethnic minority women often face "wrongful stereotyping based on gender, race and ethnicity".
** Funding of welfare mothers by HEW (Health, Education, and Welfare) covers roughy 90% of cost and doctors are likely to concur with the compulsory sterilization of welfare mothers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dear Sisters|last=Baxandall|first=Rosalyn|last2=Gordon|first2=Linda|publisher=Basic Books|year=2000|isbn=978-0-465-01707-2|location=New York, NY|pages=151–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Threats to cease welfare occur when women do are hesitant to consent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* [[Disabled people]], often perceived as asexual. Women with intellectual disabilities are "often treated as if they have no control, or should have no control, over their sexual and reproductive choices". Other rationales include menstrual management for "women who have or are perceived to have difficulties coping with or managing menses, or whose health conditions (such as epilepsy) or behaviour are negatively affected by menses."
* [[Intersex]] persons, who "are often subjected to cosmetic and other non-medically indicated surgeries performed on their reproductive organs, without their informed consent or that of their parents, and without taking into consideration the views of the children involved", often as a "sex-normalizing" treatment.
* [[Transgender]] persons, "as a prerequisite to receiving gender-affirmative treatment and gender-marker changes".

The report recommends a range of guiding principles for medical treatment, including ensuring patient autonomy in decision-making, ensuring non-discrimination, accountability and access to remedies.&lt;ref name="who-2014" /&gt;

== As a part of human population planning ==
[[Human population planning]] is the practice of artificially altering the rate of growth of a human population. Historically, human population planning has been implemented by limiting the population's [[birth rate]], usually by government mandate, and has been undertaken as a response to factors including high or increasing levels of [[poverty]], [[carrying capacity|environmental concerns]], [[religion|religious reasons]], and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]]. While population planning can involve measures that improve people's lives by giving them greater control of their reproduction, some programs have exposed them to exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.populationconcern.org.uk/free_downloads.asp |title=Interact Worldwide Downloads |publisher=Interact Worldwide |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115221710/http://www.populationconcern.org.uk/free_downloads.asp |archivedate=November 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1977 textbook ''[[Ecoscience: Population, Resources, Environment]]'', the authors discussed in this encyclopedic textbook the possible role of a wide variety of formulations to address human overpopulation. This included the possibility of compulsory sterilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Egnor |url=http://www.evolutionnews.org/2009/08/the_inconvenient_truth_about_p023831.html |title=The Inconvenient Truth About Population Control, Part 2; Science Czar John Holdren's Endorsement of Involuntary Sterilization |website=evolutionnews.org |date=August 14, 2009 |access-date=October 3, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005193751/http://www.evolutionnews.org/2009/08/the_inconvenient_truth_about_p023831.html |archivedate=October 5, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A government might utilize [[sortition]] to select those to be sterilized in order to avoid accusations of bias or having any other adverse agenda. In ''Ecoscience'', in the chapter entitled "The Human Predicament: Finding A Way Out", the authors speculate about pharmaceuticals that might be developed to sterilize people. Some partial fulfillments of these predictions are the birth control drugs in [[Norplant]] and [[Depo-Provera]]. See also [[sterilization (medicine)#Pharmacological]]. One can further speculate about pharmaceuticals designed to permanently sterilize the gestating human fetus ''in utero''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/projects/pdf/072109_holdren2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110095317/http://www.foxnews.com/projects/pdf/072109_holdren2.pdf/ |archivedate=2016-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By country==

=== International law ===
The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul Convention]] prohibits forced sterilization (Article 39).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://rm.coe.int/168046031c |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531114057/https://rm.coe.int/168046031c |archivedate=2017-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Widespread or systematic forced sterilization has been recognized as a [[Crime against Humanity]] by the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] in the explanatory memorandum.

=== Bangladesh ===

[[Bangladesh]] has a long running government operated civilian exploitative [[sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]] program as a part of its population control policy, where poor women and men are mainly targeted. The government offers 2000 [[Bangladeshi taka|Bangladeshi Taka]] (24 USD) for the woman who are persuaded to undergo [[tubal ligation]] and for the man who are persuaded to undergo [[vasectomy]]. Women are also offered a [[sari]] (a [[garment]] worn by women in [[Indian subcontinent]]) and men are offered a [[lungi]] (a [[garment]] for men) to wear for undergoing sterilization. The referrer, who persuades the woman or man to undergo sterilization gets 300 Bangladeshi Taka (3.60 USD).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uttarkhanup.dhaka.gov.bd/site/field_office/3354b838-2016-11e7-8f57-286ed488c766|title=পরিবার পরিকল্পনা {{!}} উত্তরখান ইউনিয়ন {{!}} উত্তরখান ইউনিয়ন|website=uttarkhanup.dhaka.gov.bd|language=en|access-date=2017-11-11|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171112185603/http://uttarkhanup.dhaka.gov.bd/site/field_office/3354b838-2016-11e7-8f57-286ed488c766|archivedate=2017-11-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, the targeted number of sterilizations per month was 600-1000 in contrast to the insertion of 25,000 [[IUDs]], which was increased in 1978 to about 50,000 sterilizations per month on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=AR|first=Khan|last2=I|first2=Swenson|date=1978|title=Acceptability of male sterilization in Bangladesh: its problems and perspectives|url=https://www.popline.org/node/444385|journal=Bangladesh Development Studies|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113002952/https://www.popline.org/node/444385|archivedate=2017-11-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 50% rise in the amount paid to men coincided with a doubling of the number of vasectomies between 1980 and 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=L|first=Liskin|last2=JM|first2=Pile|last3=WF|first3=Quillan|date=1983|title=Vasectomy--safe and simple|url=https://www.popline.org/node/402465|journal=Population Reports.

The person's sex, the sponsor and workload in the sterilization center, and the dose of [[sedative]]s administered to women were significantly associated with specific postoperative complaints. Five women died during the study, resulting in a death-to-case rate of 9.9/10,000 [[Tubal ligation|tubectomies]] (tubal ligations); four deaths were due to [[respiratory arrest]] caused by overuse of sedatives. The death-to-case rate of 9.9/10,000 tubectomies (tubal ligation) in this study is similar to the 10.0 deaths/10,000 cases estimated on the basis of a 1979 follow-up study in an Indian female sterilization camp. The presence of a complaint before the operation was generally a good predictor of postoperative complaints.

[[Bangladesh]] is planning to introduce sterilization program in its overcrowded [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]] refugee camps, where nearly a million refugees are fighting for space, after efforts to encourage birth control failed. Since 25 August 2017, more than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have been fled from [[Rakhine State|Rakhine]] state, [[Myanmar]] to neighboring Bangladesh, which is a Muslim majority country, following a military crackdown against [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]] Muslims in Rakhine state, Myanmar. Sabura, a Rohingya mother of seven, said her husband believed the couple could support a large family.

“I spoke to my husband about birth control measures. But he is not convinced. He was given two condoms but he did not use them,” she said.

“My husband said we need more children as we have land and property (in [[Rakhine State|Rakhine]]). We don’t have to worry to feed them,” she said.

District family planning authorities have managed to distribute just 549 packets of condoms among the refugees, amid reports they are reluctant to use them. They have asked the government to approve a plan to provide [[Vasectomy|vasectomies]] for men and [[Tubal ligation|tubectomies]] (tubal ligation) for women in the camps.

One volunteer, Farhana Sultana, said the women she spoke to believed birth control was a sin and others saw it as against the tenets of Islam.

Bangladeshi officials say about 20,000 [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]] refugee women are pregnant and 600 have given birth since arriving in the country, but this may not be accurate as many births take place without formal medical help.

Every month 250 [[Bangladeshis|Bangladeshi]] people undergo sterilization routinely under government's sterilization program in the border town of [[Cox's Bazar District|Cox’s Bazar]], where the [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]] refugee Muslims have taken shelter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/28/bangladesh-to-offer-sterilisation-to-rohingya-in-refugee-camps|title=Bangladesh to offer sterilisation to Rohingya in refugee camps|last=France-Presse|first=Agence|date=2017-10-28|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-12|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171104150415/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/28/bangladesh-to-offer-sterilisation-to-rohingya-in-refugee-camps|archivedate=2017-11-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/bangladesh-sterilise-rohingya-muslims-population-burma-refugee-camps-a8026076.html|title=Bangladesh ‘plans to offer to sterilise Rohingya Muslims’ as refugee population grows|date=2017-10-29|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-11-12|language=en-GB|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113003155/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/bangladesh-sterilise-rohingya-muslims-population-burma-refugee-camps-a8026076.html|archivedate=2017-11-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Compulsory sterilization in Canada}}

Two Canadian provinces ([[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]]) performed compulsory sterilization programs in the 20th century with eugenic aims. Canadian compulsory sterilization operated via the same overall mechanisms of [[institutionalization]], [[judgment]], and [[surgery]] as the American system. However, one notable difference is in the treatment of non-insane criminals. Canadian legislation never allowed for punitive sterilization of inmates.

The [[Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta]] was enacted in 1928 and repealed in 1972. In 1995, [[Leilani Muir]] sued the Province of Alberta for forcing her to be sterilized against her will and without her permission in 1959. Since Muir’s case, the Alberta government has apologized for the forced sterilization of over 2,800 people. Nearly 850 Albertans who were sterilized under the Sexual Sterilization Act were awarded C$142 million in damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)|title=Alberta Apologizes for Forced Sterilization|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/1999/11/02/sterilize991102.html|accessdate=June 19, 2013|date=November 9, 1999|work=[[CBC News]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123020740/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/1999/11/02/sterilize991102.html|archivedate=November 23, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1VoyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kecFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5397%2C1039102 Victims of sterilization finally get day in court.

Over 60 women are involved in a lawsuit in this case.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-november-13-2018-1.4902679/indigenous-women-kept-from-seeing-their-newborn-babies-until-agreeing-to-sterilization-says-lawyer-1.4902693&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/18/canada-indigenous-women-coerced-sterlilization-class-action-lawsuit Human rights groups call on Canada to end coerced sterilization of indigenous women] The Guardian, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
In 1978, Chinese authorities became concerned with the possibility of a baby boom that the country could not handle, and they initialized the [[one-child policy]]. In order to effectively deal with the complex issues surrounding childbirth, the Chinese government placed great emphasis on family planning. Because this was such an important matter, the government thought it needed to be standardized, and so to this end laws were introduced in 2002.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International"&gt;{{Cite news | title=Thousands at risk of forced sterilization in China | date=April 22, 2010 | accessdate=April 9, 2012 | publisher=[[Amnesty International]] | url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/thousands-risk-forced-sterilization-china-2010-04-22 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314193515/http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/thousands-risk-forced-sterilization-china-2010-04-22 | archivedate=March 14, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These laws uphold the basic tenets of what was previously put into practice, outlining the rights of the individuals and outlining what the Chinese government can and cannot do to enforce policy.

However, recently accusations have been raised from groups such as [[Amnesty International]], who have claimed that practices of compulsory sterilization have been occurring for people who have already reached their one child quota. These practices run contrary to the stated principles of the law, and seem to differ on a local level. An especially egregious example, according to Amnesty International, has been occurring in Puning City, [[Guangdong Province]]. The sterilization drive in this city was in accordance with regulations outlined by the government in the Population and Family Planning Law of 2002. This drive, also known as the [[Iron Fist Campaign]], also is said to have used coercive methods in order to ensure that close to 10,000 women were sterilized, including detaining elderly family members. It is unclear whether support of the increase of the now 90% Han Chinese majority here plays a role&lt;ref name="Amnesty International"/&gt;

The Chinese government appears to be aware of these discrepancies in policy implementation on a local level. For example, The National Population and Family Planning Commission put forth in a statement that, “Some persons concerned in a few counties and townships of Linyi did commit practices that violated law and infringed upon legitimate rights and interests of citizens while conducting family planning work.” This statement comes in reference to some charges of forced sterilization and abortions in Linyi city of Shandong Province.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=China acts on forced abortion | date=September 20, 2005 | accessdate=April 9, 2012 | publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4262890.stm | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210000256/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4262890.stm | archivedate=February 10, 2009 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it remains unclear to what extent the government has prosecuted or disciplined the officials in charge of family planning in the country.

The policy requires a "social compensation fee" for those who have more than the legal number of children. According to Forbes editor Heng Shao, critics claims this fee is a toll on the poor but not the rich.&lt;ref&gt;Enforcement of One-Child Policy Targets 'The Rich and Famous' in Zhangzhou, China, ''[[Forbes]]'', September 20, 2013. {{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/hengshao/2013/09/20/enforcement-of-one-child-policy-targets-the-rich-and-famous-in-zhangzhou-china/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909011431/https://www.forbes.com/sites/hengshao/2013/09/20/enforcement-of-one-child-policy-targets-the-rich-and-famous-in-zhangzhou-china/ |archivedate=2017-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are cases registered in the Chinese legal system (cf.

One of the first acts by [[Adolf Hitler]] after the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]] and the [[Enabling Act of 1933]] gave him de facto legal dictatorship over the [[Germany|German]] state was to pass the [[Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring]] (''Gesetz zur Verhütung erbkranken Nachwuchses'') in July 1933.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jkswAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XKgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3703%2C266241 Eugenics Courts Named in Reich.

Under it, all doctors in the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] were required to report any patients of theirs who were deemed [[intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]], characterized [[mentally ill]] (including [[schizophrenia]] and [[manic depression]]), [[epilepsy|epileptic]], blind, deaf, or physically deformed, and a steep monetary penalty was imposed for any patients who were not properly reported. Individuals suffering from [[alcoholism]] or [[Huntington's disease|Huntington's Disease]] could also be sterilized. The individual's case was then presented in front of a court of [[Nazism|Nazi]] officials and public health officers who would review their medical records, take testimony from friends and colleagues, and eventually decide whether or not to order a sterilization operation performed on the individual, using force if necessary. Though not explicitly covered by the law, 400 mixed-race "[[Rhineland Bastard]]s" were also sterilized beginning in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Proctor, ''Racial hygiene: Medicine under the Nazis'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1988), and Gisela Bock, "Nazi sterilization and reproductive policies" in Dieter Kuntz, ed., ''Deadly medicine: creating the master race'' (Washington, D.C.: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zzsbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=50wEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1710%2C6396277 Wallace R.

By the end of [[World War II]], over 400,000 individuals were sterilised under the German law and its revisions, most within its first four years of being enacted. When the issue of compulsory sterilisation was brought up at the [[Nuremberg trials]] after the war, many Nazis defended their actions on the matter by indicating that it was the United States itself from whom they had taken inspiration. The Nazis had many other eugenics-inspired [[racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial policies]], including their [[T-4 Euthanasia Programme|"euthanasia" programme]] in which around 70,000 people institutionalised or suffering from birth defects were killed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Kershaw]], ''Hitler: A Profile in Power'', Chapter VI, first section (London, 1991, rev. 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
India's state of emergency [[The Emergency (India)|between 1975 and 1977]] included a family planning initiative that began in April 1976 through which the government hoped to lower India's ever increasing population.

However, the program focused more on sterilizing women than men.

In the late 2000s, reports in the Israeli media claimed that injections of long-acting contraceptive Depo-Provera had been forced on hundreds of [[Ethiopian Jews in Israel|Ethiopian-Jewish immigrants]] both in transit camps in Ethiopia and after their arrival in Israel. In 2009, feminist NGO [[Haifa Women's Coalition]] published a first survey on the story, which was followed up by [[Israeli Educational Television]] a few years later. Ethiopian-Jewish women said they were intimidated or tricked into taking the shot every three months, sometimes presented to them as vaccine. In 2016 Israel's State Comptroller concluded his inquiry into the affair by claiming that injections of Depo-Provera had not been forced on the women; however, the Comptroller had refused to hear complainants' testimony, and his probe into the role of the [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee]] (JDC), whose activists had looked after the women in the Ethiopian transit camps, left open questions, since the JDC official who had handled family programming in Ethiopia refused to give the Comptroller any information.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-forced-birth-control-probe-wouldn-t-hear-complainants-testimony-1.5396634&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peru===
In [[Peru]], President [[Alberto Fujimori]] (in office from 1990 to 2000) has been accused of [[genocide]] and [[crimes against humanity]] as a result of the ''[[Programa Nacional de Población]]'', a sterilization program put in place by his administration.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{Cite news | title=Mass sterilization scandal shocks Peru | date=July 24, 2002 | accessdate=April 30, 2006 | publisher=[[BBC News]] | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2148793.stm | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630062037/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2148793.stm | archivedate=June 30, 2006 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his presidency, Fujimori put in place a program of forced sterilizations against [[Indigenous peoples in Peru|indigenous people]] (mainly the [[Quechua people|Quechuas]] and the [[Aymara people|Aymaras]]), in the name of a "[[public health]] plan", presented on July 28, 1995. The plan was principally financed using funds from [[USAID]] (36 million dollars), the [[Nippon Foundation]], and later, the [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA).&lt;ref name=Diplo&gt;[http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2004/05/BARTHELEMY/11190 Stérilisations forcées des Indiennes du Pérou] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510120620/http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2004/05/BARTHELEMY/11190 |date=2014-05-10 }}, ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', May 2004&lt;/ref&gt; On September 9, 1995, Fujimori presented a Bill that would revise the "General Law of Population", in order to allow sterilization. Several contraceptive methods were also legalized, all measures that were strongly opposed by the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], as well as the Catholic organization [[Opus Dei]]. In February 1996, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) itself congratulated Fujimori on his success in controlling demographic growth.&lt;ref name=Diplo/&gt;

On February 25, 1998, a representative for USAID testified before the U.S. government's [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|House Committee on International Relations]], to address controversy surrounding Peru's program. He indicated that the government of Peru was making important changes to the program, in order to:

* Discontinue their campaigns in tubal ligations and vasectomies.
* Make clear to health workers that there are no provider targets for voluntary surgical contraception or any other method of contraception.
* Implement a comprehensive monitoring program to ensure compliance with family planning norms and informed consent procedures.
* Welcome Ombudsman Office investigations of complaints received and respond to any additional complaints that are submitted as a result of the public request for any additional concerns.
* Implement a 72-hour "waiting period" for people who choose tubal ligation or vasectomy. This waiting period will occur between the second counseling session and surgery.
* Require health facilities to be certified as appropriate for performing surgical contraception as a means to ensure that no operations are done in makeshift or substandard facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USAID Testimony: House International Relations Committee, Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, 2/25/98|url=http://www.usaid.gov/press/spe_test/testimony/1998/test079.htm|publisher=USAID|accessdate=August 23, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906034940/http://www.usaid.gov/press/spe_test/testimony/1998/test079.htm|archivedate=September 6, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2001, Minister of Health [[Luis Solari De La Fuente|Luis Solari]] launched a special commission into the activities of the voluntary surgical contraception, initiating a parliamentary commission tasked with inquiring into the "irregularities" of the program, and to put it on an acceptable footing. In July 2002, its final report ordered by the Minister of Health revealed that between 1995 and 2000, 331,600 women were sterilized, while 25,590 men submitted to vasectomies.&lt;ref name="Diplo"/&gt; The plan, which had the objective of diminishing the number of births in areas of poverty within Peru, was essentially directed at the indigenous people living in deprived areas (areas often involved in internal conflicts with the Peruvian government, as with the [[Shining Path]] guerilla group). Deputy Dora Núñez Dávila made the accusation in September 2003 that 400,000 indigenous people were sterilized during the 1990s. Documents proved that President Fujimori was informed, each month, of the number of sterilizations done, by his former Ministers of Health, Eduardo Yong Motta (1994–96), Marino Costa Bauer (1996–1999) and [[Alejandro Aguinaga]] (1999–2000).&lt;ref name=Diplo/&gt; A study by sociologist {{ill|Giulia Tamayo León|es}}, ''Nada Personal'' (in English: Nothing Personal), showed that doctors were required to meet quotas. According to ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', "tubal ligation festivals" were organized through program publicity campaigns, held in the ''[[pueblos jóvenes]]'' (in English: shantytowns). In 1996 there were, according to official statistics, 81,762 tubal ligations performed on women, with a peak being reached the following year, with 109,689 ligatures, then only 25,995 in 1998.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

On October 21, 2011, Peru's Attorney General José Bardales decided to reopen an investigation into the cases, which had been halted in 2009 under the statute of limitations, after the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] ruled that President Fujimori’s sterilization program involved [[crimes against humanity]], which are not time-limited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://impunitywatch.com/?p=21794 Thousands of Forced Sterilization Cases Reopened in Peru] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426235249/http://impunitywatch.com/?p=21794 |date=2014-04-26 }} Impunity Watch, published November 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear as to any progress in matter of the execution (debido ejecución sumaria) of the suspect in the course of any proof of their relevant accusations in the legal sphere of the constituted people in vindication of the rights of the people of South America.

The eugenistic legislation was enacted in 1934 and was formally abolished in 1976. According to the 2000 governmental report, 21,000 were estimated to have been forcibly sterilized, 6,000 were coerced into a 'voluntary' sterilization while the nature of a further 4,000 cases could not be determined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regeringen.se/content/1/c4/28/64/212fc81a.pdf Steriliseringsfrågan i Sverige 1935 - 1975] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205055543/http://www.regeringen.se/content/1/c4/28/64/212fc81a.pdf |date=2012-02-05 }}, SOU 2000:20, in Swedish with an English summary.&lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish state subsequently paid out damages to victims who contacted the authorities and asked for compensation.

===Switzerland===
In October 1999, Margrith von Felten suggested to the [[National Council of Switzerland]] in the form of a general proposal to adopt legal regulations that would enable reparation for persons sterilized against their will. According to the proposal, reparation was to be provided to persons who had undergone the intervention without their consent or who had consented to sterilization under coercion.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} According to Margrith von Felten:
{{cquote|The history of eugenics in Switzerland remains insufficiently explored. Research programmes are in progress. However, individual studies and facts are already available. For example:

The report of the Institute for the History of Medicine and Public Health "Mental Disability and Sexuality. Legal sterilization in the [[Vaud]] Canton between 1928 and 1985" points out that coercive sterilizations took place until the 1980s, it is unclear if the ethnographic impact has been duly investigated and if Hun-descendant French have been affected, as well as prehistoric human descendant communities. The act on coercive sterilizations of the Vaud Canton was the first law of this kind in the European context.

Hans Wolfgang Maier, head of the Psychiatric Clinic in Zurich pointed out in a report from the beginning of the century that 70% to 80% of [[abortion|terminations]] were linked to sterilization by doctors. In the period from 1929 to 1931, 480 women and 15 men were sterilized in Zurich in connection with termination.

Following agreements between doctors and authorities such as the 1934 "Directive For Surgical Sterilization" of the Medical Association in Basle, eugenic indication to sterilization was recognized as admissible.

A statistical evaluation of the sterilizations performed in the Basle women's hospital between 1920 and 1934 shows a remarkable increase in sterilizations for a psychiatric indication after 1929 and a steep increase in 1934, when a coercive sterilization act came into effect in nearby National Socialist Germany.

A study by the Swiss Nursing School in Zurich, published in 1991, documents that 24 mentally disabled women aged between 17 and 25 years were sterilized between 1980 and 1987. Of these 24 sterilizations, just one took place at the young woman's request.

Having evaluated sources primarily from the 1930s (psychiatric files, official directives, court files, etc.), historians have documented that the requirement for free consent to sterilization was in most of cases not satisfied. Authorities obtained the "[[Informed consent|consent]]" required by the law partly by persuasion, and partly by enforcing it through coercion and threats. Thus the recipients of social benefits were threatened with removal of the benefits, women were exposed to a choice between placement in an institution or sterilization, and abortions were permitted only when women simultaneously consented to sterilization.

More than fifty years after ending the National Socialist dictatorship in Germany, in which racial murder, euthanasia and coerced sterilizations belonged to the political programme, it is clear that eugenics, with its idea of "[[life unworthy of life]]" and "racial purity" permeated even democratic countries. The idea that a "healthy nation" should be achieved through targeted medical/social measures was designed and politically implemented in many European countries and in the U.S.A in the first half of this century. It is a policy incomparable with the inconceivable horrors of the Nazi rule; yet it is clear that authorities and the medical community were guilty of the methods and measures applied, i.e. coerced sterilizations, prohibitions of marriages and child removals – serious violations of human rights.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}}}

Switzerland refused, however, to vote a reparations Act.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

The United States during the [[Progressive era]], ca. 1890 to 1920, was the first country to concertedly undertake compulsory sterilization programs for the purpose of [[eugenics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Iredale | first1 = Rachel | year = 2000 | title = Eugenics And Its Relevance To Contemporary Health Care | url = | journal = Nursing Ethics | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas C.

Eugenics had two essential components. First, its advocates accepted as axiomatic that a range of mental and physical handicaps—blindness, deafness, and many forms of mental illness—were largely, if not entirely, hereditary in cause. Second, they assumed that these scientific hypotheses could be used as the basis of social engineering across several policy areas, including family planning, education, and immigration. The most direct policy implications of eugenic thought were that “mental defectives” should not produce children, since they would only replicate these deficiencies, and that such individuals from other countries should be kept out of the polity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hansen, King|first=Randall, Desmond|date=Summer 2017|title=Eugenic Ideas, Political Interests, and Policy Variance: Immigration and Sterilization Policy in Britain and the U.S|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248650104|journal=World Politics|volume=53|pages=237–263|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809053048/https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Randall_Hansen/publication/248650104_Eugenic_Ideas_Political_Interests_and_Policy_Variance_Immigration_and_Sterilization_Policy_in_Britain_and_the_US/links/5548bc640cf27c5000668062/Eugenic-Ideas-Political-Interests-and-Policy-Variance-Immigration-and-Sterilization-Policy-in-Britain-and-the-US.pdf|archivedate=2017-08-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal targets of the American sterilization programs were the [[Intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]] and the [[Mental illness|mentally ill]], but also targeted under many state laws were the deaf, the blind, people with [[epilepsy]], and the physically deformed. While the claim was that the focus was mainly the mentally ill and disabled, the definition of this during that time was much different than today's. At this time, there were many women that were sent to institutions under the guise of being “[[feeble-minded]]" because they were promiscuous or became pregnant while unmarried.

Some sterilizations took place in [[Incarceration in the United States|prisons and other penal institutions]], targeting [[criminality]], but they were in the relative minority.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with [[Alexandra Stern|Alexandra Minna Stern]], Ph.D. of University of Michigan in Spanish newspaper [[El País]] published on 12 Julz 2013 [http://sociedad.elpais.com/sociedad/2013/07/12/actualidad/1373652806_358454.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715102459/http://sociedad.elpais.com/sociedad/2013/07/12/actualidad/1373652806_358454.html |date=2013-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, over 65,000 individuals were sterilized in 33 states under state compulsory sterilization programs in the United States, in all likelihood without the perspectives of ethnic minorities.&lt;ref name="Open WorldCat"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kevles|first=Daniel|title=In the name of eugenics: Genetics and the uses of human heredity|publisher=Knopf|location=New York|isbn=978-0-394-50702-6|edition=1st|date=April 12, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first state to introduce a compulsory sterilization bill was [[Michigan]], in 1897, but the proposed law failed to pass.

After [[World War II]], public opinion towards eugenics and sterilization programs became more negative in the light of the connection with the [[genocide|genocidal]] policies of [[Nazi Germany]], though a significant number of sterilizations continued in a few states through the 1970s. The [[Oregon]] Board of Eugenics, later renamed the Board of Social Protection, existed until 1983,&lt;ref name=oregonapology&gt;{{cite web |author=Governor John Kitzhaber |authorlink=John Kitzhaber |date=December 2, 2002 |title=Proclamation of Human Rights Day, and apology for Oregon's forced sterilization of institutionalized patients |url=http://archivedwebsites.sos.state.or.us/Governor_Kitzhaber_2003/governor/speeches/s021202.htm |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528024042/http://archivedwebsites.sos.state.or.us/Governor_Kitzhaber_2003/governor/speeches/s021202.htm |archivedate=May 28, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the last forcible sterilization occurring in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Julie Sullivan.

(Mirrored in ''Eugene Register-Guard'', November 16, 2002, at [[Google News]].)&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|commonwealth]] [[Puerto Rico]] had a sterilization program as well. Some states continued to have sterilization laws on the books for much longer after that, though they were rarely if ever used. California sterilized more than any other state by a wide margin, and was responsible for over a third of all sterilization operations. Information about the California sterilization program was produced into book form and widely disseminated by eugenicists [[E.S. Gosney]] and [[Paul B. Popenoe]], which was said by the government of [[Adolf Hitler]] to be of key importance in proving that large-scale compulsory sterilization programs were feasible.&lt;ref&gt;On California sterilizations and their connection to the Nazi program, see: Stefan Kühl, ''The Nazi connection: Eugenics, American racism, and German National Socialism'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1994); Alexandra Stern, ''Eugenic nation: faults and frontiers of better breeding in modern America'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005); and Wendy Kline, ''Building a better race: gender, sexuality, and eugenics from the turn of the century to the baby boom'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;
In recent years, the governors of many states have made public apologies for their past programs beginning with Virginia and followed by Oregon&lt;ref name=oregonapology/&gt; and California. Few have offered to compensate those sterilized, however, citing that few are likely still living (and would of course have no affected offspring) and that inadequate records remain by which to verify them. At least one compensation case, ''[[Poe v. Lynchburg Training School &amp; Hospital]]'' (1981), was filed in the courts on the grounds that the sterilization law was unconstitutional. It was rejected because the law was no longer in effect at the time of the filing. However, the petitioners were granted some compensation because the stipulations of the law itself, which required informing the patients about their operations, had not been carried out in many cases.

The [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] (ACOG) believes that mental disability is not a reason to deny sterilization.

Puerto Rican physician, Dr. Lanauze Rolón, founded the League for Birth Control in Ponce, [[Puerto Rico]] in 1925, but the League was quickly squashed by opposition from the [[Catholic church]].&lt;ref name=Mass&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mass|first1=Bonnie|title=Puerto Rico: a Case Study of Population Control|journal=Latin American Perspectives|date=January 1, 1977|volume=4|issue=4|pages=66–79|doi=10.1177/0094582x7700400405}}&lt;!--|accessdate=October 11, 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nick&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thimmesch|first1=Nick|title=Puerto Rico and Birth Control|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|date=May 1968|volume=30|issue=2|pages=252–262|doi=10.2307/349251|jstor=349251}}&lt;!--|accessdate=October 11, 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A similar League was founded seven years later, in 1932, in San Juan, Puerto Rico and continued in operation for two years before opposition and lack of support forced its closure.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nick" /&gt; Yet another effort at establishing birth control clinics was made in 1934 by the [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration]] in a relief response to the conditions of the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name="Nick" /&gt; As a part of this effort, 68 birth control clinics were opened on the island.&lt;ref name="Nick" /&gt; The next mass opening of clinics occurred in January 1937 when American Dr. [[Clarence Gamble]], in association with a group of wealthy and influential Puerto Ricans, organized the Maternal and Infant Health Association and opened 22 birth control clinics.&lt;ref name="Nick" /&gt;

The Governor of Puerto Rico, Menendez Ramos, enacted Law 116,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stanford.edu/group/womenscourage/cgi-bin/blogs/familyplanning/2008/10/23/forced-sterilization-in-puerto-rico/|title=Forced Sterilization in Puerto Rico " Family Planning|website=stanford.edu|access-date=2017-07-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170721113445/http://stanford.edu/group/womenscourage/cgi-bin/blogs/familyplanning/2008/10/23/forced-sterilization-in-puerto-rico/|archivedate=2017-07-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which went into effect on May 13, 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stanford.edu/group/womenscourage/cgi-bin/blogs/familyplanning/2008/10/30/puerto-rico-revisited/|title=Puerto Rico Revisited " Family Planning|website=stanford.edu|access-date=2017-07-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161208104209/http://stanford.edu/group/womenscourage/cgi-bin/blogs/familyplanning/2008/10/30/puerto-rico-revisited|archivedate=2016-12-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a [[birth control]] and eugenic [[sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]] law that allowed the dissemination of information regarding birth control methods as well as legalized the practice of birth control.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nick" /&gt; The government cited a growing population of the poor and unemployed as motivators for the law. Abortion remained heavily restricted. By 1965, approximately 34 percent of women of childbearing age had been sterilized, two thirds of whom were still in their early twenties The law was repealed on June 8, 1960.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;

=====1940s-1950s=====

Unemployment and widespread poverty would continue to grow in Puerto Rico in the 40s, threatening both U.S. private investment in Puerto Rico and acting as a deterrent for future investment.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; In an attempt to attract additional U.S. private investment in Puerto Rico, another round of liberalizing trade policies were implemented and referred to as “[[Operation Bootstrap]].”&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; Despite these policies and their relative success, unemployment and poverty in Puerto Rico remained high, high enough to prompt an increase in [[emigration]] from Puerto Rico to the United States between 1950 and 1955.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; The issues of [[immigration]], Puerto Rican poverty, and threats to U.S. private investment made population control concerns a prime political and social issue for the United States.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;

The 50s also saw the production of social science research supporting sterilization procedures in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; Princeton’s [[Office of Population Research]], in collaboration with the Social Research Department at the University of Puerto Rico, conducted interviews with couples regarding sterilization and other birth control.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; Their studies concluded that there was a significant need and desire for permanent birth control among Puerto Ricans.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; In response, Puerto Rico’s governor and Commissioner of health opened 160 private, temporary birth control clinics with the specific purpose of sterilization.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;

Also during this era, private birth control clinics were established in Puerto Rico with funds provided by wealthy Americans.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nick" /&gt; [[Joseph Sunnen]], a wealthy American Republican and industrialist, established the [[Sunnen Foundation]] in 1957.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nick" /&gt; The foundation funded new birth control clinics under the title “La Asociación Puertorriqueña el Biensestar de la Familia” and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in an experimental project to determine if a formulaic program could be used to control population growth in Puerto Rico and beyond.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;

=====Sterilization Procedures and [[Coercion]]=====
From beginning of the 1900s, U.S. and Puerto Rican governments espoused rhetoric connecting the poverty of Puerto Rico with overpopulation and the “hyper-fertility” of Puerto Ricans.&lt;ref name=Lopez&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lopez|first1=Iris|title=Agency And Constraint: Sterilization And Reproductive Freedom Among Puerto Rican Women In New York City|journal=Urban Anthropology and Studies of Cultural Systems and World Economic Development|date=1993|volume=22|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such rhetoric combined with eugenics ideology of reducing “population growth among a particular class or ethnic group because they are considered...a social burden,” was the philosophical basis for the 1937 birth control legislation enacted in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name= "Lopez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt; A Puerto Rican Eugenics Board, modeled after a similar board in the United States, was created as part of the bill, and officially ordered ninety-seven involuntary sterilizations.&lt;ref name=Briggs&gt;{{cite book|last1=Briggs|first1=Laura|title=Reproducing Empire: Race, Sex, Science, and U.S. Imperialism in Puerto Rico|date=2002|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, California|isbn=978-0-520-22255-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legalization of sterilization was followed by a steady increase in the popularity of the procedure, both among the Puerto Rican population and among physicians working in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt;&lt;ref name=B&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ramirez de Arellano|first1=Annette B.|last2=Seipp|first2=Conrad|title=Colonialism, Catholicism, and Contraception: A History of Birth Control in Puerto Rico|date=1983|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0-8078-1544-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though sterilization could be performed on men and women, women were most likely to undergo the procedure.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nick" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; Sterilization was most frequently recommended by physicians because of a pervasive belief that Puerto Ricans and the poor were not intelligent enough to use other forms of contraception.&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; Physicians and hospitals alike also implemented hospital policy to encourage sterilization, with some hospitals refusing to admit healthy pregnant women for delivery unless they consented to be sterilized.&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "B" /&gt; This has been best documented at Presbyterian Hospital, where the unofficial policy for a time was to refuse admittance for delivery to women who already had three living children unless she consented to sterilization.&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; There is additional evidence that true [[informed consent]] was not obtained from patients before they underwent sterilization, if consent was solicited at all.&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;

By 1949 a survey of Puerto Rican women found that 21% of women interviewed had been sterilized, with sterilizations being performed in 18% of all hospital births statewide as a routine post-partum procedure, with the sterilization operation performed before women left the hospitals after giving birth.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; As for the birth control clinics founded by Sunnen, the Puerto Rican Family Planning Association reported that around 8,000 women and 3,000 men had been sterilized in Sunnen's privately funded clinics.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; At one point, the levels of sterilization in Puerto Rico were so high that they alarmed the Joint Committee for Hospital Accreditation, who then demanded that Puerto Rican hospitals limit sterilizations to ten percent of all hospital deliveries in order to receive accreditation.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; The high popularity of sterilization continued into the 60s and 70s, during which the Puerto Rican government made the procedures available for free and reduced fees.&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt; The effects of the sterilization and contraception campaigns of the 1900s in Puerto Rico are still felt in Puerto Rican cultural history today.&lt;ref name= "Lopez" /&gt;

======Controversy and Opposing Viewpoints======
There has been much debate and scholarly analysis concerning the legitimacy of choice given to Puerto Rican women with regards to sterilization, reproduction, and birth control, as well as with the ethics of economically motivated mass sterilization programs.

Some scholars, such as Bonnie Mass&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; and Iris Lopez,&lt;ref name= "Lopez" /&gt; have argued that the history and popularity of mass sterilization in Puerto Rico represents a government-led eugenics initiative for [[population control]].,&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Lopez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Elena&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gutierrez|first1=Elena R.|last2=Fuentes|first2=Liza|title=Population Control by Sterilization: The Cases of Puerto Rican and Mexican-Origin Women in the United States|journal=Latino(a) Research Review|date=2009–2010|volume=7|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; They cite the private and government funding of sterilization, coercive practices, and the eugenics ideology of Puerto Rican and American governments and physicians as evidence of a mass sterilization campaign.&lt;ref name= "Lopez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Elena" /&gt;

On the other side of the debate, scholars like Laura Briggs&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt; have argued that evidence does not substantiate claims of a mass sterilization program.&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt; She further argues that reducing the popularity of sterilization in Puerto Rico to a state initiative ignores the legacy of Puerto Rican feminist activism in favor or birth control legalization and the individual agency of Puerto Rican women in making decisions about family planning.&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt;

=====Effects=====
When the United States took census of Puerto Rico in 1899, the birth rate was 40 births per one thousand people.&lt;ref name="Nick" /&gt; By 1961, the birth rate had dropped to 30.8 per thousand.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; In 1955, 16.5% of Puerto Rican women of childbearing age had been sterilized, this jumped to 34% in 1965.&lt;ref name= "Mass" /&gt;

In 1969, sociologist [[Harriet Presser]] analyzed the 1965 Master Sample Survey of Health and Welfare in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name=Presser&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Presser|first1=Harriet B.|title=The Role of Sterilization in Controlling Puerto Rican Fertility|journal=Population Studies|date=November 1969|volume=23|issue=3|pages=343–361|doi=10.2307/2172875|jstor=2172875}}&lt;!--|accessdate=10 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She specifically analyzed data from the survey for women ages 20 to 49 who had at least one birth, resulting in an overall sample size of 1,071 women.&lt;ref name="Presser" /&gt; She found that over 34% of women aged 20–49 had been sterilized in Puerto Rico in 1965.&lt;ref name="Presser" /&gt;

Presser’s analysis also found that 46.7% of women who reported they were sterilized were between the ages of 34 and 39.&lt;ref name="Presser" /&gt; Of the sample of women sterilized, 46.6% had been married 15 to 19 years, 43.9% had been married for 10 to 14 years, and 42.7% had been married for 20 to 24 years.&lt;ref name="Presser" /&gt; Nearly 50% of women sterilized had three or four births.&lt;ref name="Presser" /&gt; Over 1/3 of women who reported being sterilized were sterilized in their twenties, with the average age of sterilization being 26.&lt;ref name="Presser" /&gt;

A survey by a team of Americans in 1975 confirmed Presser's assessment that nearly 1/3 of Puerto Rican women of childbearing age had been sterilized.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; As of 1977, Puerto Rico had the highest proportion of childbearing-aged persons sterilized in the world.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; In 1993, [[ethnographic]] work done in New York by [[anthropologist]] Iris Lopez&lt;ref name= "Lopez" /&gt; showed that the history of sterilization continued to effect the lives of Puerto Rican women even after they immigrated to the United States and lived there for generations.&lt;ref name= "Lopez" /&gt; The history of the popularity of sterilization in Puerto Rico meant that Puerto Rican women living in America had high rates of female family members who had undergone sterilization, and it remained a highly popular form of birth control among Puerto Rican women living in New York.&lt;ref name= "Lopez" /&gt;

“Civil Society Organizations such as Balance, Promocion para el Desarrollo y Juventud, A.C., have received in the last years numerous testimonies of women living with HIV in which they inform that misinformation about the virus transmission has frequently lead to compulsory sterilization. Although there is enough evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions aimed to reduce mother-to-child transmission risks, there are records of HIV-positive women forced to undergo sterilization or have agreed to be sterilized without adequate and sufficient information about their options.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=El Estado como "aparato reproductor" de violencia contra las mujeres.

“A [http://www.jiasociety.org/index.php/jias/article/view/19462/html report] made in El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, and Nicaragua concluded that women living with HIV, and whose health providers knew about it at the time of pregnancy, were six times more likely to experience forced or coerced sterilization in those countries. In addition, most of these women reported that health providers told them that living with HIV cancelled their right to choose the number and spacing of the children they want to have as well as the right to choose the contraceptive method of their choice; provided misleading information about the consequences for their health and that of their children and denied them access to treatments that reduce mother-to-child HIV transmission in order to coerce them into sterilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=El Estado como "aparato reproductor" de violencia contra las mujeres.

This happens even when the health norm [http://www.salud.gob.mx/unidades/cdi/nom/005ssa23.html NOM 005-SSA2-1993] states that family planning is “the right of everyone to decide freely, responsibly and in an informed way the number and spacing of their children and to obtain specialized information and proper services” and that “the exercise of this right is independent of gender, age, and social or legal status of persons”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Based on a report by journalist Natalia Antelava, doctors reported that the Ministry of Health told doctors they must perform surgical sterilizations on women. One doctor reported, “It's ruling number 1098 and it says that after two children, in some areas after three, a woman should be sterilized.”, in a loss of the former surface decency of Central Asian mores in regard of female chastity.&lt;ref name="theworld.org"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hackel |first=Joyce |title=Doctors in Uzbekistan Say Government Forcibly Sterilizing Women |website=PRI's The World |date=April 12, 2012 |url=http://www.theworld.org/2012/04/doctors-in-uzbekistan-say-government-forcibly-sterilizing-women/ |publisher=Theworld.org |accessdate= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119162605/http://www.theworld.org/2012/04/doctors-in-uzbekistan-say-government-forcibly-sterilizing-women/ |archivedate=January 19, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Ministry of Health passed a decree stating all clinics in Uzbekistan should have sterilization equipment ready for use. The same report also states that sterilization is to be done on a voluntary basis with the informed consent of the patient.&lt;ref name="theworld.org"/&gt; In the 2010 Human Rights Report of Uzbekistan, there were many reports of forced sterilization of women along with allegations of the government pressuring doctors to sterilize women in order to control the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/sca/154489.htm |title=2010 Human Rights Report: Uzbekistan |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |author=[[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] |website=2010 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices |date=April 8, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170624052726/https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/sca/154489.htm |archivedate=June 24, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Doctors also reported to Antelava that there are quotas they must reach every month on how many women they need to sterilize. These orders are passed on to them through their bosses and, allegedly, from the government.&lt;ref name="theworld.org"/&gt;

On May 15, 2012, during a meeting with the Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]] in [[Moscow]] the Uzbek president Islam Karimov said: "we are doing everything in our hands to make sure that the population growth rate [in Uzbekistan] does not exceed 1.2-1.3"&lt;ref name="RFE/RL"&gt;{{cite news|title="Akhborot" censors Karimov|url=http://www.ozodlik.org/content/article/24584171.html|accessdate=17 May 2012|newspaper=[[RFE/RL]]'s Uzbek Service|date=17 May 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529011406/http://www.ozodlik.org/content/article/24584171.html|archivedate=29 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Uzbek version of [[RFE/RL]] reported that with this statement Karimov indirectly admitted that forced sterilization of women is indeed taking place in Uzbekistan.&lt;ref name="RFE/RL" /&gt; The main Uzbek television channel, O'zbekiston, cut out Karimov's statement about the population growth rate while broadcasting his conversation with Putin.&lt;ref name="RFE/RL" /&gt;
It is unclear if there is any genocidal conspiracy in regard of the Mongol type involved, in connection with genetic drain of this type through lack of their reproduction.

Despite international agreement concerning the inhumanity and illegality of forced sterilization, it has been suggested that the Government of Uzbekistan [[#Uzbekistan|continues to pursue such programs]].&lt;ref name=bbc-news-2012-04-12 /&gt;

===Other countries===
Eugenics programs including forced sterilization existed in most Northern European countries, as well as other more or less Protestant countries. Other countries that had notably active sterilisation programmes include [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Finland]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Gunnar Broberg]] and [[Nils Roll-Hansen]], eds., ''Eugenics And the Welfare State: Sterilization Policy in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland'' (Michigan State University Press, 2005), it is unclear whether genocide investigations in regard of Hun descendant and pure Aryan types has been undertaken, and if concealment is attempted through the prevalence of cremation and allegation of psychiatric treatment facial mimicry of Mongolian types.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Estonia]], [[Switzerland]], [[Iceland]], and some countries in [[Latin America]] (including [[Panama]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], [[Home Secretary]] [[Winston Churchill]] was a noted advocate, and his successor [[Reginald McKenna]] introduced a bill that included forced sterilisation. Writer [[G. K. Chesterton]] led a successful effort to defeat that clause of the [[Mental Deficiency Act 1913|1913 Mental Deficiency Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Martin.

In 2015, the [[Court of Protection]] of the [[United Kingdom]] ruled that a woman with six children and an IQ of 70 should be sterilized for her own safety because another pregnancy would have been a "significantly life-threatening event" for her and the fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=James Gallagher |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-31128969 |title=Mother of six 'can be sterilised' - court ruling |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=February 4, 2015 |accessdate=February 12, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208051831/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-31128969 |archivedate=February 8, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Computational phylogenetics''' is the application of computational [[algorithm]]s, methods, and programs to [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] analyses. The goal is to assemble a [[phylogenetic tree]] representing a hypothesis about the evolutionary ancestry of a set of [[gene]]s, [[species]], or other [[taxa]]. For example, these techniques have been used to explore the family tree of [[hominid]] species&lt;ref name="Strait"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Strait | first1 = DS | last2 = Grine | first2 = FE | year = 2004 | title = Inferring hominoid and early hominid phylogeny using craniodental characters: the role of fossil taxa | url = | journal = J Hum Evol | volume = 47 | issue = 6| pages = 399–452 | doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2004.08.008 | pmid=15566946}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the relationships between specific genes shared by many types of organisms.&lt;ref name="Hodge"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hodge | first1 = T | last2 = Cope | first2 = MJ | year = 2000 | title = A myosin family tree | url = | journal = J Cell Sci | volume = 113 | issue = | pages = 3353–3354 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional phylogenetics relies on [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] data obtained by measuring and quantifying the [[phenotype|phenotypic]] properties of representative organisms, while the more recent field of molecular phylogenetics uses [[nucleotide]] sequences encoding genes or [[amino acid]] sequences encoding [[protein]]s as the basis for classification. Many forms of molecular phylogenetics are closely related to and make extensive use of [[sequence alignment]] in constructing and refining phylogenetic trees, which are used to classify the evolutionary relationships between homologous [[gene]]s represented in the [[genome]]s of divergent species. The phylogenetic trees constructed by computational methods are unlikely to perfectly reproduce the [[evolutionary tree]] that represents the historical relationships between the species being analyzed. The historical species tree may also differ from the historical tree of an individual homologous gene shared by those species.

==Types of phylogenetic trees and networks==
[[Phylogenetic tree]]s generated by computational phylogenetics can be either ''rooted'' or ''unrooted'' depending on the input data and the algorithm used. A rooted tree is a [[directed graph]] that explicitly identifies a [[most recent common ancestor]] (MRCA), usually an imputed sequence that is not represented in the input. Genetic distance measures can be used to plot a tree with the input sequences as [[leaf node]]s and their distances from the root proportional to their [[genetic distance]] from the hypothesized MRCA. Identification of a root usually requires the inclusion in the input data of at least one "outgroup" known to be only distantly related to the sequences of interest.

By contrast, unrooted trees plot the distances and relationships between input sequences without making assumptions regarding their descent. An unrooted tree can always be produced from a rooted tree, but a root cannot usually be placed on an unrooted tree without additional data on divergence rates, such as the assumption of the [[molecular clock]] hypothesis.&lt;ref name="mount"&gt;Mount DM. (2004). ''Bioinformatics: Sequence and Genome Analysis'' 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press: Cold Spring Harbor, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

The set of all possible phylogenetic trees for a given group of input sequences can be conceptualized as a discretely defined multidimensional "tree space" through which search paths can be traced by [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] algorithms. Although counting the total number of trees for a nontrivial number of input sequences can be complicated by variations in the definition of a tree topology, it is always true that there are more rooted than unrooted trees for a given number of inputs and choice of parameters.&lt;ref name="felsenstein"&gt;Felsenstein J. (2004). ''Inferring Phylogenies'' Sinauer Associates: Sunderland, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both rooted and unrooted phylogenetic trees can be further generalized to rooted or unrooted [[phylogenetic network]]s, which allow for the modeling of evolutionary phenomena such as [[Hybridisation (biology)|hybridization]] or [[horizontal gene transfer]].

==Coding characters and defining homology==
===Morphological analysis===
The basic problem in morphological phylogenetics is the assembly of a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] representing a mapping from each of the taxa being compared to representative measurements for each of the phenotypic characteristics being used as a classifier. The types of phenotypic data used to construct this matrix depend on the taxa being compared; for individual species, they may involve measurements of average body size, lengths or sizes of particular bones or other physical features, or even behavioral manifestations. Of course, since not every possible phenotypic characteristic could be measured and encoded for analysis, the selection of which features to measure is a major inherent obstacle to the method. The decision of which traits to use as a basis for the matrix necessarily represents a hypothesis about which traits of a species or higher taxon are evolutionarily relevant.&lt;ref name="Swiderski"&gt;Swiderski DL, Zelditch ML, Fink WL. (1998). Why morphometrics is not special: coding quantitative data for phylogenetic analysis. 47(3):508-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Morphological studies can be confounded by examples of [[convergent evolution]] of phenotypes.&lt;ref name="Gaubert"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gaubert | first1 = P | last2 = Wozencraft | first2 = WC | last3 = Cordeiro-Estrela | first3 = P | last4 = Veron | first4 = G | year = 2005 | title = Mosaics of convergences and noise in morphological phylogenies: what's in a viverrid-like carnivoran? | url = | journal = Syst Biol | volume = 54 | issue = 6| pages = 865–894 | doi=10.1080/10635150500232769| pmid = 16282167 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A major challenge in constructing useful classes is the high likelihood of inter-taxon overlap in the distribution of the phenotype's variation. The inclusion of extinct taxa in morphological analysis is often difficult due to absence of or incomplete [[fossil]] records, but has been shown to have a significant effect on the trees produced; in one study only the inclusion of extinct species of [[ape]]s produced a morphologically derived tree that was consistent with that produced from molecular data.&lt;ref name="Strait" /&gt;

Some phenotypic classifications, particularly those used when analyzing very diverse groups of taxa, are discrete and unambiguous; classifying organisms as possessing or lacking a tail, for example, is straightforward in the majority of cases, as is counting features such as eyes or vertebrae. However, the most appropriate representation of continuously varying phenotypic measurements is a controversial problem without a general solution. A common method is simply to sort the measurements of interest into two or more classes, rendering continuous observed variation as discretely classifiable (e.g., all examples with humerus bones longer than a given cutoff are scored as members of one state, and all members whose humerus bones are shorter than the cutoff are scored as members of a second state). This results in an easily manipulated [[data set]] but has been criticized for poor reporting of the basis for the class definitions and for sacrificing information compared to methods that use a continuous weighted distribution of measurements.&lt;ref name="Wiens"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wiens | first1 = JJ | year = 2001 | title = Character analysis in morphological phylogenetics: problems and solutions | url = | journal = Syst Biol | volume = 50 | issue = 5| pages = 689–699 | doi=10.1080/106351501753328811| pmid = 12116939 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because morphological data is extremely labor-intensive to collect, whether from literature sources or from field observations, reuse of previously compiled data matrices is not uncommon, although this may propagate flaws in the original matrix into multiple derivative analyses.&lt;ref name="Jenner"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jenner | first1 = RA | year = 2001 | title = Bilaterian phylogeny and uncritical recycling of morphological data sets | url = | journal = Syst Biol | volume = 50 | issue = 5| pages = 730–743 | doi=10.1080/106351501753328857}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Molecular analysis===
The problem of character coding is very different in molecular analyses, as the characters in biological sequence data are immediate and discretely defined - distinct [[nucleotide]]s in [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] sequences and distinct [[amino acid]]s in [[protein]] sequences. However, defining [[homology (biology)|homology]] can be challenging due to the inherent difficulties of [[multiple sequence alignment]]. For a given gapped MSA, several rooted phylogenetic trees can be constructed that vary in their interpretations of which changes are "[[mutation]]s" versus ancestral characters, and which events are [[insertion (genetics)|insertion mutations]] or [[deletion (genetics)|deletion mutations]]. For example, given only a pairwise alignment with a gap region, it is impossible to determine whether one sequence bears an insertion mutation or the other carries a deletion. The problem is magnified in MSAs with unaligned and nonoverlapping gaps. In practice, sizable regions of a calculated alignment may be discounted in phylogenetic tree construction to avoid integrating noisy data into the tree calculation.

==Distance-matrix methods==
{{Main|Distance matrices in phylogeny}}
Distance-matrix methods of phylogenetic analysis explicitly rely on a measure of "genetic distance" between the sequences being classified, and therefore they require an MSA as an input. Distance is often defined as the fraction of mismatches at aligned positions, with gaps either ignored or counted as mismatches.&lt;ref name="mount" /&gt; Distance methods attempt to construct an all-to-all matrix from the sequence query set describing the distance between each sequence pair. From this is constructed a phylogenetic tree that places closely related sequences under the same [[interior node]] and whose branch lengths closely reproduce the observed distances between sequences. Distance-matrix methods may produce either rooted or unrooted trees, depending on the algorithm used to calculate them. They are frequently used as the basis for progressive and iterative types of [[multiple sequence alignment]]s. The main disadvantage of distance-matrix methods is their inability to efficiently use information about local high-variation regions that appear across multiple subtrees.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt;

===UPGMA and WPGMA===
{{Main|UPGMA}}
{{Main|WPGMA}}

The [[UPGMA]] (''Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean'') and [[WPGMA]] (''Weighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean'') methods produce rooted trees and require a constant-rate assumption - that is, it assumes an [[ultrametric]] tree in which the distances from the root to every branch tip are equal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sokal R and Michener C |title=A statistical method for evaluating systematic relationships |journal=University of Kansas Science Bulletin |volume=38 |pages=1409–1438 |year=1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neighbor-joining===
{{Main|Neighbor joining}}

Neighbor-joining methods apply general [[cluster analysis]] techniques to sequence analysis using genetic distance as a clustering metric. The simple [[neighbor-joining]] method produces unrooted trees, but it does not assume a constant rate of evolution (i.e., a [[molecular clock]]) across lineages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saitou|first=N.|last2=Nei|first2=M.|date=1987-07-01|title=The neighbor-joining method: a new method for reconstructing phylogenetic trees.|url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/4/4/406|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|language=en|volume=4|issue=4|pages=406–425|issn=0737-4038|pmid=3447015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fitch-Margoliash method===
The [[Distance matrices in phylogeny#Fitch-Margoliash method|Fitch-Margoliash method]] uses a weighted [[least squares]] method for clustering based on genetic distance.&lt;ref name="fitch"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fitch | first1 = WM | authorlink = Walter M. Fitch | authorlink2 = Emanuel Margoliash | last2 = Margoliash | first2 = E. | year = 1967 | title = Construction of phylogenetic trees | url = | journal = Science | volume = 155 | issue = 3760| pages = 279–284 | doi=10.1126/science.155.3760.279 | pmid=5334057}}&lt;/ref&gt; Closely related sequences are given more weight in the tree construction process to correct for the increased inaccuracy in measuring distances between distantly related sequences. The distances used as input to the algorithm must be normalized to prevent large artifacts in computing relationships between closely related and distantly related groups. The distances calculated by this method must be [[linear]]; the linearity criterion for distances requires that the [[expected value]]s of the branch lengths for two individual branches must equal the expected value of the sum of the two branch distances - a property that applies to biological sequences only when they have been corrected for the possibility of [[Mutation#By effect on function|back mutation]]s at individual sites. This correction is done through the use of a [[substitution matrix]] such as that derived from the [[Jukes-Cantor model]] of DNA evolution. The distance correction is only necessary in practice when the evolution rates differ among branches.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt; Another modification of the algorithm can be helpful, especially in case of concentrated distances (please report to [[concentration of measure]] phenomenon and [[curse of dimensionality]]): that modification, described in,&lt;ref name="Lespinats"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lespinats | first1 = S. | last2 = Grando | first2 = D. | last3 = Maréchal | first3 = E. | last4 = Hakimi | first4 = M.A. | last5 = Tenaillon | first5 = O. | last6 = Bastien | first6 = O. | year = 2011 | title = How Fitch-Margoliash Algorithm can benefit from Multi Dimensional Scaling | url = | journal = [[Evolutionary Bioinformatics]] | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 61–85 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been shown to improve the efficiency of the algorithm and its robustness.

The least-squares criterion applied to these distances is more accurate but less efficient than the neighbor-joining methods. An additional improvement that corrects for correlations between distances that arise from many closely related sequences in the data set can also be applied at increased computational cost. Finding the optimal least-squares tree with any correction factor is [[NP-complete]],&lt;ref name="day"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Day | first1 = William HE | year = 1987 | title = Computational complexity of inferring phylogenies from dissimilarity matrices | url = https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092824087800071 | journal = [[Bulletin of Mathematical Biology]] | volume = 49 | issue = 4 | pages = 461–467 | doi=10.1016/s0092-8240(87)80007-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; so [[heuristic]] search methods like those used in maximum-parsimony analysis are applied to the search through tree space.

===Using outgroups===
Independent information about the relationship between sequences or groups can be used to help reduce the tree search space and root unrooted trees. Standard usage of distance-matrix methods involves the inclusion of at least one [[Outgroup (cladistics)|outgroup]] sequence known to be only distantly related to the sequences of interest in the query set.&lt;ref name="mount" /&gt; This usage can be seen as a type of [[experimental control]]. If the outgroup has been appropriately chosen, it will have a much greater [[genetic distance]] and thus a longer branch length than any other sequence, and it will appear near the root of a rooted tree. Choosing an appropriate outgroup requires the selection of a sequence that is moderately related to the sequences of interest; too close a relationship defeats the purpose of the outgroup and too distant adds [[signal noise|noise]] to the analysis.&lt;ref name="mount" /&gt; Care should also be taken to avoid situations in which the species from which the sequences were taken are distantly related, but the gene encoded by the sequences is highly [[conservation (genetics)|conserved]] across lineages. [[Horizontal gene transfer]], especially between otherwise divergent [[bacteria]], can also confound outgroup usage.

==Maximum parsimony==
[[Maximum parsimony]] (MP) is a method of identifying the potential phylogenetic tree that requires the smallest total number of [[evolution]]ary events to explain the observed sequence data. Some ways of scoring trees also include a "cost" associated with particular types of evolutionary events and attempt to locate the tree with the smallest total cost. This is a useful approach in cases where not every possible type of event is equally likely - for example, when particular [[nucleotide]]s or [[amino acid]]s are known to be more mutable than others.

The most naive way of identifying the most parsimonious tree is simple enumeration - considering each possible tree in succession and searching for the tree with the smallest score. However, this is only possible for a relatively small number of sequences or species because the problem of identifying the most parsimonious tree is known to be [[NP-hard]];&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt; consequently a number of [[heuristic]] search methods for [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] have been developed to locate a highly parsimonious tree, if not the best in the set. Most such methods involve a [[steepest descent]]-style minimization mechanism operating on a [[tree rearrangement]] criterion.

===Branch and bound===
The [[branch and bound]] algorithm is a general method used to increase the efficiency of searches for near-optimal solutions of [[NP-hard]] problems first applied to phylogenetics in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="hendy"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hendy | first1 = MD | last2 = Penny | first2 = D | year = 1982 | title = Branch and bound algorithms to determine minimal evolutionary trees | url = | journal = Math Biosci | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 133–142 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Branch and bound is particularly well suited to phylogenetic tree construction because it inherently requires dividing a problem into a [[tree structure]] as it subdivides the problem space into smaller regions. As its name implies, it requires as input both a branching rule (in the case of phylogenetics, the addition of the next species or sequence to the tree) and a bound (a rule that excludes certain regions of the search space from consideration, thereby assuming that the optimal solution cannot occupy that region). Identifying a good bound is the most challenging aspect of the algorithm's application to phylogenetics. A simple way of defining the bound is a maximum number of assumed evolutionary changes allowed per tree. A set of criteria known as Zharkikh's rules&lt;ref name="zharkikh"&gt;Ratner VA, Zharkikh AA, Kolchanov N, Rodin S, Solovyov S, Antonov AS. (1995). ''Molecular Evolution'' Biomathematics Series Vol 24. Springer-Verlag: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; severely limit the search space by defining characteristics shared by all candidate "most parsimonious" trees. The two most basic rules require the elimination of all but one redundant sequence (for cases where multiple observations have produced identical data) and the elimination of character sites at which two or more states do not occur in at least two species. Under ideal conditions these rules and their associated algorithm would completely define a tree.

===Sankoff-Morel-Cedergren algorithm===
The Sankoff-Morel-Cedergren algorithm was among the first published methods to simultaneously produce an MSA and a phylogenetic tree for nucleotide sequences.&lt;ref name="sankoff"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sankoff | first1 = D | last2 = Morel | first2 = C | last3 = Cedergren | first3 = RJ | year = 1973 | title = Evolution of 5S RNA and the non-randomness of base replacement | url = | journal = Nature New Biology | volume = 245 | issue = 147| pages = 232–234 | doi=10.1038/newbio245232a0 | pmid=4201431}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method uses a [[maximum parsimony]] calculation in conjunction with a scoring function that penalizes gaps and mismatches, thereby favoring the tree that introduces a minimal number of such events (an alternative view holds that the trees to be favored are those that maximize the amount of sequence similarity that can be interpreted as homology, a point of view that may lead to different optimal trees &lt;ref name="de_laet2005"&gt;De Laet J. (2005). Parsimony and the problem of inapplicables in sequence data. Pp. 81-116 in Albert, V.A. (ed.) ''Parsimony, phylogeny and genomics.'' Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-856493-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The imputed sequences at the [[interior node]]s of the tree are scored and summed over all the nodes in each possible tree. The lowest-scoring tree sum provides both an optimal tree and an optimal MSA given the scoring function. Because the method is highly computationally intensive, an approximate method in which initial guesses for the interior alignments are refined one node at a time. Both the full and the approximate version are in practice calculated by dynamic programming.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt;

===MALIGN and POY===
More recent phylogenetic tree/MSA methods use heuristics to isolate high-scoring, but not necessarily optimal, trees. The MALIGN method uses a maximum-parsimony technique to compute a multiple alignment by maximizing a [[cladogram]] score, and its companion POY uses an iterative method that couples the optimization of the phylogenetic tree with improvements in the corresponding MSA.&lt;ref name="wheeler"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wheeler | first1 = WC | last2 = Gladstein | first2 = DG | year = 1994 | title = MALIGN: a multiple nucleic acid sequence alignment program | url = | journal = Journal of Heredity | volume = 85 | issue = | pages = 417–418 | doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a111492}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the use of these methods in constructing evolutionary hypotheses has been criticized as biased due to the deliberate construction of trees reflecting minimal evolutionary events.&lt;ref name="simmons"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simmons | first1 = MP | year = 2004 | title = Independence of alignment and tree search | url = | journal = Mol Phylogenet Evol | volume = 31 | issue = 3| pages = 874–879 | pmid = 15120385 | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2003.10.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, has been countered by the view that such methods should be seen as heuristic approaches to find the trees that maximize the amount of sequence similarity that can be interpreted as homology.&lt;ref name="de_laet2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="de_laet2015"&gt;

==Maximum likelihood==
The [[maximum likelihood]] method uses standard statistical techniques for inferring [[probability distribution]]s to assign probabilities to particular possible phylogenetic trees. The method requires a [[substitution model]] to assess the probability of particular [[mutation]]s; roughly, a tree that requires more mutations at interior nodes to explain the observed phylogeny will be assessed as having a lower probability. This is broadly similar to the maximum-parsimony method, but maximum likelihood allows additional statistical flexibility by permitting varying rates of evolution across both lineages and sites. In fact, the method requires that evolution at different sites and along different lineages must be [[statistically independent]]. Maximum likelihood is thus well suited to the analysis of distantly related sequences, but it is believed to be computationally intractable to compute due to its NP-hardness.&lt;ref name="chor"&gt;Chor B, Tuller T. (2005). Maximum likelihood of evolutionary trees: hardness and approximation. ''Bioinformatics'' 21.suppl 1:  i97-i106.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "pruning" algorithm, a variant of [[dynamic programming]], is often used to reduce the search space by efficiently calculating the likelihood of subtrees.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt; The method calculates the likelihood for each site in a "linear" manner, starting at a node whose only descendants are leaves (that is, the tips of the tree) and working backwards toward the "bottom" node in nested sets. However, the trees produced by the method are only rooted if the substitution model is irreversible, which is not generally true of biological systems. The search for the maximum-likelihood tree also includes a branch length optimization component that is difficult to improve upon algorithmically; general [[global optimization]] tools such as the [[Newton-Raphson]] method are often used.

==Bayesian inference==&lt;!--There is at least one wikilink here, so fix if you change the section title--&gt;
{{Main|Bayesian inference in phylogeny}}
[[Bayesian inference]] can be used to produce phylogenetic trees in a manner closely related to the maximum likelihood methods. Bayesian methods assume a prior [[probability distribution]] of the possible trees, which may simply be the probability of any one tree among all the possible trees that could be generated from the data, or may be a more sophisticated estimate derived from the assumption that divergence events such as [[speciation]] occur as [[stochastic process]]es. The choice of prior distribution is a point of contention among users of Bayesian-inference phylogenetics methods.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt;

Implementations of Bayesian methods generally use [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] sampling algorithms, although the choice of move set varies; selections used in Bayesian phylogenetics include circularly permuting leaf nodes of a proposed tree at each step&lt;ref name="Mau"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mau | first1 = B | last2 = Newton | first2 = MA | year = 1997 | title = Phylogenetic inference for binary data on dendrograms using Markov chain Monte Carlo | url = | journal = J Comp Graph Stat | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 122–131 | doi=10.2307/1390728| jstor = 1390728 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and swapping descendant subtrees of a random [[internal node]] between two related trees.&lt;ref name="Yang"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yang | first1 = Z | last2 = Rannala | first2 = B | year = 1997 | title = bayesian phylogenetic inference using DNA sequences: a Markov chain Monte Carlo method | url = | journal = Mol Biol Evol | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 717–724 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025811 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of Bayesian methods in phylogenetics has been controversial, largely due to incomplete specification of the choice of move set, acceptance criterion, and prior distribution in published work.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt;  Bayesian methods are generally held to be superior to parsimony-based methods; they can be more prone to long-branch attraction than maximum likelihood techniques,&lt;ref name="Kolaczkowski2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kolaczkowski | first1 = B. | last2 = Thornton | first2 = J.

Whereas likelihood methods find the tree that maximizes the probability of the data, a Bayesian approach recovers a tree that represents the most likely clades, by drawing on the posterior distribution.  However, estimates of the posterior probability of clades (measuring their 'support') can be quite wide of the mark, especially in clades that aren't overwhelmingly likely. As such, other methods have been put forwards to estimate posterior probability.&lt;ref name="Larget2013"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Larget | first1 = B. | title = The Estimation of Tree Posterior Probabilities Using Conditional Clade Probability Distributions | doi = 10.1093/sysbio/syt014 | journal = Systematic Biology | volume = 62 | issue = 4 | pages = 501–511 | year = 2013 | pmid =  23479066| pmc =3676676 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model selection==
Molecular phylogenetics methods rely on a defined [[substitution model]] that encodes a hypothesis about the relative rates of [[mutation]] at various sites along the gene or amino acid sequences being studied. At their simplest, substitution models aim to correct for differences in the rates of [[transition (genetics)|transitions]] and [[transversion]]s in nucleotide sequences. The use of substitution models is necessitated by the fact that the [[genetic distance]] between two sequences increases linearly only for a short time after the two sequences diverge from each other (alternatively, the distance is linear only shortly before [[coalescent theory|coalescence]]). The longer the amount of time after divergence, the more likely it becomes that two mutations occur at the same nucleotide site. Simple genetic distance calculations will thus undercount the number of mutation events that have occurred in evolutionary history. The extent of this undercount increases with increasing time since divergence, which can lead to the phenomenon of [[long branch attraction]], or the misassignment of two distantly related but convergently evolving sequences as closely related.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.36.102003.152633 | title = Model Selection in Phylogenetics | year = 2005 | author = Sullivan, Jack | journal = Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 445–466 | last2 = Joyce | first2 = Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum parsimony method is particularly susceptible to this problem due to its explicit search for a tree representing a minimum number of distinct evolutionary events.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt;

===Types of models===
{{Main|Substitution model}}

All substitution models assign a set of weights to each possible change of state represented in the sequence. The most common model types are implicitly reversible because they assign the same weight to, for example, a G&gt;C nucleotide mutation as to a C&gt;G mutation. The simplest possible model, the [[Jukes-Cantor model]], assigns an equal probability to every possible change of state for a given nucleotide base. The rate of change between any two distinct nucleotides will be one-third of the overall substitution rate.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt; More advanced models distinguish between [[transition (genetics)|transitions]] and [[transversion]]s. The most general possible time-reversible model, called the GTR model, has six mutation rate parameters. An even more generalized model known as the general 12-parameter model breaks time-reversibility, at the cost of much additional complexity in calculating genetic distances that are consistent among multiple lineages.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt; One possible variation on this theme adjusts the rates so that overall GC content - an important measure of DNA double helix stability - varies over time.&lt;ref name="Galtier"&gt;Galtier N, Guoy M. (1998.) Inferring pattern and process: maximum-likelihood implementation of a nonhomogeneous model of DNA sequence evolution for phylogenetic analysis. ''Mol. Biol. Evol.'' 15:871–879.&lt;/ref&gt;

Models may also allow for the variation of rates with positions in the input sequence. The most obvious example of such variation follows from the arrangement of nucleotides in protein-coding genes into three-base [[codon]]s. If the location of the [[open reading frame]] (ORF) is known, rates of mutation can be adjusted for position of a given site within a codon, since it is known that [[wobble base pair]]ing can allow for higher mutation rates in the third nucleotide of a given codon without affecting the codon's meaning in the [[genetic code]].&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt; A less hypothesis-driven example that does not rely on ORF identification simply assigns to each site a rate randomly drawn from a predetermined distribution, often the [[gamma distribution]] or [[log-normal distribution]].&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt; Finally, a more conservative estimate of rate variations known as the [[covarion]] method allows [[autocorrelation|autocorrelated]] variations in rates, so that the mutation rate of a given site is correlated across sites and lineages.&lt;ref name="FitchMarkowitz"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fitch | first1 = WM | last2 = Markowitz | first2 = E | year = 1970 | title = An improved method for determining codon variability in a gene and its application to the rate of fixation of mutations in evolution | url = | journal = Biochemical Genetics | volume = 4 | issue = 5| pages = 579–593 | doi=10.1007/bf00486096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Choosing the best model===
The selection of an appropriate model is critical for the production of good phylogenetic analyses, both because underparameterized or overly restrictive models may produce aberrant behavior when their underlying assumptions are violated, and because overly complex or overparameterized models are computationally expensive and the parameters may be overfit.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt; The most common method of model selection is the [[likelihood ratio test]] (LRT), which produces a likelihood estimate that can be interpreted as a measure of "[[goodness of fit]]" between the model and the input data.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt; However, care must be taken in using these results, since a more complex model with more parameters will always have a higher likelihood than a simplified version of the same model, which can lead to the naive selection of models that are overly complex.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt;  For this reason model selection computer programs will choose the simplest model that is not significantly worse than more complex substitution models. A significant disadvantage of the LRT is the necessity of making a series of pairwise comparisons between models; it has been shown that the order in which the models are compared has a major effect on the one that is eventually selected.&lt;ref name="Pol"&gt;Pol D. (2004.) Empirical problems of the hierarchical likelihood ratio test for model selection. ''Syst Biol'' 53:949–962.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative model selection method is the [[Akaike information criterion]] (AIC), formally an estimate of the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]] between the true model and the model being tested. It can be interpreted as a likelihood estimate with a correction factor to penalize overparameterized models.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt; The AIC is calculated on an individual model rather than a pair, so it is independent of the order in which models are assessed. A related alternative, the [[Bayesian information criterion]] (BIC), has a similar basic interpretation but penalizes complex models more heavily.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt;

A comprehensive step-by-step protocol on constructing phylogenetic tree, including DNA/Amino Acid contiguous sequence assembly, multiple sequence alignment, model-test (testing best-fitting substitution models) and phylogeny reconstruction using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference, is available at ''Nature Protocol''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/protex.2013.065 | title=Sequence similarity search, Multiple Sequence Alignment, Model Selection, Distance Matrix and Phylogeny Reconstruction | year=2013 | journal=Protocol Exchange | last1 = Bast | first1 = Felix }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A non traditional way of evaluating the phylogenetic tree is to compare it with clustering result. One can use a Multidimensional Scaling technique, so called Interpolative Joining to do dimensionality reduction to visualize the clustering result for the sequences in 3D, and then map the phylogenetic tree onto the clustering result. A better tree usually has a higher correlation with the clustering result.&lt;ref&gt;Ruan, Yang, et al. "Integration of Clustering and Multidimensional Scaling to Determine Phylogenetic Trees as Spherical Phylograms Visualized in 3 Dimensions." Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGrid), 2014 14th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on. IEEE, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluating tree support==
As with all statistical analysis, the estimation of phylogenies from character data requires an evaluation of confidence. A number of methods exist to test the amount of support for a phylogenetic tree, either by evaluating the support for each sub-tree in the phylogeny (nodal support) or evaluating whether the phylogeny is significantly different from other possible trees (alternative tree hypothesis tests).

===Nodal support===
The most common method for assessing tree support is to evaluate the statistical support for each node on the tree. Typically, a node with very low support is not considered valid in further analysis, and visually may be collapsed into a [[polytomy]] to indicate that relationships within a clade are unresolved.

====Consensus tree====
Many methods for assessing nodal support involve consideration of multiple phylogenies. The consensus tree summarizes the nodes that are shared among a set of trees.&lt;ref name="BaumSmith2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David A. Baum|author2=Stacey D. Smith|title=Tree Thinking: An Introduction to Phylogenetic Biology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zW_ApwAACAAJ|year=2013|publisher=Roberts|isbn=978-1-936221-16-5|page=442}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a *strict consensus,* only nodes found in every tree are shown, and the rest are collapsed into an unresolved [[polytomy]]. Less conservative methods, such as the *majority-rule consensus* tree, consider nodes that are supported by a given percentage of trees under consideration (such as at least 50%).

For example, in maximum parsimony analysis, there may be many trees with the same parsimony score. A strict consensus tree would show which nodes are found in all equally parsimonious trees, and which nodes differ. Consensus trees are also used to evaluate support on phylogenies reconstructed with Bayesian inference (see below).

====Bootstrapping and jackknifing====
In statistics, the [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrap]] is a method for inferring the variability of data that has an unknown distribution using pseudoreplications of the original data. For example, given a set of 100 data points, a [[pseudoreplicate]] is a data set of the same size (100 points) randomly sampled from the original data, with replacement. That is, each original data point may be represented more than once in the pseudoreplicate, or not at all. Statistical support involves evaluation of whether the original data has similar properties to a large set of pseudoreplicates.

In phylogenetics, bootstrapping is conducted using the columns of the character matrix. Each pseudoreplicate contains the same number of species (rows) and characters (columns) randomly sampled from the original matrix, with replacement. A phylogeny is reconstructed from each pseudoreplicate, with the same methods used to reconstruct the phylogeny from the original data. For each node on the phylogeny, the nodal support is the percentage of pseudoreplicates containing that node.&lt;ref name="Felsenstein1985"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Felsenstein|first1=Joseph|title=Confidence Limits on Phylogenies: An Approach Using the Bootstrap|journal=Evolution|volume=39|issue=4|year=1985|pages=783–791|issn=0014-3820|doi=10.2307/2408678|pmid=28561359|jstor=2408678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statistical rigor of the bootstrap test has been empirically evaluated using viral populations with known evolutionary histories,&lt;ref name="HillisBull1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hillis|first1=D. M.|last2=Bull|first2=J. J.|title=An Empirical Test of Bootstrapping as a Method for Assessing Confidence in Phylogenetic Analysis|journal=Systematic Biology|volume=42|issue=2|year=1993|pages=182–192|issn=1063-5157|doi=10.1093/sysbio/42.2.182}}&lt;/ref&gt; finding that 70% bootstrap support corresponds to a 95% probability that the clade exists. However, this was tested under ideal conditions (e.g. no change in evolutionary rates, symmetric phylogenies). In practice, values above 70% are generally supported and left to the researcher or reader to evaluate confidence. Nodes with support lower than 70% are typically considered unresolved.

Jackknifing in phylogenetics is a similar procedure, except the columns of the matrix are sampled without replacement. Pseudoreplicates are generated by randomly subsampling the data—for example, a "10% jackknife" would involve randomly sampling 10% of the matrix many times to evaluate nodal support.

==== Posterior probability ====
Reconstruction of phylogenies using [[Bayesian inference]] generates a posterior distribution of highly probable trees given the data and evolutionary model, rather than a single "best" tree. The trees in the posterior distribution generally have many different topologies. Most Bayesian inference methods utilize a Markov-chain Monte Carlo iteration, and the initial steps of this chain are not considered reliable reconstructions of the phylogeny. Trees generated early in the chain are usually discarded as [[burn-in]]. The most common method of evaluating nodal support in a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis is to calculate the percentage of trees in the posterior distribution (post-burn-in) which contain the node.

The statistical support for a node in Bayesian inference is expected to reflect the probability that a clade really exists given the data and evolutionary model.&lt;ref name="HuelsenbeckRannala2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huelsenbeck|first1=John|last2=Rannala|first2=Bruce|title=Frequentist Properties of Bayesian Posterior Probabilities of Phylogenetic Trees Under Simple and Complex Substitution Models|journal=Systematic Biology|volume=53|issue=6|year=2004|pages=904–913|issn=1063-5157|doi=10.1080/10635150490522629|pmid=15764559}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the threshold for accepting a node as supported is generally higher than for bootstrapping.

==== Step counting methods====
[[Bremer support]] counts the number of extra steps needed to contradict a clade.

===Shortcomings ===
These measures each have their weaknesses. For example, smaller or larger clades tend to attract larger support values than mid-sized clades, simply as a result of the number of taxa in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/jzs.12024| title = Evaluating the clade size effect in alternative measures of branch support| journal = Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research| pages = n/a| year = 2013| last1 = Chemisquy | first1 = M. A. A. | last2 = Prevosti | first2 = F. J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bootstrap support can provide high estimates of node support as a result of noise in the data rather than the true existence of a clade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/molbev/msh137| pmid = 15084674| title = Genome-Scale Phylogeny and the Detection of Systematic Biases| journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution| volume = 21| issue = 7| pages = 1455–1458| year = 2004| last1 = Phillips | first1 = M. J.| last2 = Delsuc| first2 = F| last3 = Penny| first3 = D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations and workarounds ==
Ultimately, there is no way to measure whether a particular phylogenetic hypothesis is accurate or not, unless the true relationships among the taxa being examined are already known (which may happen with bacteria or viruses under laboratory conditions). The best result an empirical phylogeneticist can hope to attain is a tree with branches that are well supported by the available evidence. Several potential pitfalls have been identified:

=== Homoplasy ===
{{main|Convergent evolution}}
Certain characters are more likely to [[Convergent evolution|evolve convergently]] than others; logically, such characters should be given less weight in the reconstruction of a tree.&lt;ref name=Goloboff2008&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.2008.00209.x |title=Weighting against homoplasy improves phylogenetic analysis of morphological data sets |year=2008 |last1=Goloboff |first1=Pablo A. |last2=Carpenter |first2=James M. |last3=Arias |first3=J. Salvador |last4=Esquivel |first4=Daniel Rafael Miranda |journal=Cladistics |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=758–773}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weights in the form of a model of evolution can be inferred from sets of molecular data, so that [[maximum likelihood]] or [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] methods can be used to analyze them. For molecular sequences, this problem is exacerbated when the taxa under study have diverged substantially. As time since the divergence of two taxa increase, so does the probability of multiple substitutions on the same site, or back mutations, all of which result in homoplasies.  For morphological data, unfortunately, the only objective way to determine convergence is by the construction of a tree&amp;nbsp;– a somewhat circular method. Even so, weighting homoplasious characters{{how|date=September 2012}} does indeed lead to better-supported trees.&lt;ref name=Goloboff2008/&gt; Further refinement can be brought by weighting changes in one direction higher than changes in another; for instance, the presence of thoracic wings almost guarantees placement among the pterygote insects because, although wings are often lost secondarily, there is no evidence that they have been gained more than once.&lt;ref name=Goloboff1997&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.1997.tb00317.x |title=Self-Weighted Optimization: Tree Searches and Character State Reconstructions under Implied Transformation Costs |year=1997 |last1=Goloboff |first1=Pablo A. |journal=Cladistics |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=225–245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Horizontal gene transfer ===
In general, organisms can inherit genes in two ways: vertical gene transfer and [[horizontal gene transfer]]. Vertical gene transfer is the passage of genes from parent to offspring, and horizontal (also called lateral) gene transfer occurs when genes jump between unrelated organisms, a common phenomenon especially in [[prokaryote]]s; a good example of this is the acquired [[antibiotic resistance]] as a result of gene exchange between various bacteria leading to multi-drug-resistant bacterial species. There have also been well-documented cases of horizontal gene transfer [[Horizontal gene transfer#Eukaryotes|between eukaryotes]].

Horizontal gene transfer has complicated the determination of phylogenies of organisms, and inconsistencies in phylogeny have been reported among specific groups of organisms depending on the genes used to construct evolutionary trees. The only way to determine which genes have been acquired vertically and which horizontally is to [[Occam's razor|parsimoniously]] assume that the largest set of genes that have been inherited together have been inherited vertically; this requires analyzing a large number of genes.

=== Hybrids, speciation, introgressions and incomplete  lineage sorting===
The basic assumption underlying the mathematical model of cladistics is a situation where species split neatly in bifurcating fashion. While such an assumption may hold on a larger scale (bar horizontal gene transfer, see above), [[speciation]] is often much less orderly. Research since the cladistic method was introduced has shown that [[hybrid speciation]], once thought rare, is in fact quite common, particularly in plants.&lt;ref name=Arnold&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnold|first=M.L.|title=Natural Hybridization and Evolution|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-509975-1|pages=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wendel, J F. &amp; Doyle, J.J.

Kluwer, Boston, pp. 265–296.&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[paraspecies|paraphyletic speciation]] is common, making the assumption of a bifurcating pattern unsuitable, leading to [[phylogenetic network]]s rather than trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Funk | first1 = D.

Our current knowledge of processes such as hybridization, endosymbiosis and lateral gene transfer makes clear that the evolutionary history of life on Earth cannot accurately be depicted as a single, typological, bifurcating tree.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Introgression]] can also move genes between otherwise distinct species and sometimes even genera, complicating phylogenetic analysis based on genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Qu|first1=Yanhua|last2=Zhang|first2=Ruiying|last3=Quan|first3=Qing|last4=Song|first4=Gang|last5=Li|first5=Shou Hsien|last6=Lei|first6=Fumin|title=Incomplete lineage sorting or secondary admixture: disentangling historical divergence from recent gene flow in the Vinous-throated parrotbill (''Paradoxornis webbianus'')|journal=Molecular Ecology|date=December 2012|volume=21|issue=24|pages=6117–6133|doi=10.1111/mec.12080|pmid=23095021}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 May 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon can contribute to "incomplete lineage sorting" and is thought to be a common phenomenon across a number of groups. In species level analysis this can be dealt with by larger sampling or better whole genome analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pollard|first1=Daniel A.|last2=Iyer|first2=Venky N.|last3=Moses|first3=Alan M.|last4=Eisen|first4=Michael B.|title=Widespread Discordance of Gene Trees with Species Tree in Drosophila: Evidence for Incomplete Lineage Sorting|journal=PLoS Genetics|date=2006|volume=2|issue=10|pages=e173|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020173|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020173|pmid=17132051|pmc=1626107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the problem is avoided by restricting the analysis to fewer, not closely related specimens.

=== Taxon sampling ===
Owing to the development of advanced sequencing techniques in [[molecular biology]], it has become feasible to gather large amounts of data (DNA or amino acid sequences) to infer phylogenetic hypotheses. For example, it is not rare to find studies with character matrices based on whole [[mitochondrial]] genomes (~16,000 nucleotides, in many animals). However, simulations have shown that it is more important to increase the number of taxa in the matrix than to increase the number of characters, because the more taxa there are, the more accurate and more robust is the resulting phylogenetic tree.&lt;ref name="Zwickl2002"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10635150290102339 |title=Increased Taxon Sampling Greatly Reduces Phylogenetic Error |year=2002 |last1=Zwickl |first1=Derrick J. |last2=Hillis |first2=David M. |journal=Systematic Biology |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=588–598 |pmid=12228001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiens2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jbi.2005.04.001 |title=Missing data and the design of phylogenetic analyses |year=2006 |last1=Wiens |first1=John J. |journal=Journal of Biomedical Informatics |volume=39 |pages=34–42 |pmid=15922672 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be partly due to the breaking up of [[long branch attraction|long branches]].

=== Phylogenetic signal ===
Another important factor that affects the accuracy of tree reconstruction is whether the data analyzed actually contain a useful phylogenetic signal, a term that is used generally to denote whether a character evolves slowly enough to have the same state in closely related taxa as opposed to varying randomly. Tests for phylogenetic signal exist.&lt;ref name="Blomberg2003"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12778543 |year=2003 |last1=Blomberg |first1=Simon P. |last2=Garland Jr |first2=Theodore |last3=Ives |first3=Anthony R. |title=Testing for phylogenetic signal in comparative data: Behavioral traits are more labile |volume=57 |issue=4 |pages=717–745 |journal=Evolution |doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2003.tb00285.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Continuous characters ===
Morphological characters that sample a continuum may contain phylogenetic signal, but are hard to code as discrete characters. Several methods have been used, one of which is gap coding, and there are variations on gap coding.&lt;ref name=Archie1985&gt;{{cite journal|author=Archie, J.W.|year=1985|title=Methods for coding variable morphological features for numerical taxonomic analysis|journal=Systematic Zoology|volume=34|issue=3|pages=326–345|url=http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/content/34/3/326.abstract|doi=10.2307/2413151|jstor=2413151}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the original form of gap coding:&lt;ref name=Archie1985/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;group means for a character are first ordered by size. The pooled within-group standard deviation is calculated ... and differences between adjacent means ... are compared relative to this standard deviation. Any pair of adjacent means is considered different and given different integer scores ... if the means are separated by a "gap" greater than the within-group standard deviation ... times some arbitrary constant.&lt;/blockquote&gt; If more taxa are added to the analysis, the gaps between taxa may become so small that all information is lost. Generalized gap coding works around that problem by comparing individual pairs of taxa rather than considering one set that contains all of the taxa.&lt;ref name=Archie1985/&gt;

=== Missing data ===
In general, the more data that are available when constructing a tree, the more accurate and reliable the resulting tree will be. Missing data are no more detrimental than simply having fewer data, although the impact is greatest when most of the missing data are in a small number of taxa. Concentrating the missing data across a small number of characters produces a more robust tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Prevosti |first1=Francisco J. |last2=Chemisquy |first2=María A. |doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.2009.00289.x |title=The impact of missing data on real morphological phylogenies: Influence of the number and distribution of missing entries |year=2009 |journal=Cladistics |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=326–339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The role of fossils ==
Because many characters involve embryological, or soft-tissue or molecular characters that (at best) hardly ever fossilize, and the interpretation of fossils is more ambiguous than that of [[Extant taxon|living taxa]], extinct taxa almost invariably have higher proportions of missing data than living ones. However, despite these limitations, the inclusion of fossils is invaluable, as they can provide information in sparse areas of trees, breaking up long branches and constraining intermediate character states; thus, fossil taxa contribute as much to tree resolution as modern taxa.&lt;ref name=Cobbett2007&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10635150701627296 |title=Fossils Impact as Hard as Living Taxa in Parsimony Analyses of Morphology |year=2007 |last1=Cobbett |first1=Andrea |last2=Wilkinson |first2=Mark |last3=Wills |first3=Matthew |journal=Systematic Biology |volume=56 |issue=5 |pages=753–766 |pmid=17886145}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Fossils can also constrain the age of lineages and thus demonstrate how consistent a tree is with the stratigraphic record;&lt;ref name="Huelsenbeck"&gt;
{{cite journal |first1=John P. |last1=Huelsenbeck |year=1994 |title=Comparing the Stratigraphic Record to Estimates of Phylogeny |journal=Paleobiology |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=470–483 |jstor=2401230 |doi=10.1017/s009483730001294x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[stratocladistics]] incorporates age information into data matrices for phylogenetic analyses.

'''Conscience''' is a cognitive process that elicits emotion and rational associations based on an individual's [[ethics|moral philosophy]] or value system. Conscience stands in contrast to elicited emotion or thought due to associations based on immediate sensory perceptions and reflexive responses, as in sympathetic CNS responses.  In common terms, conscience is often described as leading to feelings of [[remorse]] when a person commits an act that conflicts with their [[moral value]]s. An individual's moral values and their dissonance with familial, social, cultural and historical interpretations of moral philosophy are considered in the examination of [[cultural relativism|cultural relativity]] in both the practice and study of psychology.  The extent to which conscience informs moral judgment before an action and whether such [[moral judgment]]s are or should be based on [[reason]] has occasioned debate through much of modern history between theories of modern [[western philosophy]] in juxtaposition to the theories of [[romanticism]] and other reactionary movements after the end of the [[Middle Ages]].

Religious views of conscience usually see it as linked to a morality inherent in all humans, to a beneficent universe and/or to [[divinity]]. The diverse ritualistic, mythical, doctrinal, legal, institutional and material features of religion may not necessarily cohere with experiential, emotive, [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[contemplative]] considerations about the origin and operation of conscience.&lt;ref&gt;Ninian Smart. ''The World's Religions: Old Traditions and Modern Transformations''. Cambridge University Press. 1989. pp. 10–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Common [[secular]] or [[scientific]] views regard the capacity for conscience as probably [[genetics|genetically determined]], with its subject probably learned or [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinted]] as part of a [[culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Winch. ''Moral Integrity''. Basil Blackwell. Oxford. 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

In the literary traditions of the [[Upanishads]], [[Brahma Sutras]] and the [[Bhagavad Gita]], conscience is the label given to attributes composing knowledge about good and evil, that a [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] acquires from the completion of acts and consequent accretion of [[karma]] over many lifetimes.&lt;ref&gt;Ninian Smart. ''The World's Religions: Old Traditions and Modern Transformations''. Cambridge University Press. 1989. p. 382&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Adi Shankara]] in his ''[[Vivekachudamani]]'' morally right action (characterised as humbly and compassionately performing the primary duty of good to others without expectation of material or spiritual reward), helps "purify the heart" and provide mental tranquility but it alone does not give us "direct perception of the Reality".&lt;ref&gt;Shankara.

Vedanta Press, Hollywood. 1978. pp. 34–36, 136–37.&lt;/ref&gt; This knowledge requires discrimination between the eternal and non-eternal and eventually a realization in [[contemplation]] that the true self merges in a universe of pure consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Shankara.

Conscience also features prominently in [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jayne Hoose (ed) ''Conscience in World Religions''. University of Notre Dame Press. 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Pali]] scriptures, for example, [[Buddha]] links the positive aspect of ''conscience'' to a pure heart and a calm, well-directed mind. It is regarded as a spiritual power, and one of the “Guardians of the World”. The Buddha also associated conscience with compassion for those who must endure cravings and suffering in the world until right conduct culminates in right mindfulness and right [[contemplation]].&lt;ref&gt;Ninian Smart. ''The Religious Experience of Mankind''. Fontana. 1971 p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Santideva]] (685–763 CE) wrote in the [[Bodhicaryavatara]] (which he composed and delivered in the great northern Indian Buddhist university of [[Nalanda]]) of the spiritual importance of perfecting virtues such as [[generosity]], [[forbearance]] and training the awareness to be like a "block of wood" when attracted by vices such as [[pride]] or [[lust]]; so one can continue advancing towards right understanding in meditative absorption.&lt;ref&gt;Santideva.

The [[Roman Emperor]] [[Marcus Aurelius]] wrote in his ''[[Meditations]]'' that conscience was the human capacity to live by rational principles that were congruent with the true, tranquil and harmonious nature of our mind and thereby that of the Universe: "To move from one unselfish action to another with God in mind. Only there, delight and stillness&amp;nbsp;... the only rewards of our existence here are an unstained character and unselfish acts."&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Aurelius. ''Meditations''. Gregory Hays (trans).

The [[Islamic]] concept of ''[[Taqwa]]'' is closely related to conscience. In the [[Qur’ān]] verses 2:197 &amp; 22:37 Taqwa refers to "right conduct" or "[[piety]]", "guarding of oneself" or "guarding against evil".&lt;ref&gt;Sachiko Murata and William C. Chittick. ''The Vision of Islam''. I. B. Tauris. 2000. {{ISBN|1-86064-022-2}} pp. 282–85&lt;/ref&gt; [[Qur’ān]] verse 47:17 says that God is the ultimate source of the believer's taqwā which is not simply the product of individual will but requires inspiration from God.&lt;ref&gt;Ames Ambros and Stephan Procházka. ''A Concise Dictionary of Koranic Arabic''. Reichert Verlag 2004. {{ISBN|3-89500-400-6}} p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Qur’ān]] verses 91:7–8, God the Almighty talks about how He has perfected the soul, the conscience and has taught it the wrong (fujūr) and right (taqwā). Hence, the awareness of vice and virtue is inherent in the soul, allowing it to be tested fairly in the life of this world and tried, held accountable on the day of judgment for responsibilities to God and all humans.&lt;ref&gt;Azim Nanji.

[[Qur’ān]] verse 49:13 states: "O humankind! We have created you out of male and female and constituted you into different groups and societies, so that you may come to know each other-the noblest of you, in the sight of God, are the ones possessing taqwā." In [[Islam]], according to eminent theologians such as [[Al-Ghazali]], although events are ordained (and written by God in al-Lawh al-Mahfūz, the ''Preserved Tablet''), humans possess free will to choose between wrong and right, and are thus responsible for their actions; the conscience being a dynamic personal connection to God enhanced by knowledge and practise of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], deeds of piety, repentance, self-discipline and prayer; and disintegrated and metaphorically covered in blackness through sinful acts.&lt;ref&gt;John B Noss.

In the Protestant Christian tradition, [[Martin Luther]] insisted in the [[Diet of Worms]] that his conscience was captive to the Word of God, and it was neither safe nor right to go against conscience. To Luther, conscience falls within the ethical, rather than the religious, sphere.&lt;ref name=Tillich&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tillich|first1=Paul|title=Morality and Beyond|date=1963|publisher=Harper &amp; Row, Publishers|location=New York|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Calvin]] saw conscience as a battleground: "[...] the enemies who rise up in our conscience against his Kingdom and hinder his decrees prove that God's throne is not firmly established therein".&lt;ref&gt;Calvin, ''Institutes of the Christian religion'', Book 2, chapter 8, quoted in:{{cite book |last= Wogaman |first= J.

''The World's Religions: Old Traditions and Modern Transformations''. Cambridge University Press. 1989. p. 376&lt;/ref&gt; A fundamentalist Christian view of conscience might be: 'God gave us our conscience so we would know when we break His Law; the guilt we feel when we do something wrong tells us that we need to repent.'&lt;ref&gt;Ninian Smart. ''The World's Religions: Old Traditions and Modern Transformations''. Cambridge University Press. 1989. p. 364&lt;/ref&gt; This can sometimes (as with the conflict between [[William Tyndale]] and [[Thomas More]] over the translation of the Bible into English) lead to moral quandaries: "Do I unreservedly obey my Church/priest/military/political leader or do I follow my own inner feeling of right and wrong as instructed by prayer and a personal reading of scripture?"&lt;ref&gt;Brian Moynahan. ''William Tyndale: If God Spare My Life''. Abacus. London. 2003 pp. 249–50&lt;/ref&gt; Some contemporary Christian churches and religious groups hold the moral teachings of the [[Ten Commandments]] or of [[Jesus]] as the highest authority in any situation, regardless of the extent to which it involves responsibilities in law.&lt;ref&gt;Ninian Smart. ''The World's Religions: Old Traditions and Modern Transformations''. Cambridge University Press. 1989. p. 353&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Gospel of John]] (7:53–8:11) (King James Version) Jesus challenges those accusing a woman of adultery stating: "'He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.'

In the [[Gospel of Luke]] (10: 25–37) Jesus tells the story of how a despised and heretical [[Samaritan]] (see [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]]) who (out of compassion and conscience) helps an injured stranger beside a road, qualifies better for eternal life by loving his neighbor, than a priest who passes by on the other side.&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie D, Motyer JA, Stibbs AM, Wiseman DLJ (eds).

This dilemma of obedience in conscience to divine or state law, was demonstrated dramatically in [[Antigone]]'s defiance of [[Creon|King Creon]]'s order against burying her brother an alleged traitor, appealing to the "[[natural law|unwritten law]]" and to a "longer allegiance to the dead than to the living".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Graves.

{{anchor|ConscienceInCatholicTheology}}[[Catholic]] [[theology]] sees conscience as the last practical "judgment of reason which at the appropriate moment enjoins [a person] to do good and to avoid evil".&lt;ref&gt;{{anchor|CCC}}''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' – English translation (U.S., 2nd edition) (English translation of the Catechism of the Catholic Church: Modifications from the Editio Typica, copyright 1997, United States Catholic Conference, Inc. – Libreria Editrice Vaticana) (Glossary and Index Analyticus, copyright 2000, U.S. Catholic Conference, Inc.). {{ISBN|1-57455-110-8}} paragraph 1778&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962–65) describes: "Deep within his conscience man discovers a law which he has not laid upon himself but which he must obey. Its voice, ever calling him to love and to do what is good and to avoid evil, tells him inwardly at the right movement: do this, shun that. For man has in his heart a law inscribed by God. His dignity lies in observing this law, and by it he will be judged. His conscience is man’s most secret core, and his sanctuary. There he is alone with God whose voice echoes in his depths."&lt;ref&gt;Vatican Council II: The Conciliar and Post Conciliar Documents. Collegeville: The Liturgical Press 1992. ''Gaudium and Spes'' 16. Cfr. Joseph Ratzinger, ''On Conscience'', San Francisco: Ignatius Press 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, conscience is not like the will, nor a habit like prudence, but "the interior space in which we can listen to and hear the truth, the good, the voice of God. It is the inner place of our relationship with Him, who speaks to our heart and helps us to discern, to understand the path we ought to take, and once the decision is made, to move forward, to remain faithful"&lt;ref&gt;Pope Francis "Jesus Always Invites Us. He Does Not Impose." Sunday, June 30, 2013 Whispers From The Loggia http://whispersintheloggia.blogspot.com.au/2013/06/jesus-always-invites-us-he-does-not.html (accessed 11 Dec 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of logic, conscience can be viewed as the practical conclusion of a moral syllogism whose major premise is an objective norm and whose minor premise is a particular case or situation to which the norm is applied. Thus, Catholics are taught to carefully educate themselves as to revealed norms and norms derived therefrom, so as to form a correct conscience.  Catholics are also to examine their conscience daily and with special care before [[Confession (religion)|confession]]. Catholic teaching holds that, "Man has the right to act according to his conscience and in freedom so as personally to make moral decisions. He must not be forced to act contrary to his conscience. Nor must he be prevented from acting according to his conscience, especially in religious matters".&lt;ref&gt;''[[#CCC|Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', paragraph 1782&lt;/ref&gt; This right of conscience does not allow one to arbitrarily disagree with Church teaching and claim that one is acting in accordance with conscience.  A sincere conscience presumes one is diligently seeking moral truth from authentic sources, that is, seeking to conform oneself to that moral truth by listening to the authority established by Christ to teach it. Nevertheless, despite one's best effort, "[i]t can happen that moral conscience remains in ignorance and makes erroneous judgments about acts to be performed or already committed&amp;nbsp;... This ignorance can often be imputed to personal responsibility&amp;nbsp;... In such cases, the person is culpable for the [[evil|wrong]] he commits."&lt;ref&gt;''[[#CCC|Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', paragraph 1790–91&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, if one realizes one may have made a mistaken judgment, one's conscience is said to be vincibly erroneous and it is not a valid norm for action.  One must first remove the source of error and do one's best to achieve a correct judgment.  If, however, one is not aware of one's error or if, despite an honest and diligent effort one cannot remove the error by study or seeking advice, then one's conscience may be said to be invincibly erroneous.  It binds since one has subjective certainty that one is correct.  The act resulting from acting on the invincibly erroneous conscience is not good in itself, yet this deformed act or material sin against God's right order and the objective norm is not imputed to the person. The formal obedience given to such a judgment of conscience is good. Some Catholics appeal to conscience in order to justify dissent, not on the level of conscience properly understood, but on the level of the principles and norms which are supposed to inform conscience.  For example, some [[priests]] make on the use of the so-called [[internal forum]] solution (which is not sanctioned by the Magisterium) to justify actions or lifestyles incompatible with Church teaching, such as Christ's prohibition of remarriage after divorce or sexual activity outside marriage. The [[Catholic Church]] has warned that "rejection of the Church's authority and her teaching&amp;nbsp;... can be at the source of errors in judgment in [[moral]] conduct".&lt;ref&gt;''[[#CCC|Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', paragraph 1792&lt;/ref&gt;
An example of someone following his conscience to the point of accepting the consequence of being condemned to death is Sir [[Thomas More]] (1478-1535).&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Willard Crompton, "Thomas More: And His Struggles of Conscience" (Chelsea House Publications, 2006); Marc D. Guerra, 'Thomas More's Correspondence on Conscience', in: ''Religion &amp; Liberty'' 10(2010)6 (https://acton.org/thomas-mores-correspondence-conscience); Prof. Gerald Wegemer, "Integrity and Conscience in the Life and Thought of Thomas More" [21 aug. 2006](http://thomasmoreinstitute.org.uk/papers/integrity-and-conscience-in-the-life-and-thought-of-thomas-more/); http://sacredheartmercy.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/A-Reflection-on-Conscience.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A theologian who wrote on the distinction between the 'sense of duty' and the 'moral sense', as two aspects of conscience, and who saw the former as some feeling that can only be explained by a divine Lawgiver, was [[John Henry Cardinal Newman]].&lt;ref&gt;Cfr. his ''Essay in Aid of a Grammar of Assent'' [1870], p. 105-106; 109vv. (https://archive.org/details/a599830700newmuoft)&lt;/ref&gt; A well known saying of him is that he would first toast on his conscience and only then on the pope, since his conscience brought him to acknowledge the authority of the pope.&lt;ref&gt;Cfr. his ''Letter to the Duke of Norfolk'' (1874), part 5: "Conscience" (http://www.newmanreader.org/works/anglicans/volume2/gladstone/section5.html)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Judaism]] arguably does not require uncompromising obedience to religious authority; the case has been made that throughout [[Jewish history]] [[rabbis]] have circumvented laws they found unconscionable, such as capital punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Harold H Schulweis. ''Conscience: The Duty to Obey and the Duty to Disobey''. Jewish Lights Publishing. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, although an occupation with national destiny has been central to the Jewish faith (see [[Zionism]]) many scholars (including [[Moses Mendelssohn]]) stated that conscience as a personal revelation of scriptural truth was an important adjunct to the [[Talmudic]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Ninian Smart.

Reidel, Dordrecht. 1987 {{ISBN|90-277-2452-0}} pp. 3–15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erik Erikson]] placed the development of ''conscience'' in the 'pre-schooler' phase of his eight stages of normal human personality development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wurgaft | first1 = LD. |  year = 1976 | title = Erik Erikson: from Luther to Gandhi | url = | journal = Psychoanalytic review | volume = 63 | issue = 2| pages = 209–33 | pmid = 788015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychologist [[Martha Stout]] terms ''conscience'' "an intervening sense of obligation based in our emotional attachments."&lt;ref&gt;Martha Stout.

''Appeals to Conscience''. Ethics 1979; 89: 315–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sigmund Freud]] regarded ''conscience'' as originating psychologically from the growth of [[civilisation]], which periodically frustrated the external expression of [[aggression]]: this destructive impulse being forced to seek an alternative, healthy outlet, directed its energy as a [[superego]] against the person's own "ego" or selfishness (often taking its cue in this regard from parents during childhood).&lt;ref&gt;Erich Fromm. ''Greatness and Limitations of Freud's Thought''. Jonathan Cape, London. 1980. pp. 126–27.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Freud, the consequence of not obeying our conscience is [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], which can be a factor in the development of [[neurosis]]; Freud claimed that both the cultural and individual super-ego set up strict ideal demands with regard to the moral aspects of certain decisions, disobedience to which provokes a 'fear of conscience'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud. "The Cultural Super-Ego" in P Singer (ed). ''Ethics''. Oxford University Press. NY 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antonio Damasio]] considers conscience an aspect of [[extended consciousness]] beyond survival-related dispositions and incorporating the search for truth and desire to build norms and ideals for behavior.

[[Michel Glautier]] argues that conscience is one of the [[instincts]] and drives which enable people to form societies: groups of humans without these drives or in whom they are insufficient cannot form societies and do not reproduce their kind as successfully as those that do.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Glautier.

[[Charles Darwin]] considered that ''conscience'' evolved in humans to resolve conflicts between competing natural impulses-some about self-preservation but others about safety of a family or community; the claim of conscience to [[moral authority]] emerged from the "greater duration of impression of social instincts" in the struggle for survival.&lt;ref&gt;Compare

&lt;/ref&gt; In such a view, behavior destructive to a person's [[society]] (either to its structures or to the persons it comprises) is bad or "evil".&lt;ref&gt;Milton Wessel. ''Science and Conscience''. Columbia University Press, New York 1980&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, conscience can be viewed as an outcome of those biological drives that prompt humans to avoid provoking [[fear]] or [[contempt]] in others; being experienced as [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and [[shame]] in differing ways from society to society and person to person.&lt;ref&gt;D'Arcy, Eric. ''Conscience and Its Right to Freedom''. Sheed and Ward, New York 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; A requirement of conscience in this view is the capacity to see ourselves from the point of view of another person.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Fogelman. ''Conscience &amp; courage: rescuers of Jews during the Holocaust''. New York: Anchor Books, c1994&lt;/ref&gt; Persons unable to do this ([[psychopathy|psychopaths]], [[Psychopathy#Psychopathy vs. sociopathy|sociopaths]], [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissists]]) therefore often act in ways which are "evil".&lt;ref&gt;George Kateb. ''Hannah Arendt: politics, conscience, evil''. Martin Robertson, Oxford. 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fundamental in this view of conscience is that humans consider some "other" as being ''in a social relationship''. Thus, [[nationalism]] is invoked in conscience to quell [[tribal]] conflict and the notion of a Brotherhood of Man is invoked to quell [[war|national conflicts]]. Yet such crowd drives may not only overwhelm but redefine individual ''conscience''. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] stated: "communal solidarity is annihilated by the highest and strongest drives that, when they break out passionately, whip the individual far past the average low level of the 'herd-conscience.'&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche "The Origins of Herd Morality" in P Singer (ed). ''Ethics''. Oxford University Press. NY 1994&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeremy Bentham]] noted that: "[[fanaticism]] never sleeps&amp;nbsp;... it is never stopped by ''conscience''; for it has pressed ''conscience'' into its service."&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Bentham. ''Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation''. (Burns JH and Hart HLA eds), Athlone Press. London. 1970 Ch 12 p. 156n.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hannah Arendt]] in her study of the trial of [[Adolf Eichmann]] in Jerusalem, notes that the accused, as with almost all his fellow Germans, had lost track of his ''conscience'' to the point where they hardly remembered it; this wasn't caused by familiarity with atrocities or by psychologically redirecting any resultant natural pity to themselves for having to bear such an unpleasant duty, so much as by the fact that anyone whose ''conscience'' did develop doubts could see no one who shared them: "Eichmann did not need to close his ears to the voice of conscience&amp;nbsp;... not because he had none, but because his conscience spoke with a "respectable voice", with the voice of the respectable society around him".&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt. ''Eichmann in Jerusalem''. Penguin Books, New York. 1994 {{ISBN|0-14-018765-0}}. pp. 95, 103, 106, 116, 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sir Arthur Keith]] in 1948 developed the [[Amity-enmity complex]]. We evolved as tribal groups surrounded by enemies; thus conscience evolved a dual role; the duty to save and protect members of the [[in-group]], and the duty to show hatred and aggression towards any [[Ingroups and outgroups|out-group]].

An interesting area of research in this context concerns the similarities between our relationships and those of [[animal]]s, whether animals in human society ([[pets]], [[working animal]]s, even animals grown for food) or in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous. {{cite web

====Evolutionary biology ====
Contemporary scientists in [[evolutionary biology]] seek to explain conscience as a function of the [[brain]] that evolved to facilitate [[altruism]] within societies.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Greenfield. ''The Quest For Identity in the 21st Century''. Sceptre. London. 2008 p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''[[The God Delusion]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] states that he agrees with [[Robert Hinde]]'s ''Why Good is Good'', [[Michael Shermer]]'s ''The Science of Good and Evil'', [[Robert Buckman]]'s ''Can We Be Good Without God?'' and [[Marc Hauser]]'s ''Moral Minds'', that our sense of right and wrong can be derived from our [[Darwinian]] past. He subsequently reinforced this idea through the lense of the [[gene-centered view of evolution]], since the unit of natural selection is neither an individual organism nor a group, but rather [[The Selfish Gene|the "selfish" gene]], and these genes could ensure their own "selfish" survival by, ''inter alia'', pushing individuals to act altruistically towards its kin.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dawkins. ''The God Delusion''. Bantam Press. London 2006 p. 215-216.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neuroscience and artificial conscience====

Numerous case studies of [[brain damage]] have shown that damage to areas of the [[brain]] (such as the anterior [[prefrontal cortex]]) results in the reduction or elimination of [[social inhibition|inhibitions]], with a corresponding radical change in behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Tranel, D. 'Acquired sociopathy': the development of sociopathic behavior following focal brain damage. Prog. Exp. Pers. Psychopathol. Res. 1994; 285–311.&lt;/ref&gt; When the damage occurs to adults, they may still be able to perform moral reasoning; but when it occurs to children, they may never develop that ability.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, J.

Attempts have been made by neuroscientists to locate the [[free will]] necessary for what is termed the 'veto' of conscience over unconscious mental processes (see [[Neuroscience of free will]] and [[Benjamin Libet]]) in a scientifically measurable awareness of an intention to carry out an act occurring 350–400 microseconds after the electrical discharge known as the 'readiness potential.'&lt;ref&gt;Libet B, Freeman A and Sutherland K (eds).

The word "conscience" derives etymologically from the Latin ''conscientia'', meaning "privity of knowledge"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', second edition, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;
or "with-knowledge". The [[English language|English]] word implies internal awareness of a moral standard in the mind concerning the quality of one's motives, as well as a consciousness of our own actions.&lt;ref&gt;Little, W, Fowler HW, Coulson J, Onions CT. ''The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary On Historical Principles''. 3rd ed. Vol 1 Clarendon Pres. Oxford. 1992. pp. 402–03.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ''conscience'' considered philosophically may be first, and perhaps most commonly, a largely unexamined "gut feeling" or "vague sense of guilt" about what ought to be or should have been done. Conscience in this sense is not necessarily the product of a process of rational consideration of the moral features of a situation (or the applicable [[normative]] principles, rules or laws) and can arise from parental, peer group, religious, state or corporate [[indoctrination]], which may or may not be presently consciously acceptable to the person ("traditional conscience").&lt;ref&gt;Peter Singer. ''Practical Ethics''. 2nd ed. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. 1993 pp. 292–95.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Conscience'' may be defined as the [[practical reason]] employed when applying moral convictions to a situation ("critical conscience").&lt;ref&gt;Peter Singer. ''Democracy and Disobedience''. Clarendon Press. Oxford. 1973. p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; In purportedly morally mature mystical people who have developed this capacity through daily [[contemplation]] or [[meditation]] combined with selfless service to others, ''critical conscience'' can be aided by a "spark" of intuitive insight or revelation (called [[marifa]] in [[Islamic]] [[Sufi]] philosophy and [[synderesis]] in medieval Christian [[scholasticism|scholastic]] [[moral philosophy]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ninian Smart. ''The Religious Experience of Mankind''. Collins. New York 1969 pp. 511–12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Langston34"&gt;Langston, Douglas C.

The Pennsylvania State University Press, University Park, Pennsylvania, 2001. {{ISBN|0-271-02070-9}} p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; ''Conscience'' is accompanied in each case by an internal awareness of 'inner light' and [[approbation]] or 'inner darkness' and condemnation as well as a resulting conviction of right or duty either followed or declined.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell Garnett A. "Conscience and Conscientiousness" in Feinberg J (ed) ''Moral Concepts''. Oxford University Press, Oxford. 1969 pp. 80–92&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medieval====

The medieval [[Islamic]] scholar and mystic [[Al-Ghazali]] divided the concept of ''[[Nafs]]'' ([[Soul (spirit)|soul]] or [[self (spirituality)]]) into three categories&lt;ref name="autogenerated1966"/&gt; based on the [[Qur’an]]:

#Nafs Ammarah (12:53) which "exhorts one to freely indulge in gratifying passions and instigates to do evil"
#Nafs Lawammah (75:2) which is "the conscience that directs man towards right or wrong"
#Nafs Mutmainnah (89:27) which is "a self that reaches the ultimate peace"

The medieval Persian philosopher and physician [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi]] believed in a close relationship between ''conscience'' or spiritual integrity and physical health; rather than being self-indulgent, man should pursue knowledge, use his intellect and apply justice in his life.&lt;ref&gt;A.J. Arberry (transl.). ''The spiritual Physik of Rhazes'' (London, John Murray 1950).&lt;/ref&gt; The medieval Islamic philosopher [[Avicenna]], whilst imprisoned in the castle of Fardajan near [[Hamadhan]], wrote his famous isolated-but-awake "Floating Man" [[sensory deprivation]] [[thought experiment]] to explore the ideas of human [[self-awareness]] and the substantiality of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]; his hypothesis being that it is through [[intelligence]], particularly the [[active intellect]], that God communicates [[truth]] to the human [[mind]] or conscience.&lt;ref name="autogenerated67"/&gt; According to the Islamic [[Sufis]] conscience allows [[Allah]] to guide people to the [[marifa]], the peace or "light upon light" experienced where a Muslim's prayers lead to a melting away of the self in the inner knowledge of God; this foreshadowing the eternal Paradise depicted in the [[Qur’ān]].&lt;ref&gt;Ninian Smart. ''The Religious Experience of Mankind''. Collins. New York. 1969. pp. 511–12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jan Van Ruysbroeck.jpg|thumb|upright|The Flemish mystic [[Jan van Ruysbroek (scholar)|Jan van Ruysbroeck]] viewed a pure conscience as facilitating "an outflowing losing of oneself in the abyss of that eternal object which is the highest and chief blessedness"]]

Some medieval Christian [[scholasticism|scholastics]] such as [[Bonaventure]] made a distinction between conscience as a rational faculty of the mind ([[practical reason]]) and inner awareness, an intuitive "spark" to do good, called ''[[synderesis]]'' arising from a remnant appreciation of absolute good and when consciously denied (for example to perform an evil act), becoming a source of inner torment.&lt;ref name="Langston34"/&gt; Early modern theologians such as [[William Perkins (Puritan)|William Perkins]] and [[William Ames]] developed a syllogistic understanding of the conscience, where God's law made the first term, the act to be judged the second and the action of the conscience (as a rational faculty) produced the judgement. By debating test cases applying such understanding conscience was trained and refined (i.e. [[casuistry]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ceri Sullivan. ''The Rhetoric of the Conscience in Donne, Herbert, and Vaughan''. Oxford University Press, Oxford. 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-19-954784-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Avicenna.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The medieval Persian philosopher [[Ibn Sina]] ([[Avicenna]]) developed a sensory deprivation thought experiment to explore the relationship between conscience and God]]

In the 13th century, [[Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas]] regarded ''conscience'' as the application of moral knowledge to a particular case (S.T. I, q. 79, a. 13).  Thus, conscience was considered an act or judgment of practical reason that began with [[synderesis]], the structured development of our innate remnant awareness of absolute good (which he categorised as involving the five primary precepts proposed in his theory of [[Natural Law]]) into an acquired habit of applying moral principles.&lt;ref name="autogenerated145"/&gt; According to Singer, Aquinas held that conscience, or ''conscientia'' was an imperfect process of judgment applied to activity because knowledge of the [[natural law]] (and all acts of natural virtue implicit therein) was obscured in most people by education and custom that promoted selfishness rather than fellow-feeling (''Summa Theologiae'', I–II, I).&lt;ref name="Thomas Aquinas pp. 247-249"&gt;Thomas Aquinas. "Of the Natural Law" in P Singer (ed). ''Ethics''. Oxford University Press. NY 1994 pp. 247–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas also discussed conscience in relation to the virtue of [[prudence]] to explain why some people appear to be less "morally enlightened" than others, their weak will being incapable of adequately balancing their own needs with those of others.&lt;ref&gt;Saarinen, R. ''Weakness of the Will in Medieval Thought From Augustine to Buridan''. Brill, Leiden. 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquinas reasoned that acting contrary to conscience is an [[evil]] action but an errant conscience is only blameworthy if it is the result of culpable or [[vincible ignorance]] of factors that one has a duty to have knowledge of.&lt;ref name="Thomas Aquinas pp. 247-249"/&gt; Aquinas also argued that conscience should be educated to act towards real goods (from [[God]]) which encouraged [[human flourishing]], rather than the apparent goods of sensory pleasures.&lt;ref name="Thomas Aquinas pp. 247-249"/&gt; In his ''Commentary'' on [[Aristotle]]'s [[Nicomachean Ethics]] Aquinas claimed it was weak will that allowed a non-virtuous man to choose a principle allowing pleasure ahead of one requiring moral constraint.&lt;ref&gt;Brain Davies. ''The Thought of Thomas Aquinas''. Clarendon Press. Oxford. 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas A Kempis]] in the medieval [[contemplative]] classic ''[[The Imitation of Christ]]'' (ca 1418) stated that the glory of a good man is the witness of a good conscience. "Preserve a quiet conscience and you will always have joy. A quiet conscience can endure much, and remains joyful in all trouble, but an evil conscience is always fearful and uneasy."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A Kempis. "The Imitation of Christ". Leo Sherley-Price (trans) Penguin Books. London. 1965 Bk II, ch. 6 ''On The Joys of a Good Conscience''. p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The anonymous medieval author of the Christian [[mystical]] work [[The Cloud of Unknowing]] similarly expressed the view that in profound and prolonged [[contemplation]] a soul dries up the "root and ground" of the [[sin]] that is always there, even after one's [[Confession (religion)|confession]] and however busy one is in [[holy]] things: "therefore, whoever would work at becoming a [[contemplative]] must first cleanse his [or her] conscience."&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous. ''The Cloud of Unknowing''. Clifton Wolters (trans.) Penguin Books. London 1965 ch. 28 p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; The medieval Flemish mystic [[John of Ruysbroeck]] likewise held that true conscience has four aspects that are necessary to render a man just in the active and contemplative life: "a free spirit, attracting itself through love"; "an intellect enlightened by grace", "a delight yielding propension or inclination" and "an outflowing losing of oneself in the abyss of&amp;nbsp;... that eternal object which is the highest and chief blessedness&amp;nbsp;... those lofty amongst men, are absorbed in it, and immersed in a certain boundless thing."&lt;ref&gt;John of Ruysbroeck. ''The Kingdom of the Lovers of God''. Kegan Paul. London. 1919. ch. III pp. 14–15 and ch XLIII p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modern====
[[File:Arthur Schopenhauer Portrait by Ludwig Sigismund Ruhl 1815.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] considered that the good conscience we experience after an unselfish act verifies that our true self exists outside our physical person]]

[[File:Spinoza.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Baruch Spinoza|Benedict de Spinoza]]: moral problems and our emotional responses to them should be reasoned from the perspective of eternity.]]
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Immanuel Kant]]: the moral law within us has true infinity.]]
&lt;/div&gt;

[[Baruch Spinoza|Benedict de Spinoza]] in his [[Ethics (Spinoza)|''Ethics'']], published after his death in 1677, argued that most people, even those that consider themselves to exercise [[free will]], make moral decisions on the basis of imperfect sensory information, inadequate understanding of their mind and will, as well as emotions which are both outcomes of their contingent physical existence and forms of thought defective from being chiefly impelled by self-preservation.&lt;ref&gt;Spinoza. ''Ethics''. Everyman's Library JM Dent, London. 1948. Part 2 proposition 35. Part 3 proposition 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The solution, according to Spinoza, was to gradually increase the capacity of our reason to change the forms of thought produced by emotions and to fall in love with viewing problems requiring moral decision from the perspective of eternity.&lt;ref&gt;Spinoza. ''Ethics''. Everyman's Library JM Dent, London. 1948. Part 4 proposition 59, Part 5 proposition 30&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, living a life of peaceful conscience means to Spinoza that reason is used to generate adequate ideas where the mind increasingly sees the world and its conflicts, our desires and passions ''sub specie aeternitatis'', that is without reference to time.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Scruton. "Spinoza" in Raphael F and Monk R (eds). ''The Great Philosophers''. Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. London. 2000. p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hegel]]'s obscure and [[mystical]] [[Philosophy of Mind]] held that the absolute right of ''freedom of conscience'' facilitates human understanding of an all-embracing unity, an absolute which was rational, real and true.&lt;ref&gt;Richard L Gregory. ''The Oxford Companion to the Mind''. Oxford University Press. Oxford. 1987 p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Hegel thought that a functioning State would always be tempted not to recognize conscience in its form of subjective knowledge, just as similar non-objective opinions are generally rejected in science.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Hegel. ''Philosophy of Right''. Knox TM trans, Clarendon Press, Oxford. 1942. para 137.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar idealist notion was expressed in the writings of [[Joseph Butler]] who argued that conscience is [[God]]-given, should always be obeyed, is intuitive, and should be considered the "constitutional monarch" and the "universal moral faculty": "conscience does not only offer itself to show us the way we should walk in, but it likewise carries its own authority with it."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Butler "Sermons" in ''The Works of Joseph Butler''. (Gladstone WE ed), Clarendon Press, Oxford. 1896, Vol II p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Butler advanced ethical speculation by referring to a duality of regulative principles in human nature: first,"self-love" (seeking individual happiness) and second, "benevolence" (compassion and seeking good for another) in ''conscience'' (also linked to the [[agape]] of [[situational ethics]]).&lt;ref name="autogenerated365"/&gt; Conscience tended to be more authoritative in questions of moral judgment, thought Butler, because it was more likely to be clear and certain (whereas calculations of self-interest tended to probable and changing conclusions).&lt;ref&gt;Henry Sidgwick. ''Outlines of the History of Ethics''. Macmillan, London. 1960 pp. 196–97.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Selden]] in his ''Table Talk'' expressed the view that an awake but excessively scrupulous or ill-trained ''conscience'' could hinder resolve and practical action; it being "like a horse that is not well wayed, he starts at every bird that flies out of the hedge".&lt;ref&gt;John Selden. ''Table Talk''. Garnett R, Valee L and Brandl A (eds) The Book of Literature: A Comprehensive Anthology. The Grolier Society. Toronto. 1923. Vol 14. p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the sacred texts of ancient [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] philosophy became available in German translations in the 18th and 19th centuries, they influenced philosophers such as [[Schopenhauer]] to hold that in a healthy mind only deeds oppress our ''conscience'', not wishes and thoughts; "for it is only our deeds that hold us up to the mirror of our will"; the ''good conscience'', thought Schopenhauer, we experience after every disinterested deed arises from direct recognition of our own inner being in the phenomenon of another, it affords us the verification "that our true self exists not only in our own person, this particular manifestation, but in everything that lives. By this the heart feels itself enlarged, as by egotism it is contracted."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer. ''The World as Will and Idea''. Vol 1. Routledge and Kegan Paul. London. 1948. pp. 387, 482. "I believe that the influence of the Sanskrit literature will penetrate not less deeply than did the revival of Greek literature in the 15th century." p xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immanuel Kant]], a central figure of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], likewise claimed that two things filled his mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe, the oftener and more steadily they were reflected on: "the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me&amp;nbsp;... the latter begins from my invisible self, my personality, and exhibits me in a world which has true infinity but which I recognise myself as existing in a universal and necessary (and not only, as in the first case, contingent) connection."&lt;ref&gt;Kant I. "The Noble Descent of Duty" in P Singer (ed). ''Ethics''. Oxford University Press. NY 1994 p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The 'universal connection' referred to here is Kant's [[categorical imperative]]: "act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law."&lt;ref&gt;Kant I. "The Categorical Imperative" in P Singer (ed). ''Ethics''. Oxford University Press. NY 1994 p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; Kant considered ''critical conscience'' to be an internal court in which our thoughts accuse or excuse one another; he acknowledged that morally mature people do often describe contentment or peace in the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] after following conscience to perform a duty, but argued that for such acts to produce virtue their primary motivation should simply be duty, not expectation of any such bliss.&lt;ref&gt;Kant I. "The Doctrine of Virtue" in ''Metaphyics and Morals''. Cambridge University Press. Cambridge. 1991. pp. 183 and 233–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Rousseau expressed a similar view that conscience somehow connected man to a greater [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] unity. [[John Plamenatz]] in his critical examination of [[Rousseau]]'s work considered that ''conscience'' was there defined as the feeling that urges us, in spite of contrary passions, towards two harmonies: the one within our minds and between our passions, and the other within society and between its members; "the weakest can appeal to it in the strongest, and the appeal, though often unsuccessful, is always disturbing. However, corrupted by power or wealth we may be, either as possessors of them or as victims, there is something in us serving to remind us that this corruption is against nature."&lt;ref&gt;John Plamenatz. ''Man and Society''. Vol 1. Longmans. London. 1963 p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Samuel Johnson by John Opie.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Samuel Johnson]] (1775) stated that "No man's conscience can tell him the right of another man."]]
Other philosophers expressed a more sceptical and pragmatic view of the operation of "conscience" in society.&lt;ref&gt;Hill T Jr "Four Conceptions of Conscience" in Shapiro I and Adams R. ''Integrity and Conscience''. New York University Press, New York 1998 p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[John Locke]] in his ''Essays on the Law of Nature'' argued that the widespread fact of human conscience allowed a philosopher to infer the necessary existence of objective moral laws that occasionally might contradict those of the state.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Woolhouse]]. ''Locke: A Biography''. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. 2007. p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Locke highlighted the [[metaethics]] problem of whether accepting a statement like "follow your ''conscience''" supports [[subject (philosophy)|subjectivist]] or [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivist]] conceptions of conscience as a guide in concrete morality, or as a spontaneous revelation of eternal and immutable principles to the individual: "if conscience be a proof of innate principles, contraries may be innate principles; since some men with the same bent of conscience prosecute what others avoid."&lt;ref&gt;John Locke. ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding''. Dover Publications. New York. 1959. {{ISBN|0-486-20530-4}}. Vol 1. ch II. pp. 71-72fn1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Hobbes]] likewise pragmatically noted that opinions formed on the basis of ''conscience'' with full and honest conviction, nevertheless should always be accepted with humility as potentially erroneous and not necessarily indicating absolute knowledge or truth.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes. ''Leviathan'' (Molesworth W ed) J Bohn. London, 1837 Pt 2. Ch 29 p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Godwin]] expressed the view that ''conscience'' was a memorable consequence of the "perception by men of every creed when the descend into the scene of busy life" that they possess [[free will]].&lt;ref&gt;William Godwin. ''Enquiry Concerning Political Justice''. Codell Carter K (ed), Clarendon Press. Oxford. 1971 Appendix III 'Thoughts on Man' Essay XI 'Of Self Love and Benevolence' p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Smith]] considered that it was only by developing a ''critical conscience'' that we can ever see what relates to ourselves in its proper shape and dimensions; or that we can ever make any proper comparison between our own interests and those of other people.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Smith. ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments''. Part III, section ii, Ch III in Rogers K (ed) Self Interest: An Anthology of Philosophical Perspectives. Routledge. London. 1997 p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Stuart Mill]] believed that idealism about the role of ''conscience'' in government should be tempered with a practical realisation that few men in society are capable of directing their minds or purposes towards distant or unobvious interests, of disinterested regard for others, and especially for what comes after them, for the idea of posterity, of their country, or of humanity, whether grounded on sympathy or on a conscientious feeling.&lt;ref name="Mill193-194"&gt;John Stuart Mill. "Considerations on Representative Government". Ch VI. In Rogers K (ed) ''Self Interest: An Anthology of Philosophical Perspectives''. Routledge. London. 1997 pp. 193–94&lt;/ref&gt; Mill held that certain amount of ''conscience'', and of disinterested public spirit, may fairly be calculated on in the citizens of any community ripe for [[representative government]], but that "it would be ridiculous to expect such a degree of it, combined with such intellectual discernment, as would be proof against any plausible fallacy tending to make that which was for their class interest appear the dictate of justice and of the general good."&lt;ref name="Mill193-194"/&gt;

[[Josiah Royce]] (1855–1916) built on the [[transcendental idealism]] view of conscience, viewing it as the ideal of life which constitutes our moral personality, our plan of being ourself, of making common sense ethical decisions. But, he thought, this was only true insofar as our ''conscience'' also required loyalty to "a mysterious higher or deeper self."&lt;ref&gt;John K Roth (ed). ''The Philosophy of Josiah Royce''. Thomas Y Crowell Co. New York. 1971 pp. 302–15.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the modern Christian tradition this approach achieved expression with [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] who stated during his imprisonment by the [[Nazis]] in [[World War II]] that ''conscience'' for him was more than practical reason, indeed it came from a "depth which lies beyond a man's own will and his own reason and it makes itself heard as the call of human existence to unity with itself."&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich Bonhoeffer. ''Ethics''. (Eberhard Bethge (ed) Neville Horton Smith (trans) Collins. London 1963 p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; For Bonhoeffer a ''guilty conscience'' arose as an indictment of the loss of this unity and as a warning against the loss of one's self; primarily, he thought, it is directed not towards a particular kind of doing but towards a particular mode of being. It protests against a doing which imperils the unity of this being with itself.&lt;ref name="autogenerated24"/&gt; ''Conscience'' for Bonhoeffer did not, like shame, embrace or pass judgment on the morality of the whole of its owner's life; it reacted only to certain definite actions: "it recalls what is long past and represents this disunion as something which is already accomplished and irreparable".&lt;ref name="Bonhoffer66"&gt;Dietrich Bonhoeffer. ''Ethics''. (Eberhard Bethge (ed) Neville Horton Smith (trans) Collins. London 1963 p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; The man with a ''conscience'', he believed, fights a lonely battle against the "overwhelming forces of inescapable situations" which demand moral decisions despite the likelihood of adverse consequences.&lt;ref name="Bonhoffer66"/&gt;[[Simon Soloveychik]] has similarly claimed that the ''truth'' distributed in the world, as the statement about human [[dignity]], as the affirmation of the line between [[good and evil|good]] and [[evil]], lives in people as conscience.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Soloveychik]].

As [[Hannah Arendt]] pointed out, however, (following the utilitarian [[John Stuart Mill]] on this point): a bad conscience does not necessarily signify a bad character; in fact only those who affirm a commitment to applying moral standards will be troubled with remorse, guilt or shame by a bad ''conscience'' and their need to regain integrity and wholeness of the self.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt.

''The Life of the Mind''. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, New York. 1978. p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Arendt believed that people who are unfamiliar with the process of silent critical reflection about what they say and do will not mind contradicting themselves by an immoral act or crime, since they can "count on its being forgotten the next moment;" bad people are not full of regrets.&lt;ref name="autogenerated191"/&gt; Arendt also wrote eloquently on the problem of languages distinguishing the word [[consciousness]] from ''conscience''. One reason, she held, was that ''conscience'', as we understand it in moral or legal matters, is supposedly always present within us, just like ''consciousness'': "and this conscience is also supposed to tell us what to do and what to repent; before it became the ''lumen naturale'' or [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s practical reason, it was the voice of God."&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt.

[[File:Albert Einstein Head Cleaned N Cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Albert Einstein]] associated conscience with suprapersonal thoughts, feelings and aspirations.]]
[[Albert Einstein]], as a self-professed adherent of [[humanism]] and [[rationalism]], likewise viewed an enlightened religious person as one whose ''conscience'' reflects that he "has, to the best of his ability, liberated himself from the fetters of his selfish desires and is preoccupied with thoughts, feelings and aspirations to which he clings because of their super-personal value."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Einstein|first=A.|year=1940|title=Science and religion |journal= [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=146 |pages=605–07|doi=10.1038/146605a0 |issue=3706 |bibcode=1940Natur.146..605E}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Einstein often referred to the "inner voice" as a source of both moral and physical knowledge: "[[Quantum mechanics]] is very impressive. But an inner voice tells me that it is not the real thing. The theory produces a good deal but hardly brings one closer to the secrets of the Old One. I am at all events convinced that He does not play dice."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gino Segre. ''Faust in Copenhagen: A Struggle for the Soul of Physics and the Birth of the Nuclear Age''. Pimlico. London 2007. p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Simone Weil]] who fought for the French resistance (the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]]) argued in her final book ''[[The Need for Roots]]: Prelude to a Declaration of Duties Towards Mankind'' that for society to become more just and protective of liberty, obligations should take precedence over rights in moral and political philosophy and a spiritual awakening should occur in the ''conscience'' of most citizens, so that social obligations are viewed as fundamentally having a transcendent origin and a beneficent impact on human character when fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;Simone Weil. ''The Need For Roots: Prelude to a Declaration of Duties Towards Mankind''. Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul. London. 1952 (repr 2003). {{ISBN|0-415-27101-0}} pp. 13 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hellman, John. ''Simone Weil: An Introduction to Her Thought''. Wilfrid Laurier, University Press, Waterloo, Ontario. 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simone Weil]] also in that work provided a psychological explanation for the mental peace associated with a ''good conscience'': "the liberty of men of goodwill, though limited in the sphere of action, is complete in that of conscience. For, having incorporated the rules into their own being, the prohibited possibilities no longer present themselves to the mind, and have not to be rejected."&lt;ref&gt;Simone Weil.

Alternatives to such [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] and [[idealism|idealist]] opinions about conscience arose from [[philosophical realism|realist]] and [[materialism|materialist]] perspectives such as those of [[Charles Darwin]]. Darwin suggested that "any [[animal]] whatever, endowed with well-marked social instincts, the parental and filial affections being here included, would inevitably acquire a moral sense or conscience, as soon as its intellectual powers had become as well, or as nearly as well developed, as in man."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Darwin. "The Origin of the Moral Sense" in P Singer (ed). ''Ethics''. Oxford University Press. NY 1994 p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Durkheim]] held that the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] and conscience were particular forms of an impersonal principle diffused in the relevant group and communicated by [[totemic]] ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Émile Durkheim. ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life''. The Free Press. New York. 1965 p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt; [[AJ Ayer]] was a more recent realist who held that the existence of ''conscience'' was an empirical question to be answered by sociological research into the moral habits of a given person or group of people, and what causes them to have precisely those habits and feelings. Such an inquiry, he believed, fell wholly within the scope of the existing [[social sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;AJ Ayer. "Ethics for Logical Positivists" in P Singer (ed). ''Ethics''. Oxford University Press. NY 1994 p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Edward Moore]] bridged the idealistic and sociological views of 'critical' and 'traditional' conscience in stating that the idea of abstract 'rightness' and the various degrees of the specific emotion excited by it are what constitute, for many persons, the specifically 'moral sentiment' or ''conscience''. For others, however, an action seems to be properly termed 'internally right', merely because they have previously regarded it as right, the idea of 'rightness' being present in some way to his or her mind, but not necessarily among his or her deliberately constructed motives.&lt;ref&gt;GE Moore. ''Principia Ethica''. Cambridge University Press. London. 1968 pp. 178–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French philosopher [[Simone de Beauvoir]] in ''A Very Easy Death'' (''Une mort très douce'', 1964) reflects within her own ''conscience'' about her mother's attempts to develop such a moral sympathy and understanding of others.&lt;ref&gt;Simone de Beauvoir.

[[Michael Walzer]] claimed that the growth of religious toleration in Western nations arose amongst other things, from the general recognition that private conscience signified some inner divine presence regardless of the religious faith professed and from the general respectability, piety, self-limitation, and sectarian discipline which marked most of the men who claimed the rights of conscience.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Walzer. ''Obligations: Essays on Disobedience, War and Citizenship''. Clarion-Simon and Schuster. New York. 1970. p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Walzer also argued that attempts by courts to define conscience as a merely personal moral code or as sincere belief, risked encouraging an anarchy of moral egotisms, unless such a code and motive was necessarily tempered with shared moral knowledge: derived either from the connection of the individual to a universal spiritual order, or from the common principles and mutual engagements of unselfish people.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Walzer. ''Obligations: Essays on Disobedience, War and Citizenship''. Clarion-Simon and Schuster. New York. 1970. p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ronald Dworkin]] maintains that constitutional protection of [[freedom of conscience]] is central to democracy but creates personal duties to live up to it: "Freedom of conscience presupposes a personal responsibility of reflection, and it loses much of its meaning when that responsibility is ignored. A good life need not be an especially reflective one; most of the best lives are just lived rather than studied. But there are moments that cry out for self-assertion, when a passive bowing to fate or a mechanical decision out of deference or convenience is treachery, because it forfeits dignity for ease."&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Dworkin. ''Life's Dominion''. Harper Collins, London 1995. pp. 239–40&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Conze]] stated it is important for individual and collective moral growth that we recognise the illusion of our conscience being wholly located in our body; indeed both our conscience and wisdom expand when we act in an unselfish way and conversely "repressed compassion results in an unconscious sense of guilt."&lt;ref&gt;Edward Conze.

[[File:John Ralston Saul.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[John Ralston Saul]]: consumers risk turning over their conscience to technical experts and to the ideology of free markets]]

[[John Ralston Saul]] expressed the view in ''The Unconscious Civilization'' that in contemporary developed nations many people have acquiesced in turning over their sense of right and wrong, their ''critical conscience'', to technical experts; willingly restricting their moral freedom of choice to limited consumer actions ruled by the ideology of the free market, while citizen participation in public affairs is limited to the isolated act of voting and private-interest lobbying turns even elected representatives against the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;John Ralston Saul. ''The Unconscious Civilisation''. Massey Lectures Series. Anansi Pres, Toronto. 1995. {{ISBN|0-88784-586-X}} pp. 17, 81 and 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue on religious or philosophical grounds that it is blameworthy to act against ''conscience'', even if the judgement of ''conscience'' is likely to be erroneous (say because it is inadequately informed about the facts, or prevailing moral (humanist or religious), professional ethical, legal and human rights norms).&lt;ref&gt;Alan Donagan. ''The Theory of Morality''. University of Chicago Press, Chicago. 1977. pp. 131–38.&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to acknowledge and accept that conscientious judgements can be seriously mistaken, may only promote situations where one's conscience is manipulated by others to provide unwarranted justifications for non-virtuous and selfish acts; indeed, insofar as it is appealed to as glorifying ideological content, and an associated extreme level of devotion, without adequate constraint of external, altruistic, normative justification, '''conscience''' may be considered morally blind and dangerous both to the individual concerned and humanity as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Beauchamp TL and Childress JF. ''Principles of Biomedical Ethics''. 4th ed. Oxford University Press, New York. 1994 pp. 478–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Langston argues that philosophers of [[virtue ethics]] have unnecessarily neglected ''conscience'' for, once conscience is trained so that the principles and rules it applies are those one would want all others to live by, its practise cultivates and sustains the virtues; indeed, amongst people in what each society considers to be the highest state of moral development there is little disagreement about how to act.&lt;ref name="autogenerated176"/&gt;[[Emmanuel Levinas]] viewed conscience as a revelatory encountering of resistance to our selfish powers, developing morality by calling into question our naive sense of [[freedom of will]] to use such powers arbitrarily, or with [[violence]], this process being more severe the more rigorously the goal of our self was to obtain control.&lt;ref name="Levinas"&gt;Emmanuel Levinas. ''Totality and Infinity: An Essay on Exteriority''. Lingis A (trans) Duquesne University Press, Pittsburgh, PA 1998. pp. 84, 100–01&lt;/ref&gt;
In other words, the welcoming of the ''Other'', to Levinas, was the very essence of ''conscience'' properly conceived; it encouraged our ego to accept the fallibility of assuming things about other people, that selfish [[freedom of will]] "does not have the last word" and that realising this has a transcendent purpose: "I am not alone&amp;nbsp;... in conscience I have an experience that is not commensurate with any a priori [see [[a priori and a posteriori]]] framework-a conceptless experience."&lt;ref name="Levinas"/&gt;

English humanist lawyers in the 16th and 17th centuries interpreted conscience as a collection of universal principles given to man by god at creation to be applied by reason; this gradually reforming the medieval [[Roman law]]-based system with forms of action, written pleadings, use of juries and patterns of litigation such as [[Demurrer]] and [[Assumpsit]] that displayed an increased concern for elements of right and wrong on the actual facts.&lt;ref&gt;Knafla LA.

[[John Rawls]] in his ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' defines a [[conscientious objector]] as an individual prepared to undertake, in public (and often despite widespread condemnation), an action of [[civil disobedience]] to a legal rule justifying it (also in public) by reference to contrary foundational social virtues (such as justice as liberty or fairness) and the principles of morality and law derived from them.&lt;ref name="John Rawls 1971. pp. 368–70"&gt;John Rawls. A Theory of Justice. Oxford University Press. London 1971. pp. 368–70&lt;/ref&gt; Rawls considered civil disobedience should be viewed as an appeal, warning or admonishment (showing general respect and fidelity to the [[rule of law]] by the non-violence and transparency of methods adopted) that a law breaches a community's fundamental virtue of justice.&lt;ref name="John Rawls 1971. pp. 368–70"/&gt; Objections to Rawls' theory include first, its inability to accommodate conscientious objections to the society's basic appreciation of [[justice]] or to emerging moral or ethical principles (such as respect for the rights of the [[natural environment]]) which are not yet part of it and second, the difficulty of predictably and consistently determining that a majority decision is just or unjust.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Singer. ''Democracy and Disobedience''. Clarendon Press. Oxford. 1973. pp. 86–91&lt;/ref&gt; ''Conscientious objection'' (also called conscientious refusal or evasion) to obeying a law, should not arise from unreasoning, naive "traditional conscience", for to do so merely encourages infantile abdication of responsibility to calibrate the law against moral or human rights norms and disrespect for democratic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Singer.

In the [[Second World War]], [[Great Britain]] granted conscientious-objection status not just to complete [[pacifist]]s, but to those who objected to fighting in that particular war; this was done partly out of genuine respect, but also to avoid the disgraceful and futile persecutions of [[conscientious objectors]] that occurred during the [[First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;Hayes D.

[[Amnesty International]] organises campaigns to protect those arrested and or incarcerated as a [[prisoner of conscience]] because of their conscientious beliefs, particularly concerning intellectual, political and artistic freedom of expression and association.&lt;ref&gt;For example see Jan Brabec, Václav Havel, Ivan Lamper, David Nemec, Petr Placak, Joska Skalnik ''et al.''

Expressed justifications for refusing to obey laws because of conscience vary. Many conscientious objectors are so for religious reasons—notably, members of the [[peace churches|historic peace churches]] are pacifist by doctrine. Other objections can stem from a deep sense of responsibility toward humanity as a whole, or from the conviction that even acceptance of work under military orders acknowledges the principle of [[conscription]] that should be everywhere condemned before the world can ever become safe for real [[democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Howard Moore.

[[Samuel Johnson]] pointed out that an appeal to conscience should not allow the law to bring unjust suffering upon another. ''Conscience'', according to Johnson, was nothing more than a conviction felt by ourselves of something to be done or something to be avoided; in questions of simple unperplexed morality, ''conscience'' is very often a guide that may be trusted.&lt;ref name="Life of Johnson 505"&gt;[[James Boswell]].

[[Civil disobedience]] as [[non-violent protest]] or [[civil resistance]] are also acts of conscience, but are designed by those who undertake them chiefly to change, by appealing to the majority and democratic processes, laws or government policies perceived to be incoherent with fundamental social virtues and principles (such as justice, equality or respect for intrinsic human dignity).&lt;ref&gt;John Rawls. ''A Theory of Justice''. Oxford University Press. London 1971. pp. 364–65.&lt;/ref&gt; Civil disobedience, in a properly functioning [[democracy]], allows a minority who feel strongly that a law infringes their sense of [[justice]] (but have no capacity to obtain legislative amendments or a referendum on the issue) to make a potentially apathetic or uninformed majority take account of the intensity of opposing views.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Singer. ''Democracy and Disobedience''. Clarendon Press. Oxford. 1973 p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; A notable example of civil resistance or [[satyagraha]] ("satya" in [[sanskrit]] means "truth and compassion", "agraha" means "firmness of will") involved [[Mahatma Gandhi]] making salt in [[India]] when that act was prohibited by a [[United Kingdom|British]] statute, in order to create moral pressure for law reform.&lt;ref&gt;Bondurant, Joan V.

==World conscience==
{{Further|Comparative religion|Universalism|World government|Cosmopolitanism|Common heritage of humanity}}

World conscience is the [[universalism|universalist]] idea that with ready global communication, all people on [[earth]] will no longer be morally estranged from one another, whether it be culturally, ethnically, or geographically; instead they will conceive ethics from the [[utopian]] point of view of the [[universe]], [[eternity]] or [[infinity]], rather than have their duties and obligations defined by forces arising solely within the restrictive boundaries of 'blood and territory.'&lt;ref name="autogenerated2001"/&gt;

Often this derives from a [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[natural law]] perspective, that for [[world peace]] to be achieved, ''conscience'', properly understood, should be generally considered as not necessarily linked (often destructively) to [[fundamentalist]] religious ideologies, but as an aspect of [[universal consciousness]], access to which is the [[common heritage of humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;Bede Griffiths. ''A New Vision of Reality: Western Science, Eastern Mysticism and Christian Faith''. Fount. London. 1992. p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; Thinking predicated on the development of ''world conscience'' is common to members of the [[Global Ecovillage Network]] such as the [[Findhorn Foundation]], international conservation organisations like [[Fauna and Flora International]], as well as performers of [[world music]] such as [[Alan Stivell]].&lt;ref&gt;William Thompson. ''Passages About the Earth: An Exploration of the New Planetary Culture''. Rider and Co. London. 1974. Ch 7. 'To Findhorn and Lindisfarne' pp. 150–83.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Non-government organizations]], particularly through their work in agenda-setting, policy-making and implementation of human rights-related policy, have been referred to as the conscience of the world&lt;ref&gt;P willets 'Introduction' in  P. Willetts (ed) The Conscience of the World. The Influence of Non-Governmental Organizations in the UN System. Hurst &amp; Co, London (1996) p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward O Wilson]] has developed the idea of [[consilience]] to encourage coherence of global moral and scientific knowledge supporting the premise that "only unified learning, universally shared, makes accurate foresight and wise choice possible".&lt;ref&gt;Edward O Wilson. ''Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge''. Abacus. London. 2003 {{ISBN|0-349-11112-X}} p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, ''world conscience'' is a concept that overlaps with the [[Gaia hypothesis]] in advocating a balance of moral, legal, scientific and economic solutions to modern transnational problems such as [[global poverty]] and [[climate change]], through strategies such as [[environmental ethics]], [[climate ethics]], [[conservation (ethic)|natural conservation]], [[ecology]], [[cosmopolitanism]], [[sustainability]] and [[sustainable development]], [[biosequestration]] and legal protection of the [[biosphere]] and [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;[[EF Schumacher]].

The [[Green party]] politician [[Bob Brown]] (who was arrested by the [[Tasmanian]] state police for a conscientious act of [[civil disobedience]] during the [[Franklin Dam]] protest) expresses ''world conscience'' in these terms: "the universe, through us, is evolving towards experiencing, understanding and making choices about its future'; one example of policy outcomes from such thinking being a global tax (see [[Tobin tax]]) to alleviate global poverty and protect the biosphere, amounting to 1/10 of 1% placed on the worldwide speculative currency market.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Brown. ''Memo For a Saner World''. Penguin Books. Melbourne. 2004. pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Such an approach sees ''world conscience'' best expressing itself through political reforms promoting democratically based [[globalisation]] or ''planetary democracy'' (for example [[internet]] voting for global governance organisations (see [[world government]]) based on the model of "one person, one vote, one value") which gradually will replace contemporary market-based globalisation.&lt;ref&gt;James Norman.

A challenge to ''world conscience'' was provided by an influential 1968 article by [[Garrett Hardin]] that critically analyzed the dilemma in which multiple individuals, acting independently after rationally consulting self-interest (and, he claimed, the apparently low 'survival-of-the-fittest' value of ''conscience''-led actions) ultimately destroy a shared limited resource, even though each acknowledges such an outcome is not in anyone's long-term interest.&lt;ref name=hardin68/&gt; Hardin's conclusion that commons areas are practicably achievable only in conditions of low population density (and so their continuance requires state restriction on the freedom to breed), created controversy additionally through his direct deprecation of the role of ''conscience'' in achieving individual decisions, policies and laws that facilitate global justice and peace, as well as [[sustainability]] and [[sustainable development]] of world commons areas, for example including those officially designated such under [[United Nations]] treaties (see [[common heritage of humanity]]).&lt;ref&gt;Axelrod, Robert.

The ancient epic of the Indian subcontinent, the [[Mahabharata]] of [[Vyasa]], contains two pivotal moments of ''conscience''. The first occurs when the warrior [[Arjuna]] being overcome with compassion against killing his opposing relatives in war, receives counsel (see [[Bhagavad-Gita]]) from [[Krishna]] about his spiritual duty ("work as though you are performing a sacrifice for the general good").&lt;ref&gt;Vyasa (Kamala Subramaniam abr.). ''Mahabharata''. Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Bombay. 1989. pp. 430–32&lt;/ref&gt; The second, at the end of the saga, is when king [[Yudhishthira]] having alone survived the moral tests of life, is offered eternal bliss, only to refuse it because a faithful dog is prevented from coming with him by purported divine rules and laws.&lt;ref&gt;Vyasa (Kamala Subramaniam abr.). ''Mahabharata''. Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Bombay. 1989. p. 742.&lt;/ref&gt; The French author [[Montaigne]] (1533–1592) in one of the most celebrated of [[Essays (Montaigne)|his essays]] ("On experience") expressed the benefits of living with a clear conscience: "Our duty is to compose our character, not to compose books, to win not battles and provinces, but order and tranquillity in our conduct. Our great and glorious masterpiece is to live properly".&lt;ref&gt;Michel de Montaigne. ''Essays''. Cohen JM (trans.) Penguin Books. Ringwood. 1984. p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt; In his famous Japanese travel journal ''[[Oku no Hosomichi]]'' (''Narrow Road to the Deep North'') composed of mixed [[haiku]] poetry and prose, [[Matsuo Bashō]] (1644–94) in attempting to describe the eternal in this perishable world is often moved in ''conscience''; for example by a thicket of summer grass being all that remains of the dreams and ambitions of ancient warriors.&lt;ref&gt;Matsuo Bashō.

[[File:Eugène Delacroix - Hamlet and Horatio in the Graveyard - WGA6199.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Eugène Delacroix]], ''[[Hamlet]] and Horatio in the Graveyard'' (1839, oil on canvas)]] The critic [[A. C. Bradley]] discusses the central problem of [[Shakespeare]]'s tragic character [[Hamlet]] as one where conscience in the form of moral scruples deters the young Prince with his "great anxiety to do right" from obeying his father's hell-bound ghost and murdering the usurping King ("is't not perfect conscience to quit him with this arm?" (v.ii.67)).&lt;ref&gt;AC Bradley. ''Shakespearean Tragedy: Lectures on Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, Macbeth''. Macmillan and Co. London. 1937. pp. 97–101&lt;/ref&gt;
Bradley develops a theory about Hamlet's moral agony relating to a conflict between "traditional" and "critical" conscience: "The conventional moral ideas of his time, which he shared with the Ghost, told him plainly that he ought to avenge his father; but a deeper conscience in him, which was in advance of his time, contended with these explicit conventional ideas. It is because this deeper conscience remains below the surface that he fails to recognise it, and fancies he is hindered by [[cowardice]] or [[Sloth (deadly sin)|sloth]] or [[passion (emotion)|passion]] or what not; but it emerges into light in that speech to Horatio. And it is just because he has this nobler moral nature in him that we admire and love him".&lt;ref&gt;AC Bradley. ''Shakespearean Tragedy: Lectures on Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, Macbeth''. Macmillan and Co. London. 1937 p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; The opening words of Shakespeare's [[Sonnet 94]] ("They that have pow'r to hurt, and will do none") have been admired as a description of ''conscience''.&lt;ref&gt;Manning Clark. ''A Discovery of Australia: 1976 Boyer Lectures''. Australian Broadcasting Commission, Sydney. 1976. p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; So has [[John Donne]]'s commencement of his poem ''[[:s:Goodfriday, 1613.

[[Anton Chekhov]] in his plays ''[[The Seagull]]'', ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'' and ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'' describes the tortured emotional states of doctors who at some point in their careers have turned their back on conscience.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Grecco. "A physician healing himself: Chekhov's treatment of doctors in the major plays" in ER Peschel (ed). ''Medicine and Literature'' (1980) pp. 3–10.&lt;/ref&gt; In his short stories, [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]] also explored how people misunderstood the voice of a tortured conscience. A promiscuous student, for example, in ''The Fit'' describes it as a "dull pain, indefinite, vague; it was like anguish and the most acute fear and despair&amp;nbsp;... in his breast, under the heart" and the young doctor examining the misunderstood agony of compassion experienced by the factory owner's daughter in ''From a Case Book'' calls it an "unknown, mysterious power&amp;nbsp;... in fact close at hand and watching him."&lt;ref&gt;Anton Chekhov. ''Selected Stories'' (J Coulson, trans.) Oxford University Press. London. 1963 p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; Characteristically, Chekhov's own conscience drove him on the long journey to [[Sakhalin]] to record and alleviate the harsh conditions of the prisoners at that remote outpost. As Irina Ratushinskaya writes in the introduction to that work: "Abandoning everything, he travelled to the distant island of [[Sakhalin]], the most feared place of exile and forced labour in Russia at that time. One cannot help but wonder why? Simply, because the lot of the people there was a bitter one, because nobody really knew about the lives and deaths of the exiles, because he felt that they stood in greater need of help that anyone else. A strange reason, maybe, but not for a writer who was the epitome of all the best traditions of a Russian man of letters. Russian literature has always focused on questions of '''conscience''' and was, therefore, a powerful force in the moulding of public opinion."&lt;ref&gt;Anton Chekhov.

[[E. H. Carr]] writes of [[Dostoevsky]]'s character the young student Raskolnikov in the novel ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' who decides to murder a 'vile and loathsome' old woman money lender on the principle of transcending conventional morals: "the sequel reveals to us not the pangs of a stricken ''conscience'' (which a less subtle writer would have given us) but the tragic and fruitless struggle of a powerful intellect to maintain a conviction which is incompatible with the essential nature of man."&lt;ref&gt;EH Carr.

And he who chooses poverty for himself and loves it possesses a great treasure and will hear the voice of his '''conscience''' address him every more clearly. He who hears that voice, which is God's greatest gift, in his innermost being and follows it, finds in it a friend at last, and he is never alone!&amp;nbsp;...

[[Johann Sebastian Bach]] wrote his last great choral composition the [[Mass in B minor]] (BWV 232) to express the alternating emotions of loneliness, despair, joy and rapture that arise as ''conscience'' reflects on a departed human life.&lt;ref&gt;J.S.

[[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s meditations on illness, conscience and mortality in the [[Late String Quartets (Beethoven)|Late String Quartets]] led to his dedicating the third movement of String Quartet in A Minor (1825) Op. 132 (see [[String Quartet No. 15 (Beethoven)|String Quartet No. 15]]) as a "Hymn of Thanksgiving to God of a convalescent".&lt;ref&gt;JWN Sullivan.

[[Image:DanielGuion.jpg|thumb|Captain Daniel Oliver Guion]]

'''Daniel Oliver Guion''' (London, 20 April 1776 – [[Ringkøbing]], 24 December 1811) was an officer of the [[Royal Navy]]. He was the son of Daniel Guion (1742–1780) – a Merchant who was befriended and professionally involved with Oliver Toulmin ([http://www.henrycort.net/07navagt.htm Navy Agent]), Major David Parry (a close friend to [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne]]) and [[Henry Cort]] and lived for some years in 35 [[Crutched Friars|Crutched Ffriars]] opposite to the Office of the [[Royal Navy]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.henrycort.net/hl18claw.htm Henry Cort, Quirks of History]&lt;/ref&gt; – and Ann (Harwood) who would be [[Matron]] of the [[London Hospital]] 1790–1797. He was the brother of Captain [[Gardiner Henry Guion]].
The Guion family were [[Huguenot]]s and probably related to the family de Guyon de Geis from France. Another [[Huguenot]] branch of this family is still living in England and a famous member of this family is [[Richard Debaufre Guyon]], general in Hungarian and Turkish service.

==Appointments==
Guion was appointed lieutenant on 18 April 1794, to [[commander#Royal Navy|commander]] on 22 May 1796 and to [[captain (Royal Navy)|captain]] on 21 May 1802.&lt;ref&gt;Archive of the Royal Navy&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1801 Commander Guion was captain of ''[[Eurus]]'', a 32-gun frigate, armed "en flute", with most of her guns removed, one of the 28 [[troop ship]]s in Admiral [[George Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith|Lord Keith`s]] fleet which carried 16,500 soldiers to [[Abu Qir Bay|Aboukir Bay]] on 2 March 1801. They began disembarking on the 8th. Daniel Guion was one of the five commanders put on shore under [[William Sidney Smith|Sir Sidney Smith]] in charge of a battalion of 1000 seamen to co-operate with the army. Along with the other captains who had served in Egypt he was awarded a Turkish gold medal by the Grand Signior.
In 1802 he was promoted to [[post-captain]] and appointed to the 50-gun [http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~pbtyc/Univ_Dir_of_GB/RN_Ships_A-Z.html HMS Trusty 1782] another [[Troop ship|troopship]].

In February 1811 he was appointed to the [[HMS St George (1785)|''St George'']] as [[flag-captain]] to Vice-Admiral [[Robert Carthew Reynolds]], commanding a detachment of the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] fleet at [[Hanö]] where merchantmen from Swedish, Finnish, Russian and Prussian ports with cargoes for England assembled to join their convoy. The last convoy of the year, 129 merchantmen, left on 1 November, but were forced back and finally left on the 9th. The convoy was dispersed by a gale on the 15th.  ''St George'' narrowly escaped being wrecked on a shoal off [[Zealand]] but lost her masts and rudder. She was floated again on the 17th and Admiral [[James Saumarez, 1st Baron de Saumarez|Saumarez]] wanted the ship to winter in Sweden but both Reynolds, and Guion said she was as fit to make the passage as any in the fleet. On Tuesday 17 December the whole fleet sailed from [[Vinga Lighthouse|Vingå]] with the ''St George'' initially in tow of the [[HMS Cressy (1810)|''Cressy'']].

With jury masts and a temporary rudder she was making fair progress when the wind backed and made the coast of [[Jutland]] a [[lee shore]]. She was unable to work off and was wrecked before the coast of [https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Thorsminde+Strand,+D%C3%A4nemark&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;sll=56.026785,8.301544&amp;sspn=0.283172,0.862427&amp;vpsrc=0&amp;hnear=Die+Nordsee+bei+Thorsminde&amp;t=m&amp;z=15 Thorsminde], 3 miles from [[Ringkøbing]], Danmark on 24 December 1811, with the loss of all but seven of the 738 on board.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Naval Biography; or Memoirs of the services of all flag-Officers, superannuated rear-Admirals, retired Captains, post.captains and Commanders, whose Names appeared on the Admiralty List of Sea-Officers at the commencement of the year 1823&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ageofnelson.org/MichaelPhillips/info.php?ref=1943 Ships of the old Navy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strandmus.dk/uk-version/index-uk.htm Strandingsmuseum St. George] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029192123/http://www.strandmus.dk/uk-version/index-uk.htm |date=29 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Daniel met and married Sara Fuller-Harnett (1792–1873) in 1809. He met Sara when he was appointed Capt of the Irish Sea-Fencibles  between Loophead and Kerry head. Sara's stepfather William Carrique Ponsonby was Capt in the Kerry Militia in this region and Williams brother Richard Ponsonby was head of customs in Tarbert. This family was not related to the famous[[Earl of Bessborough|Ponsonby]]'s from Bessborough. 
He fell in love with Miss Sally, as she was called by the family, who was a beautiful girl, but was called on account of her frightful temper the beautiful [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/fiend fiend]. They were married in her stepfather's library (against her parent's desire who nevertheless consented) and she went off with him directly.&lt;ref&gt;Archive of the Albers/Lips family in the Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://geneagraphie.com/getperson.php?personID=I2520&amp;tree=1 Genealogy of the Guion Family]&lt;/ref&gt;
Sara was the daughter of James Fuller-Harnett (d. 1794–1796) and Elizabeth Gun (d. 9 Jun 1812, Cork) who married 2ndly William Carrique Ponsonby (d. Bef 1837).&lt;ref&gt;[http://geneagraphie.com/getperson.php?personID=I10317&amp;tree=1 Genealogy of the Fuller Family]&lt;/ref&gt; The family lived in [http://humphrysfamilytree.com/Blennerhassett/crotto.html Crotto or Crotta House] [https://maps.google.com/maps?q=52.3688807,-9.6173522(Crotto,+Kerry,+Ireland+-+Sara+Ponsonby+Married++1809)&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=52.365747,-9.612179&amp;spn=0.038678,0.107803&amp;oe=ISO-8859-1&amp;om=1&amp;t=m&amp;vpsrc=0&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=52.36917,-9.619176&amp;panoid=MhPXmhMCz8g7f9FfUTm_Sw&amp;cbp=12,262.99,,0,-15.25&amp;z=14 Streetview] between [[Tarbert, County Kerry|Tarbert]] and [[Tralee]]. Ann Ponsonby, her halfsister, was obviously the only member of the family who kept contact with Sara. Anne married George Lloyd&lt;ref&gt;[http://humphrysfamilytree.com/Blennerhassett/ponsonby.william.html The Family of William Carique Ponsonby]&lt;/ref&gt; and their son George Ponsonby Lloyd is the only member of the family who is mentioned in Sara's last will.
In her Last Will, made 1867, Sara grants legacies to a memorable list of friends. Among them are 
*[[Joshua Wilson Faulkner]] and his daughter [[Alexander Faulkner Shand|Mrs Shand]] and her daughters Edith and Edrica Cowling from her 1st husband

'''Danielle Yvonne Marie Antoinette Darrieux''' ({{IPA-fr|da.niɛl i.vɔn ma.ʁi ɑ̃.twa.nɛt daʁ.jø}}; 1 May 1917 – 17 October 2017) was a French actress of stage, television and film, as well as a singer and dancer. 

Beginning in 1931, she appeared in more than 110 films. She was one of [[Cinema of France|France's great movie stars]] and her eight-decade career was among the longest in film history. She [[centenarian|turned 100]] in May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/cinema/2017/05/01/03002-20170501ARTFIG00003-mademoiselle-danielle-darrieux-fete-son-centieme-anniversaire.php|title=Mademoiselle Danielle Darrieux fête son centième anniversaire|date=1 May 2017|publisher=|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==

Darrieux was born in [[Bordeaux]], France, during [[World War I]], the daughter of Marie-Louise (Witkowski) and Jean Darrieux, a medical doctor who was serving in the [[French Army]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/obituaries/danielle-darrieux-french-film-star-is-dead-at-100.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lefigaro.fr/culture/2017/10/19/03004-20171019ARTFIG00231-le-charme-de-danielle-darrieux-agissait-egalement-dans-ses-chansons.php&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother was born in Algeria.&lt;ref name="l"&gt;{{cite news|title=Danielle Darrieux|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tk8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=%22Danielle+Darrieux%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiNpoOIr8nYAhUETLwKHdXXBvAQ6AEIMTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Danielle%20Darrieux%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 January 2018|work=Life|date=July 4, 1938|pages=39-41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father died when she was seven years old.

Raised in Paris, she studied the cello at the [[Conservatoire de Musique]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Danielle Darrieux, 100|journal=Classic Images|date=December 2017|issue=510|pages=51-52}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 14, she won a part in the [[musical film]] ''[[Le Bal (1931 film)|Le Bal]]'' (1931).&lt;ref name="fac"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marshall|first1=Bill|title=France and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History : a Multidisciplinary Encyclopedia|date=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781851094110|pages=349-350|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jfq5Tp0nq98C&amp;pg=PA349&amp;dq=%22Danielle+Darrieux%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiNpoOIr8nYAhUETLwKHdXXBvAQ6AEIUTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Danielle%20Darrieux%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her beauty combined with her singing and dancing ability led to numerous other offers; the film ''[[Mayerling (1936 film)|Mayerling]]'' (1936) brought her to prominence.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} 

In 1935, Darrieux married director/screenwriter [[Henri Decoin]],&lt;ref name="l" /&gt; who encouraged her to try [[Hollywood film industry|Hollywood]]. She signed a seven-year contract with [[Universal Studios]] to star in ''[[The Rage of Paris]]'' (1938)&lt;ref name="fac" /&gt; opposite [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.]] Afterwards, she elected to return to [[Paris]].

Under the [[German occupation of France during World War II]], Darrieux continued to perform, a decision that was severely criticized by her compatriots. However, it is reported that her brother had been threatened with deportation by [[:de:Alfred Greven|Alfred Greven]], the German manager of [[Continental Films|Continental]], the only film production company permitted in occupied France. She received a divorce and then fell in love with [[Porfirio Rubirosa]], a Dominican Republic diplomat and notorious womanizer. They married in 1942. His [[anti-Nazi]] opinions resulted in his forced residence in Germany. In exchange for Rubirosa's freedom, Darrieux agreed to make a promotional trip in Berlin. The couple lived in Switzerland until the end of the war, and divorced in 1947. She married scriptwriter Georges Mitsikidès in 1948, and they lived together until his death in 1991.
 
Darrieux appeared in the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] musical ''[[Rich, Young and Pretty]]'' (1951). [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]] lured her back to Hollywood to star in ''[[5 Fingers]]'' (1952) with [[James Mason]]. Upon returning to France, she appeared in [[Max Ophüls]]' ''[[The Earrings of Madame de...]]'' (1953) with [[Charles Boyer]], and ''[[Le Rouge et le Noir (1954 film)|The Red and the Black]]'' (1954) with [[Gérard Philippe]]. She starred in ''[[L'Amant de lady Chatterley|Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' (1955), whose theme of uninhibited sexuality led to its being proscribed by Catholic censors in the United States. She played a supporting role in her last American film, [[United Artists]]' epic ''[[Alexander the Great (1956 film)|Alexander the Great]]'' (1956) starring [[Richard Burton]] and [[Claire Bloom]].

At the request of director [[Lewis Gilbert]], Darrieux worked in England to shoot ''[[The Greengage Summer]]'' (1961) with [[Kenneth More]]. In 1963, she starred in the romantic comedy ''La Robe Mauve de Valentine'' at the [[Chatelet Theatre]] in Paris. The play was adapted from the novel by [[Françoise Sagan]]. In [[Jacques Demy]]'s film musical ''[[The Young Girls of Rochefort]]'' (1966) her supporting role was the only occasion in which a principal actor in any of Demy's film-musicals to herself sing. (All other actors had a separate person dub their singing parts.) During the 1960s, she also was a concert singer.

In 1970, Darrieux replaced [[Katharine Hepburn]] in the Broadway musical ''[[Coco (musical)|Coco]]'', based on the life of [[Coco Chanel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Paris-Hollywood: Les français dans le cinéma américain |first=Dominique |last=Lebrun |ISBN=2-85025-136-4 |publisher=Hazan}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the play, essentially a showcase for Hepburn, soon folded without her. In 1971 and 1972 she also appeared in the short-lived productions of ''[[Ambassador (musical)|Ambassador]]''. She worked again with Demy for his film ''[[Une chambre en ville]]'' (1982), an opera-like musical melodrama reminiscent of the director's earlier work ''[[The Umbrellas of Cherbourg]]'' (''Les Parapluies de Cherbourg'', 1964). Once again, Darrieux provided her own vocals for her songs.

==Honors==
For her long service to the motion picture industry, in 1985 she was given an [[Honorary César|Honorary César Award]].

==Circumstances of death==
According to investigators, witnesses saw Jessica Kelley carrying Victoria Martens to the apartment at around 10 p.m. [[Mountain Time Zone|MDT]] on August 23.&lt;ref name="Journal"/&gt; Later that night, neighbors reported hearing screaming coming from the apartment.&lt;ref name="Journal"/&gt; Shortly after, at approximately 4:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. on August 24, Michelle Martens and Fabian Gonzales left the apartment and reported to neighbors that Kelley had attacked them with an iron.&lt;ref name="Journal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kob.com/albuquerque-news/-hearing-set-for-michelle-martens-fabian-gonzales-jessica-kelley-in-victoria-martens-murder/4284786/|title=911 calls, documents reveal more info on night Victoria Martens died |last1=Costello|first1=Brittany|last2=Gregorczyk|first2=Kasia|publisher=[[KOB]], [[Associated Press]]|date=October 7, 2016|accessdate=July 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After responding to the 9-1-1 call, police entered the second-story apartment building where they saw smoke coming from behind the closed bathroom door.&lt;ref name="KOB"/&gt; Upon opening the door, the responding officers discovered the dismembered body of Victoria Martens partially wrapped in a burning blanket.&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KOB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Supervision"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Journal"/&gt; She was then pronounced dead at the scene.&lt;ref name="Autopsy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koat.com/article/autopsy-report-released-in-death-of-victoria-martens/8580051|title=Autopsy report released in death of Victoria Martens|last=Laflin|first=Nancy|publisher=[[KOAT-TV]]|date=January 10, 2017|accessdate=July 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An autopsy revealed she had been sexually assaulted, strangled to death, and then stabbed and dismembered.&lt;ref name="Autopsy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FollowUp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.abqjournal.com/970075/apd-incorrect-when-it-said-detectives-interviewed-victoria-martens-and-her-mom.html|title=APD didn’t follow up on report of ‘attempted kiss’ claim in Martens case|last=Kaplan|first=Elise|date=March 15, 2017|accessdate=August 4, 2017|publisher=''[[Albuquerque Journal]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her body was then set on fire.&lt;ref name="APD Report"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FollowUp"/&gt; Martens had been given [[Ethanol|alcohol]] and [[methamphetamine]] prior to her death, according to her mother, in order "to calm her down so [Fabian Gonzales and Jessica Kelley] could have sex with her."&lt;ref name="APD Report"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Video"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Autopsy"/&gt; Investigators determined Victoria Martens died between 7:45 and 8:30 p.m. on August 23.&lt;ref name="Plea deal" /&gt;

==Investigation and trials==
Michelle Martens, Fabian Gonzales, and Jessica Kelley were arrested and charged with the murder of Victoria Martens.&lt;ref name="KOB"/&gt; The three suspects were held on a [[United States dollar|USD$]]1 million cash-only bond.&lt;ref name="KRQE"/&gt; Martens, Gonzales and Kelley were arraigned on September 16, 2016.&lt;ref name="Plea"/&gt; Initially co-defendants, prosecutors asked the court to try Martens,. Gonzales, and Kelley in separate criminal trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.abqjournal.com/998509/prosecutors-seeks-separate-trials-in-victoria-martens-killing.html|title=Prosecutors ask for separate trials in Victoria Martens case|last=Barnitz|first=Katy|work=[[Albuquerque Journal]] |date=May 4, 2017|accessdate=July 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motion was granted in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kob.com/albuquerque-news/defense-victoria-martens-trials-seek-continuance-district-attorney-michelle-fabien-gonzales-jessica-kelley-case/4527139/|title=Defense in Victoria Martens trials seek continuance; state not opposed |last=Oppenheim|first=J.

Gonzales would be second in October 2018 and then Kelley would go on trial in January 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://krqe.com/2017/08/14/motion-hearing-for-three-suspects-in-victoria-martens-case/|title=Judge sets trial order for suspects in Victoria Martens’ murder case|first=KRQE News|last=13|date=August 14, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 29, 2018, [[Bernalillo County, New Mexico|Bernalillo County]] [[District Attorney]] Raúl Torrez announced that Michelle Martens accepted a [[plea bargain]] to one count of child abuse resulting in death.&lt;ref name="Guilty" /&gt; Torrez said in a press conference that most of the details regarding the case were "simply not true."&lt;ref name="ABQ Journal" /&gt; During the conference, the Albuquerque Police Department announced that a fourth unidentified male suspect was sought in relation to the death of Victoria Martens based on unknown [[DNA]] evidence recovered from the scene.&lt;ref name="Guilty" /&gt; According to Torrez:
*4:25 p.m.: Victoria Martens gets off the bus &amp; goes home. Michelle and Fabian aren’t present at this time.
*5:07 p.m.: Michelle &amp; Fabian return to the apartment.
*6:05 p.m.: Victoria goes to gas station with Fabian.
*6:15 to 6:20 p.m.: Victoria and Fabian return to the apartment.
*6:30 p.m.: Michelle &amp; Fabian leave and go to [[Paradise Hills, New Mexico|Paradise Hills]].
*7:02 p.m.: Michelle &amp; Fabian return to the apartment.
*7:05 p.m.: Victoria is seen alive by neighbors.
*7:06 p.m.: Michelle and Fabian leave again.
*7:38 p.m.: Michelle and Fabian are near Rio Bravo Boulevard and Coors Boulevard.
*7:59 p.m.: Michelle and Fabian are seen near Five Points and Bridge Boulevard.
*8:47 p.m.: Michelle and Fabian arrive at the apartment.
*8:48 p.m.: Eyewitnesses say Victoria’s body is seen being carried outside the apartment.&lt;ref name="Plea deal"/&gt;{{efn|All times listed are [[Mountain Daylight Time]].}}

Torrez said this proves Martens and Gonzales were not present when the murder and rape occurred.&lt;ref name="ABQ Journal" /&gt; Subsequently, Torrez announced nine of the charges against Fabian Gonzales including second-degree murder and criminal sexual penetration were dropped.&lt;ref name="Plea deal" /&gt; Gonzales still faces a series of charges including child abuse resulting in death and tampering with evidence.&lt;ref name="Plea deal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ABQ Journal" /&gt; Michelle Martens is believed to have [[false confession|falsely confessed]] to actively participating in the murder.&lt;ref name="Plea deal" /&gt; The plea bargain guarantees Martens will face 12&amp;ndash;15 years in prison; however it is possible she could have her sentence cut in half since the charge is not classified as a serious violent offense.&lt;ref name="Guilty" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Plea deal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ABQ Journal" /&gt; Michelle Martens will be sentenced after the conclusion of Gonzales' and Kelley's trials.&lt;ref name="ABQ Journal" /&gt;

===Internal investigation of the Albuquerque Police Department===
On August 4, 2017, the ''[[Albuquerque Journal]]'' reported that an investigation by the Civilian Police Oversight Agency (CPOA) found that a spokesperson from the [[Albuquerque Police Department]] "did lie" to the newspaper about the police department's response to a CYFD referral concerning Victoria Martens prior to her death.&lt;ref name="CPOA"/&gt;{{efn|The referral in question was regarding an anonymous phone tip received by the New Mexico Children, Youth and Families Department (CYFD) in March 2016 about potential [[child sexual abuse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koat.com/article/apd-investigated-over-handling-of-incident-involving-victoria-martens/9959855|title=APD investigated over handling of incident involving Victoria Martens|last=Laflin|first=Nancy|date=June 1, 2017|accessdate=August 4, 2017|publisher=[[KOAT-TV]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In December 2016, a sergeant and a commander of the Crimes Against Children Unit told police command staff, including [[Chief of Police]] Gorden Eden and a department spokesman officer, that the Albuquerque Police had received referrals from the CYFD about Martens but did not investigate.&lt;ref name="CPOA"&gt;{{cite news| last=Boetel | first=Ryan | date=August 4, 2017|url=https://www.abqjournal.com/1042922/investigation-finds-apd-lied-about-victoria-martens-case.html | title=Oversight agency says APD lied about Victoria Martens inquiry| work=[[Albuquerque Journal]] | location=[[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]|page=A1, A2 |accessdate=August 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Investigation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koat.com/article/investigation-finds-apd-spokesperson-lied-about-victoria-martens-investigation/11388693|title=Investigation finds APD spokesperson lied about Victoria Martens case|last=Ramirez|first=Sandra|publisher=[[KOAT-TV]]|date=August 4, 2017|accessdate=August 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late January 2017, two police spokespersons told the ''Albuquerque Journal'' that officers did investigate the referrals and stated that interviews with Victoria Martens and her mother had been conducted; however, this was revealed by the investigation to be false.&lt;ref name="CPOA"/&gt; In July 2017, the CPOA investigation discovered that one of the police spokespersons held correct information about the case but fabricated details in the January statements given to the ''Albuquerque Journal''.&lt;ref name="CPOA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Investigation"/&gt; Albuquerque's Citizen Police Oversight Agency voted for the officer, since removed from spokesperson duties, to be suspended for two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Boetel|first1=Ryan|title=Board votes to suspend officer who lied to newspaper|url=https://www.abqjournal.com/1046318/police-oversight-board-recommends-suspension-for-apd-spokesman-who-lied-to-journal.html|accessdate=October 30, 2017|publisher=''Albuquerque Journal''|date=August 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Eden modified this to a one-day suspension arguing that there was no evidence the officer "intentionally lied".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=APD chief recommends 1 day suspension for former spokesperson|url=http://krqe.com/2017/10/12/apd-chief-recommends-1-day-suspension-for-former-spokesperson/|accessdate=October 30, 2017|publisher=KRQE News|date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the disagreement, the case will next be reviewed by an independent monitor overseeing the Albuquerque Police Department's reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Boetel|first1=Ryan|title=Eden, police board at odds on spokesman’s suspension|url=https://www.abqjournal.com/1077148/eden-police-board-at-odds-on-spokesmans-suspension.html|accessdate=October 30, 2017|publisher=''Albuquerque Journal''|date=October 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chief of Police Gorden Eden of the Albuquerque Police Department described the murder as "the most gruesome act of evil I have ever seen in my career".&lt;ref name="APD Report"/&gt; [[Governor of New Mexico|Governor]] [[Susana Martinez]] called for a federal investigation into Martens' murder.&lt;ref name="Governor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koat.com/article/gov-martinez-asks-feds-to-investigate-victoria-martens-case/5268311|date=September 16, 2016|accessdate=July 8, 2017|title=Gov.

A birthday memorial was held for Victoria Martens on August 29, 2016.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt; Two months later, on October 29, a public funeral was held for Martens.&lt;ref name="Journal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.abqjournal.com/878197/mourners-bid-farewell-to-a-borrowed-angel.html|title=Mourners bid farewell to ‘a borrowed angel’|last=Boetel|first=Ryan|date=October 30, 2016|accessdate=August 4, 2017|publisher=''[[Albuquerque Journal]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, Victoria Martens' maternal grandparents filed a wrongful death lawsuit in the 2nd District Court against the City of Albuquerque and some of its police officers. The lawsuit alleged that their failure to investigate a report that one of Michelle Martens' boyfriends tried to kiss Victoria was negligence that led to her murder.  The lawsuit said the City of Albuquerque "had in effect policies, practices and customs that condoned and fostered the unlawful conduct of the [Albuquerque Police Department] Individual Defendants, and were a direct and proximate cause" of Victoria's murder. The lawsuit seeks policy changes and compensation for the Martens family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.abqjournal.com/1048520/martens-family-lawsuit-blames-apd-for-granddaughters-brutal-death.html|title=Updated: Martens family lawsuit blames APD for granddaughter's brutal death|last=Writer|first=Maggie Shepard {{!}} Journal Staff|date=August 15, 2017|website=www.abqjournal.com|language=en-US|access-date=August 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1858">A '''fenestra''' ('''fenestration'''; plural '''fenestrae''' or '''fenestrations''') is any small opening or pore, commonly used as a term in the [[biology|biological sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fenestra - definition of fenestra in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/fenestra|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[Latin]] for the word "window", and is used in various fields to describe a pore in an [[anatomy|anatomical]] structure.

In [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], fenestrae are found in [[cancellous bone]]s, particularly in the [[Skull#Fenestrae|skull]]. In anatomy, the [[round window]] and [[oval window]] are also known as the ''fenestra rotunda'' and the ''fenestra ovalis''. In [[microanatomy]], fenestrae are found in [[endothelium]] of [[Capillary#Fenestrated|fenestrated capillaries]], enabling the rapid exchange of [[molecule]]s between the blood and surrounding [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]. The [[internal elastic lamina|elastic layer]] of the [[tunica intima]] is a fenestrated membrane. In [[surgery]], a fenestration is a new opening made in a part of the body to enable drainage or access.

In [[plant biology]], the perforations in a [[perforate leaf]] are also described as fenestrae, and the leaf is called a fenestrate leaf.  The [[leaf window]] is also known as a fenestra, and is a translucent structure that transmits light, as in ''[[Fenestraria]]''.	

In zoology, the trilobite ''[[Fenestraspis]]'' possessed extensive fenestrae in the posterior part of the body. In the [[paleognathae]], there is an ilio–ischiatic fenestra.

{{2008 Summer Olympics}}

The '''Fuwa''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|福娃}}|p=Fúwá}}; literally "good-luck dolls", also known as "Friendlies") were the [[Olympic mascot|mascot]]s of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]]. The designs were created by [[Han Meilin]], a famous Chinese artist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cctv.com/english/special/C16296/20060929/102865.shtml CCTV] - retrieved 11 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The designs were publicly announced by the National Society of Chinese Classic Literature Studies on 11 November 2005 at an event marking the 1000th day before the opening of the games.

There are five Fuwas: Beibei, Jingjing, Huanhuan, Yingying and Nini. Together, the names form the sentence "{{linktext|北|京|欢|迎|你}}", or "Beijing huanying ni," which means "Beijing welcomes you". Originally named 'The Friendlies', they were promoted as 'Fuwa' when concerns arose that the name could be misinterpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/sports/2006-10/17/content_710034.htm |title=Mascot renamed Fuwa in English |publisher=Chinadaily.com.cn |date=17 October 2006 |accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=F|first=D|title=Not so friendly anymore|journal=Time Out|issue=November 2006|page=6|date=29 November 2006|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While originally given [[artistic licence]] in his commission, [[Han Meilin]] was subsequently requested by officials to include various Chinese designs and fauna in the Fuwa.  [[Han Meilin]] drew 1,000 models of possible Fuwa (including a [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] and an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] drum) before settling on the five characters.  He has since disowned the Fuwa and did not include them in his museum.&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"&gt;The Wall Street Journal "[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121677560339275779?mod=todays_us_page_one]."

! style="background:#ccc;"| Notes
| In traditional Chinese culture, the fish represents prosperity, as the character for fish (鱼 / 魚) sounds the same as that for surplus (余 / 餘). The "carp leaping over the dragon gate" is a traditional allegory of following one's dreams and achieving them. The pattern from Beibei's headgear comes from artifacts unearthed at [[Banpo]], site of a Neolithic village of the [[Yangshao culture]].
| As an [[endangered species]], the panda is both a national symbol of China and an international symbol of [[environmentalism]]. Jingjing's forest origins also symbolize the harmonious coexistence of humankind and nature.
| Huanhuan represents the passion of sports, the Olympic spirit of "faster, higher, stronger", and the passion of the Beijing Olympics. Huanhuan's headgear comes from a [[fire]] design in the [[Mogao Caves]], the best known of the Chinese Buddhist [[grotto]]es.
| The [[Tibetan antelope]] is an [[endangered species]] native to the [[Tibetan Plateau]], known for its swiftness. Yingying's headgear incorporates elements of [[Tibet]]an and [[Xinjiang]] ethnic costumes.
| The swallow is a messenger of spring and happiness in Chinese culture, and is seen as a symbol of good fortune. The Chinese character for swallow (燕) is also used in Yanjing (燕京), an old name for Beijing; thus the swallow alludes to Beijing. Nini's headgear uses the design of Beijing's [[sand martin]] [[kite]]s, which are colourful cross-shaped kites modeled after swallows.

==Media==

===TV series===
A 100-episode Olympic-themed cartoon series featuring the Fuwa was released in China, primarily on [[China Beijing TV Station|BTV]] (Beijing's municipal television network), on 8 August 2007. Titled ''[[The Olympic Adventures of Fuwa]]'' ({{zh|c=福娃奥运漫游记|p=Fúwá Àoyùn Mànyóujì}}), it was jointly produced by BTV and Kaku Cartoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bjreview.com.cn/exclusive/txt/2007-10/31/content_84104.htm|title=Adventuring With the Mascots|author=Wang Wenjie|publisher=Beijing Review|date=31 October 2007|accessdate=2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also two other cartoons created by CCTV.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

===Video game===
The characters made a cameo appearance in the ''[[Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games]]'' video game.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

===China Environmental Awareness Programme===
The China Environmental Awareness Programme program, started in 2001, has the Fuwa raising public environmental awareness by spreading clean, green messages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undp.org.cn/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;catid=14&amp;topic=6&amp;sid=345&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0] Five FuWa to star in a national campaign to promote Green Olympics.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fuwa theater show===
A large-scale fairy-tale drama entitled Friendlies (or Fuwa) has been directed by Beijing Children's Art Theater Cooperative to promote the five mascots of the 2008 Beijing Olympics. As ambassadors of peace, the Fuwa will make a world-tour, visiting all seven [[continent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.piao.com.cn/en_piao/ticket_1638.html] Large-scale Fairy Tale Friendlies (Fuwa).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parodies===
Groups seeking to raise political issues in tandem with China's hosting of the Olympic Games have used the Fuwa or have created similar mascots.

* Nu Wa, a monkey with a red bandana, was created by [[Amnesty International]]. Nu Wa means "angry young boy".&lt;ref&gt;Uncensor.com.au "[https://web.archive.org/web/20080818115324/http://uncensor.com.au/uncensor/info/nuwa/ Uncensor]."

* Play Fair 2008, a campaign organised by the [[Clean Clothes Campaign]] (CCC), the [[International Trade Union Confederation]] (ITUC), and the [[International Textile, Garment and Leather Workers' Federation]] (ITGLWF) to raise awareness for the rights of workers involved in the sporting goods industries, have used the Fuwa.&lt;ref&gt;Playfair "[http://www.playfair2008.org/]."

* Gengen Genocide, a brown and yellow character wearing a gun and a fuel pump nozzle head-dress that forms a [[Skull and crossbones (poison)|skull and crossbones]], was developed by a group seeking to raise attention to the People's Republic of China's involvement in [[Darfur]].  Gengen's name is derived from the term [[genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.theage.com.au/olympics/ "[http://blogs.theage.com.au/olympics/stephenhutcheon/2008/07/20/meettheevilo.html/ Meet the evil Olympic mascot] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518013641/http://blogs.theage.com.au/olympics/stephenhutcheon/2008/07/20/meettheevilo.html |date=18 May 2015 }}." Retrieved on 2013-05-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Beijing residents have allegedly created their own Fuwa set consisting of a duck, a dragonfly and a taxi.  Collectively their names—"Ya", "Ting", "De"—spell out "bastard" in Beijing slang.&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"/&gt; (Note that among friends, "ni ya ting de", which means "you bastard", is a common term of endearment but is considered crude by many.)

'''Henry Richard (Harry) Smith''' (September 11, 1873 &amp;ndash; October 24, 1928) was a politician and [[physician]] in [[Alberta]], Canada.  He served on [[Edmonton City Council]] from 1912 until 1914 and as president of the Edmonton [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Conservative]] Association and the [[Alberta Medical Association]].

==Early life==

Harry Smith was born September 11, 1873 in [[New Hamburg, Ontario|New Hamburg]], [[Ontario]].  He was educated in [[Oxford County, Ontario|Oxford County]] and at the [[Woodstock Collegiate Institute]] in [[Woodstock, Ontario|Woodstock]], [[Ontario]], and studied medicine at [[University of Trinity College|Trinity University]] in [[Toronto]], from which he graduated in 1899.  He did post-graduate work in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] and [[London]], [[England]], and was house surgeon at [[Toronto General Hospital]] upon his return.

In 1901, he moved west to Alberta and practiced medicine in [[Star, Alberta|Star]] for a year and a half before relocating again to Edmonton.  There he specialized in surgery.  In 1910 he was elected president of the [[Alberta Medical Association]], and in 1912 was appointed to the board of directors of [[Alberta College]].

In 1901, he married Martha Doyle, with whom he would have a daughter.  Martha died in January 1901, and Smith married Mabel Rife, with whom he would have a son and a daughter.

==Politics==

Smith ran for the Edmonton public school board in the [[Edmonton municipal election, 1910|1910 municipal election]], but was defeated, finishing fourth of six candidates in an election in which the top three were elected.  In [[Edmonton municipal election, December 1912|1912]] he ran for and was elected as alderman on the [[Edmonton City Council]], finishing first of seventeen candidates.  He did not seek re-election at the conclusion of his two-year term.

==Later life and death==

In 1921, after several years as city [[coroner]], Smith was appointed medical superintendent for the [[Royal Alexandra Hospital (Edmonton)|Royal Alexandra Hospital]], where he was credited with vastly improving the hospital's financial position and with advocating for the creation of a children's hospital.  He remained active with the [[Freemasonry|Masons]] and the [[Independent Order of Odd Fellows]], and was a [[Methodist]].

He was taken with [[erysipelas]] October 21, 1928, and died three days later.

'''Helen Hopekirk''' (20 May 1856 – 19 November 1945) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] pianist and composer who lived and worked in [[Boston]].

==Life and career==
Helen Hopekirk was born near [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]], a daughter of music shop owners Adam and Helen (née Croall) Hopekirk. She studied music with [[George Lichtenstein (musician)|George Lichtenstein]] and Scottish composer [[Alexander Mackenzie (composer)|Alexander Mackenzie]], and made her debut as a soloist in 1874 with the Edinburgh Amateur Orchestral Society. After other successful performances and the death of her father, she relocated to study composition with [[Carl Reinecke]] in [[Leipzig]]. After successful debuts in Leipzig and [[London]], she began regular concert tours of [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oboeclassics.com/~oboe3583/ambache/wHopekirk.htm|accessdate=21 December 2010|title=Women of Note}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1882 Hopekirk married Edinburgh merchant and music critic William A. Wilson (d. 1926), who began serving as her manager. She made her American debut in 1883 with the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] and commenced concert tours in the United States. She planned to continue her studies with [[Franz Liszt]], but after his death studied instead with [[Theodor Leschetizky]] in Vienna and Czech composer [[Karel Navrátil]] in [[Prague]]. She and her husband lived in Vienna until 1892, and then moved to Paris, where she began to teach piano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IvoQQU1QL_QC&amp;pg=PR14&amp;dq=Helen+Hopekirk+(1856%E2%80%931945)++norton&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=HP0QTfXaFYH-8AaekczrDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Norton/Grove dictionary of women composers|format=Digitized online by GoogleBooks|first=Julie Anne|last=Sadie|first2=Rhian|last2=Samuel|year=1994|accessdate=21 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her husband was injured in a traffic accident, and in 1897 she accepted the invitation of Director [[George Whitefield Chadwick|George Chadwick]] to take a teaching position at the [[New England]] Conservatory. In 1901 she left the Conservatory and became a private teacher, also continuing her performance career. Hopekirk and her husband became American citizens in 1918. Her last performance was at Steinert Hall, Boston, in 1939. She died in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], of a [[cerebral thrombosis]] and was buried in the Mount Auburn Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Notable American Women 1607–1950: A Biographical Dictionary|first=Edward T.|last=James|first2=Janet Wilson|last2=James|year=1971|format=Digitized online by GoogleBooks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rVLOhGt1BX0C&amp;pg=RA1-PA218&amp;lpg=RA1-PA218&amp;dq=george+lichtenstein+music&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mawKnMP6gm&amp;sig=jXGhGGzS6ULvEyzzbgZMGw-MLTw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wPQzT9v_F8-3tweb9MSlAg&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=george%20lichtenstein%20music&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3175">The '''home of the future''', similar to the [[office of the future]], is a concept that has been popular to explore since the early 20th century, or perhaps earlier. There have been many exhibits, such as at [[World's Fair]]s and [[theme park]]s, purporting to show how future homes will look and work, as well as standalone model "homes of the future" sponsored by builders, developers or technology companies. After a few years, each successive version of such an exhibit will start to look dated and old-fashioned, with some of its "futuristic" things becoming commonplace and others never catching on at all.

The film ''[[Design for Dreaming]]'' (1956) shows a [[Frigidaire]] "Kitchen of the Future"—part of the 1956 [[General Motors]] [[General Motors Motorama|Motorama]]—which features centralized controls and a "computer screen" showing a completed recipe. General Motors also presented ''[[A Touch of Magic]]'' (1961), which also showed a Frigidaire kitchen of the future.

In the 1960s and 1970s, such exhibits usually included [[videophone]]s. While such technology has actually existed since the 1960s and has been developed and improved since, many new mobile phones can now make video calls and use of a home web camera on an [[instant messaging]] client and  sending of pictures via cell-phone cameras has become prevalent. Other common features of "home of the future" exhibits include centralized and automated control of all appliances, and the use of voice commands to operate devices. Since the 1980s, [[computer]] technology has figured heavily in the design of these homes.

The [[Monsanto House of the Future]], a house made entirely of plastics in [[Disneyland]] from 1957 to 1967, was a famous example in this genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5360871 |title=Chasing a Habitable 'Home of the Future' |first=Laura |last=Sydell |work=Morning Edition |publisher=NPR |date=May 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''ideal''' is a [[principle]] or [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]] that one actively pursues as a [[goal]], usually in the context of [[ethics]], and one's prioritization of ideals can serve to indicate the extent of one's dedication to each. For example, someone who espouses the ideal of [[honesty]], but is willing to [[lie]] to protect a friend, demonstrates not only devotion to [[friendship]], but also belief in its supersedence of honesty in importance.

The belief in ideals is called '''ethical idealism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rescher|first=Nicholas|title=Ethical Idealism: An Inquiry into the Nature and Function of Ideals|year=1987|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, California|isbn=0520078888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In applied ethics==
In some theories of [[applied ethics]], such as that of [[Rushworth Kidder]], there is importance given to such orders as a way to [[dispute resolution|resolve disputes]].  In [[law]], for instance, a [[judge]] is sometimes called on to resolve the balance between the ideal of [[truth]], which would advise hearing out all evidence, and the ideal of fairness.

==In politics==
In [[politics]] ideals play a pivotal role.  During the [[French Revolution]], the principles of "[[Liberté, égalité, fraternité|Liberty, Equality, Brotherhood]]" were raised to the status of ideals. The [[Green_Party_of_the_United_States#Ideology|Ten Key Values of the US Green Party]] are likewise raised to such status today. In fact, most political movements have a certain set of ideals. However, in many cases, one can easily find instances where ideals were "not lived up to" - some of which are cases where one simply proved to outweigh another for some specific decision, or where all were compromised simply to retain the [[power (sociology)|power]] to continue to pursue them.

==Idols and heroes==
A different form of ideal is an [[idolatry|idol]] or [[hero]], who is held up as a [[moral example]].  Since this is an actual person or fictional character, it is too complex and multi-faceted to be considered an ideal in the abstract sense. However, when they are encountered in the form of a story, with only a few traits on display, they are a simplified [[archetype]] from which one can very easily derive [[stereotype]]s or mimicry.  In [[Islam]], for instance, the life of [[Muhammad]] is held up as "ideal", but must be interpreted for believers through the tale of his life, or [[Sirah Rasul Allah|sira]], and his many sayings, the [[hadith]].

==Ideal and virtue==
Given the complexity of putting ideals into practice, and resolving conflicts between them, it is not uncommon to see them reduced to [[dogma]]. One way to avoid this, according to [[Bernard Crick]], is to have ideals that themselves are descriptive of a process, rather than an outcome.  His [[political virtues]] try to raise the practical habits useful in resolving disputes into ideals of their own.  A [[virtue]], in general, is an ideal that one can make a [[habituation|habit]].

==Relative ideal==
In formal axiology, [[Robert S. Hartman]] contended that being ideal means that something is the best member of the set of all things of that class. For example, the ideal student is the best member of the set of all students in exactly the same way that the ideal circle is the best circle that can be imagined of the class of all circles. Since we can define the properties that the ideal member of a class should have, the value of any actual object can be empirically determined by comparing it to the ideal. The closer an object's actual properties match up to the properties of the ideal, the better the object is. For example, a bumpy circle drawn in the sand is not as "good" as a very smooth one drawn with a compass. In the world in general, each particular object ought to become more like its ideal. In [[ethics]], by analogy, each person should attempt to become more of an ideal person, and a person's morality can actually be measured by examining how close they live up to their ideal self.

'''James Cook Ayer''' (5 May 1818 in [[Groton, Connecticut]] &amp;ndash; 3 July 1878 in [[Winchendon, Massachusetts]]) was the wealthiest [[patent medicine]] businessman of his day.&lt;ref name="NYT_Obit"&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1878/07/04/80720683.pdf |title=Obituary|date=July 4, 1878|accessdate=2008-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
At the age of 13, he moved to [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], and resided there with his uncle.  Ayer was also brother of wealthy industrialist [[Frederick Ayer]].

His education was obtained at the public schools, where at one time he was a classmate of [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Gen. Butler]], and subsequently at the [[Westford Academy]], after which he was apprenticed to James C. Robbins, a druggist in Lowell. While there he studied medicine, and later he graduated from the medical school of the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=acab&gt;{{Appletons'|wstitle=Ayer, James Cook|year=1900|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[Image:middle st lowell ma.jpg|thumb|Dr Ayer's laboratory on right, in Lowell.]]
Ayer never practiced medicine, but devoted his principal attention to [[pharmaceutical chemistry]] and the compounding of medicines. His success in this line was very great, and soon led him to establish a factory in Lowell for the manufacture of his medicinal preparations, which became one of the largest of its kind in the world, and was magnificently equipped. He accumulated a fortune estimated at $20,000,000.&lt;ref name=acab/&gt;

Much of his success was due to his advertising, on which he spent $140,000 a year, and he annually published an [[almanac]], distributing 5,000,000 copies each year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Editions in English, French, German, Portuguese, and Spanish, were regularly issued. In 1874 he accepted the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nomination for the [[United States Congress]] in the 7th Massachusetts District, but was defeated.&lt;ref name=acab/&gt;

In addition to his patent medicine business, Dr. Ayer was involved in textile production in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]] with his brother.

==Personal life==
His son, Frederick Fanning Ayer, born 1851, became a lawyer and philanthropist, and was director or stockholder of many corporations.&lt;ref name="ff_ayer"&gt;[http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~mabiog/Middlesex_County/ayerfredrickf.htm Short Bio on F.F. Ayer, 1914]&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in an insane asylum on July 3, 1878 and is interred at [[Lowell Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="NYT_Obit" /&gt; 

===Legacy===
The town of [[Ayer, Massachusetts|Ayer, Mass.,]] was named after him.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/james-cook-ayer-sarsaparilla-king-lowell-mass/|title=James Cook Ayer, Sarsaparilla King of Lowell, Mass. - New England Historical Society|date=2014-05-05|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Jet was born in [[Liverpool]] in the Iada kennel of Mrs Babcock Cleaver in July 1942. He was a black [[German Shepherd Dog]], and in the kennel was initially called Jett, with his full pedigree name being Jet of Iada.  He was loaned to be trained at the War Dogs School in [[Gloucester]] from the age of nine months, where he was trained in anti-sabotage work.&lt;ref name="liverpoolmuseums"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jet of Iada |url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/online/exhibitions/dogs/jet.asp |publisher=Liverpool Museums |accessdate=11 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309223441/http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/online/exhibitions/dogs/jet.asp |archivedate= 9 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In Pictures: Heroic Dogs|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8688540.stm|accessdate=11 October 2010|newspaper=BBC News|date=17 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="herodogs"&gt;{{cite news|last=Harris|first=Paul|title=The Magnificent Seven: Hero dogs that saved hundreds during the Blitz are honoured|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1278928/Hero-dogs-saved-hundreds-Blitz-honoured.html|accessdate=11 October 2010|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=17 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following eighteen months work on airfields performing anti-sabotage duties he was returned to the school for further training in search and rescue duties where he was partnered with Corporal Wardle.&lt;ref name=iwm/&gt;

They were relocated to London where Jet was known for calling out every night until the end of the air attacks.&lt;ref name=herodogs /&gt; Corporal Wardle and Jet were the first handler and dog to be used in an official capacity in Civil Defence rescue duties.&lt;ref name=iwm/&gt;

==Awards==
He was awarded the [[Dickin Medal]] on 12 January 1945 for saving the lives of over fifty people trapped in bombed buildings.&lt;ref name=iwm/&gt;&lt;ref name="first1k"&gt;{{cite book|last=McIntyre-Brown|first=Arabella|title=Liverpool: the First 1,000 years |year=2001|publisher=Garlic Press Publishing Ltd|isbn=978-1-904099-00-0|page=106|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lZpv_5a7sNUC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=jet+dickin+medal&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1WWzTPz6IpqJ4gaN77H1Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=jet%20dickin%20medal&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dedication read "For being responsible for the rescue of persons trapped under blitzed buildings while serving with the Civil Defence Services of London."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker|first=Robyn|title=Sergeant Gander: A Canadian Hero|year=2009|publisher=Natural Heritage Books|isbn=978-1-55488-463-6|pages=97|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A2G9D7uuTnkC&amp;pg=PA97&amp;dq=jet+dickin+medal&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1WWzTPz6IpqJ4gaN77H1Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=jet%20dickin%20medal&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the war, he was returned to his owner in Liverpool.&lt;ref name=extracts /&gt;  The Dickin Medal is often referred to as the animal metaphorical equivalent of the [[Victoria Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Long|first1=David|title=The animals' VC: for gallantry and devotion: the PDSA Dickin Medal - inspiring stories of bravery and courage|date=2012|publisher=Preface|location=London|isbn=9781848093768|ref=long2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 August 1947, an explosion occurred in the William Pit near [[Whitehaven]], [[Cumbria]].

'''John Aisance''' ([[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]] name '''Aisance''') was a chief among the [[Chippewas of Lakes Huron and Simcoe]] and leader of the Otter clan of that people&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/aisance_john_7E.html&lt;/ref&gt; from at least 1815&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1370372152585/1370372222012#ucls15 (Treaty 16)&lt;/ref&gt; until his death in 1847. He participated in the [[Lake Simcoe–Lake Huron Purchase]] in 1815, served the provincial government during the [[Upper Canada Rebellion]], and was the first and founding chief of the [[Beausoleil First Nation]].

==Early Life and Land Treaties==
Aisance's father, also called Aisance, preceded him as chief and clan leader. Their identical names have created confusion and debate among historians. The family's principal territorial interests seem to have lain in [[Penetanguishene]] and the surrounding area. It was the elder Aisance, apparently, whose name is recorded among the five [[Ojibwe]] chiefs who authorized the surrender of the area to the provincial government in the [[Penetanguishene Bay Purchase]] in 1798.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1370372152585/1370372222012#ucls15 (Treaty 5)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1815, the younger Aisance participated alongside two other chiefs, including [[William Yellowhead|Musquakie]], the future head chief, in authorizing the [[Lake Simcoe–Lake Huron Purchase]], surrendering 250,000 acres of territory extending from the Penetanguishene area to the north shore of [[Kempenfelt Bay]] (present-day North [[Simcoe County|Simcoe]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1370372152585/1370372222012#ucls15 (Treaty 16)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coldwater==
In 1817, Musquakie succeeded his father [[Yellow Head of Lake Simcoe|Yellow Head]] as head chief of the Chippewas of Lakes Huron and Simcoe. The next year, he four other chiefs authorized the [[Lake Simcoe–Nottawasaga Purchase]], surrendering 1,600,000 acres of territory west of Lake Simcoe to the government.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1370372152585/1370372222012#ucls15 (Treaty 18)&lt;/ref&gt; Aisance was not involved in this purchase—the Otter clan was represented instead by Muskigonce—which left the Ojibwe with virtually no territory of their own, although they reserved the right to continue to range and hunt across the land they had relinquished.

In 1828, the Ojibwe reportedly "expressed a strong desire to be admitted to Christianity, and to adopt the habits of civilized life".&lt;ref&gt;Murray (ed.), ''Muskoka and Haliburton'', 104&lt;/ref&gt; When they converted to [[Methodism]] later that year, Aisance, the foremost of Musquakie's subordinate chiefs, set an example by dismissing two of his three wives.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/aisance_john_7E.html&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably it was now that he adopted the Christian name John. In 1830, the Ojibwe were induced by Lieutenant Governor [[John Colborne, 1st Baron Seaton|John Colborne]] to settle permanently in two purpose-built villages, one at Atherley Narrows between Lakes Simcoe and [[Lake Couchiching|Couchiching]], where Musquakie settled with a part of his people, and the other at Gissinausebing, or [[Severn, Ontario|Coldwater]], where Aisance settled with the remainder of the Ojibwe.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (ed.), ''Muskoka and Haliburton'', 109&lt;/ref&gt; The house built for him there by the government was the only frame house in a village otherwise made up of log houses, in recognition of his chiefly status.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (ed.), ''Muskoka and Haliburton'', 110&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Colborne's agents considered that this settlement and "civilizing" experiment was succeeding, Aisance quickly became disillusioned with the government agents and Methodist missionaries with whom he was obliged to deal. In 1832 he even converted to [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/aisance_john_7E.html&lt;/ref&gt; his band following suit. In 1836, [[Francis Bond Head]] replaced Colborne as Lieutenant Governor and soon brought the experiment to an end. He opened talks with Musquakie and Aisance and persuaded them to leave the Simcoe-Coldwater corridor (which had remained Crown land), enticing them with the promise of one-third of the proceeds of the anticipated sales of lots there to European settlers.&lt;ref&gt;''Indian Treaties and Surrenders'', Vol. 1, 117 (Treaty 48)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1842, Aisance joined four other chiefs in signing Musquakie's complaint to Governor General [[Charles Bagot]], protesting that Bond Head had not fully explained the 1836 purchase agreement, and had, in particular, not made it clear that it did not involve an upfront, lump-sum payment, nor that the Ojibwe would receive only one-third of the sale proceeds.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (ed.), ''Muskoka and Haliburton'', 115-16&lt;/ref&gt; At their request, the proceeds of the piecemeal sales of lots in the Simcoe-Coldwater corridor were subsequently banked so that the Ojibwe could receive an annual income from the interest, which they divided three ways between Musquakie's band, Aisance's band and a third band led by [[Joseph Snake]] settled on the islands of Lake Simcoe.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (ed.), ''Muskoka and Haliburton'', 119&lt;/ref&gt; The chiefs also claimed ongoing Ojibwe ownership of the grist mill at Coldwater, which finally passed from their hands in 1849.

==Upper Canada Rebellion==
Towards the end of 1838, Bond Head called the Chippewas of Lakes Huron and Simcoe to arms to help keep the peace in the wake of the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837-38. Aisance dutifully assembled twenty-one warriors, abandoning the autumn hunt in the process, and followed Musquakie to an encampment at [[Holland Landing, Ontario|Holland Landing]]. The Ojibwe were soon dismissed, at which they complained "most bitterly" to government agents that the small stipend paid to them for this brief period of service was too little to offset the economic blow of having been compelled to abandon their hunting. In response to this outcry, the government approved the payment of rations to the Ojibwe until the end of February 1839.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (ed.), ''Muskoka and Haliburton'', 114&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beausoleil Island==
As a consequence of the 1836 purchase agreement with Bond Head, the Ojibwe were required to abandon the villages built for them by Colborne. In 1842, Aisance and his band left Coldwater and relocated to [[Beausoleil Island]] in [[Georgian Bay]], a move that brought them closer to their chief's native country around Penetanguishene. Henceforth the Chippewas of Beausoleil Island conducted themselves as a distinct people from Musquakie's band, who had settled at Rama.

Under Aisance's leadership, the Beausoleil settlement prospered modestly in stark contrast to the decay that reportedly took place at Rama. The Ojibwe, numbering 232 persons in 1842, grew steadily more able at growing corn and potatoes, rearing livestock, and making sugar, and their settlement grew slowly, eventually adding a school house.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (ed.), ''Muskoka and Haliburton'', 121&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding a promising beginning, Aisance, frustrated by the poor soils on the island (which some blamed on the Ojibwe's cultivating technique), almost immediately hatched a plan for relocating westwards to the more fertile [[Christian Island]] which the chief did not live to see come to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/aisance_john_7E.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 1856, the Chippewas of Beausoleil Island joined "a few Pottawatamies and Ottawas" already settled on Christian Island,&lt;ref&gt;Murray (ed.), ''Muskoka and Haliburton'', 121&lt;/ref&gt; their arrival marking the beginnings of the present-day Beausoleil First Nation, whose [[Christian Island 30|main reserve]] is still on Christian Island.

John Aisance died in 1847, reportedly drowning in a canoeing accident.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/aisance_john_7E.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pauahi''' (c.1804–1826) was a member of the royal family of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] in the  [[House of Kamehameha]]. Referred as '''Pauahi''' in her lifetime, she is often referred to as '''Kalanipauahi''' or '''Kalani Pauahi''' to differentiate her from her niece and namesake [[Bernice Pauahi Bishop]].

==Life==
Pauahi was born circa 1804.
Her mother was Keouawahine, daughter of Kauhiwawaeono of Maui by his wife, chiefess Loe-wahine, who in turn was daughter of [[Kameʻeiamoku|Kame{{okina}}eiamoku]]. Her father was the High Chief [[Pauli Kaʻōleiokū]] (1767–1818).

The name ''Pauahi'' originated in an incident which occurred in her childhood. By an accidental explosion of gunpowder she narrowly escaped being burned to death. Five men were killed in the catastrophe, her mother house was burned to the ground, and she was badly injured.  In commemorating her escape she was given the name, which is compose of two Hawaiian words, ''pau'', "finished", or "completed" and ''ahi'', "fire", which,  translated, means, "the fire is out".&lt;ref name="bernice"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Memoirs of Hon. Bernice Pauahi Bishop |author= Mary Hannah Krout |pages= 19–20 |publisher= The Knickerbocker Press |year= 1909 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=sJWPTcOemmsC&amp;pg=PA19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Procession to commemorate the death of King Tamaha-meha.jpg|thumb|300px|Celebratory procession of the feast of Kamehameha, 1823. Pauahi's float is probably in the background.]]
[[File:Funeral procession of Keopuolani from her posthumous memoir.jpg|thumb|300px|Pauahi, alongside the pall-bearers in the center of funeral procession of Queen [[Keōpūolani]], 1823.]]
She married her uncle [[Kamehameha II]] as one of his five consorts. Kamehameha II was a younger son of Kamehameha I so Pauahi was only seven years younger than her uncle. During the accession of Kamehameha II, Pauahi commemorated the fire incident of her childhood by descending from the couch in which she had been borne in the procession, and setting it on fire with all the elaborate decorations. Her attendants imitating her example and cast clothing, both traditional [[tapa cloth]], and costly foreign cloth, into the flames.&lt;ref name="bernice"/&gt;

Her first husband Kamehameha II died in London in 1824 and she became Queen dowager like all his other wives at a very young age. She remarried to Prince Kahalai{{okina}}a Luanu{{okina}}u. Her second husband was [[Governors of Kauai|Governor of Kaua{{okina}}i island]], a nephew of king Kamehameha I, being the only son of the king's brother Kala{{okina}}imamahu and his wife [[Wahinepio|Kahakuha{{okina}}ako{{okina}}i Wahinepio]]. She soon divorced Kahalai{{okina}}a and remarried on November 28, 1825 her third husband, [[Kekūanāoʻa|Mataio Kekūanāoʻa]]. Her daughter [[Keʻelikōlani|Ruth Keʻelikōlani]] was born June 17, 1826, after she had been married to Kekūanāo{{okina}}a for only seven months. Her daughter's unorthodox birth was a reason Ke{{okina}}elikōlani was regarded somewhat outside the legitimate Hawaiian nobility. Her daughter's claim to royal heritage was because she herself was a member of the [[House of Kamehameha]], and Hawaiian culture valued royal blood in a mother perhaps more than that of a father. Pauahi died giving birth to Ke{{okina}}elikōlani, although the cause was said to have been a flu type of illness which killed many people in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;Hawaií in 1819: A Narrative Account By Louis Claude Desaulses de Freycinet, Marion Kelly.

Assassination attempts and plots on the [[President of the United States]] have been numerous, ranging from the early 19th century to the 2010s. More than 30 attempts to kill an [[incumbent]] or former president, or a [[President-elect of the United States|president-elect]] have been made since the early 19th century. Four sitting presidents have been killed, all of them by gunshot: [[Abraham Lincoln]] (1865), [[James A. Garfield]] (1881), [[William McKinley]] (1901), and [[John F. Kennedy]] (1963). Additionally, two presidents have been injured in attempted assassinations, also by gunshot: [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (1912; former president at the time) and [[Ronald Reagan]] (1981).

Although the historian James W. Clarke has suggested that most American assassinations were politically motivated actions, carried out by rational men,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Assassins: The Darker Side of Politics|publisher=Princeton University Press|author=Clarke, J. W.|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; not all such attacks have been undertaken for political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', [http://www.answers.com/topic/assassinations-presidential Assassinations, presidential] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081350/http://www.answers.com/topic/assassinations-presidential|date=March 4, 2016}}. Answers.com. Retrieved February 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Some attackers had questionable mental stability, and a few were judged legally insane.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Ben Dennison, [http://www.cracked.com/article_16705_the-6-most-utterly-insane-attempts-to-kill-us-president.html "The 6 Most Utterly Insane Attempts to Kill a US President"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160209084405/http://www.cracked.com/article_16705_the-6-most-utterly-insane-attempts-to-kill-us-president.html|date=February 9, 2016}}, ''Cracked'', October 21, 2008.

==Presidents assassinated==
===Abraham Lincoln===
[[File:Lincoln assassination slide c1900.png|thumb|alt=Image of Lincoln being shot by Booth while sitting in a theater booth.|Shown in the presidential booth of Ford's Theatre, from left to right, are assassin [[John Wilkes Booth]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Mary Todd Lincoln]], [[Clara Harris]], and [[Henry Rathbone]]]]
{{main|Assassination of Abraham Lincoln}}
The assassination of [[Abraham Lincoln|President Lincoln]] took place on [[Good Friday]], April 14, 1865, at [[Ford's Theatre]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], at approximately 10:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.. [[John Wilkes Booth]] was a well-known actor and a Confederate sympathizer from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army, he had contacts with the Confederate secret service.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 586–587.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864, Booth formulated a plan (very similar to one of Thomas N. Conrad previously authorized by the Confederacy)&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 587.&lt;/ref&gt; to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners. After attending an April 11, 1865, speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, an incensed Booth changed his plans and became determined to assassinate the president.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison (2000), pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Learning that the President would be attending [[Ford's Theatre]], Booth formulated a plan with co-conspirators to assassinate Lincoln at the theater, as well as [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]] at their homes. Lincoln attended the play ''[[Our American Cousin]]'' at Ford's Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 594–597.&lt;/ref&gt; As the President sat in his state box in the balcony, watching the play, with his wife, [[Mary Todd Lincoln]], and two guests, [[Major Henry Rathbone]] and his fiancée [[Clara Harris]], Booth entered from behind, aimed a .44 caliber Derringer pistol at the back of Lincoln's head, and fired, mortally wounding the President. Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth, but Booth stabbed him and escaped. The unconscious President was carried across the street from the theater to the [[Petersen House]], where he remained in a coma for nine hours before dying the following morning at 7:22&amp;nbsp;a.m. on April 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/alhtml/alrintr.html |title=Lincoln Papers: Lincoln Assassination: Introduction |publisher=Memory.loc.gov |accessdate=October 14, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005205326/http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/alhtml/alrintr.html |archivedate=October 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond Lincoln's death the plot failed: Seward was only wounded and Johnson's would-be attacker lost his nerve.

After being on the run for 12 days, Booth was tracked down and found on April 26, 1865 by Union soldiers on a farm in Virginia, some {{convert|70|mi|km}} south of Washington. After refusing to surrender to Union troops, Booth was shot and killed by Sergeant [[Boston Corbett]]. Several other conspirators were later hanged.

===James A. Garfield===
[[File:Garfield assassination engraving cropped.jpg|thumb|alt=A black-and-white drawing of a crowd of people, some of whom are angry, the two foremost of whom are bearded and wearing top hats|President Garfield with [[James G. Blaine]] after being shot by [[Charles J. Guiteau]]]]
{{main|Assassination of James A. Garfield}}
The assassination of [[James A. Garfield|President Garfield]] took place in [[Washington, D.C.]], at 9:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. on Saturday, July 2, 1881, less than four months after he took office. [[Charles J. Guiteau]] shot him twice, once in his right arm and once in his back, with a [[.442 Webley]] British Bulldog revolver, as the president was arriving at the [[Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station]]. Garfield died 11 weeks later, on September 19, 1881, at 10:35&amp;nbsp;p.m., of complications caused by infections.

Guiteau was immediately arrested. After a highly publicized trial lasting from November 14, 1881 to January 25, 1882, he was found guilty and sentenced to death. A subsequent appeal was rejected, and he was executed by [[hanging]] on June 30, 1882 in the District of Columbia, two days before the first anniversary of the attempt. Guiteau was assessed during his trial as mentally unbalanced and possibly suffered from some kind of [[bipolar disorder]] or from the effects of [[syphilis]] on the brain. He claimed to have shot Garfield out of disappointment for being passed over for appointment as [[United States Ambassador to France|Ambassador to France]]. He attributed the president's victory in the election to a speech he wrote in support of Garfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Peskin|first=Allan|title=Garfield|year=1978|publisher=Kent State University Press|isbn=0-87338-210-2|page=587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===William McKinley===

Clipping of a wash drawing by T. Dart Walker.]]
{{main|Assassination of William McKinley}}
The assassination of [[William McKinley|President McKinley]] took place at 4:07&amp;nbsp;p.m. on Friday, September 6, 1901, at the [[Temple of Music]] in [[Buffalo, New York]]. McKinley, attending the Pan-American Exposition, was shot twice in the abdomen at close range by [[Leon Czolgosz]], an [[anarchist]], who was armed with a .32 caliber revolver wrapped up in what seemed to be a bandage. The first bullet ricocheted off either a button or an award medal on McKinley's jacket and lodged in his sleeve but the second shot pierced his stomach. McKinley died seven days later, on September 14, 1901, at 2:15&amp;nbsp;a.m, after his condition rapidly declined.

Members of the crowd captured and subdued Czolgosz. Afterward, the 4th Brigade, National Guard Signal Corps, and police intervened, beating Czolgosz so severely it was initially thought he might not live to stand trial. On September 24, after a rushed, two-day trial in state court, Czolgosz was sentenced to death. He was executed by [[electric chair]] in [[Auburn Prison]] on October 29, 1901. Czolgosz's actions were politically motivated, although it remains unclear what outcome, if any, he believed the shooting would yield.

Following the assassination of President William McKinley, [[United States Congress|Congress]] directed the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] to protect the President of the United States as part of its mandate.

===John F. Kennedy===
[[File:John F. Kennedy motorcade, Dallas crop.png|thumb|JFK, Jackie, and the Connallys in the presidential limousine minutes before the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]]]]
{{main|Assassination of John F. Kennedy}}
The assassination of [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]] took place on Friday, November 22, 1963, in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], at 12:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Central Standard Time Zone|CST]] (18:30 [[UTC]]), while riding in a presidential motorcade in [[Dealey Plaza]].{{sfn|Stokes|1979|pp=21}} Kennedy was riding with his wife [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline]], [[Texas Governor]] [[John Connally]], Connally's wife, [[Nellie Connally|Nellie]], and two Secret Service agents, when he was fatally shot in the neck and head. He was the only assassinated president to die on the same day of his injuries. Governor Connally was seriously wounded in the attack. The motorcade rushed to [[Parkland Memorial Hospital]] where President Kennedy was pronounced dead about thirty minutes after the shooting; Connally recovered from his injuries.

Former U.S. Marine and [[Marxism|Marxist]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/lee-harvey-oswald-9430309|title=Lee Harvey Oswald|website=Biography.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] was arrested by members of the [[Dallas Police Department]] about 70 minutes after the initial shooting. Oswald was charged under Texas state law with the murder of Kennedy as well as that of a Dallas policeman, [[J. D. Tippit]], who had been fatally shot a short time after the assassination. At 11:21&amp;nbsp;a.m. Sunday, November 24, 1963, as live television cameras covered his transfer to the Dallas County Jail, Oswald was shot in the basement of Dallas Police Headquarters by [[Jack Ruby]], a Dallas nightclub operator. Oswald was taken to Parkland Memorial Hospital where he soon died. 
Ruby was found guilty of murder with malice and sentenced to death by the electric chair. In October 1966, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reversed the conviction on the grounds of improper admission of testimony and the fact that Ruby could not have received a fair trial in Dallas at the time due to excessive publicity. A new trial was scheduled to take place in Wichita Falls, Texas, in February 1967 but he became ill and was admitted to Parkland Hospital (the same place where Kennedy and Oswald had died). He was diagnosed with lung cancer. On January 3, 1967, he died at age 55 from a blood clot in his lung.

After a ten-month investigation, the [[Warren Commission]] concluded that Kennedy was assassinated by Oswald, that Oswald had acted entirely alone, and that Ruby had acted alone in killing Oswald. Nonetheless, polls conducted from 1966 to 2004 found that up to 80 percent of Americans have suspected that there was a plot or [[cover-up]].&lt;ref name="langer20031116"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/images/pdf/937a1JFKAssassination.pdf |author=Gary Langer |title=John F.

==Assassination attempts and plots==
===Andrew Jackson===

*January 30, 1835: Just outside the [[United States Capitol|Capitol Building]], a house painter named [[Richard Lawrence (failed assassin)|Richard Lawrence]] attempted to shoot Jackson with two pistols, both of which misfired. Lawrence was apprehended after Jackson beat him severely with his cane. Lawrence was found [[not guilty by reason of insanity]] and confined to a mental institution until his death in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/people/articles/web/20070130-richard-lawrence-andrew-jackson-assassination-warren-r-davis.shtml |title=Trying to Assassinate President Jackson |publisher=[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]] |date=January 30, 2007 |accessdate=May 6, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024234731/http://www.americanheritage.com/people/articles/web/20070130-richard-lawrence-andrew-jackson-assassination-warren-r-davis.shtml |archivedate=October 24, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abraham Lincoln===
*February 23, 1861: The [[Baltimore Plot]] was an alleged conspiracy to assassinate [[President-elect]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] en route to his [[inauguration]]. [[Allan Pinkerton]]'s [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|National Detective Agency]] played a key role in protecting the president-elect by managing Lincoln's security throughout the journey. Although scholars debate whether the threat was real, Lincoln and his advisers took actions to ensure his safe passage through Baltimore.
*August 1864: A lone rifle shot fired by an unknown sniper missed Lincoln's head by inches (passing through his hat) as he rode in the late evening, unguarded, north from the White House three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) to the [[President Lincoln's Cottage at the Soldiers' Home|Soldiers' Home]] (his regular retreat where he would work and sleep before returning to the White House the following morning). Near 11:00 pm, Private John W. Nichols of the Pennsylvania 150th Volunteers, the sentry on duty at the gated entrance to the Soldiers' Home grounds, heard the rifle shot and moments later saw the president riding toward him "bareheaded". Lincoln described the matter to [[Ward Hill Lamon|Ward Lamon]], his old friend and loyal bodyguard.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Charles Bracelen (2010). ''1864: Lincoln at the Gates of History'', pp 266-267.

While campaigning in [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], [[John Flammang Schrank]], a saloon-keeper from New York who had been stalking him for weeks, shot Roosevelt once in the chest with a [[.38 Special|.38-caliber]] [[Colt Police Positive Special]] revolver. The 50-page text of his campaign speech titled "[[wikisource:Progressive Cause Greater Than Any Individual|Progressive Cause Greater Than Any Individual]]", folded over twice in Roosevelt's breast pocket and a metal glasses case slowed the bullet, saving his life.

* Summer 1947: During the pending of the independence of [[Israel]], the Zionist [[Stern Gang]] was believed to have sent a number of letter bombs addressed to the president and high-ranking staff at the White House. The Secret Service had been alerted by British intelligence after similar letters had been sent to high-ranking British officials and the Gang claimed credit.The mail room of the White House intercepted the letters and the Secret Service defused them. At the time, the incident was not publicized. Truman's daughter Margaret confirmed the incident in her biography of Truman published in 1972. It had earlier been told in a memoir by Ira R.T. Smith, who worked in the mail room.&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130111013038/http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1951&amp;dat=19721201&amp;id=s00xAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AeIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2264,343939 AP, "Jews Sent Truman Letter Bombs, Book Tells"], ''Tri-City Herald'', December 1, 1972, accessed December 11, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deaths rumored to be assassinations==
===Zachary Taylor===
On July 4, 1850, President [[Zachary Taylor]] fell ill and was diagnosed by his physicians with ''cholera morbus'', a term that included [[diarrhea]] and [[dysentery]] but not true [[cholera]]. Cholera, [[typhoid fever]] and [[food poisoning]] have all been indicated as the source of the president's ultimately fatal gastroenteritis.

In the late 1980s, author Clara Rising theorized that Taylor was murdered by poison; she was able to convince Taylor's closest living relative, as well as the [[coroner]] of [[Jefferson County, Kentucky]], Dr. Richard Greathouse, to order an exhumation. On June 17, 1991, Taylor's remains were exhumed from the vault at the [[Zachary Taylor National Cemetery]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. Radiological studies were conducted of the remains before small samples of hair, fingernail, and other tissues were removed. The remains were then retinterred. The samples were sent to [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], where [[neutron activation analysis]] revealed traces of [[arsenic]], but at levels less than one percent of the level expected in a death by poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;Author unknown (date unknown).

===Warren G. Harding===
In June 1923, President [[Warren G. Harding]] set out on a cross-country "Voyage of Understanding", planning to meet with citizens and explain his policies. During this trip, he became the first president to visit [[Alaska]], which was then a U.S. [[Territory of Alaska|territory]].&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, W. Paul (1995-07). President Harding's 1923 Visit to Utah. History Blazer, July 1995. Retrieved from {{cite web|url=http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/from_war_to_war/presidenthardings1923visittoutah.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502040538/http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/from_war_to_war/presidenthardings1923visittoutah.html |archivedate=May 2, 2015 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rumors of [[political corruption|corruption]] in the Harding administration were beginning to circulate in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] by 1923, and Harding was profoundly shocked by a long message he received while in Alaska, apparently detailing illegal activities by his own cabinet that were allegedly unknown to him. At the end of July, while traveling south from Alaska through [[British Columbia]], he developed what was thought to be a severe case of [[food poisoning]]. He gave the final speech of his life to a large crowd at the University of Washington Stadium (now [[Husky Stadium]]) at the [[University of Washington]] campus in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. A scheduled speech in [[Portland, Oregon]], was canceled. The President's train proceeded south to [[San Francisco]]. Upon arriving at the [[Palace Hotel, San Francisco|Palace Hotel]], he developed [[pneumonia]]. Harding died in his hotel room of either a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] or a [[stroke]] at 7:35&amp;nbsp;p.m. (19:35) on August 2, 1923. The formal announcement, printed in ''[[The New York Times]]'' of that day, stated: "A [[stroke]] of [[apoplexy]] was the cause of death." He had been ill exactly one week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Harding a Farm Boy Who Rose by Work |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1102.html |quote=Nominated for the Presidency as a compromise candidate and elected by a tremendous majority because of a reaction against the policies of his predecessor, Warren Gamaliel Harding, twenty-ninth President of the United States, owed his political elevation largely to his engaging personal traits, his ability to work in harmony with the leaders of his party, and the fact that he typified in himself the average prosperous American citizen. |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=July 21, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015045948/http://nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1102.html |archivedate=October 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States Navy|Naval]] physicians surmised that Harding had suffered a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. The Hardings' personal medical advisor, homeopath and [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] [[Charles E. Sawyer]], disagreed with the diagnosis. His wife, [[Florence Harding]], refused permission for an [[autopsy]], which soon led to speculation that the President had been the victim of a plot, possibly carried out by his wife, as Harding apparently had been unfaithful to the First Lady. [[Gaston Means|Gaston B. Means]], an amateur historian and [[Gadfly (social)|gadfly]], noted in his book ''The Strange Death of President Harding'' (1930) that the circumstances surrounding his death led to suspicions that he had been poisoned. A number of individuals attached to him, both personally and politically, would have welcomed Harding's death, as they would have been disgraced in association by Means' assertion of Harding's "imminent impeachment".

'''Mario Puccini''' (28 June 1869, [[Livorno]] - 18 June 1920, [[Florence]]) was an Italian [[Post-impressionist]] painter who specialized in landscapes and village scenes. He was sometimes referred to as "The Italian Van Gogh".&lt;ref name="M"&gt;[http://www.magentaflorence.com/tuscanys-other-puccini-the-artist/ "Tuscany's Other Puccini"] @ Magenta (Florence).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
His father was a baker. He  worked in his father's bakery and sketched as a hobby until his talent was noticed by [[Giovanni Fattori]], who encouraged him to enroll at the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze|Academy of Fine Arts of Florence]], which he did, against parental objections, in 1884 when he was only fifteen.&lt;ref name="G"&gt;[http://galleriaathena.com/athena/artisti-opere/artisti/mario_puccini.php Brief biography] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20151022102155/http://galleriaathena.com/athena/artisti-opere/artisti/mario_puccini.php |date=2015-10-22 }} @ the Galleria Athena.&lt;/ref&gt; While there, he studied with Fattori and was influenced by the works of  [[Silvestro Lega]].
[[File:Puccini-Metalworks.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Metalworks ("La Metallurgica")]]
After graduating, he returned to Livorno and continued his studies at the "Scuola Libera del Nudo". In 1893, his family had him committed to a psychiatric hospital in [[Siena]], citing depression and persecution mania as the justification.&lt;ref name="G" /&gt; This condition may have been brought about by the infidelity of a woman he loved,&lt;ref name="M" /&gt; or perhaps his family simply found him too temperamental to handle, but the experience produced a major change in his artistic style. He abandoned the realistic style of the [[Macchiaioli]] in favor of broad strokes and brighter colors; developing his own version of [[Divisionism]].&lt;ref name="M" /&gt; This combination of style and mental illness earned him his nickname: "The Van Gogh of Livorno" (later, "Italy").

Financially unsuccessful and impoverished, he worked as a waiter, created designs for embroiderers and milliners, made signs and sold the occasional painting.&lt;ref name="G" /&gt; In 1911, he went to France for a year, living near his brother in [[Digne-les-Bains]].&lt;ref name="M" /&gt; While there, he painted maritime subjects and undertook to study the works of [[Paul Cézanne]]. When he returned to Livorno, he became an habitué of the [[Caffè Bardi]] (modeled after the [[Caffè Michelangiolo]] in Florence) which, since 1908, had served as a meeting place for the city's young artists; mostly from the generation after Puccini's.&lt;ref name="G" /&gt; He began to exhibit and, by 1914, could earn his living entirely from his paintings.
[[File:Puccini-Pasture.jpg|thumb|300px|Pasture in Maremma]]
At the age of fifty, after a brief hospitalization, he died from a neglected lung infection, aggravated by the long hours he spent outdoors, painting in [[Maremma]].&lt;ref name="G" /&gt; His unexpected death, just as he was beginning to be appreciated, caused great sorrow among his friends at the [[Caffè Bardi]]. A month later, fifteen of them met at the studios of [[Gino Romiti]] and established the "{{ill|Gruppo Labronico|it}}" (Leghorn Group) to honor his achievements, promote the artists of Livorno, and have Puccini's body interred in the memorial chapel near the [[Sanctuary of Montenero]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gruppolabronico.it/la-fondazione/ "La Fondazione"] @ the Gruppo Labronico website.&lt;/ref&gt; This process was stalled, for bureaucratic reasons, but the group persisted and his remains were finally placed there in 1988.

In 1949, a street in [[Quercianella]] was named after him.

'''Samuel James Ryce''' (September 26, 1985 &amp;ndash; September 11, 1995) was a child who was abducted, raped and killed by Juan Carlos Chavez in [[Redland, Florida]], United States. On Wednesday, February 12, 2014, Chavez was executed at [[Florida State Prison]] in North Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/article1960281.html|title=Juan Carlos Chavez executed for murder of Jimmy Ryce|work=miamiherald|access-date=2017-09-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ryce's murder ==
'''Juan Carlos Chavez''' (March 16, 1967 – February 12, 2014) was convicted of, and ultimately confessed to, Ryce's murder.  On September&amp;nbsp;11, 1995, fifteen days before his 10th birthday, nine-year-old Ryce was riding the bus from school. He was dropped off, along with ten classmates, and had to walk less than a block to his home.  According to his confession, Chavez blocked Ryce's path with his pickup truck and forced him at gunpoint into the truck. Chavez took Ryce to his trailer where he raped him. About four hours later, when he heard a helicopter hovering above, Ryce ran to the door and tried to open it only to be shot in the back by Chavez, who held the child until he took his last breath. Then, Chavez [[Decapitation|decapitated]] and dismembered him.

The child's decapitated and [[Dismemberment|dismembered]] body was found three months later near Chavez's trailer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/man-who-raped-killed-florida-boy-jimmy-ryce-in-1995-to-be-executed/|title=Man executed for 1995 rape, murder of Fla. boy|access-date=2017-09-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Capturing Juan Carlos Chavez ==

[[File:Juan Carlos Chavez(muderer).jpg|thumb|right|150px|Juan Carlos Chavez was convicted of capital sexual battery, kidnapping, and first degree murder.]]
Chavez worked for the Scheinhaus family. He lived in a trailer on their property. Around the time of Ryce's disappearance, Scheinhaus reported several items missing from her home including a handgun and jewelry. Scheinhaus suspected Chavez, after consulting with a psychic, but had no evidence to support her suspicions. Aided by a locksmith, Scheinhaus entered Chavez's trailer. She found her handgun and young Ryce's bookbag. She reported her findings to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] on December&amp;nbsp;5, 1995. Chavez was found a day later and taken in for questioning.

Being advised of his rights and after a 55-hour-long interrogation, Chavez openly admitted to abducting, raping and murdering Ryce. Chavez also led police to the boy's body, which was dismembered and hidden in cement in three plastic planters.

=== The murder case ===

In the fall of 1998, Juan Carlos Chavez was convicted of kidnapping, sexual battery, and capital murder. He was sentenced to death. The [[Florida Supreme Court]] affirmed his conviction and sentence on November 21, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/16419103.htm|title=MiamiHerald.com {{!}} 01/09/2007 {{!}} Convicted killer of Jimmy Ryce back in court|date=2007-01-14|access-date=2017-09-09|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070114022450/http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/16419103.htm|archivedate=2007-01-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2004, Chavez filed a motion for post-conviction relief, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion was amended in May 2005, and was heard in Miami-Dade Circuit Court on January 9, 2007. The circuit court judge denied the motion on March 8, 2007. On May 23, 2007, Chavez appealed the denial to the Florida Supreme Court, filing a petition for habeas corpus at the same time. The court affirmed the circuit court's order and denied the petition on June 25, 2009. The United States Supreme Court denied certiorari. On April 17, 2012, Chavez filed a successor motion for post-conviction relief under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850. The circuit court denied the motion on June 13, 2012. On July 20, 2012, Chavez appealed the denial to the Florida Supreme Court, which affirmed the denial on October 11, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jweb.flcourts.org/pls/docket/ds_docket?p_caseyear=2012&amp;p_casenumber=1470&amp;psCourt=FSC|title=Florida Supreme Court Case Docket|website=jweb.flcourts.org|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 2, 2014, [[Florida Governor]] [[Rick Scott]] signed Chavez' death warrant. Chavez, age 46, was executed by lethal injection on February 12, 2014, at 8:17 p.m. at the Florida State Prison in Starke, just over a month before his 47th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=David|last=Ovalle|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/article1958931.html|title=Jimmy Ryce killer to be executed Feb. 12, governor’s office says|work=[[Miami Herald]]|publisher=[[The McClatchy Company]]|date=January 2, 2014|access-date=September 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Jimmy Ryce Act ==

The Jimmy Ryce Act (Jimmy Ryce Involuntary Civil Commitment for Sexually Violent Predators' Treatment And Care Act) was passed unanimously by the Florida legislature and was signed by [[Governor]] [[Lawton Chiles]] on May&amp;nbsp;19, 1998, becoming effective on January&amp;nbsp;1, 1999.  The act calls for inmates with sex offense histories to be reviewed by the [[Florida Department of Corrections]], the [[Florida Department of Children and Families]] (DCF), and state attorneys to determine the level of risk for re-offense. Upon release from incarceration, these inmates may be subject to civil proceedings and commitment to a secure facility for treatment. That treatment center, located in Arcadia, was criticized because treatment is lacking (less than 5 hours per week), it lacks security (several incidents of murder on site, riots requiring hundreds of officers to quell) there is no method of restoring civil liberties (the program has no release stage) being underfunded, understaffed and located in an old condemned correctional facility.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} After running the center for 7 years, Liberty Healthcare was released by the state as the vendor, and GEO corp was retained. Unfortunately many of the issues regarding step-down programs, community placement or aftercare remain unresolved after nearly ten years.

In 2004, residents of the Florida Civil Commitment Center (FCCC) in the custody of the Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) filed a civil rights suit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in U.S. District Court Middle District of Florida, challenging the lack of sex offender and mental health treatment provided at FCCC in Arcadia, Florida. Plaintiffs were all involuntarily civilly confined at FCCC pursuant to the Sexually Violent Predator Act §§ 394.910, et seq. Fla. Stat. (2003). Plaintiffs alleged violations of their constitutional rights and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by the denial of effective sex offender treatment programs, lack of appropriate mental health care and the failure to accommodate inmates with disabilities. Plaintiffs requested certification as a class action and sought declaratory and injunctive relief.  Defendants named in the Complaint were the DCF and the private corporation Liberty Behavioral Healthcare Corp. that operated the FCCC pursuant to a contract with the DCF.  The court certified the case as a class action.  After Liberty was replaced as the private contractor, it was dismissed from the lawsuit which proceeded against DCF. Over the next several years, the plaintiffs and defendants engaged in intensive discovery and pre-trial litigation.  DCF and the new contractor, GEO Group, implemented significant changes in the sex offender and psychiatric treatment provided to residents. In the Fall of 2009, plaintiffs and defendants, through their respective attorneys, filed a joint motion to dismiss the suit in favor of a settlement agreement. Federal Court Justice Steele accepted the joint submission and dismissed the class action suit, with prejudice, in November 2009, the same year that Jimmy's mother died.

== Jimmy Ryce Center for Victims of Predatory Abduction and Team Hope ==

The family of Ryce created the Jimmy Ryce Center for Victims of Predatory Abduction to offer assistance to law enforcement, including providing free bloodhounds for use in search and rescue. Ryce's mother, [[Claudine Dianne Ryce]], was also a founder of Team Hope, a group of parents of abducted children who support parents and families facing child abduction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcsw.net/halloffame/WHOFbios/Ryce.htm Claudine Dianne Ryce] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019024628/http://www.fcsw.net/halloffame/WHOFbios/Ryce.htm |date=2010-10-19 }}, Biography from the Florida Commission on the Status of Women&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''O'er the Gloomy Hills of Darkness'''", also titled "'''O'er Those Gloomy Hills of Darkness'''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =John| last =Kirk| title =Cultures of Radicalism in Britain and Ireland | publisher = Routledge| year = 2013| isbn =1848933444|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Welsh Christian hymn by [[William Williams Pantycelyn]] written in 1772.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =Saunders| last =Lewis| title =Williams Pantycelyn | publisher = Gwasg Prifysgol Cymru| year = 1991 | isbn =0708311229 |page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hymn was written as a missionary hymn; there are conflicting accounts of why the hymn was written. The hymn was later published in 374 hymnals worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hymnary.org/text/oer_the_gloomy_hills_of_darkness |title=O'er the gloomy hills of darkness |publisher=Hymnary.org |date= |accessdate=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it was censored and altered in the United States by slaveholders for evangelising to slaves. The hymn later fell out of favour with hymn book editors in the 1960s.

== History ==
There are conflicting accounts of why the hymn was written. According to one account, [[George Bowen (missionary)|George Bowen]] was converted to Christianity through hearing a Welsh girl singing hymns. He later went to stay at Llwyn-Gwair Manor at the same time that the [[Welsh Methodist Association]] were there. While there, he met Williams and asked him to compose some verse about the [[Preseli Hills]]. "O'er the Gloomy Hills of Darkness" was written as a result of these requests.&lt;Ref name=kirk /&gt; Though it is possible that this story may be correct as Llwyn-Gwair Manor and Williams' bedroom at the manor did overlook [[Carn Igli]], in the 19th century an alternative story arose. In this version, Williams was travelling to [[Pontrhydyfen]] and composing a new missionary hymn as part of a commission from [[Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon]]. Upon passing the ruins of an old [[Cistercian]] abbey and seeing the mountains he would have to cross on a stormy night, the view inspired him to write "O'er the Gloomy Hills of Darkness" for the Countess.&lt;ref name=kirk&gt;Kirk, 100&lt;/ref&gt; The hymn was first written in Welsh as English was not Williams' first language so it was later translated into English by another person. This was because Williams did not know enough English to fully express the intent of the original Welsh verses in translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 =John | last1 =Mason | first2 =Thomas | last2 =Shepherd | title = Spiritual Songs, or Songs of Praise to Almighty God: upon several occasions | publisher = D. Sedgwick | edition =   | year = 1859 | page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1836, "O'er the Gloomy hills of Darkness" was reviewed in an issue of ''[[The Eclectic Review]]''. In a remarkably snide review, the hymn, among many others, is criticised for a lack of grammatical correctness as well as a lack of rhyme in the first verse, " ...inane verbiage preferred by worthy people to the noblest compositions of sanctified genius; and to blot it out from our hymn-books would be a species of sacrilege".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Allen|first= William|date= October 1836|title= Psalms and Hymns for Public Worship|journal= The Eclectic Review |volume= 16|issue= |pages=288 |doi= }} &lt;/ref&gt;  This was attributed to Williams' lack of English as a native language gave rise to "a stiffness apparent" in the hymn.&lt;ref name=oliv&gt;{{cite book | first =Thomas | last =Olivers |authorlink=Thomas Olivers | title = Hymns, and an Elegy on the death of John Wesley; reprinted from the originals. With a biographical sketch of the author by J. Kirk. | publisher = D. Sedgwick; Hamilton, Adams, and Co.  | edition = reprint | year = 1868  |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The [[New York Times]] stated it had gained popularity because of Williams' "ease and sweetness" in his hymn writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1853/11/26/archives/religious-history-chronicles-of-religious-seets-in-the-united.html|title=No. II.-Welsh Calvanistic Methodists.|date=1853-11-26|publisher=New York Times |accessdate=2016-06-08|subscription=yes|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
The second verse of the hymn begins with the lines "Let the Indian, let the negro, Let the rude barbarian see". Williams included this after hearing stories of promising missionary contact with [[Cherokee]] tribes and with slaves in the [[Province of Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, 108&lt;/ref&gt; When the hymn became established in the United States, slave owners changed the line referencing "Indian" and "negro" to "Let the dark benighted pagan". The abolitionist Ebenezer Davies claimed “The altered reading, I learned, prevails universally in America, except in the original version used by the Welsh congregations. Slave-holders, and the abettors of that horrid system which makes it a crime to teach a negro to read the Word of God, felt perhaps that they could not devoutly and consistently sing "Let the Indian, let the negro ... see”.&lt;ref name=davis&gt;{{cite book | first =Ebenezer | last =Davies  | title =American Scenes and Christian Slavery: A Recent Tour of Four Thousand Miles in the United States | publisher = J.

In the 1850s, the [[Baptists Together|Baptist Union of Great Britain]] dropped the hymn from usage. The reason published in the ''[[Baptist Magazine]]'' stated "But the verses are too rude and unfinished to be generally accepted in modern day".&lt;ref name=oliv /&gt; In later years in the 19th century churches, including the [[Church of England]], started to publish the hymn replacing the second verse with the American slave owner's amended version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hymnary.org/hymn/CH1886/260 |title=Church Hymnal 260. O'er the gloomy hills of darkness |publisher=Hymnary.org |date= |accessdate=2016-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1900s, the second verse would often be omitted altogether from hymnals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hymnary.org/hymn/MHTB1917/page/314 |title=Methodist Hymn and Tune Book: official hymn book of the Methodist Church page 314 |publisher=Hymnary.org |date= |accessdate=2016-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was because its members in modern times felt that the hymn connected [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and black people with barbarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |first=Douglas |last=Campbell |title=Changes in LDS hymns: Implications and Opportunities |url=https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V28N03_79.pdf |publisher=[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought|Dialogue]] |accessdate=2016-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hymn's lyrical style set the tone for future missionary hymns. "O'er the Gloomy Hills of Darkness" inspired the founder of [[Methodism]], [[Charles Wesley]], to write "Sun of Unclouded Righteousness" for missionaries working with "Mahometans".&lt;ref name=imp /&gt;

'''Paul O. Williams''' (January 17, 1935 – June 2, 2009) was an American [[science fiction]] writer and [[haiku]] poet. Williams was professor emeritus of English at [[Principia College]] in [[Elsah, Illinois]].

His most notable science fiction works are a series of novels, the Pelbar Cycle, set in [[North America]] about a thousand years after a "time of fire", in which the world was nearly totally depopulated. The novels track a gradual reconnection of the human cultures which developed. Much of the action takes place in the communities of the Pelbar, along the [[Upper Mississippi River]] — in the general vicinity of Elsah. Several cultures, including the matriarchal Pelbar, join together in the Heart River Federation.  Others, especially the tyrannical Tantal and slave-raiding Tusco, fall apart after suffering defeats.  The predominant characters are change agents: Tor, Jestak, Stel and his wife Ahroe Westrun.  All are Pelbar except for Tor who is Shumai.  Williams won the [[John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer|John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer in Science Fiction]] in 1983.&lt;ref name="nyt830906"/&gt;

He is also known as a writer of [[haiku]], [[senryū]], and [[Tanka in English|tanka]], and wrote a number of essays on the haiku form in English. In a 1975 essay, he coined the term "Tontoism" to refer to the practice of writing haiku with missing [[Article (grammar)|articles]] ("the", "a", or "an"), which he claimed made the haiku sound like the stunted English of the Indian sidekick, [[Tonto (Lone Ranger character)|Tonto]], in the ''[[Lone Ranger]]'' radio and television series. In 2001, his best essays were collected in ''The Nick of Time: Essays on Haiku Aesthetics'', edited by Lee Gurga and Michael Dylan Welch. Williams was the president of the [[Haiku Society of America]] (1999) and vice president of the Tanka Society of America (2000). In 1989 he won the Museum of Haiku Literature Award&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsa-haiku.org/museumhaikuliteratureawards/museumhaikuliterature-award.htm#1989|title=Museum of Haiku Literature Award}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the Haiku Society of America with this poem written for Nick Virgilio shortly after Nick's death:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
gone from the woods
    the bird I knew
        by song alone
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Williams died from an [[aortic dissection]] on June 2, 2009.&lt;ref name="sfwa09"/&gt;

A '''pinch''' is a grip of a flexible object in which a portion is taken between two [[finger]]s, until it hurts, or something of resemblance and squeezed so the gripped portion of the object is lifted from its normal level. By extension, that which is taken in the grip is referred to as a "pinch."

When the fingers are used to perform a pinch, the action usually consists of the [[thumb]] and one other finger. The closer to the thumb the other finger is located, the stronger the pinch.

==Pinch of the skin==
The term "pinch" often refers to the action being taken on the [[skin]]. A pinch of the skin displaces the skin and [[blood]] beneath from its natural position, and may inflict a minor degree of pain, which may increase if the amount of skin being pinched is smaller, but is usually tolerable to most.

Pinching the skin can result in [[pinch mark]]s, a [[List of cutaneous conditions|cutaneous condition]], and when on the ears or in the genital region of male children may be suggestive of child abuse.&lt;ref name="Bolognia"&gt;{{cite book |author=Rapini, Ronald P. |author2=Bolognia, Jean L. |author3=Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical uses===
[[File:Penile nerve block dorsal.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The skin is being pinched while an injection is being given]]
Pinching has the following uses in health care and medicine:
*The skin is often pinched prior to giving an [[injection (medicine)|injection]] in order to get the needle in the desired location.
*In [[neurology]], pinching can be used to determine pain sensitivity for a certain area of skin. 
*Can be used to determine [[Resilience (materials science)|resiliency]] in the skin of an [[old age|aged person]]. When the skin is pinched, the amount of time the pinch remains visible following the pinch is an indicator.&lt;ref&gt;Physical dimensions of aging By Waneen Wyrick Spirduso, Karen L. Francis, Priscilla G. MacRae: Page 83&lt;/ref&gt; 
*When skin has been [[sunburn|damaged by the sun]], pinching can be used to determine the amount of damage. Examining the appearance with varying amounts of time following the pinch can be used to determine the amount of damage.&lt;ref&gt;Photodamaged skin: clinical signs, causes and management By Jean-Paul Ortonne, Ronald Marks: Page 19&lt;/ref&gt; 
*In determining [[dehydration]], pinching the skin can serve as a test. The speed at which the pinch turns back can help determine the level of dehydration. The slower it goes back, the more severe the dehydration.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook IMCI: integrated management of childhood illness By World Health Organization. Dept. of Child and Adolescent Health and Development: Page 27&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Body fat percentage]] can be determined the [[skinfold test]], in which a pinch of skin is precisely measured by calipers at several standardized points on the body to determine the subcutaneous fat layer thickness. These measurements are converted to an estimated body fat percentage by an equation.
*Pinching is used as part of the diagnosis of [[schleroderma]]. In schleroderma patients, the skin between the fingers becomes too difficult to pinch.&lt;ref&gt;Atlas of the musculoskeletal examination By Gerald F. Moore, Gerald Moore: Page 46&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pinch of powder==
A pinch can refer to the taking of a small amount of a [[powder (substance)|powdery substance]].

In cooking, a "[[Pinch (cooking)|pinch]]" refers to a small amount of an ingredient, such as [[table salt|salt]] or a [[spice]], being taken to be placed within a recipe.

Small amounts of [[street drug]]s are sometimes referred to as a "pinch."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1357">A '''plant geneticist''' is a [[scientist]] involved with the study of [[genetics]] in [[botany]]. Typical work is done with [[gene]]s in order to isolate and then develop certain plant [[Trait (biology)|trait]]s. Once a certain trait, such as plant height, fruit sweetness, or tolerance to cold, is found, a plant geneticist works to improve breeding methods to ensure that future plant generations possess the desired traits.

Plant genetics played a key role in the modern-day theories of [[heredity]], beginning with [[Gregor Mendel]]'s study of pea plants in the 19th century. The occupation has since grown to encompass advancements in [[biotechnology]] that have led to greater understanding of [[plant breeding]] and [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]]. Commercially, plant geneticists are sometimes employed to develop methods of making produce more nutritious, or altering plant pigments to make the food more enticing to consumers.

The term "'''present age'''" is a concept in the [[philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard]]. A formulation of the [[modern age]] can be found in [[Kierkegaard]]'s work ''[[Two Ages: A Literary Review]]'':

{{quote|Our age is essentially one of understanding and reflection, without passion, momentarily bursting into enthusiasm, and shrewdly relapsing into repose. ... There is no more action or decision in our day than there is perilous delight in swimming in shallow waters.|sign=Kierkegaard, Søren|source=''Two Ages: A Literary Review''.&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. [https://books.google.com/books?id=CNolAQAAMAAJ&amp;q= ''The Present Age and of the Difference Between a Genius and an Apostle''], trans. Alexander Dru (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1940), p. 33 and 36; translation modified by  [http://www.historyguide.org/europe/present_age.html historyguide.org/]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Overview==
Kierkegaard argues the present age drains the meaning out of [[ethical]] concepts through passionless indolence. The concepts are still used, but are drained of all meaning by virtue of their detachment from a life view which is passion-generated and produces consistent action.&lt;ref&gt;Lillegard, Norman. ''Thinking with Kierkegaard and MacIntyre about Virtue'', in: ''Kierkegaard after MacIntyre''.{{page needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kierkegaard published this book in 1846 just after the [[Corsair Affair]] in which he was attacked by the press. He attacks not only the Press but the Public it serves in this book. He is against abstract moments in time or public opinion as a basis for forming relationships. He wrote about the single individual in his ''[[Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses]]'' and kept to that category here.

Newspapers were mediating information and individuals were joining together based on this mediating influence. The same thing is happening now with the internet. Kierkegaard advised that "real" people retain a concrete identity in the face of an abstract [[public opinion]]. He wrote: {{Quotation|More and more people renounce the quiet and modest tasks of life, that are so important and pleasing to God, in order to achieve something greater; in order to think over the relationships of life in a higher relationship till in the end the whole generation has become a representation, who represent…it is difficult to say who; and who think about these relationships…for whose sake it is not easy to discover.  
The real moment in time and the real situation being simultaneous with real people, each of whom is something; that is what helps to sustain the individual. But the existence of a public produces neither a situation nor simultaneity. The individual reader of the Press is not the public, and even though little by little a number of individuals or even all of them should read it, the simultaneity is lacking. Years might be spent gathering the public together, and still it would not be there. This abstraction, which the individuals so illogically form, quite rightly repulses the individual instead of coming to his help. The man who has no opinion of an event at the actual moment accepts the opinion of the majority, or, if he is quarrelsome, of the minority. But it must be remembered that both majority and minority are real people, and that is why the individual is assisted by adhering to them. A public, on the contrary, is an abstraction. Soren Kierkegaard, ''The Present Age'', (1846) Dru translation 1962 p. 44, 61}}

==Interpretations==
''The Present Age'' and ''[[Two Minor Ethical-Religious Essays|Two Minor Ethico-Religious Treatises]]'' were originally translated by [[Walter Lowrie (author)|Walter Lowrie]] and Alexander Dru in 1940. Later, in 1962, Alexander Dru's translation of ''The Present Age'' was published along with ''Of The Difference Between a Genius and an Apostle''.&lt;ref&gt;The second essay of the above mentioned two minor essays, the first essay was ''Has a Man the Right to Let Himself Be Put to Death for the Truth?''&lt;/ref&gt; This translation had a long introduction by [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]].

Several contemporary philosophers, including [[Anthony Rudd (philosopher)|Anthony Rudd]], [[John Davenport (philosopher)|John Davenport]], and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]]&lt;ref&gt;Davenport, John; Rudd, Anthony; and MacIntyre, Alasdair. ''Kierkegaard after MacIntyre: essays on freedom, narrative, and virtue'', 2001, pp. 226–229.&lt;/ref&gt; allocate this concept and apply it as an analysis of [[nihilism]]. [[Hubert Dreyfus]], for example in his essay "Anonymity vrs. Commitment in the Present Age", argues that Kierkegaard, "who was always concerned with nihilism, warns that his age is characterized by a disinterested reflection and curiosity that levels all differences of status and value."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~hdreyfus/html/paper_kierkegaard.html |title=Kierkegaard on the Internet: Anonymity vrs. Commitment in the Present Age |author=Hubert L. Dreyfus |date=2004 |work= |publisher=Regents of the University of California |accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other thinkers apply the concept as a symptom of [[herd behavior]] or [[mob mentality]]. Norman Lillegard argues that the present age is "incapable of anything but 'crowd actions' which are not true actions at all."&lt;ref&gt;Lillegard, Norman. ''Thinking with Kierkegaard and MacIntyre about Virtue'', in: ''Kierkegaard after MacIntyre''.{{page needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''psychological punishment''' is a type of [[punishment]] that relies not or only in secondary order on the actual harm inflicted (such as [[corporal punishment]]s or fines) but on psychological effects, mainly emotions, such as fear, shame and guilt. This can occasionally cause severe cardiac harm, even death, but those are not strictly intended, and in the case of torture accidental death would even defeat the purpose.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Psychological punishments that are particularly cruel or severe may be considered [[psychological torture]].

Very common is the use of shame through private or, especially, [[public humiliation]].

For example, publicly shaving a woman’s head may not only humiliate her in front of those who witness her shearing, it may also deprive her of her hair for as long as it takes to grow back, thus serving as a continual reminder of her punishment and her humiliation.

==Development==
It is an offspring of the [[RepRap]],{{fact|date=October 2014}} the open-source self-replicating 3D printer project, and derringer, the Reprringer is a 5-shot, single-action, manually-indexed 6mm Flobert [[pistol]] developed by Hexen.&lt;ref name="D-printed Reprringer Pepperbox 2013"/&gt;

==Design==
Unlike the many early 3D-printed firearm designs, which are usually massively overbuilt in order to withstand the pressures and strain on the material from modern gunpowder cartridges, the Reprringer is small and only slightly larger than a gun made from steel.&lt;ref name="D-printed Reprringer Pepperbox 2013"/&gt; Two factors contribute to its small stature. First reason is that it is chambered for what is considered the least powerful commercially-produced cartridge on the market.&lt;ref name="D-printed Reprringer Pepperbox 2013"/&gt;

According to Guns.com the ".22 CB aka 6mm Flobert is made from a cut-down .22 rimfire case loaded with just a primer or the primer and very little powder and a lightweight bullet". This makes the cartridge roughly on par with some [[air rifle]]s in terms of muzzle energy. This therefore means that the Reprringer does not require as much barrel. The design is improved over early completely 3D-printed guns as it uses unrifled steel inserts in the cylinder. This makes the gun safer and more reliable, it also provides a more consistent seal around the projectile; the all-polymer barrels have the ability to flex, thus letting much of the propellant escape, and are inefficient.&lt;ref name="D-printed Reprringer Pepperbox 2013"/&gt;

Although the barrels are not rifled, the lack of theoretical accuracy therefrom is considered a relative non-issue in a small gun with no sights.&lt;ref name="D-printed Reprringer Pepperbox 2013"/&gt;

'''Richard "Dicky" J. Bolles''' was one of [[Florida]]'s many early land [[salesmen]]. He was also one of the first to market the land in small tracts to would be future residents. Born on August 1, 1843, in 1908 Bolles purchased {{convert|500000|acre|km2}} of undeveloped land from the state of Florida at the price of two dollars an [[acre]]. He went on to sell this land, sight unseen to unknowing non-residents. His salesmanship was ultimately a scam and in 1911 those who were caught up in it brought [[lawsuit|suit]] against him. Later in 1913 he was indicted and arrested, though later found innocent. Bolles died in 1917.

'''Ian Robert Maxwell''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|MC}} (10 June 1923 – 5 November 1991), born '''Ján Ludvík Hyman Binyamin Hoch''', was a British [[media proprietor]] and [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]] (MP).

After his death, huge discrepancies in his companies' finances were revealed, including his [[fraud]]ulent misappropriation of the [[Mirror Group]] [[pension fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Notorious Fraud – the Robert Maxwell Farrago|url=http://australian-guardians.org/?page_id=808|publisher=Australian Guardians|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The way is still clear for a tyrant and a fraud|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/the-way-is-still-clear-for-a-tyrant-and-a-fraud-1324867.html|work=The Independent|accessdate=12 December 2017|date=20 January 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in his life, Maxwell escaped from [[Nazi occupation]], joined the [[Czechoslovak Army]] in exile in [[World War II]] and was decorated after active service in the [[British Army]]. In subsequent years he worked in publishing, building up [[Pergamon Press]] to a major publishing house. After six years as an MP during the 1960s, he again put all his energy into business, successively buying the [[British Printing Corporation]], [[Mirror Group Newspapers]] and [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Publishers]], among other publishing companies.

Maxwell had a flamboyant lifestyle, living in [[Headington Hill Hall]] in [[Oxford]], from which he often flew in his helicopter, and sailing in his luxury yacht, the ''[[Lady Mona K|Lady Ghislaine]]''. He was notably litigious and often embroiled in controversy, including about his support for [[Israel]] at the time of the [[1948 Palestine war]]. In 1989, he had to sell successful businesses, including Pergamon Press, to cover some of his debts. In 1991, his body was discovered floating in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], having fallen overboard from his yacht. He was buried in [[Jerusalem]].

Maxwell's death triggered the collapse of his publishing empire as banks called in loans. His sons briefly attempted to keep the business together, but failed as the news emerged that the elder Maxwell had stolen hundreds of millions of pounds from his own companies' pension funds. The Maxwell companies applied for [[bankruptcy]] protection in 1992.

==Early life==
Maxwell was born into a poor [[Yiddish]]-speaking [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[Jew]]ish family in the small town of Slatinské Doly (now [[Solotvyno]], [[Ukraine]]) in the easternmost province of pre-[[World War II]] [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref name="steinberg"&gt;Марк Штейнберг.

He had six siblings. In 1939, the area was reclaimed by [[Hungary]]. Most members of his family died in [[Auschwitz]] after Hungary was occupied in 1944 by [[Nazi Germany]], but he had already escaped to [[France]].&lt;ref name="steinberg"/&gt; In [[Marseille]], he joined the [[Czechoslovak Army]] in exile in May 1940.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vuapraha.cz/Pages/DatabazeVHA/DetailVojaka.aspx?soldierId=64095 Ludvík Hoch (Maxwell) in the database of Central Military Archive in Prague]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Battle of France|defeat in France]] and the retreat to [[Great Britain]], Maxwell (using the name "Ivan du Maurier" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rwOCvfd6Ud4C&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=%22ivan+du+maurier%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5gwXSXm0LF&amp;sig=-6I4xzs0sE-h42qK2kwDDK6UqYQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y2l1Vcb2OsqhsAGZjYC4CA&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ivan%20du%20maurier%22&amp;f=false|title=Naughty Boys: Ten Rogues of Oxford|work=google.se|accessdate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) took part in a protest against the leadership of the Czechoslovak Army, and with 500 other soldiers he was transferred to the [[Royal Pioneer Corps]] and later to the [[North Staffordshire Regiment]] in 1943. He was then involved in action across [[Europe]], from the [[Operation Overlord|Normandy beaches]] to [[Berlin]], and achieved the rank of [[Sergeant#United Kingdom|sergeant]].&lt;ref name="steinberg"/&gt; He gained a commission in 1945 and was promoted to the rank of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]]. In January 1945, he received the [[Military Cross]] from [[Bernard Montgomery|Field Marshal Montgomery]]. Attached to the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]], he served in Berlin during the next two years in the press section.&lt;ref name="Whitney"/&gt; Maxwell naturalised as a British subject on 19 June 1946&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=37658 |date=19 July 1946 |page=3739}}&lt;/ref&gt; and legally changed his name by [[deed of change of name]] on 30 June 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=38352 |date=13 July 1948 |page=4046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, he married [[Elisabeth Maxwell|Elisabeth "Betty" Meynard]], a [[French people|French]] [[Protestant]] with whom he had nine children with the goal of "recreating the family he lost in the [[Holocaust]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Witchell|first=Alex|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE1DD103BF936A25751C0A963958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Interview with Elisabeth Maxwell |work=The New York Times |date=15 February 1995 |accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five of his children were later employed within his companies. His three-year-old daughter, Karine, died of [[leukemia]] and his eldest son, Michael, was severely injured in a car crash in 1961 (at the age of fifteen) while being driven home from a post-Christmas party when his driver fell asleep at the wheel. Michael never regained consciousness and died seven years later.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell: The final verdict&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A mind of my own'' by Elisabeth Maxwell&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.free-researchpapers.com/dbs/a5/bmu335.shtml |title=Free Research Papers – Information Intelligence, 1991 |publisher=free-researchpapers.com |date=28 March 1999 |accessdate=31 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103051312/http://www.free-researchpapers.com/dbs/a5/bmu335.shtml |archivedate=3 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rampton|first=James|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3664778/Maxwell-was-a-monster-but-much-more-too.html|title='Maxwell was a monster - but much more, too'|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=28 April 2007|accessdate=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, Maxwell used various contacts in the [[Allied-occupied Germany|Allied occupation]] authorities to go into business, becoming the British and U.S. distributor for [[Springer Verlag]], a publisher of scientific books. In 1951, he bought three-quarters of Butterworth-Springer, a minor publisher; the remaining quarter was held by the experienced scientific editor [[Paul Rosbaud]].&lt;ref&gt;Haines (1988) 135&lt;/ref&gt; They changed the name of the company to [[Pergamon Press]] and rapidly built it into a major publishing house.

In 1964, representing the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], Maxwell was elected as [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Buckingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Buckingham]] and re-elected in 1966. He gave an interview to ''[[The Times]]'' in 1968, in which he said the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] provided him with a problem. "I can't get on with men", he commented. "I tried having male assistants at first. But it didn't work. They tend to be too independent. Men like to have individuality. Women can become an extension of the boss."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barwick|first=Sandra|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/the-beast-and-his-beauties-robert-maxwell-mesmerised-and-bullied-women-but-betty-his-wife-for-nearly-50-years-remained-loyal-her-autobiography-will-be-her-first-public-breach-of-that-loyalty-sandra-barwick-reports-1444890.html|title=The beast and his beauties|work=The Independent|date=25 October 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maxwell lost his seat in 1970 to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[William Benyon]]. He contested Buckingham again in both 1974 general elections, but without success.

At the beginning of 1969, it emerged that Maxwell's attempt to buy the ''[[News of the World]]'' had failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/2/newsid_2492000/2492157.stm|title=1969: Murdoch wins Fleet Street foothold|work=BBC'' On this Day 2 January}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Carr family, which owned the title, was incensed at the thought of a Czech immigrant with [[socialist]] politics gaining ownership and the board voted against Maxwell's bid without any dissent. The ''News of the World''{{'}}s editor [[Stafford Somerfield]] opposed Maxwell's bid in an October 1968 front page opinion piece, in which he referred to Maxwell's Czech origins and used his birth name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Greenslade|first=Roy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KPR0pB9UCS4C&amp;pg=PA213|title=Press Gang: How Newspapers Make Profits From Propaganda|location=London|publisher=Pan|year=2004|orig-year=2003|page=395}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote, "This is a British paper, run by British people...as British as roast beef and [[Yorkshire pudding]]...Let us keep it that way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grundy|first=Bill|url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/25th-october-1968/6/mr-maxwell-and-the-ailing-giant|title=Mr Maxwell and the Ailing Giant|work=The Spectator|date=24 October 1968|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tycoon who gained control was the [[Australia]]n [[Rupert Murdoch]], who later that year acquired ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', which had also previously interested Maxwell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15576907|title=The Maxwell Murdoch tabloid rivalry|work=BBC News|date=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pergamon lost and regained==
In 1969, [[Saul Steinberg (business)|Saul Steinberg]], head of "Leasco Data Processing Corporation", was interested in a strategic acquisition of Pergamon. Steinberg claimed that during negotiations, Maxwell falsely stated that a subsidiary responsible for publishing [[encyclopedia]]s was extremely profitable.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;Dennis Barker and Christopher Sylvester [http://politics.guardian.co.uk/politicsobituaries/story/0,1441,587914,00.html "The grasshopper",] – Obituary of Maxwell, ''The Guardian'', 6 November 1991. Retrieved on 19 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davenport69"&gt;Nicholas Davenport [http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/30th-august-1969/24/money-wanted-a-board-of-trade-inquiry "Money Wanted: A Board of Trade inquiry"], ''The Spectator'', 29 August 1969, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Pergamon had been forced to reduce its profit forecasts for 1969 from £2.5 million to £2.05 million during the period of negotiations, and dealing in Pergamon shares was suspended on the [[London stock exchange|London stock markets]].&lt;ref name="Davenport69"/&gt;

This caused Maxwell to lose control of Pergamon and he was expelled from the board in October 1969, along with three other directors in sympathy with him, by the majority owners of the company's shares.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Davenport [http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/18th-october-1969/22/money "Money: The End of the Affair"], ''The Spectator'', 17 October 1969, p.22&lt;/ref&gt; Steinberg purchased Pergamon. An inquiry by the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] (DTI) under the Takeover Code of the time reported in mid-1971:&lt;ref name="Whitney"/&gt; "We regret having to conclude that, notwithstanding Mr Maxwell's acknowledged abilities and energy, he is not in our opinion a person who can be relied on to exercise proper stewardship of a publicly quoted company." It was found that Maxwell had contrived to maximise Pergamon's share price through transactions between his private family companies.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

At the same time, the [[United States Congress]] was investigating Leasco's takeover practices. Justice [[Thayne Forbes]] in September 1971 was critical of the inquiry: "They had moved from an inquisitorial role to accusatory one and virtually committed the business murder of Mr. Maxwell." He further continued that the trial judge would probably find that the inspectors had acted "contrary to the rules of natural justice".&lt;ref name="A Mind of My Own: My Life with Robert Maxwell"&gt;Betty Maxwell, p. 542&lt;/ref&gt; The company performed poorly under Steinberg; Maxwell reacquired Pergamon in 1974 after borrowing funds.&lt;ref name="ketupaRM"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020818222600/http://www.ketupa.net/maxwell.htm "Robert Maxwell: Overview"], keputa.net&lt;/ref&gt;

Maxwell established the Maxwell Foundation in [[Liechtenstein]] in 1970. He acquired the British Printing Corporation (BPC) in 1981 and changed its name first to the British Printing and Communication Corporation (BPCC) and then to the [[Maxwell Communications Corporation]]. The company was later sold in a [[management buyout]] and is now known as Polestar.

==Later business activities==
In July 1984, Maxwell acquired [[Mirror Group Newspapers]] from [[Reed International]] plc.&lt;ref name="NYT84"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/14/world/briton-buys-the-mirror-chain.html "Briton Buys the Mirror Chain"], ''The New York Times'', 14 July 1984&lt;/ref&gt; for £113 million.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Greenslade [https://books.google.com/books?id=KPR0pB9UCS4C&amp;pg=PA395 ''Press Gang: How Newspapers Make Profits From Propaganda''], London: Pan, 2004 [2003], p.395&lt;/ref&gt; MGN, now part of [[Reach plc]], formerly Trinity Mirror, published the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', a pro-Labour [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]], and other popular newspapers in [[England]] and [[Scotland]]. At a press conference to publicise his acquisition, Maxwell said his editors would be "free to produce the news without interference".&lt;ref name="NYT84"/&gt; Meanwhile, at a meeting of Maxwell's new employees, ''Mirror'' journalist [[Joe Haines (journalist)|Joe Haines]] asserted that he was able to prove that their boss "is a crook and a liar".&lt;ref name="Spectator92"&gt;[http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/22nd-february-1992/15/say-it-aint-so-joe "Say It Ain't So, Joe"], ''The Spectator'', 22 February 1992, p.15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roy Greenslade [https://books.google.com/books?id=KPR0pB9UCS4C&amp;pg=PA395 ''Press Gang''], p.395&lt;/ref&gt; Haines quickly came under Maxwell's influence and later wrote his authorised biography.&lt;ref name="Spectator92"/&gt;

In June 1985, Maxwell announced a takeover of [[Clive Sinclair|Sir Clive Sinclair's]] ailing [[home computer]] company, [[Sinclair Research]], through Hollis Brothers, a Pergamon Press subsidiary.&lt;ref name="nyt-srl"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/18/business/sinclair-to-sell-british-unit.html|title=Sinclair to Sell British Unit|date=18 June 1985|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=4 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal was aborted in August 1985.&lt;ref name="sinc-corp-hist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nvg.ntnu.no/sinclair/sinclair/corphist.htm|title=Sinclair: A Corporate History|work=Planet Sinclair|accessdate=4 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, Maxwell purchased part of [[IPC Media]] to create [[Fleetway Publications]]. That same year, he launched the ''[[London Daily News]]'' in February after a delay caused by production problems, but the paper closed in July after sustaining significant losses contemporary estimates put at £25 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19870725&amp;id=HkJAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TFkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3086,5817873 "Maxwell Closes London Paper"], ''Glasgow Herald'', 25 July 1987, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; At first intended to be a rival to the ''[[London Evening Standard|Evening Standard]]'', Maxwell had made a rash decision for it to be the first 24-hour paper as well.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Campbell [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/aug/28/mondaymediasection.pressandpublishing1 "The London legacy of Cap'n Bob"], ''The Guardian'', 28 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1988, Maxwell's various companies owned, in addition to the Mirror titles and Pergamon Press, [[Nimbus Records]], [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Publishers]] (of which Collier was a part), Maxwell Directories, [[Prentice Hall]] Information Services and the [[Berlitz International|Berlitz language schools]]. He also owned a half-share of [[MTV]] in Europe and other European [[television]] interests, Maxwell Cable TV and Maxwell Entertainment.&lt;ref name="ketupaRM"/&gt; Maxwell purchased Macmillan, the American publishing firm, during 1988 for $2.6 billion. In the same year, he launched an ambitious new project, a transnational newspaper called ''[[The European (newspaper)|The European]]''. In 1991, he was forced to sell Pergamon Press and Maxwell Directories to [[Elsevier]] for £440 million to cover his debts;&lt;ref name="ketupaRM"/&gt; he used some of this money to buy an ailing tabloid, the [[New York City|New York]] ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]''. Also in 1991, Maxwell sold 49 percent of the stock of Mirror Group Newspapers to the public.&lt;ref name="Whitney"/&gt;

Maxwell's links with [[Eastern Europe]]an [[totalitarian]] regimes resulted in several biographies (generally considered to be [[Hagiography#Secular usage|hagiographies]]&lt;ref&gt;David Ellis and Sidney Urquhart [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,972683,00.html "Maxwell's Hall of Shame"], ''Time'', 8 April 1991&lt;/ref&gt;) of those countries' leaders, with interviews conducted by Maxwell, for which he received much derision.&lt;ref name="Whitney"/&gt; At the beginning of an interview with [[Romania]]'s [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], then the country's [[Communist]] leader, he asked, "How do you account for your enormous popularity with the Romanian people?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/21st-december-1991/3/-41- Editorial: "Breaking the Spell"], ''The Spectator'', 21 December 1991, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Oxford brookes headington hill.JPG|thumb|For the last 32 years of his life, Robert Maxwell lived at [[Headington Hill Hall]], which he rented from [[Oxford City Council]] and described as "the best [[council house]]" in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.headington.org.uk/history/famous_people/maxwell.htm ""], Headington History&lt;/ref&gt; It is now part of [[Oxford Brookes University]].]]
Maxwell was also the chairman of [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]], saving them from [[bankruptcy]] and attempting to merge them with [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] in 1983 to form a club he wished to call "[[Thames Valley Royals proposal|Thames Valley Royals]]". He took Oxford into the top flight of English football in 1985 and the team won the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] a year later. Maxwell bought into [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] in 1987. He also attempted to buy [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in 1984, but refused owner [[Martin Edwards]]'s asking price.

Maxwell was known to be litigious against those who would speak or write against him. The satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'' lampooned him as "Cap'n Bob" and the "bouncing Czech",&lt;ref&gt;Jon Kelly [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6620291.stm "The strange allure of Robert Maxwell"], BBC News, 4 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; the latter nickname having originally been devised by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Harold Wilson]]&lt;ref&gt;Reuters [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-05-01/news/sns-rt-newscorp-hackingmaxwelll5e8g18z9-20120501_1_lady-ghislaine-maxwell-companies-british-parliamentary-committee "Murdoch conclusion stirs memories of his old foe Maxwell"], ''Chicago Tribune'', 1 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; (under whom Maxwell was an MP). Maxwell took out several [[libel]] actions against ''Private Eye'', one resulting in the magazine losing an estimated £225,000 and Maxwell using his commercial power to hit back with a one-off spoof magazine ''[[Not Private Eye]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magforum.com/notprivateeye.htm "Not Private Eye"], Tony Quinn, ''Magforum.com'', 6 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Israeli connection==

===1948 war===
A hint of Maxwell's service to the [[Israel]]i state was provided by [[John Loftus (author)|John Loftus]] and [[Mark Aarons]], who described Maxwell's contacts with Czechoslovak anti-Stalinist Communist leaders in 1948 as crucial to the Czechoslovak decision to arm Israel in the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. Czechoslovak military assistance was both unique and crucial for the fledgling state as it battled for its existence. It was Maxwell's covert help in smuggling aircraft parts into Israel that led to the country having air supremacy during their [[1948 Palestine war|1948 War of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Loftus (author)|John Loftus]] and [[Mark Aarons]], ''The Secret War Against the Jews''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mossad allegations; Vanunu case===
Shortly before Maxwell's death, a former employee of Israel's [[Military Intelligence Directorate (Israel)|Military Intelligence Directorate]], [[Ari Ben-Menashe]], approached a number of news organisations in Britain and the U.S. with the allegation that Maxwell and the ''[[Daily Mirror]]''{{'}}s foreign editor, [[Nicholas Davies (journalist)|Nicholas Davies]], were both long-time agents for [[Mossad]]. Ben-Menashe also claimed that in 1986, Maxwell had told the [[Embassy of Israel, London|Israeli Embassy in London]] that [[Mordechai Vanunu]] had given information about [[Israel's nuclear capability]] to ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'', then to the ''Daily Mirror''. Vanunu was subsequently [[kidnap]]ped by Mossad and smuggled to Israel, convicted of [[treason]] and imprisoned for eighteen years.&lt;ref name="Verkaik"/&gt;

Ben-Menashe's story was ignored at first, but eventually ''[[The New Yorker]]'' journalist [[Seymour Hersh]] repeated some of the allegations during a press conference in London held to publicise ''[[The Samson Option: Israel's Nuclear Arsenal and American Foreign Policy|The Samson Option]]'', Hersh's book about Israel's nuclear weapons. On 21 October 1991, two MPs, [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]'s [[George Galloway]] and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative's]] [[Rupert Allason]] (also known as espionage author Nigel West), agreed to raise the issue in the House of Commons under [[Parliamentary Privilege]] protection,&lt;ref&gt;which allows MPs to ask questions in Parliament without risk of being sued for defamation.&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn allowed British newspapers to report events without fear of libel suits. Maxwell called the claims "ludicrous, a total invention" and sacked Davies.&lt;ref name="Laurence"/&gt; A year later, in Galloway's libel settlement against Mirror Group Newspapers (in which he received "substantial" damages), Galloway's counsel announced that the MP accepted that the group's staff had not been involved in Vanunu's abduction. Galloway himself, however, referred to Maxwell as "one of the worst criminals of the century."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/scottish-mp-wins-libel-damages-1.779636 "Scottish MP wins libel damages"], ''The Herald'' (Glasgow), 22 December 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On 5 November 1991, Maxwell was last in contact with the crew of his [[yacht]], the ''[[Lady Mona K|Lady Ghislaine]]'', at 4:25&amp;nbsp;a.m. local time, but was found to be missing later in the morning.&lt;ref name="Laurence"&gt;Ben Laurance and John Hooper, et al [https://www.theguardian.com/fromthearchive/story/0,,1078193,00.html "Maxwell's body found in sea"], ''The Guardian'', 6 November 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Maxwell was presumed to have fallen overboard from the vessel, which was cruising off the [[Canary Islands]],&lt;ref name="Laurence"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1249739.stm|title=Robert Maxwell: A Profile|publisher=BBC News|date=29 March 2001|accessdate=4 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his naked body was subsequently recovered from the [[Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref name="Verkaik"&gt;Robert Verkaik [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/the-mystery-of-maxwells-death-469294.html "The Mystery of Maxwell's Death"], ''The Independent'', 10 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The official ruling at an inquest held in December 1991 was death by a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] combined with accidental [[drowning]],&lt;ref name="Eichel"&gt;Larry Eichel [http://articles.philly.com/1991-12-14/news/25810731_1_lady-ghislaine-insurers-tycoon "Maxwell's Legacy Of Money Troubles Maxwell's Own ''Daily Mirror'' Newspaper Now Routinely Calls Him 'The Cheating Tycoon'"], ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', 14 December 1991&lt;/ref&gt; although three pathologists had been unable to agree on the cause of his death at the inquest;&lt;ref name="Verkaik"/&gt; he had been found to have been suffering from serious heart and lung conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Marlise Simons [https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/12/business/autopsy-indicates-maxwell-did-not-drown.html "Autopsy Indicates Maxwell Did Not Drown"], ''The New York Times'', 12 December 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Murder was ruled out by the judge and, in effect, so was suicide.&lt;ref name="Eichel"/&gt; He was buried on the [[Mount of Olives]] in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;Clyde Haberman [https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/11/business/the-media-business-maxwell-is-buried-in-jerusalem.html "The Media Business; Maxwell Is Buried In Jerusalem"], ''The New York Times'', 11 November 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime Minister [[John Major]] said Maxwell had given him "valuable insights" into the situation in the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|attempted coup of 1991]]. He was a "great character", Major added. [[Neil Kinnock]], then Labour Party leader, spoke of him as a man with "a zest for life" who "attracted controversy, envy and loyalty in great measure throughout his rumbustious life."

A production crew conducting research for ''[[Maxwell (film)|Maxwell]]'', an eponymous biographical film by the [[BBC]], uncovered tapes stored in a suitcase owned by his former head of security, John Pole. Later in his life, Maxwell had become increasingly paranoid of his own employees and had the offices of those he suspected of disloyalty [[Covert listening device|wired]] so he could hear their conversations. After Maxwell's death, the tapes remained in Pole's suitcase and were only discovered by the researchers in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC reveals secret Maxwell tapes|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6590755.stm|publisher=BBC|date=25 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath: Theft of pension funds, collapse of a publishing empire==
{{refimprove|section|date=June 2017}}

Maxwell's death triggered a flood of instability, with banks frantically calling in their massive loans. His sons, [[Kevin Maxwell|Kevin]] and [[Ian Maxwell|Ian]], struggled to hold the empire together, but were unable to prevent its collapse. It emerged that without adequate prior authorisation, Maxwell had used hundreds of millions of pounds from his companies' [[pension fund]]s to shore up the shares of the Mirror Group to save his companies from bankruptcy.&lt;ref name="prok"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Prokesch|first1=Steven|title=Maxwell's Mirror Group Has $727.5 Million Loss|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/24/business/maxwell-s-mirror-group-has-727.5-million-loss.html|accessdate=9 February 2018|work=The New York Times|date=24 June 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the pension funds were replenished with monies from [[investment bank]]s [[Shearson Lehman]] and [[Goldman Sachs]], as well as the British government. This replenishment was limited and also supported by a surplus in the printers' fund, which was taken by the government in part payment of £100 million required to support the workers' state pensions. The rest of the £100 million was waived. Maxwell's theft of pension funds was therefore partly repaid from public funds. The result was that in general pensioners received about 50 percent of their company pension entitlement.

The Maxwell companies filed for bankruptcy protection in 1992. Kevin Maxwell was declared bankrupt with debts of £400 million. In 1995, Kevin and Ian and two other former directors went on trial for conspiracy to defraud, but were unanimously [[acquittal|acquitted]] by a twelve-man jury in 1996.

In November 1994, Maxwell's widow, Elisabeth, published her memoirs, ''A Mind of My Own: My Life with Robert Maxwell'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v17/n02/jenny-diski/bob-and-betty |title=Bob and Betty |last=Diski |first=Jenny |authorlink=Jenny Diski|date=26 January 1995|website=[[London Review of Books]]|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which sheds light on her life with Maxwell, when the publishing magnate was ranked as one of the richest individuals in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE6D81139F932A35752C0A963958260 | work=The New York Times | title=A Match for Robert Maxwell | first=Ben | last=MacIntyre | date=1 January 1995 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She devoted much of her life to researching the Holocaust and to Judeo-Christian dialogue.

'''SS ''Calabria''''' was a passenger and cargo steamship. [[AG Weser]] built her for [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]]. She was launched as '''D/S ''Werra''''' and completed in 1922.  ("D/S" stands for ''Dampfschiff'' in German as "SS" stands for "steamship" in English.)

In 1935 she was bought by [[Italian Line|Flotte Riunite Cosulich-Lloyd-Sabaudo Navigazione Generale]], who renamed her '''''Calabria'''''. In 1937 she was sold to [[Italia Marittima|Lloyd Triestino]].

In June 1940 the UK seized her and placed in the management of the [[British-India Steam Navigation Company]]. In December 1940 she was torpedoed and sunk. When she sank, all of her 360 passengers and crew lost their lives. The [[Ministry of War Transport]] (MoWT) was going to rename her '''''Empire Inventor''''', but she was sunk before this had been done.

==Building and career==
The [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] seized numerous NDL ships either during the First World War as [[Prize (law)|prize ships]] or afterwards for [[World War I reparations|war reparations]]. In the 1920s NDL replaced them with a new fleet from [[Bremer Vulkan]], [[AG Vulcan Stettin]] and AG Weser. The first of the new ships were delivered in 1922; ''Werra'' among them.

''Werra'' was one of a series of six [[sister ship]]s that AG Weser built for NDL. ''Werra'' and {{SS|Weser|1922|2}} were completed in 1922;&lt;ref name=LR33/&gt; {{SS|Coblenz|1923|2}}, {{SS|Saarbrücken|1923|2}} and {{SS|Trier|1923|2}} in 1923&lt;ref name=LR-Sicilia&gt;

''Werra'' had two three-cylinder [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|triple-expansion steam engines]] and twin [[Propeller (marine)|screws]].&lt;ref name=LR33/&gt; Between them her two engines were rated at 604 [[Horsepower#Nominal horsepower|NHP]].&lt;ref name=LR33/&gt; ''Werra'' was equipped with wireless [[direction finding]] and submarine signalling.&lt;ref name=LR33/&gt;

In 1935 NDL sold ''Werra'', ''Coblenz'' and ''Saarbrücken'' to Flotte Riunite Cosulich-Lloyd-Sabaudo which renamed them ''Calabria'', ''Sicilia'' and ''Toscana'' and registered them in [[Port of Genoa|Genoa]].&lt;ref name=LR36/&gt;&lt;ref name=LR-Sicilia/&gt;&lt;ref name=LR-Toscana/&gt; In 1937 the three ships were sold to [[Italia Marittima|Lloyd Triestino]],&lt;ref name=LR-Sicilia/&gt;&lt;ref name=LR-Toscana/&gt; which registered ''Calabria'' in [[Port of Trieste|Trieste]].&lt;ref name=LR37/&gt;

On 10 June 1940 Italy declared war on France and the United Kingdom. At the time ''Calabria'' was in drydock in [[Port of Kolkata|Calcutta]] in [[British Raj|British India]], so on 11 June the British authorities seized her.&lt;ref name=Uboat/&gt; She was transferred to the MoWT, which appointed the [[British-India Steam Navigation Company]] to manage her.&lt;ref name=Uboat/&gt; The MoWT planned to rename her ''[[Empire ship|Empire]] Inventor'', but this intention was overtaken by events.&lt;ref name=Uboat/&gt;

The term '''Scharfrichter''' ([[German language|German]] for [[executioner]], literally: "sharp judge") refers specifically to a tradition of executioners in the German states. Using a [[Executioner's sword|sword of execution]], they had the responsibility of actually executing prisoners; his assistant, the "Löwe" (lion), would carry out tasks such as forcibly conveying prisoners to the presence of a [[judge]] (while roaring, whence the name), "rubbish clearance", burying unwanted bodies, and carrying out [[human branding|brandings]]. The Scharfrichter was a well-known figure nicknamed the "Mate of Death" and instantly recognizable in their traditional black [[frock coat]] and [[silk]] [[top hat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Farrington |first=Karen |title=Dark Justice: A History of Punishment and Torture |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=2M5nPQAACAAJ |publisher=Smithmark |year=1996 |page=132 |isbn=0-7651-9910-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "Scharfrichter" is composed of the words "scharf" (sharp/edged), and "Richter" (judge), because he had to do justice (richten) with the sword.

This differentiation prompts the practitioner to consider the psychological, behavioral, and social changes of the adolescent who is experiencing pubertal development.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most [[multicellular]] organisms are unable to [[sexually reproduce]] at birth (or germination), and depending on the species, it may be days, weeks, or years until their bodies are able to do so. Also, certain cues may cause the organism to become sexually mature. They may be external, such as drought, or internal, such as percentage of body fat (such internal cues are not to be confused with hormones which directly produce sexual maturity).

Sexual maturity is brought about by a maturing of the reproductive organs and the production of [[gamete]]s. It may also be accompanied by a growth spurt or other physical changes which distinguish the immature organism from its adult form. These are termed [[secondary sex characteristic]]s, and often represent an increase in [[sexual dimorphism]]. For example, before puberty, human children have flat chests, but adult females have generally larger [[breast]]s than adult males. However, there are exceptions such as obesity and hormone imbalances such as [[gynecomastia]].

After sexual maturity is achieved, it is possible for some organisms to become [[infertile]], or even to [[Sex change|change their sex]]. Some organisms are [[hermaphrodite]]s and may or may not be able to produce viable offspring. Also, while in many organisms sexual maturity is strongly linked to age, many other factors are involved, and it is possible for some to display most or all of the characteristics of the adult form without being sexually mature. Conversely it is also possible for the "immature" form of an organism to reproduce. This is called ''progenesis'', in which sexual development occurs faster than other physiological development (in contrast, the term ''[[neoteny]]'' refers to when non-sexual development is slowed - but the result is the same, the retention of juvenile characteristics into adulthood).

'''Thomas Butler, Viscount Thurles''' (before 1596 &amp;ndash; 15 December 1619) was the son and heir apparent of [[Walter Butler, 11th Earl of Ormond]]  (1559 – 1632/3) (whom he predeceased) and [[Helen Butler]]. He resided at Thurles Castle, [[Thurles]], [[County Tipperary]]. He was the father of the noted [[Anglo-Irish]] statesman and [[Royalist]] commander [[James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde]].

==Marriage and early death==
Sometime before 1610, he married [[Elizabeth, Lady Thurles|Elizabeth Poyntz]] against his father's wishes. She was the daughter of Sir [[John Pointz|John Poyntz]] (d.1633) of [[Iron Acton]] in [[Gloucestershire]] and Elizabeth Sydenham.

In 1619 at the beginning of his father's long imprisonment in the [[Fleet Prison]], Thomas was summoned to England to answer charges of [[treason]], specifically, of having garrisoned [[Kilkenny]]. However, the ship conveying him was wrecked off the coast of [[The Skerries, Isle of Anglesey]] and he was drowned. Like his father, Viscount Thurles was a prominent [[Catholic]] and it seems likely that his refusal to conform to the established [[Anglican]] religion had angered King [[James I of England|James I]], and may have been the true motive for his summons.

==Issue==
His children by Elizabeth Poyntz were:
* [[James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde]] (1610–1688). With his father drowned and his grandfather in prison, James was made a royal ward and, unlike his parents or siblings, was brought up in the [[Protestant]] religion.
* John Butler who died unmarried at Naples, on his travels, in 1636.&lt;ref&gt;''Lodge, John'': The Peerage of Ireland or, A Genealogical History Of The Present Nobility Of That Kingdom'', 1789, Vol IV, pg39.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Richard Butler of Kilcash]] (b. 1615 - d. 1701) had a confirmation (by virtue of the commission of grace) 24 June 1639, of the lands of Kilcash, Garryricken and many others in the counties of Tipperary and Kilkenny; with a limitation thereof to his heirs male; remainder to the respective heirs male of Walter Earl of Ormond.
* Ellen (Eleanor) Butler (died April 1682), married to [[Donough MacCarty, 1st Earl of Clancarty]], was buried in the Chancel of St. Michan's church.
* Elizabeth Butler. She first married James Purcell, titular Baron of Loughmoe, by whom she had one son Nicholas and two daughters; Catharine and Mary.
* Mary Butler who married [[Sir George Hamilton, 1st Baronet, of Donalong]] and had descendants.

'''Tissue gas''' is the name given to the action of the bacteria ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'' (formerly known as ''C. welchii'') in dead bodies. Its effect on the deceased is that of an extremely accelerated [[decomposition]]. It is only halted by [[embalming]] the body using special additive chemicals. It most commonly occurs in the bodies of people who have died of [[gangrene]], large [[decubitus ulcers]], [[necrotising fasciitis]] or who have had soil, [[faeces]] or water forced into wounds.

'''Winston''' (1937–1957) was a chestnut [[gelding]] ridden by both [[King George VI]] in 1947 and [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in the [[Trooping the Colour]] ceremony from 1949 to 1956.

==Biography==
Winston, whose sire was Erehwemos, was foaled in Yorkshire in 1937. In 1944 he was sold to the Mounted Branch of the [[Metropolitan Police Service]].&lt;ref&gt;p.333 Summerhays, Reginald Sherriff  ''Encyclopaedia for Horsemen'' F. Warne, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;   Though named for [[Winston Churchill]], the letter "W" was used to name all police horses in 1944.&lt;ref name="equest"&gt;http://www.equestmagazine.com/v3s8/article09-08-c6.php&lt;/ref&gt;  As a police horse, Winston often was present on duty at public events such as the [[Queen's Guard#Changing the Queen's Life Guard|Changing of the Guard]] before he was selected for Royal duties.

In 1947, Winston carried King George VI during the first Trooping of the Colour to take place since 1939. Winston participated in various roles in other Royal ceremonial events when not working as a police horse. From 1949 to 1951, then Princess Elizabeth took her father's place at the ceremony, becoming the first British Queen since [[Elizabeth I]] to review her troops on horseback.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,859700,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; Though other police horse were made available, the Queen always preferred Winston.&lt;ref&gt;p. 92 Mitchell, Charles ''The Queen's Horses'' MacDonald, 1955&lt;/ref&gt; The year of 1951 led to the future Queen first wearing her red Guards uniform; prior to this she wore a blue uniform.&lt;ref&gt;p.82-83 Gow, Michael ''Trooping the Colour: A History of the Sovereign's Birthday Parade'' 1988 Souvenir Press&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II]] procession, Winston was ridden by Sir [[John Nott-Bower]], the [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis]].

Winston retired from Troopings and other Royal Duties in 1956. Whilst later being ridden by a mounted police officer at the Police mounted training establishment at [[Thames Ditton]], Winston slipped and dislocated his back on 7 February 1957, requiring him to be euthanised.&lt;ref name="equest"/&gt;

From 1957 the Queen rode a chestnut horse named Imperial.&lt;ref&gt;p.150 Glover, FJH ''1000 Famous Horses Fact &amp; Fictional Throughout the Ages'' 2011 Xlibris Corporation{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
