'''980 Anacostia''' is a [[minor planet]] orbiting the [[Sun]] that was discovered by American astronomer [[George Henry Peters]] on November 21, 1921. The name recognizes the [[Anacostia River]] and an historic neighborhood of the same name in the city of Washington D.C.

Measurements using the [[adaptive optics]] system at the [[W. M. Keck Observatory]] give a diameter of 70 ± 6&amp;nbsp;km. This is 23% smaller than the diameter estimated from the [[IRAS]] observatory data. The size ratio between the major and minor axes is 1.09.&lt;ref name="Marchis2006"/&gt;

[[Polarimetric]] study of this asteroid reveals anomalous properties that suggests the [[regolith]] consists of a mixture of low and high [[albedo]] material. This may have been caused by fragmentation of an asteroid [[Stratum|substrate]] with the spectral properties of CO3/CV3 [[carbonaceous chondrites]].&lt;ref name="GilHutton2008"/&gt;

An '''alluvial fan''' is a [[fan (implement)|fan]]- or [[cone]]-shaped [[deposition (geology)|deposit]] of [[sediment]] crossed and built up by [[streams]]. If a fan is built up by [[debris flows]] it is properly called a [[debris cone]] or [[Colluvium|colluvial fan]]. These flows come from a single point source at the [[apex (geometry)|apex]] of the fan, and over time move to occupy many positions on the fan surface. Fans are typically found where a [[canyon]] draining from mountainous [[terrain]] emerges out onto a flatter [[plain]], and especially along [[fault (geology)|fault]]-bounded [[mountain]] fronts.

A convergence of neighboring alluvial fans into a single apron of deposits against a slope is called a [[bajada (geography)|bajada]].

==Formation==

As a stream's gradient decreases, it drops coarse-grained material.  It makes swagger of the channel and forces it to change direction and gradually build up a slightly mounded or shallow conical fan shape. The deposits are usually [[Sorting (sediment)|poorly sorted]].&lt;ref name="AGI_1962"&gt;American Geological Institute. ''Dictionary of Geological Terms''. New York: Dolphin Books, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;To clarify, solids are sorted as usual, with coarse sediment dropped out first -- but the sorting of an individual flood event is then "jumbled" by the next flood, leaving the overall fan sediment package poorly sorted.&lt;/ref&gt; This fan shape can also be explained with a [[thermodynamic]] justification: the system of [[sediment]] introduced at the apex of the fan will tend to a state which minimizes the sum of the transport [[energy]] involved in moving the sediment and the [[gravitational potential]] of material in the fan. There will be iso-transport [[energy]] lines forming concentric [[Arc (geometry)|arc]]s about the discharge point at the apex of the fan. Thus the material will tend to be deposited equally about these lines, forming the characteristic fan shape.

==In arid climates==

Alluvial fans are often found in [[desert]] areas often subjected to periodic [[flash flood]]s from nearby [[thunderstorms]] in local [[hill]]s. The typical [[watercourse]] in an [[arid]] [[climate]] has a large, funnel-shaped basin at the top, leading to a narrow [[defile (geography)|defile]], which opens out into an alluvial fan at the bottom. Multiple [[braided stream]]s are usually present and active during water flows.

[[Phreatophyte]]s are [[plant]]s that are often concentrated at the base of alluvial fans. They have long tap [[root]]s {{convert|30|to|50|ft}} to reach water that has seeped through the fan and hit an impermeable layer, sometimes collecting in [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] and [[Seep (hydrology)|seeps]]. These stands of [[shrub]]s cling to the [[soil]] at their bases and often form islands of [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] for many [[animal]]s as the [[wind]] blows the [[sand]] around the bushes away.

==In humid climates==

Alluvial fans also develop in wetter climates. In [[Geography of Nepal|Nepal]] the [[Koshi River]] has built a [[megafan]] covering some {{convert|15000|km2|abbr=on}} below its exit from [[Mahabharat Lekh|Himalayan foothills]] onto the nearly level plains where the river traverses into [[Geography of India|India]] before joining the [[Ganges]]. 
Along the upper Koshi tributaries, tectonic forces elevate the [[Himalayas]] several millimeters annually. Uplift is approximately in equilibrium with erosion, so the river annually carries some 100 million cubic meters (3.5 billion cu ft) of sediment as it exits the mountains. Deposition of this magnitude over millions of years is more than sufficient to account for the megafan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

All along the interface between the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]] and the Himalaya in India, [[Geography of Pakistan|Pakistan]], Nepal and [[Geography of Bhutan|Bhutan]] the outermost, lowest [[Siwalik]] foothills are built of poorly consolidated [[sedimentary rock]]s that have eroded into a wide, continuous alluvial apron called [[Bhabar]] in [[Hindi language (Hindi belt)|Hindi]] and [[Nepali language|Nepali]].  Despite [[human overpopulation]] on the plains, this bhabar zone is highly [[malaria]]l and has remained largely [[List of uninhabited regions|uninhabited]].

In [[North America]], streams flowing into [[California|California's]] [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] have deposited smaller but still extensive alluvial fans, such as that of the [[Kings River (California)|Kings River]] flowing out of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] which creates a low [[Drainage divide|divide]], turning the south end of the [[San Joaquin Valley]] into an [[endorheic basin]] without a connection to the [[ocean]].

==Flood hazards==

Alluvial fans are subject to flooding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2002)128:3(322)|title=Experimental Steep, Braided Flow: Application to Flooding Risk on Fans|year=2002|last1=Cazanacli|first1=Dan|first2=Chris|first3=Gary|journal=Journal of Hydraulic Engineering|volume=128|pages=322|last2=Paola|last3=Parker|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=0-309-05542-3|authors=Committee on Alluvial Fan Flooding, Water Science and Technology Board, Commission on Geosciences, Environment, and Resources, National Research Council.|year=1996|publisher=National Academy Press|location=Washington, D.C.|title=Alluvial fan flooding}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be even more dangerous than the upstream canyons that feed them. Their slightly convex perpendicular surfaces cause water to spread widely until there is no zone of refuge. If the gradient is steep, active transport of materials down the fan creates a moving substrate that is inhospitable to travel on foot or wheels. But as the gradient diminishes downslope, water comes down from above faster than it can flow away downstream, and may pond to hazardous depths.

In the case of the [[Koshi River]], the huge sediment load and megafan's slightly convex transverse surface conspire against engineering efforts to contain peak flows inside manmade embankments. In [[2008 Bihar flood|August 2008]] high [[monsoon]] flows breached the embankment, diverting most of the river into an unprotected ancient channel and across surrounding lands with high [[population density]]. Over a million people were rendered homeless, about a thousand lost their lives and thousands of hectares of crops were destroyed. The Koshi is known as the ''Sorrow of Bihar'' for contributing disproportionately to India's death tolls in flooding, which exceed those of all countries except [[Geography of Bangladesh|Bangladesh]].

==In the Solar System==
===Mars===

Alluvial fans are also found on [[Mars]] descending from some crater rims over their flatter floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Three alluvial fans have been found in [[Saheki (crater)|Saheki Crater]] on Mars. These fans confirmed fluvial flow on Mars and further supported the theory that liquid water was once present in some form on the Martian surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morgan|first=A.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Titan===

Alluvial fans have been observed by the [[Cassini-Huygens]] mission on [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] using the Cassini orbiter's [[synthetic aperture radar]] (SAR) instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2013/pdf/2641.pdf |author=J. Radebaugh |display-authors=etal |title=Alluvial Fans on Titan Reveal Materials, Processes and Regional Conditions |work=44th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference |date=2013 |accessdate=January 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These fans are more common in the drier mid-latitudes at the end of methane/ethane rivers where it is thought that frequent wetting and drying occur due to precipitation, much like arid fans on Earth. Radar imaging suggests that fan material is most likely composed of round grains of water ice or solid [[organic compounds]] about two centimetres in diameter.

The '''Bellona Platform''' is a submarine geological feature encompassing the [[Chesterfield Islands]] ({{coord|19|21|S|158|40|E|type:isle_globe:earth_region:XP|display=inline}}) &lt;!-- source: [[Chesterfield Islands]] --&gt; and [[Bellona Reefs]] ({{coord|-20.999948|158.999313|type:mountain_globe:earth_region:XP|display=inline}}) &lt;!-- source: Google Maps search --&gt; west of [[New Caledonia]]. It was once a {{convert|22800|km2}} landmass, which became mostly submerged when sea levels rose at the end of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]], 20,000 years ago. It might have played a role in the spread of flora and fauna, including humans, in the southwest Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Vanished Islands and Hidden Continents of the Pacific |last=Nunn |first=Patrick D. |year=2009 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |location=Honolulu |isbn=978-0-8248-3219-3 |pages=181 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3967">The '''Bili Forest''' is located in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] in [[Central Africa]] in the [[Bas-Uele District]].  It lies between the [[Ubangi River|Ubangui River]] to the north and the [[Uele River]] to the south, and is named after the small nearby town of Bili (coordinates 4°9'N 25°10'E) which is about 200 km east of [[Bondo, DR Congo|Bondo]] and 250 km north of [[Buta, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Buta]].&lt;ref&gt;''Michelin Motoring and Tourist Map'': "Africa Central and South". Michelin Travel Publications, Paris, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bondo and Bili are accessible only by earth tracks impassable after rain (the [[Transport in DR Congo|Vicicongo narrow gauge railway]] which served the region is defunct). The region is very unstable and virtually lawless, due to a lack of governmental services as the country recovers slowly from civil warfare. Human encroachment into the region, other than annual burning of the [[Savanna|savannah]]s, is minimal but hunting is prevalent.

The forest comprises a complex mosaic habitat, consisting of savannah, savannah-woodland, regenerating forest and gallery forest. The area is rich in African fauna typifying both savannah and forest habitats, including: [[elephant]]s, [[lion]]s, [[hyena]]s, [[leopard]]s, [[giant forest hog]]s, [[giant pangolin]], [[baboon]]s, [[grey-cheeked mangabey]]s, [[red-tailed guenon]]s, and [[African buffalo|buffalo]].

In addition, a population of [[great ape]]s living in the Bili Forest has intrigued experts. Known as the '[[Bili ape]]s' or 'Bondo mystery apes', they appear to blend characteristics of [[chimpanzee]]s and [[gorilla]]s. Initial results from [[mitochondrial DNA]] analysis indicate that they are chimpanzees.

There is a very serious problem of [[bush meat]] poaching in the Bili Forest, affecting the elephant and chimpanzee populations. If the forest's chimpanzees and their habitat are to be protected effectively, a serious conservation project is imperative.

{{evolutionary biology}}

'''Biogeography''' is the study of the distribution of [[species]] and [[ecosystem]]s in [[geography|geographic space]] and through [[evolutionary history of life|geological time]]. Organisms and biological [[communities]] often vary in a regular fashion along geographic gradients of [[latitude]], [[elevation]], [[allopatric speciation|isolation]] and habitat [[species-area curve|area]].&lt;ref name="Brown University"&gt;Brown University, "Biogeography." Accessed February 24, 2014. {{cite web |url=http://biomed.brown.edu/Courses/BIO48/29.Biogeography.HTML |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020041149/http://biomed.brown.edu/Courses/BIO48/29.Biogeography.HTML |archivedate=2014-10-20 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phytogeography]] is the branch of biogeography that studies the distribution of plants. [[Zoogeography]] is the branch that studies distribution of animals.

Knowledge of spatial variation in the numbers and types of organisms is as vital to us today as it was to our early human [[ancestors]], as we adapt to heterogeneous but geographically predictable [[Natural environment|environments]]. Biogeography is an integrative field of inquiry that unites concepts and information from [[ecology]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[geology]], and [[physical geography]].&lt;ref name= "Dansereau"&gt;Dansereau, Pierre. 1957. Biogeography; an ecological perspective. New York: Ronald Press Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern biogeographic research combines information and ideas from many fields, from the physiological and ecological constraints on organismal [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] to [[geological]] and [[climatological]] phenomena operating at global spatial scales and [[evolution]]ary time frames.

The short-term interactions within a habitat and species of organisms describe the ecological application of biogeography. Historical biogeography describes the long-term, evolutionary periods of time for broader classifications of organisms.&lt;ref name=Cox&gt;Cox, C Barry, and Peter Moore. Biogeography : an ecological and evolutionary approach. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publications, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Early scientists, beginning with [[Carl Linnaeus]], contributed to the development of biogeography as a science. Beginning in the mid-18th century, Europeans explored the world and discovered the [[biodiversity]] of life.

The scientific theory of biogeography grows out of the work of [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1769–1859),&lt;ref&gt;von Humboldt 1805. ''Essai sur la geographie des plantes; accompagne d'un tableau physique des régions equinoxiales''. Levrault, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hewett Cottrell Watson]] (1804–1881),&lt;ref&gt;Watson H.C. 1847–1859. ''Cybele Britannica: or British plants and their geographical relations''.

==Introduction==
The patterns of species distribution across geographical areas can usually be explained through a combination of historical factors such as: [[speciation]], [[extinction]], [[continental drift]], and [[glaciation]]. Through observing the geographic distribution of species, we can see associated variations in [[sea level]], river routes, habitat, and [[river capture]]. Additionally, this science considers the geographic constraints of [[landmass]] areas and isolation, as well as the available ecosystem energy supplies.

Over periods of [[ecology|ecological]] changes, biogeography includes the study of plant and animal species in: their past and/or present living ''[[refugium (population biology)|refugium]]'' [[habitat]]; their interim living sites; and/or their survival locales.&lt;ref&gt;Martiny JBH et al. [http://alrlab.pdx.edu/media/HughesBiogeoNature.pdf Microbial biogeography: putting microorganisms on the map] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621194350/http://alrlab.pdx.edu/media/HughesBiogeoNature.pdf |date=2010-06-21 }} ''Nature: FEBRUARY 2006 | VOLUME 4''&lt;/ref&gt; As writer David Quammen put it, "...biogeography does more than ask ''Which species?'' and ''Where''. It also asks ''Why?'' and, what is sometimes more crucial, ''Why not?''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Quammen | first=David | authorlink=David Quammen | title=Song of the Dodo: Island Biogeography in an Age of Extinctions | publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]] | year=1996 | location=New York | pages=17 | isbn=978-0-684-82712-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern biogeography often employs the use of [[Geographic Information Systems]] (GIS), to understand the factors affecting organism distribution, and to predict future trends in organism distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Cavalcanti, Mauro. (2009). Biogeography and GIS. {{cite web |url=http://digitaltaxonomy.infobio.net/?Software:Biogeography_and_GIS |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015021915/http://digitaltaxonomy.infobio.net/?Software:Biogeography_and_GIS |archivedate=2006-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Often mathematical models and GIS are employed to solve ecological problems that have a spatial aspect to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Whittaker |first=R. |year=1998 |title=Island Biogeography: Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-19-850021-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biogeography is most keenly observed on the world's [[island]]s. These habitats are often much more manageable areas of study because they are more condensed than larger ecosystems on the mainland.&lt;ref name=Mac&gt;MacArthur R.H.; Wilson E.O. 1967. ''The theory of island biogeography''. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=a10cdkywhVgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=biogeography&amp;ots=Rf3VtCTaJC&amp;sig=zrScVPc_Bn9QSyG-PZTPVWUcmKA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Islands are also ideal locations because they allow scientists to look at habitats that new [[invasive species]] have only recently colonized and can observe how they disperse throughout the island and change it.  They can then apply their understanding to similar but more complex mainland habitats.  Islands are very diverse in their [[biome]]s, ranging from the tropical to arctic climates.  This diversity in habitat allows for a wide range of species study in different parts of the world.

One scientist who recognized the importance of these geographic locations was [[Charles Darwin]], who remarked in his journal "The Zoology of Archipelagoes will be well worth examination".&lt;ref name=Mac/&gt; Two chapters in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' were devoted to geographical distribution.

==History==

===18th century===
The first discoveries that contributed to the development of biogeography as a science began in the mid-18th century, as Europeans explored the world and discovered the biodiversity of life.  During the 18th century most views on the world were shaped around religion and for many natural theologists, the bible. [[Carl Linnaeus]], in the mid-18th century, initiated the ways to classify organisms through his exploration of undiscovered territories.  When he noticed that species were not as perpetual as he believed, he developed the Mountain Explanation to explain the distribution of biodiversity.  When Noah's ark landed on Mount Ararat and the waters receded, the animals dispersed throughout different elevations on the mountain. This showed different species in different climates proving species were not constant.&lt;ref name=Cox /&gt; Linnaeus' findings set a basis for ecological biogeography.   Through his strong beliefs in Christianity, he was inspired to classify the living world, which then gave way to additional accounts of secular views on geographical distribution.&lt;ref name=Browne /&gt; He argued that the structure of an animal was very closely related to its physical surroundings. This was important to a George Louis Buffon's rival theory of distribution.&lt;ref name=Browne /&gt;
[[File:Plos wilson.jpg|thumb|left|[[Edward Osborne Wilson|Edward O. Wilson]], a prominent biologist and conservationist, coauthored ''[[The Theory of Island Biogeography]]'' and helped to start much of the research that has been done on this topic since the work of Watson and Wallace almost a century before]]
Closely after Linnaeus, [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] observed shifts in climate and how species spread across the globe as a result. He was the first to see different groups of organisms in different regions of the world. Buffon saw similarities between some regions which led him to believe that at one point continents were connected and then water separated them and caused differences in species. His hypotheses were described by his books, Histoire Naturelle, and Générale et Particulière, in which he argued that varying geographical regions would have different forms of life. This was inspired by his observations comparing the Old and New World, as he determined distinct variations of species from the two regions. Buffon believed there was a single species creation event, and that different regions of the world were homes for varying species, which is an alternate view than that of Linnaeus.  Buffon's law eventually became a principle of biogeography by explaining how similar environments were habitats for comparable types of organisms.&lt;ref name=Browne /&gt; Buffon also studied fossils which led him to believe that the earth was over tens of thousands of years old, and that humans had not lived there long in comparison to the age of the earth.&lt;ref name=Cox /&gt;

Following this period of exploration came the [[Age of Enlightenment]] in Europe, which attempted to explain the patterns of biodiversity observed by Buffon and Linnaeus. At the end of the 18th century, Alexander von Humboldt, known as the "founder of plant geography",&lt;ref name=Cox /&gt; developed the concept of physique generale to demonstrate the unity of science and how species fit together. As one of the first to contribute empirical data to the science of biogeography through his travel as an explorer, he observed differences in climate and vegetation.  The earth was divided into regions which he defined as tropical, temperate, and arctic and within these regions there were similar forms of vegetation.&lt;ref name=Cox /&gt; This ultimately enabled him to create the isotherm, which allowed scientists to see patterns of life within different climates.&lt;ref name=Cox /&gt; He contributed his observations to findings of botanical geography by previous scientists, and sketched this description of both the biotic and abiotic features of the earth in his book, ''[[Cosmos (Humboldt)|Cosmos]]''.&lt;ref name=Browne /&gt;

Augustin de Candolle contributed to the field of biogeography as he observed species competition and the several differences that influenced the discovery of the diversity of life. He was a Swiss botanist and created the first Laws of Botanical Nomenclature in his work, Prodromus.&lt;ref name=Nicolson&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nicolson | first1 = D.H. | year = 1991 | title = A History of Botanical Nomenclature | url = | journal = Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden | volume = 78 | issue = 1| pages = 33–56 | doi = 10.2307/2399589 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He discussed plant distribution and his theories eventually had a great impact on Charles Darwin, who was inspired to consider species adaptations and evolution after learning about botanical geography. De Candolle was the first to describe the differences between the small-scale and large-scale distribution patterns of organisms around the globe.&lt;ref name=Browne /&gt;

===19th century===
In the 19th century, several additional scientists contributed new theories to further develop the concept of biogeography.  [[Charles Lyell]], being one of the first contributors in the 19th century, developed the Theory of [[Uniformitarianism]] after studying fossils.  This theory explained how the world was not created by one sole catastrophic event, but instead from numerous creation events and locations.&lt;ref name=Lyell&gt;Lyell, Charles. 1830. Principles of geology, being an attempt to explain the former changes of the Earth's surface, by reference to causes now in operation. London: John Murray. Volume 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Uniformitarianism also introduced the idea that the Earth was actually significantly older than was previously accepted. Using this knowledge, Lyell concluded that it was possible for species to go extinct.&lt;ref&gt;Lomolino, Mark V., and Lawrence R. Heaney. 2004. Frontiers of biogeography: new directions in the geography of nature. Sunderland, Mass: Sinauer Associates&lt;/ref&gt;  Since he noted that earth’s climate changes, he realized that species distribution must also change accordingly.  Lyell argued that climate changes complemented vegetation changes, thus connecting the environmental surroundings to varying species. This largely influenced Charles Darwin in his development of the theory of evolution.&lt;ref name=Browne /&gt;

[[Charles Darwin]] was a natural theologist who studied around the world, and most importantly in the [[Galapagos Islands]]. Darwin introduced the idea of natural selection, as he theorized against previously accepted ideas that species were static or unchanging. His contributions to biogeography and the theory of evolution were different from those of other explorers of his time, because he developed a mechanism to describe the ways that species changed. His influential ideas include the development of theories regarding the struggle for existence and natural selection. Darwin's theories started a biological segment to biogeography and empirical studies, which enabled future scientists to develop ideas about the geographical distribution of organisms around the globe.&lt;ref name=Browne /&gt;

Alfred Russel Wallace studied the distribution of flora and fauna in the [[Amazon Basin]] and the [[Malay Archipelago]] in the mid-19th century. His research was essential to the further development of biogeography, and he was later nicknamed the "father of Biogeography". Wallace conducted fieldwork researching the habits, breeding and migration tendencies, and feeding behavior of thousands of species. He studied butterfly and bird distributions in comparison to the presence or absence of geographical barriers. His observations led him to conclude that the number of organisms present in a community was dependent on the amount of food resources in the particular habitat.&lt;ref name=Browne /&gt; Wallace believed species were dynamic by responding to biotic and abiotic factors. He and Philip Sclater saw biogeography as a source of support for the theory of [[evolution]] as they used Darwin's conclusion to explain how biogeography was similar to a record of species inheritance.&lt;ref name =Browne /&gt; Key findings, such as the sharp difference in fauna either side of the [[Wallace Line]], and the sharp difference that existed between North and [[South America]] prior to their relatively recent [[Great American Interchange|faunal interchange]], can only be understood in this light. Otherwise, the field of biogeography would be seen as a purely descriptive one.&lt;ref name =Cox /&gt;

===20th and 21st century===
[[File:Wegener fossils-mapped.png|thumb|350px|Distribution of four Permian and Triassic fossil groups used as biogeographic evidence for continental
drift, and land bridging]]
Moving on to the 20th century, [[Alfred Wegener]] introduced the Theory of [[Continental Drift]] in 1912, though it was not widely accepted until the 1960s.&lt;ref name =Cox /&gt; This theory was revolutionary because it changed the way that everyone thought about species and their distribution around the globe. The theory explained how continents were formerly joined together in one large landmass, [[Pangea]], and slowly drifted apart due to the movement of the plates below Earth's surface. The evidence for this theory is in the geological similarities between varying locations around the globe, fossil comparisons from different continents, and the jigsaw puzzle shape of the landmasses on Earth. Though Wegener did not know the mechanism of this concept of Continental Drift, this contribution to the study of biogeography was significant in the way that it shed light on the importance of environmental and geographic similarities or differences as a result of climate and other pressures on the planet. Importantly, late in his career Wegener recognised that testing his theory required measurement of continental movement rather than inference from fossils species distributions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118786352.wbieg0638/abstract|title=International Encyclopedia of Geography: People, the Earth, Environment and Technology|last=Trewick|first=Steve|date=2016|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|isbn=9781118786352|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781118786352.wbieg0638}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The publication of ''[[The Theory of Island Biogeography]]'' by [[Robert MacArthur]] and [[Edward Osborne Wilson|E.O. Wilson]] in 1967&lt;ref&gt;This work expanded their 1963 paper on the same topic.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the species richness of an area could be predicted in terms of such factors as habitat area, immigration rate and extinction rate. This added to the long-standing interest in [[island biogeography]]. The application of island biogeography theory to [[habitat fragmentation|habitat fragments]] spurred the development of the fields of [[conservation biology]] and [[landscape ecology]].&lt;ref&gt;This applies to British and American academics; landscape ecology has a distinct genesis among European academics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Classic biogeography has been expanded by the development of [[molecular systematics]], creating a new discipline known as [[phylogeography]]. This development allowed scientists to test theories about the origin and dispersal of populations, such as [[endemic (ecology)|island endemics]]. For example, while classic biogeographers were able to speculate about the origins of species in the [[Hawaiian Islands]], phylogeography allows them to test theories of relatedness between these populations and putative source populations in [[Asia]] and [[North America]].&lt;ref name= "MacArthur"&gt;MacArthur R.H.; Wilson E.O. 1967. The theory of island biogeography.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biogeography continues as a point of study for many life sciences and geography students worldwide, however it may be under different broader titles within institutions such as ecology or evolutionary biology.

In recent years, one of the most important and consequential developments in biogeography has been to show how multiple organisms, including mammals like monkeys and reptiles like lizards, overcame barriers such as large oceans that many biogeographers formerly believed were impossible to cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Monkey's Voyage: How Improbable Journeys Shaped the History of Life |last=Queiroz, de |first=Alan |year=2014 |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-465-02051-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Oceanic dispersal]].

==Modern applications==
Biogeography now incorporates many different fields including but not limited to physical geography, geology, botany and plant biology, zoology, and general biology. A biogeographer's main focus is on what environmental factors and what the influence of humans do to the distribution of the specific species of study. In terms of applications of biogeography as a science today, technological advances have allowed satellite imaging and processing of the Earth.&lt;ref name="Watts"&gt;The New Biogeography and its Niche in Physical Geography. D. WATTS Geography, Vol. 63, No. 4, ANNUAL CONFERENCE 1978 (November 1978), pp. 324–337&lt;/ref&gt; Two main types of satellite imaging that are important within modern biogeography are Global Production Efficiency Model (GLO-PEM) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). GLO-PEM uses satellite-imaging gives "repetitive, spatially contiguous, and time specific observations of vegetation". These observations are on a global scale.&lt;ref name="Prince"&gt;Stephen D. Prince and Samuel N. Goward. "Global Primary Production: A Remote Sensing Approach"  ''Journal of Biogeography'', Vol. 22, No. 4/5, Terrestrial Ecosystem Interactions with Global Change, Volume 2 (Jul. – Sep., 1995), pp. 815–835&lt;/ref&gt;  GIS can show certain processes on the earth’s surface like whale locations, sea surface temperatures, and bathymetry.&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;"Remote Sensing Data and Information." Remote Sensing Data and Information. {{cite web |url=http://rsd.gsfc.nasa.gov/rsd/RemoteSensing.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427035513/http://rsd.gsfc.nasa.gov/rsd/RemoteSensing.html |archivedate=2014-04-27 |df= }} (accessed April 28, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Current scientists also use coral reefs to delve into the history of biogeography through the fossilized reefs.

==Paleobiogeography==
Paleobiogeography goes one step further to include [[paleogeography|paleogeographic]] data and considerations of [[plate tectonics]]. Using molecular analyses and corroborated by [[fossils]], it has been possible to demonstrate that [[perching birds]] evolved first in the region of [[Australia]] or the adjacent [[Antarctic]] (which at that time lay somewhat further north and had a temperate climate). From there, they spread to the other [[Gondwana]]n continents and Southeast Asia&amp;nbsp;– the part of [[Laurasia]] then closest to their origin of dispersal&amp;nbsp;– in the late [[Paleogene]], before achieving a global distribution in the early [[Neogene]].&lt;ref&gt;Jønsson, Knud A. &amp; Fjeldså, Jon (2006). Determining biogeographical patterns of dispersal and diversification in oscine passerine birds in Australia, Southeast Asia and Africa. ''[[Journal of Biogeography]]'' '''33'''(7): 1155–1165. {{DOI|10.1111/j.1365-2699.2006.01507.x}} (HTML abstract)&lt;/ref&gt; Not knowing that at the time of dispersal, the Indian Ocean was much narrower than it is today, and that South America was closer to the Antarctic, one would be hard pressed to explain the presence of many "ancient" lineages of perching birds in Africa, as well as the mainly South American distribution of the [[suboscine]]s.

Paleobiogeography also helps constrain hypotheses on the timing of biogeographic events such as [[vicariance]] and [[geodispersal]], and provides unique information on the formation of regional biotas.  For example, data from species-level phylogenetic and biogeographic studies tell us that the [[Amazon Basin|Amazonian]] fish fauna accumulated in increments over a period of tens of millions of years, principally by means of allopatric speciation, and in an arena extending over most of the area of tropical South America (Albert &amp; Reis 2011). In other words, unlike some of the well-known insular faunas ([[Galapagos finches]], Hawaiian drosophilid flies, African rift lake [[cichlids]]), the species-rich Amazonian ichthyofauna is not the result of recent [[adaptive radiation]]s.&lt;ref name="Lovejoy, N. R. 2010 Pp. 405-417"&gt;Lovejoy, N. R., S. C. Willis, &amp; J. S. Albert (2010) Molecular signatures of [[Neogene]] biogeographic events in the Amazon fish fauna. Pp. 405–417 in ''Amazonia, Landscape and Species Evolution'', 1st edition (Hoorn, C. M. and Wesselingh, F.P., eds.). London: Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[freshwater]] organisms, landscapes are divided naturally into discrete [[drainage basin]]s by [[Drainage divide|watersheds]], episodically isolated and reunited by [[erosion]]al processes. In regions like the [[Amazon Basin]] (or more generally Greater Amazonia, the Amazon basin, [[Orinoco]] basin, and [[Guianas]]) with an exceptionally low (flat) topographic relief, the many waterways have had a highly reticulated history over [[geological time]]. In such a context, [[stream capture]] is an important factor affecting the evolution and distribution of freshwater organisms. Stream capture occurs when an upstream portion of one river drainage is diverted to the downstream portion of an adjacent basin. This can happen as a result of [[tectonic uplift]] (or [[subsidence]]), natural damming created by a [[landslide]], or headward or lateral [[erosion]] of the watershed between adjacent basins.&lt;ref name="Lovejoy, N. R. 2010 Pp. 405-417"/&gt;

==Concepts and fields==
Biogeography is a synthetic science, related to [[geography]], [[biology]], [[soil science]], [[geology]], [[climatology]], [[ecology]] and [[evolution]].

Some fundamental concepts in biogeography include:
* [[allopatric speciation]]&amp;nbsp;– the splitting of a species by evolution of geographically isolated populations
* [[evolution]]&amp;nbsp;– change in genetic composition of a population
* [[extinction]]&amp;nbsp;– disappearance of a species
* [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]]&amp;nbsp;– movement of populations away from their point of origin, related to [[Animal migration|migration]]
* [[endemism|endemic]] areas
* [[geodispersal]]&amp;nbsp;– the erosion of barriers to [[wikt:biotic|biotic]] dispersal and gene flow, that permit range expansion and the merging of previously isolated [[biota (ecology)|biotas]]
* [[range (biology)|range]] and [[Population distribution|distribution]]
* [[vicariance]]&amp;nbsp;– the formation of barriers to biotic dispersal and gene flow, that tend to subdivide species and biotas, leading to speciation and extinction; [[vicariance biogeography]] is the field that studies these patterns

===Comparative biogeography===
The study of comparative biogeography can follow two main lines of investigation:&lt;ref&gt;Lynne R. Parenti, Malte C. Ebach: [https://books.google.com/books?id=K1GU_1I6bG4C Comparative Biogeography: Discovering and Classifying Biogeographical Patterns of a Dynamic Earth], Introduction, page 9&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Systematic biogeography]], the study of biotic area relationships, their distribution, and hierarchical classification
* [[Evolutionary biogeography]], the proposal of evolutionary mechanisms responsible for organismal distributions. Possible mechanisms include widespread taxa disrupted by continental break-up or individual episodes of long-distance movement.

==Biogeographic regionalisations==
There are many types of biogeographic units used in biogeographic [[regionalisation]] schemes,&lt;ref&gt;Calow, P. (1998). ''The Encyclopedia of Ecology and Environmental Management.'' Oxford: Blackwell Science, p. 82, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JKTeiqPBpM4C&amp;pg=PA82].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walter, B. M. T. (2006). ''Fitofisionomias do bioma Cerrado: síntese terminológica e relações florísticas''. Doctoral dissertation, Universidade de Brasília, p. 200, {{cite web |url=http://www.pgecl.unb.br/images/sampledata/arquivos/teses/2000a2010/2006/Bruno%20M.T.%20Walter.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826132951/http://www.pgecl.unb.br/images/sampledata/arquivos/teses/2000a2010/2006/Bruno%20M.T.%20Walter.pdf |archivedate=2016-08-26 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vilhena, D., Antonelli, A. (2015). A network approach for identifying and delimiting biogeographical regions. ''Nature Communications'' 6, 6848, {{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms7848 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008211610/http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms7848 |archivedate=2016-10-08 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; as there are many criteria (species composition, [[physiognomy]], ecological aspects) and hierarchization schemes: [[biogeographic realm]]s (or [[ecozone]]s), [[bioregion]]s (''sensu stricto''), [[ecoregion]]s, [[zoogeographical region]]s, [[floristic region]]s, [[vegetation]] types, [[biome]]s, etc.

The terms biogeographic unit,&lt;ref&gt;Calow, 1998{{what|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; biogeographic area&lt;ref&gt;Ebach et al., 2008&lt;/ref&gt; or [[bioregion]] ''sensu lato'',&lt;ref&gt;Vilhena &amp; Antonelli, 2015{{what|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be used for these categories, regardless of rank.

Recently, an [[International Code of Area Nomenclature]] was proposed for biogeography.&lt;ref&gt;Ebach, M.C., Morrone, J.J. Parenti, L.R. &amp; Viloria Á.L. (2008). International Code of Area Nomenclature. ''Journal of Biogeography'' 35 (7): 1153–1157,[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2008.01920.x/pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morrone, J. J. (2015). Biogeographical regionalisation of the world: a reappraisal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3303">The '''Bishop of Bermuda''' is an [[Episcopal polity|episcopal]] title given to the [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]] of the [[Anglican Church of Bermuda]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglicancommunion.org/tour/diocese.cfm?Idind=756 Anglican Communion]&lt;/ref&gt; one of six [[extra-provincial Anglican churches]] within the  [[Church of England]] overseen by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. The present Bishop is [[Nick Dill]].

From the date of official colonisation in 1612 (three years after Bermuda had been settled by the wreck of the [[Sea Venture]], the survivors of which included the Reverend Richard Buck, who carried out the first Church of England services in Bermuda) until 1825, the nine parishes of the Church of England in [[Bermuda]] had rarely enough ministers, and there was no local Bishop. From 1825 to 1839, Bermuda was attached to the [[Diocese of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island]]. The Synod of the Church of England in Bermuda was formed in 1879, and a Diocese of Bermuda became separate from the [[Diocese of Newfoundland]], but they continued to be grouped under the ''Bishop of Newfoundland and Bermuda'' until 1919, when Newfoundland and Bermuda each received its own Bishop.

The '''Denmark Strait cataract''' is an underwater [[waterfall]] found on the western side of the [[Denmark Strait]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It is the world's highest underwater waterfall, with water falling almost 3,505 metres (11,500 feet).

It is formed by the temperature differential between the water masses either side of the Denmark Strait, the eastern side being much colder than the western. Due to the different densities in the masses caused by this temperature difference, when the two masses meet along the top ridge of the strait, the colder, denser water flows downwards and underneath the warmer, lighter water, thus creating a downward flow of water, or waterfall.

It is thought that the Denmark Strait cataract has a flow rate exceeding 175 million cubic feet (5.0 million cubic meters)&lt;!--{{convert|175|cuft|m3}}--&gt; per second, making it 350 times as voluminous as the extinct [[Guaíra Falls]] on the border of [[Brazil]] and [[Paraguay]], which was once thought to be the most voluminous waterfall on Earth, which was 12 times more voluminous than [[Victoria Falls, Zambia|Victoria Falls]].

The waterfall was jokingly called The [[Alan Davies]] Cascade, after the regular panelist on the television quiz show ''[[QI]]'', in response to host [[Stephen Fry]]'s mentioning its apparent lack of a name.

'''Hancock Seamount''' is a [[seamount]] of the [[Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]].

It was formed in the [[Eocene]] and [[Oligocene]] epochs of the [[Paleogene|Paleogene Period]].  The last eruption from Hancock Seamount is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volcanolive.com/hancock.html Handcock Seamount - John Search]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Illustrated Treatise on the Maritime Kingdoms''''', or '''''Haiguo Tuzhi''''', is a 19th-century Chinese [[gazetteer]] compiled by [[scholar-official]] [[Wei Yuan]] and others, based on initial translations ordered by [[Imperial Commissioner (China)|Special Imperial Commissioner]] [[Lin Zexu]]. The ''Treatise'' is regarded as the first significant Chinese work on the West{{sfn|Hao|Wang|1980|p=148}} and one of China's initial responses to the Anglo-Chinese [[First Opium War]] (1839{{ndash}}1842).{{sfn|Leonard|1984|p=93}} Eventually stretching to one hundred ''juan'', or scrolls, the treatise contains numerous maps and much geographical detail covering both the western and eastern hemispheres. Wei's book also garnered significant interest in Japan and helped mould the country's foreign policy with respect to the West.

== Background ==
During his term in Canton (now [[Guangzhou]]) as Special Imperial Commissioner, Lin Zexu observed the might of British naval power and the inadequacies of the Chinese coastal defence system at first hand. Along with other intellectuals of the time, Lin's objective was "to determine the source and nature of Western power in Asia and to discover Western objectives in East Asia."{{sfn|Leonard|1984|p=97}} The commissioner hired four Chinese translators who had been trained by missionaries to assist with the task of obtaining and translating appropriate western texts. One of them, Liang Jinde ({{lang|zh-hant|梁進得}}), an assistant to missionary [[Elijah Coleman Bridgman]], provided copies of ''[[The Chinese Repository]]'' and other works.{{sfn|Lutz|2008|p=202}} Lin also purchased a copy of the 1834 ''Encyclopedia of Geography'' by Hugh Murray from the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]], which Liang  translated to become the draft for Lin's own ''Geography of the Four Continents'' ({{lang|zh-hans|四洲志}}). However, before the book could be published, the [[First Opium War]] broke out in 1839 and the project was shelved. When the war ended in 1842, Lin's exile to the remote northwestern city of [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture|Yili]] meant that he passed his draft manuscript to Wei Yuan with a request that he complete it. Lin's contributions to the treatise proved so important that [[Karl Gützlaff]] mistakenly attributed the work to him in his September 1847 review for the ''Chinese Repository''.{{sfn|Lutz|2008|loc=203, citing the ''Chinese Repository'' Vol. XVI, September 1847 pp. 417{{ndash}}24}}

== Content ==

As well as mapping various countries, Wei's objective was to provide as complete a picture as possible of the advantages they possessed in shipbuilding techniques and weapons production so that these "might be turned to use for subduing them."{{sfn|Hao|Wang|1980|p=148}} Wei completed his investigations of western penetration into East Asia in 1841,{{sfn|Leonard|1984|p=98}} and in the Treatise proposed the construction of a shipyard and arsenal at Canton and the employment of foreign engineers to teach marine navigation and weapons operation {{ndash}}"pioneer ideas in the military history of modern China".{{sfn|Hao|Wang|1980|p=149}}

== Structure and editions ==
&lt;Blockquote&gt; "[It] divides the whole into eighteen parts, which are set forth in classical and somewhat obscure language. The 1st section enjoins the necessity of taking advantage of barbarian power and inventions, to resist the barbarians and to be on a proper footing with them. This may be said to be the grand object of the book, which then proceeds to give a geographical and historical account of all the nations in Europe, Asia, Africa and America. The closing chapters direct attention to the superiority of barbarians in their method of circulating news, ship-building, and gunnery; and are filled with woodcuts representing things and processes &amp;c. Amongst barbarians, the English occupy a prominent place."
::::: —''[[The Chinese Repository]]'' Volume XIX January–December, 1850; p. 135&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first edition of the ''Illustrated Treatise on the Maritime Kingdoms'', comprising 50 ''juan'' or scrolls, was published on January{{nbsp}}3 1843.{{sfn|Leonard|1984|p=98}} This was followed in 1847 with a reorganised and slightly longer version running to 60 ''juan'', while the third and final edition of 100 ''juan'' appeared in 1852. As the editions progressed, each in turn featured new maps and geographical information regarding the West, using material that became available after the First Opium War.{{sfn|Leonard|1984|p=98}}

== Impact ==
[[File:The England map of Haiguotuzhi.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Map of England from the ''Hǎiguótúzhì'']]
Although on publication the Treatise received scant attention in China,{{Cref2|A}} in the longer term, Wei and his contemporaries helped change the Chinese view of the outside world not only through the dissemination of new material but also by starting to change the view that China was the "center of civilization" or "center of the world" ("Middle Kingdom").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hao|Wang|1980|p=148|}} "...dissolve the Sinocentric view by showing that China was in reality not the 'Middle Kingdom'"&lt;/ref&gt;

Wei's work was also to have a later impact on Japanese foreign policy. In 1862, [[samurai]] [[Takasugi Shinsaku]], from the ruling Japanese [[Tokugawa shogunate]], visited [[Shanghai]] on board the trade ship ''Senzaimaru''.{{sfn|Masuda|2013|p=21}} Japan had been forced open by US Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry]] less than a decade earlier and the purpose of the mission was to establish how China had fared following the country's defeat in the [[Second Opium War]] (1856{{ndash}}1860). Takasugi was aware of the forward thinking exhibited by those such as Wei on the new threats posed by Western "barbarians"{{sfn|Fong|Qian|Zurndorfer|2004|p=7}} and later recorded in his diary: "The philosophy of the Chinese people stands poles apart from the correct path for China's future development. They are infatuated with lofty words unrelated to reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://history.people.com.cn/n/2014/0116/c372326-24139679.html | title = 甲午战争中国战败 西方国家为何反而同情日本?

Fogel|Joshua Fogel]] concludes that when Takasugi found out "that the writings of Wei Yuan were out of print in China and that the Chinese were not forcefully preparing to drive the foreigners out of their country, rather than derive from this a long analysis of the failures of the Chinese people, he extracted lessons for the future of Japan".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.chinajapan.org/articles/01.2/01.2.41-56ichiko.pdf | title = Chinese and Japanese Studies of Early Sino-Japanese Contacts in the Modern Era | last = Fogel | first = Joshua A. | author-link = Joshua A. Fogel | page = 6 | publisher = Sino-Japanese Studies | accessdate = 7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, after reading the Treatise, scholar and political reformer [[Yokoi Shōnan]] became convinced that Japan should embark on a "cautious, gradual and realistic opening of its borders to the Western world" and thereby avoid the mistake China had made in engaging in the First Opium War.{{sfn|Shogimen|Spencer|2014|loc=Chapter 5: A Historical Reflection on Peace and Public Philosophy in Japanese Thought: Prince Shotoku, Ito Jinsai and Yokoi Shonan}} Takasugi would later emerge as a leader of the 1868 [[Meiji Restoration]]{{sfn|Satoshi|2009|p=86}} which presaged the emergence of Japan as a modernised nation at the beginning of the 20th century. [[Yoshida Shōin]], influential Japanese intellectual and Meiji reformer, said Wei's Treatise had "made a big impact in our country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Sino-Japanese Studies | title = Shifts in the "Informationally Advanced Nations" | year = 2009 | volume = 16 | last = Liu | first = Jianhui | url = http://chinajapan.org/articles/index.php/sjs/article/viewFile/6/7 | at =p. 72, citing the ''Collected writings of Yoshida Shōin'' (Tokyo: Daiwa Shōbo, 1976), vol. 2.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cnote2|A|In September 1847, the ''[[Chinese Repository]]'' observed: "We have never heard of this work in the bookshops of Canton and have only seen an advanced review copy. ...

'''Jean-Paul Rodrigue''' (born July 20, 1967) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] scholar of [[transportation geography]]. He has a PhD in transport geography from the [[Université de Montréal]] (1994) and has been part of the Department of Global Studies and Geography&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hofstra.edu/Academics/Colleges/HCLAS/GEOG/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Hofstra University]] in [[Hempstead, New York]], since 1999. His work, ''{{lang|fr|L'espace économique mondial: les économies avancées et la mondialisation}}'', (''The Global Economic Space: Advanced Economies and Globalization'') won the [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] "Best Business Book" award in 2000.

[[File:Stages of a bubble.png|thumb|Rodrigue's "phases of a bubble" chart]]
More recently, in 2008, Rodrigue achieved notability with his model of [[economic bubble]]s, charting four "phases of a bubble". While the "smart money" has purchased during the earlier "stealth phase", institutional investors begin to buy  during "take off". Following media coverage, the general public begins to invest leading to steep rise in prices as "enthusiasm" and then "greed" kick in. "Delusion" precedes the peak.&lt;ref&gt;Keenan, Mark. ''A bubble under the microscope'', [[Sunday Times]] 26 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The chart was widely syndicated during the [[late-2000s financial crisis]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

'''Kjelfossen''' ({{lang-en|Kjell Falls}}) is one of the highest [[waterfall]]s in [[Norway]].  The falls are located near the village of [[Gudvangen]] in the municipality of [[Aurland]] in [[Sogn og Fjordane]] county.  With a total fall height of {{convert|755|m}}, the waterfall is listed as the 18th tallest waterfall in the world.  The tallest single drop is {{convert|149|m}}{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}.  The height of the waterfall has never been accurately measured, so there are discrepancies in its actual height.  Some sources list it as {{convert|840|m}} tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssb.no/en/yearbook/geography.html|title=Statistical Yearbook of Norway 2009|publisher=[[Statistics Norway]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wwdb"&gt;{{wwdb name|id=54|name=Kjelfossen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest of the three (the one on the left) is officially named ''Kjelfossen'', but is also known as ''Stor Kjelfossen''. The middle falls is known as ''Vetle Kjelfoss'', and the one on the right (and the smallest by volume) is thought to be unnamed.&lt;ref name="wwdb" /&gt;  The falls are located just east of [[Gudvangen]] at the end of the [[Nærøyfjord]].  The falls can be seen from the {{europavei|16}} highway, just west of the entrance into the [[Gudvanga Tunnel]].  The falls are located about {{convert|18|km}} west of [[Flåm]] and {{convert|27|km}} west of [[Aurlandsvangen]].

{{History of Indonesia}}
'''Kutai''' is a historic region in [[East Kalimantan]] in [[Indonesia]] on the island of [[Borneo]] and is also the name of the native ethnic of the region, numbering around 300,000 who have their own language of the same name and their own rich history. Today the name is preserved in the names of three regencies in East Kalimantan, the [[Kutai Kartanegara Regency]], the [[West Kutai Regency]] and the [[East Kutai Regency]]. The major river of the region is the [[Mahakam River]].

== History ==
The history is usually divided into two periods, that of the early Kutai Martadipura phase some time around 350–400 and the later Kutai Kartanegara phase beginning around 1300. The first period produced the earliest known inscriptions in [[Indonesia]].

=== Kutai Martadipura ===
[[Image:kutai Prasasti of Mulawarman.JPG|frame|right|An ancient yūpa of Mulawarman, king of Kutai]]
[[Image:Prasasti-Yupa02.jpg|250px|thumb|left|A Yupa with inscription in the National Museum of Indonesia in Jakarta]]
Kutai Martadipura is a 4th-century [[Greater India#Indianised kingdoms|Indianized kingdom]] located in the Kutai area, East Kalimantan.&lt;ref name=Coedes&gt;{{cite book|last= Coedès|first= George|authorlink= George Coedès|editor= Walter F.

Seven stone pillars, or yūpa (“sacrificial posts”), have been found in Kutai, Kaman Estuary, near the [[Mahakam River]].&lt;ref name="melayuonline"&gt;[http://history.melayuonline.com/?a=Sm0vaUpTL0lMeTRVYzY%3D=&amp;l=kutai-kingdom Kutai Kingdom] on Melayu Online&lt;/ref&gt; The plinths bear an inscription in the [[Pallava script]] of India reading "A gift to the [[Brahmin]] [[priest]]s". The style of the script has been dated to the last half the 4th century.&lt;ref name="earlykutai"&gt;[http://epress.anu.edu.au/austronesians/austronesians/mobile_devices/ch15s02.html The Earliest Indic State: Kutai]&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed these religions were brought to Indonesia around the 2nd and 4th centuries, respectively, when Indian traders arrived on the islands of [[Sumatra]], [[Java]] and [[Sulawesi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Period of Hindu Kingdoms | publisher = Embassy of Republic of Indonesia at Bangkok, Thailand | year = 2006 | url = http://www.kbri-bangkok.com/about_indonesia/history_02.html | accessdate = 17 October 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061107080534/http://www.kbri-bangkok.com/about_indonesia/history_02.html | archivedate = 7 November 2006 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The names of three rulers are known from the inscriptions. The first ruler mentioned is [[Kudungga|Kuḍungga]], the “lord of men” (narendra), his son Aśwawarman, styled the “founder of the dynasty” (vaṇśa-kartṛ) and grandson of the first and son of the later, [[Mulavarman]] called the “lord of kings” (rājendra). As Kuṇḍungga does not seem to be a name of Sanskrit hinduistic style while the other two are, it is presumed he was a leader of local origin ( Dayak People ) and it was his son Aśwawarman that adopted the hinduistic belief.&lt;ref name="earlykutai"/&gt; It was Mūlawarman who let these inscriptions be made. While nothing of the military actions of his two predecessors is known, ''"Raja"'' Mūlawarman is stated to have conquered his neighbours in battle. He is also said to have increased the land of Kutai by a local ritual called "asvaredjwa". This ritual required a horse released to his land. The footsteps of the freely roaming horse were taken as evidence that this land belonged to Kutai. Mulawarman was also known for his tribute of gold to his God. The name of his kingdom is not mentioned on the inscriptions nor do any other documents in other countries relate to a kingdom at this time in this region. It is not known what became of the kingdom after these pillars had been erected. It may be possible that the name Kutai, as in Tuñjung Kute of the 1365 Javanese [[Majapahit]] poem [[Nagarakretagama|Nāgarakṛtāgama]] is as ancient and reflects the original name used a thousand years earlier.

Two Hindu nations were known to have had strong trade relations with Kutai, namely, the [[Rajahnate of Cebu]] and the [[Rajahnate of Butuan]], both are located in present-day [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;Coedès, George (1968).

=== Kutai Kartanegara Sultanate ===
Around the end of the 13th century the kingdom of Kutai Kartanegara was established in the region of Tepian Batu or Kutai Lama. The first known ruler is Aji Batara Agung Dewa Sakti, who is thought to have ruled from 1300 to 1325.&lt;ref name="melayuonline"/&gt; Aji Pangeran Sinum Panji Mendapa, who ruled 1635–1650, was able to conquer the kingdom of Kutai Martadipura and merged the two realms thus Kutai Kartanegara Ing Martadipura.&lt;ref name="melayuonline"/&gt;

In 1667 the Dutch [[Dutch East India Company|V.O.C.]] attacked [[Makassar]] on the island of [[Sulawesi]] leading to the downfall of the [[Bugis]] Kingdom of [[Gowa]]. Some of the Bugis under the leadership of Lamohang Daeng Mangkona or Pua Ado I immigrated to Kutai on neighbouring Borneo (Kalimantan) and the ruler of Kutai allowed them to settle in Kampung Melantai around the Karang Mumus River, now known as Kampung Selili. This settlement eventually developed into the modern town of [[Samarinda]].

[[Islam]] took hold in the region since the 17th century (most of the Bugis were Muslims) and Aji Muhammad Idris, ruling 1732–1739?, was the first ruler to have an Islamic name.

After a civil war Aji Imbut, after finally becoming the ruler as Aji Muhammad Muslihuddin in 1780, moved the capital in 1782 from Pemarangan to Tepian Pandan.&lt;ref name="melayuonline"/&gt; The name of the capital city eventually developed from Tangga Arung to its present form of [[Tenggarong]].

In 1844 the Dutch defeated the Sultan Aji Muhammad Salehudin, forcing him into exile, and took direct control of Kutai.

The [[Japan]]ese invaded the region in 1942 and acknowledged a "Kooti Kingdom", that was a subject of the [[Tenno]]. In 1945 Kutai joined, along with its neighbours, into the East Kalimantan federation.

In 1949 Kutai finally became part of the United Republic of Indonesia.

== The Kutai Language ==
The traditional language of the region is referred to as [[Kutai Language|Tanggarong Kutai ]] and is considered a [[Malayic languages|local ethnic language]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=91217 Ethnologue] report for Local Malay&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joshuaproject.net/peopctry.php?rop3=106159&amp;rog3=ID The Tenggarong Kutai] in the Joshua Project&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Banjar language|Banjarese]] to the south, [[Kota Bangun Kutainese]] to the west, [[Berau language|Berau]] to the north and others more distant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_map.asp?name=IDK&amp;seq=40 Language Map] on www.ethnologue.com&lt;/ref&gt; As such Tanggarong Kutai belongs to the large [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian family]] of languages.

This is a '''list of Bohemian monarchs''' now also referred to as '''list of Czech monarchs''' who ruled as Dukes and Kings of '''Bohemia'''. The [[Duchy of Bohemia]] was established in 870 and raised to the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] in [[Golden Bull of Sicily|1212]] (although several Bohemian monarchs ruled as non-hereditary Kings of Bohemia beforehand, first gaining the title in 1085). From 1004 to 1806, Bohemia was part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and its ruler was an [[Prince-elector|elector]]. During 1526–1804 the Kingdom of Bohemia, together with the other [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|lands of the Bohemian Crown]], had been ruled under a [[personal union]] as part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. From 1804 to 1918, Bohemia had been part of the [[Empire of Austria]], which itself had been part of the [[Dual monarchy|dual monarchy]] of [[Austria-Hungary]] from [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|1867]] to 1918. Following the [[Dissolution of Austria-Hungary|dissolution of the monarchy]], the Bohemian lands, now also referred to as [[Czech lands]], became part of [[Czechoslovakia]], and form today's [[Czech Republic]] (Czechia) since [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|1993]].

This is a '''list of Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points'''. Since 1977, [[Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point|Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points]] (abbreviated GSSPs) are internationally agreed upon reference points on [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] sections of rock which define the lower boundaries of [[stage (stratigraphy)|stages]] on the [[geologic time scale]]. They are selected by the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] based on multiple factors, but their accessibility and the degree to which they are representative of the same boundary on sections worldwide are among the most important.

Since GSSPs require well-preserved sections of rock without interruptions in sedimentation, and since most are defined by different [[faunal stage|stages]] of [[animal]] life, defining them becomes progressively more difficult as one goes further back in time.

== Organization of this list ==
This list is divided first into the geologic eras of the Phanerozoic (the [[Cenozoic]], the [[Mesozoic]], and the [[Paleozoic]]) and then into the geologic periods of each era. Each period is marked below the era bar on top of its subdivided epochs and stages. Each stage is assigned an age in [[Mya (unit)|mya]], an [[acronym]] for million years ago, which is the age at which it began. Most of these ages are derived from astronomical cycles in sediments, magnetic data, [[biostratigraphy|biostratigraphic]] data, and [[radiometric dating]] methods. The GSSP assigned to each stage is that stage's lower boundary and oldest point.

'''Ages''' are given in "million year ago" (mya). They are obtained with different [[radiometric dating]] methods depending on the type of rock and its age. Ages that have a tilde (~) prefix are approximate ages for GSSPs that have not been defined or not been accurately dated.

The Status column has a "golden spike" for every GSSP which has been formally agreed by the ICS. Those without have only candidate sections which have not yet been formally ratified. The clock stands for times that are currently defined only by an age.

The "Defining markers" column lists the evidence in the rock used to define the boundary. (Ideally, these are applicable in rock sections worldwide.) Most of the boundaries rely on the [[fossil record]] (biologic), [[paleomagnetism|paleomagnetic]] data (magnetic), and/or [[climate]] data determined by [[Isotopes of carbon|carbon]] and [[Isotopes of oxygen|oxygen isotopes]].

Claims have been made{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} by party rivals that many of its assets were obtained illegally while the KMT ruled Taiwan under a one-party system. However, in recent years, the party has been hit with many financial and legal difficulties.

The KMT's total assets are said{{By whom|date=March 2010}} to total nearly NT$40 billion but most of the party's capital was tied in enterprise and real estate, and not as cash.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38190">This is a set of lists of '''English personal and place names whose pronunciations are counterintuitive to their spelling''', because the pronunciation does not correspond to the spelling, or because a better known namesake has a markedly different pronunciation. The latter are known as '''heterophonic''' names (the opposite of [[homophone]]s, which are written differently but pronounced the same).

Excluded are the numerous spellings which fail to make the pronunciation obvious without actually being at odds with it: for example, the pronunciation {{IPAc-en|s|k|ə|ˈ|n|ɛ|k|t|ə|d|i}}{{refn|{{OxfordDictionaries.com|accessdate=2016-01-22|Schenectady}}}}{{refn|{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|accessdate=2016-01-22|Schenectady}}}} of ''[[Schenectady]]'' is not immediately obvious, but neither is it counterintuitive.

See [[Help:IPA/English]] for guides to the IPA symbols used, and variations depending on dialect.{{#tag:ref|For towns near the cusp of two dialect regions, both variants are usually heard, and wider still for important cities or even within them. Examples in that article include [[New York City]] and [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]|group= n}}

==Geography==
An [[alluvial plain]] begins north of [[Baghdad]] and extends to the [[Persian Gulf]]. Here the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers lie above the level of the plain in many places, and the whole area is a [[river delta]] interlaced by the channels of the two rivers and by irrigation canals. Intermittent [[lake]]s, fed by the rivers in flood, also characterize southeastern Iraq. A fairly large area ({{convert|15000|km2|mi2|abbr=on|disp=or}}) just above the confluence of the two rivers at [[Al Qurnah]] and extending east of the Tigris beyond the Iranian border is marshland, known as [[Hawr al Hammar]], the result of centuries of flooding and inadequate drainage. Much of it is permanent marsh, but some parts dry out in early winter, and other parts become marshland only in years of great flood.

Because the waters of the Tigris and Euphrates above their confluence are heavily [[silt]]-laden, [[irrigation]] and fairly frequent flooding deposit large quantities of silty loam in much of the delta area. Windborne silt contributes to the total deposit of sediments. It has been estimated that the delta plains are built up at the rate of nearly twenty centimeters in a century. In some areas, major floods lead to the deposit in temporary lakes of as much as thirty centimeters of mud.

The Tigris and Euphrates also carry large quantities of [[salt]]s. These, too, are spread on the land by sometimes excessive irrigation and flooding. A high [[water table]] and poor surface and subsurface drainage tend to concentrate the salts near the surface of the soil. In general, the salinity of the soil increases from Baghdad south to the Persian Gulf and severely limits productivity in the region south of [[Al Amarah]]. The [[salinity]] is reflected in the large lake in central Iraq, southwest of Baghdad, known as [[Bahr al Milh]] (Sea of Salt). There are two other major lakes in the country to the north of Bahr al Milh: [[Buhayrat ath Tharthar]] and [[Buhayrat al Habbaniyah]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4735">[[Image:Mississipi River Delta Cross Section.jpg|thumb|300px|right]]The '''Michoud fault''' is a [[Fault (geology)|geological fault]] that runs through eastern [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/02/AR2006040201009.html Geologic Faults Cause Structures In New Orleans to Sink, Study Says&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Michoud, New Orleans|Michoud]] fault is the subject of extensive scientific inquiry into why [[Louisiana]] is losing vast tracts of land.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/03/31/tech/main1459939.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsurface mapping identified the Michoud fault, on the basis of well cutoffs and seismic surveys.&lt;ref&gt;(Hickey and Sabate, 1972)&lt;/ref&gt;  Sedimentary growth implies that movement along the Michoud fault has been intermittent since [[Oligocene]] time (Bebout and Gutierrez, 1983). A cross section in McBride (1998) shows a high-angle normal fault that was correlated by Dokka (2006) with the Michoud fault. This fault merges with a low-angle [[detachment fault]] at –7&amp;nbsp;km deep that developed along the top of a slightly south-dipping zone of weak [[salt]] and [[shale]]. These structures are considered to be related to a regional south-vergent extensional-contractional complex described by Peel et al. (1995; Fig. 1). Movement of the complex and thus on the Michaud fault reflects gravitational instabilities and down-dip motion during times of high sedimentation (Peel et al., 1995).

The Michoud fault belongs to a class of geologic structures known as  [[growth fault]]s (Mauduit, T., Brun, J. P. 1998).  Growth faults are common geologic structures of regions undergoing high sedimentation rates, such as [[river delta]]s and [[passive margin]]s.  They often develop where weak rock layers (detachments) such as [[salt]], [[anhydrite]], or [[shale]] underlie regions of rapid sedimentation.  These weak zones allow the growing mass of material above them to slide downhill, either continuously or episodically.  These downslope movements will be correspondingly experienced in the headwall region (such as that occupied by the Michoud fault) either as slow (barely perceptible) or rapid (catastrophic) subsidence.  Growth faults are also sometimes called "listric faults", implying that the fault is a concave-upward surface that transforms nearly vertical displacements at the surface into nearly horizontal ones at depth.

The Michoud fault is not unexpected or unusual as a geologic feature of the [[Mississippi River Delta]].  [[Holocene]] faulting and tilting is widely recognized in many world deltas, such as the [[Nile]], the [[Ganges]]-[[Brahmaputra]], the [[Yangtze]], the [[Po River]], and the [[Rhine]].&lt;ref&gt;(Törnqvist et al., 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative minimum wage ratio in Canada is shown in black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=MIN2AVE |title=OECD Statistics |publisher=Stats.oecd.org |date= |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;|upright=.95]]
Under the [[Canadian Constitution]], the responsibility for enacting and enforcing [[labour law]]s, including the [[minimum wage]], rests with the ten [[Provinces of Canada|provinces]] as well as the three [[Territories of Canada|territories]] which have been granted this power by federal legislation. Some provinces allow lower wages to be paid to liquor servers and other gratuity earners or to inexperienced employees.

The [[Government of Canada|federal government]] in past years set its own minimum wage rates for workers in [[Canadian federalism|federal jurisdiction]] industries (railways for example). In 1996, however, the [[Canada Labour Code#Part 3: Employment Standards Act|federal minimum wage]] was re-defined to be the general adult minimum wage rate of the province or territory where the work is performed.&lt;ref name="minwage"/&gt; This means, for example, that a railway company could not legally pay a worker in British Columbia less than C$12.65 per hour regardless of the worker's experience.

==Demographics==

In 2013, 39.8% of minimum wage workers were between the ages of 15 and 19; in 1997, it was 36%. 50.2% of workers in this age group were paid minimum wage in 2013, an increase from 31.5% in 1997. Statistics Canada notes that "youth,  women and persons with a low level of education were the groups most likely to be paid at minimum wage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Galarneau|first1=Diane|last2=Fecteau|first2=Eric|title=The ups and downs of minimum wage|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/75-006-x/2014001/article/14035-eng.htm#a7|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Minimum wage levels by jurisdiction ==

Assuming a 40-hour workweek and 52 paid weeks a year, the annual gross income of an individual earning the lowest minimum wage in Canada is C$22,880 ''(in Nova Scotia)'' and the highest minimum wage is C$31,200 ''(in Alberta)''.&lt;ref name="minwage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://srv116.services.gc.ca/dimt-wid/sm-mw/rpt1.aspx?lang=eng#ftb2-ref |title=Current And Forthcoming Minimum Hourly Wage Rates For Experienced Adult Workers in Canada |publisher=services.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following table lists the hourly minimum wages for adult workers in each [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province and territory]] of Canada. The provinces which have their minimum wages in bold allow for lower wages under circumstances which are described under the "Comments" heading.

== Controversies ==
Critics of the minimum wage, such as the [[Canadian Federation of Independent Business]] and the [[C. D. Howe Institute]], contend that minimum wage laws actually hurt the very people they purport to help by forcing employers to raise prices, reduce staff, or close down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Marchand |first1=Joseph |title=Thinking about Minimum Wage Increases in Alberta: Theoretically, Empirically, and Regionally |url=https://www.cdhowe.org/public-policy-research/thinking-about-minimum-wage-increases-alberta-theoretically-empirically-and-regionally |publisher=CD Howe Institute |accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another critic of minimum wage increases, University of Laval economics professor Stephen Gordon, has argued that the poverty-reducing impacts of the minimum wage are overstated. In his National Post article Gordon writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The case for increasing the minimum wage has problems in both dimensions: the losses in total income are typically underestimated (when they are not being dismissed out of hand) and the putative reductions in income inequality are almost certainly being overstated. Let’s examine total incomes first. Labour demand curves slope down: everything else being equal, higher wages reduce the quantity of labour employers demand. And fewer people with jobs means less total income. If the theoretical point is clear — and I’m not aware of a compelling theoretical argument suggesting that employers will react to higher minimum wage by hiring more workers — the empirical evidence is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalpost.com/opinion/stephen-gordon-the-high-cost-of-minimum-wage|title=The high cost of minimum wage|author= Stephen Gordon|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other Canadian economists have supported minimum wage increases. David Green, a professor and director at the Vancouver School of Economics, has conducted extensive research on the minimum wage’s effects on the economy. In his work entitled “The Case for Increasing Minimum Wage”, Green presents a rebuttal to the critics of the minimum wage stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Claims that increases in the minimum wage will generate huge efficiency costs for the economy and mass unemployment are not credible. While estimates of employment losses from minimum wage increases for teenagers in Canada exist, the estimated effects on adult employment are minimal at best. Those results cannot be translated into big costs for the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/BC%20Office/2015/04/CCPA-BC-Case-for-Incr-Minimum-Wage_0.pdf|title=The Case for Increasing the Minimum Wage|author= David Green|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Mount Kenya''' is the highest mountain in [[Kenya]] and the [[Highest mountain peaks of Africa|second-highest in Africa]], after [[Mount Kilimanjaro|Kilimanjaro]].&lt;ref name=rough_guide/&gt; The highest peaks of the mountain are Batian ({{convert|5199|m|ft|0}}), Nelion ({{convert|5188|m|ft|0}}) and Point Lenana ({{convert|4985|m|ft|0}}). Mount Kenya is located in the former Eastern and central provinces of Kenya, now Meru, Embu, Laikipia, Kirinyaga, Nyeri and Isiolo counties, about {{convert|16.5|km|mi|1}} south of the [[equator]], around {{convert|150|km|mi|0}} north-northeast of the capital [[Nairobi]].&lt;ref name=rough_guide/&gt; Mount Kenya is the source of the name of the [[Kenya|Republic of Kenya]].

Kenya's government has announced a project to discourage animals from straying into small holdings surrounding the Park and devastating crops. The project will see the Park enclosed by an electric fence with five electrified strands and is expected to be completed by 2014. The fence will discharge an electric shock, but is not dangerous to humans or animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19517183 |title=Mt Kenya to get electric fence to stop wildlife straying|publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=7 September 2012 |accessdate=11 September 2013|newspaper=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local culture==
[[File:Mount Kenya Population map-en.svg|left|thumb|Mount Kenya is important to all the ethnic communities living around it.]]
The main ethnic groups living around Mount Kenya are [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]], [[Ameru]], [[Embu people|Embu]] and [[Maasai people|Maasai]]. The first three are closely related. They all see the mountain as an important aspect of their cultures. All these cultures arrived in the Mount Kenya area in the last several hundred years.

===Kikuyu===
[[Image:Batian and Nelion in the background cropped.JPG|right|thumb|Several ethnic groups that live around Mount Kenya believe the mountain to be sacred. They used to build their houses facing the mountain, with the doors on the side nearest to it.]]
The [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] live on the southern and western sides of the mountain. They are [[agriculturalist]]s, and make use of the highly fertile volcanic soil on the lower slopes. They believe that God, ''Ngai'' or ''Mwene Nyaga'', lived on Mount Kenya when he came down from the sky.&lt;ref name=facingmtkenya&gt;{{cite book
| last=Kenyatta | first=Jomo | authorlink=Jomo Kenyatta
| title= Facing Mount Kenya | year=1961
| publisher= Secker and Warburg | location=London
| isbn=978-0-435-90219-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that the mountain is Ngai's throne on earth. It is the place where Gĩkũyũ, the father of the tribe, used to meet with God. Thus according to the Kikuyu records, Gĩkũyũ is the first person on Earth to ascend the mountain. 'Mwene Nyaga' in Kikuyu language can also translate as the "Owner of the Striped one" where 'Mwene' translates to 'owner', and 'Nyaga' to Stripes. The snow (in Kikuyu: Ira) caps of the mountain symbolically represent a crown on God's habitation .  'Nyaga' can also translate to 'Ostrich'. In this context, God is seen to be the owner of that very rare bird the Ostrich.

Kikuyu used to build their houses with the doors facing the mountain.&lt;ref name=guide/&gt;  The Kikuyu name for Mount Kenya is ''Kĩrĩ Nyaga'' (Kirinyaga), which literally translates to that which has the "Nyaga" – Stripes.The mountain therefore is locally accepted as 'God's Resting Place' or 'Where God Lives'.

===Embu===
The [[Embu people]] live to the south-east of Mount Kenya,&lt;ref name=ecology/&gt; and believe that the mountain is God's home (the Embu word for God is ''Ngai'' or ''Mwene Njeru''). The mountain is sacred, and they build their houses with the doors facing towards it.&lt;ref name=guide/&gt;  The Embu people are closely related to the [[Ameru]] and [[Mbeere]] people. The Mbeere and [[Kamba people|Akamba]] are the settlers of the southeast side of the mountain.

===Ameru===
The [[Ameru]] occupy the east, north and north-western slopes of the mountain. They are generally agricultural and also keep livestock and occupy what is among the most fertile land in Kenya. The Meru god ''Murungu'' was from the skies. Their name for Mt. Kenya is ''Kirimara'', which means 'mountain with white features'.

===Maasai===
[[File:Mount Kenya Region map-en.svg|right|thumb|Mount Kenya lies in the [[Kenya]]n highlands, {{convert|150|km|mi|0}} north northeast of [[Nairobi]], just northeast of [[Nyeri]].&lt;ref name=rough_guide&gt;{{cite map

}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Maasai people|Maasai]] are semi-nomadic people, who use the land to the north of the mountain to graze their cattle. They believe that their ancestors came down from the mountain at the beginning of time.&lt;ref name=guide/&gt;  The Maasai name for Mount Kenya is ''Ol Donyo Keri'', which means 'mountain of stripes', referring to the dark shades as observed from the surrounding plains.&lt;ref name=somjee&gt;{{cite journal

==Geology==
[[Image:FujiSunriseKawaguchiko2025WP.jpg|thumb|Mount Kenya was a [[stratovolcano]] and probably looked similar to [[Mount Fuji|Mt. Fuji]] (shown above). The lower slopes are still this shape, which is how the previous height is estimated.]]

Mount Kenya is a [[stratovolcano]] that was active in the [[Plio-Pleistocene]]. The original crater was probably over {{convert|6000|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} high; higher than [[Kilimanjaro]]. Since it became extinct there have been two major periods of [[glaciation]], which are shown by two main rings of [[moraine]]s below the glaciers. The lowest moraine is found at around {{convert|3300|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=geology/&gt; Today the glaciers reach no lower than {{convert|4650|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=map/&gt; After studying the moraines, Gregory put forward the theory that at one time the whole summit of the mountain was covered with an [[ice cap]], and it was this that [[eroded]] the peaks to how they are today.&lt;ref name=gregory1894&gt;

The lower slopes of the mountain have never been glaciated. They are now mainly cultivated and forested. They are distinguished by steep-sided V-shaped valleys with many tributaries. Higher up the mountain, in the area that is now moorland, the valleys become U-shaped and shallower with flatter bottoms. These were created by glaciation.&lt;ref name=geology/&gt;

When Mount Kenya was [[Volcano#Active|active]] there was some satellite activity. The north-eastern side of the mountain has many old volcanic plugs and craters. The largest of these, Ithanguni, even had its own ice cap when the main peaks were covered in ice. This can be seen by the smoothed summit of the peak. Circular hills with steep sides are also frequent in this area, which are probably the remains of small plugged [[volcanic vent|vent]]s. However, as the remaining mountain is roughly [[Rotational symmetry|symmetrical]], most of the activity must have occurred at the central plug.&lt;ref name=geology/&gt;

The rocks that form Mount Kenya are mainly [[basalt]]s, [[porphyry (geology)|rhomb porphyrites]], [[phonolite]]s, [[kenyte]]s and [[trachyte]]s.&lt;ref name=geology/&gt; Kenyte was first reported by Gregory in 1900 following his study of the geology of Mount Kenya.&lt;ref name=gregory1900&gt;{{cite journal

The [[geology]] of the Mount Kenya area was first proposed to the Western Community by [[Joseph Thomson (explorer)|Joseph Thomson]] in 1883.

[[File: Mount Kenya Summit photomap-en.svg|thumb|left|The main peaks and glaciers of Mount Kenya are near the centre of the mountain.]]
The peaks of Mount Kenya are almost all of a volcanic origin. The majority of the peaks are located near the centre of the mountain. These peaks have an [[Alps|Alpine]] appearance due to their craggy nature. Typically of Alpine terrain, the highest peaks and [[gendarme (mountaineering)|gendarme]]s occur at the intersection of ridges.&lt;ref name=baker/&gt; The central peaks only have a few [[moss]]es, [[lichen]]s and small alpine plants growing in rock crevices.&lt;ref name=ecology/&gt; Further away from the central peaks, the volcanic plugs are covered in [[volcanic ash]] and soils.&lt;ref name=speck&gt;{{cite journal

==Glaciers==
[[Image:MtKenya gletscher.jpg|thumb|The [[Lewis glacier]] is the largest on Mount Kenya]]
The [[glacier]]s on Mount Kenya are retreating rapidly. The Mountain Club of Kenya in Nairobi has photographs showing the mountain when it was first climbed in 1899, and again more recently; the retreat of the glaciers is very evident.&lt;ref name=web&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  Descriptions of ascents of several of the peaks advise on the use of crampons, but this is true only in some cases and at higher heights. Every year there is less new snow accumulating in winter than melting on summer, even on the Lewis Glacier (the largest of them) in winter, so there is no formation of new ice. It is predicted to be less than 30&amp;nbsp;years before there will no longer be ice on Mount Kenya.&lt;ref name=guide/&gt;  Glacial retreat and disappearance can be caused by change in temperature trends, or by change in precipitation trends.&lt;ref name=benn&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;  This is far smaller than the first observations, made in the 1890s.

===Periglacial landforms===
Although Mount Kenya is on the [[equator]] the freezing nightly temperatures result in [[periglacial]] landforms. There is [[permafrost]] a few centimetres (inches) below the surface. [[Patterned ground]] is present at {{convert|3400|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} to the west of Mugi Hill.&lt;ref name=map/&gt;&lt;ref name=baker/&gt; These mounds grow because of the repeated freezing and thawing of the ground drawing in more water. There are [[Periglacial#Landforms associated with periglacial environments|blockfields]] present around {{convert|4000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} where the ground has cracked to form hexagons. Solifluction occurs when the night temperatures freeze the soil before it thaws again in the morning. This daily expansion and contraction of the soil prevents the establishment of vegetation.&lt;ref name=mck/&gt;

==Rivers==
[[File:The gates waterfall mount kenya.jpg|thumb|Runoff from Mount Kenya provides water for over 2 million people.&lt;ref name=development/&gt;]]
Mount Kenya is the main water catchment area for two large rivers in Kenya; the [[Tana River (Kenya)|Tana]], the largest river in Kenya, and the Ewaso Ng'iso North.&lt;ref name=development/&gt; The Mount Kenya ecosystem provides water directly for over 2 million people.&lt;ref name=development/&gt; The rivers on Mount Kenya have been named after the villages on the slopes of the mountain that they flow close to. The Thuchi River is the district boundary between Meru and Embu. Mount Kenya is a major water tower for the Tana river which in 1988 supplied 80% of [[Kenya]]'s electricity using a series of seven hydroelectric powerstations and dams.&lt;ref name="Ojany 1993 305–309"&gt;{{cite journal

The density of streams is very high, especially on the lower slopes which have never been glaciated. The [[ice cap]] which used to cover the mountain during the [[Pliocene]] eroded large [[Valley#Glacial valleys|U-shaped]] valleys which tend to only have one large stream.&lt;ref name=baker/&gt;
Where the original shape of the [[shield volcano]] is still preserved, there have been millions of years for streams to erode the hillside. This area is therefore characterised by frequent deep [[fluvial]] [[Valley#River valleys|V-shaped]] valleys.&lt;ref name=baker_map&gt;{{cite map

Rivers which start on Mount Kenya are the [[tributary|tributaries]] of two large Kenyan rivers: the [[Tana River (Kenya)|Tana]] and the [[Ewaso Ng'iro]] rivers. A lot of Mount Kenyan rivers flow into the [[Sagana River|Sagana]] which itself is a tributary of the Tana, which it joins at the Masinga Reservoir. The rivers in the northern part of the mountain, such as the Burguret, Naru Moru, Nanyuki, Liki, Sirimon flow into the Ewaso Ng'iro. The rivers to the south-west, such as the Keringa and [[Nairobi River|Nairobi]] flow into the Sagana and then into the Tana. The remaining rivers to the south and east, such as the Mutonga, Nithi, Thuchi and Nyamindi, flow directly into the Tana.&lt;ref name=baker_map/&gt;&lt;ref name=mapandguide/&gt;

==Natural history==
{{main|Natural history of Mount Kenya}}

Mount Kenya has several altitudinal ecological zones, between the savanna surrounding the mountain to the nival zone by the glaciers. Each zone has a dominant species of vegetation. Many of the species found higher up the mountain are endemic, either to Mount Kenya or East Africa.&lt;ref name=ecology/&gt;

There are also differences within the zones, depending on the side of the mountain and aspect of the slope. The south-east is much wetter than the north,&lt;ref name=glacierfluctuations/&gt; so species more dependent on moisture are able to grow. Some species, such as bamboo, are limited to certain aspects of the mountain because of the amount of moisture.&lt;ref name=map/&gt;

===Zones===
[[Image:Mount Kenya Vegetation map en.svg|thumb|right|There are distinct vegetation zones around Mount Kenya which vary according to altitude and aspect.]]
The climate of Mount Kenya changes considerably with altitude, forming belts of community types.&lt;ref name=Hedbergzones&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Around the base of the mountain is fertile farmland. The tribes living around the mountain have cultivated this cool relatively moist area for centuries.&lt;ref name=castro/&gt;

Mount Kenya is surrounded by forests. The vegetation in the forests depend on rainfall, and the species present differ greatly between the northern and southern slopes.&lt;ref name=dutton&gt;{{cite book
| last=Dutton | first=E.A.T. | title= Kenya Mountain |year=1929 |publisher=Jonathan Cape
| location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As time has passed the trees on the edge of the forest have been logged and the farmland has encroached further up the fertile slopes of the mountain.&lt;ref name=Hedbergzones/&gt;&lt;ref name=castro/&gt;

Above the forest is a belt of [[bamboo]]. This zone is almost continuous, but is restricted to small isolated bunches in the north because of low rainfall. The bamboo is natural,&lt;ref name=mck/&gt; and does not require forest disturbance. Tracks are common through the bamboo. Bamboo suppresses other vegetation, so it is uncommon to find trees or other plants here.&lt;ref name=map/&gt;

[[Image:Timberline forest with lichens.jpg|thumb|left|The [[tree line|timberline]] forest is commonly in cloud. The trees are relatively small and covered in [[lichen]]s and [[moss]]es.]]
Above the bamboo is the timberline forest. The trees here are often smaller than the trees in the forests lower down the mountain.&lt;ref name=zonation&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The forest here is more intact, because it is less accessible and better protected.

When the trees can no longer grow the vegetation changes into [[heathland]] and [[chaparral]], at around {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Heathland is found in the wetter areas, on the west side of Mount Kenya, and is dominated by giant [[Erica|heather]]s. Chaparral is found in the drier areas and grasses are more common.&lt;ref name=mck/&gt; and bush fires still occur.&lt;ref name=castro/&gt;

As the altitude increases the temperature fluctuations become extreme and the air becomes thinner and drier. This region is known as the [[Afro-alpine]] zone. The environment here is isolated, with the only similar area nearby being the [[Aberdares]], which are {{convert|80|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} away.&lt;ref name=ecology/&gt;  Many of the species here are endemic, with adaptations to the cold and fluctuating temperatures.&lt;ref name=hedberg&gt;{{cite journal

The region where the glaciers have recently retreated from is [[nival zone]]. It is the area that plants have not yet been able to colonise.&lt;ref name=ecology/&gt;

===Flora===
[[Image:Senecio keniodendron2.jpg|thumb|right|Many plants that live on Mount Kenya, like this ''[[Senecio keniodendron]]'', have to be specially adapted to the extremes in temperature.]]
The flora found on Mount Kenya varies with altitude, aspect and exposure.&lt;ref name=tropicalalpine/&gt; As the altitude increases, the plants have to be more specialised, with adaptations to strong sunlight with [[ultraviolet]], lower mean temperatures and freezing night temperatures.&lt;ref name=mck/&gt;&lt;ref name=zonation/&gt;

Plants in the Afro-alpine zone have overcome these difficulties in several ways.&lt;ref name=hedberg/&gt;  One adaptation is known as the giant rosette, which is exhibited by giant senecio, giant lobelia and giant thistle (''[[Carduus]]''), which use bud leaves to protect their buds from freezing. Giant rosette senecios form single-aged stands that drive community structure over decades.&lt;ref name=senecio&gt;{{cite journal

Many plant species in the Afro-alpine zone of Mount Kenya are giant versions of lowland (or temperate) relatives. However, nearer the nival zone the plants decrease in size again.&lt;ref name=ecology/&gt;

===Fauna===
[[File:Safari ants.jpg|right|thumb|[[Safari ants]] swarm around the forest in long columns. They are easiest to see when they cross the tracks.]]
The majority of animals live lower down on the slopes of Mount Kenya. Here there is more vegetation and the climate is less extreme. Various species of monkeys, several antelopes, tree hyrax, porcupines and some larger animals such as elephant and buffalo all live in the forest.&lt;ref name=map/&gt;  Predators found here include hyena and leopard, and occasionally lion.&lt;ref name=map/&gt;

The lower, south eastern slopes are the wettest as the predominant [[weather system]] comes from the [[Indian ocean]]. This rainfall supports dense montane forest on these slopes. High on the mountain most of the [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] falls as [[snow]].&lt;ref name=spink&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; Combined, these water sources feed 11 [[glaciers]].

The current climate on Mount Kenya is wet, but drier than it has been in the past. The temperatures span a wide range, which diminishes with altitude. In the lower alpine zone temperature usually do not go below {{convert|12|C|F|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=rossette&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snow and rain are common from March to December, but especially in the two wet seasons. The wet seasons combined account for 5/6 of the annual precipitation. The [[monsoon]], which controls the wet and dry seasons, means that most of the year there are south-easterly winds, but during January and February the dominant wind direction is north-easterly.

Mount Kenya, like most locations in the tropics, has two wet seasons and two dry seasons as a result of the monsoon. From mid-March to June the heavy rain season, known as the ''long rains'', brings approximately half of the annual rainfall on the mountain.&lt;ref name=castro&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is followed by the wetter of the two dry seasons which lasts until September. October to December are the ''short rains'' when the mountain receives approximately a third of its rainfall total. Finally from December to mid-March is the drier dry season when the mountain experiences the least rain.

===Daily pattern===
During the dry season the mountain almost always follows the same daily weather pattern. Large daily temperature fluctuations occur which led Hedberg to exclaim ''winter every night and summer every day.''&lt;ref name=hedberg1969/&gt; There is variation in minimum and maximum temperatures day to day, but the [[standard deviation]] of the [[mean]] hourly pattern is small.

[[File:Sunrise over Mount Kenya.jpg|thumb|right|In the dry season, mornings are typically clear and cool, but the mountain is hidden in cloud by mid-day.]]
A typical day is clear and cool in the morning with low humidity. The mountain is in direct sunlight which causes the temperatures to rise quickly with the warmest temperatures occurring between 0900 and 1200. This corresponds to a maximum in the pressure, usually around 10 am. Low on the mountain, between {{convert|2400|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|3900|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, clouds begin to form over the western forest zone, due to moist air from [[Lake Victoria]].&lt;ref name="Ojany 1993 305–309"/&gt; The [[anabatic]] winds caused by warm rising air gradually bring these clouds to the summit region in the afternoon. Around 1500 there is a minimum in sunlight and a maximum in humidity causing the actual and perceived temperature to drop. At 1600 there is a minimum in the pressure. This daily cover of cloud protects the glaciers on the south-west of the mountain which would otherwise get direct sun every day, enhancing their melt.&lt;ref name=hastenrath&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The upwelling cloud eventually reaches the dry easterly air streams and dissipates, leading to a clear sky by 5 pm. There is another maximum of temperature associated with this.

Being an equatorial mountain the daylight hours are constant with twelve-hour days. Sunrise is about 0630 with the sun setting at 1830 (both EAT = UTC+3). Over the course of the year there is a one-minute difference between the shortest and longest days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dawnsun.net/astro/suncalc/ |title=Sunset &amp; sunrise calculator (altitude not taken into account)|accessdate=3 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At night, the sky is usually clear with [[katabatic]] winds blowing down the valleys. Above the lower alpine zone there is usually frost every night.&lt;ref name=rossette/&gt;

==History==

===European sighting===
[[File:Joseph Thomson.png|thumb|[[Joseph Thomson (explorer)|Joseph Thomson]] reached the foothills of Mount Kenya and confirmed [[Johann Ludwig Krapf|Krapf]]'s discovery.]]
The first European to report seeing Mount Kenya was [[Johann Ludwig Krapf|Dr Johann Ludwig Krapf]], a German [[missionary]], from [[Kitui]],&lt;ref name=Krapf&gt;{{cite book

a town {{convert|160|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="rough_guide"/&gt; away from the mountain. The sighting was made on 3 December 1849,&lt;ref name="dutton"/&gt;
a year after the discovery of Kilimanjaro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Mackinder |first= Halford |authorlink= Halford Mackinder |year= 1900 |title= A Journey to the Summit of Mount Kenya, British East Africa |journal= [[The Geographical Journal]] |volume= 15 |issue= 5 |pages= 453–476 |jstor= 1774261 |quote= It was the missionary Rebmann of Mombasa who, in 1848, first reported the existence of Kilimanjaro. In the following year his colleague, Krapf, saw Kenya from Kitui, a spot 90 miles south-east of the peak. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krapf was told by people of the [[Embu people|Embu]] tribe that lived around the mountain that they did not ascend high enough on the mountain because of the intense cold and the [[Snow|white matter]] that rolled down the mountains with a loud noise. This led him to infer that glaciers existed on the mountain.&lt;ref name=Krapf/&gt;  It was Krapf who gave the mountain the name "Kenya", but the derivation of this is not known with certainty (see the various local names below, some of which are similar).

[[Image:Samuel Teleki.jpg|thumb|[[Samuel Teleki|Count Samuel Teleki]] was the first European to set foot on Mount Kenya. His expedition reached {{convert|4350|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}.]]
Krapf also noted that the rivers flowing from Mount Kenya, and other mountains in the area, were continuously flowing. This was very different from the other rivers in the area, which swelled up in the wet season and completely dried up after the rainy season had ended. As the streams flowed even in the driest seasons he concluded that there must be a source of water up on the mountain, in the form of glaciers.&lt;ref name=Krapf/&gt; He believed the mountain to be the source of the [[White Nile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 1851 Krapf returned to Kitui. He travelled {{convert|65|km|mi|0}} closer to the mountain, but did not see it again. In 1877 Hildebrandt was in the Kitui area and heard stories about the mountain, but also did not see it. Since there were no confirmations to back up Krapf's claim people began to be suspicious.&lt;ref name="gregory"/&gt;

Eventually, in 1883, [[Joseph Thomson (explorer)|Joseph Thomson]] passed close by the west side of the mountain and confirmed Krapf's claim. He diverted his expedition and reached {{convert|1737|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} up the slopes of the mountain but had to retreat because of trouble with local people.&lt;ref name=thomson/&gt; However, the first European exploration high onto the mountain was achieved in 1887 by [[Samuel Teleki|Count Samuel Teleki]]. He managed to reach {{convert|4350|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} on the south western slopes.&lt;ref name=teleki&gt;{{cite book

In 1892, Teleki and von Höhnel returned to the eastern side, but were unable to get through the forest.&lt;ref name="ecology"/&gt;

Finally, in 1893, an expedition managed to ascend Mount Kenya as far as the glaciers. This expedition was traveling from the coast to [[Lake Baringo]] in the Rift Valley, and was led by [[John Walter Gregory|Dr John W Gregory]], a British [[geologist]]. They managed to ascend the mountain to around {{convert|4730|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}, and spent several hours on the Lewis Glacier with their [[guide]]. On his return to Britain, Gregory published [[Academic publishing|papers]] and a [[narrative]] account of his achievements.&lt;ref name=mck/&gt;

George Kolb, a German [[physician]], made expeditions in 1894 and 1896&lt;ref name=mck/&gt; and was the first to reach the moorlands on the east side of the mountain. More exploration occurred after 1899 when the [[Uganda Railway]] was completed as far as the future site of Nairobi.&lt;ref name=mck/&gt;&lt;ref name=mackinder/&gt;

===Mackinder's expedition===
On 28 July 1899,&lt;ref name=mackinder/&gt; [[Sir Halford John Mackinder]] set out from the site of Nairobi on an expedition to Mount Kenya. The members of the expedition consisted of 6 [[Europe]]ans, 66 [[Swahili people|Swahilis]], 2 [[Maasai people|Maasai]] guides, and 96 Kikuyu. The Europeans were Campbell B. Hausberg, second in command and [[photographer]]; Douglas Saunders, [[botanist]]; C F Camburn, [[taxidermy|taxidermist]]; Cesar Ollier, [[Mountain guide|guide]]; and Josef Brocherel, guide and porter.&lt;ref name=mackinder&gt;{{cite journal

 | jstor=1774261}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The expedition made it as far as the mountain, but encountered many difficulties on the way. The country they passed through was full of [[Infectious disease|plague]] and [[famine]]. Many Kikuyu porters tried to desert with women from the villages, and others stole from the villages, which made the [[Tribal chief|chiefs]] very hostile towards the expedition. When they reached the [[base camp]] on 18 August,&lt;ref name=mackinder/&gt; they could not find any food, suffered two of their party killed by the local people, and eventually had to send Saunders to [[Naivasha]] to get help from [[Captain Gorges]], the Government Officer there.&lt;ref name=mackinder/&gt;

Mackinder pushed on up the mountain, and established a camp at {{convert|3142|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name=mackinder/&gt; in the Höhnel Valley. He made his first attempt on the summit on 30 August with Ollier and Brocherel up the south east face, but they had to retreat when they were within {{convert|100|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} of the summit of Nelion due to nightfall.

On 5 September, Hausberg, Ollier, and Brocherel made a circuit of the main peaks looking for an easier route to the summit. They could not find one. On 11 September Ollier and Brocherel made an ascent of the Darwin Glacier, but were forced to retreat due to a [[blizzard]].&lt;ref name=mackinder/&gt;

When Saunders returned from Naivasha with the relief party, Mackinder had another attempt at the summit with Ollier and Brocherel. They traversed the Lewis Glacier and climbed the south east face of Nelion. They spent the night near the [[gendarme (mountaineering)|gendarme]], and traversed the [[snowfield]] at the head of the Darwin Glacier at dawn before cutting steps up the Diamond Glacier. They reached the summit of Batian at noon on 13 September, and descended by the same route.&lt;ref name=mackinder/&gt;

===1900–1930===
[[Image:Mt kenya point john showing couloir.jpg|thumb|Shipton and Russell made the first ascent of Point John up the south-east gully in 1929]]
After the first ascent of Mount Kenya there were fewer expeditions there for a while. The majority of the exploration until after the [[First World War]] was by [[settler]]s in Kenya, who were not on scientific expeditions. A [[Church of Scotland]] [[mission (Christian)|mission]] was set up in [[Chogoria]], and several Scottish missionaries ascended to the peaks, including [[John Arthur|Rev Dr. J. W. Arthur]], G. Dennis and A. R. Barlow. There were other ascents, but none succeeded in summitting Batian or Nelion.&lt;ref name=mck/&gt;

New approach routes were cleared through the forest, which made access to the peaks area far easier. In 1920, Arthur and Sir Fowell Buxton tried to cut a route in from the south, and other routes came in from [[Nanyuki]] in the north, but the most commonly used was the route from the Chogoria mission in the east, built by Ernest Carr. Carr is also credited with building Urumandi and Top Huts.&lt;ref name=mck/&gt;

On 6 January 1929 the first ascent of Nelion was made by [[Percy Wyn-Harris]] and [[Eric Shipton]]. They climbed the Normal Route, then descended to the Gate of Mists before ascending Batian. On 8 January they reascended, this time with G. A. Sommerfelt, and in December Shipton made another ascent with R. E. G. Russell. They also made the first ascent of Point John. During this year the [[Mountain Club of East Africa]] was formed.&lt;ref name=mck/&gt;

At the end of July 1930, Shipton and [[Bill Tilman]] made the first traverse of the peaks. They ascended by the West Ridge of Batian, traversed the Gate of Mists to Nelion, and descended the Normal Route. During this trip, Shipton and Tilman made first ascents of several other peaks, including Point Peter, Point Dutton, Midget Peak, Point Pigott and either Terere or Sendeyo.&lt;ref name=cordee&gt;{{cite book

===1931 to present day===
In the early 1930s there were several visits to the moorlands around Mount Kenya, with fewer as far as the peaks. Raymond Hook and [[Humphrey Slade]] ascended to map the mountain, and stocked several of the streams with trout. By 1938 there had been several more ascents of Nelion. In February, Miss C Carroll and Mtu Muthara became the first woman and [[Africa]]n respectively to ascend Nelion, in an expedition with Noel Symington, author of ''[[The Night Climbers of Cambridge]]'', and on 5 March Miss Una Cameron became the first woman to ascend Batian.&lt;ref name=mck/&gt;

During the [[Second World War]] there was another drop in ascents of the mountain. The most remarkable ascent during this period was by three [[Italy|Italians]] who were being held in a British [[prisoner of war|POW]] camp at the base of the mountain in Nanyuki. They escaped from camp to climb the mountain's third peak, Point Lenana, before "escaping" back into camp. [[Felice Benuzzi]], the team leader, retold his story in the book ''[[No Picnic on Mount Kenya]]'' (1946).&lt;ref name=picnic&gt;{{cite book | last= Benuzzi | first= Felice | title=No Picnic on Mount Kenya: A Daring Escape, a Perilous Climb | year=2005 | publisher=The Lyons Press | location=  | isbn=978-1-59228-724-6 | origyear=1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1949 the [[Mountain Club of Kenya]] split from the Mountain Club of East Africa, and the area above {{convert|3400|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} was designated a National Park.&lt;ref name=mck/&gt; A road was built from [[Naro Moru]] to the moorlands, allowing easier access.

Many new routes were climbed on Batian and Nelion in the next three decades, and in October 1959 the Mountain Club of Kenya produced their first guide to Mount Kenya and Kilimanjaro.&lt;ref name=cordee/&gt; On Kenyan independence in 1963, Kisoi Munyao raised the Kenyan flag at the top of the mountain.

===Climbing routes===
[[File:Climbing on Point John.jpg|thumb|left|There are many peaks on Mount Kenya that require [[rock climbing]].]]
Most of the peaks on Mount Kenya have been summited. The majority of these involve [[rock climbing]] as the easiest route, although some only require a [[scrambling|scramble]] or a [[hiking|walk]]. The highest peak that can be ascended without climbing is Point Lenana, {{convert|4985|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=mck&gt;{{cite book

In contrast, approximately 200 people summit Nelion and 50 summit Batian, the two highest peaks.&lt;ref name=guide&gt;{{citation | author= Kenya Wildlife Service
| title= Mount Kenya Official Guidebook | publisher= Kenya Wildlife Service
| year= 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When ascended directly, Batian is usually climbed via the North Face Standard Route, [[UIAA|UIAA grade]] IV+ (or 5.6+ YDS). It was first ascended on 31 July 1944 by Firmin and Hicks.&lt;ref&gt;Alpine Journal, 1945&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eaimg&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate  = 19 May 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The route is usually climbed in two days. The Normal Route is the most climbed route up Nelion, and thence across to Batian. It was first climbed by Shipton and Wyn-Harris on 6 January 1929.&lt;ref name=eaimg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alpine Journal Vol. 42&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to traverse between the two peaks, via the Gates of Mist, but this often involves spending a night in the Howell hut on top of Nelion. There is a bolted abseil descent route off Nelion.&lt;ref name=mck/&gt;

Mount Kenya's climbing seasons are a result of its location only {{convert|20|km|mi||abbr=on}} from the equator. During the northern summer the rock routes on the north side of the peak are in good summer condition, while at the same time the ice routes on the south side of the peak are prime shape. The situation is reversed during the southern summer. The two seasons are separated by several months of rainy season before and after, during which climbing conditions are generally unfavorable.

Mount Kenya is home to several good ice routes, the two most famous being the Diamond Couloir and the Ice Window route. Snow and ice levels on the mountain have been retreating at an accelerated rate in recent years, making these climbs increasingly difficult and dangerous. The Diamond Couloir, a steep ice couloir fed by the fusion of the upper Diamond Glacier and pioneered in 1975 by Yvon Chouinard and Michael Covington, was once climbable in summer or winter but now is virtually unclimbable in summer conditions and is seldom deemed in climbable condition even in winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.climbing.com/news/hotflashes/diamondclimbed/ | title=Diamond Couloir Still Climbable | accessdate=11 July 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119021555/http://www.climbing.com/news/hotflashes/diamondclimbed/ | archive-date=19 January 2011 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Last climbing reports describe the route very difficult, especially in the lower section. The route has changed into a modern ice climb with a very difficult 60m first pitch, starting with 8m of overhanging M7 dry tooling, followed by 50m of USA Grade V ice and by others 6 pitches of moderate climbing on good ice and finally one pitch of water ice USA Grade IV+ ice at the headwall before getting to the Upper Diamond Glacier.

The satellite peaks around the mountain also provide good climbs. These can be climbed in [[Alpinism|Alpine style]] and vary in difficulty from a scramble to climbing at UIAA grade VI. They are useful for acclimatisation before climbing the higher peaks and as ascents in their own right.&lt;ref name=mck/&gt;

===Walking routes===
[[File:Mount Kenya Climbing Routes and Huts photomap-en.svg|thumb|right|Map showing the walking routes and huts around Mount Kenya]]
There are [[Mountaineering on Mount Kenya#Walking routes|eight walking routes]] up to the main peaks. Starting clockwise from the north these are the: Meru, Chogoria, Kamweti, Naro Moru, Burguret, Sirimon and Timau Routes.&lt;ref name=map&gt;{{cite map |publisher = EWP |title = Mount Kenya Map and Guide |url = http://www.ewpnet.com/Kenyamap.htm |edition = 4th |year = 2007 |cartography = EWP |scale = 1:50,000 with 1:25,000 inset |series = EWP Map Guides |isbn = 978-0-906227-96-1 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090227133844/http://www.ewpnet.com/Kenyamap.htm |archivedate = 27 February 2009 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Of these Chogoria, Naro Moru and Sirimon are used most frequently and therefore have staffed gates. The other routes require special permission from the [[Kenya Wildlife Service]] to use.&lt;ref name=guide/&gt;&lt;ref name=eaimgw&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chogoria route leads from [[Chogoria]] town up to the peaks circuit path. It heads through the forest to the south-east of the mountain to the moorland, with views over areas such as Ithanguni and the Giant's Billiards Table before following the Gorges Valley past the Temple and up to Simba Col below Point Lenana.&lt;ref name=map/&gt; The Mountain Club of Kenya claims that Ithanguni and the Giant's Billiards Table offer some of the best [[hillwalking]] in Kenya.&lt;ref name=mck/&gt;

The Naro Moru route is taken by many of the trekkers who try to reach Point Lenana. It can be ascended in only 3&amp;nbsp;days and has bunkhouses at each camp. The route starts at [[Naro Moru]] town to the west of the mountain and climbs towards Mackinder's Camp before joining the Peak Circuit Path.&lt;ref name=eaimgw/&gt; The terrain is usually good, although one section is called the Vertical Bog.&lt;ref name=mck/&gt;

The Sirimon route approaches Mount Kenya from the north-west.&lt;ref name=map/&gt; The path splits on the moorlands, with the more frequently used fork following the Mackinder Valley and the quieter route traversing into the Liki North Valley.&lt;ref name=map/&gt; The paths rejoin at Shipton's Cave just below Shipton's Camp on the Peak Circuit Path.&lt;ref name=mck/&gt;

The Peak Circuit Path is a path around the main peaks, with a distance of about {{convert|10|km|mi|0}} and height gain and loss of over {{convert|2000|m|ft|-2}}.&lt;ref name=map/&gt;  It can be walked in one day, but more commonly takes two or three. It can also be used to join different ascent and descent routes. The route does not require technical climbing.&lt;ref name=cordee/&gt;&lt;ref name=eaimgw/&gt;

==Recent Development==
Development is currently underway for a new route up the mountain starting from the Ragati conservancy and running up the ridge between the Naro Moru route and the old Kamweti trail.

===Accommodation===
Accommodation on Mount Kenya ranges from very basic to luxurious. The more luxurious lodges are found on the lower slopes, in and around the forest.&lt;ref name=castle_forest_lodge&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Many offer guided walks and other activities such as [[fishing]] and [[birdwatching]].

The huts higher on the mountain are more basic. Most have several [[bunkroom]]s with beds, and also offer somewhere to rest, cook and eat. Some also have running water. A few huts are very basic [[bothy|bothies]] and offer only a space to sleep that is sheltered from the weather.&lt;ref name=mck/&gt;&lt;ref name=reader&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Beds in the huts can be reserved at the park gates.&lt;ref name=guide/&gt;
Camping is allowed anywhere in the [[Mount Kenya National Park|National Park]], but it is most encouraged around the huts to limit environmental impact. It is possible for campers to use the communal spaces in the huts for no extra fee.&lt;ref name=guide/&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

==Etymology==
{{main|List of names on Mount Kenya}}
The origin of the name Kenya is not clear, but perhaps linked to the Kikuyu, Embu and Kamba words ''Kirinyaga'', ''Kirenyaa'' and ''Kiinyaa'' which mean "God's resting place" in all three languages.

In the 19th Century, the German explorer, [[Ludwig Krapf]], recorded the name as both ''Kenia'' and ''Kegnia'' believed by some to be a corruption of the Kamba version.&lt;ref name="Krapf"/&gt;&lt;ref name=krapf_452&gt;{{cite journal
 | last=Krapf | first=Johann Ludwig
 | authorlink = Johann Ludwig Krapf  | date = 13 May 1850
 | title = Extract from Krapf's diary
 | journal = Church Missionary Intelligencer
 | volume=i | page=452}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=foottit&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Foottit | first = Claire | origyear=2004
 | title = Kenya | series = The Brade Travel Guide
 | year=2006 | publisher = Bradt Travel Guides Ltd
 | isbn=978-1-84162-066-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Others however say that this was on the contrary a very precise notation of the correct African pronunciation {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɛ|n|j|ə}}.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| author=B. J. Ratcliffe | title=The Spelling of Kenya
| journal=Journal of the Royal African Society | pages=42–44
| volume= 42| issue =  166 | date=January 1943 | jstor=717465}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In any case, the name was for a long time pronounced by colonial-heritage Europeans as {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|iː|n|j|ə}}. The European pronunciation has been abandoned in modern times, in favor of the African version.&lt;ref name=oed_kenya&gt;{{OED|Kenya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Names of peaks===
The peaks of Mount Kenya have been given names from three different sources. Firstly, several Maasai chieftains have been commemorated, with names such as Batian, Nelion and Lenana. They commemorate Mbatian, a Maasai [[Rulers of the Masai|Laibon]] (Medicine Man), Nelieng, his brother, and Lenana and Sendeyo, his sons.&lt;ref name=dutton/&gt;  Terere is named after another Maasai headman.

The second type of names that were given to peaks are after European climbers and explorers. Some examples of this are Shipton, Sommerfelt, Tilman, Dutton and Arthur.&lt;ref name=mck/&gt;

The remaining names are after well-known Kenyan personalities, with the exception of John and Peter, which were named by the missionary Arthur after two [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]]. There is a group of four peaks to the east of the main peaks named after European settlers; Coryndon, Grigg, Delamere and McMillan.&lt;ref name=mck/&gt;

'''Otse Hill''' is a peak often cited as the highest point of [[Botswana]], with a reported altitude of 1,491&amp;nbsp;metres (4,891&amp;nbsp;feet). It is located in the village of [[Otse]], [[South-East District (Botswana)|South-East District]].  Its highest cell on [[SRTM]] data is 1,486 meters - 4875 feet.  The 1999 Department of Surveys and Mapping (Gaborone) 1:50,000 scale topographic map shows a "trigonometrical station" on the Otse Peak summit with an elevation of 1,491 meters - 4892 feet.

The [[Monalanong Hill]] (at a SRTM-derived altitude of 1,494 metres - 4,902 feet) or the [[Tsodilo|Tsodilo Hills]] (at an altitude of about 1400 metres - 4,593 feet) are also often given as the highest point in Botswana.&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} [http://worldheritagesite.org/tags/tag341.html Territorial Highest points] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090323220146/http://worldheritagesite.org/tags/tag341.html |date=2009-03-23 }}, World Heritage Site, accessed on April 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[statistics]], '''overdispersion''' is the presence of greater variability ([[statistical dispersion]]) in a data set than would be expected based on a given [[statistical model]].

A common task in applied [[statistics]] is choosing a [[parametric model]] to fit a given set of empirical observations. This necessitates an assessment of the [[goodness of fit|fit]] of the chosen model. It is usually possible to choose the model parameters in such a way that the theoretical [[population mean]] of the model is approximately equal to the [[sample mean]]. However, especially for simple models with few parameters, theoretical predictions may not match empirical observations for higher [[moment (mathematics)|moment]]s. When the observed [[variance]] is higher than the variance of a theoretical model, '''overdispersion''' has occurred. Conversely, '''underdispersion''' means that there was less variation in the data than predicted. Overdispersion is a very common feature in applied data analysis because in practice, populations are frequently [[heterogeneous]] (non-uniform) contrary to the assumptions implicit within widely used simple parametric models.

==Examples==
===Poisson===
Overdispersion is often encountered when fitting very simple parametric models, such as those based on the [[Poisson distribution]]. The Poisson distribution has one free parameter and does not allow for the variance to be adjusted independently of the mean. The choice of a distribution from the Poisson family is often dictated by the nature of the empirical data. For example, [[Poisson regression]] analysis is commonly used to model [[count data]]. If overdispersion is a feature, an alternative model with additional free parameters may provide a better fit. In the case of count data, a Poisson [[compound probability distribution|mixture model]] like the [[negative binomial distribution]] can be proposed instead, in which the mean of the Poisson distribution can itself be thought of as a random variable drawn – in this case – from the [[gamma distribution]] thereby introducing an additional free parameter (note the resulting negative binomial distribution is completely characterized by two parameters).

===Binomial===
As a more concrete example, it has been observed that the number of boys born to families does not conform faithfully to a [[binomial distribution]] as might be expected. Instead, the sex ratios of families seem to skew toward either boys or girls (see, for example the [[Trivers–Willard hypothesis]] for one possible explanation) i.e. there are more all-boy families, more all-girl families and not enough families close to the population 51:49 boy-to-girl mean ratio than expected from a binomial distribution, and the resulting empirical variance is larger than specified by a binomial model.

In this case, the [[beta-binomial model]] distribution is a popular and analytically tractable alternative model to the binomial distribution since it provides a better fit to the observed data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lindsey |first=J. K. |last2=Altham |first2=P. M. E. | title=Analysis of the Human Sex Ratio by using Overdispersion Models |journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series C |year=1998 |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=149–157 |doi=10.1111/1467-9876.00103}}&lt;/ref&gt; To capture the heterogeneity of the families, one can think of the probability parameter of the binomial model (say, probability of being a boy) as itself a random variable (i.e. [[random effects model]]) drawn for each family from a [[beta distribution]] as the mixing distribution. The resulting [[compound distribution]] (beta-binomial) has an additional free parameter.

Another common model for overdispersion—when some of the observations are not [[Bernoulli distribution|Bernoulli]]—arises from introducing a [[normal distribution|normal random variable]] into a [[logistic regression|logistic model]]. Software is widely available for fitting this type of [[multilevel model]]. In this case, if the variance of the normal variable is zero, the model reduces to the standard (undispersed) [[logistic regression]]. This model has an additional free parameter, namely the variance of the normal variable.

With respect to binomial random variables, the concept of overdispersion makes sense only if n&gt;1 (i.e. overdispersion is nonsensical for Bernoulli random variables).

===Normal distribution===
As the [[normal distribution]] (Gaussian) has variance as a parameter, any data with finite variance (including any finite data) can be modeled with a normal distribution with the exact variance – the normal distribution is a two-parameter model, with mean and variance. Thus, in the absence of an underlying model, there is no notion of data being overdispersed relative to the normal model, though the fit may be poor in other respects (such as the higher moments of [[Skewness|skew]], [[kurtosis]], etc.). However, in the case that the data is modeled by a normal distribution with an expected variation, it can be over- or under-dispersed relative to that prediction.

For example, in a [[statistical survey]], the [[margin of error]] (determined by sample size) predicts the [[sampling error]] and hence dispersion of results on repeated surveys. If one performs a [[meta-analysis]] of repeated surveys of a fixed population (say with a given sample size, so margin of error is the same), one expects the results to fall on normal distribution with standard deviation equal to the margin of error. However, in the presence of [[study heterogeneity]] where studies have different [[sampling bias]], the distribution is instead a [[compound probability distribution|compound distribution]] and will be overdistributed relative to the predicted distribution. For example, given repeated [[opinion poll]]s all with a margin of error of 3%, if they are conducted by different polling organizations, one expects the results to have standard deviation greater than 3%, due to pollster bias from different methodologies.

==Differences in terminology among disciplines==
Over- and underdispersion are terms which have been adopted in branches of the [[biological science]]s. In [[parasitology]], the term 'overdispersion' is generally used as defined here – meaning a distribution with a higher than expected variance.

In some areas of [[ecology]], however, meanings have been transposed, so that overdispersion is actually taken to mean more even (lower variance) than expected. This confusion has caused some ecologists to suggest that the terms 'aggregated', or 'contagious', would be better used in ecology for 'overdispersed'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Greig-Smith |first=P. |year=1983 |title=Quantitative Plant Ecology |publisher=University of California Press |edition=Third |isbn=0-632-00142-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f2fghtp8lA0C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such preferences are creeping into [[parasitology]] too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Poulin |first=R. |year=2006 |title=Evolutionary Ecology of Parasites |publisher=Princeton University Press |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8336.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally this suggestion has not been heeded, and confusion persists in the literature.

Furthermore in [[demography]], overdispersion is often evident in the analysis of death count data, but demographers prefer the term '[[unobserved heterogeneity]]'.

'''Position fixing''' is the branch of [[navigation]] concerned with the use of a variety of visual and [[Electronics|electronic]] methods to determine the position of a [[vehicle]] or person on the surface of the [[Earth]].

These techniques include:

* [[Position line]]s and [[position circle]]s
* [[Celestial navigation]]
* [[Radio navigation]]
* [[Satellite navigation system]]

Positions may be expressed as a bearing and range from a known landmark  or as an [[angle]]s of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] relative to a [[map datum]].

Generally speaking a position fix is calculated by taking into account measurements (referred to as observations) of distances or angles to reference points whose positions are known. In 2D surveys observations of three reference points are enough to compute a position in a [[two dimensional]] plane. In practice observations are subject to errors resulting from various physical and atmospheric factors that influence the measurement of distances and angles.

A practical example of obtaining a position fix would be for a ship to take [[Bearing (navigation)|bearing]] measurements on three [[lighthouse]]s positioned along the coast. These measurements could be made visually using a [[Hand compass|hand bearing compass]], or in poor visibility electronically using [[radar]] or [[Direction finding|radio direction finding]]. Since all physical observations are subject to errors the resulting position fix is also subject to error. Although in theory two lines of position (LOP) are enough to define a point, in practice 'crossing' more LOPs provides greater accuracy and confidence, especially if the lines cross at a good angle to each other. Three LOPs are considered the minimum for a practical navigational fix. The three LOPs when drawn on the chart will in general form a triangle, known as a 'cocked hat'. The navigator will have more confidence in a position fix that is formed by a small cocked hat with angles close to those of an [[equilateral triangle]]. 

It is not true to say that the navigator's true position is 'definitely' within the cocked hat on the chart. The area of doubt surrounding a position fix is called an error ellipse. To minimize the error, [[Satellite navigation|electronic navigation]] systems generally use more than three reference points to compute a position fix to increase the [[data redundancy]]. As more redundant reference points are added the position fix becomes more accurate and the area of the resulting error ellipse decreases.

The process of combining multiple observations to compute a position fix is equivalent to solving a system of [[linear equations]].  Navigation systems use regression [[algorithms]] such as [[Least squares]] in order to compute a position fix in 3D space. This is most commonly done by combining distance measurements to 4 or more [[GPS]] [[satellites]], which orbit the earth along paths of predetermined position.

'''Rachel Louise Carson''' (May 27, 1907&amp;nbsp;– April 14, 1964) was an American [[marine biology|marine biologist]], author, and [[conservation movement|conservationist]] whose book ''[[Silent Spring]]'' and other writings are credited with advancing the global [[environmental movement]].

Carson began her career as an aquatic biologist in the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Bureau of Fisheries]], and became a full-time nature writer in the 1950s. Her widely praised 1951 bestseller ''[[The Sea Around Us]]'' won her a U.S. [[National Book Award]],&lt;ref name=nba1952 /&gt; recognition as a gifted writer, and financial security. Her next book, ''The Edge of the Sea'', and the reissued version of her first book, ''[[Under the Sea Wind]]'', were also bestsellers. This sea trilogy explores the whole of ocean life from the shores to the depths.

Late in the 1950s, Carson turned her attention to conservation, especially some problems that she believed were caused by synthetic [[pesticide]]s. The result was the book ''[[Silent Spring]]'' (1962), which brought environmental concerns to an unprecedented share of the American people. Although ''Silent Spring'' was met with fierce opposition by chemical companies, it spurred a reversal in national pesticide policy, which led to a nationwide ban on [[DDT]] and other pesticides. It also inspired a [[grassroots]] environmental movement that led to the creation of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]].&lt;ref name=CarsonPaull&gt;Paull, John (2013) [http://orgprints.org/22934/7/22934.pdf "The Rachel Carson Letters and the Making of Silent Spring"], ''Sage Open'', 3(July): 1–12. {{doi|10.1177/2158244013494861}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carson was posthumously awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by [[Jimmy Carter]].

===Early life and education===
[[File:RachelCarsonHomestead.jpg|thumb|left|Carson's childhood home is now preserved as the [[Rachel Carson Homestead]] (photo taken November 7, 2009)]]
Rachel Carson was born on May 27, 1907, on a family farm near [[Springdale, Pennsylvania]], just up the [[Allegheny River]] from [[Pittsburgh]]. She was the daughter of Maria Frazier (McLean) and Robert Warden Carson, an insurance salesman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.une.edu/mwwc/research/featured-writers/rachel-l.-carson-collection-1946-1964 |title=University of New England — Maine Women Writers Collection — Research — Featured Writers — Rachel L. Carson Collection, 1946–1964 |publisher=Une.edu |date= |access-date=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; She spent a lot of time exploring around her family's {{convert|65|acre||adj=on}} farm. An avid reader, she began writing stories (often involving animals) at age eight and had her first story published at age ten. She especially enjoyed the ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine]]'' (which carried her first published stories), the works of [[Beatrix Potter]], and the novels of [[Gene Stratton-Porter]], and in her teen years, [[Herman Melville]], [[Joseph Conrad]] and [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]. The natural world, particularly the ocean, was the common thread of her favorite literature. Carson attended Springdale's small school through tenth grade, then completed high school in nearby [[New Kensington, Pennsylvania|Parnassus, Pennsylvania]], graduating in 1925 at the top of her class of forty-five students.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=7–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Pennsylvania College for Women (today known as [[Chatham University]]), as in high school, Carson was somewhat of a loner. She originally studied English, but switched her major to biology in January 1928, though she continued contributing to the school's student newspaper and literary supplement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rachel Carson|url=http://www.fws.gov/northeast/rachelcarson/carsonbio.html|publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|access-date=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though admitted to graduate standing at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1928, she was forced to remain at the Pennsylvania College for Women for her senior year due to financial difficulties; she graduated ''[[Latin honors#Types|magna cum laude]]'' in 1929. After a summer course at the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]], she continued her studies in [[zoology]] and [[genetics]] at Johns Hopkins in the fall of 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=27–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After her first year of graduate school, Carson became a part-time student, taking an assistantship in [[Raymond Pearl]]'s laboratory, where she worked with rats and ''[[Drosophila]]'', to earn money for tuition. After false starts with [[pit viper]]s and [[squirrel]]s, she completed a dissertation project on the embryonic development of the [[pronephros]] in fish. She earned a master's degree in zoology in June 1932. She had intended to continue for a doctorate, but in 1934 Carson was forced to leave Johns Hopkins to search for a full-time teaching position to help support her family during the Great Depression.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Michael|date=Autumn 2011|title="Silence, Miss Carson!" Science, Gender, and the Reception of "Silent Spring"|jstor=3178817|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=27|pages=733–752}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, her father died suddenly, worsening their already critical financial situation and leaving Carson to care for her aging mother. At the urging of her undergraduate biology mentor Mary Scott Skinker, she settled for a temporary position with the [[United States Fish Commission|U.S. Bureau of Fisheries]], writing radio copy for a series of weekly educational broadcasts entitled ''Romance Under the Waters''. The series of fifty-two seven minute programs focused on aquatic life and was intended to generate public interest in fish biology and in the work of the bureau, a task the several writers before Carson had not managed. Carson also began submitting articles on marine life in the [[Chesapeake Bay]], based on her research for the series, to local newspapers and magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=63–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carson's supervisor, pleased with the success of the radio series, asked her to write the introduction to a public brochure about the fisheries bureau; he also worked to secure her the first full-time position that became available. Sitting for the [[United States federal civil service|civil service]] exam, she outscored all other applicants and, in 1936, became the second woman hired by the Bureau of Fisheries for a full-time professional position, as a junior aquatic biologist.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=79–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career and publications===
At the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, Carson's main responsibilities were to analyze and report field data on fish populations, and to write brochures and other literature for the public. Using her research and consultations with marine biologists as starting points, she also wrote a steady stream of articles for ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' and other newspapers. However, her family responsibilities further increased in January 1937 when her older sister died, leaving Carson as the sole breadwinner for her mother and two nieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=82–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1937, the ''[[The Atlantic|Atlantic Monthly]]'' accepted a revised version of an essay, ''The World of Waters'', that she originally wrote for her first fisheries bureau brochure. Her supervisor had deemed it too good for that purpose. The essay, published as ''Undersea'', was a vivid narrative of a journey along the ocean floor. It marked a major turning point in Carson's writing career. Publishing house [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], impressed by ''Undersea'', contacted Carson and suggested that she expand it into a book. Several years of writing resulted in ''[[Under the Sea Wind]]'' (1941), which received excellent reviews but sold poorly. In the meantime, Carson's article-writing success continued—her features appeared in ''Sun Magazine'', ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', and ''[[Collier's]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=85–113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carson attempted to leave the Bureau (by then transformed into the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]]) in 1945, but few jobs for naturalists were available, as most money for science was focused on technical fields in the wake of the [[Manhattan Project]]. In mid-1945, Carson first encountered the subject of [[DDT]], a revolutionary new pesticide&amp;nbsp;— lauded as the "insect bomb" after the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]&amp;nbsp;— that was only beginning to undergo tests for safety and [[Ecology|ecological]] effects. DDT was but one of Carson's many writing interests at the time, and editors found the subject unappealing; she published nothing on DDT until 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=114–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rachel Carson Conducts Marine Biology Research with Bob Hines.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Rachel Carson and [[Robert W. Hines|Bob Hines]] conducting research off the Atlantic coast in 1952]]
Carson rose within the Fish and Wildlife Service, by 1945 supervising a small writing staff and in 1949 becoming chief editor of publications. Though her position provided increasing opportunities for field work and freedom in choosing her writing projects, it also entailed increasingly tedious administrative responsibilities. By 1948, Carson was working on material for a second book, and had made the conscious decision to begin a transition to writing full-time. That year, she took on a literary agent, [[Marie Rodell]]; they formed a close professional relationship that would last the rest of Carson's career.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=121–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oxford University Press]] expressed interest in Carson's book proposal for a life history of the ocean, spurring her to complete by early 1950 the manuscript of what would become ''[[The Sea Around Us]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=163–64}}.&lt;br /&gt;• An apocryphal story holds that the book was rejected by over twenty publishers before Oxford University Press. In fact, it may have only been sent to one other publisher before being accepted, though Rodell and Carson worked extensively to place chapters and excerpts in periodicals.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapters appeared in ''[[Science Digest]]'' and ''[[The Yale Review]]''&amp;nbsp;— the latter chapter, ''The Birth of an Island'', winning the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]'s George Westinghouse Science Writing Prize. Nine chapters were serialized in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' beginning June 1951 and the book was published July 2, 1951, by [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;!-- source is our article on the book --&gt; ''The Sea Around Us'' remained on [[The New York Times Best Seller list]] for 86 weeks, was abridged by ''[[Reader's Digest]]'', won the 1952 [[National Book Award for Nonfiction]]&lt;ref name=nba1952&gt;[https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1952 "National Book Awards&amp;nbsp;— 1952"].

Retrieved March 19, 2012.&lt;br /&gt;(With acceptance speech by Carson and essay by [[Neil Baldwin (writer)|Neil Baldwin]] from the Awards 50-year anniversary publications.)&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[John Burroughs Medal]], and resulted in Carson's being awarded two honorary doctorates. She also licensed a documentary film based on it. ''The Sea''{{'s}} success led to the republication of ''Under the Sea Wind'', which became a bestseller itself. With success came financial security, and in 1952 Carson was able to give up her job in order to concentrate on writing full time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp =164–241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carson was inundated with speaking engagements, [[fan mail]] and other correspondence regarding ''The Sea Around Us'', along with work on the documentary script that she had secured the right to review.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=206–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was very unhappy with the final version of the script by writer, director and producer [[Irwin Allen]]; she found it untrue to the atmosphere of the book and scientifically embarrassing, describing it as "a cross between a believe-it-or-not and a breezy travelogue."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=215–16, 238–39}}. Quotation from a letter to Carson's film agent Shirley Collier, November 9, 1952. Quoted in Lear, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; She discovered, however, that her right to review the script did not extend to any control over its content. Allen proceeded in spite of Carson's objections to produce a very successful documentary. It won the 1953 [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]], but Carson was so embittered by the experience that she never again sold film rights to her work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=239–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with Dorothy Freeman===
Carson first met Dorothy Freeman in the Summer of 1953 in Southport Island, Maine. Freeman had written to Carson welcoming her to the area when she had heard that the famous author was to become her neighbor. It was the beginning of an extremely close friendship that would last the rest of Carson's life. Their relationship was conducted mainly through letters, and during summers spent together in Maine. Over the course of 12 years, they would exchange somewhere in the region of 900 letters. Many of these were published in the book ''Always, Rachel'', published in 1995 by Beacon Press.

Carson's biographer, [[Linda J. Lear]], writes that "Carson sorely needed a devoted friend and kindred spirit who would listen to her without advising and accept her wholly, the writer as well as the woman."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; She found this in Freeman. The two women had a number of common interests, nature chief among them, and began exchanging letters regularly while apart. They would share summers for the remainder of Carson's life, and meet whenever else their schedules permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=243–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In regard to the extent of their relationship, commentators have said that: "the expression of their love was limited almost wholly to letters and very occasional farewell kisses or holding of hands".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Montefiore, Janet|title='The fact that possesses my imagination': Rachel Carson, Science and Writing|journal=Women: A Cultural Review|volume=12|issue=1|page=48|year=2001|doi=10.1080/09574040110034110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freeman shared parts of Carson's letters with her husband to help him understand the relationship, but much of their correspondence was carefully guarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=255–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before Carson's death, she and Freeman destroyed hundreds of letters. The surviving correspondence was published in 1995 as ''Always, Rachel: The Letters of Rachel Carson and Dorothy Freeman, 1952–1964: An Intimate Portrait of a Remarkable Friendship'', edited by Freeman's granddaughter. According to one reviewer, the pair "fit Carolyn Heilbrun's characterization of a strong female friendship, where what matters is 'not whether friends are homosexual or heterosexual, lovers or not, but whether they share the wonderful energy of work in the public sphere'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tjossem, Sarah F.|title=Review of ''Always Rachel: The Letters of Rachel Carson and Dorothy Freeman, 1952–1964''|journal=Isis|volume=86|issue=4|pages=687–88|year=1995|doi=10.1086/357392}} quoting from: {{cite book|author=Heilbrun, Carolyn|title=Writing a Woman's Life|publisher=Ballantine|year=1988|isbn=0-345-36256-X|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{Anchor|The Edge of the Sea}}''The Edge of the Sea'' and transition to conservation work ===&lt;!-- Other articles link here. --&gt;
Early in 1953, Carson began library and field research on the ecology and organisms of the Atlantic shore.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=223–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, she completed the third volume of her sea trilogy, ''The Edge of the Sea'', which focuses on life in [[coast]]al ecosystems, particularly along the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]]. It appeared in ''The New Yorker'' in two condensed installments shortly before its October 26 book release by [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin]] (again a new publisher). By this time, Carson's reputation for clear and poetical prose was well established; ''The Edge of the Sea'' received highly favorable reviews, if not quite as enthusiastic as for ''The Sea Around Us''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=261–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through 1955 and 1956, Carson worked on a number of projects&amp;nbsp;— including the script for an ''[[Omnibus (U.S. TV series)|Omnibus]]'' episode, "Something About the Sky"&amp;nbsp;— and wrote articles for popular magazines. Her plan for the next book was to address [[evolution]], but the publication of [[Julian Huxley]]'s ''Evolution in Action''&amp;nbsp;— and her own difficulty in finding a clear and compelling approach to the topic&amp;nbsp;— led her to abandon the project. Instead, her interests were turning to conservation. She considered an environment-themed book project tentatively titled ''Remembrance of the Earth'' and became involved with [[The Nature Conservancy]] and other conservation groups. She also made plans to buy and preserve from development an area in Maine she and Freeman called the "Lost Woods."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=276–300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in 1957, family tragedy struck a third time when one of the nieces she had cared for in the 1940s died at the age of 31, leaving a five-year-old orphan son, Roger Christie. Carson took on that responsibility, adopting the boy, alongside caring for her aging mother. This took a considerable toll on Carson. She moved to [[Silver Spring, Maryland]], to care for Roger, and much of 1957 was spent putting their new living situation in order and focusing on specific environmental threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=300–09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 1957, Carson was closely following federal proposals for widespread pesticide spraying; the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) planned to eradicate [[Red imported fire ant|fire ants]], and other spraying programs involving [[Organochloride|chlorinated hydrocarbons]] and [[organophosphate]]s were on the rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=305–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the rest of her life, Carson's main professional focus would be the dangers of pesticide overuse.

''[[Silent Spring]]'', Carson's best-known book, was published by Houghton Mifflin on 27 September 1962.&lt;ref name=McLaughlin&gt;{{cite web |author=McLaughlin, Dorothy |title=Fooling with Nature: ''Silent Spring'' Revisited |work=Frontline |publisher=PBS |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/nature/disrupt/sspring.html |access-date=August 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book described the harmful effects of pesticides on the environment, and is widely credited with helping launch the [[environmental movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Josie Glausiusz.

====Research and writing====
Starting in the mid-1940s, Carson had become concerned about the use of synthetic pesticides, many of which had been developed through the [[History of military technology|military funding of science]] since [[World War II]]. It was the United States federal government's 1957 [[Lymantria dispar dispar|gypsy moth]] eradication program, however, that prompted Carson to devote her research, and her next book, to pesticides and environmental poisons. The gypsy moth program involved aerial spraying of DDT and other pesticides (mixed with [[fuel oil]]), including the spraying of private land. Landowners on Long Island filed a lawsuit to have the spraying stopped, and many in affected regions followed the case closely.&lt;ref name=CarsonPaull /&gt; Though the suit was lost, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] granted petitioners the right to gain injunctions against potential environmental damage in the future; this laid the basis for later successful environmental actions.&lt;ref name=CarsonPaull /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ellsworthmaine.com/site/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12535&amp;Itemid=47 |title=Obituary of Marjorie Spock |publisher=Ellsworthmaine.com |date=January 30, 2008 |access-date=March 16, 2009}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greene|first1=Jennifer|title=Obituary for Marjorie Spock|journal=Newsletter of the Portland Branch of Anthroposophical Society in Portland, Oregon|date=February 2008|volume=4.2|page=7|url=http://www.portlandanthroposophy.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/February2008PortlandBranchNewsletter.pdf|access-date=29 August 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150829182612/http://www.portlandanthroposophy.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/February2008PortlandBranchNewsletter.pdf|archivedate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Audubon Naturalist Society]] also actively opposed such spraying programs, and recruited Carson to help make public the government's exact spraying practices and the related research.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=312–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carson began the four-year project of what would become ''[[Silent Spring]]'' by gathering examples of environmental damage attributed to DDT. She also attempted to enlist others to join the cause: essayist [[E. B. White]], and a number of journalists and scientists. By 1958, Carson had arranged a book deal, with plans to co-write with ''[[Newsweek]]'' science journalist Edwin Diamond. However, when ''The New Yorker'' commissioned a long and well-paid article on the topic from Carson, she began considering writing more than simply the introduction and conclusion as planned; soon it was a solo project. (Diamond would later write one of the harshest critiques of ''Silent Spring'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=317–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As her research progressed, Carson found a sizable community of scientists who were documenting the physiological and environmental effects of pesticides.&lt;ref name=CarsonPaull /&gt; She also took advantage of her personal connections with many government scientists, who supplied her with confidential information. From reading the scientific literature and interviewing scientists, Carson found two scientific camps when it came to pesticides: those who dismissed the possible danger of pesticide spraying barring conclusive proof, and those who were open to the possibility of harm and willing to consider alternative methods such as [[biological pest control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=327–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also found significant support and extensive evidence from a group of [[Biodynamic agriculture]] organic market gardeners, their adviser, Dr. Ehrenfried Pfeiffer, other contacts, and their suite of legal actions (1957-1960) against the U.S. Government.  According to recent research by Paull (2013), this may have been the primary and (for strategic reasons) uncredited source for Carson’s book. [[Marjorie Spock]] and Mary T. Richards, of Long Island, New York, contested the aerial spraying of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). They  compiled their evidence and shared it with Carson, who used it, their extensive contacts, and the trial transcripts, as a primary input for ''Silent Spring''. Carson wrote of the content as "a gold mine of information" and says, "I feel guilty about the mass of your material I have here”&lt;ref&gt;Carson, R. (1958c). MS typewritten letter: Dear Miss Spock; 12/8/1958. New Haven, CT: Yale Collection of American Literature, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library.&lt;/ref&gt; and makes multiple references to Pfeiffer and to his correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John. "The Rachel Carson Letters and the Making of Silent Spring." Sage Open 3, no. 3 (2013) doi:10.1177/2158244013494861.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carson, R. (1958f). MS typewritten letter: Dear Mrs. Spock; 26/3/1958 (1 p.). New Haven, CT: Yale Collection of American Literature, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1959, the USDA's [[Agricultural Research Service]] responded to the criticism by Carson and others with a public service film, ''Fire Ant on Trial''; Carson characterized it as "flagrant [[propaganda]]" that ignored the dangers that spraying pesticides (especially [[dieldrin]] and [[heptachlor]]) posed to humans and wildlife. That spring, Carson wrote a letter, published in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', that attributed the recent decline in bird populations&amp;nbsp;— in her words, the "silencing of birds"&amp;nbsp;— to pesticide overuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=342–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; That was also the year of the "Great Cranberry Scandal": the 1957, 1958, and 1959 crops of U.S. [[cranberry|cranberries]] were found to contain high levels of the herbicide [[3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole|aminotriazole]] (which caused cancer in laboratory rats) and the sale of all cranberry products was halted. Carson attended the ensuing FDA hearings on revising pesticide regulations; she came away discouraged by the aggressive tactics of the chemical industry representatives, which included expert testimony that was firmly contradicted by the bulk of the scientific literature she had been studying. She also wondered about the possible "financial inducements behind certain pesticide programs."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=358–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research at the [[United States National Library of Medicine|Library of Medicine]] of the [[National Institutes of Health]] brought Carson into contact with medical researchers investigating the gamut of cancer-causing chemicals. Of particular significance was the work of [[National Cancer Institute]] researcher and environmental cancer section founding director [[Wilhelm Hueper]], who classified many pesticides as [[carcinogen]]s. Carson and her research assistant Jeanne Davis, with the help of NIH librarian Dorothy Algire, found evidence to support the pesticide-cancer connection; to Carson the evidence for the toxicity of a wide array of synthetic pesticides was clear-cut, though such conclusions were very controversial beyond the small community of scientists studying pesticide [[carcinogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=355–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1960, Carson had more than enough research material, and the writing was progressing rapidly. In addition to the thorough literature search, she had investigated hundreds of individual incidents of pesticide exposure and the human sickness and ecological damage that resulted. However, in January, a duodenal ulcer followed by several infections kept her bedridden for weeks, greatly delaying the completion of ''Silent Spring''. As she was nearing full recovery in March (just as she was completing drafts of the two cancer chapters of her book), she discovered cysts in her left breast, one of which necessitated a [[mastectomy]]. Though her doctor described the procedure as precautionary and recommended no further treatment, by December Carson discovered that the tumor was [[Malignancy|malignant]] and the cancer had [[Metastasis|metastasized]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=360–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her research was also delayed by revision work for a new edition of ''The Sea Around Us'', and by a collaborative photo essay with [[Erich Hartmann (photographer)|Erich Hartmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=372–73}}. The photo essay, ''The Sea'', was published in ''Johns Hopkins Magazine'', May/June 1961; Carson provided the captions for Hartmann's photographs.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the research and writing was done by the fall of 1960, except for the discussion of recent research on [[biological pest control]]s and investigations of a handful of new pesticides. However, further health troubles slowed the final revisions in 1961 and early 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=376–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was difficult finding a title for the book; "Silent Spring" was initially suggested as a title for the chapter on birds. By August 1961, Carson finally agreed to the suggestion of her literary agent Marie Rodell: ''Silent Spring'' would be a metaphorical title for the entire book, suggesting a bleak future for the whole natural world, rather than a literal chapter title about the absence of birdsong.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=375, 377–78, 386–87, 389}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Carson's approval, editor [[Paul Brooks (author)|Paul Brooks]] at Houghton Mifflin arranged for illustrations by Louis and Lois Darling, who also designed the cover. The final writing was the first chapter, ''A Fable for Tomorrow'', which Carson intended as a gentle introduction to what might otherwise be a forbiddingly serious topic. By mid-1962, Brooks and Carson had largely finished the editing, and were laying the groundwork for promoting the book by sending the manuscript out to select individuals for final suggestions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=390–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Content====
As biographer Mark Hamilton Lytle writes, Carson "quite self-consciously decided to write a book calling into question the [[paradigm]] of [[scientific progress]] that defined [[post-war]] American culture." The overriding theme of ''Silent Spring'' is the powerful&amp;nbsp;— and often adverse&amp;nbsp;— effect humans have on the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lytle|2007|pp=166–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carson's main argument is that [[pesticide]]s have detrimental effects on the environment; they are more properly termed ''[[biocide]]s'', she argues, because their effects are rarely limited to the target pests. DDT is a prime example, but other synthetic pesticides come under scrutiny as well, many of which are subject to [[bioaccumulation]]. Carson also accuses the [[chemical industry]] of intentionally spreading [[disinformation]] and public officials of accepting industry claims uncritically. Most of the book is devoted to pesticides' effects on natural ecosystems, but four chapters also detail cases of human pesticide poisoning, cancer, and other illnesses attributed to pesticides.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lytle|2007|pp=166–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; About DDT and cancer, the subject of so much subsequent debate, Carson says only a little:
{{quote|In laboratory tests on animal subjects, DDT has produced suspicious liver tumors. Scientists of the Food and Drug Administration who reported the discovery of these tumors were uncertain how to classify them, but felt there was some "justification for considering them low grade hepatic cell carcinomas." Dr. Hueper [author of ''Occupational Tumors and Allied Diseases''] now gives DDT the definite rating of a "chemical carcinogen."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carson|1962|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Carson predicted increased consequences in the future, especially as targeted pests develop [[pesticide resistance]], while weakened ecosystems fall prey to unanticipated [[invasive species]]. The book closes with a call for a [[biotic material|biotic]] approach to pest control as an alternative to chemical pesticides.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lytle|2007|pp=169, 173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to the pesticide DDT, Carson never actually called for an outright ban. Part of the argument she made in ''Silent Spring'' was that even if DDT and other insecticides had ''no'' environmental side effects, their indiscriminate overuse was counter-productive because it would create insect resistance to the pesticide(s), making the pesticides useless in eliminating the target insect populations:

{{quote|No responsible person contends that insect-borne disease should be ignored. The question that has now urgently presented itself is whether it is either wise or responsible to attack the problem by methods that are rapidly making it worse. The world has heard much of the triumphant war against disease through the control of insect vectors of infection, but it has heard little of the other side of the story&amp;nbsp;— the defeats, the short-lived triumphs that now strongly support the alarming view that the insect enemy has been made actually stronger by our efforts. Even worse, we may have destroyed our very means of fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carson|1962|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Carson further noted that "Malaria programmes are threatened by resistance among mosquitoes"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carson|1962|p=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; and emphasized the advice given by the director of Holland's Plant Protection Service: "Practical advice should be 'Spray as little as you possibly can' rather than 'Spray to the limit of your capacity'...Pressure on the pest population should always be as slight as possible."&lt;ref name="Carson 1962 275"&gt;{{harvnb|Carson|1962|p=275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Promotion and reception====
Carson and the others involved with publication of ''Silent Spring'' expected fierce criticism. They were particularly concerned about the possibility of being sued for [[Defamation|libel]]. Carson was also undergoing [[radiation therapy]] to combat her spreading cancer, and expected to have little energy to devote to defending her work and responding to critics. In preparation for the anticipated attacks, Carson and her agent attempted to amass as many prominent supporters as possible before the book's release.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=397–400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the book's scientific chapters were reviewed by scientists with relevant expertise, among whom Carson found strong support. Carson attended the [[White House]] Conference on Conservation in May 1962; Houghton Mifflin distributed proof copies of ''Silent Spring'' to many of the delegates, and promoted the upcoming ''New Yorker'' serialization. Among many others, Carson also sent a proof copy to Supreme Court Associate Justice [[William O. Douglas]], a long-time environmental advocate who had argued against the court's rejection of the Long Island pesticide spraying case (and who had provided Carson with some of the material included in her chapter on herbicides).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=375, 377, 400–07}}. Douglas's dissenting opinion on the rejection of the case, ''Robert Cushman Murphy et al., v. Butler et al.'', from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, is from March 28, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though ''Silent Spring'' had generated a fairly high level of interest based on pre-publication promotion, this became much more intense with the serialization in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', which began in the June 16, 1962, issue. This brought the book to the attention of the chemical industry and its lobbyists, as well as a wide swath of the American populace. Around that time Carson also learned that ''Silent Spring'' had been selected as the [[Book of the Month Club|Book of the Month]] for October; as she put it, this would "carry it to farms and hamlets all over that country that don't know what a bookstore looks like&amp;nbsp;— much less ''The New Yorker''."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=407–08}}. Quotation (p. 408) from a June 13, 1962, letter from Carson to Dorothy Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt; Other publicity included a positive editorial in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and excerpts of the serialized version in ''[[Audubon (magazine)|Audubon]]'' magazine, with another round of publicity in July and August as chemical companies responded. The story of the birth defect-causing drug [[thalidomide]] broke just before the book's publication as well, inviting comparisons between Carson and [[Frances Oldham Kelsey]], the [[Food and Drug Administration]] reviewer who had blocked the drug's sale in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=409–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Silent Spring Book-of-the-Month-Club edition.JPG|thumb|The [[Book-of-the-Month Club]] edition of ''[[Silent Spring]]'', including an endorsement by Justice Douglas, had a first print run of 150,000 copies, two-and-a-half times the combined size of the two conventional printings of the initial release.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=416, 419}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;
In the weeks leading up to the September 27, 1962, publication, there was strong opposition to ''Silent Spring'' from the chemical industry. [[DuPont]] (a main manufacturer of DDT and [[2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid|2,4-D]]) and [[Velsicol Chemical Corporation]] (exclusive manufacturer of [[chlordane]] and [[heptachlor]]) were among the first to respond. DuPont compiled an extensive report on the book's press coverage and estimated impact on public opinion. Velsicol threatened legal action against Houghton Mifflin as well as ''The New Yorker'' and ''Audubon'' unless the planned ''Silent Spring'' features were canceled. Chemical industry representatives and lobbyists also lodged a range of non-specific complaints, some anonymously. Chemical companies and associated organizations produced a number of their own brochures and articles promoting and defending pesticide use. However, Carson's and the publishers' lawyers were confident in the vetting process ''Silent Spring'' had undergone. The magazine and book publications proceeded as planned, as did the large Book-of-the-Month printing (which included a pamphlet endorsing the book by William O. Douglas).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=412–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[American Cyanamid]] biochemist [[Robert White-Stevens]] and former Cyanamid chemist [[Thomas H. Jukes|Thomas Jukes]] were among the most aggressive critics, especially of Carson's analysis of DDT.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=433–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to White-Stevens, "If man were to follow the teachings of Miss Carson, we would return to the Dark Ages, and the insects and diseases and vermin would once again inherit the earth."&lt;ref name="frontline_Cyanamid"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/nature/disrupt/sspring.html Fooling with nature: special reports: Silent Spring revisited:]. Retrieved September 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Others went further, attacking Carson's scientific credentials (because her training was in marine biology rather than biochemistry) and her personal character. White-Stevens labeled her "...a fanatic defender of the cult of the balance of nature,"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{harvnb|Lear|1997|p=434}}&lt;/ref&gt; while former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture [[Ezra Taft Benson]], in a letter to former President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], reportedly concluded that because she was unmarried despite being physically attractive, she was "probably a [[Communism|Communist]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=429–30}}. Benson's supposed comments were widely repeated at the time, but have not been directly confirmed.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many critics repeatedly asserted that she was calling for the elimination of all pesticides. Yet Carson had made it clear she was not advocating the banning or complete withdrawal of helpful pesticides, but was instead encouraging responsible and carefully managed use with an awareness of the chemicals' impact on the entire ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Murphy|2005||p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, she concludes her section on DDT in ''Silent Spring'' not by urging a total ban, but with advice for spraying as little as possible to limit the development of resistance.&lt;ref name="Carson 1962 275" /&gt;

The academic community, including prominent defenders such as [[Hermann Joseph Muller|H. J. Muller]], [[Loren Eiseley]], [[Clarence Cottam]], and [[Frank Edwin Egler|Frank Egler]], by and large backed the book's scientific claims; public opinion soon turned Carson's way as well. The chemical industry campaign backfired, as the controversy greatly increased public awareness of potential pesticide dangers, as well as ''Silent Spring'' book sales. Pesticide use became a major public issue, especially after the ''[[CBS Reports]]'' TV special ''The Silent Spring of Rachel Carson'' that aired April 3, 1963. The program included segments of Carson reading from ''Silent Spring'' and interviews with a number of other experts, mostly critics (including White-Stevens); according to biographer Linda Lear, "in juxtaposition to the wild-eyed, loud-voiced Dr. Robert White-Stevens in white lab coat, Carson appeared anything but the hysterical alarmist that her critics contended."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=437–49}}; quotation from 449.&lt;/ref&gt; Reactions from the estimated audience of ten to fifteen million were overwhelmingly positive, and the program spurred a congressional review of pesticide dangers and the public release of a pesticide report by the [[President's Science Advisory Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=449–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a year or so of publication, the attacks on the book and on Carson had largely lost momentum.&lt;ref name="time100"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/time100/scientist/profile/carson03.html The Time 100: Scientists and Thinkers], accessed September 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|p=461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of her last public appearances, Carson testified before President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s Science Advisory Committee. The committee issued its report on May 15, 1963, largely backing Carson's scientific claims.&lt;ref name="nwhp_bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwhp.org/tlp/biographies/carson/carson-bio.html |title=2003 National Women's History Month Honorees: Rachel Carlson |access-date=2014-03-13 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051208074458/http://www.nwhp.org/tlp/biographies/carson/carson-bio.html |archivedate=2005-12-08 |df=}}. Retrieved September 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the report's release, she also testified before a [[United States Senate]] subcommittee to make policy recommendations. Though Carson received hundreds of other speaking invitations, she was unable to accept the great majority of them. Her health was steadily declining as her cancer outpaced the radiation therapy, with only brief periods of remission. She spoke as much as she was physically able, however, including a notable appearance on ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|The Today Show]]'' and speeches at several dinners held in her honor. In late 1963, she received a flurry of awards and honors: the [[National Audubon Society#Audubon Medal|Audubon Medal]] (from the [[National Audubon Society]]), the [[Cullum Geographical Medal]] (from the [[American Geographical Society]]), and induction into the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=451–61, 469–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Weakened from [[breast cancer]] and her treatment regimen, Carson became ill with a respiratory virus in January 1964. Her condition worsened, and in February, doctors found that she had severe [[anemia]] from her radiation treatments and in March they discovered that the cancer had reached her liver. She died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on April 14, 1964, in her home in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]].&lt;ref name="lkwdpl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rachel Carson biography |url=http://www.lkwdpl.org/wihohio/cars-rac.htm |publisher=Women In History |access-date=13 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808015112/http://www.lkwdpl.org/wihohio/cars-rac.htm |archivedate=8 August 2012 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite book|title=Carson, Rachel|year=2010|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|edition=2010|quote=in full Rachel Louise Carson born May 27, 1907, Springdale, Pa., U.S. died April 14, 1964, Silver Spring, Md.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=476–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collected papers and posthumous publications===
Carson bequeathed her manuscripts and papers to [[Yale University]], to take advantage of the new state-of-the-art preservations facilities of the [[Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library]]. Her longtime agent and literary executor [[Marie Rodell]] spent nearly two years organizing and cataloging Carson's papers and correspondence, distributing all the letters to their senders so that only what each correspondent approved would be submitted to the archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=467–58, 477, 482–83}} See also the Beinecke [http://hdl.handle.net/10079/fa/beinecke.carson finding aid for the Rachel Carson Papers].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Rodell arranged for the publication of an essay Carson had intended to expand into a book: ''A Sense of Wonder''. The essay, which was combined with photographs by [[Charles Pratt II|Charles Pratt]] and others, exhorts parents to help their children experience the "...lasting pleasures of contact with the natural world ... available to anyone who will place himself under the influence of earth, sea and sky and their amazing life."&lt;ref name="Murphy 25"&gt;Murphy, 25; quotations from ''A Sense of Wonder'', 95. The essay was originally published in 1956 in ''Woman's Home Companion''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the letters in ''Always Rachel'', in 1998 a volume of Carson's previously unpublished work was published as ''Lost Woods: The Discovered Writing of Rachel Carson'', edited by Linda Lear. All of Carson's books remain in print.&lt;ref name="Murphy 25" /&gt;

===Grassroots environmentalism and the EPA===
Carson's work had a powerful impact on the environmental movement. ''Silent Spring'', in particular, was a rallying point for the fledgling social movement in the 1960s. According to environmental engineer and Carson scholar H. Patricia Hynes, "''Silent Spring'' altered the balance of power in the world. No one since would be able to sell pollution as the necessary underside of progress so easily or uncritically."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hynes|1989|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carson's work, and the activism it inspired, are at least partly responsible for the [[deep ecology]] movement, and the overall strength of the grassroots environmental movement since the 1960s. It was also influential on the rise of [[ecofeminism]] and on many feminist scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hynes|1989|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there remains no evidence that Carson was openly a women's rights activist, her work and its subsequent criticisms have left an iconic legacy for the ecofeminist movement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Attacks on Carson's credibility included criticism of her credentials in which she was labeled an "amateur" and it was said that her writing was too "emotional."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ecofeminist scholars argue that not only was the dissenting rhetoric gendered to paint Carson as hysterical, but was done because her arguments challenged the capitalist production of large agri-business corporations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Others, such as Yaakov Garb, suggest that in addition to not being a women's rights activist, Carson also had no anti-capitalist agenda and that such attacks were unwarranted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, the way photos of Carson were used to portray her are often questioned because of few representations of her engaging in work typical of a scientist, but instead, of her leisure activities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Carson's most direct legacy in the environmental movement was the campaign to ban the use of DDT in the United States (and related efforts to ban or limit its use throughout the world). Though environmental concerns about DDT had been considered by government agencies as early as Carson's testimony before the President's Science Advisory Committee, the 1967 formation of the [[Environmental Defense Fund]] was the first major milestone in the campaign against DDT. The organization brought lawsuits against the government to "establish a citizen's right to a clean environment," and the arguments employed against DDT largely mirrored Carson's. By 1972, the Environmental Defense Fund and other activist groups had succeeded in securing a phase-out of DDT use in the United States (except in emergency cases).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hynes|1989|pp=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) by the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon Administration]] in 1970 addressed another concern that Carson had brought to light. Until then, the same agency (the USDA) was responsible both for regulating pesticides and promoting the concerns of the agriculture industry; Carson saw this as a [[conflict of interest]], since the agency was not responsible for effects on wildlife or other environmental concerns beyond farm policy. Fifteen years after its creation, one journalist described the EPA as "the extended shadow of ''Silent Spring''." Much of the agency's early work, such as enforcing the 1972 [[Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act]], was directly related to Carson's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hynes|1989|pp=47–48, 148–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, the policies of the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan Administration]] emphasized economic growth, rolling back many of the environmental policies adopted in response to Carson and her work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lytle|2007|pp=217–20}}; Jeffrey K.

A variety of groups ranging from government institutions to environmental and conservation organizations to scholarly societies have celebrated Carson's life and work since her death. Perhaps most significantly, on June 9, 1980, Carson was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], the highest civilian honor in the United States. A 17¢ [[Great Americans series]] [[postage stamp]] was issued in her honor the following year; several other countries have since issued Carson postage as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetpatriot.net/stamps2/carson_rachel_stamps.html Marshall Is 2000], [http://stamp-search.com/images/pal9901sh16enviro.jpg Palau 1998], [http://stamp-search.com/images/zam0004sh4-milnm1950-00.jpg Zambia 2000]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, Carson was inducted into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.womenofthehall.org/inductee/rachel-carson/ National Women's Hall of Fame, Rachel Carson]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the [[2000 U.S. Census]], the island has since remained officially uninhabited, though the census estimates that at least 200 military and civilian personnel live on the island at any given time. The island has a small airport, though the 10,000 foot runway is the second longest in Ventura County (slightly behind the 11,102 ft. at the [[Naval Air Station Point Mugu]]) and several buildings, including telemetry reception antennas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beachcalifornia.com/sannic_island.html |title=San Nicolas Island - Channel Islands California |publisher=Beachcalifornia.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Archaeological evidence suggests that San Nicolas Island has been occupied by humans for at least 10,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Troy, Jon M. Erlandson, Gerrit L. Fenenga, &amp; Keith Hamm. 2010. Chipped stone crescents and the antiquity of maritime settlement on San Nicolas Island. ''California Archaeology'' 2:185-202.&lt;/ref&gt; For thousands of years, San Nicolas was the home of the [[Nicoleño]] people, who were probably related to the [[Tongva people|Tongva]] of the mainland and [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Santa Catalina Island]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} It was named for [[Saint Nicholas]] by [[Spain|Spanish]] explorer [[Sebastián Vizcaíno]] after he sighted the island on the saint's [[feast day]] (December 6) in 1602. {{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The Nicoleños were evacuated in the early 19th century by the padres of the [[Spanish Missions of California|California mission]] system. Within a few years of their removal from the island, the Nicoleño people and their unique language became extinct.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===Lone Woman of San Nicolas Island===
{{main|Juana Maria}}
The most famous resident of San Nicolas Island was the "Lone Woman of San Nicolas Island", christened [[Juana Maria]]; her birth name was never known to anyone on the mainland. She was left behind (explanations for this vary) when the rest of the Nicoleños were moved to the mainland. She resided on the island alone for 18 years before she was found by Captain [[George Nidever]] and his crew in 1853 and taken to [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/great-reads/la-me-c1-cave-artifacts-20150305-story.html|title=With island dig halted, Lone Woman still a stinging mystery|work=Los Angeles Times|date=March 5, 2015|first=Louis|last=Sahagun}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her story is famously told in the award-winning children's novel ''[[Island of the Blue Dolphins]]'' by [[Scott O'Dell]].

===Whaling===
The [[Schooner|steam-schooner]] ''California'' and its two [[Whaler|whale catcher]]s ''Hawk'' and ''Port Saunders'' operated off San Nicolas in 1932 and 1937, catching about 30 [[fin whale]]s off the island from October to early December in the former year.&lt;ref&gt;''Pacific Fisherman'' (Vol. 31, 1933), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Pacific Fisherman'' (Vol. 35, 1937), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Munitions testing===
San Nicolas Island was one of eight candidate sites to detonate the first [[atomic bomb]] before [[White Sands Proving Ground]] was selected for the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity]] nuclear test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cddc.vt.edu/host/atomic/trinity/trinity1.html |title=Trinity Atomic Web Site |publisher=Walker, Gregory |accessdate=2010-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420093358/http://www.cddc.vt.edu/host/atomic/trinity/trinity1.html |archivedate=2010-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1957 and 1973, and in 2004 and 2010, U.S. military research [[rocket]]s were launched from San Nicolas Island. The launchpad was situated at {{Coord|33|15|51.4|N|119|32|20.4|W |region:US_type:isle |display=inline,title}}. It remains part of the [[Western Range|Pacific Missile Range]].

San Nicolas Island currently serves as a detachment of [[Naval Base Ventura County]]. In addition to Port Hueneme and Point Mugu, San Nicolas Island is military-owned and operated.

===Biota===

==== Flora ====
There is little ecological diversity on San Nicolas Island. The island was heavily grazed by sheep until they were removed in 1943. [[Overgrazing]] and [[erosion]] have removed much of the [[topsoil]] from the island. Despite the degradation, three [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] plants are found on the island: ''[[Astragalus traskiae]]'', ''[[Eriogonum grande]]'' subspecies ''timorum'', and ''[[Lomatium insulare]]''.

The dominant plant community on the island is coastal bluff [[scrubland]], with giant coreopsis (''[[Coreopsis gigantea]]'') and coyote brush (''[[Baccharis pilularis]]'') the most visible components. The few trees present today, including California fan palms (''[[Washingtonia filifera]]'') were introduced in modern times. However, early written accounts and the remains of ancient plants in the form of  [[calcareous]] root casts indicate that, prior to 1860, brush covered a portion of the island.&lt;ref&gt;Schoenherr, Allan A., C. Robert Feldmeth, and Michael J. Emerson. 2003. ''[[Natural History of the Islands of California]]'' (paperback), University of California Press, Berkeley. pp. 339-340.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fauna ====
[[File:Island Night Lizard, San Nicolas Island, California..JPG|thumb|Island night lizard.]]
There are only three species of endemic land [[vertebrates]] on the island; the [[island night lizard]] (''Xantusia riversiana''), [[deer mouse]] (''Peromyscus maniculatus exterus''), and [[island fox]] (''Urocyon littoralis dickeyi''). Two other reptiles, the [[common side-blotched lizard]] (''Uta stansburiana''), and the [[southern alligator lizard]] (''Elgaria multicarinatus''), were at one time thought to be endemic, but an analysis of [[mitochondrial DNA]] indicates that both species were most likely introduced in recent times.&lt;ref&gt;Schoenherr, Allan A., C. Robert Feldmeth, and Michael J. Emerson. 2003. ''Natural History of the Islands of California'' (paperback), University of California Press, Berkeley. pp. 342-347.&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 10 endemic [[Mollusca|molluscs]] are known only from San Nicolas Island. These are ''[[Binneya notabilis]]'', ''[[Catinella (gastropod)|Catinella]] rehderi'', ''[[Haplotrema]] [[Haplotrema duranti duranti|duranti duranti]]'', ''[[Micrarionta feralis]]'', ''[[Micrarionta]] [[Micrarionta Micromphala|micromphala]]'', ''[[Micrarionta opuntia|M. opuntia]]'', ''[[Micrarionta sodalis|M. sodalis]]'', ''[[Nearctula rowellii longii]]'', ''[[Sterkia clementina]]'', and ''[[Xerarionta tryoni|Xerarionta tyroni]]'' (ssp. ''tyroni'' and ''hemphilli'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magney.org/photos/Wildlife/Invertebrates/Mollusca/Atlas_of_Ventura_County_Native_Terrestrial_Snails.pdf] Atlas of Native California Terrestrial Snails in Ventura County &lt;/ref&gt;

Large numbers of birds can be found on San Nicolas Island. Two species are of particular ecological concern: the [[western gull]] (''Larus occidentalis'') and [[Brandt's cormorant]] (''Phalacrocorax penicillatus''), both of which are threatened by feral cats and island foxes.

The [[common housecat]] was one of the greatest threats to the island's wildlife until they were eradicated from the island.&lt;ref name=Chawkins&gt;{{cite news |title=Complex effort to rid San Nicolas Island of cats declared a success |author=Steve Chawkins |date=February 26, 2012 |work=Los Angeles Times |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-adv-san-nicolas-20120227,0,5323367.story |accessdate=February 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cats killed [[Cormorant|cormorants]], gulls, and the island night lizard.

''San Diego Union-Tribune'' December 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that there were no cats left by June 2010, but they weren't officially declared eradicated until 2012. Eradication efforts took 18 months and cost $3 million.&lt;ref name=Chawkins/&gt;

{{technical|date=November 2017}}

A geographic '''sink''' is a depression within an [[endorheic basin]] where water collects with no visible outlet.  Instead of [[discharge (hydrology)|discharging]], the collected water is lost due to evaporation and/or [[Standard penetration test|penetration]] (water sinking underground, e.g., to become [[groundwater]] in an [[aquifer]]).  If the sink has [[Karst topography|karstic terrain]], water will sink at a higher rate than the surface evaporation, and conversely if the lakebed or sink bed has a layer of soil that is largely impervious to water ([[hardpan]]), evaporation will predominate.  Since dry lakes in sinks with hardpan have little penetration, they require more severe aridity/heat to eliminate collected water at a comparable rate as for a similar sink with appreciable penetration.

Depending on losses, precipitation, and [[Inflow (hydrology)|inflow]] (e.g., a spring, a tributary, or flooding); the [[Hydrology|temporal result]] of a lake in a sink may be a persistent [[lake]], an [[Lake#How lakes disappear|intermittent lake]], a [[Dry lake|playa]] lake (temporarily covered with water), or an [[ephemeral]] lake.

The [[Strait of Georgia]] lies north of the San Juans. [[Puget Sound]] is the narrower waters south of the Strait of Juan de Fuca.]]

The '''Strait of Juan de Fuca''' (officially named '''Juan de Fuca Strait''' in Canada&lt;ref name=bcgnis&gt;{{Cite bcgnis|id=25888 |title=Juan de Fuca Strait}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a large body of water about {{convert|154|km|mi}} long&lt;ref name=gnis&gt;{{gnis|1526614|Strait of Juan de Fuca}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is the [[Salish Sea]]'s outlet to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The [[Canada–United States border|international boundary]] between [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]  runs down the center of the Strait.

It was named in 1787 by the [[maritime fur trade]]r [[Charles William Barkley]], captain of the ''[[Imperial Eagle (ship)|Imperial Eagle]]'', for [[Juan de Fuca]], the Greek navigator who sailed in a Spanish expedition in 1592 to seek the fabled [[Strait of Anián]]. Barkley was the first non-indigenous person to find the strait, unless Juan de Fuca's story was true.&lt;ref&gt;While {{gnis|1526614|Strait of Juan de Fuca}} says John Meares named the strait in 1788, most sources say it was Barkley in 1787, for example: {{Cite bcgnis|id=25888 |title=Juan de Fuca Strait}}; [http://www.secstate.wa.gov/History/timeline_detail.aspx?s=1540&amp;e=9 Existence of the Strait of Juan de Fuca confirmed by Captain Charles Barkley], Washington Secretary of State; {{cite book |last= Hayes |first= Derek |title= Historical Atlas of the Pacific Northwest: Maps of exploration and Discovery |year= 1999 |publisher= Sasquatch Books |isbn= 1-57061-215-3|pages= 16}} online at [https://books.google.com/books?id=sl57oHrVXGoC Google Books]; and {{cite book |last= Pethick |first= Derek |title= The Nootka Connection: Europe and the Northwest Coast 1790–1795 |year= 1980 |publisher= Douglas &amp; McIntyre |location= Vancouver |isbn= 0-88894-279-6 |pages= 24}} It is well established that Meares tried to take credit for much of Barkley's work.&lt;/ref&gt; The strait was explored in detail between 1789 and 1791 by [[Manuel Quimper]], [[José María Narváez]], [[Juan Carrasco (explorer)|Juan Carrasco]], [[Gonzalo López de Haro]], and [[Francisco de Eliza]].

==Definition==
The [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] defines the Strait of Juan de Fuca as a [[Channel (geography)|channel]].  It extends east from the Pacific Ocean between [[Vancouver Island]], [[British Columbia]], and the [[Olympic Peninsula]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], to [[Haro Strait]], San Juan Channel, [[Rosario Strait]], and [[Puget Sound]].  The Pacific Ocean boundary is formed by a line between [[Cape Flattery (Washington)|Cape Flattery]] and [[Tatoosh Island]], Washington, and Carmanah Point (Vancouver Island), British Columbia. Its northern boundary follows the shoreline of Vancouver Island from Carmanah Point to Gonzales Point, then follows a continuous line east to Seabird Point ([[Discovery Island (British Columbia)|Discovery Island]]), British Columbia, Cattle Point ([[San Juan Island]]), Washington, [[Iceberg Point]] ([[Lopez Island]]), Point Colville (Lopez Island), and then to Rosario Head ([[Fidalgo Island]]). The eastern boundary runs south from Rosario Head across [[Deception Pass]] to [[Whidbey Island]], then along the western coast of Whidbey Island to [[Point Partridge]], then across [[Admiralty Inlet]] to [[Point Wilson]] ([[Quimper Peninsula]]). The northern coast of the [[Olympic Peninsula]]  forms the southern boundary of the strait.&lt;ref name=gnis/&gt; In the eastern entrance to the Strait, the Race Rocks Archipelago is located in the high current zone halfway between Port Angeles, Washington, and Victoria, BC.

[[Image:Strait of San Juan de Fuca sunset.jpg|thumb|right|Sunset over the strait]]
Like the rest of the Salish Sea and surrounding regions, the climate of the Strait is disputed, with the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen system]] classifying it as [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]], but most regional climatologists preferring [[oceanic climate|oceanic]]. While the climate is mostly oceanic in nature, the dry summers result in the Mediterranean classification in the Köppen system. Rainfall ranges from over {{convert|2500|mm|in}} ([[temperate rainforest]]) conditions at the west end to as little as {{convert|410|mm|in}} at the east end, near [[Sequim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SEQUIM 2 E, WASHINGTON|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?wa7544}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it is exposed to the generally westerly winds and waves of the Pacific, seas and weather in Juan de Fuca Strait are, on average, rougher than in the more protected waters inland, thereby resulting in a number of [[Small-craft advisory|small-craft advisories]].

== Ferries ==
An international [[M/V Coho|vehicle ferry]] crosses the Strait from [[Port Angeles, Washington]] to [[Victoria, British Columbia]] several times each day, as do passenger ferries of the [[Washington State Ferry]] system, a seasonal [[Victoria Express|private ferry]] connecting Port Angeles with Victoria, and a private high-speed ferry between Victoria and [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]].

==Boundary dispute==
[[File:The Olympian Range, from Esquimalt (HS85-10-11325).jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Olympic Mountains of Washington as seen from the entrance to [[Esquimalt Harbour]], 1900, photo: [[John Wallace Jones]]]]This strait remains the subject of a maritime boundary dispute between Canada and the United States. The dispute is only over the seaward boundary extending {{convert|320|km|mi}} west from the mouth of the strait. The maritime boundary within the strait is not in dispute. Both governments have proposed a boundary based on the [[Equidistance principle|principle of equidistance]], but with different basepoint selections, resulting in small differences in the line. Resolution of the issue should be simple, but has been hindered because it might influence [[:Category:Canada–United States border disputes|other unresolved]] maritime boundary issues between Canada and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Charney |first= Jonathan I. |author2=David A.

==Salish Sea==
{{main|Salish Sea}}
In March 2008, the [[Chemainus First Nation]] proposed renaming the strait the "[[Salish Sea]]", an idea that reportedly met with approval by British Columbia's Aboriginal Relations Minister [[Mike de Jong]], who pledged to put it before the [[Executive Council of British Columbia|B.C. cabinet]] for discussion. Making ''Salish Sea'' official required a formal application to the [[Geographical Names Board of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Strait of Georgia could be renamed Salish Sea |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2008/03/09/bc-salish-sea-renamed.html |work=Canadian Press |publisher=CBC.ca |date=2008-03-09 |accessdate=2008-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A parallel American movement promoting the name had a different definition, combining of the Strait of Juan de Fuca and [[Puget Sound]] as well as the Strait of Georgia and related waters under the more general name ''Salish Sea''.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Macdonald Stewart, 2017. Views of the Salish Sea: One Hundred and Fifty Years of Change around the Strait of Georgia. Harbour Publishing Company Limited. pp. 13–15. {{ISBN|978-1-55017-804-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This latter definition was made official in 2009 by geographic boards of Canada and the United States.

In October 2009, the Washington State Board of Geographic Names approved the Salish Sea [[Toponymy|toponym]], not to replace the names of the Strait of Georgia, Puget Sound, and Strait of Juan de Fuca, but instead as a collective term for all three.&lt;ref name=adoption&gt;{{cite web | date =2009-10-30 | url =http://www.dnr.wa.gov/ResearchScience/News/Pages/nr09_177.aspx | title =STATE BOARD ON GEOGRAPHIC NAMES APPROVES ‘SALISH SEA’ | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131030002600/http://www.dnr.wa.gov/ResearchScience/News/Pages/nr09_177.aspx | archivedate =2013-10-30 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Columbia Geographical Names Office passed a resolution only recommending that the name be adopted by the [[Geographical Names Board of Canada]], should its US counterpart approve the name-change.&lt;ref name="adoption"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.straight.com/article-268225/washington-state-adopts-salish-sea-name-body-water-including-strait-georgia ''Washington state adopts “Salish Sea” name for body of water including Strait of Georgia'', Carlito Pablo, ''Georgia Straight'', October 30, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berger|first=Knute|authorlink=Knute Berger|title=Smooth Sailing for the Salish Sea?|date=October 20, 2009|publisher=''[[Crosscut.com|Crosscut]]''|url=http://crosscut.com/blog/crosscut/19058/|accessdate=August 13, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105034831/http://crosscut.com/blog/crosscut/19058/ |archivedate=January 5, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Board on Geographic Names]] approved the name on November 12, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berger|first=Knute|authorlink=Knute Berger|title=U.S. approves Salish Sea name|date=November 12, 2009|publisher=''[[Crosscut.com|Crosscut]]''|url=http://crosscut.com/blog/crosscut/19183/|accessdate=August 13, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227141029/http://crosscut.com/blog/crosscut/19183/ |archivedate=February 27, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2291">The '''Swedish grid''' (in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] '''Rikets Nät''', '''RT 90''') is the [[coordinate system]] used for government maps in [[Sweden]]. RT 90 is a slightly modified version of the RT 38 from 1938.

While the system could be used with [[negative numbers]] to represent all four "quarters" of the earth (NE, NW, SE, and SW hemispheres), the standard application of RT 90 is only useful for the northern half of the eastern hemisphere where numbers are positive. The coordinate system is based on metric measures rooting from the crossing of the [[Prime Meridian]] and the [[Equator]] at 0,0. The Central Meridian used to be based on a meridian located at the old observatory in Stockholm, but today it is based on the Prime Meridian at Greenwich. The numbering system's first digit represents the largest distance, followed by what can be seen as fractional decimal digits (though without an explicit decimal point). Therefore X 65 is located half way between X 6 and X 7.
The coordinate grid is specified using two numbers, named X and Y, X being the south–north axis and Y the west–east axis. Two seven-digit numbers are sufficient to specify a location with a one m resolution. 

Example:
X=6620000 Y=1317000 (X is the northing and Y is the easting) denotes a position 6620&amp;nbsp;km north of the Equator and -183&amp;nbsp;km (1317&amp;nbsp;km-1500&amp;nbsp;km) west of the Central Meridian, which happens to be somewhere near the town center of [[Arvika]].

==Historic numbering plan pre-1992==

Before 1992, telephone numbers would consist of a 2 or 3-digit area code, and a 5 or 6-digit subscriber number. Example: (067) 85 000 and (04) 66 00 00.
 
In that year, a [[closed telephone numbering plan]] was adopted, with eight-digit telephone numbers incorporating the area code and full number dialling for local and national calls. Service numbers were to be three digits long, Directory numbers four digits and some companies were allocated five-digit numbers, ex. 07575.
GSM telephony was introduced in 1993, and those numbers always start with the digit '4' or '9'.

==Emergency numbers==

Historically, the local operator would take emergency calls and forward them to the police, fire or local doctor. In 1964, the emergency number '''000''' was introduced. In 1985, a modernized emergency service was started at Haukeland hospital in Bergen for Hordaland. In 1986, the emergency numbers diverted to '''001''' for fire brigade, '''002''' for police and '''003''' for ambulance. These numbers changed to '''110''', '''112''' and '''113''' in 1994, when the international access code changed from '''095''' to '''00'''.

==Geographic numbers, 1993-present==
*'''2x xx xx xx''': Geographic numbers, mainly [[Oslo]]
*'''32 xx xx xx''': Geographic numbers in Buskerud and [[Jan Mayen]]
*'''33 xx xx xx''': Geographic numbers in Vestfold
*'''35 xx xx xx''': Geographic numbers in Telemark
*'''37 xx xx xx''': Geographic numbers in Aust-Agder
*'''38 xx xx xx''': Geographic numbers in Vest-Agder
*'''5x xx xx xx''' (except '''58''' and '''59'''): Geographic numbers in south-western counties, including [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]]
*'''6x xx xx xx''': Geographic numbers in south-eastern counties and [[Oppland]]
*'''7x xx xx xx''': Geographic numbers in the mid and north, from [[Møre og Romsdal]], [[Trøndelag]] ([[Trondheim]]) and northern Norway

==Non-geographic numbers==
*'''8xx xx xxx''': Non-geographical numbers ([[toll-free]], [[voicemail]], premium-numbers, television shows, etc.)
*'''0xxxx''': Non-geographical numbers (land-line rate). Common with e.g. taxi companies. Dialled from outside Norway as '''+47 0xxxx'''

==Mobile numbers==
*'''9xx xx xxx''': Mobile numbers (older)
*'''4xx xx xxx''': Mobile numbers (newer)
*'''58x xxx xxx xxx''': Mobile numbers ([[Machine-to-Machine|M2M]] traffic)
*'''59x xx xxx''': Mobile numbers (newer, M2M traffic)

==Emergency==
*'''110''': Fire brigade
*'''112''': Police
*'''113''': Ambulance

==Special numbers==
*'''00''': International prefix
*'''01''': Reserved for future changes 
*'''02xxx''' to '''09xxx''': 5-digit non-geographical numbers (these numbers are mostly equivalent to 815 non-geographical numbers, and can be acquired by any company or organization given availability and a yearly fee between NOK 3.300 and NOK 125.000 per year)
*'''100-189''': Standardized special numbers (emergency numbers, road and public transport information, etc.)
*'''19x''': Operator-specific special numbers 
*'''1850''' to '''1899''': Directory services
*'''116xxx''': [[Harmonised services of social value]]

'''Willem Janszoon Blaeu''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈʋɪləm ˈjɑnsoːm ˈblʌu}};&lt;ref&gt;''Janszoon'' in isolation: {{IPA-nl|ˈjɑnsoːn|}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 1571{{spaced ndash}}21 October 1638), also abbreviated to '''Willem Jansz. Blaeu''', was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[cartographer]], [[Atlas (cartography)|atlas]] maker and [[publisher]]. Along with his son [[Johannes Blaeu]], Willem is considered one of the notable figures of the [[Golden Age of Netherlandish cartography|Netherlandish/Dutch school of cartography]] in its golden age (the 16th and 17th centuries).

==Biography==
Blaeu was born at [[Uitgeest]] or [[Alkmaar]].  As the son of a well-to-do [[herring]] salesman, he was destined to succeed his father in the trade, but his interests lay more in [[mathematics]] and [[astronomy]]. Between 1594 and 1596, as a student of the [[Denmark|Danish]] [[astronomer]] [[Tycho Brahe]], he qualified as an instrument and [[globe]] maker.&lt;ref name=Withers-Lorimer&gt;{{cite book|last=Charles W. J. Withers|first=Hayden Lorimer|title=GEOGRAPHERS: BIOBIBLIOGRAPHICAL STUDIES, Volume 27|year=2008|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=1-84706-156-7|pages=14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pYowyxAHn-sC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=Willem+Blaeu&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=H5kqT6vzA4_kggeV-vD4Dw&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Willem%20Blaeu&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1600 he discovered the second ever [[variable star]], now known as [[P Cygni]].

Once he returned to [[Holland]], he made country maps and world globes, and as he possessed his own printing works, he was able to regularly produce country maps in an atlas format, some of which appeared in the ''[[Atlas Novus]]'' published in 1635. In 1633 he was appointed map-maker of the [[Dutch East India Company]]. He was also an editor and published works of [[Willebrord Snell]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Metius|Adriaan Metius]], [[Roemer Visscher]], [[Gerhard Johann Vossius]], [[Casparus Barlaeus|Barlaeus]], [[Grotius|Hugo Grotius]], [[Joost van den Vondel|Vondel]] and the historian and poet [[Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft]].  He died in [[Amsterdam]].

He had two sons, [[Joan Blaeu|Johannes]] and Cornelis Blaeu, who continued their father's mapmaking and publishing business after his death in 1638. Prints of the family's works are still sold today. Original maps are rare collector items.

[[File:1644 Europa Recens Blaeu.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Blaeu's 1630 map of Europe]] Blaeu's maps were featured in the works of the Dutch painter [[Johannes Vermeer]] of [[Delft]] (1632–1675), who holds a position of great honor among map historians. Several of his paintings illustrate maps hanging on walls or globes standing on tables or cabinets. Vermeer painted these cartographical documents with such detail that it is often possible to identify the actual maps. Evidently, Vermeer was particularly attached to a Willem Blaeu – Balthasar Florisz van Berckenrode map of [[Holland]] and [[West Friesland (historical region)|West Friesland]], as he represented it as a wall decoration in three of his paintings. Though no longer extant, the map's existence is known from archival sources and the second edition published by Willem Blaeu in 1621, titled ''Nova et Accurata Totius Hollandiae Westfriesiaeq. Topographia, Descriptore Balthazaro Florentio a Berke[n]rode Batavo''. Vermeer must have had a copy at his disposal (or the earlier one published by Van Berckenrode). Around 1658 he showed it as a wall decoration in his painting ''[[Officer and Laughing Girl]]'', which depicts a soldier in a large hat sitting with his back to viewer, talking with a smiling girl who holds a glass in her hand. Bright sunlight bathes the girl and the large map on the wall. Vermeer's gift for realism is evidenced by the fact that the wall map, mounted on linen and wooden rods, is identifiable as Blaeu's 1621 map of Holland and West Friesland. He captures faithfully its characteristic design, decoration, and geographic content.&lt;ref&gt;van der Krogt, Peter. 1998. "Vermeer's Blaeu Period." Mercator's World.
