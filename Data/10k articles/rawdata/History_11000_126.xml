On 23 October 1971 undercover soldiers from the [[British Army]] shot dead three unarmed Catholic civilians in disputed circumstances in [[Newry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=23&amp;month=10&amp;year=1971 |title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths |publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk |date=1971-10-23 |accessdate=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch71.htm#Oct |title=CAIN: Chronology of the Conflict 1971 |publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[The Troubles|The Irish Troubles]] broke out in August 1969 after the [[Battle of the Bogside]] and the [[1969 Northern Ireland riots|Belfast August 1969 riots]]. Soon after the [[British Army]] was called in to restore order but events quickly shaped the conflict into a three-way urban [[guerrilla war]] with [[Ulster Loyalism|Loyalist Paramilitaries]] like the [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF) on one side, [[Irish Republicanism|Irish Republican paramilitaries]] like the [[Provisional IRA]] (PIRA) on one side and the British state security services making up the other belligerent.

The killings in Newry on 23 October 1971 was one in a series of controversial incidents between 1970–1973 that involved the British Army shooting and killing Catholic [[Irish Nationalism|Irish Nationalist]] civilians. During the [[Falls Curfew]] of July 1970 the British Army killed four Catholic civilians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=text&amp;keyword=Falls%20Road%20curfew |title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths |publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the next year in August 1971 (when internment was being introduced) during the [[Ballymurphy Massacre]] they shot dead eleven civilians including a Catholic priest and a 50-year-old mother of eight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=9&amp;month=08&amp;year=1971 |title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths |publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous of these incidents was [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]] in January 1972 in which British paratroopers shot dead 14 civil rights protesters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=30&amp;month=01&amp;year=1972 |title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths |publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; later on that same year British army snipers shot dead five civilians and injured two more Catholic civilians in an event known as the [[Springhill massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=9&amp;month=07&amp;year=1972 |title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths |publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These and similar events hugely boosted recruitment into the [[Official IRA]] and Provisional IRA among the Nationalist/Catholic people of [[Northern Ireland]] and to help to intensify the conflict further.

==The shooting==

The shooting happened when the undercover British soldiers who were lying in wait on a rooftop across the street believed they saw a robbery taking place at a bank and assumed the robbers were members of the IRA, Sean Ruddy (19), Robert Anderson (25) and Thomas McLoughlin (27) were all shot dead. The British army said they had received information that the Provisional IRA was going to launch an operation in the area. However none of those killed were members of any paramilitary group and local eyewitness claim the men were just having an argument with someone inside the bank and were not in the process of robbing it and that the army simply shot the three men in cold blood without the men posing any serious risk to the soldiers or anybody else near the area. The shootings were carried out by the British Armies [[Royal Green Jackets]] regiment.
In 2011 the [[Historical Enquiries Team|Northern Ireland Historical Enquiries Team]] (HET) released its four-year investigation into the shooting.  The HET report concluded that the killings were "a tragedy that should not have happened".
The report found there to be a "question mark" over the British Army's conduct when the three men were shot dead by soldiers who were lying in wait on the roof of the nearby Woolworth's building. Arthur Ruddy, brother of Sean Ruddy and a former nationalist councillor, said the four-year-long investigation by the Historical Enquiries Team had vindicated the family, who always maintained the 19-year-old's killing was unlawful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://republican-news.org/current/news/2011/12/deaths_of_three_newry_national.html#.WINidrkrBlM |title=Deaths of three Newry nationalists 'a tragedy' - Irish Republican News - Fri, Dec 2, 2011 |publisher=Republican-news.org |date=2011-12-02 |accessdate=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was intense rioting by the nationalist community in Newry for several days after the killing of the three men, with people directing their anger towards soldiers by throwing stones and in some cases petrol bombs at them. During the funerals of the men killed most shops in the town closed out of respect to the dead men, except for the bank were the men had been shot at and the local post office. Both of these had their windows broken by youths throwing stones through them. After this there were further clashes with locals and the army, with the army firing CS gas and rubber bullets at the mourners. &lt;ref&gt;[https://issuu.com/glenravel/docs/issue_07/52 The Troubles 7], by Joe Baker - issuu&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[[Eamon Collins]] (1997) - Killing Rage pp, 44-45&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://belfastchildis.com/2015/10/22/23rd-october-deaths-events-in-northern-ireland-troubles/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://seachranaidhe1.blog/category/murdered-by-the-british-army/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shootings in Belfast==
On the same day as the Newry Killings the [[Provisional IRA]]'s first two female volunteers were killed by the British Army or RUC. Maura Meehan (30) and Dorothy Maguire (19), were shot dead by the British Army (BA) in the Lower Falls area of Belfast. The Army said shots came from the car first &amp; the army returned fire. IRA [[Belfast Brigade]] commander said the two women had been travelling the area warning people of British Army raids on houses. &lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/23/newsid_2489000/2489157.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Predicted/scheduled events==
===Extrapolations===
*3000: [[Sea level]] was predicted to rise by  between {{convert|1.1 and 6.8|m|ft|0}} by the year 3000 in a 2012 study.&lt;ref&gt;H Goelzer, P Huybrechts, S C B Raper, M-F Loutre, H Goosse, T Fichefet. Millennial total sea-level commitments projected with the Earth system model of intermediate complexity LOVECLIM. Environmental Research Letters, 2012; 7 (4): 045401, {{doi|10.1088/1748-9326/7/4/045401}}.
"The research showed that we have already committed ourselves to a sea-level rise of 1.1 metres by the year 3000 as a result of our greenhouse gas emissions up to now. This irreversible damage could be worse, depending on the route we take to mitigating our emissions. If we were to follow the high A2 emissions scenario adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a sea-level rise of 6.8 metres could be expected in the next thousand years. The two other IPCC scenarios analysed by the researchers, the B1 and A1B scenarios, yielded sea-level rises of 2.1 and 4.1 metres respectively."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3170">'''Adolf Büchler''' (also Adolph) (October 18, 1867, at [[Priekopa]], [[Hungary]] (now [[Slovakia]]) – 1939) was an Austro-Hungarian [[rabbi]], historian and [[Jewish theologian|theologian]].

In 1887 he began his theological studies at the [[Rabbinical Seminary of Budapest]],&lt;ref name="JOH"&gt;{{cite book|last=Patai|first=Raphael|title=The Jews of Hungary:History, Culture, Psychology|publisher=Wayne State University Press|location=400|year=1996|pages=730|isbn=0-8143-2561-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LLuPS1yVDf8C&amp;pg=PA400&amp;dq=%22Budapest+Rabbinical+Seminary%22&amp;ei=1YXrSazgJJq0MaaOgOoF&amp;client=firefox-a}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the same time studied in the Department of Philosophy of the university under [[Ignác Goldziher]] and Moritz Kármán. Büchler continued his studies at the [[Breslau Seminary]] and in 1890 graduated ''with a PhD'' from [[Leipzig University]], his dissertation being ''Zur Entstehung der Hebräischen Accente'', which was later published in the ''Sitzungsberichte der Wiener Akademie der Wissenschaften'' of 1891.

Büchler returned to [[Budapest]] to finish his theological studies and graduated as a rabbi in 1892. He then went to [[Oxford]] for one year, where he worked under the direction of his uncle, [[Adolf Neubauer]] and published an essay, ''"The Reading of the Law and Prophets in a Triennial Cycle"''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Jewish Quarterly Review]]'', April, 1893.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year he accepted a position as instructor at the Vienna Jewish Theological Seminary, teaching [[Jewish history]], the [[Hebrew Bible|Bible]] and the [[Talmud]]. Büchler became Principal of [[Jews' College]] in London in 1906.

The '''Ahnenerbe''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʔaːnənˌʔɛʁbə|lang}}, ''ancestral heritage'') was a [[think tank]] that operated in [[Nazi Germany]] between 1935 and 1945. It was an appendage of the [[Schutzstaffel]] (SS) and had been established by [[Heinrich Himmler]], the [[Reichsführer-SS|Reichsführer]] of the SS. It was devoted to the task of promoting the racial doctrines espoused by [[Adolf Hitler]] and his governing [[Nazi Party]], specifically by supporting the idea that the modern Germans descended from an ancient [[Aryan race]] which was biologically superior to other racial groups. The group comprised scholars and scientists from a broad range of academic disciplines.

Hitler came to power in 1933 and over the following years he converted Germany into a [[one-party state]] under the control of his Nazi Party and governed by his personal dictatorship. He espoused the idea that modern Germans descended from the ancient Aryans, who he claimed—in contrast to established academic understandings of prehistory—had been responsible for most major developments in human history such as agriculture, art, and writing. His racial theories and claims about prehistory were not accepted by the majority of the world's scholarly community, and a decision was taken to give them greater scholarly backing. The Ahnenerbe was established with the purpose of providing evidence for Nazi racial doctrine and to promote these ideas to the German public through books, articles, exhibits, and conferences. Ahnenerbe scholars interpreted evidence to fit Hitler's beliefs, and some consciously fabricated evidence to do so; many of their ideas are regarded as [[pseudoscience]]. The organisation sent out various expeditions to other parts of the world, intent on finding evidence of ancient Aryan expansion.

The Nazi government used the Ahnenerbe's research to justify many of their policies. For instance, the think tank's claim that archaeological evidence indicated that the ancient Aryans lived across eastern Europe was cited in justification of German military expansion into that region. Ahnenerbe research was also cited in justification of the [[Holocaust]], the mass killing of Jews and other groups—including Roma and homosexuals—through [[extermination camps]] and other methods. In 1937 the project was renamed the Research and Teaching Community of the Ancestral Heritage (''Forschungs- und Lehrgemeinschaft des Ahnenerbe''). Some of the group's investigations were placed on hold at the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in 1939. Towards the end of the war, Ahnenerbe members destroyed much of the organisation's paperwork to avoid it incriminating them in forthcoming war crimes tribunals. 

Many Ahnenerbe members escaped the [[de-Nazification]] policies in West Germany and remained active in the country's archaeological establishment throughout the post-war decades. This stifled scholarly research into the Ahnenerbe, which only intensified after [[German reunification]] in 1990. The Ahnenerbe's ideas have remained popular in some [[neo-Nazi]] and far-right circles and have also influenced later [[pseudoarchaeology|pseudo-archaeologists]].

==Background==

[[File:Hitler portrait crop.jpg|thumb|right|Adolf Hitler, whose beliefs about the development of the human species inspired the Ahnenerbe's research]]

Hitler believed that humanity could be divided into three groups: "the founders of culture, the bearers of culture, the destroyers of culture".{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=3}} The founders of culture, in Hitler's view, were a biologically distinct [[Aryan race]] who he believed had been tall, blonde, and originating in Northern Europe. He believed that in prehistory, the Aryan race had been responsible for all significant developments in human culture, including agriculture, architecture, music, literature, and the visual arts.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|pp=3–4}} He believed that most modern Germans were the descendants of these Aryans and had genetically inherited the Aryans' biological superiority to other races.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=4}} The destroyers of culture, in Hitler's view, were the [[Jews]], whom he regarded not as a genetically diverse population sharing certain ethno-cultural and religious traits—as they were then widely recognised—but as a unified, biologically distinct race. He believed that wherever Jews went, they damaged and ultimately destroyed the cultures surrounding them.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=4}}

Hitler had promoted his ideas about the greatness of Germany's ancestors in his 1925 book, ''[[Mein Kampf]]''.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=24}} Outside Germany, most scholars and scientists regarded Hitler's ideas about human evolution and prehistory as nonsense, in part due to the absence of any evidence that North European communities had ever been responsible for major developments in prehistory, such as the development of agriculture and writing, all of which first appeared in the Near East and Asia.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=4}}

In January 1929, Hitler appointed another senior Nazi Party member, [[Heinrich Himmler]], to head the [[Schutzstaffel]] (SS), a paramilitary group designed to serve as personal bodyguards to Hitler and other Nazis.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=37}} Himmler set out to re-organise the SS, introducing a better system of organisation, and gathering intelligence on prominent Jews and [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]], as well as on rival political groups.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|pp=37–38}} In 1929, Himmler launched an SS recruitment campaign,{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=38}} and by the end of 1931 it had 10,000 members.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=41}} He was intent on ensuring that this membership was as racially [[Nordic race|Nordic]] as possible, establishing the [[SS Race and Settlement Main Office]] (RuSHA) to screen both applicants and the women whom SS members proposed to marry.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|pp=41–42}} In believing in the existence of a "Nordic" racial type which was the purest survival of the ancient Aryans, Himmler was influenced by the Nordicist ideas of [[Hans F. K. Günther]], which had been popular in [[German nationalist]] circles over the preceding decades.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|pp=35–6}}

Himmler had an abiding interest in the past, and in how it could provide a blueprint for the future.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=16}} However, his views of the ancient Germanic peoples differed from Hitler's in certain areas. Hitler was perplexed as to why ancient societies in southern Europe had developed more advanced technology and architecture than their contemporaries in northern Europe. He stated that "People make a tremendous fuss about the excavations carried out in districts inhabited by our forebears of the pre-Christian era. I am afraid that I cannot share their enthusiasm, for I cannot help remembering that, while our ancestors were making these vessels out of stone and clay, over which our archaeologists rave, the Greeks had already built the Acropolis."{{sfn|Pringle|2006|pp=44–45}} He explained this by claiming that the Aryans must also have inhabited the south of the continent and that they were responsible for establishing the societies of ancient Greece and Rome. Specifically, he believed that it was the warmer climates of the south that enabled these Aryans to develop in ways that those living further north, in colder and wetter climates, did not.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=44}} Himmler was aware of these views but, unlike Hitler, admired what he believed was the fierceness and valour of the Germanic tribes of northern Europe.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=45}} He was particularly interested in ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', a book about the Iron Age Germanic tribes which had been written by the Roman writer [[Tacitus]] in the first century CE.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=16}} 

===The Nazi Party takes power===

In the [[German federal election, July 1932|1932 federal election]], the Nazis secured 230 seats in the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]], making then the largest single party but without a controlling majority.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=43}} Six months later, President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] invited Hitler to become [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]], after which he cemented Nazi dominance. In February 1933, Hitler convinced von Hindenburg to declare a [[state of emergency]], which brought with it the legal suspension of [[civil liberties]].{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=43}} Himmler, who was newly appointed as the police chief of [[Munich]], ordered the arrests of those he regarded as a threat to the Nazis—including journalists, labour organisers, Jewish community leaders, socialists, and communists—and their incarceration in [[Dachau concentration camp]].{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=43}} Hitler approved of Himmler's tactics and appointed him head of the political police across Germany.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=44}}

[[File:Wewelsburg.JPG|thumb|left|Wewelsburg Castle, which Himmler adopted as an SS base on the advice of the occultist Karl Maria Wiligut]]

In 1933, Himmler initiated plans to establish a "Nordic Academy" to assist the instruction of the SS upper ranks.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=46}} He was assisted in this by [[Karl Maria Wiligut]], an [[occultism|occultist]] who was popular in German ultra-nationalist circles.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=46}} Himmler brought Wiligut into the SS—where he eventually rose to the rank of [[Brigadeführer]]—and gave him a private villa in Berlin.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|pp=48–49}}
Using Wiligut's prophecies as his guide, Himmler selected [[Wewelsburg]] castle in [[Province of Westphalia|Westphalia]] to serve as a base for many SS operations.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=48}} The architect [[Hermann Bartels]] was employed to oversee renovations to the castle to make it fit for the SS's use.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=49}} As part of these alterations, one of the rooms in the building became known as "the Grail Room" with a rock crystal representing the [[Holy Grail]] being placed in a central position.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=49}} Himmler also established a private museum at the castle, employing the young archaeologist [[Wilhelm Jordan (archaeologist)|Wilhelm Jordan]] to manage it.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=49}}

In 1934, Himmler met the Dutch prehistorian [[Herman Wirth]], who was then living in Germany, at the home of [[Johann von Leer]], a Nazi propagandist.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=55}}
Wirth was one of the most controversial prehistorians in Germany.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=54}} After examining symbols found in rural Frisian [[folk art]], he became convinced that they represented the survival of an ancient script used by a prehistoric Nordic civilisation. This script—Wirth believed—was the world's oldest written language and had been the basis for all other ancient scripts. He also believed that if he could decipher it then he would learn the nature of the ancient religion of the Aryan race.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|pp=54–55, 58}} This belief conflicted with established scholarly understandings of the past; by the 1930s, scholars were aware that the world's two oldest scripts were those of Mesopotamia and Egypt, and that northern Europe only developed its own form of literacy, that of the [[runes]], under the influence of [[Etruscan script]] between 400 BCE to 50 CE. Attempting to explain the lack of any archaeological or historical evidence for an ancient advanced Nordic civilisation, Wirth claimed that the Aryans had evolved in an Arctic homeland two million years ago, before establishing their advanced society on a land in the North Atlantic which had since sunken into the sea, giving rise to the stories about [[Atlantis]].{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=59}}

Wirth's ideas were rejected and ridiculed by the German archaeological establishment, although they had gained the support of several wealthy backers, which assisted him in promoting them.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=61}} Himmler was among those who liked Wirth's ideas. Himmler was interested in the pre-Christian religions of northern Europe, believing that a [[Modern Paganism|modern Pagan religion]] modelled on them could replace Christianity as the primary religion of the German people.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=56}} Himmler disliked Christianity because of its Semitic origins, its presentation of [[Jesus of Nazareth]] as a Jew, and its advocacy of charity and compassion.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=56}} Later, Himmler privately told his personal physician that after the Second World War, "the old Germanic gods will be restored".{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=56}}

==History==

===Formation===
[[File:Emblem_SS_Ahnenerbe.png|thumb|Ahnenerbe [[Irminsul]] symbol]]

On 1 July 1935, Himmler organised a meeting at the Berlin headquarters of the SS where he discussed his desire to launch a prehistoric research institute.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=50}} Both Wirth and the agriculturalist [[Richard Walther Darré]] were present, and both responded with enthusiasm to the idea.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=50}} The group was launched as a department of RuSHA.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=51}}
Wirth became the group's president, while Himmler took the role of superintendent, a position entailing considerable control by placing him in charge of its board of trustees.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=51}} Its formal goal was "to promote the science of ancient intellectual history".{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=51}}

The organisation was initially named the "Deutsches Ahnenerbe" Studiengesellschaft für Geistesurgeschichte (Society for the Study of the History of Primeval Ideas", but this was soon shortened to Ahnenerbe.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=51}} This was a German term for "something inherited from the forefathers".{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=2}}
The Ahnenerbe's first premises were at number 29 and 30 of the Brüderstrasse, a thirteenth-century street in Berlin. These corner buildings were rented from the city's [[department store]] magnate [[Rudolf Herzog]].{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=53}} Initially, it employed seven members of staff.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=53}} Reflecting Wirth's fixation on the idea of an ancient Aryan script, the organisation's early focus was upon what Wirth called "script and symbol studies".{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=54}} One of its researchers, [[Yrjö von Grönhagen]], was for instance tasked with collecting the Finnish wooden calendars which were engraved with various symbols.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=54}}

Starting in 1934, Himmler began financially supporting and visiting excavations in Germany. This brought him into contact with archaeologists like {{Interlanguage link multi|Alexander Langsdorff|de}}, [[Hans Schleif]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Werner Buttler|de}} and [[Wilhelm Unverzagt]], director of the ''[[Museum für Vor- und Frühgeschichte (Berlin)|Staatliches Museum für Vor- und Frühgeschichte]]'' in Berlin. Initially, there were two departments within the SS engaged in archaeology: the ''Abteilung Ausgrabungen'' of the ''Persönlicher Stab des Reichsführers der SS'' and the ''Abteilung für Vor- und Frühgeschichte'' at the RuSHA. The latter ("RA IIIB") was established in 1934 and was supposed to serve as a "general staff" for all SS activities related to prehistory. It was responsible for archaeological research and related propaganda and led by Rolf Höhne, a geologist. Höhne was eventually replaced by Peter Paulsen, an archaeologist, in October 1937. The department did not conduct any excavations itself, but was intended to extend the influence of the SS over other institutions, especially those responsible for education/research and monument preservation. In fact, Langsdorff did this in Himmler's personal staff. The department also tried to make use of pre-history in the training and indoctrination of SS members. When the RuSHA was restructured, the department was dissolved with its responsibilities passing to the ''Ahnenerbe''. The ''Abteilung Ausgrabung'' in Himmler's personal staff was established in 1935 on the initiative of Langsdorff. In March 1937, Höhne joined the leadership of this department. By 1937, it was responsible for SS excavations and maintained its own personnel for this activity.&lt;ref name="Katalog2"&gt;{{Citation | last1 =Halle| first1 =Uta|last2 =Mahsarski | first2 =Dirk | contribution = Forschungsstrukturen| year =2013 | title = Graben für Germanien – Archäologie unterm Hakenkreuz| editor-last = Focke-Museum, Bremen| editor-first = | volume = | pages = 57–64| place = | publisher =Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft | isbn=978-3-534-25919-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ahnenerbe was, according to historian [[Heather Pringle]], "an elite Nazi research institute".{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=2}} Its official mission as twofold. Its first purpose was to reveal new evidence for the accomplishments of the ancestors of the modern Germans "using exact scientific methods".{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=2}} Its second purpose was to convey its findings to the German public through magazine articles, books, museum exhibits, and scholarly conferences.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|pp=2–3}}
According to Pringle, it was however "in the business of myth-making", repeatedly "distorting the truth and churning out carefully tailored evidence to support the racial ideas of Adolf Hitler."{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=3}} Some members of the Ahnenerbe consciously altered their evidence and interpretations to match Hitler's beliefs; others appear to have been unaware of how their adherence to Nazi doctrine was shaping their interpretations.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=3}}

Himmler regarded the Ahnenerbe as an elite [[think tank]] which would sweep away previous scholarship on the development of humanity and reveal that Hitler's ideas on the subject were true.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=5}}
Himmler also believed that the group's investigations might reveal ancient secrets about agriculture, medicine, and warfare which would benefit Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=5}}
It employed scholars from a wide range of academic fields, including [[archaeology]], [[anthropology]], [[ethnology]], [[folkloristics]], [[runology]], [[Classics]], [[history]], [[musicology]], [[philology]], [[biology]], [[zoology]], [[botany]], [[astronomy]], and medicine.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=5}} Himmler believed that scholars active in all of these different fields would piece together a view of the past that would revolutionise established interpretations; in his words, it would represent "hundreds of thousands of little mosaic stones, which portray the true picture of the origins of the world."{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=5}}

On July 1, 1935, at SS headquarters in [[Berlin]], Himmler met with five "racial experts" representing Darré and with [[Herman Wirth]], one of Germany’s most famous but also most controversial prehistorians. Together they established an organization called the "German Ancestral Heritage—Society for the Study of the History of Primeval Ideas" (''Deutsches Ahnenerbe—Studiengesellschaft für Geistesurgeschichte''), shortened to its better-known form in 1937. At the meeting they designated its official goal, “to promote the science of ancient intellectual history,” and appointed Himmler as its superintendent, with Wirth serving as its president. Himmler appointed [[Wolfram Sievers]] ''Generalsekretär'' (General Secretary) of the Ahnenerbe.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S72707, Heinrich Himmler.jpg|thumb|left|Heinrich Himmler, ''[[Reichsführer-SS]]'' and founder of the Ahnenerbe]]

Through 1937, the Ahnenerbe was essentially engaged in amateur ''völkisch'' research. Financial and academic pressure caused Himmler to start looking for an alternative to Wirth as early as the spring of 1936. In September, Hitler negatively referred to Wirth's beliefs regarding [[Atlantis]] and their influence on "[[Böttcherstrasse]] architecture" in a speech at the Reichsparteitag.&lt;ref name="Katalog2"/&gt;

In March 1937, the Ahnenerbe was given a new statute, implementing the ''[[Führerprinzip]]'' and giving Himmler extensive powers. Wirth was deposed as president and appointed honorary president, a powerless position. Himmler's position as ''Kurator'' was given more power.&lt;ref name="Katalog2"/&gt;

[[Walther Wüst]] was appointed the new president of the Ahnenerbe. Wüst was an expert on India and a dean at [[Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich]], working on the side as a [[Glossary of the Weimar Republic|Vertrauensmann]] for the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (SD, SS Security Service). Referred to as ''The Orientalist'' by Wolfram Sievers, Wüst had been recruited by him in May 1936 because of his ability to simplify science for the common man.&lt;ref name="Pringle"&gt;{{Citation |author-link=Heather Pringle |last=Pringle |first=Heather |title=The Master Plan: Himmler’s Scholars and the Holocaust |publisher=Hyperion |year=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ATmZAAAAQBAJ&amp;q=1931#v=snippet&amp;q=1931&amp;f=false |page=307 |isbn=1401383866 |format=Google Book, search inside}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  After being appointed president, Wüst began improving the Ahnenerbe, moving the offices to a new headquarters that cost 300,000 [[German reichsmark|Reichsmark]] in the [[Steglitz-Zehlendorf|Dahlem neighborhood]] of Berlin. He also worked to limit the influence of “those he deemed scholarly upstarts,” which included cutting communication with the RuSHA office of [[Karl Maria Wiligut]].&lt;ref name=Pringle/&gt;

The ''Generalsekretariat'' led by Sievers was turned into the institution's ''Reichsgeschäftsführung''. The Ahnenerbe was renamed ''Forschungs- und Lehrgemeinschaft Das Ahnenerbe e.V.''. It was moved from the RuSHA to Himmlers's personal staff.&lt;ref name="Katalog2"/&gt;

Wirth and [[Wilhelm Teudt]] lost their departments in Ahnenerbe in 1938. In 1939, the statutes were changed again and Wirth was deposed as honorary president. Himmler's and Wüsts' titles were switched—Himmler now became president. Next to Wüst, the academic with most influence in the institution after 1939 was [[Herbert Jankuhn]], who in 1937 still had categorically rejected cooperation with the "unscientific" Ahnenerbe.&lt;ref name="Katalog2"/&gt;

Ahnenerbe was a mix between an SS department and an ''[[Eingetragener Verein]]''. Membership was open to all natural and legal persons. Its staff were SS members, many also working in other SS positions, and thus subject to SS jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="Katalog2"/&gt;

In late 1936, Ahnenerbe took over the publication of Teudt's magazine ''Germanien'', first in cooperation with Teudt, then without him. The monthly now became the official voice of Ahnenerbe and was aimed at a wider audience. From December 1936, the magazine was distributed free of charge to all SS leaders.&lt;ref name="Katalog2"/&gt;

Cooperation with other SS departments was initially limited but improved after 1937. Contacts with the SD-HA and the editorial team of the SS weekly ''Das schwarze Korps'' intensified. Ahnenerbe eventually had the scientific responsibility for the ''SS-Leithefte'' and in conjunction with the [[SS-Hauptamt|SS-HA]], Ahnenerbe established ''[[Germanische Leitstelle]]'' and ''Germanischer Wissenschaftseinsatz''.&lt;ref name="Katalog2"/&gt;

In 1939, the Ahnenerbe held its first independent annual convention, at Kiel. The event's success contributed to the trend that archaeologists were increasingly turning to the Ahnenerbe and away from [[Alfred Rosenberg]]'s rival ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Reichsbund für Deutsche Vorgeschichte|de|3=Deutsche Gesellschaft für Vorgeschichte}}''.&lt;ref name="Katalog2"/&gt;

In fiscal year 1938/39, the budget for the excavations department was 65,000 Reichsmark, about 12% of the Ahnenerbe's total budget. More than a third of that went to the [[Haithabu]] activities. Under Jankuhn's direction four more archaeological departments were set up: in April 1938 the ''Forschungsstätte für naturwissenschaftliche Vorgeschichte'' (a laboratory for analyzing pollen) was established at Dahlem under the leadership of {{Interlanguage link multi|Rudolf Schütrumpf|de}}. The ''Forschungsstätte für Wurtenforschung'' at Wilhelmshaven led by {{Interlanguage link multi|Werner Haarnagel|de}}, the ''Forschungsstätte für germanisches Bauwesen'' led by Martin Rudolph and the ''Forschungsstätte für Urgeschichte'' directed by {{Interlanguage link multi|Assien Bohmers|de}} followed in 1939.&lt;ref name="Katalog2"/&gt;

The organization was incorporated into the [[Allgemeine SS]] (General SS) in January 1939.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

As a gift for Hitler's fiftieth birthday, among the presents which Himmler procured for him was a set of leather bound books, one of which was on the subject of the Ahnenerbe's research.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=2}}

The Ahnenerbe sought to cultivate an air of professional integrity.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=12}}
The Ahnenerbe became an integral part of the SS.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=3}}
By 1939, the Ahnenerbe employed 137 scholars and scientists, as well as 82 support workers, including artists, photographers, laboratory technicians, librarians, accountants, and secretaries.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=3}}

===The Holocaust===

Himmler used the Ahnenerbe's research to fuel and justify the Holocaust.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=5}} In a 1937 speech at [[Bad Tölz]], Himmler announced that the [[bog bodies]] of northwestern Europe, which testified to an Iron Age tradition in which individuals were deliberately killed and deposited in bogs, must have represented the eradication of homosexuals.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|pp=6–7}} This was an idea that he had adopted from Ahnenerbe archaeologist [[Herbert Jankuhn]].{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=7}} His adoption of this suggestion was linked to his [[homophobia|homophobic]] fear that male homosexuality was transmittable and that it could spread within the ranks of the SS and other spaces of male bonding unless strong measures were implemented to prevent it.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=6}} Himmler then claimed this alleged ancient tradition as legitimation for the extermination of homosexuals within his own society.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=7}} As many as 15,000 gay men were [[Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust|rounded up and imprisoned in concentration camps]], where up to 60 percent died.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=7}}

=== The Second World War ===

Amid the [[Invasion of Poland|German invasion of Poland]], the Ahnenerbe sent a team into [[Warsaw]] to remove any items from its museums which they believed to be German in origin.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=12}}
At the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, the Ahnenerbe's further four planned expeditions—to Iran, the Canary Islands, the Andes, and Iceland—were indefinitely postponed.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=11}}

At the end of the war, members of the Ahnenerbe destroyed much of the organisation's paperwork lest it incriminate them during future war crime tribunals.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=9}}

===Institutes===
{{main|List of Ahnenerbe institutes}}
The Ahnenerbe had several different institutes or sections for its departments of research. Most of these were archeological but others included the Pflegestätte für Wetterkunde (Meteorology Section) headed by Obersturmführer Dr [[Hans Robert Scultetus]], founded on the basis that [[Hanns Hörbiger]]'s ''[[Welteislehre]]'' could be used to provide accurate long-range weather forecasts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Gratzer| first = Walter Bruno| title = The Undergrowth of Science: Delusion, Self-deception, and Human Frailty| year = 2001| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-860435-8| pages = 235–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a section devoted to [[musicology]], whose aim was to determine "the essence" of German music. It recorded folk music on expeditions to Finland and the Faroe Islands, from ethnic Germans of the occupied territories, and in South Tyrol. The section made sound recordings, transcribed manuscripts and songbooks, and photographed and filmed instrument use and folk dances. The [[lur]], a Bronze Age musical instrument, became central to this research, which concluded that Germanic [[tonality|consonance]] was in direct conflict to Jewish [[atonalism]].

==Expeditions==

===Karelia===
In 1935, Himmler contacted a Finnish nobleman and author, [[Yrjö von Grönhagen]], after seeing one of his articles about the [[Kalevala]] folklore in a Frankfurt newspaper. Grönhagen agreed to lead an expedition through the [[Karelia]] region of [[Finland]] to record pagan [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerers]] and [[witch]]es. Because there was uncertainty about whether the Karelians would allow photography, the Finnish illustrator Ola Forsell also accompanied the team. Musicologist {{Interlanguage link multi|Fritz Bose|de}} brought along a [[magnetophon]], hoping to record pagan chants.

The team departed on their expedition in June 1936. Their first success was with a traditional singer, {{Interlanguage link multi|Timo Lipitsä|fi}}, who knew a song closely resembling one in the [[Kalevala]] although he was unaware of the book. Later, in [[Tolvajärvi]], the team photographed and recorded Hannes Vornanen playing a traditional Finnish [[kantele]].

One of the team’s final successes was in finding Miron-Aku, a [[psychic|soothsayer]] believed to be a witch by locals. Upon meeting the group, she claimed to have foreseen their arrival. The team persuaded her to perform a ritual for the camera and tape recorder in which she summoned the spirits of ancestors and "divine[d] future events." The team also recorded information on [[Finnish sauna]]s.

===Bohuslän===
[[File:WirthBookScan.jpg|thumb|upright|Scan from Wirth's 1931 book ''Was Heisst Deutsch?'']]
After a slide show on February 19, 1936, of his trip to [[Bohuslän]], a region in southwestern Sweden, Wirth convinced Himmler to launch an expedition to the region, the first official expedition financed by the Ahnenerbe. Bohuslän was known for its massive quantity of [[petroglyph]] rock carvings, which Wirth believed were evidence of an ancient writing system predating all known systems. Himmler appointed Wolfram Sievers to be the managing director of the expedition, likely because of Wirth’s earlier troubles balancing finances.&lt;ref name=Pringle/&gt;{{Rp | needed = yes | date = September 2013}}

On August 4, 1936, the expedition set off on a three-month trip, starting at the German island of [[Rügen]], then continuing to [[Lysekil|Backa]], the first recorded rock-art site in Sweden. Despite the existence of scenes showing warriors, animals and ships, Wirth focused on the lines and circles that he thought made up a prehistoric alphabet. While his studies were largely based on personal belief, rather than objective scientific research, Wirth made interpretations of the meanings of [[ideograms]] carved in the rock, such as a circle bisected by a vertical line representing a year and a man standing with raised arms representing what Wirth called “the Son of God.”&lt;ref name= Pringle/&gt;{{Rp | needed = yes | date = September 2013}}  His team proceeded to make casts of what Wirth deemed the most important carvings and then carried the casts to camp, where they were crated and sent back to Germany. Once satisfied with their work at the site, the team set out on a trek through Sweden, eventually reaching the Norwegian island of [[Lauvøylandet]].

===Italy===
[[File:Iscrizione in alfabeto camuno - Parco di Naquane R 50 - Capo di Ponte (Foto Luca Giarelli).jpg|thumb|left|[[Camunic language|Camunic runes]] in [[Val Camonica]]]]
In 1937, the Ahnenerbe sent the archaeologist [[Franz Altheim]] and his wife, the photographer Erika Trautmann, to [[Val Camonica]], to study [[Rock Drawings in Valcamonica|prehistoric rock inscriptions]]. The two returned to Germany claiming that they had found traces of Nordic runes on the rocks, supposedly confirming that ancient Rome was founded by Nordic incomers.
Also, an expedition to [[Sardinia]] was planned in the 1930s, but the reasons for it still remain unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=Italian |website=academia.edu |url=https://www.academia.edu/1481114/040_Sardegna_ariana |title=XENOI Immagine e parola tra razzismi antichi e moderni}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Eurasia===
In 1938, [[Franz Altheim]] and his research partner Erika Trautmann requested the Ahnenerbe sponsor their expedition from [[Central Europe]] through [[Western Asia]] to study an internal power struggle of the Roman Empire, which they believed was fought between the Nordic and Semitic peoples.  Eager to credit the vast success of the Roman Empire to people of a Nordic background, the Ahnenerbe agreed to match the 4,000 Reichsmark put forward by [[Hermann Göring]], an old friend of Trautmann's.&lt;ref name=Pringle/&gt;{{Rp | needed = yes | date = September 2013}}

In August 1938, after spending a few days traveling through remote hills searching for ruins of [[Dacians|Dacian]] kingdoms, the two researchers arrived at their first major stop in [[Bucharest]], the capital of [[Romania]]. There Grigore Florescu, the director of the Municipal Museum, met with them, and discussed both history and the politics of the day, including the activities of the [[Iron Guard]].

After traveling through [[Istanbul]], [[Athens]], and [[Lebanon]], the researchers went to [[Damascus]]. They were not welcomed by the [[France|French]], who ruled [[French Mandate of Syria|Syria]] as a colony at the time. The [[History of Iraq#The Iraqi Monarchy|newly-sovereign]] [[Kingdom of Iraq]] was being courted for an alliance with Germany,&lt;ref name=Pringle/&gt;{{Rp | needed = yes | date = September 2013}} and [[Fritz Grobba]], the German envoy to Baghdad, arranged for Altheim and Trautmann to meet with local researchers and be driven to [[Parthia]]n and [[Parthian Empire|Persian]] ruins in southern Iraq, as well as [[Babylon]].

Through Baghdad, the team went north to [[Assur]] where they met Sheikh Adjil el Yawar, a leader of the [[Shammar]] [[Bedouin]] tribe and commander of the northern Camel Corps. He discussed German politics and his desire to duplicate the success of [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Abd al-Aziz ibn Saud]] who had recently ascended to power in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=Pringle/&gt;{{Rp | needed = yes | date = September 2013}}  With his support, the team traveled to their final major stop, the ruins of [[Hatra]] on the former border between the Roman and Persian empires.

===New Swabia===
{{Main|New Swabia#German Antarctic Expedition (1938–1939)}}
The third German Antarctic Expedition took place between 1938 and 1939. It was led by [[Alfred Ritscher]] (1879–63).

===Germany===

====Hedeby====
Excavations that had been ongoing at [[Hedeby]] since 1930 were formally put under the aegis of Ahnenerbe in 1938 by Jankuhn.&lt;ref name="Katalog3"&gt;{{Citation|last =Halle| first =Uta| contribution = Wichtige Ausgrabungen der NS-Zeit|year =2013|title = Graben für Germanien – Archäologie unterm Hakenkreuz|editor-last = Focke-Museum, Bremen|editor-first = |volume = | pages = 65–73|place = |publisher =Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft|isbn=978-3-534-25919-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Baden-Württemberg====
In 1937/8, [[Gustav Riek]] led an excavation at the ''[[Heuneburg]]'' on the [[Danube]] in [[Baden-Württemberg]], where an ancient fortress had been discovered much earlier. The Ahnenerbe thus won out over [[Hans Reinerth]] of the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Reichsbund für Deutsche Vorgeschichte|de|3=Reichsbund für Deutsche Vorgeschichte}}'' who had competed for the excavation. Riek focused on the burial mound known as {{Interlanguage link multi|Hohmichele|de}} where he found the main burial chamber to have been plundered in antiquity. In its direct vicinity another grave was discovered, however, that included rich grave furnishings. Due to the outbreak of war in 1939 the excavations were discontinued.&lt;ref name = "AID"&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Hansen|first1=Leif|last2=Krausse|first2=Dirk|title=Von der Akropolis zur Polis – Höhepunkte der Heuneburgforschung| newspaper = Archäologie in Deutschland|date=February 2017| language = de |publisher=WBG|pages=24–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24–5}}&lt;ref name="Kater"&gt;{{Citation | last = Kater | first = Michael | title = Das "Ahnenerbe" der SS 1935–1945.

A private expedition by Richard Anders and Wiligut into the Murg Valley of northwestern Baden-Württemberg had nothing to do with the Ahnenerbe.

====Mauern====
The Ahnenerbe also was active in the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Mauerner Höhlen|de|3=Mauerner Höhlen}}'' (Mauern caves) in the [[Franconian Jura]]. R.R. Schmidt discovered red ochre, a common pigment for cave paintings made by the [[European early modern humans|Cro-Magnon]].

In autumn 1937, {{Interlanguage link multi|Assien Bohmers|de|3=Assien Bohmers}}, a [[Frisia]]n nationalist who had applied to the SS Excavations Department earlier that year, took over the excavation. His team proceeded to find artifacts such as [[burin (lithic flake)|burin]]s, ivory pendants, and a [[woolly mammoth]] skeleton. They also discovered [[Neanderthal]] remains buried with what appeared to be throwing spears and javelins, a technology thought to have been developed by the Cro-Magnons.

Bohmers interpreted this to mean that Cro-Magnons had left these stones in the caves over 70,000 years before, and this was therefore the oldest Cro-Magnon site in the world. To validate his claims, Bohmers traveled around Europe speaking with colleagues and organizing exhibitions, notably in the Netherlands, Belgium and France.&lt;ref name=Pringle /&gt;{{Rp | needed = yes | date = September 2013}}

===France===
At the Parisian Institute for Human Paleontology, Bohmers met with [[Henri Breuil|Abbé Henri Breuil]], an expert on [[cave painting|cave art]]. Breuil arranged for Bohmers to visit [[Trois Frères]], a site whose owners allowed only a small number of visitors.&lt;ref name=Pringle/&gt;{{Rp | needed = yes | date = September 2013}}  First, however, Bohmers took a quick trip to [[London]], followed by a tour of several other French points of interest: La Fond de Gaume (a site featuring Cro-Magnon cave paintings), Teyat, La Mouthe and the caves of Dordogne. Then Bohmers moved on to Les Trois-Frères.&lt;ref name=Pringle/&gt;{{Rp | needed = yes | date = September 2013}}

====Bayeux Tapestry====
The Ahnenerbe took great interest in the 900-year-old [[Bayeux Tapestry]]. In June 1941, its staff oversaw the transport of the tapestry from its home in Bayeux Cathedral to an abbey at [[Juaye-Mondaye]], and finally to the Chateau de Sourches. In August 1944, after Paris was liberated by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], two members of the SS were dispatched to Paris to retrieve the tapestry, which had been moved into the basement of the [[Louvre]]. Contrary to Himmler’s orders, however, they chose not to attempt to enter the Louvre, most likely because of the strong presence of the [[French Resistance]] in the historic area.{{Citation needed|date = May 2012}}

===Tibet===
{{main|1939 German expedition to Tibet}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 135-KB-15-083, Tibetexpediton, Anthropometrische Untersuchungen.jpg|thumb|Beger conducting anthropometric studies in [[Sikkim]]]]
In 1937, Himmler decided that he could increase the Ahnenerbe’s visibility by investigating [[Hans F. K. Günther]]’s claims that early Aryans had conquered much of Asia, including attacks against [[China]] and [[Japan]] in approximately 2000&amp;nbsp;BC, and that [[Gautama Buddha]] was himself an Aryan offshoot of the Nordic race. Walther Wüst later expanded on this theory, stating in a public speech that Adolf Hitler’s ideology corresponded with that of the Buddha, since the two shared a common heritage.{{citation needed |date=October 2012}} However, according to contemporary research Hitler himself was not interested in Buddhism or Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Esposito | first = Monica | title = Images of Tibet in the 19th and 20th Centuries| year = 2008| publisher = École française d'Extrême-Orient| isbn = 978-2-85539-658-3| pages = 71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland===
[[File:Krakow oltarz Stwosza.jpg|thumb|The altar of [[Veit Stoss]]]]
{{See also|World War II looting of Poland}}
After the [[invasion of Poland]] in 1939, Wolfram Sievers wrote to Himmler stressing the need to appropriate exhibits from numerous museums.&lt;ref name="Sie"&gt;{{Citation | last = Sievers | title = To Himmler | date = September 4, 1939}}, BA (ehem BDC) Ahnenerbe: Paulsen, Peter (October 8, 1902).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[RSHA|Reich Main Security Office]] ''Standartenführer'' [[Franz Six]] oversaw SS-''Untersturmführer'' {{Interlanguage link multi|Peter Paulsen|de|3=Peter Paulsen (Archäologe)}}, who was commanding a small team that entered [[Kraków]] to obtain the 15th-century [[Ołtarz Wita Stwosza|Veit Stoss altar]]. Because the Poles had foreseen the German interest in the altar, they had disassembled it into 32 pieces, which were shipped to different locations, but Paulsen located each piece, and on October 14, 1939, he returned to Berlin with the altar in three small trucks and had it stored in the locked treasury of the [[Reichsbank]].&lt;ref name= Pringle /&gt;{{Rp | needed = yes | date = September 2013}}  After conferring with Hitler, who had not initially been told of the operation to capture it, it was decided to send the altar to an underground vault in Nuremberg, for safety.

[[Reinhard Heydrich]], then head of RSHA, sent Paulsen back to Kraków in order to seize additional museum collections,&lt;ref name=Pringle/&gt;{{Rp | needed = yes | date = September 2013}}  but Göring had already sent a team of his own men, commanded by SS-''Sturmbannführer'' [[Kajetan Mühlmann]] under the supervision of [[Dagobert Frey]], to loot the museums. Mühlmann agreed to let Paulsen take items of scholarly interest back to the Ahnenerbe, while keeping artworks for Göring. During the looting, however, [[Hans Frank]], the head of the German [[General Government]] in occupied Poland, issued an order dated November 22, 1939, prohibiting the “unapproved export” of Polish items. Paulsen obeyed the order, but his colleague Hans Schleif arranged for five [[freightcar]]s of loot from the Warsaw Archaeological Museum&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.culture.pl/en/culture/instytucje/muzea/in_mu_archeologiczne_warszawa | publisher = Culture | place = [[Poland|PL]] | title = Instytucje | language = Polish |trans-title=Institutions | contribution = In mu Archeologiczne Warszawa}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to be shipped to [[Poznań]], which was outside Frank’s control.  In return, Schleif was appointed as a trustee for [[Reichsgau Wartheland|Wartheland]]. Paulsen later tried to take credit for the freightcars' contents in his report to RuSHA, but was reassigned.&lt;ref name=Pringle/&gt;{{Rp | needed = yes | date = September 2013}}&lt;ref name="Akt"&gt;{{Citation | last = Sievers | title = Aktenvermerk | date = May 20, 1940}}, BA (ehem. BDC) Ahnenerbe: Paulsen, Peter (October 8, 1902).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eduard Paul Tratz]] of the Ahnenerbe also removed some exhibits from the State Zoological Museum in [[Warsaw]] to the Haus der Natur, the museum in [[Salzburg]] of which he was founder and director .&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Heather | last = Pringle | title = The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust | publisher = Hyperion | year = 2006 | pages = 204–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crimea===
After the German Army conquered the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]] in early July 1942, Himmler sent Herbert Jankuhn, as well as {{Interlanguage link multi|Karl Kersten|de}} and Baron Wolf von Seefeld, to the region in search of artifacts to follow up the recent display of the [[Kerch]] “Gothic crown of the Crimea” in Berlin.

Jankuhn met with senior officers of ''Einsatzkommando'' 11, part of ''[[Einsatzgruppen#Organization|Einsatzgruppe D]]'', while waiting at the field headquarters of the [[5th SS Panzergrenadier Division Wiking|5th SS Panzer Division]]. Commander [[Otto Ohlendorf]] gave Jankuhn information about the Crimean museums.&lt;ref name="Jan"&gt;{{Citation | last = Jankuhn | title = To Sievers | date = September 6, 1942 | first = Herbert (August 8, 1905) | publisher =  Ahnenerbe}}, BA (ehem. BDC).&lt;/ref&gt; Traveling with the 5th SS Panzer, Jankuhn’s team eventually reached [[Maykop]], where they received a message from Sievers that Himmler wanted an investigation of [[Mangup|Mangup Kale]], an ancient mountain fortress. Jankuhn sent Kersten to follow up on Mangup Kale, while the rest of the team continued trying to secure artifacts that had not already been taken by the [[Red Army#The Great Patriotic War, 1941 – 1945|Red Army]]. ''Einsatzkommando'' 11b’s commander [[Werner Braune]] aided the team.

Jankuhn was ultimately unable to find Gothic artifacts denoting a German ancestry, even after intelligence about a shipment of 72 crates of artifacts shipped to a medical warehouse.  The area had been ravaged by the time the team arrived and only 20 crates remained, but they contained Greek and stone-age artifacts, rather than Gothic.&lt;ref name=Pringle/&gt;{{Rp | needed = yes | date = September 2013}}

===Ukraine===
In June 1943, 27-year-old ''Untersturmführer'' [[Heinz Brücher]], who held a [[PhD]] from [[University of Tübingen|Tübingen]] in [[botany]], was tasked with an expedition to Ukraine and Crimea. ''[[Hauptsturmführer]]'' Konrad von Rauch and an interpreter identified as Steinbrecher were also involved in the expedition.

In February 1945, Brücher was ordered to destroy the Ahnenerbe's 18 active research facilities to avoid their capture by advancing [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces. He refused, and after the war continued his work as a botanist in [[Argentina]] and [[Trinidad]].&lt;ref name="Heim"&gt;{{Citation | last = Heim | first = Susanne | title = Autarkie und Ostexpansion. Pflanzenzucht und Agrarforschung im Nationalsozialismus |trans-title=Autarchy and East expansion | year = 2002 | language = German | publisher = [[Göttingen]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cancelled expeditions==

===Bolivia===
[[File:TiahuanacoGateEGSquier1877.jpg|thumb|The ''Gateway to the Sun'' in [[Tiwanaku]].]]
After winning 20,000 [[German reichsmark|Reichsmark]] in a writing contest, [[Edmund Kiss]] traveled to Bolivia in 1928 to study the ruins of temples in the [[Andes]]. He claimed that their apparent similarity to ancient European structures indicated that they had been designed by Nordic migrants millions of years earlier.&lt;ref name="Kiss"&gt;{{Citation | last = Kiss | first = Edmund | title = Das Sonnentor von Tihuanaku | pages = 106–7 | language = German}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed that his findings supported the [[Welteislehre|World Ice Theory]], which claimed that the universe originated from a cataclysmic clash between gigantic balls of ice and glowing mass. [[Arthur Posnansky]] had been studying a local site called [[Tiwanaku]], which he also believed supported the theory.

After contacting Posnansky, Kiss approached Wüst for help planning an expedition to excavate Tiwanaku and a nearby site, Siminake. The team would consist of 20 scientists, who would excavate for a year and also explore [[Lake Titicaca]], and take aerial photographs of ancient Incan roads they believed had Nordic roots. By late August 1939, the expedition was nearly set to embark, but the [[Fall Weiß (1939)|invasion]] of [[Poland]] caused the expedition to be postponed indefinitely.

===Iran===
In 1938, the Ahnenerbe's president, Walther Wüst, proposed a trip to [[Iran]] to study the [[Behistun Inscription]], which had been created by order of the [[Achaemenid dynasty|Achaemenid]] [[Shah]] [[Darius I of Persia|Darius I]]—who had declared himself to have been of [[Aryan| Aryan origin]] in his inscriptions.&lt;ref name=Pringle/&gt; The inscriptions were recorded atop steep cliffs using [[scaffolding]] that was removed after the inscriptions were made. Unable to afford the cost of erecting new scaffolds, Wüst proposed that he, his wife, an [[amanuensis]], an Iranian student, a photographer, and an experienced [[mountaineering|mountaineer]] be sent with a balloon-mounted camera. The onset of the war however, saw the trip postponed indefinitely.

===Canary Islands===
Early travelers to the [[Canary Islands]] had described the [[Guanches|Guanche]] natives as having golden-blond hair and white skin, and mummies had been found with blond tresses—facts which Wirth believed indicated that the islands had once been inhabited by [[Nordic theory|Nordics]]. His colleague [[Otto Huth]] proposed an autumn of 1939 expedition to study the ancient islanders’ racial origins, artifacts and religious rites. At the time, the Canary Islands were part of [[Francisco Franco]]’s [[Spanish State]] (''Estado Español''). Because Franco refused to side with the Axis when the war started, however, the trip was cancelled.

===Iceland===
[[Bruno Schweizer]] had already traveled to [[Iceland]] three times in 1938 when he proposed an Ahnenerbe expedition with seven others to the country in order to learn about their ancient farming practices and architecture, record folksongs and dances, and also collect soil samples for pollen analysis.&lt;ref name=Pringle /&gt;

The first setback for the expedition was the ridicule of the Scandinavian press, publishing stories in February 1939 claiming the expedition was based on false ideas about Icelandic heritage and sought old church records which did not even exist. An enraged Himmler publicly shut down the trip completely, but after calming down he allowed the planning of the trip to be secretly continued. The final setback occurred when Himmler’s personal staff was unable to get enough [[Icelandic króna|Icelandic crowns]]—Iceland’s currency. Not being able to quickly solve this problem, the trip was rescheduled for the summer of 1940.&lt;ref name=Pringle/&gt; In May 1940, the British [[Invasion of Iceland|invaded neutral Iceland]], but when the war had started the expedition had already been shelved.

In 1940, following the [[History of Iceland#World War II|British occupation of Iceland]], the Ahnenerbe-funded Bruno Kress, a German researcher who was in the country at the time, was rounded up along with other German nationals present on the island. Kress was interned in [[Ramsey, Isle of Man|Ramsey]] on the [[Isle of Man]], but was allowed to correspond with Sievers through letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.george-broderick.de/ns_docs/ns-kress_letters.doc |last=Kreß |title=Letters |format=MS Word |editor-first=George |editor-last=Broderick |place=[[Germany|DE]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041208054407/http://www.george-broderick.de/ns_docs/ns-kress_letters.doc |archivedate=December 8, 2004 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Kress’s ''Grammar of Icelandic'' was eventually published in [[East Germany]] in 1955. Kress also later worked for the East German ''[[Staatssicherheit]]'' (Stasi).

==Other Ahnenerbe activities==

===Master Plan East===
After being appointed Commissioner for the Strengthening of the German Race, Himmler set to work with [[Konrad Meyer]] on developing a plan for three large German colonies in the eastern occupied territories. [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], northern Poland and the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]] would be the focal points of these colonies intended to spread the Aryan race. The Crimean colony was called Gotengau, or “Goth district” in honor of the [[Crimean Goths]] who had settled there and were believed to be Aryan ancestors of the [[German people|Germans]].&lt;ref name=Pringle /&gt;

Himmler estimated Aryanization of the region would take twenty years, first expelling all the undesirable populations, then re-distributing the territory to appropriate Aryan populations. In addition to changing the demographics of the region, Himmler also intended to plant [[oak]] and [[beech]] trees to replicate traditional German forests, as well as plant new crops brought back from Tibet. To achieve the latter end, Himmler ordered a new institution set up by the Ahnenerbe and headed by Schäfer. A station was then set up near the Austrian town of [[Graz]] where Schäfer set to work with seven other scientists to develop new crops for the Reich.

The final piece of the puzzle fell in place after Hitler read a work by [[Alfred Frauenfeld]] which suggested resettling inhabitants of [[South Tyrol]], believed by some to be descendants of the Goths, to the Crimea. In 1939 the South Tyrolean were ordered by Hitler and [[Benito Mussolini]] to vote on whether they wanted to remain in Italy and accept assimilation or alternatively emigrate to Germany.  Over 80% chose the latter (for details see: ''[[South Tyrol Option Agreement]]''). Himmler presented Master Plan East to Hitler and received approval in July 1942.

Full implementation of the plan was not feasible because of the ongoing war, but a small colony was in fact founded around Himmler’s field headquarters at [[Hegewald (colony)|Hegewald]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Mazower | first = Mark | year = 2008 | title = Hitler's Empire | page = 454}}.&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Kiev]]. Starting on October 10, 1942, Himmler’s troops deported 10,623 Ukrainians from the area in cattle cars before bringing in trains of ethnic Germans ([[volksdeutsche]]) from northern Ukraine.&lt;ref name =Pringle/&gt; The SS authorities gave families needed supplies as well as land of their own, but also informed them of [[Production quota|quotas]] of food they needed to produce for the SS.

===Failed seizure of Tacitus manuscript===
The Ahnenerbe had tried to gain possession of the Codex Aesinas, a famous mediaeval copy of [[Tacitus]]' ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]''. Although [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] had originally promised it as a gift in 1936, it remained in the possession of the Count Aurelio Baldeschi Guglielmi Balleani outside [[Ancona]], from where the Ahnenerbe tried to obtain it after Mussolini was deposed.&lt;ref name="Schama"&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Simon Schama| last = Schama | first = Simon | title = Landscape and Memory | year = 1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Krebs | first = Christopher | title = A Most Dangerous Book: Tacitus's Germania from the Roman Empire to the Third Reich | chapter = 8 | publisher = WW Norton &amp; Co | year = 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Headquarters relocation===
On July 29, 1943, the [[Royal Air Force]]'s [[Battle of Hamburg (air)|firebombing of Hamburg]] led Himmler to order the immediate evacuation of the main Ahnenerbe headquarters in Berlin. The extensive library was moved to Schloss Oberkirchberg near [[Ulm]] while the staff was moved to the tiny village of Waischenfeld near [[Bayreuth]], [[Bavaria]]. The building selected was the 17th century ''Steinhaus''. While much of the staff was not ecstatic about the primitive conditions, Sievers seemed to have embraced the isolation.&lt;ref name=Pringle /&gt;

==Financing==
Financially, the Ahnenerbe was separate from the NSDAP treasury and had to find funding from other sources including membership dues and donations. After 1938, it received funds from the ''[[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]]''. In addition, a foundation (''Ahnenerbe-Stifterverband'') was established, set up with funds from business leaders.&lt;ref name="Katalog2"/&gt; One of the largest donations, approximately 50,000 [[German reichsmark|Reichsmark]], came from [[Deutsche Bank]] boardmember [[Emil Georg von Stauß]] associates, including [[BMW]] and [[Daimler-Benz]].&lt;ref name=Pringle/&gt; The foundation also received royalties from patents partially held by the SS (see below). During the war, Ahnenerbe also received money from other SS departments and profited from the ''Arisierung'' of Jewish property—its headquarters in Dahlem had been purchased at half its market value. In 1940, another estate in Munich was added.&lt;ref name="Katalog2"/&gt;

In 1936, the SS formed a joint company with [[Anton Loibl]], a machinist and driving instructor. The SS had heard about reflector pedals for bicycles, that Loibl and others had been developing. Assuring that Loibl got the patent himself, Himmler then used his political weight to ensure the passing of a 1939 law requiring the use of the new reflective pedals—of which the Ahnenerbe received a share of the profits, 77,740 Reichsmark in 1938.&lt;ref name=Pringle/&gt;

==Medical experiments==

The ''Institut für Wehrwissenschaftliche Zweckforschung'' ("Institute for Military Scientific Research"), which conducted extensive medical experiments using human subjects, became attached to the Ahnenerbe during World War II. It was managed by [[Wolfram Sievers]].&lt;ref name="Witte"&gt;Peter Witte et al., eds., ''Der Dienstkalender Heinrich Himmlers'' 1941/32, pp. 390–91.&lt;/ref&gt; Sievers had founded the organization on the orders of Himmler, who appointed him director with two divisions headed by [[Sigmund Rascher]] and [[August Hirt]], and funded by the [[Waffen-SS]].

===Dachau===
Sigmund Rascher was tasked with helping the [[Luftwaffe]] determine what was safe for their pilots—because aircraft were being built to fly higher than ever before. He applied for and received permission from Himmler to requisition camp prisoners to place in vacuum chambers to simulate the high altitude conditions that pilots might face.&lt;ref name=Pringle/&gt;

Rascher was also tasked with discovering how long German airmen would be able to survive if shot down above freezing water. His victims were forced to remain out of doors naked in freezing weather for up to 14 hours, or kept in a tank of icewater for 3 hours, their pulse and internal temperature measured through a series of electrodes. Warming of the victim was then attempted by different methods, most usually and successfully by immersion in very hot water, and also less conventional methods such as placing the subject in bed with women who would try to sexually stimulate him, a method suggested by Himmler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Mackowski| first = Maura Phillips| title = Testing the Limits: Aviation Medicine and the Origins of Manned Space Flight| year = 2006| publisher = Texas A&amp;M University Press| isbn = 978-1-58544-439-7| page = 94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ras"&gt;{{Citation | last = Rascher | type = letter | contribution = To Himmler | origyear = February 17, 1943 | title = Trials of War Criminals before the Nurenberg Military Tribunals | volume = 1 | series = Case 1: The Medical Case | place = Washington, DC, [[United States of America|US]] | publisher = Government Printing Office | date = 1949–50 | pages = 249–51}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rascher also experimented with the effects of Polygal, a substance made from [[beet]]s and apple [[pectin]], on [[coagulate|coagulating]] blood flow to help with [[wound ballistics|gunshot wounds]]. Subjects were given a Polygal tablet, and shot through the neck or chest, or their limbs amputated without anaesthesia. Rascher published an article on his experience of using Polygal, without detailing the nature of the human trials, and also set up a company to manufacture the substance, staffed by prisoners.&lt;ref name = "michalczyk"&gt;{{cite book| last = Michalczyk| first = John J.| title = Medicine, Ethics, and the Third Reich: Historical and Contemporary Issues| year = 1994| publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield| isbn = 978-1-55612-752-6| page = 96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar experiments were conducted from July to September 1944, as the Ahnenerbe provided space and materials to doctors at Dachau to undertake “seawater experiments”, chiefly through Sievers. Sievers is known to have visited Dachau on July 20, to speak with Ploetner and the non-Ahnenerbe [[Wilhelm Beiglboeck]], who ultimately carried out the experiments.

===Skulls===
Walter Greite rose to leadership of the Ahnenerbe’s ''Applied Nature Studies'' division in January 1939, and began taking detailed measurements of 2,000 Jews at the Vienna emigration office—but scientists were unable to use the data. On December 10, 1941, Beger met with Sievers and convinced him of the need for 120 Jewish skulls.&lt;ref name="Tag"&gt;Sievers, “Tagebuch: 10.12.1941,” BA, NS 21/127.&lt;/ref&gt; During the later [[Nuremberg Trials]], [[Friedrich Hielscher]] testified that Sievers had initially been repulsed at the idea of expanding the Ahnenerbe to human experimentation, and that he had “no desire whatsoever to participate in these.”&lt;ref&gt;Volume II, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jewish skeleton collection]]: Beger collaborated with [[August Hirt]], of the Reich University of Strassburg, in creating a Jewish skeleton collection for research. The bodies of 86 Jewish men and women were ultimately collected and [[maceration (bone)|macerated]].

==Post–World War II==

===Trials===
[[File:Wolfram Sievers.jpg|thumb|Wolfram Sievers]]

* Wolfram Sievers: In Waischenfeld American troops captured a slew of documents that would be used in the case against Sievers which would be a part of the [[Doctors' Trial]]. Sievers was charged for aiding in the [[Jewish skeleton collection]] and human medical experiments at Dachau and Natzweiler. In his defense, Sievers claimed he had helped a resistance group since 1929, which was supported by testimony from [[Friedrich Hielscher]] on April 15, 1947.&lt;ref name=Pringle/&gt;{{Rp | needed = yes | date = September 2013}}  Sievers was nevertheless found guilty on all four counts on August 21, 1947, and sentenced to death. He was hanged on June 2, 1948, at [[Landsberg Prison]].
* Richard Walther Darré: One of the founders of the Ahnenerbe, Darré was tried in the [[Ministries Trial]]. He received seven years imprisonment after being found not guilty on more serious charges.
* [[Edmund Kiss]]: His Bolivia trip having been cancelled, Kiss served in the armed forces the rest of the war, taking command of SS men at [[Wolfschanze]] near the end. He was interned in the [[Darmstadt]] camp after the war, but was released in June 1947 due to severe [[diabetes]]. His [[denazification|de-Nazification classification]] was as a “major offender”. This allowed him to only take a manual labor job. Following this decision, Kiss hired a lawyer to protest this decision, a major component of his case being he had never been a member of the Nazi party.&lt;ref name=Pringle/&gt;{{Rp | needed = yes | date = September 2013}}  After somewhat renouncing his past, Kiss was reclassified as a ''Mitläufer'' in 1948 and fined 501 DM.
* Walther Wüst: Although the president of the Ahnenerbe from 1937 until the end of the war, Wüst’s claims that he was unaware of any medical experiments were acknowledged, and in 1950 he was classified as a ''Mitläufer'' and released, returning to the [[University of Munich]] as a professor-in-reserve.&lt;ref name=Pringle/&gt;{{Rp | needed = yes | date = September 2013}}
* [[Bruno Beger]]: In February 1948, Beger was classified as "exonerated" by a [[denazification]] tribunal unaware of his role in the skeleton collection. In 1960, an investigation into the collection began in [[Ludwigsburg]], and Beger was taken into custody on March 30, 1960. He was released four months later, but the investigation continued until coming to trial on October 27, 1970. Beger claimed that he was unaware the Auschwitz prisoners he measured were to be killed. While two others indicted in the trial were released, Beger was convicted on April 6, 1971, and sentenced to three years in prison for being an accomplice in the murder of 86 Jews. Upon appeal however, his sentence was reduced to three years of probation. Neither of his colleagues with whom he was tried, [[Hans Fleischhacker]] and Wolf-Dietrich Wolff, were convicted.&lt;ref name=Pringle/&gt;{{Rp | needed = yes | date = September 2013}}

==Legacy==

===Academic study===

During the 20th century, little scholarly research into the Ahnenerbe took place.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=8}} Many scholars had likely been dissuaded from exploring the subject because ex-Ahnenerbe members held prominent academic positions in West Germany and did not want younger historians or archaeologists investigating their links with the SS.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=8}} The main scholar to explore the subject in this period was a Canadian historian, [[Michael Kater]], who conducted his research while in Germany.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=8}} As the [[University of Heidelberg]] sought to publish Kater's thesis on the subject in 1966, [[Walther Wüst]] unsuccessfully tried to legally prevent them from doing so.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=330}} Kater's research was then published in 1974 as ''Das "Ahnenerbe" der SS 1935–1945''.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=8}}

Following [[German reunification]] in 1990, the East German scholar [[Achim Leube]] begun an examination of the surviving historical evidence on the Ahnenerbe, much of which had been based in West Germany.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=8}} In November 1998, Leube oversaw an international academic conference on the Nazis' relationship with prehistory in Berlin.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=8}}

===Influence in pseudo-archaeology===

Many of the ideas inherited or developed by the ''Ahnenerbe'' remain influential.  Canadian author Heather Pringle has particularly drawn attention to the influence of [[Edmund Kiss]]' various 'crackpot theories' concerning such matters as the World Ice Theory and the origins of Tiwanaku upon subsequent writers such as H.S. Bellamy, Denis Saurat and, later, [[Graham Hancock]].&lt;ref&gt;Pringle, Heather (2006). The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust. Fourth Estate, London: p.310&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Much misinformation about the Ahnenerbe has circulated, due in part to adaptations of the group in fiction, and historically dubious [[conspiracy theories]] that sometimes confuse the Ahnenerbe with the roughly contemporaneous [[Thule Society]], or the historically unverified [[Vril|Vril society]].

The Ahnenerbe formed the basis for the depiction in the ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'' franchise of Nazis searching for religious artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fagan|first1=Garrett G.|author-link=Garrett G. Fagan|title=Archaeological Fantasies: How Pseudoarchaeology Misrepresents the Past and Misleads the Public|date=2006|publisher=[[Psychology Press]]|page=159|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sIYpx9mzd4gC&amp;pg=PA159|accessdate=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mees|first1=Bernard Thomas|title=The Science of the Swastika|date=2008|publisher=[[Central European University Press]]|page=201|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hLNUx6YK9RIC&amp;pg=PA201|accessdate=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ahnenerbe is frequently referenced in ''The Laundry'' series of novels by [[Charles Stross]].

The Tibetan expedition is alluded to in the [[Choose Your Own Adventure]] book, ''[[The Secret Treasure of Tibet]]'', in which one character who was in Tibet during World War II mentions encountering Germans who were looking for [[Shangri-La|Siling-La]], a location in Tibet with mystical properties.

In ''[[Wolfenstein]]'', there is a fictionalized in-game version of the Ahnenerbe called the SS Paranormal Division.

In ''[[Call of Duty: WWII]]''{{'}}s Nazi Zombies mode, the Ahnenerbe is featured as the primary antagonist, and Heinrich Himmler is mentioned during a conversation between the main characters.

In Season 3 of [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]]'s TV drama [[The Man in the High Castle (TV series)|The Man in the High Castle]], an Ahnenerbe Institute is seen in Nazi-occupied [[New York City]].

In the 2015 film ''Soldiers of the Damned'', a group of German soldiers is ordered to escort a female Ahnenerbe scientist into a Romanian forest behind enemy lines during the Second World War to retrieve a mysterious artifact that would enable communication with Aryan god-men to help win the war.

Francis was the daughter of the Rev. Daniel Gittins, rector of [[South Stoke, West Sussex|South Stoke]], near [[Arundel, Sussex]]. She was educated by her father in the classics and Hebrew. She married the Rev. Robert Bransby Francis, rector of [[Edgefield, Norfolk|Edgefield]], near [[Holt, Norfolk]].

Though lacking formal classical training, Francis was clearly in contact with the leading Old Testament scholars of the time: her ''Poetical Translation'' of the [[Song of Songs]] was dedicated to [[John Parkhurst]], and other subscribers included [[Robert Lowth]] and [[Benjamin Kennicott]]. The ''Poetical Translation'' focussed on what she saw as the direct dramatic action of the song, rather than its Christian allegorical interpretation. Taking a cue from [[Thomas Harmer]], Francis distinguished the voice of an 'Egyptian Spouse' from that of a 'Jewish Queen': in this [[love triangle]], Solomon's marriage to the daughter of Pharaoh was resented by an earlier wife.&lt;ref name="TaylorChoi2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Al Wothers|editor=Marion Ann Taylor; Agnes Choi|title=Handbook of Women Biblical Interpreters: A Historical and Biographical Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FdbXSdp-j9QC&amp;pg=PT424|accessdate=10 October 2012|year=2012|publisher=Baker Books|isbn=978-1-4412-3867-2|chapter=Francis, Ann (1738-1900)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her translation has not received much continuous attention. Yet in the verdict of one recent commentator, Francis's "insistence on bringing together learning and feeling, what she knew as male and female worlds, makes her Song of Songs an outstanding feminist monument."&lt;ref&gt;Mary Dove, 'Merely a Love Poem?

She died on 7 November 1800.

{{About|the novohispanic Nahuatl language grammarian|the 15th-century Spanish painter|Antonio del Rincón (painter)}}
'''Antonio del Rincón''' (1566 – March 2, 1601) was a [[Jesuit]] priest and [[Philologist|grammarian]], who wrote one of the earliest grammars of the [[Nahuatl]] language (known generally as the ''[[Arte mexicana]]'', [[manuscript|MS.]] published in 1595). 

A native of [[Texcoco de Mora|Texcoco]] from the early decades of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] and descendant of the ''[[tlatoani|tlatoque]]'' ([[List of rulers of Texcoco|ruling nobility of Texcoco]]), del Rincón was a native speaker of the indigenous language. Historians debate whether both his parents were indigenous Nahuas or whether he was a [[mestizo]] of half-Nahua, half-Spanish parentage. Historian Kelly McDonough considers him one of the first [[Nahua people|Nahua]] intellectuals.{{sfn|McDonough|2011}} Guzman Betancourt calls him "the first native linguist of the New World". He entered the Company of Jesus at the age of 17 and quickly became known for his good grasp of the Nahuatl language and his sound theology.{{sfn|Guzmán Betancourt|2002}} 

His grammar ranks alongside those of [[Andrés de Olmos]] and [[Alonso de Molina]] as an influential primary source for the language as spoken in the post-conquest period. He was the first scholar to hear and mark the [[glottal stop]] and vowel length distinction in nahuatl, and he was an important influence on his later Jesuit colleague [[Horacio Carochi]], who elaborated on Rincon's work in his own famous arte.{{sfn|Smith-Stark|2000}} Nahuatl grammarians have praised Rincón for being the first to analyze the Nahuatl language on its own terms, instead of building on the latinate molds of European grammars. {{sfn|Guzmán Betancourt|2002}} Linguist [[Una Canger]] has written that "When Carochi praises Rincón and underlines how he teaches with "such mastery", it is because of the organization of the Arte and because Rincón analyzes the language not according to the Latin model, but on its own terms. What Carochi adopted from Rincón is exactly the organization of the Arte.&lt;ref&gt;"''Cuando Carochi alaba a Rincón y subraya que enseña con ‘tanto magisterio’, es por la organización del Arte y también porque Rincón analiza la lengua no según el modelo latino, sino conforme a la lengua misma. Lo que ha adoptado Carochi de Rincón es precisamente la organización del Arte.''" Una Canger, “El Arte de Horacio Carochi”, in Klaus Zimmermann, editor, La descripción de las lenguas amerindias en la época colonial, Frankfurt/Madrid, Vervuert/Iberoamericana, 1997, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gregory Bar Hebraeus''' (1226{{snd}}30 July 1286), also known by his [[Latinisation of names|Latin name]] '''Abulpharagius''' or Syriac name '''Mor Gregorios Bar Ebraya''', was a ''[[maphrian]]-[[catholicos]]'' (Chief bishop of Persia) of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] in the 13th  century.  He is noted for his works concerning philosophy, poetry, language, history, and theology;&lt;ref&gt;[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]], {{ISBN|0-550-18022-2}}, page 5&lt;/ref&gt; he has been called "one of the most learned and versatile men from the Syriac Orthodox Church" ([[William Wright (Orientalist)|Dr. William Wright]]).&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Bar-Hebraeus|volume=3|page=400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bar Hebraeus collected in his numerous and elaborate treatises the results of such research in theology, philosophy, science and history as was in his time possible in Syria. Most of his works were written in [[Syriac language|Syriac]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;  However he also wrote some in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], which had become the common language in his day.

==Name==
It is not clear when Bar Hebraeus adopted  the [[Christian name]] Gregory ({{lang-syr|ܓܪܝܓܘܪܝܘܣ}} ''Grigorios'', ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Ġrīġūriyūs}}''), but according to the Syriac Orthodox tradition of naming high priests, it may have occurred at the time of his consecration as bishop.&lt;ref name=Budge&gt;[http://sor.cua.edu/Personage/BarcEbroyo/Budge.html Budge, E.A.W., ''The Chronography of Gregory Abu'l Faraj, The Son of Aaron, The Hebrew Physician Commonly Known as Bar Hebraeus Being the First Part of His Political History of the World''. London: Oxford University Press. 1932]&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his life, he was often referred to by the Syriac [[nickname]] Bar ʿEbrāyā ({{lang-syr|ܒܪ ܥܒܪܝܐ}}, which is pronounced and often transliterated as ''Bar Ebroyo'' in the West Syriac dialect of the Syriac Orthodox Church), giving rise to the Latinised name Bar Hebraeus. This nickname refers to his Jewish background, which means 'Son of the Hebrew'. His father was a Jewish physician. The name also refer to the place of his birth as well, ʿEbrā, where the old road east of [[Malatya]] towards [[Kharput]] (modern [[Elazığ]]) and [[Amida (Mesopotamia)]] (modern [[Diyarbakır]]) crossed the [[Euphrates]].&lt;ref&gt;A few Syriac sources{{who|date=August 2013}} give Bar-Hebraeus's full Arabic name as {{transl|ar|DIN|Jamāluddīn Abū'l-Faraj Ġrīġūriyūs bin Tājuddīn Hārūn bin Tūmā al-Malaṭī}} ({{lang-ar|جمال الدين ابو الفرج غريغوريوس بن تاج الدين هارون بن توما الملطي}}). However, all references to this longer name are posthumous. The Syriac nickname Bar ʿEbrāyā is sometimes arabised as Ibn al-ʿIbrī ({{lang-ar|ابن العبري}}). E.A.W. Budge says Bar Hebraeus was given the baptismal name John ({{lang-syr|ܝܘܚܢܢ}}, ''Yōḥanan''), but this may be a scribal error. As a Syriac bishop, Bar Hebraeus is often given the [[honorific]] Mār ({{lang-syr|ܡܪܝ}}, pronounced Mor in West Syriac dialect), and thus Mar/Mor Gregory{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also known as Abu'l Faraj (in [[Latin language|Latin]], Abulpharagius).

A Syriac bishop, philosopher, poet, grammarian, physician, biblical commentator, historian, and theologian, Bar Hebraeus was the son of a Jewish physician, Aaron&lt;ref name=Butin&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02294a.htm Butin, Romain. "Bar Hebræus." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 2 Dec. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; ({{transl|ar|DIN|Hārūn bin Tūmā al-Malaṭī}}, {{lang-ar|هارون بن توما الملطي}}). Bar Hebraeus was born in the village of ʿEbra (Izoli, Turk.: Kuşsarayı) near [[Malatya]], [[Sultanate of Rûm]] (modern [[Turkey]], now in the province of [[Elazig]]). Under the care of his father, he began as a boy (''a teneris unguiculis'') the study of [[medicine]] and of many other branches of knowledge, which he never abandoned.

A Mongol general invaded the area of Malatya, and falling ill, sought for a physician. Aaron, the Hebrew physician, was summoned. Upon his recovery, the Mongol general and Aaron, who took his family with him, went to Antioch. There Bar Hebraeus continued with his studies and when he was about seventeen years of age he became a monk and began to lead the life of the hermit.&lt;ref name=Budge/&gt;

From Antioch Bar Hebraeus went to Tripoli in Phoenicia, and studied rhetoric and medicine. In 1246 he was consecrated bishop of [[Gubos (West Syrian Diocese)|Gubos]] by the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch [[Ignatius II]],&lt;ref name=Budge/&gt; and in 1252 he was transferred to Aleppo. In 1255 was transferred to the [[episcopal see|see]] of [[Laqabin (West Syrian Diocese)|Laqabin]] and finally was made [[primate (bishop)|primate]], or ''maphrian'', of the East by Ignatius IV Yeshu in 1264.&lt;ref name=Samir&gt;[http://ccdl.libraries.claremont.edu/cdm/ref/collection/cce/id/318 Samir, Khalil. "Bar Hebraeus", ''The Coptic encyclopedia'', vol. 2, Macmillan, 1991]&lt;/ref&gt; His episcopal duties did not interfere with his studies; he took advantage of the numerous visitations, which he had to make throughout his vast province, to consult the libraries and converse with the learned men whom he happened to meet. Thus he gradually accumulated an immense erudition, became familiar with almost all branches of secular and religious knowledge, and in many cases thoroughly mastered the bibliography of the various subjects which he undertook to treat. Bar Hebræus preserved and systematized the work of his predecessors, either by way of condensation or by way of direct reproduction. Both on account of his virtues and of his science, Bar Hebræus was highly esteemed. He died in [[Maraga]], [[Persia]], and was buried at the [[Mar Mattai Monastery]], near [[Mosul]]. He left an autobiography, to be found in [[Giuseppe Simone Assemani|Assemani]], ''Biblioth. Orient.'', II, 248-263; the account of his death was written by his brother, Grigorius Barsawmo (d. 1307/8).

==Works==

===Encyclopedic and philosophical===
Bar Hebraeus' great encyclopedic work is his ''Hewath Hekhmetha'', "The Cream of Science", which deals with almost every branch of human knowledge, and comprises the whole Aristotelian discipline, after [[Avicenna]] and Arabian writers. This work, so far, has not been published, with the exception of one chapter, by [[Margoliouth]], in ''Analecta Orientalia ad poeticam Aristoteleam'' (London, 1887), 114-139.

The ''Kethabha dhe-Bhabhatha'', ("Book of the Pupils of the Eyes") is a compendium of [[logic]] and [[dialectics]].

The rest is to be found only in manuscripts, preserved at [[Florence]], [[Oxford]], [[London]], and elsewhere. (3) ''Teghrath Teghratha'', "Commerce of Commerces", a résumé of the preceding, also unpublished. (4) ''Kethabha dhe-Sewadh Sophia'', "Book of Speech of Wisdom"; compendium of [[physics]] and [[metaphysics]]. To these should be added a few translations of Arabic works into Syriac, as well as some treatises written in Arabic.&lt;ref name=Butin/&gt;

===Biblical===
The most important work of Bar Hebraeus is ''Awsar Raze'', "Storehouse of Secrets", a commentary on the entire [[Bible]], both doctrinal and critical. Before giving his doctrinal exposition of a passage, he first considers its critical state. Although he uses the ''[[Peshitta]]'' as a basis, he knows that it is not perfect, and therefore controls it by the Hebrew, the [[Septuagint]], the Greek versions of [[Symmachus the Ebionite|Symmachus]], [[Theodotion]], [[Aquila of Sinope|Aquila]], by Oriental versions, Armenian and Coptic, and finally by the other Syriac translations, Heraclean, [[Philoxenian]] and especially the ''[[Syro-hexaplar version|Syro-Hexapla]]''. The work of Bar Hebræus is of prime importance for the recovery of these versions and more specially for the ''[[Hexapla]]'' of [[Origen]], of which the ''Syro-Hexapla'' is a translation by Paul of Tella. His exegetical and doctrinal portions are taken from the [[Greek Fathers]] and previous Syriac Orthodox theologians. No complete edition of the work has yet been issued, but many individual books have been published at different times.&lt;ref name=Butin/&gt;

===Historical===
Bar Hebraeus has left a large ecclesiastical history called ''Makhtbhanuth Zabhne'', ''Chronicon'', in which he considers history from the [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] down to his own day. Bar Hebræus used almost all that had been written before him, showing particular favor to the now lost chronographic records published by [[Theophilus of Edessa]] (late 8th century, although he has this only through Michael the Syrian and other dependents).&lt;ref name="todt"&gt;{{cite journal

The first portion deals with political and civil history and is known as the ''Chronicon Syriacum''.  The standard edition of the ''Chronicon Syriacum'' is that of [[Paul Bedjan|Bedjan]], ''Gregorii Barhebraei Chronicon Syriacum'' (Paris, 1890). An English translation by [[E. A. Wallis Budge]] exists.

This was to give context to the second portion, known as the ''Chronicon Ecclesiasticum'' and covering the religious history.&lt;ref name="conrad"/&gt; That section begins with [[Aaron]] and consists of a series of entries of important individuals.  The first half covers the history of the Syriac Orthodox Church and the Patriarchs of Antioch, while the second half is devoted to the Church of the East, the Nestorian Patriarchs, and the Jacobite Maphrians. The current edition of the ''Chronicon Ecclesiasticum'' is that of [[Jean Baptiste Abbeloos|Abbeloos]] and [[Thomas Joseph Lamy|Lamy]],&lt;ref&gt;3 vols., Louvain, 1872–77.&lt;/ref&gt; Syriac text, Latin translation. An English translation by David Wilmshurst was published by Gorgias Press in February 2016.

Bar Hebraeus towards the end of his life decided to write a history in Arabic largely based on the ''Chronicon Syriacum'', adapted for a wider Arabic-reading readership rather than solely for Syriac-literate clergy. This became the ''al-Mukhtaṣar fi-l-Duwal''.&lt;ref&gt;For the name see Conrad (1994) pp. 324-25 and audience see Conrad (1994) pp. 328-41.&lt;/ref&gt; This was first published by [[Edward Pococke]] in 1663 with a Latin translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gregorius Abul-Pharajius |editor-last=Pococke |editor-first=Edward |date=1663 |place=Oxford |publisher=R.

===Theological===
In theology Bar Hebræus was a [[Miaphysite]]. He probably{{cn|date=August 2018}}, however, thought that the differences between [[Catholic]]s, Nestorians, and the rest did not affect the common faith; hence, he did not consider others as [[Heresy|heretics]], and was not himself considered as such, at least by the Church of the East and the Armenians. Indeed, he once mused
:When I had given much thought and pondered on the matter, I became convinced that these quarrels among the different Christian Churches are not a matter of factual substance, but of words and terminology; for they all confess Christ our Lord to be perfect God and perfect human, without any commingling, mixing, or confusion of the natures... Thus I saw all the Christian communities, with their different christological positions, as possessing a single common ground that is without any difference between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bar Hebraeus|title=Book of the Dove|location=Chapter IV|url=http://sor.cua.edu/Ecumenism/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this field, we have from Bar Hebraeus ''Menarath Qudhshe'', "Lamp of the Sanctuary", and the ''Kethabha dhe-Zalge'', "Book of Rays", a summary of the first. These works have not been published, and exist in manuscript in [[Paris]], [[Berlin]], London, Oxford, and [[Rome]]. Ascetical and moral theology were also treated by Bar Hebræus, and we have from him ''Kethabha dhe-Ithiqon'', "Book of Ethics", and ''Kethabha dhe-Yauna'', "Book of the Dove", an ascetical guide. Both have been edited by Bedjan in "Ethicon seu Moralia Gregorii Barhebræi" (Paris and Leipzig, 1898). The "Book of the Dove" was issued simultaneously by Cardahi (Rome, 1898). Bar Hebræus codified the juridical texts of the Syriac Orthodox, in a collection called ''Kethabha dhe-Hudhaye'', "Book of Directions", edited by Bedjan, "Barhebræi [[Nomocanon]]" (Paris, 1898). A Latin translation is to be found in [[Angelo Mai]], "Scriptorum Veter. Nova Collectio", vol. x. Bar Hebræus has left besides many other works. On grammatical subjects we have the "Book of Splendours" and "Book of the Spark", both edited by Martin, "Oeuvres grammaticales de Aboul Faradj dit Barhebræus" (2 vols., Paris, 1872); also works on mathematics, astronomy, cosmography, and medicine, some of which have been published, but others exist only in manuscript.

===Other works===
A full list of Bar Hebraeus's other works, and of editions of such of them as have been published, will be found in [[William Wright (Orientalist)|W. Wright]]'s ''Syriac Literature'', pp.&amp;nbsp;268–281. The more important of them are:
* ''Kethabha dhe-Bhabhatha'' (Book of the Pupils of the Eyes), a treatise on logic or dialectics
* ''Hewath Hekmetha'' (Butter of Wisdom), an exposition of the whole philosophy of Aristotle
* ''Sullarat Haunãnãyã'' (Ascent of the Mind), a treatise on astronomy and cosmography, edited and translated by [[F. Nau]] (Paris, 1899)
* various medical works
* ''Kethabha dhe-Zalge'' (Book of Rays), a treatise on grammar
* ethical works
* poems
* ''Kethabha dhe-Thunnaye Mighaizjzikhanl'' (Book of Entertaining Stories), edited and translated by [[E. A. Wallis Budge]] (London, 1897).

==Veneration==

'''Bernard of Besse''' was a French [[Friar Minor]] and chronicler.

He was a native of [[Aquitaine]], with date of birth uncertain; he belonged to the custody of [[Cahors]] and was secretary to [[St. Bonaventure]]. He took up the pen after the Seraphic Doctor, he tells us, to gather the ears the latter had dropped from his sheaf, lest anything of so great a memory as that of [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]] might perish.

==Works==

His ''Liber de Laudibus Beati Francisci'', composed about 1280, besides a resume of some of the earlier legends, contains brief and valuable information about the companions of St. Francis and the foundation of the three [[Franciscan Order]]s, and is the only thirteenth-century document which specifies the first biographies of St. Francis.

About 1297-1300 he compiled a catalogue of the ministers general up to his time, which is also a source of importance for the study of Franciscan history.

Critical editions of both these works have been published by the Friars Minor of Quaracchi [in ''Analecta Franciscana'', III (1897), 666-707] and by Father [[Hilarin Felder]] of Lucerne, O. M. Cap. "Liber de Laudibus" etc. (Rome, 1897).

Bernard also wrote the life of Blessed [[Christopher of Cahors]] inserted in the ''[[Chronica XXIV Generalium]]'' (ed. Quaracchi, 1897, 161-173) and is very probably the author of the ''Speculum Disciplinae'' and of the ''Epistola ad Quendam Novitium'' [[Pseudo-Bonaventura|erroneously attributed to St. Bonaventure]] (See Bonav. Opera Omnia ed. Quaracchi, 1898, VIII, 583 sqq. and 663 sqq.).

'''Bilin Bilin''' (born c. 1820; died 1901) was a member of the [[Yugambeh people|Yugambeh]] [[Bundjalung people]] in Australia, who gained respect of the [[History of Queensland#Nineteenth century|European colonials]] and received a [[king plate]] for it.

[[File:Courtyard of the prison grounds.jpeg|thumb|The 18th century debtors' prison at the [[Castellania (Valletta)|Castellania]] in [[Valletta]], now the offices of the Health Ministry in [[Malta]]]]
A '''debtors' prison''' is a [[prison]] for [[Natural person|people]] who are unable to pay [[debt]]. Through the mid 19th century, debtors' prisons (usually similar in form to locked [[workhouses]]) were a common way to deal with unpaid debt in places like [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref name="Cory"&gt;Cory, Lucinda. [http://www.rib.uscourts.gov/ONTHEDOCKET/vol2,%20iss2.PDF "A Historical Perspective on Bankruptcy"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228083132/http://www.rib.uscourts.gov/ONTHEDOCKET/vol2%2C%20iss2.PDF |date=February 28, 2008 }}, ''On the Docket'', Volume 2, Issue 2, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Rhode Island, April/May/June 2000, retrieved December 20, 2007. &lt;/ref&gt; Destitute persons who were unable to pay a court-ordered judgment would be incarcerated in these prisons until they had worked off their debt via labor or secured outside funds to pay the balance. The product of their labor went towards both the costs of their incarceration and their accrued debt. Increasing access and lenience throughout the [[history of bankruptcy law]] have made prison terms for unaggravated [[indigence]] illegal over most of the world.

Since the late 20th century, the term ''debtors' prison'' has also sometimes been applied by critics to [[criminal justice system]]s in which a court can sentence someone to prison over willfully unpaid [[Criminal procedure|criminal fees]], usually following the order of a [[judge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justanswer.com/topics-contempt-of-court/|title=What is Contempt of Court and other Contempt of Court Questions Answered|work=JustAnswer}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in some jurisdictions within the [[United States]], people can be held in [[contempt of court]] and jailed after willful non-payment of [[Child support in the United States|child support]], garnishments, confiscations, fines, or back taxes. Additionally, though properly served [[Civil procedure|civil duties]] over private debts in nations such as the United States will merely result in a [[default judgement]] being rendered ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' if the defendant willfully declines to appear by law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nasonlawfirm.com/archives/548|title=What Happens If I Get Sued?|work=nasonlawfirm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a substantial number of indigent debtors are legally incarcerated for the crime of failing to appear at civil debt proceedings as ordered by a judge. In this case, the crime is not indigence, but disobeying the judge's order to appear before the court.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tampa1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="calpen1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="minn1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="harrington1"/&gt;  Critics argue that the "willful" terminology is subject to individual [[mens rea]] determination by a judge, rather than statute, and that since this presents the potential for judges to incarcerate legitimately indigent individuals, it amounts to a de facto "debtors' prison" system.

== History ==

=== Medieval Europe ===
During Europe's [[Middle Ages]], debtors, both men and women, were locked up together in a single, large cell until their families paid their debt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.articlesdepo.com/loans/56618.php Articlesdepo.com] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debt prisoners often died of diseases contracted from other debt prisoners. Conditions included starvation and abuse from other prisoners. If the father of a family was imprisoned for debt, the family business often suffered while the mother and children fell into poverty. Unable to pay the debt, the father often remained in debtors' prison for many years. Some debt prisoners were released to become [[serf]]s or [[indentured servant]]s ([[debt bondage]]) until they paid off their debt in labor.

== By region ==

=== Canada ===
{{main|Imprisonment for debt (Upper Canada)}}

=== Council of Europe ===
Article 1 of [[European Convention on Human Rights#Protocol 4 - civil imprisonment, free movement, expulsion|Protocol 4]] of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] prohibits the imprisonment of people for breach of a contract. Turkey and the United Kingdom (due to concerns over British nationality law) have signed but never ratified Protocol 4. Greece and Switzerland have neither signed nor ratified this protocol.

=== France ===

France allows for ''contrainte par corps'', now denominated ''contrainte judiciaire'', for money owed to the State by non-insolvant debtors aged from 18 to 65; its length is limited following the amount of the debt and aims to pressure the debtor to pay his debts, consequently the owed money stays owed to the State.

=== Germany ===
[[File:Nuernberg-maennereisen-v-nw.jpg|thumb|right|Schuldturm in [[Nuremberg]]]]
In the late Middle Ages, and at the beginning of the modern era, public law was codified in Germany. This served to standardize the coercive arrest (''Pressionshaft''), and got rid of the many arbitrary sanctions that were not universal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/archiv/.bin/dump.fcgi/2006/0919/recht/0108/index.html Berlinonline.de] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222215014/http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/archiv/.bin/dump.fcgi/2006/0919/recht/0108/index.html |date=December 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some areas (like Nürnberg) the debtor could sell or redistribute their debt.

In most of the cities, the towers and city fortifications functioned as jails. For certain sanctions there were designated prisons, hence some towers being called debtors' prison (''Schuldturm''). The term ''Schuldturm'', outside of the Saxon constitution, became the catchword for public law debtor’s prison.

In the early modern era, the debtor’s detainment or citizen’s arrest remained valid in Germany. Sometimes it was used as a tool to compel payment, other times it was used to secure the arrest of an individual and ensure a trial against them in order to garnish wages, [[replevin]] or a form of [[trover]]. This practice was particularly disgraceful to a person’s identity, but had different rules than criminal trials. It was more similar to the modern enforcement of sentences (''Strafvollzug'') e.g. the debtor would be able to work off their debt for a certain amount of days, graduated by how much they owed.

The [[North German Confederation]] eliminated debtors' prisons on May 29, 1868.

At present a comparable concept to debtors' prison still exists in various forms in Germany:{{fact|date=July 2017}}
* A maximum of 6 weeks coercive arrest for failure to pay fine (''Bußgeld'').
* A maximum of 6 months coercive arrest for failure to issue an oath of not being able to pay any kind of liability.
* As an alternative sentence, if a fine (''Geldstrafe'') is not paid, up to 6 months.
* As a personal arrest for the securing of a foreclosure or garnishment on wages.

In England during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, 10,000 people were imprisoned for debt each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A 20th Century Debate About Imprisonment for Debt|last = Ware|first = Stephen|date = July 2014|journal = American Journal of Legal History|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A prison term did not alleviate a person's debt, however; an inmate was typically required to repay the creditor in-full before being released.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.historyextra.com/facts/nutshell-debtors’-prisons|title = In a Nutshell: Debtor's Prisons|date = February 10, 2015|accessdate = |website = History Extra|publisher = BBC|last = Wilkes|first = Jonny|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151212102229/http://www.historyextra.com/facts/nutshell-debtors%E2%80%99-prisons|archivedate = December 12, 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and the later [[United Kingdom]], debtors' prisons varied in the amount of freedom they allowed the debtor. With a little money, a debtor could pay for some freedoms; some prisons allowed inmates to conduct business and to receive visitors; others (including the [[Fleet Prison|Fleet]] and [[King's Bench Prison]]s) even allowed inmates to live a short distance outside the prison—a practice known as the 'Liberty of the Rules'—and the Fleet even tolerated clandestine '[[Fleet Marriage]]s'.

Life in these prisons, however, was far from pleasant, and the inmates were forced to pay for their keep. Samuel Byrom, son of the writer and poet [[John Byrom]], was imprisoned for debt in the Fleet in 1725, and in 1729 he sent a petition to his old school friend, the [[Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset|Duke of Dorset]], in which he raged against the injustices of the system. Some debtor prisoners were even less fortunate, being sent to prisons with a mixture of vicious criminals and petty criminals, and many more were confined to a single cell.

The father of the [[England|English]] author [[Charles Dickens]] was sent to one of these prisons (the [[Marshalsea Prison|Marshalsea]]), which were often described in Dickens's novels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charles-dickens.com/ Charles Dickens Bibliography] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215121741/http://www.charles-dickens.com/ |date=2010-12-15 }} at charles-dickens.com&lt;/ref&gt; He became an advocate for debt prison reform, and his novel ''[[Little Dorrit]]'' dealt directly with this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Charles Dickens, Social Worker in His Time|last = Andrews|first = Arlene B.|date = October 2012|journal = Social Work|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Debtors' Act of 1869]] limited the ability of the courts to sentence debtors to prison, but it did not entirely prohibit them from doing so.  Debtors who had the means to pay their debt, but did not do so, could still be incarcerated for up to six weeks, as could those who defaulted on debts to the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/32-33/62/part/I|title = Debtors Act of 1869|date = |accessdate = 6 December 2015|website = |publisher = The National Archives (UK)|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, there was a significant reduction in the number of debtors imprisoned following the passage of the 1869 Act.   By 1870, the total number of debtors imprisoned decreased by almost 2,000, dropping from 9,759 in 1869 to 6,605 in 1870.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Judicial Statistics, England and Wales, Part 2|last = |first = |publisher = Great Britain Home Office|year = 1907|isbn = |location = |pages = 35|url = https://books.google.com/?id=64AzAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=debt%20imprisonment%20statistics%20england&amp;pg=PA33#v=onepage&amp;q=debt%20imprisonment%20statistics%20england&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, by 1905 that  number had increased to 11,427.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some of London's debtors' prisons were the [[Coldbath Fields Prison]], [[Fleet Prison]], [[Giltspur Street Compter]], [[King's Bench Prison]], [[Marshalsea Prison]], [[Poultry Compter]], and [[Wood Street Counter]]. The most famous was [[The Clink|the Clink prison]], which had a debtor's entrance in Stoney Street. This prison gave rise to the British slang term for being incarcerated in any prison, hence "in the clink". Its location also gave rise to the term for being financially embarrassed, "stoney broke".

=== Greece ===
Ιmprisonment for debts, whether to the tax office or to a private bank, was still practiced until January 2008, when the law changed after imprisonment for unpaid taxes, as well as other debts to the government or to the social security office, was declared unconstitutional after having been practiced for 173 years; imprisonment was, however, still retained for debts to private banks.{{clarify|date=April 2009}} The situation regarding imprisonment (προσωποκράτηση (prosōpokrάtēsē): custody) for debts to the government is still unclear, as courts continue to have this ability for criminal acts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reporto.gr/news.asp?ID=7710 Reporto.gr] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205184819/http://www.reporto.gr/news.asp?ID=7710 |date=February 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malta===
{{main|Castellania (Valletta)}}
An eighteenth century debtors' prison is found within the [[Castellania (Valletta)|Castellania]] in [[Valletta]], Malta, now used as offices by the Ministry for Health. It remained in use as a prison until the nineteenth century. People who fail to pay their debts today are given prison sentences to be served at Corradino Prison in [[Paola, Malta|Paola]].

=== United Arab Emirates ===
Debtors in the [[United Arab Emirates]], including [[Dubai]], are imprisoned for failing to pay their debts. This is a common practice in the country. Banks are not sympathetic to the debtors once they are in prison, so many just choose to leave the country where they can negotiate for settlements later. The practice of fleeing UAE to avoid arrest because of debt defaults is considered a viable option to customers who are unable to meet their obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/world/middleeast/12dubai.html|work=The New York Times|title=Laid-Off Foreigners Flee as Dubai Spirals Down|first=Robert F.|last=Worth|date=2009-02-12|accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/business/how-the-world-is-dealing-with-the-issue-of-debtors|work=The National|title=How the world is dealing with the issue of debtors|first=Wayne|last=Arnold|date=2008-12-24|accessdate=2010-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States of America ===

==== Early debtors' prisons (colonization–1850) ====
Many Colonial American jurisdictions established debtors' prisons using the same models used in Great Britain. [[James Wilson]], a signatory to the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], spent some time in a debtors' prison while still serving as an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] of the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/signers/wilson.htm |publisher=ushistory.org |location= |title=James Wilson 1742-1798 |first=Thomas |last=Kindig |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710163946/http://www.ushistory.org/Declaration/Signers/wilson.htm |archivedate=2015-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow signatory [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] spent three years, from 1798 to 1801, in the Prune Street Debtors' Prison, [[Philadelphia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Axelrod|first=Alan|title=The Real History of the American Revolution|date=2007|page=349}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ushistory.org/tour/washington-square.htm|publisher=ushistory.org|title=Washington Square: Go to Jail}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Lee III, better known as [[Henry Lee III|Henry "Light-Horse" Lee]], a [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] general and father of Robert E.

Debtors' prisons were prevalent throughout the [[United States]] up until the mid-1800s. Economic hardships following the [[War of 1812]] with [[Great Britain]] helped swell prison populations with simple debtors. This resulted in significant attention being given to plights of the poor and most dependent jailed under the widespread practice, possibly for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Acquisition of Political, Social, and Industrial Rights of Man in America|last=McMaster|first=John B.|year=1903|publisher=Imperial Press|location=Cleveland|isbn=978-1-4097-7187-6|pages=63–66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B2cUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=1816+debtors+prison#v=onepage&amp;q=1816%20debtors%20prison&amp;f=false|accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing disfavor over debtors' prisons along with the advent and early development of [[Bankruptcy in the United States|U.S. bankruptcy laws]] led states to begin restricting imprisonment for most civil debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=G.

While the United States no longer has brick and mortar debtors' prisons, or "gaols for debtors" of private debts, the term "debtor's prison" in modern times sometimes refers to the practice of imprisoning indigent criminal defendants for matters related to either a fine or a fee imposed in criminal judgments.&lt;ref name="harrington1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/100075454/Judge-Hub-Harrington-Order-to-Harpersville|work=Scribd Research Law|location=[http://media.al.com/spotnews/other/Judge%20Hub%20Harrington%20order%20to%20Harpersville.pdf Shelby County, Harpersville .pdf] Alabama, USA|title=Circuit Court of Shelby County CV 2010-900183.00|date=July 2012|first=Shelby County|last=Circuit Court}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="think1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2011/12/13/388303/the-return-of-debtors-prisons-thousands-of-americans-jailed-for-not-paying-their-bills/|work=Think Progress|location=United States|title=The Return Of Debtor's Prisons|date=13 December 2011|first=Marie|last=Diamond}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To what extent a debtor will actually be prosecuted varies from state to state.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/06/opinion/06mon4.html|work=The New York Times|location=United States|title=The New Debtors’ Prisons|date=5 April 2009|first=Editorial|last=Writer}}&lt;/ref&gt; This modern use of the term debtors' prison arguably has its start with precedent rulings in 1970, 1971 and 1983 by the U.S. Supreme Court,&lt;ref name="tampa1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tampabay.com/opinion/editorials/article991963.ece|work=The Tampa Bay Times|location=United States|title=Debtors' prison - again|date=14 April 2009|first=Staff|last=Writer|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706150424/http://www.tampabay.com/opinion/editorials/article991963.ece|archivedate=6 July 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aclu-wa.org/news/aclu-report-exposes-modern-day-debtors-prisons|work=ACLU, USA| location=[http://www.aclu-wa.org/sites/default/files/attachments/InForAPenny_web.pdf "In for a Penny" ACLU Report.PDF]|title=ACLU Report .pdf Source Page|date=October 2010|first=U.S.|last=American Civil Liberties Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; and passage of the [[Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978|Bankruptcy Reform Act]] of 1978.

* The routine jailing of persons who owe civil debt when such debts are related to child support arrears. Imprisonment for such debt is legally justified by the legal fiction that the incarceration is not for the debt, but rather for not obeying a court order to pay the debt.

In an article in ''[[The American Conservative]]'', Michael Shindler argues that another factor responsible for debtors' prison type arrests is that "Whereas indigent defendants have a Sixth Amendment right to a court-appointed lawyer in criminal cases involving incarceration, indigent debtors in state and local courts have no one to defend them against the error and abuse that characterizes debt collection litigation." Similarly, Shindler writes, regarding explicitly illegal debtors' prison type arrests ordered by local judges,"the reason these officials engage in this sort of excessive behavior is often due to ignorance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shindler|first=Michael|date=September 17, 2018|title=Private Creditors Can Put You in Jail|url=https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-travesty-of-private-creditors-putting-people-in-jail/|journal=The American Conservative|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-A debtors' prison is a prison for people who are unable to pay debt. Through the mid 19th century, debtors' prisons (usually similar in form to locked workhouses) were a common way to deal with unpaid debt in Western Europe.[1] Destitute persons unable to pay a court-ordered judgment would be sentenced to these prisons until they had worked off their debt via labor or secured outside funds to pay the balance; the product of their labor went towards both the costs of their incarceration and their accrued debt. Increasing access and lenience throughout the history of bankruptcy law have made prison terms for unaggravated indigence illegal over most of the world.

== International agreements ==
In 1976 Article 11 of the ICCPR – [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] – came into effect stating, "No one shall be imprisoned merely on the ground of inability to fulfill a contractual obligation."

This international treaty contradicts many domestic laws of ratified states which allows for civil jail.

She has devoted much of her life to preserving the history of the Inuit people. In the 1970s, she was one of the first writers to record their oral history on tape. She then completed the first oral biography of an Inuk, [[Pitseolak Ashoona]], based on first hand accounts.&lt;ref name="order"/&gt; Printed in both English and Inuktitut, it is said that ''Pitseolak: Pictures out of my Life''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eHN85a362yIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Pitseolak:+Pictures+out+of+my+Life&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UWmF6EyUCa&amp;sig=1DK5kf_cLz7dMrhx_CodkKfkWiE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=I73tTK_nF4OTnweo3MGZCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Pitseolak: Pictures out of my Life] {{ISBN|0-7735-2572-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first book, after the [[Bible]], to be published in the [[Inuit language]].&lt;ref name="order"/&gt; Her multiple other works, including films and exhibitions, as well as her written material, have provided Canadians with a better understanding of [[Inuit culture]].&lt;ref name="order"/&gt; She is invited regularly to present at museums and cultural institutions worldwide, international conferences, and has contributed articles to international journals. She has served on committees to judge annual [[Inuit art]] competitions.

==Biography==
Eber was born in [[England]] of [[Wales|Welsh]] and [[Nova Scotia]]n parentage and spent her early childhood in Wales and England. She attended schools in Wales, England, [[Ontario]] and Nova Scotia's [[King's-Edgehill School|Edgehill School for Girls]]. She is also a graduate of the [[University of Toronto]]. After graduation she worked as a reporter and in 1968 made her first trip to the [[Arctic]] to the community of [[Cape Dorset]], famous for its Inuit artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2006/02/13/report-artistic-capedorset.html Cape Dorset named most 'artistic' municipality]&lt;/ref&gt; She returned in 1970 to do interviews with the [[Graphic arts|graphic artist]] Pitseolak Ashoona. The book, with Ashoona's drawings and prints, was published the next year and has never been out of print. Since that time she has undertaken many more interview projects in the North. Tapes for her interviews are deposited in the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]], [[Ottawa]]. Over two summers, she also interviewed many elderly residents of [[Baddeck, Nova Scotia|Baddeck]], Nova Scotia, who worked with [[Alexander Graham Bell]] on the [[hydrofoil]] and the [[tetrahedral kite]]s which he developed there after the telephone made him famous. Her book ''Genius at Work: Images of Alexander Graham Bell'' was published in 1982 by The [[Viking Press]], New York and later by [[Nimbus Publishing|Nimbus]], [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], Nova Scotia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quebecbooks.qwf.org/authors/view/197 Dorothy Harley Eber]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4864">[[File:Ein Gedi Scroll Fragment 2-Shai Halevi-IAA.jpg|thumb|A section of the ancient scroll from Ein Gedi]]

The '''En-Gedi Scroll''' is an ancient and fragile [[Hebrew]] parchment found in 1970 at [[Ein Gedi]], [[Israel]]. It has been carbon-dated to the third or fourth century CE.&lt;ref name="sci"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sci-news.com/archaeology/en-gedi-scroll-deciphered-04216.html|title=En-Gedi Scroll Finally Deciphered - Archaeology, Technologies - Sci-News.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains a portion of the [[Bible|biblical]] [[Book of Leviticus]]. It is significant as one of the oldest portions of the Bible in existence.&lt;ref&gt;Feltman, Rachel. "Technology unfurls delicate 1,500-year-old biblical history".  ''Toronto Star'', October 1, 2016. page IN5.&lt;/ref&gt; The deciphered text fragment is identical to what was to become during the [[Middle Ages]] the standard text of the [[Hebrew Bible]], known as the  [[Masoretic]] text, which it precedes by several centuries, and constitutes the earliest evidence of this authoritative text version.

==Discovery==
The En-Gedi Scroll was discovered in 1970 at [[Ein Gedi]] in [[Israel]].  It was found in the burned remains of a [[Torah Ark]] in the ruins of the ancient synagogue at Ein Gedi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Watts |first=James W |date=2017 |title=Understanding the Pentateuch as a Scripture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jYstDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |page=77 |isbn=9781405196383 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text==
According to radiocarbon testing performed by the Israel Antiquities Authority, the scroll has a probability of 88.9% of dating to 210-390 AD and 68.2% of dating to 235-340 AD.&lt;ref name="sci"/&gt; The scroll was written at Ein Gedi where there was a community of [[Essenes]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]]. Historia Naturalis. V, 17 or 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]] (c. 75). The Wars of the Jews. 2.119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Josephus (c. 75). The Wars of the Jews. 2.119.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Jewish]] sect made famous for their probable association with the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].

The text deciphered so far consists of 18 complete lines and 17 partial lines of the first two chapters of [[Leviticus]]. The text is identical to the [[medieval]] era [[Masoretic Text]],&lt;ref&gt;Laura Geggel, 1,700-Year-Old Dead Sea Scroll 'Virtually Unwrapped,' Revealing Text  ([http://www.livescience.com/56196-dead-sea-scroll-virtual-unwrapping.html Live Science], September 21, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; unlike the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] which have variations from the Masoretic.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Wade, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/22/science/ancient-sea-scrolls-bible.html Modern Technology Unlocks Secrets of a Damaged Biblical Scroll] ''[[New York Times]]'' September 21, 2016. &lt;/ref&gt; [[Emanuel Tov]], of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] described the scroll "This is the earliest evidence of the exact form of the medieval text".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-22/en-gedi-scrolls-'virtually-unwrapped'-old-testament-scripture/7866948  En-Gedi: Ancient scrolls 'virtually' deciphered to reveal earliest Old Testament scripture].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recovery==
The ancient [[scroll]] was discovered in 1970 but was in such fragile state it disintegrated on touch and so was unable to be studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Modern Technology Unlocks Secrets of a Damaged Biblical Scroll |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |author= Nicholas Wade |date=September 21, 2016 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/22/science/ancient-sea-scrolls-bible.html?_r=0 |accessdate=September 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SealesParker2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seales|first1=W.

To read the fragile parchment, researchers used a [[ Micro-tomography|micro-computed tomography]] (micro-CT) scan followed by [[volume cartography]] software to locate the ink within the burned scroll, and thus reconstructed the text of the document.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Greshko, [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/09/computers-decipher-ancient-hebrew-ein-gedi-scroll-bible-archaeology/ Computers Decipher Burnt Scroll Found in Ancient Holy Ark] ([[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] September 21, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saint Grigol Peradze''' ({{lang-ka|გრიგოლ ფერაძე}}) (''St. Priest Martyr Grigol''), (September 13, 1899 – December 6, 1942) was a famous [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] [[ecclesiastic]] figure, [[theologian]], historian, [[Archimandrite]], [[PhD]] of History, Professor.

== Life and works ==
[[Image:Kaplica św. Grzegorza Peradze Warszawa.JPG|thumb|The interior of the Orthodox chapel of St. Grigol Peradze in [[Warsaw]]]]
Grigol Peradze was born in the village of [[Bakurtsikhe]], in the [[Gurjaani]] district of the [[Kakheti]] region, in Eastern Georgia. His father, Romanoz Peradze, was a priest.

In 1918 Peradze graduated from the [[Tbilisi]] [[Tbilisi Theological Seminary|Theological Seminary]], and afterwards studied at the [[Tbilisi State University]] until 1921.

On February 25, 1921, Georgia was occupied by Soviet Russia. Grigol Peradze went into exile in Germany in November the same year.

In 1926 he graduated from the [[University of Bonn]] (Germany). In 1927 he received a PhD degree in History (the title of his PhD thesis was "''History of the Georgian Monasticism from its creation until 1064''").

From 1927 - 1932 Peradze was an Associate Professor at the University of Bonn. From 1933 - 1942 he was a Professor of [[Patrology]] at the Faculty of Orthodox Theology of [[Warsaw University]], in [[Poland]].

In 1931, Grigol Peradze was ordained a priest in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] Cathedral of London; in 1934, he received the rank of Archimandrite. In 1931, he founded a Georgian St. Nino [[Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church|Orthodox]] church in Paris. In the same year he began to publish a Georgian scientific journal titled "''Jvari Vazisa''" ("Cross of Vine").

In the 1930s, Peradze discovered numerous important written manuscripts of Georgian Christian culture in [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], Greece, Italy, Germany, and [[Austria]] (Georgian manuscripts of the Typicon of the Georgian [[Petritsoni Monastery]] (Bachkovo, Bulgaria), the so-called [[Tischendorf manuscripts]] of the Apagae of the Monastery of the Holy Cross at the University Library in the [[University of Leipzig]], Germany, etc.).

The [[invasion of Poland]] by German troops in 1939 made Peradze's position precarious. For him being in solidarity with Jews in peril went without saying; and he helped wherever he could. Nor did he hesitate to visit the imprisoned Polish Metropolitan Dionysios. These activities were viewed with growing suspicion by the Nazi occupiers and Peradze's fruitful ecclesiastic and scientific activities were brought to an end in 1942 when, on May 4, he was arrested by the German [[Gestapo]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/sisauri/language/geo/feradze.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+02:40:16 Lukas Vischer: A Georgian Saint: Grigol Peradze (1899-1942)]&lt;/ref&gt; On December 6, 1942, Grigol Peradze was killed in the [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[concentration camp]] of [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] ([[Oświęcim]]) when he took the blame for the murder of a German officer to spare his fellow prisoners, or, according to another report, when he entered a gas-chamber in the place of a Jewish prisoner who had a large family.&lt;ref&gt;Archpriest Zakaria Machitadze, Lives of the Georgian Saints, trans. David and Lauren Elizabeth Ninoshvili and ed. Lado Mirianashvili and the St. Herman of Alaska Brotherhood (Platina, Cal.: St. Herman of Alaska Brotherhood, 2006), 424-426.&lt;/ref&gt;

Main fields of scientific activity of Grigol Peradze were: the history of the [[Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church]], source studies of the history of Georgia and the Georgian Church, Patrology, history of Georgian literature, [[Rustvelology]] ([[Shota Rustaveli]] was a great Georgian poet of the 12th century), etc.

Grigol Peradze was canonized by the Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church in September 1995.&lt;ref name=kaukaz.pl&gt;{{cite web|title=Father Archimandrite Grigol Peradze|url=http://www.kaukaz.pl/pdf/zyciorys_peradze.pdf|work=Pro-Georgia, Journal of Kartvelological Studies|publisher=Centre for East European Studies, Oriental Institute, University of Warsaw|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Feast Day for St. Priest Martyr Grigol is December 6 (or November 23, [[Old Style]]). In 2013, he was posthumously awarded the title and Order of [[Order of National Hero (Georgia)|National Hero of Georgia]].&lt;ref name=ipn1&gt;{{cite news|title=Mikheil Saakashvili – Georgia will not kneel, or lick the conqueror’s boots|url=http://www.interpressnews.ge/en/politicss/51405-mikheil-saakashvili--georgia-will-not-kneel-or-lick-the-conquerors-boots.html?ar=A|accessdate=14 January 2015|agency=InterPressNews|date=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lewis Henry Gann''' (1924–1997) was an academic historian, political scientist and archivist. Although particularly known for his research in [[African history]], Gann worked in a number of research fields including the [[history of Germany]] and the [[history of the United States|United States]].

==Biography==
Gann was born in [[Mainz]], Germany into a [[German Jewish]] family and was originally named Ludwig Hermann Ganz. In 1938, his family successfully escaped from Nazi anti-Semitic persecution and settled in the [[United Kingdom]]. He was educated at [[Trinity School, Carlisle|Carlisle Grammar School]] in northern England. In 1943, Gann enlisted in the [[Royal Fusiliers]] and served in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=nytobit&gt;{{cite web|last=Saxon|first=Wolfgang|title=Lewis H. Gann, 72, Expert on Colonialist Africa|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/03/us/lewis-h-gann-72-expert-on-colonialist-africa.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=3 February 1997|accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was demobilised in 1947.

After the war, Gann joined the [[University of Oxford]] and gained a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in Modern History from [[Balliol College, Oxford]] in 1950.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; After graduating, he travelled to [[Central Africa]] where he took a research post at the [[Rhodes-Livingstone Institute]] in [[Northern Rhodesia]] (now [[Zambia]]). He continued his studies at Oxford and gained a [[master's degree|masters]] ([[B.Litt.]]) and [[doctorate]] in 1967.&lt;ref name=sfgobit&gt;{{cite web|last=Workman|first=Bill|title=Obituary - Lewis H.

In 1954, he emigrated to [[Southern Rhodesia]] after being offered a post at the [[National Archives of Zimbabwe|National Archives of Rhodesia]]. Gann emigrated to the [[United States]] in 1963 where he took up a position at the [[Hoover Institution Library and Archives]] in [[Stanford University]] as curator of the Institute's African and European collections.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; He was a fellow of the [[Royal Historical Society]] in [[London]] and was an Officer of the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]].&lt;ref name=sfgobit/&gt;

During the course of his academic career, Gann had written or edited 38 books and academic monographs, mainly on the subject of [[African history]] and [[political science]].&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; He produced a number of important works in collaboration with [[Peter Duignan]].&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;

Roberts was a nurse’s aide, and was secretary of the [[University of Chicago]] Hospital local when she was invited by [[Victor Gotbaum]] to join his [[AFSCME]] union staff in [[Chicago]] in 1959. This began a professional relationship between Gotbaum and Roberts that lasted for decades. When Gotbaum became head of DC37, Roberts joined him in New York as a director of hospital field operations, and eventually became Associate Director in charge of organization. In 1969, she was jailed for two weeks for defying [[New York (state)|New York]] Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]] and leading a strike against three mental hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400E4D71331F932A35750C0A9649C8B63&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, after events which decreased her power in DC37, she left the union and was appointed as New York State industrial commissioner, the first black woman to hold such a high post in New York. From 1987 to 1992, she was senior vice president of Total Health Systems, an [[HMO]]. DC37 was involved in a major scandal in the late 1990s, and Roberts' return to DC37 as Executive Director in 2002 was seen, as noted in Roberts' words, as a return to that "old time religion".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dc37.net/news/pep/3_2002/newleaders.htm&lt;/ref&gt; She retired at the end of 2014 and was succeeded by her associate Henry Garrido.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dc37.net/news/newsreleases/2014/nr10_8.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The main feature of Lolita fashion is the volume of the skirt,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thelolitaguidebook.tumblr.com/anatomy|title=''Volume 3: The Anatomy of an Outfit'' on ''The Lolita Guide Book''|publisher=Tumblr|accessdate=11 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808152925/http://thelolitaguidebook.tumblr.com/anatomy|archivedate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; often created by wearing a [[petticoat]] or [[crinoline]]. The skirt can be either clock-shaped or A-shaped.&lt;ref name="K. Robinson 2014 p. 39"&gt;http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_hontheses/11/ K. Robinson (2014) Empowered Princesses: An Ethnographic Examination of the Practices, Rituals, and Conflicts within Lolita Fashion Communities in the United States, Georgia State University, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Components of the Lolita wardrobe consist mainly of a [[blouse]] (long or short sleeves) with a skirt or a dress, which usually comes to the knees. Lolitas frequently wear fashion wigs in combination with other headwear such as hair bows or a bonnet (similar to a [[Poke bonnet]]). Lolitas sometimes also wear Victorian style drawers under their petticoats. For further effect, knee socks, ankle socks or tights together with either [[High-heeled footwear|high heels]] or flat shoes with a bow are worn. Other typical Lolita garments are a [[Jumper (dress)|jumperskirt]] (JSK) and one-piece (OP).&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_theses/87/ Chancy J.

== History ==
Although the origin of the fashion is unclear, it is likely that the movement started at the end of the 1960s with the fashion style and subculture Natural Kei, which romanticized the [[Victorian era|Victorian Period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fyeahlolita.blogspot.be/2013/11/why-is-lolita-called-lolita-does-lolita.html|title=''Why is Lolita called "Lolita"?

Lolita is seen as a reaction against stifling Japanese [[society]], in which young people are pressured to strictly adhere to [[gender role]]s and the expectations and responsibilities that are part of these roles.&lt;ref&gt;http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/1333 Perry R.

== Social-economical dimension ==
Much of the very early lolitas in the 1990s hand-made most of their clothing, and were inspired by the [[Japanese street fashion#Dolly kei|Dolly Kei movement]] of the previous decade.&lt;ref name="hdl.handle.net"/&gt; Because of the diffusion of fashion magazines people were able to use lolita patterns to make their own clothing.{{Citation needed|reason=Where has this been said again?|date=March 2018}} Another way to own lolita was to buy it second-hand.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_hontheses/11/ K. Robinson (2014) ''Empowered Princesses: An Ethnographic Examination of the Practices, Rituals, and Conflicts within Lolita Fashion Communities in the United States'', Georgia State University, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The do-it-yourself behaviour can be seen more frequently by people who cannot afford the expensive brands.&lt;ref&gt;http://eprints.utas.edu.au/15944/ S. Abigail Staite (2012) Atemporal Class-Play With tea and cakes, University of Tasmania, Australia, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because more retails stores were selling lolita fashion the do-it-yourself behaviour became less important.{{Citation needed|reason=
Where has this been said again?|date=March 2018}} Partly due to the rise of [[e-commerce]] and [[globalization]] it became possible to buy lolita clothing by Internet. The market was quickly divided into two main components: one which purchases mainly from Japanese or Chinese internet marketplaces, the other making use of shopping services to purchase Japanese brands,&lt;ref name="Young Kang &amp; T. Diane Cassidy (2015) pp. 371-384."/&gt; with some communities making larger orders as a group.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_hontheses/11/ K. Robinson (2014) ''Empowered Princesses: An Ethnographic Examination of the Practices, Rituals, and Conflicts within Lolita Fashion Communities in the United States'', Georgia State University, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Not every online shop delivers quality lolita (inspired) [[Product (business)|products]], a notorious example is Milano (2014).&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_hontheses/11/ K. Robinson (2014) ''Empowered Princesses: An Ethnographic Examination of the Practices, Rituals, and Conflicts within Lolita Fashion Communities in the United States'', Georgia State University, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; with some web shops selling brand replicas, a frowned upon behaviour from many in this community.&lt;ref name="Chancy J.

Gatlin 2014 p. 93"/&gt;

== Social-cultural dimension ==
Many lolitas considered being photographed without permission to be rude and disrespectful,&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_hontheses/11/ K.

Hardy Bernal (2011) ''The Lolita Complex: a Japanese fashion subculture and its paradoxes'', Auckland University of Technology, New Zealand, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;  however some rules differ or overlap in different parts of this community.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_hontheses/11/ K. Robinson (2014) ''Empowered Princesses: An Ethnographic Examination of the Practices, Rituals, and Conflicts within Lolita Fashion Communities in the United States'', Georgia State University, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Lolitas often host meetings in public spaces such as parks, restaurants, cafes, shopping malls, public events, and festivals.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_theses/87/ Chancy J. Gatlin (2014) ''The Fashion of Frill: The Art of Impression Management in the Atlanta Lolita and Japanese Street Fashion Community'', Georgia State University, United States of America, pp. 103–104.&lt;/ref&gt; Some meetings take place at members' homes, and often have custom house rules (e.g. each member must bring their own cupcake to the meeting).&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_theses/87/ Chancy J. Gatlin (2014) ''The Fashion of Frill: The Art of Impression Management in the Atlanta Lolita and Japanese Street Fashion Community'', Georgia State University, United States of America, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Lolita meetings therefore are a social aspect of the lolita fashion community, serving as an opportunity for members to meet one another.{{Citation needed|reason=Where has this been said again?|date=March 2018}} Many lolitas also used to use [[Livejournal]] to communicate, but many have switched to [[Facebook]] groups in the interim.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_theses/87/ Chancy J.

== Confusions ==
Lolita fashion did not emerge until after the publication of the novel ''[[Lolita]]'' (1955),&lt;ref name="Young Kang &amp; T. Diane Cassidy (2015) pp. 371-384."/&gt;&lt;ref name="M. Christopherson (2014) p. 23"&gt;https://dspace.carthage.edu/handle/123456789/2121 M. Christopherson (2014) ''The Power of Cute: Redefining Kawaii Culture As a Feminst Movement'', Carthage College, United States of America, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; which was written by [[Vladimir Nabokov]], the first translation of the novel in Japanese appearing in 1959.&lt;ref name="ijoc.org"/&gt; The novel is about a physical relationship between a twelve-year-old girl nicknamed Lolita, and a middle-aged man, Humbert Humbert.&lt;ref&gt;http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/1333 Perry R.

Gatlin (2014) ''The Fashion of Frill: The Art of Impression Management in the wAtlanta Lolita and Japanese Street Fashion Community'', Georgia State University, United States of America, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the book focused on the controversial subject of pedophilia and underage sexuality, lolita soon developed a [[Pejorative|negative connotation]] referring to a girl inappropriately sexualized at a very young age&lt;ref&gt;http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/1333 Perry R. Hinton (2013) "Returning in a Different Fashion:
Culture, Communication, and Changing Representations of Lolita in Japan and the West", ''International Journal of Communication'' 7, 1582–1602, p. 1585.&lt;/ref&gt; and associated with unacceptable sexual obsession.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_hontheses/11/ K. Robinson (2014) ''Empowered Princesses: An Ethnographic Examination of the Practices, Rituals, and Conflicts within Lolita Fashion Communities in the United States'', Georgia State University, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lolita'' was made into a movie in [[Lolita (1962 film)|1962]], which was sexualized and did not show the disinterest that Lolita had in sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/1333 Perry R. Hinton (2013) "Returning in a Different Fashion: Culture, Communication, and Changing Representations of Lolita in Japan and the West", ''International Journal of Communication'' 7, 1582–1602, pp. 1584–1585.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2017/05/25/lolita-fashion/|title=Lolita Fashion|publisher=''The Paris Review''|accessdate=6 August 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806085224/https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2017/05/25/lolita-fashion/ |archivedate=6 August 2017|date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A remake was made in [[Lolita (1997 film)|1997]]. The 17 year old [[Amy Fisher]], who attempted to murder the wife of her 35-year-old lover and whose crime was made into a film called ''[[The Amy Fisher Story]]'' (1993), was often called the Long Island Lolita. These mentioned media reinforced the sexual association&lt;ref&gt;http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/1333 Perry R.

Monden 2008 p. 34"&gt;https://dx.doi.org/10.21159/nv.02.02 M. Monden (2008) "Transcultural Flow of Demure Aesthetics: Examining Cultural Globalisation through Gothic &amp; Lolita Fashion", The Japan Foundation Sydney, ''New Voices'' Volume 2, 21–40, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor is that Western culture considers wearing cute clothing when adult to be childish, associating lolita with paedophile fantasies. In contrast, it is more acceptable for cuteness to be part of fashion in Japan.&lt;ref name="M. Monden 2008 p. 34"/&gt;

The [[Lolita complex]] (also known as Lolicon) in writing about Lolita in sexual context,.&lt;ref&gt;http://repository.wellesley.edu/thesiscollection/391/ K. Coombes (2016) Consuming Hello Kitty: Saccharide Cuteness in Japanese Society, Wellesley College, United States of America, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/1333 Perry R.

Coombes (2016) p. 36"/&gt; and refers to paedophile desires.&lt;ref name="K. Coombes (2016) p. 36"/&gt; This expression of the Lolita complex can be found back in the nineties when school uniforms became a central object of desire&lt;ref name="Sharon Kinsella 2002"&gt;https://dx.doi.org/10.2752/136270402778869046 Sharon Kinsella (2002) What's Behind the Fetishism of Japanese School Uniforms?, Fashion Theory, 6:2, 215-237.&lt;/ref&gt; and young girls were pictured as sexual in [[manga]].&lt;ref name="Sharon Kinsella 2002"/&gt;

Within Japanese culture the name refers to cuteness and elegance rather than to sexual attractiveness.&lt;ref&gt;http://nccur.lib.nccu.edu.tw/handle/140.119/79821 A. Peirson-Smith (2015) Hey sister, can I borrow your style?: a study of the trans-cultural, trans-textual flows of the Gothic Lolita trend in Asia and beyond, City University of Hong Kong, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://dx.doi.org/10.4236/aasoci.2012.24038 A.

Tidwell (2010) Street and Youth Fashion in Japan, In J.E. Vollmer (Eds.), Berg Encyclopedia of World Dress and Fashion: East Asia, Oxford: Berg Publishers, 398–403.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another confusion that often occurs is between the Lolita fashion style and [[cosplay]]. Although both spread from Japan, they are different and should be perceived as independent from each other;&lt;ref&gt;http://eprints.utas.edu.au/15944/ S. Abigail Staite (2012) Lolita: Atemporal Class-Play With tea and cakes, University of Tasmania, Australia, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; one is a fashion style while the other is role-play, with clothing and accessory being used to play a character. This does not exclude that there may be some overlap between members of both groups.&lt;ref&gt;''De opkomst van de mangacultuur in België. Een subcultuuronderzoek.'', Lora-Elly Vannieuwenhuysen, p. 48, KU Leuven, 2014-2015.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen at [[anime conventions]] such as the convention in Götenborg in which cosplay and Japanese fashion is mixed.&lt;ref&gt;http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:su:diva-62778 K. Mikami (2011) Cultural Globalization in People's Life Experiences: Japanese Popular Cultural Styles in Sweden, Stockholm University, p. 5-12.&lt;/ref&gt; For some Lolitas, it is insulting if people label their outfit as a costume.&lt;ref name="Y.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4943">[[Religious sister|Sister]] '''Mary Noel Menezes''' [[Order of Roraima of Guyana|OR]] (born 14 July 1930) is a [[Guyana|Guyanese]] Roman Catholic nun and historian. She has been involved with the [[University of Guyana]] since 1967, as a lecturer, head of department, full professor, and [[professor emeritus]]. She specialises in Guyanese history, particularly that of [[Indigenous peoples in Guyana|Amerindians]] and [[Portuguese Guyanese]].

==Early life==
Menezes was born in [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]], [[British Guiana]], to a family of [[Madeira]]n origin. She entered the [[Sisters of Mercy]] at the age of 17, moving to [[Pennsylvania]] for her religious training. She returned home in 1950 and taught at [[St. Joseph High School (Guyana)|St. Joseph High School]] until 1952, when she moved to Jamaica to attend [[Saint Joseph's Teachers' College]]. She graduated with a diploma in education in 1954, and then until 1963 taught at the Sacred Heart Roman Catholic School in Georgetown.&lt;ref name=pidduck&gt;[http://archives.newsday.co.tt/news/print,0,31633.html Sister Mary's brilliant career], ''[[Trinidad and Tobago Newsday]]'', 6 November 2005.

==Academia==
Menezes returned to the United States to attend [[College Misericordia]] ([[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in history) and [[Georgetown University]] ([[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in Latin American history). She taught briefly at [[Sacred Heart College, Belmont, NC|Sacred Heart College, North Carolina]], and then in 1967 took up an appointment as a lecturer in the Department of History at the fledgling [[University of Guyana]]. In 1970, Menezes won a [[Ford Foundation]] scholarship to study at the [[University of London]], where she completed a [[Ph.D.]] (conferred 1973) on British policy towards Guyanese Amerindians in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=pidduck/&gt;

In 1973, Menezes oversaw the creation of a [[Master of Arts]] program in Guyanese history, the first postgraduate degree offered by the University of Guyana. She was made head of department in 1977 and upgraded to professor of history in 1980, the first time in the university's history that position had been created. From 1978 to 1980, Menezes served as president of the Association of Caribbean Historians, the first woman to hold the position.&lt;ref name=stab&gt;[http://www.landofsixpeoples.com/news504/ns5110350.htm UWI honours Sister Mary Noel Menezes], ''[[Stabroek News]]'', 3 November 2005.

==Biography==
Stephens was born in 1938 in the village of [[Treforest]], near Pontypridd, in Glamorgan. He studied at [[Aberystwyth University]] and [[Bangor University]], and at the [[University of Rennes]] in Brittany.

From 1962-66 he taught French at [[Ebbw Vale]] in Monmouthshire. In [[Merthyr Tydfil]] he established the Triskel Press and in 1965 he began the periodical, ''[[Poetry Wales]]''.{{cn|date=July 2018}} He learnt Welsh as an adult, and became a member of Cymdeithas yr Iaith Cymraeg and of Plaid Cymru.

From 1967-90, Stephens was literature director of the [[Welsh Arts Council]]. Before retiring he was professor of Welsh Writing in English at the [[University of Glamorgan]]. He was a visiting professor in the English department of [[Brigham Young University]] (USA).

He wrote many articles about literature in Wales for the newspaper, the  ''Western Mail'', and obituaries of eminent Welsh people for ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref name="archives"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Library of Wales|url=http://www.archivesnetworkwales.info/cgi-bin/anw/search2?coll_id=757&amp;inst_id=1&amp;term=Arts%20%7c%20Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took a particular interest in the life and work of [[Rhys Davies (writer)|Rhys Davies]], the novelist and short story writer, and served as secretary of the Rhys Davies Trust, which promoted the writing of short fiction in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesartsreview.org/remembering-meic-stephens/|title=Remembering Meic Stephens|author=Phil Morris|date=4 July 2018|website=Wales Arts Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months before his death, he was awarded an honorary fellowship at his former university, Aberystwyth, whence he graduated in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/news/archive/2018/05/title-213010-en.html|title=The author Meic Stephens honoured as Fellow|date=16 May 2018|website=University of Aberystwyth|access-date=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He and his wife Ruth had four children - Lowri, Heledd, Brengain and [[Huw Stephens|Huw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patricmorgan.co.uk/like-father-like-son-meic-huw-stephens/|title=Like Father, Like Son: Meic and Huw Stephens|website=Patric Morgan|access-date=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephens is credited as the first person to create the ''[[Capel Celyn#Cofiwch Dryweryn|Cofiwch Dryweryn]]'' graffiti&lt;ref name=online&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/vandals-deface-famous-cofiwch-dryweryn-6740008 |title=Vandals deface famous Cofiwch Dryweryn memorial |accessdate=5 August 2018 |last=Morgon |first=Sion |coauthors= |date=24 February 2014 |work= |publisher=Wales Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the site of the former Welsh village, Capel Celyn, which has come to be regarded as an unofficial "national landmark".&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news| title ='National landmark' Cofiwch Dryweryn is defaced | work = | publisher =BBC | date =29 April 2010 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/mid_/8652096.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Otto Lauffer''' (20 February 1874 – 8 August 1949) was a [[German people|German]] [[Folklore|folklorist]] and [[Cultural History|cultural historian]].

== Life ==
Otto Lauffer was born in Weende&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=|first=| editor-last = Brückner,|editor-first = Wolfgang|editor2-last = Beitl| editor2-first = Klaus|title = Volkskunde als akademische Disziplin: Studien zur Institutionenausbildung.

He studied German language and literature studies, history and art history in [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] (enrolled on 22 August 1891), [[Berlin]], [[Munich]] and again in Göttingen (enrolled 24 April 1894). In 1896 he was awarded his doctorate under the supervision of [[Moritz Heyne]].

In 1902, Lauffer became an assistant{{Clarify|date=August 2012}} at, and in 1907 director of the [[Historical museum, Frankfurt|Historical Museum]] in [[Frankfurt]]. From 1908 until the opening in 1922, he oversaw the building of the [[hamburgmuseum|Hamburg History Museum]] (now "hamburgmuseum"), continuing in his role as director until 1946.

In the same year that the [[Universität Hamburg|University of Hamburg]] was founded, Otto Lauffer was granted the first professorship in folklore in Germany, which he retained until 1939. In 1922/23, he was also rector of the University.

Lauffer died on 8 August 1949 in [[Hamburg]], and was buried in the [[Friedhof Ohlsdorf|Ohlsdorf Cemetery]] there (grave reference: ''R9 (29-30)''). His collected works are to be found in the [[Hamburg University Library]]. On 20 February 1984, a memorial plaque was decidated to his memory in Weende.

The {{lang|de|Otto-Lauffer-Straße}} in Weende and the Otto Lauffer barge in Hamburg are named after him.

== Working life ==
Due to the fact that the posts of museum director and university professorship were both held by the same person, folklore in Hamburg took a special direction after the Second World War, with the focus initially being placed on researching the culture of property.

Als Schwerpunkte im Bereich Forschung und Lehre befasste sich Lauffer mit sachvolkskundlichen Themen. Neben diesem aus der Aufbauarbeit des Museums herwirkenden Bereich befasste er sich auch mit vielen anderen volkskundlichen und kulturgeschichtlichen Gebieten, vor allem in der Haus- und Brauchforschung. Bis heute zählt er zu den wichtigsten Forscherpersönlichkeiten in der Gesamtgeschichte des Faches. Seine Publikationsliste umfasst mehr als 300 Titel. 1951 veröffentlichte er in seiner Publikation "Volkswerk" eine behutsame Abrechnung mit dem in der Zeit des Nationalsozialismus populären Begriff der "Sinnbildforschung"&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.de/books?id=fy2Iq9LPCAUC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=Otto+Lauffer+Sinnbildforschung&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=inQNMrwXC6&amp;sig=2sOASbzNAHGW7H4iw3Koo06t1XU&amp;hl=de&amp;ei=yurMTcrjN8PFswb3_bnDCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Otto%20Lauffer%20Sinnbildforschung&amp;f=false Symbole: zur Bedeutung des Zeichens in der Kultur]&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Rainbow cup''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Regenbogenschüsselchen'', [[Czech language|Czech]]: ''duhovka'' from ''duha'' - rainbow) is a term for Celtic gold coins found in areas once dominated by the [[La Tène culture]]. According to folk belief, Rainbow cups could be found where a rainbow touched the earth and could often be found in ploughed fields after heavy rainfall. They were thought to bring luck and had many different effects ascribed to them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/brill-s-new-pauly/rainbow-cup-e1019850 Brill’s New Pauly - Rainbow cup]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Second Liberian Civil War''' began in 1999 when a rebel group backed by the government of neighbouring [[Guinea]], the [[Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy]] (LURD), emerged in northern [[Liberia]]. In early 2003, a second rebel group, the [[Movement for Democracy in Liberia]], emerged in the south, and by June–July 2003, [[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]]'s government controlled only a third of the country.

The capital [[Monrovia]] [[Siege of Monrovia|was besieged]] by LURD, and the group's shelling of the city resulted in the deaths of many civilians. Thousands of people were displaced from their homes as a result of the conflict.

The [[Accra Comprehensive Peace Agreement]] was signed by the warring parties on August 18, 2003 marking the political end of the conflict and beginning of the country's transition to democracy under the National Transitional Government of Liberia which was led by interim President [[Gyude Bryant]] until the [[Liberian general election, 2005|Liberian general election of 2005]].

==Overview==
The [[First Liberian Civil War]] ended with the [[Liberian general election, 1997]] in which [[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]] took power.

The second civil war began in April 1999, when Liberian dissidents under the banner of the Organization of Displaced Liberians invaded Liberia from Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Crisis Group]], ‘Liberia: The Key to Ending Regional Instability,’ 24 April 2002, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; Guinea became LURD’s main source of military and financial support. By July 2000, the various dissident groups had coalesced as the LURD led by [[Sekou Conneh]]. The dissidents were thought to be mostly [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] and [[Krahn]] fighters of the former ULIMO-J and ULIMO-K.&lt;ref name="ICG 2002, p.3"&gt;ICG, ‘Liberia: The Key to Ending Regional Instability,’ 24 April 2002, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Also important in forming LURD was an alliance, brokered by ECOMOG-SL Nigerian chief General [[Maxwell Khobe]], between Liberian dissidents and the Sierra Leonean [[Kamajors]] hunter militia, including chiefs [[Samuel Hinga Norman]] and Eddie Massally.&lt;ref name="ICG 2002, p.3"/&gt;  Against the dissidents Taylor deployed irregular ex-[[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] fighters with his more privileged units, such as the [[Anti-Terrorist Unit (Liberia)|Anti-Terrorist Unit]], positioned to ensure the irregulars did fight.

Simultaneous September 2000 counter-attacks on Guinea from Liberia and Sierra Leone by RUF – still loyal to Taylor and Guinean dissidents&amp;nbsp;– achieved initial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?action=conflict_search&amp;l=1&amp;t=1&amp;c_country=64 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626083228/http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?action=conflict_search&amp;l=1&amp;t=1&amp;c_country=64 |archivedate=2007-06-26 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;  By January 2001, however, Taylor’s forces were pushed back inside Sierra Leone and Liberia. The insurgents were posing a major threat to the Taylor government. Liberia was now engaged in a complex three-way conflict with Sierra Leone and the Guinea Republic.

By the beginning of 2002, both of these countries were supporting LURD, while Taylor was supporting various opposition factions in both countries. By supporting&amp;nbsp;— practically creating&amp;nbsp;— the SL rebels, the [[Revolutionary United Front]], Taylor also drew the enmity of the British and Americans. British and U.S. pressure on Taylor increased with rising financial support for Guinea and U.S./U.K.-proposed sanctions, a weaker version of which were imposed by U.N. Security Council May 2001.

=== Rebels approach Monrovia ===
[[File:Technical Liberia.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[Technical (vehicle)|technical]] with a mounted machine gun, [[Monrovia]].]]
By mid-February 2002 LURD troops were just 44 kilometres from Monrovia, at Klay Junction, and Taylor was forced to declare a state of emergency.&lt;ref&gt;International Crisis Group, April 2002, p.7, Adebayo, Liberia's Civil War, 2002, p.235&lt;/ref&gt;  The February 2002 ICG report says that this attack was made by pursuing ‘a strategy of infiltration of south-western Liberia through the thick bush of Southern Lofa, looping around government strongholds and disrupting supply lines... while LURD claims between 300 and 500 men were assigned to that mission, ... the number that actually attacked was likely closer to twenty.’ Any image of a large force gradually pushing toward Monrovia is mistaken; ‘hit and run’ raids, rather than a continuous advance, seem to have been the pattern.&lt;ref name="Mats Utas p.213"&gt;Mats Utas, Fluid Research Fields: Studying Excombatant Youth in the Aftermath of the Liberian Civil War, p.213, in Chapter 11, Children and Youth on the Front Line: ethnography, armed conflict and displacement, Dr Jo Boyden &amp; J. de Berry, Oxford and New York: Berghahn Books, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the first half of 2002 LURD mounted raids in Bomi, Bong, and Montserrado counties, hitting, in addition to Klay Junction, [[Gbarnga]] and [[Tubmanburg]], each time temporarily seizing control from government fighters.&lt;ref name="Mats Utas p.213"/&gt;  In May, an attack on [[Arthington, Liberia|Arthington]], less than 20 kilometres from the capital, apparently prompted panic in Monrovia. The state of emergency was lifted in September 2002, after, the government claimed, the township of [[Bopolu]] had been retaken.&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC]] News Africa, ‘Liberia ends state of emergency,’ Saturday, 14 September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2003, a second rebel group, the Ivoirian-backed [[Movement for Democracy in Liberia]] (MODEL), emerged in the south, and by the summer of 2003, Taylor's government controlled only a third of the country. Despite some setbacks, by mid-2003 LURD controlled the northern third of the country and was threatening the capital. The capital [[Monrovia]] was besieged by LURD, and that group's shelling of the city resulted in the deaths of many civilians. Thousands of people were displaced from their homes as a result of the conflict.

A new bout of fighting began in March 2003 after a relative lull and by early May, LURD and MODEL had gained control of nearly two thirds of the country, and were threatening Monrovia. Regional and wider pressure led to the convening of a conference in Accra by the then Chair of the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS), President [[John Kufuor]] of Ghana, on June 4, 2003.

=== Siege of Monrovia (July–August 2003) ===
{{Further|Siege of Monrovia}}
By July 2003 Monrovia appeared to be in danger of being occupied and devastated despite ongoing peace talks.&lt;ref&gt;S/2003/875, para 9, see also Dr T. Jaye, Liberia: an analysis of post-Taylor politics, Review of African Political Economy, Vol. 30, Issue 98, Dec 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. established [[Joint Task Force Liberia]], built around a U.S. navy amphibious group with the [[26th Marine Expeditionary Unit]] aboard, positioned off the West African coast.

In July 2003 the [[United States]] (US) sent a small number of troops to bolster security around the US embassy in Monrovia, which had come under attack during [[Operation Shining Express]]. On July 25, 2003, the [[Southern Europe Task Force]] at [[Vicenza]], [[Italy]] was designated the lead U.S. Army command for the operation.

On 29 July 2003, LURD declared a ceasefire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jul/29/westafrica|title=Liberian rebels declare ceasefire|first=|last=Agencies|date=29 July 2003|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2017|website=Theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Economic Community of West African States|ECOWAS]] sent two battalions of [[Nigeria]]n peacekeepers to Liberia. The first Nigerian battalion detached from the [[United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone]], and the second came from Nigeria itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jul/24/westafrica|title=Peacekeepers 'rushing' to Liberia|date=24 July 2003|website=Theguardian.com|accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== President Taylor resigns (August 2003)===
President Taylor resigned on August 11, 2003, ahead of the [[Accra Comprehensive Peace Agreement]] (CPA) which formed the negotiated end to the war, and was flown into exile in Nigeria. An arrest warrant for Taylor for war crimes committed by his [[Revolutionary United Front]] rebel allies in [[Sierra Leone]] was later issued by [[Interpol]] but Nigeria refused to deport him for a time unless they receive a specific request from Liberia. Vice-President [[Moses Blah]] replaced Taylor.

On August 14, rebels lifted their siege of Monrovia and 200 American soldiers landed to support a West African peace force. Thousands of people danced and sang as American troops and [[ECOMIL]], the Nigerian-led West African forces, took over the port and bridges which had split the capital into government and rebel-held zones. An estimated 1,000 people had been killed in Monrovia between July 18 and August 14.&lt;ref name="redorbit.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/general/14811/rebels_lift_siege_of_starving_monrovia/|title=Rebels Lift Siege of Starving Monrovia - General |website=Redorbit.com|accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Moses Blah]] handed over power to the National Transitional Government of Liberia on October 14, 2003. However, the transitional government exercised no real authority in the country, 80% of which was controlled by the rebel groups.

==Child soldiers==
[[File:Liberian rebels (second civil war).png|thumb|300px|Unidentified Liberian rebel fighters, including [[Child soldiers in Africa|child soldiers]].]]

Both LURD and Charles Taylor made extensive use of children press ganged into military service as soldiers or ammunition porters. The use of child soldiers was prolific by both sides, regardless of prohibitions of the practice in the [[Geneva Convention]]. Observers from [[Human Rights Watch]] described a deadly and chaotic siege of Monrovia, with many very young fighters shooting "shiny toys" they had not been trained to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icij.org/project/swiss-leaks/banks-services-arms-dealers-conflict-its-own-policy|title=Bank’s Services for Arms Dealers in Conflict with Its Own Policy - International Consortium of Investigative Journalists|website=Icij.org|accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drugs made up an integral part of Liberian wartime culture. Child soldiers and other combatants were routinely addicted to [[cocaine]], [[khat]], and other drugs as a means of control. Several warlords felt that cocaine made soldiers more effective in battle.&lt;ref name="vice.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/the-vice-guide-to-travel/the-vice-guide-to-liberia-1|title=The VICE Guide to Liberia|work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|accessdate=2014-09-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140828043755/http://www.vice.com/the-vice-guide-to-travel/the-vice-guide-to-liberia-1|archivedate=2014-08-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Nations peacekeeping==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
In November 1997, following the completion of the mandate of the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia [[UNOMIL]] on 30 September, the United Nations established the [[UNOL|United Nations Peace-building Support Office in Liberia]] (UNOL), headed by a representative of the Secretary-General. That first United Nations post-conflict peace-building support office was tasked primarily with assisting the government in consolidating peace following the July 1997 multiparty elections.

On September 11, 2003, UN Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] recommended deployment of the peacekeeping mission, the [[United Nations Mission in Liberia]] (UNMIL), to maintain the peace agreement. The [[UN Security Council]] approved the mission on September 19 in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1509|Resolution 1509]]. Nigeria sent in peacekeepers as part of the interim ECOMIL [[Economic Community of West African States]] force. UNMIL was made up of over 15,000 personnel, including both military and civilian troops.

The bulk of the personnel were armed military troops, but there were also civilian policemen, as well as political advisers and humanitarian aid workers. On October 1, the first peacekeepers changed their berets and became a UN force, with many more troops earmarked. During three days of riots in Monrovia in October 2004, nearly 400 people were wounded and 15 killed. The UN slowly built up its forces in the country, with 5,500 projected to be in place by November 2003, and worked to disarm the various factions. However, instability in neighbouring countries, an incomplete disarmament process, and general discontent threatened Liberia's fragile peace.

==Women of Liberia==
{{Main|Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace}}
A group of [[Gender inequality in Liberia|Liberian women]] headed by [[Leymah Gbowee]] formed an organization called "Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace" and forced a meeting with President [[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]], extracting a promise from him to attend peace talks in Ghana. A delegation of women organized [[nonviolence]] protests and continued to apply pressure on the warring factions during the peace process. They staged a silent protest outside of the Presidential Palace, bringing about an agreement during the stalled peace talks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/africa/10/30/africa.women/|title=African women look within for change |website=Edition.cnn.com|accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Working together, over 3,000 [[Christian]] and [[Muslim]] women mobilized their efforts, and as a result, the women were able to achieve peace in Liberia after a 14-year civil war and helped bring to power the country's first female president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/06192009/profile.html|title=Bill Moyers Journal .

'''Shalford Mill''' is an 18th-century [[Listed building|Grade II* listed]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1294360|website=Historic England|title=Shalford Mill|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[watermill]] located on the [[River Tillingbourne]] in [[Shalford, Surrey|Shalford]], near [[Guildford]], [[Surrey]], [[England]]. In 1932, the mill was endowed to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] by a group of eccentric young female philanthropists called [[Ferguson's Gang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ferguson: Exhibition Catalogue|last = Bagnall|first = Polly|publisher = |year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[Domesday Book]] records a mill being present on the site in 1086 - one of the five mills recorded as part of the great manor of [[Bramley, Surrey|Bramley]]. In the 15th century, the mill was owned by 'John atte Lee'. In the 16th by Sir Edmund Walsingham and in 1599 it was sold to George Austen.

The present timber-framed building, built around 1750 by John Mildred of Guildford, was unusual in that it originally housed two separate mills, each with its own waterwheel and machinery. The mill was operated for most of the 18th century by the Mildred family, first by John, then by his sons, Thomas and John, and then by his grandson, Daniel. In 1794 it was sold to Robert Austen and remained in his family, later the Godwin-Austens, for the rest of its working life. The eastern half of the mill ceased operation about 1870 and the machinery was removed. The western half remained in operation until 1914. Subsequently the mill was used as a seed store and later as a furniture store.  By 1927 it was unused.&lt;ref name=NT&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kirkland|first1=Sue|title=Shalford Mill|date=2010|publisher=National Trust|pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enter Ferguson's Gang===
In danger of being demolished with its timbers sold off and the land marketed as building plots, [[Margaret Steuart Pollard|Peggy Pollard]], alias Bill Stickers, and [[Brynhild Catherine Jervis-Read]], alias Sister Agatha, of Ferguson's Gang, persuaded the Godwin-Austen trust to donate the watermill to the National Trust on the understanding that the Gang would raise the money for its repair and future running costs. The repair was supervised by the conservation architect [[John Eric Miers Macgregor]] OBE who went on to become an important member of Ferguson's Gang and was given the pseudonym "The Artichoke". He and his family used Shalford Mill as a weekend retreat and his daughter Joanna Bagnall is the current tenant. The titular head of the Godwin Austen Estate, Major Arthur Godwin-Austen was admitted to the Gang and given the pseudonym of "The Pious Yudhishthira". From 1932 until 1966 Ferguson's Gang had its headquarters at Shalford Mill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ferguson's Gang: The Remarkable Story of the National Trust Gangsters|last = Bagnall|first = Polly|publisher = Pavilion Books|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1-909-88171-6|location = |pages = |url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=psZ7oAEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|last2 = Beck|first2 = Sally}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gang's headquarters are opened to the public by the present tenant of Shalford Mill on request. Amongst other 1930s memorabilia there are two bunks salvaged from the [[R100]] airship.

The National Trust converted the eastern half to residential accommodation. The western half with its machinery was preserved and restored though not to working order.&lt;ref name=NT /&gt;

==The Mill==
The mill was constructed to a very high standard, presumably as a demonstration of John Mildred's status. The timber framed building has a clay tile roof and the walls are tile-hung to the level of the brick base.  Diamond pattern [[Leadlight|leaded lights]] echo the tiling. Uniquely in Surrey, it has a lucam or projection of the upper story over the roadway to allow wagons to be loaded and unloaded easily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hillier|first1=Jack|title=Old Surrey Watermills|date=1951|publisher=Skeffington and Sons|location=London|pages=142-147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Machinery===

Originally each half of the mill had two pairs of [[millstone]]s, the eastern sets were used to produce high quality flour for the domestic market.  The western sets consisted of a coarse pair for grinding animal feed and a fine pair for grinding corn.  Each pair was driven by a {{convert|14|ft|m|abbr=on}} diameter [[breastshot]] water wheel. After the eastern side was closed a third pair of stones was added to the western half.&lt;ref name=NT /&gt;

===Millers===
Though the Mildreds were the original proprietors, they probably employed a miller to do the actual work.
After the sale in 1794 the following millers are known:&lt;ref name=NT /&gt;
*John Sparkes, until 1830
*John Lambert
*Charles, Abraham and Daniel Lambert, sons of John
*George Lambert, John's grandson, until 1882
*Thomas and Frederick Botting
*Henry Botting, until 1917.

==Public access==
The mill opens to the public on Wednesdays and Sundays during the summer months.

'''Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment''' ('''SELEX'''), also referred to as ''[[Deoxyribozyme#in vitro selection|in vitro selection]]'' or ''[[Deoxyribozyme#in vitro evolution|in vitro evolution]]'', is a [[combinatorial chemistry]] technique in [[molecular biology]] for producing [[oligonucleotide]]s of either single-stranded [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] that specifically bind to a target [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] or ligands, which are commonly referred to as [[aptamer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hak-Hagir A | title = [The Hak-Hagir skin conduit] | journal = Zeitschrift Fur Urologie Und Nephrologie | volume = 71 | issue = 9 | pages = 639–42 | date = September 1978 | pmc = 362762 | doi = 10.1128/mcb.9.7.2944 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tuerk C, Gold L | title = Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment: RNA ligands to bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase | journal = Science | volume = 249 | issue = 4968 | pages = 505–10 | date = August 1990 | pmid = 2200121 | doi = 10.1126/science.2200121 | bibcode = 1990Sci...249..505T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ellington AD, Szostak JW | title = In vitro selection of RNA molecules that bind specific ligands | journal = Nature | volume = 346 | issue = 6287 | pages = 818–22 | date = August 1990 | pmid = 1697402 | doi = 10.1038/346818a0 | bibcode = 1990Natur.346..818E }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Although SELEX has emerged as the most commonly used name for the procedure, some researchers have referred to it as '''SAAB''' (selected and amplified binding site) and '''CASTing''' (cyclic amplification and selection of targets)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blackwell TK, Weintraub H | title = Differences and similarities in DNA-binding preferences of MyoD and E2A protein complexes revealed by binding site selection | journal = Science | volume = 250 | issue = 4984 | pages = 1104–10 | date = November 1990 | pmid = 2174572 | doi = 10.1126/science.2174572 | bibcode = 1990Sci...250.1104B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wright WE, Binder M, Funk W | title = Cyclic amplification and selection of targets (CASTing) for the myogenin consensus binding site | journal = Molecular and Cellular Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 8 | pages = 4104–10 | date = August 1991 | pmid = 1649388 | doi = 10.1128/mcb.11.8.4104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SELEX was first introduced in 1990. In 2015 a special issue was published in the [[Journal of Molecular Evolution]] in the honor of quarter century of the SELEX discovery.

The process begins with the synthesis of a very large oligonucleotide library consisting of randomly generated sequences of fixed length flanked by constant [[5' end|5']] and [[3' end|3']] ends that serve as [[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For a randomly generated region of length ''n'', the number of possible sequences in the library is 4&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; (''n'' positions with four possibilities (A,T,C,G) at each position). The sequences in the library are exposed to the target ligand - which may be a [[protein]] or a [[small organic compound]] - and those that do not bind the target are removed, usually by [[affinity chromatography]] or target capture on paramagnetic beads.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stoltenburg R, Schubert T, Strehlitz B | title = In vitro Selection and Interaction Studies of a DNA Aptamer Targeting Protein A | journal = PLOS One | volume = 10 | issue = 7 | pages = e0134403 | date = 2015-07-29 | pmid = 26221730 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0134403 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bound sequences are eluted and amplified by [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; to prepare for subsequent rounds of selection in which the stringency of the elution conditions can be increased to identify the tightest-binding sequences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A caution to consider in this method is that the selection of extremely high, sub-[[Nano-|nano]]molar binding affinity entities may not in fact improve specificity for the target molecule.&lt;ref name="Carothers"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carothers JM, Oestreich SC, Szostak JW | title = Aptamers selected for higher-affinity binding are not more specific for the target ligand | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 128 | issue = 24 | pages = 7929–37 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16771507 | pmc = 4287982 | doi = 10.1021/ja060952q }}&lt;/ref&gt; Off-target binding to related molecules could have significant clinical effects.

SELEX has been used to develop a number of aptamers that bind targets interesting for both clinical and research purposes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu YX, Kwon YJ | title = Aptamers: The "evolution" of SELEX | journal = Methods | volume = 106 | pages = 21–8 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27109056 | doi = 10.1016/j.ymeth.2016.04.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also towards these ends, a number of nucleotides with chemically modified sugars and bases have been incorporated into SELEX reactions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keefe AD, Cload ST | title = SELEX with modified nucleotides | journal = Current Opinion in Chemical Biology | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 448–56 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18644461 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2008.06.028 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These modified nucleotides allow for the selection of aptamers with novel binding properties and potentially improved stability.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Procedure ==

=== Generating single stranded oligonucleotide library ===
The first step of SELEX involves the synthesis of fully or partially randomized oligonucleotide sequences of some length flanked by defined regions which allow PCR amplification of those randomized regions and, in the case of RNA SELEX, in vitro transcription of the randomized sequence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huizenga2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Huizenga DE, Szostak JW | title = A DNA aptamer that binds adenosine and ATP | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 34 | issue = 2 | pages = 656–65 | date = January 1995 | pmid = 7819261 | doi = 10.1021/bi00002a033 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Ellington and Szostak demonstrated that chemical synthesis is capable of generating ~10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; unique sequences for oligonucleotide libraries in their 1990 paper on in vitro selection,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; they found that amplification of these synthesized oligonucleotides led to significant loss of pool diversity due to PCR bias and defects in synthesized fragments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The oligonucleotide pool is amplified and a sufficient amount of the initial library is added to the reaction so that there are numerous copies of each individual sequence to minimize the loss of potential binding sequences due to stochastic events.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Before the library is introduced to target for incubation and selective retention, the sequence library must be converted to single stranded oligonucleotides to achieve structural conformations with target binding properties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Target incubation ===
Immediately prior to target introduction, the single stranded oligonucleotide library is often heated and cooled slowly to renature oligonucleotides into thermodynamically stable secondary and tertiary structures.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Once prepared, the randomized library is incubated with immobilized target to allow oligonucleotide-target binding. There are several considerations for this target incubation step, including the target immobilization method and strategies for subsequent unbound oligonucleotide separation, incubation time and temperature, incubation buffer conditions, and target versus oligonucleotide concentrations. Examples of target immobilization methods include [[affinity chromatography]] columns,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; nitrocellulose [[Filter binding assay|binding assay filters,]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and [[Dynabeads|paramagnetic beads.]]&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Recently, SELEX reactions have been developed where the target is whole cells, which are expanded near complete [[Confluency|confluence]] and incubated with the oligonucleotide library on culture plates.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Iwagawa T, Ohuchi SP, Watanabe S, Nakamura Y | title = Selection of RNA aptamers against mouse embryonic stem cells | journal = Biochimie | volume = 94 | issue = 1 | pages = 250–7 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22085640 | doi = 10.1016/j.biochi.2011.10.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Incubation buffer conditions are altered based on the intended target and desired function of the selected aptamer. For example, in the case of negatively charged small molecules and proteins, high salt buffers are used for [[Electric-field screening|charge screening]] to allow nucleotides to approach the target and increase the chance of a specific binding event.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Alternatively, if the desired aptamer function is in vivo protein or whole cell binding for potential therapeutic or diagnostic application, incubation buffer conditions similar to in vivo plasma salt concentrations and homeostatic temperatures are more likely to generate aptamers that can bind in vivo. Another consideration in incubation buffer conditions is non-specific competitors. If there is a high likelihood of non-specific oligonucleotide retention in the reaction conditions, non specific competitors, which are small molecules or polymers other than the SELEX library that have similar physical properties to the library oligonucleotides, can be used to occupy these non-specific binding sites.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Varying the relative concentration of target and oligonucleotides can also affect properties of the selected aptamers. If a good [[binding affinity]] for the selected aptamer is not a concern, then an excess of target can be used to increase the probability that at least some sequences will bind during incubation and be retained. However, this provides no selective pressure for high [[Ligand (biochemistry)|binding affinity]], which requires the oligonucleotide library to be in excess so that there is competition between unique sequences for available specific binding sites.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Binding sequence elution and amplification ===
Once the oligonucleotide library has been incubated with target for sufficient time, unbound oligonucleotides are washed away from immobilized target, often using the incubation buffer so that specifically bound oligonucleotides are retained.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; With unbound sequences washed away, the specifically bound sequences are then eluted by creating denaturing conditions that promote oligonucleotide unfolding or loss of binding conformation including flowing in deionized water,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; using denaturing solutions containing urea and EDTA,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vater A, Jarosch F, Buchner K, Klussmann S | title = Short bioactive Spiegelmers to migraine-associated calcitonin gene-related peptide rapidly identified by a novel approach: tailored-SELEX | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 31 | issue = 21 | pages = e130 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14576330 | pmc = 275487 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gng130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or by applying high heat and physical force.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Upon elution of bound sequences, the retained oligonucleotides are [[Reverse transcriptase|reverse-transcribed]] to DNA in the case of RNA or modified base selections,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; or simply collected for amplification in the case of DNA SELEX.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blank M, Weinschenk T, Priemer M, Schluesener H | title = Systematic evolution of a DNA aptamer binding to rat brain tumor microvessels. selective targeting of endothelial regulatory protein pigpen | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 276 | issue = 19 | pages = 16464–8 | date = May 2001 | pmid = 11279054 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M100347200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These DNA templates from eluted sequences are then amplified via [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] and converted to single stranded DNA, RNA, or modified base oligonucleotides, which are used as the initial input for the next round of selection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Obtaining ssDNA===
One of the most critical steps in the SELEX procedure is obtaining single stranded DNA (ssDNA) after the PCR amplification step. This will serve as input for the next cycle so it is of vital importance that all the DNA is single stranded and as little as possible is lost. Because of the relative simplicity, one of the most used methods is using biotinylated reverse primers in the amplification step, after which the complementary strands can be bound to a resin followed by elution of the other strand with lye. Another method is asymmetric PCR, where the amplification step is performed with an excess of forward primer and very little reverse primer, which leads to the production of more of the desired strand. A drawback of this method is that the product should be purified from double stranded DNA (dsDNA) and other left-over material from the PCR reaction. Enzymatic degradation of the unwanted strand can be performed by tagging this strand using a phosphate-probed primer, as it is recognized by enzymes such as [[Exodeoxyribonuclease|Lambda exonuclease]]. These enzymes then selectively degrade the phosphate tagged strand leaving the complementary strand intact. All of these methods recover approximately 50 to 70% of the DNA. For a detailed comparison refer to the article by Svobodová et al. where these, and other, methods are experimentally compared.&lt;ref name="Svobodová"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Svobodová M, Pinto A, Nadal P, O' Sullivan CK | title = Comparison of different methods for generation of single-stranded DNA for SELEX processes | journal = Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry | volume = 404 | issue = 3 | pages = 835–42 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22733247 | doi = 10.1007/s00216-012-6183-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In classical SELEX, the process of randomized single stranded library generation, target incubation, and binding sequence elution and amplification described above are repeated until the vast majority of the retained pool consists of target binding sequences,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; though there are modifications and additions to the procedure that are often used, which are discussed below.

=== Negative or counter selection ===
In order to increase the specificity of aptamers selected by a given SELEX procedure, a negative selection, or counter selection, step can be added prior to or immediately following target incubation. To eliminate sequences with affinity for target immobilization matrix components from the pool, negative selection can be used where the library is incubated with target immobilization matrix components and unbound sequences are retained.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stoltenburg R, Reinemann C, Strehlitz B | title = SELEX--a (r)evolutionary method to generate high-affinity nucleic acid ligands | journal = Biomolecular Engineering | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 381–403 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17627883 | doi = 10.1016/j.bioeng.2007.06.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Negative selection can also be used to eliminate sequences that bind target-like molecules or cells by incubating the oligonucleotide library with small molecule target analogs, undesired cell types, or non-target proteins and retaining the unbound sequences.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haller AA, Sarnow P | title = In vitro selection of a 7-methyl-guanosine binding RNA that inhibits translation of capped mRNA molecules | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 94 | issue = 16 | pages = 8521–6 | date = August 1997 | pmid = 9238009 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.94.16.8521 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tracking selection progression ===
To track the progress of a SELEX reaction, the number of target bound molecules, which is equivalent to the number of oligonucleotides eluted, can be compared to the estimated total input of oligonucleotides following elution at each round.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sefah K, Shangguan D, Xiong X, O'Donoghue MB, Tan W | title = Development of DNA aptamers using Cell-SELEX | language = En | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = 1169–85 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20539292 | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2010.66 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of eluted oligonucleotides can be estimated through elution concentration estimations via 260&amp;nbsp;nm wavelength absorbance&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; or fluorescent labeling of oligonucleotides.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As the SELEX reaction approaches completion, the fraction of the oligonucleotide library that binds target approaches 100%, such that the number of eluted molecules approaches the total oligonucleotide input estimate, but may converge at a lower number.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Caveats and considerations ===
Some SELEX reactions can generate probes that are dependent on primer binding regions for secondary structure formation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There are aptamer applications for which a short sequence, and thus primer truncation, is desirable.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lubin AA, Hunt BV, White RJ, Plaxco KW | title = Effects of probe length, probe geometry, and redox-tag placement on the performance of the electrochemical E-DNA sensor | language = EN | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 81 | issue = 6 | pages = 2150–8 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19215066 | doi = 10.1021/ac802317k }}&lt;/ref&gt; An advancement on the original method allows an RNA library to omit the constant primer regions, which can be difficult to remove after the selection process because they stabilize [[secondary structure]]s that are unstable when formed by the random region alone.&lt;ref name="Jarosch2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jarosch F, Buchner K, Klussmann S | title = In vitro selection using a dual RNA library that allows primerless selection | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 34 | issue = 12 | pages = e86 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16855281 | pmc = 1524915 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkl463 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chemically modified nucleotides ==
Recently, SELEX has expanded to include the use of chemically modified nucleotides. These chemically modified oligonucleotides offer many potential advantages for selected aptamers including greater stability and nuclease resistance, enhanced binding for select targets, expanded physical properties - like increased hydrophobicity, and more diverse structural conformations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pinheiro VB, Taylor AI, Cozens C, Abramov M, Renders M, Zhang S, Chaput JC, Wengel J, Peak-Chew SY, McLaughlin SH, Herdewijn P, Holliger P | title = Synthetic genetic polymers capable of heredity and evolution | journal = Science | volume = 336 | issue = 6079 | pages = 341–4 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22517858 | pmc = 3362463 | doi = 10.1126/science.1217622 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="82746">The '''Tibetan sovereignty debate''' refers to two [[political]] debates. The first is whether the various territories within the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC) that are claimed as political [[Tibet]] should [[separatism|separate]] and become a new [[sovereign state]]. Many of the points in the debate rest on a second debate, about whether Tibet was independent or subordinate to China in certain parts of its recent history.

It is generally agreed that China and Tibet were independent prior to the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368),&lt;ref&gt;Wang and Nyima (1997) p.20.  Sperling (2004) p.21&lt;/ref&gt; and that Tibet has been ruled by the People's Republic of China (PRC) since 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Sperling (2004) p.17. Shakya (1999) p.90.  Latourette (1964) p.419. Spence (1999) p.500.&lt;/ref&gt;  The nature of Tibet's relationship with China in the intervening period is a matter of debate.  The PRC claims that Tibet has been a part of China since the Yuan dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Wang and Nyima (1997) p.20. Grunfeld (1996) p.256.  Sperling (2004) p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] (ROC) claimed that "Tibet was placed under the sovereignty of  China" when the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1912) [[Sino-Nepalese War|ended the brief Nepalese rule]] (1788-1792) from parts of Tibet in c. 1793.&lt;ref&gt;Sperling (2004) pp.6,7.  Goldstein (1989) p.72.  Both cite the ROC's position paper at the 1914 Simla Conference.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Tibetan Government in Exile]] claims that Tibet was an independent state until the PRC invaded Tibet in 1949/50.&lt;ref&gt;Sperling (2004) p.21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dalailama.com/messages/tibet/five-point-peace-plan|title=Five Point Peace Plan|publisher=The Dalai Lama|date=21 September 1987|accessdate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Western scholars claim that Tibet and China were ruled by the Mongols during the Yuan dynasty,&lt;ref&gt;Feigon (1996) p.58. Gernet (1972) pp.369, 384.  Goldstein (1997) pp.3, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Sino-Tibetan relations during the Ming dynasty|Tibet was independent]] during the Chinese [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644).&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein (1997) pp.4,5.  Feigon (1996) pp.63-64,&lt;/ref&gt; and that Tibet was ruled by China&lt;ref&gt;Latourette (1964) p.253 "an appendage of".  Gernet (1972) p.481 "part of".  Goldstein (1989) p.44 "subordination of Tibet to China".&lt;/ref&gt; or at the very least subordinate to the Qing&lt;ref&gt;Sperling (2004) pp.27-29&lt;/ref&gt; during much of the Qing dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Feigon (1996) pp.86,88,90, in contrast, claims that the Qing had little control over Tibet and compares Tibet with the Vatican.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some Western scholars also claim that Tibet was [[independence|independent]] from c. 1912 to 1950,&lt;ref&gt;Shakya (1999) p.4 "independent state", 90 "international legal status" was "independent state".  Feigon (1996) p.119 "border between the two countries" of China and Tibet in 1917.  Goldstein (1997) pp.30-37 Chapter titled "Interlude: De Facto Independence".  Latourette (1964) pp.333 "practically independent" from 1912, 419 "accepted the suzerainity of the Communists" in 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; although it had extremely limited international recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/china/question-tibet/p15965#p2|title=The Question of Tibet|publisher=Council of Foreign Relations|quote=Western countries, including Britain and the United States, did not recognize Tibet as fully independent|date=5 December 2008|accessdate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] contends that it has had control over Tibet since the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.china.org.cn/china/2008-03/21/content_13268563.htm History of Tibet]&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], which ruled mainland China from 1912 until 1949 and now controls [[Taiwan]], had a cabinet-level [[Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission]] in charge of the administration of [[Tibet]] and [[Mongolia]] regions from 1912.

In the late 19th century, China adopted the Western model of nation-state diplomacy. As the government of Tibet, China concluded several treaties (1876, 1886, 1890, 1893) with [[British Raj|British India]] touching on the status, boundaries and access to Tibet.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14718a.htm The ''Catholic Encyclopedia, Volume XIV. Published 1912: Tibet'']&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese government sources consider this a sign of [[sovereignty]] rather than [[suzerainty]]. However, by the 20th century British India found the treaties to be ineffective due to China's weakened control over the Tibetan local government. [[British expedition to Tibet|The British invaded Tibet]] in 1904 and forced the signing of a separate treaty, directly with the Tibetan government in Lhasa. In 1906, an [http://tibetjustice.org/materials/treaties/treaties11.html Anglo-Chinese Convention] was signed at Peking between Great Britain and China. It incorporated the 1904 Lhasa Convention (with modification), which was attached as Annex.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="treaty1906"&gt;[http://tibetjustice.org/materials/treaties/treaties11.html Convention Between Great Britain and China Respecting Tibet (1906)]&lt;/ref&gt; A treaty between Britain and Russia (1907) followed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tibetjustice.org/materials/treaties/treaties12.html Convention Between Great Britain and Russia (1907)]&lt;/ref&gt; Article II of this treaty stated that "In conformity with the admitted principle of the suzerainty of China over Tibet, Great Britain and Russia engage not to enter into negotiations with Tibet except through the intermediary of the Chinese Government." China sent troops into Tibet in 1908. The result of the policy of both Great Britain and Russia has been the virtual annexation of Tibet by China.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt; China controlled Tibet up to 1912. Thereafter, Tibet entered the period described commonly as ''de facto'' independence, though it was only recognized by independent Mongolia as enjoying ''de jure'' independence.

In the 2000s the position of the Republic of China with regard to Tibet appeared to become more nuanced as was stated in the following opening speech to the International Symposium on Human Rights in Tibet on 8{{nbsp}}September 2007 through the pro-Taiwan independence then ROC President [[Chen Shui-bian]] who stated that his offices no longer treated exiled Tibetans as Chinese mainlanders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.president.gov.tw/en/prog/news_release/print.php?id=1105499543 'President Chen Shui-bian's Remarks at the Opening Ceremony of the 2007 International Symposium on Human Rights in Tibet' Sep 8, 2007]  {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal arguments based on historical status===

Tom, [http://www.fpif.org/briefs/vol5/v5n09tibet_body.html ''Reassessing Tibet Policy''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906034739/http://www.fpif.org/briefs/vol5/v5n09tibet_body.html |date=2006-09-06 }}, 2000 ([http://www.fpif.org/pdf/vol5/09iftibet.pdf also in PDF file] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025063501/http://www.fpif.org/pdf/vol5/09iftibet.pdf |date=2006-10-25 }})&lt;/ref&gt; comparable to other states such as the [[Kingdom of Dali]] and the [[Tangut Empire]] that were also incorporated into China at the time.

The PRC contends that, according to [[international law]] and the [[Succession of states theory]],&lt;ref&gt;For a definition of the "Succession of states theory in international law", see West's Encyclopedia of American Law, edition 2, The Gale Group, Inc., 2008 : "Succession occurs when one state ceases to exist or loses control over part of its territory, and another state comes into existence or assumes control over the territory lost by the first state. A central concern in this instance is whether the international obligations of the former state are taken over by the succeeding state. Changes in the form of government of one state, such as the replacement of a monarchy by a democratic form of government, do not modify or terminate the obligations incurred by the previous government. When the state ceases to exist, however, the treaties it concluded generally are terminated and those of the successor state apply to the territory. These include political treaties like alliances, which depend on the existence of the state that concluded them. But certain obligations, such as agreements concerning boundaries or other matters of local significance, carry over to the successor state. More difficult to determine is the continuing legality of treaties granting concessions or contract rights. Scholarly opinion has diverged on this aspect of succession, and state practice has likewise divided. Consequently each case must be studied on its merits to determine whether the rights and duties under the contract or concession are such that the successor state is bound by the obligations of the previous state."&lt;/ref&gt; all subsequent Chinese governments have succeeded the Yuan Dynasty in exercising de jure sovereignty over Tibet, with the PRC having succeeded the ROC as the legitimate government of all China.&lt;ref&gt;Rene Kamm, [http://etd.ohiolink.edu/send-pdf.cgi/Kamm%20Rene.pdf?oberlin1340040517 The Sino-Tibetan Dialogue: Talk Shop or Path to Resolution?], Marc Blecher, advisor, Oberlin College, East Asian Studies Honors, 2012 April 26, p. 7: "The PRC contends that, according to international law and the succession of states theory, all subsequent Chinese governments have succeeded the Yuan Dynasty in exercising de jure sovereignty over Tibet."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott David Parker, Department of Political Science, Sierra College Truckee, California, [http://www.cpsa-acsp.ca/papers-2012/Parker.pdf All (Geo-)Politics are Local: the Consequences of the People's Republic of China's Military Doctrine of Local War for the East Asia Region], Paper submitted for presentation at the Canadian Political Science Association annual meeting, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, June 12–15, 2012 : "In the view of its leadership, the PRC replaced the ROC as the legitimate government of all China under the succession of states theory of international law. That the majority of the world's states agree reinforces this assertion and serves to isolate the Taipei regime".&lt;/ref&gt;

===De facto independence===
The ROC government had no effective control over Tibet from 1912 to 1951;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Running From Tenda Gyamar: A Voluteer's Story of Life with the Refugee Children of Tibet|last=Freeman|first=Lesley|publisher=Mantra Books|year=2013|isbn=978-1-78099-853-4|location=Winchester, UK|pages=5|quote="With the collapse of the Chinese Empire in 1911, Tibet Declared its independence."}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, in the opinion of the Chinese government, this condition does not represent Tibet's independence as many other parts of China also enjoyed ''de facto'' independence when the Chinese nation was torn by [[warlord era|warlordism]], [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion]], and [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]].&lt;ref&gt;Grunfeld, 1996, p256&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein explains what is meant by ''de facto'' independence in the following statement:

{{quote|...[Britain] instead adopted a policy based on the idea of ''autonomy'' for Tibet within the context of Chinese ''suzerainty'', that is to say, ''de facto'' independence for Tibet in the context of token subordination to China.

We shall, therefore, be grateful if all the Governments concerned on his route would kindly give due recognition as such, grant necessary passport, visa, etc. without any hindrance and render assistance in all possible ways to him.''"

The passport has received visas and entry stamps from several countries and territories, including India, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Switzerland, Pakistan, Iraq and Hong Kong, but not China. Some visa do reflect an official status, with mentions such as "Diplomatic courtesy, Service visa, Official gratis, Diplomatic visa, For government official".

However, acceptance of a passport does not indicate recognition of independence, as for example the [[Republic of China passport]] is accepted by almost all the countries of the world, even though few of them recognize the ROC as independent.

=== Tibet Government in exile (post 1959) ===
{{See also|Central Tibetan Administration}}

In 1959, the [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|14th]] [[Dalai Lama]] fled Tibet and established a [[Government of Tibet in Exile|government in exile]] at [[Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharamsala]] in northern [[India]]. This group claims sovereignty over various ethnically or historically Tibetan areas now governed by China. Aside from the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]], an area that was administered directly by the Dalai Lama's government until 1951, the group also claims [[Amdo]] ([[Qinghai]]) and eastern [[Kham]] (western [[Sichuan]]).&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Melvyn C., ''The Snow Lion and the Dragon'', University of California Press, 1997, p71&lt;/ref&gt; About 45 percent of ethnic Tibetans under Chinese rule live in the Tibet Autonomous Region, according to the 2000 census. Prior to 1949, much of Amdo and eastern Kham were governed by local rulers and even warlords.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

The view of the current Dalai Lama in 1989 was as follows:

{{quote|During the 5th Dalai Lama's time [1617–1682], I think it was quite evident that we were a separate sovereign nation with no problems. The 6th Dalai Lama [1683–1706] was spiritually pre-eminent, but politically, he was weak and uninterested. He could not follow the 5th Dalai Lama's path. This was a great failure. So, then the Chinese influence increased. During this time, the Tibetans showed quite a deal of respect to the Chinese. But even during these times, the Tibetans never regarded Tibet as a part of China. All the documents were very clear that China, Mongolia and Tibet were all separate countries. Because the Chinese emperor was powerful and influential, the small nations accepted the Chinese power or influence. You cannot use the previous invasion as evidence that Tibet belongs to China. In the Tibetan mind, regardless of who was in power, whether it was the Manchus [the Qing dynasty], the Mongols [the Yuan dynasty] or the Chinese, the east of Tibet was simply referred to as China.

The [[International Commission of Jurists]] concluded that from 1913 to 1950 Tibet demonstrated the conditions of statehood as generally accepted under international law. In the opinion of the commission, the government of Tibet conducted its own domestic and foreign affairs free from any outside authority, and countries with whom Tibet had foreign relations are shown by official documents to have treated Tibet in practice as an independent State.&lt;ref&gt;Legal Inquiry Committee, ''Tibet and Chinese People's Republic'', Geneva: International Commission of Jurists, 1960, pp. 5,6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walt Van Praag, Michael C. van, [http://tibet.dharmakara.net/tibethistory.html ''The Status of Tibet: History, Rights and Prospects in International Law''], (Westview, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tibetan Government in Exile views current PRC rule in Tibet, including neighboring provinces outside Tibet Autonomous Region, as colonial and illegitimate, motivated solely by the natural resources and strategic value of Tibet, and in gross violation of both Tibet's historical status as an independent country and the right of Tibetan people to [[self-determination]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} It also points to PRC's autocratic policies, [[divide and rule|divide-and-rule]] policies, and what it contends are assimilationist policies, and regard those as an example of ongoing [[imperialism]] aimed at destroying Tibet's distinct ethnic makeup, culture, and identity, thereby cementing it as an indivisible part of China.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} That said, the Dalai Lama stated in 2008 that he wishes only for Tibetan autonomy, and not separation from China, under certain conditions, like freedom of speech and expression, genuine self-rule, and control over ethnic makeup and migration in all areas claimed as historical Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24097313/ns/us_news-faith/t/tibetans-just-want-autonomy-dalai-lama-says/|title=Tibetans just want autonomy, Dalai Lama says|publisher=MSNBC|date=13 April 2008|accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scholars outside of China say that [[Tibet during the Ming dynasty|during]] the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644), Tibet was independent without even nominal Ming suzerainty. In contrast, since the mid-18th century it is agreed that China had control over Tibet reaching its maximum in the end of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Gernet, J., Foster, J.R. &amp; Hartman C., ''A History of Chinese Civilization'', Cambridge University Press, 1982, p481 reads in part: "''From 1751 onwards Chinese control over Tibet became permanent and remained so more or less ever after, in spite of British efforts to seize possession of this Chinese protectorate at the beginning of the twentieth century.''"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luciano Petech]], a scholar of Himalayan history, indicated that Tibet was a Qing protectorate.&lt;ref&gt;Petech L.,''China and Tibet in the Early XVIIIth Century: History of the Establishment of Chinese Protectorate in Tibet'', 1972, p260&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[patron and priest relationship]] held between the Qing court and the Tibetan lamas has been subjected to varying interpretation. The 13th Dalai Lama, for example, knelt, but did not kowtow, before the [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] and the young Emperor while he delivered his petition in Beijing.  Chinese sources emphasize the submission of kneeling; Tibetan sources emphasize the lack of the kowtow.  Titles and commands given to Tibetans by the Chinese, likewise, are variously interpreted. The Qing authorities gave the 13th Dalai Lama the title of "Loyally Submissive Vice-Regent", and ordered to follow Qing's commands and communicate with the Emperor only through the Manchu Amban in [[Lhasa]]; but opinions vary as to whether these titles and commands reflected actual political power, or symbolic gestures ignored by Tibetans.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Tibet: Volume III The Modern Period: 1895-1959'' edited by Alex McKay, London and New York: Routledge Curzon (2003), p.9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cc.purdue.edu/~wtv/tibet/13th.html |title=A wall painting showing the 13th Dalai Lama kneeling before the Dowager Queen |access-date=2008-04-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010425201257/http://cc.purdue.edu/~wtv/tibet/13th.html |archive-date=2001-04-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors claim that kneeling before the Emperor followed the 17th-century precedent in the case of the [[5th Dalai Lama]].&lt;ref&gt;Grunfeld, A. Tom, ''The Making of Modern Tibet'', p. 42, reads in part "''Both'' (Tibetan and Chinese)'' accounts agree that the Dalai Lama was exempt from the traditional kowtow symbolizing total subservience; he was, however, required to kneel before the emperor.''"&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians indicate that the emperor treated the Dalai Lama as an equal&lt;ref&gt;Laird, Thomas.

Grove Press, New York. {{ISBN|978-0-8021-1827-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Kneeling was a compromise allowed by the Qing court for foreign representatives, Western and Tibetan alike, as both parties refused to perform the kowtow.

Tibetologist Melvyn C. Goldstein writes that [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Russia]] formally acknowledged Chinese authority over Tibet in treaties of 1906 and 1907; and that the 1904 [[British expedition to Tibet|British invasion of Tibet]] stirred China into becoming  more directly involved in Tibetan affairs and working to integrate Tibet with "the rest of China."&lt;ref name="Goldstein art4"&gt;[http://cc.purdue.edu/~wtv/tibet/article/art4.html Tibet, China and the United States: Reflections on the Tibet Question by Melvyn C.

The status of Tibet after the 1911 [[Xinhai Revolution]] ended the Qing dynasty is also a matter of debate. After the revolution, the Chinese Republic of five races, including Tibetans, was proclaimed. Western powers recognized the Chinese Republic, however the 13th Dalai Lama proclaimed Tibet's independence. Some authors indicate that personal allegiance of the Dalai Lama to the Manchu Emperor came to an end and no new type of allegiance of Tibet to China was established,&lt;ref&gt;Alexandrowicz-Alexander C.H.

=== Genocide allegations ===

Groups such as the Madrid-based [[Committee to Support Tibet]] claim the death toll in Tibet since the 1950 People's Liberation Army invasion of Tibet to be 1,200,000 and have filed official charges of genocide against prominent Chinese leaders and officials.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/china-rejects-spains-genocide-claims-481351.html ''China rejects Spain's 'genocide' claims'']&lt;/ref&gt; This figure has been disputed by Patrick French, a supporter of the Tibetan cause who was able to view the data and calculations,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/22/opinion/22french.html ''He May Be a God, but He's No Politician'' By PATRICK FRENCH]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary Tibet: Politics, Development, and Society in a Disputed Region'' by Barry Sautman and June Teufel Dreyer, New York: M.E.Sharpe (2006),p12&lt;/ref&gt; but rather, concludes a no less devastating death toll of half a million people as a direct result of Chinese policies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karmapa.org.nz/news/29/67/TIBET-TIBET-A-PERSONAL-HISTORY-OF-A-LOST-LAND/] ''TIBET, TIBET, A PERSONAL HISTORY OF A LOST LAND'' ''Nov 17, 2008 Category: Book Reviews''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other rights ===

(See [[Serfdom in Tibet controversy]], [[Social classes of Tibet]] and [[Human rights in Tibet]].)
The PRC argues that the Tibetan authority under successive Dalai Lamas was also itself a [[Human rights#Human rights violations|human rights violator]]. The old society, the Chinese government and its supporters say, was a [[serfdom]] and, according to reports of an early English explorer, had remnants of "a very mild form of [[slavery]]" prior to the 13th Dalai Lama's reforms of 1913.&lt;ref name=hr&gt;For existence of serfdom and slaves, see Grunfeld, 1996, pp12-17 and Bell, Charles, 1927, pp78-79; for other forms of human rights violation, see [[Frank Bessac|Bessac, Frank]], "''This Was the Perilous Trek to Tragedy''", ''Life'', 13 Nov 1950, pp130-136, 198, 141; Ford, Robert W., "''Wind Between The Worlds''", New York, 1957, p37; MacDonald, David, "''The Land of the Lamas''", London, 1929, pp196-197&lt;/ref&gt;

Tibetologist Robert Barnett wrote about clerical resistance to the introduction of anything Anti-Buddhist that might disturb the prevailing power structure.  Clergy obstructed modernization attempts by the 13th Dalai Lama.&lt;ref name=leh&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/weai/documents/LEHMN2b.pdf Robert Barnett in [[Steve Lehman (photographer)|Steve Lehman]], ''[[The Tibetans: Struggle to Survive]]'', Umbrage Editions, New York, 1998. pdf p.12], [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1884167365]&lt;/ref&gt;

Old Tibet had a long history of persecuting non-Buddhist Christians.  In the years 1630 and 1742, Tibetan Christian communities were suppressed by the lamas of the Gelugpa Sect, whose chief lama was the Dalai Lama.  Jesuit priests were made prisoners in 1630 or attacked before they reached [[Tsaparang]].  Between 1850 and 1880, eleven fathers of the Paris Foreign Mission Society were murdered in Tibet, or killed or injured during their journeys to other missionary outposts in the Sino-Tibetan borderlands. In 1881 Father Brieux was reported to have been murdered on his way to Lhasa. Qing officials later discovered that the murder cases were in fact covertly supported and even orchestrated by local lamaseries and their patrons—the native chieftains. In 1904, Qing official Feng Quan sought to curtail the influence of the Gelugpa Sect and ordered the protection of Western missionaries and their churches. Indignation over Feng Quan and the Christian presence escalated to a climax in March 1905, when thousands of the Batang lamas revolted, killing Feng, his entourage, local Manchu and Han Chinese officials, and the local French Catholic priests. The revolt soon spread to other cities in eastern Tibet, such as Chamdo, Litang and Nyarong, and at one point almost spilled over into neighboring Sichuan Province. The missionary stations and churches in these areas were burned and destroyed by the angry Gelugpa monks and local chieftains. Dozens of local Westerners, including at least four priests, were killed or fatally wounded. The scale of the rebellion was so tremendous that only when panicked Qing authorities hurriedly sent 2,000 troops from Sichuan to pacify the mobs did the revolt gradually come to an end. The lamasery authorities and local native chieftains' hostility towards the Western missionaries in Tibet lingered through the last throes of the Manchu dynasty and into the Republican period.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pacificrim.usfca.edu/research/pacrimreport/pacrimreport36.html ''When Christianity and Lamaism Met: The Changing Fortunes of Early Western Missionaries in Tibet'' by Hsiao-ting Lin] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626095547/http://www.pacificrim.usfca.edu/research/pacrimreport/pacrimreport36.html |date=June 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Tibet'' By Alex McKay (ed), London: RoutledgeCurzon (2003) p640-1,643 Christian missionaries banned&lt;/ref&gt;

Three UN resolutions of 1959, 1961, and 1965 condemned human rights violation in Tibet. These resolutions were passed at a time when the PRC was not [[China and the United Nations|permitted to become a member]] and of course was not allowed to present its singular version of events in the region (however, the Republic of China on Taiwan, which the PRC also tries to claim sovereignty over, was a member of the UN at the time, and it equally claimed sovereignty over Tibet and opposed Tibetan self-determination). Professor and sinologist [[A. Tom Grunfeld]] called the resolutions impractical and justified the PRC in ignoring them.&lt;ref&gt;Grunfeld, 1996, p180&lt;/ref&gt;

Grunfeld questioned Human Rights Watch reports on human rights abuses in Tibet, saying they distorted the big picture.&lt;ref name=Gru&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/2821 |title=''Reassessing Tibet Policy'' by Tom Gunfeld |access-date=2008-04-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224030617/http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/2821 |archive-date=2008-02-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Barnett, since Western powers and especially the United States used the Tibet issue in the 1950s and 1960s for cold war political purposes, the PRC is now able to get support from developing countries in defeating the last nine attempts at the United Nations to criticize China.  Barnett writes that the position of the Chinese in Tibet would be more accurately characterized as a colonial occupation, and that such an approach might cause developing nations to be more supportive of the Tibetan cause.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/weai/documents/LEHMN2b.pdf Passages extracted by Robert Barnett from Steve Lehman, ''The Tibetans: Struggle to Survive'', Umbrage Editions, New York, 1998. pdf p.9]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese government ignores the issue of its alleged violations of Tibetan human rights, and prefers to argue that the invasion was about territorial integrity and unity of the State.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-04/12/content_6612118.htm Retrieved on 12 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, Tibetan activists inside Tibet have until recently focused on independence, not human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/weai/documents/LEHMN2b.pdf Passages extracted by Robert Barnett from Steve Lehman, ''The Tibetans: Struggle to Survive'', Umbrage Editions, New York, 1998. pdf p.13]&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaders of the [[Tibetan Youth Congress]] which claims 30,000 over members &lt;ref name=chi&gt;http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-04/11/content_6608921.htm '''[[Tibetan Youth Congress]]' is pure terrorist organization'' Retrieved on 13 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; are alleged by China to advocate violence.  In 1998, Barnett wrote that India's military includes 10,000 Tibetans, causing China some unease; and that "at least seven bombs exploded in Tibet between 1995 and 1997, one of them laid by a monk, and a significant number of individual Tibetans are known to be actively seeking the taking up of arms; hundreds of Chinese soldiers and police have been beaten during demonstrations in Tibet, and at least one killed in cold blood, probably several more."&lt;ref name=leh/&gt;

Chinadaily.com reported on the discovery of weapons subsequent to the protests by peaceful Buddhists monks on March 14, 2008: "Police in Lhasa seized more than 100 guns, tens of thousands of bullets, several thousand kilograms of explosives and tens of thousands of detonators, acting on reports from lamas and ordinary people."&lt;ref name=chi/&gt;

And on 23 March 2008, there was a bombing incident in the Qambo prefecture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-04/12/content_7966393.htm''Police crack bombing at Tibetan township government building'']&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-determination ===
While the earliest ROC constitutional documents already claim Tibet as part of China, Chinese political leaders also acknowledged the principle of [[self-determination]]. For example, at a party conference in 1924, [[Kuomintang]] leader [[Sun Yat-sen]] issued a statement calling for the right of self-determination of all Chinese ethnic groups: "''The Kuomintang can state with solemnity that it recognizes the right of self-determination of all national minorities in China and it will organize a free and united Chinese republic.''"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from ''National and Minority Policies, The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science: Report of China 277'', 1951, pp148-149&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, the [[Chinese Communist Party|CCP]] issued a [[constitution]] for the short-lived [[Chinese Soviet Republic]] which states that Tibetans and other ethnic minorities, "may either join the Union of Chinese Soviets or secede from it."&lt;ref&gt;Brandt, C., Schwartz, B. and Fairbank, John K. (ed.), ''A Documentary History of Chinese Communism'', 1960, pp223-224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="revo"&gt;[http://www.revolutionarydemocracy.org/rdv2n1/aiprf.htm "Report on the International Seminar on the Nationality Question"]&lt;/ref&gt; It is notable that China was in a state of civil war at the time and that the "Chinese Soviets" only represents a faction. Saying that Tibet may secede from the "Chinese Soviets" does not mean that it can secede from China. The quote above is merely a statement of Tibetans' freedom to choose their political orientation. The possibility of complete secession was denied by Communist leader [[Mao Zedong]] in 1938: "They must have the right to self-determination and at the same time they should continue to unite with the Chinese people to form one nation".&lt;ref name="revo"/&gt; This policy was codified in [[1954 Constitution of the People's Republic of China|PRC's first constitution]] which, in Article 3, reaffirmed China as a "''single'' [[multi-national state]]," while the "national ''autonomous areas'' are inalienable parts".&lt;ref name="revo"/&gt; The Chinese government insists that the [[United Nations]] [[Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples|documents]], which codifies the principle of self-determination, provides that the principle shall not be abused in disrupting [[territorial integrity]]: "Any attempt aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and the territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations...."&lt;ref&gt;''[[s:UN General Assembly Resolution 1514|United Nations Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legitimacy ===
The PRC also points to what it claims are the [[autocracy|autocratic]], [[oppression|oppressive]] and [[theocracy|theocratic]] policies of the government of Tibet before 1959, its toleration of existence of serfdom and slaves,&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; its so-called "renunciation" of ([[Arunachal Pradesh]]) and its association with India and other foreign countries, and as such claims the Government of Tibet in Exile has no legitimacy to govern Tibet and no [[credibility]] or justification in criticizing PRC's policies.

China claims that the People's Liberation Army's march into Tibet in 1951 was "not without the support of a handful of Tibetan people", including the 10th [[Panchen Lama]]. [[Ian Buruma]] writes:

{{quote|...It is often forgotten that many Tibetans, especially educated people in the larger towns, were so keen to modernize their society in the mid-20th century that they saw the Chinese communists as allies against rule by monks and serf-owning landlords. The Dalai Lama himself, in the early 1950s, was impressed by Chinese reforms and wrote poems praising Chairman Mao.&lt;ref name=Buruma /&gt;}}

Instances have been documented when the PRC government gained support from a portion of the Tibetan population, including monastic leaders,&lt;ref name=mgoldstein&gt;Goldstein, Melvyn C., "''A history of modern Tibet''", pp683-687&lt;/ref&gt; monks,&lt;ref&gt;Ford, R. W., "''Wind between the Worlds''", p178, saying: ' ''There was no sacking of monasteries at this time. On the contrary, the Chinese took great care not to cause offense through ignorance. They soon had the monks thanking the gods for their deliverance.'' '&lt;/ref&gt; nobility&lt;ref name=grufeld115&gt;Grunfeld, A.T., "''The Making of Modern Tibet''", p115, saying: ' ''By most accounts there were some Tibetans who were pleased to see the Han in Tibet. Peter Aufschneiter told British diplomats in Kathmandu that ordinary Tibetans liked the Han because they were honest and they distributed land. Among the younger generation of the nobility it was seen as an opportunity to make some positive changes.'' '&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ATGrunfeld&gt;Grunfeld, A.T., "''The Making of Modern Tibet''", M. E. Sharpe, 1996, p127, saying ' ''When the communists first arrived in Lhasa, only a few of the aristocracy joined them enthusiastically. In Kham, however, the upper classes welcomed them as potential liberators from the strongly disliked Lhasan officials.'' '&lt;/ref&gt; and ordinary Tibetans&lt;ref name=grufeld115/&gt; prior to the crackdown in the 1959 uprising. The PRC government and some Tibetan leaders&lt;ref name=mgoldstein/&gt; characterize PLA's operation as a peaceful liberation of Tibetans from a "feudal serfdom system." ({{lang|zh|和平解放西藏}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/data/minorities/Tibetan.html |title=The Tibetan ethnic minority |publisher=[[People's Daily]] English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/20010719/431559.htm]." ''Full Text of Speech By Chinese President Hu Jintao at Tibet's Peaceful Liberation Anniversary Rally&lt;/ref&gt;

When Tibet complained to the United Nations through [[El Salvador]] about Chinese invasion in November 1950—after China captured [[Chamdo]] (or Qamdo) when Tibet failed to respond by the deadline to China's demand for negotiation--&lt;ref&gt;[http://rss.xinhuanet.com/newsc/english/2008-04/16/content_7987732.htm ''Tell you a true Tibet -- Peaceful Liberation of Tibet'']{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; members debated about it but refused to admit the "Tibet Question" into the agenda of the U.N. General Assembly. Key stakeholder India told the General Assembly that "the [[Peking]] Government had declared that it had not abandoned its intention to settle the difficulties by peaceful means", and that "the Indian Government ''was certain'' that the Tibet Question could still be settled by peaceful means".  The Russian delegate said that "China's sovereignty over Tibet had been recognized for a long time by the United Kingdom, the United States, and the U.S.S.R." The United Nations postponed this matter on the pretext Tibet was officially an "autonomous nationality region belonging to territorial China", and because the outlook of peaceful settlement seemed good.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Modern Tibet, 1913-1951: The Demise of the Lamaist State'' by Melvyn C. Goldstein, Berkeley, Los Angeles, London: University of California Press(1989), p676-9,699,729-735&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn C. Goldstein, ''The Snow Lion and the Dragon: China, Tibet, and the Dalai Lama'' Berkeley:University of California Press, (1999), p41; cited by Yuliya Babayeva in the article [http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1031&amp;context=honorscollege_theses'' The Khampa Uprising: Tibetan Resistance Against the Chinese Invasion''] pdf p15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, ''The Agreement Between the Central Government and the Local Government of Tibet on Method for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet'', also known as [[Seventeen Point Agreement|Seventeen-Point Agreement]], was signed between delegates of China and Tibet on 23 May 1951. The Dalai Lama,despite the massive Chinese military presence, had ample time and opportunity to repudiate and denounce the Seventeen-Point Agreement. He was encouraged and instigated to do so with promise of public but not military support by the US, which by now had become hostile to Communist-ruled China.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Modern Tibet, 1913-1951: The Demise of the Lamaist State'' by Melvyn Goldstein, Berkeley, Los Angeles, London: University of California Press(1989), p761-769,784-812&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 29, the 10th Panchen Erdeni (i.e. 10th Panchen Lama) and the Panchen Kampus Assembly made a formal statement, expressing their heartfelt support for the agreement. The statement indicated their resolution to guarantee the correct implementation of the agreement and to realize solidarity between the different ethnic groups of China and ethnic solidarity among the Tibetans; and on May 30, the 10th Panchen Erdeni telegrammed the 14th Dalai Lama, expressing his hope for unity and his vow to support the 14th Dalai Lama and the government of Tibet with the implementation of the agreement under the guidance of the Central Government and Chairman Mao.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rss.xinhuanet.com/newsc/english/2008-04/16/content_7987757.htm ''Signing of the Agreement on Methods for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet'']{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved on 25 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Agreement was finally accepted by Tibet's National Assembly, which then advised the Dalai Lama to accept it. Finally, on 24 October 1951, the Dalai Lama dispatched a telegram to [[Mao Zedong]]:

{{quote|The Tibet Local Government as well as the ecclesiastic and secular People unanimously support this agreement, and under the leadership of [[Mao Zedong|Chairman Mao]] and the Central People's Government, will actively support the People's Liberation Army in Tibet to consolidate defence, drive out imperialist influences from Tibet and safeguard the unification of the territory and sovereignty of the Motherland.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Tibet: Volume III The Modern Period: 1895-1959'' edited by Alex McKay, London and New York: Routledge Curzon (2003), p.603&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 28 October 1951, the Panchen Rinpoche [i.e. [[Panchen Lama]]] made a similar public statement accepting the agreement. He urged the "people of [[Shigatse]] to give active support" to carrying out the agreement.&lt;ref name="Tibet 2003 p.604"&gt;''The History of Tibet: Volume III The Modern Period: 1895-1959'' edited by Alex McKay, London and New York: Routledge Curzon (2003), p.604&lt;/ref&gt;

Tsering Shakya writes about the general acceptance of the Tibetans toward the Seventeen-Point Agreement, and its legal significance:

{{quote|The most vocal supporters of the agreement came from the monastic community...As a result many Tibetans were willing to accept the agreement....Finally there were strong factions in Tibet who felt that the agreement was acceptable...this section was led by the religious community...In the Tibetans' view their independence was not a question of international legal status, but as Dawa Norbu  writes, "Our sense of independence was based on the independence of our way of life and culture, which was more real to the unlettered masses than law or history, canons by which the non-Tibetans decide the fate of Tibet...This was the first formal agreement between Tibet and Communist China and it established the legal basis for Chinese rule in Tibet." &lt;ref name="Tibet 2003 p.604"/&gt;}}

On March 28, 1959, premier Zhou Enlai signed the order of the PRC State Council on the uprising in Tibet, falsely accusing the Tibetan government of disrupting the Agreement. (see,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savetibet.ru/2010/03/10/tibet_book.html Kuzmin, S.L. 2011. Hidden Tibet: History of Independence and Occupation. Dharamsala: LTWA, p. 239-240]&lt;/ref&gt; for review). The creation of the TAR finally buried the Agreement that was discarded back in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Shakya, Ts. 1999. The Dragon in the Land of Snows. A History of Modern Tibet Since 1947. London: Pimlico, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 18, 1959, the Dalai Lama published a statement in Tezpur, India, that gave his reasons for escaping to India. He pointed out that the 17 Point Agreement was signed under compulsion; later the Chinese side permanently violated it. According to Michael Van Walt Van Praag, "treaties and similar agreements concluded under the use or threat of force are invalid under international law ab initio".&lt;ref&gt;Walt Van Praag, Michael C. van, The Status of Tibet: History, Rights and Prospects in International Law. Westview, 1987, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, this Agreement is not considered legal by those who consider Tibet to have been an independent state before its signing; but it is considered legal by those who oppose Tibet's independence. In either case the PRC did not abide by the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Kapstein, Matthew T. 2006. The Tibetans. London: Blackwell, pp. 280-290&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;International Commission of Jurists, The Question of Tibet and the Rule of Law. Feb. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Timbuktu''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|t|ɪ|m|b|ʌ|k|ˈ|t|uː}}), also spelled '''Tinbuktu''', '''Timbuctoo''' and '''Timbuktoo''' ({{Lang-ber|ⵜⵉⵏⴱⵓⴽⵜⵓ}}; {{lang-fr|Tombouctou}}; [[Koyra Chiini]]: ''Tumbutu''), is an ancient city in [[Mali]], situated {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of the [[Niger River]]. The town is the capital of the [[Timbuktu Region]], one of the eight [[Regions of Mali|administrative regions of Mali]]. It had a population of 54,453 in the 2009 census.

Starting out as a seasonal settlement, Timbuktu became a permanent settlement early in the 12th century. After a shift in trading routes, Timbuktu flourished from the trade in salt, gold, ivory and slaves. It became part of the [[Mali Empire]] early in the 14th century. In the first half of the 15th century, the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] tribes took control of the city for a short period until the expanding [[Songhai Empire]] absorbed the city in 1468. A [[Saadi dynasty|Moroccan]] army [[Battle of Tondibi|defeated the Songhai in 1591]] and made Timbuktu, rather than [[Gao]], their capital. The invaders established a new ruling class, the [[Arma people|Arma]], who after 1612 became virtually independent of Morocco. However, the golden age of the city, during which it was a major learning and cultural centre of the Mali Empire, was over, and it entered a long period of decline. Different tribes governed until the [[French Sudan|French took over in 1893]], a situation that lasted until it became part of the current [[Republic of Mali]] in 1960. Presently, Timbuktu is impoverished and suffers from [[desertification]].

In its Golden Age, the town's numerous [[Islamic scholar]]s and extensive trading network made possible an important book trade: together with the campuses of the [[Sankore Madrasah]], an [[Madrasa|Islamic university]], this established Timbuktu as a scholarly centre in Africa. Several notable historic writers, such as Shabeni and [[Leo Africanus]], have described Timbuktu. These stories fuelled speculation in Europe, where the city's reputation shifted from being extremely rich to being mysterious.

==Toponymy==
[[File:Caillie 1830 Timbuktu view.jpg|thumb|Timbuktu looking west, [[René Caillié]] (1830)]]
[[File:Barth 1858 Timbuktu from terrace.jpg|thumb|View of Timbuktu, [[Heinrich Barth]] (1858)]]
Over the centuries, the spelling of Timbuktu has varied a great deal: from ''Tenbuch'' on the [[Catalan Atlas]] (1375), to traveller [[Antonio Malfante]]'s ''Thambet'', used in a letter he wrote in 1447 and also adopted by [[Alvise Cadamosto]] in his ''Voyages of Cadamosto'', to [[Heinrich Barth]]'s ''Timbúktu'' and ''Timbu'ktu''. French spelling often appears in international reference as "Tombouctou". As well as its spelling, Timbuktu's [[toponymy]] is still open to discussion.&lt;ref name="Pelizzo"&gt;"Timbuktu" – regardless of spelling, has long been used as a metaphor for "out in the middle of nowhere". E.g. "From here to Timbuktu and back."

{{Cite journal|last=Pelizzo |first=Riccardo |title=Timbuktu: A Lesson in Underdevelopment |journal=Journal of World-Systems Research |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=265–283 |year=2001 |url=http://jwsr.ucr.edu/archive/vol7/number2/pdf/jwsr-v7n2-pelizzo.pdf |accessdate=25 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100718075150/http://jwsr.ucr.edu/archive/vol7/number2/pdf/jwsr-v7n2-pelizzo.pdf |archivedate=18 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At least four possible origins of the name of Timbuktu have been described:
*Songhay origin: both [[Leo Africanus]] and Heinrich Barth believed the name was derived from two [[Songhay languages|Songhay words]]:&lt;ref name="Pelizzo" /&gt; Leo Africanus writes the Kingdom of Tombuto was named after a town of the same name, founded in 1213 or 1214 by ''[[Mansa (title)|Mansa]]'' [[Suleyman]].{{sfn|Leo Africanus|1896|p=[https://archive.org/stream/historyanddescr02porygoog#page/n140/mode/1up 824 Vol. 3]}} The word itself consisted of two parts: ''tin'' (wall) and ''butu'' (Wall of Butu). Africanus did not explain the meaning of this ''Butu''.&lt;ref name="Pelizzo" /&gt; Heinrich Barth wrote: "The town was probably so called, because it was built originally in a hollow or cavity in the sand-hills. Tùmbutu means hole or womb in the Songhay language: if it were a Temáshight ([[Tamashek]]) word, it would be written Tinbuktu. The name is generally interpreted by Europeans as ''well'' of Buktu (also same word in [[Persian language|Persian]] is bâkhtàr باختر = where the sun sets, West), but ''tin'' has nothing to do with ''well''."{{sfn|Barth|1857|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=l74ZAAAAYAAJ&amp;vq=well&amp;pg=PA284#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 284 footnote Vol. 3]}}
*Berber origin: Malian historian Sekene Cissoko proposes a different etymology: the Tuareg founders of the city gave it a [[Berber languages|Berber name]], a word composed of two parts: ''tim'', the feminine form of ''In'' (place of) and ''bouctou'', a small dune. Hence, Timbuktu would mean "place covered by small dunes".&lt;ref name="cissoko"&gt;Cissoko, S.M (1996). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=CFXJZboYT30C&amp;dq=%27%27Tombouctou+et+l%E2%80%99+Empire+Songhai%27%27&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=E9vnd8Lpbq&amp;sig=RBio5CbETo7y6N35UinMWDsu7aw&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=wLWrS_75D8mJ4Qb08bDrDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBAQ6AEwAQToumbouctouet l'Empire Songhai]''. Paris: L'Harmattan.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Abd al-Sadi offers a third explanation in his 17th-century ''[[Tarikh al-Sudan]]'': "The Tuareg made it a depot for their belongings and provisions, and it grew into a crossroads for travellers coming and going. Looking after their belongings was a slave woman of theirs called Tinbuktu, which in their language means [the one having a] 'lump'. The blessed spot where she encamped was named after her."{{sfn|Hunwick|2003|p=29}}
*The French [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] [[René Basset]] forwarded another theory: the name derives from the [[Zenaga language|Zenaga]] root ''b-k-t'', meaning "to be distant" or "hidden", and the feminine possessive particle ''tin''. The meaning "hidden" could point to the city's location in a slight hollow.{{sfn|Hunwick|2003|p=29 note 4}}

The validity of these theories depends on the identity of the original founders of the city: as recently as 2000, [[Archaeology|archaeological research]] has not found remains dating from the 11th/12th century within the limits of the modern city given the difficulty of excavating through [[desertification|metres of sand]] that have buried the remains over the past centuries.{{sfn|Insoll|2002|p=9}}{{sfn|Insoll|2004}} Without [[consensus]], the etymology of Timbuktu remains unclear.

==Prehistory==
Like other important Medieval West African towns such as [[Djenné]] ([[Jenné-Jeno]]), [[Gao]], and [[Dia, Mali|Dia]], [[Iron Age]] settlements have been discovered near Timbuktu that predate the traditional foundation date of the town. Although the accumulation of thick layers of sand has thwarted archaeological excavations in the town itself,{{sfn|Insoll|2002}}{{sfn|Insoll|2004}} some of the surrounding landscape is deflating and exposing pottery shards on the surface. A survey of the area by Susan and Roderick McIntosh in 1984 identified several Iron Age sites along the el-Ahmar, an ancient wadi system that passes a few kilometres to the east of the modern town.{{sfn|McIntosh|McIntosh|1986}}

An Iron Age [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]] complex located {{convert|9|km|0|abbr=off}} southeast of the Timbuktu near the Wadi el-Ahmar was excavated between 2008 and 2010 by archaeologists from [[Yale University]] and the Mission Culturelle de Tombouctou. The results suggest that the site was first occupied during the 5th century BC, thrived throughout the second half of the 1st millennium AD and eventually collapsed sometime during the late 10th or early 11th century AD.{{sfn|Park|2010}}{{sfn|Park|2011}}&lt;!--PhD thesis - a poor ref – and needs page numbers--&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of Timbuktu}}
{{Summarize|from|History of Timbuktu|section=y|better=y|date=July 2017}}

Timbuktu was a regional trade centre in medieval times, where caravans met to exchange salt from the Sahara Desert for gold, ivory, and slaves from the Sahel, which could be reached via the nearby Niger River. The population swelled from 10,000 in the 13th century to about 50,000 in the 16th century after the establishment of a major Islamic university, which attracted scholars from throughout the Muslim world. In the 1600s, a combination of a purge by a monarch who accused the scholars of "disloyalty" and a decline in trade caused by increased competition from newly available trans-Atlantic sailing routes caused the city to decline. The first European to reach Timbuktu, [[Alexander Gordon Laing]], did not arrive until 1826, and it was not until the 1890s that Timbuktu was formally incorporated into the French colony of Mali. Today, the city is still inhabited; however, the city is not as geopolitically relevant as it once was.

==Geography==

Timbuktu is located on the southern edge of the [[Sahara]] {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the main channel of the River Niger. The town is surrounded by sand dunes and the streets are covered in sand. The port of [[Kabara, Mali|Kabara]] is {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south of the town and is connected to an arm of the river by a {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=on}} canal. The canal had become heavily silted but in 2007 it was dredged as part of a Libyan financed project.&lt;ref name="retour" /&gt;

The annual flood of the Niger River is a result of the heavy rainfall in the headwaters of the Niger and [[Bani River|Bani]] rivers in [[Guinea]] and northern [[Ivory Coast]]. The rainfall in these areas peaks in August but the flood water takes time to pass down the river system and through the [[Inner Niger Delta]]. At [[Koulikoro]], {{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} downstream from [[Bamako]], the flood peaks in September,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Composite Runoff Fields V 1.0: Koulikoro |url=http://www.compositerunoff.sr.unh.edu/html/Polygons/P1134100.html | publisher=University of New Hampshire/Global Runoff Data Center | accessdate=30 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Timbuktu the flood lasts longer and usually reaches a maximum at the end of December.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Composite Runoff Fields V 1.0: Diré | url=http://www.compositerunoff.sr.unh.edu/html/Polygons/P1134700.html | publisher=University of New Hampshire/Global Runoff Data Center | accessdate=30 January 2011}}. Diré is the nearest hydrometric station on the River Niger, {{convert|70|km|0|abbr=on}} upstream of Timbuktu.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, the area flooded by the river was more extensive and in years with high rainfall, floodwater would reach the western outskirts of Timbuktu itself.{{sfn |Hacquard|1900| p=[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k103743p/f19.image 12]}} A small navigable creek to the west of the town is shown on the maps published by [[Heinrich Barth]] in 1857{{sfn | Barth | 1857 | p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=l74ZAAAAYAAJ&amp;vq=well&amp;pg=PA284#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 324]}} and [[Félix Dubois]] in 1896.{{sfn|Dubois|1896|p=[https://archive.org/stream/timbuctoomysteri00duborich#page/196/mode/1up 196]}} Between 1917 and 1921, during the colonial period, the French used slave labour to dig a narrow canal linking Timbuktu with Kabara.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Jones |first=Jim |year=1999 |title=Rapports Économiques du Cercle de Tombouctou, 1922–1945: Archives Nationales du Mali, Fonds Recents (Series 1Q362) |url=http://courses.wcupa.edu/jones/his311/archives/anm/1q362fr.htm |publisher=West Chester University, Pennsylvania |accessdate=26 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following decades this became silted and filled with sand, but in 2007 as part of the dredging project, the canal was re-excavated so that now when the River Niger floods, Timbuktu is again connected to Kabara.&lt;ref name="retour"&gt;{{citation | title=Développement régional: le fleuve est de rétour à Tombouctou | url=http://www.koulouba.pr.ml/spip.php?article1236 | publisher=Présidence de la République du Mali | date=3 December 2007 | accessdate=19 March 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001095603/http://www.koulouba.pr.ml/spip.php?article1236 | archivedate=1 October 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lancement"&gt;{{citation | title= Lancement des travaux du Canal de Tombouctou : la mamelle nourricière redonne vie et espoir à la 'Cité mystérieuse' |date=14 August 2006 |url=http://www.afribone.com/spip.php?article4208 | publisher=Afribone }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Malian government has promised to address problems with the design of the canal as it currently lacks footbridges and the steep, unstable banks make access to the water difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Coulibaly |first=Be |date=12 January 2011 |title=Canal de Daye à Tombouctou: la sécurité des riverains |publisher=Primature: République du Mali |accessdate=26 March 2011 |url=http://www.primature.gov.ml/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6021:canal-de-daye-a-tombouctou-la-securite-des-riverains&amp;catid=12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724200627/http://www.primature.gov.ml/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6021:canal-de-daye-a-tombouctou-la-securite-des-riverains&amp;catid=12 |archive-date=24 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kabara can only function as a port in December to January when the river is in full flood. When the water levels are lower, boats dock at Korioumé which is linked to Timbuktu by {{convert|18|km|0|abbr=on}} of paved road.

==Climate==
Timbuktu features a [[hot desert climate]] according to the [[Köppen Climate Classification]]. The weather is hot and dry throughout much of the year. Average daily maximum temperatures in the hottest months of the year – April, May and June – exceed {{convert|40|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Lowest temperatures occur during the [[Northern hemisphere]] winter – December, January and February. However, average maximum temperatures do not drop below {{convert|30|°C|0|abbr=on}}. These winter months are characterized by a dry, dusty [[trade wind]] blowing from the Saharan [[Tibesti Region]] southward to the [[Gulf of Guinea]]: picking up dust particles on their way, these winds limit visibility in what has been dubbed the '[[Harmattan]] Haze'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Adefolalu |first=D.O. |title=On bioclimatological aspects of Harmattan dust haze in Nigeria |journal=Meteorology and Atmospheric Physics |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=387–404 |publisher=Springer Wien |location=New York, NY |date=25 December 1984 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/720572u375828w84/ |issn= |doi=10.1007/BF02274004 |accessdate=14 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, when the dust settles in the city, sand builds up and desertification looms.&lt;ref name="benjaminsen" /&gt;

==Economy==
===Salt trade===
[[File:Bilma-Salzkarawane1.jpg|thumb|Azalai salt caravan, mid-December 1985.]]
The wealth and very existence of Timbuktu depended on its position as the southern terminus of an important trans-Saharan trade route; nowadays, the only goods that are routinely transported across the desert are slabs of rock salt brought from the [[Taoudenni]] mining centre in the central Sahara {{convert|664|km|abbr=on}} north of Timbuktu. Until the second half of the 20th century most of the slabs were transported by large salt caravans or [[azalai]], one leaving Timbuktu in early November and the other in late March.{{sfn|Miner|1953|p=68 n27}}

The caravans of several thousand camels took three weeks each way, transporting food to the miners and returning with each camel loaded with four or five {{convert|30|kg|0|abbr=on}} slabs of salt. The salt transport was largely controlled by the desert nomads of the Arabic-speaking Berabich (or Barabish) tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Meunier |first=D. |year=1980 |title=Le commerce du sel de Taoudeni |journal=Journal des Africanistes |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=133–144 |url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/jafr_0399-0346_1980_num_50_2_2010 |doi=10.3406/jafr.1980.2010 |language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are no roads, the slabs of salt are now usually transported from Taoudenni by truck.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Harding |first=Andrew |date=3 December 2009 |title=Timbuktu's ancient salt caravans under threat |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8393442.stm |accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Timbuktu the salt is transported by boat to other towns in Mali.

Between the 12th and 14th centuries, Timbuktu's population grew immensely due to an influx of [[Tuareg people|Tuaregs]], [[Fula people|Fulanis]], and [[Songhai people|Songhais]] seeking trade, security, or to study. By 1300, the population increased to 10,000 and kept increasing until it reached about 50,000 in the 1500s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Maynes |first1=Mary Jo |last2=Waltner |first2=Ann |title=The Family: A World History |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc |location=New York |isbn=9780195338140 |page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agriculture===
There is insufficient rainfall in the Timbuktu region for purely rain-fed agriculture and crops are therefore irrigated using water from the River Niger. The main agricultural crop is rice. African floating rice (''[[Oryza glaberrima]]'') has traditionally been grown in regions near the river that are inundated during the annual flood. Seed is sown at the beginning of the rainy season (June–July) so that when the flood water arrives plants are already {{convert|30|to|40|cm|0|abbr=on}} in height.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Thom |first1=Derrick J. |last2=Wells |first2=John C. |year=1987 |title=Farming Systems in the Niger Inland Delta, Mali |journal=Geographical Review |volume=77 |issue=3 |pages=328–342 |jstor=214124 |doi=10.2307/214124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plants grow up to {{convert|3|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off}} in height as the water level rises. The rice is harvested by canoe in December. The procedure is very precarious and the yields are low but the method has the advantage that little capital investment is required. A successful crop depends critically on the amount and timing of the rain in the wet season and the height of the flood. To a limited extent the arrival of the flood water can be controlled by the construction of small mud dikes that become submerged as the water rises.

Although floating rice is still cultivated in the [[Timbuktu Cercle]], most of the rice is now grown in three relatively large irrigated areas that lie to the south of the town: Daye (392&amp;nbsp;ha), Koriomé (550&amp;nbsp;ha) and Hamadja (623&amp;nbsp;ha).&lt;ref name="schema"&gt;{{citation | title=Schéma Directeur d'Urbanisme de la Ville de Tombouctou et Environs | year=2006 | url=http://www.logements.gouv.ml/documentation/schema_directeur_tombouctou.pdf | publisher=Ministère de l'Habitat et de l'Urbanisme, République du Mali | place=Bamako, Mali | language=French | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110428074053/http://www.logements.gouv.ml/documentation/schema_directeur_tombouctou.pdf | archivedate=28 April 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Water is pumped from the river using ten large [[Archimedes' screw]]s which were first installed in the 1990s. The irrigated areas are run as [[cooperative]]s with approximately 2,100 families cultivating small plots.&lt;ref name="USAIDcircle"&gt;{{citation | title=Synthèse des Plan de Securité Alimentaire des Communes du Circle de Tombouctou 2006–2010 | publisher=Commissariat à la Sécurité Alimentaire, République du Mali, USAID-Mali | year=2006 | url=http://www.aec.msu.edu/fs2/mali_fd_strtgy/plans/tombouctou/tombouctou/synthese_cercle_tombouctou.pdf | language=French | access-date=2 May 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906163402/http://www.aec.msu.edu/fs2/mali_fd_strtgy/plans/tombouctou/tombouctou/synthese_cercle_tombouctou.pdf | archive-date=6 September 2011 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all the rice produced is consumed by the families themselves. The yields are still relatively low and the farmers are being encouraged to change their agricultural practices.&lt;ref name="styger"&gt;{{citation |last=Styger |first=Erika |year=2010 |title=Introducing the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) to irrigated systems in Gao, Mopti, Timbuktu and to rainfed systems in Sikasso |publisher=USAID, Initiatives Intégrées pour la Croissance Économique au Mali, Abt Associates |place=Bamako, Mali |url=http://sri.ciifad.cornell.edu/countries/mali/Mali_IICEMStyger2009_2010.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tourism===
Most tourists visit Timbuktu between November and February when the air temperature is lower. In the 1980s, accommodation for the small number of tourists was provided by two small hotels: Hotel Bouctou and Hotel Azalaï.&lt;ref name="desherence"&gt;{{citation |last=Sayah |first=Moulaye |title=Tombouctou : le tourisme en desherence |url=http://www.essor.ml/regions/article/tombouctou-le-tourisme-en |publisher=L'Essor |date=3 October 2011 |accessdate=28 November 2011 |language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following decades the tourist numbers increased so that by 2006 there were seven small hotels and guest houses.&lt;ref name="schema" /&gt; The town benefited by the revenue from the CFA&amp;nbsp;5000 tourist tax,&lt;ref name="schema" /&gt; by the sale of handicrafts and by the employment for the guides.

====Attacks====
Starting in 2008 the [[Al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb]] began kidnapping groups of tourists in the Sahel region.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Travelling and living abroad: Sahel | publisher=United Kingdom Foreign and Commonwealth Office | url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/your-trip/sahel | accessdate=1 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009, four tourists were kidnapped near the Mali–Niger border after attending a cultural festival at [[Anderamboukané]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUKLM333916 | title= Mali says Tuareg rebels abduct group of tourists | date= 22 January 2009 | publisher=Reuters | accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these tourists was subsequently murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Al-Qaeda 'kills British hostage' | date=3 June 2009 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8080447.stm | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=1 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this and various other incidents a number of states including France,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Mali: Securite  | url=http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/conseils-aux-voyageurs/conseils-par-pays/mali-12287/ | publisher=Ministère des affaires étrangères et européennes | accessdate=28 November 2011 | language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher=United Kingdom Foreign and Commonwealth Office | title=Mali travel advice | url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/sub-saharan-africa/mali | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004045843/http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/sub-saharan-africa/mali | dead-url=yes | archive-date=4 October 2009 | accessdate=28 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the US,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Travel Warning US Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs: Mali | url=https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/tw/tw_5360.html | publisher=US Department of State | date=4 October 2011 | accessdate=28 November 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126112805/http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/tw/tw_5360.html | archive-date=26 November 2011 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; began advising their citizens to avoid travelling far from Bamako.

Because of the security concerns, the Malian government moved the 2010 [[Festival au Désert|Festival in the Desert]] from [[Essakane]] to the outskirts of Timbuktu.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Togola |first=Diakaridia |title=Festival sur le désert : Essakane a vibré au rythme de la 10ème édition |url=http://www.maliweb.net/category.php?NID=55243 |language=French |publisher=Le Quotidien de Bamako |date=11 January 2010 |accessdate=25 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415085152/http://www.maliweb.net/category.php?NID=55243 |archivedate=15 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Tombouctou: Le Festival du Désert aura bien lieu | publisher=Primature: Portail Officiel du Gouvernement Mali | url=http://www.primature.gov.ml/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5562:tombouctou-le-festival-du-desert-aura-bien-lieu&amp;catid=12 | date=28 October 2010 | accessdate=25 December 2011 | language=French | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924082337/http://www.primature.gov.ml/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5562%3Atombouctou-le-festival-du-desert-aura-bien-lieu&amp;catid=12 | archivedate=24 September 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 2011, gunmen attacked tourists staying at a hotel in Timbuktu, killing one of them and kidnapping three others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Mali kidnapping: One dead and three seized in Timbuktu | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15895908 | date=25 November 2011 | publisher= BBC News | accessdate=28 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Sayad |first=Moulaye |title=Tombouctou : Sous le Choc |date=28 November 2011 |publisher=L'Essor |url= http://www.essor.ml/regions/article/tombouctou-sous-le-choc |language=French |accessdate=1 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first terrorist incident in Timbuktu itself.

On 1 April 2012, one day after the capture of [[Gao]], Timbuktu was captured from the Malian military by the [[2012 Tuareg rebellion|Tuareg rebels]] of the [[National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad|MNLA]] and [[Ansar Dine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Callimachi |first=Rukmini |url=http://www.ajc.com/news/nation-world/mali-coup-leader-reinstates-1403759.html |title=Mali coup leader reinstates old constitution |date=1 April 2012 |work=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five days later, the MNLA declared the region independent of Mali as the nation of [[Azawad]].&lt;ref name="english.alarabiya.net"&gt;{{citation|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/04/06/205763.html|agency=Al Arabiya|title=Tuareg rebels declare the independence of Azawad, north of Mali|date=6 April 2012|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The declared political entity was not recognized by any regional nations or the international community and it collapsed three months later on 12 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Moseley |first=Walter G. |title=Azawad: the latest African Border Dilemma |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/04/20124149184982408.html |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 January 2013, French and Malian government troops began retaking Timbuktu from the Islamist rebels.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Diarra |first=Adam |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/28/us-mali-rebels-idUSBRE90O0C720130128 |title=French seal off Mali's Timbuktu, rebels torch library |publisher=Reuters |date=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The force of 1,000 French troops with 200 Malian soldiers retook Timbuktu without a fight. The Islamist groups had already fled north a few days earlier, having set fire to the [[Ahmed Baba Institute]], which housed many important manuscripts. The building housing the Ahmed Baba Institute was funded by South Africa, and held 30,000 manuscripts. BBC World Service radio news reported on 29 January 2013 that approximately 28,000 of the manuscripts in the Institute had been removed to safety from the premises before the attack by the Islamist groups, and that the whereabouts of about 2,000 manuscripts remained unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shamil |first=Jeppie |title=Timbuktu Manuscripts Project |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21242689 |accessdate=29 January 2013 |publisher=BBC News |date=29 January 2013}} Also broadcast BBC World Service news on 29 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It was intended to be a resource for Islamic research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |url=http://africajournalismtheworld.com/tag/timbuktu-library-burned/ |title=Mali – Islamists Rebels Burn Manuscript Library as They Leave Timbuktu |publisher=Reuters (via Africa –  News and Analysis) |date=28 January 2013 |accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 March 2013, jihadist rebels [[2nd Battle of Timbuktu|infiltrated]] into Timbuktu nine days before a [[Battle of Timbuktu|suicide bombing]] on a Malian army checkpoint at the international airport killing a soldier. Fighting lasted until 1 April, when French warplanes helped Malian ground forces chase the remaining rebels out of the city center.

==Early accounts==
Tales of Timbuktu's fabulous wealth helped prompt European exploration of the west coast of Africa. Among the most famous descriptions of Timbuktu are those of [[Leo Africanus]] and Shabeni.

===Leo Africanus===

Perhaps most famous among the accounts written about Timbuktu is that by [[Leo Africanus]]. Born El Hasan ben Muhammed el- Wazzan-ez-Zayyati in [[Granada]] in 1485, his family was among the thousands of Muslims expelled by King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella after their [[Granada War|reconquest of Spain]] in 1492. They settled in [[Morocco]], where he studied in [[Fes]] and accompanied his uncle on diplomatic missions throughout North Africa. During these travels, he visited Timbuktu. As a young man he was captured by pirates and presented as an exceptionally learned slave to [[Pope Leo X]], who freed him, [[baptism|baptized]] him under the name "Johannis Leo de Medici", and commissioned him to write, in Italian, a detailed survey of Africa. His accounts provided most of what Europeans [[European exploration of Africa|knew about the continent]] for the next several centuries.{{sfn|Leo Africanus|1896}} Describing Timbuktu when the [[Songhai Empire]] was at its height, the English edition of his book includes the description:
{{Quote|quote = The rich king of Tombuto hath many plates and sceptres of gold, some whereof weigh 1300 pounds. ... He hath always 3000 horsemen ... (and) a great store of doctors, judges, priests, and other learned men, that are bountifully maintained at the king's cost and charges. |source = [[Leo Africanus]], ''[[Description of Africa (1550 book)|Descrittione dell' Africa]]''{{sfn|Leo Africanus|1896|p=[https://archive.org/stream/historyanddescr02porygoog#page/n140/mode/1up 824 Vol. 3]}} |width = 30% |align = right }}

According to Leo Africanus, there were abundant supplies of locally produced corn, cattle, milk and butter, though there were neither gardens nor orchards surrounding the city.&lt;ref name=brians&gt;{{cite book |last=Brians |first=Paul |title=Reading About the World |publisher=Harcourt Brace College Publishing |year=1998 |location=Fort Worth, TX, USA |pages=vol. II |url=http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~wldciv/world_civ_reader/world_civ_reader_2/leo_africanus.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; In another passage dedicated to describing the wealth of both the environment and the king, Africanus touches upon the rarity of one of Timbuktu's trade commodities: salt.
{{Quote|quote = The inhabitants are very rich, especially the strangers who have settled in the country [..] But salt is in very short supply because it is carried here from [[Tegaza]], some {{convert|500|mi|0|abbr=out}} from Timbuktu. I happened to be in this city at a time when a load of salt sold for eighty [[ducats]]. The king has a rich treasure of coins and [[ingot|gold ingots]]. |source = [[Leo Africanus]], ''[[Description of Africa (1550 book)|Descrittione dell' Africa]]'' in Paul Brians' ''Reading About the World'', Volume 2&lt;ref name=brians/&gt;|width = 30% |align = right}}

These descriptions and passages alike caught the attention of European explorers. Africanus, though, also described the more mundane aspects of the city, such as the "cottages built of [[chalk]], and covered with [[thatch]]" – although these went largely unheeded.{{sfn|Insoll|2004}}

===Shabeni===
{{Quote box |quote = The natives of the town of Timbuctoo may be computed at 40,000, exclusive of slaves and foreigners ... The natives are all blacks: almost every stranger marries a female of the town, who are so beautiful that travellers often fall in love with them at first sight.|source = – Shabeni in {{Ill|James Grey Jackson|fr|lt=James Grey Jackson's}} ''An Account of Timbuctoo and Hausa'', 1820{{sfn|Jackson|1820|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=BAtFAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 10]}} |width = 30% |align = right }}
Roughly 250 years after Leo Africanus' visit to Timbuktu, the city had seen many rulers. The end of the 18th century saw the grip of the Moroccan rulers on the city wane, resulting in a period of unstable government by quickly changing tribes. During the rule of one of those tribes, the [[Hausa people|Hausa]], a 14-year-old child named Shabeni (or Shabeeny) from [[Tetuan]] on the north coast of Morocco accompanied his father on a visit to Timbuktu.{{sfn|Jackson|1820}}

Shabeni stayed in Timbuktu for three years before moving to a major city called [[Housa]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/stable/221615 A paper] from 1995 says this was "apparently one of the [[Maraka]] towns". [https://books.google.fr/books?id=x_5ZDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA154&amp;lpg=PA154&amp;dq=housa+%22niger+River%22+-house&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gGqQVINS4J&amp;sig=kmYvmWvD_gVAjhb6otz-ER7sRUI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiN6PPCjNvcAhUyzoUKHZXUB6YQ6AEwEHoECDsQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=housa%20%22niger%20River%22%20-house&amp;f=false A book] of letters to [[Thomas Jefferson]] mentions in connexion to a letter of 1798 that explorer [[Mungo Park (explorer)|Mungo Park]] had tried unsuccessfully to find Housa and Timbuktu (1795-7). In a later expedition he went near Timbuktu while descending the [[Niger River]]. After being attacked many times by Africans he drowned in the river.&lt;/ref&gt; several days journey to the southeast. Two years later, he returned to Timbuktu to live there for another seven years – one of a population that was even centuries after its peak and excluding slaves, double the size of the 21st-century town.

By the time Shabeni was 27, he was an established merchant in his hometown of Tetuan. He made a two-year pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] and thus became  a [[hajji]], Asseed El Hage Abd Salam Shabeeny. Returning from a trading voyage to [[History of Hamburg|Hamburg]], he was captured by a ship manned by Englishmen but sailing under a Russian flag, whose captain claimed that his Imperial mistress ([[Catherine the Great]]) was "at war with all Muselmen" (see [[Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792)]]). He and the ship he had been sailing in were brought to [[Ostend]] in Belgium in December 1789 but the British consul managed to get him and the ship released. He set off again in the same ship, but the captain, who claimed to be afraid of his ship being captured again, set him ashore in [[Dover]]. In England his story was recorded. Shabeeni gave an indication of the size of the city in the second half of the 18th century. In an earlier passage, he described an environment that was characterized by forest, as opposed to nowadays' arid surroundings.

===Cultural events===
The most well-known cultural event is the [[Festival au Désert]].&lt;ref name=reiser/&gt; When the Tuareg rebellion ended in 1996 under the Konaré administration, 3,000 weapons were burned in a ceremony dubbed the Flame of Peace on 29 March 2007 – to commemorate the ceremony, a monument was built.{{sfn|Jeppie|2008}} The [[Festival au Désert]], to celebrate the [[peace treaty]], is held near the city in January.&lt;ref name=reiser&gt;{{Cite book |last=Reiser |first=Melissa Diane |title=Festival au Desert, Essakane, Mali: a postcolonial, postwar Tuareg experiment |publisher=University of Wisconsin – Madison |year=2007 |location=Madison |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=47FfAAAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Heritage Site===
During its twelfth session, in December 1988, the [[World Heritage Committee]] (WHC) selected parts of Timbuktu's historic centre for inscription on its [[List of World Heritage Sites in Africa|World Heritage list]].&lt;ref name=whsselection&gt;{{Citation  | contribution = Report of the World Heritage Committee Twelfth Session   | contribution-url = http://whc.unesco.org/archive/repcom88.htm#119  |title=Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage | series = | year = 1988 | place = Brasilia | publisher=UNESCO | url = http://whc.unesco.org/archive/repcom88.htm  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The selection was based on three [[World Heritage Site#Cultural criteria|criteria]]:&lt;ref name=ICOMOS/&gt;
*Criterion II: Timbuktu's holy places were vital to early [[Islamization]] in Africa.
*Criterion IV: Timbuktu's mosques show a cultural and scholarly [[Golden Age]] during the [[Songhay Empire]].
*Criterion V: The construction of the mosques, still mostly original, shows the use of traditional building techniques.

An earlier nomination in 1979 failed the following year as it lacked proper demarcation:&lt;ref name=ICOMOS&gt;{{cite web |last=[[ICOMOS]] |title=Advisory Body Evaluation of Timbuktu Nomination |publisher=UNESCO |date=14 May 1979 |url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/advisory_body_evaluation/119.pdf |accessdate=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Malian government included the town of Timbuktu as a whole in the wish for inclusion.&lt;ref name=orignom&gt;{{cite web |last=Mali Government |title=Nomination No. 119 |work=Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage |publisher=UNESCO |date=14 May 1979 |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0003/000377/037756eb.pdf |accessdate=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Close to a decade later, three mosques and 16 [[mausoleum]]s or cemeteries were selected from the Old Town for [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage status]]: with this conclusion came the call for protection of the buildings' conditions, an exclusion of new construction works near the sites and measures against the [[desertification|encroaching sand]].

Shortly afterwards, the monuments were placed on the [[List of World Heritage in Danger]] by the [[Politics of Mali|Malian government]], as  by the selection committee at the time of nomination.&lt;ref name=whsselection/&gt; The first period on the Danger List lasted from 1990 until 2005, when a range of measures including restoration work and the compilation of an inventory warranted "its removal from the Danger List".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Amelan |first=Roni |title=Three Sites Withdrawn from UNESCO's List of World Heritage in Danger |work=World Heritage Convention News &amp; Events |publisher=UNESCO |date=13 July 2005 |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/133/ |accessdate=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the WHC placed the protected area under increased scrutiny dubbed "reinforced monitoring", a measure made possible in 2007, as the impact of planned construction work was unclear.

During a session in June 2009, [[UNESCO]] decided to cease its increased monitoring program as it felt sufficient progress had been made to address the initial concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Decision 33COM 7B.45 – Timbuktu (Mali) | series = Final Decisions of the 33rd Session of the WHC | place = Seville | year = 2009 | url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/decisions/1837}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the takeover of Timbuktu by MNLA and the Islamist group Ansar Dine, it was returned to the List of World Heritage in Danger in 2012.&lt;ref name=TimbuktuDamageJune&gt;{{cite news | title=Timbuktu shrines damaged by Mali Ansar Dine Islamists | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18657463 | publisher=BBC News | date=30 June 2012 | accessdate=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Centre of learning===
[[File:Timbuktu-manuscripts-astronomy-mathematics.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Timbuktu Manuscripts]] showing both [[mathematics]] and a heritage of [[astronomy in medieval Islam]].]]
Timbuktu was a world centre of Islamic learning from the 13th to the 17th century, especially under the Mali Empire and Askia Mohammad I's rule. The Malian government and NGOs have been working to catalog and restore the remnants of this scholarly legacy: Timbuktu's manuscripts.&lt;ref name=Huddleston&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Huddleston |first=Alexandra |title=Divine Learning: The Traditional Islamic Scholarship of Timbuktu |journal=Fourth Genre: Explorations in Non-Fiction |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=129–135 |date=1 September 2009 |issn=1522-3868 |doi=10.1353/fge.0.0080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timbuktu's rapid economic growth in the 13th and 14th centuries drew many scholars from nearby [[Walata]] (today in [[Mauretania]]),{{sfn|Cleaveland|2008}} leading up to the city's golden age in the 15th and 16th centuries that proved fertile ground for scholarship of religions, arts and sciences. To the people of Timbuktu, literacy and books were symbols of wealth, power, and blessings and the acquisition of books became a primary concern for scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Singleton|first1=Brent D.|title=African Bibliophiles: Books and Libraries in Medieval Timbuktu|journal=Libraries &amp; Culture|date=2004|volume=39|issue=1|pages=1–12|jstor=25549150|doi=10.1353/lac.2004.0019}}&lt;/ref&gt; An active trade in books between Timbuktu and other parts of the [[Muslim history|Islamic world]] and emperor [[Askia Mohammed]]'s strong support led to the writing of thousands of [[manuscript]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=African Cultural Astronomy |last=Medupe |first=Rodney Thebe |last2=Warner |first2=Brian |last3=Jeppie |first3=Shamil |last4=Sanogo |first4=Salikou |last5=Maiga |first5=Mohammed |last6=Maiga |first6=Ahmed |last7=Dembele |first7=Mamadou |last8=Diakite |first8=Drissa |last9=Tembely |first9=Laya |year=2008 |isbn=9781402066399 |editor-last=Holbrook |editor-first=Jarita |series=Astrophysics and Space Science Proceedings |at=p. 179 |chapter=The Timbuktu Astronomy Project |doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-6639-9_13 |editor-last2=Medupe |editor-first2=R.

Knowledge was gathered in a manner similar to the early, informal [[Medieval university|European Medieval university]] model.{{sfn|Cleaveland|2008}} Lecturing was presented through a range of informal institutions called [[madrasahs]].&lt;ref name="Makdisi Scholasticism"&gt;{{citation |last=Makdisi |first=George |title=Scholasticism and Humanism in Classical Islam and the Christian West |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=109 |issue=2 |date=April–June 1989 |pages=175–182 [176] |doi=10.2307/604423 |jstor=604423 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays known as the [[University of Timbuktu]], three ''madrasahs'' facilitated 25,000 students: [[Djinguereber Mosque|Djinguereber]], [[Sidi Yahya Mosque|Sidi Yahya]] and [[Sankore Madrasah|Sankore]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timbuktufoundation.org/university.html University of Timbuktu, Mali] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924080621/http://www.timbuktufoundation.org/university.html |date=24 September 2012 }} – Timbuktu Educational Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

These institutions were explicitly religious, as opposed to the more secular curricula of modern European universities and more similar to the medieval Europe model. However, where universities in the European sense started as associations of students and teachers, West-African education was [[patronage|patronized]] by families or lineages, with the Aqit and Bunu al-Qadi al-Hajj families being two of the most prominent in Timbuktu – these families also facilitated students is set-aside rooms in their housings.{{sfn|Hunwick|2003|pp=lvii}}  Although the basis of [[Sharia|Islamic law]] and its teaching were brought to Timbuktu from North Africa with the spread of Islam, Western African scholarship developed: [[Ahmad Baba al Massufi]] is regarded as the city's greatest scholar.&lt;ref name="baba_the_greatest"&gt;{{cite news |first=Lydia |last=Polgreen |title=Timbuktu Hopes Ancient Texts Spark a Revival |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/07/world/africa/07mali.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=7 August 2007 |accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timbuktu served in this process as a distribution centre of scholars and scholarship. Its reliance on trade meant intensive movement of scholars between the city and its extensive network of trade partners. In 1468–1469 though, many scholars left for Walata when [[Sunni Ali]]'s Songhay Empire absorbed Timbuktu and again in 1591 with the Moroccan occupation.{{sfn|Cleaveland|2008}}

This system of education survived until the late 19th century, while the 18th century saw the institution of itinerant Quranic school as a form of universal education, where scholars would travel throughout the region with their students, begging for food part of the day.&lt;ref name=Huddleston/&gt;
Islamic education came under pressure after the French occupation, droughts in the 70s and 80s and by [[Tuareg Rebellion (1990–1995)|Mali's civil war]] in the early 90s.&lt;ref name=Huddleston/&gt;

===Manuscripts and libraries===
{{Main|Timbuktu Manuscripts}}

Hundreds of thousands of manuscripts were collected in Timbuktu over the course of centuries: some were written in the town itself, others – including exclusive copies of the [[Qur'an]] for wealthy families – imported through the lively booktrade.

Hidden in cellars or buried, hid between the mosque's mud walls and safeguarded by their patrons, many of these manuscripts survived the city's decline. They now form the collection of several libraries in Timbuktu, holding up to 700,000 manuscripts:&lt;ref name=ng&gt;{{cite web |last=Rainier |first=Chris |title=Reclaiming the Ancient Manuscripts of Timbuktu |work=National Geographic News |date=27 May 2003 |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/05/0522_030527_timbuktu.html |accessdate=13 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In late January 2013 it was reported that rebel forces destroyed many of the manuscripts before leaving the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Harding |first=Luke |date=28 January 2013 |title=Timbuktu mayor: Mali rebels torched library of historic manuscripts |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/28/mali-timbuktu-library-ancient-manuscripts |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=27 February 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Diarra |first=Adama |date=28 January 2013 |title=French, Malians retake Timbuktu, rebels torch library |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/01/28/uk-mali-rebels-idUKBRE90P0A120130128 |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was no malicious destruction of any library or collection as most of the manuscripts were safely hidden away.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Timbuktu update | date= 30 January 2013| url=http://www.tombouctoumanuscripts.org/blog/entry/timbuktu_update/| publisher=Tombouctou Manuscripts Project, University of Cape Town | accessdate=27 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Zanganeh |first=Lila Azam |date=29 January 2013 |title=Has the great library of Timbuktu been lost? |url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2013/01/the-libraries-of-timbuktu.html |publisher=The New Yorker |accessdate=27 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ citation | title=Precious history in Timbuktu library saved from fire | url=http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/23148 | publisher=The History Blog | accessdate=27 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Hinshaw |first=Drew |date=1 February 2013 |title=Historic Timbuktu Texts Saved From Burning |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323926104578276003922396218 |publisher=''The Wall Street Journal'' |accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One librarian in particular, Abdel Kader Haidara, organized to have 350,000 medieval manuscripts smuggled out of Timbuktu for safekeeping.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/2016/04/23/475420855/timbuktus-badass-librarians-checking-out-books-under-al-qaidas-nose&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, J.

These libraries are the largest among up to 60 private or public libraries that are estimated to exist in Timbuktu today, although some comprise little more than a row of books on a shelf or a bookchest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Grant |first=Simon |title=Beyond the Saharan Fringe |work=The Guardian |date=8 February 2007 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2007/feb/08/beyondthesaharanfringe |accessdate=19 July 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under these circumstances, the manuscripts are vulnerable to damage and theft, as well as long term climate damage, despite Timbuktu's arid climate. Two [[Timbuktu Manuscripts Project]]s funded by independent universities have aimed to preserve them.

During the occupation by Islamic extremists the citizens of the city embarked on a drive to save the “best written accounts of African History.”  Interviewed by the Times the local residents claimed  to have safeguarded the three hundred thousand manuscripts for generations. Many of these documents are still in the safe keeping of the local residents who are reluctant to give them overs to the government-run Ahmed Baba Institute housed  in a modern digitalization building built by the South African government in 2009. The institute houses only 10% of the manuscripts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://world.time.com/2013/02/04/timbuktus-ancient-libraries-saved-by-locals-endangered-by-a-government/|title=Timbuktu’s Ancient Libraries: Saved by Locals, Endangered by a Government|last=Walt|first=Vivienne|work=Time|access-date=2018-04-23|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was later confirmed by Jean-Michel Djian to the New Yorker that "the great majority of the manuscripts, about fifty thousand, are actually housed in the thirty-two family libraries of the 'City of 333 Saints{{'"}}. He added, "Those are to this day protected." He also added that due to the massive efforts of one individual two hundred thousand other manuscripts were successfully transported to safety&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/has-the-great-library-of-timbuktu-been-lost|title=Has the Great Library of Timbuktu Been Lost?|last=Zanganeh|first=Lila Azam|date=2013-01-29|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-04-23|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
Although French is Mali's [[official language]], today the large majority of Timbuktu's inhabitants speaks [[Koyra Chiini language|Koyra Chiini]], a [[Songhay language]] that also functions as the [[lingua franca]]. Before the 1990–1994 [[Tuareg Rebellion (1990-1995)|Tuareg rebellion]], both [[Hassaniya]] Arabic and [[Tuareg languages|Tamashek]] were represented by 10% each to an 80% dominance of the Koyra Chiini language. With Tamashek spoken by both [[Ikelan]] and ethnic Tuaregs, its use declined with the expulsion of many Tuaregs following the rebellion, increasing the dominance of Koyra Chiini.{{sfn|Heath|1999|pp=4–5}}

[[Arabic language|Arabic]], introduced together with Islam during the 11th century, has mainly been the language of scholars and religion, comparable to [[Latin]] in [[Western Christianity]].&lt;ref name=timeslibraries&gt;{{Cite news |last=Forma |first=Aminatta |title=The Lost Libraries of Timbuktu |newspaper=The Sunday Times |location=London, UK |date=7 February 2009 |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article5675598.ece |accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Bambara language|Bambara]] is spoken by the most numerous ethnic group in Mali, the [[Bambara people]], it is mainly confined to the south of the country. With an improving infrastructure granting Timbuktu access to larger cities in Mali's South, use of Bambara was increasing in the city at least until Azawad independence.{{sfn|Heath|1999|pp=4–5}}

==Infrastructure==
With no railroads in Mali except for the [[Dakar-Niger Railway]] up to [[Koulikoro]], access to Timbuktu is by road, boat or, since 1961, aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Rosberg |first=Carl Gustav |title=Political Parties and National Integration in Tropical Africa |publisher=University of California Press |year=1964 |location=Berkeley, CA |page=222 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JpNYxFmTjC4C&amp;pg=PA222 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With high water levels in the Niger from August to December, Compagnie Malienne de Navigation (COMANAV) passenger ferries operate a leg between Koulikoro and downstream [[Gao]] on a roughly weekly basis. Also requiring high water are ''pinasses'' (large motorized [[pirogues]]), either [[charter]]ed or public, that travel up and down the river.&lt;ref name=lpafrica&gt;{{Cite book |last=Pitcher |first=Gemma |title=Africa |publisher=Lonely Planet Guides |year=2007 |location=Melbourne |pages=403–418 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pES7tpurfx0C&amp;dq=timbuktu+lonely+planet&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both ferries and ''pinasses'' arrive at Korioumé, Timbuktu's port, which is linked to the city centre by an {{convert|18|km|mi|abbr=on}} paved road running through Kabara. In 2007, access to Timbuktu's traditional port, Kabara, was restored by a [[Libya]]n funded project that dredged the {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=on}} silted canal connecting Kabara to an arm of the Niger River. COMANAV ferries and ''pinassses'' are now able to reach the port when the river is in full flood.&lt;ref name="retour"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{citation | title= Lancement des travaux du Canal de Tombouctou : la mamelle nourricière redonne vie et espoir à la 'Cité mystérieuse' |date=14 August 2006 | url=http://www.afribone.com/spip.php?article4208 | publisher=Afribone }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timbuktu is poorly connected to the Malian road network with only dirt roads to the neighbouring towns. Although the Niger River can be crossed by ferry at Korioumé, the roads south of the river are no better. However, a new paved road is under construction between [[Niono]] and Timbuktu running to the north of the [[Inland Niger Delta]]. The {{convert|565|km|0|abbr=on}} road will pass through [[Nampala]], [[Léré, Tombouctou Region|Léré]], [[Niafunké]], [[Tonka, Tombouctou Region|Tonka]], [[Diré]] and [[Goundam]].&lt;ref name=essor2010&gt;{{citation |last=Coulibaly |first=Baye |title=Route Tombouctou-Goma Coura: un nouveau chantier titanesque est ouvert |publisher=L'Essor |url=http://www.essor.ml/actualite/article/kidal |date=24 November 2010 |accessdate=19 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=essor2012&gt;{{citation |last=Coulibaly |first=Baye |title=Route Tombouctou-Goma Coura: le chantier advance à grand pas |publisher=L'Essor |url=http://www.essor.ml/regions/article/route-tombouctou-goma-coura-le |date=19 January 2012 |accessdate=1 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The completed {{convert|81|km|0|abbr=on}} section between Niono and the small village of Goma Coura was financed by the [[Millennium Challenge Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Niono-Goma Coura Road Inauguration | publisher=Embassy of the United States, Mali | url=http://mali.usembassy.gov/amb-speech-road-inaug.html | accessdate=19 March 2011 | date=7 February 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514053419/http://mali.usembassy.gov/amb-speech-road-inaug.html | archivedate=14 May 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This new section will service the Alatona irrigation system development of the [[Office du Niger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Mali Compact |publisher=Millennium Challenge Corporation |url=http://www.mcc.gov/documents/cn/cn-111706-mali-compactsigning.pdf |date=17 November 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325161914/http://www.mcc.gov/documents/cn/cn-111706-mali-compactsigning.pdf |archivedate=25 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|484|km|0|abbr=on}} section between Goma Coura and Timbuktu is being financed by the [[European Development Fund]].&lt;ref name=essor2010/&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the imagination of Europeans and North Americans, Timbuktu is a place that bears with it a sense of mystery: a 2006 survey of 150 young [[British people|Britons]] found 34% did not believe the town existed, while the other 66% considered it "a mythical place".&lt;ref name=BBC_twin&gt;{{citation | title = Search on for Timbuktu's twin | publisher =BBC News | date = 18 October 2006 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6062360.stm | accessdate =22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sense has been acknowledged in literature describing African history and African-European relations. Timbuktu is also often considered a far away place, in popular western culture.&lt;ref name="Pelizzo"/&gt;{{sfn|Saad|1983}}&lt;ref name=Prescott&gt;{{Cite book |last=Barrows |first=David Prescott |title=Berbers and Blacks: Impressions of Morocco, Timbuktu and the Western Sudan |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |location=Whitefish, Montana |year=1927 |page=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of this mystification lies in the excitement brought to Europe by the legendary tales, especially those by [[Leo Africanus]]: Arabic sources focused mainly on more affluent cities in the Timbuktu region, such as [[Gao]] and [[Walata]].{{sfn|Insoll|2004}} In West Africa the city holds an image that has been compared to Europe's view on [[Athens]].{{sfn|Saad|1983}} As such, the picture of the city as the [[epitome]] of distance and mystery is a European one.&lt;ref name="Pelizzo"/&gt;

Down-to-earth-aspects in Africanus' descriptions were largely ignored and stories of great riches served as a [[Catalysis|catalyst]] for travellers to visit the inaccessible city – with prominent French explorer [[René Caillié]] characterising Timbuktu as "a mass of ill-looking [[Adobe|houses built of earth]]".{{sfn|Caillié|1830| p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=u7xjAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA49 49 Vol. 2]}} Now opened up, many travellers acknowledged the unfitting description of an "African [[El Dorado]]".&lt;ref name=benjaminsen&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Benjaminsen |first=Tor A |last2=Berge |first2=Gunnvor  |title=Myths of Timbuktu: From African El Dorado to Desertification |journal=International Journal of Political Economy |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=31–59 |publisher=M.E.

In "Scales of Gold" (1991), the fourth book in [[Dorothy Dunnett|Dorothy Dunnett’s]] House of Niccolo series, key characters go to Africa in 1464-1467 searching for gold. They find in Timbuktu intellectual and spiritual wealth that transforms them.

In the original 1932 recording of the popular seaside song "[[The Sun Has Got His Hat On]]", the second verse contains the lines: "[The Sun's] been tanning niggers out in Timbuktu / Now he's coming back to do the same to you!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BBC Radio Devon DJ David Lowe loses job over racist word|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-27360884|work=[[BBC News]] |date=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the controversial nature of the racial epithet "[[nigger]]", controversy has arisen when this song has been played&lt;ref name ="song"&gt;{{cite news |title=ITV feels the heat over N-word song lyrics |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/26/itv-n-word |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2012-06-26 |first=Mark |last=Sweney}}&lt;/ref&gt; and various replacements, including "[[negroes]]"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lbeWBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA289 Jonathan King, ''70 FFFY'', 2014, p.289]&lt;/ref&gt; and "roasting [[peanut]]s"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Dn7WAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT53 Stephen Fry, ''More Fool Me'', 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; have been offered.

===1920-1929===
*1921: 
**Amateur radio broadcasters commenced transition. The first radio licence in Australia was granted to Charles Maclurcan for station [[2CM - an Australian pioneer broadcaster|2CM]], which broadcast from the Wentworth Hotel in Sydney, an establishment owned by the Maclurcan family. Broadcasts consisted of classical music concerts on air on Sunday nights. 
*1922:
** December, "The Regulations: radio laws for the amateur" was issued by the Australian Government. This resulted in Australia's first broadcast licence (2CM in Sydney) being issued to Charles MacLurcan in December 1922. ref "Australian Radio History".
*1923: 
**Following intensive lobbying for the introduction of radio broadcasting, the Government, in May 1923, calls a conference of the main players in the radio manufacturing industry. This led to the [[sealed set]] regulations where stations could be licensed to broadcast and then sell sets to "listeners-in". The receiving device would be set to receive only that station.&lt;ref name = "Langdon"/&gt;
**[[702 ABC Sydney|2SB]] (from 1924, 2BL) in [[Sydney]] is the second official station to be licensed. It commenced service on 23 November 1923. Sydney's first official station, [[Radio National|2FC]] with Licence No.1 commenced service on 9 January 1924.&lt;ref&gt;''Australian Radio History'', Bruce Carty, Sydney, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
*1924:
**3AR and 3LO went to air on 26 January and 13 October 1924 in [[Melbourne]].&lt;ref name = "Langdon"/&gt;
**The Government introduces a two-tiered licence system in July 1924. In the first half of 1924, only 1400 people took out sealed set licences. It was quite easy for listeners to avoid the licence fee by building their own sets or modifying one they had bought to receive more than one station. The radio industry successfully lobbied the Government to introduce a two-tiered system, the "A" licenses to be financed by listeners' licence fees imposed and collected by the Government, and "B" class licenses to be offered to anyone else who wanted to have a go. The B stations would have to generate their own revenue through advertising. A class stations could also advertise but few did. This system was an amalgam of the British system where the non-commercial BBC had a government-imposed monopoly and the USA where the free market was the driving force. The "A" class stations were the original sealed set stations plus one in each other capital city - 2BL, 2FC, 3AR, 3LO, 7ZL, 5CL, 6WF. By years end, 40,000 licences have been issued.&lt;ref name = "Langdon"/&gt; At this time, there was also talk of the introduction "C" class stations which would exclusively advertise the products of the station owners(s). This concept was abandoned in 1931, but the [[Postmaster-General's Department]] was already in talks with the Akron Broadcasting Co. Pty. Ltd in Melbourne, and, so, in lieu of a "C" class license Akron was given a 'B" Class license with some severe restricting conditions (see [[3AK]]).
**The first "B" class station on air was 2BE in November 1924.&lt;ref name = "Langdon"/&gt;
**[[South Australia]]’s first radio station 5CL (A class) went to air on 20 November.&lt;ref name = "Langdon"/&gt;
*1925:
**The oldest surviving "B" class (commercial) station is [[2UE]], which went on air on [[Australia Day]] 1925 as [[2UE|2EU]].&lt;ref name = "Langdon"/&gt;  The reputed reason for the change of callsign is that EU sounded like "''Hey, You''".
**[[3UZ]] Melbourne begins broadcasting
**South Australia’s first commercial radio station [[5DN]] goes to air 24 February.&lt;ref name = "Langdon"/&gt;
**Number of licences issued reaches 80,000.&lt;ref name = "Langdon"/&gt;
*1926: The British Government nationalises radio by buying out the [[British Broadcasting Company]] and forming the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]]. The Australian Government held a [[Royal Commission]] into Wireless but didn't immediately follow the British lead. It did encourage the "A" class stations to amalgamate in order to maximise efficiencies and maintain standards.&lt;ref name = "Langdon"/&gt;
*1927:
**AWA conducts a series of transmissions to Britain. These regular broadcasts were heralded by a [[kookaburra]]'s laugh - a practice that's still used by Radio Australia today, nicknamed "Jacko".&lt;ref name = "Langdon"/&gt;

*1929:
**2BE closes due to financial collapse.&lt;ref name = "Langdon"/&gt;

===1930-1939===

*1932:
**The [[Australian Broadcasting Company]] is nationalised by the ''Australian Broadcasting Commission Act (1932).'' This finalised the two-tier system with the national broadcaster, the newly created [[Australian Broadcasting Commission]], having 12 stations, and the commercial sector, with 43 stations. The ABC was funded by listeners’ licence fees until the 1970s, when Federal Government appropriation became the primary source of funding. Initial plans to permit advertising on the ABC were dropped from the final bill presented to the parliament.&lt;ref name = "Langdon"/&gt;
**On 29 June 1932, [[2WG]] in [[Wagga Wagga, New South Wales]] goes on the air on a purpose built 2000 watt transmitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''W &amp; J Galloway and Sons''' was a British manufacturer of [[steam engine]]s and [[boiler]]s based in [[Manchester]], England. The firm was established in 1835 as a partnership of two brothers, William and John Galloway. The partnership expanded to encompass their sons and in 1889 it was restructured as a limited liability company. It ceased trading in 1932.

The Galloway brothers had been apprenticed to another partnership involving their father, a maker of waterwheels and gearing for mills, before setting up in business on their own account. Their firm grew to be a specialist producer of steam engines and industrial boilers with a worldwide customer base and a reputation for ingenuity. Their products were used in such diverse areas as electricity generation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Motive power and gearing for electrical machinery: a treatise on the theory and practice of the mechanical equipment of power stations for electric supply and for electric traction |pages=323, 560 |author=Carter, Edward Tremlett |year=1896 |publisher=D.

==History==

===Galloway, Bowman and Glasgow===
William Galloway was born on 5 March 1768 at [[Coldstream]] in the [[Border country|Scottish Borders]], became a [[millwright]] and moved to Manchester in 1790.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;[[#ODNB|ODNB]]&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of many [[Scottish people|Scots]] who moved to England seeking to gain from the rapid expansion of industry there; others included [[William Murdoch]] and [[James Watt]], who settled in [[Birmingham]], and fellow settlers in the Manchester area, [[John Kennedy (manufacturer)|John Kennedy]], James McConnel and the cotton-spinning brothers, Adam and George Murray.&lt;ref name="Chalonerp99"&gt;[[#Chaloner|Chaloner]] p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Origins of Engineering in Lancashire |first1=A. E. |last1=Musson |first2=E. |last2= Robinson |journal=The Journal of Economic History |volume=20 |issue=2 |date=June 1960 |page=223 |jstor=2114855 |publisher=Cambridge University Press on behalf of the ''Economic History Association''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He set up business at his home address, 37 Lombard Street.&lt;ref name="Chalonerp100"&gt;[[#Chaloner|Chaloner]] p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1806&lt;ref name="Eng18940216"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Engineer |title=John Galloway |date=16 February 1894}}&lt;/ref&gt; he formed a business partnership with a friend and fellow ex-resident of Coldstream, James Bowman: Galloway wrote to him offering a joint business venture in return for a £200 injection of [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. Bowman moved from London, where he had gone to seek his fortune, and took up residence at Trumpet Street, Manchester.&lt;ref name="Chalonerp100"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chaloner118"/&gt; It would appear that the partnership with Bowman coincided with a move to premises at the Caledonia Foundry at 44, Great Bridgewater Street, on the corner of Albion Street in the Gaythorn district.&lt;ref name="Eng18940216"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adam-matthew-publications.co.uk/digital_guides/ind-rev-series-1-part-14/documents/Reel263.pdf |title=The Boulton &amp; Watt Archive and the Matthew Boulton Papers from Birmingham Central Library |publisher=Adam Matthew Publications |format=PDF |page=5 |date=12 October 1833 |accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time the business traded as millwrights but by 1813 "engineers" had been added to the description, and by 1817 there was the addition of "ironfounders".&lt;ref name="Chalonerp100"/&gt; The term "engineer" in relation to mechanical work was a relatively new one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Origins of Engineering in Lancashire |first1=A. E. |last1=Musson |first2=E. |last2= Robinson |journal=The Journal of Economic History |volume=20 |issue=2 |date=June 1960 |page=215 |jstor=2114855 |publisher=Cambridge University Press on behalf of the ''Economic History Association''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1820, William Glasgow, a [[foundryman]] from the [[River Tweed|Tweed]] who had been working in [[Bolton]] for [[Benjamin Hick|Rothwell and Hick]], joined Galloway and Bowman as a junior partner. His role was to supervise the new ironfounding section of the business. The works were extended by the purchase of additional land.&lt;ref name="Chalonerp100"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MAE1896"&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |coauthors= |year=1896 |title=Obituary |journal=Transactions of the Manchester Association of Engineers |volume= |series= |issue= |pages=318–320 |url=https://archive.org/details/transactionsman07engigoog |accessdate=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The partnership manufactured [[water wheel]]s, their associated [[gear]]ing, and other machinery associated with all forms of milling. As early as 1820 the men had completed some projects for customers in France (at [[Lille]]) and the United States ([[Charleston, South Carolina]]).&lt;ref name="Chaloner101"/&gt;

His son, John, wrote later that {{quote|It was rather remarkable that nearly all the original millwrights in Manchester came from the neighbourhood of the Tweed&amp;nbsp;... All were Scotchmen&amp;nbsp;– quiet, respectable and mostly middle aged, with experience, for in those days a man was not put to mind one machine year after year. He had to understand pretty nearly the whole process, from taking particulars and making [[Pattern (casting)|patterns]], to fixing machinery in the mill.&lt;ref name="Chalonerp100"/&gt;}}

At some time before 1828 Galloway and Bowman formed a partnership as machine makers. This was separate and in addition to their partnership with Glasgow, which continued to trade as millwrights, founders and engineers.&lt;ref name="Chaloner101"/&gt; It has been speculated that Bowman married a sister of Galloway.&lt;ref name="Chaloner118"&gt;[[#Chaloner|Chaloner]] p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

The firm of Galloway, Bowman and Glasgow became the repair facility for the fledgling [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] which had no workshops of its own.&lt;ref name="MAE1906p3"&gt;[[#MAE1906|Rendell]] p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1830–31 the partnership constructed its first steam locomotive, the ''Manchester'' and by the following year had produced the ''[[Caledonian (locomotive)|Caledonian]]''. They had wooden wheels on to which were shrunk welded metal tyres. The wheels were built by John Ashbury, who was later to become a notable engineer in his own right and the owner of the [[Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Company Ltd|eponymous railway wagon works]] at [[Openshaw]].&lt;ref name="Eng18940216"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chaloner107"&gt;[[#Chaloner|Chaloner]] p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither locomotive was initially a success, although the design problems were resolved. In the case of ''Caledonian'' the vertical [[Cylinder (locomotive)|cylinders]] were placed between the frames in front of the [[smokebox]] and drove vertically mounted [[connecting rods]] attached to the leading wheels, which were also in front of the smokebox. It had a tendency to derail and had to be rebuilt with inside cylinders and a cranked axle.&lt;ref name="sekon"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sekon |first1=GA |pages=54–55 |title=The Evolution of the steam locomotive, 1803–1898 | publisher=The Railway Publishing Co Ltd |location=London |year=1899 |url=https://archive.org/stream/evolutionsteaml00nokegoog |accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vertical cylinders were the norm at this time (other builders used them too), the theory being that a horizontal or inclined arrangement would lead to premature wear due to the weight of the [[piston]].&lt;ref name="MAE1906p12"&gt;[[#MAE1906|Rendell]] p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  Four or five locomotives were built at a price fixed by the railway company of between £900 and £1000 each. John Galloway junior commented late in life that: {{quote|"...&amp;nbsp;the trade did not seem likely to be remunerative, and we certainly did not foresee the immense possibilities of the railroad. It was generally considered that about 20 engines would be all that would be required, and competition was keenly felt at the beginning."&lt;ref name="Chaloner109"&gt;[[#Chaloner|Chaloner]] p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The success to come with [[stationary steam engine]]s was in no small part based on the experiences with the short-lived railway locomotive production: the locomotives had boilers rated for {{convert|50|psi|bar|lk=on}}, compared to the normal stationary engine boiler rating at that time of {{convert|5|or|10|psi|bar|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="MAE1906p4"&gt;[[#MAE1906|Rendell]] p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; To put this into context, however, John Galloway senior is reported to have said that the challenges of building a locomotive were nothing compared to those of getting it out of the works and onto the railway afterwards.&lt;ref name="MAE1906p48"&gt;[[#MAE1906|Rendell]] p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; He elaborated that {{quote|When we had constructed the engine&amp;nbsp;... we were met with the serious difficulty of getting it down to the station. We could not put steam on, nor was there a wagon which would take it; so we had to 'bar' it down to Ordsal-lane, which took a gang of men with crowbars from six o'clock in the evening until nine o'clock the next morning.&lt;ref name="Eng18940216"/&gt;}}

By this time the partnership were producing a wide range of engineered items, including: wagons and associated parts for collieries and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway; machinery for silk mills and for salt works; steam engines for cotton mills; pipes for [[James Prescott Joule|Benjamin Joule]]'s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Memoirs and Proceedings of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society |location=Manchester |volume=6 |series=4th |title=Memoir of James Prescott Joule |publisher=Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society |year=1892 |pages=25–26 |author=Reynolds, Osbourne |url=https://archive.org/details/memoirsandproce15socigoog |accessdate=2011-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Salford Brewery in New Bailey Street, Salford; and also a [[lead]] [[Rolling (metalworking)#History|rolling mill]].&lt;ref name="Chaloner108"&gt;[[#Chaloner|Chaloner]] p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

William Galloway junior was born in 1796&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; and on 14 February 1804 his brother, John, was born at his father's Lombard Street address.&lt;ref name="Chaloner101"&gt;[[#Chaloner|Chaloner]] p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; The brothers were both apprenticed for seven years to their father from the age of 14, William as an ironfounder and John as a millwright and engineer. Bowman's son, William, was similarly apprenticed as a millwright from 1821.&lt;ref name="Chaloner103"&gt;[[#Chaloner|Chaloner]] p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the last year of his apprenticeship, 1824, John Galloway went to [[Dunkirk]] to install engines, boilers and pumps for the French government.&lt;ref name="Eng18940216"/&gt;

William Galloway senior died on 7 September 1836 and some time between April and December 1838 James Bowman also died. Glasgow had given Bowman six months' notice of his wish to terminate the partnership on 11 April 1838.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=19712 |page=474 |date=1 March 1839 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1839 the Galloway brothers bought some of the stock of the erstwhile partnership which was being disposed of by auction.&lt;ref name="Chaloner109" /&gt; The Caledonia foundry building was subsumed by [[Manchester Central railway station|Central Station]] by the 1890s.&lt;ref name="Chalonerp100"/&gt;

It is possible that William Glasgow was still conducting business as an ironfounder in 1841 from an address at Gloucester Street.&lt;ref name="Chaloner109"/&gt;

===W &amp; J Galloway===
[[File:Johngalloway.png|right|thumb|John Galloway, 1804–1894]]
The Galloway brothers worked for their father's partnership until in 1835, not long before its demise they set up business together as W. and J. Galloway. They had been considering such a move since at least 1830, with John saying many years later that "there were too many in partnership already, and conflicting interests began to present themselves".&lt;ref name="Chaloner104"&gt;[[#Chaloner|Chaloner]] p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--need to find pp 107–108 of Chaloner as might explain further --&gt;

The brothers built a foundry at [[Knott Mill]], near Chester Road in [[Hulme]] on the site of former premises which had served a similar purpose but had fallen into disuse subsequent to the death of its owner, [[Alexander Brodie (engineer)|Alexander Brodie]], in 1811. The site was near to William's address as known in 1832, which was 26 Jackson's Lane, Hulme. (The lane was subsequently renamed Great Jackson Street).&lt;ref name="Chaloner108" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chaloner119"&gt;[[#Chaloner|Chaloner]] p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; A key advantage of the site was the adjacent [[River Medlock]], sources of water being vital for iron founding and the operation of steam engines, and it was the erosion caused by this watercourse which required the works to be built on two levels.&lt;ref&gt;Archives of Museum of Science and Industry, Manchester&lt;/ref&gt; It has been noted that the Medlock had a greater concentration of steam engines along its length than any other similar river in England and the quality of the water was so poor, due to industrial pollution, that there were immense difficulties with [[Priming (steam engine)|priming]] in steam engine boilers.&lt;ref name="Hills129"&gt;[[#Hills|Hills]] p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1840 the firm had manufactured at least two steam engines, the first for Hayward of [[Yeovil]], Somerset and the second for a mill in [[Glossop]], Derbyshire. In that year they were successful in gaining much work in the manufacture of gas pipes and equipment for gasworks, a new and burgeoning industry. From 1842 until June 1847 the brothers were in partnership, as Galloways &amp; Company, with Joseph Haley, in Manchester and [[Paris]], as "Manufacturers of Patent Screw or Lifting Jacks, and as Patentees of Machines for cutting, punching and compressing Metals, and of the Rivets and other articles constructed by the said last-mentioned Machines&amp;nbsp;... [and] as Cotton Banding Manufacturers". In that month the partnership was dissolved and the Galloways continued to manufacture the machines and rivets in Manchester and Haley continued with the rivets in Paris. By 1856 they had six of these machines in their factory and  manufactured two tons of rivets per machine per day, the devices being operated by one man and 20 boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=20745 |page=2236 |date=18 June 1847 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chaloner110"&gt;[[#Chaloner|Chaloner]] p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a wooden-bodied Galloway-Haley lifting jack is in [[Railway Museum (Madrid)|Museo del Ferrocarril]] (railway museum) in [[Madrid]]. The patents were Haley's; for example, patent number 8768 of 31 December 1840 for an improved lifting jack and compressor.&lt;ref name="Chaloner119"/&gt;

From 1848 the brothers took out numerous patents related to steam power, with John Galloway taking a particular interest in issues to improve the efficiency of boilers. Before that they had registered at least one design to improve efficiency under the Designs Act of 1843.&lt;ref name="Chaloner111"&gt;[[#Chaloner|Chaloner]] p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant of the early patents was that of 11 March 1851 (England and Wales) and 14 April 1851 (Scotland) for the [[#Galloway boiler|Galloway boiler]], (UK patent 13532/1851, extended in 1865 for a further five years&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=22947 |page=1448 |date=10 March 1865 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). They had built boilers of this type before the patent was granted, since at least 1849, and one was exhibited in 1851 at the [[Great Exhibition]] before being purchased&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Modern Practice of Boiler Engineering |author=Armstrong, Robert |page=53 |publisher=E &amp; F N Spon |location=London |year=1856 |url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433066421706 |accessdate=2011-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the West Ham Gutta Percha Company. The firm built approximately 9,000 of the type by 1891 and licensed the design for manufacture by other parties. So much work was created by this aspect of the business that in 1872 premises were obtained on Hyde Road, near [[Ardwick railway station]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/cu3192405253178 |title=Manchester Old and New |author=Shaw, William Arthur |page=65 |year=1894 |publisher=Cassell |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt; to handle it, leaving the Knott Mill works to concentrate on building engines.&lt;ref name="Chaloner112"&gt;[[#Chaloner|Chaloner]] p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lancashire boiler]], which formed the basis on which the Galloways developed their 1851 design, had been patented by [[Sir William Fairbairn]] and [[John Hetherington &amp; Sons|John Hetherington]] in 1844.&lt;ref name="Chaloner112"/&gt; In 1854 Fairbairn was sent a warning letter by the firm regarding what they believed to be an infringement of their patents. Nine years previously the Galloways had done the same to [[James Lillie]], a former business partner of Fairbairn, with reference to a boiler-related design that they alleged had been registered by them in 1845, although there is no record of any such designs or patents of the type which were registered by the Galloways between 1843 and 1845.&lt;ref name="Chaloner111"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chaloner120"&gt;[[#Chaloner|Chaloner]] p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted that the Galloway boiler was not entirely the work of the brothers as they sought the advice of Robert Armstrong, a consulting engineer, in 1850 and it was he who arranged for the boiler to be exhibited in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Modern Practice of Boiler Engineering |author=Armstrong, Robert |pages=35, 54 |publisher=E &amp; F N Spon |location=London |year=1856 |url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433066421706 |accessdate=2011-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Sekon notes that at least one Galloway patent relating to boilers was originally devised by another person: [[Timothy Hackworth]]'s 1830 design for the boiler of his locomotive ''The Globe'' was later patented by the Galloways for use with stationary steam engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sekon |first1=GA |page=47 |title=The Evolution of the steam locomotive, 1803–1898 | publisher=The Railway Publishing Co Ltd |location=London |year=1899 |url=https://archive.org/stream/evolutionsteaml00nokegoog |accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Working with Bessemer===
From 1855 the firm was working with [[Henry Bessemer]], inventor of the eponymous [[Bessemer process|process]], in steel manufacture; he described William Galloway as "my old friend" when writing in 1905.&lt;ref name="Bessemer287"&gt;[[#Bessemer|Bessemer]] p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; He had been a customer of the firm since 1843 when he had developed a process for refining sugar and employed the Galloways to construct it. Bessemer and Galloways conducted a series of experiments throughout 1855 on land bought for the purpose at the Knott Mill Ironworks. This was while he was trying to prove his method, and Galloways are thought likely to have constructed the equipment that Bessemer used in his later trials at Baxter House in London, after which he announced the process to the world in August 1856 at [[Cheltenham]]. From these events comes the claim, frequently made including by John Galloway, that the first ingots of Bessemer steel were made at the Knott Mill Ironworks. Furthermore, the Galloways were the first to license Bessemer's process, obtaining the rights to operate it in Manchester and for a radius of {{convert|10|miles|km}} around before the process was made public.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bessemer176-177"&gt;[[#Bessemer|Bessemer]] pp. 176–177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lord166"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Development of the Bessemer Process in Lancashire, 1856–1900 |first=W. M. |last=Lord |journal=Transactions of the Newcomen Society |year=1945 |volume=25 |page=166 |doi=10.1179/tns.1945.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chaloner116"/&gt; Within a month of his announcement Bessemer had raised £27,000, granting further licenses to the [[Dowlais Ironworks]] in [[South Wales]], Govan Iron Works (Glasgow), [[Butterley Company|Butterley Iron Company]] (Derbyshire), and a tin-plate company in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bessemer|Bessemer]] pp. 167–168.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Knott Mill works were one of those at which Bessemer set up his experimental "converting vessels" when attempting to prove his process commercially late in 1856. The other test sites were Dowlais, Butterley and Govan. The tests failed to work as intended: it later became clear that this was because the [[pig iron]] used contained [[phosphorus]] whereas that with which he had experimented in London did not. The product was "rotten hot and rotten cold", according to his friend, William Clay&lt;ref name="Ericksonp142"&gt;{{cite book |first=Charlotte |last=Erickson |title=British industrialists: steel and hosiery 1850–1950 |year=1986 |origyear=1959 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=142 |authorlink=Charlotte_Erickson |isbn=0-566-05141-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He refunded the licensees' money and an additional £5,500.&lt;ref name="Bessemer170-172"&gt;[[#Bessemer|Bessemer]] pp. 170–172.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="odnbbess"&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/2287 |year=2004 |last=Tweedale |first=Geoffrey |chapter=Bessemer, Sir Henry }} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a further two years before Bessemer resolved the technical metallurgical problems, at which point the Galloway ironworks were once again his test site. There he trialled the steel he had produced at his London factory, which he granulated and then transported for remelting and conversion into ingots at Sheffield:&lt;ref name="odnbbess"/&gt;{{quote|So identical in all essential qualities was this steel with that usually employed that, during two months' trial of it, the workmen had not the slightest idea or suspicion that they were using steel made by a new process. They were accustomed to use steel of the best quality, costing £60 per ton, and they had no doubt whatever that they were still doing so.&lt;ref name="Bessemer175"&gt;[[#Bessemer|Bessemer]] p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When this success was achieved in 1858 the Galloways gave up their licensed rights, which had not been bought back as had those of the other licensees. They went instead into partnership with Bessemer, Robert Longsdon and William Daniel Allen (long-term business partners, and both of them his brothers-in-law)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Chronology of iron and steel |first1=Stephen Lincoln |last1=Goodale |first2=J.

The partnership agreement was to be operational for 14 years.&lt;ref name="Bessemer176-177"/&gt;&lt;ref name="odnbbess"/&gt; It initially produced steel at £10 to £15 cheaper per ton than had previously been possible, and later for around £45 less.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bessemer|Bessemer]] p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chaloner117"&gt;[[#Chaloner|Chaloner]] p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; The Galloways supplied equipment for its works&amp;nbsp;– including tyre mills for the production of railway wheels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=57 |title=The production of iron and steel |author=Hewitt, Abram S. |year=1868 |publisher=Government Printing Office |location=Washington, US |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bGaHxMAgMMUC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– as well as, later, for other works which licensed the process, such as the [[Weardale Iron Company]] and [[Firth Brown Steels|John Brown]] of Sheffield.&lt;ref name="Chaloner117"/&gt; The venture blossomed, although Bessemer made more money from his licensing deals. He quotes the following profit/(loss) figures for the early years of the factory's trading:

|}

Another involvement was in Bessemer's disastrous attempts to produce a ship with a stabilised passenger area, the ''[[SS Bessemer]]'', for which Galloways supplied the hydraulic equipment. The concept had been that a saloon within the vessel would be supported in such a way as not to pitch, roll or yaw as the ship sailed.&lt;ref name="Bessemer325"&gt;[[#Bessemer|Bessemer]] p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; (The ship's manoeuvrability was poor and, having crashed on its maiden voyage, investors lost confidence and the project was abandoned with the equipment remaining untested.)

The firm manufactured on behalf of Bessemer the converters for the works of the [[Pennsylvania Steel Company]] in the late 1860s.&lt;ref name="Bessemer339"&gt;[[#Bessemer|Bessemer]] p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Hick, Hargreaves &amp; Co|Hick, Hargreaves]] of [[Bolton]], Galloways were the only business allowed to produce equipment for the new process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Development of the Bessemer Process in Lancashire, 1856–1900 |first1=W.

Nor might these have been their only involvement: William Galloway owned land at [[Runcorn]] and there were discussions between him and Bessemer regarding a partnership to erect a [[blast furnace]] for the purpose of manufacturing "rich manganesian pig-iron", which was required at that time to de-oxidise the molten blown metal. However, delays in progressing this idea, due to Bessemer's process gaining widespread use, ultimately resulted in Galloway feeling he was too old to embark on the venture.&lt;ref name="Bessemer285"&gt;[[#Bessemer|Bessemer]] p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Development of the Bessemer Process in Lancashire, 1856–1900 |first1=W.

The partnership of Henry Bessemer &amp; Co. was formally ended on 25 June 1877 "by the effluxion of time", although the Sheffield factory continued production with Allen buying Bessemer's interest in it that year. The dissolution of the partnership involved selling the business, its premises and its equipment. Including the distributions of profits made during its lifespan, each partner had at the date of effective dissolution in 1873 made 81 times the amount of money that they had original subscribed.&lt;ref name="Bessemer176-177"/&gt; William Galloway had died in 1873&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; (his executors being John Galloway junior, John Brown Payne and John Galloway Meller), as had Robert Longsdon, whose executors were also named in the notice of partnership dissolution; Bessemer had retired from day-to-day business in the same year.&lt;ref name="odnbbess"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=24480 |page=4082 |date=10 July 1877 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A person with the last name of Meller, but not John Galloway Meller, had been an executor to the estate of William Galloway senior.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

In 1856 the sons of the firm's founders joined the partnership: John Galloway, the son of William, born on 18 July 1826 at Great Jackson Street, Manchester, and Charles John the son of John, born 25 April 1833. Both had been apprenticed to the firm and its name was adjusted to reflect their involvement.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chaloner117" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MAE1904"&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |coauthors= |year=1904 |title=Chas.

Despite the expansion of the partnership a deed registered in the Court of Bankruptcy in July 1864 only names William and John Galloway, who were to receive a payment of 6s. 8d. in the pound from Thomas Redhead of Belvoir Terrace, Old Chester Road, [[Tranmere, Merseyside|Tranmere]], the proprietor of a steam tug.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=22875 |page=3597 |date=15 July 1864 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A petition for the winding-up of the Globe New Patent Iron and Steel Co, Ltd. in 1875 shows that by that date the partnership comprised John Galloway snr, John Galloway Jnr, Charles John Galloway and Edward Napier Galloway.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=24218 |page=3063 |date=11 June 1875 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward was another son of John senior, who married a Miss Lewis in 1827 and they had four sons and a daughter.&lt;ref name="Eng18940216"/&gt;

During the 1850s and 1860s the firm generated many overseas sales to countries such as Turkey, India and Russia, and for items as diverse as gunpowder mills, boilers, presses, and steam engines for use in a wide variety of applications. The firm supplied cast iron columns for buildings, constructed the [[Southport Pier|pier at Southport]] (and then extended it, for which the tender was £3,000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s21TAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA451 |title=Tenders |journal=The Builder |date=20 June 1863 |page=451 |volume=21 |issue=1063 |accessdate=2011-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, between 1855 and 1857, a {{convert|1535|ft|m}} railway viaduct over the [[River Leven, Cumbria|River Leven]] close to [[Ulverston]]. The pier and the bridge employed a new construction method devised by John Galloway, using pressurised water jets to create the holes into which the piles were later driven.&lt;ref name="Chaloner116"&gt;[[#Chaloner|Chaloner]] pp. 113–116.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Description of the iron viaducts erected across the tidal estuaries of the Rivers Leven and Kent |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C7iwAAAAIAA |last1=Brunlees |first1=James |publisher=Institution of Civil Engineers |location=London |year=1858 |accessdate=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galloways were among the well-known promoters of a new business, The Lancashire Steel Company Ltd., in 1863. The intention was that this company would develop a 10&amp;nbsp;acre site at [[Gorton]] with buildings, blast furnaces and all the necessaries of steel production by the Bessemer process, in order initially to produce 200 tons a week of steel in blocks weighing up to 10 tons. The site was adjacent to the [[Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway]], for ease of transport. It was planned to eventually produce 20 ton blocks and to equip it with the most powerful tooling so that the company could supply the maritime market. Capitalisation was to be £150,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Advertisement |page=63 |journal=The Chemical News |volume=7 |publisher=J H Dutton |location=London |date=1 August 1863| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zgcAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA62-IA1 |accessdate=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the venture was a failure and it was [[Liquidation|wound-up]] in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=23302 |page=5133 |date=17 September 1867 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- any idea why it failed? --&gt;

Around 1873 the firm supplied two [[blowing engine]]s to the huge [[Krupp]] steelworks at [[Essen]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101049916941 |title=Progress of the iron and steel industries: Germany |journal=Van Nostrand's Eclectic Engineering Magazine |date=July–December 1874 |volume=11 |page=173 |publisher=D Van Nostrand |location=New York |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in this decade that the company began to install [[line shaft|flat belt drive systems]] for the transfer of power from its stationary steam engines to the looms and similar machinery which they were intended to service. This technique was common in the US but rare in Britain until this time: the advantages included less noise and less wasted energy in the friction losses inherent in the previously common drive shafts and their associated gearing. Also, maintenance was simpler and cheaper, and it was a more convenient method for the arrangement of power drives such that if one part were to fail then it would not cause loss of power to all sections of a factory or mill. These systems were in turn superseded in popularity by [[rope drive]] methods.{{sfnp|Hills, Power from Steam|pages= 208–210}}

Charles John Galloway had a particular interest in exhibitions. The firm displayed two 40 horsepower Galloway boilers at the 1873 Vienna Universal Exhibition, and a 35 horsepower [[compound engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reports on the Vienna Universal Exhibition of 1873 |publisher=HMSO |author=Royal Commission on the Vienna Universal Exhibition 1873 | pages=203. 204 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5g5AAAAAYAAJ |accessdate=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876 the firm was gazetted for an award for Services to the American Executive in Machinery Department at the Philadelphia International Exhibition,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=24527 |page=6897 |date=30 November 1877 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was awarded the title of Chevalier of the Legion of Honour after the Paris Exhibition of 1878, raised to the rank of Officer after the similarly titled event of 1889. He was very active in the organisation of the Royal Manchester Jubilee Exhibition of 1887.&lt;ref name="MAE1904"/&gt; John Galloway junior was chairman of the organising committee for the latter event.&lt;ref name="MAE1896" /&gt; Some years later, in 1894, Galloways won the ''Grand Prix'' in the ''Motive &amp; Machines'' section of the [[Exposition Internationale d'Anvers (1894)|Antwerp International Exhibition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=26579 |page=7360 |date=14 December 1894 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles John did not limit his activities to that of the family firm and was chairman of Boiler Insurance and Steam Power Co. Ltd. in September 1880, when an extraordinary general meeting held in King Street, Manchester resolved to liquidate the company and sell its business and assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=24888 |page=5166 |date=5 October 1880 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a director of the [[Manchester Ship Canal Company]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://archive.org/stream/transactionsman03engigoog |page=XVII |title=Transactions |year=1904 |publisher=The Manchester Association of Engineers |location=Manchester |accessdate=2011-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had been a director of the Steam Boiler Assurance Co.

===Galloways Ltd.===
The partnership was converted into a private company, Galloways Ltd., in 1889, with a share capital of £250,000 in £100 shares. The initial subscribers, who each took one share, were John Galloway, John Galloway junior, Charles John Galloway, Edward Napier Galloway, Arthur Walter Galloway, John Henry Beckwith, W E Norbury and C Rought&amp;nbsp;– all but the last giving their address as the Knott Mill Ironworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1889 |title=Galloways Ltd |journal=The Chemical Trade Journal |volume=4 |series= |issue= |page=235 |pages= |publisher=Davis |location=Manchester |issn= |pmid= |pmc= |doi= |bibcode= |oclc= |id= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PAkAAAAAMAAJ |language= |accessdate=3 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beckwith, [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers|MIMechE]], had been a frequent co-applicant with Charles John Galloway in applications for patents and provisional protection thereof: he had joined the company in his early 20s in 1864 as a draughtsman and, after a brief interlude working for another business in [[Buenos Aires]], returned in 1867; by 1877 he was chief design engineer and he became managing director with the conversion to limited company status; he resigned as managing director in 1897 but kept his seat on the board of directors until his death one year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://archive.org/details/p3p4proceedin1898inst |title=Memoirs |journal=Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers |pages=701–702 |year=1898 |publisher= |location=Westminster, London |accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Galloway junior had been increasingly involved in the management of the partnership as it grew rapidly but the restructuring of the partnership as a company saw Charles John Galloway installed as chairman and managing director.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; John Galloway junior had numerous other business interests, and was a [[Justice of the peace|JP]] (as was Charles) and had a great interest in philanthropy. His business interests included being chairman of [[Earle's Shipbuilding|Earle's Shipbuilding and Engineering Company]] at Hull, and a director of Carnforth Hematite Iron Co, ''(correct spelling, founded 1865&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Development of the Bessemer Process in Lancashire, 1856–1900 |first1=W.

Five years later, on 11 February 1894, John Galloway senior died aged almost 90. His estate was valued at £143,117&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; and by this time the company had 500 employees at the Knott Mill site and a further 800 at Ardwick.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[[#Chaloner|Chaloner]] p. 112..&lt;/ref&gt; His last home address was Coldstream House, [[Old Trafford (district)|Old Trafford]] and his executors were William Lewis Galloway (a sugar refiner, of The Lawn, Brook Lane, Timperley and sometime councillor of the [[County Borough of Salford]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser |date=31 October 1867 |title=Municipal Elections |page=4 |publisher=[[British Newspaper Archive]] }} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Napier Galloway (Normanby, Altrincham) and John Galloway Meller (a land agent of Cooper Street, Manchester).&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=26497 |page=1751 |date=23 March 1894 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An engineer, Edward Galloway was appointed a Land Tax Commissioner in 1899;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27107 |page=5041 |date=11 August 1899 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he died on 5 October 1919 when living at Hill Rise, Leicester Road, Altrincham.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=31841 |page=3956 |date= 30 March 1920 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The children of John Galloway established a charitable fund in memory of him and his wife, Emma, in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Manchester: The parish and advowson |title=A History of the County of Lancaster |volume=4 |year=1911 |pages=192–204 |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41406 |accessdate=2011-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This survived under the name of the John and Emma Galloway Memorial until October 1991, when it was amalgamated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/RemovedCharityMain.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1004692&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0 |publisher=Charities Commission |title=1004692&amp;nbsp;– John and Emma Galloway Memorial|accessdate=2011-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Galloway junior died on 16 December 1896 at his home, The Cottage, Seymour Grove, Manchester. He left one son, [[William Johnson Galloway]], born in 1868, who was also involved with the family firm and was at the time of his father's death the Conservative MP for Manchester South-west (his father, although keeping a low profile, was of Liberal persuasion and a member of the United Presbyterian Church).&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; Both of these men were interred at Weaste Cemetery, [[City of Salford|Salford]].&lt;ref name="MAE1896" /&gt;

There was a capital restructuring in 1895,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=26638 |page=3674 |date=28 June 1895 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1899 the business became a public limited company.&lt;ref name="Chaloner117" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27089 |page=3747 |date=13 June 1899 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhere between these dates the chairmanship appears to have moved from Charles John Galloway to Edward Napier Galloway, according to the announcements in ''[[The London Gazette]]''. However, ''[[The Engineer (magazine)|The Engineer]]'' reported Charles John as chairman at the company's annual general meeting in 1901 and noted that Sir Richard Mottram was a director.&lt;ref name="Eng19010301"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Engineer |date=1 March 1901 |title=Galloways Limited, Manchester}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mottram was Mayor of Salford between 1894 and 1898; he held other directorships with [[Manchester Liners| Manchester Liners Ltd]] (or perhaps Manchester Linen Ltd)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dod's peerage, baronetage and knightage |publisher=S.

The 1901 meeting authorised a dividend payment of 6% and the issue of 2,746 shares at £10 each in order to aid investment in plant and extended premises for the purpose of manufacturing '[[high-speed steam engine|high-speed engines]]'. This issue of shares amounted to 20% of the then issued capital, and they were taken up by existing shareholders.&lt;ref name="Eng19010301"/&gt; In the same year the company considerably extended its Knott Mill factory, at which time a visitor noted in particular the work in progress on "several exceptionally large engines for iron and steel works" (one had a 45 ton, 24 foot diameter flywheel and a total weight of 230 tons) and also a wood treatment plant for the Northern Wood Haskinising Company (''haskinising'' was a wood preservation technique&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=46530#s5 |title=Cubitt Town |work=British History Online |publisher=University of London &amp; History of Parliament Trust |accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Engineer |date=5 April 1901 |page=359 |title=Notes from Lancashire}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were reports at this time that the company had licensed and was developing [[Raoul Pictet|Pictet]]'s discovery of an improved method for the production of oxygen gas, although there were suggestions that this may have been as part of a syndicate involving other Manchester businesses. The plan was for Pictet to experiment further at the Galloway works and if the outcome was successful then a new company would be formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Age of Steel |volume=90 |issue=13 |date=28 September 1901 |title=A new oxygen process and the metal trade |page=35 |location=St Louis, MO. |publisher=Journal of Commerce Co. |url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015086667113;seq=673;size=175;view=image |accessdate=2011-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1902 annual general meeting confirmed that the expansion was complete, voted a similar dividend and re-elected William Johnson Galloway and Charles Rought as directors; it also noted that an order for a blowing machine from Carnforth Hematite was being processed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Engineer |date=7 March 1902 |title=Galloways Limited, Manchester}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles John Galloway died on 14 March 1904. His address at the time of death was Thorneyholme, [[Knutsford]] and his executors were Arthur Walter Galloway, Henry Bessemer Galloway and William Sharp Galloway, his sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27702 |page=5082 |date=5 August 1904 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was interred at [[Mobberley]] Church.&lt;ref name="MAE1904" /&gt;

The Galloway boiler was still being improved around this time. In 1902 the company introduced a [[superheater]] and in 1910 began to use another design of the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89089673925 |author=Inchley, W. |year=1912 |title=Steam boilers and boiler accessories |publisher=Edward Arnold |location=London |pages=268–270 |accessdate=2011-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was involved in a significant court case in 1912, which went to the highest court of the land and was subsequently cited in other cases, including in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nj.findacase.com/research/wfrmDocViewer.aspx/xq/fac.19410725_0040128.NJ.htm/qx |title=McDonough v.

He resumed work at the company in 1903 as a caulker, which involved using a light hammer, but in 1910 was instructed to use a heavy pneumatic hammer. The vibration from this heavier hammer caused his hand to become inflamed and he sought compensation, based on his injury of 1902. A lower court awarded him this compensation but the judgment was overturned on appeal by the [[Law Lords]], who directed that there was no evidence that the 1902 accident was a contributory cause of his injury of 1910 and that, in any event, the latter incident was not actually an accident at all and therefore there was no entitlement to compensation under the terms of the 1897 Workmen's Compensation Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924061105585 |title=Stone's Insurance Cases |first1=Gilbert |last1=Stone |first2=Keith Grimble |last2=Groves |year=1914 |volume=2 |page=832 |publisher=The Reports and Digest Syndicate |location=London |quote=1 K.

There had been a previous judgement of some legal significance in 1900, being the matter of Statham vs Galloways Ltd. In this instance an employee had obeyed the order of a superior and as a consequence of doing so had suffered injury. The ruling was that the injured employee had stepped outside the Workmen's Compensation Act by doing something which he knew to be outside the scope of his duties but, nonetheless, obedience was also a duty and that obedience took precedence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Workmen's Compensation Acts.

The company was placed in receivership on the application of its debenture holders in 1912, despite the business being "much more promising than for some time past". The cause of this was a proposal to issue prior lien debentures to the value of £50,000, a move which would dilute the position of existing debenture holders. It was reported that the company might be restructured in order to resolve this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Engineer |title=Manchester Boilermakers' Affairs |date=31 May 1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- need to follow through on this episode --&gt;

There was a restructuring of the company on 27 July 1925, a scheme of arrangement being made with shareholders and debenture holders such that the capital was reduced from £330,000 to £198,192.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=33083 |page=5986 |date= 11 September 1925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year saw the company take on the drawings and patterns of [[John Musgrave &amp; Sons]] following the closure of that business.{{sfnp|Hills, Power from Steam|page= 267}}

It has been calculated that the number of engineering firms in Manchester more than halved between 1899 and 1939, with the inter-war recession causing particularly severe contraction in the manufacturing spheres of textile machinery, locomotive engineering and boilermaking. The businesses most likely to survive were those that did not rely extensively on exports, on the production of capital goods and on time-served skilled labour&amp;nbsp;– "the newer, more capital-intensive, mass-production, domestic market-oriented engineering firms, employing a large proportion of semi-skilled labour fared better and dominated the industry by 1939."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=W6g0uNjoXroC |title=Organised capital:employers' associations and industrial relations in northern England 1880–1939 |pages=32–33 |author=McIvor, Arthur J. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-521-89092-2 |accessdate=2011-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Separate paragraph to emphasise the passing of time&amp;nbsp;... --&gt;
The company went into receivership in 1932&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/A2A/records.aspx?cat=422-2001293&amp;cid=-1#-1 |title=Henry Pilling Papers |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1933, [[Hick, Hargreaves &amp; Co]]. purchased the complete records, drawings and patterns  of the defunct W &amp; J Galloway Limited.&lt;ref&gt;P.

==Galloway boiler and Galloway tubes{{Anchor|Galloway tube|Galloway boiler}}==
In 1848, Galloways patented the ''Galloway tube'', a tapered [[thermic syphon]] water-tube inserted in the furnace of a [[Lancashire boiler]].&lt;ref name="MSIM, Lancashire boiler" &gt;{{cite web

  |publisher=[[Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester|Museum of Science &amp; Industry, Manchester]]
  |format=PDF
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tubes are tapered, simply to make their installation through the flue easier.&lt;ref name="Harris, Model Boilers" &gt;{{cite book

{{Anchor|Galloway boiler}}These were followed in 1851 by the ''Galloway boiler''.&lt;ref &gt;UK patent 13532, 1851&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Hills, Power from Steam|page= 134}} The flues beyond the two furnaces of the Lancashire boiler were merged into a single wide flue.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web

  |publisher=Grace's Guide
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This widened and flat-topped flue was [[stay (boiler)|stay]]ed by the use of many conical vertical Galloway tubes being riveted into it, improving the circulation of water and increasing the heating surface.

== Biography ==
Feldman received her B.A. in Hebrew Literature and Language and
English Literature from [[Tel Aviv University]] in 1967 and her M.A. in Medieval
Hebrew Literature from [[Hebrew College]] in 1976. Her Ph.D. dissertation at
[[Columbia University]] was on the Hebrew-American poet [[Gabriel Preil]] who
was to become the subject of her first book, ''Modernism and Cultural Transfer'':
''Gabriel Preil and the Tradition of Jewish Literary Bilingualism'' (1986). Her
MA thesis formed the basis of her second book, in Hebrew, ''Polarity and Parallel'': ''Semantic Patterns in the Medieval Hebrew Qasida'' (1987).&lt;ref name="Weinberger"&gt;Weinberger, Leon J. [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Polarity+and+Parallel%3A+Semantic+Patterns+in+the +Medieval+Hebrew...-a0209800190 "Review: ''Polarity and Parallel'': ''Semantic Patterns in the Medieval Hebrew Qasida''], ''Hebrew Studies Journal'', Vol. 31, January 1990&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving her Ph.D. in 1981, she completed postdoctoral study at the [[Columbia University Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research]]. [[Psychoanalytic theory]] has continued to inform her literary criticism as well as her studies on gender and biblical and [[Zionist]]
narratives, beginning with her third publication, ''Teaching the Hebrew Bible as Literature in Translation'' (1989) and subsequent articles.&lt;ref&gt;"And Rebecca Loved Jacob, But Freud Did Not." ''Jewish Studies Quarterly'' 1:1, 1993, pp. 72-88; rpt. in ''Freud

Her ''No Room of Their Own: Gender and Nation in Israeli Women's Fiction'', published in 1999, was the first book-length treatment devoted to Israeli women writers and written from a feminist perspective.&lt;ref&gt;''Women in Judaism: A Multidisciplinary Journal'', ({{ISSN|1209-9392}}).

Growing out of her abiding interest in the impact of the Bible on contemporary psycho-politics, gender, and violence, it explores the biblical and classical stories of potential and enacted sacrifice ([[Isaac]], [[Jephthah]]’s daughter, [[Iphigenia]], [[Jesus]]) that have nourished myths of altruist heroism over the last century.
