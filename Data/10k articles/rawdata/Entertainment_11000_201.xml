'''''Agents of Mayhem''''' is an [[open world]] [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[video game]] developed by [[Volition (company)|Volition]] and published by [[Deep Silver]]. The game was released in August 2017 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]]. The game's themes are based on [[Saturday-morning cartoon]]s and [[superhero film]]s. It is set in the same fictional universe as Volition's ''[[Saints Row]]'' series, and includes several plot and character crossovers.

== Gameplay ==
''Agents of Mayhem'' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[open world]] game played from a [[third-person (video games)|third-person]] perspective. The game takes place in a futuristic version of [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], billed as "the city of tomorrow".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/06/06/the-saints-row-iverse-is-growing-with-agents-of-mayhem-from-developer-volition/|title=Agents of Mayhem kicks off the Saints Row shared universe|website=VentureBeat|access-date=June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game features twelve agents, and players can choose any three to complete missions and explore the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/06/06/volitions-newest-project-is-agents-of-mayhem/|title=Volition's newest project is 'Agents of Mayhem'|website=Engadget|access-date=June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agents are comprised in four trios: the Bombshells (Italian engineer Joule, Indian immunologist Rama, and German [[Football hooliganism|football hooligan]] Red Card); the Carnage a Trois (American field strategist Braddock, American derby driver Daisy, and Russian "Cold Warrior" [[Saints Row: The Third#Plot|Oleg Kirlov]] under the alias "Yeti"); the Firing Squad (American gang leader [[Saints Row 2#Plot|Pierce Washington]] under the alias "Kingpin", Japanese hitman Oni, and Middle Eastern assassin Scheherazade); and the Franchise Force (Colombian former sky pirate Fortune, [[United States Navy]] chief petty officer Hardtack, and Canadian actor and proclaimed "Face of Mayhem" Hollywood).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aomthegame.com/|title=Home - Agents of Mayhem, official web page|website=aomthegame.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three additional agents are provided via [[downloadable content]]: Seoul police lieutenant Johnny Gat; Moroccan soldier Fatima Daoud, also known as "Lazarus"; and genius hacker Kinzie Kensington, under the alias "Safeword".

Each agent has their own unique play-style and abilities. For instance, Hardtack uses [[shotgun]] as his primary weapon, while Hollywood utilizes his assault rifle. As players deal damage to enemies with their weapons, players accumulate points that will fill up a bar. When the bar is filled, players can utilize the agents' Mayhem abilities, which are superpower moves that greatly aid player in combat. Different agents have different mayhem abilities. For example, Fortune can use her drone, GLORY to stun enemies, while Hollywood can trigger massive explosions around him.&lt;ref name="cobra"/&gt; Players can switch between the three agents they have selected freely,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-agents-of-mayhem-feels-like-saints-row-and-cou/1100-6449147/|title=Why Agents Of Mayhem Feels Like Saints Row, And Could Be A Missed Opportunity|first=Oscar|last=Dayus|work=VideoGamer.com|date=April 4, 2017|accessdate=April 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and experiment with different combinations of agents to see which trio of characters suit their playstyle the most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/agents-of-mayhem-impressions/?|title=Agents of Mayhem first impressions: a disappointing hero shooter in a generic open world|first=Wes|last=Fenlon|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=April 4, 2017|accessdate=April 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Movement in the game is fast.

== Setting ==
''Agents of Mayhem'' is set in a [[shared universe]] alongside Volition's ''[[Saints Row]]'' and ''[[Red Faction]]'' series, taking place after the "recreate Earth" ending of the ''[[Saints Row IV]]'' stand-alone expansion, ''[[Saints Row: Gat out of Hell|Gat out of Hell]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/agents_of_mayhem/b/playstation4/archive/2017/04/03/finding-the-potential-within-agents-of-mayhem.aspx|title=Finding The Potential Within Agents of Mayhem|website=Game Informer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/04/03/saints-row-spin-off-agents-of-mayhem-gets-release-date-and-new-trailer-6550274/|title=Saints Row spin-off Agents Of Mayhem gets release date and new trailer|first=GameCentral for|last=Metro.co.uk|date=April 3, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/new-product/game/agents-of-mayhem-latest-rumours-release-date-pre-order-gameplay-trailers-3641518/|title=Watch the latest trailer for Saints Row spinoff Agents of Mayhem|first=Marie|last=Brewis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's plot revolves around an organization known as M.A.Y.H.E.M. ('''M'''ultinational '''A'''genc'''y''' '''H'''unting '''E'''vil '''M'''asterminds), founded by Persephone Brimstone (a character first seen in ''Gat out of Hell'') and funded by the Ultor Corporation (one of the main antagonists of ''[[Saints Row 2]]'' and the ''[[Red Faction]]'' series, later merging with the Saints in ''[[Saints Row: The Third]]''). Bearing the Saints' purple [[fleur-de-lis]] logo, M.A.Y.H.E.M's goal is to stop supervillain organization L.E.G.I.O.N. (the '''L'''eague of '''E'''vil '''G'''entlemen '''I'''ntent on '''O'''bliterating '''N'''ations) from destroying the world's nations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aomthegame.com/m-a-y-h-e-m/&lt;/ref&gt; The game is set in a near-future version of [[Seoul, South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/03/hands-on-with-agents-of-mayhems-ensemble-action | title = Hands-On With Agents of Mayhem's Ensemble Action | first=  Joe | last = Ryan | date = April 3, 2017 | accessdate = April 3, 2017 | work = [[IGN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==

In the backstory, Persephone Brimstone was once part of the supervillain organization L.E.G.I.ON and part of their plans for world conquest, as well as married to the Minister of Envy. Persephone learned that L.E.G.I.O.N's leader, the Morningstar plotted to harvest the power of Dark Matter to alter reality and ascend into godhood. Persephone put a stop to those plans and took off with an airship called the ARK, and in retaliation, L.E.G.I.O.N. and her husband launched an attack on her home city of Paris. Having turned against L.E.G.I.O.N completely, Persephone used whatever recourses she could get her hands on to form M.A.Y.H.E.M and take revenge on L.E.G.I.O.N. 

L.E.G.I.O.N would later reveal themselves to the public with a world wide attack to topple the world’s governments. This event would later be called "Devil's Night" and would play into the backstories of many of M.A.Y.H.E.M's agents, such as the Franchise Force, consisting of Rod "Hollywood" Stone, a former actor turned self proclaimed "face" of M.A.Y.H.E.M; Marina "Fortune" Santos, a sky pirate who was recruited when Persephone was impressed with her thieving skills; and Ishmael "Hardtrack" Funderburke, a former Navy officer whose ship was destroyed by L.E.G.I.O.N. Other agents include Janel Braddock, a former drill sergeant and girlfriend to Persephone's right hand woman Friday; Piper "Daisy" Andrews, an ill tempered derby girl and Hollywood's on again off again girlfriend; Cosima "Joule" Bellini, a fashion model and brilliant engineer; Masamune "Oni" Senichi, a Yakuza assassin who turned against his crime family when he learnt they were working for L.E.G.I.O.N; Pranati "Rama" Malhotra, an immunologist who seeks to find a cure for a plague L.E.G.I.O.N set loose upon India; Ingo "Red Card" Rotkapp, a crazed soccer fan who incited a riot to fight off a L.E.G.I.O.N attack; and an enigmatic assassin that goes by Scheherazade. This game also features ''[[Saints Row]]'' characters as playable agents, such as Pierce Washington, who has become the kingpin of Stillwater, and united the gangs to fight off a L.E.G.I.O.N attack; and Ji-hoon “Johnny” Gat, who has become a police lieutenant with the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency. The events of Devil's Night put Johnny in a coma. When he woke up, he found that he was the sole survivor of the SMPA, which has been replaced by robot cops.

At the start of the game, Persephone sets up M.A.Y.H.E.M in Seoul, South Korea where they track down Dr. Babylon, the ambitious leader of the Ministry of Pride for L.E.G.I.O.N. who plans on harvesting a giant dark matter crystal from a comet. The Franchise Force is sent to kill him but fail. To distract M.A.Y.H.E.M, Babylon uses his lieutenant Hammersmith to cause destruction around Seoul to distract M.A.Y.H.E.M before Hammersmith is defeated by the agents. Babylon then uses August Gaunt, a young singer and another one of his lieutenants to brainwash his fans and attempt to turn the city of Seoul against M.A.Y.H.E.M, but the agents confront him at his concert and shut down his technology, exposing Gaunt as a fraud. 

M.A.Y.H.E.M then plans to retrieve a sentient computer program called AISHA, a virtual female idol group that L.E.G.I.O.N is using as a virus, but one of Babylon's cybernetic lieutenants by the name of Steeltoe falls in love with AISHA and starts a relationship with her. Steeltoe and AISHA intend to merge their AI's, but Steeltoe is killed by M.A.Y.H.E.M'S agents at their "wedding". A vengeful AISHA, led by their red avatar, begin a smear campaign against M.A.Y.H.E.M, eventually taking to creating a musical single that would kill its listeners, before eventually starting an attack on the ARK'S computer programs. The other AISHA's realize how unstable Red Aisha is, but most of them are killed leaving only the Red and Purple AISHA. The Purple AISHA willingly defects to M.A.Y.H.E.M as their agents destroy the Red AISHA. 

Getting desperate, Babylon sends in Ariadne, the brilliant daughter of a scientist Babylon killed before trying to brainwash her with a microchip. Ariadne overcomes the microchip, but the effort drove her insane and she plots revenge on Babylon. Ariadne launches robot attacks on Seoul, and abducts multiple people, including M.A.Y.H.E.M's technological engineer Katy "Gremlin" Fox. The agents go on to rescue Gremlin, but while they are successful, Ariadne manages to escape before cutting the microchip out of her head. 

Finally, M.A.Y.H.E.M seek to find Bablyon's giant robot called Project Damocles, but when they eventually uncover it, Babylon launces a city wide attack, and even an attack on the ARK before commandeering Damocles and extracting the dark matter crystal. It's then revealed that Ariadne had placed her microchip in Damocles to drive Babylon insane as revenge. This backfires, when Babylon realizes he now has the ultimate power in L.E.G.I.O.N and goes on a bid to usurp the Morningstar and remake reality in his image. Babylon uses Damocles to go on a rampage and the power of the dark matter crystal to begin to rewrite reality where he rules the world. The agents enter the rift to battle Babylon and his recreated minions, and eventually destroy the dark matter crystal. With the crystal destroyed, reality goes back to normal as the Damocles crashes to the Earth. Babylon and the agents survive the crash, but Babylon is taken and presumably killed by L.E.G.I.O.N enforcer Marcus Longinus as punishment for his failure, while Persephone has M.A.Y.H.E.M pull out of Seoul.

== Development ==
Development of the game began shortly after the release of ''[[Saints Row IV]]''. The game began its development cycle as some concept art and character descriptions, and after receiving positive comments from outsiders who have listened to their pitch, one of whom described it as "[[G.I. Joe]] versus Cobra Megafight 2020", the game soon entered full production. Unlike previous ''Saints Row'' games, which have only one player-controlled protagonist, ''Agents of Mayhem'' introduces multiple playable characters. This was done because Volition reflected on some of their previous fan events, where fans opted to [[cosplay]] as the supporting characters rather than the central character. They considered it an evidence to show that fans of the franchise would be interested in a character-focused game. Another reason is that the company, inspired by ''[[League of Legends]]'' and ''[[Dota 2]]'', wanted players to form a strong connection with the characters. Volition also thought that the game, being a single-player title, has a great advantage, since most games with a diverse cast of characters are [[multiplayer]]-focused. The game's tone and style was inspired by 1980s action cartoons such as ''[[G.I. Joe]]'', ''[[He-Man]]'', and television series like ''[[The A-Team]]''.&lt;ref name="cobra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2017/4/3/15154850/agents-of-mayhem-gameplay-preview-video-saints-row-volition-sleeper-hit|title=Agents of Mayhem might be the sleeper hit of 2017|first=Phillip|last=Kollar|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=April 3, 2017|accessdate=April 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, after receiving $200,000 in incentives from the city of [[Champaign, Illinois]], Volition began hiring upwards of 100 employees to begin work on a new project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/15/saints-row-4-developer-eyes-expansion|title=Saints Row 4 Developer Eyes Expansion|last=Moser|first=By Cassidee|website=IGN|access-date=July 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little was known about this game until a trademark for ''Agents of Mayhem'' filed by [[Koch Media]] ([[Deep Silver]]'s parent company) was discovered in May 2016, along with résumés linking the project to [[Volition (company)|Volition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2016/05/04/rumor-volition-to-announce-agents-of-mayhem.aspx|title=Rumor: Volition And Deep Silver Working On New Title Agents of Mayhem|website=Game Informer|access-date=July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further speculation arose from a 2013 [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] interview with Volition's Scott Phillips, referring to ''Saints Row'' players as "agent[s] of mayhem".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/4/12/4151624/saint-row-4-volition|title=Agent of Mayhem: The life and near death of Saints Row's Volition|last=Grant|first=Christopher|date=April 12, 2013|website=Polygon|access-date=July 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was formally announced on June 6, 2016 with a cinematic announcement trailer released via [[IGN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/06/e3-2016-saints-row-developer-announces-agents-of-mayhem-a-ign-first|title=E3 2016: Saints Row Developer Announces Agents of Mayhem – IGN First|last=Ingenito|first=By Vince|website=IGN|access-date=July 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Agents of Mayhem'' was released in North America on August 15, 2017 and in Europe on August 18, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/agents-of-mayhem-release-date-announced-new-traile/1100-6449145/|title=Agents Of Mayhem Release Date Announced, New Trailer Channels Knight Rider And A-Team|first=Tamoor|last=Hussain|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=April 3, 2017|accessdate=April 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Agents of Mayhem'' received "mixed or average" reviews, according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MCPC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCPS4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCXONE"/&gt;

Nick Valdez's 7/10 score on ''[[Destructoid]]'' stated that the game was "Solid and definitely has an audience. There could be some hard-to-ignore faults, but the experience is fun."&lt;ref name="Destruct"/&gt;

5/10 was Alice Bell's score on VideoGamer.com, who said "Despite fun combat and characters, ''Agents of Mayhem'' becomes repetitive and grinding. In trying to chase the popularity of Saints Row, it misses having an identity of its own."&lt;ref name="VG"/&gt;

Michael Goroff's score of 7/10 on ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' said that "''Agents of Mayhem'' is one of those games with so much potential that just doesn’t quite reach the heights it probably could. That being said, it’s exhilarating combat and unique character system have me looking forward to a more polished, more fully conceived sequel."&lt;ref name="EGM"/&gt;

Connor Sheridan said on [[GamesRadar]] "Hero-swapping tactics add a unique edge to third-person combat, while humor and heart elevate Agents of Mayhem's typical world-saving fundamentals to memorable heights," and awarded it a score of 4 out of 5 stars.&lt;ref name="GRadar"/&gt;

Dan Ryckert from [[Giant Bomb]] gave the game a score of 2 out of 5 stars saying that "It may share a genre and universe with ''Saints Row'', but ''Agents of Mayhem'' is a lifeless husk of Volition's prior work."&lt;ref name="GB"/&gt;

"With fun combat and a likable cast, ''Agents of Mayhem'' leans too heavily on repetitive fights to be truly heroic," was Jon Ryan's conclusion on [[IGN]] with a score of 7.1/10.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt;

''[[PC Gamer]]''{{'}}s Jon Morcom scored the game a 67/100 with the consensus that it "Serves up a generous range of play styles, but it’s hampered by repetitive levels and a few uninspired design choices."&lt;ref name="PCGUS"/&gt;

[[Justin McElroy]] of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' awarded it 5.5/10 stating that "This has likely started to feel like a litany of sins rather than cogent critique, but it’s the best way I have of illustrating ''Agent of Mayhem'''s failings. It is not felled by any one thing, but is rather undone by a thousand little cuts. ''Agents of Mayhem'' heaps theoretical fun on you. Characters, powers, upgrades, tons of missions — it’s desperate for the player to just have fun. It’s a noble impulse, but one that it’s depressingly incapable of consistently delivering on.&lt;ref name="Poly"/&gt;

Brett Todd, in a review for [[GameSpot]], concluded "there's little to ''Agents of Mayhem'' beyond its foul-mouthed and bombastic attitude, which push the game into grating and obnoxious territory. Throw in the poor mission design and bugs, and you've got a game with loads of mayhem, but not much else."&lt;ref name=gamespot_review/&gt;

===Accolades===
[[Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw]] of ''[[Zero Punctuation]]'' ranked it fifth on his list of the Blandest Games of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Escapist |date=January 10, 2018 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He0lWIDGutc |title=Best, worst, and blandest games of 2017 (Zero Punctuation) |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=March 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was nominated for "Performance in a Comedy, Supporting" with [[Eliza Schneider]] as Agent Rama, and for "Writing in a Comedy" at the [[National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers]] Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://navgtr.org/archives/3351/ |title=Nominee List for 2017 |publisher=[[National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers]] |date=February 9, 2018 |accessdate=February 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://navgtr.org/archives/3365/ |title=Horizon wins 7; Mario GOTY |publisher=National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers |date=March 13, 2018 |accessdate=March 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MrBig-1992-Paris.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Mr. Big (American band)|Mr. Big]] was a  "Big in Japan" band from the United States.&lt;ref name="ongen"&gt;[http://www.ongen.net/international/artist/feature/mrbig090304/index.php ''Featured Artist : MR BIG''] Ongen.net (USEN) {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were one of the two most popular foreign music{{efn|group=lower alpha|"[[:ja:洋楽|Yōgaku]]" ("Foreign music"), every music from an outer place, more specifically, the Western world}} artists in Japan alongside [[Bon Jovi]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sankei Shimbun|Sankei]], [http://sankei.jp.msn.com/entertainments/entertainers/090221/tnr0902210817001-n1.htm Reunited Mr. Big is planning their first Japanese tour in this June] {{ja icon}} February 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Outside Japan, Mr. Big were generally considered a [[one-hit wonder]] with their single "[[To Be with You]]".]]

'''Big in Japan''' is an expression historically used to describe western based musical groups who achieve success in [[Japan]] but not necessarily in other parts of the world.

==Original usage==
The phrase began to appear on several major Japanese foreign-rock magazines, especially the ''Music Life'' magazine, in the late 1970s, and in most cases, the "big in Japan" artists became popular in Japan due to being featured by ''Music Life''.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The concept predated the phrase; [[Neil Sedaka]] made it big in Japan with "[[One Way Ticket (Neil Sedaka song)|One Way Ticket]]" before breaking through in his native United States, while [[Jimmy Osmond]], typically a side show to his older brothers [[The Osmonds]] in North America and Europe, cut several tracks in Japanese and received several gold records for his recordings.

In the late 20th century, notable "big in Japan" artists included several [[Arena rock|stadium rock]] bands from the [[United States]], [[Heavy metal music|metal]] artists from Northern European countries such as [[Norway]], [[Denmark]], and especially [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]] (e.g. the rock band [[Hanoi Rocks]]), [[eurobeat]] artists from [[Austria]], [[Germany]] and especially [[Italy]], and UK rock&lt;ref&gt;The term "UK rock" is an only-in-Japan term used for every [[rock music]] artist from the United Kingdom.[http://allabout.co.jp/entertainment/rockmusic/subject/msub_uk01.htm UK rock / Britpop] [[About.com|All About]] {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; artists.

Some bands have used their popularity in Japan as a springboard to break into other audiences. Notably, the [[power pop]] group [[Cheap Trick]], which had been known as the "American Beatles" in Japan for their appeal, achieved widespread success with their [[multi-platinum]] [[live album]] ''[[Cheap Trick at Budokan]]''. The band had previously struggled to break into the mainstream American market with their earlier albums. Furthermore, like Cheap Trick, some bands have lost their "big in Japan" titles after gaining popularity in their respective homelands. The most notable example is [[Bon Jovi]].&lt;ref name="ongen"/&gt;

For example, [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]] initially had only mediocre success in Europe and the United States,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} yet were "Big in Japan", as evidenced by their 1978 tour of the country and the double live album ''[[Tokyo Tapes (album)|Tokyo Tapes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=haEfq-nKqjgC&amp;pg=RA1-PA3-IA216&amp;dq=big+in+Japan+scorn&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a | title=The Rough Guide to Rock |author1=Peter Buckley |author2=Jonathan Buckley | year=2003 }} Rough Guides. {{ISBN|1-84353-105-4}}, {{ISBN|978-1-84353-105-0}}. p. 909&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is [[The Ventures]], a band formed in 1959 and touring Japan each year since 1965, having logged over 2,000 concerts there by 2006.&lt;ref name=Homan&gt;{{Cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NK9JF-_K4QC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=big+in+Japan+scorn&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA153,M1 | title=Access All Eras: Tribute Bands and Global Pop Culture | author=Shane Homan | year=2006 }} McGraw-Hill International. {{ISBN|0-335-21690-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-335-21690-1}}. pp. 152-154&lt;/ref&gt; "Being 'Big in Japan' turned into a positive sign of their closeness to the hearts of Japanese people, with the band embedded in national and local rock cultures."&lt;ref name=Homan/&gt;

Swedish band [[The Spotnicks]] toured Japan in 1966 after their song "Karelia" topped the Japanese charts the year prior, with hardly any promotion of the band. Around this time, the band's popularity in Europe had been waning due to changed taste in music, particularly in their home country where they had relatively few hits, none of them topping the charts. They went on a few more tours there in the late '60s and occasionally toured there in the '70s, '80s and for the last time in 1998. While their popularity in Japan is small compared to the one of The Ventures, "Karelia" is considered a classic song.

The phrase was used as the name of [[Big in Japan (band)|a UK punk band]] active from 1977 to 1982 (whose name inspired the title of [[Big in Japan (Alphaville song)|a 1984 hit single]] by [[New wave music|new wave]] band [[Alphaville (band)|Alphaville]]) and was the name of the lead track on the Grammy-winning 1999 album ''[[Mule Variations]]'' by [[Tom Waits]]. The [[mockumentary]] ''[[This is Spinal Tap]]'' parodies this phenomenon when the band schedules a Japanese tour after discovering that their single "Sex Farm" is inexplicably selling very well there.

American band Mountain reformed for a successful tour of Japan in 1973. A live album titled ''Twin Peaks'' was released in 1974. Mountain bass player and vocalist Felix Pappalardi then worked with the Japanese band Creation in 1976.

==Other usage==
It has also been used in sports, for instance, to describe [[Major League Baseball]] players who join Japanese clubs at the end of their careers, such as [[Daryl Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nROWw0tk_8YC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=big+in+Japan |author1=Matt Johanson |author2=Wylie Wong |author3=Jon Miller | title=San Francisco Giants: Where Have You Gone? | year=2007|publisher= Sports Publishing LLC|page=1| ISBN=1-59670-187-0}}, {{ISBN|978-1-59670-187-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Small in Japan"==
The derivative phrase "small in Japan", originally used for [[AC/DC]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barks.jp/news/?id=1000059190 Barks : AC/DC visits Japan, after 9 years silence] Retrieved 2010-07-14 {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been used since the early 1980s. In general, a small-in-Japan artist holds significant popularity in the Western world (in most cases the United States), and visits Japan many times to promote himself/herself, yet is almost unknown and unsuccessful in Japan despite being heavily featured by Japanese music media.

In Japanese culture, the phrase "small in Japan" is also used to describe Japanese celebrities who are unknown, unsuccessful or "forgotten" in Japan but making their ways outside Japan. The phrase has been used to refer to certain musicians such as [[Dir En Grey]], certain [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestlers]] such as [[Yoshihiro Tajiri]] and [[Yoshi Tatsu|Yoshitatsu]], certain [[fashion model]]s such as [[Ai Tominaga]] and [[Tao Okamoto]], and all the [[Miss Universe]] contestants from Japan, most of whom are former unsuccessful fashion models, including [[Kurara Chibana]] and [[Riyo Mori]].&lt;ref name="aj"&gt;[http://artisticjam.com/webtool/imanohito/?query=%E3%83%93%E3%83%83%E3%82%B0%E3%83%BB%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%83%BB%E3%82%B8%E3%83%A3%E3%83%91%E3%83%B3 Artistic Jam : "Big in Japan"] Retrieved 2010-07-14 {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one exceptional case, ''Digital Arts'' magazine has used the phrase to describe the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], a [[video game console]] that was a success all over the world except in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/news/index.cfm?newsid=1804&amp;page=3&amp;pagepos=9 Xbox sales 'small in Japan'] Retrieved 2007-07-11&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Blob''' ('''Frederick J.''' "'''Fred'''" '''Dukes''') is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is usually depicted as an adversary of the [[X-Men]]. A [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] originally depicted as an obese circus freak, the Blob claims to be immovable when he so desires. He possesses an extreme amount of pliable body mass, which grants him superhuman strength. Possessing the mindset of a bully, he mostly uses his powers for petty crime and as a member of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] and [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]]. He is one of the most prominent, long-running mutants to be depowered as a result of the ''[[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]'' storyline.

The Blob appears in the 2009 superhero film ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'', where he is played by actor [[Kevin Durand]].

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}
Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-writer [[Jack Kirby]], he first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #3 (January 1964).

==Fictional character biography==

===Early years===
Born in [[Lubbock, Texas]], Fred J. Dukes starts out as a member of a [[circus]] [[sideshow]] under the name "The Blob". His act would be others trying to move him. He is detected and contacted by [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] via [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], who sees his performance and tells him that he (Dukes) is a mutant, and asks him to join the X-Men. At the mansion, the other X-Men dislike Dukes for his obnoxious attitude. Iceman uses his power against Dukes to create an ice block round his foot, but the Blob easily escapes. The Blob refuses Xavier's invitation, saying he is better than the other X-Men. When Xavier tries erasing his mind of what has transpired, the Blob escapes the Mansion despite the efforts of the Beast and uses the sewer to get away without being followed. He tells the manager of the carnival he is taking over, then gathers up the other circus members and they attack the mansion, as he plans to get the X-Men's technology and take over the world. Meanwhile, Xavier works on a device so he can erase the memories of many people. The carnival succeeds in defeating the X-Men despite a warning from Angel. They tie up the X-Men and leave them on the lawn. They then enter the mansion to find the Professor and his technology. Xavier telepathically contacts Marvel Girl and tells her to remove her blindfold using her telekinesis, then levitate a knife from a performer's tent to cut through her bonds, after which she frees the other members. Xavier is able to wipe everyone's minds after the carnival is stopped by a wall of ice, and the Blob goes back to the circus.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' Vol. 1 #3)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joining the Brotherhood===
The mutant [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] soon seeks out the Blob to recruit him into his [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], restoring his memory through a jarring blow to the head. The Blob temporarily accepts the invitation, but leaves when it is revealed that Magneto has no real concern for the Blob's safety after he is hit by explosives which were launched at the X-Men. He goes back to the Circus.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #7&lt;/ref&gt; He teams up with [[Unus the Untouchable|Unus]] due to the alien Lucifer, who soon becomes his confidant. They disguise themselves as X-Men and commit crimes.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #20&lt;/ref&gt; The Blob also serves as a member of [[Factor Three]].&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #37-39&lt;/ref&gt; He briefly works as an operative for the [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]], where he fights the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]].&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Adventures'' #12-13&lt;/ref&gt; With the reorganized Brotherhood, the Blob fights [[Professor X]] and the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. He is reverted to infancy by [[Alpha the Ultimate Mutant]].&lt;ref&gt;''Defenders'' #15-16&lt;/ref&gt; The Blob is later returned to adulthood, and fights the [[Champions (1975 team)|Champions of Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;''Champions'' #17&lt;/ref&gt;

He later winds up in prison, but is freed by [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] in order to recruit him into her incarnation of the Brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #140&lt;/ref&gt;  He becomes part of the plot to assassinate [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Kelly]], the event which leads to the apocalyptic alternate future of ''[[Days of Future Past]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #141-142&lt;/ref&gt; He also battles the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] as a member of the Brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Annual'' #10&lt;/ref&gt; With Unus, he battles the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].&lt;ref name="Marvel Fanfare #7"&gt;''Marvel Fanfare'' #7&lt;/ref&gt; With the Brotherhood, he battles the X-Men once more.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #177-178&lt;/ref&gt; He witnesses the apparent death of Unus, then goes berserk and attacks [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]].&lt;ref&gt;''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #91&lt;/ref&gt;

He remains with the Brotherhood, becoming a special operative of the federal government when the Brotherhood is reformed as the government-sponsored [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]]. On the team's first mission, they help capture Magneto.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #199&lt;/ref&gt; They then battle the X-Men in San Francisco.&lt;ref name="Uncanny X-Men #206"&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #206&lt;/ref&gt; Blob also participates in Freedom Force's capture of the Avengers for the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Annual'' #15&lt;/ref&gt; With Freedom Force, he attempts to capture [[Rusty Collins]], then battles [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]].&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' #8-10&lt;/ref&gt; With Freedom Force, he battles the X-Men in San Francisco,&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #223&lt;/ref&gt; and later assists in the attempt to arrest the X-Men in Dallas,&lt;ref name="Uncanny X-Men #225"&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #225&lt;/ref&gt; battling the [[New Mutants]] in Dallas as well.&lt;ref&gt;''New Mutants'' #64&lt;/ref&gt; He battles X-Factor again,&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' #30-31&lt;/ref&gt; and under [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]]'s orders, he and [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|Pyro]] battle [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] in an attempt to capture a young mutant.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' #269&lt;/ref&gt; He again attempts to arrest Rusty Collins, fighting the New Mutants again.&lt;ref&gt;''New Mutants'' #78-80&lt;/ref&gt; He joins [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]] and Pyro in attacking Avengers headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #312&lt;/ref&gt; With Freedom Force, he finally captures Rusty Collins and fellow New Mutant [[Skids (comics)|Skids]]. He helps to capture [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], but is defeated by Cable and then by [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] during an attempt to recapture Cable.&lt;ref&gt;''New Mutants'' #86-89&lt;/ref&gt; With Freedom Force, he assists in thwarting a jailbreak from the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]].&lt;ref&gt;''Vault Graphic Novel''&lt;/ref&gt;

After Freedom Force's dissolution, the Blob participates in other versions of the Brotherhood, including one led by [[Toad (comics)|Toad]] and another led by Professor X; the Blob takes over as leader of the latter when Xavier leaves.

The psychic entity [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] later recruits Blob, vastly upgrading his powers and abilities (in his powered-up state, his mutation becomes virtually identical to that of [[Phat (comics)|Phat]]). During this time, the Blob fights the various members of [[X-Force]] and is soundly defeated in each encounter. Months later, a powered-down Dukes joins the new Brotherhood led once again by Mystique, alongside Toad, [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], and the [[Mastermind (Martinique Jason)|daughter]] of the original [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]].

When [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] recreates the Brotherhood of Mutants, Blob offers to join but is quickly dismissed by Exodus, who considers him useless. This is a major blow to Dukes' already weak self-esteem, for which he seeks the counsel of therapist [[Sean Garrison (comics)|Sean Garrison]]. After a session, Blob attacks the Xavier Institute, though he is defeated by the combined efforts of the [[New Mutants]] and the [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]]. He is then arrested by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]

===Post M-Day===
Due to the [[Scarlet Witch]]'s depowering of 90% of Earth's mutants, the Blob is one of the [[Decimation (comics)|thousands to lose their power]], though his epidermis does not shrink to compensate for his loss of mass, leaving him with huge folds of loose skin. The depressed Blob attempts to commit [[suicide]], but his skin folds prevent him from cutting through to any major blood vessels on his throat or wrists.

Someone that resembles the Blob is seen apprehended by the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] and is seen in the Folding Castle's Detention Quadrant.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' vol. 1 #103&lt;/ref&gt;

Blob later resurfaces as a member of X-Cell, a group of depowered mutants that blames the government for the loss of their powers, attacking [[District X|Mutant Town]] in defiance of the [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]. After mistakenly getting into a fight with [[Rictor]] and [[Jamie Madrox|Multiple Man]] and getting in a cheap shot on Rictor, he stole a car. With fellow X-Cell member [[Fatale (comics)|Fatale]], he attempted to flee, eventually hitting an open [[manhole]] (left open earlier in the day by [[Strong Guy]] and [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]]) and causing the car to crash leaving Blob hanging from the car. When both of them ran afoul of [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]], Blob was thrown from the car.

Through unknown means, Dukes loses the excess skin and his fortunes turn in his favor. Now known as '''Freddie Dukes''', he has become a weight-loss guru in Japan, and is to star in an upcoming movie filmed in San Francisco made by [[Kingo Sunen]].  He is also seen with [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and the [[High Evolutionary]].&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #500&lt;/ref&gt;

In the miniseries "Magneto: Not a Hero", [[Joseph (comics)|Joseph]] is resurrected under unknown circumstances and forms a new Brotherhood of Mutants with [[Astra (comics)|Astra]] and mutated deformed versions of Blob, [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]], [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], [[Scarlet Witch]], and [[Toad (comics)|Toad]]. It is soon revealed that these actually are clones created by Joseph.&lt;ref&gt;''Magneto: Not a Hero'' #1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Uncanny X-Men'' #16, Fred Dukes is working with Mystique in Genosha and is once again shown as heavily obese and appears to have his powers restored.&lt;ref&gt;Uncanny X-Men #16 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Mystique has supplied him with Mutant Growth Hormones (MGH) extracted from [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]].&lt;!-- different parts of Mystique Dazzler Genosha storyline are spread across various X-Men comics in 2013-2014 (before April) --&gt;{{issue|date=April 2014}}

==Powers and abilities==
Before being depowered, the Blob's [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] physiology granted him a number of advantages. He had superhuman strength, endurance, and great resistance to physical injury due to a further mutation. The Blob's elastic, blubbery skin proved to be difficult to penetrate by gunfire, missiles, and even [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]'s claws, though with sufficient force and a favorable angle, the claws can lacerate his flesh. For instance, the Blob once sat on the X-Man, but jumped off in pain when Wolverine extended his sheathed claws into the Blob's rear.&lt;ref name="Uncanny X-Men #225"/&gt; On one occasion, a concentrated optic blast fired by [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] was sufficient to puncture a hole through his shoulder, much to the shock of Dukes himself. The magic swords of both [[Black Raazer]] and the [[Arabian Knight (comics)|Arabian Knight]] were able to harm him.{{Issue|date=October 2009}}

He could also alter his personal mono-directional [[gravitation|gravity]] field beneath himself to make himself virtually immovable as long as he was in contact with the ground, although an incredible force can uproot him, along with a chunk of whatever he is standing on. The only beings on record to have been able to move the Blob against his wishes are the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]],&lt;ref name="Marvel Fanfare #7"/&gt; [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], and [[Strong Guy]] (powered-up near his limit by absorbing [[kinetic energy]]),&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' vol.1, #107&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] has managed to lift Dukes by digging underground and raising the piece of earth Dukes stands on, stating this as an exception to his immovability.&lt;ref name="Uncanny X-Men #206"/&gt; Magneto once was able to move the Blob by lifting the ground under the Blob's feet via metal pipes.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #7&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his appearance, the Blob's speed and agility are those of a fairly athletic male of normal stature, a fact which frequently catches his opponents by surprise.

The Blob's superhuman strength greatly increased over the years, in a manner similar to that of the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]. This improvement is said to be a result of his ongoing mutation.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

The Blob is vulnerable to attacks directed at his face, as his eyes, nose, mouth, and ears do not have the same protection as the rest of his body. Dukes is also susceptible to psionic attacks and psychic manipulation, and he can be incapacitated by sensory assaults; for example, [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] was able to render Blob unconscious solely through the use of his sonic scream. On another occasion, [[Sleepwalker (comics)|Sleepwalker]] defeated the Blob by using warp beams to wrap a steel girder around the villain, crushing his blubber and causing him great physical pain. The [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] once took the opposite approach, harming the Blob by grabbing and stretching his flab. While he is all but invulnerable to direct kinetic attacks, such as punches, kicks or gunshots, he is susceptible to [[concussion]]s and other harm resulting from sufficiently powerful impacts, as [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] knocked him out by luring him underneath a massive bell and then having it dropped on him with the aid of a young female mutant.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' Vol. 1 #269&lt;/ref&gt;

Dukes can be incapacitated by drinking alcohol, although due to his immense mass, a large amount of alcohol is required.

==Other versions==

===''Age of Apocalypse''===
Blob appears briefly in the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' as a test subject that [[Dark Beast|Henry McCoy]] was toying with in the Breeding Pens in a direct violation of the Kelly Pact that [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] signed in order to keep the Human High Council occupied and at bay while he rallied his forces.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: Alpha''&lt;/ref&gt;

McCoy considered Blob's mutation useless which enraged Blob. Dukes freed himself, and attacked his experimenter. [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] came to McCoy's rescue, but Dukes proved to be even too much for the Prelate to handle. His pseudo freedom was fleeting for moments later the head of the pens, Havok's older brother [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], showed up to deliver a searing optic blast that would put him back in his place.&lt;ref&gt;''Factor X'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Age of Apocalypse (limited series)|Age of Apocalypse]] was revisited in the 10th anniversary, Blob was a member of [[Mister Sinister|Sinister]]'s team known as [[Sinister Six]]. It appears that McCoy or Sinister himself had his powers altered in a manner that allowed Blob to project his gravitational field outward. When the Sinister Six met the X-Men in battle, Dukes' new powers were used to sweep the X-Men off their feet with the [[Silver Samurai]] receiving a double dose. [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] attempted to fell the behemoth with multiple punches, but Dukes remained standing regardless of how many hits he got in. It was not until [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] stepped in with a punch that had the power necessary to overtake him that the mammoth would topple over. Following the Sinister Six's defeat, Blob managed to escape.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: Age of Apocalypse'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

Later he's seen as a member of the Black Legion, a group of psychotic altered mutants under the supervision of a now insane [[Wolverine (character)|Weapon X]].&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #12&lt;/ref&gt; It is also revealed that he left the Age of Apocalypse timeline and joined [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel's]] quest to become the new heir of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. He's seen in Akkaba Metropolis under the North Pole and he was the one to prevent the escape of [[Psylocke]].&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #15&lt;/ref&gt;

In the "Final Execution Saga" story line in ''Uncanny X-Force'', Fredrick is part of a new [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] led by [[Daken]] with the aim of taking down X-Force and turning Evan Sabahnur into a new [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]].&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #30&lt;/ref&gt; During the saga the X-Force team is captured and tortured after [[Alternative versions of Nightcrawler|Nightcrawler]] from the [[Age of Apocalypse]] universe betrays the team,&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #32&lt;/ref&gt; to get his revenge on Fredrick due to him eating his wife Linda. Kurt seemingly succeeds in his goal of revenge by teleporting a live [[shark]] into Fredrick's stomach during a fight with him, causing him to be devoured from within.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #33&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Cable &amp; Deadpool''===
[[Cable &amp; Deadpool|Deadpool's search for Cable]] across alternate timelines forces an encounter with the Blob of "an age of Apocalypse" (not to be confused with the [[Age of Apocalypse|X-Men story arc of the same name]]). In this reality, Blob has taken the mantle of Famine, one of the [[Horsemen of Apocalypse#Other versions|Horsemen of Apocalypse]].&lt;ref&gt;''Cable &amp; Deadpool'' #15&lt;/ref&gt;

===House of M===
Put in an internment camp after [[Bolivar Trask]]'s rise to power in the ''[[House of M]]'' reality, he was freed in Magneto's first major raid on US soil. After being freed, he first took his mutant name, "Blob" and was instrumental in the destruction of several [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]]. He then joined Magneto's mutant group.&lt;ref&gt;Civil War: House of M #2&lt;/ref&gt; Blob is seen as a member of the Genoshan Black Ops version of the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]. It was later revealed that Dukes is also a member of an NYPD strike team called the Brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;''House of M: Avengers'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Marvel Noir''===
Eric Magnus is Chief of Detectives and Fred appears as a member of his Brotherhood, a cabal of bent policemen. He is initially partnered with rookie Detective Peter Magnus, and later with Detective [[Mortimer Toynbee]].&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men Noir'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Marvel Zombies''===
Blob appears twice in the ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' universe. He is alive when first encountered, but being pursued by several zombie versions of Marvel characters, including Pyro, Black Cat, Iron Fist, Toad and Rhino.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness'' #2-3 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  He is later seen as a zombie fighting the X-Men.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Zombies'' #5 (May 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultimate Marvel===
[[Image:UltimateToad.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Ultimate Blob in a chokehold by [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] with [[Toad (comics)|Toad's]] tongue around his arm.]]
The [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]] version of Blob, real name '''Franklin Dukes''',&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimatum: X-Men Requiem'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; is a member of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy]]. His powers are similar to that of his [[Earth-616]] counterpart, although he has been moved by a helicopter during the ''[[Ultimate Weapon X|Weapon X]]'' saga, suggesting that he may be less powerful. He seems to eat constantly, and is often seen browsing the internet or chatting to people via instant messaging. One such incident sees the Blob pretend to be a female model/physicist named Naomi who [[Cybersex|cyber-seduces]] the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Man]] [[Alternative versions of Beast|Beast]]—leading to the discovery of [[Ultimate Magneto|Magneto]]'s survival and to the ''[[Ultimate War]]'' saga. Unlike his Earth-616 counterpart, the Blob may very well have additional superhuman-eating powers as part of his mutation, as not only has he threatened to actually eat his enemies alive, but it was expressly stated that he had personally consumed all of the [[Weapon X]] computers in a matter of moments when the Brotherhood invaded the Weapon X compound to rescue the X-Men.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate X-Men Volume 2: Return to Weapon X''&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|Ultimatum]]'', the Blob is seen eating the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], proving the cannibalistic claims are true.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimatum'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Hank Pym]] grows to a gigantic size and bites the Blob's head off in return.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimatum'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been revealed that Blob was [[Liz Allan]]'s estranged genetic father after she discovered [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|her own mutant abilities]]. He impregnated Liz's mother while working for a circus sideshow.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #120&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been shown that the Blob fathered a son ('''Theodore "Tubby Teddy" Allan''') by an unknown woman. Teddy is in high school and has his father's same bulky appearance and similar abilities, as he was shot at point blank range and merely said "It tickles".&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Comics: X'' #4&lt;/ref&gt; He later joins [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]]'s new Brotherhood as the new iteration of Blob.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Comics: X'' #5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planet X===
Blob is an enforcer on the alternate universe when the Apocalypse Twins skew the time lines and create a mutant utopia.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny Avengers'' 18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows===
On Earth-18119 as seen in the pages of ''Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows'', Blob is seen as a member of the Brotherhood of Mutants.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows'' Vol. 2 #6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NDAJ Bo-taoshi 4.JPG|thumb|220px|alt=alt text|Two squads scrambling for possession of the pole.]]
'''{{nihongo|Bo-taoshi|棒倒し|bōtaoshi|lead=yes|extra="pole toppling"}}''', is a [[Capture the Flag|capture-the-flag]]-like game, played on sports days at schools in Japan. The game, traditionally played by cadets at the [[National Defense Academy of Japan|National Defense Academy (NDA) of Japan]] on its anniversary, is famous for its size, wherein two teams of 150 individuals each vie for control of a single large pole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Furbush |first=James |url=http://hypervocal.com/vids/2011/bo-taoshi-super-happy-pole-pulldown-sport-time/ |title=Bo-Taoshi: Super Happy Pole Pulldown Sport Time |publisher=: |date=2011-07-14 |accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each team is split into two groups of 75 attackers and 75 defenders. The defenders begin in a defensive orientation respective to their own pole, while the attackers assume position some measure away from the other team's pole. A team is victorious if it is able to lower the pole of the opposing team (which begins [[perpendicular]] to the ground) to a thirty-degree angle (respective to the ground), before the other team reaches this goal. Until a rule-change in 1973, the angle of victory was only forty-five degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deuceofdavenport.com/2011/05/new-sport-bo-taoshi/ |title=New Sport: Bo-Taoshi |publisher=Deuce of Davenport |date=2011-05-18 |accessdate=2011-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807051552/http://www.deuceofdavenport.com/2011/05/new-sport-bo-taoshi/ |archivedate=2011-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positions==
Described here are positions seen in the NDA of Japan, but usually the position Ninja is absent when played in other schools. On the defensive half, positions include: pole support, barrier, interference, scrum disabler, and the ninja. Offensive positions include: springboard/scrum, pole attackers, and general support attackers.

===Defense===
*Pole support - hold the pole in the upright position.
*Barrier - the largest part of the defense, their job is to protect the pole.
*Interference - harass and interrupt attacks that get within the barrier.
*Scrum disabler - the scrum is the offensive strategy in which the attackers use their teammate's back to spring themselves over the barrier and onto the pole. The scrum disablers do whatever they can to eliminate this attack.
*Ninja - this is the single man at the top of the pole. This is one of the most important positions on defense. The ninja must lean to the opposite side if the pole is being tilted to counteract the weight.

===Offense===
*Springboard/scrum - the scrum act as stepping stones so their offensive teammates can jump over the barrier and have easy access to the pole.
*Pole attackers - in charge of taking the ninja down and using their weight to bring the pole down.
*General support attackers - do anything to make it hard on the defense.

"'''Bride of Chaotica!'''" is the 106th episode of the [[Americans|American]] [[science fiction]] television series ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' airing on the [[UPN]] network, the 12th episode of the [[Star Trek: Voyager (season 5)|fifth season]]. The episode originally aired on January 27, 1999.  The episode largely takes place on the [[holodeck]], which is running a holo-program in black and white instead of the usual color. This was because of a small fire to the Bridge set that had occurred while the episode was in production; as a result the Bridge scenes were shot weeks later after the set was repaired and scenes that were originally set for the Bridge were either entirely rewritten or set on a different part of the ship. The episode contains many elements of the classic 1936 film serial ''[[Flash Gordon (serial)|Flash Gordon]]''.

In this episode, ''Voyager'' becomes stuck on an interdimensional rift as photonic beings from the other dimension attempt contact in the holodeck, meeting the photonic villains of Ens. Paris' "Captain Proton" program, who promptly attack them.

==Plot==
During an episode of ''The Adventures of [[Captain Proton]]'' on the holodeck (a recurring Voyager hologram program homage to [[Flash Gordon (serial)|Flash Gordon]]), Ensigns [[Tom Paris]] and [[Harry Kim (Star Trek)|Harry Kim]] are forced to leave the program running when spatial distortions trap the ship and disrupt their control over the computer. While the command staff of ''[[USS Voyager (Star Trek)|Voyager]]'' seek to discover a way to free the ship from the spatial distortions, extra-dimensional aliens who exist in a [[Photonics|photonic]] state cross over from their own dimension through a distortion located in the holodeck. There, they are detected and attacked by [[Chaotica]] (who bears a striking resemblance to Flash Gordon's primary villain [[Ming the Merciless]]), who believes them to be from the [[Five-dimensional space#In popular culture|fifth dimension]], and whose holographic (photonic) weaponry — though harmless to humans — is deadly to the aliens.''

Eventually, the crew discover the war being waged between Chaotica and the fifth dimension and must defeat him by playing out their roles as the fictional Captain Proton (played by Tom Paris), his sidekick Buster Kincaid (Harry Kim) the President of Earth (the ship's holographic [[Doctor (Star Trek: Voyager)|Doctor]], who is himself a photonic being), and Arachnia, Queen of the Spider People. [[Kathryn Janeway|Captain Janeway]] allows Paris to convince her to take on the latter role.

Queen Arachnia, posing as Chaotica's bride, eventually convinces him to lower his shields so her friends could attend their wedding. Though initially suspicious, Chaotica does as requested, and Captain Proton is able to fire his "death ray" at Chaotica and defeat him, thereby freeing ''Voyager'' and allowing ship and crew to continue on their journey home.

'''Carpa Valentina''' was a [[theatre]] [[wiktionary:troupe|troupe]] of the [[Mexico|Mexican]] ''[[carpa]]'' (traveling tent) circuit during the 1920s and 1930s.

It was founded by a family of [[Russians|Russian]] [[circus]] performers who fled the turmoil of the 1919 [[Russian Civil War]], arriving in the port of [[Manzanillo, Colima|Manzanillo]] in 1923. The troupe consisted of Gregor Ivanoff, the father of the family, who Hispanicized his name to Gregorio Ivanova, his three daughters, his son-in-law Estanislao Shilinsky, a [[Lithuania]]n who wrote the material, and native Mexican performers. They set up their act in the [[Tacuba, D.F.|Tacuba]] ''delegación'' of [[Mexico City]].

In 1929, Mario Moreno "[[Cantinflas]]" joined the troupe. Shilinsky coached the comedian, then eighteen years of age, and helped him refine his style. Together, the two turned the Carpa Valentina into the hottest ticket in town.

Moreno began courting Valentina Ivanova, the daughter for which the troupe was named, but her father never approved of the relationship and refused to increase the comic's salary despite his success. Fed up with the abuse, Moreno left the troupe, bringing his writer with him.

'''Cavalia''' is a company that specializes in the creation, production and touring of live shows. Founded by [[:fr:Normand Latourelle|Normand Latourelle]], the family business reimagines the equestrian and theatrical arts. With its headquarters in Montreal, Cavalia is an integral part of Canada's cultural heritage, and the largest Canadian-owned enterprise specializing in live shows. Its expertise in high technology, multimedia and special effects creates magical, unique, innovative and never-before-seen experiences. Its first show, ''Cavalia'', has been seen by more than 5 million people across North America, Europe, Australia, the Middle East and Asia since its 2003 debut. ''Odysseo'', the company's second show, has toured to rave reviews and public acclaim since its 2011 premiere.

==Name origin==
Cavalia is a fabricated word, inspired by the Italian, Spanish and French words for horse (cavallo, caballo and cheval) and the French and English word [[cavalier]].

==History==
Created in 2003 by [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normand_Latourelle?veaction=edit Normand Latourelle] under the name of "Voltige",&lt;ref&gt;Cavalia, A Dream of Freedom, François Broussseau and Valérie Martin, translated by Waguih Khoury, 2004, {{ISBN|1-897092-01-6}}, p.20&lt;/ref&gt; the very first show was held in Shawinigan, Quebec. The large-scale multimedia performance the company delivers is often compared to [[Cirque du Soleil]], of which he was one of the four original co-founders as well as Managing Director and Executive Vice-President from 1985 to 1990. Apart from Latourelle's history, Cavalia has no affiliation with Cirque du Soleil and remains a separate entity. The company's original production, ''Cavalia: A Magical Encounter Between Human and Horse'', has been touring since 2003.&lt;ref name="cavalia.net"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cavalia.net/files/cavalia/melbourne_au_-_press_kit_full_-_as_of_august2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927074926/http://cavalia.net/files/cavalia/melbourne_au_-_press_kit_full_-_as_of_august2.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Odysseo'', Cavalia's newest show, premiered in October 2011 in [[Laval, Quebec]].

In May 2009, the [[Government of Canada]] provided Cavalia with a $4-million loan to Cavalia Inc. to develop new productions and construct a horse-training facility in [[Sutton, Quebec]].&lt;ref name="Gazette"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://montrealgazette.com/Cavalia+gets+million+jump+production/1631924/story.html|title=Cavalia gets a $4-million jump on new production|date=2009-05-26|work=Montreal Gazette|publisher=Canwest|accessdate=2009-05-26|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527234921/http://www.montrealgazette.com/business/fp/Cavalia%2Bgets%2Bmillion%2Bjump%2Bproduction/1631924/story.html|archivedate=2009-05-27|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First Production: Cavalia, A Magical Encounter Between Human and Horse==
The first show is a tribute to the relationship between humans and horses throughout history. It is described as an equestrian ballet, it expresses a "dream of freedom, cooperation and harmony".&lt;ref&gt;http://cavalia.net/en/cavalia-show/about-show&lt;/ref&gt; Riders, acrobats, dancers and musicians share the stage with horses. ''A Magical Encounter Between Human and Horse'' features about 50 horses, 5 musicians and 45 artists including riders, aerialists, and acrobats.&lt;ref name="cavalia.net"/&gt;
[[File:Cavalia mirror.jpg|thumb|right|300px]]

===Performers===

Many of the horses are [[Lusitano]]s, and the remainder are [[Andalusian horse]]s,  [[Canadian Horse]]s, [[American Quarter Horse]]s, [[Paint horse]]s, [[Belgian (horse)|Belgians]], [[Percheron]]s, [[Arabian (horse)|Arabians]], and [[Appaloosa]]s. The show's horses were originally from [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Spain]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;http://cavalia.net/en/horse-breeds&lt;/ref&gt;
These horses eat 40 bales of hay per day; they consume 
900&amp;nbsp;kg (1980&amp;nbsp;lb) 
of grain and 
20&amp;nbsp;kg (44&amp;nbsp;lb)carrots. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The show also features a team of over 20 human stars from [[Guinea]], [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[Mexico]], and [[Morocco]], including acrobats and horsemen and horsewomen, including most notably, the amazing husband and wife team of Frederic Pignon and Magali Delgado.

===The Big Top===
150 people work for the tent raising and site preparation. The installation lasts 12 days, while the removal is completed in three days. The tent is 30 metres high, the equivalent height of a 10-story building. 6635 m2 of fabric is used to create the marquee that extends over an area of 2 440m2. A screen of 70 metres serves as a backdrop for projections and multimedia effects. The stage is 50 metres in width, the length of an Olympic pool. 2,500 tons of sand, earth and gravel, the equivalent of 100 trucks, are used to create the scene. The Big Top can accommodate up to 2, 000 spectators.  Cavalia's village includes nine tents: the White Big Top, a Rendezvous VIP Tent, Entrance tents, two Artistic tents, two warming tents, the Stable and the Staff Cafeteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cavalia.net/en/cavalia-show/big-top# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-03-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213164835/http://www.cavalia.net/en/cavalia-show/big-top# |archive-date=2012-02-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cavalia summarizes the show as depicting "horses and humans leaving together to meet a world between dream and reality by traveling through the great wonders that nature has offered, deserts, waterfalls, canyons and glaciers."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cavalia.net/en/odysseo/about-show&lt;/ref&gt; This second show portrays equestrian arts, acrobatics, music, multimedia projections and special effects under one Big Top. It features some 300 different costumes. Non-riders do acrobatics and sing west African songs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.equestrianstylist.com/2012/02/cavalias-odysseo-horses-arrive-in-style-in-miami-florida/&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''children's song''' may be a [[nursery rhyme]] set to music, a song that children invent and share among themselves or a modern creation intended for entertainment, use in the home or education. Although children’s songs have been recorded and studied in some cultures more than others, they appear to be universal in human society.

==Categories==
[[Iona and Peter Opie]], pioneers of the academic study of children’s culture, divided children’s songs into two classes: those taught to children by adults, which when part of a traditional culture they saw as nursery rhymes, and those that children taught to each other, which formed part of the independent culture of childhood.&lt;ref&gt;I. Opie and P. Opie, ''The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren'' (Granada, 1977), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; A further use of the term ''children's song'' is for songs written for the entertainment or education of children, usually in the modern era. In practice none of these categories is entirely discrete, since, for example, children often reuse and adapt nursery rhymes, and many songs now considered as traditional were deliberately written by adults for commercial ends.

The Opies further divided nursery rhymes into a number of groups, including&lt;ref&gt;I. Opie and P. Opie, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes'' (Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd edn., 1997), pp. 12–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Amusements (including [[Clapping game|action songs]])
*[[Counting-out game|Counting rhymes]]
*[[Lullaby|Lullabies]]
*[[Riddles]]

Playground or children’s street rhymes they sub-divided into two major groups: those associated with games and those that were entertainments, with the second category including&lt;ref&gt;I. Opie and P. Opie, ''The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren'' (Granada, 1977), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Improper verses
*[[Jingles]]
*[[Light poetry|Joke rhymes]]
*[[Nonsense verse]]
*Macabre rhymes
*[[Popular songs]]
*[[Parodies]]
*[[Slogans]]
*[[Tongue-twisters]]

In addition, since the advent of popular music publication in the nineteenth century, a large number of songs have been produced for and often adopted by children. Many of these imitate the form of nursery rhymes, and a number have come to be accepted as such. They can be seen to have arisen from a number of sources, including

*[[Children's books|Publishing]]

==Nursery or Mother Goose rhymes==
{{Main|Nursery rhyme}}
The term ''nursery rhyme'' is used for "traditional" songs for young children in Britain and many [[English speaking countries]]; but this usage dates only from the nineteenth century, and in North America the older ''Mother Goose rhyme'' is still often used.&lt;ref name="autogenerated383"&gt;H. Carpenter and M. Prichard, ''The Oxford Companion to Children's Literature'' (Oxford University Press, 1984), p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest children's songs of which we have records are [[Lullaby|lullabies]], which can be found in every human culture.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"&gt;I. Opie and P. Opie, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes'' (Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd edn., 1997), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman nurses' lullaby, "Lalla, Lalla, Lalla, aut dormi, aut lacte", may be the oldest to survive.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt; Many medieval English verses associated with the birth of [[Jesus]] (including "[[Lullay, mine liking|Lullay, my liking, my dere son, my sweting]]") take the form of a lullabies and may be adaptations of contemporary lullabies.&lt;ref name="autogenerated326"&gt;H. Carpenter and M. Prichard, ''The Oxford Companion to Children's Literature'' (Oxford University Press, 1984), pp. 326.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, most of those used today date from the seventeenth century onwards.&lt;ref name="autogenerated326"/&gt; We know that some rhymes were medieval or sixteenth-century in origin, including "[[To market, to market]]" and "[[Cock a doodle doo]]", but most were not written down until the eighteenth century, when the publishing of children's books began to move towards entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;I. Opie and P. Opie, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes'' (Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd edn., 1997), pp. 30–1, 47–8, 128–9 and 299.&lt;/ref&gt; The first English collections were ''Tommy Thumb's Song Book'' and a sequel, ''Tommy Thumb's Pretty Song Book'', both thought to have been published before 1744, and at this point such songs were known as "Tommy Thumb's songs".&lt;ref&gt;H. Carpenter and M. Prichard, ''The Oxford Companion to Children's Literature'' (Oxford University Press, 1984), pp. 382–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of [[John Newbery]]'s ''Mother Goose's Melody; or, Sonnets for the Cradle'' ([[circa|c]]. 1785) is the first record we have of many classic rhymes still in use today.&lt;ref&gt;H. Carpenter and M. Prichard, ''The Oxford Companion to Children's Literature'' (Oxford University Press, 1984), pp. 363–4.&lt;/ref&gt; These rhymes seem to have come from a variety of sources, including traditional [[riddles]], [[proverb]]s, [[ballads]], lines of [[mummers]]' plays, drinking songs, historical events, and, it has been suggested, ancient pagan rituals.&lt;ref name="autogenerated383"/&gt; Roughly half of the current body of recognised "traditional" English rhymes were known by the mid-eighteenth century.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1951"&gt;I. Opie and P. Opie, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes'' (Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd edn., 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early nineteenth century, printed collections of rhymes began to spread to other countries, including [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]]'s ''Popular Rhymes of Scotland'' (1826) and, in the United States, ''Mother Goose's Melodies'' (1833).&lt;ref name="autogenerated383"/&gt; We sometimes know the origins and authors of rhymes from this period, such as "[[Twinkle Twinkle Little Star]]", which combined an eighteenth-century French tune with a poem by the English writer [[Jane Taylor (poet)|Jane Taylor]], and "[[Mary Had a Little Lamb]]", written by Sarah Josepha Hale of Boston in 1830.&lt;ref name="autogenerated383"/&gt; Nursery rhymes were also often collected by early folk-song collectors, including, in Scotland, [[Sir Walter Scott]] and, in Germany, [[Clemens Brentano]] and [[Achim von Arnim]] in ''[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]'' (1806–8).&lt;ref&gt;H. Carpenter and M. Prichard, ''The Oxford Companion to Children's Literature'' (Oxford University Press, 1984), p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt; The first, and possibly the most important, academic collections to focus in this area were [[James Orchard Halliwell]]'s ''The Nursery Rhymes of England'' (1842) and ''Popular Rhymes and Tales'' (1849).&lt;ref&gt;R. M. Dorson, ''The British Folklorists: a History'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1999), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of [[Sabine Baring-Gould]]'s ''A Book of Nursery Songs'' (1895), child folklore had become an academic study, full of comments and footnotes. The early years of the twentieth century are notable for the addition of sophisticated illustrations to books of children's songs, including Caldecott's ''Hey Diddle Diddle Picture Book'' (1909) and [[Arthur Rackham]]'s ''Mother Goose'' (1913). The definitive study of English rhymes remains the work of [[Iona and Peter Opie]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1951"/&gt;

==Children’s playground and street songs ==
{{distinguish|Playground (song)}}
In contrast to nursery rhymes, which are learned in childhood and passed from adults to children only after a gap of 20 to 40 years, children's playground and street songs, like much children's lore, are learned and passed on almost immediately.&lt;ref&gt;I. Opie and P. Opie, ''The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren'' (Granada, 1977), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The Opies noted that this had two important effects: the rapid transmission of new and adjusted versions of songs, which could cover a country like Great Britain in perhaps a month by exclusively oral transmission, and the process of "wear and repair", in which songs were changed, modified and fixed as words and phrases were forgotten, misunderstood or updated.&lt;ref&gt;I. Opie and P. Opie, ''The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren'' (Granada, 1977), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins of songs===
Some rhymes collected in the mid-twentieth century can be seen to have origins as early in the eighteenth century. Where sources could be identified, they could often be traced to popular adult songs, including [[ballads]] and those in [[music hall]] and [[minstrel shows]].&lt;ref&gt;I. Opie and P. Opie, ''The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren'' (Granada, 1977), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;  They were also studied in  19th century New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bolton|first1=Henry Carrington|title=The counting-out rhymes of children: their antiquity, origin, and wide distribution : a study in folk-lore|date=1888|publisher=E. Stock|location=London|pages=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children also have a tendency to recycle nursery rhymes, children's commercial songs and adult music in satirical versions. A good example is the theme from the mid-1950s [[Disney]] film ''[[Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier]]'', "[[The Ballad of Davy Crockett]]", with a tune by [[George Bruns]]; its opening lines, "Born on a mountain top in Tennessee / The greenest state in the land of the free", were endlessly satirised to make Crockett a spaceman, a parricide and even a [[Teddy Boy]].&lt;ref&gt;I. Opie and P. Opie, ''The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren'' (Granada, 1977), pp. 138–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Action songs===
Some of the most popular playground songs include actions to be done with the words. Among the most famous of these is "I'm a Little Teapot". A term from the song is now commonly used in [[cricket]] to describe a disgruntled [[Bowler (cricket)|bowler]]'s stance when a catch has been dropped. A 'teapot' involves standing with one hand on your hip in disappointment, a 'double teapot' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21012460-2722,00.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612090947/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21012460-2722,00.html |archivedate=2008-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; involves both hands on hips and a disapproving glare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/news/loss-to-england-really-hurt-mcgrath/2007/02/10/1170524339195.html|title=Loss to England really hurt: McGrath - News - Ashes Tour 06-07 - theage.com.au|website=www.theage.com.au|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929121155/http://www.theage.com.au/news/news/loss-to-england-really-hurt-mcgrath/2007/02/10/1170524339195.html|archivedate=2007-09-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Game songs===
Many children's playground and street songs are connected to particular games. These include [[clapping games]], like "[[Miss Susie]]', played in America; "A sailor went to sea" from Britain; and "Mpeewa", played in parts of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;S. E. D. Wilkins, ''Sports and games of medieval cultures''(Greenwood, 2002), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Many traditional [[Māori people|Māori]] children's games, some of them with educational applications—such as hand movement, stick and string games—were accompanied by particular songs.&lt;ref&gt;M. McLean, ''Maori Music'' (Auckland University Press, 1996), pp. 147–64.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Congo, the traditional game "A Wa Nsabwee" is played by two children synchronising hand and other movements while singing.&lt;ref&gt;T. Mukenge, ''Culture and customs of the Congo'' (Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Skipping games like [[Double Dutch (jump rope)|Double Dutch]] have been seen as important in the formation of [[hip hop]] and [[rap]] music.&lt;ref&gt;K. D. Gaunt, ''The Games Black Girls Play: Learning the Ropes from Double-Dutch to Hip-hop'' (New York University Press, 2006), pp. 158–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

If a playground song ''does'' have a character, it is usually a child present at the time of the song's performance or the child singing the song. The extreme awkwardness of relations between young boys and young girls is a common [[Motif (literature)|motif]] such as in the American song "K-I-S-S-I-N-G". "K-I-S-S-I-N-G" or "Kay Eye Ess Ess Eye En Gee" is the name of a playground song, [[skipping-rope rhyme|jump-rope rhyme]],&lt;ref name="H&amp;R"&gt;Heitzig, Lenya and Rose, Penny (2009). ''Live Relationally'', p.196. {{ISBN|978-1-4347-6748-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or taunt. It really only achieves its desired effect—[[embarrassment]]—when sung among children to a couple that is in [[puppy love]], or when two people who do not want to be associated with each other get tagged together. The embarrassment is derived from the prospect of romantic contact between a boy and a girl, usually an uncomfortable topic for children.

The song is learned by [[oral tradition]]:

{{quote|[''Name''] and [''Name'']&lt;br /&gt;sitting in a tree,&lt;br /&gt;K-I-S-S-I-N-G.&lt;br /&gt;First comes love,&lt;br /&gt;then comes marriage,&lt;br /&gt;then comes baby&lt;br /&gt;in a baby carriage!&lt;ref&gt;A variant can be found in {{cite book |last=Mansour |first=David |title=From Abba to Zoom: A Pop Culture Encyclopedia Of The Late 20th Century |year=2005 |publisher=Andrews McMeel |page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Pastime songs===
Other songs have a variety of patterns and contexts. Many of the verses used by children have an element of [[Norm (sociology)|transgression]], and a number have satirical aims. The parody of adult songs with alternative verses, such as the rewriting of "[[While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks|While shepherds watched their flocks by night]]" to "While shepherds washed their socks at night" and numerous other versions, was a prominent activity in the British playgrounds investigated by the Opies in the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;I. Opie and P. Opie, ''The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren'' (Granada, 1977), pp. 107–17.&lt;/ref&gt; With the growth of media and advertising in some countries, advertising [[jingle]]s and parodies of those jingles have become a regular feature of children's songs, including the "[[McDonald's]] song" in the United States, which played against adult desire for ordered and healthy eating.&lt;ref&gt;Simon J. Bronner, ''American children's folklore'' (August House, 1988), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Humour is a major factor in children's songs. (The nature of the English language, with its many double meanings for words, may mean that it possesses more punning songs than other cultures, although they are found in other cultures—for example, China).&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger T. Ames]], Sin-wai Chan, Mau-sang Ng, Dim Cheuk Lau, ''Interpreting culture through translation: a festschrift for D.C. Lau'' (Chinese University Press, 1991), pp. 38–9.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nonsense verse]]s and songs, like those of [[Edward Lear]] and [[Lewis Carroll]], have been a major feature of publications for children, and some of these have been absorbed by children, although many such verses seem to have been invented by children themselves.&lt;ref&gt;I. Opie and P. Opie, ''The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren'' (Granada, 1977), pp. 37–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parodies and satire===
Playground songs can be parodies of popular songs such as "[[On Top of Old Smoky]]" or "[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]" in the USA with suitably altered lyrics. The new lyrics are frequently highly derisive towards figures of authority such as teachers or involve ribald lyrical variations. [[Zero tolerance (schools)|Zero-tolerance]] rules in some schools now prevent this, although they are sometimes ignored by teachers who view the songs as harmless and clever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/playfolklore/pdf/playfolklore_issue44_2.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=28 August 2006|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060828020726/http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/playfolklore/pdf/playfolklore_issue44_2.pdf|archivedate=28 August 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Playground songs may also feature contemporary children's characters or [[child actor]]s such as [[Popeye]], [[Shirley Temple]], [[Batman]] or [[Barney &amp; Friends|Barney the Dinosaur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sdWwHbOf4oAC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112|title=The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905130407/https://books.google.com/books?id=sdWwHbOf4oAC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112|archivedate=2015-09-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such songs are usually set to common melodies (a popular Batman-themed song uses much of the chorus of "[[Jingle Bells]]") and often include subversive and crude humor; in Barney's case, schoolyard parodies of his theme song were a driving force behind a massive [[anti-Barney humor|backlash against Barney]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;''Greasy Grimy Gopher Guts: The Subversive Folklore of Childhood,'' by Josepha Sherman and T.K.F.

Occasionally the songs are used as a base for modern pop songs, "[[Circle Circle Dot Dot]]", commonly sung in American playgrounds, has been recorded as a [[Rap music|rap]] song.

==Commercial children’s music==
{{Main|Children’s music}}

[[Image:Froth Blowers Handkerchief.jpg|thumb|An [[ancient Order of Froth Blowers]] handkerchief, a humorous British charitable organisation, with the lyrics "[[The More We Get Together|The More We Are Together]]", a popular British children's song from the 1920s]]
Commercial children's music grew out of the popular music-publishing industry associated with New York's [[Tin Pan Alley]] in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Early songs included "Ten little fingers and ten little toes" by Ira Shuster and Edward G. Nelson and "[[School Days (1907 song)|School Days]]" (1907) by Gus Edwards and Will Cobb.&lt;ref&gt;E. C. Axford, ''Song Sheets to Software: A Guide to Print Music, Software, and Web Sites for Musicians'' (Scarecrow Press, 2004), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the best remembered now is "[[Teddy Bears' Picnic]]", with lyrics written by [[Jimmy Kennedy]] in 1932, although the tune, by the British composer [[John Walter Bratton]], was composed in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter van der Merwe (musicologist)|van der Merwe, Peter]], ''Roots of the Classical: The Popular Origins of Western Music'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), p. 436.&lt;/ref&gt; As recording technology developed, children's songs were soon being sold on record; in 1888, the first recorded discs (called "plates") offered for sale included [[Mother Goose]] nursery rhymes. The earliest record catalogues of several seminal firms in the recording industry—such as [[Edison Records|Edison]], [[Berliner Gramophone|Berliner]], and [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor]]—contained separate children's sections. Until the 1950s, all the major record companies produced albums for children, mostly based on popular cartoons or nursery rhymes and read by major stars of theatre or film. The role of [[Disney]] in children's cinema from the 1930s meant that it gained a unique place in the production of children's music, beginning with "Minnies Yoo Hoo" (1930).&lt;ref&gt;D. A. Jasen, ''Tin Pan Alley: An Encyclopedia of the Golden Age of American Song'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 2003), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; After the production of its first feature-length animation, ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarves]]'' (1937), with its highly successful score by [[Frank Churchill]] and Larry Morey, the mould was set for a combination of animation, fairy tale and distinctive songs that would carry through to the 1970s with songs from films such as ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (1940) and ''[[Song of the South]]'' (1946).&lt;ref&gt;D. A. Jasen, ''Tin Pan Alley: An Encyclopedia of the Golden Age of American Song'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 2003), pp. 111–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mid-twentieth century [[baby boomers]] provided a growing market for children's music. [[Woody Guthrie]], [[Pete Seeger]], and [[Ella Jenkins]] were among the politically progressive and socially conscious performers who aimed albums at children. Novelty recordings like "[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (song)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]" (a [[Montgomery Ward]] jingle that became a book and later a classic children's movie) and the fictional music group [[Alvin and the Chipmunks]] were among the most commercially successful music ventures of the time. In the 1960s, as the baby boomers matured and became more politically aware, they embraced both the substance and politics of folk ("the people's") music. [[Peter, Paul, and Mary]], [[The Limeliters]] and [[Tom Paxton]] were acclaimed folk artists of the period who wrote albums for children. In the 1970s, television programmes like ''[[Sesame Street]]'' became the dominant force in children's music. In the early 1990s, the songwriter, record producer, and performer [[Bobby Susser]] emerged with his award-winning children's songs and series, ''Bobby Susser Songs for Children'', that exemplified the use of songs to educate young children in schools and at home.&lt;ref&gt;''Educational Dealer'', August, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Disney also re-entered the market for animated musical features with ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989), from which the song "[[Under the Sea]]" won an [[Academy Award|Oscar]], becoming the first of a string of [[Academy Award|Oscar]]–winning Disney songs.&lt;ref&gt;D. A. Jasen, ''Tin Pan Alley: An Encyclopedia of the Golden Age of American Song'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 2003), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

The twenty-first century has seen an increase in the number of independent children's music artists, with acts like [[Dan Zanes]], [[Cathy Bollinger]], and [[Laurie Berkner]] getting wide exposure on cable TV channels targeted at children.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} The band [[Trout Fishing in America (band)|Trout Fishing in America]] has achieved great acclaim by continuing the tradition of merging sophisticated folk music with family-friendly lyrics,{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}, and rock-oriented acts like [[They Might Be Giants]] have released albums marketed directly to children, such as ''[[No!]],'' ''[[Here Come the ABCs]], [[Here Come the 123s]]'' and ''[[Here Comes Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/08/they-might-be-giants-here-comes-science/|title=They Might Be Giants Keeps Pop Kid-Friendly With Smart Science|last=Thill|first=Scott|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-08-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Clash of Clans''''' is a [[freemium]] [[Mobile game|mobile]] [[strategy video game]] developed and published by [[Finland|Finnish]] game developer [[Supercell (video game company)|Supercell]]. The game was released for [[iOS]] platforms on August 2, 2012, and on [[Google Play]] for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] on October 7, 2013.

The game is set in a fantasy-themed&lt;ref name="gbcoc"/&gt; [[persistent world]]&lt;ref name="commto"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Uysal |first=Ahmet |date=9 March 2016 |title=Commitment to multiplayer online games: An investment model approach |journal=Computers in Human Behavior |volume=61 |issue=August 2016 |pages=357–363 |id= |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563216301959 |accessdate=3 July 2017 |quote= |doi=10.1016/j.chb.2016.03.028}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the player is a chief of a village. ''Clash of Clans'' tasks players to build their own town using the resources gained from attacking other players through the game's fighting features. The main resources are gold, elixir and dark elixir. Players can conjoin to create clans, groups of up to fifty people who can then partake in Clan Wars together, donate and receive troops, and talk with each other.

''Clash of Clans'' was released to positive reviews, garnering high ratings from many critics.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Clash of Clans gameplay.jpg|thumb|260px|A replay of gameplay, where a player is attacking another player's village]]
''Clash of Clans'' is an online multiplayer game in which players form communities, called clans, train troops, and attack other players to earn resources. There are four currencies or resources in the game.&lt;ref name="gbcoc"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.giantbomb.com/clash-of-clans/3030-40108/ |title=Clash of Clans |author=andalian |date=26 June 2016 |work=Giant Bomb |publisher=BS Interactive Inc |accessdate=3 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gold and elixir can be used to build and reload defenses that protect the player from other players' attacks. Elixir and dark elixir are also used to train and upgrade troops and spells.  Gems are the premium currency.&lt;ref name="gbcoc"/&gt; Attacks are rated on a three star scale and have a maximum timed length of three minutes.&lt;ref name="gbcoc"/&gt;

The game also features a pseudo-single player campaign in which the player can attack a series of fortified goblin villages&lt;ref name="tgcoc"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://downloads.tomsguide.com/Clash-of-Clans,0301-52982.html |title=Download Clash of Clans 8.116.2 for Android |work=Editors Review |publisher=Purch |accessdate=3 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and earn gold, elixir and dark elixir (levels 51-75 only). The game starts with two Builders, but the player can have up to five builders through buying them with gems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://clashofclans.com/clash-basics|title=Official Website|last=|first=|date=|website=Clash of Clans|publisher=|access-date=August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buildings===
To earn and store gold and elixir, players must build gold mines and gold storages and elixir collectors and elixir storages, respectively. Elixir is used to train new troops, carry out research in the laboratory to upgrade troops, to re-load X-Bows (available from Town Hall 9), and to build and upgrade certain buildings, mostly pertaining to buildings used in attacking another player's base. Gold is used to build defensive buildings and to upgrade the town hall, which allows access to more buildings and higher levels for existing buildings. At Town Hall 7, dark elixir becomes available; this type of elixir is used to train and upgrade dark elixir troops and heroes, create dark spells (available from Town Hall 8), and fuel the Inferno Tower, a defensive building that is available only at Town Hall 10. The Eagle Artillery, a defensive building only available at Town Hall 11, is fueled by elixir. Town Hall 11 also provides access to a new hero - The Grand Warden. It is the only hero born out of elixir. To earn and store dark elixir, players must build dark elixir drills and dark elixir storages. Town Hall 12 gets a defensive building called Giga Tesla, which is already built-in after the Town Hall 12 upgrade.&lt;ref name="Pocket"/&gt;

There are a number of buildings available to the player to defend their village, including cannons, mortars, bombs, teslas, traps, archer towers, wizard towers, inferno towers and eagle artilleries. Players can also build walls, which can be upgraded as a player's town hall level increases.&lt;ref name="Pocket"/&gt;&lt;ref name="148Apps"/&gt;

===Troops and spells===
The game has two kinds of barracks (barracks and dark barracks) and two kinds of spell factories (spell factory and dark spell factory). The barracks create troops using elixir whereas dark barracks create troops using dark elixir.

The spell factories follow the same pattern - the normal spell factory creates spells using elixir, and the dark spell factory using dark elixir. All troops and spells have different properties. As the player progresses, several new troops and spells are able to be unlocked.

Also, the workshop, a building which houses clan troops called the Siege Machine &amp; Battle Blimp, unlocks at Town Hall 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.supercheats.com/clash-of-clans/walkthrough/unit-guide|title=Clash of Clans Units}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clashofclansguidehq.com/units-list/|title=Clash of Clans Units List &amp; Guide|date=February 18, 2014|access-date=August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://clashofclansnation.com/characters/|title=Characters|access-date=August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://clashofclans.com/clash-basics/troops|title=Official Website|last=|first=|date=|website=Clash of Clans|publisher=|access-date=August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://clashofclans.com/clash-basics/spells|title=Spells {{!}} Clash of Clans|website=Clash of Clans|access-date=August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clans and Clan Wars===
Clans are groups of players who join together to support each other, either materially (donating troops) or verbally (giving advice). Players can join clans once they rebuild the special Clan Castle building early on. A major component of the gameplay of ''Clash of Clans'' is clans facing off against one another in the "clan wars". Clan leaders and co-leaders can begin wars against other clans. Each clan is then given one "preparation day" and one "war day." When a player attacks a member of the opposing clan, they receive stars based upon the amount of destruction they cause to the opponent's community. Each player is limited to two attacks per war, and the team with the most stars at the end of the war day is declared victorious. If the two clans' number of stars are equal, then the victor is the one that has a greater percent of destruction. Players receive bonus war loot if he/she use their attacks in the war. This loot may be different on different bases and is decided by [[Supercell (video game company)|Supercell]]; the top base has the most war bonus loot and the last base has the least amount of bonus loot. If the clan wins the war, the bonus loot is fully delivered to the player but during a loss or draw one-third of the loot is delivered to the player. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://forum.supercell.net/showthread.php/232849-Clan-Wars-FAQ|title=Clan Wars FAQ |publisher=Supercell |date=April 4, 2014 | accessdate=June 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the March 2016 update, 35v35 and 45v45 were removed&lt;ref&gt;http://en.yibada.com/articles/107712/20160304/clash-of-clans-march-2016-update-major-clan-wars-matchmaking-changes-war-sizes-45v45-35v35-will-be-removed-more-emphasis-on-defensive-progress.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gottabemobile.com/clash-of-clans-update-clan-war-matchmaking-improved/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://clashtoday.com/2016/04/01/clash-of-clans-update-march-2016/&lt;/ref&gt;. The available war sizes are 50v50, 40v40, 30v30, 25v25, 20v20, 15v15, 10v10 and 5v5&lt;ref&gt;http://www.player.one/clash-clans-update-5v5-clan-wars-ai-tweak-121591&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://forum.supercell.com/showthread.php/1648168-The-official-war-search-5vs5-thread&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWk1lP3LxdM&lt;/ref&gt;. In the May 2016 update, Friendly Challenges were introduced to allow clanmates to compete amongst other clanmates, however these challenges do not provide loot or trophies and do not affect a player's army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://clashofclans.com/blog/release-notes/friendly-challenge-update|title=May 2016 Update  Clash of Clans.com|last=|first=|date=|website=Clash of Clans|publisher=|access-date=August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the October 2018 update, Clan War Leagues were introduced. Clans would fight seven other clans to advance to the next league and earn league medals by earning stars in Clan War Leagues. The clan in the group with the most stars will be promoted to a higher league, while the clans in the group with the least stars will be demoted to a lower league.

===Builder Base===
[[File:Coc attack.png|thumb|260px|A player is attacking another player's village in the builder base]]
A new update to the game on May 22, 2017 released a new game mode, known as the "Builder Base". Players can sail to a new island and create a new village, with a different set of buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://clashofclans.com/blog/news/welcome-to-the-builder-base|title=Welcome to the Builder Base!  {{!}} Clash of Clans|website=Clash of Clans|language=en|access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this mode, two players attack each other's bases simultaneously. The one with the most damage or getting more stars gets the gold, elixir, and trophies. You can only win loot from attacking three times in twelve or twenty-four hours, but can continue attacking for trophies afterwards. The player can spend gems for skip the period of time. The progress will be much faster in this base with the introduction of Clock Tower (temporarily speeds the process in the entire Builder Base) and Gem Mine (spawns gems at a very slow rate). The update also introduced a new hero, the Battle Machine. It is the only hero in the game with a reusable ability named Electric Hammer. In March 2018, Builder Hall level 8 was released, which is currently the highest Builder Hall level.

===Clan games and magic items===
In December 2017, Supercell introduced the clan games, at first a one-off event where clan members could work together to complete tasks, which would then earn clan points, but there has been plans to make it a weekly event. When enough points are accumulated, a reward tier would be unlocked, and players can select one reward from each unlocked tier. This update also introduced Magic Items, which could be used to enhance certain aspects of the player's village. Magic items are obtainable as rewards from clan games and through events. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://clashofclans.com/blog/news/the-clan-games-are-on-the-way|title=Clan Games are on the way!|access-date=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://clashofclans.com/blog/news/what-are-magic-items|title=what are magic items?|access-date=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Clash of Clans'' has received generally positive reviews. The iOS version holds an aggregate score of 74 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]],&lt;ref name="MC" /&gt; and 80% on [[GameRankings]].&lt;ref name="GR" /&gt;

[[Gamezebo]]'s Leif Johnson was impressed, scoring the game 4.5 out of 5. Although he felt the gameplay was heavily skewed to encourage the player to purchase gems, he praised the addition of a single-player campaign. He concluded that "''Clash of Clans'' is a simple game, but that's more of a strength than a weakness. It's simple enough to provide quick, painless matches on an [[iPhone]] in an idle moment, and there are enough different units to choose from in the battle mode to make playing against other players endlessly rewarding. Best of all, the option to fight against [[Non-player character|NPC]] goblins gives ''Clash of Clans'' a small edge over similar strategy games that rely almost entirely on player-versus-player combat."&lt;ref name="Gamezebo"/&gt;

[[Pocket Gamer]]'s Peter Willington was equally impressed, scoring the game 9 out of 10 and giving it a "Gold Award". Reviewing the game several months after it was released for iOS devices, Willington praised the game for requiring real strategy to play. He wrote that the gameplay was built on the progression of "requiring more and more sophisticated units, asking you to strategise and really think about which elements you should focus on building within your camp." He concluded that "''Clash of Clans'' is a superb game, freemium or otherwise, with more nuance than most give it credit for. That's why it's passed the test of time since its launch and still has an active community devotedly constructing elaborate fortresses in the hope of becoming invincible."&lt;ref name="Pocket"/&gt;

148App's Rob Rich scored the game 3.5 out of 5, writing "It's great to play an online freemium game that doesn't shy away from the single-player experience but also offers up some honest-to-goodness direct interaction, which is a very rare combination these days. It probably won't warm the hearts of any haters out there, but it does give genre fans something with a bit more action and strategy than they might be used to."&lt;ref name="148Apps"/&gt;  Tom's Guide enjoyed the player interaction.&lt;ref name="tgcoc"/&gt;

Modojo's John Bedford was less impressed, scoring the game 3 out of 5. He was critical of freemium gaming in general, writing "The novelty hasn't just worn off this particular style of greedy gaming, it's shriveled up and condensed itself into an infinitely dense singularity of self-loathing." Of the game itself, he concluded, "This is a game that follows in the footsteps of no small number of titles that have made feverish demands on our wallets in exchange for just a slightly thicker slice of the gameplay. It's possible you have an unending appetite for these [[micromanagement]] titles, in which case we recommend getting heartily stuck into Supercell's latest game. While ''Clash of Clans'' brings something new to accompany its competent but unexceptional empire gameplay, for most of us it'll be a case of too little, too late."&lt;ref name="Modojo"/&gt;

[[File:Digby County (18178365406).jpg|thumb|A quilting bee is a form of communal work.]]
'''Communal work''' is a gathering for mutually accomplishing a task or for communal [[fundraising]], for example through a knitting bee. Communal work was more common in the past, when it provided manual labour to others, especially for major projects they couldn't achieve on their own, for example in [[barn raising]], log rolling, [[subbotnik]]s, and other bees of various kinds. They are less common in today's more individualistic cultures, where there is less reliance on others than in preindustrial agricultural and hunterer-gatherer societies.  

In more modern societies, the word "bee" has also been used for some time already for other social gatherings without communal work, for example for competitions such as a [[spelling bee]].

Especially in the past, major jobs, such as clearing a field of timber or raising a barn, needed many workers. It was often both a social and utilitarian event. Jobs like corn husking or [[sewing]] could be done as a group to allow socializing during an otherwise tedious chore. Such gatherings often included refreshments and entertainment. Different words have been used to describe such gatherings.

==Bee==
===History===
This use of the word ''bee'' is common in literature describing colonial North America. It was, and continues to be, commonly used in Australia also, most often as "working bee".&lt;ref&gt;The Australian [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/indigenous/bosses-roll-up-for-tony-abbotts-working-bee/story-fn9hm1pm-1226447875028 Bosses roll up for Tony Abbott's working bee August 11, 2012] Retrieved 3 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-01-15/brisbane-working-bee-hits-streets/1906214 |title=Brisbane working bee hits streets |website=abc.net.au |date=January 15, 2011 |accessdate=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In literature===
Uses in literature include:

*''There was a '''bee''' to-day for making a road up to the church.''{{snd}} [[Anne Langton]]
*''The cellar … was dug by a '''bee''' in a single day.''{{snd}} S. G. Goodrich
*''When one of the pioneers had chopped down timber and got it in shape, he would make a '''logging bee''', get two or three gallons of New England Rum, and the next day the logs were in great heaps. ... after a while there was a carding and jutting mill started where people got their wool made into rolls, when the women spun and wove it. Sometimes the women would have '''spinning bees'''. They would put rolls among their neighbors and on a certain day they would all bring in their yarn and at night the boys would come with their fiddles for a dance. ... He never took a salary, had a farm of 80 acres [324,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;] and the church helped him get his wood (cut and drawn by a '''bee'''), and also his hay.''{{snd}} James Slocum
*''"I am in a regular quandary," said the mistress of the house, when the meal was about half over. Mr. Van Brunt looked up for an instant, and asked, "What about?"  "Why, how I am ever going to do to get those apples and sausage-meat done. If I go to doing 'em myself I shall about get through by spring."  "Why don't you make a '''bee'''?" said Mr. Van Brunt.''{{snd}} {{cite book|author=[[Susan Warner]]|title=The wide, wide world|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IFVOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA277|year=1851|publisher=Putnam|page=277}}

===Derivation===
Because the word describes people working together in a social group, a common [[false etymology]] is that the term derives from the [[bee|insect]] of the same name and similar social behavior. According to etymological research recorded in dictionaries, the word probably comes from dialectal ''been'' or ''bean'' (meaning "help given by neighbors"), which came from [[Middle English]] ''bene'' (meaning "prayer", "boon" and "extra service by a tenant to his lord")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Dictionary.com |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bee?s=t |title=Bee |accessdate=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bee%5B3%5D |title=Definition of BEE |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In specific cultures==

===Africa===
====East Africa====
[[Harambee]] ({{IPA-sw|haramˈbeː|Swahili:}}) is an [[East Africa]]n ([[Kenya]]n, [[Tanzania]]n and [[Uganda]]n) tradition of community self-help events, e.g. [[fundraising]] or development activities. ''Harambee'' literally means "all pull together" in [[Swahili language|Swahili]], and is also the official [[List of national mottos|motto]] of Kenya and appears on its [[Coat of arms of Kenya|coat of arms]].

====Ethiopia====
[[Ethiopia]] [[Debo]] To build a house, or a farm. Each contributes according to one's ability. Especially indispensable for elderly and widows who do not have a strong man to support.   

====Sudan====
'''Naffīr''' ({{lang|ar|'''نفير'''}}) is an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word used in parts of [[Sudan]] (including [[Kordofan]], [[Darfur]], parts of the [[Nuba mountains]] and [[Kassala]]) to describe particular types of communal work undertakings. ''Naffīr'' has been described as including a group recruited through family networks, in-laws and village neighbors for some particular purpose, which then disbands when that purpose is fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Manger |first1=Leif O. |year=1987 |title=Communal Labour in the Sudan |volume= |issue= |page=7 |publisher=University of Bergen |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative, more recent, definition describes ''naffīr'' as "to bring someone together from the neighborhood or community to carry out a certain project, such as building a house or providing help during the harvest season."&lt;ref&gt;'Conceptual analysis of volunteer', 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The word may be related to the [[standard Arabic]] word ''nafr'' (نفر) which describes a band, party, group or troop, typically mobilized for war. In standard Arabic, a ''naffīr āmm'' (نفير عام) refers to a general call to arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wehr |first=Hans |title=A Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic, Arabic - English |url= |accessdate= |year= |publisher= Librarie Du Liban. |location=Beirut |isbn= |page= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Naffīr'' has also been used in a military context in Sudan. For example, the term was used to refer to the ''an-Naffīr ash-Sha'abī'' or "People's Militias" that operated in the central Nuba Mountains region in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kevlihan |first1=Rob |year=2005 |title=Developing Connectors in Humanitarian Emergencies: Is it possible in Sudan? |journal=Humanitarian Exchange |volume=30 |issue= |publisher= |doi= |url=http://www.reliefweb.int/library/documents/2005/odihpn-gen-30jun.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
====Southeast Asia====
'''Gotong-royong'''  is a conception of sociality familiar to large parts of [[Indonesia]], [[Singapore]], [[Brunei]] and [[Malaysia]]. The phrase has been translated into English in many ways, most of which hearken to the conception of reciprocity or [[mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]]. For [[M. Nasroen]], ''gotong royong'' forms one of the core tenets of Indonesian philosophy. Paul Michael Taylor and Lorraine V. Aragon state that "''gotong royong'' [is] cooperation among many people to attain a shared goal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Paul Michael |last2=Aragon |first2=Lorraine V |title=Beyond the Java Sea: Art of Indonesia's Outer Islands |url= |accessdate= |year=1991 |publisher=Abrams |location= |isbn=0-8109-3112-5 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Background=====
In a 1983 essay [[Clifford Geertz]] points to the importance of ''gotong royong'' in Indonesian life:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
An enormous inventory of highly specific and often quite intricate institutions for effecting the cooperation in work, politics, and personal relations alike, vaguely gathered under culturally charged and fairly well indefinable value-images--''rukun'' ("mutual adjustment"), ''gotong royong'' ("joint bearing of burdens"), ''tolong-menolong'' ("reciprocal assistance")--governs social interaction with a force as sovereign as it is subdued.&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, Clifford. "Local Knowledge: Fact and Law in Comparative Perspective," pp. 167–234 in Geertz ''Local Knowledge: Further Essays in Interpretive Anthropology,'' NY: Basic Books. 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Anthropologist Robert A. Hahn writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Javanese culture is stratified by social class and by level of adherence to Islam. ...Traditional Javanese culture does not emphasize material wealth. ...There is respect for those who contribute to the general village welfare over personal gain. And the spirit of ''gotong royong,'' or volunteerism, is promoted as a cultural value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hahn |first=Robert A. |title=Anthropology in Public Health: Bridging Differences in Culture and Society |url= |accessdate= |year=1999 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, UK |isbn= |page= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Gotong royong'' has long functioned as the scale of the village, as a moral conception of the political economy. However, as the political economy became more privatized, capitalistic, and individualistic, ''gotong royong'' has probably waned.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Pottier records the impact of the [[Green Revolution]] in Java:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Before the GR, 'Java' had relatively 'open' markets, in which many local people were rewarded in kind. With the GR, rural labour markets began to foster 'exclusionary practices'... This resulted in a general loss of rights, especially secure harvesting rights within a context of mutual cooperation, known as ''gotong royong.''"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Citing [[Ann Laura Stoler]]'s ethnography from the 1970s, Pottier writes that cash was replacing exchange, that old patron-client ties were breaking, and that social relations were becoming characterized more by employer-employee qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pottier |first=Johan |title=Anthropology of Food: The Social Dynamics of Food Security |url= |accessdate= |year=1999 |publisher=Blackwell |location=Oxford, UK |isbn= |page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Political appropriation=====
For Prime Minister [[Muhammad Natsir]], ''gotong royong'' was an ethical principle of sociality, in marked contrast to both the "unchecked" feudalism of the West, and the social [[anomie]] of [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Natsir, Muhammad. "The Indonesian Revolution." In Kurzman, Charles ''Liberal Islam: A Sourcebook'', p. 62. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideas of reciprocity, ancient and deeply enmeshed aspects of ''[[kampung]]'' morality, were seized upon by [[postcolonial]] politicians. John Sidel writes: "Ironically, national-level politicians drew on " village conceptions of [[adat]] and gotong royong. They drew on notions "of traditional community to justify new forms of authoritarian rule." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sidel |first=John Thayer |title=Riots, Pogroms, Jihad: Religious Violence in Indonesia |url= |accessdate= |year=2006 |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, NY |isbn= |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the presidency of [[Sukarno]], the idea of ''gotong royong'' was officially elevated to a central tenet of Indonesian life. For Sukarno, the new nation was to be synonymous with ''gotong royong''. He said that the ''[[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]]'' could be reduced to the idea of ''gotong royong''. On June 1, 1945, Sukarno said of the Pancasila:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The first two principles, nationalism and internationalism, can be pressed to one, which I used to call 'socionationalism.' Similarly with democracy 'which is not the democracy of the West' together with social justice for all can be pressed down to one, and called socio democracy. Finally{{snd}} belief in God. 'And so what originally was five has become three: socio nationalism, socio democracy, and belief in God.' 'If I press down five to get three, and three to get one, then I have a genuine Indonesian term{{snd}} GOTONG ROYONG [mutual co-operation]. The state of Indonesia which we are to establish should be a state of mutual co-operation. How fine that is ! A Gotong Royong state!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antenna.nl/~fwillems/eng/ic/pki/sal/salim.html |title=BUNG KARNO: 6 JUNE - 21 JUNE |publisher=Antenna |accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In 1960, Sukarno dissolved the elected parliament and implemented the [[People's Representative Council#Guided Democracy|''Gotong Royong'' Parliament]]. Governor of [[Jakarta]], [[Ali Sadikin]], spoke of a desire to reinvigorate urban areas with village sociality, with ''gotong royong''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kusno |first=Abidin |title=Behind the Postcolonial: Architecture, Urban Space and Political Cultures |url= |accessdate= |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge |location=NY |isbn= |page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suharto's New Order was characterized by much discourse about tradition. During the New Order, Siskamling harnessed the idea of gotong royong. By the 1990s, if not sooner, ''gotong royong'' had been "fossilized" by New Order sloganeering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=Benedict |authorlink=Benedict Anderson |title=Language and Power: Exploring Political Cultures in Indonesia |url= |accessdate= |year=1990 |publisher=Cornell UP |location=Ithaca, NY |isbn= |page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the presidency of [[Megawati]], the [[Mutual Assistance Cabinet|Gotong Royong Cabinet]] was implemented. It lasted from 2001 to 2004.

====Philippines====
[[File:Bayanihan 2.JPG|thumb|Members of the community volunteering to move a house to new location. Though no longer commonplace, this method of moving houses has become a traditional symbol for the concept of ''bayanihan''.]]
'''Bayanihan''' (pronounced {{IPA-tl|ˌbajɐˈniːhan|}}) is a [[Filipino language|Filipino]] term taken from the word ''bayan'', referring to a nation, country, town or community. The whole term ''bayanihan'' refers to a spirit of communal unity or effort to achieve a particular objective.

=====Etymology=====
The origin of the term ''bayanihan'' can be traced from a common tradition in [[Philippines|Philippine]] towns where community members volunteer to help a family move to a new place by volunteering to transport the house to a specific location. The process involves literally carrying the house to its new location. This is done by putting bamboo poles forming a strong frame to lift the stilts from the ground and carrying the whole house with the men positioned at the ends of each pole. The tradition also features a small [[festival|fiesta]] hosted by the family to express gratitude to the volunteers.

=====Usage=====
In society, ''bayanihan'' has been adopted as a term to refer to a local civil effort to resolve national issues. One of the first groups to use the term is the [[Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company]] which travels to countries to perform traditional folk dances of the country with the objective of promoting Philippine culture. The concept is related to ''damayán'' ("to help one another").

In computing, the term ''bayanihan'' has evolved into many meanings and incorporated as [[codename]]s to projects that depict the spirit of cooperative effort involving a community of members. An example of these projects is the Bayanihan Linux project which is a Philippines-based desktop-focused Linux distribution.

In ethnic newspapers, ''Bayanihan News'' is the name of community newspaper for the Philippine community in Australia. It is in English and in Filipino with regular news and articles on Philippine current events and history. It was established in October 1998 in Sydney, Australia.

====Turkey====
'''Imece''' is a name given for a traditional [[Turkish people|Turkish]] village-scale [[collaboration]]. For example, if a couple is getting married, villagers participate in the overall organization of the ceremony including but not limited to preparation of the celebration venue, food, building and settlement of the new house for the newly weds. Tasks are often distributed according to expertise and has no central authority to govern activities.

===Europe===
====Finland &amp; the Baltics====
[[Image:Talkoot Ylimuonio.JPG|thumb|250px|A tent is being raised in a talkoot for midsummer in [[Muonio|Ylimuonio]] in 2005.]]
'''Talkoot''' (from [[finnish language|Finnish]]: ''talkoo'', almost always used in plural, ''talkoot'') is a Finnish expression for a gathering of friends and neighbors organized to accomplish a task. The word is [[loanword|borrowed]] into [[Finland Swedish]] as ''talko''&lt;ref&gt;Mikael Reuter: [http://www.kotus.fi/?l=sv&amp;=1551 ''En/ett iögonfallande talko?''] {{sv}}. Retrieved: 2010-10-04.&lt;/ref&gt; but is unknown to most [[Sweden|Swedes]]. However, cognate terms and in approximately the same context are used in [[Estonia]] (talgu(d)),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eki.ee/dict/ekss/index.cgi?Q=talgu&amp;F=M|title=[EKSS] "Eesti keele seletav sõnaraamat"|work=eki.ee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latvia (noun ''talka'', verb ''talkot''), and Lithuania (noun ''talka'', verb ''talkauti''). It is the cultural equivalent of communal work in a village community, although adapted to the conditions of [[Finland]], where most families traditionally lived in isolated farms often miles away from the nearest village.

A ''talkoot'' is by definition voluntary, and the work is unpaid. The voluntary nature might be imaginary due to [[social pressure]], especially in small communities, and one's honour and reputation may be severely damaged by non-attendance or laziness. The task of the ''talkoot'' may be something that is a common concern for the good of the group, or it may be to help someone with a task that exceeds his or her own capacity. For instance, elderly neighbours or relatives can need help if their house or garden is damaged by a storm, or siblings can agree to arrange a party for a parent's special birthday as a ''talkoot''.

Typically, club houses, landings, churches, and parish halls can be repaired through a ''talkoot'', or environmental tasks for the neighborhood are undertaken. The parents of pre-school children may gather to improve the playground, or the tenants of a tenement house may arrange a ''talkoot'' to put their garden in order for the summer or winter. A person unable to contribute with actual work may contribute food for the ''talkoot'' party, or act as a baby-sitter. When a ''talkoot'' is for the benefit of an individual, he or she is the host of the talkoot party and is obliged to offer as much food and drink as possible.

====Hungary====
'''Kaláka''' (ˈkɒlaːkɒ) is the [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] word for working together for a common goal. This can be building a house or doing agricultural activities together, or any other communal work on a volunteer basis. 

====Ireland====
'''Meitheal''' ({{IPA-ga|ˈmɛhəl}}) is the [[Irish language|Irish]] word for a work team, gang, or party and denotes the co-operative labour system in [[Ireland]] where groups of neighbours help each other in turn with farming work such as harvesting crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.englishirishdictionary.com/dictionary?language=irish&amp;word=meitheal |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710193305/http://www.englishirishdictionary.com/dictionary?language=irish&amp;word=meitheal |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 July 2011 |title=Meitheal |work=Irish Dictionary Online |publisher=englishirishdictionary.com |accessdate=28 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is used in various writings of Irish language authors. It can convey the idea of community spirit in which neighbours respond to each other's needs. In modern use for example, a meitheal could be a party of neighbours and friends invited to help decorate a house in exchange for food and drink, or in [[scouting]], where volunteer campsite wardens maintain campsites around Ireland.

====Norway====
'''Dugnad''' is a Norwegian term for voluntary work done together with other people.&lt;ref Name="Brox"&gt;{{cite book |title=The political economy of rural development: modernisation without centralisation? |author1=Ottar Brox |author2=John M. Bryden |author3=Robert Storey |year=2006 |publisher=Eburon Uitgeverij B.V |isbn=90-5972-086-5| page=79 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aA2HHUYAZlwC}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's a very core phenomenon for Norwegians and the word was voted as the Norwegian word of the year 2004 in the TV programme [[Typisk norsk|«Typisk Norsk»]] ("Typical Norwegian"). Participation in a ''dugnad'' is often followed by a common meal, served by the host.

In urban areas, the ''dugnad'' is most commonly identified with outdoor spring cleaning and gardening in housing co-operatives. ''Dugnader'', Dugnads, are also a big phenomenon in kindergartens and elementary schools to make the area nice, clean and safe and to do decorating etc. such as painting and other types of maintenance. ''Dugnader'' occur more widely in remote and rural areas. Neighbours sometime participate during house or garage building, and organizations (such as kindergartens or non-profit organisations) may arrange annual ''dugnader''.

The Norwegian word "Dugnadsånd" is translatable to the spirit of will to work together for a better community. Many Norwegians will describe this as a typical Norwegian thing to have.

====Serbia====
Moba (Serbian: моба) is an old Serbian tradition of communal self-help in villages. It was a request for help in labor-intensive activities, like harvesting wheat, building a church or repairing village roads.

Work was entirely voluntary and no compensation, except possibly meals for workers, was expected.

===North America===
====Cherokee====
'''Gadugi''' (Cherokee:ᎦᏚᎩ) is a term used in the [[Cherokee language]] which means "working together"&lt;ref name="Gadugi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gadugisafecenter.org/mission.html |title=GaDuGi SafeCenter's Mission Statement and Vision Statement |publisher=GaDuGi SafeCenter |accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "cooperative labor" within a community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Feeling |first=Durbin |title=Cherokee-English Dictionary |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZwloAAAAMAAJ |year=1975 |publisher=Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma |location= |isbn= |page=73 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the word referred to a labor gang of men and/or women working together for projects such as harvesting crops or tending to gardens of elderly or infirm tribal members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cherokee.org/AboutTheNation/History/Facts/24462/Information.aspx |title=The Origin of Gadugi |last1=Dunaway |first1=Wilma |publisher=Cherokee Nation |accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''Gadugi'' was derived from the [[Cherokee]] word for "bread", which is ''Gadu''.

In recent years the [[Cherokee Nation]] tribal government has promoted the concept of ''Gadugi.'' The GaDuGi Health Center is a tribally run clinic in [[Tahlequah, Oklahoma]], the capital of the Cherokee Nation. The concept is becoming more widely known. In Lawrence, Kansas, in 2004 the [[rape crisis center]]  affiliated with the [[University of Kansas]], adopted the name, the Gadugi Safe Center, for its programs to aid all people affected by sexual violence.&lt;ref name="Gadugi"/&gt;

Gadugi is the name of a font included with Microsoft Windows 8 that includes support for the Cherokee language along with other languages of the Americas such as [[Inuktitut]].

===Latin America===
====Quechua====
{{Main|Minka (communal work)}}
'''Mink'a''' or '''minka''' ([[Quechua language|Quechua]]&lt;ref&gt;Teofilo Laime Ajacopa, Diccionario Bilingüe Iskay simipi yuyayk'ancha, La Paz, 2007 (Quechua-Spanish dictionary)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diccionario Quechua - Español - Quechua, Academía Mayor de la Lengua Quechua, Gobierno Regional Cusco, Cusco 2005 (Quechua-Spanish dictionary)&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Kichwa language|Kichwa]],&lt;ref&gt;Fabián Potosí C. et al., Ministerio de Educación del Ecuador: Kichwa Yachakukkunapa Shimiyuk Kamu, Runa Shimi - Mishu Shimi, Mishu Shimi - Runa Shimi. Quito (DINEIB, Ecuador) 2009. (Kichwa-Spanish dictionary)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spanish language|Hispanicized]] ''minca, minga'') is a type of traditional communal work in the [[Andes]] in favor of the whole community ''([[ayllu]])''. Participants are traditionally paid in kind. Mink'a is still practiced in [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] communities in [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]], [[Bolivia]], and [[Chile]], especially among the [[Quechua people|Quechua]] and the [[Aymara people|Aymara]].
==== Chile ====
In rural southern Chile, labor reciprocity and communal work remained common through the twentieth century and into the twenty-first, particularly in rural communities on the [[Archipelago of Chiloé]].&lt;ref&gt;Daughters, Anton. "Solidarity and Resistance on the Island of Llingua." ''Anthropology Now'' 7:1 pp.1-11 (April 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Referred to as "mingas," the practice can be traced to pre-contact Mapuche and Huilliche traditions of communal labor.&lt;ref&gt;Cárdenas Álvarez, Renato, Daniel Montiel Vera, and Catherine Grace Hall. ''Los Chonos y los Veliche de Chiloé'' (Santiago, Chile: Ediciones Olimpho) 1991&lt;/ref&gt; In Chiloé, mingas took the form either of ''días cambiados'' (tit for tat exchanges of labor between neighbors) or large-scale work parties hosted by a particular family, accompanied by food and drink, and often lasting several days.&lt;ref&gt;Daughters, Anton. "Southern Chile's Archipelago of Chiloé: Shifting Identities in a New Economy." ''Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Anthropology'' 21:2 pp.317.335 (July 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Most agricultural work and community construction projects were done by way of mingas. The ''tiradura de casa'' ("house pull") involved moving a house from one location to another.

'''Panama'''

In rural Panama, especially in the [[Azuero Peninsula|Azuero]] peninsula region and its diaspora, it is common to hold a 'junta' party&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://folklore.panamatipico.com/english/articulo.php?articulo=85|title=Folklore.PanamaTipico.com (English)|website=folklore.panamatipico.com|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a communal labor event. Most commonly these events are used to harvest rice, clear brush with machetes, or to build houses. Workers generally work without compensation but are provided with meals and often alcoholic beverages such as fermented [[Fermented beverage|chicha fuerte]] and [[Seco Herrerano|seco]].

[[File:PersonalStorageDevices.agr.jpg|thumb|Various electronic storage devices]]
[[File:EdisonPhonograph.jpg|thumb|Edison cylinder phonograph c. 1899. The phonograph cylinder is a [[storage medium]]. The phonograph may be considered a storage device.]]

'''Data storage''' is the recording (storing) of [[information]] ([[data]]) in a '''storage medium'''. [[DNA]] and [[RNA]], [[handwriting]], [[phonograph]]ic recording, [[magnetic tape]], and [[optical disc]]s are all examples of storage media. Recording is accomplished by virtually any form of [[energy]]. Electronic data storage requires electrical power to store and retrieve data. 

Data storage in a digital, [[machine-readable medium]] is sometimes called ''[[digital data]]''. [[Computer data storage]] is one of the core functions of a [[general purpose computer]]. [[Electronic document]]s can be stored in much less space than paper [[document]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.seas.gwu.edu/~shmuel/WORK/Differences/Chapter%203%20-%20Sources.pdf |title=The Difference between Electronic and Paper Documents|last=Rotenstreich|first=Shmuel|website=Seas.GWU.edu|publisher=The George Washington University|access-date=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barcode]]s and [[magnetic ink character recognition]] (MICR) are two ways of recording [[machine-readable data]] on paper.

==Recording media==&lt;!--Recording medium, record medium and others redirect here--&gt;
A recording medium is a physical material that holds information. Newly created information is distributed and can be stored in four storage media–print, film, magnetic, and optical–and seen or heard in four information flows–telephone, radio and TV, and the Internet&lt;ref name="Berk2003"&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://groups.ischool.berkeley.edu/archive/how-much-info-2003/
 |title=HOW MUCH INFORMATION 2003?
 |last1=Lyman  |first1=Peter
 |last2=Varian |first2=Hal R.
 |date=October 23, 2003
 |publisher=UC Berkeley, School of Information Management and Systems
 |access-date=November 25, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being observed directly.  Digital information is stored on [[electronic media]] in many different [[recording format]]s.

With [[electronic media]], the data and the recording media are sometimes referred to as "software" despite the more common use of the word to describe [[software|computer software]]. With ([[Media (arts)|traditional art]]) static media, [[List of artistic media|art materials]] such as [[crayon]]s may be considered both equipment and medium as the wax, charcoal or chalk material from the equipment becomes part of the surface of the medium.

Some recording media may be temporary either by design or by nature. [[Volatile organic compound]]s may be used to [[Sustainable design|preserve the environment]] or to purposely make data expire over time.  Data such as [[smoke signal]]s or [[skywriting]] are temporary by nature. Depending on the volatility, a [[gas]] (e.g. [[atmosphere]], [[smoke]]) or a liquid surface such as a [[lake]] would be considered a temporary recording medium if at all.

==Global capacity, digitization, and trends==
A 2003 UC Berkeley report estimated that about five [[exabyte]]s of new information were produced in 2002, and that 92% of this data was stored on hard disk drives. This was about twice the data produced in 2000. The amount of data transmitted over telecommunication systems in 2002 was nearly 18 exabytes—three and a half times more than was recorded on non-volatile storage. Telephone calls constituted 98% of the telecommunicated information in 2002. The researchers' highest estimate for the growth rate of newly stored information (uncompressed) was more than 30% per year.

It has been estimated{{by whom|date=April 2018}} that the year 2002 was the beginning of the digital age for information storage: an age in which more information is stored on digital storage devices than on analog storage devices.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"/&gt; In 1986, approximately 1% of the world's capacity to store information was in digital format; this grew to 3% by 1993, to 25% by 2000, and to 97% by 2007. These figures correspond to less than three [[Data compression|compressed]] exabytes in 1986, and 295 compressed exabytes in 2007.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"/&gt; The quantity of digital storage doubled roughly every three years.&lt;ref name="Hilbertvideo2011"/&gt;

In a more limited study, the [[International Data Corporation]] estimated that the total amount of digital data in 2007 was 281 exabytes, and that the total amount of digital data produced exceeded the global storage capacity for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Diverse and Exploding Digital Universe|url=https://techliberation.com/2008/03/14/idcs-diverse-exploding-digital-universe-report/|accessdate=2008-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in 2011 estimated that the world's technological capacity to store information in analog and digital devices grew from less than three (optimally compressed) exabytes in 1986, to 295 (optimally compressed) [[exabyte]]s in 2007,&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hilbert | first1 = Martin | last2 = López | first2 = Priscila | year = 2011 | title = The World's Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 332 | issue = 6025| pages = 60–65 | doi=10.1126/science.1200970 | pmid=21310967| bibcode = 2011Sci...332...60H }}; free access to the article through here: martinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html&lt;/ref&gt; and doubles roughly every three years.&lt;ref name="Hilbertvideo2011"&gt;[http://ideas.economist.com/video/giant-sifting-sound-0 "video animation on The World’s Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information from 1986 to 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118072720/http://ideas.economist.com/video/giant-sifting-sound-0 |date=2012-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''film director''' is a person who directs the making of a [[film]]. A film director controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects and visualizes the [[screenplay]] (or script) while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that [[Goal|vision]]. The director has a key role in choosing the [[cast member]]s, production design, and the creative aspects of [[filmmaking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everydaylife.globalpost.com/average-film-director-salary-per-movie-7732.html|title=The Average Film Director Salary Per Movie|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[European Union law]], the director is viewed as the [[auteur theory|author]] of the film.&lt;ref name="Kamina2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pascal Kamina|title=Film Copyright in the European Union|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PqJYG9ihusC&amp;pg=PA153|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-43338-9|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film director gives direction to the cast and crew and creates an overall vision through which a film eventually becomes realized, or noticed. Directors need to be able to mediate differences in creative visions and stay within the boundaries of the film's [[budget]].

There are many pathways to becoming a film director. Some film directors started as [[screenwriter]]s, [[cinematographer]]s, [[film editor]]s or actors. Other film directors have attended a film school. Directors use different approaches. Some [[Outline (list)|outline]] a general plotline and let the actors improvise dialogue, while others control every aspect, and demand that the actors and crew follow instructions precisely. Some directors also write their own screenplays or collaborate on screenplays with long-standing writing partners. Some directors edit or appear in their films, or compose the music score for their films.&lt;ref name="career"&gt;{{cite web|title=TV or film director|url=https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/job-profiles/tv-or-film-director|website=National Careers Service|publisher=British Government|accessdate=May 10, 2017|location=[[United Kingdom]]|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibility==
[[File:LondonSmog.jpg|thumb|upright|The film director gives last minute direction to the cast and crew, while filming a [[costume drama]] on location in [[London]].]]
A film director's task is to envisage a way to translate a [[screenplay]] into a fully formed film, and then to realize this vision.&lt;ref name="Film schools"&gt;{{cite web|title=Career Profile Film Director|url=http://filmschools.com/resources/los-angeles-career-profile-film-directorl|accessdate=March 3, 2013}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; To do this, they oversee the artistic and technical elements of film production.&lt;ref name="career"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Media College"&gt;{{cite web |title=Employment Film Director|url=http://www.mediacollege.com/employment/film/director.html|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This entails organizing the [[film crew]] in such a way to achieve their vision of the film.&lt;ref name="Studentpulse"&gt;{{cite web |title=Career snapshot|url=http://www.studentpulse.com/articles/196/career-snapshot-the-film-director-a-human-lens|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=They must work with producers, writers, cast members, crew members, designers and other professionals in order to implement that vision|url=http://www.academicinvest.com/arts-careers/film-studies-careers/film-director-career-guide|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requires skills of group leadership, as well as the ability to maintain a singular focus even in the stressful, fast-paced environment of a film set.&lt;ref name="Career Centre"&gt;{{cite web|title=A film director needs...|url=http://www.careercentre.dtwd.wa.gov.au/occupations/Pages/director-film-television-radio-or-stage.aspx|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it is necessary to have an artistic eye to frame shots and to give precise feedback to cast and crew,&lt;ref name="Diploma Guide"&gt;{{cite web |title=Film Director Career|url=http://diplomaguide.com/articles/Film_Director_Career_Summary.html|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus, excellent communication skills are a must.&lt;ref name="National Career Service"&gt;{{cite web|title=Job Profile|url=https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/planning/jobprofiles/Pages/tvorfilmdirector.aspx|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the film director depends on the successful cooperation of many different creative individuals with possibly strongly contradicting artistic ideals and visions, he or she also needs to possess conflict resolution skills in order to mediate whenever necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=You have to be a diplomat. You have to marshal a whole load of creative people, who often don't get on with each other, and your job is to stop things turning into a bun-fight. |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/student/career-planning/getting-job/i-want-your-job-film-director-480500.html|accessdate = March 3, 2013 | location=London |work=The Independent |first=Alex |last=McRae |date=June 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the director ensures that all individuals involved in the film production are working towards an identical vision for the completed film.&lt;ref name="Studentpulse"/&gt; The set of varying challenges he or she has to tackle has been described as "a multi-dimensional jigsaw puzzle with egos and weather thrown in for good measure".&lt;ref name="Directors UK"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Director?|url=http://www.directors.uk.com/about-us/what-director|accessdate=March 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117082526/http://www.directors.uk.com/about-us/what-director|archive-date=2013-01-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It adds to the pressure that the success of a film can influence when and how they will work again, if at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=directors work under a lot of pressure, and most are under constant stress to find their next job.|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/entertainment-and-sports/producers-and-directors.htm|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the sole superiors of the director are the [[Film producer|producer(s)]] and the studio that is financing the film.&lt;ref name="Film schools"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Education Portal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Career as a film director|url=http://education-portal.com/career_as_a_film_director.html|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of a director differs from producers in that producers typically manage the logistics and business operations of the production, whereas the director is tasked with making creative decisions. The director must work within the restrictions of the film's budget&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The director is bound by financial conditions, which however should not hinder him from developing his own artistic signature.|url=http://www.filmschule.de/en/seiten/fdjobprofile.aspx|accessdate=March 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510094913/http://www.filmschule.de/en/seiten/fdjobprofile.aspx|archive-date=2013-05-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the demands of the producer and studio (such as the need to get a particular [[Motion picture rating system|age rating]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Realizing that an NC-17 rating could hurt business (some theaters and newspapers won't show or advertise NC-17 movies), Mr. Verhoeven cut 47 seconds of the most graphic sex and violence|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/16/arts/film-now-starring-on-video-the-director-s-cut.html| work=The New York Times|first=Ann|last=Hornaday|date= May 16, 1993|accessdate =November 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Directors also play an important role in [[post-production]]. While the film is still in production, the director sends "[[dailies]]" to the [[Film editing|film editor]] and explains his or her overall vision for the film, allowing the editor to assemble an [[editor's cut]]. In post-production, the director works with the editor to edit the material into the  [[director's cut]]. Well-established directors have the "[[final cut privilege]]", meaning that they have the final say on which edit of the film is released. For other directors, the studio can order further edits without the director's permission.[[File:Steven Spielberg with Chandran Rutnam in Sri Lanka.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|American director [[Steven Spielberg]] with Sri Lankan filmmaker [[Chandran Rutnam]] in Sri Lanka]]

The director is one of the few positions that requires intimate involvement during every stage of film production. Thus, the position of film director is widely considered to be a highly stressful and demanding one.&lt;ref name="Princeton"&gt;{{cite web |title=Princeton review|url=http://www.princetonreview.com/careers.aspx?cid=65|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that "20-hour days are not unusual".&lt;ref name="Film schools"/&gt; Some directors also take on additional roles, such as producing, writing or editing.

Under [[European Union]] law, the film director is considered the "author" or one of the authors of a film, largely as a result of the influence of [[auteur theory]].&lt;ref name="Kamina2002"/&gt; Auteur theory is a [[film criticism]] concept that holds that a film director's [[film]] reflects the director's personal creative vision, as if they were the primary "auteur" (the [[French language|French]] word for "author").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/auteur-theory|title=auteur theory {{!}} Definition &amp; Directors|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-02-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of—and sometimes even because of—the production of the film as part of an industrial process, the auteur's creative voice is distinct enough to shine through studio interference and the collective process.

==Career pathways==
Some film directors started as [[screenwriter]]s, [[film editor]]s or [[actor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Many are experienced actors, editors or writers|url=http://alis.alberta.ca/occinfo/Content/RequestAction.asp?aspAction=GetHTMLProfile&amp;format=html&amp;OCCPRO_ID=71011104|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several American cinematographers have become directors, including [[Barry Sonnenfeld]], originally the Coen brothers' DP; [[Jan de Bont]], cinematographer on films as ''[[Die Hard]]'' and ''[[Basic Instinct]]'', directed ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]'' and ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]''. [[Wally Pfister]], cinematographer on [[Christopher Nolan]]'s three Batman films made his directorial debut with ''[[Transcendence (2014 film)|Transcendence]]''.

'''Gambler’s conceit''' is the fallacy described by behavioral economist David J. Ewing, where a gambler believes they will be able to stop a risky behavior while still engaging in it. This belief frequently operates during games of chance, such as [[casino]] games. The [[gambling|gambler]] believes they will be a net winner at the game, and thus able to avoid going broke by exerting the self-control necessary to stop playing while still ahead in winnings. This is often expressed as “I’ll quit when I’m ahead.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://casinoroulettesecrets.com/gambler-conceit.htm | title=Gambler’s conceit or a kind of addiction | publisher=Casino Roulette Secrets | accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quitting while ahead is unlikely, though, since a gambler who is winning has little incentive to quit, and is instead encouraged to continue to gamble by their winning. Once in the throes of a winning streak, the individual may even become convinced that it is their skill, rather than chance, causing their winnings, or good luck on their side, and thus it seems especially senseless to stop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.forextraders.com/forex-money-management/gamblers-conceit.html | title=Gambler's Conceit | publisher=Forex | date=23 February 2011 | accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gambler's conceit frequently works in conjunction with the [[gambler's fallacy]]: the mistaken idea that a losing streak in a game of chance, such as roulette, has to come to an end because the frequency of one event has an effect on a following independent event.  

Therefore, players think that it is necessary to continue playing while winning and necessary to continue playing while losing.

Relatedly, [[gambler's ruin]] shows that a player with finite resources continuously playing will inevitably go broke against a player with infinite resources in a fair or negative-expectation game. However, this is also true in a positive-expectation game if the player with finite resources continually plays and increases his stakes when winning, but does not reduce them when losing.

As casinos have a [[house advantage]] in games of chance, a casino is more likely over time to take a player's money than a player is to win money from the casino, and thus it is to the casino's advantage to keep a winning player playing. Casinos thus frequently encourage winning players to continue playing. An example can be seen in the [[Martin Scorsese]] movie ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]'' where [[Robert De Niro]]'s character ensures that a high-stakes gambler continues to gamble to ensure that the money returns to the casino. On a smaller scale, casinos offer players free alcoholic drinks to encourage them to keep gambling.

'''Gordon Music Learning Theory''' is a model for [[music education]] based on Edwin Gordon's research on musical aptitude and achievement in the greater field of [[music learning theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Gordon, Learning Sequences in Music: A Contemporary Learning Theory (Chicago: GIA Publications, Inc, 2007) 3. {{ISBN|978-1-57999-688-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard F. Grunow, Music Learning Theory: A Catalyst for Change in Beginning Instrumental Music Instruction (Chicago: GIA Publications, Inc, 2005): 195.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is an explanation of music learning, based on audiation (see below) and students' individual musical differences. The theory uses the concepts of discrimination and inference learning to explain tonal, rhythmic, and harmonic patterns.&lt;ref&gt;R.C. Gerhardstein: A Biographical and Historical Account of an American Music Educator and Researcher (diss., Temple U., 2001), 200–259&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jere T. Humphreys, Music Learning Theory. Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. (Oxford University Press. Web. September 29, 2015 http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.A2267268&lt;/ref&gt;

==Audiation==
''Audiation'' is a term Gordon coined in 1975 to refer to comprehension and internal realization of music, or the sensation of an individual hearing or feeling sound when it is not physically present.&lt;ref name="Kratus 1994"&gt;Gerhardstein, R. C. (2002). The historical roots and development of audiation: A process for musical understanding. In Hanley, B. &amp; Goolsby, T.W. (Eds.) Musical understanding: Perspectives in theory and practice. [Canada] : Canadian Music Educators Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Musicians previously used terms such as ''aural perception'' or ''aural imagery'' to describe this concept, though ''aural imagery'' would imply a notational component while audiation does not necessarily do so.&lt;ref name="Jordan 1987"&gt;James M. Jordan, "The Pedagogy of Choral Intonation: Efficient Pedagogy to Approach an Old Problem," ''The Choral Journal'' Vol. 27, No. 9 (1987): 9–13, 15–16. https://www.jstor.org/stable/23547288&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon suggests that "audiation is to music what thought is to language."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Azzara, Audiation, Improvisation, and Music Learning Theory. (1991, The Quarterly, 2(1–2), 106–109.&lt;/ref&gt; His research is based on similarities between how individuals learn a language and how they learn to make and understand music.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Gordon, Rhythm: Contrasting the Implications of Audiation and Notation (Chicago: GIA Publications, 2000): 111. {{ISBN|1579990983}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon specifies that audiation potential is an element of music aptitude, arguing that to demonstrate music aptitude one must use audiation.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Gordon, All About Audiation and Music Aptitudes (September 1999, Music Educators Journal)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audiation and language===
Gordon describes that audiation occurs when an individual is "listening to, recalling, performing, interpreting, creating, improvising, reading, or writing music."&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Gordon, Learning Sequences in Music: A Contemporary Learning Theory (Chicago: GIA Publications, Inc, 2007) 3. {{ISBN|978-1-57999-688-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiation while listening to music, he describes, is analogous to the simultaneous translation of languages, giving meaning to sound and music based on individual knowledge and experience.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Gordon, Learning Sequences in Music: A Contemporary Learning Theory (Chicago: GIA Publications, Inc, 2007) 4–5. {{ISBN|978-1-57999-688-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gordon also emphasizes that music itself is not a language as it has no words or grammar, but rather has syntax, an "orderly arrangement of sounds, and context." &lt;ref&gt;Edwin Gordon, Learning Sequences in Music: A Contemporary Learning Theory (Chicago: GIA Publications, Inc, 2007) 5. {{ISBN|978-1-57999-688-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of audiation===
Gordon differentiates different varieties of audiation and categorizes them into 8 types and 6 stages.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Gordon, Learning Sequences in Music: A Contemporary Learning Theory (Chicago: GIA Publications, Inc, 2007) 15. {{ISBN|978-1-57999-688-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Type 1, Listening to familiar or unfamiliar music.
*Type 2, Reading familiar or unfamiliar music.
*Type 3, Writing familiar or unfamiliar music from dictation.
*Type 4, Recalling and performing familiar music from memory.
*Type 5, Recalling and writing familiar music from memory.
*Type 6, Creating and improvising unfamiliar music while performing or in silence.
*Type 7, Creating and improvising unfamiliar music while reading.
*Type 8, Creating and improvising unfamiliar music while writing.

===Stages of audiation===
In addition to outlining types of audiation, Gordon also differentiates between stages of audiation 
&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Gordon, Learning Sequences in Music: A Contemporary Learning Theory (Chicago: GIA Publications, Inc, 2007) 20. {{ISBN|978-1-57999-688-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Stage 1 Momentary retention
*Stage 2 Imitating and audiating tonal patterns and rhythm patterns and recognizing and identifying a tonal center and macrobeats
*Stage 3 Establishing objective or subjective tonality and meter
*Stage 4 Retaining in audiation tonal patterns and rhythm patterns that have been organized
*Stage 5 Recalling tonal patterns and rhythm patterns organized and audiated in other pieces of music
*Stage 6 Anticipating and predicting tonal patterns and rhythm processes

==Learning sequences==
To describe how students learn music, Gordon outlines two main categories of learning based on his research on audiation: discrimination learning and inference learning.&lt;ref name = "GordonLSiM 101"&gt;Edwin Gordon, Learning Sequences in Music: A Contemporary Learning Theory (Chicago: GIA Publications, Inc, 2007): 101. {{ISBN|978-1-57999-688-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Discrimination learning===
Discrimination learning is defined as the ability to determine whether two elements are same or not the same.  Gordon describes five sequential levels of discrimination: aural/oral, verbal association, partial synthesis, symbolic association, and composite synthesis.
====Aural/oral====
Gordon describes that the most basic type of discrimination being aural/oral, where students hear tonal and rhythm patterns and imitate by singing, moving, and chanting patterns back to the instructor. Students listen in the aural portion of discrimination learning, while performing represents the oral portion. At this stage, students use neutral syllables to perform tonal and rhythm patterns.
====Verbal association====
After students are more able to audiate and perform basic rhythm and tonal patterns and become comfortable with imitating songs and chants in introduced tonalities and meters, Gordon explains the next step is verbal association, where contextual meaning is given to what the students are audiating and imitating through tonal or rhythm syllables (such as [[solfege]] or the names of concepts students may be audiating through tonal patterns such as [[tonic (music)|tonic]] and [[dominant (music)|dominant]]).&lt;ref name = "GordonLSiM-106-107"&gt;Edwin Gordon, Learning Sequences in Music: A Contemporary Learning Theory (Chicago: GIA Publications, Inc, 2007): 106–107. {{ISBN|978-1-57999-688-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Partial synthesis====
At both aural/oral and the verbal association level, students identify familiar tonal and rhythm patterns performed on neutral syllables by their verbal association.
====Symbolic association====
Symbolic association is the point at which students are introduced to notation, learning to associate written symbols and notation describing familiar tonal and rhythm patterns that had been introduced in the aural/oral and verbal association level of the skill learning sequence. &lt;ref name = "GordonLSiM-122-130"&gt;Edwin Gordon, Learning Sequences in Music: A Contemporary Learning Theory (Chicago: GIA Publications, Inc, 2007): 122–130. {{ISBN|978-1-57999-688-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====Composite synthesis====
At the composite synthesis level, students give context to familiar tonal or rhythm patterns by reading and writing them and identifying their tonality or meter as introduced in the symbolic association stage.&lt;ref name = "GordonLSiM-130-133"&gt;Edwin Gordon, Learning Sequences in Music: A Contemporary Learning Theory (Chicago: GIA Publications, Inc, 2007): 130–133. {{ISBN|978-1-57999-688-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Inference learning===
At the inference learning level, students take an active role in their own education and learn to identify, create, and improvise ''unfamiliar'' patterns. Similar to discrimination learning, Gordon delineates separate categories of inference learning that students logically follow in the course of music learning: generalization, creativity/improvisation, and theoretical understanding.
====Generalization====
As aural/oral learning is the most basic element of discrimination learning, generalization is the basic element of inference learning. Generalization consists aural/oral learning, verbal learning, symbolic reading, and writing. At the generalization level of learning, students may listen to sets of familiar and unfamiliar tonal or rhythmic patterns and determine whether the patterns are the same or different, ultimately reading familiar and unfamiliar patterns, as well. &lt;ref name = "GordonLSiM-137-140"&gt;Edwin Gordon, Learning Sequences in Music: A Contemporary Learning Theory (Chicago: GIA Publications, Inc, 2007): 137–140. {{ISBN|978-1-57999-688-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====Creativity/improvisation====
The creativity/improvisation level of the above learning sequences has aural/oral and symbolic levels. At the aural/oral level, teachers present familiar or unfamiliar patterns and have students respond with patterns of their own, first on neutral syllables and later with the  verbal association. At the symbolic level, students learn to recognize and sing patterns within written chord symbols, as well as learn to write their own responses to tonal patterns and rhythm patterns.&lt;ref name = "GordonLSiM-141-145"&gt;Edwin Gordon, Learning Sequences in Music: A Contemporary Learning Theory (Chicago: GIA Publications, Inc, 2007): 141–145. {{ISBN|978-1-57999-688-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====Theoretical understanding====
The final level of inference learning is theoretical understanding, in which students gain further understanding of music theory concepts in aural/oral, verbal, and symbolic contexts. Students may learn concepts such as pitch letter-names, intervals, key-signature names, or concepts such as [[cadence (music)|cadences]] and learn to recognize and perform patterns that apply such concepts.&lt;ref name = "GordonLSiM-145-150"&gt;Edwin Gordon, Learning Sequences in Music: A Contemporary Learning Theory (Chicago: GIA Publications, Inc, 2007): 145–150. {{ISBN|978-1-57999-688-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jump right in==
Jump Right In is an instrumental methods book with accompanying teacher editions that applies Gordon's music learning theory, co-written by [[Eastman School of Music]] music education faculty Richard F. Grunow and Christopher D Azzara alongside Gordon. The series of Winds and Percussion was first published in 1989–90, three years after the recorder edition.&lt;ref name = "JRI 3"&gt;Christopher D. Azzara, Edwin E, and Gordon, Richard F. Grunow. Jump Right In: the instrumental series teacher's guide book one and two, revised edition. (Chicago, IL: GIA Publications, Inc., 2001) 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The collection also includes a strings methods edition.

==Gordon music learning theory and music aptitude==
Gordon's music learning theory is based on his research on music aptitude in line with cognitive theories regarding the organization of incoming stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Cutietta, Edwin Gordon's Impact on the Field of Music Aptitude (Fall 1991: Philosophy in Music Education, Volume II, Number 1 &amp; 2): 73&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon's research suggests that music aptitude is [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] in the general population similar to intellectual aptitude.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Cutietta, Edwin Gordon's Impact on the Field of Music Aptitude (Fall 1991: Philosophy in Music Education, Volume II, Number 1 &amp; 2): 74&lt;/ref&gt; His research also suggests that music aptitude that a child is born with can only be maintained with repeated positive exposure to musical experiences soon after (or even before) birth, up until approximately age 9 where a child reaches "stabilized" music aptitude.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Cutietta, Edwin Gordon's Impact on the Field of Music Aptitude (Fall 1991: Philosophy in Music Education, Volume II, Number 1 &amp; 2): 74&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1920s and 30s heralded the creation of aptitude and achievement tests by [[Carl Seashore]], [[E. Thayer Gaston]], H.D. Wing, Arnold Bentley, and Edwin Gordon in an effort to identify students who were most likely to benefit from private instruction.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Colwell, et al. "Music education." Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press, accessed September 29, 2015, http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.A2267268&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon created a number of tests to determine music aptitude for various age groups; he developed his first music aptitude test, the ''Musical Aptitude Profile'', in 1965 for children in 4th to 12th grade. Later tests include ''Primary Measures of Music Audiation'' (PMMA), published in 1979 for children ages 5 to 8, ''Intermediate Measures of Music Audiation''(IMMA) for children ages 6 to 9,&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Gordon, Intermediate Measures of music audiation.(Chicago: G.I.A. Publications, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Audie''&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Gordon, Audie: A game for understanding and analyzing your child's music potential. (Chicago: G.I.A. Publications, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; for children ages 3 to 4.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Cutietta, Edwin Gordon's Impact on the Field of Music Aptitude (Fall 1991: Philosophy in Music Education, Volume II, Number 1 &amp; 2): 73&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon describes that these tests of musical aptitude are meant to allow teachers to adapt their instruction to individual students' needs and to target students with high musical aptitude who may not otherwise be receiving advanced musical instruction.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Gordon, All About Audiation and Music Aptitudes (September 1999, Music Educators Journal) 43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the theory==
Criticisms of music learning theory include Paul Woodford's concerns that the theory itself is a misnomer, and rather than a learning theory it is a "taxonomy of musical preconditions for critical thinking",&lt;ref name = "Woodford 1996"&gt;Paul G. Woodford, Evaluating Edwin Gordon's Music Learning Theory from a Critical Thinking Perspective. (Philosophy of Music Education Review 4, no. 2: Fall 1996): 83–95&lt;/ref&gt; and that "rather than overwhelming younger students in the beginning stages of instruction by focusing only on the complexities of music, teachers should use approaches such as Gordon's along with Kodaly, Orff, and other methodologies, to help students master basic musical skills and knowledge that are prerequisites to more independent kinds of thinking."&lt;ref name = "Gordon Responds 1997"&gt;Edwin Gordon, "Edwin Gordon Responds," ''Philosophy of Music Education Review'', Vol. 5, No. 1 (1997): 57–58. https://www.jstor.org/stable/40495414&lt;/ref&gt;  Gordon responded to these claims, arguing that Woodford misunderstood elements of Gordon's methodology, erroneously associating Gordon with "clapping of rhythms", as well as misunderstanding the difference between chronological and musical age, the difference explaining why tonal and rhythm patterns should be taught independently in order to create a foundation for "complex cognition and independent musical thinking that relates to larger musical forms".&lt;ref name = "Gordon Responds 1997"/&gt; Gordon also agrees with Woodford's comment that Gordon's approach should be taught alongside other methodologies, also asserting that he agrees with Woodford's suggestion that "students should be introduced to the full range of real-life kinds of musical thinking including less conventional, and even atypical, musical practices."&lt;ref name = "Gordon Responds 1997"/&gt;

Similar criticisms include accusations that Gordon's skills-based programs of applying Music Learning Theory are "probably too narrow and limited in scope to provide students access to the diversity of musical belief systems, practices, and groups that exist", a concern of writer Paul G. Woodford and music education theorist [[Bennett Reimer]].&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Gordon, Learning Sequences in Music: A Contemporary Learning Theory (Chicago: GIA Publications, Inc, 2007) {{ISBN|978-1-57999-688-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woodford credits Gordon for his highly developed system about the nature of music teaching and learning, but cautions that Gordon's system is too prescriptive and proscriptive to students and teachers, and that music educators should also be aware of the diversity of practices and strive to not exert pressure on students to conform to conventional musical thought and behavior.&lt;ref name = "Woodford 1996"/&gt; Gordon's 1997 response responds to this indirectly, arguing that his methodology leaves room for other methodologies to be taught alongside it.&lt;ref name = "Gordon Responds 1997"/&gt;

[[File:Gus Elen 1900.jpg|thumb|Gus Elen]]

'''Ernest Augustus Elen''' (22 July 1862 – 17 February 1940) was an English [[music hall]] singer and comedian. He achieved success from 1891, performing [[cockney]] songs including "Arf a Pint of Ale", "It's a Great Big Shame", "Down the Road" and "If It Wasn't for the 'Ouses in Between" in a career lasting over thirty years.

Born in [[Pimlico]], London, Elen had worked as a barman and a draper's assistant and had packed eggs for the [[Co-op]] before becoming a singer. He began busking at an early age and found a position singing in a [[minstrel]] troupe. His solo success began in 1891 when he started performing in public houses, singing songs in a manner similar to many cockney fruit sellers and [[ironmonger]]s of the time, known as costermongers. Because of this, he became known as a "coster comedian". For the stage persona he had created, Elen dressed in a coster uniform of striped jersey, peaked cap turned towards one ear and a short clay pipe in the side of his mouth. His characters adopted a persona of being constantly bad tempered and pugnacious. In 1907 he starred in a short film called ''Wait Till the Work Comes Round.''

In his later years, Elen went to America owing to the English music hall strike which was taking place. Elen, performed the same act as he did in the UK, but  box-office sales indicated that he was less successful than his friend, the singer [[Albert Chevalier]], and so Elen returned to the UK.  Elen then undertook various performances as a top attraction in music halls across London. He appeared on stage occasionally in the 1930s, albeit briefly, where he appeared in the 1935 Royal Command Performance. He retired in 1914, shortly after returning from America. He made occasional appearances on stage and film before his death in 1940 aged 77.

==Biography==
===Early career===
Elen was born at 103 Pulford Street, [[Pimlico]], London. His father was Edwin Elen, a viewer of cloth in a military store, and Mercy Elen, née Letherbarrow.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Russell, Dave. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/39376 ''Elen, Gus'' ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''], Oxford University Press, accessed 16 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
Elen started his career as a solo performer and briefly worked at the Old Marylebone Theatre in a 'blackface' comedy double act with a man named Daniels, who died in a boating accident a few years after the partnership was formed.&lt;ref name=Vaud&gt;Cullen, Frank. ''Vaudeville old &amp; new: an encyclopedia of variety performances'', Elen Gus, Volume 1, pg 351 – 354&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of Daniels, he returned to being a solo performer and bought the rights to "Never introduce your donah to a pal" from the song's writer A.E Durandeau, (donah was [[cockney]] slang meaning girlfriend). The song was performed on stage on 4 June 1891, at Harewood's varieties in [[Hoxton]].&lt;ref name=Vaud/&gt; Elen performed songs and sketches as the character of an old east end costermonger and became known as a 'coster' comedian. Elen drew inspiration from his experiences of growing up around people, similar to that of his persona on stage.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Elen's performances were often misinterpreted as being a self caricature, but were performed in a realistic and simplistic manner, one that made him popular with his audiences.

[[File:Gus Elen If It Wasnt for the Ouses In Between.jpg|thumb|right|The sheet music of ''If it wasn't for the 'ouses in between'']]

In an interview, given after he had become a star, he said:
{{cquote|Years before I entered the ranks of music hall performers proper, I used to contribute to the programmes of the weekly sing songs held at such places as 'Poppy Lords' in [[Lisson Grove]]; the 'Magpie and Stump', [[Battersea]]; or the 'George Street Recital Hall'. At the last named hall, the salaries ranged from a shilling to three and sixpence a night with a cup of coffee and a bun thrown in by way of refreshment. In those days I often filled in a season on the 'waxeys' (on the seaside) at [[Margate]] and [[Ramsgate]] in a Negro minstrel troupe.}}

Elen's songs were often compared to those of [[Albert Chevalier]], a contemporary to Elen and a major performer on the halls.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; There were many other coster performers on the Victorian music hall circuit, but throughout his career Elen maintained a particularly friendly rivalry with Chevalier.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

===Musical performances===
[[File:1899 Gus Ellen.jpg|thumb|right|''The Coster's Mansion'', 1899 sheet music]]
The movements for each of Elen's songs were carefully rehearsed so that the performances themselves were clean and precise. Each gesture was powerfully distinct and could be seen from the back of the largest theatre.

Many of Elen's songs spoke of the living conditions of ordinary workers and about the cramped housing conditions of the East End. Commenting on the overcrowded poor parts of London, in one of his songs, he takes on the persona of a proud tenant boasting about the dismal place he lives in, and in particular the view from his 'garden':
{{cquote|''Wiv a ladder and some glasses&lt;br&gt;You could see to [[Hackney Marshes|'Ackney marshes]]&lt;br&gt;If it wasn't for the 'ouses in between''|20px|20px|"If it Wasn't for the 'Ouses in Between"}}

The lyrics to "If It Wasn't for the 'Ouses In Between" were written by Edgar Bateman, who later wrote two more of Elen's songs: "She's Too Good to Live Is Mrs. Carter" and "The Postman's 'Oliday." The music to the songs was written by George Le Brunn, who wrote a vast number of music-hall songs and accompaniments for Marie Lloyd and Dan Leno, and also for Gus Elen's "It's a Great Big Shame". Chance Newton, a friend of Elen, spoke of his habit of leaving scores he was working on at the various pubs he visited en route to the particular hall he was travelling to.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

"If It Wasn't for the 'Ouses In Between" is perhaps Elen's most recognisable song and is about the little backyards of London houses which are hemmed in by row upon row of other houses in all of the other streets in the neighbourhood. It is set in a typical working day of an east end costermonger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/costermonger Dictionary on line], accessed October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audience representation===
His songs were bitter and realistic and rooted in the poverty and life of the East Enders who were his audience.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; The appeal to his audience, many of whom were poor, proved to be a relief to the working classes of society within London.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; His act would encourage his audience to laugh at the difficulties of working class life, and to celebrate one's capacity for survival. Some songs would go further and openly reject establishment values of hard work and moral rectitude. His song "Wait until the work comes round" was specifically written for the unemployed people of Victorian London.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

{{cquote|''Put your 'ead back on the pillow&lt;br&gt;And read your Daily Mirror&lt;ref&gt;'Pilla' and 'Mirra' both ending in [[schwa]] in Cockney pronunciation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;And wait until the work comes round''|20px|20px|"Wait until the work comes round"}}

===Later career===
In 1907, William Morris, a respected vaudeville performer in America, was sent to London by the czar of the American legitimate theatre, Abe Erlanger, who had formed "The Advanced Vaudeville".&lt;ref name=Vaud/&gt; It was created to act as direct competition for the newly established Vaudeville Hegemony, which was operating in the eastern half of the USA.&lt;ref name=Vaud/&gt; Whilst in London, Morris saw a performance of Elen's at the [[Hackney Empire]] and signed him to take part in the new company.&lt;ref name=Vaud/&gt; Elen was offered $1,500 to work in the US.&lt;ref name=TNYT1&gt;"Profit By Music Hall War", ''The New York Times'', 5 April 1907&lt;/ref&gt; He accepted the offer and appeared on the same bill as [[Harry Lauder]] and Will Evans&lt;ref name=TNYT1/&gt; at [[Olympia Theatre (New York)|The New York Theatre]] where he performed his repertoire of cockney songs to the delight of American audiences.&lt;ref name=TNYT2&gt;"London Types in New York", ''The New York Times'', 10 September 1907&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' described his act as being "...strange, raucous, quavering voice with its queer breaks into the treble, the shambling gait and the sudden jerky gestures of a coster, with all the little mannerisms that serve to make him what he is".&lt;ref name=TNYT2/&gt; 

The New York Dramatic News cited; "While his act is, in a sense, similar to that of Albert Chevalier, it is also radically different. Mr. Elen portrays the coster as if he actually exists in his native element".&lt;ref name=Vaud/&gt;
The box-office sales indicated that Chevalier, who was also appearing in America, was more popular with American audiences than Elen and so he returned to the UK and performed for a further seven years as a top attraction in music halls across London, before his retirement.&lt;ref name=Vaud/&gt;

Elen took early retirement in 1914 after 33 years of performing.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He returned in the 1930s, albeit briefly, where he appeared in a film and in the 1935 ''[[Royal Command Performance]]''.&lt;ref name=Vaud/&gt;

==Personal life==
Unlike most performers, Elen kept a meticulous record of his songs with notes about the gestures and emotions, props required and stage settings.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He also wrote comments about how his performance was received.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Elen was praised as an "authentic cockney from the poor streets of London" and was well known for his involvement in personally organised charity events.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; For many years he and his wife distributed free Christmas gifts to the poor in public.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Elen was a fiercely private person&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; and although he was married with children, he would never refer to his family by their names when interviewed by the press.&lt;ref name=Vaud/&gt; From 1898 Elen lived largely in Balham, where he bred poultry and took up photography.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He also became a keen fisherman, particularly during a spell in residence on the south coast, and enjoyed shooting.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Elen would not socialise with fellow artists, opting instead to go fishing, shooting or driving around the English countryside.&lt;ref name=Vaud/&gt;

Elen died of [[liver cancer]]&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; at his home in Balham, South London, on 17 February 1940, aged 77&lt;ref name=Vaud/&gt; and is buried in [[Streatham Park Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Burials.htm |title=Music Hall and Variety Artistes Burial Places |publisher=Arthurlloyd.co.uk |date= |accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a [[blue plaque]] at his former home, 3 Thurleigh Avenue, Balham, which was erected by Greater London Council in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Plaques/MusicHallArtistesCommemorativePlaques.htm |title=Music Hall and Variety Artistes Commemorative Plaques |publisher=Arthurlloyd.co.uk |date= |accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through its history, [[Hanna-Barbera]] has operated theme park attractions, mostly as a section in [[Kings Island]], [[Carowinds]], [[California's Great America]], [[Kings Dominion]], [[Canada's Wonderland]], and recently, [[Six Flags Great America]].

Outside [[North America]], the theme parks were also available in several countries, notably in the [[United Kingdom]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Gabon]], and even [[Australia]], which was part of [[Australia's Wonderland]], which was now defunct. [[Hanna-Barbera Land]] was also opened in Houston, Texas.

The sections contained in the [[KECO Entertainment]]-owned parks was retained when their parent park, except the one in Australia, was bought by Paramount Communications (formerly Gulf+Western, and later acquired by Viacom), then the parent of Paramount Pictures, which changed the name of the parks by adding "Paramount's" in front of their names. The park in Australia was not purchased by Paramount and was sold to a local company. KECO Entertainment was renamed into [[Paramount Parks]] in 1994, around the time of the [[Viacom (1971–2005)|Viacom]] purchase, and remained in existence until 2006. As part of the 2005 Viacom split, ownership of Paramount Parks was transferred to the [[CBS Corporation]]. CBS then sold the parks to the [[Sandusky, Ohio]]-based amusement park management company [[Cedar Fair Entertainment Company]] on June 30, 2006.

As an effect of absorption of Hanna-Barbera into [[Warner Bros. Animation]] in 2001, the parks have largely removed or rebranded the areas into other children's sections by either the [[Nickelodeon]] brand and/or the [[Warner Bros.]] brand. Current Hanna-Barbera theme parks are [[Bedrock City (South Dakota)|Bedrock City]] in South Dakota, the one with [[Bedrock City (Arizona)|the same name]] in [[Arizona]], Camp Cartoon, located in Six Flags Great America, as part of Camp Cartoon section, and Yogi Bear's Jellystone Park Campground.

==History of involvement in theme parks==
[[Taft Broadcasting]] purchased [[Hanna-Barbera Productions]], a television animation studio, in 1967. Two years later, it purchased Cincinnati's [[Coney Island]] amusement park, moving it and expanding it on a larger allotment of land, reopening it in 1972 as [[Kings Island]]. The company partnered with [[Top Value Enterprises]] to create [[Family Leisure Centers]] in 1973, opening Virginia's [[Kings Dominion]] in 1975; the company purchases [[Carowinds]] the same year. In 1979, Taft purchases 20% of the new [[Canada's Wonderland]] theme park in Toronto, Canada, which opens in 1981. The year prior, Family Entertainment Centers was dissolved, making Taft the sole owner of Kings Dominion.

By 1984, a grouping of senior executives from Taft's Amusement Park Group and some park managers purchase Taft's theme park division. The group names the resulting company [[Kings Entertainment Company]] (KECO). Taft gives KECO a perpetual license to use 
Hanna-Barbera characters at all of their current parks. [[Australia's Wonderland]], which opens in 1985, also licenses the characters, but 1989 KECO purchase [[California's Great America|Great America]] doesn't opt receive the license, or opt to separately license. In their first year of incorporation, KECO opened a short-lived [[Hanna-Barbera Land]] in [[Houston, Texas]].

The Kings Entertainment Company theme parks all had Hanna-Barbera sections, some having ''The Flintstones'' sections, and Smurf sections, after the popularity of the 1980s television series ''[[The Smurfs (TV series)|The Smurfs]]''. Through the years, these parks have largely removed or rebranded the areas into other children's sections (under the [[Nickelodeon]] brand and the Paramount Parks-created name "KidZVille"). Any of the still operating parks are part of [[Cedar Fair Entertainment Company]]; Australia's Wonderland and the stand-alone Hanna-Barbera Land parks are both defunct.

===Big hopes for motion-controlled attraction===

In October 1989, animated film producer [[David Kirschner]] became Hanna-Barbera's president and CEO; Hanna-Barbera was part of the publicly traded [[Great American Broadcasting Company]]. He set out to make the company an entertainment conglomerate to rival Disney, by utilizing its existing core characters.&lt;ref name="nyt-disneymap"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE2DB103BF93AA35752C0A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink | work=The New York Times | title=Hanna-Barbera Follows Disney Map | first=Michael | last=Lev | date=1990-01-09 | accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing the Hanna-Barbera parks needed rejuvenation, he had the company create ''[[The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera (ride)|The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera]]'', a motion simulation-ride.

Created to be one of [[Universal Studios Florida]]'s original attractions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE2DC133AF930A2575BC0A96F948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=%22hanna%20Barbera%22%20theme%20park&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=Nastiness Is Not a Fantasy In Movie Theme Park War | first=Jeffrey | last=Schmalz | date=1989-08-13 | accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera'' cost between $13 and $14 million, and opened June 7, 1990.&lt;ref name="nyt-disneymap" /&gt; They also opened a concept store at the exit to the attraction, for a chain of Hanna-Barbera stores they hoped to open.&lt;ref name="nyt-disneymap" /&gt; The attraction operated for 12 years, until it was closed October 20, 2002, to make room for [[Jimmy Neutron's Nicktoon Blast]].

==Hanna-Barbera Land park==
{{main article|Hanna–Barbera Land}}
Hanna–Barbera Land was a theme park based on the cartoons of the Hanna-Barbera animation studio. It was located in the Spring CDP of unincorporated Harris County, Texas, United States, north of Houston. It was open in the 1984 and 1985 seasons.
The park was built under the guise of Taft Broadcasting, which became the Kings Entertainment Company as of opening. Kings also owned the Australia's Wonderland, Canada's Wonderland, Carowinds, Kings Dominion, and Kings Island theme parks. Despite increased attendance in 1985, a bad regional economy and minimal spending in the park on concessions, gift shop purchases, and souvenirs meant a death knell for the attraction.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
Hanna–Barbera Land was sold to private investors and SplashTown USA was built in its place, then again to Bryant Morris, then to Six Flags who purchased the park in 1999. After initially not wanting to brand the park and calling it "a member of the Six Flags family," Six Flags eventually decided to re-brand the park as Six Flags SplashTown. In 2007 the park was sold to PARC Management who continues to operate the site.

==As sections of larger parks==

===Canada's Wonderland===

'''Hanna-Barbera Land''' opened in 1981 with three sections. The first section was '''Yogi's Woods''', based on ''[[The Yogi Bear Show]]'', which featured the attractions Balloon Race, Yogi's Cave, Boo Boos Buggys, and the Woodland Theatre (now the Playhouse Theatre). '''Scoobyville''' was the central town site, where a carousel and other attractions were included. On the opposite end of Scoobyville from Yogi's Wood was '''Bedrock''', based on ''[[The Flintstones]]''. '''Saltwater Circus''' was also in the section.

In 1984, '''Smurf Village''' replaced Yogi's Woods; the section featured the newly popular Hanna-Barbera cartoon ''[[The Smurfs]]''. A walk-through attraction, Smurf Village closed at the end of the 1992 season.

For the 1993 season, the Smurf Village section of the park became Kids Kingdom. In 1998, KidZVille replaced the Kids Kingdom  and its two rides, the "Kid's Castle Playland" and the "Jumbo Bumps" were renamed to "The Candy Factory" and the "Twizzler Twist" (and renamed again the next year to "Sour Cherry Blaster Twist"). Along with five new rides for KidZVille, "The Busy Little Town" was launched, and it included the characters from Nickelodeon's ''[[Rugrats]]'' series.&lt;ref name="1998-web"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.canadaswonderland.com/kidzville/index.html | title = Canada's Wonderland - KIDZVILLE | accessdate = 2008-12-16 | year = 1998 | work = Canada's Wonderland | publisher = Paramount Parks | location = Maple, Ontario | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/19980502145650/http://www.canadaswonderland.com/kidzville/index.html | archivedate = 2 May 1998 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Playhouse Theatre still had a Hanna-Barbera themed show, ''Scooby Doo's Scary School Daze''.&lt;ref name="1998-web" /&gt; On slower days, the Scooby-Doo [[walkaround character]] may venture through this section of the park.

The Bedrock section of the park met its end soon after, being replaced by [[Nickelodeon Central]] in 2003. Only the bumper cars were kept, turned into the ''Rugrats Toonpike''. The restaurant was de-themed, and turned into a [[Pizza Pizza]].

In 2010, Hanna-Barbera Land was replaced with [[Planet Snoopy]].

===Carowinds===
'''Happy Land of Hanna-Barbera''' (1975-?)

In 1984, Carowinds added '''Smurf Island''', which was a children's play area located on the 1.3-acre (5,300 m2) island surrounded by the Carolina Sternwheeler. Access to Smurf Island was gained in one of two ways – across the Carolina Sternwheeler and a ramp built on the island side of the boat, or on diesel-powered "Smurf Boats" launched from the area beside Harmony Hall. Children could enjoy two ball crawls and a climbing area complete with ropes, cargo nets, wood platforms, a rope tunnel and a 60-foot (18 m) tubular slide. Smurf characters roamed the island and led guests to the hidden Smurf village with four Smurf houses that children could enter. Smurf Island was eventually closed, and later demolished to make space for the BORG Assimilator, a Star Trek themed flying roller coaster. The Borg coaster is still operating today but the theming was removed in 2008 and the name was changed to [[Nighthawk (roller coaster)|Nighthawk]].

===Great America===
Opening in 1987, Smurf Woods featured a pint-sized steel coaster, The Blue Streak (now called Woodstock Express), as well as a Smurf village with mushroom houses. Smurf Woods was closed in 1995 and replaced with Nickelodeon Splat City. One Smurf house survived and can be seen in the Picnic Grove area. The area was renamed [[Planet Snoopy]] in 2010.

===Kings Dominion===
'''The Happy Land of Hanna-Barbera''' (1975–1997)

The earlier Land of the Dooz Mine Train attraction became Smurf Mountain. It was eventually closed to make room for the popular Volcano: The Blast Coaster in 1998.

===Kings Island===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Oldkingsisland.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Original Kings Island logo, 1972-1992.|{{deletable image-caption|1=Wednesday, 26 August 2009}}]] --&gt;

When [[Kings Island]] opened in 1972, one of its original themed areas was '''The Happy Land of Hanna Barbera'''.&lt;ref name="leaving"&gt;{{cite news | title = Hanna-Barbera Land Is Leaving Kings Island | url = http://www.newsnet5.com/news/5005690/detail.html | work = newsnet5.com | publisher = The E.W.

Flintstone's Boulder Bumpers was added to the park in 1976.&lt;ref name="timeline-ki"&gt;http://www.kiextreme.com/history_timeline.php&lt;/ref&gt; The 1977 park season wrapped with The Peanut Olympics, between teams led by [[Billy Carter]], [[United States President]] [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]]'s younger brother, and Yogi Bear. The two-day event was won by Carter.&lt;ref name="trivia-ki"&gt;{{cite press release | title = Trivia About Kings Island | publisher = Kings Island/Cedar Fair | year = 2008 | format = PDF | url = http://www.visitkingsisland.com/mediakit/facts/TriviaAboutKI.pdf | accessdate = 2008-12-16 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090718164915/http://www.visitkingsisland.com/mediakit/facts/TriviaAboutKI.pdf | archivedate = 2009-07-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the park's 10th anniversary in 1982, it expanded '''Hanna-Barbera Land''', spending $2.1 million on the new attractions.&lt;ref name="bryan"&gt;{{cite news | title = Kings Island expands Hanna-Barbera Land | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uioLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=uVEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5678,213725&amp;dq=hanna+barbera+land | format = Scan | agency = UPI | work = The Bryan Times | publisher = The Bryan Times | location = Bryan, Ohio | page = 7 | date = 1982-04-02 | accessdate = 2008-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Hanna and Joe Barbera attended the media preview on Monday, April 9 at 10 am.&lt;ref name="bryan" /&gt; The new attractions were:&lt;ref name="bryan" /&gt;

The Enchanted Voyage ride was closed in 1983, to be retrofitted to the upcoming [[Smurfs]] television series. "[[The Smurfs' Enchanted Voyage]]" debuted in 1984, while the television series was popular. People would ride in a boat around the world of the Smurfs celebrating the seasons of Winter, Fall, Summer, and Spring.

The Flying Carpet slide was moved to Hanna-Barbera Land in 1986, becoming Scrappy's Slide.&lt;ref name="timeline-ki" /&gt;

Five rides were added to Hanna-Barbera Land in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Larry | last = Fox | title = What's New at Amusement Parks | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1123704.html | format = Subscription only | work = The Washington Post | publisher = Washington Post Company | location = Washington, DC | pages =  | page =  | date = 1990-04-27 | accessdate = 2008-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, Sunshine Turnpike was closed, to give more room for Hanna-Barbera Land.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kiextreme.com/history_defunct.php&lt;/ref&gt; The Hanna-Barbera attraction received competition in 1995, from a "Nickelodeon Splat City" section.&lt;ref name="fact-2008"&gt;{{cite press release | title = Kings Island Fact Sheet | publisher = Kings Island/Cedar Fair | year = 2008 | format = PDF | url = http://www.visitkingsisland.com/mediakit/facts/2008KingsIslandFactSheet.pdf | accessdate = 2008-12-16 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The park was purchased by Paramount Parks in 1992, and a $750,000 upgrade was made to the section; new attractions were The Enchanted Theatre, Scooby Zoom, Pixie and Dixie's Swingset, and Dick Dastardly's Biplanes. Additionally, the Smurf's Enchanted Voyage was retrofitted for $3.5 million, into the Phantom Theatre.&lt;ref name="timeline-ki" /&gt; In 1998, [[Scooby's Ghoster Coaster (Kings Island)|Scooby's Ghoster Coaster]] (their second Scooby-themed coaster), Yogi's Skytours,&lt;ref name="fact-2008" /&gt; and Atom Ant's Airways were added to the park;&lt;ref name="timeline-ki" /&gt; Scooby Zoom was renamed Top Cat's Taxi Jam, and Flintstone Flybots turned into Jetson's Jet Orbiters.&lt;ref name="timeline-ki" /&gt;

[[Nickelodeon]] Central was added to the park in 2001, taking over parts of Parts of Rivertown and Hanna-Barbera Land.&lt;ref name="timeline-ki" /&gt; For seven years in a row, 2001–2008, the collective kids area at the park has received ''Amusement Today'' magazine's "Golden Ticket for Best Kids' Area in the World in 2007".&lt;ref name="2008-pr-bestkids"&gt;{{cite press release | title = Kings Island Features Best Kids’ Area In The World! | publisher = Kings Island | year = 2008 | format = PDF | url = http://www.visitkingsisland.com/mediakit/news/5.pdf | accessdate = 2008-12-16 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090220050754/http://visitkingsisland.com/mediakit/news/5.pdf | archivedate = 2009-02-20 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area was removed at the end of the 2005 season, to make way for Nickelodeon Universe, featuring 18 "new" rides. Scooby-Doo and the Haunted Castle was the only ride to remain as-is,&lt;ref name="leaving" /&gt; having been created in 2003 as a complete overhaul of the existing Phantom Theater ride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Connie | last = Yeager | title = BEHIND-THE-SCENES AT KINGS ISLAND\ AMUSEMENT PARK GEARS UP FOR 2003. | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-97332939.html | format = Subscription required | work = The Cincinnati Post | publisher = The E.

==Attractions==

===Scooby's Gasping Ghoster Coaster===
{{main article|Scooby's Ghoster Coaster}}
It was a prototype Caripo Batflyer [[suspended roller coaster]] (billed as the first suspended coaster for kids). The ride had poor capacity and roughness complaints. It was removed in 2005 as a part of the Hanna-Barbera Land retheming at Kings Island For Nickelodeon Universe. However, the attraction using the same name in the city of [[Doswell, Virginia]] and in [[Vaughan, Ontario]], Canada was kept its name until 2010 when the Canadian version was renamed into simply Ghoster Coaster. In Doswell, Virginia, although the name was also simplified, the usual ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' theme was kept.

===Scooby-Doo===
{{main article|Scooby-Doo (roller coaster)}}
Themed to ''Scooby-Doo'', it was opened together with Kings Island in 1972. The second one was opened in 1974 at Kings Dominion, prior to the park's official 1975 opening.  It was also opened in Carowinds. Paying homage to ''[[The Beast (roller coaster)|The Beast]]'' after its successful launch in 1979, a tunnel was added to the bottom of the first drop for the 1980 season, and the Kings Island version was renamed "The Beastie".

When those two parks were under the ownership of [[Viacom (1971–2005)|Viacom]], they started to add areas themed to the Nickelodeon television channel. In 2005, during the process of re-branding of the roller coaster as the ''Fairly Odd Coaster'', the wooden superstructure was painted indigo, and the cars repainted to mimic the characters, [[Cosmo and Wanda]], from ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]''; one train pink and the other green, with the fairies' faces on the front of the cars. To depict these characters as roller coaster trains is accurate to the television show because on screen, the fairies can change their shape at will, though their faces always remain visible on whatever they become.

The same thing was done to the Kings Island version a year later. Ironically, Cedar Fair purchased both of those parks as well as the three other parks that were owned by Viacom. Cedar Fair then decided to remove all remaining Hanna-Barbera and Nickelodeon themes from the kids area in time for the start of the 2010 season.

=== Scooby-Doo Spooky Coaster ===
{{main article|Scooby-Doo Spooky Coaster}}
Unusually, this attraction is a [[wild mouse roller coaster]]. It isn't located at any of the former Paramount Parks altogether. It was built in 2002, and located in [[Warner Bros. Movie World]] in Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia.

=== ''The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera'' ===
{{main article|The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera (ride)}}

=== Scooby-Doo's Haunted Mansion ===
{{main article|Scooby-Doo's Haunted Mansion}}
This attraction, that found in Carowinds, Kings Dominion, Kings Island and Canada's Wonderland take on the traditional dark ride. On this ride, the scenes feature ghosts and monsters that riders shoot at using laser-outfitted guns. Riders in consecutive cars compete with each other to see who can shoot the most ghosts. In the [[United Kingdom]], it was called '''Scooby-Doo and the Haunted Castle'''. It was possibly themed to the TV show ''[[What's New, Scooby-Doo?]]''. The ride was re-themed on November 27, 2009, to remove the ''Scooby-Doo'' characters. The move is part of the park's broader move away from Hanna-Barbera characters. It became '''Boo Blasters on Boo Hill''', a shooting dark ride themed to a large ghost.

=== Baba Looey's Buggies ===
It is located in the South Pie section of Hanna-Barbera Land, these were simple handcars on a track. The Kings Island version was removed to make way for the Nickelodeon Universe expansion.

=== Jetson's Jet Orbiters ===
It can be found currently in [[Movie Park Germany]] and also in Warner Bros. Movie World Australia. It was seen in Kings Island until 2005 due to the makeover to Nick Universe. It was known as a legal successor to the ''Flintstone Flybots'' and themed to ''[[The Jetsons]]''.

=== McScrappy's Slide ===
This was a Giant Slide originally called Flying Carpet Slide which was moved from Coney Island to the spot where Zephyr is today. It was later relocated to Hanna-Barbera Land for the 1986 season (about where Flying Ace Aerial Chase is today) and renamed to McScrappy's Slide. The attraction was removed indefinitely in 1995 to make way for the addition of ''[[Nickelodeon Splat City]]''.

=== Attractions themed to ''Top Cat'' ===
Two attractions themed to the TV show ''[[Top Cat]]'', named Top Cat's Taxi Jam and The Alley Cat 500, were located in Kings Island and Kings Dominion. Rumors said that The Alley Cat 500 was the predecessor to the Swiper's Sweepers, which closed permanently in 2010 when Cedar Fair decided to remove all remaining Hanna-Barbera and Nickelodeon themes in time for the start of the 2010 season. Top Cat's Taxi Jam was the successor of Scooby Zoom. From 2006 to 2010, it was known as the Little Bill's Giggle Coaster. It was succeeded by The Great Pumpkin Coaster, which was introduced on September 8, 2009.

=== Other attractions ===
No attractions themed to ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' appeared in all of the former Paramount Parks and the now-defunct Wonderland Sydney, although a promotion advertisement with [[Tom Cat]] holding a sign was shown in Canada's Wonderland prior to 2009. In addition, several attractions themed to ''[[The Flintstones]]'' also appear in theme parks in [[Abu Dhabi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Flintstones Bedrock River Adventure |url=https://www.wbworldabudhabi.com/en/rides/the-flintstones-bedrock-river-adventure |website=WBW World |publisher=WBW World |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Flintstones |url=https://www.tsogosun.com/gold-reef-city-casino/kiddies-rides/flintstones |website=Tsogo Sun |publisher=Tsogo Sun |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attractions associated with [[DC Comics]], although can be found in every parks themed to Warner Bros., and had the show ''[[Super Friends]]'' (and also ''[[The Dukes (TV series)|The Dukes]]'') that made also by Hanna-Barbera, never appear altogether in any of the Hanna-Barbera parks - it were always under WB control.

Attractions to the shows such as ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]'', ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', and any other shows that co-produced with [[Cartoon Network Studios]] were unavailable in any of the Hanna-Barbera attractions. Also attractions themed to licensed non-''[[The Smurfs (TV series)|Smurfs]]'' properties such as ''[[Snorks]]'', ''[[Pac-Man (TV series)|Pac-Man]]'' and ''[[Richie Rich (1980 TV series)|Richie Rich]]'' were also not allowed.

'''''Hell in the Pacific''''' is a 1968 British-Japanese [[War film|war]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] starring [[Lee Marvin]] and [[Toshirō Mifune]], the only two actors in the entire film. It was directed by [[John Boorman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{AFI film|id=20261|title=Hell in the Pacific}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It looks at the importance of human contact and the bond which can form even between enemies if lacking other contact.

==Plot==
Two unnamed [[WWII]] servicemen, one American ([[Lee Marvin]]) and one Japanese ([[Toshiro Mifune]]), are stranded on an uninhabited [[Pacific]] island. The Japanese soldier suddenly discovers a military plane crash kit near his camp. The American, whose plane it recently came from, watches him salvage the kit and confronts him on the beach. After aggressive gestures from both men, the American notices that the Japanese has a small reservoir of drinking water and makes a dash to drink some, but is run off into the jungle. The Japanese sets fire to the jungle, smoking out the American. After chasing him off again, he wades out into the water to check his fishing trap. While his back is turned, the American makes another run for the drinking water, eventually stealing some and running off.

The next day, the American tries to steal more water, but is caught and falls on the reservoir, destroying it. After escaping, he destroys the fish trap, makes noises and plays tricks on the Japanese. After urinating on him from the cliff above, he's chased into the jungle by the infuriated Japanese, but collapses from dehydration. The Japanese takes him prisoner, binds his arms to a log and makes him walk back and forth in the sand. Eventually, the American escapes, surprises the Japanese and then binds ''him'' to the log and makes ''him'' walk back and forth in the sand. After getting frustrated trying to cook a meal, the American cuts the Japanese loose so that he can do the cooking. They cease hostilities and share chores and food from then on.

Later, the American notices the Japanese trying to build a raft. He scolds him for stealing "his" log to make the raft and for being sneaky about its construction. After observing what a poor attempt the raft is, he gets the idea that they should build a better one together. They argue over the design, but eventually work together and build a large raft. After setting sail and overcoming the strong waves of the reef, they hit open water.

Days later, they come upon a new set of islands, on one of which there appears to be an abandoned base. The Japanese takes the lead, since he recognizes it as a Japanese base. The American then spots American supplies and runs after him, imploring any soldiers who might hear to not fire because the Japanese is his "friend". At one point, startled by running into his friend, the American exclaims in relief, "for a moment there, I thought you were a Jap". Realizing that the base truly is abandoned, they rummage around for useful items and luxuries, eventually finding shaving supplies, a bottle of wine, cigarettes and an issue of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine.

That night, each seeing the other clean shaven for the first time, they drink wine together, sing songs and tell each other stories, despite the language barrier. Casually, the Japanese picks up and looks through the ''Life'' magazine and is horrified to see photos of dead and imprisoned Japanese soldiers. The American, now a little drunk, gets upset that the Japanese isn't answering a question and the two angrily glare at one another, too upset to notice the increasingly loud sounds of the island being shelled. The Japanese stands up and walks a few paces away and the American gets up and kicks over the campfire. As the Japanese turns and walks back, a shell hits the building that they're in and destroys it. In the alternate ending (available on home video releases), no shell hit occurs and the two men are shown going their separate ways.

==Cast==
* [[Lee Marvin]] as American Pilot
* [[Toshirō Mifune]] as Captain Tsuruhiko Kuroda

==Production notes==
The film contains little dialogue, and much like its predecessor – the film ''[[None but the Brave]]'' – is not dubbed or sub-titled, thus authentically portraying the frustration of restricted communication between the Japanese- and English-speakers. The film was entirely shot in the Rock Islands of [[Palau]] in the north [[Pacific Ocean]], near the [[Philippines]] in the [[Philippine Sea]].

The film was originally released with a rather abrupt ending, one that left many dissatisfied with the outcome of the struggle these men endured. The subsequent DVD release has an alternative ending, which while leaving the eventual destiny of the two ambiguous, was much more in line with the overall direction of the film.

Both actors served for their respective countries during the [[Pacific War]]. Marvin, who was in the [[United States Marine Corps|US Marines]], was wounded and received the [[Purple Heart]] during the [[Battle of Saipan]] in 1944. Mifune served in the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Service]].

==Reception==

The film was perhaps too close to the end of the [[Second World War]] to stem inevitable anti-Japanese sentiments from the American public (which is presumably partly the purpose of the film). Both actors were hugely respected in their own countries at the time (Marvin had recently won an Oscar for ''[[Cat Ballou]]'' and Mifune was probably the most famous actor in Japan at the time). However, a largely dialogue-free and action-free film was too much to ask for great audience love, and neither actor was able to show their usual potential.

===Box office===
The film earned rentals of $1.33 million in North America and $1.9 million elsewhere. Because of the high costs involved, by 1973 the movie had recorded a loss of $4,115,000, making it one of the biggest money losers in the short history of ABC films.&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt;

===Critical reception===
{{quote|Toshiro Mifune also took on foreign assignments, but few did him justice. It was only John Boorman's ''Hell in the Pacific'' that captured something of his range, humour and power.|[[British Film Institute]]}}

'''''How's Your News?''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[television series]] and also a feature film.  It aired Sundays on [[MTV]] in the United States, and the feature film based on the same concept was released in 2003.  It stars a group of [[reporter]]s with [[developmental disability|developmental disabilities]] who interview [[celebrities]] and [[politicians]]. It is the continuation of a [[documentary film]] project started in 1999 by [[Arthur Bradford]] at Camp Jabberwocky in [[Martha's Vineyard]], which was made into a movie of the same name and shown on [[HBO]] in 2003. ''[[South Park]]'' creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] serve as the show's executive producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

According to the ''How's Your News?'' website on April 9, 2009, the show has not been renewed for a second season on MTV, stating:

''"The decision had little to do with the quality of the series, which was one of the most enthusiastically received and best reviewed programs on mtv this year.  It’s just a tough financial time and mtv needed to keep pushing for higher ratings with other shows.  Also, we always knew that our series was an unusual fit for their style of programming.  We’re not “The Hills” or “America’s Next Best Dance Crew” after all…"&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20120222181046/http://www.howsyournews.com/archives/651&lt;/ref&gt;''

After completing the feature film for HBO, the concept was pitched to the Trio network, who subsequently backed the short film "On the Campaign Trail", about the ''How's Your News?'' teams trip to both the Democratic and Republican conventions in 2004.  The half-hour film was broadcast on Trio and Channel Four England and featured candid interviews with Hillary Clinton, [[John McCain]], Andre 3000, Ben Affleck, Howard Dean, Michael Moore and Newt Gingrich, amongst others.  Although it was rarely seen, this half-hour documentary was well reviewed and helped convince MTV of the viability of the concept as mainstream TV series.  They funded a pilot in 2006.

The '''International Vale Tudo Championship''' is an [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]] fighting promotion based in [[Brazil]] starting in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mma-core.com/organizations/_International_Vale_Tudo_Championship_IVC_?oid=1016&amp;tab=0#events|publisher=MMA-Core|title=-|accessdate=22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first events were [[Vale Tudo|no holds barred]] contests inspired by the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Greg Downey|title=The Information Economy In No-Holds-Barred Fighting|publisher=Duke University Press|pages=396|url=https://mq.academia.edu/GDowney/Papers/320726/The_Information_Economy_In_No-Holds-Barred_Fighting}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gained an international reputation for its hardcore nature. Head butts and groin strikes were not forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Black Belt Vol. 37, No. 6|date=June 1999|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rs8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=black+belt+vale+tudo+ivc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3IXZTeekAoer-gaRo4mCAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Head butts render fighters on the bottom in the [[Guard (grappling)|guard position]] more vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Quadros|first=Stephen|title=Black Belt Vol. 37, No. 9|date=Sep 1999|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|pages=126|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nc4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=%22head+butts%22+%22guard+position%22+liability&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1A3gTfTpN4jSsga0lrnJBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22head%20butts%22%20%22guard%20position%22%20liability&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded by Sergio Batarelli, it became one of the most important Vale Tudo tournaments in Brazil during its existence.

After 14 events, the state of São Paulo (where the promotion was based) prohibited the sanctioning of the Vale Tudo fights, and the event entered an hiatus period. In January 2011, during an interview to channel Combate, Sergio Batarelli announced the return of the IVC in mid-2012 with a new ruleset (based on the UFC rules) and acting as a feeder promotion to the UFC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Old-School-Vale-Tudo-Org-IVC-Returns-with-New-Rules-Cage-39527|title=Old-School Vale Tudo Org IVC Returns with New Rules, Cage|work=Sherdog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jana Natya Manch''' (People's Theatre Front; Janam for short) is a [[New Delhi]]-based amateur [[Theatre of India|theatre]] company specialising in left-wing [[street theatre]] in Hindi. It was founded in 1973 by a group of Delhi's radical theatre amateurs who sought to take theatre to the people. Theatre personality [[Safdar Hashmi]] is the best-known figure associated with the troupe.

Janam collects donations after each performance and funds its work in this manner. As a matter of policy, the group does not accept donations or grants from state, corporate or NGO agencies. The company does street as well as open-air proscenium performances, and also occasionally organises talks, discussions, workshops, exhibitions, film shows, etc.

The company has performed its plays in festivals organised by [[Prithvi Theatre]] ([[Mumbai]]), [[National School of Drama]] (New Delhi), Sahitya Kala Parishad (New Delhi), Natrang Pratishthan (New Delhi), Sangeet Natak Akademi ([[Kerala]]), Natya Akademi ([[West Bengal]]) and others.

So far this group of self-trained actors has done over 8,500 performances of nearly 80-odd street plays and 16 proscenium plays in about 140 cities in India. The company has performed outside India once, in spring 2007, when they toured the United States, performing, lecturing and conducting workshops on several university and colleges campuses.

== Early history ==

Janam was founded in 1973 by a group of Delhi’s left-wing theatre amateurs, who sought to take theatre to the people. It was inspired by the spirit of the [[Indian People’s Theatre Association]] (IPTA). Its early plays, though initially designed for the proscenium, were performed on makeshift stages and chaupals in the big and small towns and villages of North India. It also experimented with street skits.

Janam’s street theatre journey began in October 1978. The first play ''Machine'' with lyrical, stylised dialogues depicted the exploitation of industrial labour. Janam has played a significant role in popularising street theatre as a form of voicing anger and public opinion. It has done plays on price rise, elections, [[communalism]], economic policy, unemployment, trade union rights, globalisation, women’s rights, education system, etc. Some of its best-known street plays are ''Hatyare'', ''Samrath ko Nahi Dosh Gosain'', ''Aurat'', ''Raja ka Baja'', ''Apaharan Bhaichare Ka'', ''Halla Bol'', ''Mat Banto Insaan Ko'', ''Sangharsh Karenge Jitenge'', ''Andhera Aaftaab Mangega'', ''Jinhe Yakeen Nahin Tha'', ''Aartanaad'', ''Rahul Boxer'', ''Nahin Qabul'', ''Voh Bol Uthi'' and ''Yeh Dil Mange More Guruji''.

This form of theatre has become a vital cultural tool for workers, revolutionaries and social activists. Street theatre addresses topical events and social phenomenon and takes them straight to peoples’ places of work and residence.

== Safdar Hashmi ==
Safdar Hashmi was Janam's Convenor, who was killed in performance in 1989. The attack on Janam took place on 1 January that year, in Sahibabad, an industrial township on the outskirts of Delhi. The play being performed was ''Halla Bol'', in support of workers' demands. This play, and its previous version ''Chakka Jam'', were both done in support of a seven-day strike of industrial workers in November 1988. A spectator, Ram Bahadur, was also killed in the attack. There were massive protests all over the country following this murder and these protests led eventually to the formation of the Safdar Hashmi Memorial Trust (Sahmat) in Delhi.

Hashmi, a founder member of Janam, was a brilliant theoretician and practitioner of political theatre, especially street theatre. A versatile personality, he was a playwright, a lyricist, a theatre director, a designer and an organiser. He also wrote for children. His film scripts were much acclaimed.  He wrote on various aspects of culture and related issues in journals and newspapers. Safdar was a member of the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)|C.P.I. (M)]]. In recognition of his contribution to the street theatre movement and to the growth of a democratic culture, the [[University of Calcutta]] in 1989 conferred on Safdar the degree of [[Doctor of Letters|D.Litt.]] [[wikt:posthumously|posthumously]].

Safdar was born to Haneef Hashmi and Qamar Azad on 12 April 1954 in Delhi. He spent his childhood in [[Aligarh]] and finished his schooling in Delhi. He did his M.A. in English literature from [[University of Delhi]]. After short stints of teaching in the universities of Garhwal, Kashmir and Delhi he worked in the Press Institute of India and then joined as the Press Information Officer of the Govt. of West Bengal in Delhi. In 1984 he gave up his job to work full-time as a political cultural activist. In 1980, [[Habib Tanvir]] directed the play ''Moti Ram ka Satyagraha'' for Janam.

Every year, Janam and [[Centre of Indian Trade Unions|CITU]] jointly organise an event to commemorate Hashmi's martyrdom at Jhandapur, at the same place where the 1989 attack had taken place.

== Janam after Safdar ==

Since 1989 Janam has been engaged in both street and proscenium theatre (including ''Moteram ka Satyagraha'', ''Satyashodhak'', ''Varun ke Bete'', ''Hum Yahin Rahenge'', ''Ek Aurat Hypatia Bhi Thi''). In 1993 it began a bilingual theatre quarterly ''Nukkad Janam Samvaad'' and also instituted the Safdar Hashmi Memorial Lecture series.

Among Janam’s recent proscenium plays is ''Aazadi Ne Jab Dastak Di'', based on Manini Chatterjee’s book ''Do and Die''. In January 2004, Janam created ''Bush ka Matlab Jhadi'' (Bush is a just a bush!), a multimedia presentation celebrating the anti-imperialist sentiment the world over. The play used giant masks, video projection, and live music to create a hilarious expose of the US-UK role in [[Iraq]], their ambitions of world conquest, and the people’s resistance to it. The play was the outcome of Janam’s collaboration with many artists including Surajit Sarkar (video artist), Arunkumar (sculptor), Kriti Arora (artist), Kanishka Prasad (architect), and Ashish Ghosh (music director). This 45-minute play was commissioned by the World Social Forum in Mumbai.

Later in 2004 Janam produced a proscenium play ''Shambookvadh'' on the question of caste. This play is scripted by Brijesh, has music by Kajal Ghosh, and is directed by Sudhanva Deshpande. The play was invited to the National School of Drama’s theatre festival in 2006, and to the Prithvi Festival in November 2006. In the summer of 2008, Janam produced ''Ulte Hor Zamaaney Aye'', a proscenium play written by Brijesh, with music by Kajal Ghosh and directed by Sudhanva Deshpande. This was a [[black comedy]] about a woman who struggles to get treatment for her husband, who is initially mistaken for a bomb blast victim in a hospital, but dropped like a hot brick when they find out he is actually an industrial worker.

Among Janam’s recent street plays, ''Yeh Dil Mange More Guruji'' is on the attempts of the Hindu Right brigade to destroy India’s secular and democratic framework; ''Aakhri Juloos'' is on the right to protest; ''Yeh Bhi Hinsa Hai'' is a play against the growing violence on women; ''One Two ka Four'' is a reworked version of an earlier play, ''Nahi Qubool'', on the nuclear deal; ''Yeh Hum Kyon Sahen'' is on the conditions of workers in and around Delhi.

== Safar, the mobile theatre ==

In 1997 Janam constructed an innovative and dismantleable mobile theatre, Safar (acronym for Safdar Rangmanch), to take proscenium plays to [[working class]] areas. Safar is a flexible, innovative structure designed by Janak Mistry. It is set up by the actors of Janam wherever they go to perform their large proscenium plays, and is equipped with lights and a sound system. It can be used for a variety of purposes, and various kinds of spaces can be created in it. It can seat about 600-700 people.

== Studio Safdar, Shadi Khampur ==
In 2012, Janam moved into its own space. Located about 6&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Connaught Place, New Delhi|Connaught Place]] is a neighbourhood known as Shadi Khampur, where the group has created a small black box theatre, called Studio Safdar. Janam also has premises on the top floor of the same building, and uses the open terrace to do its own rehearsals. Studio Safdar is envisaged as a space that can used by theatre and other artists to experiment in, create new work, and to show it. The larger idea of how the space came into being and the activities therein within the first year of its establishment are explained by Sudhanva Deshpande in interviews [http://www.mumbaitheatreguide.com/dramas/interviews/15-sudhanva-deshpande-interview.asp here] and [http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/for-the-people/article4539944.ece here]. Next door to Studio Safdar is the May Day Bookstore and Cafe, managed and run by [[LeftWord Books]].

== In popular culture ==
The 1989 Hindi film, ''[[Salim Langde Pe Mat Ro]]'', directed by [[Saeed Akhtar Mirza]], was dedicated to the memory of Safdar Hashmi. The 2008 Hindi film, ''[[Halla Bol]]'', directed by [[Rajkumar Santoshi]], was inspired by his life of founder [[Safdar Hashmi]], and also depicts a scene, where a street theatre activist is shown being beaten by political goons, but turns into a catalyst for public uprising in the film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies.monstersandcritics.com/indiancinema/features/article_1329137.php/Halla_Bol_based_on_Safdar_Hashmi_Santoshi__Interview_ Rajkumar Santoshi Interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415173050/http://movies.monstersandcritics.com/indiancinema/features/article_1329137.php/Halla_Bol_based_on_Safdar_Hashmi_Santoshi__Interview_ |date=2009-04-15 }} [[Monsters and Critics]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Martin Beck''' (July 31, 1868 – November 16, 1940) was a [[vaudeville]] [[theatre]] owner and manager, and theatrical booking agent, who founded the [[Orpheum Circuit]], and built the [[Palace Theatre (New York City)|Palace]] and [[Martin Beck Theatre|Martin Beck]] Theatres in [[New York City]]'s [[Broadway Theatre District]].&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; He was a booking agent for, and became a close personal friend of the prominent magician, [[Harry Houdini]].&lt;ref name=Kellock1/&gt;

==Early life==

Martin Beck was born to a [[Slovakian Jews|Jewish]] family&lt;ref&gt;Klawans, Stuart, [https://forward.com/articles/5466/finding-an-audience-years-of-invisibility/ "Finding an Audience: Years of Invisibility"], ''Jewish Daily Forward'', April 9, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; on July 31, 1868, in [[Liptovský Mikuláš]], a town in northern [[Slovakia]] that at the time of his birth was ruled by the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. He went with a group of actors on the [[SS Elbe (1881)|SS Elbe]] from [[Bremen, Germany]], to the [[United States]] in May 1884, where he worked as a waiter in a [[beer garden]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]].&lt;ref name=upobit/&gt;

He went to [[San Francisco]] with the Schiller Vaudeville Company, then gained [[citizenship in the United States]] in October 1889.&lt;ref&gt;US Passport Applications 1908, 1915, 1921 &amp; 1922&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Orpheum Theatre (San Francisco)|Orpheum Theatre]] in San Francisco was bought by [[Morris Meyerfeld Jr.]] in 1899, he worked with Morris to acquire more theaters. By 1905, Beck was running the organization.&lt;ref name=amex/&gt;

In 1910 he formed the [[United Booking Offices]] with [[Alfred Butt]].

==Influence on career of Harry Houdini==

In the spring of 1899, Beck met [[Harry Houdini]], who was then performing at a beer hall in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]]. Beck saw Houdini struggling with magic, so he made an offer, Beck telegraphed Houdini when he got to his next stop in Chicago: "You can open [[Omaha]], March twenty sixth, sixty dollars, will see act probably make you proposition for all next season."

According to Houdini's wife when speaking to a biographer years later, this represented Houdini's big break in his professional career as a performing magician.&lt;ref name=Kellock1&gt;Kellock, Harold (1928). ''Houdini: His Life-Story; from the recollections and documents of Beatrice Houdini'', Harcourt, Brace Co.&lt;/ref&gt; As Houdini wrote at the bottom of the telegram, which she had carefully preserved: "This wire changed my whole Life's journey."&lt;ref name=amex&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/houdini/peopleevents/pande01.html |title=Martin Beck (1867-1940)  |accessdate=2011-12-15 |quote=Soon after, Beck telegraphed Houdini from Chicago: "You can open Omaha March twenty sixth sixty dollars, will see act probably make you proposition for all next season." As Houdini later wrote at the bottom of the carefully preserved telegram, "This wire changed my whole Life's journey." |publisher=[[American Experience]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beck and Houdini became close personal friends.  Beck advised Houdini to concentrate on his escape acts, and booked him on the [[Orpheum Circuit|Orpheum]] [[vaudeville]] circuit.  Within months, Houdini was performing at the top vaudeville houses all over the United States, and in 1900, Beck arranged for him to tour Europe.&lt;ref name=Kellock1/&gt;

==Theatre management and ownership==

He built the [[Palace Theatre, New York|Palace Theatre]] in [[New York City]] in 1913.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;

He was voted out of the presidency of [[Orpheum Circuit]] in a [[boardroom coup]] after it went public in 1923. Later that same year, he opened the [[Martin Beck Theater]] in New York City (renamed the [[Al Hirschfeld Theatre]] in 2003).&lt;ref name=upobit/&gt;

On January 28, 1928, [[Orpheum Circuit]] was merged with the theater chain started by [[Benjamin Franklin Keith]] and [[Edward Franklin Albee II]] to form [[Keith-Albee-Orpheum]]. A few months later, [[Joseph P. Kennedy]] and [[David Sarnoff]] of [[Radio Corporation of America]] merged [[Keith-Albee-Orpheum]] with [[Film Booking Office of America]] to form the [[Radio-Keith-Orpheum]] (RKO) movie studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Arthur Frank Wertheim]] |url= http://www.vaudevillewars.com/media-kit-excerpts.html |title=Vaudeville Wars  |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|accessdate=2011-12-15 |quote=In December 1927, an agreement was reached to merge the two circuits and its booking agencies into a new holding company, the Keith-Albee-Orpheum Corporation (KAO). ... }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932 he managed the booking office at [[RKO]]. In 1934 he brought the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] from London to America.&lt;ref name=amex/&gt;

'''''More Fool Me: A Memoir''''' is the 2014 autobiography of [[Stephen Fry]]. The book is a continuation from the end of his 1997 publication, ''[[Moab is my Washpot|Moab Is My Washpot: An Autobiography]]'', and the 2010 ''[[The Fry Chronicles|The Fry Chronicles: An Autobiography]]''. It contains an overview of these previous two volumes, and an account of Fry's later cocaine addiction, chiefly covering the years 1986–93. Other major topics include Fry's writing of ''[[The Hippopotamus]]'', his work on the TV series ''[[A Bit of Fry &amp; Laurie]]'', ''[[Jeeves and Wooster]]'' and ''[[Blackadder Goes Forth]]''; the radio series ''[[Saturday Night Fry]]''; and the films ''[[Peter's Friends]]'' and ''[[Stalag Luft (film)|Stalag Luft]]''. The book is Fry's tenth, and his third volume of autobiography. 

Critical reception has been mixed but generally negative, citing Fry's reuse of material from earlier works, lack of emotional depth, and his depiction of heavy drug taking.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/10/critical-eye-book-review-roundup Critical Eye: Book Review Roundup], ''The Guardian''. 10 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rahim, Sameer [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/11123789/More-Fool-Me-by-Stephen-Fry-review-an-addiction-to-applause.html An Addiction to Applause], ''The Telegraph''. 26 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, Christopher [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2775861/What-conceited-COKE-HEAD-Stephen-Fry-s-latest-book-reads-amid-crass-dropping-like-love-letter-class-A-drug-Why-IS-talented-man-lout.html What a Conceited Coke Head], ''The Daily Mail''. 10 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Museum Madness''''' is an educational computer game for MS-DOS and Macintosh developed by [[Novotrade]] for [[MECC]], and was released in 1994. The game is based in an [[United States|America]]n natural history museum and aims to teach the player many aspects of history such as [[technology]], [[geology]], [[space]], [[History of the United States|American history]], and [[prehistory]]. [[PC Magazine]] described the game as having kids learn about educational topics (i.e. ecology) while making [[logical deduction]]s in a series sequence and solving puzzles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Gift for Giving |author=Ehrenman, Gayle C. |date=1994-12-06 |publisher=[[PC Magazine]] |page=492 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PITtFPwTaWwC&amp;lpg=RA1-PA492&amp;dq=&amp;pg=RA1-PA492#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[File:Museum-Madness-game-screenshot.png|thumb|right|alt=A screenshot from the DOS version of Museum Madness showing the player character and MICK the robot at the "Salem Witch Trials" museum exhibit.|The player (at right, with red cap) and MICK listening to an animatronic historical character in the [[Salem Witch Trials]] exhibit (DOS version.)]]The game starts in the bedroom of an [[United States|American]] [[high school]] [[teenage]] [[boy]] who is seated at his computer, attempting to access the National Museum Interactive Service System, only to see that it is offline for repair. An interactive [[robot]] from the museum named MICK (Museum Interactive Computer Kiosk) appears onscreen and talks to the boy, explaining that the museum is in danger of losing its secrets forever.

The boy appears to have an extraordinary relationship with MICK as he alone understands that MICK can talk back to him, which he uses to learn more about the contents of the museum. MICK recognizes this understanding and thus asks the boy for help to save the museum. MICK explains that the exhibits have come to life and are acting very strangely. He announces his suspicion that a virus has infected the system while the museum was being converted to complete autonomous computer control.

The player takes the role of the boy and enters the museum. Through the game, the boy visits each of the exhibits, solving mysteries and puzzles by talking to the historical characters, rearranging objects, trading objects with characters and generally putting things back the way they were.

The game is educationally-based, and the player learns both from the many museum-like information cards placed throughout the exhibits, as well as from solving the problems in the exhibits themselves. Along the way, the boy is aided by MICK, who follows him through the exhibits, instructs him and gives additional help and advice on request.

Once the 25 exhibits are restored, the virus itself must be destroyed, which is the final puzzle to be solved.

==Exhibits &amp; Objectives==
The exhibits in the museum, which can be entered by clicking a box on the map in the Main Hall, and can be revisited if not completed (the user can exit an exhibit at any time and return later), are shown by the map to be split into five sections:

*[[Robots]]: An out-of-control robot has built itself with stolen parts from the machines in the exhibit, which must be returned.
*[[Computer]] Technology: The exhibit computer's circuits are messed up, and must be repaired.
*Discovery of [[Radio]]: The protagonist must help [[Guglielmo Marconi]], [[Heinrich Hertz]], [[Alexander Graham Bell]] and [[Reginald Fessenden]] with their experiments so they can share their devices and invent the radio.
*[[Energy]] Technology: The energy sources (polluting and non-polluting) are out of balance, and must be restored to their right values to save the exhibit's ecology.
*Simple [[Machines]]: An animatronic [[kangaroo]] is stuck on a high shelf after destroying the exhibit's machines, and the protagonist must fix them in order to rescue the kangaroo.
*How Big is the [[Universe]]?
*The [[Solar System]]: Five stars in the exhibit are out of place, and must be returned to their right positions.
*[[Rocket]]s and [[Computers]]
*[[Aircraft|Air-Powered Flight]]: The giant fan in the exhibit has blown all the aircraft away, including the [[airship]], so the protagonist must clean up the mess and put everything in their right places.
*[[Wright Brothers]]: The Wright Brothers are having trouble inventing the airplane, so the protagonist must help them.
*[[Transcontinental Railroad]]
*[[Salem Witch Trials]]: The virus has deleted the proof that [[Sarah Good]], who has been convicted of witchcraft, did not create three specters the other women of [[Salem Village]] have seen, so the protagonist must prove it himself.
*[[American Revolutionary War]]: The virus has scrambled the animatronic [[George Washington]]'s memories, causing him to support the British oppression instead. The protagonist must find the various documents to convince him otherwise.
*[[Ellis Island]]: The protagonist is put into the role of the immigrants and must successfully reach the U.S. as well as pass his inspection at Ellis island.
*[[Louisiana Purchase]]
*Hall of [[Dinosaur]]s: The virus has infected the exhibit's assembly computer, scrambling the dinosaur skeletons, so the protagonist must re-assemble them properly.
*[[Ocean]] Life: The protagonist must fix a leaking [[sewage]] pipe to restore the exhibit's marine life.
*Hall of [[Animal]] [[Habitats]]: The animals are missing from their respective habitats and must be returned.
*Hall of [[Ecology]]
*[[Geological history of Earth|The Earth's Geology]]
*[[Prehistoric]] People: The animatronic [[woolly mammoth]] has escaped from its pen, and the protagonist must get the cave people to help lure it back.
*The [[History of writing|Development of Writing]]: the protagonist must collect notes from all the writing in the exhibit to help a scribe translate a message left to him by his master.
*[[Knights]], [[Heraldry]] and [[Jousting]]
*[[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s Telescope: Galileo is missing the components of his telescope, so the protagonist has to gather them from the rest of the exhibit.
*[[Industrial Revolution]]

==Order of gameplay==
The player begins by entering the museum through the basement, working out the basement door's [[passcode]]. The player navigates the way into the Main Hall of the museum by a series of numbered doors with corresponding keys which are to be located in the [[maze]] of the [[basement]] (this introductory location can be skipped if desired).

Once in the Main Hall, the player must locate some [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] to power MICK, which can be found in one of the museum tour tape players. Additionally, the map of the museum on the wall in the Main Hall is found to be in pieces and needs to be reconstructed in order to continue.

Then the player must choose an exhibit to try to repair, using the museum's map to select one. After attempting to repair an exhibit, the player is returned to the Main Hall to select another exhibit. Not until every single one of the exhibits has been returned to normal can the player progress in the [[game]].

When each of the exhibits have been restored, the player returns to the Main Hall to find MICK missing and a [[cassette tape]] in his place on the floor. Using one of the museum tape players from which the batteries used to power MICK were borrowed, the player can listen to the tape (shown as on-screen text), which consists of a message from MICK warning the player to go [[home]]; the player decides to follow MICK into the basement and finds him in pieces on a bench in the workshop. Upon reassembling MICK, the player must then access the computer to try to stop the virus by answering general knowledge questions. If the player is successful, the [[virus]] self-destructs and the museum is saved, and the game is complete.

'''''Nex Machina''''' is a [[shoot 'em up]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Housemarque]]. The game was released in June 2017 for the [[PlayStation 4]] [[video game console]] and [[Windows]]-based [[personal computer]]s. Tentatively known as ''The Jarvis Project'' during development, veteran [[arcade game]] designer [[Eugene Jarvis]] served as a creative consultant on the project.

==Gameplay==
''Nex Machina'' is a twin-stick [[shoot 'em up]] [[video game]] played from a [[Video game graphics#Top-down perspective|top-down perspective]].&lt;ref name="polygon_vid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eurogamer_reveal" /&gt; Players move through rooms shooting waves of enemies while attempting to save humans.&lt;ref name="polygon_vid" /&gt; [[Power-up]]s and weapon upgrades are dispersed throughout levels.&lt;ref name="polygon_vid" /&gt;

==Development==
[[File:Eugene Jarvis at CA Extreme 2016.jpg|thumb|Jarvis in 2016]]
''Nex Machina'' was developed by Finnish video game studio [[Housemarque]] with designer [[Eugene Jarvis]] serving as a creative consultant.&lt;ref name="engadget_interview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="polygon_vid" /&gt;  Jarvis is known for his role in designing [[arcade game|arcade]] shoot 'em ups such as ''[[Defender (1981 video game)|Defender]]'' (1981), ''[[Robotron: 2084]]'' (1982), and ''[[Smash TV]]'' (1990).&lt;ref name="polygon_vid" /&gt; At the 2014 [[D.I.C.E. Awards]], Housemarque's founders Ilari Kuittinen and Harri Tikkanen met with Jarvis and asked him if he would be interested in collaborating on a game.&lt;ref name="engadget_interview" /&gt; Jarvis' games, particularly ''Defender'', were a source of inspiration for Housemarque's 2013 game ''[[Resogun]]''.&lt;ref name="edge_303" /&gt; For the design of ''Nex Machina'', they combined elements from Jarvis' previous shoot 'em ups and ''Resogun''.&lt;ref name="engadget_interview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="polygon_vid" /&gt; The development team experimented with different setups for the game's firing mechanics.&lt;ref name="edge_303" /&gt; They followed a different design philosophy than their 2016 game ''[[Alienation (video game)|Alienation]]'' by choosing not to incorporate character progression systems in ''Nex Machina''.&lt;ref name="edge_303" /&gt;

''Nex Machina'' is powered by a significantly enhanced version of the [[game engine]] and [[voxel]] technology that was used for ''Resogun''.&lt;ref name="edge_303" /&gt;&lt;ref name="engadget_interview" /&gt; The inclusion of a volumetric rendering technique known as Signed Distance Fields allows for a smooth transition between complex [[Polygon mesh|3D meshes]] and voxel particles to give them more flexibility in how objects appear on the screen.&lt;ref name="edge_303" /&gt; The studio dubbed their art style for the game as cablepunk—a darker take on [[cyberpunk]].&lt;ref name="engadget_interview" /&gt;

==Release==
''Nex Machina'' was unveiled at the [[PlayStation Experience]] in December 2016.&lt;ref name="polygon_vid" /&gt; Housemarque signed a deal with [[Sony Interactive Entertainment]] to bring the game to the [[PlayStation 4]] [[video game console]].&lt;ref name="engadget_interview" /&gt; In March 2017, Housemarque announced that the game will also be released on [[Windows]]-based [[personal computer]]s.&lt;ref name="videogamer_pc" /&gt; ''Nex Machina'' was released on 20 June 2017;&lt;ref name="eurogamer_release" /&gt; it is Housemarque's first self-published game.&lt;ref name="engadget_interview" /&gt; Housemarque is also considering creating a ''Nex Machina'' [[arcade cabinet]] with Jarvis' company [[Raw Thrills]].&lt;ref name="engadget_interview" /&gt;

'''NoFit State Circus''' is a contemporary [[circus]] company based in [[Cardiff]], Wales.

Formed in 1986, NoFit State Circus have been a mainstay of new and [[contemporary circus]] in the United Kingdom since their inception, and have toured tented and theatrical shows at home and abroad. They also maintain an active education programme and run community projects that allow non-professional performers to devise circus work, working alongside the company's own professionals. 

The company's first large-scale show ''Immortal'' was described by the Scotsman newspaper as circus that "celebrates the human soul rather than just the human body",&lt;ref&gt;Roger Cox. [http://living.scotsman.com/features/Nofit-State-Circus--Immortal.2804095.jp The Scotsman. Retrieved 28 July 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; and elsewhere lauded as "rich, powerful stuff [...] overwhelming in its diversity of ideas".&lt;ref&gt;Tony Layton. [http://www.britishtheatreguide.info/reviews/NFSC-rev.htm The British Theatre Guide]. Retrieved 28 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''[[The Times]]'', dance critic Donald Hutera gave a more measured response, saying that it was better to "surrender to the show's deceptively shambolic quicksilver atmosphere"&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Hutera]]. The Times review, duplicated on the [http://www.nofitstate.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=60&amp;Itemid=45 NoFit State website]. Retrieved 28 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; than concentrate overmuch on the plot. ''Immortal'' won a [[Tap Water Award]], an Editor's Choice Award from threeweeks.co.uk, and The Jury Award at Spain's [[Tarrega Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatr-cymru.co.uk/news/newsdetail.asp?newsID=2001 NoFit State Circus and Meltdown]. Retrieved 28 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 

NoFit State's next show, ''Tabú'', premiered at Tredegar Park, Newport in April 2008, and has been touring Britain and Europe in the time since. Directed by [[Firenza Guidi]], who also worked on ''Immortal'', ''Tabú'' shares much of ''Immortal''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s visual and narrative style, and carries over some of the old cast. It has received mixed reviews. Lyn Gardner writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'' called it "fabulous stuff that owes more to contemporary dance and experimental theatre than it does to sawdust and elephants",&lt;ref&gt;Lyn Gardner. [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/apr/03/tabu-roundhouse-london The Guardian]. Retrieved 28 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; but others have criticised that the live show seems to have "no connection with the programme's bogglingly detailed back story",&lt;ref&gt;David Jays. [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/theatre/article6017593.ece The Times]. Retrieved 28 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the circus skills on display "don't dramatise the original concept".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sideshow-circusmagazine.com/index.php/reviews/9-nofit-state-circus-tabu Sideshow Circus Magazine]. Retrieved 28 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the company developed their show ''BIANCO: Time For Beauty'' in partnership with the [[Eden Project]]. The promenade show, also directed by Firenza Guidi, ran in the tented performance space throughout the summer, and was described by This Is Cornwall as "an incredible experience". The show was then redeveloped to incorporate new ideas, acts and performers in 2013 to become ''BIANCO: Turning Savage''. It opened at [[The Roundhouse]] in April 2013, and was praised by the Guardian newspaper for "combining first-rate skills with a joyful, unashamed pleasure". BIANCO: Turning Savage went on to tour venues across the UK in NoFit State's custom-designed big top spaceship tent, including a sell-out run at the [[Edinburgh Fringe Festival]] in August 2013. In 2014 the show toured to Perth, Australia, and around Europe and will continue touring in 2015.

NoFit State's show NOODLES premiered at the 2013 [[Edinburgh Fringe Festival]]. The production, by Finnish circus director Maksim Komaro, is staged in a traditional theatre setting and received mixed reviews.

The company are also known for their outdoor work. Both ''Parklife'' and ''Open House'' were directed by Orit Azaz, and operate by inviting local amateur and professional performance groups to train in public with NoFit State performers. ''Barricade'', also directed by Azaz, is a large-scale outdoor performance which has played to audiences in the UK and France. The company's most recent outdoor production directed by Azaz is called Open House and combines performance with community engagement.

Since 2006 NoFit State have been running a permanent training space / school in Cardiff. They provide a variety of aerial and ground-based classes for all experience levels, including ropes, silks, aerial hoop, static trapeze, acrobalance and juggling. Their training space also houses Wales' only flying trapeze rig. The company run a successful Youth Circus programme, and students have since gone on to study at [[Circomedia]].

In January 2015, NoFit State was invited to the south of France as a featured company at the first edition of the [[Biennale Internationale des Arts du Cirque]].

On 11 December 2015, the company launched a special 30th anniversary exhibition at its Four Elms building in Adamsdown, Cardiff, as well as a brand new NoFit State E-Archive, which details the company's 30-year history from juggling club beginnings to acclaimed global success. On the same night, the company's co-founder and one of its creative directors, Ali Williams, announced that she was to step down from her current role with the company later in 2016. 

In 2016, the NoFit State celebrates its 30th anniversary.  In February it will make its Chinese Premiere performing BIANCO at Queen Elizabeth Stadium in Hong Kong, and later on in May, the company will make its US debut in partnership with St Ann's Warehouse in New York City.

'''Orquesta El Arranque''' is an Argentine [[tango music|tango]] orchestra formed in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1996.

==History==
Founded by [[double bass]]ist [[Ignacio Varchausky]] and [[bandoneon]]ist [[Camilo Ferrero]] and starting off as a quintet, El Arranque developed a repertoire that was readily embraced by the tango community, and by the end of their first year El Arranque had already performed over 200 shows in Argentine theatres and [[Milonga (place)|milongas]] (tango dance halls). El Arranque's debut album, ''Tango'' (1998), was sponsored by two legendary figures of the tango world, [[Leopoldo Federico]] and [[Nelly Omar]] and brought national and international acclaim. In June–July of that same year El Arranque embarked on their first tour to Europe, performing at Tangomania Summer Festival '98 in [[Bologna]], [[Italy]], in [[Berlin]], [[Stuttgart]] and [[Dresden]]. In December, the orchestra was selected by the Government of the City of Buenos Aires to play for the closing night of the first Festival Internacional de Tango de Buenos Aires with a large outdoor performance on Avenida Corrientes, which was turned into a milonga for the occasion. This event was a huge success for the orchestra and led the Argentine newspapers [[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]] and [[La Nación]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=106920&lt;/ref&gt; to describe El Arranque as “the Tango revelation of the year”.

1999 saw the beginning of a second 2-month long European tour of 12 cities, including London, Paris, and [[Milan]]. In December, El Arranque was invited again to close the second Festival Internacional de Tango de Buenos Aires.

By the year 2000 the group had established itself as the most important young tango orchestra in the world. In October of that same year El Arranque performed at Romaeuropa Festival in [[Rome]], Italy for the ''Tango: Buenos Aires a Roma''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.romaeuropa.net/archivio/eventi/tango/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; series of concerts. After performing in [[Lausanne]] and [[Padua]] El Arranque returned to Buenos Aires to record their second CD, ''Cabulero'', sponsored by [[José Libertella]], founder and director of the prestigious [[Sexteto Mayor]].

In January and February 2001, El Arranque toured fifteen cities in [[The Netherlands]] with the show ''Tango de Buenos Aires''. In March they returned to Buenos Aires to premiere ''Cabulero'', which also includes a music video as its last track. In May El Arranque performed in [[New York City]] with the [[Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra]], directed by [[Wynton Marsalis]]. These concerts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/news.php?id=598 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040220155127/http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/news.php?id=598 |archivedate=2004-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; included original music (Concerto Grosso, for seven tango musicians and a symphony orchestra, and Suite Borgeana, in seven movements) written for both orchestras by both Wynton Marsalis and by [[Ramiro Gallo]], El Arranque's first violinist. In June the orchestra performed at the [[Théâtre national de Chaillot]] in Paris during the Buenos Aires Tango series of concerts. El Arranque ended 2001 with several other performances in Buenos Aires and two more European tours (Festival del Grec in [[Barcelona]], Teatro Trinidade in [[Lisbon]], Festival de Otoño in [[Madrid]] and various cities in Germany).

From January to March 2002, El Arranque played 50 concerts in 40 Japanese cities and 10 in [[Taiwan]] on the famous Min-On Concert Association Tour.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.min-on.org/newsletter/200111/news/en02.html&lt;/ref&gt; In April, the orchestra performed two concerts at the [[Kennedy Center]] in [[Washington, DC]] for the Americartes Festival and returned to Buenos Aires to launch their third CD, ''Clásicos''. This CD has sold almost 10,000 copies in Argentina alone, becoming one of the tango best sellers of 2002.

El Arranque travelled to Europe again in November 2002 to record their first live CD, ''En Vivo en la Rete Due de Suiza''. The concert was held in the famous auditorium of Rete 2 Radio in [[Lugano]], Switzerland. The album came out in two versions, a regular one and one with a full-colour book of photographs and quotes, packaged in a hard cover. The tour continued in Italy, Germany and London, with five concerts at [[Porchester Hall]].

In January 2003 El Arranque toured 10 cities in Norway under the auspices of the Norwegian Concert Institute. In February the orchestra took part in the fifth edition of the Festival Internacional de Tango de Buenos Aires, performing before 20,000 people in Avenida Corrientes. Meanwhile, El Arranque also performed once a week in Club del Vino, a music club in Buenos Aires. That same year the group took part in the production and recording of the new CD of tango singer [[Lidia Borda]], ''Tal vez será su voz'', and in November toured [[Colombia]] for the first time.

In March 2004, El Arranque won the Carlos Gardel Award for Best Tango Recording of 2003 with their live CD ''En Vivo en la Rete Due de Suiza''. In June the orchestra was invited to take part in the 2004 Genova Tango Festival in [[Genoa]], Italy. The special repertoire it prepared for the occasion included works by maestros [[Néstor Marconi]], [[Julio Pane]], [[Raúl Garello]] and [[Mauricio Marcelli]], as invited soloists and composers, with special arrangements by Ramiro Gallo. This extraordinary intergenerational collaboration inspired El Arranque's fifth CD, ''Maestros''. In November 2004&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oac.state.oh.us/News/NewsArticle.asp?intArticleId=146&lt;/ref&gt; El Arranque was invited to the USA to perform in the International Music and Performing Arts in Communities Tour (IMPACT), presented by the [[Ohio Arts Council]] (OAC) in partnership with the [[Ohio Arts Presenters Network]] (OAPN), [[Arts Midwest]] and the [[Pennsylvania Council on the Arts]] with shows in [[Lancaster, Ohio|Lancaster]], [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]], [[Dayton]], [[Cincinnati]], [[Sandusky, Ohio|Sandusky]], [[Springfield, Ohio|Springfield]], [[Urbana, Ohio|Urbana]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Newark, Ohio|Newark]] and [[Dover, Ohio|Dover]] in Ohio and in [[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie]], [[Allegheny College]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allegheny.edu/news/releases/orquesta_el_arranque.php&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Meadville, Pennsylvania|Meadville]], and [[Franklin, Pennsylvania]]. The year ended with performances in [[Chile]] and [[Uruguay]] and the orchestra was nominated for the [[Latin Grammy]] awards.

2005 began with a new tour of Japan, organised once again by the Min On Association, in the wake of El Arranque's huge success in that country. In the space of two months they performed 46 concerts in such cities as Tokyo, [[Osaka]], [[Kyoto]] and [[Sapporo]]. That same year El Arranque also toured Brazil for the first time, performing in important theatres such as Guairão in [[Curitiba]] and Canecão in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. The year ended with a series of concerts in the Solís theatre in [[Montevideo]], Uruguay, performances within the framework of the Joventango Festival, and the opening of the Cultural Carnival of [[Valparaíso]] in Plaza Sotomayor in front of an audience of over 10,000 people.

In June 2006 the orchestra took part once again in the Buenos Aires Tango III Festival in Chaillot National Theatre in Paris, and also performed again in Stuttgart. In September, El Arranque performed in the first Buenos Aires Tango Festival at the Auditorium Parco della Musica in Rome and in the Biennale de la Danse in [[Lyon]]. In December they celebrated their 10-year anniversary with a series of concerts in the club La Trastienda in Buenos Aires, with their colleagues Lidia Borda, Ariel Ardit, Ramiro Gallo and many more who had taken part in the project over the last decade.

March 2007 saw their first trip to [[Hong Kong]] to take part in the 35th [[Hong Kong Arts Festival]]. They also received the Juan Canaro Prize as the revelation in tango of the last decade, awarded by SADAIC. The orchestra then took part for the second time in the XV Llao Llao Music Week in [[Bariloche]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=951323&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, four years after the release of their last album, El Arranque premiered their sixth CD, ''[[Nuevos]]'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.buenosairesherald.com/PrintedEdition/View/9394&lt;/ref&gt; in the 25 de Mayo theatre in Buenos Aires. Its sixteen tracks feature the best original works by El Arranque's own musicians and colleagues of their generation. The album came out in two versions, a regular one and a full-colour hard cover boxed set featuring a snakes-and-ladders cum trivia type game&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1035695&lt;/ref&gt; inspired by El Arranque's various experiences in the world of tango during the last 12 years. The game features miniature cardboard cutouts of the various members of the group and a miniature die, as well as a trivia booklet. In September the orchestra travelled back to Rome to take part in the second edition of the Buenos Aires Tango Festival at the Auditorium Parco della Musica.

On 30 November 2011 they won the Premio Gardel&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mdzol.com/mdz/nota/345224-conoce-todos-los-ganadores-de-los-premios-gardel-2011/&lt;/ref&gt; (Argentina) for Best Album of a Tango Orchestra with their new cd Raras Partituras 6, recorded with Leopoldo Federico.

'''Redux''' is a [[post-positive adjective]] meaning "brought back, restored" (from [[Latin]] ''reducere'', "to bring back")&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'' entry for "redux".&lt;/ref&gt; used in literature, film and video game titles.

Works of literature using the word in the title include [[John Dryden]]'s ''[[Astraea Redux]]'' (1662), "a poem on the happy restoration and return of [[Charles II of England|His Sacred Majesty]]"; [[Anthony Trollope]]'s ''[[Phineas Redux]]'' (1873), the sequel to ''[[Phineas Finn]]'' (1867); and [[John Updike]]'s ''[[Rabbit Redux]]'' (1971), the second in his sequence of novels about the character Rabbit Angstrom.

''Rabbit Redux'' led to a return in the popularity of the word redux and, in ''[[Rabbit at Rest]]'' (1990), Rabbit Angstrom notices "a story [...] in the [[Sarasota]] paper a week or so ago, headlined Circus Redux. He hates that word, you see it everywhere, and he doesn't know how to pronounce it. Like [[arbitrageur]] and [[perestroika]]."&lt;ref&gt;''Rabbit at Rest'', p.50&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has been adopted by filmmakers to denote a new interpretation of an existing work by the restoration of previously removed material. This trend began with ''[[Apocalypse Now Redux]]'', which [[Francis Ford Coppola]] released in 2001, re-editing and extending his original 1979 movie.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}{{Or|date=April 2011}}

The term has also been used by music producers to describe what is more often referred to as a [[remix]] or [[remaster]].

'''Ringling Bros. World's Greatest Shows''' was a [[circus]] founded in [[Baraboo, Wisconsin]], [[United States]] in 1884 by five of the seven [[Ringling brothers]]: Albert, August, [[Otto Ringling|Otto]], Alfred T., [[Charles Ringling|Charles]], [[John Ringling|John]], and Henry.  The Ringling brothers were sons of a German immigrant, August Frederick Ruengling, who simplified his name to Ringling once in America. Four brothers were born in McGregor, Iowa: Alf T., Charles, John and Henry. The Ringling family lived in McGregor, Iowa for twelve years, from 1860 until 1872. The family then lived in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, and moved to Baraboo, Wisconsin in 1875.
In 1907 Ringling Bros. acquired the Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, merging them in 1919 to become [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]], promoted as ''The Greatest Show on Earth''.&lt;ref name=WI&gt;[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Content.aspx?dsNav=N:4294963828-4294963805&amp;dsRecordDetails=R:CS547 Wisconsin Historical Society.

In 1882, before the Ringling brothers created their first circus, the five brothers performed skits and juggling routines in town halls around the state of Wisconsin. Their first show was on November 27, 1882, in [[Mazomanie, Wisconsin]]. They called this the "Ringling Bros. Variety Performance" when they took the show to the next town. With two wandering performers the next year, the brothers toured the Northwest. After the Northwest tour, they used the money earned for suits.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Augustus Ringling Dead. Head of Tented Shows In America Dies in New Orleans. |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1907/12/19/106770654.pdf |quote=When the Ringling Brothers bought the Barnum Bailey show they ... got a monopoly on the circus business in America.

They expanded their acts into a one ring show in 1884. The show added a trick horse and a bear at the end of the season. The circus started traveling by trains in 1888 allowing the show to consistently expand.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Ringling Circus purchased the Yankee Robinson Circus and opened a joint show on May 19, 1884. This brought them to the attention of [[James Anthony Bailey]] of Barnum and Bailey's Circus as a viable competitor. The brothers met with Bailey thus agreeing to a division of areas. This was followed by them purchasing a half share of the [[Adam Forepaugh]] [[Sells Brothers Circus]] from Bailey. Bailey, under the area division, prohibited the Ringlings from playing at the Madison Garden, a location that was the brothers' ambition to perform at. In 1887 Ringling Circus changed its official title to the "Ringling Bros. United Monster Shows, Great Double Circus, Royal European Menagerie, Museum, Caravan, and Congress of Trained Animals."&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

In 1906, Bailey died which led to the Ringlings taking over Forepaugh-Sells, which continued to operate separately. In October 1907, the stockholders of Barnum and Bailey's Circus approved the sale of the circus to the Ringlings.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Due to World War I, Ringlings Circus and Barnum and Bailey's Circus were merged in 1919 as [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]].&lt;ref name=WI/&gt;

'''Shonan Beach FM''' is a radio station owned by the Zushi Hayama Community Broadcasting Company in [[Kanagawa Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. It broadcasts mainly [[Jazz music|jazz]], but also features [[R&amp;B]] and [[Big Band]], as well as a certain amount of [[Hawaiian music|Hawaiian]] and [[classical music]].

Transmitting on a frequency of 78.9&amp;nbsp;MHz, Shonan Beach FM was established on 3 December 1993. Ten years after its launch it had gathered a listenership of around 200,000 in Japan alone and many more via the internet, over which its output is streamed.

Although the station's (minimal) spoken output is in [[Japanese Language|Japanese]], its website does include some information in [[English language|English]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8971">'''Significantly viewed''' (SV) is a classification for [[television station]]s as determined by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) to be local stations that have a significant viewership outside of their [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] [[Media market|designated market area]] (DMA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/uscode/47/5/III/I/340 US Code - Section 340: Significantly viewed signals permitted to be carried]&lt;/ref&gt; Federal legislation was passed to help protect television viewers living in extraterritorial and border areas from losing local television stations where viewers are living outside of the DMA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-05-24A1.pdf Significantly Viewed Legislation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2005, the FCC completed a federal study on all of the media markets in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} It came up with a list of counties in each state where out-of-market television stations are significantly viewed by residents who are using antennas, whether or not they are cable or satellite subscribers. The study also looked at the history of viewership of the original Community Access Television ([[CATV]]) installations throughout the country. CATV is the predecessor of [[cable television]]. Today's cable television content is much more focused on [[pay television|premium channel]] [[television program]]ming than the original purpose of picking up [[local programming]] from television stations in a specific area.

==Today==
With the advancement of [[digital cable]], cable providers such as [[Comcast]] and [[Time Warner Cable]] have begun making headway in removing out-of-market television stations from basic cable lineups. This is done by cable providers to preserve bandwidth on channels 2 to 13, but also to reduce the redundancy of multiple [[network affiliate]]s, and to fulfill federal mandates to keep in-market local affiliates. Some cable providers, with out-of-market and redundant affiliate stations in the past, have moved over the out-of-market stations to digital cable channels 100 and above and in the majority of cases, are not transmitted in [[high-definition television|high definition]] to allow in-market affiliates the prestige of carrying the programming as intended by their networks rather than the [[4:3]] cut seen on standard definition feeds. Many cable providers nationwide are not doing this, since they are removing SV stations entirely from the cable lineup. This has led to some controversy in some parts of the country.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} The forerunners in the SV stations moving over to digital cable have been on-going since 2005{{clarify|date=December 2011}} for several Comcast service areas in [[New Jersey]] and [[Virginia]], and a few Time Warner Cable systems in [[North Carolina]]. The comments against the removals have mainly occurred in significantly viewed counties that are bordering nearby television markets.

===Significantly viewed channel preservation and CATV===
Two examples of the SV channel preservation on digital cable and at the same time, CATV favoring a non-designated DMA is [[Belvidere, New Jersey]] along the [[Delaware River]]. [[Phillipsburg, New Jersey|Phillipsburg]], [[Milford, New Jersey|Milford]], [[Frenchtown, New Jersey|Frenchtown]], and [[Lambertville, New Jersey|Lambertville]], all downstream on the Delaware River, sometimes lean towards this as well. Belvidere used to lean towards the Philadelphia market solely on television reception, since it was not able to receive New York City area stations. However, since it is located in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]], it is officially part of the [[New York City]] television market. When cable providers advanced with premium programming and later digital cable service, the [[Philadelphia]] stations disappeared from basic cable tiers but [[KYW-TV]], [[WCAU]] and [[WTXF-TV]] were later moved to the digital cable tier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/tvlistings/ZCGrid.do?method=decideFwdForLineup&amp;zipcode=07823&amp;setMyPreference=false&amp;lineupId=NJ29506:X Zap2it TV listings guide for Port Murray, NJ Comcast Cable Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Redundant affiliates===
An example of redundant affiliates serving the same area is [[Harrisonburg, Virginia]]. The Harrisonburg DMA consists of two Virginia counties and one West Virginia [[Pendleton County, West Virginia|county]]. Harrisonburg is a fringe area because it is 100 miles from [[Washington, D.C.]]; [[Richmond, Virginia]]; and [[Roanoke, Virginia]]. It was originally part of the Richmond DMA. It is approximately 40 miles away from [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], which is a separate media market that was also once part of the Richmond DMA. Comcast's Harrisonburg system carries two [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliates (in-market affiliate [[WHSV-TV]] and Richmond station [[WRIC-TV]]), four [[NBC]] affiliates ([[WVIR]] out of Charlottesville, [[WRC-TV]] out of Washington, D.C., [[WSLS]] out of Roanoke, and [[WWBT]] out of Richmond), two [[CBS]] affiliates ([[WUSA (TV)|WUSA]] out of Washington, D.C. and [[WTVR-TV|WTVR]] out of Richmond), two [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliates (WHSV's second digital subchannel and [[WTTG]] out of Washington, D.C.).

The Harrisonburg market has only one station for [[PBS]] (in-market member station [[WVPT]]); the market's other network affiliates are WHSV's [[MyNetworkTV]]-affiliated third digital subchannel and a [[The CW|CW]]-affiliated subchannel of WVIR. Prior to 2006, many of these stations were on the same basic cable tier, but were dropped to preserve bandwidth and eliminate the redundancy of multiple affiliates. All of the stations that were not mentioned in the basic cable tier are now moved over to digital cable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://affiliate.zap2it.com/tvlistings/ZCGrid.do?method=decideFwdForLineup&amp;zipcode=22801&amp;setMyPreference=false&amp;lineupId=VA56274:X Zap2it TV listings guide for Harrisonburg, VA Comcast Cable Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

A further example of this is in [[Toledo, Ohio]]; a mere 45 miles from a major market ([[Detroit]]), and close to a second major market ([[Cleveland]]), most of Detroit's signals penetrate deep into the Toledo market, and thus are carried on [[Buckeye CableSystem]]. This is similar in situation to Baltimore (which is close to Philadelphia and Washington, D.C.) and [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]] (which is within range of [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]'s television stations).

A significantly viewed, redundant affiliate may be invaluable to a cable television company in a [[carriage dispute]] if it has the same network but different local owners.

===Controversy===
An example of controversy over residents losing a long-time out-of-market affiliate stations happened in [[Lumberton, North Carolina]]. For decades, the city has been reliant for NBC coverage from [[WECT]] out of [[Wilmington, North Carolina]]. Lumberton has been in and out of different DMAs between the Raleigh, Wilmington, and Florence-Myrtle Beach markets. It is currently in the Florence-Myrtle Beach market since the late 1990s. Parts of the market over-the-air or on cable received a different NBC affiliate, whether it was [[WIS]] ([[Columbia, South Carolina]]), WECT (Wilmington), [[WCNC-TV|WCNC]] ([[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]]), or [[WCBD]] ([[Charleston, South Carolina]]).

The Florence-Myrtle Beach market received its own NBC affiliate in August 2008, when [[Raycom Media]] built and signed on [[WMBF]]. On the day WMBF launched, cable providers were required to drop sister stations WECT and WIS from cable systems in the market. Lumberton residents who subscribed to Time Warner Cable protested the move and pushed to get WECT back on the cable channel lineup; by coincidence, WMBF, WECT and WIS are all owned by Raycom, thus the removal would in effect promote WMBF within the home market over its out-of-market sister stations. This was also in addition to the fact that WMBF's over-the-air signal does not even reach the North Carolina side of the Florence-Myrtle Beach market. On December 1, 2008, WECT returned to Time Warner Cable's Lumberton service area on a digital cable tier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timewarnercable.com/carolinas/support/clu/clu.ashx?CLUID=106&amp;Image1=&amp;Zip= Time Warner Cable Guide for Lumberton, NC]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''spoken game''' is a [[game]] which uses words instead of [[Playing card|card]]s, boards, game pieces, or other paraphernalia.

Spoken games can often also be categorized as [[guessing game]]s, [[word game]]s, or because of their freedom from equipment or visual engagement, [[car game]]s.

Well-known spoken games include [[Twenty Questions]], [[Riddle Me Ree]], and [[password game|Password]]. Because of their nature, spoken games are usually non-commercial.

On March 23, 2017, Lamar shared an [[Instagram]] post of the [[Roman numerals|Roman numeral]] "IV" after deleting his prior Instagram posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/72436-listen-to-kendrick-lamars-new-song-the-heart-part-4/|title=Listen to Kendrick Lamar’s New Song "The Heart Part 4"|publisher=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; That night, Lamar released the song through streaming services.

This is the fourth installment in Lamar's "The Heart" song series. "The Heart Part 1" was released as a loose track in April 2010, while "Part 2" was featured on Lamar's ''[[Overly Dedicated]]'' mixtape, released later that same year. "Part 3," featuring [[Ab-Soul]] and [[Jay Rock]], preceded the release of ''[[Good Kid, M.A.A.D City|good kid, m.A.A.d city]]'' in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2017/03/23/new-music-kendrick-lamar-the-heart-part-4/|title=New Music: Kendrick Lamar – ‘The Heart Part 4’|date=March 24, 2017|work=[[Rap-Up]]|accessdate=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He finishes the song with the line, "Y'all got til April the 7th to get y'all shit together", hinting at the release date for his fourth album (the date turned out to be the day pre-orders opened and the release date was announced to be April 14).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://planetradio.co.uk/kiss-fresh/entertainment/music/kendrick-lamar-upcoming-album-release-date/|title=Kendrick Lamar's upcoming album HAS a release date|publisher=Planet Radio|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song mentions [[Donald Trump]], while media outlets perceived it as a [[diss track]] to rappers [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] and [[Big Sean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.42828/title.whos-kendrick-dissing-on-the-heart-part-4-big-sean-drake-donald-trump|title=Who's Kendrick Dissing On "The Heart Part 4"? Big Sean? Drake? ... Donald Trump?|work=[[HipHopDX]]|accessdate=March 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A portion of the instrumental, produced by [[The Alchemist (musician)|The Alchemist]], is used on the song "[[Fear (Kendrick Lamar song)|Fear]]" from Lamar's fourth album ''[[Damn (Kendrick Lamar album)|Damn]]'' (2017).

==Critical reception==
On the day of its release, [[Pitchfork Media|''Pitchfork'']] named it Best New Track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="The Heart Part 4" by Kendrick Lamar Review {{!}} Pitchfork|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18918-kendrick-lamar-the-heart-part-4/|website=pitchfork.com|accessdate=25 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Eric Renner Brown, Lamar "infuses his boasts of success and wealth with a degree of lyrical nuance that elevates the track."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://ew.com/music/2017/03/24/kendrick-lamar-heart-part-4-review/ |title=Kendrick Lamar's 'The Heart Part 4': EW Review |date=March 24, 2017 |work=Entertainment Weekly |access-date=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Incident''''' is a {{vgy|2010}} [[platform game]] developed and published by Australian studio Big Bucket Software. It was released on August 10, 2010 for [[iOS]] devices&lt;ref name="iOS" /&gt; and on January 6, 2011 for [[OS X]] (via the [[Mac App Store]]).&lt;ref name="OS" /&gt;

==Gameplay==
[[File:The Incident Screenshot.png|thumb|left|The player, climbing the growing pile of falling items, is nearing a checkpoint (represented by a rope of flags). On the left, a "curse" ballon floats up; on the right, a "boost" power-up.]]
Two game modes are available for play in the game: a level-by-level campaign, titled "The Rise and Fall of Frank Solway", and an endless mode, titled "Endless Nightfall".

The basic gameplay involves random objects falling from the sky, as the player tries to avoid getting hit. Control is by means of tilting the device to move left or right and tapping on the [[touchscreen]] to jump.&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt; As the game progresses, the pile of objects gets taller, and less stable. At random intervals, diamonds will fall that grant the player an [[1-up|extra life]] if collected; each level has a certain number of diamonds and the amount collected is recorded on the stage select screen. As well as falling diamonds, balloons arise from below the pile, carrying [[power-up]]s, such as coins (ten coins gives the player an extra life), a protective helmet that shields the player from damage for a limited time, an extra health unit (which cannot be replenished once lost), an item that scrolls the screen up or down, or a skull that damages the player (referred to as an "Ancient Curse").&lt;ref name="KotakuReview"/&gt; If the player finds himself stuck in the middle of the pile, he can attempt to shake the device to form a bubble and float back to the top.&lt;ref name="1up" /&gt; However, this is an unreliable feature.

"The Rise and Fall of Frank Solway" contains 7 levels, in which the player is required to climb 130 meters for the first five stages and 100 meters for the final two. To aid in this, several checkpoints are present throughout each level. Once a checkpoint is crossed, the player can restart from that position if he dies, with one replenished health unit.

Death can occur by the player being pushed off-screen by the pile or losing all health units. Items that kill the player are recorded in a museum and shown by name on the death screen (e.g. "Death by Taxi").

==Plot==
Frank Solway, an [[average Joe]], is having an ordinary day. As he tries to hail a cab, he notices that the streets are eerily empty. He then notices something above him — which turns out to be a cab falling from the sky. He dodges it, only to find more objects of all descriptions raining down on him: sofas, houseplants, vending machines, pianos. Frank keeps dodging the falling debris and climbs the ever-growing pile. Gradually he rises above the city, past the nearby mountains, and into the sky, eventually leaving earth's orbit and reaching outer space, where he hopes to discover the source of the falling objects.

Frank eventually floats into a white void with what appears to be a portal in the middle. A slightly older Frank approaches from the other side. It is revealed that the older Frank also attempted to hail a cab, but instead it was sucked into the air, followed by other objects from his world; the portal drew objects from one world and deposited them in the other. Finally the two Franks touch the portal together, causing a bright light to fall on Frank's town, saving his world.

After the game is cleared once, the player can play through it again in "Beard Mode", as the older Frank.

==Updates==
Since its initial release, the game has had two major updates. The 1.2 update allows players to use their [[iPhone]] or [[iPod Touch]] as a controller, while using an [[iPad]] as a screen.&lt;ref name="KotakuWhatsNew"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/#!5667074/whats-new-in-the-incident-12 |title=What's New In The Incident 1.2? |publisher=[[Kotaku]] |first=Michael|last= McWhertor |date=October 18, 2010 |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1.3 update allows players to use a video cable with a suitable adapter attached to the iPad's [[Dock connector#Apple|dock connector]] to play the game on a television set or computer monitor, with the graphics reformatted to fit a [[High-definition television|HDTV]] screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigbucketsoftware.com/2010/11/10/the-incident-1-3-making-it-work/|title=The Incident 1.3: Making It Work|publisher=Big Bucket Software|first=Matt|last= Comi|date=November 10, 2010|accessdate=April 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Incident'' was met with mainly positive reviews. The iOS version holds an aggregate score of 82 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]], based on sixteen reviews,&lt;ref name="MC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/the-incident|title=The Incident for iOS |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=July 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 85.71% on [[GameRankings]], based on seven reviews.&lt;ref name="GR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamerankings.com/iphone/605016-the-incident/index.html|title=The Incident (iOS) |publisher=[[GameRankings]] |accessdate=July 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The graphical style of the game, which was designed to emulate [[History of video game consoles (third generation)|8-bit games]], has been widely praised. [[Kotaku]] called it "attractively visually designed."&lt;ref name="KotakuReview" /&gt; TouchGen saw it as "a visual homage to games of yesteryear."&lt;ref name="TouchGen"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.touchgen.net/the-incident-retro-goodness-coming-soon |publisher= TouchGen |first= Nigel |last=Wood |date= August 6, 2010 |title= The Incident - retro goodness coming soon|accessdate=July 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Boing Boing's Brandon Broyer referred to it as "a simple idea executed with fantastic style."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.boingboing.net/2010/04/27/the-incident-a-game.html |publisher=Boing Boing |first= Brandon|last= Broyer |date= April 27, 2010 |title= The Incident: a game of 8-bit cataclysm|accessdate=July 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gamezebo]] wrote "the retro 8-bit presentation absolutely sparkles."&lt;ref name="Gamezebo" /&gt;

Kotaku's editor Michael McWhertor was impressed with the overall game. He criticized the high difficulty near the end, but concluded that "it was the game's more clever references that appealed to me more than its graphics. There are amusing nods to films like ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Back to the Future]]'' and pop culture sources like ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' and ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''. ''The Incident'' tickles your geek side expertly."&lt;ref name="KotakuReview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/#!5625485/the-incident-review-its-a-happening--it-freaks-me-out |title=The Incident Review: It's A Happening &amp; It Freaks Me Out |publisher=[[Kotaku]] |first=Michael|last= McWhertor |date=August 30, 2010 |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; McWhertor later referred to the game as "one of my favorite iPhone games of 2010", stating "I'm still surprisingly wowed by the option for wireless iPhone control."&lt;ref name="KotakuWhatsNew"/&gt;

[[Gamezebo]]'s Jim Squires scored the game 8 out of 10, writing "players looking for an accessible yet frantic arcade-style experience are going to really dig what ''The Incident'' has to offer [...] If you're looking for a new experience with old school arcade-style simplicity, ''The Incident'' is one item you'll want to catch." They also praised the music and sound design.&lt;ref name="Gamezebo"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gamezebo.com/iphone-games/incident/review|publisher= [[Gamezebo]] |first= Jim |last=Squires|date= August 10, 2010 |title= The Incident Review |accessdate=July 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]]'s Levi Buchanan rated the game 7.5 out of 10, writing "''The Incident'' is a prime example of how the best iPhone games are simple ideas, perfectly executed. The climb from the street to the stars is terrifically fun and addictive."&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wireless.ign.com/articles/111/1111752p1.html|publisher= [[IGN]] |first= Levi |last=Buchanan|date= August 11, 2010 |title= The Incident Review |accessdate=July 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; TouchGen's Nigel Wood scored it 4.5 out of 5, writing "''The Incident'' is an incredibly cool game, delivering addictive arcade platforming wrapped in classic packaging. It's a budget beauty!"&lt;ref name="TouchGen" /&gt;

[[Pocket Gamer]]'s Tracy Erickson scored the game 7 out of 10, arguing that it was enjoyable in the short term only; "''The Incident'' is entertaining for a few short minutes, yet its one-dimensional gameplay limits the long-lasting fun [...] An amusing game of evasion, ''The Incident'' holds little in the way of lasting appeal."&lt;ref name="pocket"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPhone/The+Incident/review.asp?c=22757|publisher= [[Pocket Gamer]] |first= Tracy |last=Erickson|date= August 11, 2010 |title= The Incident Review |accessdate=July 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cole Jones of [[1UP.com|1UP]] rated it B+, feeling the gameplay became somewhat repetitive; "if you try to play for a couple hours straight, its repetitive nature starts to shine through. You'll enjoy this clever platformer, but only in short spurts."&lt;ref name="1up"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.1up.com/reviews/the-incident-review |publisher= [[1UP.com]] |first= Cole |last=Jones |date= August 19, 2010 |title= The Incident Review |accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tumba francesa''' is a secular Afro-Cuban genre of [[dance]], [[song]], and drumming that emerged in [[Oriente Province|Oriente]], [[Cuba]]. It was introduced by slaves from [[Haiti]]—then a French colony known as [[Saint-Domingue]]—whose owners resettled in Cuba's eastern regions following the [[Haitian Revolution|slave rebellion]] during the 1790s. The genre flourished in the late 19th century with the establishment of ''sociedades de tumba francesa'' (tumba francesa societies), of which only three survive.

==Characteristics==
Tumba francesa combines musical traditions of [[West Africa]]n, [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]], [[Music of France|French]] and [[Music of Spain|Spanish]] origin. Cuban ethnomusicologists agree that the word "tumba" derives from the [[Bantu language|Bantu]] and [[Mandinka language|Mandinka]] words for drum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ortiz |first=Fernando |authorlink=Fernando Ortiz Fernández |title=Los instrumentos de la música afrocubana, Vol. IV|date=1954|publisher=Cárdenas y cía|location=Havana, Cuba|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alén|first1=Olavo|title=La música en las sociedades de tumba francesa|date=1986|publisher=Casa de las Américas|location=Havana, Cuba|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Cuba, the word tumba is used to denote the drums, the ensembles and the performance itself in tumba francesa.&lt;ref name="Ramos"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ramos Venereo|first1=Zobeyda|editor1-last=Kuss|editor1-first=Malena|title=Music in Latin America and the Caribbean: An Encyclopedic History, Vol. 2|date=2007|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin, TX|pages=265–280|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uspTNzJ_NoYC|chapter=Haitian Traditions in Cuba}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instrumentation===
Tumbas francesas are directed by a mistress of ceremonies called ''mayora de plaza''. Performances generally begin with improvised solo singing in a mixture of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Haitian Creole|French patois]] termed ''kreyol cubano'' or ''patuá cubano'' by the lead vocalist (''composé'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Figueroa Arencibia|first1=Vicente Jesús|last2=Ourdy|first2=Pierre Jean|title=Contacto lingüístico español-kreyol en una comunidad cubano-haitiana de Santiago de Cuba|journal=Revista Internacional de Lingüística Iberoamericana|date=2004|volume=2|issue=2|pages=41–55|jstor=41678051}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the introduction, the [[catá]] (a wooden cylindrical idiophone struck with two [[palitos|sticks]]) is played, and the ''composé'' alternates [[call and response (music)|call and response]] singing with a group of female vocalists (''tumberas'').&lt;ref name="Ramos" /&gt; After the catá establishes the beat, the three tumbas are played. The tumbas are single-headed hand drums; from largest to smallest they are called premier (or manma), bulá and segón. The premier is now commonly called quinto, as it fulfills the same lead, improvisatory role as the [[quinto (drum)|quinto]] does among the [[conga]] drums in [[Cuban rumba]].&lt;ref name="Ramos" /&gt; In the toque masón, a double-headed bass drum called tamborita (or simply tambora) establishes the rhythm together with the catá. In addition, a [[shaker (instrument)|shaker]] called chachá or maruga is commonly played by the ''tumberas'' and the ''mayora'' throughout the performance.&lt;ref name="Ramos" /&gt; The structure of tumba francesa is related to an eastern type of [[Cuban rumba]] called [[tahona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Orovio|first1=Helio|title=Cuban Music from A to Z|date=2004|publisher=Tumi|location=Bath, UK|page=208|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XGzKzOH9vawC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toques===
There are three main ''toques'', or types of tumba performance, each associated with a specific dance.

*Masón. This is the first toque. It features the whole music ensemble and is associated with a [[quadrille]]-style dance similar to the [[contradanza]].
*Yubá. This ''toque'' follows the masón and involves the catá and the three tumbas. It is accompanied by the main tumba dance, which is improvised. There are two subtypes of yubá: macota and cobrero.&lt;ref name="Ramos" /&gt;
*Frenté (or fronté). Originally the final section of the yubá, this is now considered an individual ''toque''. It involves the catá, the premier and the bulá.&lt;ref name="Ramos" /&gt; It is played in front of the drums, hence the name.

An additional toque called ''cinta'' is only performed in [[Santiago de Cuba]]. It is called so because the performance takes place around a tree trunk with coloured bands (''cintas''), which are red, white and blue.

===Dance===
The dance in tumba francesa is similar to Haitian [[Affranchi (dance)|affranchi]], which involves a series of straight-backed, held-torso, French style figures followed by African improvisation on the final set,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BN_49ho6AKkC&amp;pg=PA60 |title=Caribbean and Atlantic Diaspora Dance: Igniting Citizenship |accessdate=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but tumba francesa is danced to drums instead of string and woodwind instruments.&lt;ref name="Daniel"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nhCRJ4u_CYIC |title=Dancing Wisdom: Embodied Knowledge in Haitian Vodou, Cuban Yoruba, and Bahian Candombié |author=Daniel, Yvonne |page=122 |accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clothes of the dancers are colorful and flamboyant.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/RL/00052 |title=La Tumba Francesa |publisher=UNESCO.org |date= |accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Tumbas francesas can be traced back to the late 18th century when the [[Haitian Revolution]] triggered the migration of French colonists from Saint-Domingue, bringing their slaves to the [[Oriente Province]] of Cuba. By the late 19th century, following the abolition of slavery in 1886, tumba francesa societies became established in this region, especially in [[Santiago de Cuba]] and [[Guantánamo]]. Their establishment was in many ways similar to the old African ''cabildos''.&lt;ref name="Ramos" /&gt; Performers identify tumba francesa as ''French-Haitian'', acknowledging it as a product of Haiti which now resides in [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name="Daniel" /&gt; By the second half of the 20th century, tumbas francesas were still performed in eastern Cuba, especially the toque masón. Other toques however are only played in the context cultural associations. Three tumba francesa societies survive at the moment: La Caridad de Oriente (originally La Fayette) in Santiago de Cuba; Bejuco in [[Sagua de Tánamo]], [[Holguín Province|Holguín]]; and Santa Catalina de Riccis (originally La Pompadour) in Guantánamo.&lt;ref name="Ramos" /&gt;

==Recordings==
Unlike other Afro-Cuban genres, tumba francesa remains poorly documented in terms of recordings. The 1976 LP ''Antología de la música afrocubana VII'', produced by Danilo Orozco and released by [[Areito (record label)|Areito]], presents a variety of yubá and masón toques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alén|first1=Olavo|title=Liner notes of Antología de la música afrocubana VII|date=1976|publisher=Areito|location=Havana, Cuba}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Scandinavian folklore|folklore of Scandinavia]], '''Tycho Brahe days''' ([[Danish language|Danish]]: ''Tycho Brahes-dage'';  [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''Tycho Brahedager''; [[Swedish language|Swedish]]: ''Tycho Brahe-dagar'') are [[calendar date|days]] judged to be especially [[luck|unlucky]], especially for [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] work, and important business transactions[ and personal events]. [[Tycho Brahe]] (1546–1601) was a [[Danes|Danish]] [[astronomy|astronomer]], [[astrology|astrologer]],&lt;ref name="Tycho Brahe and Astrology"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tychobrahe.com/uk/astrologi.html | title=Tycho Brahe och Astrology | publisher=The Tycho Brahe Museum | accessdate=October 14, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503102927/http://www.tychobrahe.com/uk/astrologi.html | archivedate=May 3, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[alchemy|alchemist]] and as such achieved some acclaim in popular folklore as a sage and magician.

==Origins==
The idea that certain calendar dates are lucky or unlucky is of ancient origin, going back as far as the [[Mesopotamian civilization]]s.  Tables that identify lucky and unlucky days are sometimes known by the German label of ''Tagwählerei''.  The [[Coligny calendar]] also identifies certain calendar dates as lucky or unlucky, and the Roman ''[[fasti]]'' marks many days and parts of others as ''dies nefasti'', unsuited for the conduct of public business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Dies.html | title=A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities | publisher=John Murray | year=1875 | accessdate=October 15, 2012 | author=Smith, William | pages="Dies"}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contemporary North America preserves a tradition that [[Friday the 13th]] is an unlucky day.  It has been called a "pervasive form of divination" that "is found in all societies which regulate their days and nights in calendric systems."&lt;ref name="Koch"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.academia.edu/493008/Concepts_and_Perception_of_Time_in_Mesopotamian_Divination | title=Concepts and Perception of Time in Mesopotamian Divination | publisher=academia.edu | year=2010 | accessdate=October 14, 2012 | author=Koch, Ulla Suzanne | pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The received idea concerning the origin of Tycho Brahe days was that "Tycho Brahe, the celebrated Danish astronomer of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, was very superstitious, considering certain days in the year pregnant with misfortune, wherefore in Denmark, up to this very day, the laboring class call such days on which they happen to meet with some unfortunate accident, Tycho Brahe's days."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Ancient Scandinavians, their maritime expeditions, their discoveries, and their religion | publisher=Hunter Rose &amp; Co | author=Sinding, Paul O. | year=1865 | location=[http://www27.us.archive.org/stream/cihm_47513#page/n21/mode/2up/search/Tycho+Brahe Internet Archive digitized edition] | pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his travelogue ''A Poet's Bazaar'', [[Hans Christian Andersen]] alludes to the fact that Tycho Brahe died in exile in Prague, observing that "Denmark owns not even his dust; but the Danes mention his name in their bad times, as if a denunciation proceeded out of it: 'These are Tycho Brahe's days!' say
they."&lt;ref name="Andersen"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/h-c-hans-christian-andersen/a-poets-bazaar--a-picturesque-tour-in-germany-italy-greece-and-the-orient-ala/page-30-a-poets-bazaar--a-picturesque-tour-in-germany-italy-greece-and-the-orient-ala.shtml | title=The Poet's Bazaar: a picturesque tour in Germany, Italy, Greece, and the Orient | publisher=Houghton Mifflin | year=1831 | accessdate=October 14, 2012 | author=[[Hans Christian Andersen|Andersen, Hans C.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, no mention of the Tycho Brahe days is actually found in the work of Tycho Brahe.&lt;ref name="Thoren"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Lord of Uraniborg: A Biography of Tycho Brahe | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | author=Thoren, Victor | year=1991 | pages=215 | isbn=0521351588}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They nevertheless are often referenced in [[almanac]]s and recur in Scandinavian folklore.  In the [[Cyprianus]] tradition, Tycho Brahe days are considered unlucky for magical work; several of the spells in the ''Black Books of Elverum'' note that they should not be carried out on a Tycho Brahe day.&lt;ref&gt;Rustad, Mary: ''The Black Books of Elverum'' (Galde Press, 1999; {{ISBN|1-880090-75-9}}), e.g. p. 49, 116-117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stokker, Kathleen: ''Remedies and rituals: folk medicine in Norway and the New Land'' (Minnesota Historical Society, 2007; {{ISBN|0-87351-576-5}}), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

These days were supposed to be unlucky to perform tasks such as getting married, starting a journey, or to fall ill on.&lt;ref&gt;Marryat&lt;/ref&gt;  Some versions claim that Tycho Brahe also identified several days as particularly lucky:
*January 26
*February 9 and 10
*June 15&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tycho Brahe-days|url = http://www.learning4sharing.nu/tykobrahedag-344403.html|website = www.learning4sharing.nu|access-date = 2016-02-22|language = sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some lists omit certain days, or add others; there is no standard list.  One should also note that Denmark was on the [[Julian calendar]] until 1700, when it switched to the [[Gregorian calendar]].&lt;ref name="The Perpetual Calendar"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://norbyhus.dk/calendar.php | title=The Perpetual Calendar: A helpful Tool to Postal Historians | publisher=norbyhus.dk | accessdate=October 14, 2012 | author=Nørby, Toke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egyptian days===
Medieval calendars often contained lists of ''dies Ægyptiaci'', "Egyptian days", that also were held to be unlucky.  The Egyptian days were:
*January 1, 25 
*February 4, 26 
*March 1, 28 
*April 10, 20
*May 3, 25 
*June 10, 16 
*July 13, 22 
*August 1,30 
*September 3, 21 
*October 3, 22 
*November 5, 28 
*December 7, 22
These too were days considered unlucky to begin any enterprise.  Physicians were especially discouraged from performing [[bloodletting]] on the Egyptian days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-egy1.htm |title=World Wide Words: Egyptian Days |last=Quinion |first=Michael |date=Mar 3, 2007 |access-date=2017-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schmitz, Wilh. “Ein Wolfenbütteler Verzeichnitz Der 'Dies Aegyptiaci'.” ''Rheinisches Museum Für Philologie'', vol. 22, 1867, pp. 303–303.

Whilst the American market for video games has declined, it is increasing in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= The South African Game Development Scene: Past, Present, and Future|work=Animation SA|date=|url= http://animationsa.org/articles/south-african-game-development-scene-past-present-and-future|accessdate=2012-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= 31 May 2012: SA Video Gaming Industry Worth R1.7b|work= Cape Business News|date=|url= http://www.cbn.co.za/dailynews/6226.html|accessdate=2012-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= South Africa Game Sales Continue to Rise|work= Gaming|date=|url=http://gaming.do.co.za/articles/localnews/south_africa_game_sales_continue_to_rise.htm|accessdate=2012-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[South Africa]] boasts Expos, relatively big LAN's and a growing community of gamer's. [[South Africa]]'s biggest [[LAN]] event called the NAG LAN&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.naglan.co.za/ |title=Nag Lan |publisher=Nag Lan |date= |accessdate=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the former magazine company moved to Cape Town in 2016 which had an impressive turnout. Another LAN event was held in Cape Town which was only slightly smaller than the NAG LAN with 400 people. Although the gaming community in Cape Town is big, the uncontested giant in South African gaming is Johannesburg, with [[Gauteng]] in its entirety housing more gamer's than the rest of the country.

Plans are also laid out by SuperSport to start an eSport channel with GINX eSports TV as the demand for streaming eSports keeps on growing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mybroadband.co.za/news/broadband/202508-supersport-esports-channel-gets-launch-date.html|title=SuperSport eSports channel gets launch date|access-date=2017-03-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to big tech companies like [http://www.mweb.co.za/games/home.aspx MWEB] and [http://telkomgaming.co.za/ Telkom] whom host local server game servers which improve gaming allot in South Africa. This helps local competitive gaming to improve and bringing the local gaming community together.

One problem that South Africa is undertaking is the struggle to get protection from the government for Game Developers. There is a "ball-passing" going on at the different departments. The Dep. of Trade, Arts and Culture and Sports are still discussing which one will take the authority of handling the rights of game developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fin24.com/Tech/News/sa-gaming-industry-suffering-under-regulation-20160516|title=SA gaming industry 'suffering' under regulation|work=Fin24|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compared to the rest of Africa==
South Africa's video gaming compared to the rest of Africa is unchallenged due to the large number of wealthy South Africans living in cities like [[Durban]], [[Cape Town]], [[Pretoria]], [[Bloemfontein]] and [[Johannesburg]]. With internet infrastructure being more than sufficient to support the sport. With Fibre being almost fully integrated in cities and wealthy suburban areas the growth in online gaming can only be motivated. Video game developing in the country is not doing well, but events and [[eSports]] organizations like [[Mind Sports South Africa]], the Digital Gaming League,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalgamingleague.co.za/ |title=Home |publisher=Digital Gaming League |date= |accessdate=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Orena&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orena.co.za/news/ |title=Orena |publisher=Orena |date= |accessdate=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and LANX&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lanx.co.za|title=LAN X|website=LANX|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; have jumped up in 2015 with the big demand for eSports tournaments and other gaming events in large cities. However, it is only [[Mind Sports South Africa]] that continually holds events in all the provinces and runs school events. With gaming in schools also in the rise,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brendyn Lotz |url=http://www.htxt.co.za/2015/09/17/mssa-to-grow-esports-at-schools/ |title=Mind Sports South Africa to grow eSports at schools - htxt.africa |website=Htxt.co.za |date=2015-09-17 |accessdate=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mind Sports South Africa]] reports that there are now over 30 schools that participate in the official league, with school teams competing on an equal footing with many of the  best private clubs in the country.

Nigeria, Kenya and Uganda are the other top game developers in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/africas-gaming-industry-expert-shares-her-thoughts/|title=Africa's gaming industry: Expert shares her thoughts|date=2015-09-01|work=How We Made It In Africa|access-date=2017-03-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gaming industry is bringing millions of dollars in for their countries per year. This is in all categories of gaming: mobile, PC, Xbox, and PS. Because it was not the culture of the African people, the people are slowly growing into the gaming entertainment.

[[South Africa]] also being dominant in sport in the continent and all over the world, and the country too has made its mark on the [[eSport]] scene as the national [[South African]] team has participated in every [[International e-Sports Federation]] world Championship since 2009 over a varied number of games and platforms. But [[Mind Sports South Africa]] has admitted that the gaming scene needs to mature.

Further proof that South Africa is highly respected is that Thomas Brown  was selected to referee at the 2016 World Cyber Arena (WCA) in Beijing, and that on 31 July 2016 Jason Batzofin  was elected onto [[International e-Sports Federation]] Athletes' Commission.

'''White Wolf Publishing''' is a [[roleplaying game]] and book publisher. The company was founded in 1991 as a merger between [[Lion Rampant (game publisher)|Lion Rampant]]&lt;ref name="RPGNetBriefHistory10"&gt;[http://www.rpg.net/columns/briefhistory/briefhistory10.phtml A Brief History of Game #10: Lion Rampant: 1987-1990], RPGnet (Retrieved 14 June 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''White Wolf Magazine'' (est. 1986 in Rocky Face, GA; it later became "White Wolf Inphobia"), and was initially led by [[Mark Rein·Hagen]] of the former and [[Steve Wieck]] and [[Stewart Wieck]] of the latter.  Since White Wolf Publishing, Inc. merged with [[CCP Games]] in 2006,&lt;ref name="MergerAnnouncement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccpgames.com/en/company/merger.aspx|title=Home - CCP Games|work=ccpgames.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; White Wolf Publishing has been an imprint of CCP hf, but has ceased  in-house production of any material, instead licensing their properties to other publishers. It was announced in October 2015 that White Wolf had been acquired from CCP by [[Paradox Interactive]].&lt;ref name="Paradox"&gt;{{cite web|title=Paradox Interactive Acquires White Wolf Publishing from CCP Games|url=https://www.paradoxplaza.com/news/Paradox-White-Wolf-Publishing/|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "White Wolf" originates from [[Michael Moorcock]]'s works.

==Overview==
White Wolf published a line of several different but overlapping games set in the "[[World of Darkness]]", a "modern [[gothic fiction|gothic]]" world that, while seemingly similar to the real world, is home to supernatural terrors, ancient conspiracies, and several approaching [[apocalypse]]s. The company also published the high fantasy ''[[Exalted]]'' RPG, the modern mythic [[Scion (role-playing game)|''Scion'']], and [[d20 system]] material under their [[Sword and Sorcery Studios|Sword &amp; Sorcery]] imprint, including such titles as the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' gothic horror campaign setting ''[[Ravenloft]]'', and [[Monte Cook]]'s ''[[Arcana Unearthed]]'' series. In order to complement the ''World of Darkness'' game line, a [[live action role-playing game|LARP]] system dubbed ''[[Mind's Eye Theatre]]'' has been published.

White Wolf also released several series of novels based on the [[Old World of Darkness]], all of which are currently out of print (although many are coming back into availability via print-on-demand).

White Wolf also ventured in the [[collectible card game]] market with [[Arcadia (card game)|''Arcadia'']], [[Rage (collectible card game)|''Rage'']], and ''[[Vampire: The Eternal Struggle]]'' (formerly ''Jyhad''). ''V:TES'', perhaps the most successful card game, was originally published by [[Wizards of the Coast]] in 1994, but was abandoned just two years later after a revamped base set, name change and three expansions were published. White Wolf acquired the rights to the game in 2000, even though no new material had been produced for the game in over four years. Since then, several ''V:TES'' expansions have been released, and the game was the only official source of material for the [[Old World of Darkness]], until 2011 when the 20th Anniversary Edition of ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]'' was published and the [[World of Darkness#The Onyx Path|Onyx Path]] was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.white-wolf.com/community/news/white-wolf-release-schedule-2011-2012| title=White Wolf Release Schedule 2011-2012| publisher=White Wolf Publishing|accessdate=2011-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Video game]]s such as ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade - Redemption]]'' and ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines]]'' are based on White Wolf's role-playing game ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]''. There are also several [[Hunter: The Reckoning#Video games|''Hunter: The Reckoning'' video games]].

===Merger and MMO===
On Saturday, 11 November 2006, White Wolf and [[CCP Games]], the Icelandic MMO development company responsible for [[EVE Online]], announced a merger between the two companies during the keynote address at the EVE Online Fanfest 2006. It was also revealed that a World of Darkness [[MMORPG]] was already in the planning stages.&lt;ref name="MergerAnnouncement"/&gt; This game was cancelled in April 2014 after nine years of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/05/world-of-darkness-the-inside-story-mmo-ccp-white-wolf|title=World of Darkness - the inside story on the death of a game|author=Ian G Williams|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Onyx Path===
{{Main|Onyx Path Publishing}}
At [[GenCon]] 2012 it was announced that CCP Games/White Wolf would not continue to produce table-top RPGs {{citation needed|date=October 2013}}. Onyx Path Publishing, a new company by White Wolf Creative Director Richard Thomas, purchased the Trinity games and Scion from CCP and became licensee for the production of World of Darkness titles (classic and new), as well as [[Exalted]]. Onyx Path does not, however, hold a license to the [[Mind's Eye Theatre]] titles.

===Purchase By Paradox Interactive===
On Thursday, 29 October 2015, [[Paradox Interactive]] and CCP announced that Paradox had purchased White Wolf and all of its intellectual properties. [[Tobias Sjögren]] will serve as the CEO of the revived company, which will remain a subsidiary of Paradox. Martin Ericsson, formerly a developer on the World of Darkness MMO, will be serving in the "Lead Storyteller" role for the company.&lt;ref name="Paradox"/&gt;

==RPG Products==
===The "Old" or "Classic" World of Darkness game lines===
The games of this series use White Wolf's [[Storyteller System]].  Several games inspired spinoffs in the form of "historical" [[period piece|period]] settings such as the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]].
{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|
*''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]'' (including the spinoffs ''[[Vampire: The Dark Ages]]''/''[[Dark Ages: Vampire]]'' and ''[[Victorian Age: Vampire]]'')
*''[[Werewolf: The Apocalypse]]'' (including the spinoffs ''[[Werewolf: The Wild West]]'' and ''[[Werewolf: The Dark Ages]]''/''[[Dark Ages: Werewolf]]'')
*''[[Mage: The Ascension]]'' (including the spinoffs ''[[Mage: The Sorcerers Crusade]]'' and ''[[Dark Ages: Mage]]'')
*''[[Wraith: The Oblivion]]'' (including the spinoff ''[[Wraith: The Great War]]'')
*''[[Changeling: The Dreaming]]'' (including the spinoff ''[[Dark Ages: Fae]]'')
*''[[Kindred of the East]]'' (including the spinonff ''[[Blood and Silk]]'')
*''[[Hunter: The Reckoning]]'' (including the semi-spinoff ''[[Dark Ages: Inquisitor]]'')
*''[[Mummy: The Resurrection]]''
*''[[Demon: The Fallen]]'' (including the spinoff ''[[Dark Ages: Devil's Due]]'')
*''[[Orpheus (role-playing game)|Orpheus]]''
}}
In addition to those game lines a series of books was produced under the title ''World of Darkness''.  These provided stand-alone materials for multiple game lines with the focus on a specific region or theme, e.g. ''WoD: Blood dimmed Tides'' (about the oceans), ''WoD: Combat'' (an alternative 'crossover' combat system to resolve contradictory mechanics and add some sophistication), ''WoD: Tokyo'' and ''WoD: Mafia''.

For the Third Edition of ''[[Ars Magica]]'', White Wolf connected that game's pseudo-historical setting to the 'future' ''World of Darkness'' setting.  This was a simple adjustment (since the core premise of both settings is 'Earth as we know it' + 'supernatural fiction is reality') and particularly suited to the 'Tremere connection' between a clan of vampires from the original ''Vampire'' and a House of magi in the ''[[Order of Hermes (disambiguation)|Order of Hermes]]'' (the central organization of ''Ars Magica'' as well as one of the 'Traditions' in ''[[Mage: The Ascension|M:TA]])''.

===The Chronicles of Darkness game lines===
The games of this series use White Wolf's newer [[Storytelling System]].  For over a decade it was also known as "World of Darkness," causing it to be referred to as the "new World of Darkness" or nWoD to distinguish it from the prior line of games. In December 2015, it was renamed "Chronicles of Darkness"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theonyxpath.com/announcing-chronicles-of-darkness/|title=Announcing Chronicles of Darkness!|author=|date=|website=theonyxpath.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; by its new publisher Onyx Path in order to more clearly distinguish the two given Paradox Entertainment's intention to reboot the original setting. 

{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|
*''[[Vampire: The Requiem]]''
*''[[Werewolf: The Forsaken]]''
*''[[Mage: The Awakening]]''
*''[[Promethean: The Created]]''
*''[[Changeling: The Lost]]''
*''[[Hunter: The Vigil]]''
*''[[Geist: The Sin-Eaters]]''
*''[[Mummy: The Curse]]''
*''[[Demon: The Descent]]''
*''[[Beast: The Primordial]]''
}}

===Age of Sorrows===
*[[Exalted (role-playing game)|''Exalted'']]

===Trinity Universe===
*''[[Trinity (role-playing game)|Trinity]]'' ([[science fiction]] and [[psionics (role-playing games)|psychics]])
*''[[Aberrant]]'' (near-future [[superhero]]es)
*''[[Adventure!]]'' (1920s pulp heroes)

===Other===
* ''[[Pendragon (role-playing game)|Pendragon]]''
* ''[[Scion (role-playing game)|Scion]]''
* ''[[Street Fighter: The Storytelling Game]]''
* ''[[Engel (role-playing game)|Engel]]''

==Mind's Eye Theatre (LARP)==
The majority of the Old World of Darkness games were adapted into the original [[Mind's Eye Theatre]] format for live-action roleplaying. Product lines in this era include:
{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|
*''[[Laws of the Night]]'' (formerly ''Masquerade''; based on ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]'')
*''[[Laws of the Wild]]'' (formerly ''Apocalypse''; based on ''[[Werewolf: The Apocalypse]]'')
*''[[Oblivion (role-playing game)|Oblivion]]'' (based on ''[[Wraith: The Oblivion]]'')
*''[[Laws of the Hunt]]'' (focusing on mortals as characters)
*''[[The Long Night (role-playing game)|The Long Night]]'' (based on ''[[Vampire: The Dark Ages]]'')
*''[[The Shining Host]]'' (based on ''[[Changeling: The Dreaming]]'')
*''[[Laws of the Wyld West]]'' (based on ''[[Werewolf: The Wild West]]'')
*''[[Laws of Ascension]]'' (based on ''[[Mage: The Ascension]]'')
*''[[Laws of the Reckoning]]'' (based on ''[[Hunter: The Reckoning]]'')
*''[[Laws of Resurrection]]'' (based on ''[[Mummy: The Resurrection]]'')
*''[[Laws of the East]]'' (based on ''[[Kindred of the East]]'')
*''[[Faith and Fire]]'' (based on ''[[Dark Ages: Vampire]]'')
*''[[Vampire by Gaslight]]'' (based on ''[[Victorian Age: Vampire]]'')
}}
Subsequently, the Mind's Eye Theatre was revamped for the New World of Darkness. A core ''Mind's Eye Theatre'' rulebook was published as the LARP analogue to the ''World of Darkness'' core rulebook, with several Mind's Eye Theatre adaptations following in suit: ''The Requiem'', ''The Forsaken'', and ''The Awakening'' each adapted their respective namesakes to the new system of MET rules. The license to produce Mind's Eye Theatre content was acquired by By Night Studios in 2013.

===By Night Studios===
At Midwinter Gaming Convention in 2013 it was announced that as a result of CCP Games discontinuation of publishing, By Night Studios had acquired the license to all [[Mind's Eye Theatre]] titles. In May 2013, By Night Studios launched a successful Kickstarter campaign&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bynightstudios/minds-eye-theatre-vampire-the-masquerade|title=Mind's Eye Theatre: Vampire The Masquerade Kickstarter|author=Night Studios|work=Kickstarter}}&lt;/ref&gt; to rebuild the Mind's Eye Theatre: Vampire The Masquerade product specifically for the Live-Action Role Play audience. By Night Studios is currently in development of Mind's Eye Theatre: Werewolf The Apocalypse in the same rebuilding fashion as Vampire The Masquerade.

==Fiction==
In the 1990s, White Wolf also published fiction. This included novels and anthologies based on White Wolf's games, as well as general fantasy and horror fiction.&lt;ref&gt; [[Neil Barron]], ''Fantasy and Horror: A Critical and Historical Guide to Literature, Illustration, Film, TV, Radio, and the Internet'', Scarecrow Press, 1999 {{ISBN|0810835967}} (p.431)&lt;/ref&gt; White Wolf printed several [[Elric of Melniboné]] collections by [[Michael Moorcock]].&lt;ref&gt;Diana Tixier Herald, ''Fluent in Fantasy: A Guide to Reading Interests''. Libraries Unlimited, 1999 {{ISBN|1563086557}} (p.20).&lt;/ref&gt; The company also put out general fiction collections by [[Harlan Ellison]], as well as several paperback editions of the "Borderlands" anthologies edited by [[Thomas F. Monteleone]].&lt;ref&gt;"Monteleone, Thomas F(rancis)", by [[Don D'Ammassa]] in [[David Pringle]], ''St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost &amp; Gothic Writers''. London : St. James Press, 1998, {{ISBN|978-1-55862-206-7}} (pp. 414-5).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imprints and labels===
White Wolf has different imprints under which various books are published, most notably:

* Arthaus - products for which White Wolf serves as publisher, not developer
* [[Black Dog Game Studio|Black Dog Game Factory]] - adult themed products (defunct)
* Sword &amp; Sorcery - products compatible with the d20 system by [[Wizards of the Coast]]

Black Dog Game Factory was also a fictional company in the World of Darkness, as detailed in the ''Subsidiaries: A Guide to Pentex'' game supplement.

'''Xintiandi''' ({{zh|c=新天地|p=Xīntiāndì}}, &lt;small&gt;[[Shanghainese]]&lt;/small&gt;: ''Shintidi'' &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt; "New Heaven and Earth",&lt;ref name="Warr A"&gt;Warr, Anne: ''Shanghai Architecture'', The Watermark Press, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-949284-76-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;small&gt;fig.&lt;/small&gt; "New World") is an affluent [[pedestrian zone|car-free]] shopping, eating and entertainment district of [[Shanghai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Christopher | last=Pitts| title=Pocket Shanghai | publisher=[[Lonely Planet]] | isbn=978-1-74179-963-7 | date=April 2013 | edition=3rd | pages=60–61 | chapter=Top Sights: Xintiandi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The district is composed of an area of reconstituted traditional mid-19th century [[shikumen]] ("stone gate") houses on narrow alleys, some adjoining houses which now serve as book stores, cafes and restaurants, and shopping malls.  Most of the cafes and restaurants feature both indoor and outdoor seating.  Xintiandi has an active nightlife on weekdays as well as weekends, though romantic settings are more common than loud music and dance places. It is considered one of the first [[Lifestyle center (retail)|lifestyle center]]s in China. It is also the most expensive place to live in China, with some apartments costing more than Tokyo, New York and London. It is home to the Chinese elite and top executive expats.

Xintiandi is the location of the site of the first congress of the [[Communist Party of China]], now preserved at the [[Museum of the First National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party]].  Also nearby are the [[Shikumen Open House Museum]] and the site of the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea]] when Korea was a Japanese colony.

[[File:Xintiandi gem.jpg|thumb|Renovated shikumen lane in Xintiandi.]]

==Redevelopment==
The area was developed by [[Shui On Land]] during the re-development of the surrounding area. Some houses in Xintiandi were then demolished and rebuilt (not merely "renovated", which was the term used officially by the Chinese government and the real estate agencies&lt;ref name="Xintiandi"&gt;[http://www.consulfrance-shanghai.org/Xintiandi.html Xintiandi]&lt;/ref&gt;), in order to implant an art gallery, cafes, and restaurants. Many tour groups both domestic and from abroad also visit Xintiandi as one of the main attractions in Shanghai.

The Xintiandi redevelopment was designed by [[Benjamin T. Wood]] and [[Nikken Sekkei]] International. The urban renewal is considered one of the first examples of the [[placemaking]] approach in China.&lt;ref name="Xintiandi Architect"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/13/arts/design/13iovi.html Our Man in Shanghai: Ben Wood Takes On History]&lt;/ref&gt;)

This construction displaced 3,500 Shanghainese families.&lt;ref name="Xintiandi"/&gt;

==Transportation==
The closest [[Shanghai Metro]] stations in the vicinity are [[South Huangpi Road Station]] (on [[Line 1, Shanghai Metro|Line 1]]), and [[Xintiandi Station]] (on [[Line 10, Shanghai Metro|Line 10]]).

'''Émile-César-Victor Perrin''' was a French painter, mainly known as a theatre director and impresario, born in [[Rouen]] on 9 January 1814, died 8 October 1885.&lt;ref name="Dean"&gt;Dean W. ''Bizet.'' London, JM Dent &amp; Sons, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; His son-in-law was [[Camille du Locle]].&lt;ref&gt;Budden J. ''Verdi''. London, J M Dent &amp; Sons, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Perrin studied under [[Antoine-Jean Gros|Gros]] and [[Hippolyte Delaroche|Delaroche]], and pursued a career as a [[History painting|history painter]], exhibiting at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]]. In between his appointments at the Opéra-Comique he briefly returned to painting.&lt;ref name="Walsh"&gt;Walsh T J. ''Second Empire Opera: The Théâtre Lyrique Paris 1851-1870.'' John Calder, London, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was director of the [[Opéra-Comique]] from May 1848 to November 1857, then briefly in 1862, when he 'discovered' [[Galli-Marié]] singing in Rouen.&lt;ref name="Curtiss"&gt;Curtiss M. ''Bizet and his world.'' New York, Vienna House, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; From July 1854 to September 1855 he was concurrently director of the [[Théâtre Lyrique]], and during his short tenure the artistic and social standing of the theatre rose, although he resigned, disappointed with the results at the theatre. Wagner described him around this time as "a well-to-do bel esprit and painter".&lt;ref name="Walsh"/&gt;

He became director of the [[Opéra national de Paris|Opéra de Paris]] in December 1862. During this time he employed [[Bizet]] to play through scores submitted to the Opéra, although Perrin did not assist the composer in getting his work performed there. [[Victorien Sardou]] in a letter described Perrin as "the most volatile, the most capricious, the most changeable of men".&lt;ref name="Dean"/&gt; He was dismissed from the Opéra after being accused of insufficient patriotism in May 1870.&lt;ref name="Curtiss"/&gt;

In 1875, he was brought in to arbitrate in a dispute between Bizet and the directors of the Opéra-Comique over the preparations for ''[[Carmen]]'', despite the fact that he loathed the piece.&lt;ref name="Curtiss"/&gt;

He was administrator-general of the [[Comédie-Française]] from 1871 up to his death. In 1876 he became a member of the [[Académie des beaux-arts (France)|Académie des beaux-arts]].&lt;ref&gt;Gourret J. ''Ces hommes qui ont fait l'Opéra''. Editions Albatros, Paris, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;
