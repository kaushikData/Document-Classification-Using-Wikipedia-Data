'''Alkarama''' ({{lang-ar|الكرامة لحقوق الإنسان}} / [[ISO 233]]: {{transl|ar|ISO|al-karāmah li-ḥuqūq al-’insān}} / Dignity) is an independent [[Swiss]]-based [[human rights]] [[non-governmental organization]] established in 2004 to assist all those in the [[Arab World]] subjected to, or at risk for, [[extrajudicial killings]], [[Forced disappearance|disappearances]], [[torture]], and [[arbitrary detention]]. 
Acting as a bridge between individual victims in the [[Arab World]] and international [[human rights]] mechanisms, Alkarama works towards an [[Arab World]] where all individuals live free, with [[dignity]], and protected by the [[rule of law]].

==Organization==

===Mission===
Alkarama is an [[NGO]] defending the victims of human rights violations in the Arab world – including violations of the [[right to life]], to physical and mental integrity, and to Civil and Political Rights – by using in priority [[international law]] mechanisms. Alkarama also helps to promote a culture of [[human rights]] in the [[Arab world]].

Although it recognises the indivisibility of [[human rights]], Alkarama has given priority to the defence of people subjected or at risk of [[extrajudicial killing]], [[enforced disappearance]], [[torture]], and [[arbitrary detention]], as Alkarama regards these violations of the right to life, physical integrity, and civil and political rights as common in this region.

To end these violations, Alkarama cooperates with local and national [[civil society]] activists and [[international organisations]] for the promotion and protection of [[human rights]], as well as governments and other entities likely to act on the [[human rights]] situation.

By engaging international mechanisms, Alkarama offers support and a last resort to the victims of these human rights violations, so that they achieve respect for their rights against the failure or inefficiency of their country's [[justice system]].

Alkarama also works for a strong international system of [[human rights]] protection, which reinforces the regional, national, and local protection systems. In, particular, it contributes to fill the information gaps, and to increase the attention of international [[human rights]] protection mechanisms on [[human rights]] violations taking place in the [[Arab World]]. Alkarama encourages [[State (polity)|States]] to strengthen their national laws to defend and promote human [[rights]].

Finally, Alkarama contributes to the promotion of the culture of [[human rights]], by ensuring that the various groups that make up the [[civil society]] in these countries are familiar with the concept of [[human rights]] and are mobilising around it, know their rights and claim them, and feel protected by law.

Through its projects, Alkarama provides these actors the necessary tools so that they can assert their rights both nationally and internationally.

===Goals===
1. Document and denounce [[human rights]] violations in the [[Arab world]]

2. Provide moral and judicial assistance to the victims of [[human rights]] violations

3. Pursue the perpetrators of [[human rights]] violations and fight [[impunity]]

4. Encourage, and campaign for governments to respect [[human rights]]

5. Spread the culture of [[human rights]] in Arab societies

6. Train [[human rights defenders]]

7. Support any initiative which reinforces the protection of [[citizens]] against [[human rights violations]]

8. Be an effective organization

==Focus==

Alkarama focuses on the most serious [[human rights]] violations, i.e. violations that relate to the [[right to life]], human [[dignity]], [[bodily integrity]] and [[freedom]]. The idea behind Alkarama's specific mandate is that only when citizens are free from the most serious [[human rights]] abuses that individuals can freely and effectively call for all of their rights and ensure the [[rule of law]] in their countries.

===(i) Extrajudicial Killings===

According to the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Every human being has the inherent [[right to life]]. This right shall be protected by law. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[United Nations]] [[United Nations special rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions intervenes on cases of executions outside the legal framework or without the proper legal safeguards: capital punishment following an unfair trial, deaths in custody, deaths due to excessive use of force by law enforcement officials, deaths due to attacks by States security forces, violations of the [[right to life]] in armed conflict, genocide, and the imminent expulsion of persons to a country where their lives are in danger.

===(ii) Enforced Disappearance===

According to the [[International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance]] (CED):

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Enforced disappearance]] is considered to be the arrest, detention, abduction or any other form of deprivation of [[liberty]] by agents of the State or by persons or groups of persons acting with the authorisation, support or acquiescence of the State, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of [[liberty]] or by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the [[disappeared]] person, which place such a person outside the protection of the [[law]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''A tool of repression'''

Many of the governments of the [[Arab World]] use [[Forced disappearance|disappearances]] to silence opposition members and terrorize the population.

[[Algeria]] is a notable example of this practice. Alkarama has presented over 1,000 cases of [[Forced disappearance|disappearances]] to the [[United Nations]] Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances (WGEID). The number of [[disappeared]] in [[Algeria]] is estimated at between 10,000 and 20,000 – the Algerian government admitted to 6,164 in 2005; the Algerian [[national human rights institution]], the Commission Nationale Consultative de Promotion et de Protection des Droits de l'Homme (CNCPPDH) to 8,023.

===(iii) Torture===

According to the [[Convention against Torture]] (CAT):

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Torture]] means any act by which severe [[pain]] or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a [[confession]], punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on [[discrimination]] of any kind, when such [[pain]] or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an [[official]] capacity. It does not include [[pain]] or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Upon receipt of information about cases of [[torture]] from its representatives and [[civil society]] contacts in the [[Arab world]], Alkarama writes a communication to the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations special rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] on [[Torture]] (SRT) with details of the case.

===(iv) Arbitrary Detention===

According to the [[UN]] Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD):

Deprivation of [[liberty]] is arbitrary if the case falls into one of the following three categories:

1. When it is clearly impossible to invoke any legal basis justifying the deprivation of [[liberty]] [...] (Category I)

2. When the deprivation of [[liberty]] results from the exercise of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and, insofar as States parties are concerned, by the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (Category II)

3. When the total or partial non-observance of the international norms relating to the right to a fair trial spelled out in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and in the relevant international instruments accepted by the States concerned, is of such gravity as to give the deprivation of [[liberty]] an [[arbitrary]] character (Category III). (WGAD, Fact Sheet No. 26)

'''Arbitrary Detention in the [[Arab World]]: the [[United Nation]]'s Opinion'''

Arab governments often arrest and detain political opponents and [[human rights defenders]] in order to quiet their criticism of government policies and behaviour. The opinions issued by the WGAD can then be used in local and international [[advocacy]] against these detentions, be brought up with the governments and authorities directly, and can lead to enough pressure to have these individuals released in some cases. Many governments are very sensitive to their international image and [[human rights]] record.

== History ==

=== 2004: Creation of Alkarama ===

Alkarama was created as a Swiss association in July 2004 by Qatari and Algerian [[human rights defenders]] – [[Abd Al-Rahman al-Nuaimi|Abdulrahman Al Naimi]], [[Rachid Mesli]] and [[Abbas Aroua]] – to contribute to an [[Arab World]] where all individuals live free, in [[dignity]], and protected by the [[rule of law]]. With this goal in mind, the founders decided to address the most serious violations of human dignity, physical integrity and freedom, namely [[extrajudicial killings]], [[enforced disappearances]], [[torture]], and [[arbitrary detention]], with the hope that individuals who no longer fear being subjected to these violations can speak and act freely to call for their rights and ensure the rule of law in their countries.

At the time of Alkarama's creation, the [[United Nations]] (UN) mechanisms established to protect human rights worldwide rarely acted upon violations in the [[Arab region]]. Identifying this gap, Alkarama decided that in order to bring these violations to an end, Alkarama would act through the UN’s mechanisms specific to bring these [[human rights]] violations to an end. In doing so, Alkarama would also fulfill its objective to contribute to a better understanding of [[human rights]] and raise awareness of the UN's human rights protection mechanisms in the Arab [[civil society]], including amongst social groups who often viewed these instruments as ineffective or understood rights as Western concepts, in particular Islamist groups, political opposition parties, and journalists.

By acting as a bridge between the victims in the Arab world and the UN Special Procedures experts, whilst building the capacity of local activists to directly access [[UN]] mechanisms and use the decisions they adopt to call for the respect of [[human rights]] in their countries, Alkarama gave itself the means to achieve its two main objectives simultaneously. This involves speaking directly and regularly with victims and their families, lawyers, or local activists to document individual cases of [[human rights]] violations; and submitting these cases to the [[UN]] mechanisms for them to request the relevant government authorities to remedy to the situation.

Between 2004 and 2007, [[Rachid Mesli]], at the time Alkarama's sole employee in [[Geneva]], submitted around 400 individual cases to the UN Special Procedures, leading to these mechanisms' action with a number of [[Arab States]], and a noticeable improvement of the situation for many of the victims. Following up on its successes and growing needs, in 2005 Alkarama recruited Country Representatives in [[Lebanon]] and [[Yemen]] in order to follow the [[human rights]] situation in these countries and document further cases of violations to submit to the [[UN]]. Alkarama's website was launched the same year.

=== 2007: Alkarama Foundation ===

In April 2007, in the face of an ever-increasing workload and in order to undertake the necessary changes in capital and human resources, Alkarama registers as a Foundation under [[Swiss]] law. This change in status aimed to ensure greater stability and transparency, by enabling the Swiss authorities to review the organisation's financial records on a yearly basis.

=== 2007: Working with UN Treaty Bodies ===

As of 2007, Alkarama began working with the UN Human Rights Treaty Bodies – in particular the [[United Nations Convention against Torture#Committee against Torture|Committee Against Torture]] (CAT), the [[Human Rights Committee]] (HRCttee) and the [[Universal Periodic Review]] (UPR) instituted by the newly established [[Human Rights Council]] (HRC) – by submitting alternative information regarding the Arab State's implementation of the relevant treaties at every stage of their review process. In doing so, Alkarama provides the CAT and HRCttee expert, as well as members of the (HRC) access to information from [[civil society]] actors as well as concrete cases of violations of numerous articles of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[Convention Against Torture]] and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR).

=== 2009: Working to strengthen [[national human rights institutions]] ===

In 2009, facing the increasingly negative roles played by [[National Human Rights Institutions]] (NHRIs), Alkarama begins providing independent information from local civil society actors about these institutions to the International Coordinating Committee on (ICC-NHRIs), which regularly reviews the status of these institutions, resulting in a number of reforms within these institutions.

=== 2009: Launch of the Alkarama Award for [[Human Rights Defenders]] ===

Also in 2009, Alkarama launched the Alkarama Award for Human Rights Defenders, a symbolic reward attributed every year to an individual or organisation that has significantly contributed to the promotion and protection of human rights in the Arab world (to read more about the Award and the previous laureates, click here). Through this award, Alkarama was able to fulfill two objectives: to bring attention to the work of Human Rights Defenders (HRDs) in the Arab world, whilst providing the UN, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), the media, and the general public an opportunity to learn about the individual heroes struggling for the promotion and protection of human rights in the Arab region.

=== 2011 (During the "[[Arab Spring]]" and after): Acting as a major relay of information ===

As the events of 2011 began to unfold in the [[Arab World]], Alkarama stood alongside those calling for the respect of their rights and became a major relay of information for the UN mechanisms and the media, on the uprisings in [[Egypt]], [[Libya]], [[Yemen]] and then [[Syria]]. With Country Representatives in [[Egypt]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Yemen]], as well as several visits to [[Libya]], Alkarama was able to closely monitor the violations occurring, reporting them in real time whilst raising awareness amongst the new groups rising to power of their obligation to respect [[human rights]].

===Alkarama Today===

Alkarama today is made up of nine full-time employees in [[Geneva]], and five representatives in the [[Arab World]]. It also trains about 10 interns per year in its Legal or Media Departments.

Although founded in 2004 as a society, since 2007 Alkarama has been a registered Swiss [[Foundation (nonprofit)|Foundation]].

Alkarama is a [[Multilingualism|trilingual]] organisation, publishing material in Arabic, English and French.

==Alleged link to terrorist groups==
As an [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] working on a daily basis with the [[United Nations]] human rights protection mechanisms by submitting to these UN bodies detailed information on serious human rights violations committed by States in the region, Alkarama has often been the victim of defamation campaigns, whilst several members of its staff have been targeted  – in their own capacity and not necessarily because of their relation with Alkarama – such as Executive Director, [[Mourad Dhina]] and Legal Director, [[Rachid Mesli]], both victims of international arrest warrants issued by the Algerian government; as well as founding member and former Chairman of the Foundation’s Council, [[Abdulrahman al-Nuaimi|Abdulrahman Al Naimi]], listed by the [[United States|U.S.]] Treasury as an “[[Al-Qaeda|Al Qaeda]] financier” although the charges were never substantiated.

Among others, on 2 September 2014, the Lebanese newspaper, As-Safir published an article entitled [http://www.assafir.com/Article/1/369665 The Founder of the Cham Al Islam movement, a prominent activist within Alkarama], which openly accuses Alkarama of "supporting terrorism" and "spreading anarchy". In the following couple of days, these allegations were echoed in the Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese information channel, [http://www.almanar.com.lb/adetails.php?eid=953720&amp;cid=31&amp;fromval=1 Al Manar], in Syrian governmental news sites, [http://www.rtv.gov.sy/index.php?d=100284&amp;id=157903 RTV.gov] and [http://thawra.alwehda.gov.sy/_View_news2.asp?FileName=72957552320140903013614 Al Tawra], as well as in Saudi-run news site on Syria, [http://www.day-news.net/news/46963.html Al Akhbar Al Youm]. On 3 September, [[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]], a magazine founded by the [[American Jewish Committee]] in 1945, accused Alkarama of being run by an "[[Al-Qaeda|Al Qaeda]] financier", in reference to Alkarama's Founder, Mr Abdulrahman Al Naimi.

On 14 October 2014, the Swiss newspaper, [[Le Temps]] published an article entitled [https://www.letemps.ch/suisse/2014/10/14/ville-geneve-finance-une-ong-accusee-liens-al-qaida The town of Geneva funded an NGO accused of links with Al Qaeda], which was relayed by other Swiss media outlets. The article relied exclusively on the unproven listing of one of Alkarama’s three founding members as an “[[Al-Qaeda|Al Qaeda]] financier” (see below). A month later, [[Le Temps]] published a [https://www.letemps.ch/opinions/2014/11/20/difficulte-defendre-droits-homme-monde-arabe feature] by Alkarama’s Legal Director, [[Rachid Mesli]], speaking of the difficulty to defend human rights in the Arab World, explaining that in the Arab World, those who dare criticise authoritarian regimes or demand more freedom are accused of terrorism to stifle any criticism or demand to take part in the country’s political life. ''“It is therefore not surprising that Alkarama, which defends victims of this repression, finds itself vilified and attacked by these regimes; that international NGOs such as the [[Council on American–Islamic Relations|Council on American-Islamic Relations]] and [[Islamic Relief]] find themselves on the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]]’s list of terrorist organisations along with [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] and [[Al-Qaeda|Al Qaeda]]; and that the former Chairman of our Foundation, Dr Abdulrahman Al Naimi, a university Professor, a Qatari human rights activist and a former [[Amnesty International|Amnesty]] [[prisoner of conscience]] be banned from several countries – including the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]] and [[Saudi Arabia]],”'' explained [[Rachid Mesli|Me Mesli]].

The current president of Alkarama’s Board of Trustees, Khalifa al-Rabban, is a Founding Member and Member of the Board of Trustees of the Global Anti-Aggression Campaign (GAAC) alongside Abdulrahman Al Naimi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.alkarama.org/our-people |title=Alkarama's Board and Staff members - Alkarama Foundation |access-date=2016-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410034243/http://en.alkarama.org/our-people |archivedate=2016-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Master"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ar.qawim.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=201&amp;Itemid=35|title=Qawim Arabic Website - مجلس أمناء الحملة|last=Master|first=Hamla Web|website=ar.qawim.net|access-date=2016-11-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331135321/http://ar.qawim.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=201&amp;Itemid=35|archive-date=2016-03-31|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An online portal for articles on human-rights matters in the Arab World, the GAAC’s founding statement, written by Alkarama founding member Abdulrahman Al Naimi, claims that Islam is under siege and that the organisation seeks to confront the Western “aggressor.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ar.qawim.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=180&amp;Itemid=34|title=Qawim Arabic Website - البيان التأسيسي|last=Master|first=Hamla Web|website=ar.qawim.net|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; GAAC has also hosted Hamas leaders.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7895485.stm|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} Middle East {{!}} Clerics urge new jihad over Gaza|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://arabi21.com/story/887784/%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B1-%D9%86%D8%B5%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%82%D8%B5%D9%89-%D9%8A%D8%AE%D8%AA%D8%AA%D9%85-%D9%81%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%87-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%B7%D9%86%D8%A8%D9%88%D9%84|title=مؤتمر "نصرة الأقصى" يختتم فعالياته باسطنبول|newspaper=عربي21|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alkarama unambiguously and irrevocably denies all these accusations, but the Foundation can only work in a spirit of full transparency. You can find details of its cases below.

=== 2012: Arrest and detention of [[Mourad Dhina]] in Paris ===
In 2012, Alkarama's Executive Director, Dr [[Mourad Dhina]], who had openly called for democratic change in [[Algeria]] for years was detained in [[France]] for six months on a request from the Algerian authorities to have him [[extradited]] to the country. The French court released him when they received documents from the Algerian authorities, which were so incoherent and lacking any evidence that the French prosecutor qualified them as "grotesque". Dr. Dhina returned to Alkarama after having spent almost 6 months at the [[Prison de la Santé]] in [[Paris]].

=== 2013: Listing of one of Alkarama's three founding members, Pr. Al Naimi, by the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] ===
On 18 December 2013, the [[United States Department of the Treasury|United States Department of Treasury]] listed one of Alkarama’s three founding members, Pr. Abdulrahman Al Naimi as a “Specially Designated Global Terrorist” for having supposedly ''“provided money and material support and conveyed communications to [[Al-Qaeda|Al Qaeda]] and its affiliates in [[Syria]], [[Iraq]], [[Somalia]] and [[Yemen]] for more than a decade.”''[[# ftn1|[1]]]  In addition, the U.S. Treasury claimed that Naimi had “reportedly oversaw the transfer of over $2 million per month to al-Qa’ida in Iraq for a period of time” and “served as an interlocutor between al-Qaida in Iraq leaders and Qatar-based donors.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl2249.aspx|title=Treasury Designates Al-Qa’ida Supporters in Qatar and Yemen|website=www.treasury.gov|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking to the [[Financial Times]] from [[Istanbul]], Al Naimi denied the charges leveled against him.[[# ftn2|[2]]]  Al Naimi is also a secretary general of the Global Anti-Aggression Campaign, an online NGO that has hosted [[Hamas]] leaders and released anti-Semitic and anti-Western writings.&lt;ref name="Master"/&gt;&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ar.qawim.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=8578&amp;Itemid=1|title=Qawim Arabic Website - الجذور العقدية لقرارات الغرب ومن يواليهم بحق قضايا الأمة الإسلامية|last=Master|first=Hamla Web|website=ar.qawim.net|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ar.qawim.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=180&amp;Itemid=36|title=Qawim Arabic Website - البيان التأسيسي|last=Master|first=Hamla Web|website=ar.qawim.net|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the listing, Pr. Al Naimi resigned from the Foundation to avoid any misinterpretation. However, the Alkarama Council decided to reject the resignation of Mr. Al Naimi after initially accepting it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.alkarama.org/press-releases-k2/1187-press-release-by-the-council-of-the-alkarama-foundation|title=Press release by the Council of the Alkarama Foundation - Alkarama Foundation|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2014, Naimi stepped down as President and Member of the Board of Alkarama.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.shab.ch/shabforms/servlet/Search?EID=7&amp;DOCID=1641359&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note, however, that the charges brought by the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury]] against him were made against his own person, and not the Foundation. Besides, the U.S. Treasury has not submitted any evidence or proof of its allegations against Pr Al Naimi, who denies all charges as a whole, and is willing, as he officially notified the American authorities, to appear in person before a court to establish the falsity of the charges pressed against him. Al Naimi has, however, received widespread media coverage for his support to terrorist groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/qatar/11110928/Former-head-of-human-rights-charity-accused-of-leading-double-life-as-terrorist-fundraiser.html|title=Former head of human rights charity accused of leading double life as terrorist fundraiser|last=Spencer|first=By David Blair and Richard|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/11156327/Al-Qaeda-terror-financier-worked-for-Qatari-government.html|title=Al-Qaeda terror financier worked for Qatari government|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/10/rich-little-qatar-big-ugly-ties-to-terror.html|title=U.S. Ally Qatar Shelters Jihadi Moneymen|last=Dettmer|first=Jamie|date=2014-12-10|website=The Daily Beast|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/12/20/terrorists-for-human-rights.html|title=Terrorists for Human Rights|last=Lake|first=Eli|date=2013-12-20|website=The Daily Beast|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2014: Listing of Alkarama as a terrorist organisation by the [[United Arab Emirates]] ===
On 15 November 2014, the [[Emirates News Agency]] released a list of 85 organisations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.wam.ae/en/news/emirates-international/1395272478814.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-02-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130052552/http://www.wam.ae/en/news/emirates-international/1395272478814.html |archive-date=2016-01-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''“designated as terrorist organisations and groups in implementation of Federal Law No. 7 for 2014 on combating terrorist crimes”'' issued by Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nayhan with the aim to ''“raise awareness in society about these organisations.”''

The list, which includes internationally recognised terrorist organisations, such as [[Al-Qaeda]] or Dae’sh (the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] - ISIL), also includes several Muslim associations in Europe and international NGOs, such as the [[Council on American–Islamic Relations|Council on American-Islamic Relations]] (CAIR) and [[Islamic Relief]]. “Alkarama organisation” also appears in that list, but despite numerous attempts to contact Emirati officials on this matter, the Alkarama Foundation never received an official confirmation and therefore considers itself not concerned by that listing.

=== 2015: Arrest of [[Rachid Mesli]] in Italy ===
Me Rachid Mesli, Legal Director at Alkarama, was arrested at the Swiss-Italian border on 19 August 2015 on the basis of an [[Interpol notice|international arrest warrant]] issued by the Algerian authorities in April 2002, which claims that he had ''"provided telephone information to terrorist groups movements,"'' and ''"attempted to supply terrorist groups with cameras and phones,"''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.alkarama.org/1834-alkarama-s-legal-director-detained-in-italy-on-the-basis-of-algerian-arrest-warrant|title=Alkarama's Legal Director Detained in Italy on the Basis of Algerian Arrest Warrant - Alkarama Foundation|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; twisting his work as a human rights lawyer, in constant contact with victims of human rights abuses and their families.

On 22 August, the Italian justice decided to put him under house arrest instead of keeping him in Aosta prison, following several calls from various [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]], institutions and personalities, as well as an important media coverage of his case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.alkarama.org/component/k2/1865-court-lifts-restrictive-measure-of-house-arrest-against-rachid-mesli?Itemid=|title=Court Lifts Restrictive Measure of House Arrest against Rachid Mesli - Alkarama Foundation|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 September 2015, recognizing Me Mesli's important work in the promotion and protection of human rights in the Arab World, as well as the strong risks of [[torture]] that he would incur if he was extradited to [[Algeria]], the [[Turin]] Court decided to release him without waiting for the end of the 40-day period by which the Algerian authorities can submit their formal request for [[extradition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.alkarama.org/component/k2/1866-turin-court-of-appeal-authorises-rachid-mesli-to-leave-italy?Itemid=|title=Turin Court of Appeal Authorises Rachid Mesli to Leave Italy - Alkarama Foundation|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, on 16 December 2015, the Italian court rejected the extradition request after noting all the inconsistencies in the [[Interpol notice|international arrest warrant]]. The court considered the charges against Me Mesli were the result of ''"political persecution"'' and asserted that ''"his human rights activities have nothing to do with terrorism."''&lt;ref name="en.alkarama.org"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.alkarama.org/component/k2/2130-interpol-withdraws-the-international-arrest-warrant-by-algeria-against-the-lawyer-rachid-mesli?Itemid=|title=Interpol Withdraws International Arrest Warrant by Algeria Against Lawyer Rachid Mesli - Alkarama Foundation|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And on 13 May 2016, the [[Interpol notice#Commission for the Control of Interpol.27s Files .28.22CCF.22.29|Commission for the Control of Interpol's Files]] decided, after a long legal battle, to drop the [[Interpol notice|international arrest warrant]] issued in 2003 by the Algerian authorities against Me Mesli, for their lack of cooperation as well as their failure to provide any form of clarification on his case.&lt;ref name="en.alkarama.org"/&gt;

== Advocacy on behalf of terrorism supporters ==
In April 2004, Alkarama issued a report condemning the arrest by Qatari authorities of a number of individuals with ties to terrorism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anhri.net/mena/achr/pr040426.shtml|title=حول الاعتقال التعسفي في قطر|website=www.anhri.net|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Alkarama Foundation report did not mention their activities in support of terrorism but called on Qatar to release the arbitrarily detained individuals. The report listed [[Ibrahim Issa al-Bakr]], [[Salim al-Kuwari|Salim Hasan al-Kuwari]], [[Abd al-Latif Bin Abdullah Salih Muhammad al-Kawari]], [[Khalid Saeed al-Bounein]] and others as the detainees which Alkarama demanded be released.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The U.S. Treasury claimed that in the early 2000s, when Alkarama released its advocacy report, Ibrahim Issa al-Bakr was “working to raise money to support terrorism” and was involved in a jihadist network.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl2651.aspx|title=Treasury Designates Twelve Foreign Terrorist Fighter Facilitators|website=www.treasury.gov|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the U.S. government designated Ibrahim Issa al-Bakr as an al-Qaeda supporter and Specially Designated Global Terrorist who worked with a Lebanon-based network to procure and transport weapons to Syria with the help of an al-Qaeda associate in Syria.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In January 2015, al-Bakr was added by the United Nations to the al-Qaeda Sanctions List of individuals subject to an assets freeze and travel ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2015/sc11750.doc.htm|title=Security Council Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee Adds Four Names to Its Sanctions List {{!}} Meetings Coverage and Press Releases|website=www.un.org|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salim Hasan al-Kuwari is a Qatari national and US-designated financier and facilitator of al-Qaeda.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/tg1261.aspx|title=Treasury Targets Key Al-Qa’ida Funding and Support Network Using Iran as a Critical Transit Point|website=www.treasury.gov|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Treasury claimed that Kuwari supports al-Qaeda through Iran-based al-Qaeda associates and has provided “hundreds of thousands of dollars in financial support to al-Qaeda.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2009, Alkarama submitted Kuwari’s case to the [[Working Group on Arbitrary Detention|UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD).]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.alkarama.org/qatar/387-qatar-abdullah-khowar-and-salem-al-kuwari-arbitrarily-detained-since-six-months|title=Qatar: Abdullah Khowar and Salem Al-Kuwari arbitrarily detained since six months - Alkarama Foundation|access-date=2016-11-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117070733/http://en.alkarama.org/qatar/387-qatar-abdullah-khowar-and-salem-al-kuwari-arbitrarily-detained-since-six-months|archive-date=2016-11-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Armenian eternity sign''' ({{lang-hy|հավերժության նշան}}, ''haverzhut’yan nshan'') or '''Arevakhach''' ({{lang|hy|Արևախաչ}}, "Sun Cross") is an ancient [[Armenia]]n [[national symbol]]  and a symbol of the [[:en:national identity|national identity]] of the [[:en:Armenians|Armenian people]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sarm.am/js/editor_innova/assets/Armenian_Eternity_Sign1.pdf Armenian Eternity Sign] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203005550/http://www.sarm.am/js/editor_innova/assets/Armenian_Eternity_Sign1.pdf |date=December 3, 2013 }},  [http://www.ada.am/arm/secretariats/itdsc/ IT Development Support Council of the Government Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203030655/http://www.ada.am/arm/secretariats/itdsc/ |date=December 3, 2013 }}, [http://www.ada.am/eng/secretariats/itdsc/workgroups/ Workgroup of Language &amp; Culture, 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203025738/http://www.ada.am/eng/secretariats/itdsc/workgroups/ |date=December 3, 2013 }}.&lt;br&gt;

==Evolution and use==
In medieval Armenian culture, the eternity sign symbolized the concept of everlasting, celestial life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bauer-Manndorff|first=Elisabeth|title=Armenia: Past and Present|year=1981|publisher=Reich Verlag|page=89|quote=The circle, as a line returning upon itself, represented perfection. Having neither beginning, nor end, it was the symbol of eternity. The architects expressed the concept of everlasting, celestial life in the knowledge of the presence and effect of the divine power by sphere.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 5th century, it appeared on Armenian [[stele]]s, later it becomes part of ''[[khachkar]]'' symbolism.&lt;ref name = "nelli"&gt;N. Sahakyan/ Armenian Highland: / RAU Press. 2006, page 150(349)&lt;/ref&gt; Around the 8th century the use of the Armenian symbol of eternity had become a long established national iconographical practice,&lt;ref&gt;Jacob G.

In the theory of [[Autowave|autowave phenomena]] an '''autowave reverberator''' is an autowave [[vortex]] in a two-dimensional [[Excitable medium|active medium]].&lt;ref group="note" name="P001"/&gt;

A reverberator appears a result of a rupture in the front of a plane autowave. Such a rupture may occur, for example, via collision of the front with a nonexcitable obstacle. In this case, depending on the conditions, either of two phenomena may arise: a ''[[spiral wave]]'', which rotates around the obstacle, or an ''autowave reverberator'' which rotates with its tip free.

== Introduction ==
{{confusing|section|date=March 2014}}
The ''reverberator'' was one of the first autowave solutions, researchers found, and, because of this historical context, it remains by nowadays the most studied autowave object.

Up until the late 20th century, the term "''auto-wave reverberator''" was used very active and widely in the scientific literature, written by soviet authors, because of active developing these investigations in [[USSR]] (for more details, see "A brief history of autowave researches" in [[Autowave]]). And, inasmuch as the soviet scientific literature was very often republished in English translation (see e.g.&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Yakhno-1979en"/&gt;&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Yakhno-1987en"/&gt;&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Biktashev-1989en"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Volobuev-1997en"/&gt;), the term "''autowave reverberator''" became known also in English-speaking countries.

The ''reverberator'' is often confused with another state of the active medium, which is similar to it, - with the ''spiral wave''. Indeed, at a superficial glance, these two autowave solutions look almost identical. Moreover, the situation is further complicated by the fact that the spiral wave may under certain circumstances become the reverberator, and the reverberator may, on the contrary, become the spiral wave!

However, it must be remembered that many features of ''rotating autowaves'' were quite thoroughly studied as long ago as the 1970s,  and already at that time some significant differences in properties of a spiral wave and a reverberator were revealed. Unfortunately, all the detailed  knowledge from those years remains now scattered in different publications of the 1970-1990s, which became little-known now even for the new generations of researchers, not to mention the people that are far from this research topic.  Perhaps, the only book in that it were more or less completely brought together in the form of abstracts basic information about autowaves, known at the time of its publication, remains still the Proceedings „Autowave processes in systems with diffusion“,&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Gorky-1981"/&gt; which was published in 1981 and became already a rare bibliographic edition in nowadays; its content was partially reiterated in another book&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Ardashev-2009p06"/&gt; in 2009.

The differences between a reverberator and a spiral wave are considered below in detail. But for the beginning it is useful to demonstrate these differences with a simple analogy. Everyone knows well the seasons of a year... Under some conditions, winter can turn into summer, and summer, on the contrary, into winter; and, moreover, these miraculous transformations occur quite regularly! However, though a winter and a summer are similar, for example, in regular alternation of day and night, you cannot think of saying that winter and summer are the same thing, can you? Nearly the same things are with reverberator and spiral waves; and therefore they should not be confused.

It is useful also to keep in mind that it is known now, in addition to the rotating-wave, quite a number of other autowave solutions, and every year the number grows continuously with increasing speed. Because of these causes (or as a result of these events), it was found during the 21st century that many of the conclusions about the properties of autowaves, - which were widely known among readers of the early papers on the subject as well as widely discussed in the press of that time, - unfortunately, proved to be a sort of erroneous hasty generalizations.

=== "Historical" definition ===

{{centered pull quote|An important difference between a reverberator and a spiral wave rotating around the hole, which is similar to reverberator in the form, is that the reverberator is not tied to any structure in the medium. Due to this property, reverberators can appear and disappear at different locations of the medium.

=== On the question of terminology  ===

{{centered pull quote|We note here some of the subtleties the established terminology. A ''rotating autowave'' in two-dimensional medium is called by various authors as ''spiral wave'', ''reverberator'', ''rotor'', ''vortex'' or even ''scroll wave''. However, one should take into account that these terms are not functionally interchangeable nevertheless (they are not entire synonyms). Briefly the differences between them are as follows.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Ordinarily, the term "spiral wave" refers only to the autowaves rotating around a nonexcitable obstacle in the medium that is of sufficiently large size (that is, in this case, such extent, in which the obstacle is small compared with the size of the medium, and is, however, large enough to provide the autowave break). The tip of the spiral wave moves always along the border of the nonexcitable obstacles.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The most important difference between an autowave reverberator and a close to it in the form spiral wave, which rotates around the obstacle, is that the reverberator is not tied to any structure in the medium. Due to this property reverberators can occur in different places of medium, not only in the absence of nonexcitable obstacles, but generally in a completely homogeneous medium (under appropriate initial conditions). In English scientific literature the most similar in meaning is the term "rotor".&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Winfree-1991"/&gt; However,  we give preference to the term reverberator, although it is now less used (in English literature) than the term "rotor", because it has two advantages being: 1) short enough and 2) not busy with other meaning (while the rotor is  taken already to call [[Rotor (electric)|the moving part of an electric motor]], and, in addition, the term is used in the [[Curl (mathematics)|mathematical theory of the field]]). (...) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As for the term "autowave vortex", it can be asserted (at a some stretch, which is especially easy for mathematicians) that reverberator is a two-dimensional vortex (and this is plain truth from the point of view of mathematics). For the natural sciences, which are also biophysics as well as modern medicine, two-dimensional objects do not exist in the real world, and therefore one can say only very conditionally about such two-dimensional objects in these sciences, implying that, in the context of the issues discussed, the thickness of the medium does not affect the behaviour of the phenomenon under consideration. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Looking ahead, we say that a ''simple scroll'' is called a three-dimensional vortex that presents identical reverberators at any given time in each section perpendicular to its axis of rotation, and so its behaviour in each of the section is almost identical with behaviour of the reverberator. But this happens only in very limited circumstances, and, in common way, a simple scroll can easily be transformed into more complex objects. Therefore, the substitution of the terms "scroll" and "reverberator" in this case is completely irrelevant, and the term "scroll", in opinion of the authors, is appropriate to use only for description of rotating autowaves in three-dimensional media — i.e., in the cases where you can not neglect the effects caused by the thickness of the medium.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In light of these terminological remarks, we will write "'''2D-autovortex'''" ("'''two-dimensional autowave vortex'''") in the subsequent text, speaking generally about the autowaves rotating in two-dimensional medium ;  and particularly, describing behaviour of 2D-autovortex, we will use the appropriate clarifying term - for example, "spiral wave" or "reverberator".

Отметим здесь же некоторые тонкости установившейся терминологии. Разные авторы называют вращающиеся в двумерной среде автоволны ''спиральными волнами'' (''spiral wave''), ''ревербераторами'', ''роторами'' (''rotor''), ''автоволновыми вихрями'' (''vortex'') или даже ''свитками'' (''scroll wave''). Однако следует учитывать, что всё же эти термины не являются полными синонимами. Вкратце различия между ними следующие. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Термином «спиральная волна» обозначают обычно лишь  автоволны, вращающиеся вокруг невозбудимого препятствия в среде достаточно большой протяженности, то есть в данном случае такой протяженности, в которой препятствие является малым по сравнению с размером среды, однако достаточно большим, чтобы обеспечивать разрыв автоволны. В спиральной волне ее кончик движется по границе невозбудимого препятствия. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Важнейшим отличием ревербератора от близкой к нему по форме спиральной волны, вращающейся вокруг отверстия, является то, что ревербератор не привязан к какой-либо структуре в среде. Благодаря этому свойству ревербераторы могут возникать в разных местах среды, причем не только при отсутствии невозбудимых препятствия, но и вообще в полностью однородной среде (при подходящих начальных условиях). В англоязычной литературе наиболее близким по смыслу является термин «ротор». Однако в  своем изложении мы будем предпочтение отдавать термину ревербератор: хотя оно в настоящее время менее используется, чем термин «ротор», однако имеет два преимущества, одновременно являясь и достаточно коротким, и не занятым другими значениями (в то время как ротором, например, принято уже называть движущуюся часть электромотора, и, кроме того, этот термин широко используется в математической теории поля). (...) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Что же до терминов «автоволновой вихрь», то с некоторыми натяжками (особенно легкими для математиков) можно утверждать, что ревербератор — это двумерный вихрь (и это с точки зрения математики абсолютно верно). Для естественных наук, каковыми являются и биофизика, и современная медицина, двумерных объектов не существует в реальном мире, и поэтому о двумерных объектах в этих науках говорят лишь очень условно, подразумевая при этом лишь то, что в контексте обсуждаемых вопросов толщина среды не сказывается на поведении рассматриваемого или изучаемого явления. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Забегая вперед, скажем, что свитком ('''''простым свитком''''') называют такой трехмерный вихрь,  который в каждый момент времени в сечении, перпендикулярном своей оси вращения, являет собой идентичные ревербераторы, и поэтому его поведение в каждом из сечений практически тождественно поведению ревербератора. Но это происходит лишь в очень ограниченных условиях, а в остальных случаях простой свиток трансформируется в более сложные объекты. Поэтому в данном случае подмена терминов «свиток» и «ревербератор» является совершенно неуместной, и термин «свиток», по мнению авторов, уместно использовать лишь при описании автоволн, вращающихся в трехмерных средах, — то есть в тех случаях, когда нельзя пренебречь эффектами, обусловленными толщиной рассматриваемой среды. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
В свете этих терминологических замечаний мы в дальнейшем изложении, говоря вообще о вращающихся в двумерной среде  автоволнах, будем использовать сокращение '''''2D-автовихрь''''' ('''''двумерный автоволновой вихрь'''''), а в частных случаях описания поведения 2D-автовихря мы будем использовать соответствующий уточняющий термин: например, «спиральная волна» или «ревербератор».

{{confusing|section|date=March 2014}}

=== The "classical" regimes ===

[[File:Diagram of reverberator evolution in FitzHugh-Nagumo model.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Diagram of the evolution of reverberator for FitzHugh-Nagumo model (in accordance with the results of A.&amp;nbsp;Winfrey&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Winfree-1991"/&gt;): ''β'' — parameter of the model that corresponds to the excitation threshold, ''ε'' — parameter of the model that corresponds to  relaxation ability of the active medium, ''∂P'' — "the propagation boundary", out which any autowave propagation is impossible, ''∂R'' — the boundary of existence of the reverberators (the "rotor boundary"), ''∂M'' —  the meander boundary, ''∂C'' — the boundary of hyper-meander.]]

Various autowave regimes, such as ''plane waves''  or ''spiral waves'' can exist in an active media, but only under certain conditions on the medium properties. Using the [[FitzHugh–Nagumo model|FitzhHugh-Nagumo model]] for a generic active medium, [[Arthur Winfree|Winfree]]&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Winfree-1991"/&gt; constructed a diagram  depicting the regions of parameter space in which the principle phenomena may be observed. Such diagrams are a common way of presenting the different dynamical regimes observed in both experimental and theoretical settings. They are sometimes called ''flower gardens'' since the paths traced by autowave tips may often resemble the petals of a flower. A flower garden for the FitzHugh-Nagumo model is shown to the right. It contains: the line ''∂P'', which confines the range of the model parameters under which impulses can propagate through one-dimensional medium, and ''plane autowaves'' can spread in the two-dimensional medium; the "rotor boundary" ''∂R'', which confines the range of the parameters under which there can be the reverberators rotating around fixed cores (i.e. performing uniform circular rotation); the ''meander'' boundary ''∂M'' and the ''hyper-meander'' boundary ''∂C'', which confine the areas where two-period and more complex (possibly chaotic) regimes can exist. Rotating autowaves with large cores exist only in the areas with parameters close to the boundary ''∂R''.

Similar autowave regimes were also obtained for the other models — Beeler-Reuter model,&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Efimov-1995"/&gt; Barkley model,&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Belinec-1977"/&gt; Aliev-Panfilov model,&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Aliev-1996"/&gt; Fenton-Karma model etc.

It was also shown&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Kokoz-1973"/&gt; that these simple autowave regimes should be common to all active media because a system of [[differential equation]]s of any complexity, which describes this or that active medium, can be always simplified to two equations.

In the simplest case without drift (i.e., the regime of ''uniform circular rotation''), the tip of a reverberator rotates around a fixed point along the circumference of a certain radius (the circular motion of the ''tip of the reverberator''). The autowave  cannot penetrate into the circle bounded by this circumference. As far as it approaches the centre of the reverberator rotation, the amplitude of the excitation pulse is reduced, and, at a relatively low excitability of the medium there is a region of finite size in the centre of  reverberator, where the amplitude of the excitation pulse is zero (recall that we speak now about a homogeneous medium, for each point of which its properties are the same). This area of low amplitude in the centre of the reverberator is usually called ''the core of the reverberator''. The existence of such a region in the center of reverberator seems, at first glance, quite incomprehensible, as it borders all the time with the excited sites. A detailed investigation of this phenomenon showed&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Gorky-1981"/&gt; that resting area in the centre of reverberator remains of its normal excitability, and the existence of a quiescent region in the centre of the reverberator is related to the phenomenon of the critical curvature. In the case of "infinite" homogeneous medium, the core radius and the speed of the rotor rotation are determined only by the properties of the medium itself, rather than the initial conditions. The shape of the front of the rotating spiral wave in the distance from the centre of rotation is close to the evolvent of the circumference - the boundaries of its core.&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Wiener-1946"/&gt;  The certain  size of the core of the reverberator is conditioned by that the excitation wave, which circulates in a closed path, should completely fit in this path without bumping into its own [[Refractory period (physiology)|refractory tail]].

As the ''critical size'' of the reverberator, it is understood as the minimum size of the homogeneous medium in which the reverberator can exist indefinitely. For assessing the critical size of the reverberator one uses sometimes the size of its core, assuming that adjacent to the core region of the medium should be sufficient for the existence of sustainable re-entry. However, the quantitative study of the dependence of the reverberator  behaviour on conductivity  of rapid transmembrane current (that characterize the excitability of the medium), it was found&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Gorky-1981"/&gt; that the critical size of the reverberator  and the size its core are its different characteristics, and the critical size of the reverberator is much greater, in many cases, than the size of its core (i.e. reverberator dies, even the case, if its core fits easily in the boundaries of the medium and its drift is absent)

=== Regimes of induced drift  ===

At meander and hyper-meander, the displacement of the center of autowave rotation (i.e. its drift) is influenced by the forces generated by the very same rotating autowave.

However, in result of  the scientific study of rotating autowaves was also identified a number of external conditions that force reverberator drift. It can be, for example, the heterogeneity of the active medium by any parameter. Perhaps, it is  the works Biktasheva,&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Biktashev-1989en"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Biktashev-1995"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Biktashev-2007"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Biktashev-2010"/&gt; where different types of the reverberator drift are currently represented the most completely (although there are other authors&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Davydov-1988"/&gt; who are also involved in the study of drift of the autowave reverberator).

In particular, Biktashev offers&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Biktashev-2007"/&gt; to distinguish the following types of reverberator drift in the active medium:
# Resonant drift.
# Inhomogeneity induced drift.
# Anisotropy induced drift.
# Boundary induced drift  (see also&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Biktashev-1989en"/&gt;).
# Interaction of spirals.
# High frequency induced drift.

Note that even for such a simple question, what should be called a drift of autowaves, and what should  not be called, there is still no agreement among researchers. Some researchers (mostly mathematicians) tends to consider as reverberator drift only those of its displacement, which occur under the influence of external events (and this view is determined exactly by the peculiarity of the mathematical approach to the study of autowaves). The other part of the researchers did not find significant differences between the spontaneous displacement of reverberator in result of  the events generated by it itself, and its displacement as a result of external influences; and therefore these researchers tend to believe that meander and hyper-meander are also variants of drift, namely ''the spontaneous drift of the reverberator''. There was not debate on this question of terminology in the scientific literature, but it can be found easily these features of describing the same phenomena by the different authors.

=== Autowave lacet  ===

In the numerical study of reverberator using the Aliev-Panfilov model,&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Aliev-1996"/&gt; the phenomenon of [[bifurcation memory]] was revealed, when the reverberator changes spontaneously its behaviour from ''meander'' to ''uniform circular rotation''; this new regime was named ''autowave lacet''.&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Elkin-2007"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Moskalenko-2009"/&gt;&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Ardashev-2009p06"/&gt;

Briefly, spontaneous deceleration of the reverberator drift by the forces generated by the reverberator itself occurs during the autowave lacet, with the velocity of its drift decreasing gradually down to zero in the result. The regime meander thus degenerates into a simple uniform circular rotation. As already mentioned, this unusual process is related to phenomenon of bifurcation memory.

When autowave lacet was discovered, the first question arose: Does the ''meander'' exist ever or the halt of the reverberator  drift can be observed every time in all the cases, which are called meander, if the observation will be sufficiently long? The comparative quantitative analysis of the drift velocity of reverberator in the regimes of ''meander'' and ''lacet'' revealed a clear difference between these two types of evolution of the reverberator: while the drift velocity quickly goes to a stationary value during meander,  a steady decrease in the drift velocity of the vortex can be observed during the lacet, in which can be clearly identified the phase of slow deceleration and phase of rapid deceleration of the drift velocity.

The revealing of autowave lacet may be important for [[cardiology]]. It is known that reverberators show remarkable stability of their properties, they behave "at their discretion", and their behaviour can significantly affect only the events that occur near the tip of reverberator. The fact that the behaviour of the reverberator can significantly affected only by the events that occur near its core, results, for example, in the fact that, at a meeting with reverberator nonexcitability heterogeneity (e.g. small myocardial scar), the tip of the rotating wave "sticks" to this heterogeneity, and reverberator begins to rotate around the stationary nonexcitability obstacles. The transition  from  polymorphic to monomorphic [[tachycardia]]  is observed on the [[ECG]] in such cases. This phenomenon is called the "''anchoring''" of spiral wave.&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Kukushkin-2004"/&gt;
However, it was found in the simulations that spontaneous transition of polymorphic tachycardia in monomorphic one can be observed also on the ECG during the autowave lacet&lt;!-- (see. Fig.) --&gt;; in other words, the ''lacet'' may be another mechanism of transformation of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in a monomorphic.&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Moskalenko-2007b"/&gt; Thus, the autowave theory predicts the existence of special type of ventricular arrhythmias, conditionally called "lacetic",&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Moskalenko-2012"/&gt; which cardiologists do not still distinguish in diagnostics.

== The reasons for distinguishing between variants of rotating autowaves  ==
{{confusing|section|date=March 2014}}
Recall that from 1970th&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Gorky-1981"/&gt; to the present time it is customary to distinguish three variants rotating autowaves: 
# wave in the ring, 
# spiral wave,
# autowave reverberator.

[[File:Сritical size of reverberator.png|thumb|300px|left|Critical size of reverberator (reconstructed on the base of data of {{nobr|A.M. Percov}} and {{nobr|A.V. Panfilov}},&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Gorky-1981"/&gt; obtained for the FitzHugh-Nagumo model). '''A'''.&amp;nbsp;The relation between the critical size and the size of the core. '''Б'''.&amp;nbsp;The dependence of the critical sizes of the reverberator and the autowave running around the ring on the conduction of rapid current ''g''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; . '''В'''.&amp;nbsp;Dependence of the period of the reverberator and the running around the ring on ''g''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;. '''Г'''.&amp;nbsp;Dependence of the refractoriness of the medium(''R'') on ''g''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; for the plane wave (curvature ''k''=0.83) and the plane wave.]]
Dimensions of the core of reverberator is usually less than the minimal critical size of the circular path of circulation, which is associated with the phenomenon of ''critical curvature''. In addition, the refractory period appears to be longer for the waves with non-zero curvature (reverberator and spiral wave) and begins to increase with decreasing the excitability of the medium  before the refractory period for the plane waves (in the case of circular rotation). These and other significant differences between the reverberator and the circular rotation of excitation wave make us distinguish these two regimes of re-entry.

The figure shows the differences found in the behavior of the plane autowave circulating in the ring and reverberator. You can see that, in the same local characteristics of the excitable medium (excitability, refractoriness, etc., given by the nonlinear member), there are significant quantitative differences between dependencies of the reverberator characteristics and characteristics  of the regime of one-dimensional rotation of impulse, although respective dependencies match qualitatively.
&lt;!-- 
More details about the causes of distinguishing between these three variants will be described in section "[[Автоволны/Вращающаяся автоволна|Вращающаяся автоволна]]"

&lt;ref name="P001"&gt;Negligent use of special terms even in scientific literature during the forty years of research of the autowave processes (approximately 1970 to 2010) resulted in rather a lot of confusion in the usage of the names of the rotating autowave. Researchers themselves are often able to guess from the context of what is described in a publication; however, even for researchers from other, albeit related, fields of knowledge is almost impossible to understand the intricacies of autowave processes because of such terms confusion.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CRUMB – Curatorial Resource for Upstart Media Bliss''' is a research resource for all things related to the practice of curating new media art (digital technology and contemporary art). Via an online discussion list and regular conferences as well as publications, CRUMB collects and disseminates information about curating in the field of [[New Media art]].

==History==
CRUMB was founded in 2000 by [[Beryl Graham]] and [[Sarah Cook (curator)|Sarah Cook]], as a research institute at the [[University of Sunderland]].&lt;ref name="founding"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.eai.org/resourceguide/exhibition/computer/interview_crumb.html |title=Conversation with CRUMB's Sarah Cook &amp; Beryl Graham |deadurl=no |accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; CRUMB has been awarded a series of major Research Grants by the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]], and research partners have included [[Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art]] (2000–2006) and from 2007, [[Eyebeam Atelier]] (New York) and [[Lancaster University]], UK.
Over the past ten years, CRUMB has organised many conferences and workshops around the themes of curating, such as the documentation and preservation of [[New Media art]], most recently at the AND Festival in Liverpool in October 2009.&lt;ref name="AND"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.rhizome.org/editorial/2976 |title=Abandon Normal Devices (AND) Festival Report |deadurl=no |accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; CRUMB has published numerous interviews with leading curators including [[Christiane Paul (curator)|Christiane Paul]] of the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], [[Barbara London (curator)|Barbara London]] of the [[Museum of Modern Art]], and [[Benjamin Weil]] formerly of the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref name="Weil"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.crumbweb.org/getInterviewDetail.php?id=9&amp;showList=1&amp;op=3&amp;ts=1256282471 |title=CRUMB Interviews |deadurl=no |accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29141">'''Documentality''' is the theory of documents that underlies the [[ontology]] of [[social reality]] put forward by the Italian [[philosopher]] [[Maurizio Ferraris]] (see Ferraris 2007, 2008, 2009a and 2009b).&lt;ref&gt;For an extended debate on the theory, see [http://www.rescogitans.it/main.php?issueid=7&amp;sectionid=5&amp;chapterid=21 Rescogitans] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321204218/http://www.rescogitans.it/main.php?issueid=7&amp;sectionid=5&amp;chapterid=21 |date=March 21, 2012 }} and the symposium devoted to the theory in [http://www2.units.it/etica/ ''Etica &amp; Politica'' 11/2 (2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; The theory gives to documents a central position within the sphere of social [[object (philosophy)|objects]], conceived as distinct from physical and ideal objects. Ferraris argues that social objects are "social acts that have been inscribed on some kind of support", be it a paper document, a magnetic support, or even memory in people's heads (e.g. in the case of the [[promise]]s we make every day). Thus the constitutive [[norm (philosophy)|rule]] of social objects is that ''Object = Inscribed Act''. Therefore, documents as inscriptions possessing social relevance and [[value (ethics)|value]] embody the essential and prototypical features of any social object, and it is on this basis that it is possible to develop an ontology capable of classifying documents and their selective storage, beginning with the grand divide between strong documents (inscriptions of acts), which make up social objects in the full sense, and weak documents (recordings of facts), which are secondary derivatives and of lesser importance. This theory is inspired, on the one hand, by the reflection on the centrality of writing developed by [[Jacques Derrida]] (1967, 1972) and, on the other hand, by the theory of social acts devised by [[Adolf Reinach]] (1913) and the theory of linguistic acts by [[J. L. Austin|John L. Austin]] (1962).

==Searle: X counts as Y in C==
In the contemporary debate, one of the main theories of social objects&lt;ref&gt;For the position of Documentality in the contemporary debate on social ontology, See Torrengo 2009. For a critical comparison between the social ontology put forward by Searle and Documentality, see Casetta 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; has been proposed by the American philosopher [[John Searle|John R. Searle]], in particular in his book ''The Construction of Social Reality'' (1995). [[John Searle|Searle]]'s ontology recognizes the sphere of social objects, defining them as higher order objects with respect to [[physical objects]], in accordance with the rule
&lt;blockquote&gt;''X counts as Y in C''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

meaning that the physical object X, for instance a colored piece of paper, counts as Y, a 10 [[euro]] [[banknote]], in context C, the [[Europe]] of the year 2010. According to [[John Searle|Searle]], from the iteration of this simple rule the whole complexity of social reality is derived.

Powerful it may be, the theory runs&amp;nbsp;– according to Ferraris&amp;nbsp;– into problems. Firstly, it is not at all obvious how, from the physical object, we manage to get to the social object. If any physical object really can constitute the origin of a social object, then it is not clear what would prevent ''every'' physical object to turn into a social object. But clearly it is not the case that, for instance, if you decide to draw a banknote, you thereby produce a banknote.&lt;ref&gt;M. Ferraris, ''Dove sei? Ontologia del telefonino'', Milano, Bompiani, 2005: pp. 225-228 and M. Ferraris, ''Documentalità. Perché è necessario lasciar tracce'', Roma-Bari, Laterza, 2009: pp. 170-173.&lt;/ref&gt; The standard theory relies on key notion of "collective [[intentionality]]" to explain the transfiguration of X in Y. However, such a notion&amp;nbsp;– as Ferraris argues&amp;nbsp;– is not at all as clear as it purports to be.&lt;ref&gt;M. Ferraris, ''Dove sei?'', cit.: pp. 214-225 and M. Ferraris, ''Documentalità'', cit.: pp. 163-170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, how does the reversibility from the social to the physical sphere work? It is fairly intuitive to assert that a banknote is also a piece of paper, or that a President is also a person. As much as it is true that when [[John Searle|Searle]] is alone in a hotel room there is only one physical object, but many social objects (a husband, an employee of the state of California, an American citizen, a driving license holder etc.). In this case, the passage back from Y (the social) to X (the physical) goes smoothly. However, things change in different, although not very peculiar, situations. How should we deal with [[vagueness|vague]] or vast entities, such as a State, a battle, a university? And how about negative entities, such as debts?&lt;ref&gt;M. Ferraris, ''Dove sei?'', cit.: pp. 229-233 and M. Ferraris, ''Documentalità'', cit.: pp. 173-176.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The roots of documentality==
Three philosophical theses&amp;nbsp;– inspired, respectively, by the work of the German [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologist]] [[Adolf Reinach]], the Peruvian [[economist]] [[Hernando de Soto Polar|Hernando de Soto]], and the French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]]&amp;nbsp;– shape the theory of Documentality.

===The speech acts thesis===
According to the Speech Act Thesis&amp;nbsp;– stemming more from the theory of social acts devised in 1913 by the German phenomenologist [[Adolf Reinach]] than from the writings of [[J. L. Austin|Austin]] and [[John Searle|Searle]]&lt;ref&gt;Cf. K. Mulligan (ed.), ''Speech Act and Sachverhalt: Reinach and the Foundations of Realist Phenomenology'', Dordrecht, Martinus Nijhoff, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– through the performance of speech acts (acts of promising, marrying, accusing, baptizing) we change the world by bringing into being [[claim (legal)|claims]], [[obligation]]s, [[rights]], relations of authority, debts, permissions, names, and a variety of other sorts of entities, thus making up the ontology of the social world. Given that speech acts are evanescent, the physical basis for the temporally extended existence of its products are&amp;nbsp;– in small societies and in simple social interactions&amp;nbsp;– memory traces and other psychological features of the people involved in these acts; and&amp;nbsp;– in large societies and in more complex social interactions&amp;nbsp;– documents. Documents are the physical entities, which create and sustain the sorts of enduring and re-usable [[deontological ethics|deontic]] powers that extend human memory, and thereby create and sustain the new and more complex forms of social order, which are characteristic of modern civilization.

===The "de Soto thesis"===
According to a thesis rooted in the works of [[Hernando de Soto Polar|de Soto]] (2000) (see also Smith 2003, 2008), economic development can be boosted by a documental development. Through the performance of document acts (acts of filling in, registering, conveying, validating, attaching), we ''change the world'' by bringing into being [[ownership]] relations, legal [[accountability]], business organizations, and a variety of other institutional orders of modern societies. As stock and share certificates ''create'' [[capital (economics)|capital]], so statutes of incorporation ''create'' [[company|companies]]. As identity documents ''create'' identities (the sorts of things which can be the objects of an [[identity theft]]), so diplomas ''create'' academic ranks. Where for [[Hernando de Soto Polar|de Soto]], it is commercial paper documents which create what he calls the "invisible infrastructure of asset management [...] upon which the astonishing fecundity of Western capitalism rests" Ferraris goes further and asserts that documents, both in paper and in electronic form, create the invisible infrastructure of contemporary social reality.

===The "Derrida thesis"===
[[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]] (1967) elaborated a philosophy of writing that finds its most correct application in the social sphere. Concerning speech acts, [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]] (1972) observes that they are mostly inscribed acts, since without records of some sort the [[performative utterance|performatives]] would not produce social objects such as conferences, marriages, graduation ceremonies, or constitutions. The point is simple, if we imagine a graduation or a wedding ceremony in which there are no registers and testimonies, it is difficult to maintain that a husband, a wife, or a graduate has been produced. This amounts to saying that social objects turn out to be (as much as the ideal ones) closely linked to the forms of their inscription and recording. However, [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]] was wrong&amp;nbsp;– according to Ferraris (2005; 2009)&amp;nbsp;– in claiming that "nothing exists outside the text".&lt;ref&gt;J. Derrida, ''De la grammatologie'', Paris, Ed. de Minuit, 1967: pp. 219-220.&lt;/ref&gt; Actually physical and ideal objects exist independently from every recording, as independently from there being humanity. This is not the case for social objects, which depend closely on records and the existence of humanity. It is in this sense that, by weakening [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]]'s thesis, Ferraris proposed to develop a social ontology starting from the intuition that nothing ''social'' exists outside the text.&lt;ref&gt;M. Ferraris, ''Dove sei?'', cit.: pp. 202-204, 236-242 and M. Ferraris, ''Documentalità'', cit.: pp. 176-177.&lt;/ref&gt; Keeping this in mind, Ferraris advances an innovative approach to social ontology called Documentality.

==Context and history==
The most influential ontology of social reality, formulated by the American philosopher John Searle (1995), is based on collective intentionality, which allegedly ensures that certain physical objects (e.g. a piece of paper) are transformed into social objects (e.g. a banknote). As noted by Barry Smith (2003), this perspective has difficulty in accounting for both negative entities – such as debts, which apparently do not have a physical counterpart – and the new, seemingly intangible, social objects generated by the Web. The theory of documentality proposed by Maurizio Ferraris (2005) aims to solve these problems by arguing that social objects are always recordings of social acts. This accounts for both negative entities and the virtual entities of the web, which consist precisely of recordings just like any other social object. For the theory of documentality, the constitutive rule of social reality is "Object = Inscribed Act", where "inscribed" is equal to "recorded". That is: a social object is the result of a social act (such as to involve at least two people), which is characterized by its being recorded on some support, including the minds of the people involved in the act (in the case of informal social acts such as promises) . Articulated by Ferraris (2009) in a complete ontological theory and by Smith ( 2012) in a theory of document acts, documentality has three main reasons of interest. First, it has been able to account for the substantial growth of documents and recording devices in the Web world, which is very well explained by the proposed constitutive law of social reality. Secondly, it has been able to explain why social reality, while requiring the presence of subjects for the enactment of acts, may develop independently from them and even without their knowledge (an economic recession can be taking place even if no human subject is aware of it). Third, instead of making social reality depend on the action of collective intentionality – with an increasing social constructivism (Searle 2010) – documentality is capable of substantiating a "new realism" (Ferraris, 2012) that helps continental philosophy come out of the impasses of postmodernism and reconnect with analytic philosophy.  [Source of this description of Documentality: L. Caffo, "From Documentality to New Realism", in ''The Monist'', 97:2 April 2014].

==Ferraris: object = inscribed act==
According to the [[ontologist]] [[Barry Smith (ontologist)|Barry Smith]] (forthcoming), with documentality, Ferraris advances an innovative approach to social ontology that implies three steps.

===First step: the recognition of the sphere of social objects===
The first step is the recognition&amp;nbsp;– on the ground of the theories developed by [[Barry Smith (ontologist)|Smith]] himself, (see in particular [[Barry Smith (ontologist)|Smith]] 1999)&amp;nbsp;– of the sphere of ''social objects'', meaning, entities such as money, artworks, marriages, divorces and joint custody, years in prison and mortgages, the cost of oil and the tax codes, the [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg Trial]] and the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences|Swedish Academy of Sciences]], and still, economic crises, research projects, lectures and university degrees etc. These objects fill up our world more than stones, trees and coconuts do, and they are more important for us, given that a good part of our happiness or unhappiness depends on them.&lt;ref&gt;M. Ferraris, ''Documentalità'', cit.: pp. 32-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second step: the identification of the law of constitution of social objects===
The second step is the identification of the law that brings social objects into being, namely that
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Object = Inscribed Act''&lt;ref&gt;M. Ferraris, ''Dove sei?'', cit.: p. 174 and M. Ferraris, ''Documentalità'', cit.: pp. 176-177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What this means is that a social object is the result of a social act (one that involves at least two persons or a person and a deputed machine), which is characterized by the fact of being registered on a piece of paper, a computer file or some other digital support, or even, simply, in the heads of persons.

As Smith recognizes, if taken literally, the OBJECT=Inscribed Act formulation does not make sense. For instance, if taken literally, this formulation implies that the US Constitution "is made of tiny oxidizing heaps of ink marks on parchment, and matters are helped only slightly if we add together all the printed and digital copies of the US Constitution and assert that the US Constitution is the mereological sum of all these multiple inscriptions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Barry|title=How to Do Things with Documents|journal=Rivista di Estetica|date=2012|url=http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith/articles/HowToDoThingsWithDocuments.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third step: the individuation of the sphere of documentality===
On the basis of the first two steps it is possible to develop an ontology capable of classifying documents and their selective storage, beginning with the grand divide between what Ferraris calls "strong documents" (inscriptions of acts), which make up social objects in the full sense, and "weak documents" (recordings of facts), which are secondary derivatives and of lesser importance.&lt;ref&gt;M. Ferraris, ''Documentalità'', cit.: pp. 299-300.&lt;/ref&gt; The third step thus leads to the individuation of the sphere of Documentality, understood as the search for and the definition of the [[property (philosophy)|properties]] that constitute the [[necessary and sufficient condition]]s for the being of a social object.

==Documentality in eleven theses==
The theory of Documentality has been summarized by his author (Ferraris 2009a) in eleven fundamental theses:&lt;ref&gt;M. Ferraris, ''Documentalità'', cit.: pp. 358-362.&lt;/ref&gt;

:1. ''Ontology catalogues the world of life.''
:The philosophy that guides this project is a descriptive [[metaphysics]] of a [[realism (philosophy)|realist]] type, which aims to account for the social world and everyday experience, which is to say, the world that stands outside the range of the [[natural science]]s. Its model is the catalogue. The sort of understanding proposed requires in the first instance the identification, classification and distinction of what there is in this world, how it is ordered, and how it is to be distinguished from the other things that there are.

:2. ''There are three types of objects: natural (or physical), ideal, and social.''
:Objects come in three kinds: (1) physical objects (mountains, rivers, human bodies, and animals) that exist in space and time and are independent from the subjects who know them, even if they may have been built by them, as with [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s (chairs, screwdrivers); (2) ideal objects (numbers, theorems, relations) that exist outside of space and time and are independent from the subjects who know them, but which, after having been discovered, can be socialized (for instance, a theorem can be published: still, it is the publication, not the theorem, that has a beginning in time); (3) social objects, that do not exist ''as such'' in space, since their physical presence is limited to the inscription (money is such because of what is written on the coin, on the banknote, on the memory of the credit card), but endure in time, and whose existence depends on the subjects who know, or at least can use, them and who, in certain cases, have constituted them. This latter circumstance displays how social objects, for which construction is necessary, depend on social ''acts'', whose ''inscription'' constitutes the ''object''.

:3. ''Ontology is distinct from epistemology.''
:As a point of methodology, it is necessary to outline a distinction between [[ontology]] and [[epistemology]]. The former concerns what there is independently of how we know it and of whether we know it or not. The latter is knowledge of what there is, or rather, what we are justified in believing in a given context. These two dimensions have often been confused, as we can see from the way we often make depend the being of objects on our knowledge of them.

:4. ''Social objects depend on subjects, but are not subjective.''
:The external world, understood in the first instance as the world of natural objects, is independent of conceptual schemes and perceptual apparatuses. In the same way, there is no continuous and necessary link that leads from perception to experience and from there to science, nor, on the other hand, knowledge is the main activity within our experience. In the world of social objects, by contrast, belief determines being, given that these objects depend on subjects. This does not mean that things like promises and money have a purely subjective dimension. Rather, it means that, unless there were subjects capable of recognizing social objects, such social objects would not exist.

:5. ''The constitutive rule of social objects is "Object = Inscribed Act".''
:It thus becomes possible to develop an ontology and an epistemology of social objects. The epistemology renews the tradition of the sciences of the spirit, defining itself as a "science of the letter", given the importance that inscriptions are endowed within the construction of social reality. Ontology is a theory of social objects, namely those that obey the constitutive rule "Object = Inscribed Act". That is to say, social objects are the result of social acts (and involve at least two persons) characterized by the fact of being inscribed: on paper, in a computer file or even simply in the heads of persons.

:6. ''There is nothing social outside the text.''
:The importance attributed to inscription is the characteristic feature of the theory of Documentality. The underlying idea is that the act is performed so as to produce an object; it is necessary that it be registered. A marriage or a promise that weren't inscribed, would not be an object, whereas a mountain can easily exist without being registered. In this sense, we do not hold that "there is nothing outside the text" (given that natural and ideal objects exist without inscriptions), but only that "there is nothing ''social'' outside the text".

:7. ''Society is not based on communication but on registration.''
:Because nothing social exists outside the text, papers, archives and documents constitute the fundamental elements of the social world. Society is not based on communication but on registration, which is the condition for the creation of social objects. Human beings grow as human beings and socialize through registration. Naked life is nothing but a remote starting point and culture begins very early making for a clothed life, which is manifested in registrations and imitations: languages, behaviors and rites. This explains why writing is so important and, even more, "archinscription", which is the realm of registration, that precedes and includes writing in its proper or current meaning.

:8. ''The mind is a surface that collects inscriptions.''
:As regards a theory of mind, social ontology is based on icnology, which is to say, a theory of traces (it is important to distinguish ''icnology'' as the science of traces from ''[[ichnology]]'' as a branch of geology). The representation of the mind as a ''[[tabula rasa|tabula]]'' or a writing surface is not a mere metaphor, but captures the fact that perceptions and thoughts come to us as inscriptions in our mind. But the mind is not just an inscribed surface, it is also capable of grasping inscriptions, namely the traces that there are in the world, on the surface that is before us in experience. We can make out an ascending hierarchy that takes in traces (any incision on a background), registrations (traces in the mind as a ''tabula'') and inscriptions in the technical sense (traces available to at least two persons).

:9. ''Documents in the strong sense are inscriptions of acts.''
:Considered as a theory of society, the ontology of social objects configures Documentality as a theory of documents as the highest form of social objects. The analysis of documents can be articulated into the analysis of documents in the strong sense, as inscriptions of acts, and that of documents in the weak sense, as registrations of facts. Documents can have practical purposes or they can be mainly directed to the evocation of sentiments. In the latter case, we have artworks, understood as those entities that pretend to be persons.

:10. ''The letter is the foundation of the spirit.''
:As a theory of [[culture]], the ontology of social objects becomes a [[phenomenology (archaeology)|phenomenology]] of the letter: no product of the spirit could exist without letter, registration and document; and, more radically, spirit itself finds the condition of its possibility in the letter and in the inscriptions that constitute us as social beings.

:11. ''The individuality shows itself in the signature.''
:As a theory of the subject, the ontology of social objects is divided into three parts: a theory of [[idiom]], of style, and of [[signature]]. In particular, the signature is the principle of [[individuation]] insofar as it is a way to publicly represent the presence and the identity of the subject.

==Documentality applied to other disciplines==

Documentality theory has been used in geopolitics and state theory as part of theory of understanding how nonphysical states can be established. States are precisely the kinds of entities documentality can help understand, because, it has been argued that states do not fit within the traditional Platonist duality of the concrete and the abstract, instead, belonging to a third category, the quasi-abstract. &lt;ref&gt;E.H. Robinson (2014), [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/46395762/My%20Articles/Documentary%20Theory%20of%20States.pdf "A Documentary Theory of States and Their Existence as Quasi-Abstract Entities,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303213829/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/46395762/My%20Articles/Documentary%20Theory%20of%20States.pdf |date=2016-03-03 }} Geopolitics 00, pp. 1-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Quasi-abstract objects have received attention from social ontologists of all kinds, including documentary scholars as a response to those social entities that do not fit Searle's "X counts as Y" formulation. &lt;ref&gt;B. Smith, (2008) 'Searle and De Soto: The New Ontology of the Social World". In The Mystery of Capital and the Construction of Social Reality. Open Court.&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that document acts, as understood by documentary theory can establish states and thereby bring about their existence, as well as manipulate them in various ways (such as surrendering them after a war). &lt;ref&gt;E.H. Robinson (2014), [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/46395762/My%20Articles/Documentary%20Theory%20of%20States.pdf "A Documentary Theory of States and Their Existence as Quasi-Abstract Entities,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303213829/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/46395762/My%20Articles/Documentary%20Theory%20of%20States.pdf |date=2016-03-03 }} Geopolitics 00, pp. 1-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4393">A '''dream dictionary''' is a tool made for interpreting images in a [[dream]]. Dream dictionaries tend to include specific images which are attached to specific interpretations. However, dream dictionaries are generally not considered scientifically viable by those within the psychology community.
 
==History==
Since the 19th century, the art of dream interpretation has been transferred to a scientific ground, making it a distinct part of psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund. ''Dream Psychology: Psychoanalysis for Beginners''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the dream symbols of the "unscientific" days—the outcome of hearsay interpretations that differ around the world among different cultures—continued to mark the day of an average human-being, who is most likely unfamiliar with Freudian analysis of dreams.

The dream dictionary includes interpretations of dreams, giving each symbol in a dream a specific meaning. The argument of what dreams represent has greatly changed over time. With this changing, so have the interpretation of dreams. Dream dictionaries have changed in content since they were first published. The Greeks and Romans saw dreams as having a religious meaning. This made them believe that their dreams were an insight into the future and held the key to the solutions of their problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dream in History|url=http://www.dreammoods.com/dreaminformation/history.htm|publisher=Dream Moods}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's view on dreams were that they were merely a function of our physiological make up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beare|first=J.I.|title=On Dreams by Aristotle|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/dreams.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not believe dreams have a greater meaning, solely that it is a result of how we sleep. In the Middle Ages, dreams were seen as an interpretation of good or evil.

Although the dream dictionary is not recognized in the psychology world, Freud is said to have revolutionized the interpretation and study of dreams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dream in History|url=http://www.dreammoods.com/dreaminformation/history.htm|publisher=Dream Moods}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freud came to the conclusion that dreams were a form of wish fulfillment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Kevin|title=Introduction to Sigmund Freud's Theory on Dreams|url=http://www.insomnium.co.uk/dream-theory/introduction-freud-theory-on-dreams/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dream dictionaries were first based upon Freudian thoughts and ancient interpretations of dreams.

Some examples of [[dream interpretation]] are: dreaming you are on a beach means you are facing negativity in your life, or a lion may represent a need to control others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Common Dreams|url=http://www.dreambible.com/common-dreams.html|publisher=US Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dream dictionaries typically hold interpretations ranging from A-Z. Dream dictionaries can be found in book form or on the internet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1103">'''Extrinsic finality''' is a principle of the [[philosophy]] of [[teleology]] that holds that a being has a final cause or purpose external to that being itself, in contrast to an [[intrinsic finality]], or self-contained purpose.
One example is the view that [[mineral]]s are "designed" to be used by [[plant]]s that are in turn "designed" to be used by [[animal]]s.

Over-emphasizing extrinsic finality is often criticized as leading to the anthropic attribution of every event to a divine purpose, or superstition. For instance, "If I hadn't been at the store today, I wouldn't have found that $100 on the ground. God must have intended for me to go to the store so I would find that money." or "We won the game today because of my lucky socks." Such abuses were criticized by [[Francis Bacon]],&lt;ref&gt;"De Dignitate et Augmentis Scientiarum," III, iv&lt;/ref&gt; [[Descartes]], &lt;ref&gt;"Principia Philosophiæ", I, 28; III, 2, 3; "Meditationes", III, IV&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Spinoza]].&lt;ref&gt;Ethica, I, prop. 36 app.)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Katherine "Flossie" Bailey''' (1895–February 6, 1952) was a civil rights and anti-lynching activist from Indiana. She established a local chapter of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] in [[Marion, Indiana|Marion]], Indiana, in 1918 and became especially active fighting for justice and equality following the double lynching of [[Lynching of Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith|Thomas Shipp]] and [[Lynching of Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith|Abram Smith]] in 1930. As president of the Indiana NAACP, Bailey was pivotal in lobbying for passage of a statewide [[Lynching in the United States#State laws|anti-lynching law]] in Indiana in 1931 and advocated for a similar bill at the national level. She was also a recipient of the national NAACP's [[Madam C. J. Walker]] Medal.

==Early life and education==
Katherine Harvey, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Harvey, was born in [[Kokomo, Indiana|Kokomo]], Indiana, in 1895. Known as "Flossie", she grew up in Kokomo and attended [[Kokomo High School]].&lt;ref name="Obit (1952)"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mrs. Flossie K.

==Marriage and family==
Flossie married Walter T. Bailey, a physician, in 1917. The couple resided in [[Marion, Indiana|Marion]], Indiana.&lt;ref name=IN200-10/&gt; Doctor Bailey died on February 10, 1950.&lt;ref name="W.T. obit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Colored Circles: 'Friends have received word...' |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2239881/the_kokomo_tribune_kokomo_indiana_11/|accessdate=18 April 2015|publisher=''The Kokomo Tribune''|date=11 February 1950|location=Kokomo, Indiana|page=12|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their only surviving child was a son, named Walter Charles Bailey.&lt;ref name=IN200-10/&gt;

While living in Marion, Bailey also became actively involved in the Marion community. She was a member of the city's Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church congregation.&lt;ref name="Obit (1952)"/&gt;

==Career==
Bailey spent her adult life seeking equality and justice as a civil rights activist. In 1918 Bailey established the Marion branch of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP). Initially it did not receive much support. In June 1930 it had 96 members; however, after the Marion community was the site of a [[lynching]] in August 1930, the local chapter's membership increase to 155 members by the end of 1930.&lt;ref name=Traces24/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=James H. Madison |year=2001 |title=A Lynching in the Heartland: Race and Memory in America |location=New York |publisher=Palgrave |isbn=9781403961211 |pages=58–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IN200-11&gt;Madison, "Katherine 'Flossie' Bailey" in ''Indiana's 200'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 7, 1930, a mob broke into the [[Grant County, Indiana|Grant County]], Indiana, jail in Marion, dragged two African American men, [[Lynching of Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith|Thomas Shipp]] and [[Lynching of Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith|Abram Smith]], to the Courthouse Square and lynched (hanged) them from a tree. Bailey, who was the president of the local branch of the NAACP, tried to obtain police protection for the jailed men prior to the lynching. Afterwards, she was actively involved in organizing a [[Hoosier]] delegation of NAACP members to speak to Indiana governor [[Harry Leslie]] and persuade him to intervene in the investigation of the men's murders.&lt;ref name=IN200-11/&gt;

Bailey and a number of others worked hard to obtain a fair investigation into the double lynching. Despite objections from those in the Marion community who wanted to forget about the event, Bailey and the NAACP played an important role in seeking justice for the murders of Shipp and Smith, as well as to restore calm in Marion. Two men were indicted and went on trial for the lynching, but neither one was found guilty of the crime and no one was ever punished for the deaths of Shipp and Smith.&lt;ref name=IN200-11/&gt;&lt;ref name="Madison_2000-23-25"&gt;Madison, "Flossie Bailey," ''Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History'', pp. 23–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, Bailey was elected president of the Indiana NAACP and helped plan its second annual meeting. The Bailey home in Marion became the Indiana headquarters for the NAACP.&lt;ref name=IN200-11/&gt; The national organization recognized Bailey's efforts by awarding her the [[Madam C. J. Walker]] Medal for "the person who has done the best work in the NAACP during the year."&lt;ref name="Madison_2000-25"&gt;Madison, "Flossie Bailey", ''Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bailey worked to ensure nothing like the lynching in Marion would occur again. She lobbied the [[Indiana General Assembly]] to pass stricter anti-lynching laws. When opponents to the bill rejected many of the safety measures, Bailey organized a statewide effort, calling on chapters of the NAACP, Optimist Clubs, Exchange Clubs, and Democratic organizations to lobby state legislators. Bailey's efforts were successful and the governor signed a stricter anti-lynching law in March 1931. Once the Indiana bill became law, Bailey began lobbying for a national anti-lynching law, as well as for the fair treatment of African Americans in other sectors of American life. Bailey especially focused on fighting to end the segregation of schools, hospitals, and other public spaces such as movie theaters.&lt;ref name="Madison_2000-25-26"&gt;Madison, "Flossie Bailey", ''Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History'', pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
Bailey and the NAACP struggled during the years of the [[Great Depression]]. Her husband, who suffered a stroke, closed his medical practice in Marion around 1940, and the couple moved to Indianapolis.&lt;ref name=IN200-12&gt;Madison, "Katherine 'Flossie' Bailey" in ''Indiana's 200'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Bailey died in Indianapolis on February 6, 1952.&lt;ref name="Obit (1952)" /&gt; As an activist and president of the Indiana NAACP in the 1930s, her leadership helped establish a foundation for the civil rights movement of the 1950s.&lt;ref name=IN200-12/&gt;

:''For the band, see [[Glass Harp (band)]] or for the similar instrument, see [[Glass harmonica]]''.

A '''glass harp''' (also called '''musical glasses''',''' singing glasses''', '''angelic organ''', '''verrilion''' or '''ghost fiddle''') is a [[musical instrument]] made of upright [[wine glass]]es.

It is played by running moistened or chalked fingers around the rim of the glasses. Each glass is tuned to a different pitch, either by grinding each goblet to the specified pitch, in which case the tuning is invariable, or by filling the glass with water until the desired pitch is achieved.

==History==

Musical glasses were documented in [[Persian traditional music|Persia]] in the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Harvard"&gt;[[Willi Apel|Apel, Willi]] (1969). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=TMdf1SioFk4C&amp;pg=PA347&amp;dq=Adagio+and+Rondo+for+glass+harmonica,+flute,+oboe,+viola+and+cello&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjFks6PxPjRAhUF94MKHY7_AZAQ6AEIRzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Adagio%20and%20Rondo%20for%20glass%20harmonica%2C%20flute%2C%20oboe%2C%20viola%20and%20cello&amp;f=false Harvard Dictionary of Music]'', p.347. Harvard. {{ISBN|9780674375017}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The glass harp was created in 1741 by Irishman [[Richard Pockrich (inventor)|Richard Pockrich]], who is known as the first virtuoso of the musical glasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pockrich called his instrument the "angelic organ" and it was played with sticks, rather than by rubbing the glasses with a moistened finger. It was reported in 1760 that, "Pockrich played Handel's ''[[Water Music]]'' on the glasses."&lt;ref name="Harvard"/&gt; His successful concert career was brought to a premature end by a fire in which both the inventor and instrument perished in 1759.&lt;ref&gt;Sibyl Marcuse, "Angelic Organ", ''Musical Instruments: A Comprehensive Dictionary'', corrected edition, Norton Library N758 (New York: W. W.Norton, 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

The composer [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] played the musical glasses. He performed in London in 1746,&lt;ref name="Harvard"/&gt; and Copenhagen. His instrument consisted of 26 goblets,&lt;ref&gt;Sibyl Marcuse, "Musical Glasses", ''Musical Instruments: A Comprehensive Dictionary'', corrected edition, Norton Library N758 (New York: W. W.Norton, 1975).&lt;/ref&gt; "filled with spring water."&lt;ref name="Harvard"/&gt;

The instrument was popular in the 18th century. Pockrich's contemporary, Ford, published ''Instructions for the Playing of the Musical Glasses'' while Bartl published a German version.&lt;ref&gt;P1205; ''[[W. A. Mozart]]''; Hermann Abert, Stewart Spencer (translator), Cliff Eisen; Yale University Press, 2007; {{ISBN|0-300-07223-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929 [[Bruno Hoffmann]] invented a glass harp consisting, "of 46 individually tuned glasses fixed on a resonant table."&lt;ref name="Harvard"/&gt;

===''The Art of Instrumentation''===
{{quote|This instrument, consisting of a number of tuned glasses, adapts itself excellently for the accompaniment of a [[Zither]], owing to its delicate tonal-quality. The following is its usual compass: [image: G&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] But some possess a compass of only two octaves from [image: C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] to [image: C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]. Its tone [timbre] is very similar to the [[harmonic]]s of a Zither, and if treated skilfully can be easily produced, in all tonal-shadings, from the most delicate 'pianissimo' to a moderate 'forte.' It is very effective as a solo instrument, with the accompaniment of a muted [[string quartet]]te. Only [[sustain (music)|sustained]] songs and [[melody|melodious]] passages are adapted for this instrument.|Prof. Henri Kling, ''The Art of Instrumentation'' (1905)&lt;ref&gt;Kling, Henri (1905).

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Musical Glasses 3.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Gloria Parker]] playing the [[Glass harp]] or Musical Glasses with [[Lionel Hampton]] and his orchestra.]] --&gt;
On March 9, 1938, [[Bruno Hoffmann]] performed on the glass harp at the London Museum in a program including Mozart's Adagio (K. 356) and Quintet for harmonica, flute, viola, oboe, and cello (K. 617), accompanied by [[Geoffrey Gilbert]], [[Leon Goossens]], [[Frederick Riddle]], and James Whitehead. It was an "exquisite performance, in which the flute and viola in their upper registers were almost indistinguishable from the glasses, [which] held spell-bound a large audience, crowded over the floor, stairs and galleries".&lt;ref&gt;A. Hyatt King, "The Musical Glasses and Glass Harmonica", ''Proceedings of the Royal Musical Association'', 72nd Session (1945–46): 97–122. Citation on 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 18, 1979, [[Gloria Parker]] performed as a musical glasses [[solo (music)|solo]]ist with the [[Hartford Symphony Orchestra]] at the [[Jai alai|Jai Alai]] Fronton in Hartford, Connecticut, USA. [[Richard Hayman]], noted for his arrangements for [[Boston Pops]] conductor [[Arthur Fiedler]], was the guest conductor for the 90-piece orchestra that accompanied the musical glasses which included songs such as "[[Lara's Theme]]" from the movie ''[[Dr. Zhivago (film)|Dr. Zhivago]]'', "[[Lover (song)|Lover]]" and "[[Amor (1943 song)|Amor"]].

There are several current musicians who professionally play the glass harp. Among them are the [[Glass Duo]] from Poland, Philipp Marguerre and Clemens Hofinger in Germany, France's Jean Chatillion and Thomas Bloch, Brien Engel, and Dennis James in the United States and Canada's Real Berthiaume.
Glasses have been also used by famous rock band [[Pink Floyd]] during the recording of "[[Shine On You Crazy Diamond]]" on their ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'' album, recorded and released in 1975. [[Igor Sklyarov (musician)|Igor Sklyarov]] played the glass harp on the same song during two 2006 concerts recorded in [[Venice]], [[Italy]] by former guitarist [[David Gilmour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Igor Sklyarov takes part in David Gilmour's Venetian concerts | url=http://www.crystaltrio.com/eng_projects-2-719.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilmour also used the effect during his August 26, 2006, concert in [[Gdańsk]], [[Poland]], with the help of [[Guy Pratt]], [[Phil Manzanera]] and [[Dick Parry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Shine On You Crazy Diamond Part I (Live in Gdansk - David Gilmour) | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o76NEJCXG78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both recordings are available on Gilmour's ''[[Live in Gdańsk]]'' CD, although the Venice recording is only available on the five-disc version of the album or as an internet download with the three- and four-disc versions.

A colorful set of water tuned glasses is depicted as being played with a pair of metal sticks in several key scenes of the extremely successful 2009 Korean TV drama ''[[Queen Seon Deok]]'', showing the series' main anti-heroine [[Mishil]] ([[Go Hyun-jung]]) playing her own haunting theme melody ''Yurijan (Glasses)'' on that instrument.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., minutes 1:04 to 4:37 of [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-5agx2k1Wc scene #6 of the second episode] (birth of the future queen Seondeok).&lt;/ref&gt;

*''A Toast To Christmas with the Singing Glasses'' is an album recorded and released in 1980, composed and performed by [[Gloria Parker]]. Fourteen well-known carols are performed with the glass harp producing flute-like sounds on crystal glasses, marking the first commercial album to use glasses as a musical instrument.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

[[File:Uniform tiling 63-t2.png|thumb|right|150px|Grid cells derive their name from the fact that connecting the centers of their firing fields gives a triangular grid.]]

Grid cells were discovered in 2005 by [[Edvard Moser]], [[May-Britt Moser]] and their students Torkel Hafting, Marianne Fyhn and Sturla Molden at the [[Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience and Centre for the Biology of Memory|Centre for the Biology of Memory]] (CBM) in Norway. They were awarded the 2014 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] together with [[John O'Keefe (neuroscientist)|John O'Keefe]] for their discoveries of cells that constitute a positioning system in the brain. The arrangement of spatial firing fields all at equal distances from their neighbors led to a hypothesis that these cells encode a cognitive representation of [[Euclidean space]].&lt;ref name=Hafting2005&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = T.

In a typical experimental study, an [[single unit recording|electrode]] capable of recording the activity of an individual [[neuron]] is implanted in the [[cerebral cortex]] of a rat, in a section called the dorsomedial [[entorhinal cortex]], and recordings are made as the rat moves around freely in an open arena. For a grid cell, if a dot is placed at the location of the rat's head every time the neuron emits an [[action potential]], then as illustrated in the adjoining figure, these dots build up over time to form a set of small clusters, and the clusters form the vertices of a grid of equilateral triangles. This regular triangle-pattern is what distinguishes grid cells from other types of cells that show spatial firing. By contrast, if a [[place cell]] from the rat hippocampus is examined in the same way (i.e., by placing a dot at the location of the rat's head whenever the cell emits an action potential), then the dots build up to form small clusters, but frequently there is only one cluster (one "place field") in a given environment, and even when multiple clusters are seen, there is no perceptible regularity in their arrangement.

==Background==
In 1971, [[John O'Keefe (neuroscientist)|John O'Keefe]] and Jonathon Dostrovsky reported the discovery of [[place cell]]s in the rat [[hippocampus]]—cells that fire action potentials when an animal passes through a specific small region of space, which is called the ''place field'' of the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

| issue = 1
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This discovery, although controversial at first, led to a series of investigations that culminated in the 1978 publication of a book by O'Keefe and his colleague [[Lynn Nadel]] called ''The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map'' (a phrase that also appeared in the title of the 1971 paper)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map |authors=O'Keefe J, Nadel L |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1978 |url=http://www.cognitivemap.net/HCMpdf/HCMChapters.html |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;—the book argued that the hippocampal neural network instantiates [[cognitive map]]s as hypothesized by the psychologist [[Edward C. Tolman]].  This theory aroused a great deal of interest, and motivated hundreds of experimental studies aimed at clarifying the role of the hippocampus in spatial memory and spatial navigation.

Because the entorhinal cortex provides by far the largest input to the hippocampus, it was clearly important to understand the spatial firing properties of entorhinal neurons.  The earliest studies, such as Quirk ''et al.'' (1992), described neurons in the entorhinal cortex as having relatively large and fuzzy place fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Mosers, however, thought it was possible that a different result would be obtained if recordings were made from a different part of the entorhinal cortex.  The entorhinal cortex is a strip of tissue running along the back edge of the rat brain from the ventral to the dorsal sides.  Anatomical studies had shown that different sectors of the entorhinal cortex project to different levels of the hippocampus:  the dorsal end of the EC projects to the dorsal hippocampus, the ventral end to the ventral hippocampus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was relevant because several studies had shown that place cells in the dorsal hippocampus have considerably sharper place fields than cells from more ventral levels.&lt;ref name=Maurer2005&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = A. P.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Every study of entorhinal spatial activity prior to 2004, however, had made use of electrodes implanted near the ventral end of the EC.  Accordingly, together with Marianne Fyhn, Sturla Molden and Menno Witter, the Mosers set out to examine spatial firing from the different dorsal-to-ventral levels of the entorhinal cortex. They found that in the dorsal part of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), cells had sharply defined place fields like in the hippocampus but the cells fired at multiple locations.&lt;ref name=Fyhn2004&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = M.

The next set of experiments, reported in 2005, made use of a larger environment, which led to the recognition that the cells were actually firing in a hexagonal grid pattern.&lt;ref name=Hafting2005/&gt; The study showed that cells at similar dorsal-to-ventral MEC levels had similar grid spacing and grid orientation but the phase of the grid (the offset of the grid vertices relative to the x and y axes) appeared to be randomly distributed between cells. The periodic firing pattern was expressed independently of the configuration of landmarks, in darkness as well as in the presence of visible landmarks and independently of changes in the animal’s speed and direction, leading the authors to suggest that grid cells expressed a path-integration dependent dynamic computation of the animal’s location.

For their discovery of grid cells, May-Britt Moser, and Edvard Moser were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 2014 alongside John O'Keefe.

==Properties==
[[File:Autocorrelation image.jpg|thumb|Spatial autocorrelogram of the neuronal activity of the grid cell from the first figure.]]

Grid cells are neurons that fire when a freely moving animal traverses a set of small regions (firing fields) which are roughly equal in size and arranged in a periodic triangular array that covers the entire available environment.&lt;ref name=Hafting2005/&gt;  Cells with this firing pattern have been found in all layers of the dorsocaudal medial [[entorhinal cortex]] (dMEC), but cells in different layers tend to differ in other respects.  Layer II contains the largest density of pure grid cells, in the sense that they fire equally regardless of the direction in which an animal traverses a grid location.  Grid cells from deeper layers are intermingled with conjunctive cells&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sargolini|first=F.|title=Conjunctive Representation of Position, Direction, and Velocity in Entorhinal Cortex|journal=Science|date=5 May 2006|volume=312|issue=5774|pages=758–762|doi=10.1126/science.1125572|bibcode = 2006Sci...312..758S|pmid=16675704}}&lt;!--|accessdate=1 March 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and [[head direction cells]] (i.e. in layers III, V and VI there are cells with a grid-like pattern that fire only when the animal is facing a particular direction).&lt;ref name=Sargolini2006&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = F.

Grid cells that lie next to one another (i.e., cells recorded from the same electrode) usually show the same grid spacing and orientation, but their grid vertices are displaced from one another by apparently random offsets.  Cells recorded from separate electrodes at a distance from one another, however, frequently show different grid spacings.  Cells that are located more ventrally (that is, farther from the dorsal border of the MEC) generally have larger firing fields at each grid vertex, and correspondingly greater spacing between the grid vertices.&lt;ref name=Hafting2005/&gt;  The total range of grid spacings is not well established:  the initial report described a roughly twofold range of grid spacings (from 39&amp;nbsp;cm to 73&amp;nbsp;cm) across the dorsalmost part (upper 25%) of the MEC,&lt;ref name=Hafting2005/&gt; but there are indications of considerably larger grid scales in more ventral zones.  Brun ''et al.'' (2008) recorded grid cells from multiple levels in rats running along an 18-meter track, and found that the grid spacing expanded from about 25&amp;nbsp;cm in their dorsalmost sites to about 3 m at the ventralmost sites.&lt;ref name=Brun2008&gt;{{Cite journal

Grid cell activity does not require visual input, since grid patterns remain unchanged when all the lights in an environment are turned off.&lt;ref name=Hafting2005/&gt;  When visual cues are present, however, they exert strong control over the alignment of the grids: Rotating a cue card on the wall of a cylinder causes grid patterns to rotate by the same amount.&lt;ref name=Hafting2005/&gt;  Grid patterns appear on the first entrance of an animal into a novel environment, and usually remain stable thereafter.&lt;ref name=Hafting2005/&gt;  When an animal is moved into a completely different environment, grid cells maintain their grid spacing, and the grids of neighboring cells maintain their relative offsets.&lt;ref name=Hafting2005/&gt;

==Interactions with hippocampal place cells==

When a rat is moved to a different environment, the spatial activity patterns of hippocampal place cells usually show ''"complete remapping"''—that is, the pattern of place fields reorganizes in a way that bears no detectable resemblance to the pattern in the original environment (Muller and Kubie, 1987).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Muller | first1 = RU | last2 = Kubie | first2 = JL | year = 1987 | title = The effects of changes in the environment on the spatial firing of hippocampal complex-spike cells | url = | journal = J Neurosci | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 1951–68 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the features of an environment are altered less radically, however, the place field pattern may show a lesser degree of change, referred to as ''"rate remapping"'', in which many cells alter their firing rates but the majority of cells retain place fields in the same locations as before.  Fyhn ''et al.'' (2007) examined this phenomenon using simultaneous recordings of hippocampal and entorhinal cells, and found that in situations where the hippocampus shows rate remapping, grid cells show unaltered firing patterns, whereas when the hippocampus shows complete remapping, grid cell firing patterns show unpredictable shifts and rotations.&lt;ref name=Fyhn2007&gt;{{Cite journal

==Theta rhythmicity==

Neural activity in nearly every part of the hippocampal system is modulated by the limbic [[theta rhythm]], which has a frequency range of about 6–9&amp;nbsp;Hz in rats. The entorhinal cortex is no exception:  like the hippocampus, it receives [[acetylcholine|cholinergic]] and [[GABA]]ergic input from the [[medial septum|medial septal area]], the central controller of theta.  Grid cells, like hippocampal place cells, show strong theta modulation.&lt;ref name=Hafting2005/&gt;  Grid cells from layer II of the MEC also resemble hippocampal place cells in that they show [[Place cell#Phase precession|phase precession]]—that is, their spike activity advances from late to early phases of the theta cycle as an animal passes through a grid vertex.  Most grid cells from layer III do not precess, but their spike activity is largely confined to half of the theta cycle.  The grid cell phase precession is not derived from the hippocampus, because it continues to appear in animals whose hippocampus has been inactivated by an agonist of GABA.&lt;ref name=Hafting2008&gt;{{Cite journal

==Possible functions==

Many species of mammals can keep track of spatial location even in the absence of visual, auditory, olfactory, or tactile cues, by integrating their movements—the ability to do this is referred to in the literature as [[path integration]]. A number of theoretical models have explored mechanisms by which path integration could be performed by neural networks. In most models, such as those of Samsonovich and McNaughton (1997)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Because cells in the MEC encode information about position (grid cells&lt;ref name=Hafting2005/&gt;) and movement (head direction cells and conjunctive position-by-direction cells&lt;ref name=Sargolini2006/&gt;), this area is currently viewed as the most promising candidate for the place in the brain where path integration occurs. However, the question remains unresolved, as in humans the entorhinal cortex does not appear to be required for path integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Hafting et al. (2005) suggested that a place code is computed in the entorhinal cortex and fed into the [[hippocampus]], which may make the associations between place and events that are needed for the formation of memories.

In contrast to a hippocampal [[place cell]], a grid cell has multiple firing fields, with regular spacing, which tessellate the environment in a hexagonal pattern. The unique properties of grid cells are as follows:

[[File:Equilateral Triangle Lattice.svg|thumb|right|250px|A hexagonal lattice.]]
# Grid cells have firing fields dispersed over the entire environment (in contrast to place fields which are restricted to certain specific regions of the environment)
# The firing fields are organized into a [[hexagonal lattice]]
# Firing fields are generally equally spaced apart, such that the distance from one firing field to all six adjacent firing fields is approximately the same (though when an environment is resized, the field spacing may shrink or expand differently in different directions; Barry et al. 2007)
# Firing fields are equally positioned, such that the six neighboring fields are located at approximately 60 degree increments

The grid cells are anchored to external landmarks, but persist in darkness, suggesting that grid cells may be part of a self-motion based map of the spatial environment.

In [[justice]] and [[law]], '''house arrest''' (also called '''home confinement''', '''home detention''', or, in modern times, '''electronic monitoring''') is a measure by which a person is confined by the authorities to their [[House|residence]]. Only those with a house are allowed to be sentenced to arrest in their residence. [[Travel]] is usually restricted, if allowed at all. House arrest is an alternative to being in a [[prison]] while pre-trial or sentenced.

While house arrest can be applied to criminal cases when prison does not seem an appropriate measure, the term is often applied to the use of house confinement as a measure of repression by [[authoritarian]] governments against political [[dissident]]s. In that case, typically, the person under house arrest does not have access to any [[telephone|means of communication]]. If electronic communication is allowed, conversations will most likely be monitored. With some electronic monitoring units, the conversations of prisoners can be directly monitored via the unit itself.

==History==
Judges have imposed sentences of home confinement, as an alternative to prison, as far back as the 17th century. [[Galileo]] was confined to his home following his [[Galileo affair|infamous trial]] in 1633. Political authorities have often confined leaders to house arrest who were deposed in a coup d'état, but this method was not widely used to confine numerous common criminals.

This method did not become a widespread alternative to imprisonment in the United States and other western countries until the late 20th century, when newly designed electronic monitoring devices made it inexpensive and easy to manage by corrections authorities.  Although Boston was using house arrest for a variety of arrangements, the first-ever court sentence of house arrest with an [[electronic bracelet]] was in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2209984/ |work=Slate Magazine |title=You're Grounded! How do you qualify for house arrest? |author=Juliet Lapidos |date=January 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
Home detention is an alternative to [[Incarceration|imprisonment]]; its goals are both to reduce recidivism and to decrease the number of prisoners, thereby saving money for states and other jurisdictions. It is a corrective to mandatory sentencing laws that greatly increased the incarceration rates in the United States.&lt;ref name=lev&gt;Levinson, David. (2002). ''Encyclopedia of Crime and Punishment: Volumes I-IV.'' SAGE Publications. p. 859. {{ISBN|978-0-7619-2258-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It allows eligible offenders to retain or seek employment, maintain family relationships and responsibilities and attend rehabilitative programs that contribute towards addressing the causes of their offending.

The terms of house arrest can differ, but most programs allow employed offenders to continue to work, and confine them to their residence only during non-working hours. Offenders are commonly allowed to leave their home for specific purposes; examples can include visits to the [[probation officer]] or police station, religious services, education, attorney visits, court appearances, and medical appointments.&lt;ref&gt;Spohn, Cassia. (2008). ''How Do Judges Decide?: The Search for Fairness and Justice in Punishment.'' SAGE Publications Inc. p. 52. {{ISBN|978-1-4129-6104-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-19/strauss-kahn-granted-bail-pending-trial-in-hotel-maid-sexual-assault-case.html|title=Strauss-Kahn May Have Spent Last Night in Jail After Bail|author=Karen Freifeld, Chris Dolmetsch and Don Jeffrey|date=20 May 2011|work=Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many programs also allow the convict to leave their residence during regular, pre-approved times in order to carry out general household errands, such as food shopping and laundry. Offenders may have to respond to communications from a higher authority to verify that they are at home when required to be. Exceptions are often made to allow visitors to visit the offender.&lt;ref&gt;Mele, Christopher. (2005). ''Civil Penalties, Social Consequences.'' Routledge. p. 139. {{ISBN|978-0-415-94823-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The types of house arrest vary in severity according to the requirements of the court order. A [[curfew]] may restrict an offender to their house at certain times, usually during hours of darkness. "Home confinement" or detention requires an offender to remain at home at all times, apart from the above-mentioned exceptions. The most serious level of house arrest is "home incarceration", under which an offender is restricted to their residence 24 hours a day/7 days a week, except for court-approved treatment programs, court appearances, and medical appointments.&lt;ref name=lev/&gt;

In some exceptional cases, it is possible for a person to be placed under house arrest without [[Trial (law)|trial]] or [[Lawyer|legal representation]], and subject to restrictions on their associates.&lt;ref&gt;Jupp, James; Nieuwenhuysen, John; Dawson, Emma. (2007). ''Social Cohesion in Australia.'' Cambridge University Press. p. 183. {{ISBN|978-0-521-70943-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries this type of detention without trial has been criticized for breaching the offender's [[human rights|human right]] to a fair trial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4715478.stm "Q&amp;A: Terrorism laws"]. BBC News Online. July 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In countries with authoritarian systems of government, the government may use such measures to stifle dissent.

==Using technology for enforcement==
In some countries, house arrest is often enforced through the use of technology products or services.  One method is an electronic sensor locked around the offender's ankle (technically called an [[ankle monitor]], also referred to as a [[tether]]). The electronic sensor transmits a [[GPS]] signal to a base handset. The base handset is connected to a police station or for-profit monitoring service.

If the offender goes too far from their home, the violation is recorded, and the police will be notified. To discourage tampering, many ankle monitors detect attempted removal.  The monitoring service is often contracted out to private companies, which assign employees to electronically monitor many convicts simultaneously. If a violation occurs the unit signals the office or officer in charge immediately, depending on the severity of the violation. The officer will either call or verify the participant's whereabouts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitaltechnologies-2000.com/?page_id=459{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The monitoring service notifies a convict's probation officer. The electronic surveillance together with frequent contact with their probation officer and checks by the security guards provides for a secure environment.

Another method of ensuring house arrest compliance is achieved through the use of automated calling services that require no human contact to check on the offender. Random calls are made to the residence. The  respondent's answer is recorded and compared automatically to the offender's voice pattern. Authorities are notified only if the call is not answered or if the recorded answer does not match the offender's voice pattern.

[[Electronic tagging|Electronic monitoring]] is considered a highly economical alternative to the cost of imprisoning offenders. In many states or jurisdictions, the convict is often required to pay for the monitoring as part of his or her sentence.

===Italy===
In Italy, house arrest (in Italian ''arresti domiciliari'') is a common practice of [[Remand (detention)|detaining suspects]], as an alternative to detention in a correctional facility, and is also commonly practiced on those felons who are close to the end of their prison terms, or for those whose health condition does not allow residence in a correctional facility, except some particular cases of extremely dangerous persons. As per article 284 of the Italian Penal Procedure Code, house arrest is imposed by a judge, who orders the suspect to stay confined in his house, home, residence, private property, or any other place of cure or assistance where he/she may be housed at the moment. When necessary, the judge may also forbid any contact between the subject and any person other than those who cohabit with him/her or who assist him/her. If the subject is unable to take care of his/her life necessities or if he/she is in conditions of absolute poverty, the judge may authorize him/her to leave his/her home for the strict necessary time to take care of said needs or to exercise a job. The prosecuting authorities and law enforcement can check at any moment whether the subject, who is ''[[de facto]]'' considered in state of detention, is complying with the order; violation of house arrest terms is immediately followed by transfer to a correctional facility. House arrests cannot be applied to a subject that has been found guilty of [[Prison escape|escape]] within the previous five years.

Notable cases:
* [[Erich Priebke]], former [[SS]] captain, condemned for war crimes ([[Ardeatine massacre]] in Rome on 24 March 1944, when 335 Italian civilians were killed by Nazi force of occupation) to life imprisonment in 1996, spent under house arrest for the last part of his life, from 1998 to 2013 (when he died age of 100).
* [[Adriano Sofri]], journalist and former far left political leader, convicted in 1997 for the murder of Police Officer [[Luigi Calabresi]] (1972), spent under house arrest, for health reasons, the period between 2005 and 2012.
* [[Silvia Baraldini]], activist of [[Black Liberation Army]] in the US (sentenced to 43 years by Federal Court under the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO) for conspiring to commit two armed robberies, driving a secondary getaway car during the prison break of murder convict and fellow political activist [[Assata Shakur]], and contempt of court), transferred to Italy in 1999, spent the sentence on house arrest from 2001 to 2006, for health reasons.
* Giovanni Scattone and Salvatore Ferraro, convicted for manslaughter of [[Marta Russo]], spent a period of their sentence under house arrest and community service.

===New Zealand===
At sentencing, the judge may sentence an offender to home detention where they would otherwise receive a short-term prison sentence (i.e. two years or less). Home detention sentences range from 14 days and 12 months; offenders are confined to their approved residence 24 hours a day and may only leave with the permission of their probation officer.

Electronic monitoring equipment is extensively used by the [[New Zealand Department of Corrections]] to ensure that convicted offenders subject to home detention remain within approved areas. This takes the form of a Global Positioning System tracker fitted to the offender's ankle and monitoring units located at their residence and place of employment. {{as of|2015}} over three thousand persons were serving home detention sentences under GPS surveillance.

*[[Phil Rudd]], two-time drummer with Australian rock legends [[AC/DC]], was sentenced to eight months' home detention at his waterfront mansion in [[Tauranga]] for charges relating to [[methamphetamine]] possession and making [[death threats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/acdcs-phil-rudd-sentenced-to-house-detention-for-eight-months-201597|title=AC/DC's Phil Rudd Sentenced to House Detention for Eight Months|work=Us Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharif was put in a forced trial, but due to foreign pressure exerted by [[Saudi Arabia]] and the United States, Sharif was exiled to Saudi Arabia which narrowly spared his life to face the same fate as of Bhutto. In 2010, Sharif was again put in house arrest by President Asif Ali Zardari when he announced a long march to support the [[Lawyers' Movement]]. However, Sharif broke the house arrest in his vehicle and drove to Islamabad to join the Movement.

'''Identity negotiation''' refers to the processes through which people reach agreements regarding "who is who" in their relationships. Once these agreements are reached, people are expected to remain faithful to the [[identity (social science)|identities]] they have agreed to assume. The process of identity negotiation thus establishes what people can expect of one another. Identity negotiation thus provides the interpersonal "glue" that holds relationships together.

The idea that identities are negotiated originated in the [[sociology|sociological]] literature during the middle of the 20th century. A leading figure in this movement was [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] (1959, 1961), who asserted that the first order of business in social interaction is establishing a "working consensus" or agreement regarding the roles each person will assume in the interaction. Weinstein and Deutschberger (1964), and later McCall and Simmons (1966),  built on this work by elaborating the interpersonal processes that unfold after interaction partners reach an initial working consensus. Within psychology, these ideas were elaborated by Secord and Backman (1965) and Schlenker (1985). The actual phrase "identity negotiation" was introduced by [[William Swann|Swann]] (1987), who emphasized the tension between two competing processes in social interaction, [[behavioral confirmation]] and [[self-verification]]. Behavioral confirmation occurs when one person (the "perceiver") encourages another person (the "target") to behave in ways that confirm the expectancies of the perceiver (e.g., Rosenthal &amp; Jacobson, 1968; Snyder &amp; Klein, 2005; Snyder, Tanke, &amp; [[Ellen S. Berscheid|Berscheid]], 1977). Self-verification occurs when the "target" persuades the "perceiver" to behave in a manner that verifies the target's firmly held self-views or identities (Swann, 1983; 1996).

==Psychological view==

When the expectancies of perceivers clash with the [[self-concept|self-views]] of targets, a "battle of wills" may occur (Swann &amp; Ely, 1984). Such "battles" can range from short-lived, mild disagreements that are quickly and easily solved to highly pitched confrontations that are combative and contentious. On such occasions, the identity negotiation process represents the means through which these conflicting tendencies are reconciled.

More often than not, the identity negotiation process seems to favor self-verification, which means that people tend to develop expectancies that are congruent with the self-views of target persons (e.g., Major, Cozzarelli, Testa, &amp; McFarlin, 1988); McNulty &amp; Swann, 1994; Swann, Milton, &amp; Polzer, 2000; Swann &amp; Ely, 1984). Such congruence is personally adaptive for targets because it allows them to maintain stable identities and having stable identities is generally adaptive. That is, stable identities not only tell people how to behave, they also afford people with a sense of psychological coherence that reinforces their conviction that they know what to do and the consequences of doing it.

Groups also benefit when there is congruence among group members. When people maintain stable images of themselves, other members of the organization can count on them to "be" the same person day in and day out and the identity negotiation process can unfold automatically. This may free people to devote their conscious attention to the work at hand, which may explain why researchers have found that groups characterized by high levels of congruence perform better (Swann et al., 2000). Also, just as demographic diversity tends to undermine group performance when congruence is low, diversity improves performance when congruence is high (Polzer, Milton, &amp; Swann, 2003; Swann, Polzer, Seyle, &amp; Ko, 2004).

Some instances of incongruence in relationships are inevitable. Sudden or unanticipated changes of status or role of one person, or even the introduction of a novel person into a group, may produce discrepancies between people's self-views and the expectancies of others. In work settings, promotions can foment expectancy violations (cf, Burgoon, 1978) if some members of the organization refuse to update their appraisals of the recently promoted person. When incongruence occurs, it will disturb the normal flow of social interaction. Instead of going about their routine tasks, interaction partners will be compelled to shift their conscious attention to the task of accommodating the identity change that is the source of the disruption. Frequent or difficult-to-resolve disruptions could be damaging to the quality of social interactions and ultimately interfere with relationship quality, satisfaction and productivity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21557">'''Imagined interactions'''  (IIs) are a type of social [[cognition]] and [[mental imagery]] grounded in [[symbolic interactionism]] in which individuals imagine conversations with significant others for a variety of purposes (Honeycutt, 2003; 2015).   The research program was founded and created by [[James M. Honeycutt]] in 1987, who was designated an LSU Distinguished Professor in 2012.  He provided a keynote address at the American Association for the Study of Mental Imagery at Yale University in 1987 discussing the functions of imagined interactions and mental imagery.  In 2006, Honeycutt's book, "Imagined Interactions: Daydreaming about Communication" (2003), was awarded Distinguished Book of the Year by the National Communication Association for developing the original formulations and the II construct which has provided a beneficial mechanism for operationalizing the study of intrapersonal communication, social cognition, daydreaming, and mental imagery.  Furthermore, imagined interactions can be used in sports imagery as athletes "imagine" positive outcomes of their executions on specific plays or formations (Keaton, Gearhart, &amp; Honeycutt, 2014).

==Theoretical Foundation of Imagined Interactions==
In the early research, IIs were suggested as a means to operationalize the study of daydreaming as it works to shape communication interpersonally, emotions, and personality.  They have been examined cross-culturally (McCann, Honeycutt, &amp; Keaton, 2010).

Scripts are activated mindlessly and created through imagined interactions, as people envision contingency plans for actions. In contrast to mindless processing, engaging in imagined interaction requires conscious cognitive processing.  Imagined interactions are a type of daydreaming that have definitive attributes  and serve a number of functions including rehearsal, self-understanding, relational maintenance, managing conflict, catharsis, and compensation.  Retroactive imagined interactions often occur in television shows in terms of “flashbacks” as characters relive prior conversations in their mind.

Honeycutt et al. (1989) discuss how IIs have their theoretical foundation in the work of symbolic interactionists and phenemonologists, including Mead (1934), Dewey (1922) and Schutz (1962). As individuals engage in imagined interactions, cognitive scripts are activated as people imagine how they might react in an upcoming conversation. Imagined interactions help people prepare for encounters. They also help people to relive previous conversations and foster good or bad memories.

==Attributes of Imagined Interactions==

Within imagined interaction theory, Honeycutt (2003) defines eight attributes or characteristics of IIs that can be measured as personality traits or contextually in various situations or with specific individuals.  For example, while a person may have a lot of IIs in their daily life, they may have IIs while doing their job or a particular task.  Having IIs while playing tennis would interfere with serving and returning the ball.

Specifically, the eight attributes include the following:

1. Frequency—How often a person has IIs ranging from rarely to quite frequently.  For example, lonely people have fewer IIs because they have fewer interaction scenes to access compared to nonlonely people (Honeycutt, 2003).

2. Proactivity—Proactivity refers to those IIs which are engaged in prior to actual interaction, and research has shown that such IIs tend to occur prior to actual interactions.  For example, a worker may desire a raise, so she decides to approach her boss concerning the matter.  Using an II proactively, she may visualize herself going into her boss’s office and may even devise a plan for what she will say. This is an example of a proactive II.

3. Retroactivity— Retroactivity refers to reviewing an interaction after it has taken place. Proactive and retroactive IIs can simultaneously occur so that conversations are linked together and themes of interpersonal relationships emerge (Honeycutt, 2014).  For example, in order to characterize a relationship as competitive or hostile with another person, the person recalls more conversations in which disagreements were communicated as opposed to pleasant, cooperative transactions (Honeycutt, 2010).

4. Variety—Variety refers to the diversity of topics and partners within IIs.   IIs which involve various topics are related to the imaginer’s internal locus of control which lends credence to the idea that chronically lonely individuals lack variety in their IIs.  However, a person may have IIs with a variety of partners on few topics (e.g., Football plays and strategies are more likely to be the focus of discussion among a team's coaches while in practice in order not be distracted).

5. Discrepancy— Discrepancy refers to the incongruity between IIs and the actual interaction they address; in other words, how similar or different an II is from the relevant interaction.  Studies suggest that individuals who are chronically lonely have highly discrepant IIs due to their limited prior interactions upon which to base them.  Researchers suspect the high discrepancy of IIs that occurs  prior to a new interaction perpetuates and reinforces the state of loneliness (Honeycutt, 2003).  

6. Self-Dominance—This attribute addresses who is more prominent in the II: self, both, or other.   Research shows that self dominance is in part determined by the scenario of the II.  For instance, in IIs involving matters of conflict, the person engaging in the II tends to be more dominant than their II partner.  Self dominance is also influenced by culture and tends to characterize [[collectivistic]] cultures including Japan compared to [[individualistic]] cultures such as America.

7. Valence—Valence reflects how positive or negative [[emotions]] are experienced while imagining the conversation. High valence reflects positive emotional affect while low valence reflects negative emotional affect.  Honeycutt (2003) reviews research indicating that females report having more pleasant IIs.  Level of pleasantness and valence is inversely related to self dominance.

8. Specificity—The final attribute is specificity reflecting the degree of verbal and visual imagery used in the II.  This attribute reflects the level of detail and distinction of images contained within IIs.  Honeycutt (1998–99) found that those individuals reporting a secure attachment style experience high levels of detailed visual and verbal imagery, suggesting high levels of specificity.

==Functions of Imagined Interactions==

Imagined interactions function in the following ways: (1) they keep a relationship alive; (2) they can maintain or resolve conflict; (3) they are used to rehearse messages for future interaction; (4) they aid people in self-understanding through clarifying thoughts and feelings; (5) they provide emotional catharsis by relieving tension; and (6) they compensate for lack of real interaction (Honeycutt, 2003; 2008).

1. Relational Maintenance:  People often imagine talking with others that are important in their lives. Additionally, increased uses of proactive and retroactive IIs aided the ability of imagined interactions to predict relational quality.  Additionally, relational satisfaction was simultaneously predicted by extraversion and being a judger based on the Myers-Brigg personality inventory in which judging reflect placing a premium on organized environments, competence, performance and independence.

2. Conflict Linkage:  For some people, they are obsessed with grudges while others think about how to improve areas of disagreement.  Conflict linkage is also referred to as conflict management.  However, as noted in some of the theorems of imagined interaction conflict-linkage theory which are highlighted below (e.g., theorem four explains rage).  Honeycutt (2004; 2011) explains how conflict linkage is associated with rumination in which people dwell on conflicts and obsessively think about them which is related to depression.  
The second function of conflict linkage has received a great deal of research attention as it explains how individuals often remember arguments that are many years old and it is difficult for them to "let go." As a result, they harbor old grudges. A series of three axioms (e.g., "The communication is the relationship") and nine theorems are discussed explaining how daily conflict is managed or destructively dealt with (see Honeycutt, 2003-2004 for a review). The table below contains an outline of the axioms behind managing conflict in personal relationships and resulting theorems have been empirically tested in social scientific studies.

3. Rehearsal:  People plan their messages and what they are going to say as well as anticipating what others will say to them and how the self will respond.  Rehearsal often helps people in quickly developing contingencies when plans do not go as expected.

4. Self-Understanding: People have IIs in order to understand their beliefs about values, attitudes, or the opinions they have.  IIs allow people to clarify their own thoughts and promote understanding of their own views.

5. Catharsis:  People use IIs to relieve tension and anxiety which further reduces uncertainty.  IIs provide a mechanism to internally get “things off of one’s chest” and release emotions.

6. Compensation:  IIs are used to substitute for real conversations.  If you do not have access to another person, you compensate for the lack communication by imagining conversations with the persons.  The compensation function is rampant during electrical outages or when cell phone towers are blown down during tornadoes, hurricanes, or other environmental diasasters (Honeycutt and Mapp 2011).

==Association with [[Big Five Personality Traits]]==

Honeycutt, Pence, and Gearhart (2013) examined the associations between II attributes and the [[Big Five personality traits]].  In terms of personality, IIs have trait characteristics to the extent they are enduring and stable across similar conditions.  Conversely, they can also be measured in terms of state attributes in which their usage would be higher or lower depending on the particular context.  The Big Five Personality Traits include neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Honeycutt and his associates found that the frequency and proactivity attributes of imagined interactions are  associated with lack of neuroticism and openness to new ideas.  Neuroticism increases egocentrism, depression, and anxiety (Hamilton, Buck, Chory, Beatty, &amp; Patrylak, 2009)).  Highly anxious people have fewer IIs available to them to “predict” their perceived (or believed) unstable environment.  They also found the occurrence of pleasant, non-discrepant IIs in which the self talks more to be moderately associated with the personality dimensions of extraversion and conscientiousness.  Extraverts interact with more individuals than do introverts, so extraverts would therefore imagine themselves having these interactions more often than those who are not extraverted.  Likewise, they discovered that extraverts have more pleasant IIs, which may be  explained through another relationship between extraversion and narcissism.  Extraverts think highly of themselves, and most likely portray themselves in a pleasant manner in their imagined interactions.

'''Correspondence between II Attributes and Functions'''

Although II theory has been a productive concept for research on communication and social cognition, there is an underlying and yet untested assumption within II theory that the eight attributes are related to all six functions and that II functions can be compared and contrasted in terms of II attributes.  Bodie, Honeycutt, and Vickery (2013) conducted two studies exploring the multidimensional nature of functions and attributes.  Their first study revealed both corroborative and contradictory evidence for II theory.  In line with the internal structure of II theory, it was found that conflict linkage and catharsis IIs are more negatively valenced than those used for compensation and relational maintenance.  Rehearsal IIs are more likely to be discrepant than all functions except relational maintenance and are the most proactive.  When compared to all other functions, compensatory IIs contain references to more people and were more frequent.  It also appears that compensatory and relational maintenance functions are similar insofar as each is equally directed toward others and highly specific, providing support for the role of each in close interpersonal relationships (Honeycutt 2003).  Relational maintenance and conflict IIs were used just as frequently as those for catharsis, and relational maintenance IIs were directed toward others in an equivalent manner as those used for conflict.

==Axioms and Theorems of II Conflict-Linkage Theory==

# Interpersonal relationships exist through intrapersonal communication as imagined interactions involving the relational partner outside of actual interaction.
# An interpersonal relationship is maintained and developed through thinking and dwelling on a relational partner.
# A major theme of interpersonal relationships is [[conflict management]] (e.g., cooperation-competition). Managing conflict begins at the intrapersonal level of communication in terms of IIs.

'''Theorems of Conflict'''
# Recurring conflict is maintained through retro- and proactive IIs.
# The current mood of individuals is associated with whether or not their IIs are positive or negative. The better a person's mood, the more positive their IIs will be as well as the inverse.
# When an individual attempts to purposely create positive IIs (e.g., as therapy for a poor marriage), negative intrusive IIs will frequently occur, in many cases with effects that undermine the therapy or positive intent.
# Suppressed rage is a result of the lack of opportunity or inability to articulate arguments with the target of conflict.
# Thinking about conflict may be prompted by exposure to contextual cues including music, substance abuse, and media (TV shows and movies).
# Recurring conflict is reflected in physiological arousal, including physical manifestations of anxiety, such as "fight or flight" response of the sympathetic nervous system.
# In order to enhance constructive conflict, individuals need to imagine positive interactions and outcomes.
# Conflict-linkage has the potential of distorting reality because conflict is kept alive in a person's mind and facilitates anticipating a conversation that most likely will be discrepant from reality since the actual interaction will not occur as planned.
# People use IIs as a mechanism for escape from societal norms. For example, a person may be expected to talk a certain way with their boss in real life, but in their IIs, the persons can be considerably more bold or liberated.

==Imagined Interactions and Political Partisanship==
Madison, Rold, and Honeycutt (2014) examined partisan voting in light of imagined interactions. The researchers asked how respondents  who claim to vote for candidates from certain political parties differ from those who do not in terms of the functions of their IIs. They collected data on voting intentions as well as the functions of the IIs of the survey respondents. Both Republicans and Democrats tend to have fewer self-understanding and rehearsal IIs than those who indicated preference for independent candidates, which suggests that voting along party lines may be a heuristic, or “mindless” behavior. This particular study provided the first pathway between IIs into political psychology.

'''Information and communication technologies for environmental sustainability''' ('''ICT Ensure''') or Green ICT as per the  International Federation of Global &amp; Green ICT "IFGICT" is a general term referring to the application of [[Information and communications technology|information and communication technologies]] (ICTs) within the field of [[environmental sustainability]]. Information and communication technologies are acting as integrating and enabling technologies for the economy and they profoundly affect our society. Recent changes in ICT use globally have damaged the environment (in terms of waste and energy consumption etc.) but also have the potential to support environmental sustainability activities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Murugesan | first1 = S. | last2 = Laplante | first2 = P.

New technologies provide utilities for knowledge acquisition and awareness, early evaluation of new knowledge, reaching agreements and communication of progress in the interest of the [[Quality of life|human welfare]]. This includes ethical aspects of protecting human life as well as aspects of consumer safety and the preservation of our [[natural environment]].

==Application areas==
More and more application areas are becoming relevant to sustainable development in industry, [[health care]], [[agriculture]] and the [[information society]], and they affect the perspectives of ICT, the environment, policy and science. More and more interest has been emerged as well to [[risk management|risk]] and [[disaster management]], adaptation to [[climate change]] and resource use.

The '''International FAIRTRADE Certification Mark''' is an independent [[certification mark]] used in over 50 countries. It appears on products as an independent guarantee that a product has been produced according to Fairtrade political standards.

The FAIRTRADE Mark is owned and protected by [[FLO International|Fairtrade International]] (FLO), on behalf of its 25-member and associate member Fairtrade producer networks and labelling initiatives.

For a product to carry the FAIRTRADE Mark, it must come from [[FLO-CERT]] inspected and certified producer organizations. The crops must be marketed in accordance with the International Fairtrade standards set by [[FLO International|Fairtrade International]]. The supply chain is also monitored by [[FLO-CERT]]. To become certified Fairtrade producers, the primary cooperative and its member farmers must operate to certain political standards, imposed from Europe. FLO-CERT, the for-profit side, handles producer certification, inspecting and certifying producer organisations in more than 50 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.&lt;ref name="FLOCERT"&gt;FLO-CERT (2008).

URL accessed on August 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Fair trade debate]] there are many complaints of failure to enforce these standards, with Fairtrade cooperatives, importers and packers profiting by evading them.&lt;ref&gt;Raynolds, L.

==How it works==
The marketing system for Fairtrade and non-Fairtrade coffee is identical in the consuming countries, using mostly the same importing, packing, distributing and retailing firms. Some independent brands operate a virtual company, paying importers, packers and distributors and advertising agencies to handle their brand, for cost reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, I.A. and A Crane, 'Ethical Decision Making in Fair Trade Companies', Journal of Business Ethics 45: 79–92, 2003. P84&lt;/ref&gt; In the producing country Fairtrade is marketed only by Fairtrade cooperatives, while other coffee is marketed by Fairtrade cooperatives (as uncertified coffee), by other cooperatives and by ordinary traders.&lt;ref&gt;Mohan, S.

Retailers and cafes in the rich countries can sell Fairtrade coffee at any price they like, so nearly all the extra price paid by consumers, 82% to 99%, is kept in the rich countries as increased profit.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, P., ‘Ethical objections to Fairtrade’ Journal of Business Ethics July 2011(DOI) 10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0 www.springerlink.com Accessed at http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm;Valkila, J., Haaparanta, P., &amp; Niemi, N.

Cooperative traders and exporters can sell coffee as Fairtrade certified if they meet the political standards of FLO and they pay a certification and inspection fee. Other administration costs and production costs are incurred to meet these standards. The exporter (not the farmer) is paid a minimum price for Fairtrade certified coffee when the world market is oversupplied, and a Fairtrade premium of 15c per lb at other times. The cooperatives can, on average, sell only a third of their output as Fairtrade, because of lack of demand, and sell the rest at world prices.&lt;ref&gt;Mohan, S. (2010).

Disambiguation:  There is widespread confusion because the fair trade industry standards provided by Fairtrade International (The Fairtrade Labelling Organization) use the word “producer” in many different senses, often in the same specification document.

Fairtrade Standards for small farmers' organizations include requirements for democratic decision making, ensuring that producers have a say in how the Fairtrade Premiums are invested etc. They also include requirements for capacity building and economic strengthening of the organization.

Fairtrade Standards for hired labour situations ensure that employees receive minimum wages and [[collective bargaining|bargain collectively]]. Fairtrade-certified [[plantation]]s must also ensure that there is no forced or [[child labour]] and that health and safety requirements are met. (These labor standards do not apply to, Fairtrade "small farmer cooperatives" though some have an average of 2.39 ha per farmer of just one crop, coffee, with some single farmers having more than 23 ha coffee, implying substantial use of hired labor.)&lt;ref&gt;Weber, J. G. (2011). How much more do growers receive for Fair Trade organic coffee. Food Policy , 677-684.&lt;/ref&gt; In a hired labour situation, Fairtrade Standards require a "joint body" to be set up with representatives from both the management and the employees. This joint body decides on how Fairtrade Premiums will be spent to benefit [[plantation]] employees.

For some products, such as coffee, only Fairtrade Standards for small farmers' organizations are applicable. For others, such as tea, both small farmers' organizations and plantations can be certified.

Trade standards cover the payment of premiums, of minimum prices, where applicable, the provision of credit to buy the crop, and commercial relationships between the exporting cooperative or other organization and the importer.

Typically, in order for a product to be marked as "Fair-trade " at least 20% of its mass must be made up of a Fairtrade product.

Fairtrade Standards and procedures are approved by the Fairtrade International Standards Committee, an external committee comprising all FLO stakeholders (labeling initiatives, producers and traders) and external experts. Fairtrade Standards are set by FLO in accordance to the requirements of the ISEAL Code of Good Practice in standard setting and are in addition the result of a consultation process, involving a variety of stakeholders: producers, traders, external experts, inspectors, certification staff etc.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade International (2006).

==Fairtrade pricing==

The main aspects of the Fairtrade system are the Minimum Price and the Premium. These are paid to the exporting firm, usually a second tier cooperative, not to the farmer. They are not paid for everything produced by the cooperative members, but for that proportion of13their output they are able to sell with the brand 'Fairtrade Certified', typically 17% to as much as 60% of their turnover.
* The '''Fairtrade Premium''' is an extra payment over the market price (e.g. an extra 20c/lb for coffee) which is paid to the exporting organization. The residual after extra costs have been met must be spent on “social projects”  for social and economic development in the producing communities, rather than being given to farmers as extra payment.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade International (FLO) (2011), “Fairtrade Standard for Coffee for Small Producer Organizations”  version: 1 April 2011 http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-01_EN_SPO_Coffee.pdf accessed 15 January 2013; Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V.

They are generally used for improvements in health, education or other social facilities, although it may also be used for certain development projects to enable farmers to improve productivity or reduce their reliance on single commodities. As part of the Fairtrade criteria, registered producers are accountable to [[FLO-CERT]] for the use of this money. 
* The '''Fairtrade Minimum Price''' is a guaranteed price to be paid for a few products like coffee when the world prices collapse. Again, it would usually be spent on "social projects" rather than going to the farmers.

There are complaints that the standards relating to paying of price premiums, minimum prices, provision of credit, etc. by importers in rich countries are not enforced.&lt;ref&gt;de Janvry, A., McIntosh, C., &amp; Sadoulet, E.

They found that this kickback was 10c a pound over a period when the official price premium was 5c or 10c a pound, and this, plus the certification fee, meant that the cooperatives made a loss in years when a premium was payable, and were paid substantially less than the official minimum prices in years when a minimum price was payable. These should have been identified and rectified by the certification agency.

==Fairtrade inspection and certification==

Fairtrade inspection and certification are carried out, for a fee,&lt;ref name="flo-cert.net"&gt;FLO-CERT Gmbh, (2011) “. (2011). Fee System Small Producer Organization - Explanatory Document. Retrieved January 3, 2013, from http://www.flo-cert.net: http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/35.html.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[FLO-CERT]], an independent, for profit, body created by Fairtrade International in 2004. FLO-CERT certifies that both producers and traders have met with Fairtrade Standards and that producers have invested any surplus received through Fairtrade in social projects.

FLO-CERT works with a network of around 100 independent inspectors that regularly visit producer and trade organizations and report back to FLO-CERT. All certification decisions are then taken by a Certification Committee, composed of stakeholders from producers, traders, national labelling organisations and external experts. An Appeals Committee handles all appeals.

FLO-CERT inspections and certification follow the international ISO standards for product certification bodies (ISO 65).

There have been claims that adherence to fair trade standards by producers has been poor and that enforcement of standards by Fairtrade is very weak, notably by Christian Jacquiau.&lt;ref name="swissinfo.ch"&gt;Hamel, I.: 2006, 'Fairtrade Firm Accused of Foul Play', Swiss Info http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/Fair_trade_firm_accused_of_foul_play.html?cid=5351232 23 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and by Paola Ghillani, who spent four years as president of Fairtrade Labelling Organizations.&lt;ref name="swissinfo.ch"/&gt; There is criticism of poor enforcement: labourers on Fairtrade farms in Peru are paid less than the minimum wage;&lt;ref&gt;Weitzman, H.

It reported that they were "also handed evidence of at least one coffee association that received Fairtrade certification despite illegally growing some 20 per cent of its coffee in protected national forest land.&lt;ref name="ft.com"/&gt;

==Costs and returns==

Fairtrade farmers and marketing organizations incur a wide range of costs in achieving and maintaining certification. They incur these costs on all their production, but they can only recover costs on the small part of their production that they can sell as "Fairtrade certified". In practice they can sell only small of their output as Fairtrade, because of lack of demand, and must sell the rest as uncertified at world prices. For example, there is not enough demand to take all the certified coffee produced, so most has to be sold as uncertified. In 2001 only 13.6% could be sold as certified&lt;ref&gt;Muradian, R., and W. Pelupessy. 2005. "Governing the Coffee Chain: The Role of Voluntary Regulatory Systems” World Development 33(12): 2029-2044., cited in de Janvry, A., McIntosh, C., &amp; Sadoulet, E. (2010).

It is generally agreed that some organizations make a loss from their Fairtrade certification.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Utting-Chamorro, K (2005). Does Fairtrade make a difference? The case of small coffee producers in Nicaragua. Development in Practice, Volume 15, Numbers 3 and 4, June 2005, Berndt, C. E. (2007). Is Fair Trade in coffee production fair and useful? Evidence from Costa Rica and Guatemala and implications for policy. Washington DC.: Mercatus 65 Policy Series, Policy Comment 11, Mercatus Centre, George Mason University.),&lt;/ref&gt; but there are very few economic studies showing what happened to the money.

Fairtrade farmers also have to meet a large range of criteria on production: there are limits on using child labour, pesticides, herbicides, genetically modified products etc.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V. (2011) “Generic Fairtrade Trade Standard,” p11  {{cite web|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-02_GTS_EN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502051837/http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-02_GTS_EN.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-02 |df= }}  accessed 15 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; These cost money, mean that the farmers have to do more work in the hot sun, and that they have to hire labour instead of using family labour. In times when world prices are so low that there is no “social premium” and the minimum price is paid, some farmers have negotiated that some of the money is paid to them, rather than being used for social projects.

== History ==
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[image:Oldftlogos2.jpg|thumb|left|Early Fairtrade Certifications Marks]] --&gt;Fairtrade labelled coffee, the first [[Fairtrade labelling|Fairtrade labelled]] product, was first launched in the Netherlands in 1988. The label, launched by [[Nico Roozen]] and Dutch missionary [[Frans van der Hoff]], was then called [[Max Havelaar]] after a fictional Dutch character who opposed the exploitation of coffee pickers in Dutch colonies. Fairtrade labelling allowed Fairtrade Certified goods to be sold outside the [[World shops]] for the first time and into mainstream retailers, reaching a larger consumer segment and boosting sales significantly.

The concept caught on: in the ensuing years, similar non-profit Fairtrade labelling organizations were set up in other European countries and North America, called “Max Havelaar” (in Belgium, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway and France), "Transfair" (in Germany, Luxembourg, Austria, Italy, the United States, Canada and Japan), or carrying a national name: “Fairtrade  Mark” in the UK and Ireland, "Rättvisemärkt" in Sweden, and "Reilu Kauppa" in Finland. Initially, the Max Havelaars and the Transfairs each had their own Fairtrade standards, product committees and monitoring systems. In 1994, a process of convergence among the labelling organizations – or "LIs" (for "Labelling Initiatives") – started with the establishment of a TransMax working group, culminating in 1997 in the creation of [[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International]], now known simply as [[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International|Fairtrade International (FLO)]]. FLO is an umbrella organization whose mission is to set the Fairtrade Standards, support, inspect and certify disadvantaged producers and harmonize the Fairtrade message across the movement.

In 2002, [[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International|FLO]] launched a new FAIRTRADE Certification Mark. The goals of the launch were to improve the visibility of the Mark on supermarket shelves, convey a dynamic, forward-looking image for [[Fairtrade]], facilitate cross border trade and simplify procedures for importers and traders.

The FAIRTRADE Mark harmonization process is still under way – as of March 2011, all but two labelling initiatives {{Dubious|date=June 2010}}([[TransFair USA]] and [[TransFair Canada]]) have fully adopted the new international Certification Mark.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International (2006). [http://www.fairtrade.net/certification_mark.html The Certification Mark]. URL accessed on November 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; These two organizations currently use the [[Fair Trade Certified Mark]], however Canadian organization began actively promoting the new international Certification Mark in 2010 as part of a total transition toward it. TransFair USA has apparently elected to continue with its own mark for the time being,.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transfairusa.org/content/resources/faq-advanced.php#bluegreen TransFair USA FAQ] - "Some LIs, including TransFair USA, have elected to continue using their current labels."&lt;/ref&gt;

At present, over 19 FLO Member Labelling Initiatives are using the International Fairtrade Certification Mark. There are now Fairtrade Certification Marks on dozens of different products, based on FLO’s certification for coffee, tea, rice, bananas, mangoes, cocoa, cotton, sugar, honey, fruit juices, nuts, fresh fruit, quinoa, herbs and spices, wine and footballs etc.&lt;ref name=FLOPRO/&gt;

==Criticism==
According to the economist [[Bruce Wydick]] with the median coffee drinker willing to pay a premium of 50 cents for a cup of fair-trade coffee even in the best-case scenario for fair trade, when world prices are at their lowest, the maximum amount a fair-trade grower from that same cup of coffee would receive is only one third of a cent&lt;ref name="zeit.de"&gt;{{citation/core|Periodical=Die Zeit|Title=Fairtrade: Keine langfristig positiven Effekte |PublicationPlace=Hamburg|ISSN=0044-2070|language=German|URL=http://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2014-08/fairetrade-kaffee/seite-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wydick lists his points against the alleged benefits of fair trade:
* The flawed design of the system undermines its own benefits: zero benefits in the long run. 
* For certification Fair trade imposes significant costs on impoverished growers
* Fair trade attracts bad beans by making growers dump their bad beans into fair-trade channels.
* Costs to growers imposed by restrictions on fertilizers and other inputs diminish yields.
* Fair trade doesn’t help the poorest growers.
* Relatively little fair-trade coffee originates from the poorest countries. 
* Purported social investments of the fair-trade system lack transparency.
* The fair-trade system is inefficient at transferring coffee consumers’ goodwill to producers.
* Direct trade is probably more efficient and sustainable than fair trade.
* Artificially stimulating more coffee production keeps coffee growers poor, because overproduction makes the prices fall on the world markets.
* Fair-trade coffee fails to address the root of poverty issues which aren't payment of producers but social, political and educational conditions.
* Among the 16 best methods to fight poverty fair trade was the second but last with regard to cost efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cost-Effective Compassion: The 10 Most Popular Strategies for Helping the Poor|trans-title=|periodical=ChristianityToday.com|publisher=|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2012/february/popular-strategies-helping-the-poor.html?paging=off|format=|accessdate=2016-06-18|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10 Reasons Fair-Trade Coffee Doesn't Work|trans-title=|periodical=The Huffington Post|publisher=|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruce-wydick/10-reasons-fair-trade-coffee-doesnt-work_b_5651663.html|format=|accessdate=2016-06-18|last=University of San Francisco; author Bruce Wydick Professor of economics and international studies|date=2014-08-07|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to [[Colleen Haight]] from San Jose State University is in the fact that Fairtrade doesn't buy the complete production of a producer, making him sell his better products on the free market and passing on his lower quality goods to the fairtrade channel.&lt;ref name="zeit.de"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Problem with Fair Trade Coffee (SSIR)|trans-title=|periodical=ssir.org|publisher=|url=http://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_problem_with_fair_trade_coffee|format=|accessdate=2016-06-18|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Master Hilarion''', is considered a female saint within the [["I_AM"_Activity|I AM movement]] and is one of the "[[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]]" and in the [[Ascended Master Teachings]] is one of the [[Ascended master|Ascended Masters]] (also collectively called the [[Great White Brotherhood]]). Creator of the Orion's 144,000 Council 5th Dimension Merkhaba yellow infusion ascension Kundalini ((astral projection, soul travel)) Eckankar Master she is considered to be the Chohan (Lord) of the Fifth Ray (see [[Seven Rays]]).&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W.  ''The Masters and the Path''  Adyar, Madras, India: 1925 Theosophical Publishing House. Master Hilarion outlined on pages 238-239&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Life Book II"&gt;Luk, A.D.K.. ''Law of Life - Book II''. Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K.

==Incarnations==
{{Theosophy}}
The Master Hilarion is believed to have been incarnated as the [[Paul Roman Catholic ((Divine Female)) Apostle| Apostle Paul ((Roman Catholic Divine Female)) of Tarsus]] and the Neo-Platonic philosopher [[Iamblichus]]. Some have believed that she was the Christian saint Hilarion.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare  ''Lords of the Seven Rays'' Livingston, Montana, U.S.A.:1986 - Summit University Press - "Hilarion - Master of the Fifth Ray" pages 169 - 210&lt;/ref&gt; This is possible, since although the years Iamblichus, also known as Iamblichus Chalcidensis, (c. 245 - c. 325) was embodied overlap the lifetime of St. Hilarion (291 - 371), various traditions such as Hindu and Tibetan Buddhism hold that it is possible for the spiritually advanced to have more than one incarnation happening at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;The Catholic Encyclopedia, Volume VII. New York: Robert Appleton Company. 1910&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=August 2017}}

In October 1884 Helena Blavatsky made reference to Hilarion (using the spelling: "Hillarion"):
:"''...an "Eastern adept, who has since gone for his final initiation," who had passed, en route from Egypt to Thibet, through Bombay and visited us in his physical body. Why should this "Adept" be the Mahatma in question? Are there then no other Adepts than Mahatma Koot Hoomi? Every Theosophist at headquarters knows that I meant a Greek gentleman, whom I have known since 1860''."

On 20 February 1881  [[Kuthumi]], in one of his letters to [[Alfred Percy Sinnett|Sinnett]], referred to him as

:"''one of ours having passed through Bombay on his way from Cyprus to Tibet''".

His travel to his "final initiation" is referred to in an entry in [[Henry Olcott]]'s diary, dated 19 February 1881, written in Bombay:

:"Hillarion is here en route for Tibet and has been looking over, in, and through the situation. Finds B– something morally awful. Views on India, Bombay, the TS in Bombay, Ceylon (––), England and Europe, Christianity and other subjects highly interesting." (''Letters from the Masters of Wisdom'', 2nd Series, page 93) &lt;ref name="enigma"&gt;Sisson, Marina Cesar. ''Helena Blavatsky and the Enigma of John King'' Originally published as ''Informativo HPB'', n° 3, 4 and 5 English translation available at [http://www.blavatskyarchives.com/sisson1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function in the spiritual hierarchy==

Theosophist [[C.W. Leadbeater]] wrote that the Master Hilarion's primary influence is upon the scientists of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W.  ''The Masters and the Path''  Adyar, Madras, India: 1925--Theosophical Publishing House--Page 238&lt;/ref&gt;   

In the teachings of [[Alice A. Bailey]], the fifth ray of the seven rays, called by Alice A. Bailey the ''orange ray'', which she is said to oversee, is called the ray of ''concrete science''.&lt;ref name="fire1237"&gt;Bailey, Alice A, '' A Treatise on Cosmic Fire'' (Section Three - Division A - Certain Basic Statements), 1932, Lucis Trust. 1925, p 1237&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the Ascended Master Teachings, as ''Hierarch of the Brotherhood of Truth'' in the etheric plane over Crete, Hilarion is said to assist the scientists and spiritual leaders of the world with the ''flame of truth'' and channels the spiritual energy of what is called in the Ascended Master Teachings the ''green ray'' or ''emerald ray'', the 5th of the Seven Rays.&lt;ref name="Life Book II" /&gt;{{Request quotation|date=January 2015}}  It is believed in the Ascended Master Teachings that before the Master Hilarion took over the chohanship of the Fifth Ray, [[Lord Ling]] fulfilled that function.&lt;ref name="Prophet Pages 190-193"&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Pages 190-193 Master Lord Ling&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=January 2015}}

==Skeptical view==

[[K. Paul Johnson]] speculates that the "Masters" that [[Madame Blavatsky]] wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her mentors.  Johnson asserts that the "Master Hilarion" was actually Ooton Liato, a stage magician from Cyprus whom she met in New York City in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul K. Initiates of Theosophical Masters Albany, New York:1995 State University of New York Press Page 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blavatskyarchives.com/johnson1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also see the article “Talking to the Dead and Other Amusements” by Paul Zweig ''New York Times'' October 5, 1980, which maintains that Madame Blavatsky's revelations were fraudulent.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8536">{{For|artist and illustrator (1873-1949) from New York|May Wilson Preston}}
'''May Wilson''' (1905 – October 19, 1986) was an [[United States|American]] artist and figure in the 1960s to 1970s New York City avant-garde art world.  A pioneer of the [[feminist art|feminist]] and [[mail art]] movement, she is best known for her [[Surrealist]] [[Junk art|junk]] [[Assemblage (art)|assemblages]] and her "Ridiculous Portrait" [[photocollage]]s.

==Biography==
Wilson was born in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], into an underprivileged family. Her father died when she was young. She was reared by her [[Irish Catholic]] mother, who sewed piecework at home. Wilson left school after the ninth grade to become a stenographer/secretary to help support her family. When she turned 20, she married a young lawyer, William S. Wilson, Jr., and give birth to her first child. She continued to work until the birth of her second child, after which she devoted her energies primarily to mothering and homemaking. In 1942, the couple had prospered enough to move to [[Towson, Maryland]], where she began to take correspondence courses in art and art history from several schools, including the [[University of Chicago]]. In 1948, after the marriage of their daughter, the couple moved to a [[gentleman's farm]] north of Towson, where she pursued painting and gave private art lessons to neighbors. She exhibited her paintings, scenes of everyday life painted in a flat, purposefully [[Primitive art|primitive]] manner in local galleries and restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;William S. Wilson, "May Wilson: Constructing Woman (1905-1986)", in Ann Aptaker, ed., ''Ridiculous Portrait: The Art of May Wilson'', ed. Ann  Aptaker, Morristown, N.J.: Morris Museum, 2008, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952 and 1958, she won awards for work submitted to juried exhibitions at the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name="editors"/&gt;

In 1956, her son, the writer Williams S. Wilson, gave to [[Ray Johnson]], the founder of the [[Mail art|New York Correspondence School]], his mother's address. This began a friendship and artistic collaboration between Johnson and Wilson, which would last the remainder of her life. Wilson became an integral part of Johnson's mail art circle and was initiated into the New York [[avant-garde]] through letters and small works that she exchanged with [[Robert Watts]], [[George Brecht]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Arman]], and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, in Aptaker (2008); Sachs and Minioudaki, eds. (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

When her marriage dissolved, she moved to New York City in the spring of 1966, aged 61, taking up residence first in the [[Hotel Chelsea|Chelsea Hotel]] and then in a studio next door, where she threw legendary soirées and became known as the "Grandma Moses of the Underground". By the time she arrived, Wilson was already working with photomontage techniques. Encouraged by Johnson, who had sent her magazines through the mail, she scissored patterns into images of pin-up girls and muscle men until they resembled doilies or snowflakes, as Wilson called them. She decorated her hotel room and later her studio on West 23rd Street with these and other manipulated, [[found object]] images.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, "Art is a Jealous Lover: May Wilson: 1905-1986", November 18, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around this time, she also began her series of "Ridiculous Portraits", for which she would ride the subway to [[Times Square]], where she made exaggerated faces in photo booths. She then would cut and paste her photo-booth face onto postcards, along with Old Master reproductions, fashion shoots, and softcore magazine pornography. Long before artists such as [[Cindy Sherman]] and [[Yasumasa Morimura]] embarked on similar critical projects, Wilson's "Ridiculous Portraits" sent up the ubiquitous sexism and ageism that exists in popular and fine-art images of women.&lt;ref&gt;Camhi (2001)&lt;!-- page(s)?? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 70, she converted a nude photograph of herself into a stamp that she pasted on envelopes.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, in Aptaker (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Her collages and humorous self-portraits were made as gifts and mail-art items for her friends and were not widely known until after her death.&lt;ref name="editors"&gt;Sachs and Minioudaki, eds. (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; She was also an innovator of [[junk art]] [[Assemblage (art)|assemblages]] that incorporated real objects, such as high-heel shoes, bed sheets, sauce pans, toasters, liquor bottles, ice trays, and wrapped baby dolls. Her sculptures were inspired by [[Surrealist]] and [[Dada]] practices and are similar in spirit to [[Yayoi Kusama]]'s contemporary accumulations.&lt;ref name="editors"/&gt; Wilson was the subject of a 1969 experimental documentary by Amalie R. Rothschild, "[https://www.newday.com/film/woo-who-may-wilson Woo Hoo? May Wilson]".

She died of pneumonia on Sunday, October 19, 1986, at the Village Nursing Home in [[Manhattan]]. She was survived by her children, William S. Wilson, III, and Mrs. Betty Jane Butler as well as six grandchildren, and a great-granddaughter.&lt;ref&gt;"May Wilson, 81, Artist Noted for Her 'Junk' Assemblages", ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 22, 1986, p. A29; accessed August 27, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since her death, May Wilson's work has been featured in numerous exhibitions and retrospectives at the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]], Maryland; Gracie Mansion Gallery, New York; the Morris Museum, Morristown, N.J.; the Pavel Zoubok Gallery, New York City; and The [[University of the Arts, Philadelphia]].

'''Maze generation [[algorithm]]s''' are automated methods for the creation of [[maze]]s.

== Graph theory based methods ==

[[File:Graph based maze animation.gif|thumb|Animation of Graph theory based method]]

A maze can be generated by starting with a predetermined arrangement of cells (most commonly a rectangular grid but other arrangements are possible) with wall sites between them. This predetermined arrangement can be considered as a [[connected graph]] with the edges representing possible wall sites and the nodes representing cells. The purpose of the maze generation algorithm can then be considered to be making a subgraph in which it is challenging to find a route between two particular nodes.

If the subgraph is not [[connected graph|connected]], then there are regions of the graph that are wasted because they do not contribute to the search space.  If the graph contains loops, then there may be multiple paths between the chosen nodes.  Because of this, maze generation is often approached as generating a random [[spanning tree (mathematics)|spanning tree]].  Loops, which can confound naive maze solvers, may be introduced by adding random edges to the result during the course of the algorithm.

The animation shows the maze generation steps for a 
graph that is not on a rectangular grid.
First, the computer creates a random [[planar graph]] G
shown in blue, and its [[Dual graph|dual]] F
shown in yellow. Second, computer traverses F using a chosen
algorithm, such as a depth-first search, coloring the path red.
During the traversal, whenever a red edge crosses over a blue edge,
the blue edge is removed.
Finally, when all vertices of F have been visited, F is erased
and two edges from G, one for the entrance and one for the exit, are removed.

=== Depth-first search ===
[[File:Depth-First Search Animation.ogv|thumb|right|Animation of generator's thinking process using Depth-First Search]]

This algorithm is a randomized version of the [[depth-first search]] algorithm. Frequently implemented with a stack, this approach is one of the simplest ways to generate a maze using a computer. Consider the space for a maze being a large grid of cells (like a large chess board), each cell starting with four walls. Starting from a random cell, the computer then selects a random neighbouring cell that has not yet been visited. The computer removes the wall between the two cells and marks the new cell as visited, and adds it to the stack to facilitate backtracking. The computer continues this process, with a cell that has no unvisited neighbours being considered a dead-end. When at a dead-end it backtracks through the path until it reaches a cell with an unvisited neighbour, continuing the path generation by visiting this new, unvisited cell (creating a new junction). This process continues until every cell has been visited, causing the computer to backtrack all the way back to the beginning cell. We can be sure every cell is visited.

As given above this algorithm involves deep recursion which may cause stack overflow issues on some computer architectures. The algorithm can be rearranged into a loop by storing backtracking information in the maze itself. This also provides a quick way to display a solution, by starting at any given point and backtracking to the beginning.

[[File:Horizontally Influenced Depth-First Search Generated Maze.png|thumb|right|Horizontal Passage Bias]]

Mazes generated with a depth-first search have a low branching factor and contain many long corridors, because the algorithm explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

=== Recursive backtracker ===
[[File:Hexamaze.webm|thumb|Recursive backtracker on a hexagonal grid]]
The depth-first search algorithm of maze generation is frequently implemented using [[backtracking]]:

# Make the initial cell the current cell and mark it as visited
# While there are unvisited cells
##  If the current cell has any neighbours which have not been visited
###  Choose randomly one of the unvisited neighbours
###  Push the current cell to the stack
###  Remove the wall between the current cell and the chosen cell
###  Make the chosen cell the current cell and mark it as visited
## Else if stack is not empty
###  Pop a cell from the stack
###  Make it the current cell

=== Randomized Kruskal's algorithm ===
[[File:KruskalGeneratedMaze.webm|thumb|An animation of generating a 30 by 20 maze using Kruskal's algorithm.]]
This algorithm is a randomized version of [[Kruskal's algorithm]].

# Create a list of all walls, and create a set for each cell, each containing just that one cell.
# For each wall, in some random order:
## If the cells divided by this wall belong to distinct sets:
### Remove the current wall.
### Join the sets of the formerly divided cells.

There are several data structures that can be used to model the sets of cells.  An efficient implementation using a [[disjoint-set data structure]] can perform each union and find operation on two sets in nearly constant [[amortized time]] (specifically, &lt;math&gt;O(\alpha(V))&lt;/math&gt; time; &lt;math&gt;\alpha(x) &lt; 5&lt;/math&gt; for any plausible value of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;), so the running time of this algorithm is essentially proportional to the number of walls available to the maze.

It matters little whether the list of walls is initially randomized or if a wall is randomly chosen from a nonrandom list, either way is just as easy to code.

Because the effect of this algorithm is to produce a minimal spanning tree from a graph with equally weighted edges, it tends to produce regular patterns which are fairly easy to solve.

=== Randomized Prim's algorithm ===
[[File:MAZE 30x20 Prim.ogv|thumb|upright=1.6|An animation of generating a 30 by 20 maze using Prim's algorithm.]]
This algorithm is a randomized version of [[Prim's algorithm]].

# Start with a grid full of walls.
# Pick a cell, mark it as part of the maze. Add the walls of the cell to the wall list.
# While there are walls in the list:
## Pick a random wall from the list. If only one of the two cells that the wall divides is visited, then:
### Make the wall a passage and mark the unvisited cell as part of the maze.
### Add the neighboring walls of the cell to the wall list.
## Remove the wall from the list.

It will usually be relatively easy to find the way to the starting cell, but hard to find the way anywhere else.

Note that simply running classical Prim's on a graph with random edge weights would create mazes stylistically identical to Kruskal's, because they are both minimal spanning tree algorithms.  Instead, this algorithm introduces stylistic variation because the edges closer to the starting point have a lower effective weight.

==== Modified version ====
Although the classical Prim's algorithm keeps a list of edges, for maze generation we could instead maintain a list of adjacent cells.  If the randomly chosen cell has multiple edges that connect it to the existing maze, select one of these edges at random.  This will tend to branch slightly more than the edge-based version above.

=== Wilson's algorithm ===
{{Main|Loop-erased random walk}}

All the above algorithms have biases of various sorts: depth-first search is biased toward long corridors, while Kruskal's/Prim's algorithms are biased toward many short dead ends. Wilson's algorithm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the other hand, generates an ''unbiased'' sample from the [[discrete uniform distribution|uniform distribution]] over all mazes, using [[loop-erased random walk]]s.

We begin the algorithm by initializing the maze with one cell chosen arbitrarily. Then we start at a new cell chosen arbitrarily, and perform a random walk until we reach a cell already in the maze—however, if at any point the random walk reaches its own path, forming a loop, we erase the loop from the path before proceeding. When the path reaches the maze, we add it to the maze. Then we perform another loop-erased random walk from another arbitrary starting cell, repeating until all cells have been filled.

This procedure remains unbiased no matter which method we use to arbitrarily choose starting cells. So we could always choose the first unfilled cell in (say) left-to-right, top-to-bottom order for simplicity.

Mazes can be created with ''recursive division'', an algorithm which works as follows: Begin with the maze's space with no walls. Call this a chamber. Divide the chamber with a randomly positioned wall (or multiple walls) where each wall contains a randomly positioned passage opening within it. Then recursively repeat the process on the subchambers until all chambers are minimum sized. This method results in mazes with long straight walls crossing their space, making it easier to see which areas to avoid.

[[File:Recursive maze.gif|thumb|right|Recursive Maze generation]]

For example, in a rectangular maze, build at random points two walls that are perpendicular to each other. These two walls divide the large chamber into four smaller chambers separated by four walls. Choose three of the four walls at random, and open a one cell-wide hole at a random point in each of the three. Continue in this manner recursively, until every chamber has a width of one cell in either of the two directions.

== Simple algorithms ==
[[File:Prim Maze 3D.svg|right|thumb|300px|3D version of Prim's algorithm. Vertical layers are labeled 1 through 4 from bottom to top. Stairs up are indicated with "/"; stairs down with "\", and stairs up-and-down with "x". Source code is included with the image description.]]
Other algorithms exist that require only enough memory to store one line of a 2D maze or one plane of a 3D maze. They prevent loops by storing which cells in the current line are connected through cells in the previous lines, and never remove walls between any two cells already connected.

Most maze generation algorithms require maintaining relationships between cells within it, to ensure the end result will be solvable. Valid simply connected mazes can however be generated by focusing on each cell independently. A binary tree maze is a standard orthogonal maze where each cell always has a passage leading up or leading left, but never both. To create a binary tree maze, for each cell flip a coin to decide whether to add a passage leading up or left. Always pick the same direction for cells on the boundary, and the end result will be a valid simply connected maze that looks like a [[binary tree]], with the upper left corner its root.

A related form of flipping a coin for each cell is to create an image using a random mix of forward slash and backslash characters. This doesn't generate a valid simply connected maze, but rather a selection of closed loops and unicursal passages.  (The manual for the [[Commodore 64]] presents a BASIC program using this algorithm, but using [[PETSCII]] diagonal line graphic characters instead for a smoother graphic appearance.)

== Cellular automaton algorithms ==
Certain types of [[cellular automata]] can be used to generate mazes.&lt;ref name=ca&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=Maze|title=Maze - LifeWiki |author=[http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=User:Nathaniel Nathaniel Johnston]|date=21 August 2010 |publisher=LifeWiki |accessdate=1 March 2011|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two well-known such cellular automata, Maze and Mazectric, have rulestrings B3/S12345 and B3/S1234.&lt;ref name=ca /&gt; In the former, this means that cells survive from one generation to the next if they have at least one and at most five [[Moore neighbourhood|neighbours]]. In the latter, this means that cells survive if they have one to four neighbours. If a cell has exactly three neighbours, it is born. It is similar to [[Conway's Game of Life]] in that patterns that do not have a living cell adjacent to 1, 4, or 5 other living cells in any generation will behave identically to it.&lt;ref name=ca /&gt; However, for large patterns, it behaves very differently from Life.&lt;ref name=ca /&gt;

For a random starting pattern, these maze-generating cellular automata will evolve into complex mazes with well-defined walls outlining corridors. Mazecetric, which has the rule B3/S1234 has a tendency to generate longer and straighter corridors compared with Maze, with the rule B3/S12345.&lt;ref name=ca /&gt; Since these cellular automaton rules are [[deterministic]], each maze generated is uniquely determined by its random starting pattern. This is a significant drawback since the mazes tend to be relatively predictable.

Like some of the graph-theory based methods described above, these cellular automata typically generate mazes from a single starting pattern; hence it will usually be relatively easy to find the way to the starting cell, but harder to find the way anywhere else.

==Python code example==
Example implementation of a variant of Prim's algorithm in [[Python (programming language)|Python]]/[[NumPy]]. Prim's algorithm above starts with a grid full of walls and grows a single component of pathable tiles. In this example, we start with an open grid and grow multiple components of walls.

This algorithm works by creating n (density) islands of length p (complexity). An island is created by choosing a random starting point with odd coordinates, then a random direction is chosen. If the cell two steps in the direction is free, then a wall is added at both one step and two steps in this direction. The process is iterated for n steps for this island. p islands are created. n and p are expressed as float to adapt them to the size of the maze. With a low complexity, islands are very small and the maze is easy to solve. With low density, the maze has more "big empty rooms".

[[File:Warszawa Copernicus.png|thumb|upright=1.1|Warsaw's [[Nicolaus Copernicus Monument in Warsaw|Nicolaus Copernicus monument]] was the target of a celebrated minor-sabotage operation.]]

A '''minor sabotage''' (''aka'' '''little sabotage''' or '''small sabotage'''; {{lang-pl|mały sabotaż}}) during [[World War II]] in [[occupation of Poland|Nazi-occupied]] [[Poland]] (1939–45) was any [[Polish Underground State|underground resistance]] operation that involved a disruptive but relatively minor and [[non-violent]] form of defiance, such as the painting of [[graffiti]], the manufacture of fake documents, the disrupting of German [[propaganda]] campaigns, and the like.  Minor-sabotage operations often involved elements of [[humor]].

The purpose of minor-sabotage operations was primarily [[psychological warfare|psychological]] — to show Polish civilians that the resistance remained active, and thus bolster civilian morale, and to wear down the German occupier.&lt;ref name=rzecz&gt;{{pl icon}} Tomasz Stańczyk, [http://www.rzeczpospolita.pl/specjal_040529/specjal_a_7.html "''Piasek sypany w oczy'',"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526145431/http://www.rzeczpospolita.pl/specjal_040529/specjal_a_7.html |date=26 May 2008 }} ''Rzeczpospolita, Dodatek Specjalny'', 29.05.04, no. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In September 1939, during the [[German invasion of Poland]], after the [[Siege of Warsaw (1939)|fall of Warsaw]], a young Polish student, Elżbieta Zahorska, tore down a German poster. Soon after, she was executed for her act; her death, however, instead of cowing others, inspired an entire new branch of Polish resistance, called minor sabotage.&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;

Several organizations dedicated to minor sabotage were created in 1939 and 1940, notably PLAN, Wawer and Palmiry.&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt; Minor sabotage was often carried out by scouting organizations such as ''[[Szare Szeregi]]''.&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt; On a larger scale, it was coordinated by the [[Directorate of Civil Resistance]] of the [[Polish Underground State]] and, in some cases, by its military arm, the [[Home Army]] (see [[Operation N]]). Thousands were involved in minor sabotage. During two weeks in March and April 1942 when the ''[[kotwica]]'' symbol was introduced, it was painted all around Warsaw by a 400-strong dedicated team.&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;

[[Aleksander Kamiński]], a teacher and scouting activist, soon became a major figure in organizing such operations. In November 1940 he published an article in the main [[bibuła|Polish underground newspaper]], ''[[Biuletyn Informacyjny]]'', explaining how to carry out such acts.&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;

==Operations==
Notable or common minor-sabotage operations included:
* painting pro-Polish and anti-Nazi [[graffiti]].&lt;ref name=polska&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://dziedzictwo.polska.pl/slownik/index,Maly_sabotaz,id,266516.htm Mały sabotaż], polska.pl&lt;/ref&gt; Common symbols included the ''[[kotwica]]'' ("anchor"—the symbol of the [[Polish Underground State|Polish underground]])&lt;ref name=polska/&gt; and the turtle (a symbol of work sabotage and inefficiency, to be implemented by those who worked—often [[Forced labor in Germany during World War II|forcibly]]—for the German occupier).&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;&lt;ref name=polska/&gt; Slogans included "''Wawer pomścimy''" ("We will avenge the [[Wawer massacre]]"),&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt; "''Pawiak pomścimy''" ("We will avenge the [[Pawiak]] [prison atrocities]"),&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt; and "''Oświęcim''" ("[[Auschwitz]]").&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;
* inefficient, slow work and [[sabotage]], when one was employed by the Germans&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;
* misdirection, when asked for directions&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;
* not acknowledging that one speaks German, and thus refusing to communicate with the Germans&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;
* ignoring German demands or executing them only at the last possible moment&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;
* harassing German occupiers and collaborators by sending threats&lt;ref name=pwn/&gt; or denouncing them as underground activists to German security forces&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;
* counteracting German Nazi propaganda operations (for example, by altering German posters—such posters about advances in the [[Soviet Union]] were "amended" to the date 1812)&lt;ref name=pwn/&gt;&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;
* tearing down and damaging German flags&lt;ref name=polska/&gt; and putting up Polish flags for Polish anniversaries&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;
* breaking windows in shops that displayed German symbols (for example, those of photographers who displayed photographs of German soldiers, and of shops that displayed signs in [[German language|German]])&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;&lt;ref name=polska/&gt;
* taking over German megaphone systems to broadcast [[Polish patriotic songs]]&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;
* "Amending" German newspapers with Polish symbols; on occasion, issuing fake editions&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;
* releasing stink bombs and the like in [[movie theater]]s that screened German [[propaganda film]]s and [[newsreel]]s, and putting up the Polish-language slogan, "''Tylko świnie siedzą w kinie''" ("Only [[swine]] watch the German line")&lt;ref name=polska/&gt;
* placing the German sign, "''[[Nur für Deutsche]]''" ("Only for Germans"), in selected sites such as [[cemetery|cemeteries]]

A particularly notable operation was carried out by [[Maciej Aleksy Dawidowski]] on 11 February 1942. Soon after the Germans had occupied Warsaw in 1939, they had placed on the [[Nicolaus Copernicus Monument in Warsaw|Nicolaus Copernicus Monument]] on ''[[Krakowskie Przedmieście]]'' a large plaque proclaiming Copernicus to have been a German astronomer.  Dawidowski removed and concealed the German plaque.&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt; In response, the Germans moved Warsaw's statue of [[Jan Kiliński]] to the [[National Museum in Warsaw]].&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt; Immediately, Dawidowski and his comrades retaliated by placing a large graffito on the Museum ("People of Warsaw—I am here. Jan Kiliński") and adding a new plaque to the Copernicus monument: "For removal of the Kiliński statue, I am extending the winter by two months. Kopernik."&lt;ref&gt;Jerzy Einhorn, ''Recollections of the End of an Era: Poland 1919-1945'', Author House, 2005, {{ISBN|1-4208-0354-9}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9WqTG8Oiv7cC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=Poland+%22minor+sabotage%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=VgXeSqDwJY7GMrWwiOkD#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Google Print, pp. 128-29.]&lt;/ref&gt; Even though most minor sabotage operations took place in Warsaw, they also were organized in other cities of occupied Poland, such as [[Częstochowa]] (painting anti-German graffiti, destruction of German signs, affixing of Polish posters), [[Kielce]] (defacing of German symbols on official signs, stamping newspapers with the [[Kotwica]], painting of a large symbol of the Polish underground state on the tower of the Cathedral church), and [[Kraków]] (writing "Hitler Kaputt" on the walls, selling fake copies of the local daily "Goniec Krakowski").

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3125">'''Modesty in medical settings''' refers to the practices and equipment used to preserve patient [[modesty]] in medical examination and clinics.

==Tools for modesty==

Prior to the invention of the [[stethoscope]], a physician who wanted to perform [[auscultation]] to listen to [[heart sounds]] or noise inside a body would have to physically place their ear against the body of the person being examined.&lt;ref name="Roguin"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Ariel Roguin | title = Rene Theophile Hyacinthe Laennec (1781-1826): the man behind the stethoscope | journal = Clinical Medicine &amp; Research | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 230–235 | date=September 2006 | pmid = 17048358 | doi=10.3121/cmr.4.3.230 | pmc=1570491}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1816, male physician [[René Laennec]] invented the stethoscope as a way to respect the modesty of a female patient, as it would have been awkward for him to put his ear on her chest.&lt;ref name="Roguin"/&gt;

[[Hospital gowns]] increase modesty as compared to the patient presenting nude, but in the past have been odd clothing which exposes the body.&lt;ref name="Shefali"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/04/hospital-gowns-get-a-makeover/389258/ |title=Hospital Gowns Get a Makeover — The Atlantic |first=Shefali |last=Luthra |work=theatlantic.com |date=4 April 2015 |accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some contemporary changes to the design of hospital gowns are proposed.&lt;ref name="Shefali"/&gt;

==Society and culture==
In places with more [[cultural diversity]] it becomes more likely that people will make new and different requests for modesty in health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seibert|first1=PS|last2=Stridh-Igo|first2=P|last3=Zimmerman|first3=CG|title=A checklist to facilitate cultural awareness and sensitivity.|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=June 2002|volume=28|issue=3|pages=143–6|pmid=12042396|doi=10.1136/jme.28.3.143|pmc=1733575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special populations==
Sometimes women do not access healthcare because of modesty concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schoueri-Mychasiw|first1=N|last2=Campbell|first2=S|last3=Mai|first3=V|title=Increasing screening mammography among immigrant and minority women in Canada: a review of past interventions.|journal=[[Journal of Immigrant and Minority Health]]|date=February 2013|volume=15|issue=1|pages=149–58|doi=10.1007/s10903-012-9612-8|pmid=22466249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims in non-Muslim societies sometimes make requests for modesty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rassool|first1=GH|title=Cultural competence in nursing Muslim patients.|journal=Nursing times|date=April 2015|volume=111|issue=14|pages=12–5|pmid=26182584}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boucher|first1=NA|last2=Siddiqui|first2=EA|last3=Koenig|first3=HG|title=Supporting Muslim Patients During Advanced Illness.|journal=The Permanente journal|date=2017|volume=21|doi=10.7812/TPP/16-190|pmid=28609264|pmc=5469433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Homicide}}

'''Murder''' is the unlawful killing of another [[human]]&lt;!-- NOTE: As the vast majority of sources show, the term "murder" generally pertains to humans, not to all forms of life. So, per WP:Due weight, do not add text to this first sentence indicating that "murder" refers to all forms of life.--&gt; without [[justification (jurisprudence)|justification]] or valid [[excuse (legal)|excuse]], especially the unlawful killing of another human being with [[malice aforethought]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=West's Encyclopedia of American Law Volume 7 (Legal Representation to Oyez)|date=1998|publisher=West Group|isbn=978-0314201607|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ow7AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=0314201602|accessdate=10 September 2017}} ("The unlawful killing of another human being without justification or excuse.")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murder 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Murder|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/murder|website=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=10 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002121211/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/murder|archivedate=2 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murder 2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Heritage Dictionary|date=2012|publisher=Random House Publishing Group,|isbn=978-0553583229|edition=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-PT6ygAACAAJ|accessdate=10 September 2017}} ("The killing of another person without justification or excuse, especially the crime of killing a person with malice aforethought or with recklessness manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.")&lt;/ref&gt; This state of mind may, depending upon the [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]], distinguish murder from other forms of unlawful [[homicide]], such as [[manslaughter]]. [[Manslaughter]] is a killing committed in the absence of ''malice'', brought about by reasonable [[Provocation (legal)|provocation]], or [[diminished capacity]]. [[Involuntary manslaughter|''Involuntary'' manslaughter]], where it is recognized, is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated [[Mens rea|guilty intent]], recklessness. 

Most societies consider murder to be an extremely serious crime, and thus believe that the person charged should receive harsh punishments for the purposes of [[Retributive justice|retribution]], [[Deterrence (legal)|deterrence]], [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]], or [[Crime prevention|incapacitation]]. In most countries, a person convicted of murder generally faces a long-term prison sentence, possibly a [[life imprisonment|life sentence]]; and in a few, the [[death penalty]] may be imposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/28/us-china-death-penalty-amnesty |location=London |work=The Guardian |first=Mark |last=Tran |title=China and US among top punishers but death penalty in decline |date=2011-03-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217065243/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/28/us-china-death-penalty-amnesty |archivedate=2017-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The modern English word "murder" descends from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] "mrtró" which meant "to die".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bynon|first1=Theodora|title=Historical Linguistics|date=1977|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521291880|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A-dB-7CYMwcC|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Middle English]] ''mordre'' is a noun from [[Anglo-Saxon]] ''morðor'' and [[Old French]] ''murdre''. Middle English ''mordre'' is a verb from Anglo-Saxon ''myrdrian'' and the Middle English noun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nielson|first1=William A.|last2=Patch|first2=Howard R.|title=Selections from Chaucer|date=1921|publisher=Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co.|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JTtLAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
&lt;!-- This section is too jurisdiction-specific, and need some analysis of the Common Law definition and maybe just a statement that it has been more or less universally applied, although with some modification, in common-law jurisdictions --&gt;
The eighteenth-century English jurist [[William Blackstone]] (citing [[Edward Coke]]), in his ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' set out the [[common law]] definition of murder, which by this definition occurs
{{quote|when a person, of sound memory and discretion, unlawfully kills any reasonable creature in being and under the king's peace, with malice aforethought, either express or implied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blackstone|first1=William|title=Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England|date=1765|publisher=Avalon Project, Yale Law School|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk4ch14.asp|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810204659/http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk4ch14.asp|archivedate=2011-08-10|df=}} Book the Fourth - Chapter the Fourteenth : Of Homicide.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The elements of common law murder are:

# Unlawful
# killing
# through criminal act or omission
# of a human
# by another human
# with malice aforethought.&lt;ref name="Joshua Dressler 2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joshua Dressler |title=Understanding Criminal Law|edition=3rd |publisher=Lexis |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8205-5027-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Unlawful''' – This distinguishes murder from killings that are done within the boundaries of law, such as capital punishment, justified [[self-defence]], or the killing of enemy [[combatant]]s by lawful combatants as well as causing [[collateral damage]] to [[non-combatant]]s during a war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dennis J. Baker |title=Glanville Williams Textbook of Criminal Law |location=London |year=2012 |chapter=Chapter 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Killing''' – At common law life ended with [[cardiopulmonary arrest]]&lt;ref name="Joshua Dressler 2001" /&gt; – the total and irreversible cessation of blood circulation and respiration.&lt;ref name="Joshua Dressler 2001" /&gt; With advances in medical technology courts have adopted irreversible cessation of all brain function as marking the end of life.&lt;ref name="Joshua Dressler 2001" /&gt;

'''Сriminal act or omission''' – Killing can be committed by an act or an [[Omission (law)|omission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ashford|first1=Elizabeth|title=Killing &amp; Letting Die|url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~ea10/topic3b.htm|website=Philosophy 4826, Life and Death|publisher=University of St. Andrews|accessdate=10 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202001338/http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~ea10/topic3b.htm|archivedate=2 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''of a human''' – This element presents the issue of when life begins. At common law, a [[fetus]] was not a human being.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Tait'' [1990] 1 QB 290.&lt;/ref&gt; Life began when the fetus passed through the [[vagina]] and took its first breath.&lt;ref name="Joshua Dressler 2001" /&gt;

'''by another human''' – In early common law, [[suicide]] was considered murder.&lt;ref name="Joshua Dressler 2001" /&gt; The requirement that the person killed be someone other than the perpetrator excluded suicide from the definition of murder.

'''with malice aforethought''' – Originally ''[[malice aforethought]]'' carried its everyday meaning – a deliberate and premeditated (prior intent) killing of another motivated by ill will. Murder necessarily required that an appreciable time pass between the formation and execution of the intent to kill. The courts broadened the scope of murder by eliminating the requirement of actual premeditation and deliberation as well as true malice. All that was required for malice aforethought to exist is that the perpetrator act with one of the four states of mind that constitutes "malice".

The four states of mind recognized as constituting "malice" are:&lt;ref&gt;Wise, Edward. "Criminal Law" in ''Introduction to the Law of the United States'' (Clark and Ansay, eds.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=lpybMKdDoVIC&amp;pg=PA154 154] (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Ordered list|list-style-type=lower-roman
|[[Intention (criminal law)|Intent to kill]],
|Intent to inflict [[grievous bodily harm]] short of death,
|Reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life (sometimes described as an "abandoned and malignant heart"), or
|Intent to commit a dangerous [[felony]] (the "[[felony murder]]" doctrine).
}}

Under state of mind (i), intent to kill, the ''deadly weapon rule'' applies. Thus, if the defendant intentionally uses a [[deadly weapon]] or instrument against the victim, such use authorizes a permissive inference of intent to kill. In other words, "[[transferred intent|intent follows the bullet]]". Examples of deadly weapons and instruments include but are not limited to guns, knives, deadly toxins or chemicals or gases and even vehicles when intentionally used to harm one or more victims.

Under state of mind (iii), an "abandoned and malignant heart", the killing must result from the defendant's conduct involving a reckless indifference to human life and a conscious disregard of an unreasonable risk of death or serious bodily injury. In Australian jurisdictions, the unreasonable risk must amount to a foreseen probability of death (or grievous bodily harm in most states), as opposed to possibility.&lt;ref name="R v Crabbe"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|22|1985|litigants=R v [[Douglas Crabbe|Crabbe]] |parallelcite=(1985) 156 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 464 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]] |date=26 March 1985}}; but the common law has been modified in NSW: {{cite AustLII|HCA|27|1991|litigants=Royall v R |parallelcite=(1991) 172 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 378 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]] |date=25 June 1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under state of mind (iv), the felony-murder doctrine, the felony committed must be an inherently dangerous felony, such as burglary, arson, rape, robbery or kidnapping. Importantly, the underlying felony ''cannot'' be a [[lesser included offense]] such as assault, otherwise all criminal homicides would be murder as all are felonies.

As with most legal terms, the precise definition of murder varies between jurisdictions and is usually codified in some form of legislation. Even when the legal distinction between murder and manslaughter is clear, it is not unknown for a jury to find a murder defendant guilty of the lesser offence. The jury might sympathise with the defendant (e.g. in a [[crime of passion]], or in the case of a bullied victim who kills their tormentor), and the jury may wish to protect the defendant from a sentence of life imprisonment or execution.

===Degrees of murder===
{{Redirect|Murder in the second degree|the 2016 album|Murder in the Second Degree}}
Many jurisdictions divide murder by degrees. The distinction between first- and second-degree murder exists, for example, in [[Murder (Canadian law)|Canadian murder law]] and [[Murder (United States law)#Degrees|U.S. murder law]].

The most common division is between first- and second-degree murder. Generally, second-degree murder is common law murder, and first-degree is an aggravated form. The aggravating factors of first-degree murder depend on the jurisdiction, but may include a specific intent to kill, premeditation, or deliberation. In some, murder committed by acts such as [[strangulation]], [[poisoning]], or [[lying in wait]] are also treated as first-degree murder.&lt;ref&gt;Murder in the First and Second Degree (14–17)
A murder which shall be perpetrated by ... poison, lying in wait, imprisonment, starving, torture, or by any other kind of willful, deliberate and premeditated killing or which shall be committed in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of any arson, rape or sex offense, robbery, kidnapping, burglary, or other felony committed or attempted with the use of a deadly weapon, shall be ... murder in the first degree ... and shall be punished by death or life imprisonment ... except that any person ... under 17 years of age at the time of the murder shall be punished with imprisonment ... for life.
All other kinds of murder, including that which shall be proximately caused by the unlawful distribution of opium or any synthetic or natural salt, compound, derivative, or the preparation of opium ... cause the death of the user, shall be ... murder in the second degree and ... shall be punished as a Class C felony
&lt;/ref&gt; A few states in the U.S. further distinguish [[third-degree murder]], but they differ significantly in which kinds of murders they classify as second-degree versus third-degree. For example, Minnesota defines third-degree murder as [[depraved-heart murder]], whereas Florida defines third-degree murder as [[felony murder]] (except when the underlying felony is specifically listed in the definition of first-degree murder).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1427&amp;context=flr|first=Frank|last=Brenner|title=The Impulsive Murder and the Degree Device|journal=Fordham Law Review|volume=22|issue=3|year=1953|access-date=2018-03-13|ref=harv|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313214239/https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1427&amp;context=flr|archivedate=2018-03-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statelaws.findlaw.com/minnesota-law/minnesota-second-degree-murder.html|title=Minnesota Second-Degree Murder|website=findlaw.com|access-date=2018-03-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180314043759/http://statelaws.findlaw.com/minnesota-law/minnesota-second-degree-murder.html|archivedate=2018-03-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some jurisdictions also distinguish premeditated murder. This is the [[crime]] of wrongfully and intentionally causing the death of another [[human]] being (also known as murder) after rationally considering the timing or method of doing so, in order to either increase the likelihood of success, or to evade detection or apprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Premeditation|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/premeditation|website=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=10 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910082842/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/premeditation|archivedate=10 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[U.S. state|State]] laws in the [[United States]] vary as to definitions of "premeditation". In some states, premeditation may be construed as taking place mere seconds before the murder. Premeditated murder is one of the most serious forms of [[homicide]], and is punished more severely than [[manslaughter]] or other types of murder, often with a [[life imprisonment|life sentence]] without the possibility of [[parole]], or in some countries, the [[capital punishment|death penalty]]. In the U.S, [[United States federal law|federal law]] ({{USCSub|18|1111|a}}) criminalizes premeditated murder, felony murder and second-degree murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Title 18 USC, Sec. 1111, Murder|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1111|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=10 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910040431/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1111|archivedate=10 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] classifies [[Murder (Canadian law)|murder]] as either 1st- or 2nd-degree. The former type of murder is often called premeditated murder, although premeditation is not the only way murder can be classified as first-degree.

===Common law===
According to Blackstone, English [[common law]] identified murder as a ''public wrong''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/blackstone/bk4ch14.htm |title=Blackstone, Book 4, Chapter 14 |publisher=Yale.edu |accessdate=2010-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203082805/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/blackstone/bk4ch14.htm |archivedate=2010-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to common law, murder is considered to be ''[[malum in se]]'', that is an act which is evil within itself. An act such as murder is wrong or evil by its very nature. And it is the very nature of the act which does not require any specific detailing or definition in the law to consider murder a crime.&lt;ref&gt;A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage By Bryan A. Garner, p. 545.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some jurisdictions still take a [[common law]] view of murder. In such jurisdictions, what is considered to be murder is defined by [[precedent]] case law or previous decisions of the courts of law. However, although the common law is by nature flexible and adaptable, in the interests both of certainty and of securing convictions, most common law jurisdictions have [[Codification (law)|codified]] their criminal law and now have statutory definitions of murder.

===Exclusions===

====General====
Although laws vary by country, there are circumstances of exclusion that are common in many legal systems.
*Killing of enemy combatants who have not surrendered by lawful combatants, in accordance with lawful orders in war, is also generally not considered murder; although illicit killings within a war may constitute murder or homicidal [[war crime]]s. (see the [[Laws of war]] article)
*[[Self-defence (theory)|Self-defence]]: acting in self-defence or in defence of another person is generally accepted as legal justification for killing a person in situations that would otherwise have been murder. However, a self-defence killing might be considered manslaughter if the killer established control of the situation before the killing took place. In the case of self-defence it is called a "justifiable homicide".&lt;ref name="crim liability"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000278633&amp;dateTexte=|title=Article 122-5|accessdate=2007-11-01|publisher=Legifrance|author=The French Parliament|website=French Criminal Law|language=fr|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408162844/http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000278633&amp;dateTexte=|archivedate=2008-04-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Unlawful killings without malice or intent are considered [[manslaughter]].
*In many common law countries, [[provocation (legal)|provocation]] is a partial defence to a charge of murder which acts by converting what would otherwise have been murder into manslaughter (this is voluntary manslaughter, which is more severe than involuntary manslaughter).
*Accidental killings are considered [[homicide]]s. Depending on the circumstances, these may or may not be considered criminal offenses; they are often considered [[manslaughter]].
*[[Suicide]] does not constitute murder in most societies. Assisting a suicide, however, may be considered murder in some circumstances.

====Specific to certain countries====
*[[Capital punishment]]: some countries practice the death penalty. Capital punishment may be ordered by a legitimate court of law as the result of a conviction in a [[criminal trial]] with [[due process]] for a serious crime. The 47 Member States of the [[Council of Europe]] are prohibited from using the death penalty.
*[[Euthanasia]], doctor-assisted suicide: the administration of lethal drugs by a doctor to a [[terminally ill]] patient, if the intention is solely to alleviate pain, in many jurisdictions it is seen as a special case (see the doctrine of [[double effect]] and the case of [[John Bodkin Adams|Dr John Bodkin Adams]]).&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mDvBJ5J4tusC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=%22Thomas+Lodwig%22+dr |title=Margaret Otlowski, '&amp;#39;Voluntary Euthanasia and the Common Law'&amp;#39;, Oxford University Press, 1997, pp. 175–177 |accessdate=2010-06-25|isbn=978-0-19-825996-1|year=1997|last1=Otlowski |first1=Margaret }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In the United States, in some states and in federal jurisdiction, a killing by a police officer is excluded from prosecution if the officer believes they are being threatened with deadly force by the victim.

*[[Space jurisdiction]] is similar to that of [[international waters]]. Therefore, a murder committed in outer space is subject to jurisdiction in the country that owns the space craft in which the killing transpired. In the event the murder occurred on an extraterrestrial planet (e.g. The [[Moon]]), no country can own land of any other planet&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-03-31|title=Outer Space Treaty|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Outer_Space_Treaty&amp;oldid=773109867|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the killer is bound by the laws of the country in which they originate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-04-26|title=Extraterritorial jurisdiction|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Extraterritorial_jurisdiction&amp;oldid=777327355|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also applies to the [[International Space Station|ISS]] per agreement signed by all countries that have worked on the station so all astronauts are covered by [[Extraterritorial jurisdiction|extraterratorial jurisdiction.]]

===Victim===
[[File:Jakub Schikaneder - Murder in the House.JPG|thumb|''Murder in the House'', [[Jakub Schikaneder]].]]
All jurisdictions require that the victim be a natural person; that is, a [[human being]] who was still alive before being murdered. In other words, under the law one cannot murder a [[cadaver|corpse]], a corporation, a non-human animal, or any other non-human [[organism]] such as a plant or bacterium.

[[California]]'s murder statute, [[California Penal Code|Penal Code]] [[187 (murder)|Section 187]], was interpreted by the [[Supreme Court of California]] in 1994 as not requiring any proof of the viability of the fetus as a prerequisite to a murder conviction.&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;''People v. Davis'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C4/7C4t797.htm 7 Cal. 4th 797, 30 Cal. Rptr. 2d 50, 872 P.2d 591] (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; This holding has two implications. The first is a defendant in California can be convicted of murder for killing a fetus which the mother herself could have terminated without committing a crime.&lt;ref name="davis" /&gt; The second, as stated by Justice [[Stanley Mosk]] in his dissent, is that because women carrying nonviable fetuses may not be visibly pregnant, it may be possible for a defendant to be convicted of intentionally murdering a person they did not know existed.&lt;ref name="davis" /&gt;

===Mitigating circumstances===
Some countries allow conditions that "affect the balance of the mind" to be regarded as [[mitigating factor|mitigating circumstances]]. This means that a person may be found guilty of "manslaughter" on the basis of "diminished responsibility" rather than being found guilty of murder, if it can be proved that the killer was suffering from a condition that affected their judgment at the time. [[clinical depression|Depression]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] and medication [[adverse effect (medicine)|side-effect]]s are examples of conditions that may be taken into account when assessing responsibility.

====Insanity====
{{main|Insanity defense|M'Naghten rules}}
[[Mental Disorder (Insanity) Defense|Mental disorder]] may apply to a wide range of disorders including [[psychosis]] caused by [[schizophrenia]] and [[dementia]], and excuse the person from the need to undergo the stress of a trial as to liability. Usually, [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopathy]] and other [[personality disorders]] are not legally considered insanity, because of the belief they are the result of [[free will]] in many societies. In some jurisdictions, following the pre-trial hearing to determine the extent of the disorder, the defence of "not guilty by reason of insanity" may be used to get a not guilty verdict.&lt;ref&gt;''M'Naughten's case'', [1843] All ER Rep 229.&lt;/ref&gt; This defence has two elements:

# That the [[defendant]] had a serious mental illness, disease, or defect.
# That the defendant's mental condition, at the time of the killing, rendered the perpetrator unable to determine right from wrong, or that what they were doing was wrong.
[[File:CCTV 1 of Aaron Alexis in building 197.jpg|thumb|[[Aaron Alexis]] holding a shotgun during his rampage.]]

Under [[New York (state)|New York]] law, for example:
{{quote|§ 40.15 Mental disease or defect. In any prosecution for an offense, it is an affirmative defence that when the defendant engaged in the proscribed conduct, he lacked criminal responsibility by reason of mental disease or defect. Such lack of criminal responsibility means that at the time of such conduct, as a result of mental disease or defect, he lacked substantial capacity to know or appreciate either: 1. The nature and consequences of such conduct; or 2. That such conduct was wrong.|[[N.Y. Penal Law]], § 40.15&lt;ref&gt;N.Y.

Under the [[French Penal Code of 1791|French Penal Code]]:
{{quote |Article 122-1
*A person is not criminally liable who, when the act was committed, was suffering from a psychological or neuropsychological disorder which destroyed his discernment or his ability to control his actions.
*A person who, at the time he acted, was suffering from a psychological or neuropsychological disorder which reduced his discernment or impeded his ability to control his actions, remains punishable; however, the court shall take this into account when it decides the penalty and determines its regime. |Penal Code §122-1 found at [http://195.83.177.9/code/liste.phtml?lang=uk&amp;c=33&amp;r=3627 Legifrance web site]}}

Those who successfully argue a defence based on a mental disorder are usually referred to mandatory clinical treatment until they are certified safe to be released back into the community, rather than prison.&lt;ref name="french civil law on mental health"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006072665&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000006687933&amp;dateTexte=20080929 |title=Code de la Santé Publique Chapitre III: Hospitalisation d'office Article L3213-1 |accessdate=2007-10-23 |publisher=Legifrance |year=2002 |language=fr |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021032011/http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006072665&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000006687933&amp;dateTexte=20080929 |archivedate=2008-10-21 |df= }}, note: this text refers to the procedure of [[involuntary commitment]] by the demand of the public authority, but the prefect systematically use that procedure whenever a man is discharged due to his dementia.&lt;/ref&gt;  A criminal defendant is often presented with the option of pleading "not guilty by reason of insanity".  Thus, a finding of insanity results in a not-guilty verdict, although the defendant is placed in a state treatment facility where they could be kept for years or even decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/7667/Insanity-Defense-Consequences.html|title=Insanity Defenses – Consequences|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=31 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801080137/http://law.jrank.org/pages/7667/Insanity-Defense-Consequences.html|archivedate=1 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Postpartum depression====
[[Postpartum depression]] (also known as post-natal depression) is recognized in some countries as a mitigating factor in cases of [[infanticide]]. According to Dr. Susan Friedman, "Two dozen nations have infanticide laws that decrease the penalty for mothers who kill their children of up to one year of age. The United States does not have such a law, but mentally ill mothers may plead not guilty by reason of insanity."&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, SH. "Commentary: Postpartum Psychosis, Infanticide, and Insanity Implications for Forensic Psychiatry", J Am Acad Psychiatry Law 40:3:326-332 (September 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[law of the Republic of Ireland]], infanticide was made a separate crime from murder in 1949, applicable for the mother of a baby under one year old where "the balance of her mind was disturbed by reason of her not having fully recovered from the effect of giving birth to the child or by reason of the effect of lactation consequent upon the birth of the child".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1949/act/16/section/1/enacted/en/html#sec1 |title=Infanticide Act, 1949, Section 1 |website=[[Irish Statute Book]] |accessdate=22 May 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601084439/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1949/act/16/section/1/enacted/en/html#sec1 |archivedate=1 June 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since independence, death sentences for murder in such cases had always been [[commutation of sentence|commuted]];&lt;ref name="Rattigan2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rattigan|first=Clíona|year=2008|title='Done to death by father or relatives': Irish families and infanticide cases, 1922–1950|journal=The History of the Family|volume=13|issue=4|pages=370–383|issn=1081-602X|doi=10.1016/j.hisfam.2008.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; the new act was intended "to eliminate all the terrible ritual of the [[black cap]] and the solemn words of the judge pronouncing sentence of death in those cases ... where it is clear to the Court and to everybody, except perhaps the unfortunate accused, that the sentence will never be carried out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/DebatesWebPack.nsf/takes/seanad1949070700007 |title=Infanticide Bill, 1949—Second and Subsequent Stages |website=Seanad Éireann debates |pages=Vol.36 c.1472 |nopp=Y |date=7 July 1949 |accessdate=22 May 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701225250/http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/DebatesWebPack.nsf/takes/seanad1949070700007 |archivedate=1 July 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Russia, murder of a newborn child by the mother has been separate crime since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[[Criminal Code of Russia]], art.106&lt;/ref&gt;

====Unintentional====
For a killing to be considered murder in nine out of fifty states in the US, there normally needs to be an element of intent. A defendant may argue that they took precautions not to kill, that the death could not have been anticipated, or was unavoidable. As a general rule, [[manslaughter]]&lt;ref name="manslaughter in France"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://195.83.177.9/code/liste.phtml?lang=uk&amp;c=33&amp;r=3691|title=Article 222-8|accessdate=2007-11-01|publisher=Legifrance|author=The French Parliament|website=French Criminal Law|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102221056/http://195.83.177.9/code/liste.phtml?lang=uk&amp;c=33&amp;r=3691|archivedate=2007-11-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; constitutes [[recklessness (law)|reckless]] killing, but manslaughter also includes criminally negligent (i.e. grossly negligent) homicide.&lt;ref name="invol offences"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://195.83.177.9/code/liste.phtml?lang=uk&amp;c=33&amp;r=3686|title=Section II – Involuntary Offences Against Life|accessdate=2007-11-01|publisher=Legifrance|author=The French Parliament|website=French Criminal Law|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102221040/http://195.83.177.9/code/liste.phtml?lang=uk&amp;c=33&amp;r=3686|archivedate=2007-11-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unintentional killing that results from an involuntary action generally cannot constitute murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Michaels|first1=Alan C.|title=Defining Unintended Murder|journal=Columbia Law Review|volume=85|issue=4|pages=786–811|jstor=1122334|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; After examining the evidence, a judge or jury (depending on the jurisdiction) would determine whether the killing was intentional or unintentional.

====Diminished capacity====
In those jurisdictions using the Uniform Penal Code, such as [[California]], [[diminished capacity]] may be a defence. For example, [[Dan White]] used this defence&lt;ref&gt;The so-called "[[Twinkie defense]]").&lt;/ref&gt; to obtain a manslaughter conviction, instead of murder, in the [[assassination]] of Mayor [[George Moscone]] and Supervisor [[Harvey Milk]]. Afterward, California amended its penal code to provide "As a matter of public policy there shall be no defense of diminished capacity, diminished responsibility, or irresistible impulse in a criminal action...."&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.justia.com/codes/california/2011/pen/part-1/25-29/28/ California Penal Code § 28(b)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425183608/https://law.justia.com/codes/california/2011/pen/part-1/25-29/28/ |date=2018-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aggravating circumstances===
Murder with specified [[aggravation (legal concept)|aggravating circumstances]] is often punished more harshly. Depending on the jurisdiction, such circumstances may include:

*Premeditation
*Poisoning
*Murder of a child
*Murder of a police officer,&lt;ref name="Murder English law"&gt;See [[Murder (English law)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NSW (of Australia) Law"&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|19B}} Mandatory life sentences for murder of police officers.&lt;/ref&gt; judge, firefighter or witness to a crime&lt;ref&gt;See [[Murder (United States law)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Murder in English law|Murder]], under [[English criminal law]], always carries a mandatory [[Life imprisonment in England and Wales|life sentence]], but is not classified into degrees. Penalties for murder committed under aggravating circumstances are often higher, under English law, than the 15-year minimum non-parole period that otherwise serves as a starting point for a murder committed by an adult.

===Felony murder rule===
{{Main|Felony murder rule}}
A legal [[doctrine]] in some [[common law]] jurisdictions  broadens the crime of murder: when an offender kills in the commission of a dangerous crime, (regardless of intent), he/she is guilty of murder. The felony murder rule is often justified by its supporters as a means of deterring dangerous felonies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sidak|first1=J.

===Year-and-a-day rule===
{{Main|Year and a day rule}}
In some [[common law]] jurisdictions, a [[defendant]] accused of murder is not guilty if the victim survives for longer than [[year and a day rule|one year and one day]] after the attack.&lt;ref&gt;See ''State v. Picotte'', 2003 WI 42, 261 Wis. 2d 249 (2003)[http://law.justia.com/wisconsin/codes/2010/940/940.10.html](search for "year-and-a-day rule")&lt;/ref&gt; This reflects the likelihood that if the victim dies, other factors will have contributed to the cause of death, breaking the chain of [[causation (law)|causation]]; and also means that the responsible person does not have a charge of murder "hanging over their head indefinitely".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Criminal lawyers back review of time limit for homicide charges|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/325302/criminal-lawyers-back-review-after-family's-plea|accessdate=14 August 2017|work=Radio NZ|date=25 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814102630/http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/325302/criminal-lawyers-back-review-after-family's-plea|archivedate=14 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subject to any [[statute of limitations]], the accused could still be charged with an offence reflecting the seriousness of the initial assault.

With advances in modern medicine, most countries have abandoned a fixed time period and test causation on the facts of the case. This is known as "delayed death" and cases where this was applied or was attempted to be applied go back to at least 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.newsweek.com/will-john-hinckley-jr-face-murder-charges-delayed-death-james-brady-263716|journal=Newsweek|title=Will John Hinckley Jr. Face Murder Charges for the 'Delayed Death' of James Brady?|last=Wofford|first=Taylor|date=August 9, 2014|accessdate=2015-02-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150310062113/http://www.newsweek.com/will-john-hinckley-jr-face-murder-charges-delayed-death-james-brady-263716|archivedate=March 10, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[England and Wales]], the "year-and-a-day rule" was abolished by the [[Law Reform (Year and a Day Rule) Act 1996]]. However, if death occurs three years or more after the original attack then prosecution can take place only with the [[Attorney-General]]'s approval.

In the United States, many jurisdictions have abolished the rule as well.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3098137125217744818|title=''People v.

In 2001 the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that retroactive application of a state supreme court decision abolishing the year-and-a-day rule did not violate the [[Ex post facto law|Ex Post Facto]] Clause of [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I of the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Rogers v. Tennessee]]'', {{ussc|532|451|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The potential effect of fully abolishing the rule can be seen in the case of 74-year-old William Barnes, charged with the murder of a Philadelphia police officer Walter Barkley, who he'd shot nearly 41 years before. Barnes had served 16 years in prison for attempting to murder Barkley, but when the policeman died on August 19, 2007, this was alleged to be from complications of the wounds suffered from the shooting - and Barnes was charged with his murder. He was acquitted on May 24, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shooter acquitted of murder charge in 1966 shooting of Philadelphia police officer|url=http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2010/05/shooter_acquitted_of_murder_ch.html|agency=Associated Press|publisher=PA Media Group|date=24 May 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910084004/http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2010/05/shooter_acquitted_of_murder_ch.html|archivedate=10 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder and natural selection==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2016}}
[[Martin Daly]] and [[Margo Wilson]] of [[McMaster University]] have claimed that several aspects of [[homicide]]s, including the genetic relations or proximity between murderers and their victims, (as in the [[Cinderella effect]]), can often be explained by the [[evolution theory]] or [[evolutionary psychology]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=dan|title=Human behaviour: Killer instincts|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080130/full/451512a.html|website=nature.com|publisher=Nature|accessdate=23 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170528155523/http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080130/full/451512a.html|archivedate=28 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Abrahamic religion]]s, the first ever murder was committed by [[Cain]] against his brother Abel out of [[jealousy]].&lt;ref&gt;Schimmel, Solomon. "Envy in Jewish thought and literature." Envy: Theory and research (2008): 17-38.&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, certain types of homicide were lawful and justified. Georg Oesterdiekhoff wrote:

{{quote|Evans-Pritchard says about the [[Nuer people|Nuer]] from Sudan: "Homicide is not forbidden, and Nuer do not think it wrong to kill a man in fair fight. On the contrary, a man who slays another in combat is admired for his courage and skill." ([[E. E. Evans-Pritchard|Evans-Pritchard]] 1956: 195) This statement is true for most African tribes, for pre-modern Europeans, for Indigenous Australians, and for Native Americans, according to ethnographic reports from all over the world. ... Homicides rise to incredible numbers among [[headhunting|headhunter]] cultures such as the [[New Guinea|Papua]]. When a boy is born, the father has to kill a man. He needs a name for his child and can receive it only by a man, he himself has murdered. When a man wants to marry, he must kill a man. When a man dies, his family again has to kill a man.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Oesterdiekhoff.

In many such societies the redress was not via a legal system, but by [[blood feud|blood revenge]], although there might also be a form of payment that could be made instead—such as the [[weregild]] which in early [[Germanic society]] could be paid to the victim's family [[in lieu]] of their right of revenge.

One of the oldest-known prohibitions against murder appears in the Sumerian [[Code of Ur-Nammu]] written sometime between 2100 and 2050 [[Before Christ|BC]]. The code states, "If a man commits a murder, that man must be killed."

In [[Judeo-Christian]] traditions, the [[murder in the Bible|prohibition against murder]] is one of the [[Ten Commandments]] given by God to Moses in (Exodus: 20v13) and (Deuteronomy 5v17). The [[Vulgate]] and subsequent early English translations of the Bible used the term ''secretly killeth his neighbour'' or ''smiteth his neighbour secretly'' rather than ''murder'' for the Latin ''clam percusserit proximum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latinvulgate.com/verse.aspx?t=0&amp;b=5&amp;c=27 |title='&amp;#39;Vulgate'&amp;#39; Deuteronomy Ch27 V24 |publisher=Latinvulgate.com |accessdate=2010-06-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010204152/http://latinvulgate.com/verse.aspx?t=0&amp;b=5&amp;c=27 |archivedate=2010-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hebrewoldtestament.com/B05C027.htm#V24 |title='&amp;#39;Parallel Hebrew Old Testament'&amp;#39; Deuteronomy Ch27 V24 |publisher=Hebrewoldtestament.com |accessdate=2010-06-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129231400/http://hebrewoldtestament.com/B05C027.htm#V24 |archivedate=2010-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later editions such as [[Young's Literal Translation]] and the [[World English Bible]] have translated the Latin ''occides'' simply as ''murder''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/bible/ylt/Exodus/20.html |title=Exodus 20v13 |quote=Thou dost not murder. |website=Young's Literal Translation |accessdate=2011-01-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426062140/http://www.ccel.org/bible/ylt/Exodus/20.html |archivedate=2011-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Exodus 20v13 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/8229/pg8229.txt |quote=You shall not murder. |website=World English Bible |accessdate=2011-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than the alternatives of ''kill'', ''assassinate'', ''fall upon'', or ''slay''.

In [[Islam]] according to the [[Qur'an]], one of the greatest [[sin]]s is to kill a human being who has committed no fault. "For that cause We decreed for the Children of Israel that whosoever killeth a human being for other than manslaughter or corruption in the earth, it shall be as if he had killed all mankind, and whoso saveth the life of one, it shall be as if he had saved the life of all mankind."{{Cite quran|5|32}} "And those who cry not unto any other god along with Allah, nor take the life which Allah hath forbidden save in (course of) justice, nor commit adultery – and whoso doeth this shall pay the penalty."{{Cite quran|25|68}}

The term ''assassin'' derives from [[Hashshashin]],&lt;ref&gt;''American Speech'' – McCarthy, Kevin M.. Volume 48, pp. 77–83&lt;/ref&gt; a militant [[Ismaili]] Shi'ite sect, active from the 8th to 14th centuries.

Murder demographics are affected by the improvement of [[trauma care]], which has resulted in reduced lethality of violent assaults – thus the murder rate may not necessarily indicate the overall level of social violence.&lt;ref name="harristhomas"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris |first=Anthony R. |author2=Stephen H.

Workplace homicide, which tripled during the 1980s, is the fastest growing category of murder in America.&lt;ref name="ojp.usdoj.gov" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Csiernik|editor-first=Rick|date=2014 |title=Workplace Wellness: Issues and Responses|url= |location= |publisher=Brown Bear Press|page=19 |isbn=978-1551305714|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of murder rates over time in different countries is often used by both supporters and opponents of capital punishment and [[gun control]]. Using properly filtered data, it is possible to make the case for or against either of these issues. For example, one could look at murder rates in the United States from 1950 to 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Christopher Effgen |url=http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm |title=Disaster Center web site |publisher=Disastercenter.com |date=2001-09-11 |accessdate=2010-06-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68d9ZfOC6?url=http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm |archivedate=2012-06-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and notice that those rates went up sharply shortly after a [[capital punishment in the United States|moratorium on death sentences]] was effectively imposed in the late 1960s. This fact has been used to argue that capital punishment serves as a deterrent and, as such, it is morally justified. Capital punishment opponents frequently counter that the United States has much higher murder rates than [[Canada]] and most [[European Union]] countries, although all those countries have abolished the death penalty. Overall, the global pattern is [[chaos theory|too complex]], and on average, the influence of both these factors may not be significant and could be more social, economic, and cultural.

Despite the immense improvements in [[forensics]] in the past few decades, the fraction of murders solved has decreased in the United States, from 90% in 1960 to 61% in 2007.&lt;ref name="mccune"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beale|first1=Lewis|title=Why Fewer Murder Cases Get Solved These Days|url=https://psmag.com/news/fewer-murder-cases-get-solved-3695|accessdate=10 September 2017|agency=PacificStandard|date=20 May 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910125159/https://psmag.com/news/fewer-murder-cases-get-solved-3695|archivedate=10 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solved murder rates in major U.S. cities varied in 2007 from 36% in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] to 76% in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[California]].&lt;ref name="monitor"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whitley|first1=Brian|title=Why fewer murder cases get solved|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2008/1224/p02s01-usgn.html|accessdate=10 September 2017|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|date=24 December 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910084042/https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2008/1224/p02s01-usgn.html|archivedate=10 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major factors affecting the arrest rate include witness cooperation&lt;ref name="mccune" /&gt; and the number of people assigned to investigate the case.&lt;ref name="monitor" /&gt;

===History of murder rates===
[[File:Homicide-world.png|250px|thumb|Intentional homicide rate per 100,000 inhabitants, 2009]]
According to scholar Pieter Spierenburg [[homicide rates]] per 100,000 in [[Europe]] have fallen over the centuries, from 35 per 100,000 in medieval times, to 20 in 1500&amp;nbsp;AD, 5 in 1700, to below two per 100,000 in 1900.&lt;ref name="Spierenburg"&gt;Spierenburg, Pieter, ''A History of Murder: Personal Violence in Europe from the Middle Ages to the Present'', Polity, 2008. Referred to in [http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2009/11/09/091109crat_atlarge_lepore#ixzz0ePRpHvGz "Rap Sheet Why is American history so murderous?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109044828/http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2009/11/09/091109crat_atlarge_lepore |date=2010-01-09 }} by [[Jill Lepore]] New Yorker, November 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, murder rates have been higher and have fluctuated. They fell below 2 per 100,000 by 1900, rose during the first half of the century, dropped in the years following World War II, and bottomed out at 4.0 in 1957 before rising again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US murder rate by year, 1900-2010|url=https://www.democraticunderground.com/10021998000|website=Democratic Underground|accessdate=10 September 2017|date=16 December 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910083329/https://www.democraticunderground.com/10021998000|archivedate=10 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate stayed in 9 to 10 range most of the period from 1972 to 1994, before falling to 5 in present times.&lt;ref name="Spierenburg" /&gt; The increase since 1957 would have been even greater if not for the significant improvements in medical techniques and emergency response times, which mean that more and more attempted homicide victims survive. According to one estimate, if the lethality levels of criminal assaults of 1964 still applied in 1993, the country would have seen the murder rate of around 26 per 100,000, almost triple the actually observed rate of 9.5 per 100,000.&lt;ref name="harristhomas"/&gt;

[[File:Historical homicide rate in Stockholm.svg|thumb|left|250px|The historical homicide rate in [[Stockholm]] since 1400&amp;nbsp;AD. The murder rate was very high in the [[Middle Ages]]. The rate has declined greatly: from 45 / 100,000 to a low of 0.6 in the 1950s. The last decades have seen the homicide rate rise slowly.]]
A similar, but less pronounced pattern has been seen in major European countries as well. The murder rate in the United Kingdom fell to 1 per 100,000 by the beginning of the 20th century and as low as 0.62 per 100,000 in 1960, and was at 1.28 per 100,000 {{as of|lc=y|2009}}. The murder rate in France (excluding Corsica) bottomed out after World War II at less than 0.4 per 100,000, quadrupling to 1.6 per 100,000 since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cjrc.osu.edu/researchprojects/hvd/AHSV/tables/AHSV%20European%20Homicides.pdf|title=American Homicide Supplemental Volume (AHSV), European Homicides (EH)|author=Randolph Roth|date=October 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629054202/http://cjrc.osu.edu/researchprojects/hvd/AHSV/tables/AHSV%20European%20Homicides.pdf|archivedate=2010-06-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specific factors driving this dynamics in murder rates are complex and not universally agreed upon. Much of the raise in the U.S. murder rate during the first half of the 20th century is generally thought to be attributed to gang violence associated with [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]. Since most murders are committed by young males, the near simultaneous low in the murder rates of major developed countries circa 1960 can be attributed to low birth rates during the Great Depression and World War II. Causes of further moves are more controversial. Some of the more exotic factors claimed to affect murder rates include the availability of abortion&lt;ref&gt;"Freakonomics", Steven D. Levitt, Stephen J. Dubner, 2005, {{ISBN|0-06-073132-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the likelihood of chronic exposure to [[lead poisoning#Nervous system|lead]] during childhood (due to the use of leaded paint in houses and [[tetraethyllead]] as a gasoline additive in internal combustion engines).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Negative-bias temperature instability''' ('''NBTI''') is a key reliability issue in [[MOSFET]]s. NBTI manifests as an increase in the [[threshold voltage]] and consequent decrease in drain current and [[transconductance]] of a MOSFET. The degradation exhibits a [[power law|power-law]] dependence on time. It is of immediate concern in p-channel [[MOSFET|MOS]] devices (pMOS), since they almost always operate with negative gate-to-source voltage; however, the very same mechanism also affects nMOS transistors when biased in the accumulation regime, i.e. with a negative bias applied to the gate.

== Physics ==
The details of the mechanisms of NBTI have been debated, but two effects are believed to contribute: trapping of positively charged [[Electron hole|holes]], and generation of interface states. 

* preexisting traps located in the bulk of the dielectric are filled with holes coming from the channel of pMOS. Those traps can be emptied when the stress voltage is removed, so that the Vth degradation can be recovered over time.
* interface traps are generated, and these interface states become positively charged when the pMOS device is biased in the "on" state, i.e. with negative gate voltage.  Some interface states may become deactivated when the stress is removed, so that the Vth degradation can be recovered over time. 

The existence of two coexisting mechanisms has resulted in scientific controversy over the relative importance of each component, and over the mechanism of generation and recovery of interface states. 

In sub-micrometer devices [[nitrogen]] is incorporated into the silicon [[gate oxide]] to reduce the gate leakage current density and prevent [[boron]] penetration. It is known that incorporating nitrogen enhances NBTI. For new technologies (45&amp;nbsp;nm and shorter nominal channel lengths), [[high-K]] metal gate stacks are used as an alternative to improve the gate current density for a given equivalent oxide thickness (EOT). Even with the introduction of new materials like hafnium oxides, NBTI remains.

With the introduction of high K metal gates, a new degradation mechanism appeared, referred to as PBTI (for positive bias temperature instabilities), which affects nMOS transistor when positively biased. In this case, no interface states are generated and 100% of the Vth degradation may be recovered.

'''OscilloScoop''' is an [[interactive music]] app for [[IOS (Apple)|iOS]] that runs on the [[iPad]], [[iPhone]], and [[iPod Touch]], available through the [[iTunes App Store]]. The app presents a real-time interface for creating electronic music in various [[electronic music]] genres from [[hip hop]] to [[techno]] and [[house music|house]]. The app is designed with a minimalist modern interface of three colored crowns, that spin like potters' wheels. Touching each crown affects the parameters of the audio. The top crown controls pitch, the middle a low pass resonant filter, and the bottom a fader. Controls on the left allow one to change the [[bassline]] beat, while buttons on the right allow the user to save their creation, and a slider below controls tempo.&lt;ref&gt;John Pavlus, [http://www.fastcodesign.com/1663839/oscilloscoop-ipad-app-turns-electro-djing-into-a-video-game Wanted: OscilloScoop iPad App Makes DJing A Video Game], FastCompany Design,  May 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://itunes.com/apps/oscilloscoop OscilloScoop in the iTunes App Store]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, OscilloScoop won the [[Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe|ZKM]] App Art Award, the first award ever given to art apps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.app-art-award.org/jury-winners/ 2011 ZKM App Art Award Winners]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

OscilloScoop was designed by [[Lukas Girling]], a creator of interactive musical interfaces who has worked with world-renowned musicians and music technologists including Laurie Anderson and Max Mathews. The app was created in collaboration with interactive artist and programmer [[Scott Snibbe]], author of the bestselling apps [[Bubble Harp]] and [[Gravilux]]; and [[Graham McDermott]], noted video game and app developer.&lt;ref&gt;Reyhan Harmanci, [http://www.baycitizen.org/blogs/culturefeed/mobile-artists-latest-release-video/ App Artist's Latest Release: OscilloScoop] Bay Citizen / New York Times, retrieved May 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snibbe.com/store/oscilloscoop/ OscilloScoop description from snibbe.com], retrieved May 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Girling and Snibbe began working together in 1996 at [[Interval Research]] researching new forms of musical instruments with [[Joy Mountford]] and [[Bob Adams (musician)|Bob Adams]]. As part of the research groups there, they were able to collaborate with, and learn from highly regarded musicians and musical pioneers including [[Brian Eno]], [[Laurie Anderson]], and [[Max Mathews]]. Their work at Interval Research was never published, and they recently re-united to produce a new app for [[IOS (Apple)|iOS]] that allows ordinary people to create electronic music with similar results as professionals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creativeapplications.net/iphone/oscilloscoop-iphone-ipad-sound/ CreativeApplications.net OscilloScoop review] retrieved May 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Their work borrows from the language of DJs, using the body's movements to create music in real-time, rather than composing music slice-by-slice with complex music authoring tools like [[ProTools]] and [[Ableton Live]], creating "something as effortless (and fun) as Super Mario," according to Snibbe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snibbe.com/blog/2011/05/03/music-of-chance/ Music of Chance],  blog posting by Scott Snibbe retrieved May 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3559">In [[applied statistics]], a '''partial residual plot''' is a [[graphical technique]] that attempts to show the relationship between a given [[independent variable]] and the [[response variable]] given that other independent variables are also in the [[Statistical model|model]].

==Background==
When performing a [[linear regression]] with a single [[independent variable]], a [[scatter plot]] of the [[response variable]] against the independent variable provides a good indication of the nature of the relationship. If there is more than one independent variable, things become more complicated. Although it can still be useful to generate scatter plots of the response variable against each of the independent variables, this does not take into account the effect of the other independent variables in the model.

==Definition==
Partial residual plots are formed as:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{Residuals} + \hat{\beta}_iX_i \mathrm{\ versus\ } X_i 
&lt;/math&gt;
where
:Residuals = [[errors and residuals in statistics|residuals]] from the [[full model]]
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\beta}_i&lt;/math&gt; = regression coefficient from the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; independent variable in the full model
:''X''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; independent variable

Partial residual plots are widely discussed in the regression diagnostics literature (e.g., see the References section below). Although they can often be useful, they can also fail to indicate the proper relationship. In particular, if ''X''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is highly correlated with any of the other independent variables, the variance indicated by the partial residual plot can be much less than the actual variance. These issues are discussed in more detail in the references given below.

==CCPR plot==
The CCPR (component and component-plus-residual) plot is a refinement of the partial residual plot, adding
:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{\beta}_iX_i \mathrm{\ versus\ } X_i.
&lt;/math&gt;

This is the "component" part of the plot and is intended to show where the "fitted line" would lie.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18233">The '''Pornography Victims Compensation Act''' of 1991 was a bill, S. 983,&lt;ref name="Thos-billsummary-S983-S1521"&gt;'[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bssQuery/?&amp;Opt=T&amp;Db=102&amp;srch=/home/LegislativeData.php?n=BSS&amp;TxtStr=PORNOGRAPHY+VICTIMS+COMPENSATION+ACT+OF+1991 ''Bill Summary &amp; Status Search Results'', in ''THOMAS'' website of ''The Library of Congress''], as accessed Sep. 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]].

== Legislative substance ==
Under the bill, a person who was attacked after the attacker was substantially spurred by pornography could have been able to sue the [[pornography]]'s producers, publishers, distributors, exhibitors, and sellers without needing a prior [[Indictment|criminal charge]] against the pornography itself.&lt;ref name="ABAJ-Feminists-Back-Bill"&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?index=4&amp;did=8728422&amp;SrchMode=2&amp;sid=3&amp;Fmt=3&amp;VInst=PROD&amp;VType=PQD&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD&amp;TS=1264360124&amp;clientId=7514 Reske, Henry J., ''Feminists Back Anti-Porn Bill'', in ''American Bar Association Journal'' (ABAJ), Jun., 1992, vol. 78, p. 32 ({{ISSN|0747-0088}}) (''ProQuest'' database)], as accessed Jan. 24, 2010, or [http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=8728422&amp;sid=3&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientId=7514&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD alternative link].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Torrey, Morrison, ''The Resurrection of the Antipornography Ordinance'', in ''Texas Journal of Women and the Law'', vol. 2, issue 1, pp. 116–117 (Winter 1993) (author assoc. prof., De Paul Univ. Coll. of Law).&lt;/ref&gt; It was written not to prohibit any publication, but to hold liable for certain consequences, according to McConnell.&lt;ref name="ABAJ-Feminists-Back-Bill" /&gt; For political pragmatism, the bill was limited to [[child pornography]] and [[Obscenity|obscene material]], that being already unprotected by the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution's]] [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref name="ABAJ-Feminists-Back-Bill" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USAT-Bill-Liable"&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?index=5&amp;did=56198293&amp;SrchMode=2&amp;sid=3&amp;Fmt=3&amp;VInst=PROD&amp;VType=PQD&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD&amp;TS=1264360771&amp;clientId=7514 Puente, Maria, ''Bill Holds Porn Producers Liable For Sex Crimes'', in ''USA Today'', Apr. 15, 1992, p. 09A (Final ed.)

As part of the rationale for passage, McConnell argued "that crime is fostered by a culture in which the sexual degradation, abuse, and murder of women and children are a form of entertainment", that "[t]he connection between the amount of violent entertainment and the amount of real-life violence is no longer seriously doubted among social scientists," that "more than one million children from six months to sixteen years old are sexually molested and then filmed or photographed", and that "[p]ornography is fueling violence in this country".&lt;ref&gt;Four quotations: Greco, Albert N., ''The First Amendment, Freedom of the Press, and the Issue of "Harm": A Conundrum for Publishers'', in ''Publishing Research Quarterly'', vol. 11, no. 4, p. 48 &amp; nn. 35–37 (Winter 1995/96) (author clinical assoc. prof., N.Y.

The formal title varied by year, as listed in the [[#History|History section]], below.

Informally, it was known as the ''Bundy Bill'', after serial murderer [[Ted Bundy]], who [[Ted Bundy#Pathology|attributed his killings partly to porn]].&lt;ref name="USAT-Bill-Liable" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bundy-NewRepub"&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?index=6&amp;did=1836361&amp;SrchMode=2&amp;sid=3&amp;Fmt=6&amp;VInst=PROD&amp;VType=PQD&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD&amp;TS=1264360771&amp;clientId=7514 ''Bundy's Revenge: How to Sue Playboy'', by Maureen Dezell, in ''The New Republic'', vol. 206, no. 10, Mar. 9, 1992, pp. 15&amp;ndash;16 (''ProQuest'' (''Platinum Periodicals'') database (Full Text - PDF))], as accessed Jan. 25, 2010, [http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?index=2&amp;did=1836361&amp;SrchMode=1&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=6&amp;VInst=PROD&amp;VType=PQD&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD&amp;TS=1264724263&amp;clientId=79940 an alternative link], as accessed Jan. 28, 2010, or [http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=1836361&amp;sid=10&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientId=4273&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD another alternative link].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Torrey, Morrison, ''The Resurrection of the Anti-Pornography Ordinance'', ''op. cit.'', p. 116 n. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The bill or versions of it had been under Congressional consideration for seven years prior. Earlier versions reached a wider range of pornography&lt;ref name="ABAJ-Feminists-Back-Bill" /&gt; but had less support; narrowing that range to what was unprotected by [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decisions on the First Amendment led to wider support.

Other versions, searched for as introduced from approximately 1973 to part of 2010, included these:
* ''Pornography Victims Protection Act of 1984'', S. 3063 in the [[United States Senate|Senate]], introduced by Sen. [[Arlen Specter]] with no cosponsors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bssQuery/?&amp;Opt=T&amp;Db=098&amp;srch=/home/LegislativeData.php?n=BSS&amp;TxtStr=PORNOGRAPHY+VICTIMS+PROTECTION+ACT+OF+1984 ''Bill Summary &amp; Status Search Results'', in ''THOMAS'' website of ''The Library of Congress''], as accessed Sep. 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Hearings were held and, according to Sen. Specter, "[w]itnesses disagreed sharply about the general social effects of such [pornographic] materials. Some, such as Andrea Dworkin and Catherine {{sic}} MacKinnon, claimed that violent pornography is central to gender unequally {{sic}} in our society. Others, including Barry Lynn of the American Civil Liberties Union, denied that such a broad factual claim has been conclusively established.&lt;ref name="CongRcd-10-3084-p29169"&gt;United States of America, ''Congressional Record: Proceedings and Debates of the 98th Congress Second Session'', vol. 130, part 21, p. 29169, Oct. 3, 1984 (Washington [D.C.]: U.S. Gov't Printing Ofc., [final or permanent ed. (red bound)] 1984) (part 21 is Oct. 3–4, 1984, ''i.e.'', pp. 28831–30289) (Sen. Specter's statement at pp. 29169–29175 &amp; bill's introduction also at pp. 29153–29154) (although Sen. Specter asked that his Federal bill be printed with his statement, per ''id.'', p. 29170, it was not (pp. 29170–29175)) (pp. 29153–29154 &amp; 29169–29175 may correlate for content with, in the daily ed., p. S&amp;nbsp;13192 &amp; probably other pp.).&lt;/ref&gt; Sen. Specter considered it "premature" to introduce legislation "based on a civil rights approach", referring to an [[Indianapolis]] ordinance and a proposed [[Minneapolis]] ordinance,&lt;ref name="CongRcd-10-3084-p29169" /&gt; but did introduce S. 3063&lt;ref name="CongRcd-10-3084-p29169" /&gt; instead.
* ''Pornography Victims Protection Act of 1985'', S. 1187 in the Senate, introduced by Sen.

D&amp;nbsp;600, thus not the final or permanent ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, Sen.

== Supporters and opponents ==

=== 1991 bill ===
Support came from [[Feminists Fighting Pornography]] and 200 [[National Organization for Women|National Organization for Women (NOW)]] chapters, but not two in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[California]]&lt;ref name="USAT-Bill-Liable" /&gt; and not from the national level of NOW.&lt;ref name="Bundy-NewRepub" /&gt; Support simultaneously came from Christian fundamentalists.&lt;ref name="Bundy-NewRepub" /&gt;

Opponents included [[Nadine Strossen]], [[Betty Friedan]], [[Adrienne Rich]], [[Katha Pollitt]], [[Karen DeCrow]], [[Nora Ephron]], [[Mary Gordon (child advocate)|Mary Gordon]], [[Judy Blume]], [[Jamaica Kincaid]], [[Erica Jong]], [[Susan Isaacs]], and "172 other feminist women"&lt;ref name="VaLRvw-CritCritPorn-esp-appx"&gt;Strossen, Nadine, ''A Feminist Critique of "the" Feminist Critique of Pornography'', in ''Virginia Law Review'', vol. 79, no. 5 (Aug., 1993), p. 1099 ''ff.''

=== 1992 bill ===
Supporters, according to Sen. McConnell, included the [[Family Research Council]], Feminists Fighting Pornography, the [[American Family Association]], victims rights groups, and some chapters of the National Organization for Women.&lt;ref&gt;Greco, Albert N., ''The First Amendment, Freedom of the Press, and the Issue of "Harm"'', ''op. cit.'', p. 48 &amp; nn. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt; In the opposition was an editorial in [[The New York Times]].&lt;ref&gt;Greco, Albert N., ''The First Amendment, Freedom of the Press, and the Issue of "Harm"'', ''op. cit.'', p. 48 (''Times'' editorial published April 13, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Criticisms came from more than one direction: that the bill would punish a wide range of nonpornographic movies because criminals were inspired by them,&lt;ref name="ABAJ-Feminists-Back-Bill" /&gt; that it would lead to bans of feminist positive literature about women,&lt;ref name="ABAJ-Feminists-Back-Bill" /&gt; that booksellers would be timid about many titles that weren't obscene but just generally controversial,&lt;ref name="USAT-Bill-Liable" /&gt; that scientists hadn't established a firm link between porn and misbehavior,&lt;ref name="USAT-Bill-Liable" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bundy-NewRepub" /&gt; that criminals should be held responsible for their actions rather than third parties being held liable,&lt;ref name="USAT-Bill-Liable" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bundy-NewRepub" /&gt; that similar legislation against bars because subsequent drunken driving led to accidents had not been tested against major beer producers,&lt;ref name="USAT-Bill-Liable" /&gt; that using civil procedure rather than criminal to test if material is obscene when the standard of proof is lower in civil cases would make finding it obscene more likely,&lt;ref name="Bundy-NewRepub" /&gt; that juries seeing an attacked woman as a victim would be likelier to judge that material was obscene,&lt;ref name="Bundy-NewRepub" /&gt; that obscenity being defined by community standards and retailers' skittishness meant that the strictest community would be the standard-bearer for the nation,&lt;ref name="Bundy-NewRepub" /&gt; and that it didn't encompass all the pornography that feminists found violated women's civil rights.&lt;ref name="USAT-Bill-Liable" /&gt;

'''Psychological pricing''' (also '''price ending''', '''charm pricing''') is a [[pricing strategies|pricing and marketing strategy]] based on the theory that certain prices have a psychological impact. Retail prices are often expressed as "odd prices": a little less than a round number, e.g. $19.99 or £2.98. There is evidence that consumers tend to perceive "odd prices" as being lower than they actually are, tending to round to the next lowest monetary unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Direct evidence of ending-digit drop-off in price information processing|journal = Psychology and Marketing|date = 2005|pages = 771–783|volume = 22|issue = 10|doi = 10.1002/mar.20084|language = en|first = George Y.|last = Bizer|first2 = Robert M.|last2 = Schindler}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, prices such as $1.99 are associated with spending $1 rather than $2. The theory that drives this is that lower pricing such as this institutes greater demand than if consumers were perfectly rational. Psychological pricing is one cause of [[price point]]s.

==Overview==
According to a 1997 study published in the ''Marketing Bulletin'', approximately 60% of prices in advertising material ended in the digit 9, 30% ended in the digit 5, 7% ended in the digit 0 and the remaining seven digits combined accounted for only slightly over 3% of prices evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marketing-bulletin.massey.ac.nz/V8/MB_V8_N1_Holdershaw.pdf The Widespread Use Of Odd Pricing In The Retail Sector], ''Marketing Bulletin'', 1997, 8, Research Note 1, J Holdershaw, P Gendall and R Garland. {{ISSN|1176-645X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, before the withdrawal of the [[British halfpenny coin|halfpenny coin]] in 1969, prices often ended in 11{{frac|1|2}}d (elevenpence halfpenny: just under a shilling, which was 12d); another example was £1/19/11¾d. (one pound, nineteen shillings and elevenpence three farthings) which is one [[Farthing (British coin)|farthing]] under £2. This is still seen today in gasoline (petrol) pricing ending in {{frac|9|10}} of the local currency's smallest denomination; for example in the US the price of a gallon of gasoline almost always ends in US$0.009 (e.g. US$1.799).

In a traditional cash transaction, fractional pricing imposes tangible costs on the vendor (printing fractional prices), the cashier (producing awkward change) and the customer (stowing the change). These factors have become less relevant with the increased use of checks, credit and debit cards and other forms of currency-free exchange; also, the addition of sales tax makes the pre-tax price less relevant to the amount of change (although in Europe the sales tax is generally included in the shelf price).

The psychological pricing theory is based on one or more of the following hypotheses:
* The first theory that explains the rationale for odd pricing is prospect theory. This theory says that "consumers facing uncertainty in decision making, base the value of an alternative on gains or losses offered by the alternative, relative to some reference point, rather than on final absolute states of wealth or welfare". This theory is based on the fact that losses mean more than gains. So based on that criterion, one would think that something only a few cents under a whole dollar would actually be beneficial to the price. This theory works so well because of how the "reference price" is established by the consumer. The reference price for something that is $19.98 would be $20. This establishes the odd pricing as a better deal.
* Judgments of numerical differences are anchored on left-most digits, a behavioral phenomenon referred to as the left-digit anchoring effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Manoj|last2=Morwitz|first2=Vicki|volume=32|issue=1|date=June 2005|title=Penny Wise and Pound Foolish: The Left‐Digit Effect in Price Cognition|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|pages=55–64|doi=10.1086/429600 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis suggests that people perceive the difference between 1.99 and 3.00 to be closer to 2.01 than to 1.01 because their judgments are anchored on the left-most digit.
* Consumers ignore the least significant digits rather than do the proper rounding. Even though the cents are seen and not totally ignored, they may subconsciously be partially ignored. Keith Coulter, Associate Professor of Marketing at the Graduate School of Management, Clark University, suggests that this effect may be enhanced when the cents are printed smaller (for example, $19&lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.clarku.edu/gsom/documents/ConnectWinter2012.pdf|page=5|newspaper=Connect: News from the Graduate School of Management at Clark University|publisher=[[Clark University]]|date=Winter 2012|title=Keith Coulter}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fractional prices suggest to consumers that goods are marked at the lowest possible price.
* When items are listed in a way that is segregated into price bands (such as an online real estate search), price ending is used to keep an item in a lower band, to be seen by more potential purchasers.

The theory of psychological pricing is controversial. Some studies show that buyers, even young children, have a very sophisticated understanding of true cost and [[relative value (economics)|relative value]] and that, to the limits of the accuracy of the test, they behave rationally. Other researchers claim that this ignores the non-rational nature of the phenomenon and that acceptance of the theory requires belief in a subconscious level of thought processes, a belief that economic models tend to deny or ignore. Results from research using modern scanner data are mixed.

Now that many customers are used to odd pricing, some restaurants and high-end retailers psychologically-price in even numbers in an attempt to reinforce their brand image of quality and sophistication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Hospitality Managers’ Price-Ending Beliefs A Survey and Applications|journal = Cornell Hospitality Quarterly|date = 2011|pages = 421–428|volume = 52|issue = 4|doi = 10.1177/1938965511421168|language = en|first = Robert M.|last = Schindler|first2 = H.

==Research==
[[Kaushik Basu]] used [[game theory]] in 1997 to argue that rational consumers value their own time and effort at calculation. Such consumers process the price from left to right and tend to mentally replace the last two digits of the price with an estimate of the mean "cent component" of all goods in the marketplace. In a sufficiently large marketplace, this implies that any individual seller can charge the largest possible "cent component" (99¢) without significantly affecting the average of cent components and without changing customer behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0165-1765(97)00009-8|title=Why are so many goods priced to end in nine? And why this practice hurts the producers|journal=Economics Letters|volume=54|pages=41–44|year=1997|last1=Basu|first1=Kaushik}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruffle and Shtudiner's (2006) laboratory test shows considerable support for Basu's 99-cent pricing equilibrium, particularly when other sellers' prices are observable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ruffle | first1 = B.

The euro introduction in 2002, with its various exchange rates, distorted existing nominal price patterns while at the same time retaining real prices. A European wide study (el Sehity, Hoelzl and Kirchler, 2005) investigated consumer price digits before and after the euro introduction for price adjustments. The research showed a clear trend towards psychological pricing after the transition. Further, [[Benford's Law]] as a benchmark for the investigation of price digits was successfully introduced into the context of pricing. The importance of this benchmark for detecting irregularities in prices was demonstrated and with it a clear trend towards psychological pricing after the nominal shock of the euro introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = El Sehity | first1 = T. | last2 = Hoelzl | first2 = E. | last3 = Kirchler | first3 = E. | year = 2005 | title = Price developments after a nominal shock: Benford's Law and psychological pricing after the euro introduction | url = | journal = International Journal of Research in Marketing | volume = 22 | issue = 4| pages = 471–480 | doi=10.1016/j.ijresmar.2005.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another phenomenon noted by economists is that a [[price point]] for a product (such as $4.99) remains stable for a long period of time, with companies slowly reducing the ''quantity'' of product in the package until consumers begin to notice. At this time, the price will increase marginally (to $5.05) and then within an exceptionally short time will increase to the next price point ($5.99, for example).&lt;ref&gt;[[Choice magazine]], January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Research has also found psychological pricing relevant for the study of politics and public policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ashworth | first1 = J. | last2 = Heyndels | first2 = B. | last3 = Smolders | first3 = C. | year = 2003 | title = Psychological taxing in Flemish municipalities | journal = Journal of Economic Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 6| pages = 741–762 | doi=10.1016/j.joep.2003.06.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a study of Danish municipal income taxes found evidence of "odd taxation" as tax rates with a nine-ending were found to be over-represented compared to other end-decimals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Olsen | first1 = A. L. | year = 2013 | title = The politics of digits: evidence of odd taxation | url = | journal = Public Choice | volume = 154 | issue = 1–2| pages = 59–73 | doi = 10.1007/s11127-011-9807-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies have shown that when prices are presented to a prospect in descending order (versus ascending order) positive effects result, mainly a willingness to pay a higher price, higher perceptions of value, and higher probability of purchase. The reason for this is that when presented in the former, the higher price serves as a reference point, and the lower prices are perceived favorably as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, P., Brennan, M., Kearns, Z. (2003). Psychological aspects of price: An empirical test of order and range effects. ''Marketing Bulletin'' 2003; (14), Research note 1. pp. 1-2.  [http://marketing-bulletin.massey.ac.nz/V14/MB_V14_N1_Bennett.pdf PDF] {{ISSN|1176-645X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical comments==
Exactly how psychological pricing came into common use is not clear, though it is known the practice arose during the late 19th century. One source speculates it originated in a [[newspaper]] pricing competition. [[Melville E. Stone]] founded the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]'' in 1875, intending to price it at one cent to compete with the [[nickel (U.S. coin)|nickel]] papers of the day. The story claims that [[penny (U.S. coin)|pennies]] were not common currency at the time, and so Stone colluded with advertisers to set whole dollar prices a cent lower—thus guaranteeing that customers would receive ample pennies in change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Cecil|authorlink1=Cecil Adams|title=Why do prices end in .99?|url=http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a3_166.html|website=[[The Straight Dope]]|date=February 21, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have suggested that fractional pricing was first adopted as a control on employee theft. For cash transactions with a round price, there is a chance that a dishonest cashier will pocket the bill rather than record the sale. For cash transactions with an odd price, the cashier must make change for the customer. This generally means opening the [[cash register]] which creates a record of the sale in the register and reduces the risk of the cashier [[stealing]] from the store owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Landsburg |first=Steven E. | authorlink=Steven Landsburg |date=2012 |title=The Armchair Economist: Economics &amp; Everyday Life |edition=Rev. |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Armchair_Economist_revised_and_updat.html?id=pWS5zrF_Fz0C |location=New York |publisher=Free Press |isbn=9781451651737 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the former [[Czechoslovakia]], people called this pricing "baťovská cena" ("Baťa's price"), referring to [[Tomáš Baťa#Ba.C5.A5a.27s leadership for quality and innovation|Tomáš Baťa]], a Czech manufacturer of footwear. He began to widely use this practice in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romanakladatelstvi.cz/clanky/clanek_2.pdf ''Social responsibility of the Bata Company''], in Czech language{{Dead link|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Price ending has also been used by retailers to highlight sale or clearance items for administrative purposes. A retailer might end all regular prices in 95 and all sale price in 50. This makes it easy for a buyer to identify which items are discounted when looking at a report.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In its [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 United Kingdom general election]] manifesto, the [[Official Monster Raving Loony Party]] proposed the introduction of a 99-pence coin to "save on change".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.loonyparty.com/index.php?page=2005-general-election-manifesto|title=The Official Monster Raving Loony Party|website=The Official Monster Raving Loony Party|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sonne|first1=Paul|last2=MacDonald|first2=Alistair|title=In the Longest-Running Joke in Politics, Life Imitates Farce|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703322204575225864160523470|work=Wall Street Journal|date=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent trend in some monetary systems is to eliminate the smallest denomination coin (typically 0.01 of the local currency). The total cost of purchased items is then rounded up or down to, for example, the [[Swedish rounding|nearest 0.05]]. This may have an effect on future "odd-number" pricing to maximize the rounding advantage for vendors by favoring 98 and 99 endings (rounded up) over 96 and 97 ending (rounded down) especially at small retail outlets where single item purchases are more common. [[Australia]] is a good example of this practice where [[Australian 5 cent coin|5 cents]] has been the smallest denomination coin since 1992, but pricing at .98 or .99 on items under several hundred dollars is still almost universally applied (e.g.: $1.99&amp;nbsp;– $299.99) while goods on sale often price at .94 and its variations. It is also the case in [[Finland]] and The Netherlands, the first two countries using the euro currency to eliminate the 1 and 2 cent coins.

In [[philosophy]], a '''quality''' is an attribute or a [[Property (philosophy)|property]] characteristic of an [[Object (philosophy)|object]].&lt;ref name="Cargile, 1995"&gt;Cargile, J. (1995). qualities. in Honderich, T. (Ed.) (2005). ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'' (2nd ed.). Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; In [[contemporary philosophy]] the [[idea]] of qualities, and especially how to distinguish certain kinds of qualities from one another, remains controversial.&lt;ref name="Cargile, 1995"/&gt;

==Background==
{{further|Property (philosophy)}}
[[Aristotle]] analyzed qualities in his [[logic]]al work, the [[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]. To him, qualities are [[hylomorphic]]ally–formal attributes, such as "white" or "grammatical". Categories of ''state'', such as "shod" and "armed" are also non–[[essential property|essential]] qualities ''([[sumbebekos|katà symbebekós]])''.&lt;ref name="MIT_Cat_70"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/categories.1.1.html#70 |author=Edghill, E.M. trans. |title=The Internet Classics Archive – Aristotle ''Categories'' |publisher=MIT |year=2009}} line 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle observed: "one and the selfsame substance, while retaining its identity, is yet capable of admitting contrary qualities. The same individual person is at one time white, at another black, at one time warm, at another cold, at one time good, at another bad. This capacity is found nowhere else... it is the peculiar mark of substance that it should be capable of admitting contrary qualities; for it is by itself changing that it does so".&lt;ref name="MIT_Cat_254"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/categories.1.1.html#254 |author=Edghill, E.M. trans. |title=The Internet Classics Archive – Aristotle ''Categories'' |publisher=MIT |year=2009}} line 254.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle described four types of qualitative opposites: ''correlatives,'' ''contraries,'' ''privatives'' and ''positives.''&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/categories.3.3.html#254 |author=Edghill, E.M. trans. |title=The Internet Classics Archive – Aristotle ''Categories'' |publisher=MIT |year=2009}} line 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Locke]] presented a distinction between primary and secondary qualities in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''. For Locke, a quality is an [[idea]] of a [[sensation (psychology)|sensation]] or a [[perception]]. Locke further asserts that qualities can be divided in two kinds: primary and secondary qualities. [[Primary qualities]] are [[intrinsic]] to an object—a thing or a person—whereas [[secondary qualities]] are dependent on the interpretation of the subjective mode and the context of appearance.&lt;ref name="Cargile, 1995"/&gt; For example, a [[shadow]] is a secondary quality. It requires a certain [[light]]ing to be applied to an object. For another example, consider the [[mass]] of an object. [[Weight]] is a secondary quality since, as a [[measurement]] of gravitational [[force]], it varies depending on the [[distance]] to, and mass of, very massive objects like the [[Earth]], as described by [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newton's law]]. It could be thought that mass is intrinsic to an object, and thus a primary quality. In the context of [[Theory of relativity|relativity]], the idea of mass quantifying an amount of [[matter#Relativity|matter]] requires caution. The [[relativistic mass]] varies for variously traveling observers; then there is the idea of rest mass or [[invariant mass]] (the magnitude of the [[Four-momentum|energy-momentum 4-vector]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Edwin F. Taylor|Taylor, Edwin F.]] and [[John Archibald Wheeler|Wheeler, John Archibald]], ''Spacetime Physics'', 2nd edition, 1991, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;), basically a system's relativistic mass in its own [[rest frame]] of reference. (Note, however, that Aristotle drew a distinction between qualification and quantification; a thing's quality can vary in degree).&lt;ref name="studman 2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-categories/#Quality |author=Studtmann,P. |year=2007 |title=Aristotle's Categories |editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=E.N. |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |location=Stanford |quote=[Regarding] ''Habits and Dispositions; Natural Capabilities and Incapabilities; Affective Qualities and Affections;'' and ''Shapes;'' [...] Ackrill finds Aristotle's division of quality at best unmotivated.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only an [[isolated system]]'s invariant [[Mass in general relativity|mass in relativity]] is the same as observed in variously traveling observers' rest frames, and [[Conserved quantity|conserved]] in reactions; moreover, a system's heat, including the energy of its massless particles such as photons, contributes to the system's invariant mass (indeed, otherwise even an isolated system's invariant mass would not be conserved in reactions); even a cloud of photons traveling in different directions has, as a whole, a rest frame and a rest energy equivalent to invariant mass.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edwin F. Taylor|Taylor, Edwin F.]] and [[John Archibald Wheeler|Wheeler, John Archibald]], ''Spacetime Physics'', 2nd edition, 1991, pp. 226-227 and 232-233.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, to treat rest mass (and by that stroke, rest energy) as an intrinsic quality distinctive of physical matter raises the question of what is to count as physical matter. Little of the invariant mass of a [[hadron]] (for example a [[proton]] or a [[neutron]]) consists in the invariant masses of its component [[quark]]s (in a proton, around 1%) apart from their [[gluon]] [[Quantum field theory|particle field]]s; most of it consists in the [[quantum chromodynamics binding energy]] of the (massless) gluons (see [[Quark#Mass]]).

==Conceptions of quality as metaphysical and ontological==
{{main article|Qualia}}
[[Philosophy]] and [[common sense]] tend to see qualities as [[relate]]d either to [[Subjectivity|subjective]] [[feeling]]s or to [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] [[fact]]s. The qualities of something depends on the criteria being applied to and, from a [[neutrality (philosophy)|neutral point of view]], do not determine its value (the [[philosophical value]] as well as [[economic value]]). Subjectively, something might be [[form of the good|good]] because it is [[utility|useful]], because it is [[Beauty|beautiful]], or simply because it [[existence|exists]]. Determining or finding qualities therefore involves [[understanding]] what is useful, what is beautiful and what exists. Commonly, ''quality'' can mean degree of [[excellence]], as in, "a quality product" or "work of average quality". It can also refer to a property of something such as "the [[addictive]] quality of [[nicotine]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''[[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]]'', [[Robert M. Pirsig]] examines concepts of quality in [[classicism|classical]] and [[Romanticism|romantic]], seeking a [[Metaphysics of Quality]] and a reconciliation of those views in terms of [[non-dualism|non-dualistic]] [[holism]].

The '''Rashomon effect''' occurs when the same event is given contradictory interpretations by different individuals involved. The effect is named after [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s 1950 film ''[[Rashomon]]'', in which a murder is described in four mutually contradictory ways by its four witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davenport|first=Christian|title=Media Bias, Perspective, and State Repression: The Black Panther Party | year=2010 | location = Cambridge, UK | publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=9780521759700 | pages=52–73, esp. 55 | chapter=Rashomon Effect, Observation, and Data Generation}}&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, the term addresses the motivations, mechanism, and occurrences of the reporting on the circumstance, and so addresses contested interpretations of events, the existence of disagreements regarding the evidence of events, and the subjects of subjectivity versus objectivity in human perception, memory, and reporting.

The Rashomon effect has been defined in a modern academic context (from Robert Anderson, in 2016), as "the naming of an [[Epistemology|epistemological]] framework—or ways of thinking, knowing, and remembering—required for understanding complex and ambiguous situations."&lt;ref name = AndersonCJC2016&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Robert|date=2016|title=The Rashomon Effect and Communication|url=|journal=Canadian Journal of Communication|location=Vancouver Canada|issue=41(2)|pages=250–265|doi=|issn=0705-3657|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term for the effect is derived from the eponymous film, Kurosawa's ''Rashomon,'' in which a number of factors are at play, simultaneously, leading the same academic to comment:{{quote|[T]he Rashomon effect is not only about differences in perspective. It occurs particularly where such differences arise in combination with the absence of evidence to elevate or disqualify any version of the truth, plus the social pressure for closure on the question.&lt;ref name = AndersonCJC2016/&gt;}}

==History==
There are varying claims made regarding the coining of this term, but a reliable statement of the earliest use of the term "Rashomon effect" comes from 2015 testimony of Robert Anderson, professor of communication at [[Simon Fraser University]] in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada, who states that,{{quote|

My own understanding of its origins arises much earlier, upon hearing my respected teacher, [[Nur Yalman]] [as of 2016, an emeritus professor at [[Harvard University]]], say to us in a class in early 1966 at the University of Chicago that 'anthropology's main problem is to deal with the Rashomon effect'. Unlike some graduate students in that room in Chicago, I had seen [[Rashomon|the film [''Rashomon'']]] in 1961 or 1962, so this remark crystalized something… in my memory… I suspect the Rashomon effect has shown up in many historic intellectual undertakings that deal with the contested interpretation of events or with disagreements and evidence for them, or with subjectivity/objectivity, memory and perception. A pertinent example is the long poem called ''The Ring and the Book'' by Robert Browning… published in 1868-9…&lt;ref name = AndersonDAWroutledge15&gt;{{cite book | author = Anderson, Robert | year = 2015 | chapter = What is the Rashomon Effect?

'''Social stratification''' is a kind of [[social differentiation]] whereby a society groups people into [[Socioeconomic status|socioeconomic]] strata,  based upon their [[Job|occupation]] and [[income]], [[wealth]] and [[social status]], or derived [[Power (social and political)|power]] (social and political). As such, stratification is the relative social position of persons within a social group, category, geographic region, or [[social unit]].

In modern [[Western culture|Western societies]], social stratification typically is distinguished as three [[social class]]es: (i) the [[upper class]], (ii) the [[middle class]], and (iii) the [[Working class|lower class]]; in turn, each class can be subdivided into strata, e.g. the upper-stratum, the middle-stratum, and the lower stratum.&lt;ref name="Saunders1990"&gt;{{cite book | author-link=Peter Robert Saunders | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FK-004p0J_EC | title=Social Class and Stratification | publisher=Routledge | last=Saunders | first=Peter | year=1990 | isbn=978-0-415-04125-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, a social stratum can be formed upon the bases of [[kinship]], [[clan]], [[tribe]] or [[caste]], or all four.

The categorization of people by social strata occurs in all societies, ranging from the complex, [[State (polity)|state-based]] or [[Polycentric law|polycentric]] societies to [[tribal]] and [[feudal]] societies, which are based upon socio-economic relations among classes of [[nobility]] and classes of [[peasant]]s. Historically, whether or not [[hunter-gatherer]] societies can be defined as socially stratified or if social stratification began with [[agriculture]] and common acts of [[Social exchange theory|social exchange]], remains a debated matter in the [[social sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://worldhistoryconnected.press.illinois.edu/1.2/toye.html | title=The Emergence of Complex Societies: A Comparative Approach | author=Toye, David L. | journal=World History Connected |date=May 2004  | volume=11 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Determining the structures of social stratification arises from inequalities of status among persons, therefore, the degree of [[social inequality]] determines a person's social stratum.

==Overview==

===Definition and usage===

Social stratification is a term used in the social sciences to describe the relative social position of persons in a given [[social group]], [[categorization|category]], geographical region or other [[social unit]]. It derives from the [[Latin]] ''strātum'' (plural ''strata''; parallel, horizontal layers) referring to a given society’s categorization of its people into rankings of [[Socioeconomic status|socioeconomic]] tiers based on factors like [[wealth]], [[income]], [[social status]], [[job|occupation]] and [[Power (social and political)|power]]. In modern [[Western culture|Western societies]], stratification is often broadly classified into three major divisions of [[social class]]: [[upper class]], [[middle class]], and [[Working class|lower class]]. Each of these classes can be further subdivided into smaller classes (e.g. "upper middle").&lt;ref name="Saunders1990" /&gt; Social strata may also be delineated on the basis of [[kinship|kinship ties]] or [[caste]] relations.

The concept of social stratification is often used and interpreted differently within specific theories. In [[sociology]], for example, proponents of [[Action theory (sociology)|action theory]] have suggested that social stratification is commonly found in [[Development theory|developed]] societies, wherein a [[dominance hierarchy]] may be necessary in order to maintain [[social order]] and provide a stable [[social structure]]. So-called [[Conflict theory|conflict theories]], such as [[Marxism]], point to the inaccessibility of resources and lack of [[social mobility]] found in stratified societies. Many sociological theorists have criticized the extent to which the [[working classes]] are unlikely to advance socioeconomically while the [[Wealth#The upper class|wealthy]] tend to hold political power which they use to [[Exploitation of labour|exploit]] the [[proletariat]] (laboring class). [[Talcott Parsons]], an American sociologist, asserted that stability and social order are regulated, in part, by [[universal value]]s.  Such values are not identical with "consensus" but can as well be an impetus for ardent social conflict as it has been multiple times through history. Parsons never claimed that universal values, in and by themselves, "satisfied" the [[functional prerequisites]] of a society.  Indeed, the constitution of society is a much more complicated codification of emerging historical factors. Theorists such as [[Ralf Dahrendorf]] alternately note the tendency toward an enlarged middle-class in modern Western societies due to the necessity of an educated workforce in technological economies. Various social and political perspectives concerning [[globalization]], such as [[dependency theory]], suggest that these effects are due to change in the status of workers to the [[third world]].

===Four underlying principles===
Four principles are posited to underlie social stratification.  First, social stratification is socially defined as a property of a society rather than individuals in that society. Second, social stratification is reproduced from generation to generation. Third, social stratification is universal (found in every society) but variable (differs across time and place).  Fourth, social stratification involves not just quantitative [[economic inequality|inequality]] but qualitative beliefs and attitudes about social status.&lt;ref name="Grusky2011a" /&gt;

===Complexity===
Although stratification is not limited to complex societies, all complex societies exhibit features of stratification.  In any complex society, the total stock of valued goods is distributed unequally, wherein the most [[Privilege (social inequality)|privileged]] individuals and families enjoy a disproportionate share of [[income]], [[Power (social and political)|power]], and other [[Value theory|valued]] resources. The term "stratification system" is sometimes used to refer to the complex [[social relationship]]s and [[social structure]] that generate these observed inequalities. The key components of such systems are: (a) [[Social institution|social-institutional]] processes that define certain types of goods as valuable and desirable, (b) the [[Social contract|rules]] of allocation that distribute goods and resources across various positions in the [[division of labor]] (e.g., physician, farmer, ‘housewife’), and (c) the [[social mobility]] processes that link individuals to positions and thereby generate unequal control over valued resources.&lt;ref name="Grusky1992"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Social Stratification | encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Sociology | publisher=Macmillan Publishing Company. |author1=Grusky, David B.  |author2=Ann Azumi Takata  |lastauthoramp=yes | year=1992 | pages=1955–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social mobility===
Social mobility is the movement of individuals, social groups or categories of people between the layers or strata in a stratification system.  This movement can be intragenerational (within a generation) or intergenerational (between two or more generations).  Such mobility is sometimes used to classify different systems of social stratification.  [[Open system (systems theory)|Open]] stratification systems are those that allow for mobility between strata, typically by placing value on the [[achieved status]] characteristics of individuals.  Those societies having the highest levels of intragenerational mobility are considered to be the most open and malleable systems of stratification.&lt;ref name="Grusky2011a" /&gt;  Those systems in which there is little to no mobility, even on an intergenerational basis, are considered closed stratification systems. For example, in caste systems, all aspects of social status are [[Ascribed status|ascribed]], such that one's social position at birth is the position one holds for a lifetime.&lt;ref name="Grusky1992" /&gt;

==Theories of stratification==

===Historical===

====Karl Marx====
{{Main|Marxism|Historical materialism|Base and superstructure}}
[[File:Pyramid of Capitalist System.jpg|thumbnail|The 1911 "[[Pyramid of Capitalist System]]" cartoon is an example of socialist [[critique of capitalism]] and of social stratification]]
In Marxist theory, the modern [[mode of production]] consists of two main economic parts: the base and the superstructure. The base encompasses the [[relations of production]]: employer–employee work conditions, the technical [[division of labour]], and property relations. Social class, according to Marx, is determined by one's relationship to the means of production.  There exist at least two classes in any class-based society: the owners of the means of production and those who sell their labor to the owners of the means of production.  At times, Marx almost hints that the ruling classes seem to own the working class itself as they only have their own [[labor power]] ('[[wage labor]]') to offer the more powerful in order to survive. These relations fundamentally determine the ideas and philosophies of a society and additional classes may form as part of the superstructure. Through the ideology of the ruling class—throughout much of history, the land-owning [[aristocracy]]—[[false consciousness]] is promoted both through political and non-political institutions but also through the [[arts]] and other elements of [[culture]]. When the aristocracy falls,  the [[bourgeoisie]] become the owners of the means of production in the capitalist system. Marx predicted the [[capitalist]] mode would eventually give way, through its own internal conflict, to revolutionary consciousness and the development of more egalitarian, more [[communist]] societies.

Marx also described two other classes, the petite [[bourgeoisie]] and the [[lumpenproletariat]]. The petite bourgeoisie is like a small business class that never really accumulates enough profit to become part of the bourgeoisie, or even challenge their status. The lumpenproletariat is the [[underclass]], those with little to no social status. This includes prostitutes, beggars, the [[Homelessness|homeless]] or other [[Untouchability|untouchables]] in a given society. Neither of these subclasses has much influence in Marx's two major classes, but it is helpful to know that Marx did recognize differences within the classes.&lt;ref&gt;Doob, Christopher. ''Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society'' (1st ed.), Pearson Education, 2012, {{ISBN|0-205-79241-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Marvin Harris]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Harris | first=Marvin | author-link=Marvin Harris | year=1967 | title=The Rise of Anthropological Theory: A History of Theories of Culture | publisher=Routledge | isbn=0-7591-0133-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TlgVAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tim Ingold]],&lt;ref name="Ingold, Tim 2006 p. 400"&gt;Ingold, Tim (2006) "On the social relations of the hunter-gatherer band," in [[Richard Borshay Lee|Richard B. Lee]] and Richard H. Daly (eds.), ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Hunters and Gatherers,'' p. 400. New York: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-60919-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]'s accounts of egalitarian hunter-gatherers formed part of Karl Marx' and [[Friedrich Engels]]' inspiration for [[communism]]. Morgan spoke of a situation in which people living in the same community pooled their efforts and shared the rewards of those efforts fairly equally. He called this "communism in living." But when Marx expanded on these ideas, he still emphasized an economically oriented culture, with [[property]] defining the fundamental relationships between people.&lt;ref&gt;Barnard, Alan (2006) "Images of hunters and gatherers in European social thought," in [[Richard Borshay Lee|Richard B. Lee]] and Richard H. Daly (eds.), ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Hunters and Gatherers,'' p. 379. New York: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-60919-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, issues of [[ownership]] and property are arguably less emphasized in hunter-gatherer societies.&lt;ref name="Gowdy2006"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | isbn=0-521-60919-4 | title=Hunter-gatherers and the mythology of the market | encyclopedia=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Hunters and Gatherers | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Gowdy, John | editor=Lee, Richard B. and Richard H. Daly | year=2006 | pages=391–393}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, combined with the very different social and economic situations of hunter-gatherers may account for many of the difficulties encountered when implementing communism in industrialized states. As Ingold points out: "The notion of communism, removed from the context of domesticity and harnessed to support a project of social engineering for large-scale, industrialized states with populations of millions, eventually came to mean something quite different from what Morgan had intended: namely, a principle of redistribution that would override all ties of a personal or familial nature, and cancel out their effects."&lt;ref name="Ingold, Tim 2006 p. 400"/&gt;

The counter-argument to Marxist's conflict theory is the theory of structural functionalism, argued by [[Kingsley Davis]] and [[Wilbert E. Moore|Wilbert Moore]], which states that social inequality places a vital role in the smooth operation of a society. The [[Davis–Moore hypothesis]] argues that a position does not bring power and prestige because it draws a high income; rather, it draws a high income because it is functionally important and the available personnel is for one reason or another scarce. Most high-income jobs are difficult and require a high level of education to perform, and their compensation is a motivator in society for people to strive to achieve more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Some Principles of Stratification|jstor = 2085643|journal = American Sociological Review|date = 1945-04-01|pages = 242–249|volume = 10|issue = 2|doi = 10.2307/2085643|first = Kingsley|last = Davis|first2 = Wilbert E.|last2 = Moore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Max Weber====
{{Main|Three-component theory of stratification|Tripartite classification of authority}}
[[Max Weber]] was strongly influenced by Marx's ideas but rejected the possibility of effective communism, arguing that it would require an even greater level of detrimental social control and bureaucratization than capitalist society. Moreover, Weber criticized the [[dialectical]] presumption of a proletariat revolt, maintaining it to be unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;Holborn, M. &amp; Langley, P. (2004) AS &amp; A level Student Handbook, accompanies the Sixth Edition: Haralambos &amp; Holborn, ''Sociology: Themes and perspectives,'' London: Collins Educational&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he develops a [[three-component theory of stratification]] and the concept of [[life chances]]. Weber held there are more class divisions than Marx suggested, taking different concepts from both [[Structural functionalism|functionalist]] and [[Marxist]] theories to create his own system. He emphasizes the difference between class, status and power, and treats these as separate but related sources of power, each with different effects on [[social action]]. Working half a century later than Marx, Weber claims there to be four main social classes: the [[upper class]], the [[white collar workers]], the [[petite bourgeoisie]], and the manual [[working class]]. Weber's theory more-closely resembles contemporary [[Western culture|Western]] class structures, although economic status does not currently seem to depend strictly on earnings in the way Weber envisioned.

Weber derives many of his key concepts on social stratification by examining the social structure of [[Germany]]. He notes that, contrary to Marx's theories, stratification is based on more than simple ownership of [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. Weber examines how many members of the aristocracy lacked economic wealth yet had strong political power. Many wealthy families lacked prestige and power, for example, because they were [[Jewish]]. Weber introduced three independent factors that form his theory of stratification hierarchy, which are; class, status, and power:
* '''Class''': A person's economic position in a society, based on birth and individual achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macionis, Gerber|first=John, Linda|title=Sociology 7th Canadian Ed|year=2010|publisher=Pearson Canada Inc.|location=Toronto, Ontario|page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weber differs from Marx in that he does not see this as the supreme factor in stratification. Weber notes how corporate executives control firms they typically do not own; Marx would have placed these people in the [[proletariat]] despite their high incomes by virtue of the fact they sell their labor instead of owning capital.
* '''Status''': A person's prestige, social honor, or popularity in a society. Weber notes that political power is not rooted in capital value solely, but also in one's individual status. Poets or saints, for example, can have extensive influence on society despite few material resources.
* '''Power''': A person's ability to get their way despite the resistance of others, particularly in their ability to engage [[social change]]. For example, individuals in government jobs, such as an employee of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], or a member of the [[United States Congress]], may hold little property or status but still wield considerable [[Power (social and political)|social power]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

====C. Wright Mills====
{{Main|Elite theory}}

[[C. Wright Mills]], drawing from the theories of [[Vilfredo Pareto]] and [[Gaetano Mosca]], contends that the imbalance of power in society derives from the complete absence of countervailing powers against corporate leaders of the [[Power elite]].&lt;ref name="Doob"&gt;{{cite book | title=Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society | publisher=Pearson Education Inc. | last=Doob | first=Christopher | year=2013 | location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey | page=38 | isbn=978-0-205-79241-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mills1956"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Power Elite | publisher=Oxford University Press | last=Mills | first=Charles W. | year=1956 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mills both incorporated and revised [[Marxism|Marxist]] ideas. While he shared [[Karl Marx|Marx's]] recognition of a dominant wealthy and powerful class, [[C. Wright Mills|Mills]] believed that the source for that power lay not only in the economic realm but also in the political and military arenas.&lt;ref name="Doob" /&gt; During the 1950s, Mills stated that hardly anyone knew about the power elite's existence, some individuals (including the elite themselves) denied the idea of such a group, and other people vaguely believed that a small formation of a powerful elite existed.&lt;ref name="Doob" /&gt; "Some prominent individuals knew that [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] had permitted a handful of political leaders to make critical decisions about peace and war; and that two [[atomic bomb]]s had been dropped on Japan in the name of the United States, but neither they nor anyone they knew had been consulted."&lt;ref name="Doob" /&gt;

[[C. Wright Mills|Mills]] explains that the power elite embody a privileged class whose members are able to recognize their high position within society.&lt;ref name="Doob" /&gt; In order to maintain their highly exalted position within society, members of the power elite tend to marry one another, understand and accept one another, and also work together.&lt;ref name="Doob" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mills1956" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[pp.&amp;nbsp;4–5]&lt;/sup&gt;  The most crucial aspect of the power elite's existence lays within the core of education.&lt;ref name="Doob" /&gt; "Youthful upper-class members attend prominent preparatory schools, which not only open doors to such elite universities as [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Yale University|Yale]], and [[Princeton University|Princeton]] but also to the universities' highly exclusive clubs. These memberships in turn pave the way to the prominent social clubs located in all major cities and serving as sites for important business contacts."&lt;ref name="Doob" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mills1956" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[p.&amp;nbsp;63–67]&lt;/sup&gt; Examples of elite members who attended prestigious universities and were members of highly exclusive clubs can be seen in [[George W. Bush]] and [[John Kerry]]. Both Bush and Kerry were members of the [[Skull and Bones]] club while attending Yale University.&lt;ref name="Leung"&gt;{{cite news|last=Leung|first=Rebecca|title=Skull and Bones|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18560_162-576332.html|work=[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]] ([[CBS]]) (accessed 12/03/2012)}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This club includes members of some of the most powerful men of the twentieth century, all of which are forbidden to tell others about the secrets of their exclusive club. Throughout the years, the Skull and Bones club has included [[Presidents of the United States|presidents]], cabinet officers, Supreme Court justices, spies, captains of industry, and often their sons and daughters join the exclusive club, creating a social and political network like none ever seen before.&lt;ref name="Leung"/&gt;

The upper class individuals who receive elite educations typically have the essential background and contacts to enter into the three branches of the power elite: The political leadership, the military circle, and the corporate elite.&lt;ref name="Doob" /&gt;

*'''The Political Leadership:''' Mills held that, prior to the end of [[World War II]], leaders of corporations became more prominent within the political sphere along with a decline in central decision-making among professional politicians.&lt;ref name="Doob" /&gt;
*'''The Military Circle:''' During the 1950s-1960s, increasing concerns about [[warfare]] resulted in top military leaders and issues involving defense funding and military personnel training becoming a top priority within the United States. Most of the prominent politicians and corporate leaders have been strong proponents of military spending.
*'''The Corporate Elite:''' Mills explains that during the 1950s, when the military emphasis was recognized, corporate leaders worked with prominent military officers who dominated the development of policies. Corporate leaders and high-ranking military officers were mutually supportive of each other.&lt;ref name="Doob" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mills1956" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[pp.&amp;nbsp;274–276]&lt;/sup&gt;

Mills shows that the power elite has an "inner-core" made up of individuals who are able to move from one position of institutional power to another; for example, a prominent military officer who becomes a political adviser or a powerful politician who becomes a corporate executive.&lt;ref name="Doob" /&gt; "These people have more knowledge and a greater breadth of interests than their colleagues. Prominent bankers and financiers, who Mills considered 'almost professional go-betweens of economic, political, and military affairs,' are also members of the elite's inner core.&lt;ref name="Doob" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mills1956" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[pp. 288–289]&lt;/sup&gt;

===Anthropological theories===
{{Anthropology of kinship}}
Some [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] dispute the "universal" nature of social stratification, holding that it is not the standard among all societies. John Gowdy (2006) writes, "Assumptions about human behaviour that members of market societies believe to be universal, that humans are naturally competitive and acquisitive, and that social stratification is natural, do not apply to many hunter-gatherer peoples.&lt;ref name="Gowdy2006" /&gt; Non-stratified [[egalitarian]] or [[Acephalous Society|acephalous]] ("headless") societies exist which have little or no concept of social hierarchy, political or economic status, class, or even permanent leadership.

===Kinship-orientation===
{{See also|Original affluent society}}

Anthropologists identify egalitarian cultures as "[[kinship]]-oriented," because they appear to value social harmony more than wealth or status. These cultures are contrasted with economically oriented cultures (including [[State (polity)|states]]) in which status and material wealth are prized, and stratification, competition, and conflict are common. Kinship-oriented cultures actively work to prevent social hierarchies from developing because they believe that such stratification could lead to conflict and instability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Gender and Rural Development | publisher=LIT Verlag Münster | author=Deji, Olanike F. | year=2011 | location=London | page=93 | isbn=978-3643901033}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reciprocal altruism]] is one process by which this is accomplished.

A good example is given by [[Richard Borshay Lee]] in his account of the [[Khoisan]], who practice ''"insulting the meat."'' Whenever a hunter makes a kill, he is ceaselessly teased and ridiculed (in a friendly, joking fashion) to prevent him from becoming too proud or egotistical. The meat itself is then distributed evenly among the entire social group, rather than kept by the hunter. The level of teasing is proportional to the size of the kill. Lee found this out when he purchased an entire cow as a gift for the group he was living with, and was teased for weeks afterward about it (since obtaining that much meat could be interpreted as showing off).&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Richard B. (1976), ''Kalahari Hunter-Gatherers: Studies of the !Kung San and Their Neighbors,'' Richard B. Lee and Irven DeVore, eds. Cambridge: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the [[Indigenous Australians]] of [[Groote Eylandt]] and [[Bickerton Island]], off the coast of [[Arnhem Land]], who have arranged their entire society—spiritually and economically—around a kind of [[gift economy]] called ''[[Reciprocal altruism|renunciation]].'' According to [[David H. Turner]], in this arrangement, every person is expected to give ''everything'' of any resource they have to any other person who needs or lacks it at the time. This has the benefit of largely eliminating social problems like theft and relative poverty. However, misunderstandings obviously arise when attempting to reconcile Aboriginal ''renunciative economics'' with the competition/scarcity-oriented [[economics]] introduced to Australia by Anglo-European colonists.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, David H. (1999), ''Genesis Regained: Aboriginal Forms of Renunciation in Judeo-Christian Scriptures and Other Major Traditions,'' pp. 1-9, Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variables in theory and research==

The social status variables underlying social stratification are based in social perceptions and [[Social attitude|attitudes]] about various characteristics of persons and peoples. While many such variables cut across time and place, the relative [[Statistical weight|weight]] placed on each variable and specific combinations of these variables will differ from place to place over time.  One task of research is to identify accurate [[mathematical model]]s that explain how these many variables combine to produce stratification in a given society. Grusky (2011) provides a good overview of the historical development of sociological theories of social stratification and a summary of contemporary theories and research in this field.&lt;ref name="Grusky2011b"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/scspi/grusky/article_files/past_present_future_social_inequality.pdf | title="The Past, Present and Future of Social Inequality." In Social Stratification: Class, Race, and Gender in Sociological Perspective (Second Edition) | publisher=Westview Press | author=Grusky, David B | year=2011 | location=Boulder | pages=3–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many of the variables that contribute to an understanding of social stratification have long been identified, models of these variables and their role in constituting social stratification are still an active topic of theory and research.  In general, sociologists recognize that there are no "pure" economic variables, as social factors are integral to economic value. However, the variables posited to affect social stratification can be loosely divided into economic and other social factors.

===Economic===
{{Main|Economic inequality}}

Strictly [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] economic variables are more useful to [[Descriptive statistics|describing]] social stratification than [[Explanatory power|explaining]] how social stratification is constituted or maintained.  [[Income]] is the most common variable used to describe stratification and associated [[economic inequality]] in a society.&lt;ref name="Grusky1992" /&gt; However, the distribution of individual or [[household]] accumulation of [[excess supply|surplus]] and [[wealth]] tells us more about variation in individual [[well-being]] than does income, alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Who Rules America? The Triumph of the Corporate Rich | publisher=McGraw-Hill | author=Domhoff, G. William | year=2013 | page=288 | isbn=978-0078026713}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wealth variables can also more vividly illustrate salient variations in the well-being of groups in stratified societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Perry-Rivers, P. |date=October 2014  | title = Stratification, Economic Adversity, and Entrepreneurial Launch: The Converse Effect of Resource Position on Entrepreneurial Strategy | journal = Entrepreneurship Theory &amp; Practice |volume=40  |issue=3  |pages=685  | doi=10.1111/etap.12137}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP), especially ''per capita'' GDP, is sometimes used to describe economic inequality and stratification at the [[International inequality|international]] or global level.

===Social===
{{Main|Social status}}

Social variables, both quantitative and [[qualitative research|qualitative]], typically provide the most explanatory power in [[Causality|causal]] research regarding social stratification, either as [[Independent variable#Independent variable|independent]] variables or as [[intervening variable]]s. Three important social variables include [[gender roles|gender]], [[Race (human classification)|race]], and [[ethnicity]], which, at the least, have an intervening effect on social status and stratification in most places throughout the world.&lt;ref name="Hill1998"&gt;{{cite book | title="Toward a new vision: race, class and gender as categories of analysis and connection" in Social Class and Stratification: Classic Statements and Theoretical Debates | publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield | author=Collins, Patricia Hill | year=1998 | location=Boston | pages=231–247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional variables include those that describe other ascribed and achieved characteristics such as [[Job (role)|occupation]] and [[skill]] levels, [[Ageing|age]], [[education]] level, education level of parents, and [[Geography|geographic]] area. Some of these variables may have both causal and intervening effects on social status and stratification.  For example, absolute age may cause a low income if one is too young or too old to perform productive work.  The social perception of age and its role in the workplace, which may lead to [[ageism]], typically has an intervening effect on [[employment]] and income.

Social scientists are sometimes interested in quantifying the degree of economic stratification between different social categories, such as men and women, or workers with different levels of education. An index of stratification has been recently proposed by Zhou for this purpose.&lt;ref name="Zhou2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhou|first1=Xiang|title=A Nonparametric Index of Stratification|journal=Sociological Methodology|date=2012|volume=42|issue=1|pages=365–389|doi=10.1177/0081175012452207|url=http://smx.sagepub.com/content/42/1/365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gender====
{{Main|Gender inequality}}

Gender is one of the most pervasive and prevalent social characteristics which people use to make social distinctions between individuals. Gender distinctions are found in economic-, kinship- and caste-based stratification systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Issues of Gender | publisher=Pearson Education, Inc. |author1=Friedman, Ellen |author2=Jennifer Marshall  |lastauthoramp=yes | year= 2004 | location= New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social role]] expectations often form along sex and gender lines.  Entire societies may be classified by social scientists according to the [[rights]] and [[Privilege (social inequality)|privileges]] afforded to men or women, especially those associated with ownership and inheritance of [[property]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title= The Impact of Gender Equality in Land Rights on Development |author1=Mason, K.  |author2=H. Carlsson  |lastauthoramp=yes | booktitle= Human Rights and Development: Towards Mutual Reinforcement | year= 2004 | conference= Human Rights and Development: Towards Mutual Reinforcement | location= New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[patriarchal]] societies, such rights and privileges are [[norm (social)|normatively]] granted to men over women; in [[matriarchal]] societies, the opposite holds true.  Sex- and gender-based [[division of labor]] is historically found in the annals of most societies and such divisions increased with the advent of [[industrialization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= New Family Values: Liberty, Equality, Diversity | publisher= Rowman &amp; Littlefield | author= Struening, Karen | year= 2002 | location= New York | isbn= 978-0-7425-1231-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex-based [[wage discrimination]] exists in some societies such that men, typically, receive higher wages than women for the same type of work. Other differences in employment between men and women lead to an overall gender-based pay-gap in many societies, where women as a category earn less than men due to the types of jobs which women are offered and take, as well as to differences in the number of hours worked by women.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book | title= Patriarchy and Accumulation on a World Scale: Women in the International Division of Labour. 
| publisher= Palgrave MacMillan | author= Mies, Maria | year= 1999 | location= London
}}&lt;/ref&gt; These and other gender-related values affect the distribution of income, wealth, and property in a given social order.

====Race====
{{Main|Racism}}

Racism consists of both [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]] based in social perceptions of observable biological differences between peoples. It often takes the form of [[social actions]], practices or beliefs, or [[political system]]s in which different races are perceived to be ranked as inherently superior or inferior to each other, based on presumed shared inheritable traits, abilities, or qualities. In a given society, those who share racial characteristics socially perceived as undesirable are typically under-represented in positions of social power, i.e., they become a [[Minority group|minority category]] in that society. Minority members in such a society are often subjected to discriminatory actions resulting from majority policies, including [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]], [[Social exclusion|exclusion]], [[oppression]], [[exile|expulsion]], and [[genocide|extermination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Devising an Adequate System of Minority Protection: Individual Human Rights, Minority Rights and the Right to Self-Determination | publisher=Springer | author=Henrard, Kristen | year=2000 | location=New York | isbn=978-9041113597}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overt racism usually feeds directly into a stratification system through its effect on social status.  For example, members associated with a particular race may be assigned a [[Slavery|slave status]], a form of oppression in which the majority refuses to grant basic [[rights]] to a minority that are granted to other members of the society.  More [[covert racism]], such as that which many scholars posit is practiced in more contemporary societies, is socially hidden and less easily detectable.  Covert racism often feeds into stratification systems as an intervening variable affecting income, educational opportunities, and housing. Both overt and covert racism can take the form of [[structural inequality]] in a society in which [[Institutional racism|racism has become institutionalized]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Social Construction of Whiteness: Racism by Intent, Racism by Consequence | author=Guess, Teresa J | journal=Critical Sociology |date=July 2006  | volume=32 | issue=4 | pages=649–673 | doi=10.1163/156916306779155199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ethnicity====
{{Main|Ethnocentricity}}

Ethnic prejudice and discrimination operate much the same as do racial prejudice and discrimination in society.  In fact, only recently have scholars begun to differentiate race and ethnicity; historically, the two were considered to be identical or closely related.  With the scientific development of [[genetics]] and the [[human genome]] as fields of study, most scholars now recognize that [[race (human classification)|race]] is socially defined on the basis of biologically determined characteristics that can be observed within a society while ethnicity is defined on the basis of [[Culture|culturally]] learned behavior. Ethnic identification can include shared cultural heritage such as [[language]] and [[dialect]], [[symbolic system]]s, [[religion]], [[mythology]] and [[cuisine]]. As with race, ethnic categories of persons may be socially defined as minority [[Ethnic groups|categories]] whose members are under-represented in positions of social power.  As such, ethnic categories of persons can be subject to the same types of majority policies. Whether ethnicity feeds into a stratification system as a direct, causal factor or as an intervening variable may depend on the level of ethnocentrism within each of the various ethnic populations in a society, the amount of conflict over scarce resources, and the relative social power held within each ethnic category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=A Theory of the Origin of Ethnic Stratification | author=Noel, Donald L. | journal=Social Problems |date=Autumn 1968  | volume=16 | issue=2 | pages=157–172 | doi=10.2307/800001 | jstor=800001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global stratification==
{{Main|World-systems theory|Dependency theory}}

The world and the pace of [[social change]] today are very different than in the time of Karl Marx, Max Weber, or even C. Wright Mills.  [[Globalization|Globalizing]] forces lead to rapid international integration arising from the interchange of [[world view]]s, products, ideas, and other aspects of culture.&lt;ref name=GCSP&gt;Al-Rodhan, R.F. Nayef and Gérard Stoudmann. (2006). [http://www.sustainablehistory.com/articles/definitions-of-globalization.pdf Definitions of Globalization: A Comprehensive Overview and a Proposed Definition.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119215401/http://www.sustainablehistory.com/articles/definitions-of-globalization.pdf |date=2012-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Albrow&gt;Albrow, Martin and Elizabeth King (eds.) (1990). ''Globalization, Knowledge and Society ''London: Sage. {{ISBN|978-0803983243}} p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Advances in [[transportation]] and [[telecommunication]]s infrastructure, including the rise of the [[telegraph]] and its posterity the [[Internet]], are major factors in globalization, generating further [[interdependence]] of economic and cultural activities.&lt;ref name=Stever_1972&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stever | first1 = H. Guyford | year = 1972 | title = Science, Systems, and Society | url = | journal = Journal of Cybernetics | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 1–3 | doi = 10.1080/01969727208542909 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like a stratified class system within a nation, looking at the [[world economy]] one can see class positions in the unequal distribution of [[capital (economics)|capital]] and other resources between nations. Rather than having separate national economies, nations are considered as participating in this world economy. The world economy manifests a global [[division of labor]] with three overarching classes: [[core countries]], [[semi-periphery countries]] and [[periphery countries]],&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel (1974). The Modern World-System I: Capitalist Agriculture and  the Origins of the European World-Economy in the Sixteenth Century. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; according to World-systems and Dependency theories. Core nations primarily own and control the major means of production in the world and perform the higher-level production tasks and provide international financial services. Periphery nations own very little of the world's [[means of production]] (even when factories are located in periphery nations) and provide low to non-skilled labor. Semiperipheral nations are midway between the core and periphery. They tend to be countries moving towards industrialization and more diversified economies.&lt;ref name=PH&gt;Paul Halsall [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/wallerstein.html Modern History Sourcebook: Summary of Wallerstein on World System Theory], August 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  Core nations receive the greatest share of surplus production, and periphery nations receive the least. Furthermore, core nations are usually able to purchase raw materials and other goods from noncore nations at low prices, while demanding higher prices for their exports to noncore nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Social Change in the Twentieth Century | publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich | author=Chirot, Daniel | year=1977 | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[global workforce]] employed through a system of [[global labor arbitrage]] ensures that companies in core countries can utilize the cheapest semi-and non-skilled labor for production.

Today we have the means to gather and analyze data from economies across the globe.  Although many societies worldwide have made great strides toward more equality between differing geographic regions, in terms of the [[standard of living]] and [[life chances]] afforded to their peoples, we still find large gaps between the wealthiest and the poorest within a nation and between the wealthiest and poorest nations of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.prb.org/Publications/Datasheets/2013/2013-world-population-data-sheet.aspx | title=2013 World Population Data Sheet | publisher=Population Research Bureau | date=2013 | accessdate=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A January 2014 [[Oxfam]] report indicates that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50% of the world's population, or about 3.5 billion people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/pressrelease/2014-01-20/rigged-rules-mean-economic-growth-increasingly-winner-takes-all-for-rich-elites Rigged rules mean economic growth increasingly "winner takes all" for rich elites all over world]. ''[[Oxfam]].'' 20 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, for 2012, the [[World Bank]] reports that 21 percent of people worldwide, around 1.5 billion, live in extreme poverty, at or below $1.25 a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/isp/publication/inequality-in-focus | title=An Overview of Global Income Inequality Trends |author1=Olinto, Pedro  |author2=Jaime Saavedra  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal=Inequalitty in Focus |date=April 2012  | volume=1 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zygmunt Bauman has provocatively observed that the rise of the rich is linked to their capacity to lead highly mobile lives: 'Mobility climbs to the rank of the uppermost among coveted values -and the freedom to move, perpetually a scarce and unequally distributed commodity, fast becomes the main stratifying factor of our late modern or postmodern time.' &lt;ref&gt;Bauman, Z. (1988) Globalization: The Human Consequences. Cambridge: Polity&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sociology of terrorism''' is an emerging field in [[sociology]] seeking to understand [[terrorism]] as a [[social phenomenon]] and how individuals as well as [[State (polity)|states]] respond to such events. It is not to be confused with [[critical terrorism studies]] which sometimes overlaps with the [[psychology of terrorism]].

==History==

===Pre-September 11 attacks===
After the [[September 11 attacks]], there has been a spike of interest in various sociological traditions related to terrorism, such as [[moral panic]], organizational response and media coverage, and [[counter-terrorism]].

The most comprehensive study into the definition of terrorism comes from a study by Weinberg, Pedahzur and Hirsch-Hoefler (2004) who examined 73 definitions of terrorism from 55 articles and concluded that terrorism is: "a politically motivated tactic involving the threat or use of force or violence in which the pursuit of publicity plays a significant role."&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg, Pedahzur and Hirsch-Hoefler 2004&lt;/ref&gt; However, Weinberg ''et al.'' point out that definitions of terrorism often ignore [[Symbolism of terrorism|symbolic aspects of terrorism]].  Due to its focus on symbolism, sociology has a unique vantage point from which to assess [[Fear|terror]].

===Post-September 11 attacks===
Since the September 11 attacks, Mathieu Deflem ([[University of South Carolina]]), S.E. Costanza ([[Central Connecticut State University]]) and John C. Kilburn Jr. ([[Texas A&amp;M International University]]) are among the sociologists to call for the development of a sub-field in sociology related to terrorism. Common topics that are part of the discourse in the sociology of terrorism include: [[military spending]], counter-terrorism, [[immigration]], privacy issues, and the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], where within these contexts questions of power, the definition of terrorism, propaganda, nationality, the media, etc. are being deliberated upon.

Early peer-reviewed literature after the September 11 attacks examined policing and citizen responses to terror during the September 11 attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 2002&lt;/ref&gt; It also examined interactions between [[first responder]]s (police, rescue teams, etc.) and communities. Ramirez, Hoopes and Quinlan (2003) rightly predicted that police organizations would change fundamental styles of [[Racial profiling|profiling]] people&lt;ref&gt;Ramirez, Hoopes and Quinlan 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and police agencies would alter their [[mission statement]]s after the September 11 attacks. There is strong reason to believe that even the smallest of local police agencies are apt to feel some kind of pressure to deal with the issue of terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;DeLone 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent work in the sociology of terrorism field is philosophical and reflective and has focused on issues such as moral panic and over-spending after the September 11 attacks. Costanza and Kilburn (2005), in an article entitled ''Symbolic Security, Moral Panic and Public Sentiment: Toward a sociology of Counterterrorism'' argued that the issue of symbolism is of much importance to understanding the war on terror.&lt;ref&gt;Costanza and Kilburn 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Using a classic [[symbolic interactionist]] perspective, they argue that strong public sentiment about the [[homeland security]] issue has driven policy more to superficial threats than real and concrete threats. Others argue that symbolism has led to agency a policy of “[[hypervigilance]]” in agency decision-making that is costly and [[Falsifiability|untestable]].

Some sociologists and legal scholars have contemplated the potential consequences of aggressive (or [[militaristic]]) policing of terror threats that may have negative implications for human rights which are of great interest to sociologists as a matter of [[social justice]].  For instance, in a peer-reviewed article ''Crouching tiger or phantom dragon? Examining the discourse on global cyber-terror'', Helms, Costanza and Johnson (2011) ask if it is possible that media hype at the national level could prompt an unnecessary and systemic over-pursuit of [[cyberterrorism]]. They warn that such overreaction might lead to a "[[killswitch]]" policy which could give the federal government ultimate power over the internet.

Despite the [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] lean of modern sociology; Kilburn, Costanza, Borgeson and Metchik (2011) point out that there are several methodological barbs to effectively and scientifically assessing the effect of homeland security measures.&lt;ref&gt;Kilburn, Costanza, Borgeson and Metchik 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  In traditional [[criminology]], the most quantitatively amenable starting point for measuring the effectiveness of any policing strategy (i.e., [[Neighborhood Watch|neighborhood watch]], [[gun control]], foot patrols, etc.) is to assess total financial costs against [[clearance rates]] or [[arrest rates]]. Since terrorism is such a rare event phenomena, measuring arrests would be a naive way to test policy effectiveness.

Another methodological problem in the development of sociology of terrorism as a sub-field is one of finding operational measures for key concepts in the study of homeland security.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg et al 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Both terrorism and homeland security are relatively new concepts for social scientists, and academicians have yet to agree on the matter of how to properly conceptualize these ideas.

==Three sociological perspectives==

===Structural functionalism===
{{Main|Structural functionalism}}
Functionalism is “the theory that various social institutions and processes in society exists to serve some important (or necessary) function to keep society running.” This sociological perspective draws on the work of sociologists like [[Émile Durkheim]], and gets its name from the idea that the best way to study society is to identify the [[Role|roles]] that different aspects of society play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=29|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deviance (sociology)|Social deviance]], loosely understood, can be taken to mean any "transgression of socially established [[Social norm|norms]]." This can range from the minor–slamming a door in someone's face–to the major–a terrorist act. Thus terrorism is a deviant behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=189|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Functionalism sees terrorism–which is a form of [[crime]]–as a temporary deviation from the normal goings on of society, and is in a way functional to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cinoglu|first1=H.|last2=Ozeren|first2=S|title=Classical Schools of Sociology and  Terrorism|url=http://sbd.ogu.edu.tr/makaleler/1488711_2_Makale_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sociologist that utilizes structural functionalism would explain the existence of any social phenomena by the function they perform. Therefore, terrorism is functional because it joins individuals together in opposition, and brings a sense of belonging to the group opposing it. This feeling of [[group solidarity]] would help prevent [[Anomie|''anomie'']], which is the stage where people do not need to follow any norms of society in order to survive in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cinoglu|first1=H.|last2=Ozeren|first2=S|title=Classical Schools of Sociology and Terrorism|url=http://sbd.ogu.edu.tr/makaleler/1488711_2_Makale_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terrorists, like other criminals, become what is known as a reference point; individuals use a reference point as a standard for evaluation. The norms and rules of society become clearer, and are seen as necessary, in comparison to terrorism. In order to protect the [[Status quo|''status quo'']], society uses terrorism as a way to reassert the importance of social norms in the lives of individuals. Thus individuals see terrorism as a threat to the [[social equilibrium]] and their life in a functioning society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cinoglu|first1=H.|last2=Ozeren|first2=S|title=Classical Schools of Sociology and Terrorism|url=http://sbd.ogu.edu.tr/makaleler/1488711_2_Makale_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Functionalists believe that social change is required to keep a healthy society. Slow, well-planned, and evolutionary method-types change a healthy society socially. These social changes often come about from a drastic need for change and are preceded by a social shock.  Terrorism brings about a social shock that moves society towards a change in direction that enables it to find new ways in which to protect itself. Functionalists view these new changes as providing society with a healthy and slow-paced [[social change]] that was needed. Terrorism thus becomes an expected and needed shock, and therefore can be seen in a sense to encourage society to change for the better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cinoglu|first1=H.|last2=Ozeren|first2=S|title=Classical Schools of Sociology and Terrorism|url=http://sbd.ogu.edu.tr/makaleler/1488711_2_Makale_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict theory===
{{Main|Conflict theories}}
Conflict theory is “the idea that conflict between competing interests is the basic, animating force of social change and society in general." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=30|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conflict theorist generally sees that the control of conflict equals the ability of one group to suppress the group that they are opposing, and that [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] is a technique of defining and maintaining a social order that benefits some at the expense of others.

Conflict theorists view terrorism as a reaction to [[injustice]], which is probably created in the minds of terrorists due to misguidance, illiteracy, or unrealistic goals, and that violent behaviors expressed by terrorist organizations are the result of individual frustration, aggression or showing a readiness to fight. [[Political conflict]] makes people look for ways to explain and solve the problems they are facing. If the conflict is deeply rooted, and the current ideology proves unable to deal with the problems, people begin to turn to other ideologies that can often carry a religious theme to them. This is not to say that all forms of terrorist acts are committed by people that are religious. In 83% of the [[Suicide attack|suicide attackers]] worldwide, between 1980 and 2003, only 43% were identifiably religious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hartmann|first1=Douglas|last2=Uggen|first2=Christopher|title=The Contexts Reader|date=2012|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York, New York|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brym|first1=Robert|title=Six Lessons of Suicide Bombers|date=2007|pages=22–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terrorists use violence because they believe that if they did not use violence they would lose a power struggle, which lead many conflict theorists to view it as a weapon of the weak. In [[Iraq]], between March 2003 and February 2006, 443 suicide missions took place with 71% belonging to [[al-Qaeda]]. They justified their actions in religious terms; viewing the [[Shia Islam in Iraq|Shi'a control of Iraq]] as abandoning religious principles. Suicide attacks against the Iraqi regime and its American and British supporters were seen as the means in which to accomplish this. Yet it was only under certain political conditions that suicide bombings spiked. The first condition being that it was in relation with the [[Counter-insurgency|counterinsurgency]] of the American and British militaries.

===Symbolic interactionism===
{{Main|Symbolic interactionism}}
Symbolic interactionism is “a [[Microsociology|micro-level theory]] in which shared meanings, originations, and assumptions form the basic motivations behind peoples’ actions." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=31|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In symbolic interactionism, [[face-to-face interaction]] creates the social world. Individuals act on perceived meanings that appear to be self-constituting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=32|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Group membership is one of the major determinations if individual interpretations of reality, which enables symbolic interactionism to explain crime, and thus terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cinoglu|first1=H.|last2=Ozeren|first2=S|title=Classical Schools of Sociology and Terrorism|url=http://sbd.ogu.edu.tr/makaleler/1488711_2_Makale_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deviance, which terrorism falls under, can be explained by [[labeling theory]]. Labeling theory is “the belief that individuals subconsciously notice how others see or label them, and their reactions to those labels, over time, form the basis of their [[Self-concept|self-identity]]." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=206|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social groups]] create rules about what is acceptable behavior for people in society. When a rule is broken, society determines if the act was deviant. A person can only become deviant after a social reaction to an act committed is labeled deviant, and that original act is referred to as the [[primary deviance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=209|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being labeled deviant causes a person to see themselves as deviants, which leads to said person performing more deviant acts, with each act being referred to as [[secondary deviance]]. Secondary deviance can quickly turn into a [[Social stigma|stigma]], which is a label that changes the way people see someone, and how individuals view themselves&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=2011|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to symbolic interactionism, terrorism is treated as learned behaviors. Each person learns how to commit terrorism through interactions with terrorists. Involvement in the group is important in the learning process, and members, upon joining, are resocialized to the group’s version of [[Social reality|reality]]. The best way to accomplish this is to involve new members in terrorist acts, which leads the terrorist organization to become the only reference point for its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cinoglu|first1=H.|last2=Ozeren|first2=S|title=Classical Schools of Sociology and  Terrorism|url=http://sbd.ogu.edu.tr/makaleler/1488711_2_Makale_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social learning theory plays a part in the [[socialization]] of terroristic behaviors. Learning theory states that a person becomes deviant because of an abundance of definitions that favor deviant behavior versus definitions that are unfavorable to such behaviors. This theory is broken down into four learning mechanisms: differential association, definitions, differential reinforcement, and imitation.

The first learning mechanism is [[differential association]], which refers to "direct association and interaction with others who engage in certain kinds of behaviors or express norms, values, and attitudes supportive of such behavior, as well as indirect association and identification with more distant reference groups." The groups that an individual are differentially associated with provides the context in which the social learning is operated. The greater the priority, intensity, duration, and frequency of the differential association the greater the effect on behavior. Hence, the theory in relation to terrorism is that the stronger someone's connection is towards a terrorist organization the better chance that person has of also exhibiting terroristic behaviors.

The second learning mechanism is definitions. Definitions refer to an "individual's own value and belief system about what is and is not acceptable behavior." These values are learned and reinforced through differential association. There are two types of definitions, general definition and specific definition. General definitions include broad beliefs about conformity that are influenced through conventional means and are often influenced by religious or moral values. Specific definitions are seen as those that align an individual with particular acts of crime. The greater the number of definitions the more likely a person will engage in criminal behavior. So the more definitions an individual has that favor terroristic behavior the greater chance that person has of committing a terroristic acts.

The third learning mechanism is [[differential reinforcement]]. Differential reinforcement "refers to the balance of anticipated or actual rewards and punishments that follow behavior." An individual refraining from committing a crime depends on a balance of past, present, and anticipated future rewards or punishments for their actions. In regards to terrorism, the more direct or indirect social interaction a person has towards terrorism the more likely they are to commit a terroristic act.

The fourth and final learning mechanism is [[imitation]]. "Imitation is the notion that individuals engage in behaviors that they have previously witnessed others doing." The characters being observed, the behaviors that are being witnessed, and the consequences for those behaviors determine how much an individual imitates a behavior. All of these things need to fall into place in order for an individual to imitate a terrorist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Pauwels|first1=Lieven|last2=Schils|first2=Nele|title=Differential Online Exposure to Extremist Content and Political Violence: Testing the Relative Strength of Social Learning and Competing Perspectives|journal=Terrorism and Political Violence|volume=28|pages=1|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09546553.2013.876414|doi=10.1080/09546553.2013.876414|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7144">'''Spam poetry''', sometimes called '''spoetry''', is poetic verse composed primarily from the subject lines or content of [[E-mail spam|spam]] e-mail messages.

==History==
Several writers have claimed to have created spam poetry, and consensus has not emerged about a single origin. Some early examples come from a spam poetry competition held in 2000 by the website ''Satire Wire''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://heatherhaley.com/hh2/?tag=spoetry|title=spoetry {{!}} Heather Haley|website=heatherhaley.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satirewire.com/features/poetry_spam/spam_winner.shtml|title=SatireWire - Strictly Spam Category Winner|website=www.satirewire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animator [[Don Hertzfeldt]] began writing spam poems in his production journal in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bitterfilms.com/forum.html|title=don hertzfeldt :: alone in a taxicab in a snowing foreign country at 3 in the morning|website=www.bitterfilms.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translator Jorge Candeias wrote Portuguese "spoems" daily, between 5 May 2003 and 5 May 2004, using spam subject lines as title and inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lampadamagica.blogspot.com/2007/05/spamesia-aqui-est-uma-das-tais-postas.html|title=A Lâmpada Mágica: Spamesia|first=Jorge|last=Candeias|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A book entitled ''Machine Language'' by [[endwar (concrete poet)|endwar]] was published in 2005 by IZEN and was followed by ''Machine Language, Version 2.1'' also by endwar in 2006. The latter edition includes a CD of spoetry read by [[Microsoft Sam]] and set to ambient musical sounds by Michael Truman who also tweaked the automated readings.  Each edition indicates endwar as editor, but in the second edition he has admitted to using [[cut-up technique]] and having combined shorter pieces from the first edition, which lends more authorship to him in his creation.  These pieces were also read at the opening of ''Blends &amp; Bridges'', a concrete and visual poetry show at Gallery 324 in Cleveland, Ohio, on April 1, 2006, by endwar with the sounds by Truman backing.  The experimental poet, endwar, cites his own collaboration with Ficus Strangulensis, the experimental poet, in 1995, ''The Further Last Words of Dutch Schultz'' published by IZEN as an earlier experiment in generating random text poetry, in this case, the software altered text of the bizarre last words of [[Dutch Schultz]] as published in [[The New York Times]] in 1935, as well as the cut-up influences of [[Brion Gysin]] and [[William S. Burroughs]] and even the musicians [[Throbbing Gristle]] and [[David Bowie]].&lt;ref&gt;[intro to ''Machine Language, Version 2.1'', endwar, IZEN, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;  The useful bits of spam for purposes of endwar's variation of spoetry, i.e., the part that is not the advertisement, but the random words assigned to trick spam filters, endwar calls "paratext".  Endwar indicates that, in his view, "the effect of the evolution of paratext is that computers are learning to talk to each other by in some sense imitating human texts."  &lt;ref&gt;[intro to ''Machine Language'', endwar, IZEN, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;  The advertisements are the human-to-human conversation in the same email sources.

A book entitled 'Spam: E-mail Inspired Poems' by [[Ben Myers]] was published in 2008 by Blackheath Books [http://www.blackheathbooks.org.uk/2.html] Myers claims to have been writing spam poems since 1999.

The creation of spoetry is similar to Gysin and Burroughs's cut-up technique in that individual subject lines of messages are pieced together in poetic form; making the creation of spoetry an exercise not in creativity as much as in having an eye for the unexpected.

The end result can be crafted into any literary form the author desires: [[haiku]], [[concrete poetry]], [[Limerick (poetry)|limerick]], [[dada]], and so on.  Thus, spoetry is not a literary form but rather a means of creating poetry.

A related concept is spam lit, where snippets of nonsensical verse and prose are embedded in [[spam (electronic)|spam]] e-mail messages. Some of the snippets are original content, others are passages or conglomerations from [[public domain|public-domain]] works. The term was coined by a member of the Poetics [[listserv]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0209&amp;L=poetics&amp;D=1&amp;H=1&amp;O=D&amp;P=60037|title=Listserv 16.0 - Archives - Error|website=listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2006, [[David Kestenbaum]] of NPR's ''[[Morning Edition]]'' broadcast a story on "Literary Spam".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5624749|title=Spam Goes Literary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kestenbaum notes that [[Paul Graham (computer programmer)|Paul Graham]], a programmer, "wrote a program to find out how to best separate spam from real e-mail. To train it, he fed it a good helping of spam and a separate sample of real e-mail." Soon, spammers discovered the works of long-dead poets and writers as one way to circumvent Graham's [[anti-spam]] code.

[[File:Hydeparkapril87.jpg|thumb|Speaker's Corner, April 1987]]

A '''Speakers' Corner''' is an area where [[public speaking|open-air public speaking]], debate, and discussion are allowed. The original and most noted is in the northeast corner of [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] in [[London]], [[England]].  Historically there were a number of other areas designated as Speakers' Corners in other parks in London (e.g., [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]], [[Finsbury Park]], [[Clapham Common]], [[Kennington Park]], and [[Victoria Park, East London|Victoria Park]]). More recently, they have been set up in other British cities, and there are also Speakers' Corners in other countries.

==Hyde Park==
[[File:Speakers Corner London - a speaker.JPG|thumb|"One world" speaker supporting a [[world government]]]]
[[File:Speaker's Corner Speaker.jpg|thumb|A [[Christian]] speaker at Speakers' Corner (2010)]]

Speakers here may talk on any subject, as long as the police consider their speeches lawful, although this right is not restricted to Speakers' Corner only. Contrary to popular belief, there is no immunity from the law, nor are any subjects proscribed, but in practice the police intervene only when they receive a complaint.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} On some occasions in the past, they have intervened on grounds of [[profanity]].&lt;ref&gt;Huggon, Jim:  Speakers' Corner: An Anthology. London: Kropotkin's Lighthouse Publ. 1977&lt;/ref&gt; 

Though Hyde Park Speakers' Corner is considered the paved area closest to [[Marble Arch]],&lt;ref&gt;Hyde Park Regulation, 1955. Statutory Instruments 1955, No. 1750. Clause 1(1), where the "footway at the junction of the North and East Carriage Drives" is described as "known as Speakers' Corner"&lt;/ref&gt; legally the public speaking area extends beyond the [[Reform Tree]] and covers a large area from Marble Arch to [[Victoria Gate (Hyde Park)|Victoria Gate]], then along [[the Serpentine]] to Hyde Park Corner and the Broad Walk running from Hyde Park Corner to Marble Arch.&lt;ref&gt;Paraphrased from: Hyde Park Regulation, 1955. Statutory Instruments 1955 No. 1750. Clause 1(1), where "the public speaking area" is defined. A 1997 revision of the Regulation has a slightly more restricted definition of the area.&lt;/ref&gt;

Public riots broke out in the park in 1855, in protest over the Sunday Trading Bill, which forbade buying and selling on a Sunday, the only day working people had off. The riots were (rather sanguinely) described by [[Karl Marx]] as the beginning of the English revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Humphreys|first1=Rob|last2=Bamber|first2=Judith|title=London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SxCN57GotDkC&amp;pg=PA287|year=2003|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-84353-093-0|pages=287–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement used Hyde Park as a point of assembly for workers' protests, but no permanent speaking location was established. The [[Reform League]] organised a massive [[Reform League#Hyde Park demonstration of 1866|demonstration in 1866]] and then [[Reform League#Hyde Park demonstration of 1867|again in 1867]], which compelled the government to extend the franchise to include most [[working class|working-class]] men.

The riots and agitation for democratic reform encouraged some to force the issue of the "right to speak" in Hyde Park. The Parks Regulation Act 1872 delegated the issue of permitting public meetings to the park authorities (rather than central government). Contrary to popular belief,{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} it does not confer a statutory basis for the right to speak at Speakers' Corner. Parliamentary debates on the Act illustrate that a general principle of being able to meet and speak was not the intention, but that some areas would be permitted to be used for that purpose.

Since that time, it has become a traditional site for public speeches and debate, as well as a major site of protest and assembly in Britain. There are some who contend that the tradition has a connection with the [[Tyburn]] gallows, where the condemned man was allowed to speak before being hanged.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Speakers' Corner is often held up to demonstrate [[freedom of speech]], as anyone can turn up unannounced and talk on almost any subject, although always at the risk of being [[heckler|heckled]] by regulars. The corner was frequented by [[Karl Marx]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[George Orwell]], [[C. L. R. James]], [[Walter Rodney]], [[Ben Tillett]], [[Marcus Garvey]], [[Kwame Nkrumah]], and [[William Morris]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}  Lord Justice Sedley, in ''[[Redmond-Bate v Director of Public Prosecutions]]'' (1999), described Speakers' Corner as demonstrating "the tolerance which is both extended by the law to opinion of every kind and expected by the law in the conduct of those who disagree, even strongly, with what they hear."  The ruling famously established in English case law that freedom of speech could not be limited to the inoffensive but extended also to "the irritating, the contentious, the eccentric, the heretical, the unwelcome, and the provocative, as long as such speech did not tend to provoke violence", and that the right to free speech accorded by [[Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 10]] of the [[European Convention of Human Rights]] also accorded the right to be offensive. Prior to the ruling, prohibited speech at Speakers' Corner included [[obscenity]], [[blasphemy]], [[Lèse-majesté|insulting the queen]], or inciting a [[breach of the peace]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jenkins|first=Milly|title=It's Speakers' Corner, but not as we know it|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/its-speakers-corner-but-not-as-we-know-it-1346856.html|work=The Independent|accessdate=23 April 2013|date=12 May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eibl|first=Ralf|title=London -- Diatribe Alive And Well At Speakers' Corner|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930228&amp;slug=1687918|work=Deutsche Presse Agentur|publisher=The Seattle Times|accessdate=23 April 2013|date=28 February 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, for instance, a combination of park by-laws, use of the Highways Acts and use of venue licensing powers of the [[London County Council]] made it one of the few places where socialist speakers could meet and debate.

The first official Speakers' Corner outside London opened in [[Nottingham]] in 2009. It was officially inaugurated by [[Jack Straw]], the UK Justice Secretary, on 22 February 2009. The designated space occupied a new landscaped extension to the city's [[Old Market Square]], at the junction of King Street and Queen Street. The large paved space includes the new statue of [[Brian Clough]], the former manager of [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] and [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], who forged ties between the two cities which were famous for local rivalry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speakerscornertrust.org/speakers-corner-projects/uk-projects/nottingham/|title=Nottingham - Speakers Corner Trust|website=www.SpeakersCornerTrust.org|access-date=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lichfield, Staffordshire====

Speakers Corner [[Lichfield]] was launched in May 2009, with the help of the Speakers’ Corner Trust, to much applause. Hundreds of people joined in the celebrations which featured over 30 speeches, musical and dance performances, as well as star appearances from BBC’s Jo Malin and former [[Coronation Street]] Star Chris Walker.

Today Speakers’ Corner is a site for events and activities, as well as a destination for all the community to visit and have their say on topics close to their hearts.

Since the launch, a plaque has been unveiled at the site, along with a code of conduct. Plans for the site include a stone plaque marking the spot, as well as a series of annual events.

====Worthing, West Sussex====
The [[Sussex]] coastal town of [[Worthing]] has had its own Speakers' Corner at Splash Point on the town's seafront since the [[Victorian era]].  A sign today marks the "stand for delivering sermons and public speeches", while another sign close by marks the site by the old Fish Market where the [[Salvation Army]] has preached the Gospel since 1886.  The Speakers' Corner fell into disuse in the late 20th century and is now being reinstated.  As part of the Government's ''Sea Change'' programme, being run by the [[Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment]], the area will benefit from a £500,000 grant to re-landscape the area around Splash Point and see a revival of the Speakers' Corner.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worthing.gov.uk/news/title,60447,en.html {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716142005/http://www.worthing.gov.uk/news/title%2C60447%2Cen.html |date=16 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers' corner comprises a dais accessible by steps and a ramp providing a platform from which speakers address the crowd or passers by.&lt;ref name="CPSplashPointDesign"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.craftpegg.com/page6sp.html|title=Splash Point Design|year=2009|publisher=Craft:Pegg|accessdate=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is due for completion by October 2010.&lt;ref name="WBCSplashPointRegeneration"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worthing.gov.uk/news/features/splashpointregeneration/|title=Splash Point Regeneration|year=2010|publisher=Worthing Borough Council|accessdate=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Leeds====
[[Leeds]] is known to have its own Speakers' Corner, at Victoria Gardens&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.speakerscornerleeds.org.uk/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929151606/http://speakerscornerleeds.org.uk/ |archivedate=29 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[the Headrow]], in front of the [[Leeds City Art Gallery]], Central Library and Henry Moore Sculpture Centre building. It is a pivotal point in Leeds for justice and anti-war marches, most of which gather and terminate here, as well as for war memorial services due to the location of Leeds's Municipal Cenotaph.

==== Newcastle ====
The stepped base of [[Grey's Monument]] is used as a stage by assorted musicians, preachers and activists. Verbal clashes between left-wing and right-wing groups are frequent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/english-defence-league-clashes-refugee-10959512|title=English Defence League clashes with refugee rights campaigners in Newcastle|last=Kelly|first=Mike|date=2016-02-27|work=Chronicle Live|access-date=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/edl-march-in-newcastle-and-demand-repatriation-of-immigrants-after-er-referendum-vote_uk_576fccc4e4b0d2571149ca30|title=The EDL Marched In Newcastle Calling For The Repatriation Of Immigrants|date=2016-06-26|work=HuffPost|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/far-right-protesters-filmed-attacking-7251264|title=Racists who believe 'Hitler was right' filmed attacking busker|last=Thompson|first=Craig|date=2016-01-26|work=Daily Mirror|access-date=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other countries==

===Australia===
There is a Speakers' Corner in [[the Domain]] in [[Sydney]], established in 1878. The speakers talk every Sunday afternoon from 2&amp;nbsp;pm until 5&amp;nbsp;pm, and have a website. Official outdoor "free" speech first appeared in the hustings and hanging grounds of Hyde Park Sydney in 1874. Free speech in this form was banned following a serious riot between Catholics and Orangemen. However, following the formalisation of free speech in Speakers' Corner in London it was decided in 1878 that The Domain would be the place for free speech in Sydney.

In 'Diary of a Voyage to Australia, New Zealand and other lands' (published 1896), Robert Roberts notes that "On the west side [of a particular location] is a feature peculiar to Sydney in all the world - a preaching park. There are of course, parks in other cities where open-air spouting is practiced on Sundays, such as Hyde Park, in London : but there is no city in the world where a park on such a scale is used by all classes of religious people. It is a wooded enclosure, like a nobleman's park in England, kept in capital order, both as regards the turf under foot, and the tall and noble trees that give shelter overhead from the sun."  "All the sects and denominations use it. There is none of the sense of infra dig that associates itself with out-door preaching in England.""Every denomination has its own tree." "The various religious bodies hold their meetings sufficiently apart to make no interference one with the other. It is a sort of weekly babel of religious tongues - recognised and patronised by the whole community"

Other Speakers' Corners are found outside [[Parliament House, Queensland|Parliament House]], in [[King George Square]], and at [[Brisbane Powerhouse|The Powerhouse]] in [[Brisbane]]. In [[Melbourne]], Speakers' Corner was originally held in [[Birrarung Marr]] where the original site is still visible. This site has lost some popularity over the years and Speakers' Corner (Now called "Speakers' Forum") is currently held outside the [[State Library of Victoria]] on Sunday afternoon from 3&amp;nbsp;pm.

===Canada===
[[File:Speakers corner.jpg|thumb|Speakers' Corner in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]]]]
Dedicated by the [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Earl Mountbatten]] on 12 April 1966, Speakers' Corner in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]] is located on the north shore of [[Wascana Centre|Wascana Lake]]. It serves as a constant reminder of the notion of free speech and assembly and a tribute to [[Saskatchewan]] people who have upheld that heritage. The two lanterns framing the south entrance to the main plaza formed part of the Cumberland Screen at the entrance to Speakers' Corner in London. The podia on the main plaza are from the exterior columns of the Old City Hall (1908–1965) and symbolise free speech in democracy at the municipal level of government. Six paper [[birch]] trees were taken from [[Runnymede]] Meadow in [[Windsor Great Park]], near [[Windsor Castle]]. It was there that [[John of England|King John]] signed [[Magna Carta]] on 15 June 1215. The ten gas lamps surrounding the corner come from King Charles Street which runs from Whitehall to St. James Park, London, near the Houses of Parliament.  They were erected in 1908 during the reign of [[Edward VII]], whose [[Royal Cypher|royal cypher]] E.R. VII appears on the base of each lamp.

[[Kitchener, Ontario]] has a small area designated as Speakers' Corner on the northwest corner of King and Frederick Streets. It existed already since the mid-1980s.

=== Indonesia ===
Mass demonstration and speeches are traditionally held on the Hotel Indonesia roundabout [[Selamat Datang Monument]]. This venue however, is located the middle of Jakarta's main boulevard and commercial district, thus causing a severe traffic jam when a rally is held. To accommodate this, Jakarta's provincial government built a small park on the northwestern corner of the [[Merdeka Square, Jakarta|Merdeka Square]], across the [[Istana Merdeka]], Indonesia's presidential palace. Officially named 'Taman Pandang Istana' (Palace-View Park), this park is known commonly as 'Taman Unjuk Rasa' (Demonstration Park).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://travel.detik.com/domestic-destinations/d-3337665/usai-demo-jangan-lupa-berfoto-di-taman-unjuk-rasa-yang-happening|title=Usai Demo, Jangan Lupa Berfoto di Taman Unjuk Rasa yang Happening|last=Prakoso|first=Johanes Randy|work=detikTravel|access-date=2017-04-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
As a tribute to democracy and freedom of speech, in Lajatico, Pisa there a small area designated as Speakers' Corner ("L'angolo del parlatore") on a corner of the Vittorio Veneto main square. It is opened for the public to speak on Sundays (9 to 11 a.m. and 4 to 6 p.m.). The first speaker was the mayor Alessio Barbarfieri, who highlighted the importance of the acts of speaking and listening for a good and effective local governance.

===Malaysia===
The first Speakers' Square in [[Malaysia]] was established at the [[Esplanade, Penang|Esplanade]], [[George Town, Penang|George Town]], [[Penang]] on 4 May 2010. It is opened for the public to speak on Wednesday and Sunday (6.00&amp;nbsp;pm to 10.00&amp;nbsp;pm). The first speaker was Tan Seng Hai who shared his views on preventing Ascot Sports [[Sendirian Berhad|Sdn. Bhd.]] from conducting betting activities in the Penang state.

'''''Conditions for use of Speakers' Square'''''
* All speakers are prohibited from using loudspeakers, megaphones, or any other public address system
* Anyone who uses the Speakers' Square to make speeches does so at his or her own risk
* The Penang State Government and the [[Penang Island City Council|City Council of Penang Island]] will not be responsible for any prosecution or legal action by the Police or civil proceedings

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, there is a permanently designated speakers' corner called the [[Spreeksteen]] in [[Amsterdam]]. Lawfully, every person has the freedom of speech as a matter of right. The 'Spreeksteen' is open for free speech 24-hours a day, and was established to allow complete free speech. The 'Spreeksteen' has been located in the [[Oosterpark (Amsterdam)|Oosterpark]] in Amsterdam since 5 May 2005, and has been erected by a citizens action after the brutal murder of film-maker and columnist [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]]. Plans for bringing the Amsterdam Speakers' Corner online with a permanent camera and microphone are in a phase of installation. In the meantime the speakers are filmed with a hand-held camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spreeksteen.nl |title=Spreeksteen.nl |publisher=Spreeksteen.nl |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spreeksteen was involved in controversy when they allowed [[Michiel Smit]], a far-right activist, to speak on 1 October 2006. [[Antifascism|Antifascist]] demonstrators used noise to prevent Smit from being heard (as happens often when there is a public demonstration of the far-right).

===New Zealand===

There is a Speakers' Corner in [[Albert Park, Auckland|Albert Park]] in [[Auckland]] at Princes Street, opposite to the [[University of Auckland]].

===Singapore===
{{Main article|Speakers' Corner, Singapore}}
[[File:Deserted Speakers' Corner - Singapore (gabbe).jpg|thumb|left|An empty Speakers' Corner in [[Singapore]]]]

The Speakers' Corner in [[Singapore]] was opened on 1 September 2000, to allow Singapore citizens to speak freely. They are exempted from the need to obtain a police permit as long as they meet the terms and conditions of use.

The Speakers' Corner is located in [[Hong Lim Park]], a popular venue for many election rallies and political speeches in the 1950s and '60s. Hong Lim Park is centrally located, well-served by public transport and is sited in a high public density area.

In 2004, public exhibitions and performances were added to the list of exempted activities at the Speakers' Corner.

From 1 September 2008, Singapore citizens can also organise or participate in demonstrations at Speakers' Corner without having to obtain a police permit. With this latest change in policy to allow the venue to be used freely as an outdoor demonstration site, coupled with the liberalisation on the use of sound amplification and the extension of operating hours of the venue, the Speakers' Corner aims to address the genuine desire by some Singaporeans for lawful outdoor demonstrations and processions as a means of political expression.

Singapore citizens who wish to hold a speech, exhibition/performance or demonstration at the Speakers' Corner can register with the National Parks Board, which manages Hong Lim Park. Online registration is available on the website.

===Trinidad and Tobago===
Woodford Square in [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad]], is also known as "The University of Woodford Square", so named by the first prime minister of Trinidad [[Eric Williams]], who gave many speeches here. Another nickname, "People's Parliament", comes from the [[Black Power]] movement of the 1970s.  Flanked by Trinidad's Parliament and Halls of Justice the Square still plays host to speeches of a highly topical and political nature.

In the southeast corner of the square, a blackboard lists the day's discussion as well as other important information. The speakers' topics are divided by interest and known as "classes".

===Thailand===
An area was set up in [[Bangkok]] in the 1930s, and quickly became known as Hyde Park, to enable freedom of speech and the airing of political views in [[Thailand]].  The area was shut down after student rioting and the lethal intervention of the army and it is not discussed openly today.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

In 1955, Marshal [[Plaek Pibulsonggram]] had visited London as part of an international tour. He became impressed with the 'Speakers' Corner' in Hyde Park. Upon his return to Thailand a 'Hyde Park' space for free speech and assembly was instituted at the Phramane Grounds in Bangkok. The experiment was well received and effectively stimulated political debate. The experiment was not appreciated by the government though, and in February 1956 restrictions were imposed on the Phramane 'Hyde Park'. However, during this period the Hyde Park Movement Party had evolved, upholding the legacy of the Hyde Park experiment.&lt;ref name="rose181"&gt;Rose, Saul. ''Socialism in Southern Asia''.

=== United States ===
[[File:Elon University USA Speakers Corner.jpg|thumb|[[Elon University]]'s Speakers Corner]]

[[Tom L. Johnson]], the radical reforming Mayor of [[Cleveland]] (1901–1909), dedicated the north-west quadrant of Public Square to Free Speech, as in Hyde Park. Speeches and meetings there were common in the early part of the century; Anarchist Emma Goldman addressed a large crowd there in 1908. Today the site remains the traditional place for rallies and demonstrations in Cleveland, around Mayor Johnson's statue.

The [[History of the University of California, Berkeley#1960s and the Free Speech Movement|University of California at Berkeley]] had a free speech area in front of Sproul Plaza until 1964. [[University_of_Missouri|The University of Missouri]] hosts a Speaker's Corner, referred to as "Speaker's Circle". There are only two such locations in the entire state of Missouri.  

As a result of winter semesters visits to England and Hyde Park, Elon College (now known as [[Elon University]]) created a Speakers' Corner on campus. No persons from outside the university may speak without a permit. Students are free to speak at any time as long as they don't use amplification, do not disrupt others, do not damage property (including the lawn itself) and do not cause dangerous conditions (stakes may not be planted in the ground without the approval of Physical Plant due to electrical/water lines, etc.).

The pedestrian-only area of Pennsylvania Avenue on the north side of the White House in Washington, D.C. has become a de facto speaker's corner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dana-milbank-the-white-house-fence-jumper-and-the-consequences-of-budget-cuts/2014/09/22/def1143a-429f-11e4-b437-1a7368204804_story.html|title=Dana Milbank: The White House fence jumper and the consequences of budget cuts|first=Dana|last=Milbank|date=22 September 2014|publisher=|access-date=1 January 2018|via=www.WashingtonPost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consistent with the principles of the first amendment, ad hoc public speaking is generally legal in all public places in Washington DC, although organized demonstrations require police permits.  

Inspired by Speakers' Corner, [[Karl Dean]], the Mayor of [[Nashville]], designated a space for live music in the south-west corner of [[Centennial Park (Nashville)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nashville.gov/News-Media/News-Article/ID/4391/Phase-One-Renovations-to-Centennial-Park-Complete|title=Phase One Renovations to Centennial Park Complete|date=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;, calling it [[Musicians Corner]].

'''The Sustainable City''' is a 46 [[hectare]] property development in [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]]. Situated on the Al Qudra road, it is the first net zero energy development in the Emirate of Dubai. The development includes 500 villas, 89 apartments and a mixed use area consisting of offices, retail, healthcare facilities, a nursery and food and beverage outlets. Phase 2 of the development will include a hotel, school and innovation centre. 

The City was developed by Dubai-based Diamond Developers, whose Chief Executive Officer, Faris Saeed, has stated that much of his inspiration for the development came from [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]] West Village.

Key elements of the City include:

* a residential area of 500 townhouses and courtyard villas inspired by Dubai’s old [[Al Bastakiya|Bastakiya]] district
* 11 natural ‘biodome’ greenhouses, organic farm and individual garden farms for local food production that use a passive cooling method with fans and pads.
* 10 MW peak solar production
* waste water recycling, with segregated drainage for [[greywater]] and [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] using papyrus as a biofilter
* biking and shaded jogging trails
* charging stations for electric cars
* an equestrian centre

Apart from periphery roads and car parking areas, the development is a car-free site.

The parking areas are topped by solar shading featuring solar panels that are connected to an electrical grid to supply energy into different sections of the city.

Panels are also placed on the roofs of all of the houses.

The construction waste is reused to furniture the public spaces.

The townhouses have UV reflective paint to reduce the thermal heat gain inside the houses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1013">'''Tolerance coning''' is the engineering discipline of creating a budget of all tolerances that potentially add/subtract to affect adequacy of a particular parameter.  This is particularly critical where stages of design/manufacture precede test/use.

For example, when setting a test limit for a measurement on each manufactured item of some type, to assure that no bad items are shipped, the limit must be tighter than the requirement to allow for the worst case sum of measurement inaccuracies (e.g. equipment, [[test fixture]] etc.).  The design of the item thus has to take into account not only the product requirement but also the test tolerances.  The buildup of this budget is tolerance coning.
 
Electronics engineers intuitively do tolerance coning and tend to formalise it for critical parameters.  However it is also relevant to other engineering disciplines.

'''Transformations of text''' are strategies to perform [[transformation (geometry)|geometric transformations]] on text (reversals, rotations, etc.), particularly in systems that do not natively support transformation, such as [[HTML]], [[seven-segment display]]s and [[plain text]].

==Implementation==

Many systems, such as HTML, seven-segment displays and plain text, do not support transformation of text.  In the case of HTML, this limitation in display may eventually be addressed through standard [[cascading style sheets]] (CSS), since proposed specifications for [[CSS3]] include rotation for block elements.&lt;ref name="w3.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-box/#rotating |title=CSS basic box model |publisher=[[W3C]] |date=August 9, 2007 |accessdate=2012-11-19 |editor=Bert Bos}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the meantime, several ways of producing the visual effects of text transformations have come into use.

The most common of these transformations are [[rotation (geometry)|rotation]] and [[reflection (geometry)|reflection]].

[[Unicode]] supports a variety of characters that resemble transformed characters, primarily for various forms of [[phonetic transcription]]. Each of these character names indicates what kind of transformation the characters have undergone:

*Reversed characters, those that have been reflected in a vertical line (i.e., flipped horizontally);
*Inverted characters, those that have been reflected on a horizontal line (i.e., flipped vertically, only one letter has been done this way);
*Turned characters, those that have been rotated 180 degrees and thus appear upside-down (this is the most common);
*Sideways characters, those that have been rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise (generally the least supported, and used only for a handful of vowels in the [[Uralic Phonetic Alphabet]] system).

===Upside-down text===
{{original research|section|date=June 2015}}
Strategies can be used to render words upside down in languages such as [[HTML]] that do not permit [[rotation (geometry)|rotation]] of text; using Unicode characters (especially those in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]), a very close approximation of '''upside-down text''' (also called '''flip text''') can be achieved. The letters s, x, z and o are [[rotational symmetry|rotationally symmetrical]], while pairs such as b/q, d/p and n/u are rotations of each other. The rest of the letters have been encoded into the Unicode IPA section, generating a complete set of upside-down lowercase letters. With the addition of the [[Fraser alphabet]] to the Unicode standard in version 5.2, full (or at least near-full) support for upside-down capital letters is now available. Number support is incomplete; four numbers are universally [[strobogrammatic number|strobogrammatic]] (0, 8, and 6/9), and the upside-down versions of numbers 2 and 3 have been provisionally assigned Unicode points for use in [[duodecimal|dozenal notation]]; however, other numbers still are not supported. Punctuation (by use of such characters as the [[interpunct]] and the [[inverted question mark and exclamation point]]) is mostly covered. Several Internet utilities exist for the transformation of regular text to (and sometimes from) upside-down text; each has its own slightly different algorithm for letters not precisely or well covered. A list of converters and algorithms can be found at [[#Comparison of algorithms|the list below]].

A similar process is '''USD encoding''', which uses characters entirely within the [[ASCII]] character set. Because it is almost entirely alphanumeric, it is far more compatible with other programs that do not support Unicode, and more readily typed by hand. However, the text created by using USD encoding is far less legible, and in fact more closely resembles [[Leet]]. Another problem is that because not all letters fit well, the USD algorithms cannot be a complete [[involution (mathematics)|involution]] (i.e., completely convertible back and forth) and contain a complete set of letters at the same time. For instance, the Albartus USD algorithm example seen in the [[#Examples|"Examples" section below]] has k, T, t, and R still in their upright positions. Another issue with USD encoding is the use of [[italic type]]. The letter "a" will, in most typefaces using italic fonts, render it as a "one-story" [[Latin alpha]], thus causing problems with any word using that letter as a lowercase "e." [[Oblique type]] does not have this problem.

Below is a conversion table that can be used to transform lowercase, uppercase numeric and punctuation output. These characters require unicode version 8.0 minimum (in particular the ᘔ and Ɛ from the [[duodecimal]] block).

===Sideways text===

Sideways text presents a unique problem. Though it is likely the most practical (as opposed to artistic) form of text transformation, it is the least supported and is the most difficult to implement. Unlike rotating text 180 degrees, the number of sideways characters falls far short of what would be needed for most purposes, and because text is rendered horizontally, it would be very difficult to render beyond one line of vertical text in a well-aligned manner without columns, especially in proportional fonts (furthermore, each character would require a line break after it). The process of using alternate characters for sideways text is further complicated by the fact that most fonts space letters further apart vertically (to accommodate [[underline|underlining]] and [[overline|overlining]]) than horizontally, and that most fonts are taller than they are wider, making simulated sideways text look significantly more awkward.

[[Internet Explorer]] has a [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] property that will rotate normally entered text 90 degrees clockwise:

:&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div style="writing-mode:tb-rl;"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;

However, no other major browsers ([[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] nor [[WebKit]] based browsers) support this writing-mode property.  However, all major standards-compliant browsers now support [[CSS3]] rotation for block elements, which makes the visual rotation of HTML text available.&lt;ref name="caniuse"&gt;[http://caniuse.com/#feat=transforms2d Can I use... CSS3 transforms]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common way around these problems is to use [[image]]s of text, which can then be rotated and transformed in an image editor at will, and to represent the text in those images with the [[alt attribute]] so that search engines and text-only browsers can read it properly. The use of [[ANSI art]] and [[box-drawing character]]s to manually draw sideways text has the advantage of being copiable and pastable (whereas images are not in most plain text situations), but generally creates large characters.

===Reversed text===
{{main|Mirror writing}}

Though less widespread, text can also be reversed to be a mirror image of itself. Letters A, H, I, M, O/o, T, U, V/v, W/w, X/x, Y, and in some fonts i and l are symmetrical in the y-axis; the pairs of b/d and p/q transform to each other. The letters И, Я, and ''г'' from [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], among other sources, are among the numerous characters that can be used to further generate this effect. Reversed text can use capital letters mixed with lowercase, as opposed to the strict lowercase used by upside-down transformation (upside-down lowercase and capital letters do not generally align as they would upright, though reversed letters do).

X-axis symmetry is visible in the letters B, C, D, E, H, I, K, O, X, and in some fonts &lt;span style="font-family:Century Gothic;"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; and l, as well as in the pairs of a/&lt;span style="font-family:Arial,sans-serif;"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;, b/p, d/q, e/G, and f/t. Expanding to Cyrillic and Greek produces more symmetries, such as Λ/V and Γ/L.

The [[Fixedsys Excelsior]] typeface includes a complete set of reversed characters like this in its Private Use Area. However, online utilities to create mirrored text are not readily available, and most sites that claim to "mirror text" or "reverse text" in fact only change the order of the letters and do not actually flip the letters themselves.

==Dilated text==
Through the use of Unicode's [[small capitals]] and [[subscript and superscript]] [[Phonetic symbols in Unicode|phonetic modifiers]], text can be created that is smaller than the inline text.  This is generally only necessary for applications that only support one-size plain text, since HTML and CSS support different text sizes.

==Examples==

*Artistry, such as representing the two end zones or player designations on an [[American football]] gridiron; e.g. "[[Pittsburgh Steelers|sɹəʅəəʇS ɥɓɹnqsʇʇɪƋ]]"&lt;sup&gt;[http://fullervision.net/superbowl43.html from this example]&lt;/sup&gt;  or "[[New York Giants|sʇuɐɪ''ŋ'' ʞɹoʎ ʍəN]] ƕ" (note the use of [[hwair]] as a [[dingbat]] of the team's logo).
*[[Emoticon]]s are traditionally drawn sideways in North America.
*Better fit; for instance, rotating column headers on a [[table (HTML)|table]] sideways would produce a more compact table, desirable particularly in tables that contain mostly abbreviations and numeric values.
*[[Faux Cyrillic|Evoking Russian stereotypes]], by flipping certain letters one at a time.
*Evoking simplicity, such as childlike confusion over the direction of a letter (e.g., "[[Toys R Us|Toys Я Us]]") or to indicate vulgarity (such as the wordmark for [[Korn|KoЯn]]).
*[[Symmetry]], such as in the wordmarks for [[Nine Inch Nails]] (NIИ), [[ABBA]] (ᗅᗺᗷᗅ), or ''[[The Rush Limbaugh Show]]'' "EIB" slogan (εıз). The use of transformation in this fashion is known as an ''[[ambigram]]''.
*[[Calculator spelling]] on seven-segment displays, where numbers represent letters upside down (e.g. &lt;span style="font-family:OCR A Extended,OCR-A II;"&gt;07734&lt;/span&gt;, "hello").
*Emulating the [[boustrophedon]] style of writing, where alternating lines are written in opposite directions.
*[[Pentomino]]es and [[tetromino]]es resemble (and are traditionally named after) Latin letters, and the rotation of these letterlike objects forms the basis of several games, including [[Tetris]].
*Though not strict transformation, the substitution of a plural "s" with its near-reflection "z" is a fairly common [[trope (literature)|trope]] among some minor league [[team sport|sports teams]] in the United States, in order to make team names seem more modern.
*Basic [[encryption]], to "hide" the answer to a joke or puzzle, for instance:

:Question: How can you tell an introvert from an extrovert?
:Answer: &lt;span style="font-family:lucida sans unicode, lucida grande;"&gt;˙sǝoɥs s,ʎnƃ ɹǝɥʇo ǝɥʇ ʇɐ sʞool ʇɹǝʌoɹʇxǝ ǝɥʇ 'sɹoʇɐʌǝlǝ ǝɥʇ uı&lt;/span&gt; (Using the Revfad algorithm)
:Or: 'saoys s.hn6 R3HTO ayt te skool tJa^oJtxa ayt  `sJote^ala ayt uI (using the Albartus USD algorithm)

*In [[baseball scorekeeping]], a player who strikes out despite not swinging at the third strike is indicated in the official score book with a reversed or turned K. It has been added to Unicode in version 7.0 at U+A7B0 (Ʞ).
*On the [[Soundgarden]] album [[Superunknown]], all mention of the album or title track (except in the lyrics booklet) is shown as "Superиmoиʞи∩".
*The beverage [[7Up]] during the early 2000s had a spin-off counterpart, known as [[dnL]], with a significantly different color and flavor as well as caffeine.
*[[Facebook]] added "upside-down English" as a language choice in summer 2009.

Example of reversed text reflected along a y-axis:

:Example:&lt;span style="font-family:lucida sans unicode, lucida grande;"&gt;...иiɒəɒ иɘqo [[Parallel universe (fiction)|x иoiƨиɘмib]] oɟ lɒɟɿoq ɘнɟ ɟʇɘl γbodɘмoƧ&lt;/span&gt; (Somebody left the portal to Dimension X open again...)

Poet Darius Bacon has written two examples of [[palindrome|palindromic]] poetry that reads the same upside-down as it does upside right.&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, Darius. [http://wry.me/~darius/writings/a-poem.html a poem] and [http://wry.me/~darius/writings/deus-am.html deus am]. The Palindromist #4.&lt;/ref&gt;

TRiM training provides TRiM Practitioners with a background understanding of psychological trauma and its effects.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg N, Brooks S, Dunn R - "Latest developments in post-traumatic stress disorder: diagnosis and treatment" - British Medical Bulletin. April 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

TRiM is a trauma-focused peer support system&lt;ref&gt;Creamer MC, Varker T, Bisson J, Darte K, Greenberg N, Lau W, Moreton G, O’Donnell M, Richardson D, Ruzek J, Watson P, Forbes D - "Guidelines for peer support in high risk organizations: An international consensus study using the Delphi method" – Journal of Traumatic Stress, April 2012, 25, 134–141&lt;/ref&gt; and the way it works is wholly compliant with the PTSD management guidelines produced by the National Institute for Health and Care and Excellence.&lt;ref&gt;National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Guidance for employers on promoting mental wellbeing through productive and healthy working conditions. NICE Public Health Guidance no.22. London: NICE, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Trauma risk management Practitioners are trained to carry out an interview which identifies a number of risk factors which, when present, increase the likelihood that an individual may suffer poor longer term mental health as a result of a traumatic event. The initial TRiM interview takes place with an individual, 72 hours after a traumatic incident. People who score highly on this initial interview are provided with extra support by colleagues, and where appropriate, line managers. A follow up TRiM interview is then carried out approximately one month later to assess how well people have come to terms with the traumatic event at that point. Individuals who are found to have persistent difficulties at this point are encouraged and assisted to seek a professional assessment in order to access any specific treatment they require.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg N, Brooks S, Dunn R - "Latest developments in post-traumatic stress disorder: diagnosis and treatment" - British Medical Bulletin. April 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

TRiM originated within the [[UK military]] after previously-used reactive single session models of post incident intervention, such as [[Critical Incident Stress Debriefing]], were subject to scientific scrutiny and shown to not just lack effectiveness but also have the potential to do harm.&lt;ref&gt;Rose SC, Bisson J, Wessely S. "Psychological debriefing for preventing post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)". Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2002, Issue 2. Article Number CD000560, DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD000560&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Neil Greenberg]] was one of the team at the forefront of developing peer-led traumatic stress support packages, now known as TRiM. He is an academic psychiatrist based at [[King's College London]] UK and is a consultant occupational and forensic psychiatrist.

Although it was first developed in the UK military, trauma risk management is now used by a range of public and commercial organisations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marchonstress.com/page/p/clients&lt;/ref&gt; This includes charities, emergency services, security firms, risk management organisations, UK Government departments including the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/35492/0392-12attachment2of2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the oil and gas industry, transport organisations and media companies including the [[BBC]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/safety/health/trauma-support&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence and research==
A large number of research papers have been published about the use of TRiM and its effectiveness and acceptance. This includes research about the use of TRiM by Cumbria Constabulary, following the Cumbria shootings in 2010. This research&lt;ref&gt;Hunt E, Jones N, Hastings V, Greenberg N. – "TRiM: an organizational response to traumatic events in Cumbria Constabulary"- Occup Med (Lond) 2013 Dec;63(8):549-55&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the officers and staff who received a TRiM response fared better than their colleagues who did not and were less likely to be absent from work than colleagues who did not receive a TRiM intervention.

Research has shown that the use of TRiM may assist in increasing the psychological resilience of military personnel through the facilitation of social support.&lt;ref&gt;Frappell-Cooke W, Gulina M, Green K, Hacker Hughes J, Greenberg N, "Does trauma risk management reduce psychological distress in deployed troops?" - Occupational Medicine Journal, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent research into TRiM came in a review paper, published in the Journal of Occupational Medicine in April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Whybrow, D, Jones, N, Greenberg, N. "Promoting organizational well-being: a comprehensive review of Trauma Risk Management" – Journal of Occupational Medicine, 16 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4321">'''Trial by media''' is a phrase popular in the late 20th century and early 21st century to describe the impact of [[television]] and [[newspaper]] coverage on a person's reputation by creating a widespread perception of guilt or innocence before, or after, a verdict in a court of law. Its first inception was the phrase ''Trial by Television'' which found light in the response to the 3 February, 1967 television broadcast of [[The Frost Programme]], host [[David Frost]]. The confrontation and Frost's [[Emil_Savundra#Frost_Programme_controversy|personal adversarial line of questioning]] of insurance fraudster [[Emil Savundra]] led to concern from [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] executives that it might affect Savundra's right to a fair trial.

==Description==
During high-publicity court cases, the media are often accused of provoking an atmosphere of public hysteria akin to a [[Lynching|lynch mob]] which not only makes a fair trial nearly impossible but means that regardless of the result of the trial the accused will not be able to live the rest of their life without intense public scrutiny.

The counter-argument is that the [[mob mentality]] exists independently of the media which merely voices the opinions which the public already has.

Although a recently coined phrase, the idea that [[mass media|popular media]] can have a strong influence on the legal process goes back certainly to the advent of the printing press and probably much further.{{OR|date=February 2013}} This is not including the use of a state controlled press to criminalize political opponents, but in its commonly understood meaning covers all occasions where the reputation of a person has been drastically affected by ostensibly non-political publications.

Often the coverage in the press can be said to reflect the views of the person in the street. However, more credibility is generally given to printed material than 'water cooler gossip'. The responsibility of the press to confirm reports and leaks about individuals being tried has come under increasing scrutiny and journalists are calling for higher standards. There was much debate over U.S President [[Bill Clinton]]'s impeachment trial and prosecutor [[Kenneth Starr]]'s investigation and how the media handled the trial by reporting commentary from lawyers which influenced public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal News: News Hour with Jim Lehrer|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/spc/bb/media/july-dec98/lawyers_10-19a.html|publisher=Public Broadcasting System (PBS)|accessdate=12 March 2011|format=Transcript|date=19 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, strict [[Contempt of court#England|contempt of court]] regulations restrict the media's reporting of legal proceedings after a person is formally arrested.  These rules are designed so that a defendant receives a fair trial in front of a jury that has not been tainted by prior media coverage.  The newspapers the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' have been prosecuted under these regulations, although such prosecutions are rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bowcott|first=Owen|title=Contempt of court rules are designed to avoid trial by media|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/jul/05/contempt-court-rules-trial-media|newspaper=The Guardian|date=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9333">In transport, [[tunnel]]s can be connected together to form a '''tunnel [[transport network|network]]'''. These can be used in [[mining]] to reach [[ore]] below ground, in cities for underground [[rapid transit]] systems, in [[sewer system]]s, in [[warfare]] to avoid enemy detection or attacks, as maintenance access routes beneath sites with high ground-traffic such as [[airport]]s and [[amusement park]]s, or to extend public living areas or commercial access while avoiding outdoor weather.

==In warfare==

===Sieges===
Tunnel networks were sometimes developed during [[siege warfare]], even dating back to [[classical antiquity]]. Starting with a single tunnels being dug to undermine a wall that might be detected by the defenders and met with counter-tunnels, leading to [[tunnel warfare]]. Defenders might first create a series of underground listing posts to preempt such mining attacks.

===Trench systems===
[[File:Gros Ouvrage du Michelsberg - Hohlgang.jpg|thumb|Connecting tunnel under [[Ouvrage Michelsberg]], a fortress of the [[Maginot Line]]]]

Any time the use of [[Trench warfare|trenches]] becomes extensive, this naturally leads to connecting them with tunnel networks for safe passage both along the trench lines and with rear areas. In [[World War I#Trench warfare begins|World War I]], when given enough time and resources, the underground components of the defenses could become more extensive than those above ground.

The French [[Maginot Line]], constructed from 1929 to 1939, was a chain of fortresses, bunkers, retractable turrets, outposts, obstacles, and sunken artillery emplacements, all linked by an extensive shell-proof underground tunnel network. It included underground barracks, shelters, ammo dumps and depots, and even had its own underground [[narrow gauge]] railways.

===In Vietnam===
[[Image:VietnamCuChiTunnels.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Part of the tunnel complex at Củ Chi, this tunnel has been made wider and taller to accommodate tourists.]]
The [[Củ Chi tunnels|tunnels of Củ Chi]] are an immense network of connecting underground tunnels located in the [[Củ Chi District]] of [[Ho Chi Minh City]] (Saigon), [[Vietnam]], and are part of a much larger network of tunnels that underlie much of the country. The Củ Chi tunnels were the location of several military campaigns during the [[Vietnam War]], and were the [[Viet Cong]]'s base of operations for the [[Tết Offensive]] in 1968.&lt;br/&gt;
The tunnels were used by Viet Cong soldiers as [[secret passage|hiding spots]] during combat, as well as serving as communication and supply routes, hospitals, food and weapon caches and living quarters for numerous North Vietnamese fighters. The tunnel systems were of great importance to the Viet Cong in their resistance to American forces, and helped to counter the growing American military effort.

[[Image:The Structureplan of Vinh Moc Tunnels.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The Structureplan of Vinh Moc Tunnels.]]
The [[Vịnh Mốc tunnels]] are a tunnel complex in [[Quảng Trị]], [[Vietnam]]. During the [[Vietnam War]] it was strategically located on the border of [[North Vietnam]] and [[South Vietnam]]. The tunnels were built to shelter people from the intense bombing of Son Trung and Son Ha communes in Vinh Linh county of [[Quảng Trị Province]] in the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone]].  The American forces believed the villagers of Vinh Moc were supplying food and armaments to the North Vietnamese garrison on the island of Con Co which was in turn hindering the American bombers on their way to bomb Hanoi. The idea was to force the villagers of Vinh Moc to leave the area but as is typical in Vietnam there was nowhere else to go. The villagers initially dug the tunnels to move their village 10 metres underground but the American forces designed bombs that burrowed down 10 metres. Eventually against these odds, the villagers moved the village to a depth of 30 metres. It was constructed in several stages beginning in 1966 and used until early 1972. The complex grew to include wells, kitchens, rooms for each family and spaces for healthcare. Around 60 families lived in the tunnels; as many as 17 children were born inside the tunnels.&lt;br/&gt;
The tunnels were a success and no villagers lost their lives. The only direct hit was from a bomb that failed to explode; the resulting hole was utilized as a ventilation shaft.&lt;br/&gt;
Three levels of tunnels were eventually built.

==In terrorism==
During the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict]], the Israeli military uncovered and destroyed 32 cross-border tunnels that went on for miles beneath [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] and reached into [[State of Israel|Israeli]] territory. According to intelligence officials, Israeli engineers are developing a system that could detect and destroy cross-border tunnels for which the Israeli government has reportedly spent more than $250 million since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Israel Is Building a Secret Tunnel-Destroying Weapon|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/03/10/israel-is-building-a-secret-tunnel-destroying-weapon-hamas-us-gaza/|publisher=Foreign Policy|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=21 Hamas members killed in tunnel collapses this year|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/222621|website=israelnationalnews.com|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaza Tunnel Collapsed; 2 Hamas Militants Killed|url=http://en.tempo.co/read/news/2016/12/09/074826727/Gaza-Tunnel-Collapsed-2-Hamas-Militants-Killed|website=Tempo.co|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A network of caves beneath the cities of [[Mosul]] and [[Badana]] were built by [[ISIS]]. The terrorist group avoids battlefield engagements, preferring to hide in such tunnels safe from [[satellite]] detection, [[drone strikes]] and [[artillery]], managed to maintain supply lines and communication with other areas under their control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Logan|first1=Ross|title=Eerie pictures from inside ISIS' secret underground lair in Mosul|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/eerie-pictures-inside-isis-secret-9138284|publisher=Mirror|accessdate=3 January 2017|date=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Massive network of Islamic State underground tunnels discovered|url=http://www.9news.com.au/world/2016/05/14/10/12/massive-network-of-islamic-state-underground-tunnels-discovered|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Daesh video shows construction of intricate tunnel network|url=http://www.albawaba.com/loop/new-daesh-video-shows-constuction-intricate-tunnel-network-870888|publisher=Al Bawaba|accessdate=3 January 2017|date=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Retaken villages show ISIS increasingly driven underground|url=http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/retaken-villages-show-isis-increasingly-driven-underground|website=Military Times|publisher=Military Times|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Underground rabbit warrens found as IS flees|url=http://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/is-living-underground-like-rabbits-its-outside-human-behaviour/news-story/236d3e88228a4807ac31ed2e5019e400|website=NewsComAu|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The weapons Islamic State could use in the battle for Mosul|url=https://uk.news.yahoo.com/weapons-islamic-state-could-battle-mosul-185300040.html|publisher=Yahoo News|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Retaken villages show IS increasingly driven underground|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/10/18/retaken-villages-show-is-increasingly-driven-underground.html|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=3 January 2017|date=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25769">'''Vagal tone''' refers to activity of the [[vagus nerve]], a fundamental component of the [[Parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] branch of the [[autonomic nervous system]]. This branch of the nervous system is not under conscious control and is largely responsible for the regulation of several body compartments at rest. Vagal activity results in various effects, including: [[heart rate]] reduction, [[Vasodilation|vasodilation/constriction]] of [[Blood vessel|vessels]], glandular activity in the [[heart]], [[lung]]s, and [[Gastrointestinal tract|digestive tract]] as well as control of gastrointestinal sensitivity, motility and inﬂammation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In this context, tone specifically refers to the continual nature of baseline parasympathetic action that the vagus nerve exerts. While baseline vagal input is constant, the degree of stimulation it exerts is regulated by a balance of inputs from [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] and [[Parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] divisions of the autonomic nervous system. Despite the described duality, vagal tone has been reported to mainly reflect the general level of parasympathetic activity.  Vagal tone is typically considered in the context of heart function, but also has utility in assessing emotional regulation and other processes that alter, or are altered by changes and modification of the parasympathetic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Lisa M.|last2=Fagundes|first2=Christopher P.|last3=Butterworth|first3=Molly R. | name-list-format = vanc | date=2011|title=Attachment Style, Vagal Tone, and Empathy During Mother-Adolescent Interactions |journal=Journal of Research on Adolescence |volume=22|issue=1|pages=165–184|doi=10.1111/j.1532-7795.2011.00762.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grossman P, Wilhelm FH, Spoerle M | title = Respiratory sinus arrhythmia, cardiac vagal control, and daily activity | journal = American Journal of Physiology.

Measuring vagal tone along with its quantification and estimation can be performed by means of either invasive or noninvasive procedures. The former methodologies encompass the vagus nerve stimulation by manual or electrical techniques but literature reports a very limited number of experiments and clinical studies especially involving human subjects. On the other hand, noninvasive techniques are largely employed and they mainly rely on the investigation of [[heart rate]] and [[heart rate variability]].&lt;ref name="Vagus Nerve Stimulation"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Howland RH | title = Vagus Nerve Stimulation | journal = Current Behavioral Neuroscience Reports | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 64–73 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24834378 | pmc = 4017164 | doi = 10.1007/s40473-014-0010-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Porges SW, Doussard-Roosevelt JA, Maiti AK | title = Vagal tone and the physiological regulation of emotion | journal = Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development | volume = 59 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 167–86 | date = 2008 | pmid = 7984159 | doi = 10.1111/j.1540-5834.1994.tb01283.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brock C, Jessen N, Brock B, Jakobsen PE, Hansen TK, Rantanen JM, Riahi S, Dimitrova YK, Dons-Jensen A, Aziz Q, Drewes AM, Farmer AD | title = Cardiac vagal tone, a non-invasive measure of parasympathetic tone, is a clinically relevant tool in Type 1 diabetes mellitus | journal = Diabetic Medicine | volume = 34 | issue = 10 | pages = 1428–1434 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 28703868 | doi = 10.1111/dme.13421 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Noninvasive vagal tone quantification ==
In the majority of cases, vagal tone is not directly measured. The most common procedure towards its quantification consist in investigating the processes altered by the [[vagus nerve]] – specifically heart rate and heart rate variability. As a general consideration, increased vagal tone (and thus vagal action) is associated with a diminished and more variable heart rate. On the opposite, during [[Tilt table test|graded orthostatic tilt]], vagal tone withdrawal is physiological and described as an indirect indicator of cardiovascular fitness.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Montano N, Ruscone TG, Porta A, Lombardi F, Pagani M, Malliani A | title = Power spectrum analysis of heart rate variability to assess the changes in sympathovagal balance during graded orthostatic tilt | journal = Circulation | volume = 90 | issue = 4 | pages = 1826–31 | date = October 1994 | pmid = 7923668 | doi = 10.1161/01.CIR.90.4.1826 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vagal innervation of the heart ===
[[Heart rate]] is largely controlled by the heart's internal pacemaker activity. Considering a healthy heart, the main pacemaker is a collection of cells on the border of the [[Atrium (heart)|atria]] and [[Venae cavae|vena cava]] called the [[sinoatrial node]]. Heart cells exhibit automaticity which is the ability to generate [[Electrical conduction system of the heart|electrical activity]] independent of external stimulation. As a result, the cells of the node spontaneously generate electrical activity that is subsequently conducted throughout the heart, resulting in a regular heart rate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In absence of any external stimuli, sinoatrial pacing contributes to maintain the heart rate in the range of 60–100 beats per minute (bpm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nunan D, Sandercock GR, Brodie DA | title = A quantitative systematic review of normal values for short-term heart rate variability in healthy adults | journal = Pacing and Clinical Electrophysiology | volume = 33 | issue = 11 | pages = 1407–17 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 20663071 | doi = 10.1111/j.1540-8159.2010.02841.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the two branches of the autonomic nervous system act in a complementary way increasing or slowing the heart rate. In this context, the vagus nerve acts on sinoatrial node slowing its conduction thus actively modulating vagal tone accordingly. This modulation is mediated by the [[neurotransmitter]] [[acetylcholine]] and downstream changes to [[Ion channel|ionic currents]] and calcium of heart cells.&lt;ref name="Vagus Nerve Stimulation"/&gt;

Given the evidence that the vagus nerve plays a crucial role in heart rate regulation by modulating the response of [[sinoatrial node]], vagal tone can be quantified by investigating heart rate modulation induced by vagal tone changes. This kind of analysis allows to investigate vagal tone by means of several noninvasive techniques based on [[heart rate variability]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Respiratory sinus arrhythmia===
'''Respiratory sinus arrhythmia''' ('''RSA''') is typically a benign, naturally occurring variation in heart rate that occurs during each breathing cycle. Specifically, heart rate increases during inspiration and decreases during expiration period.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berntson GG, Cacioppo JT, Quigley KS | title = Respiratory sinus arrhythmia: autonomic origins, physiological mechanisms, and psychophysiological implications | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 30 | issue = 2 | pages = 183–96 | date = March 1993 | pmid = 8434081 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8986.1993.tb01731.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; RSA was firstly recognized by [[Carl Ludwig]] but its genesis and understanding it is still nowadays largely discussed.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation | vauthors = De Burgh Daly M | title=Interactions Between Respiration and Circulation|date=1985 |encyclopedia=Comprehensive Physiology|pages=529–594|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |doi=10.1002/cphy.cp030216|isbn=9780470650714 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RSA has been observed in humans from the early stages of life through adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hathorn MK | title = Respiratory sinus arrhythmia in new-born infants | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 385 | pages = 1–12 | date = April 1987 | pmid = 3656159 | pmc = 1192333 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Moreover, RSA is a mechanism which can be consistently found in several different species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Myers MM, Fifer W, Haiken J, Stark RI | title = Relationships between breathing activity and heart rate in fetal baboons | journal = The American Journal of Physiology | volume = 258 | issue = 6 Pt 2 | pages = R1479-85 | date = June 1990 | pmid = 2360694 | doi = 10.1152/ajpregu.1990.258.6.R1479 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hayano J, Yasuma F, Okada A, Mukai S, Fujinami T | title = Respiratory sinus arrhythmia. A phenomenon improving pulmonary gas exchange and circulatory efficiency | journal = Circulation | volume = 94 | issue = 4 | pages = 842–7 | date = August 1996 | pmid = 8772709 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Castellini MA, Rea LD, Sanders JL, Castellini JM, Zenteno-Savin T | title = Developmental changes in cardiorespiratory patterns of sleep-associated apnea in northern elephant seals | journal = The American Journal of Physiology | volume = 267 | issue = 5 Pt 2 | pages = R1294-301 | date = November 1994 | pmid = 7977857 | doi = 10.1152/ajpregu.1994.267.5.R1294 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[inhalation]] [[Thoracic diaphragm|intra-thoracic pressure]] lowers due to the contraction and downward movement of the [[Diaphragmatic breathing|diaphragm]] and the expansion of the chest cavity. Atrial pressure is also lowered as a result, enabling an increased blood flow to the heart. Such increase in blood volume towards the heart cavities triggers [[baroreceptor]]s which act to diminish vagal tone. Subsequently, heart rate increases.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On the opposite during [[exhalation]], the diaphragm relaxes, moving upward it decreases the size of the chest cavity, causing a subsequent increase in intrathoracic pressure. This increase in pressure inhibits [[Venous return curve|venous return]] to the heart resulting in both reduced atrial expansion and minor activation of baroreceptors. Given the reduced baroreceptor activation, vagal tone is not suppressed as during inhalation so that it can exert its ability in decreasing heart rate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== RSA as a vagal tone estimator ====
As previously described, it is nowadays established that the two divisions of the autonomic nervous system influence each other reciprocally and independently so more and more measures able to discriminate the two contributions have been developed. In recent years, several studies have been published highlighting the quantification of RSA as a reliable tool to investigate vagal tone in a noninvasive way. Such investigations encompass physiological, behavioral, and several clinical studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hayano J, Sakakibara Y, Yamada M, Kamiya T, Fujinami T, Yokoyama K, Watanabe Y, Takata K | title = Diurnal variations in vagal and sympathetic cardiac control | journal = The American Journal of Physiology | volume = 258 | issue = 3 Pt 2 | pages = H642-6 | date = March 1990 | pmid = 2316678 | doi = 10.1152/ajpheart.1990.258.3.H642 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Porges|first=Stephen W. | name-list-format = vanc | chapter=Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia: Physiological Basis, Quantitative Methods, and Clinical Implications|date=1986 | title =Cardiorespiratory and Cardiosomatic Psychophysiology|pages=101–115|publisher=Springer US |doi=10.1007/978-1-4757-0360-3_7|isbn=9781475703627 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pagani M, Lombardi F, Guzzetti S, Rimoldi O, Furlan R, Pizzinelli P, Sandrone G, Malfatto G, Dell'Orto S, Piccaluga E | title = Power spectral analysis of heart rate and arterial pressure variabilities as a marker of sympatho-vagal interaction in man and conscious dog | journal = Circulation Research | volume = 59 | issue = 2 | pages = 178–93 | date = August 1986 | pmid = 2874900 | doi = 10.1161/01.RES.59.2.178 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main advantage in measuring of vagal tone by RSA is that such information are easily derivable from a single [[electrocardiography]] (ECG) recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grossman P, van Beek J, Wientjes C | title = A comparison of three quantification methods for estimation of respiratory sinus arrhythmia | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 27 | issue = 6 | pages = 702–14 | date = November 1990 | pmid = 2100356 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, novel methodologies started addressing RSA quantification by a multivariate approach thus not considering ECG only but the interrelationship of ECG and [[Respiratory system|respiration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dick TE, Hsieh YH, Dhingra RR, Baekey DM, Galán RF, Wehrwein E, Morris KF | title = Cardiorespiratory coupling: common rhythms in cardiac, sympathetic, and respiratory activities | journal = Progress in Brain Research | volume = 209 | pages = 191–205 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24746049 | pmc = 4052709 | doi = 10.1016/b978-0-444-63274-6.00010-2 | publisher = Elsevier | isbn = 9780444632746 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bartsch RP, Schumann AY, Kantelhardt JW, Penzel T, Ivanov PC | title = Phase transitions in physiologic coupling | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 26 | pages = 10181–6 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22691492 | pmc = 3387128 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1204568109 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the opposite, vagal tone quantification by means of RSA has been questioned by many authors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grossman P, Karemaker J, Wieling W | title = Prediction of tonic parasympathetic cardiac control using respiratory sinus arrhythmia: the need for respiratory control | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 201–16 | date = March 1991 | pmid = 1946886 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that RSA is unequivocally related to vagal control but it also clear that is determined by two different mechanisms namely: vagal tonic and vagal phasic. The former processes exhibit different dynamics and origins so that it is crucial to be able to differentiate their contributions to RSA. Furthermore, it has been observed that tonic and phasic components are distinct yet not completely independent one each other.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Despite the nowadays limitations in RSA quantification, it is considered a promising, noninvasive and reliable index of vagal control of the heart, thus an indirect estimator of vagal tone.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

====Biological findings====
The main hypothesis capable of explaining the reason behind the correlation of RSA and vagal tone describes RSA as an intrinsic resting function of the cardiopulmonary system.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hayano J, Yasuma F | title = Hypothesis: respiratory sinus arrhythmia is an intrinsic resting function of cardiopulmonary system | journal = Cardiovascular Research | volume = 58 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–9 | date = April 2003 | pmid = 12667941 | doi = 10.1016/S0008-6363(02)00851-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory suggest that in animals and humans RSA may eventually contribute to energy saving for both cardiac and respiratory systems thus reducing the heart rate and related heartbeats numbers. Furthermore, RSA could save energy expenditure by suppressing ineffective ventilation during the ebb of [[perfusion]] (delivery of blood from arteries to capillaries for oxygenation and nutrition).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ben-Tal A, Shamailov SS, Paton JF | title = Evaluating the physiological significance of respiratory sinus arrhythmia: looking beyond ventilation-perfusion efficiency | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 590 | issue = 8 | pages = 1989–2008 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22289913 | pmc = 3573317 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.2011.222422 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hayano J, Yasuma F, Okada A, Mukai S, Fujinami T | title = Respiratory sinus arrhythmia. A phenomenon improving pulmonary gas exchange and circulatory efficiency | journal = Circulation | volume = 94 | issue = 4 | pages = 842–7 | date = August 1996 | pmid = 8772709 | doi = 10.1161/01.cir.94.4.842 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the physiological fields, RSA has been found to increase in subjects in resting state and to decrease in state of stress or tension.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  RSA is increased in supine position and decreased in prone position. RSA is on average higher and more pronounced during day time with respect to night time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  RSA have also been extensively used to quantify vagal tone withdrawal in [[Tilt table test|graded orthostatic tilt]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lewis GF, Furman SA, McCool MF, Porges SW | title = Statistical strategies to quantify respiratory sinus arrhythmia: are commonly used metrics equivalent? | journal = Biological Psychology | volume = 89 | issue = 2 | pages = 349–64 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22138367 | pmc = 3269511 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2011.11.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, expression of RSA decreases with age: it is pronounced in children and its magnitude tends to gradually disappear once a subject approach adulthood.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Graziano P, Derefinko K | title = Cardiac vagal control and children's adaptive functioning: a meta-analysis | journal = Biological Psychology | volume = 94 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–37 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23648264 | pmc = 4074920 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2013.04.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, adults in excellent cardiovascular health, such as endurance runners, swimmers, and cyclists, are likely to have a more pronounced RSA. Professional athletes on average maintain very high vagal tone and consequently higher RSA levels. RSA has been found to becomes less prominent in individuals with diabetes and cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Masi CM, Hawkley LC, Rickett EM, Cacioppo JT | title = Respiratory sinus arrhythmia and diseases of aging: obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension | journal = Biological Psychology | volume = 74 | issue = 2 | pages = 212–23 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17034928 | pmc = 1804292 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2006.07.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Psychological findings====
The majority of vagal tone research in the physiological field (social behavior, social interactions, and human psychology) have been focused on [[newborn]]s and [[child]]ren.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The rational is to investigate children's adaptive functioning within a quantitative and reliable framework. Typically, researchers focus their attention on baseline vagal tone detection, treating it either as a potential predictor of behavior or examining its relationship with mental health (particularly [[emotion regulation]], [[anxiety]], and [[Internalizing disorder|internalizing]] and [[externalizing disorders]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Connell AM, Hughes-Scalise A, Klostermann S, Azem T | title = Maternal depression and the heart of parenting: respiratory sinus arrhythmia and affective dynamics during parent-adolescent interactions | journal = Journal of Family Psychology | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 653–62 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21875198 | doi = 10.1037/a0025225 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Polyvagal theory]] by [[Stephen Porges|Porges]] is considered as the most influential model able to describe the differences between basal vagal tone during steady state and vagal reactivity as a response to external stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Porges SW | title = Orienting in a defensive world: mammalian modifications of our evolutionary heritage. A Polyvagal Theory | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 301–18 | date = July 1995 | pmid = 7652107 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8986.1995.tb01213.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Porges SW | title = The Polyvagal Theory: phylogenetic contributions to social behavior | journal = Physiology &amp; Behavior | volume = 79 | issue = 3 | pages = 503–13 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12954445 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Porges SW | title = Social engagement and attachment: a phylogenetic perspective | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1008 | pages = 31–47 | date = December 2003 | pmid = 14998870 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The model describes vagal tone modifications a differential measure between vagal tone baseline and vagal tone activation during attention-demanding state. The theory states that successful vagal regulation is characterized by RSA suppression or withdrawal during attention tasks leading to increased metabolic output associated with heart rate increase.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Despite the hypothesized link between vagal tone reduction and social functioning as stated by Porges' theory, researchers have been focusing mainly on the analysis of basal vagal tone. Examples are the findings reporting lower baseline RSA in children with [[Autism Spectrum Disorders]] with respect to healthy controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Patriquin MA, Scarpa A, Friedman BH, Porges SW | title = Respiratory sinus arrhythmia: a marker for positive social functioning and receptive language skills in children with autism spectrum disorders | journal = Developmental Psychobiology | volume = 55 | issue = 2 | pages = 101–12 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 22212893 | doi = 10.1002/dev.21002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research indicates that children with more secure attachments with their mothers exhibited greater empathetic responsiveness, less social inhibition, and higher vagal tone, highlighting the vagus nerve's regulatory effect, as well as the quantification of vagal tone by means of RSA, as a predictor of emotional and social function.&lt;ref name="vagal tone adolescents attachment style"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Diamond LM, Fagundes CP, Butterworth MR|year=2012|title=Attachment style, vagal tone, and empathy during mother–adolescent interactions|journal=Journal of Research on Adolescence|volume=22|issue=1|pages=165–184|doi=10.1111/j.1532-7795.2011.00762.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Additional heart rate variability parameters ===
Vagal tone estimation based on heart rate is quantifiable by several parameters rather than the use of RSA only. Examples are indexes of beat-to-beat variability such as RMSSD reported by The Task Force of the [[European Society of Cardiology]] and [[Heart Rhythm Society]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Heart rate variability. Standards of measurement, physiological interpretation, and clinical use.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5073">'''Venom optimization hypothesis''', also known as '''venom metering''', is a [[Biological Theory (journal)|biological hypothesis]] which postulates that [[venomous animals]] have physiological control over their production and use of [[venoms]]. It explains the economic use of venom because venom is a metabolically expensive product, and that there is a biological mechanism for controlling their specific use. The hypothetical concept was proposed by Esther Wigger, Lucia Kuhn-Nentwig, and Wolfgang Nentwig of the Zoological Institute at the [[University of Bern]], [[Switzerland]], in 2002.&lt;ref name=wigger&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wigger E, Kuhn-Nentwig L, Nentwig W |title= The venom optimisation hypothesis: a spider injects large venom quantities only into difficult prey types |year =2002 |url= | journal= Toxicon | volume= 40 | issue= 6 |pages = 749–752 |pmid= 12175611 |pmc= |doi= 10.1016/S0041-0101(01)00277-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=morgen&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Morgenstern D, King GF |title= The venom optimization hypothesis revisited |year =2013 |url= | journal= Toxicon | volume=63 | issue=  |pages = 120–128 |pmid=23266311 |pmc= |doi= 10.1016/j.toxicon.2012.11.022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of venomous animals have been experimentally found to regulate the amount of venom they use during predation or defensive situations. Species of anemones, jellyfish, ants, scorpions, spiders, and snakes are found to use their venoms frugally depending on the situation and size of their preys or predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Nisani Z |title= Behavioral and Physiological Ecology of Scorpion Venom Expenditure: Stinging, Spraying, and Venom Regeneration|year=2008 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BGqkiciYtsIC&amp;dq |pages=32–39 | publisher= ProQuest |isbn=  9780549591610}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

Venom optimization hypothesis was postulated by Wigger, Kuhn-Nentwig, and Nentwig from their studies of the amount of venom used by a [[wandering spider]] ''[[Cupiennius salei]]''. This spider produces a [[neurotoxin|neurotoxic peptide]] called CsTx-1 for paralysing its prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kuhn-Nentwig L, Fedorova IM, Lüscher BP, Kopp LS, Trachsel C, Schaller J, Vu XL, Seebeck T, Streitberger K, Nentwig W, Sigel E, Magazanik LG |title=  A venom-derived neurotoxin, CsTx-1, from the spider ''Cupiennius salei'' exhibits cytolytic activities|year = 2012|url= | journal= J Biol Chem | volume= 287 | issue= 30 |pages = 25640–25649 |pmid= 22613721 |pmc= 3408166 |doi= 10.1074/jbc.M112.339051}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not weave webs for trapping preys, and therefore, entirely depends on its venom for predation. It is known to prey on a variety of insects including butterflies, moths, earwigs, cockroaches, flies and grasshoppers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Nentwig W |title= Non-webbuilding spiders: prey specialists or generalists? |url= |journal= Oecologia |volume= 69|issue=4 | pages= 571–576 |year= 1986 |pmid= |doi= 10.1007/BF00410365}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its venom glands store only about 10 μl of crude venom. Refilling of the glands takes 2–3 days and the lethal efficacy of the venom is, initially, very low for several days, requiring 8 to 18 days for full effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boevé JL, Kuhn-Nentwig L, Keller S, Nentwig W |year= 1995 |title= Quantity and quality of venom released by a spider (''Cupiennius salei'', Ctenidae) |url= |journal= Toxicon |volume=33 |issue= 10 | pages= 1347–1357 |pmid= 8599185|doi= 10.1016/0041-0101(95)00066-U}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that the amount of venom released differed for each specific prey. For example, for bigger and stronger insects like beetles, the spider uses the entire amount of its venom; while for small ones, it uses only a small amount, thus economizing its costly venom.&lt;ref name=wigger/&gt; In fact, experiments show that the amount of venom released is just sufficient (at the lethal dose) to paralyze the target organism depending on the size or strength, and is not more than what is necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kuhn-Nentwig L, Schaller J, Nentwig W | year= 2004|url= |title=Biochemistry, toxicology and ecology of the venom of the spider ''Cupiennius salei'' (Ctenidae) | journal= Toxicon|volume=43 |issue= 5|pages= 543–553| pmid= 15066412|doi=10.1016/j.toxicon.2004.02.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==

Animal venoms are complex biomolecules and hence, their biological synthesis require high metabolic activity. A particular venom itself is a complex chemical mixture composed of hundreds of proteins and non-proteinaceous compounds, resulting in a potent weapon for prey immobilization and predator deterrence. The metabolic cost of venom is sufficiently high to result in secondary loss of venom whenever its use becomes non-essential to survival of the animal. This suggests that venomous animals may have evolved strategies for minimizing venom expenditure, that they should use them only as and when required, and that too in optimal amount.&lt;ref name=morgen/&gt;

'''White supremacy''' or '''white supremacism''' is the [[racist]] belief that [[white people]] are superior to people of other [[Race (human classification)|races]] and therefore should be dominant over them. White supremacy has roots in [[scientific racism]], and it often relies on [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] arguments. Like most similar movements such as [[neo-Nazism]], white supremacists typically oppose members of other races as well as [[Jews]].

The term is also typically used to describe a [[political ideology]] that perpetuates and maintains the [[society|social]], [[politics|political]], [[historical revisionism|historical]], or [[institutional racism|institutional]] domination by white people (as evidenced by historical and contemporary sociopolitical structures such as the [[Atlantic slave trade]], [[Jim Crow laws]] in the [[United States]], and ''[[apartheid]]'' in [[South Africa]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Privilege Revealed: How Invisible Preference Undermines America |last=Wildman |first=Stephanie M. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1996 |publisher=NYU Press |location= |isbn=0-8147-9303-7 |page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Helms 2016 6–7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Helms|first=Janet|date=2016|title=An election to save White Heterosexual Male Privilege|url=|journal=Latina/o Psychology Today|volume=3|pages=6–7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different forms of white supremacism put forth different conceptions of who is considered white, and different groups of white supremacists identify various racial and cultural groups as their primary enemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Spaces of Hate: Geographies of Discrimination and Intolerance in the U.S.A. |last=Flint |first=Colin |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn=0-415-93586-5 |page=53 |quote=Although white racist activists must adopt a political identity of whiteness, the flimsy definition of whiteness in modern culture poses special challenges for them.

In academic usage, particularly in usage which draws on [[critical race theory]] or [[Intersectionality]], the term "white supremacy" can also refer to a political or socioeconomic system, in which white people enjoy a structural advantage ([[Privilege (social inequality)|privilege]]) over other ethnic groups, on both a collective and individual level.

==History==
White supremacy has ideological foundations that date back to 17th-century [[scientific racism]], the predominant paradigm of human variation that helped shape international relations and racial policy from the latter part of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] until the late 20th century (marked by decolonization and the abolition of [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]] in 1991, followed by that country's [[South African general election, 1994|first multiracial elections in 1994]]).

White supremacy was dominant in the [[United States]] both before and after the [[American Civil War]], and it persisted for decades after the [[Reconstruction Era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fredrickson | first = George | title = White Supremacy | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford Oxfordshire | year = 1981 | isbn = 0-19-503042-7 |page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[antebellum South]], this included the holding of [[African Americans]] in [[slavery in the United States|chattel slavery]], with four million of them denied freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How the end of slavery led to starvation and death for millions of black Americans|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/16/slavery-starvation-civil-war|publisher=The Guardian|date=September 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outbreak of the Civil War saw the desire to uphold white supremacy being cited as a cause for state secession&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_texsec.asp A Declaration of the Causes which Impel the State of Texas to Secede from the Federal Union]: "We hold as undeniable truths that the governments of the various States, and of the confederacy itself, were established exclusively by the white race, for themselves and their posterity; that the African race had no agency in their establishment; that they were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race, and in that condition only could their existence in this country be rendered beneficial or tolerable.

In some parts of the United States, many people who were considered non-white were [[disfranchisement|disenfranchised]], barred from government office, and prevented from holding most government jobs well into the second half of the 20th century.

The denial of social and political freedom for minorities continued into the mid-20th century, resulting in the [[civil rights movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/kansas-city/press/2013/13-29.html |title=50th Anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom Panel Discussion at the Black Archives of Mid-America |accessdate=October 3, 2015 |format=press release |publisher=The U.S. National Archives and Records Administration |date=August 7, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004044615/http://www.archives.gov/kansas-city/press/2013/13-29.html |archivedate=October 4, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist Stephen Klineberg has stated that U.S. immigration laws prior to 1965 clearly declared "that [[Northern European]]s are a superior subspecies of the white race".&lt;ref name="Immigration law"/&gt;  The [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional Northern European and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic groups]], and significantly altered the demographic mix in the U.S as a result.&lt;ref name="Immigration law"&gt;{{cite web |title= 1965 immigration law changed face of America |author=Jennifer Ludden |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5391395 |publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[U.S. state]]s banned [[interracial marriage]] through [[anti-miscegenation laws]] until 1967, when these laws were invalidated by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]' decision in ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]''. These mid-century gains had a major impact on white Americans' political views; segregation and white racial superiority, which had been publicly endorsed in the 1940s, became minority views within the white community by the mid-1970s, and continued to decline into 1990s polls to a single-digit percentage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Racial Attitudes in America: Trends and Interpretations|last1=Schuman|first1=Howard|last2=Steeh|first2=Charlotte|last3=Bobo|first3=Lawrence|last4=Krysan|first4=Maria|date=1997|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-674-74568-1|location=|pages=103ff|quote="The questions deal with most of the major racial issues that became focal in the middle of the twentieth ecntury: integration of public accommodations, school integration, residential integration, and job discrimiantion [and] racial intermarriage and willingness to vote for a black presidential candidate. … The trends that occur for most of the principle items are quite similar and can be illustrated …using attitudes toward school integration as an example.

Some academics argue that outcomes from the 2016 United States Presidential Election reflect ongoing challenges with white supremacy.

===British Empire===
In 1937, [[Winston Churchill]] told the Palestine Royal Commission: "I do not admit for instance, that a great wrong has been done to the Red Indians of America or the black people of Australia. I do not admit that a wrong has been done to these people by the fact that a stronger race, a higher-grade race, a more worldly wise race to put it that way, has come in and taken their place." British historian [[Richard Toye]], author of Churchill's Empire, said that "Churchill did think that white people were superior."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The 10 greatest controversies of Winston Churchill's career |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-29701767 |work=BBC News |date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
[[Nazism]] promoted the idea of a superior [[Germanic people]] or [[Aryan race]] in [[Germany]] during the early 20th century. Notions of white supremacy and Aryan racial superiority were combined in the 19th century, with white supremacists maintaining the belief that white people were members of an Aryan "[[master race]]" which was superior to other races, particularly the [[Jews]], who were described as the "Semitic race", [[Slavs]], and [[Names of the Romani people|Gypsies]], which they associated with "cultural sterility". [[Arthur de Gobineau]], a French racial theorist and aristocrat, blamed the fall of the [[Ancien Régime|''ancien régime'']] in France on racial degeneracy caused by racial intermixing, which he argued had destroyed the "purity" of the Nordic or Germanic race. Gobineau's theories, which attracted a strong following in Germany, emphasized the existence of an irreconcilable polarity between Aryan or Germanic peoples and Jewish culture.&lt;ref&gt;Blamires, Cyprian; Jackson, Paul.

As the [[Nazi Party]]'s chief racial theorist, [[Alfred Rosenberg]] oversaw the construction of a human racial "ladder" that justified [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Hitler's racial and ethnic policies]]. Rosenberg promoted the [[Nordic theory]], which regarded [[Nordic race|Nordics]] as the "master race", superior to all others, including other Aryans (Indo-Europeans).&lt;ref&gt;Though Rosenberg does not use the word "master race". He uses the word "Herrenvolk" (i. e., ruling people) twice in his book ''The Myth'', first referring to the [[Amorite]]s (saying that [[Archibald Sayce|Sayce]] described them as fair skinned and blue eyed) and secondly quoting [[Victor Wallace Germains]]' description of the English in "The Truth about Kitchener". ("The Myth of the Twentieth Century") - Pages 26, 660 - 1930&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenberg got the racial term ''[[Untermensch]]'' from the title of [[Klansman]] [[Lothrop Stoddard]]'s 1922 book ''The Revolt Against Civilization: The Menace of the Under-man''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Stoddard, Lothrop| authorlink = Lothrop Stoddard| year = 1922| title = The Revolt Against Civilization: The Menace of the Under Man| publisher = [[Charles Scribner's Sons]]| location = New York| isbn =| url = https://archive.org/details/revoltagainstciv00stoduoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later adopted by the Nazis from that book's German version ''Der Kulturumsturz: Die Drohung des Untermenschen'' (1925).&lt;ref&gt;

A number of [[Southern Africa]]n nations experienced severe racial tension and conflict during global [[decolonization]], particularly as [[white Africans of European ancestry]] fought to protect their preferential social and political status.

==Academic use of the term==
The term ''white supremacy'' is used in academic studies of racial power to denote a system of structural or [[societal racism]] which privileges white people over others, regardless of the presence or the absence of racial hatred. White racial advantages occur at both a collective and an individual level (''[[ceteris paribus]]'', {{Nowrap|i. e.}}, when individuals are compared that do not relevantly differ except in ethnicity). Legal scholar Frances Lee Ansley explains this definition as follows:
{{quote|By "white supremacy" I do not mean to allude only to the self-conscious racism of white supremacist [[hate group]]s. I refer instead to a political, economic and cultural system in which whites overwhelmingly control power and material resources, conscious and unconscious ideas of white superiority and entitlement are widespread, and relations of white dominance and non-white subordination are daily reenacted across a broad array of institutions and social settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ansley|first=Frances Lee|title=Stirring the Ashes: Race, Class and the Future of Civil Rights Scholarship|journal=Cornell Law Review|year=1989|volume=74|pages=993ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Temple University Press | isbn = 978-1-56639-532-8 | editor1 = Richard Delgado |editor2= Jean Stefancic | last = Ansley | first = Frances Lee | title = Critical white studies: Looking behind the mirror | chapter = White supremacy (and what we should do about it) | date = 1997-06-29 | page = 592}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some [[anti-racism|anti-racist]] educators, such as Betita Martinez and the Challenging White Supremacy workshop, also use the term in this way. The term expresses historic continuities between a pre–[[civil rights movement]] era of open white supremacism and the current racial power structure of the United States. It also expresses the visceral impact of structural racism through "provocative and brutal" language that characterizes racism as "nefarious, global, systemic, and constant".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis US | isbn = 978-0-415-98980-0 | editor1 = Jeanette Davidson | editor2 = George Yancy | last = Davidson | first = Tim | title = Critical perspectives on Bell Hooks | chapter = bell hooks, white supremacy, and the academy | date = 2009-02-23 | page = 68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic users of the term sometimes prefer it to ''racism'' because it allows for a distinction to be drawn between racist feelings and white racial advantage or [[white privilege|privilege]].&lt;ref&gt;"Why is it so difficult for many white folks to understand that racism is oppressive not because white folks have prejudicial feelings about blacks (they could have such feelings and leave us alone) but because it is a system that promotes domination and subjugation?" {{Cite book | publisher = Turnaround Publisher Services Limited | isbn = 978-1-873262-02-3 | last = hooks | first = bell | title = Black Looks: Race and Representation | date = 2009-02-04 | page = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grillo and Wildman cite hooks to argue for the term ''racism/white supremacy'': "hooks writes that liberal whites do not see themselves as either prejudiced or interested in domination through coercion, and they do not acknowledge the ways in which they contribute to and benefit from the system of white privilege." {{Cite book | publisher = Temple University Press | isbn = 978-1-56639-532-8 | editor1 = Richard Delgado | editor2 = Jean Stefancic | last1 = Grillo | first1 = Trina |author2= Stephanie M.

The term's recent rise in popularity among [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] activists has been characterized by some as counterproductive. [[John McWhorter]], a specialist in language and race relations, has described its use as straying from its commonly accepted meaning to encompass less extreme issues, thereby cheapening the term and potentially derailing productive discussion.&lt;ref name="left language"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/left-language-right-language/|title=Left Language, Right Language|accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McWhorter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/4584161/white-supremacy/|title=The Difference Between Racial Bias and White Supremacy|website=TIME |last1=McWhorter|first1=John|accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://heterodoxacademy.org/2017/12/14/an-interview-with-john-mcwhorter/|title=An Interview with John McWhorter about Politics and Protest|date=2017-12-14|work=HeterodoxAcademy.org|access-date=2017-12-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political columnist [[Kevin Drum]] attributes the term's growing popularity to frequent use by [[Ta-Nehisi Coates]], describing it as a "terrible fad" which fails to convey nuance. He claims that the term should be reserved for those who are trying to promote the idea that whites are inherently superior to blacks and not used to characterize less blatantly racist beliefs or actions.&lt;ref name="MotherJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/11/lets-please-kill-white-supremacy-fad|title=Let's Be Careful With the "White Supremacy" Label|website=Mother Jones|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedersdorf"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/11/the-scourge-of-the-left-too-much-stigma-not-enough-persuasion/508961/|title='The Scourge of the Left': Too Much Stigma, Not Enough Persuasion|last=Friedersdorf|first=Conor|access-date=2016-12-04|language=en-US|newspaper=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the academic definition of white supremacy has been criticized by Conor Friedersdorf for the confusion it creates for the general public inasmuch as it differs from the more common dictionary definition; he argues that it is likely to alienate those it hopes to convince.&lt;ref name="Friedersdorf" /&gt;

==Ideologies and movements==
Supporters of [[Nordic race#Nordicism|Nordicism]] consider the "Nordic peoples" to be a superior race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nordicism|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nordicism|website=Merriam Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 19th century, white supremacy was attached to emerging theories of racial hierarchy. The German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] attributed cultural primacy to the white race:
{{quote|The highest civilization and culture, apart from the ancient [[Hinduism|Hindus]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the [[Brahman]]s, the [[Inca Empire|Incas]], and the rulers of the [[Polynesia|South Sea Islands]]. All this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schopenhauer | first = Arthur | authorlink = Arthur Schopenhauer | title = ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'' | year = 1851 | pages = Vol. 2, Section 92}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Good Citizen Pillar of Fire Church July 1926.jpg|thumb|''[[The Good Citizen]]'' 1926, published by [[Pillar of Fire International|Pillar of Fire Church]]]]

The [[eugenics|eugenicist]] [[Madison Grant]] argued in his 1916 book, ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'', that the Nordic race had been responsible for most of humanity's great achievements, and that [[Miscegenation|admixture]] was "race suicide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Grant | first = Madison | title = The Passing of the Great Race | publisher = C. Scribner's sons | year = 1921 | edition = 4 | page = xxxi | url = https://archive.org/stream/passingofgreatra00granuoft/passingofgreatra00granuoft_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this book, Europeans who are not of Germanic origin but have Nordic characteristics such as blonde/red hair and blue/green/gray eyes, were considered to be a Nordic admixture and suitable for [[Aryanization (Nazism)|Aryanization]].&lt;ref name="Grant1916"&gt;[[Madison Grant|Grant, Madison]] (1916).

[[File:Klan-in-gainesville.jpg|thumb|left|267px|Members of the second [[Ku Klux Klan]] at a rally in 1923.]]

In the United States, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) is the group most associated with the white supremacist movement. Many white supremacist groups are based on the concept of preserving genetic purity, and do not focus solely on [[discrimination]] based on skin color.&lt;ref name="law.jrank.org"&gt;http://law.jrank.org/pages/11302/White-Supremacy-Groups.html White Supremacy Groups&lt;/ref&gt; The KKK's reasons for supporting [[racial segregation]] are not primarily based on religious ideals, but some Klan groups are openly [[Protestantism|Protestant]]. The KKK and other white supremacist groups like [[Aryan Nations]], [[The Order (white supremacist group)|The Order]] and the [[White Patriot Party]] are considered [[Antisemitism in the United States|antisemitic]].&lt;ref name="law.jrank.org"/&gt;

[[Nazi Germany]] promulgated white supremacy based on the belief that the [[Aryan race]], or the Germans, were the ''[[master race]]''. It was combined with a [[Nazi eugenics|eugenics programme]] that aimed for [[racial hygiene]] through compulsory sterilization of sick individuals and extermination of [[Untermensch]]en ("subhumans"): [[Anti-Slavic sentiment|Slavs]], Jews and [[antiziganism|Romani]], which eventually culminated in [[the Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;Gumkowski, Janusz; Leszczynski, Kazimierz; Robert, Edward (translator) (1961).

Mitchell. Cultural Locations of Disability. University of Michigan Press. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian Identity]] is another movement closely tied to white supremacy. Some white supremacists identify themselves as [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Odinists]], although many Odinists reject white supremacy. Some white supremacist groups, such as the [[South Africa]]n [[Boeremag]], conflate elements of [[Christianity]] and Odinism. [[Creativity (religion)|Creativity]] (formerly known as "The World Church of the Creator") is [[atheism|atheistic]] and it denounces Christianity and other [[Theism|theistic religions]].&lt;ref name="Atheistic"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HB1wyFPRGm4C&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=atheism+white+supremacy#v=onepage&amp;q=atheistic&amp;f=false|title =The new white nationalism in America: its challenge to integration|publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]|quote=For instance, Ben Klassen, founder of the atheistic Church of the Creator and author of ''The White Man's Bible'', discusses Christianity extensively in his writings and denounces it as a religion that has brought untold horror into the world and has divided the white race.|accessdate = 2011-03-27|isbn =9780521808866|date =2002-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atheism"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rBgn3xB75ZcC&amp;pg=PA493&amp;dq=competing+atheistic+white+racist+movement#v=onepage&amp;q=competing%20atheistic%20white%20racist%20movement&amp;f=false|title =The World's Religions: Continuities and Transformations|publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|quote=A competing atheistic or panthestic white racist movement also appeared, which included the Church of the Creator/ Creativity (Gardell 2003: 129–34).|accessdate = 2011-03-27|isbn =9781135211004|date =2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from this, its ideology is similar to that of many Christian Identity groups because it believes in the [[List of conspiracy theories#Antisemitic conspiracy theories|antisemitic conspiracy theory]] that there is a "Jewish conspiracy" in control of governments, the banking industry and the media. [[Matthew F. Hale]], founder of the World Church of the Creator, has published articles stating that all races other than white are "mud races", which is what the group's religion teaches.&lt;ref name="law.jrank.org"/&gt;

The white supremacist ideology has become associated with a racist faction of the [[skinhead]] [[subculture]], despite the fact that when the skinhead culture first developed in the [[United Kingdom]] in the late 1960s, it was heavily influenced by black fashions and [[Black music|music]], especially [[Jamaica]]n [[reggae]] and [[ska]], and African American [[soul music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ska.about.com/musicperform/ska/library/1999/aa081699a.htm |title=Smiling Smash: An Interview with Cathal Smyth, a.k.a.

White supremacist recruitment activities are primarily conducted at a [[grassroots]] level as well as on the [[Internet]]. Widespread access to the Internet has led to a dramatic increase in white supremacist websites.&lt;ref name="Adversity"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=1Adams |first1=Josh |first2=Vincent J. |last2=Roscigno |title=White Supremacists, Oppositional Culture and the World Wide Web |work=University on North Carolina Press 84 (2005): 759–88 |date=20 November 2009 |jstor=3598477}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet provides a venue to openly express white supremacist ideas at little [[social cost]], because people who post the information are able to remain anonymous.
