      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18287">The '''avian immune system''' refers to the system of biological structures and cellular processes that protects [[birds]] from disease.

The avian [[immune system]] resembles that of [[mammals]] since both evolved from a common reptilian ancestor and have inherited many commonalities.&lt;ref&gt;Seto F (1981). “Early development of the avian immune system” Poult. Sci. 60(9).&lt;/ref&gt;  They have also developed a number of different strategies that are unique to birds. Most avian immunology research has been carried out on the [[domestic chicken]], ''Gallus gallus domesticus''.&lt;ref&gt;Baeuerle PA (1994). “Function and Activation of NF-kappaB in the Immune System” Annual Review of Immunology 12:1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Birds have [[lymphoid]] tissues, [[B cells]], [[T cells]], [[cytokines]] and chemokines like many other animals. In addition, they can also have [[tumours]], immune deficiency and autoimmune diseases.

== Overview ==

The physiology and immune system of birds resembles that of other animals. The lymphomyeloid tissues develop from epithelial or [[mesenchymal]] anlages that are full of haematopoetic cells.&lt;ref&gt;Fellah JS, Jaffredo T, Dunon D (2008). “Development of the Avian Immune System.” Avian Immunology. 4:51-66.&lt;/ref&gt;  The bursa fabricus, [[thymus]], [[spleen]] and [[lymph nodes]] all develop when haematopoetic stem cells enter the bursal or thymic anlages and become competent B and T cells.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Masteller EL, Pharr GT, Funk PE, Thompson CB (1997). “Avian B cell development.” Int. Rev. Immunol. 15(3-4): 185-206.&lt;/ref&gt;
The avian immune system is divided into two types of immunity, the [[Innate immune system|innate]] and [[Adaptive immune system|adaptive]] ones. The innate immune system includes physical and chemical barriers, [[blood proteins]] and [[phagocytic cells]]. In addition, [[Complement system|complement serum proteins]], which are a part of the innate immune system, work with antibodies to lyse target cell. Adaptive immunity, on the other hand, kicks in when the innate system fails to stop invading pathogens. The adaptive response includes targeted recognition of specific molecular features on the surface of the pathogen. Birds, like other animals, have [[B cells]], [[T cells]] and [[humoral immunity]] as part of their adaptive response.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins KA, Bean AG, Lowenthal JW (2007). “Avian genomics and the innate immune response to viruses.” Cytogenet. Genome Res. 117(1-4):207-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==

Various bird organs function to differentiate avian immune cells: the [[thymus]], [[Bursa of Fabricius]] and [[bone marrow]] are primary avian [[lymphoid organs]] whereas the [[spleen]], [[Mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue|mucosal associated lymphoid tissues]] (MALT), [[germinal centers]], and diffuse lymphoid tissues are secondary lymphoid organs. Birds do not have lymph nodes. The thymus, where T cells develop, is located in the neck of birds. The Bursa of Fabricius is an organ that is unique to birds and is the only site for B cell differentiation and maturation. Located in the rump of birds, this organ is full of stem cells and very active in young birds but atrophies after six months.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Ratcliffe MJH, Lisilla O, Pink JRL, Vainio O (2005). “Avian B cell precusors: surface immunoglobulin expression is an early, possibly bursa-independent event.” Eur. J. Immunol. 16(2): 129-133.&lt;/ref&gt;
Bronchial associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) and [[gut associated lymphoid tissue]] (GALT) are found along the [[bronchus]] and [[intestines]], respectively.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In the avian respiratory system, there are heterophils, which are an important part of bird immunity. Within the head, there is head associated lymphoid tissues (HALT) that contain the [[Harderian gland]], [[lacrimal gland]] and other structures in the [[larynx]] or [[nasopharynx]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The [[Harderian gland]] is located behind the eyeballs and is the major component of HALT. It contains a large number of plasma cells and is the main secretory body of [[antibodies]].&lt;ref&gt;Mobini B (2012). “Histological and histochemical studies on the Harderian gland in native chickens.” Veterinarni Medicina. 57(8):404-409.&lt;/ref&gt;
Alongside these primary and secondary lymphoid organs, there is also the lymphatic circulatory system of vessels and capillaries that communicate with the blood supply and transport the [[lymph fluid]] throughout the bird’s body.

=== T cells ===

The [[antigen recognition]] by T cells is a remarkable process dependent on the [[T cell receptor]] (TCR). The TCR is randomly generated and thus has extensive diversity in the peptides-[[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC]] complexes it can recognize. Using [[monoclonal]] antibodies that are specific for chicken T cell surface antigens, the development of T cells in birds is studied.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Chen CL, Bucy RP, Cooper MD (1990). “T cell differentiation in birds.” Semin Immunol. 2(1):79-86.&lt;/ref&gt; The differentiation pathways, functional processes and molecules of T cells are highly conserved in birds. However, there are some novel features of T cells that are unique to birds. These include a new lineage of cytoplasmic CD3+ lymphoid cells (TCR0 cells) and a T cell sublineage that expresses a different receptor isotypes (TCR3) generated exclusively in the thymus.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;
Homologues of the mammalian gamma, delta and alpha beta TCR (TCR1 and TCR2) are found in birds. However, a third TCR, called TCR3, has been found in avian T cell populations that lack both TCR1 and TCR2. These were found on all CD3+ T cells and were either [[CD4+]] or [[CD8+]]. This subset of T cells, as others, develops in the thymus and gets seeded throughout the body with the exception of the intestines.&lt;ref&gt;Char D, Sanchez P, Chen CL, Bucy RP, Cooper MD (1990). “A third sublineage of avian T cells can be identified with a T cell receptor-3-specific antibody.” J. Immunol. 145(11):3547-3555.&lt;/ref&gt;
The pattern of [[Co-stimulatory|accessory molecules]] expressed by avian T cells resembles mammalian [[T cells|α/β T cells]]. High CD8 expression precedes the dual expression of CD4 and CD8 but following [[clonal selection]] and expansion, avian T cells cease to express either CD4 or CD8.&lt;ref&gt;Viertlboeck B, Göbel TWF (2008). “Avian T cells: antigen recognition and lineages.” Avian Immunol. 6:91-105.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== B cells ===

The central organ for B cell development in birds is the [[Bursa of Fabricius]]. The function of the bursa was discovered when it was surgically removed from neonatal chicks and this led to an impaired antibody response to ''[[Salmonella typhimurium]]''. It is now clear that the bursa is the primary site of B cell lymphopoeisis and that avian B cell development has some unique properties compared to human or mouse models.&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser P, Rothwell L, Galyov EE, Barrow PA, Burnside J, Wigley P (2000). “Differential cytokine expression in avian cells response to invasion by Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis and Salmonella gallinarium.” Microbiol. 146(12):3217-3226.&lt;/ref&gt;
Almost all the B cell progenitors in the bursa of 4-day-old chickens express [[IgM]] on their cell surface. Studies have shown that B cells of 4 – 8 week old birds are derived from 2 – 4 allotypically committed precursor cells in each follicle. Bursal follicles are colonized by 2-5 pre-bursal stem cells and these undergo extensive proliferation after they are committed to an allotype. Expression of IgM is controlled by a biological clock as opposed to the bursal microenvironment. Moreover, the source of all B cells in adult birds was determined to be a population of self-renewing [[B cells|sIg+ B cells]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

== Development ==

In studying the development of the avian immune system, the [[embryo]] offers several advantages such as the availability of many embryos at precise stages of development and distinct B and T cell systems. Each population differentiates from a primary lymphoid organ: T cells in the thymus and B cells in the [[Bursa of Fabricius]]. Research has found that [[early feeding]] of hydrated nutritional supplements in chickens heavily affects the immune system development. This is often measured by weight of the [[Bursa of Fabricius]], improved resistance to disease and earlier appearance of [[IgA]].&lt;ref&gt;Dibner JJ, Knight CD, Kitchell ML, Atwell CA, Downs AC, Ivey EJ (1998). “Early feeding and development of the immune system in neonatal poultry.” J. Appl. Poult. Res. 7(4):425-436.&lt;/ref&gt;
Unlike other animals, newly hatched chicks are born with an incomplete immune system. Here, the [[amniotic fluid]] and yolk of the egg contain the maternal immunity to be passed on to the hatchling. Swallowing of the amniotic fluid during hatching confers immunity to these chicks until their immune system develops fully. In the first six weeks of the bird’s life, continuous gene conversion in the bursa completes the immune system. Upon hatch, birds do not have a library of genetic information for B cells to use for antibody production. Instead, B cells mature in the bursa during the first six weeks and then go on to seed other organs of the immune system. As a result, birds are highly susceptible to pathogens in the first few weeks after hatching. Research found that T cells from mature chickens proliferated extensively and produced high levels of [[Interleukin 2|IL-2]] and other [[cytokines]]. On the other hand, T cells from 24 hour-old chickens failed to proliferate and could not secrete cytokines.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Wallach M, Halabi A, Pillemer G, Sar-Shalom O, Mencher D, Gilad M, Bendheim U, Danforth HD, Augustine PC (1992). “Maternal immunization with gametocyte antigens as a means of providing protective immunity against Eimeria maxima in chickens.” Infect. Immunol. 60(5):2036-2039.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Davison F, Kaspers B, Schat KA (2008). “Avian Immunology.” {{ISBN|978-0-12-370634-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Gene conversion]] within the bursa leads to the development of antibodies that are diverse in their recognition ability.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Mammalian V, D and J gene segments allow for many combinations and therefore, yield a vast repertoire of antibodies. However, birds have only a single functional copy of the V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and J&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; genes for the Ig [[Immunoglobulin light chain|light chain]] and a single functional copy of the V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; and J&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; heavy chain genes. This results in a low diversity from gene rearrangements of Ig [[Immunoglobulin heavy chain|heavy]] and [[Immunoglobulin light chain|light chain]]s. However, clusters of [[pseudogenes]] upstream of the heavy and light gene Ig loci take part in somatic gene conversion – a process where [[pseudogenes]] replace the V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; genes.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; This diversifies the repertoire of bird antibodies.

== Avian innate immune system ==

Little is known about the [[innate immune system]] of birds. Most research has been focused on chickens due to the increased threat of [[viral diseases]] within the poultry population. The innate immune response is known to be essential for viral infection and as a result, the publication of the full chicken genome sequence is a source for identifying possible [[adjuvants]] and immunity genes.

== Unique features ==

=== Transfer of maternal immunity ===

Avian immunity begins to develop at the end of embryonic life but the majority of early immunity is obtained via passive acquisition of maternal antibodies. Such antibodies are found within the [[egg]] when it is laid and originated from the yolk of the egg. Kramer and Cho have shown [[immunoglobulins]] in both the egg white and in the embryo.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer TT, Cho HC (1970). “Transfer of immunoglobluins and antibodies in the hen’s egg.” Immunol. 19(1): 157–167.&lt;/ref&gt; Maternal [[IgA]] and [[IgM]] get transferred to the egg as it passes down the oviduct.

=== TTP ===

An important element of immune systems in various animals is the protein tristetraprolin (TTP). This plays a key [[anti-inflammatory]] role by regulating [[TNFα]]. Mouse models with TTP knockouts result in chronic and often deadly inflammation when exposed to small amounts of pathogen-associated molecular patterns ([[PAMPs]]). However, TTP and its homologs is altogether absent from birds. Avian genomes have been searched for similar sequences to TTP and bird cell lines have been exposed to foreign proteins and bacteria molecules known to stimulate TTP production but no evidence of TTP has been found. The missing protein poses a very different immune response regulation in birds as opposed to mammals, reptiles and amphibians.&lt;ref&gt;Lai WS, Stumpo DJ, Kennington EA, Burkholder AB, Ward JM, Fargo DL, Blackshear PJ (2013). “Life without TTP: Apparent absence of an important anti-inflammatory protein in birds.” AJP.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organs ===

The avian T cell population, like that of mammals develops in the [[thymus]]. However, the [[thymus]] in birds is a paired organ composed of many separated lobes of ovoid tissue in the neck. These are close to the [[vagus nerve]] and the [[jugular vein]] and are most active in young hatchlings. It is postulated that this organ is linked to erythropoeitic function and closely associated with the avian breeding cycle.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;Ciriaco E, Piñera PP, Diaz-Esnal B, Laura R (2003). “Age-related changes in the avian primary lymphoid organs (thymus and bursa of Fabricius.” Microsc. Res. Tech. 62(6):482-7.&lt;/ref&gt; The removal of the thymic lobes has been correlated to birds rejecting allogeneic skingrafts and delayed skin reactions.

The [[Bursa of Fabricius|bursa of Fabricus]] is a globular or spherical lymphoepithelial organ. The inner surface is littered with folds, which resemble [[Peyer's patch]]es in mammals and obscure the lumen. Its growth is correlated with the rapid body growth. It regresses and disappears about the time of sexual maturity. The bursa, as studied through [[bursectomy]] at different developmental stages, indicates sequential development of [[IgG]], [[IgM]] and [[IgA]].&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; The secondary (peripheral) lymphoid tissue also includes unique lymphoid nodules in the digestive tract and solitary nodules scattered throughout the body, a characteristic of avian species. Meanwhile, lymph nodes only occur in some water, marsh and shore species.&lt;ref&gt;Lillehoj HS, Trout JM (1996). “Avian gut-associated lymphoid tissues and intestinal immune responses to Eimeria parasites.” Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 9(3): 349–360.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diseases ==

Control of infectious disease is essential for the production of healthy poultry flocks. [[Vaccination]] programs have been used extensively in North American factory farming methods to induce avian immune responses against bird pathogens. These include Marek’s Disease, Duck Hepatitis Virus, Chicken Anemia Virus, [[Turkeypox]], [[Fowlpox]] and others.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; Bird immunity is reliant on a complex network of cell types and soluble factors that must properly function in order for large commercial poultry flocks to survive.

[[Infectious bursal disease virus]] and chicken anemia are ubiquitous and have increased interest in combatting avian pathogens. [[Parasites]] of birds are another emerging concern since the crowded nature of poultry farms facilitates easy spreading.

=== Immunosuppressive diseases ===

Several [[immunosuppressive]] agents are encountered by birds including [[viruses]], [[bacteria]], [[parasites]], [[toxins]], [[mycotoxins]], chemicals and drugs. The most common immunosuppressive viruses are [[Infectious bursal disease virus|Infectious Bursal Disease Virus]] (IBDV), [[Avian leukosis virus|Avian Leukosis]], Marek’s Disease (MD) and Hemorrhagic Enteritis Virus (HEV). Concurrent immunosuppressive infections are an emerging concern in the poultry industry whereby early infection with IBDV causes the MD virus to come out of dormancy and contribute to active disease. New studies show that stress is the number one cause of [[immunosuppression]] in birds.&lt;ref&gt;Yegani M et al. (2005) “Immunosuppression threat” World Poultry. 21(2):18-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Stressors leave birds more susceptible to infectious agents and therefore, new poultry management guidelines need to be endorsed.

=== Birds as vectors ===

The migratory nature of birds poses a distinct danger for the spreading of diseases. Without being affected by the infectious agent, birds can act as vectors in spreading [[psittacosis]], [[salmonellosis]], [[campylobacteriosis]], [[mycobacteriosis]], [[avian influenza]], [[giardiasis]] and [[cryptosporidiosis]]. These [[zoonotic diseases]] can be transmitted to humans.
In the case of [[avian influenza]] ([[H5N1]] strain), water birds can be infected with the low pathogenic form or the high pathogenic form. The former induces mild symptoms such as a drop in egg production, ruffled feathers and mild effects on the avian respiratory tract. The highly pathogenic form spreads much more rapidly and can infect multiple tissues and organs. Massive internal bleeding and [[hemorrhaging]] follow and this has earned the H5N1 virus the moniker “chicken ebola.”&lt;ref&gt;Beach RH, Poulos C, Pattanayak SK (2007). “Farm economics of bird flu.” Can. J. Agr. Eco. 55(4):471-483.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tumours ===

Much like other animals, birds are prone to cancers and [[tumours]]. This refers to the abnormal growth of cells in a tissue or organ that can be either [[malignant]] or [[benign]]. Internal cancers can occur in the [[kidneys]], [[liver]], [[stomach]], [[ovary]], [[muscles]] or [[bone]]. [[Squamous cell carcinoma]] is a form of skin cancer that birds obtain, manifesting on the wing tips, toes, and around the beak and eyes. The cause is believed to be high exposure to [[UV rays]]. Additionally, a cancer of the connective tissue, known as [[fibrosarcoma]], is often seen in the leg or wing. This occurs in many [[parrot]] species, [[cockatiels]], [[macaws]] and [[budgerigars]]. Treatment options include [[amputation]] and [[surgery]].&lt;ref&gt;Reavill DR (2004). “Tumors of pet birds.” Veterinary Clinics of North America. 7(3): 537-560.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Boston University College of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences: Sargent College''' ('''SAR''') is a unit of [[Boston University]]. The College offers both undergraduate and graduate degree programs to prepare students for both research and clinical careers in health care and the [[Physical therapy|rehabilitation]] sciences.

== History ==
In 1881, Dr. [[Dudley Allen Sargent]] founded the Sargent School of Physical Training in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bu.edu/sargent/about-us/our-history/ |title=Sargent College History |accessdate=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the decades that followed the establishment of the School, Dr. Sargent built a reputation as an innovator in physical conditioning and health promotion. At the Sargent School, students learned training techniques to strengthen and improve the physical capabilities of all people, including both disabled and healthy individuals. This emphasis on comprehensive health care remains a focus of the College today. Sargent College became part of Boston University in 1929, five years after Dr. Sargent's death.

In the fall of 1990, BU Sargent College moved to an extensively renovated facility at 635 Commonwealth Avenue. The six-story building contains classrooms, student lounges, research laboratories, an outpatient clinic, and faculty and staff offices.

== Areas of study ==
The Sargent College has four academic departments that confer degrees upon undergraduate and graduate students:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bu.edu/sargent/academics/departments/ |title=Sargent College academic departments |accessdate=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome''' ('''CAPS'''), also known as '''Asherson's syndrome''', is an [[Acute (medical)|acute]] and complex biological process that leads to [[Vascular occlusion|occlusion]] of small vessels of various organs. It was first described by [[Ronald Asherson]] in 1992. The syndrome exhibits [[thrombotic microangiopathy]], [[multiple organ thrombosis]], and in some cases  [[tissue necrosis]] and is considered an [[extreme value|extreme]] or catastrophic variant of the [[antiphospholipid syndrome]].

CAPS has a mortality rate of about 50%. With the establishment of a CAPS-Registry more has been learned about this syndrome, but its cause remains unknown. Infection, trauma, medication, and/or surgery can be identified in about half the cases as a "trigger". It is thought that cytokines are activated leading to a [[cytokine storm]] with the potentially fatal consequences of organ failure. A [[Thrombocytopenia|low platelet count]] is a common finding.  Individuals with CAPS often exhibit a positive test to antilipid antibodies, typically IgG, and may or may not have a history of [[lupus erythematosus|lupus]] or another [[connective tissue disease]].  Association with another disease such as lupus is called a secondary APS unless it includes the defining criteria for CAPS.

Clinically, the syndrome affects at least three organs and may affect many organs systems. Peripheral thrombosis may be encountered affecting veins and arteries. Intra-abdominal thrombosis may lead to pain. Cardiovascular, nervous, kidney, and lung system complications are common. The affected individual may exhibit skin [[purpura]] and necrosis. Cerebral manifestations may lead to [[encephalopathy]] and [[seizure]]s. [[Myocardial infarction]]s may occur. [[Stroke]]s may occur due to the arterial clotting involvement. Death may result from multiple organ failure.

Treatments may involve the following steps:
* Prevention includes the use of [[antibiotic]]s for infection and parenteral [[anticoagulation]] for susceptible patients.
* Specific therapy includes the use of  intravenous [[heparin]] and [[corticosteroid]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdconsult.com/das/pdxmd/body/141051084-2/0?type=med&amp;eid=9-u1.0-_1_mt_1011037 MD Consult] Retrieved on 2009-06-02&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly [[plasma exchange]]s, intravenous [[immunoglobulin]].
* Additional steps may have to be taken to manage circulatory problems, [[kidney failure]], and [[respiratory distress]].
* When maintaining survival of the disease treatments also include high doses of Rituxan (Rituximab) to maintain stability.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1784">Christian Medical Fellowship of Australia has its historical roots in the [[Inter Varsity Fellowship]] (IVF) and the [[Christian Medical Fellowship]] (CMF) that started in the [[UK]]. At the same time as many other similar groups were being set up around the world after [[World War II]], many separate Australian state fellowships of doctors and dentists were being founded.

These groups united as a national body in 1962 but it was not until 1998 that the Christian Medical and Dental Fellowship of Australia (CMDFA) was officially established. In 2000 the central office in Sydney opened to assist with growing administrative needs.

CMDFA is linked with the [[International christian medical and dental association]].

==Aims of CMDFA==
*To provide a Fellowship in which members may share and discuss their experience as [[Christians]] in the professions of medicine and dentistry.
*To encourage Christian doctors and dentists to realise their potential, serving and honouring [[God]] in their professional practice.
*To present the claims of [[Christ]] to colleagues and others and to win their allegiance to Him.
*To provide a forum to discuss the application of the [[Christian faith]] to the problems of national and local life as they relate to medicine and dentistry.
*To foster active interest in mission.
*To strengthen and encourage Christian medical and dental students in their faith.
*To encourage members to play a full part in the activities of their local [[local church|churches]].
*To provide pastoral support when appropriate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10597">In a [[clinical trial|clinical research trial]], a '''clinical endpoint''' generally refers to occurrence of a [[disease]], [[symptom]], [[Medical sign|sign]] or laboratory abnormality that constitutes one of the target outcomes of the trial, but may also refer to any such disease or sign that strongly motivates the withdrawal of that individual or entity from the trial, then often termed ''humane (clinical) endpoint''. {{clarify|date=February 2016}}

The '''primary endpoint''' of a clinical trial is the endpoint for which subjects are [[Random assignment|randomized]] and for which the trial is [[statistical power|powered]]. '''Secondary endpoints''' are endpoints that are analyzed ''post hoc'', for which the trial may not be powered nor randomized.

==Scope==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
In a general sense, a clinical endpoint is included in the entities of interest in a trial. The results of a clinical trial generally indicate the number of people enrolled who reached the pre-determined clinical endpoint during the study interval compared with the overall number of people who were enrolled.  Once a patient reaches the endpoint, he or she is generally excluded from further experimental intervention (the origin of the term ''endpoint'').

For example, a clinical trial investigating the ability of a [[medication]] to prevent [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] might use ''chest pain'' as a clinical endpoint.  Any patient enrolled in the trial who develops chest pain over the course of the trial, then, would be counted as having reached that clinical endpoint.   The results would ultimately reflect the fraction of patients who reached the endpoint of having developed chest pain, compared with the overall number of people enrolled.

When an experiment involves a [[control group]], the proportion of individuals who reach the clinical endpoint after an intervention is compared with the proportion of individuals in the control group who reached the same clinical endpoint, reflecting the ability of the intervention to prevent the endpoint in question.

A [[clinical trial]] will usually define or specify a ''primary endpoint'' as a measure that will be considered success of the therapy being trialled (e.g. in justifying a marketing approval). The primary endpoint might be a [[statistically significant]] improvement in ''overall survival'' (OS). A trial might also define one or more ''secondary endpoints'' such as ''[[Progression-free survival|progression-free-survival]]'' (PFS) that will be measured and are expected to be met. A trial might also define ''exploratory endpoints'' that are less likely to be met.

==Examples==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}

Clinical endpoints can be obtained from different modalities, such as, behavioural or cognitive scores, or [[biomarker]]s from [[Electroencephalography]] ([[Quantitative electroencephalography|qEEG]]), [[MRI]], [[Positron emission tomography|PET]], or biochemical biomarkers.

In clinical [[cancer research]], common endpoints include discovery of local recurrence, discovery of regional metastasis, discovery of distant metastasis, onset of symptoms, hospitalization, increase or decrease in pain medication requirement, onset of toxicity, requirement of salvage chemotherapy, requirement of salvage surgery, requirement of salvage radiotherapy, death from any cause or death from disease. A cancer study may be powered for overall survival, usually indicating time until death from any cause, or disease specific survival, where the endpoint is death from disease or death from toxicity.

These are expressed as a period of time (survival duration) e.g., in months.  Frequently the [[median]] is used so that the trial endpoint can be calculated once 50% of subjects have reached the endpoint, whereas calculation of an [[arithmetical mean]] can only be done after all subjects have reached the endpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=median overall survival|url=http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?cdrid=655248|website=NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms|publisher=National Cancere Institute|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disease free survival===
The disease free survival is usually used to analyze the results of the treatment for the localized disease which renders the patient apparently disease free, such as surgery or surgery plus adjuvant therapy. In the disease-free survival, the event is relapse rather than death. The people who relapse are still surviving but they are no longer disease-free. Just as in the survival curves not all patients die, in "disease-free survival curves" not all patients relapse and the curve may have a final plateau representing the patients who didn't relapse after the study's maximum follow-up. Because the patients survive for at least some time after the relapse, the curve for the actual survival would look better than disease free survival curve.

===Progression free survival===
The [[Progression-free survival|Progression Free Survival]] is usually used in analysing the results of the treatment for the advanced disease. The event for the progression free survival is that the disease gets worse or progresses, or the patient dies from any cause. ''Time to Progression'' is a similar endpoint that ignores patients who die before the disease progresses.

===Response duration===
The response duration is occasionally used to analyze the results of the treatment for the advanced disease. The event is progression of the disease (relapse). This endpoint involves selecting a subgroup of the patients. It measures the length of the response in those patients who responded. The patients who don't respond aren't included.

===Overall survival===
Overall survival is based on death from any cause, not just the condition being treated, thus it picks up death from side effects of the treatment, and effects on survival after relapse.

==Humane endpoint==
A humane endpoint can be defined as the point at which pain and/or distress is terminated, minimized or reduced for an entity in a trial (such as an [[experimental animal]]), by taking action such as killing the animal humanely, terminating a painful procedure, or giving treatment to relieve pain and/or distress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vet.uu.nl/nca/documents/humane_endpoints Humane Endpoints] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5RLI508Yg?url=http://www.vet.uu.nl/nca/documents/humane_endpoints |date=2007-08-24 }} From Netherlands Association for Laboratory Animal Science (NVP). Retrieved April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The occurrence of an individual in a trial having reached may necessitate withdrawal from the trial before the target outcome of interest has been fully reached.

==Surrogate endpoint==
A [[surrogate endpoint]] (or ''marker'') is a measure of effect of a certain treatment that may correlate with a ''real'' clinical endpoint but doesn't necessarily have a guaranteed relationship.  The [[National Institutes of Health]] (USA) define surrogate endpoint as "a biomarker intended to substitute for a clinical endpoint".&lt;ref&gt;Controlled Clinical Trials 22:485–502 (2001))&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cohn JN | title = Introduction to Surrogate Markers | journal = Circulation | volume = 109 | pages = IV20–1 | publisher = American Heart Association | year = 2004 | doi =  10.1161/01.CIR.0000133441.05780.1d | pmid=15226247 | issue = 25 Suppl 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Combined endpoint==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
Some studies will examine the incidence of a ''combined endpoint'', which can merge a variety of outcomes into one group.  For example, the heart attack study above may report the incidence of the ''combined endpoint'' of chest pain, [[myocardial infarction]], or death. An example of a cancer study powered for a combined endpoint is disease-free survival (DFS); trial participants experiencing either death or discovery of any recurrence would constitute the endpoint. Overall Treatment Utility is an example of a multidimensional composite endpoint in cancer clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=
Handforth C, Hall P, Marshall H, Seymour M|title=Overall treatment utility: A novel outcome measure to convey the balance of benefits and harms from cancer treatment|journal=journal of geriatric oncology|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jgo.2013.09.064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding humane endpoints, a combined endpoint may constitute a threshold where there is enough cumulative degree of disease, symptoms, signs or laboratory abnormalities to motivate an intervention.

==Response rates==
Each trial may define what is considered a '''complete response''' (CR) or '''partial response''' (PR) to the therapy or intervention. Hence the trials report the 'complete response rate' and the '''overall response rate''' which includes CR and PR. (e.g. see [[Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors]], and [[Small-cell carcinoma#Treatment]], and for immunotherapies : [[Immune-Related Response Criteria]])

==Consistency==
Various studies on a particular topic often do not address the same outcomes, making it difficult to draw clinically useful conclusions when a group of studies is looked at as a whole. The Core Outcomes in Women's Health (CROWN) Initiative is one effort to standardize outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The CROWN Initiative: journal editors invite researchers to develop core outcomes in women's health|journal=Human Reproduction Update|volume=20|issue=4|year=2014|pages=465–466|issn=1355-4786|doi=10.1093/humupd/dmu029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Familial partial lipodystrophy''' ('''FPL'''), also known as '''Köbberling–Dunnigan syndrome''',&lt;ref name="Bolognia"&gt;{{cite book |author=Rapini, Ronald P. |author2=Bolognia, Jean L. |author3=Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages=1541–2, 1543 |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a rare genetic metabolic condition characterized by the loss of [[subcutaneous tissues|subcutaneous fat]].&lt;ref name="Andrews"&gt;{{cite book |author=James, William D. |author2=Berger, Timothy G.|title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|495}}

FPL also refers to a rare metabolic condition in which there is a loss of subcutaneous fat in the arms, legs and lower torso. The upper section of the body, face, neck, shoulders, back and trunk carry an excess amount of fat.

As the body is unable to store fat correctly this leads to fat around all the vital organs and in the blood (triglycerides). This results in heart problems, cirrhosis of the liver, lipoatrophic diabetes, and pancreatitis, along with various other complications.

==Presentation ==

Type 1 is believed to be underdiagnosed.&lt;ref name="pmid12766116"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Herbst KL, Tannock LR, Deeb SS, Purnell JQ, Brunzell JD, Chait A |title=Köbberling type of familial partial lipodystrophy: an underrecognized syndrome |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=1819–24 |date=June 2003 |pmid=12766116 |doi= 10.2337/diacare.26.6.1819|url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12766116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics==

A mutations in a number of genes have been associated with this condition. [[Mutation]]s associated with FPL have been reported in ''[[LMNA]]'' (lamin A/C), ''[[PPARG]]'' (PPARγ), ''[[AKT2]]'' (AKT serine/threonine kinase 2), ''[[PLIN1]]'' (perilipin-1), and ''[[CIDEC]]'' (cell-death-inducing DFFA-like effector B).&lt;ref name="pmid21865368"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Garg A | title = Clinical review#: Lipodystrophies: genetic and acquired body fat disorders | journal = J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. | volume = 96 | issue = 11 | pages = 3313–25 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21865368 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2011-1159 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six types (1-6) have been described. Types 1-5 are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. 

Type 1 (Kobberling variety, FPL1) is very rare and has only been reported in women to date. Fat loss is confined to the limbs and mostly in the distal parts. Central obesity may be present. Complications include hypertension, insulin resistance and hypertriglyceridemia. The gene causing this condition is not yet known. This form was first described in 1975. 

Type 2 (Dunnigan Variety, FPL2) is the most common form and is due to mutations in the [[LMNA]] gene. Over 500 cases have been reported to date. Development up to puberty is normal. Fat is then gradually lost in is the limbs and trunk. Fat may accumulate around the face and between the shoulder blades. Insulin resistance is common. Other conditions associated with this condition include [[acanthosis nigricans]], fatty liver, hypertriglyceridemia and [[polycystic ovary syndrome]] in women. There is an increased risk of coronary heart disease. [[Cardiomyopathy]] and muscular dystrophy may occur rarely. [[Xanthoma]] and nail changes may occur. 

Type 3 is due to mutations in the [[PPARG]] gene. It is rare with approximately 30 cases reported to date. It is similar to type 2 but tends to be milder. 

Type 4 is due to mutations in the [[PLIN1]] gene. It is rare with only a small number of cases reported. Fat loss tends to affect the lower limbs and buttocks. Insulin resistance and hypertriglyceridemia occur. Calf muscular hypertrophy may occur. 

Type 5 is due to mutations in the [[AKT2]] gene. It has been reported in four patients all members of the same family. Fat loss affects the upper and lower limbs. The patients also suffered from hypertension, insulin resistance and hypertriglyceridemia. 

Type 6 due to mutations in the  [[CIDEC]] gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion and has been reported in only one patient to date. Features included  fat loss, severe insulin resistance, fatty liver, acanthosis nigricans and diabetes.

Another gene that has been associated with this condition is [[AGPAT2]].&lt;ref name=Broekema2018&gt;Broekema MF, Massink MPG, De Ligt J, Stigter ECA, Monajemi H, De Ridder J, Burgering BMT, van Haaften GW, Kalkhoven E (2018) A single complex Agpat2 allele in a patient With partial lipodystrophy.

The '''''Food and Drugs Act''''' (the ''Act'') (formal title "''An Act respecting food, drugs, cosmetics and therapeutic devices''") is an act of the [[Parliament of Canada]] regarding the production, [[import]], [[export]], transport across [[province]]s and sale of [[food]], [[approved drug|drugs]], [[contraceptive]] devices and [[cosmetics]] (including personal cleaning products such as [[soap]] and [[toothpaste]]). It was first passed in 1920 and most recently revised in 1985. It attempts to ensure that these products are safe, that their ingredients are disclosed and that drugs are effective and are not sold as food or cosmetics. It also states that cures for disease listed in Schedule A&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-27/FullText.html#h-24|title=Consolidated federal laws of canada, Food and Drugs Act|first=Legislative Services|last=Branch|website=laws-lois.justice.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; (including [[cancer]], [[obesity]], [[anxiety]], [[asthma]], [[Mood disorder|depression]], [[appendicitis]], and [[sexually transmitted disease]]s), cannot be advertised to the general public.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Background==
After the launch of the [[Health Canada|Federal Department of Health]] in 1919, the ''Food and Drugs Act'' was presented in late 1920. Rules and [[regulations]] developed under the ''Act'' established the requirements for licensing and creating drugs in Canada. The law granted the [[Minister of Health]] the right to cancel or suspend licenses of companies failing to comply with the requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/homologation-licensing/info-renseign/hist-eng.php|title=Brief History of Drug Regulation in Canada|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Food and Drugs Act'' was not significantly modified until 1947 when the foundations were laid for the current market today. In 1951, drug manufacturers were required to submit a file for each new drug prior to marketing their product. However, during the early 1960s, the drug [[thalidomide]], which had been approved to enter the market, resulted in the deaths of thousands of infants and severe birth defects in others when the drug was taken by women in early stages of pregnancy.

As a result of the problems caused by the drug [[thalidomide]], the ''Act'' was revisited and strengthened by [[Health Canada]]. The revised version placed new requirements on manufacturers to provide evidence for efficacy in seeking a [[Drug Identification Number|Notice of Compliance]], which must be obtained before any drug could be sold. The manufacturer must meet all the requirements before making any drug available to the public, but once the drug passes with no adverse reactions and without any changes needed to the [[Formulary (pharmacy)|drug's formula]], it may never be subjected to review by Health Canada again.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Some health advocates{{who|date=February 2017}} want post-approval surveillance to watch for unexpected problems.

==Part I==
Part I provides general interpretations of the terms, and provides details of each of the topics discussed on what the ''Act'' entails:
*Food
*Drugs
*Cosmetics
*Devices

==Part II==
Part II of the ''Act'' focuses the administration and the Enforcement that allows the government to intervene with the manufacturer.
It entails:
*Inspection, Seizure and forfeiture
*Analysis
*Power of the Minister
*Incorporation by Reference
*Regulations
*Interim Orders
*Marketing Authorization
*Offense and Punishment
*Exports

==Parts III and IV==
Parts III (enacted in 1961) and IV (enacted in 1969) provided for implementation of controls required by the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]]. Part III dealt with "controlled" drugs such as [[amphetamine]], [[methaqualone]], and [[phenmetrazine]], which have legitimate medical uses. Part IV focused on Schedule H "restricted drugs", those whose only legitimate use is for scientific research, such as the hallucinogens [[LSD]], [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]], and [[3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine|MDMA]]. These parts established eight classes of regulated substances, ranging from Schedules A to H.

The 1996 ''[[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act]]'' repealed Parts III and IV.

== 2008 Proposed Amendment ==
{{distinguish|text=the 2015 Anti-terror legislation: [[Bill C-51 (41st Canadian Parliament, 2nd Session)]]}}
On April 2008, an amendment to the ''Food and Drugs Act'', Canadian Bill C-51 was tabled in the House of Commons. The purpose of this bill was to modernize the regulatory system for foods and therapeutic products, to strengthen the oversight of the benefits and risks of therapeutic products throughout their life cycle, to support effective compliance and enforcement actions and to enable a greater transparency and openness of the regulatory system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Docid=3398126&amp;file=4|title=Government Bill (House of Commons) C-51 (39-2) - First Reading - An Act to amend the Food and Drugs Act and to make consequential amendments to other Acts - Parliament of Canada|website=www2.parl.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the proposed amendments are as follows:

*Illegalize the sale and importation of products that have knowingly been adulterated.
*Illegalize the sale of counterfeit therapeutic products.
*Clarify in the Food and Drugs Act the requirement of therapeutic products to have market authorization, which has been required by Health Canada for many years.

The bill has been subject to criticism due to a perception that the bill would illegalize all food and [[Natural Health Products]] by categorizing them as drug products.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Natural health products have not been regulated as drugs since the Natural Health Products Regulations were put into place on January 1, 2004. Health Canada has stated "The Natural Health Product Regulations, introduced in 2004, will continue to operate the same way under Bill C-51. Canadians will continue to have access to natural health products that are safe, effective and of high quality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthycanadians.ca/pr-rp/facts-c51-fiches_e.html|title=C-51 and the Regulation of Natural Health Products - Fast Facts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==

Heart failure is a [[pathophysiological]] state in which [[cardiac output]] is insufficient to meet the needs of the body and lungs.&lt;ref name=NICEChp1/&gt; The term "congestive heart failure"  is often used, as one of the common symptoms is [[wikt:congestion#Noun|congestion]], or build-up of fluid in a person's tissues and veins in the lungs or other parts of the body.&lt;ref name=NICEChp1/&gt; Specifically, congestion takes the form of [[water retention (medicine)|water retention]] and [[swelling (medical)|swelling]] ([[edema]]), both as [[peripheral edema]] (causing swollen limbs and feet) and as [[pulmonary edema]] (causing breathing difficulty), as well as [[ascites]] (swollen abdomen). This is a common problem in old age as a [[sequela|result]] of [[cardiovascular disease]], but it can happen at any age, [[hydrops fetalis|even in fetuses]].

The term "acute" is used to mean rapid onset, and "chronic" refers to long duration. Chronic heart failure is a long-term condition, usually kept stable by the treatment of symptoms. [[Acute decompensated heart failure]] is a worsening of chronic heart failure symptoms which can result in [[acute respiratory distress]].&lt;ref name="Jessup2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jessup M, Abraham WT, Casey DE, Feldman AM, Francis GS, Ganiats TG, Konstam MA, Mancini DM, Rahko PS, Silver MA, Stevenson LW, Yancy CW | display-authors = 6 | title = 2009 focused update: ACCF/AHA Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Heart Failure in Adults: a report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines: developed in collaboration with the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation | journal = Circulation | volume = 119 | issue = 14 | pages = 1977–2016 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 19324967 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.192064 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[High-output heart failure]] can occur when there is an increased cardiac output. The circulatory overload caused, can result in an increased left ventricular diastolic pressure which can develop into pulmonary congestion (pulmonary edema).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{DorlandsDict|nine/000953450|high-output heart failure}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heart failure is divided into two types based on [[ejection fraction]], which is the proportion of blood pumped out of the heart during a single contraction.&lt;ref name=HRS2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Ejection Fraction|url=http://www.hrsonline.org/Patient-Resources/The-Normal-Heart/Ejection-Fraction#axzz31jSSC7Uo|website=Heart Rhythm Society|access-date=7 June 2014|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502123346/http://www.hrsonline.org/Patient-Resources/The-Normal-Heart/Ejection-Fraction#axzz31jSSC7Uo|archive-date=2 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ejection fraction is given as a percentage with the normal range being between 50 and 75%.&lt;ref name=HRS2014/&gt; The two types are:

1) Heart failure due to reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Synonyms no longer recommended are "heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction" and "systolic heart failure". HFrEFe is associated with an ejection fraction of less than 40%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ejection Fraction Heart Failure Measurement |url= http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HeartFailure/SymptomsDiagnosisofHeartFailure/Ejection-Fraction-Heart-Failure-Measurement_UCM_306339_Article.jsp |website=American Heart Association|access-date=7 June 2014|date=Feb 11, 2014|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714140152/http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HeartFailure/SymptomsDiagnosisofHeartFailure/Ejection-Fraction-Heart-Failure-Measurement_UCM_306339_Article.jsp|archive-date=14 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2) [[Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction]] (HFpEF). Synonyms no longer recommended include "diastolic heart failure" and "heart failure with normal ejection fraction".&lt;ref name=NICEChp1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor2014/&gt; HFpEF occurs when the left ventricle contracts normally during systole, but the ventricle is stiff and does not relax normally during diastole, which impairs filling.&lt;ref name=NICEChp1/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==

[[File:Elevated JVP.JPG|thumb|upright=1.4|A man with congestive heart failure and marked [[jugular venous distension]].  External jugular vein marked by an arrow.]]
Heart failure symptoms are traditionally and somewhat arbitrarily divided into "left" and "right" sided, recognizing that the left and right ventricles of the heart supply different portions of the circulation. However, heart failure is not exclusively ''backward failure'' (in the part of the circulation which drains to the ventricle).

There are several other exceptions to a simple left-right division of heart failure symptoms. Additionally, the most common cause of right-sided heart failure is left-sided heart failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heart Failure: Signs and Symptoms|publisher=UCSF Medical Center|url=http://www.ucsfhealth.org/conditions/heart_failure/signs_and_symptoms.html|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407080141/http://www.ucsfhealth.org/conditions/heart_failure/signs_and_symptoms.html|archive-date=7 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is that patients commonly [[Presenting|present]] with both sets of signs and symptoms.

===Left-sided failure===

The left side of the heart is responsible for receiving oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pumping it forward to the [[circulatory system|systemic circulation]] (the rest of the body except for the [[pulmonary circulation]]). Failure of the left side of the heart causes blood to back up  (be congested) into the lungs, causing respiratory symptoms as well as fatigue due to insufficient supply of oxygenated blood. Common respiratory signs are [[tachypnea|increased rate of breathing]] and increased ''work'' of breathing (non-specific signs of respiratory distress). [[Rales]] or crackles, heard initially in the lung bases, and when severe, throughout the lung fields suggest the development of [[pulmonary edema]] (fluid in the [[alveoli]]). [[Cyanosis]] which suggests severe [[hypoxemia|low blood oxygen]], is a late sign of extremely severe pulmonary edema.

Additional signs indicating left ventricular failure include a laterally displaced [[apex beat]] (which occurs if the heart is enlarged) and a [[gallop rhythm]] (additional heart sounds) may be heard as a marker of increased blood flow or increased intra-cardiac pressure. [[Heart murmur]]s may indicate the presence of valvular heart disease, either as a cause (e.g. [[aortic stenosis]]) or as a result (e.g. [[mitral regurgitation]]) of the heart failure.

''Backward'' failure of the left ventricle causes congestion of the lungs' blood vessels, and so the symptoms are predominantly respiratory in nature. Backward failure can be subdivided into the failure of the left atrium, the left ventricle or both within the left circuit. The patient will have [[dyspnea]] (shortness of breath) on exertion and in severe cases, dyspnea at rest. Increasing breathlessness on lying flat, called [[orthopnea]], occurs. It is often measured in the number of pillows required to lie comfortably, and in orthopnea, the patient may resort to sleeping while sitting up. Another symptom of heart failure is [[paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea]]: a sudden nighttime attack of severe breathlessness, usually several hours after going to sleep. Easy [[fatigability]] and exercise intolerance are also common complaints related to respiratory compromise.

"[[Cardiac asthma]]" or [[wheezing]] may occur.

Compromise of left ventricular ''forward'' function may result in symptoms of poor systemic circulation such as [[dizziness]], [[confusion]] and cool extremities at rest.

===Right-sided failure===
[[File:Combinpedal.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Severe peripheral (pitting) edema]]

Right-sided heart failure is often caused by [[pulmonary heart disease]] (cor pulmonale), which is typically caused by difficulties of the [[pulmonary circulation]], such as [[pulmonary hypertension]] or [[pulmonic stenosis]].

Physical examination may reveal pitting peripheral [[edema]], [[ascites]], and [[hepatomegaly|liver enlargement]]. [[Jugular venous pressure]] is frequently assessed as a marker of fluid status, which can be accentuated by eliciting [[Abdominojugular test|hepatojugular reflux]]. If the right ventricular pressure is increased, a [[parasternal heave]] may be present, signifying the compensatory increase in contraction strength.

''Backward'' failure of the right ventricle leads to congestion of systemic capillaries. This generates excess fluid accumulation in the body. This causes swelling under the skin (termed [[peripheral edema]] or [[anasarca]]) and usually affects the dependent parts of the body first (causing foot and ankle swelling in people who are standing up, and [[Sacrum|sacral]] edema in people who are predominantly lying down). [[Nocturia]] (frequent nighttime urination) may occur when fluid from the legs is returned to the bloodstream while lying down at night. In progressively severe cases, [[ascites]] (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity causing swelling) and liver enlargement may develop. Significant liver congestion may result in impaired liver function ([[congestive hepatopathy]]), and jaundice and even [[coagulopathy]] (problems of decreased or increased blood clotting) may occur.

===Biventricular failure===

Dullness of the lung fields to [[percussion (medicine)|finger percussion]] and reduced breath sounds at the bases of the lung may suggest the development of a [[pleural effusion]] (fluid collection [[pleural cavity|between the lung and the chest wall]]). Though it can occur in isolated left- or right-sided heart failure, it is more common in biventricular failure because pleural veins drain into both the systemic and pulmonary venous systems. When unilateral, effusions are often right sided.

If a person with a failure of one ventricle lives long enough, it will tend to progress to failure of both ventricles. For example, left ventricular failure allows pulmonary edema and pulmonary hypertension to occur, which increase stress on the right ventricle. Right ventricular failure is not as deleterious to the other side, but neither is it harmless.

==Causes==

===Congestive heart failure===

Heart failure may also occur in situations of "high output" (termed "[[high-output heart failure]]"), where the amount of blood pumped is more than typical and the heart is unable to keep up.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This can occur in overload situations (blood or serum infusions), kidney diseases, chronic severe [[anemia]], [[beriberi]] (vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/[[thiamine]] deficiency), [[hyperthyroidism]], [[cirrhosis]], [[Paget's disease of bone|Paget's disease]], [[multiple myeloma]], [[arteriovenous fistula]]e, or [[arteriovenous malformation]]s.

Viral infections of the heart can lead to [[Myocarditis|inflammation of the muscular layer of the heart]] and subsequently contribute to the development of heart failure. [[Cardiomyopathy|Heart damage]] can predispose a person to develop heart failure later in life and has many causes including systemic viral infections (e.g., [[HIV/AIDS|HIV]]), [[chemotherapeutic agent]]s such as [[daunorubicin]], [[cyclophosphamide]], and [[trastuzumab]], and [[Substance abuse|abuse]] of drugs such as [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[cocaine]], and [[methamphetamine]]. An uncommon cause is exposure to certain toxins such as [[lead]] and [[cobalt]]. Additionally, infiltrative disorders such as [[amyloidosis]] and [[connective tissue disease]]s such as [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] have similar consequences. [[Obstructive sleep apnea]] (a condition of sleep wherein disordered breathing overlaps with obesity, hypertension, and/or diabetes) is regarded as an independent cause of heart failure.

===Acute decompensation===
{{main|Acute decompensated heart failure}}
[[File:Kerley-B-Linien.jpg|thumb|Kerley B lines in acute cardiac decompensation. The short, horizontal lines can be found everywhere in the right lung.]]
Chronic stable heart failure may easily decompensate. This most commonly results from an intercurrent illness (such as [[myocardial infarction]] (a heart attack), [[pneumonia]]), [[cardiac arrhythmia|abnormal heart rhythms]], uncontrolled [[hypertension]], or a patient's failure to maintain a fluid restriction, diet, or medication.&lt;ref name="OPTIMIZE-HF"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fonarow GC, Abraham WT, Albert NM, Stough WG, Gheorghiade M, Greenberg BH, O'Connor CM, Pieper K, Sun JL, Yancy CW, Young JB | display-authors = 6 | title = Factors identified as precipitating hospital admissions for heart failure and clinical outcomes: findings from OPTIMIZE-HF | journal = Archives of Internal Medicine | volume = 168 | issue = 8 | pages = 847–54 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18443260 | doi = 10.1001/archinte.168.8.847 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors that may worsen CHF include: anemia, hyperthyroidism, excessive fluid or salt intake, and medication such as [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAIDs]] and [[thiazolidinedione]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nieminen MS, Böhm M, Cowie MR, Drexler H, Filippatos GS, Jondeau G, Hasin Y, Lopez-Sendon J, Mebazaa A, Metra M, Rhodes A, Swedberg K, Priori SG, Garcia MA, Blanc JJ, Budaj A, Cowie MR, Dean V, Deckers J, Burgos EF, Lekakis J, Lindahl B, Mazzotta G, Morais J, Oto A, Smiseth OA, Garcia MA, Dickstein K, Albuquerque A, Conthe P, Crespo-Leiro M, Ferrari R, Follath F, Gavazzi A, Janssens U, Komajda M, Morais J, Moreno R, Singer M, Singh S, Tendera M, Thygesen K | display-authors = 6 | title = Executive summary of the guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of acute heart failure: the Task Force on Acute Heart Failure of the European Society of Cardiology | journal = European Heart Journal | volume = 26 | issue = 4 | pages = 384–416 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15681577 | doi = 10.1093/eurheartj/ehi044 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NSAIDs increase the risk twofold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhala N, Emberson J, Merhi A, Abramson S, Arber N, Baron JA, Bombardier C, Cannon C, Farkouh ME, FitzGerald GA, Goss P, Halls H, Hawk E, Hawkey C, Hennekens C, Hochberg M, Holland LE, Kearney PM, Laine L, Lanas A, Lance P, Laupacis A, Oates J, Patrono C, Schnitzer TJ, Solomon S, Tugwell P, Wilson K, Wittes J, Baigent C | display-authors = 6 | title = Vascular and upper gastrointestinal effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: meta-analyses of individual participant data from randomised trials | journal = Lancet | volume = 382 | issue = 9894 | pages = 769–79 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23726390 | pmc = 3778977 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60900-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medications===
A number of medications may cause or worsen the disease.

==Pathophysiology==
{{Main|Pathophysiology of heart failure}}
[[File:Right side heart failure.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|A comparison of healthy heart with contracted muscle (left) and a weakened heart with over-stretched muscle (right).]]
Heart failure is caused by any condition which reduces the efficiency of the heart muscle, through damage or overloading. As such, it can be caused by a wide number of conditions, including myocardial infarction (in which the heart muscle is [[ischemia|starved of oxygen]] and dies), hypertension (which increases the force of contraction needed to pump blood) and [[amyloidosis]] (in which misfolded proteins are deposited in the heart muscle, causing it to stiffen). Over time these increases in workload will produce changes to the heart itself:

The heart of a person with heart failure may have a reduced force of contraction due to overloading of the [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]. In a healthy heart, increased filling of the ventricle results in increased contraction force (by the [[Frank–Starling law of the heart]]) and thus a rise in [[cardiac output]]. In heart failure, this mechanism fails, as the ventricle is loaded with blood to the point where heart muscle contraction becomes less efficient. This is due to reduced ability to cross-link [[actin]] and [[myosin]] filaments in over-stretched heart muscle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Walter F. |last1=Boron |first2=Emile L. |last2=Boulpaep | name-list-format = vanc |title=Medical Physiology: A Cellular and Molecular Approach |publisher=Saunders |edition=Updated |year=2005  |isbn=978-0-7216-3256-8 |page=533 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
No system of diagnostic criteria has been agreed on as the [[Gold standard (test)|gold standard]] for heart failure. The [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] recommends measuring [[brain natriuretic peptide]] (BNP) followed by [[echocardiogram|ultrasound of the heart]] if positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dworzynski K, Roberts E, Ludman A, Mant J | title = Diagnosing and managing acute heart failure in adults: summary of NICE guidance | journal = BMJ | volume = 349 | pages = g5695 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25296764 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.g5695 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is recommended in those with [[shortness of breath]].&lt;ref name=ACC2017/&gt; In those with heart failure who worsen both a BNP and a troponin are recommended to help determine likely outcomes.&lt;ref name=ACC2017&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yancy CW, Jessup M, Bozkurt B, Butler J, Casey DE, Colvin MM, Drazner MH, Filippatos GS, Fonarow GC, Givertz MM, Hollenberg SM, Lindenfeld J, Masoudi FA, McBride PE, Peterson PN, Stevenson LW, Westlake C | display-authors = 6 | title = 2017 ACC/AHA/HFSA Focused Update of the 2013 ACCF/AHA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure: A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines and the Heart Failure Society of America | journal = Circulation | volume = 136 | issue = 6 | pages = e137–e161 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28455343 | doi = 10.1161/CIR.0000000000000509 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultrasound===

[[Echocardiography]] is commonly used to support a clinical diagnosis of heart failure. This modality uses [[ultrasound]] to determine the [[stroke volume]] (SV, the amount of blood in the heart that exits the ventricles with each beat), the [[end-diastolic volume]] (EDV, the total amount of blood at the end of diastole), and the SV in proportion to the EDV, a value known as the ''[[ejection fraction]]'' (EF). In pediatrics, the [[shortening fraction]] is the preferred measure of systolic function. Normally, the EF should be between 50% and 70%; in systolic heart failure, it drops below 40%. Echocardiography can also identify valvular heart disease and assess the state of the [[pericardium]] (the connective tissue sac surrounding the heart). Echocardiography may also aid in deciding what treatments will help the patient, such as medication, insertion of an [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillator]] or [[cardiac resynchronization therapy]]. Echocardiography can also help determine if acute myocardial ischemia is the precipitating cause, and may manifest as regional wall motion abnormalities on echo.

===Chest X-ray===
[[File:Chest radiograph with signs of congestive heart failure - annotated.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Chest radiograph]] of a lung with distinct [[Kerley lines|Kerley B lines]], as well as an [[Cardiomegaly|enlarged heart]] (as shown by an increased [[cardiothoracic ratio]], cephalization of pulmonary veins, and minor [[pleural effusion]] as seen for example in the right [[Horizontal fissure of right lung|horizontal fissure]]. Yet, there is no obvious lung edema. Overall, this indicates intermediate severity (stage II) heart failure.]]
[[Chest X-ray]]s are frequently used to aid in the diagnosis of CHF. In a person who is compensated, this may show [[cardiomegaly]] (visible enlargement of the heart), quantified as the [[cardiothoracic ratio]] (proportion of the heart size to the chest). In left ventricular failure, there may be evidence of vascular redistribution ("upper lobe blood diversion" or "cephalization"), [[Kerley lines]], [[peribronchial cuffing|cuffing of the areas around]] the [[bronchi]], and interstitial edema. Ultrasound of the lung may also be able to detect Kerley lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Al Deeb M, Barbic S, Featherstone R, Dankoff J, Barbic D | title = Point-of-care ultrasonography for the diagnosis of acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema in patients presenting with acute dyspnea: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Academic Emergency Medicine | volume = 21 | issue = 8 | pages = 843–52 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 25176151 | doi = 10.1111/acem.12435 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Electrophysiology===

An [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG/EKG) may be used to identify arrhythmias, [[ischemic heart disease]], [[Right ventricular hypertrophy|right]] and [[left ventricular hypertrophy]], and presence of conduction delay or abnormalities (e.g. [[left bundle branch block]]). Although these findings are not specific to the diagnosis of heart failure a normal ECG virtually excludes left ventricular systolic dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Loscalzo | first1 = Joseph | last2 = Fauci | first2 = Anthony S. | last3 = Braunwald | first3 = Eugene | first4 = Dennis L. | last4 = Kasper | last5 = Hauser | first5 = Stephen L | last6 = Longo | first6 = Dan L. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine |edition=17 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical |year=2008 |page=1447 |isbn=978-0-07-147693-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blood tests===

[[Blood test]]s routinely performed include [[electrolyte]]s ([[sodium]], [[potassium]]), measures of [[kidney function]], [[liver function tests]], [[thyroid function test]]s, a [[complete blood count]], and often [[C-reactive protein]] if infection is suspected. An elevated [[Brain natriuretic peptide|B-type natriuretic peptide]] (BNP) is a specific test indicative of heart failure. Additionally, BNP can be used to differentiate between causes of dyspnea due to heart failure from other causes of dyspnea. If myocardial infarction is suspected, various [[cardiac marker]]s may be used.

BNP is a better indicator than N-terminal pro-BNP (NTproBNP) for the diagnosis of symptomatic heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. In symptomatic patients, BNP had a [[Sensitivity and specificity#Sensitivity|sensitivity]] of 85% and [[Sensitivity and specificity#Specificity|specificity]] of 84% in detecting heart failure; performance declined with increasing patient age.&lt;ref name="pmid18290826"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ewald B, Ewald D, Thakkinstian A, Attia J | title = Meta-analysis of B type natriuretic peptide and N-terminal pro B natriuretic peptide in the diagnosis of clinical heart failure and population screening for left ventricular systolic dysfunction | journal = Internal Medicine Journal | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | pages = 101–13 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18290826 | doi = 10.1111/j.1445-5994.2007.01454.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hyponatremia]] (low serum sodium concentration) is common in heart failure. [[Vasopressin]] levels are usually increased, along with renin, angiotensin II, and catecholamines in order to compensate for reduced circulating volume due to inadequate cardiac output. This leads to increased fluid and sodium retention in the body; the rate of fluid retention is higher than the rate of sodium retention in the body, this phenomenon causes "hypervolemic hyponatremia" (low sodium concentration due to high body fluid retention). This phenomenon is more common in older women with low body mass. Severe hyponatremia can result in accumulation of fluid in the brain, causing [[cerebral oedema]] and [[intracranial haemorrhage]].&lt;ref name="US cardiology 2008"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Abraham WT |title=Managing hyponatremia in heart failure |journal=US Cardiology Review |date=2008 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=57–60 |url=https://www.uscjournal.com/articles/managing-hyponatremia-heart-failure |access-date=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Angiography===

[[Angiography]] is the [[X-ray]] imaging of [[blood vessel]]s which is done by injecting contrast agents into the [[Circulatory system|bloodstream]] through a thin plastic tube ([[catheter]]) which is placed directly in the blood vessel. X-ray images are called angiograms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insideradiology.com.au/angiography/|title=Angiography – Consumer Information – InsideRadiology|date=2016-09-23|work=InsideRadiology|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822134640/https://www.insideradiology.com.au/angiography/|archive-date=22 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heart failure may be the result of coronary artery disease, and its prognosis depends in part on the ability of the [[coronary artery|coronary arteries]] to supply blood to the [[myocardium]] (heart muscle). As a result, [[coronary catheterization]] may be used to identify possibilities for revascularisation through [[percutaneous coronary intervention]] or [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|bypass surgery]].

===Monitoring===

Various measures are often used to assess the progress of patients being treated for heart failure. These include [[fluid balance]] (calculation of fluid intake and excretion), monitoring [[body weight]] (which in the shorter term reflects fluid shifts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yu CM, Wang L, Chau E, Chan RH, Kong SL, Tang MO, Christensen J, Stadler RW, Lau CP | display-authors = 6 | title = Intrathoracic impedance monitoring in patients with heart failure: correlation with fluid status and feasibility of early warning preceding hospitalization | journal = Circulation | volume = 112 | issue = 6 | pages = 841–8 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16061743 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.104.492207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Remote monitoring can be effective to reduce complications for people with heart failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bashi N, Karunanithi M, Fatehi F, Ding H, Walters D | title = Remote Monitoring of Patients With Heart Failure: An Overview of Systematic Reviews | journal = Journal of Medical Internet Research | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = e18 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 28108430 | pmc = 5291866 | doi = 10.2196/jmir.6571 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Inglis SC, Clark RA, Dierckx R, Prieto-Merino D, Cleland JG | title = Structured telephone support or non-invasive telemonitoring for patients with heart failure | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 10 | pages = CD007228 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26517969 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007228.pub3 | hdl = 2328/35732 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification===

There are many different ways to categorize heart failure, including:

* the side of the heart involved (left heart failure versus right heart failure). Right heart failure compromises pulmonary flow to the lungs. Left heart failure compromises aortic flow to the body and brain. Mixed presentations are common; left heart failure often leads to right heart failure in the longer term.
* whether the abnormality is due to insufficient [[Muscle contraction|contraction]] ([[systolic dysfunction]]), or due to insufficient relaxation of the heart ([[diastolic dysfunction]]), or to both.
* whether the problem is primarily increased venous back pressure ([[Preload (cardiology)|preload]]), or failure to supply adequate arterial perfusion ([[afterload]]).
* whether the abnormality is due to low cardiac output with high [[systemic vascular resistance]] or high cardiac output with low vascular resistance (low-output heart failure vs. high-output heart failure).
* the degree of functional impairment conferred by the abnormality (as reflected in the [[New York Heart Association Functional Classification]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Criteria Committee, New York Heart Association |title=Diseases of the heart and blood vessels. Nomenclature and criteria for diagnosis |publisher=Little, Brown |location=Boston |year=1964 |page=114 |edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* the degree of coexisting illness: i.e. heart failure/systemic hypertension, heart failure/pulmonary hypertension, heart failure/diabetes, heart failure/kidney failure, etc.
''Functional'' classification generally relies on the New York Heart Association functional classification. The classes (I-IV) are:
* Class I: no limitation is experienced in any activities; there are no symptoms from ordinary activities.
* Class II: slight, mild limitation of activity; the patient is comfortable at rest or with mild exertion.
* Class III: marked limitation of any activity; the patient is comfortable only at rest.
* Class IV: any physical activity brings on discomfort and symptoms occur at rest.
This score documents the severity of symptoms and can be used to assess response to treatment. While its use is widespread, the NYHA score is not very reproducible and does not reliably predict the walking distance or exercise tolerance on formal testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Raphael C, Briscoe C, Davies J, Ian Whinnett Z, Manisty C, Sutton R, Mayet J, Francis DP | title = Limitations of the New York Heart Association functional classification system and self-reported walking distances in chronic heart failure | journal = Heart | volume = 93 | issue = 4 | pages = 476–82 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17005715 | pmc = 1861501 | doi = 10.1136/hrt.2006.089656 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 2001 guidelines the [[American College of Cardiology]]/[[American Heart Association]] working group introduced four stages of heart failure:&lt;ref name="Hunt-2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hunt SA, Abraham WT, Chin MH, Feldman AM, Francis GS, Ganiats TG, Jessup M, Konstam MA, Mancini DM, Michl K, Oates JA, Rahko PS, Silver MA, Stevenson LW, Yancy CW, Antman EM, Smith SC, Adams CD, Anderson JL, Faxon DP, Fuster V, Halperin JL, Hiratzka LF, Jacobs AK, Nishimura R, Ornato JP, Page RL, Riegel B | display-authors = 6 | title = ACC/AHA 2005 Guideline Update for the Diagnosis and Management of Chronic Heart Failure in the Adult: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines (Writing Committee to Update the 2001 Guidelines for the Evaluation and Management of Heart Failure): developed in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society | journal = Circulation | volume = 112 | issue = 12 | pages = e154–235 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 16160202 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.167586 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Stage A: Patients at high risk for developing HF in the future but no functional or structural heart disorder.
* Stage B: a structural heart disorder but no symptoms at any stage.
* Stage C: previous or current symptoms of heart failure in the context of an underlying structural heart problem, but managed with medical treatment.
* Stage D: advanced disease requiring hospital-based support, a heart transplant or [[palliative care]].

The ACC staging system is useful in that Stage A encompasses "pre-heart failure" – a stage where intervention with treatment can presumably prevent progression to overt symptoms. ACC Stage A does not have a corresponding NYHA class. ACC Stage B would correspond to NYHA Class I. ACC Stage C corresponds to NYHA Class II and III, while ACC Stage D overlaps with NYHA Class IV.

===Algorithms===

There are various [[algorithm]]s for the diagnosis of heart failure. For example, the algorithm used by the [[Framingham Heart Study]] adds together criteria mainly from physical examination. In contrast, the more extensive algorithm by the [[European Society of Cardiology]] (ESC) weights the difference between supporting and opposing parameters from the [[medical history]], [[physical examination]], further medical tests as well as response to therapy.

====Framingham criteria====

By the Framingham criteria, diagnosis of congestive heart failure (heart failure with impaired pumping capability)&lt;ref name="dorlandsNine"&gt;{{DorlandsDict|nine/000953448|congestive heart failure}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires the simultaneous presence of at least 2 of the following major criteria or 1 major criterion in conjunction with 2 of the following minor criteria. Major criteria include an [[Cardiomegaly|enlarged heart]] on a [[chest radiography|chest x-ray]], an S3 gallop (a [[third heart sound]]), [[acute pulmonary edema]], [[paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea|episodes of waking up from sleep gasping for air]], [[crackles]] on lung [[auscultation]], [[central venous pressure]] of more than 16&amp;nbsp;cm {{chem|H|2|O}} at the right atrium, [[jugular vein distension]], positive [[abdominojugular test]], and [[weight loss]] of more than 4.5&amp;nbsp;kg in 5 days in response to treatment (sometimes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Gusbi O | title = Topic Review - Heart Failure | date = January 2002 | work = Albany Medical Review | url = http://www.amc.edu/amr/archives/200201/review01.html | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120719061429/http://www.amc.edu/amr/archives/200201/review01.html | archive-date = 19 July 2012 | dead-url = yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; classified as a minor criterion).&lt;ref name=medicalcriteria&gt;{{cite web |title=Framingham Criteria for Congestive Heart Failure |year=2005 |publisher=MedicalCRITERIA.com |url=http://www.medicalcriteria.com/criteria/framingham.htm |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008144224/http://medicalcriteria.com/criteria/framingham.htm |archive-date=8 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }} In turn citing: {{harvnb|Framingham study|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minor criteria include an [[tachycardia|abnormally fast heart rate]] of more than 120 beats per minute, [[nocturnal cough]], [[dyspnea|difficulty breathing]] with physical activity, [[pleural effusion]], a decrease in the [[vital capacity]] by one third from maximum recorded, [[hepatomegaly|liver enlargement]], and bilateral [[ankle edema|ankle swelling]].&lt;ref name=medicalcriteria/&gt;

Minor criteria are acceptable only if they can not be attributed to another medical condition such as [[pulmonary hypertension]], [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|chronic lung disease]], [[cirrhosis]], [[ascites]], or the [[nephrotic syndrome]].&lt;ref name=medicalcriteria/&gt; The Framingham Heart Study criteria are 100% sensitive and 78% specific for identifying persons with definite congestive heart failure.&lt;ref name=medicalcriteria/&gt;

===Misconceptions===

There are several terms which are closely related to heart failure and may be the cause of heart failure, but should not be confused with it. [[Cardiac arrest]] and [[asystole]] refer to situations in which there is ''no'' cardiac output at all. Without urgent treatment, these result in sudden death. [[Myocardial infarction]] ("Heart attack") refers to heart muscle damage due to insufficient blood supply, usually as a result of a blocked [[coronary artery]]. [[Cardiomyopathy]] refers specifically to problems within the heart muscle, and these problems can result in heart failure. Ischemic cardiomyopathy implies that the cause of muscle damage is [[coronary artery disease]]. [[Dilated cardiomyopathy]] implies that the muscle damage has resulted in enlargement of the heart. [[Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]] involves enlargement and ''thickening'' of the heart muscle.

==Prevention==
A person's risk of developing heart failure is inversely related to their level of [[Physical exercise|physical activity]]. Those who achieved at least 500 [[metabolic equivalent|MET-minutes/week]] (the recommended minimum by U.S. guidelines) had lower heart failure risk than individuals who did not report exercising during their free time; the reduction in heart failure risk was even greater in those who engaged in higher levels of physical activity than the recommended minimum.&lt;ref name=Pandey2015&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pandey A, Garg S, Khunger M, Darden D, Ayers C, Kumbhani DJ, Mayo HG, de Lemos JA, Berry JD | display-authors = 6 | title = Dose-Response Relationship Between Physical Activity and Risk of Heart Failure: A Meta-Analysis | journal = Circulation | volume = 132 | issue = 19 | pages = 1786–94 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26438781 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.015853 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Heart failure can also be prevented by lowering high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and controlling diabetes. Also, remaining at the right weight and reducing obesity can help. Lowering salt, alcohol, quitting smoking, and lowering sugar intake may help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/heart-failure/tc/heart-failure-prevention|title=Heart Failure: Am I at Risk, and Can I Prevent It?|website=Webmd.com|access-date=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
{{main|Management of heart failure}}
Treatment focuses on improving the symptoms and preventing the progression of the disease.  Reversible causes of the heart failure also need to be addressed (e.g. [[infection]], [[alcohol]] ingestion, anemia, [[thyrotoxicosis]], [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]], hypertension). Treatments include lifestyle and pharmacological modalities, and occasionally various forms of device therapy and rarely cardiac transplantation.

===Acute decompensation===
{{main|Acute decompensated heart failure}}
In [[acute decompensated heart failure]] (ADHF), the immediate goal is to re-establish adequate perfusion and oxygen delivery to end organs. This entails ensuring that [[ABC (medicine)|airway, breathing, and circulation]] are adequate.  Immediate treatments usually involve some combination of vasodilators such as [[nitroglycerin (medicine)|nitroglycerin]], diuretics such as [[furosemide]], and possibly [[noninvasive positive pressure ventilation]] (NIPPV). [[Oxygen therapy|Supplemental oxygen]] is indicated in those with oxygen saturation levels below 90% but is not recommended in those with normal oxygen levels on room air.&lt;ref name=Pre2018&gt;{{cite journal |title=Acute heart failure with dyspnoea.

===Chronic management===

The goals of treatment for people with chronic heart failure are the prolongation of life, the prevention of acute decompensation and the reduction of symptoms, allowing for greater activity.

Heart failure can result from a variety of conditions. In considering therapeutic options, it is important to first exclude reversible causes, including [[thyroid disease]], [[anemia]], chronic [[tachycardia]], [[alcohol abuse]], [[hypertension]] and dysfunction of one or more [[heart valves]]. Treatment of the underlying cause is usually the first approach to treating heart failure. However, in the majority of cases, either no primary cause is found or treatment of the primary cause does not restore normal heart function. In these cases, [[behavioral treatments|behavioral]], [[Medical treatment|medical]] and [[medical device|device]] treatment strategies exist which can provide a significant improvement in outcomes, including the relief of symptoms, exercise tolerance, and a decrease in the likelihood of [[hospitalization]] or death. Breathlessness rehabilitation for [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD) and heart failure has been proposed with exercise training as a core component. Rehabilitation should also include other interventions to address shortness of breath including psychological and education needs of patients and needs of carers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Man WD, Chowdhury F, Taylor RS, Evans RA, Doherty P, Singh SJ, Booth S, Thomason D, Andrews D, Lee C, Hanna J, Morgan MD, Bell D, Cowie MR | display-authors = 6 | title = Building consensus for provision of breathlessness rehabilitation for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic heart failure | journal = Chronic Respiratory Disease | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 229–39 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27072018 | pmc = 5029782 | doi = 10.1177/1479972316642363 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lifestyle====
Behavioral modification is a primary consideration in chronic heart failure management program, with [[dietary guidelines]] regarding [[Drinking water|fluid]] and [[Sodium chloride|salt]] intake.&lt;ref name="hf-prevention lifestyle"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HeartFailure/PreventionTreatmentofHeartFailure/Lifestyle-Changes-for-Heart-Failure_UCM_306341_Article.jsp |title=Lifestyle Changes for Heart Failure |publisher=[[American Heart Association]] |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503123439/http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HeartFailure/PreventionTreatmentofHeartFailure/Lifestyle-Changes-for-Heart-Failure_UCM_306341_Article.jsp |archive-date=3 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluid restriction is important to reduce fluid retention in the body and to correct the hyponatremic status of the body.&lt;ref name="US cardiology 2008"/&gt; The evidence of benefit of reducing salt however is poor as of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mahtani KR, Heneghan C, Onakpoya I, Tierney S, Aronson JK, Roberts N, Hobbs FD, Nunan D | display-authors = 6 | title = Reduced Salt Intake for Heart Failure: A Systematic Review | journal = JAMA Internal Medicine | date = November 2018 | pmid = 30398532 | doi = 10.1001/jamainternmed.2018.4673 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exercise should be encouraged and tailored to suit individual capabilities. The inclusion of regular physical conditioning as part of a cardiac rehabilitation program can significantly improve [[quality of life]] and reduce the risk of hospital admission for worsening symptoms; however, there is no evidence for a reduction in mortality rates as a result of exercise.  Furthermore, it is not clear whether this evidence can be extended to people with [[heart failure with preserved ejection fraction]] (HFpEF) or to those whose exercise regimen takes place entirely at home.&lt;ref name=Taylor2014 /&gt;

Home visits and regular monitoring at heart failure clinics reduce the need for hospitalization and improve [[life expectancy]].&lt;ref name="Feltner 2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Feltner C, Jones CD, Cené CW, Zheng ZJ, Sueta CA, Coker-Schwimmer EJ, Arvanitis M, Lohr KN, Middleton JC, Jonas DE | display-authors = 6 | title = Transitional care interventions to prevent readmissions for persons with heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 160 | issue = 11 | pages = 774–84 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24862840 | doi = 10.7326/M14-0083 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medication====
First-line therapy for people with heart failure due to reduced systolic function should include [[ACE inhibitor|angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors]] (ACE-I) or [[angiotensin receptor blocker]]s (ARBs) if the person develops a long term cough as a side effect of the ACE-I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goljan |first1=Edward F. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Rapid Review Pathology |edition = 4th |location=Philadelphia, PA |publisher=Saunders/Elsevier |date=2014 |isbn=978-0-323-08787-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of medicines from this class is associated with improved survival and quality of life in people with heart failure.&lt;ref name=NICECG108&gt;{{NICE|108|Chronic heart failure – Management of chronic heart failure in adults in primary and secondary care | August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[beta blockers|Beta-adrenergic blocking agents]] (beta blockers) also form part of the first line of treatment, adding to the improvement in symptoms and [[Case fatality rate|mortality]] provided by ACE-I/ARB.&lt;ref name=NICECG108 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kotecha D, Manzano L, Krum H, Rosano G, Holmes J, Altman DG, Collins PD, Packer M, Wikstrand J, Coats AJ, Cleland JG, Kirchhof P, von Lueder TG, Rigby AS, Andersson B, Lip GY, van Veldhuisen DJ, Shibata MC, Wedel H, Böhm M, Flather MD | display-authors = 6 | title = Effect of age and sex on efficacy and tolerability of β blockers in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: individual patient data meta-analysis | journal = BMJ | volume = 353 | pages = i1855 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 27098105 | pmc = 4849174 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.i1855 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mortality benefits of beta blockers in people with systolic dysfunction who also have [[atrial fibrillation]] (AF) is more limited than in those who do not have AF.&lt;ref name="Kotecha 2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kotecha D, Holmes J, Krum H, Altman DG, Manzano L, Cleland JG, Lip GY, Coats AJ, Andersson B, Kirchhof P, von Lueder TG, Wedel H, Rosano G, Shibata MC, Rigby A, Flather MD | display-authors = 6 | title = Efficacy of β blockers in patients with heart failure plus atrial fibrillation: an individual-patient data meta-analysis | journal = Lancet | volume = 384 | issue = 9961 | pages = 2235–43 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25193873 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61373-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the ejection fraction is not diminished (HFpEF), the benefits of beta blockers are more modest; a decrease in mortality has been observed but reduction in hospital admission for uncontrolled symptoms has not been observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu F, Chen Y, Feng X, Teng Z, Yuan Y, Bin J | title = Effects of beta-blockers on heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a meta-analysis | journal = PLOS One | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = e90555 | date = 5 March 2014 | pmid = 24599093 | pmc = 3944014 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0090555 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In people who are intolerant of ACE-I and ARBs or who have significant kidney dysfunction, the use of combined [[hydralazine]] and a long-acting nitrate, such as [[isosorbide dinitrate]], is an effective alternate strategy. This regimen has been shown to reduce mortality in people with moderate heart failure.&lt;ref name="NatClinGuide CHF"&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Chapter 5: Treating heart failure | title = Chronic Heart Failure: National Clinical Guideline for Diagnosis and Management in Primary and Secondary Care | edition = Partial Update [Internet]. | author = National Clinical Guideline Centre (UK) | publisher = Royal College of Physicians | location = London (UK) | date = August 2010 | chapter-url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK65330/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is especially beneficial in African-Americans (AA).&lt;ref name="NatClinGuide CHF" /&gt; In AAs who are symptomatic, hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate (H+I) can be added to ACE-I or ARBs.

In people with markedly reduced ejection fraction, the use of an aldosterone antagonist, in addition to beta blockers and ACE-I, can improve symptoms and reduce mortality.&lt;ref name="Pitt 1999"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pitt B, Zannad F, Remme WJ, Cody R, Castaigne A, Perez A, Palensky J, Wittes J | display-authors = 6 | title = The effect of spironolactone on morbidity and mortality in patients with severe heart failure.

Second-line medications for CHF do not confer a mortality benefit. [[Digoxin]] is one such medication. Its narrow therapeutic window, a high degree of toxicity, and the failure of multiple trials to show a mortality benefit have reduced its role in clinical practice. It is now used in only a small number of people with refractory symptoms, who are in atrial fibrillation and/or who have chronic [[hypotension|low blood pressure]].

Diuretics have been a mainstay of treatment for treatment of fluid accumulation, and include diuretics classes such as loop diuretics, [[thiazide-like diuretic]], and [[potassium-sparing diuretic]]. Although widely used, evidence on their efficacy and safety is limited, with the exception of [[mineralocorticoid antagonist]]s such as [[spironolactone]].&lt;ref name="Pitt 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name=vonLueder&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = von Lueder TG, Atar D, Krum H | title = Diuretic use in heart failure and outcomes | journal = Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics | volume = 94 | issue = 4 | pages = 490–8 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 23852396 | doi = 10.1038/clpt.2013.140 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mineralocorticoid antagonists in those under 75 years old appear to decrease the risk of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Japp D, Shah A, Fisken S, Denvir M, Shenkin S, Japp A | title = Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in elderly patients with heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Age and Ageing | volume = 46 | issue = 1 | pages = 18–25 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 28181634 | doi = 10.1093/ageing/afw138 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent Cochrane review found that in small studies, the use of diuretics appeared to have improved mortality in individuals with heart failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Faris RF, Flather M, Purcell H, Poole-Wilson PA, Coats AJ | title = Diuretics for heart failure | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = CD003838 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22336795 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003838.pub3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the extent to which these results can be extrapolated to a general population is unclear due to the small number of participants in the cited studies.&lt;ref name=vonLueder/&gt;

[[Anemia]] is an independent factor in mortality in people with chronic heart failure. The treatment of anemia significantly improves quality of life for those with heart failure, often with a reduction in severity of the NYHA classification, and also improves mortality rates.&lt;ref name=He2009&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = He SW, Wang LX | title = The impact of anemia on the prognosis of chronic heart failure: a meta-analysis and systemic review | journal = Congestive Heart Failure | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 123–30 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19522961 | doi = 10.1111/j.1751-7133.2008.00030.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peraira-Moral J. | first1 = Roberto | last2 = Núñez-Gil | first2 = Ivan J. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Anaemia in heart failure: intravenous iron therapy |journal=e-Journal of the ESC Council for Cardiology Practice |volume=10 |issue=16 |date=19 January 2012 |url=http://www.escardio.org/communities/councils/ccp/e-journal/volume10/Pages/anemia-in-heart-failure-intravenous-iron-therapy-Peraira-Moral-J-Roberto-Nunez-Gil-Ivan-J.aspx |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603124155/http://www.escardio.org/communities/councils/ccp/e-journal/volume10/Pages/anemia-in-heart-failure-intravenous-iron-therapy-Peraira-Moral-J-Roberto-Nunez-Gil-Ivan-J.aspx |archive-date=3 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest European guidelines (2012) recommend screening for iron-deficient anemia and treating with [[parenteral iron]] if anemia is found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McMurray JJ, Adamopoulos S, Anker SD, Auricchio A, Böhm M, Dickstein K, Falk V, Filippatos G, Fonseca C, Gomez-Sanchez MA, Jaarsma T, Køber L, Lip GY, Maggioni AP, Parkhomenko A, Pieske BM, Popescu BA, Rønnevik PK, Rutten FH, Schwitter J, Seferovic P, Stepinska J, Trindade PT, Voors AA, Zannad F, Zeiher A | display-authors = 6 | title = ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure 2012: The Task Force for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Acute and Chronic Heart Failure 2012 of the European Society of Cardiology.

The decision to anticoagulate people with HF, typically with left ventricular ejection fractions &lt;35% is debated, but generally, people with coexisting atrial fibrillation, a prior embolic event, or conditions which increase the risk of an embolic event such as amyloidosis, left ventricular noncompaction, familial dilated cardiomyopathy, or a thromboembolic event in a first-degree relative.&lt;ref name=HUNT2005&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hunt SA, Abraham WT, Chin MH, Feldman AM, Francis GS, Ganiats TG, Jessup M, Konstam MA, Mancini DM, Michl K, Oates JA, Rahko PS, Silver MA, Stevenson LW, Yancy CW, Antman EM, Smith SC, Adams CD, Anderson JL, Faxon DP, Fuster V, Halperin JL, Hiratzka LF, Jacobs AK, Nishimura R, Ornato JP, Page RL, Riegel B | display-authors = 6 | title = ACC/AHA 2005 Guideline Update for the Diagnosis and Management of Chronic Heart Failure in the Adult: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines (Writing Committee to Update the 2001 Guidelines for the Evaluation and Management of Heart Failure): developed in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society | journal = Circulation | volume = 112 | issue = 12 | pages = e154–235 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 16160202 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.167586 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Implanted devices====
In people with severe cardiomyopathy (left ventricular ejection fraction below 35%), or in those with recurrent VT or malignant arrhythmias, treatment with an [[Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator|automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator]] (AICD)  is indicated to reduce the risk of severe life-threatening arrhythmias. The AICD does not improve symptoms or reduce the incidence of malignant arrhythmias but does reduce mortality from those arrhythmias, often in conjunction with antiarrhythmic medications. In people with left ventricular ejection (LVEF) below 35%, the incidence of [[ventricular tachycardia]] (VT) or [[sudden cardiac death]] is high enough to warrant AICD placement. Its use is therefore recommended in [[American Hospital Association|AHA]]/[[American College of Cardiology|ACC]] guidelines.&lt;ref name="Guidelines rhythm-abnormalities" /&gt;

[[Cardiac contractility modulation]] (CCM) is a [[Therapy|treatment]] for people with moderate to severe [[Heart#Chambers|left ventricular]] [[Systole|systolic]] heart failure ([[New York Heart Association Functional Classification|NYHA class II–IV]])  which enhances both the strength of ventricular [[Muscle contraction|contraction]] and the heart's pumping capacity. The CCM mechanism is based on stimulation of the cardiac muscle by [[Action potential#Refractory period|non-excitatory electrical signals]] (NES), which are delivered by a [[Artificial cardiac pacemaker|pacemaker]]-like device. CCM is particularly suitable for the treatment of heart failure with normal [[QRS complex]] duration (120 ms or less) and has been demonstrated to improve the symptoms, quality of life and exercise tolerance.&lt;ref name="Kuck 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Abraham 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Abraham WT, Smith SA | title = Devices in the management of advanced, chronic heart failure | journal = Nature Reviews.

About one third of people with [[LVEF]] below 35% have markedly altered conduction to the ventricles, resulting in dyssynchronous depolarization of the right and left ventricles. This is especially problematic in people with left bundle branch block (blockage of one of the two primary conducting fiber bundles that originate at the base of the heart and carries depolarizing impulses to the left ventricle). Using a special pacing algorithm, biventricular [[cardiac resynchronization therapy]] (CRT) can initiate a normal sequence of ventricular depolarization. In people with LVEF below 35% and prolonged QRS duration on ECG (LBBB or QRS of 150 ms or more) there is an improvement in symptoms and mortality when CRT is added to standard medical therapy.&lt;ref name=ACCFAHA2013&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yancy CW, Jessup M, Bozkurt B, Butler J, Casey DE, Drazner MH, Fonarow GC, Geraci SA, Horwich T, Januzzi JL, Johnson MR, Kasper EK, Levy WC, Masoudi FA, McBride PE, McMurray JJ, Mitchell JE, Peterson PN, Riegel B, Sam F, Stevenson LW, Tang WH, Tsai EJ, Wilkoff BL | display-authors = 6 | title = 2013 ACCF/AHA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force on practice guidelines | journal = Circulation | volume = 128 | issue = 16 | pages = e240–327 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 23741058 | doi = 10.1161/CIR.0b013e31829e8776 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the two-thirds of people without prolonged QRS duration, CRT may actually be harmful.&lt;ref name="Guidelines rhythm-abnormalities" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuck 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruschitzka 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ruschitzka F, Abraham WT, Singh JP, Bax JJ, Borer JS, Brugada J, Dickstein K, Ford I, Gorcsan J, Gras D, Krum H, Sogaard P, Holzmeister J | display-authors = 6 | title = Cardiac-resynchronization therapy in heart failure with a narrow QRS complex | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 369 | issue = 15 | pages = 1395–405 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 23998714 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1306687 | url = https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/84125/1/Ruschitzka_NEJMechoCRT.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Surgical therapies====
People with the most severe heart failure may be candidates for [[ventricular assist device]]s (VAD). VADs have commonly been used as a bridge to heart transplantation, but have been used more recently as a destination treatment for advanced heart failure.&lt;ref name="Carrel 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carrel T, Englberger L, Martinelli MV, Takala J, Boesch C, Sigurdadottir V, Gygax E, Kadner A, Mohacsi P | title = Continuous flow left ventricular assist devices: a valid option for heart failure patients | journal = Swiss Medical Weekly | volume = 142 | pages = w13701 | date = Oct 18, 2012 | pmid = 23135811 | doi = 10.4414/smw.2012.13701 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In select cases, [[cardiac transplantation|heart transplantation]] can be considered. While this may resolve the problems associated with heart failure, the person must generally remain on an immunosuppressive regimen to prevent rejection, which has its own significant downsides.&lt;ref name="Lindenfeld 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lindenfeld J, Miller GG, Shakar SF, Zolty R, Lowes BD, Wolfel EE, Mestroni L, Page RL, Kobashigawa J | display-authors = 6 | title = Drug therapy in the heart transplant recipient: part I: cardiac rejection and immunosuppressive drugs | journal = Circulation | volume = 110 | issue = 24 | pages = 3734–40 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15596559 | doi = 10.1161/01.cir.0000149745.83186.89 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A major limitation of this treatment option is the scarcity of hearts available for transplantation.

Without transplantation, heart failure may not be reversible and cardiac function typically deteriorates with time.  The growing number of patients with Stage IV heart failure (intractable symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath or chest pain at rest despite optimal medical therapy) should be considered for palliative care or hospice, according to American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines.&lt;ref name=AHAJournPallaiative/&gt;

==Prognosis==
Prognosis in heart failure can be assessed in multiple ways including clinical prediction rules and cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Clinical prediction rules use a composite of clinical factors such as lab tests and blood pressure to estimate prognosis. Among several [[clinical prediction rule]]s for prognosticating acute heart failure, the 'EFFECT rule' slightly outperformed other rules in stratifying patients and identifying those at low risk of death during hospitalization or within 30 days.&lt;ref name="pmid17449141"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Auble TE, Hsieh M, McCausland JB, Yealy DM | title = Comparison of four clinical prediction rules for estimating risk in heart failure | journal = Annals of Emergency Medicine | volume = 50 | issue = 2 | pages = 127–35, 135.e1–2 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17449141 | doi = 10.1016/j.annemergmed.2007.02.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Easy methods for identifying low-risk patients are:

* ADHERE Tree rule indicates that patients with [[blood urea nitrogen]] &lt; 43&amp;nbsp;mg/dl and [[systolic blood pressure]] at least 115&amp;nbsp;mm Hg have less than 10% chance of inpatient death or complications.
* BWH rule indicates that patients with systolic blood pressure over 90&amp;nbsp;mm Hg, respiratory rate of 30 or fewer breaths per minute, serum sodium over 135&amp;nbsp;mmol/L, no new ST-T wave changes have less than 10% chance of inpatient death or complications.

A very important method for assessing prognosis in advanced heart failure patients is cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX testing). CPX testing is usually required prior to heart transplantation as an indicator of prognosis. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing involves measurement of exhaled oxygen and carbon dioxide during exercise. The peak oxygen consumption (VO2 max) is used as an indicator of prognosis. As a general rule, a VO2 max less than 12–14 cc/kg/min indicates a poor survival and suggests that the patient may be a candidate for a heart transplant. Patients with a VO2 max&lt;10 cc/kg/min have a clearly poorer prognosis. The most recent International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) guidelines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mehra MR, Kobashigawa J, Starling R, Russell S, Uber PA, Parameshwar J, Mohacsi P, Augustine S, Aaronson K, Barr M | display-authors = 6 | title = Listing criteria for heart transplantation: International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation guidelines for the care of cardiac transplant candidates--2006 | journal = The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation | volume = 25 | issue = 9 | pages = 1024–42 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16962464 | doi = 10.1016/j.healun.2006.06.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also suggest two other parameters that can be used for evaluation of prognosis in advanced heart failure, the heart failure survival score and the use of a criterion of VE/VCO2 slope &gt; 35 from the CPX test. The heart failure survival score is a score calculated using a combination of clinical predictors and the VO2 max from the cardiopulmonary exercise test.

Heart failure is associated with significantly reduced physical and mental health, resulting in a markedly decreased [[quality of life]].&lt;ref name="pmid11847161"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Juenger J, Schellberg D, Kraemer S, Haunstetter A, Zugck C, Herzog W, Haass M | title = Health related quality of life in patients with congestive heart failure: comparison with other chronic diseases and relation to functional variables | journal = Heart | volume = 87 | issue = 3 | pages = 235–41 | date = March 2002 | pmid = 11847161 | pmc = 1767036 | doi = 10.1136/heart.87.3.235 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12445536"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hobbs FD, Kenkre JE, Roalfe AK, Davis RC, Hare R, Davies MK | title = Impact of heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction on quality of life: a cross-sectional study comparing common chronic cardiac and medical disorders and a representative adult population | journal = European Heart Journal | volume = 23 | issue = 23 | pages = 1867–76 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12445536 | doi = 10.1053/euhj.2002.3255 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of heart failure caused by reversible conditions, the condition usually worsens with time.

==Epidemiology==
In 2015 heart failure affected about 40 million people globally.&lt;ref name=GBD2015Pre/&gt; Overall around 2% of adults have heart failure&lt;ref name=Lancet2017/&gt; and in those over the age of 65, this increases to 6–10%.&lt;ref name=Lancet2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dick2008/&gt; Above 75 years old rates are greater than 10%.&lt;ref name=Lancet2017/&gt;

Rates are predicted to increase.&lt;ref name=Lancet2017/&gt; Increasing rates are mostly because of increasing life span, but also because of increased risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and obesity) and improved survival rates from other types of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, valvular disease, and arrhythmias).&lt;ref name=Harrisons&gt;{{cite book|last=Mann DL|first=Chakinala M|title=Harrison's principles of internal medicine: Chapter 234.

The effect of the lesions varies, from minor damage to the epithelium ([[Punctate epithelial erosions|superficial punctate keratitis]]), to more serious consequences such as the formation of [[Corneal ulcer|dendritic ulcers]].&lt;ref name="pmid10858770"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Suresh PS, Tullo AB |title=Herpes simplex keratitis |journal=Indian J Ophthalmol |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=155–65 |year=1999 |pmid=10858770 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infection is unilateral, affecting one eye at a time.  Additional symptoms include dull pain deep inside the eye, mild to acute dryness, and [[sinusitis]]. Most primary infections resolve spontaneously in a few weeks.  Healing can be aided by the use of oral and topical [[Antiviral drug|antiviral]]s.

Subsequent recurrences may be more severe, with infected epithelial cells showing larger dendritic ulceration, and lesions forming white plaques.&lt;ref name="pmid10858770"/&gt; The epithelial layer is sloughed off as the dendritic ulcer grows, and mild inflammation ([[iritis]]) may occur in the underlying [[stroma of iris]]. Sensation loss occurs in lesional areas, producing generalised corneal anaesthesia with repeated recurrences.&lt;ref name="pmid10858770"/&gt; Recurrence can be accompanied by chronic dry eye, low grade intermittent conjunctivitis, or chronic unexplained sinusitis. Following persistent infection  the concentration of viral DNA reaches a critical limit. Antibody responses against the viral [[antigen]] expression in the stroma can trigger a massive [[immune]] response in the eye.  The response may result in the destruction of the [[Substantia propria|corneal stroma]],&lt;ref name="pmid10858770"/&gt; resulting in loss of vision due to opacification of the cornea. This is known as immune-mediated stromal keratitis.

HSV infection is very common in humans. It has been estimated that one third of the world population have recurrent infection. Keratitis caused by HSV is the most common cause of cornea-derived [[blindness]] in developed nations. Therefore, HSV infections are a large and worldwide public health problem.&lt;ref name=yanoff /&gt; The global incidence (rate of new disease) of herpes keratitis is roughly 1.5 million, including 40,000 new cases of severe monocular visual impairment or blindness each year.&lt;ref name=farooq /&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==

===Primary infection===
[[File:herpes simplex blepharitis.jpg|thumb|herpetic blepharitis]]
Primary infection most commonly manifests as [[Herpetic keratoconjunctivitis|blepharoconjunctivitis]] i.e. infection of lids and conjunctiva that heals without scarring. Lid vesicles and conjunctivitis are seen in primary infection. Corneal involvement is rarely seen in primary infection.

===Recurrent eye infection===
Recurrent herpes of the eye is caused by reactivation of the virus in a latently infected sensory ganglion, transport of the virus down the nerve axon to sensory nerve endings, and subsequent infection of ocular surface.
The following classification of herpes simplex keratitis is important for understanding this disease:

===Dendritic ulcer (Epithelial keratitis)===
This classic herpetic lesion consists of a linear branching corneal ulcer (dendritic ulcer). During eye exam the defect is examined after staining with [[fluorescein]] dye. The underlying cornea has minimal inflammation.

Patients with epithelial keratitis complain of foreign-body sensation, light sensitivity, redness and blurred vision.

Focal or diffuse reduction in corneal sensation develops following recurrent epithelial keratitis.
[[File:Herpes simplex geographic corneal ulcer.jpeg|thumb|Fluorescein-stained cornea: geographic epithelial defects]]
In immune deficient patients or with the use of corticosteroids the ulcer may become large and in these cases it is called geographic ulcer.&lt;ref name=ao /&gt;

===Disciform keratitis (endothelial keratitis)===
Endothelial keratitis manifests a central [[endothelitis]] in a disc-shaped manner. Longstanding corneal edema leads to permanent scarring and is the major cause of decreased vision associated with HSV.

Localized endothelitis (localized inflammation of corneal endothelial layer) is the cause of disciform keratitis.

===Other forms===
* ''Metaherpetic ulcer'' : is not due to live virus, results from inability of the corneal surface to heal.
* ''Necrotizing keratitis''
* ''Keratouveitis'' : is usually granulomatous uveitis with large [[keratic precipitate]]s on the corneal endothelium.

==Cause==
{{Main|Herpes simplex virus}}
HSV is a double-stranded DNA virus that has icosahedral capsid. HSV-1 infections are found more commonly in the oral area and HSV-2 in the genital area. Ocular herpes simplex is usually caused by HSV-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc = 2907955|year = 2008|last1 = Barker|first1 = N. H|title = Ocular herpes simplex|journal = BMJ Clinical Evidence|volume = 2008|pages = 0707|pmid = 19445742}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
[[File:cytology corneal herpes multinucleated cell.jpeg|thumb|200px|Impression cytology smear stained by Papanicolaou stain shows the presence of a multinucleated giant cell]]
A specific clinical diagnosis of HSV as the cause of dendritic keratitis can usually be made by [[ophthalmologist]]s and [[optometrist]]s based on the presence of characteristic clinical features. Diagnostic testing is seldom needed because of its classic clinical features and is not useful in stromal keratitis as there is usually no live virus. Laboratory tests are indicated in complicated cases when the clinical diagnosis is uncertain and in all cases of suspected neonatal herpes infection:&lt;ref name=yanoff /&gt;&lt;ref name=ao /&gt;

* Corneal smears or impression cytology specimens can be analyzed by culture, antigen detection, or fluorescent antibody testing. Tzanck smear, i.e.Papanicolaou staining of corneal smears, show multinucleated giant cells and intranuclear inclusion bodies, however, the test is low in sensitivity and specificity.
* DNA testing is rapid, sensitive and specific. However, its high cost limits its use to research centers.
* Demonstration of HSV is possible with viral culture.
* Serologic tests may show a rising antibody titer during primary infection but are of no diagnostic assistance during recurrent episodes.

==Treatment==
Treatment of herpes of the eye is different based on its presentation: epithelial keratitis is caused by live virus while stromal disease is an immune response and metaherpetic ulcer results from inability of the corneal epithelium to heal:&lt;ref name=yanoff /&gt;&lt;ref name=ao /&gt;

===Epithelial keratitis===
Epithelial keratitis is treated with topical antivirals, which are very effective with low incidence of resistance. Treatment of the disease with topical antivirals generally should be continued for 10–14 days. [[Aciclovir]] ophthalmic ointment and [[Trifluridine]] eye drops have similar effectiveness but are more effective than [[Idoxuridine]] and [[Vidarabine]] eye drops.&lt;ref name="Wilhelmus"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilhelmus|first1=KR|title=Antiviral treatment and other therapeutic interventions for herpes simplex virus epithelial keratitis.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=9 January 2015|volume=1|pages=CD002898|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002898.pub5|pmid=25879115|pmc=4443501}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oral acyclovir is as effective as topical antivirals for treating epithelial keratitis, and it has the advantage of no eye surface toxicity. For this reason, oral therapy is preferred by some ophthalmologists.

[[Ganciclovir]] and [[brivudine]] treatments were found to be equally as effective as acyclovir in a systematic review.&lt;ref name=Wilhelmus/&gt;

[[Valacyclovir]], a pro-drug of acyclovir likely to be just as effective for ocular disease, can cause thrombotic [[thrombocytopenic purpura]]/[[Hemolytic-uremic syndrome]] in severely immunocompromised patients such as those with [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]; thus, it must be used with caution if the immune status is unknown.

Topical [[corticosteroids]] are contraindicated in the presence of active herpetic epithelial keratitis; patients with this disease who are using systemic corticosteroids for other indications should be treated aggressively with systemic antiviral therapy.

The effect of [[interferon]] with an antiviral agent or an antiviral agent with [[debridement]] needs further assessment.&lt;ref name=Wilhelmus/&gt;

===Stromal keratitis===
Herpetic stromal keratitis is treated initially with prednisolone drops every 2 hours
accompanied by a prophylactic antiviral drug: either topical antiviral or an oral agent such as acyclovir or valacyclovir. The prednisolone drops are tapered every 1–2 weeks depending on the degree of clinical improvement. Topical antiviral medications are not absorbed by the cornea through an intact epithelium, but orally administered acyclovir penetrates an intact cornea and anterior chamber. In this context, oral acyclovir might benefit the deep corneal inflammation of disciform keratitis.&lt;ref name=ao /&gt;

===Metaherpetic ulcer===
Treatment includes artificial tears and eye lubricants, stopping toxic medications, performing punctal occlusion, bandage contact lens and amniotic membrane transplant. These measures intend to improve corneal epithelial healing.

'''Ice pigging''' is the process in which an ice slurry is pumped into a pipe and forced along inside in order to remove sediment and other unwanted deposits to leave the pipe clean. It has many applications in the water, sewage and food industries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bristol.ac.uk/eng-systems-centre/idc/projects/danmcbryde.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Bristol]] has held many laboratory trials to investigate various key factors and refine the process. Ice pigging was invented and patented by Professor Joe Quarini of the University of Bristol.

== Effectiveness ==

The ice pigging method occupies a ‘middle ground’ between two of the traditional methods of cleaning [[pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipe]]s;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeNgFv5nIi4, 18/02/2013&lt;/ref&gt; that of ‘flushing’, which involves pumping high velocity water through pipes in order to carry away residue, and pigging, forcing a solid object through the pipe to push away any loose material. Ice pigging utilises the main principles behind these two methods.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wioa.org.au/conference_papers/2011_qld/documents/Graeme_Berriman.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Slurry ice|ice-water slurry]], typically between 50 and 90% ice fraction is introduced to and removed from pipes with little complication, provided the presence of suitable [[hydrant]]s and [[valve]]s. The high ice fraction lends several attributes which are particularly appealing for application in pigging; It is able to hold itself together under continuous shear. If the ice becomes stuck then given enough time it will just melt and be carried away. It is fairly inexpensive to make. It leaves the pipe walls themselves undamaged, and only removes waste residue. Because ice pigging is a relatively quick process (when compared to alternative methods), it can be use for a number of applications including: [[underground pipe]]s for fresh water and sewage, food manufacturing pipe work and many others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undergroundconstructionmagazine.com/ice-pigging-new-water-sewer-pigging-method-offers-unique-benefits, January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental impacts ==

Ice pigging uses less water and requires less cleanup than traditional [[flushing hydrant|flushing]] or underground pipe pigging techniques.&lt;ref&gt;http://info.ncsafewater.org/Shared%20Documents/Web%20Site%20Documents/Spring%20Conference/SC13_Abstracts/Water/TuesWater6-IcePigging-Abstract_RMoore-IcePigging.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=Jarble |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the process requires more energy since the ice slurries must be chilled and constantly agitated up until the point they are inserted into the pipes.

== Research and development ==

The [[University of Bristol]] have produced a paper entitled "Investigation and development of an innovative pigging technique for the water supply industry." in which they have detailed the research that they have carried out. It looks particularly at how the properties of the ice pig behave with different ice fractions and varied levels of particulate loading as well as looking into the effects of shear strength, viscosity and heat transfer characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aqualogyuk.com/websitefiles/water_paper.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-05-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035628/http://www.aqualogyuk.com/websitefiles/water_paper.pdf# |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==

* The ice pig is inserted into the pipe in a semi liquid form and can adapt to the topography of the pipes as well as large changes in diameter.
* Ice pigging doesn't require expensive excavation or preliminary treatment because it can be inserted into a pipe through existing access points whatever their diameter and then expand to the size required. Likewise the ice will exit the pipe with ease through any fire hydrant.
* Ice pigging uses less water than traditional pipe cleaning methods. The Pig is pushed through the pipe using just one pipe volume of water and then the pipe is flushed for a short period returning the water quality to its usual limits typically using 1/4 to 1/2 of the pipe volume,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aqualogyuk.com/Water-Networks/Ice-Pigging/Advantages-of-Ice-Pigging {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324041859/http://www.aqualogyuk.com/Water-Networks/Ice-Pigging/Advantages-of-Ice-Pigging# |date=2013-03-24 }}, 10/10/2011&lt;/ref&gt; Total water usage is therefore typically 1.5 times the volume of the pipe to be cleaned.
* The ice pigging process can be used in pipes of any material and will not damage the internal structure of the pipe.
* The ice pigging process takes less time than traditional pigging methods for underground pipes and can be operated by fewer people reducing labour costs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bris.ac.uk/research/impact-stories/2012/ice-pigging.html, 12/03/2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ice pigging is a low risk technique and minimal enabling works are required to insert the ice and remove it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theengineer.co.uk/process-and-production-breaking-the-ice-for-cleaner-pipes/1000291.article&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ice pigging in manufacturing can reduce effluent costs and provide product recovery benefits, when compared to water flushing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zap-icepigging.com/ice-pigging-videos |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207152957/http://www.zap-icepigging.com/ice-pigging-videos |archivedate=2013-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institut Lillois d'Ingéniérie de la Santé''' ('''ILIS''', the Lille Institute of Management and health sciences)  is part of the Lille II University Law and Health.  It is an institution allowed to deliver bachelor's and master's degrees in Health Sciences.  The ILIS lays a special emphasis on students acquiring a broad range of professional skills and work experience during theirs years of study and before graduating.  In essence quite close to the German model of University of Applied Sciences or [[Fachhochschule]], the institute is keen to let its students accumulate work experience so as to allow them a chance to compete with engineer and business schools on the job market. The core curriculum focus on current healthcare issues such as elderly care, hospital quality management, nutrition,environment,clinical research and sales of drugs and medical devices. It has been renamed Faculty of Health Management and Health Engineering while keeping the acronym ILIS.

==History==
[[Image:Université lille2.jpg|thumb|right|View from Jeanne de Flandres Hospital, ILIS is behind the medical school tower]]

ILIS Founded&lt;ref&gt;http://ilis.univ-lille2.fr/sommaire&lt;/ref&gt; was found in 1992 and graduated its first class in 1995. Change of Location and set up behind Medical School Henri Warembourg in 2002. A building extension was made in 2009.  It was recognised as a fully fledged faculty in 2010.

At first, the ILIS was set up to provide for an unmet need from the healthcare sector. During the early 1990s, more stringent rules and regulations were enforced in the healthcare sector. Firms were also having difficulties recruiting employees having both a health and management background. Therefore, a new curriculum was set up focusing on quality assurance,management and audits. Progressively, the ILIS diversified and extender its programs to biomedical technology sales and marketing as well as safety and environmental concerns. ILIS graduates are mostly employed in positions that did not exist or were not well known before 1990 such as Health Quality Assurance Officer, Risk Manager, Application Specialist and Data Manager. The ILIS graduates have one of the highest employment rate of the Lille II University, with 80% of the students already hired at graduation.&lt;ref&gt;Career Guidance Show,short Interview de Mme Robache, Chief Communication Officer in French [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg7yL1yEjPY] Article Pôle Emploi {{cite web |url=http://infos-nord.emploipublic.fr/2010/11/25/lille-fort-taux-d%E2%80%99embauche-a-la-sortie-des-masters-2-de-l%E2%80%99ilis/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818131804/http://infos-nord.emploipublic.fr/2010/11/25/lille-fort-taux-d%E2%80%99embauche-a-la-sortie-des-masters-2-de-l%E2%80%99ilis/ |archivedate=2011-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==

The ILIS is located on the town of Loos in the suburb of Lille. It is near the Lille University Hospital, the medical school and the School of Pharmacy. It benefits from the Eurasanté&lt;ref&gt;Métiers-Qualifications-Emplois en Biologie Santé,{{cite web |url=http://www.eurasante.com/fileadmin/web/pdf-publications/Metiers-qualifications-et-emplois-en-BS_CR-journee-30-01-04_.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304065807/http://www.eurasante.com/fileadmin/web/pdf-publications/Metiers-qualifications-et-emplois-en-BS_CR-journee-30-01-04_.pdf |archivedate=2011-03-04 |df= }} et Eurasanté génèse d'un géant [http://www.lepoint.fr/archives/article.php/396937], archives INA [http://www.ina.fr/economie-et-societe/vie-economique/video/CAC00019183/eurasante-pole-scientifique-de-lille.fr.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Health &amp; Biology competitive hub with firms like Bayer and Diagast.[[Image:LillePLBTriange.png|300px|thumb|right|ILIS (France) - location in Europe]]

== Admission ==
Student intake occurs at every level provided the necessary pre-requisites have been met.Freshmen often enter the school after a scientific Baccalauréat or after the PACES competitive exams to enter medical school or other health faculties. At the end of the first year, students are interviewed to check their commitment to this particular program as well as their will to choose a clear career path. Sophomores are expected to have at least some months of work experience in any business. Every new student will at some time of his curriculum, usually at the beginning, pass this admission interview so as to receive clearance to continue their studies at the ILIS.

==Programmes==
The first two years, a sound scientific background is required from students if they are to succeed.  During their graduation year they will concentrate on quality management and audits.  The fourth and fifth year is more marketing and management oriented with teamwork becoming even more important.The placements, the duration of which increases each year, allow students to integrate the reality of the working world progressively: 2 x 6 weeks full-time in the 2nd  year, 2 x 2 months full-time in the 3rd  year and 5 and 6 months full-time in the fourth and fifth year respectively .

The objectives of these placements have been clearly defined :

* development of direct relationships with industry and the working world
* involvement and accountability of students, leading to real autonomy and competence thanks to analytic tools, synthetic techniques,&lt;br&gt; capacity to draw up and carry out a plan of action or a project from A to Z.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ilis-etu.univ-lille2.fr/sommaire/english/information/introduction/txtintroduction.html Short Presentation in English]

The '''Institution of Occupational Safety and Health''' ('''IOSH''') is a [[United Kingdom|British]] organisation for [[health and safety]] professionals.

==Structure==

IOSH is the chartered professional body for safety and health in the workplace. It acts as a champion, supporter, adviser, advocate and trainer for those who protect the safety, health and wellbeing of others.

IOSH has over 46,000 members, from over 120 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iosh.co.uk/About-us/Who-we-are/Annual-reports.aspx|title=Annual reports|website=www.iosh.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes an extensive trainer network. Over 179,000 delegates attended IOSH training courses in 2016.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iosh.co.uk/Training.aspx|title=IOSH Training and Skills|website=www.iosh.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
IOSH was founded in 1945 when the Institution of Industrial Safety Officers (IISO) was formed as a division of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents ([[RoSPA]]). The Institution gained its charitable status in 1962 and continues to operate as a not-for-profit organisation.

In 1981, the IISO was renamed as the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health (IOSH), and in 2002 was awarded a Royal Charter. From 2005, IOSH began awarding Chartered Safety and Health Practitioner status to recognise individual professionalism and commitment to continued learning and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iosh.co.uk/Membership/About-membership/Standards-and-regulations.aspx|title=Standards and regulations|website=www.iosh.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 along with other Health and Safety bodies in the UK, IOSH developed the Occupational Safety &amp; Health Consultants Register (OSHCR)&lt;ref name="Beaumont"&gt;P.B. Beaumont J.W. Leopold J.R. Coyle, (1982),"The Safety Officer: An Emerging Management Role?", ''Personnel Review'', Vol. 11 Iss 2 pp. 35 - 38&lt;/ref&gt; to raise awareness and promote the use of certified health and safety consultants in the workplace.

== IOSH's work ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8616">'''The International Sports Sciences Association''' is an organization that operates as a teaching institution and certification agency for fitness trainers, aerobic instructors, and medical professionals.

The '''ISSA''' offers a general fitness certification course for personal training and six specialized fitness certification courses, including fitness nutrition, sports nutrition, strength and conditioning, exercise therapy, senior fitness and youth fitness. The student obtains the status of "Elite Trainer" after completion of three coursesd "Master Trainer" after completion of six courses.

Instruction is based on exercise assessment, nutritional planning, fitness instruction, [[sports medicine]] practice, and post-rehabilitation training.  The school has enrolled over 130,000 students, both in fitness education and continuing education courses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.issaonline.com/why-issa/index.cfm About ISSA]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
No official requirements or standards of physical training existed until the fitness boom of the 1980s.  The International Sports Sciences Association was founded in 1988, when, "recognizing the need for standardization and credibility, Dr. Sal Arria and Dr. [[Frederick Hatfield]] created a personal fitness training program to merge gym experience with practical and applied sciences."&lt;ref name="CFT"&gt;Fitness: The Complete Guide, 8th edition. Hatfield, Frederick C., MSS, PhD. ISSA, Carpinteria, CA; 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  In keeping with this standard, the ISSA became a Provisional Affiliate of the [http://www.nbfe.org/ National Board of Fitness Examiners] in 2004.

The National Board of Fitness Examiners was founded to develop nationally based and uniform standards of practice for personal fitness trainers to be used to administer an NBFE provided written and practical examination followed by registration of those who successfully pass the test process. Under NBFE’s procedure, preparation for the NBFE examination can take several forms and includes training through a number of affiliated organizations who themselves include certifying organizations for fitness professionals,&lt;ref name="Full Article"&gt;"Certification of Fitness Professionals: Separating Myth from Fact." Herbert, David L., J.D., page 2.--[http://www.afpafitness.com/about/press_releases/Certification_Myth_vs_Fiction.pdf Full Article]&lt;/ref&gt; including the ISSA.  In 2009, the ISSA became the first fitness organization to earn accreditation by a federally recognized accrediting agency—the [[Distance Education and Training Council]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.issaonline.com/press-room/01-22-09.cfm ISSA Press Room Article]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.issaonline.com/why-issa/consumer-information-disclosure.cfm Consumer Information Disclosure]&lt;/ref&gt; (an accrediting agency recognized by the [[United States Department of Education]] and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation).

As a result, the ISSA was added to the list of GI Jobs' Military Friendly Schools in 2010, being approved by the Department of Defense for the [[Defense Activity for Non-Traditional Education Support]] (DANTES) to accept U.S. Armed Forces Tuition Assistance and the Military Spouse Career Advancement Account (MyCAA) Financial Assistance program.&lt;ref name="Military"&gt;[http://www.issaonline.com/press-room/ISSA-Recognized-as-Military-Friendly-School.cfm ISSA Press Room Article]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.issaonline.com/press-room/DoD-Approves-ISSA-as-Fitness-Education-Provider-to-Military-Spouses.cfm ISSA Press Room Article]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Background===
The Japanese Government promulgated the first [[Leprosy in Japan#Leprosy prevention law|leprosy prevention law]] on March 19, 1907 but it did not come into effect until April 1, 1909 because of financial constraints. Under this law, patients who did not have family to support them were forcibly treated in public leprosaria. Japan was divided into five areas, the fifth of which included [[Nagasaki]]-ken, [[Fukuoka]] Prefecture, [[Ōita Prefecture|Ooita]] Prefecture, [[Saga]] Prefecture, [[Kumamoto]] Prefecture, [[Miyazaki Prefecture|Miyazaki]] Prefecture and [[Kagoshima]] Prefecture. In this area, Kumamoto was selected as the site of the [[sanatorium]].&lt;ref&gt;Japan Leprosy History (1993) Shun-Ichi Yamamoto, University of Tokyo Press, Tokyo&lt;/ref&gt;

The two main reasons for the leprosy prevention law were that foreigners visiting Japan after the [[Meiji Restoration]] (1868) were very much surprised to find leprosy sufferers wandering at large and claimed that something should be done about it and the Japanese Government was worried about the large number of people with the condition among those who were examined for the [[Conscription|draft]] at age 20.

The number of patients in the sanatorium varied. It depended on the numbers admitted, the number of deaths among residents and the number of patients who escaped or were discharged, Recently they were encouraged to be discharged, but for a long period, the segregation policy which caused [[leprosy stigma]] influenced the number of those who left and were readmitted into society.&lt;ref&gt;Kabeo Koete 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Four big incidents at Kikuchi Keifuen===

====Forced hospitalization of leprosy patients at Honmyoji Temple====
{{main|Forced Hospitalization at Honmyoji}}
On July 9, 1940, 157 patients living around Honmyoji temple were forcibly hospitalized and sent to other sanatoriums.  This incident was also called the Honmyoji incident. This was considered to be one of the "no leprosy patients in our prefecture" movements.

====Fujimoto's case====
[[Matsuo Fujimoto]] was considered to have received unfair treatments in two trials because he was a leprosy patient.

====Tatsudaryo incident or Kurokami primary school incident====
Children born from patients with leprosy were denied schooling at Kurokami primary school in 1954. There were strikes, riots and no schooling for some time. After one year, three children finally attended the school from the house of Mr. Takahashi, the President of Kumamoto College of Commerce.
See also [[Tatsudaryo Incident]]

====Hotel reservation rejection incident====
Also called the Aisutaa incident, because of the name of the hotel. The hotel building was destroyed by the hotel administration.

'''Three referendums''' were held in [[Liechtenstein]] during 2011. The first on approving the [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Liechtenstein|registered partnership law]] was held between 17 and 19 June,&lt;ref name="Juni"&gt;{{cite news|title=Partnerschaftsgesetz: Volk entscheidet Mitte Juni|language=German|newspaper=Liechtensteiner Vaterland|date=26 April 2011|url=http://www.vaterland.li/index.cfm?id=13194&amp;source=lv|accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ehe"&gt;{{cite news|title=Liechtensteiner stimmen im Juni über Homo- Ehe ab|language=German|work=Schweizerische Depeschenagentur, Liechtensteiner Volksblatt|publisher=Vorarlberger Medienhaus|date=26 April 2011|url=http://www.vol.at/liechtensteiner-stimmen-im-juni-ueber-homo-ehe-ab/news-20110426-07030790|accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was approved by 68.8% of voters. The law went into effect on 1 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=68,8 % Ja-Stimmen für Partnerschaftsgesetz|language=German|newspaper=Liechtensteiner Volksblatt|date=19 June 2011|url=http://www.volksblatt.li/?newsid=60298&amp;src=vb&amp;region=li|accessdate=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second was held on 18 September on allowing [[abortion]] within the first twelve weeks of pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.ch/1163/20110914/ |title=The Local - Liechtenstein to vote on legalising abortion |publisher=Thelocal.ch |date=2011-09-14 |accessdate=2012-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prince Alois of Liechtenstein|Prince Alois]] had threatened to veto the result if the result of the referendum should have turned out in favour, but ultimately it was rejected by voters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=li022011 Liechtenstein, 18 September 2011: Deadline solution for abortion] Direct Democracy {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third was on building a new national hospital in [[Vaduz]] was held on 30 October, and was also rejected.

==Registered partnership law==
The registered partnership law (Lebenspartnerschaft) was passed unanimously by the [[Landtag of Liechtenstein]] in the second reading on March 16 and published on March 21, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ja zur eingetragenen Partnerschaft|language=German|newspaper=Liechtensteiner Volksblatt|date=16 March 2011|url=http://www.volksblatt.li/?newsid=56596&amp;src=vb&amp;region=li|accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Landtag einhellig für Partnerschaftsgesetz|language=German|newspaper=Liechtensteiner Vaterland|date=16 March 2011|url=http://www.vaterland.li/index.cfm?source=lv&amp;id=12784|accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the group Vox Populi, led by a cousin of archbishop [[Wolfgang Haas]], announced its intention to force a referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Partnerschaftsgesetz: Doch noch Widerstand|language=German|newspaper=Liechtensteiner Vaterland|date=28 March 2011|url=http://www.vaterland.li/index.cfm?source=lv&amp;id=12910|accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="APA"&gt;{{cite news|title=Liechtenstein stimmt über die Homo- Ehe ab|language=German|agency=Austria Presse Agentur|publisher=Teleport|date=17 June 2011|url=http://www.vienna.at/liechtenstein-stimmt-ueber-die-homo-ehe-ab/news-20110617-11362508|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Constitution of Liechtenstein|the constitution]], the organisation had until 21 April (30 days) to collect at least 1000 signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Liebe ist ein Menschenrecht|language=German|newspaper=Liechtensteiner Vaterland|date=4 April 2011|url=http://www.vaterland.li/index.cfm?source=lv&amp;id=12964|accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the necessary signatures were gathered (1208 valid signatures), a referendum was held on the evening of 17 June and the morning of 19 June 2011.&lt;ref name="Juni" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ehe" /&gt;

===Campaign===
The registered partnership law was supported by the government and all parties in the Landtag, but opposed by the socially conservative [[advocacy group]] "Vox Populi" and the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vaduz]].&lt;ref name="APA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Information zur Volksabstimmung|publisher=Government of Liechtenstein|url=http://login.gmgnet.li/gmgms/abstimmung/dateienordner/abspresseamt/documents/GzD_5_Infobrosch_Partnerschaftsges_634418528686626250.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New hospital==
On 28 June the [[Landtag of Liechtenstein|Landtag]] passed a bill approving spending 83 million [[Swiss Franc|francs]] on the construction of a national hospital in [[Vaduz]] by 14 votes to 11.&lt;ref name=D1/&gt; A request for an advisory referendum was rejected by 12 votes to 11, but a committee gathered 2,951 signatures between 8 July and 3 August, forcing a referendum.&lt;ref name=D1&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=li032011 Liechtenstein, 30 October 2011: New build of the National Hospital] Direct Democracy {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==

== Uses of the Maslach Burnout Inventory&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ==
* Assess professional burnout in human service, education, business, and government professions.
* Assess and validate the three-dimensional structure of burnout.
* Understand the nature of burnout for developing effective interventions.

== Maslach Burnout Inventory Scales&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ==

=== Emotional Exhaustion (EE) ===
The 9-item Emotional Exhaustion (EE) scale measures feelings of being emotionally overextended and exhausted at one's work. Higher scores correspond to greater experienced burnout. This scale is used in the MBI-HSS, MBI-HSS (MP), and MBI-ES versions.

The MBI-GS and MBI-GS (S) use a shorter 5-item version of this scale called "Exhaustion".

=== Depersonalization (DP) ===
The 5-item Depersonalization (DP) scale measures an unfeeling and impersonal response toward recipients of one's service, care, treatment, or instruction. Higher scores correspond to greater degrees of experienced burnout. This scale is used in the MBI-HSS, MBI-HSS (MP) and the MBI-ES versions.

=== Personal Accomplishment (PA) ===
The 8-item Personal Accomplishment (PA) scale measures feelings of competence and successful achievement in one's work with people. Lower scores correspond to greater experienced burnout. This scale is used in the MBI-HSS, MBI-HSS (MP), and MBI-ES versions.

=== Cynicism ===
The 5-item Cynicism scale measures an indifference or a distance attitude towards one's work. The cynicism measured by this scale is a coping mechanism for distancing oneself from exhausting job demands. Higher scores correspond to greater experienced burnout. This scale is used in the MBI-GS and MBI-GS (S) versions.

=== Professional Efficacy ===
The 6-item Professional Efficacy scale measures feelings of competence and successful achievement in one's work. This sense of personal accomplishment emphasizes effectiveness and success in having a beneficial impact on people. Lower scores correspond to greater experienced burnout. This scale is used in the MBI-GS and MBI-GS (S) versions.

== Forms of the Maslach Burnout Inventory&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ==
The MBI has five validated forms composed of 16-22 items to measure an individual's experience of burnout.

=== Maslach Burnout Inventory - Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS) ===
The MBI-HSS consists of 22 items and is the original and most widely used version of the MBI. It was designed for professionals in human services and is appropriate for respondents working in a diverse array of occupations, including nurses, physicians, health aides, social workers, health counselors, therapists, police, correctional officers, clergy, and other fields focused on helping people live better lives by offering guidance, preventing harm, and ameliorating physical, emotional, or cognitive problems. The MBI-HSS scales are Emotional Exhaustion, Depersonalization, and Personal Accomplishment.

=== Maslach Burnout Inventory - Human Services Survey for Medical Personnel (MBI-HSS (MP)) ===
The MBI-HSS (MP) is a variation of the MBI-HSS adapted for medical personnel. The most notable alteration is this form refers to "patients" instead of "recipients". The MBI-HSS (MP) scales are Emotional Exhaustion, Depersonalization, and Personal Accomplishment.

=== Maslach Burnout Inventory - Educators Survey (MBI-ES) ===
The MBI-ES consists of 22 items and is a version of the original MBI for use with educators. It was designed for teachers, administrators, other staff members, and volunteers working in any educational setting. This form was formerly known as MBI-Form Ed. The MBI-ES scales are Emotional Exhaustion, Depersonalization, and Personal Accomplishment.

=== Maslach Burnout Inventory - General Survey (MBI-GS) ===
The MBI-GS consists of 16 items and is designed for use with occupational groups other than human services and education, including those working in jobs such as customer service, maintenance, manufacturing, management, and most other professions. The MBI-GS scales are Exhaustion, Cynicism, and Professional Efficacy.

=== Maslach Burnout Inventory - General Survey for Students (MBI-GS (S)) ===
The MBI-GS (S) is an adaptation of the MBI-GS designed to assess burnout in college and university students. It is available for use but its psychometric properties are not yet documented. The MBI-GS (S) scales are Exhaustion, Cynicism, and Professional Efficacy.

== Scoring the Maslach Burnout Inventory&lt;ref name="Maslach, Christina &amp; Jackson, Susan &amp; Leiter, Michael &amp; Pamphlet Collection (Library of Congress, YA. (1996). The Maslach Burnout Inventory-Test Manual." /&gt; ==
All MBI items are scored using a 7 level frequency scale from "never" to "daily." Initial development had 3 components: emotional exhaustion (9 items), depersonalization (5 items) and personal achievement (8 items). Each scale measures its own unique dimension of burnout. Scales should not be combined to form a single burnout scale. Scales include reverse-scored items. Maslach, Jackson and Leiter (1996) describe item scoring from 0 to 6. While a common convention is to avoid zeros for scales, one should be aware that altering the original 0-6 scores will not align with categories of each scale. There are score ranges that define Low, Moderate and High levels of each component/scale based on the 0-6 scoring. Using a 1-7 scale with the original category ranges will inflate the number of people in the upper 2 categories. Further, comparisons with existing literature may be misleading.

The 7-level frequency scale for all MBI scales is as follows:
 Never (0)
 A few times a year or less (1)
 Once a month or less (2)
 A few times a month (3)
 Once a week (4)
 A few times a week (5)
 Every day (6)

==Examples of use==
The Maslach Burnout Inventory has been used in a variety of studies to study burnout, including with health professionals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673605671784 | doi = 10.1016/s0140-6736(05)67178-4 | pmid = 16125591 | volume=366 | issue = 9487 | title=Changes in mental health of UK hospital consultants since the mid-1990s | year=2005 | journal=The Lancet | pages=742–744 | last1 = Taylor | first1 = Cath | last2 = Graham | first2 = Jill | last3 = Potts | first3 = Henry WW | last4 = Richards | first4 = Michael A | last5 = Ramirez | first5 = Amanda J}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.2466/pr0.1985.57.1.147| pmid=4048330|title = Maslach Burnout Inventory: Factor Structure and Norms for British Nursing Staff| journal=Psychological Reports| volume=57| issue=1| pages=147–150|year = 1985|last1 = Firth|first1 = Hugh| last2=McIntee| first2=Jean| last3=McKeown| first3=Paul| last4=Britton| first4=Peter G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1348/000709902158865 | volume=72 | issue=2 | title=Burnout and self-efficacy: A study on teachers' beliefs when implementing an innovative educational system in the Netherlands | year=2002 | journal=British Journal of Educational Psychology | pages=227–243 | last1 = Evers | first1 = Will J.

== Signs and symptoms ==

Mumps is usually preceded by a set of [[prodromal symptoms]] including low-grade fever, headache, and [[malaise]].&lt;ref name=Davis2010 /&gt; This is followed by progressive swelling of one or both [[parotid gland]]s.&lt;ref name=Davis2010 /&gt; Parotid gland swelling usually lasts about one week.&lt;ref name=Davis2010 /&gt; Other symptoms of mumps can include dry mouth, sore face and/or ears and some patients find it difficult to talk.&lt;ref name=Harrison&gt;{{cite book |author = Kasper DL |author2 = Braunwald E|author3 = Fauci AS|author4 = Hauser SL|author5 = Longo DL|author6 = Jameson JL|author7 = Isselbacher KJ|author8 = Eds. |title = Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine |chapter = 194.

=== Complications ===

* [[Orchitis|Painful testicular inflammation]] develops in 15–40 percent of men who have completed puberty and contract the mumps virus.&lt;ref name=Davis2010 /&gt; This testicular inflammation is generally one-sided (both testicles are swollen in 15–30 percent of mumps orchitis cases) and typically occurs about 10 days after the parotid gland inflamed.&lt;ref name=Davis2010 /&gt; Testicular swelling has been documented as late as six weeks after parotid gland swelling.&lt;ref name=Davis2010 /&gt;  Decreased fertility is an uncommon consequence of testicular inflammation from mumps and infertility is rare.&lt;ref name=Davis2010 /&gt;
* Studies have reached differing conclusions regarding whether or not infection with the mumps virus during pregnancy leads to an increased rate of [[spontaneous abortion]].&lt;ref name=Hviid2008 /&gt;
* Before vaccination approximately 10 percent of cases of aseptic [[meningitis]] were due to mumps.&lt;ref name=Pink2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Pinkbook {{!}} Mumps {{!}} Epidemiology of Vaccine Preventable Diseases {{!}} CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/mumps.html|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422140046/https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/mumps.html|archivedate=22 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symptoms would generally resolve within 10 days.&lt;ref name=Pink2016/&gt; Infection of the brain itself ([[encephalitis]]) occurs in between 0.02% and 0.3% of cases.&lt;ref name=Pink2016/&gt;

* [[Encephalitis|Brain inflammation]] (very rare, and fatal in about one percent of the cases when it occurs)&lt;ref name=Sen2008 /&gt;
* Profound (91&amp;nbsp;dB or more) but rare sensorineural [[hearing loss]], which can be uni- or bilateral. Acute unilateral deafness occurs in about 0.005 percent of cases.&lt;ref name=Sen2008 /&gt;

== Cause ==

The [[mumps virus]] is an [[Viral envelope|enveloped]] single-stranded, linear [[Sense (molecular biology)|negative-sense]] [[RNA virus]] of the genus ''[[Rubulavirus]]'' and family ''[[Paramyxovirus]]''. The genome consists of 15,384 bases encoding nine proteins. Proteins involved in viral replication are the nucleoprotein, phosphoprotein, and polymerase protein while the genomic RNA forms the ribonucleocapsid.&lt;ref name=Hviid2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Davis2010&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Davis NF, McGuire BB, Mahon JA, Smyth AE, O'Malley KJ, Fitzpatrick JM |title = The increasing incidence of mumps orchitis: a comprehensive review |journal = BJU International |date = April 2010 |volume = 105 |issue = 8 |pages = 1060–5 |pmid = 20070300 |doi = 10.1111/j.1464-410X.2009.09148.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McGraw-Hill"&gt;{{cite book |editor-first = Dan L. |editor-last = Longo |editor2-first = Dennis L. |editor2-last = Kasper |editor3-first = J.

Mumps is spread from person to person through contact with respiratory secretions, such as saliva from an infected person.&lt;ref name=Davis2010 /&gt; When an infected person coughs or sneezes, the droplets aerosolize and can enter the eyes, nose, or mouth of another person. Mumps can also be spread by sharing eating utensils or cups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/about/transmission.html|title=Mumps {{!}} Transmission {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=18 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413060225/http://www.cdc.gov/mumps/about/transmission.html|archivedate=13 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The virus can also survive on surfaces and then be spread after contact in a similar manner. A person infected with mumps is contagious from approximately seven days before the onset of symptoms until about eight days after symptoms start.&lt;ref name=Kutty2010 /&gt; The [[incubation period]] (time until symptoms begin) can be from 12–25 days, but is typically 16–18 days.&lt;ref name=Kutty2010 /&gt; 20-40 percent of persons infected with the mumps virus do not show symptoms, so it is possible to be infected and spread the virus without knowing it.&lt;ref name=Kutty2010 /&gt;

== Diagnosis ==

During an outbreak, a diagnosis can be made by determining recent exposure and [[parotitis]]. However, when the disease incidence is low, other infectious causes of parotitis should be considered such as [[HIV]], [[coxsackievirus]], and [[influenza]]. Some viruses such as enteroviruses may cause aseptic meningitis that is very clinically similar to mumps.&lt;ref name="McGraw-Hill" /&gt;

A physical examination confirms the presence of the swollen glands. Usually, the disease is diagnosed on clinical grounds, and no confirmatory laboratory testing is needed. If there is uncertainty about the diagnosis, a test of saliva or [[serology|blood]] may be carried out; a newer diagnostic confirmation, using real-time [[nested polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) technology, has also been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Krause CH, Eastick K, Ogilvie MM |title = Real-time PCR for mumps diagnosis on clinical specimens--comparison with results of conventional methods of virus detection and nested PCR |journal = J.

== Prevention ==

The most common preventative measure against mumps is a vaccination with a [[mumps vaccine]], invented by American microbiologist [[Maurice Hilleman]] at [[Merck &amp; Co.|Merck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Offit PA |title = Vaccinated: One Man's Quest to Defeat the World's Deadliest Diseases |location = Washington, DC |publisher = Smithsonian |isbn = 0-06-122796-X |year = 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Buynak EB|author2 = Weibel RE|author3 = Whitman JE Jr|author4 = Stokes J Jr|author5 = Hilleman MR |title = Combined live measles, mumps, and rubella virus vaccines |journal = JAMA |volume = 207 |issue = 12 |pages = 2259–62 |date = March 1969 |pmid = 5818433 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vaccine may be given separately or as part of the [[MMR vaccine|MMR immunization]] vaccine that also protects against [[measles]] and [[rubella]]. In the US, MMR is now being supplanted by [[MMRV vaccine|MMRV]], which adds protection against [[chickenpox]] (varicella, HHV3). The [[World Health Organization|WHO]] (World Health Organization) recommends the use of mumps vaccines in all countries with well-functioning childhood vaccination programmes. In the United Kingdom it is routinely given to children at age 13 months with a booster at 3–5 years (preschool) This confers lifelong{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} immunity. The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] recommends the routine administration of MMR vaccine at ages 12–15 months and at 4–6 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publication-date = 20 April 2012 |title = MMR Vaccine |type = PDF |series = Vaccine Information Statement |publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |publication-place = United States |page = 1 |url = https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/vis/downloads/vis-mmr.pdf |accessdate = 22 February 2013 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130309223352/http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/vis/downloads/vis-mmr.pdf |archivedate = 9 March 2013 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some locations, the vaccine is given again between four and six years of age, or between 11 and 12 years of age if not previously given.

Because of the outbreaks within college and university settings, many governments have established vaccination programs to prevent large-scale outbreaks. In Canada, provincial governments and the Public Health Agency of Canada have all participated in awareness campaigns to encourage students ranging from grade one to college and university to get vaccinated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/mumps-oreillons/prof-eng.php#t2 Table 2: Provincial and Territorial recommendations for mumps-containing immunization, 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207003042/http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/mumps-oreillons/prof-eng.php#t2 |date=7 December 2008 }}, Information on Outbreaks of Mumps In Canada – Information for Health Professionals, Public Health Agency Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[anti-vaccinationists|anti-vaccine activists]] protest against the administration of a vaccine against mumps, claiming that the attenuated vaccine strain is harmful, and/or that the wild disease is beneficial. There is no evidence whatsoever to support the claim that the wild disease is beneficial, or that the [[MMR vaccine]] is harmful. Claims have been made that the MMR vaccine is linked to autism and [[inflammatory bowel disease]], including one study by [[Andrew Wakefield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.aap.org/immunization/families/autismwakefield.html |title = Autism and Andrew Wakefield |date = 30 October 2013&lt;!--last update--&gt; |website = Immunization |publisher = [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] |deadurl = yes |archivedate = 5 January 2014 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140105025757/http://www2.aap.org/immunization/families/autismwakefield.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://autism.about.com/od/causesofautism/a/MMRVaccine.htm |title = Causes of Autism |website = aboutHealth |publisher = [[about.com]] |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110707074839/http://autism.about.com/od/causesofautism/a/MMRVaccine.htm |archivedate = 7 July 2011 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper was discredited and retracted in 2010 and Wakefield was later stripped of his license after his work was found to be an "elaborate fraud".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/01/05/autism.vaccines/index.html |title = Retracted autism study an 'elaborate fraud,' British journal finds |author1 = Cohen, Elizabeth |author2 = Falco, Miriam |date = 5 January 2011 |work =  |publisher = CNN |accessdate = 16 May 2011 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110427192706/http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/01/05/autism.vaccines/index.html |archivedate = 27 April 2011 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, subsequent studies indicate no link between vaccination with the MMR and autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Demicheli V, Rivetti A, Debalini MG, Di Pietrantonj C |title = Vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella in children |journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume = 2 |issue =  |pages = CD004407 |year = 2012 |pmid = 22336803 |doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004407.pub3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the dangers of the disease are well known, and the dangers of the vaccine are quite minimal, vaccination is nearly universally recommended.

The [[WHO]], the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]], the [[British Medical Association]] and the [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain]] currently recommend routine vaccination of children against mumps. The British Medical Association and Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain had previously recommended against general mumps vaccination, changing that recommendation in 1987.

Before the introduction of the mumps vaccine, the mumps virus was the leading cause of viral meningoencephalitis in the United States. However, encephalitis occurs rarely (less than two per 100,000).&lt;ref name=PinkBook_2006&gt;{{cite book |editor = Atkinson W |editor2= Humiston S|editor3= Wolfe C|editor4= Nelson R | title = Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases | edition=   9th | publisher = Centers for Disease Control and prevention | year = 2006 | id =  [https://www.cdc.gov/nip/publications/pink/def_pink_full.htm Fulltext] }}{{dead link|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one of the largest studies in the literature, the most common symptoms of mumps meningoencephalitis were found to be fever (97 percent), vomiting (94 percent) and headache (88.8 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Kanra G, Isik P, Kara A, Cengiz AB, Seçmeer G, Ceyhan M |title = Complementary findings in clinical and epidemiologic features of mumps and mumps meningoencephalitis in children without mumps vaccination |journal = Pediatr Int |volume = 46 |issue = 6 |pages = 663–8 |year = 2004 |pmid = 15660864 |doi = 10.1111/j.1442-200x.2004.01968.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mumps vaccine was introduced into the United States in December 1967: since its introduction there has been a steady decrease in the incidence of mumps and mumps virus infection. There were 151,209 cases of mumps reported in 1968.

== Management ==

The treatment of mumps is [[supportive treatment|supportive]].&lt;ref name=Davis2010 /&gt; Symptoms may be relieved by the application of intermittent ice or heat to the affected neck/testicular area and by [[acetaminophen]] for pain relief.&lt;ref name=Davis2010 /&gt;  Warm saltwater [[gargle]]s, soft foods, and extra fluids may also help relieve symptoms. [[Acetylsalicylic acid]] (aspirin) is not used to treat children due to the risk of [[Reye syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Mumps – National Library of Medicine – Pubmed Health |url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002524/ |accessdate = 14 January 2015 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141017215609/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002524/ |archivedate = 17 October 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no effective post-exposure recommendation to prevent secondary transmission, nor is the post-exposure use of vaccine or [[immunoglobulin]] effective.&lt;ref name="urlMumps Clinical Information – Minnesota Dept. of Health"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/idepc/diseases/mumps/hcp/clinical.html |title = Mumps Clinical Information – Minnesota Dept. of Health |work =  |accessdate =  |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110519011342/http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/idepc/diseases/mumps/hcp/clinical.html |archivedate = 19 May 2011 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mumps is considered most contagious in the five days after the onset of symptoms, and [[Isolation (health care)|isolation]] is recommended during this period. In someone who has been admitted to the hospital, standard and droplet precautions are needed. People who work in healthcare cannot work for five days.&lt;ref name=Kutty2010 /&gt;

'''Nasogastric intubation''' is a medical process involving the insertion of a plastic tube ('''nasogastric tube''' or ''' NG tube''') through the [[human nose|nose]], past the [[throat]], and down into the [[stomach]]. '''Orogastric intubation''' is a similar process involving the insertion of a plastic tube ('''orogastric tube''')  through the mouth.&lt;ref name=NICE&gt;{{cite web|title=Nutrition support for adults: oral nutrition support, enteral tube feeding and parenteral nutrition|url=https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg32/chapter/1-Guidance|publisher=NICE|accessdate=30 January 2018|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
A nasogastric tube is used for feeding and administering drugs and other oral agents such as [[activated charcoal]]. For drugs and for minimal quantities of liquid, a [[syringe]] is used for [[injection (medicine)|injection]] into the tube. For continuous feeding, a gravity based system is employed, with the solution placed higher than the patient's stomach. If accrued supervision is required for the feeding, the tube is often connected to an electronic pump which can control and measure the patient's intake and signal any interruption in the feeding. Nasogastric tubes may also be used as an aid in the treatment of life threatening eating disorders, especially if the patient is not compliant with eating.
       
[[Nasogastric aspiration]] (suction) is the process of draining the stomach's contents via the tube. Nasogastric aspiration is mainly used to remove gastrointestinal secretions and swallowed air in patients with [[Bowel obstruction|gastrointestinal obstructions]]. Nasogastric aspiration can also be used in poisoning situations when a potentially toxic liquid has been [[ingested]], for preparation before surgery under [[anaesthesia]], and to extract samples of gastric liquid for analysis.

If the tube is to be used for continuous drainage, it is usually appended to a collector bag placed below the level of the patient's stomach; gravity empties the stomach's contents. It can also be appended to a suction system, however this method is often restricted to emergency situations, as the constant suction can easily damage the stomach's lining. In non-emergency situations, intermittent suction is often applied giving the benefits of suction without the untoward effects of damage to the stomach lining.

Suction drainage is also used for patients who have undergone a [[pneumonectomy]] in order to prevent anesthesia-related vomiting and possible aspiration of any stomach contents. Such aspiration would represent a serious risk of complications to patients recovering from this surgery.

==Types==
[[Image:viasys corflo ng tube Fr8.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Polyurethane NG tube (Viasys Corflo), 8 Fr × 36 in (91 cm). This fine bore tube is appropriate for longer use (up to 4 weeks).]]
Types of nasogastric tubes include:
*'''Levin catheter''', which is a single lumen, small bore NG tube. It is more appropriate for administration of medication or nutrition.&lt;ref name=LaPiere2014&gt;[http://www.sharinginhealth.ca/procedures/nasogastric_tube.html Nasogastric Tube]. Last authored: Dec 2009, David LaPierre&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Salem Sump catheter''', which is a large bore NG tube with double lumen. This avails for aspiration in one lumen, and venting in the other to reduce negative pressure and prevent gastric mucosa from being drawn into the catheter.&lt;ref name=LaPiere2014/&gt;
*'''Dobhoff tube''', which is a small bore NG tube with a weight at the end intended to pull it by gravity during insertion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vrNFT4cK32UC&amp;pg=PT162 Section 82], Ensure Appropriate Position of the Dubhoff Tube Prior To Feeding. {{cite book|author1=Betsy H. Allbee|author2=Lisa Marcucci|author3=Jeannie S. Garber |author4=Monty Gross |author5=Sheila Lambert |author6=Ricky J. McCraw |author7=Anthony D. Slonim |author8=Teresa A. Slonim|title=Avoiding Common Nursing Errors|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vrNFT4cK32UC|date=28 March 2012|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-1-4511-5324-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
[[File:ETTubeandNGtubeMarked.png|thumb|An [[endotracheal tube]] and nasogastric tube as seen on CXR. Both in good position.]]
Before an NG tube is inserted, it must be measured from the tip of the patient's nose, loop around their ear and then down to roughly 5&amp;nbsp;cm below the [[xiphoid process]]. The tube is then marked at this level to ensure that the tube has been inserted far enough into the patient's stomach. Many commercially available stomach and duodenal tubes have several standard depth markings, for example 18" (46&amp;nbsp;cm), 22" (56&amp;nbsp;cm), 26" (66&amp;nbsp;cm) and 30" (76&amp;nbsp;cm) from distal end; infant feeding tubes often come with 1&amp;nbsp;cm depth markings. The end of a plastic tube is lubricated (local anesthetic, such as 2% xylocaine gel, may be used; in addition, nasal vasoconstrictor and/or anesthetic spray may be applied before the insertion) and inserted into one of the patient's anterior nares. The tube should be directed straight towards the back of the patient as it moves through the nasal cavity and down into the throat. When the tube enters the [[oropharynx]] and glides down the posterior pharyngeal wall, the patient may gag; in this situation the patient, if awake and alert, is asked to mimic swallowing or is given some water to sip through a straw, and the tube continues to be inserted as the patient swallows. Once the tube is past the pharynx and enters the [[esophagus]], it is easily inserted down into the stomach. The tube must then be secured in place to prevent it from moving.

Great care must be taken to ensure that the tube has not passed through the [[larynx]] into the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] and down into the [[bronchi]]. The reliable method is to aspirate some fluid from the tube with a [[syringe]]. This fluid is then tested with [[pH indicator|pH paper]] (note not [[Litmus test (chemistry)|litmus paper]]) to determine the acidity of the fluid. If the pH is 4 or below then the tube is in the correct position. If this is not possible then correct verification of tube position is obtained with an [[X-ray]] of the chest/abdomen. This is the most reliable means of ensuring proper placement of an NG tube.&lt;ref name="NEnglJMed1996-Thomas"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thomas B, Cummin D, Falcone RE | title=Accidental pneumothorax from a nasogastric tube | journal=N Engl J Med | year=1996 | pages=1325–1326 | volume=335 | issue=17 | pmid=8992337 | doi=10.1056/NEJM199610243351717}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of a chest x-ray to confirm position is the expected standard in the UK, with Dr/ physician review and confirmation. Future techniques may include measuring the concentration of enzymes such as [[trypsin]], [[pepsin]], and [[bilirubin]] to confirm the correct placement of the NG tube.  As enzyme testing becomes more practical, allowing measurements to be taken quickly and cheaply at the bedside, this technique may be used in combination with pH testing as an effective, less harmful replacement of X-ray confirmation.&lt;ref name="CincinnatiChildren'sMedicalHospital2009"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center| title=Best evidence statement (BESt). Confirmation of nasogastric tube placement in [[pediatric]] patients.| journal=National Guidelines Clearing House | year=2009 | pages=11 | volume= | issue= | pmid= | doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the tube is to remain in place then a tube position check is recommended before each feed and at least once per day.

Only smaller diameter (12 [[French catheter scale|Fr]] or less in adults) nasogastric tubes are appropriate for long-term feeding, so as to avoid irritation and erosion of the nasal mucosa. These tubes often have guidewires to facilitate insertion. If feeding is required for a longer period of time, other options, such as placement of a [[PEG tube]], should be considered.

Function of an NG tube properly placed and used for suction is maintained by flushing.  This may be done by flushing small amounts of saline and air using a syringe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Perry |first1=AG |last2=Potter |first2=PA |editor-last=Ostendorf |editor-first=W |title=Clinical Nursing Skills &amp; Techniques, 7th Edition. |publisher=Mosby Elsevier |date=2010 |pages=914–920 |chapter=Skill 34-4: Inserting and maintaining a nasogastric tube for gastric decompression |chapterurl=http://en.wikipedia.org/ |isbn=9780323068055}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by flushing larger amounts of saline or water, and air, and then assessing for the air to circulate through one lumen of the tube, into the stomach, and out the other lumen.  When these two techniques of flushing were compared, the latter was more effective.&lt;ref name="BMCNursing2015-BaniHani"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bani Hani M, Ihim I, Harps J, Cunningham SC | title=A breath of fresh air: a quality-improvement study comparing an air-circulating technique versus conventional technique to prevent nasogastric tube dysfunction. | journal=BMC Nursing | year=2015 | pages=63| volume=14 | pmid=26617465  | doi=10.1186/s12912-015-0111-9 | pmc=4661948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contraindications==
The use of nasogastric intubation is [[contraindicated]] in patients with moderate-to-severe neck and facial fractures due to the increased risk of airway obstruction or improper tube placement. Special attention is necessary during insertion under these circumstances in order to avoid undue trauma to the [[esophagus]]. There is also a greater risk to patients suffering from bleeding disorders, particularly those resulting from the distended sub-mucosal veins in the lower third of the esophagus known as [[esophageal varices]] which may be easily ruptured due to their friability and also in GERD.

Alternative measures, such as an orogastric intubation, should be considered under these circumstances, or if the patient will be incapable of meeting their nutritional and caloric needs for an extended time period (usually &gt;24 hours).

==Complications==

Minor complications include [[epistaxis|nose bleeds]], [[sinusitis]], and a sore throat.

Sometimes more significant complications occur including erosion of the nose where the tube is anchored, esophageal perforation, damage to a surgical [[anastomosis]], [[pulmonary aspiration]], a [[collapsed lung]], or [[intracranial]] placement of the tube.

'''Paralytic shellfish poisoning''' ('''PSP''') is one of the four recognized syndromes of [[shellfish poisoning]], which share some common features and are primarily associated with [[Bivalvia|bivalve mollusks]] (such as [[mussel]]s, [[clam]]s, [[oyster]]s and [[scallop]]s).

Also some pufferfish, including [[Pao turgidus|chamaeleon puffer]], contain saxitoxin, making their consumption hazardous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.toxicon.2007.10.002 |title=Occurrence of paralytic shellfish toxins in Cambodian Mekong pufferfish Tetraodon turgidus: Selective toxin accumulation in the skin |year=2008 |last1=Ngy |first1=Laymithuna |last2=Tada |first2=Kenji |last3=Yu |first3=Chun-Fai |last4=Takatani |first4=Tomohiro |last5=Arakawa |first5=Osamu |journal=Toxicon |volume=51 |issue=2 |pages=280–8 |pmid=17996918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pathophysiology ==

The toxins responsible for most shellfish poisonings are water insoluble,  heat and acid-stable, and ordinary cooking methods do not eliminate the toxins. The principal toxin responsible for PSP is [[saxitoxin]]. Some shellfish can store this toxin for several weeks after a [[harmful algal bloom]] passes, but others, such as [[Saxidomus|butter clam]]s, are known to store the toxin for up to two years. Additional toxins are found, such as neosaxiton and gonyautoxins I to IV. All of them act primarily on the nervous system.

PSP can be fatal in extreme cases, particularly in [[immunocompromised]] individuals. Children are more susceptible. PSP affects those who come into contact with the affected shellfish by ingestion.&lt;ref name=uhm/&gt; Symptoms can appear ten to 30 minutes after ingestion, and include [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]], [[abdominal pain]],  [[Paresthesia|tingling or burning]] lips, gums, tongue, face, neck, arms, legs, and toes.&lt;ref name=uhm/&gt; [[Dyspnea|Shortness of breath]], [[Xerostomia|dry mouth]], a choking feeling, [[Dysarthria|confused or slurred speech]], and [[Ataxia|loss of coordination]] are also possible.

==PSP in wild marine mammals==
PSP has been implicated as a possible cause of [[sea otter]] [[Death|mortality]] and [[morbidity]] in Alaska, as one of its primary prey items, the butter [[clam]] ''(Saxidonus giganteus)'' bioaccumulates saxitoxin as a chemical defense mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Anthony R. |last1=DeGange |first2=M. Michele |last2=Vacca |date=November 1989 |title=Sea Otter Mortality at Kodiak Island, Alaska, during Summer 1987 |journal=Journal of Mammalogy |volume=70 |issue=4 |pages=836–8 |jstor=1381723 |doi=10.2307/1381723}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ingestion of saxitoxin-containing [[mackerel]] has been implicated in the death of [[humpback whales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1139/f89-238 |title=Humpback Whales (''Megaptera novaeangliae'') Fatally Poisoned by Dinoflagellate Toxin |year=1989 |last1=Geraci |first1=Joseph R. |last2=Anderson |first2=Donald M. |last3=Timperi |first3=Ralph J. |last4=St. Aubin |first4=David J. |last5=Early |first5=Gregory A. |last6=Prescott |first6=John H. |last7=Mayo |first7=Charles A. |journal=Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences |volume=46 |issue=11 |pages=1895–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2177">'''Pediatric urology''' is a surgical subspecialty of medicine dealing with the disorders of children's genitourinary systems. Pediatric urologists provide care for both boys and girls ranging from birth to early adult age. The most common problems are those involving disorders of urination, reproductive organs and testes.

==Focus areas==
Some of the problems they deal with are:
*[[Urinary bladder|Bladder]] control problems such as [[bedwetting]] and daytime [[urinary incontinence]]
*Undescended testes ([[cryptorchidism]])
*[[Hypospadias]]
* Epispadias
*[[Urolithiasis]] (bladder and kidney stones)
*[[Chordee]] and other minor malformations of the [[penis]]
*[[Phimosis]]
*[[Urinary obstruction]] and [[vesicoureteral reflux]]
*[[Neurogenic bladder]] (e.g., associated with [[spina bifida]])
* Antenatal hydronephrosis
*Tumors and cancers of the kidneys
*Repair of genitourinary [[physical trauma|trauma]]
*Genitourinary malformations and birth defects
**[[Prune belly syndrome]]
**[[Cloacal exstrophy]], [[bladder exstrophy]], and [[epispadias]]
**[[Ambiguous genitalia]] and [[intersex]] conditions

==Pediatric urologists==
In North America, most pediatric urologists are associated with [[children's hospital]]s. Training for [[board certification]] in pediatric urology typically consists of a surgery internship as part of a urology [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] followed by subspecialty training in pediatric urology at a major children's hospital. In India, Pediatric Urology is practiced by Pediatric Surgeons with a special interest/ training in pediatric urology as well as by adult urologists who get trained in Pediatric Urology.

'''Poolburn Reservoir''', also known as '''Poolburn Dam''', is a reservoir in [[Central Otago]]. Built during the [[Great Depression]] for irrigation but also as an employment initiative, the water is used by farmers in the [[Ida Valley]].

==Geography==
The reservoir is located west of the Rough Ridge Range. Long Valley Creek feeds the reservoir, and the reservoir itself feeds the Pool Burn. The Pool Burn flows into the [[Ida Valley]], combines with the Ida Burn, and breaks through the [[Raggedy Range]] as the [[Poolburn Gorge]] before flowing into the [[Manuherikia River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.topomap.co.nz/NZTopoMap/nz18737/Poolburn-Reservoir/Otago | title=Poolburn Reservoir, Otago | publisher=NZ Topo Map | accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access==
There is access to Poolburn Reservoir from either [[Omakau]] in the Manuherikia Valley ({{convert|30|km|disp=or}}) or from [[Oturehua]] in the Ida Valley ({{convert|43|km|disp=or}}).&lt;ref name=OCRT /&gt; There is also access from [[Paerau]] over the [[Rock and Pillar Range]] ({{convert|24|km|disp=or}}), but this is a dry-weather road only that can be negotiated by [[four-wheel drive]] only, and is not generally recommended.&lt;ref name="Poolburn Dam by Central Otago" /&gt; The high parts of the road are closed from early June to late September each year, and Poolburn Reservoir thus cannot be accessed by road during winter. The road from Paerau to the Ida Valley via Poolburn Reservoir is part of the Old Dunstan Road that gave gold diggers access to the gold fields during the early days of the [[Otago Gold Rush]]. The journey from [[Dunedin]] to the gold fields took five days. An alternative route to the gold fields starting in [[Palmerston, New Zealand|Palmerston]] was longer by {{convert|50|km}} but much easier to travel on, as it did cross any mountainous ranges or major rivers. This became the major wagon route and is today [[New Zealand State Highway 85|State Highway 85]]. With no major settlements along its way, much of the Old Dunstan Road was never fully formed, resulting in only seasonal access to Poolburn Reservoir.&lt;ref name="Dunstan Road"&gt;{{cite web | first1=John | last1=Douglas | url=http://www.wildflowerwalks.co.nz/wildflowerwalks/olddunstanroad.html | title=The Mountain Road / Dunstan Road | publisher=New Zealand South | accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2004, council staff fly in by helicopter to lock the mountainous roads each winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1=Brown | first1=Diane | title=Central Otago Helicopters a waste: farmers | url=http://www.odt.co.nz/regions/central-otago/8619/central-otago-helicopters-waste-farmers | accessdate=7 April 2015 | work=[[Otago Daily Times]] | date=6 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A deputation went to see the [[Minister of Labour (New Zealand)|Minister of Labour]] and [[Minister of Transport (New Zealand)|Transport]], [[Bill Veitch]], in March 1929 with regards to a proposal for an irrigation dam for the benefit of Ida Valley farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Irrigation Scheme | url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=EP19290323.2.61 | accessdate=7 April 2015 | work=[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|The Evening Post]] | volume=CVII | issue=68 | date=23 March 1929 | page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Government of New Zealand|United Government]] approved the scheme by September of that year, partially as an employment initiative during the [[Great Depression]], and charged the [[New Zealand Ministry of Works|Department of Public Works]] with its construction&lt;ref name="Press approval"&gt;{{cite news |title=Central Otago Irrigation | url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=CHP19290905.2.39 | accessdate=7 April 2015 | work=[[The Press]] | volume=LXV | issue=19716 | date=5 September 1929 | page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and put [[New Zealand pound|£]]71,823 into the 1930 budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Budget | url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=CHP19300725.2.101 | accessdate=7 April 2015 | work=[[The Press]] | volume=LXVI | issue=19989 | date=25 July 1930 | page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary work, including the construction of the access road from the Ida Valley, started in late 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Public Works | url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=CHP19291026.2.148 | accessdate=7 April 2015 | work=[[The Press]] | volume=LXV | issue=19760 | date=26 October 1929 | page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Minister of Public Works (New Zealand)|Minister of Public Works]], [[William Burgoyne Taverner]], reported in August 1930 that the excavation for the concrete arch dam had been filled to approximately ground level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Political Notes | url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=CHP19300828.2.92 | accessdate=7 April 2015 | work=[[The Press]] | volume=LXVI | issue=20018 | date=28 August 1930 | page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poolburn Reservoir was completed by late 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Public Works Statement | url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=CHP19311103.2.129 | accessdate=7 April 2015 | work=[[The Press]] | volume=LXVII | issue=20384 | date=3 November 1931 | page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reservoir is located on the Old Dunstan Road and the flooded area had five hotels.&lt;ref name="Poolburn Dam by Central Otago" /&gt;

The concrete arch dam is about {{convert|100|ft}} high and {{convert|480|ft}} long at the dam's crest. Approximately {{convert|14000|cuyd}} of concrete were used to construct the dam.&lt;ref name="Press approval" /&gt; During construction, scaffolding collapsed resulting in seven men sustaining injuries, with two men initially in critical condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Scaffolding Collapses | url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=NZH19301119.2.57 | accessdate=7 April 2015 | work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] | volume=LXVII | issue=20725 | date=19 November 1930 | page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1931, one worker died from a fall at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Fall from Rope Ladder | url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=NZH19310612.2.51 | accessdate=7 April 2015 | work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] | volume=LXVIII | issue=20897 | date=12 June 1931 | page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the dam is administered by the Ida Valley Irrigation Company.&lt;ref name="Poolburn Dam by Central Otago"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.centralotagonz.com/poolburn-dam | title=Poolburn Dam | publisher=Central Otago | accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When full, the reservoir covers over {{convert|300|ha|sqkm}}.&lt;ref name="Poolburn Dam by Central Otago" /&gt; Poolburn Reservoir and Poolburn Dam are alternative names for the same body of water.&lt;ref name=OCRT /&gt;

==Usage==
[[Brown trout]] and [[rainbow trout]] were introduced into the reservoir, but only brown trout remain.&lt;ref name="Poolburn Dam by Central Otago" /&gt; The other aquatic species that can be caught is the New Zealand freshwater crayfish [[Paranephrops|koura]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite sign | url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Poolburn_Reservoir_694.JPG | title=Koura | publisher=[[Ministry of Fisheries (New Zealand)|Ministry of Fisheries]] | accessdate=7 April 2015 | type=Sign on access road | year=2015 | location=Poolburn Reservoir}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poolburn Reservoir was used to depict [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' film trilogy.&lt;ref name="OCRT"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.otagorailtrail.co.nz/poolburn-accommodation | title=Poolburn | publisher=[[Otago Central Rail Trail]] | accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many [[Bach (New Zealand)|bach]]es around the reservoir. An application to subdivide a {{convert|902|ha}} land holding for housing was withdrawn just prior to the hearing, as the commissioner for the [[Central Otago District Council]] had recommended for consent to be refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1=Brown | first1=Diane | title=Applicant withdraws on eve of hearing | url=http://www.odt.co.nz/the-regions/central-otago/31889/applicant-withdraws-eve-hearing | accessdate=7 April 2015 | work=[[Otago Daily Times]] | date=15 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pulp polyp''', also known as '''chronic hyperplastic pulpitis''', is a "productive" (i.e., growing) inflammation of [[Pulp (tooth)|dental pulp]] in which the development of [[granulation tissue]] is seen, and is characterised by the overgrowth of the tissue outside the boundary of a tooth's pulp chamber.  A pulp polyp may be found in an open [[Dental caries|carious lesion]] ([[tooth]] cavity), in a fractured tooth, or when a [[dental restoration]] is missing. Due to lack of intrapulpal pressure in an open lesion, pulp [[necrosis]] does not take place as would have occurred in a closed caries case. 

The condition is more commonly seen in children and young adults.&lt;ref name=Chandra2008&gt;{{cite book|author1=Chandra S|author2=Chandra G|title=Oral Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EBqYie7BGsYC&amp;pg=PA39|date=30 May 2008|publisher=Jaypee Brothers Publishers|isbn=978-81-8448-145-7|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good [[vascular]] and immune supply is necessary for such a condition to develop.

== Development ==

The QLDS was developed by Galen Research in 1992 and was funded by Lilly Industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0168-8510(92)90005-V |title=A new measure of quality of life in depression: Testing the reliability and construct validity of the QLDS |year=1992 |last1=McKenna |first1=Stephen P. |last2=Hunt |first2=Sonja M. |journal=Health Policy |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=321–30 |pmid=10122731}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed in the United Kingdom.

The items in the QLDS were derived from statements made in [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] interviews by 30 depressed or recently recovered patients. Further interviews were held with patients in order to assess whether the proposed scale had face and content validity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0168-8510(92)90004-U |title=The QLDS: A scale for the measurement of quality of life in depression |year=1992 |last1=Hunt |first1=Sonja M. |last2=McKenna |first2=Stephen P. |journal=Health Policy |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=307–19 |pmid=10122730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its development, the QLDS has been adapted and validated in 12 languages other than UK English,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Measures Database |url=http://www.galen-research.com/measures-database/ |publisher=Galen Research |accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Norwegian&lt;ref name="berle" /&gt; and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0924-9338(99)00230-8 |title=The development and validation of a Spanish version of the quality of life in depression scale (QLDS) |year=1999 |last1=Cervera-Enguix |first1=S |last2=Ramírez |first2=N |last3=Girala |first3=N |last4=McKenna |first4=S.P |journal=European Psychiatry |volume=14 |issue=7 |pages=392–8 |pmid=10683624}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This has allowed the QLDS to be used in research and clinical studies worldwide.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26270">In the United States, several federal agencies and laws have some jurisdiction over pollution from ships in U.S. waters. [[U.S. states|States]] and [[Local government in the United States|local government]] agencies also have responsibilities for ship-related pollution in some situations.

==International laws and regulations==
{{See also|MARPOL 73/78|Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships}}
[[MARPOL 73/78]] (the "International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution From Ships") is one of the most important treaties regulating [[ship pollution|pollution from ships]]. Six Annexes of the Convention cover the various sources of pollution from ships and provide an overarching framework for international objectives. In the U.S., the Convention is implemented through the [[Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships]] (APPS).&lt;ref name="APPS"&gt;Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships, {{usc|33|1901|1915}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the provisions of the Convention, the United States can take direct enforcement action under U.S. laws against [[flag of convenience|foreign-flagged]] ships when pollution discharge incidents occur within U.S. jurisdiction. When incidents occur outside U.S. jurisdiction or jurisdiction cannot be determined, the United States refers cases to flag states, in accordance with MARPOL. These procedures require substantial coordination between the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], and other flag states, and the response rate from flag states has been poor.&lt;ref name="GAO 2000"&gt;U.S. Government Accountability Office, Washington, D.C. (2000). [http://www.gao.gov/assets/230/228813.pdf "Progress Made to Reduce Marine Pollution by Cruise Ships, but Important Issues Remain."] Report to Congressional Requesters. Report No. RCED-00-48.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19–21}} Different regulations apply to vessels, depending on the individual state.&lt;ref&gt;ANCO Maritime Activities Ltd., Piraeus, Greece (2011-04-11). [http://www.ancomaritime.com/files/USCG_Regulations.html "Update to USCG requirements."]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal laws and regulations==
{{See also|Environmental policy of the United States}}
In the United States, several federal agencies have some jurisdiction over ships in U.S. waters, but no one agency is responsible for or coordinates all of the relevant government functions. The U.S. Coast Guard and [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) have principal regulatory and standard-setting responsibilities, and the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] prosecutes violations of federal laws. EPA and the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DOD) are jointly issuing ''[[Regulation of ship pollution in the United States#Uniform National Discharge Standards for armed forces vessels|Uniform National Discharge Standards]]'' ("UNDS") for armed forces vessels. In addition, the Department of State represents the United States at meetings of the [[International Maritime Organization|IMO]] and in international treaty negotiations and is responsible for pursuing foreign-flag violations. Other federal agencies have limited roles and responsibilities. For example, the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA, Department of Commerce) works with the Coast Guard and EPA to report on the effects of [[marine debris]]. The [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] (APHIS) is responsible for ensuring [[quarantine]] inspection and disposal of food-contaminated garbage.  These APHIS responsibilities are part of the Department of Agriculture.  In some cases, states and localities have responsibilities as well.

===Vessels General Permit===
EPA issued its most recent ''Vessels General Permit,'' under the [[NPDES|National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System]] (NPDES), a [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA) program, in 2013. The permit applies to large commercial vessels ({{convert|79|ft|m}} in length or greater) (except fishing vessels) and regulates 26 specific types of vessel discharges:
#Deck Washdown and Runoff and Above Water Line Hull Cleaning
#[[Bilge water]]/Oily Water Separator Effluent
#[[Ballast water]]
#Anti-fouling Hull Coatings/Hull Coating Leachate
#[[Aqueous film forming foam]] (AFFF)
#Boiler/Economizer Blowdown
#[[Cathodic protection]]
#Chain Locker Effluent
#Controllable Pitch Propeller and Thruster Hydraulic Fluid and other Oil Sea Interfaces including Lubrication Discharges from Paddle Wheel Propulsion, Stern Tubes, Thruster Bearings, Stabilizers, Rudder Bearings, Azimuth Thrusters, and Propulsion Pod Lubrication, and Wire Rope and Mechanical #Equipment Subject to Immersion
#Distillation and Reverse Osmosis Brine
#Elevator Pit Effluent
#Firemain Systems
#Freshwater Layup
#Gas Turbine Washwater
#[[Graywater]] (except certain commercial vessels operating in the Great Lakes)
#Motor Gasoline and Compensating Discharge
#Non-Oily Machinery Wastewater
#Refrigeration and Air Condensate Discharge
#Seawater Cooling Overboard Discharge (Including Non-Contact Engine Cooling Water; Hydraulic System Cooling Water, Refrigeration Cooling Water)
#Seawater Piping Biofouling Prevention
#Boat Engine Wet Exhaust
#Sonar Dome Discharge
#Underwater Ship Husbandry
#Welldeck Discharges
#Graywater Mixed with Sewage from Vessels
#Exhaust Gas Scrubber Washwater Discharge.&lt;ref name="VGP-FR"&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington, D.C. (2013-04-12). [https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2013/04/12/2013-08662/final-national-pollutant-discharge-elimination-system-npdes-general-permit-for-discharges-incidental "Final National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) General Permit for Discharges Incidental to the Normal Operation of a Vessel."] ''Federal Register.'' 78 FR 21938.&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 69,000 vessels, both domestic and foreign flagged, are covered by the VGP.&lt;ref name="EPA-VGP"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/vessels-vgp |title=Vessels-VGP |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-05-13 |website=NPDES |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EPA issued its ''Small Vessels General Permit'' (sVGP) for smaller commercial vessels in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;EPA (2014-09-10). Final National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Small Vessel General Permit for Discharges Incidental to the Normal Operation of Vessels Less Than 79 Feet. ''Federal Register.'' {{Federal Register|79|53702}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/vessels-svgp |title=Vessels-sVGP |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-05-13 |website=NPDES |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; however this permit currently only applies to ballast water. A Congressionally-imposed moratorium applied to graywater and other wastestreams for these vessels, and commercial fishing vessels of any size, until January 19, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;United States. ''An Act to extend the period during which vessels that are shorter than 79 feet in length and fishing vessels are not required to have a permit for discharges incidental to the normal operation of the vessel.'' {{USPL|115|100}}. Approved 2018-01-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sewage===
Commercial vessels discharging sewage, except fishing vessels, are subject to the VGP or SVGP requirements. Recreational vessels are exempt from the permit requirements, but vessel operators must implement [[Best management practice for water pollution|Best Management Practices]] to control their discharges.&lt;ref&gt;Clean Water Act sec. 402(r), {{USC|33|1342(r)}}. This provision was added by the [[Clean Boating Act of 2008]], {{USPL|110|288}}, July 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Marine sanitation devices====
Section 312 of the CWA prohibits the dumping of untreated or inadequately treated sewage from vessels into the navigable waters of the United States (defined as within {{convert|3|mi|km}} of shore). It is implemented jointly by EPA and the Coast Guard. Under commercial and recreational vessels with installed [[toilet]]s are required to have [[marine sanitation device]]s (MSDs), which are designed to prevent the discharge of untreated sewage. EPA is responsible for developing performance standards for MSDs, and the Coast Guard is responsible for MSD design and operation regulations and for certifying MSD compliance with the EPA rules. MSDs are designed either to hold sewage for shore-based disposal or to treat sewage prior to discharge.

The Coast Guard regulations cover three types of MSDs.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Coast Guard, Washington, D.C. "Marine Sanitation Devices." ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{USCFR|33|159}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Large vessels use either Type II or Type III MSDs. In Type II MSDs, the waste is either chemically or biologically treated prior to discharge and must meet limits of no more than 200 [[fecal coliforms]] per 100 [[liter#SI prefixes applied to the litre|milliliter]]s and no more than 150 [[gram#SI multiples|milligram]]s per liter of [[suspended solids]]. Type III MSDs store wastes and do not treat them; the waste is pumped out later and treated in an onshore system or discharged outside U.S. waters. Type I MSDs use chemicals to disinfect the raw sewage prior to discharge and must meet a performance standard for fecal coliform bacteria of not greater than 1,000 per 100 milliliters and no visible floating solids. Type I MSDs are generally only found on recreational vessels or others under {{convert|65|ft|m}} in length. The regulations, which have not been revised since 1976, do not require ship operators to sample, monitor, or report on their [[effluent]] discharges.

Critics point out a number of deficiencies with this regulatory structure as it affects large vessels. First, the MSD regulations only cover discharges of bacterial contaminants and suspended solids, while the NPDES permit program for other point sources typically regulates many more pollutants such as [[chemical substance|chemical]]s, [[pesticide]]s, [[heavy metals]], [[oil]], and [[grease (lubricant)|grease]] that may be released by large vessels as well as land-based sources. Second, sources subject to NPDES permits must comply with sampling, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements, which do not exist in the MSD rules.

In addition, the Coast Guard, responsible for inspecting vessels for compliance with the MSD rules, has been heavily criticized for poor enforcement of Section 312 requirements. In its 2000 report, the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) said that Coast Guard inspectors "rarely have time during scheduled ship examinations to inspect sewage treatment equipment or filter systems to see if they are working properly and filtering out potentially harmful contaminants."&lt;ref name="GAO 2000" /&gt;{{rp|34–5}} GAO reported that a number of factors limit the ability of Coast Guard inspectors to detect violations of environmental law and rules, including the inspectors' focus on safety, the large size some ships, limited time and staff for inspections, and the lack of an element of surprise concerning inspections. The Coast Guard carries out a wide range of responsibilities that encompass both [[homeland security]] ([[port]]s, [[waterway]]s, and coastal security, defense readiness, [[War on Drugs|drug]] and migrant interdiction) and non-homeland security ([[search and rescue]], marine environmental protection, fisheries enforcement, [[navigational aid|aids to navigation]]). Since the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks]] on the United States, the Coast Guard has focused more of its resources on homeland security activities. One likely result is that less of the Coast Guard's time and attention are available for vessel inspections for MSD or other environmental compliance.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Annex IV of MARPOL was drafted to regulate sewage discharges from vessels. It has entered into force internationally and would apply to ships that are flagged in ratifying countries, but because the United States has not ratified Annex IV, it is not mandatory that ships follow it when in U.S. waters. However, its requirements are minimal, even compared with U.S. rules for MSDs. Annex IV requires that vessels be equipped with a certified sewage treatment system or holding tank, but it prescribes no specific performance standards. Within three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) of shore, Annex IV requires that sewage discharges be treated by a certified MSD prior to discharge. Between three and {{convert|12|mi|km}} from shore, sewage discharges must be treated by no less than [[maceration (sewage)|maceration]] or [[Water chlorination|chlorination]]; sewage  discharges beyond {{convert|12|mi|km}} from shore are unrestricted. Vessels are permitted to meet alternative, less stringent requirements when they are in the jurisdiction of countries where less stringent requirements apply. In U.S. waters, vessels must comply with the regulations implementing Section 312 of the Clean Water Act.

On some ships, especially many of those that travel in [[Alaska]]n waters, sewage is treated using Advanced Wastewater Treatment (AWT) systems that generally provide improved screening, treatment, [[disinfectant|disinfection]], and [[sewage sludge treatment|sludge processing]] as compared with traditional Type II MSDs. AWTs are believed to be very effective in removing [[pathogen]]s, [[biochemical oxygen demand|oxygen demanding]] substances, suspended solids, oil and grease, and particulate metals from sewage, but only moderately effective in removing dissolved metals and [[nutrient]]s ([[ammonia]], [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]]).

====No-discharge zones====
Section 312 has another means of addressing sewage discharges, through establishment of no-discharge zones (NDZs) for vessel sewage. A state may completely prohibit the discharge of both treated and untreated sewage from all vessels with installed toilets into some or all waters over which it has jurisdiction (up to {{convert|3|mi|km}} from land). To create a no-discharge zone to protect waters from sewage discharges by vessels, the state must apply to EPA under one of three categories.
# NDZ based on the need for greater [[environmentalism|environmental protection]], and the state demonstrates that adequate pumpout facilities for safe and sanitary removal and treatment of sewage from all vessels are reasonably available. As of 2017, this category of designation has been used for 72 areas representing part or all of the waters of 26 states, including a number of inland states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/vessels-marinas-and-ports/no-discharge-zones-ndzs-state |title=No-Discharge Zones by State |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-08-18 |website=Vessels, Marinas and Ports |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# NDZ for special waters found to have a particular environmental importance (e.g., to protect environmentally sensitive areas such as [[shellfish]] beds or [[coral reef]]s); it is not necessary for the state to show pumpout availability. This category of designation has been used twice (state waters within the [[Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary]] and the Boundary Waters Canoe area of Minnesota).
# NDZ to prohibit the discharge of sewage into waters that are [[drinking water]] intake zones; it is not necessary for the state to show pumpout availability. This category of designation has been used to protect part of the [[Hudson River]] in [[New York (state)|New York]].

===State graywater requirements===
Pursuant to a state law in [[Alaska]], graywater must be treated prior to discharge into that state's waters.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Solid waste===
Ship discharges of solid waste are governed by two laws. Title I of the [[Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act]] (MPRSA) applies to cruise ships and other vessels and makes it illegal to transport garbage from the United States for the purpose of dumping it into ocean waters without a permit or to dump any material transported from a location outside the United States into U.S. territorial seas or the [[territorial waters#Contiguous zone|contiguous zone]] (within {{convert|12|nmi|km}} from shore) or ocean waters.&lt;ref&gt;Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act. {{USC|33|1402-1421}}.&lt;/ref&gt; EPA is responsible for issuing permits that regulate the disposal of materials at sea (except for dredged material disposal, for which the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] is responsible). Beyond waters that are under U.S. jurisdiction, no MPRSA permit is required for a ship to discharge solid waste. The routine discharge of effluent incidental to the propulsion of vessels is explicitly exempted from the definition of dumping in the MPRSA.

The [[Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships]] (APPS) and its regulations, which implement U.S.-ratified provisions of MARPOL, also apply to ships.&lt;ref name="APPS"/&gt; APPS prohibits the discharge of all garbage within {{convert|3|nmi|km}} of shore, certain types of garbage within {{convert|12|nmi|km}} offshore, and [[plastic]] anywhere. It applies to all vessels, whether seagoing or not, regardless of flag, operating in U.S. navigable waters and the [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] (EEZ). It is administered by the Coast Guard, which carries out inspection programs to insure the adequacy of port facilities to receive offloaded solid waste.

===Hazardous waste===
The [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (RCRA) is the primary federal law that governs hazardous waste management through a "[[life cycle assessment|cradle-to-grave]]" program that controls [[hazardous waste]] from the point of generation until ultimate disposal.&lt;ref&gt;Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, {{usc|42|6901|6991k}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The act imposes management requirements on generators, transporters, and persons who treat or dispose of hazardous waste. Under this act, a waste is hazardous if it is [[Combustion|ignitable]], [[corrosive]], [[chemical reaction|reactive]], or [[toxicity|toxic]], or appears on a list of about 100 industrial process waste streams and more than 500 discarded commercial products and [[chemical substance|chemical]]s. Treatment, storage, and disposal facilities are required to have permits and comply with operating standards and other EPA regulations.

The owner or operator of a ship may be a generator and/or a transporter of hazardous waste, and thus subject to RCRA rules. Issues that the ship industry may face relating to RCRA include ensuring that hazardous waste is identified at the point at which it is considered generated; ensuring that parties are properly identified as generators, storers, treaters, or disposers; and determining the applicability of RCRA requirements to each. Hazardous waste generated onboard ships is stored onboard until the wastes can be offloaded for [[recycling]] or disposal in accordance with RCRA.

A range of activities on board cruise generate hazardous wastes and [[poison|toxic substance]]s that would ordinarily be presumed to be subject to RCRA. Ships are potentially subject to RCRA requirements to the extent that chemicals used for operations such as ship maintenance and passenger services result in the generation of hazardous wastes. However, it is not entirely clear what regulations apply to the management and disposal of these wastes.30 RCRA rules that cover small-quantity generators (those that generate more than 100 kilograms but less than 1,000 kilograms of hazardous waste per month) are less stringent than those for large-quantity generators (generating more than 1,000 kilograms per month), and it is unclear whether ships are classified as large or small generators of hazardous waste. Moreover, some ship companies argue that they generate less than 100 kilograms per month and therefore should be classified in a third category, as "conditionally exempt small-quantity generators," a categorization that allows for less rigorous requirements for notification, recordkeeping, and the like.

A release of hazardous substances by a vessel could also theoretically trigger coverage under the [[Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act]] (CERCLA; also known as "Superfund.").&lt;ref&gt;Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, {{usc|42|9601|9675}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to RCRA, hazardous waste discharges from ships are subject to Section 311 of the Clean Water Act, which prohibits the discharge of hazardous substances in harmful quantities into or upon the [[navigability|navigable waters]] of the United States, adjoining [[shore]]lines, or into or upon the waters of the [[territorial waters#Contiguous zone|contiguous zone]].

===Bilge water===
Section 311 of the Clean Water Act, as amended by the [[Oil Pollution Act of 1990]],&lt;ref&gt;Oil Pollution Act of 1990, {{usc|33|2701|2720}}.&lt;/ref&gt; applies to ships and prohibits discharge of oil or hazardous substances in harmful quantities into or upon U.S. navigable waters, or into or upon the waters of the contiguous zone, or which may affect [[natural resource]]s in the U.S. [[Exclusive Economic Zone|EEZ]] (extending {{convert|200|mi|km}} offshore). Coast Guard regulations prohibit discharge of oil within {{convert|12|mi|km}} from shore, unless passed through a 15-[[Parts per million|ppm]] oil water separator, and unless the discharge does not cause a visible sheen.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Coast Guard. "Part 155—Oil or Hazardous Material Pollution Prevention Regulations for Vessels." {{USCFR|33|155.360}}-155.380.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond {{convert|12|mi|km}}, oil or oily mixtures can be discharged while a vessel is proceeding en route and if the oil content without dilution is less than 100 ppm. Vessels are required to maintain an Oil Record Book to record disposal of oily residues and discharges overboard or disposal of [[bilge]] water.

In addition to Section 311 requirements, APPS implements MARPOL Annex I concerning [[oil spill|oil pollution]]. APPS applies to all U.S. flagged ships anywhere in the world and to all [[flag state|foreign flag]]ged vessels operating in the navigable waters of the United States, or while at a port under U.S. jurisdiction. To implement APPS, the Coast Guard has promulgated regulations prohibiting the discharge of oil or oily mixtures into the sea within {{convert|12|nmi|km}} of the nearest land, except under limited conditions. However, because many ships are foreign registered and because APPS only applies to foreign ships within U.S. [[navigability|navigable]] waters, the APPS regulations have limited applicability to ship operations.

===Ballast water discharge limitations===
The VGP sets numeric ballast water discharge limits for large commercial vessels. The limits are expressed as the maximum acceptable concentration of living organisms per cubic meter of ballast water.&lt;ref name="EPA-VGP"/&gt; The Coast Guard worked with EPA in developing the scientific basis and the regulatory requirements in the VGP.&lt;ref name="VGP-FR"/&gt;

===Uniform National Discharge Standards for armed forces vessels===
[[File:Ship discharges diagram EPA.gif|thumb|right|Illustration of some of the discharge types subject to UNDS regulations.]]
Congress amended the CWA in 1996 to require development of uniform national discharge standards ("UNDS") for military vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Clean Water Act, section 312(n), {{USC|33|1322(n)}}, {{uspl|104|106}}, {{USStat|110|254-259}}, approved 1996-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt; The standards are being developed jointly by EPA and DOD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/vessels-marinas-and-ports/uniform-national-discharge-standards-unds-rulemaking-process |title=Uniform National Discharge Standards (UNDS): Rulemaking Process |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-03-17 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial regulations were published in 1999, to identify and characterize a wide variety of discharge types from ships and boats.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) and EPA (1999-05-10). "Uniform National Discharge Standards for Vessels of the Armed Forces; Final Rule." ''Federal Register,'' {{usfr|64|25126}}; {{uscfr|40|1700}}&lt;/ref&gt; A final rule setting specific standards for 11 discharge types was published in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;DOD and EPA (2017-01-11). "Uniform National Discharge Standards for Vessels of the Armed Forces-Phase II Batch One." ''Federal Register,'' {{usfr|82|3173}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A proposed regulation covering 11 additional discharge categories was published in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;DOD and EPA (2016-10-07). "Uniform National Discharge Standards for Vessels of the Armed Forces-Phase II Batch Two." ''Federal Register,'' {{usfr|81|69753}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of vessels covered belong to the [[U.S. Navy]], but the regulations also cover vessels of the Coast Guard, [[U.S. Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], [[U.S. Army|Army]], [[U.S. Military Sealift Command|Military Sealift Command]], and [[U.S. Air Force|Air Force]], totalling over 7,000 vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=1999 |title=Phase I Final Rule and Technical Development Document of Uniform National Discharge Standards (UNDS) |chapter=Section 2: Vessels of the Armed Forces |url=https://www.epa.gov/vessels-marinas-and-ports/uniform-national-discharge-standards-unds-phase-i-final-rule |publisher=EPA |page=2-1 |id=EPA 842-R-99-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2103">'''Robert W. McNulty''' (1897-1966) was a dental educator. He was president of the [[American Dental Education Association]] in 1960 (a title changed to Chairman of the Board of Directors of the American Dental Education Association in 2013). 

==Biography==

Born in [[Braidwood, Illinois]], McNulty graduated [[D.D.S.]] from Chicago's [[Loyola University School of Dentistry]] in 1926. He later in the 1940s served as dean of the Loyola University Dental School and as a president of the Illinois State Dental Society, becoming a nationally known author and lecturer on the problems of dental education. 

From 1950 till 1965 when he retired, Dr. McNulty was Dean of Los Angeles' [[USC Dental School]]. The USC Dental School's Robert W. McNulty Memorial Award for Scholastic Achievement is named in his honor. The Loyola University School of Dentistry inducted Dr. McNulty as the 11th member of its Hall of Fame. 

McNulty was a Fellow of the American College of Dentists and a member of the American Academy of Dental History.&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Tribune'', Thursday April 29, 1965, Section 1B, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Sunday Tribune'', March 31, 1946, Part 3, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mocavo.com/Usc-1959-Los-Angeles-Ca/242399/213#213], 1959 ''El Rodeo of Southern California''.

'''Salvador Zubirán Anchondo''' (23 December 1898, [[Cusihuiriachic]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] – 10 June 1998, [[Mexico City]]) was one of Mexico's most prominent [[physicians]] and [[nutritionist]]s.

==Biography==
He received his MD from the [[UNAM|National University of Mexico]] (UNAM) [[Faculty of Medicine (UNAM)|Faculty of Medicine]] and visited the [[Peter Bent Brigham Hospital]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], United States, from 1924 to 1925, where he received a diploma.

Upon his return to Mexico he started the nutrition department in Mexico City's General Hospital, and later received an assignment to start the [[National Institute of Nutrition]] (now the [[Salvador Zubirán National Institute of Health Sciences and Nutrition|Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y de la Nutrición Salvador Zubirán]], or INNSZ), one of the country's premier medical institutions. Zubirán also served as the rector of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (UNAM) during the 1940s; during this appointment, he was very influential in the creation of the [[Ciudad Universitaria|University City]].

In 1985, in [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]], he married María Luisa López-Collada Márquez de Richardson, the widow of American banker William B. Richardson II. By this marriage, he became the stepfather of the American politician and one-time presidential hopeful  [[Bill Richardson]].

He was a recipient of the [[National Prize for Arts and Sciences]] in 1968 and of 
the [[Belisario Domínguez Medal of Honor]], the highest honor awarded by the [[Senate of Mexico]], in 1986.

== Tanning ==
[[File:Tanning bed in use.jpg|thumb|227x227px|sun bed tanning]]
Australians culturally identify with the "bronzed Aussie" stereotype,{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}, viewing it as a positive body image associated with recreational sport and exercise-orientated lifestyles.

[[Tanning bed|Solariums]] and [[Tanning bed|tanning]] salons are widely used and available throughout Australia{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}. Tanning has been a phenomenon since the 1800s, with medical use of [[phototherapy]], emerging popularity of [[sunbathing]], and in the 1970s,  with tanning salons and solariums becoming increasingly popular,  had developed into a worldwide tanning industry.&lt;ref name="Levine"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The indoor UV tanning industry: A review of skin cancer risk, health benefit claims, and regulation|journal = Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology|date = 1 January 2005|volume = 53|issue = 6|doi = 10.1016/j.jaad.2005.07.066|first = Jody A.|last = Levine|first2 = Michael|last2 = Sorace|first3 = James|last3 = Spencer|first4 = Daniel M.|last4 = Siegel|pages = 1038–1044|pmid = 16310065}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the tanning industry in Australia is relatively small by international standards, it has quadrupled in size since 1992.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Estimation of avoidable skin cancers and cost-savings to government associated with regulation of the solarium industry in Australia|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0168851008001620|journal = Health Policy|date = 1 January 2009|volume = 89|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.healthpol.2008.07.003|pmid = 18760857|first = Nicholas|last = Hirst|first2 = Louisa|last2 = Gordon|first3 = Peter|last3 = Gies|first4 = Adèle C.|last4 = Green|pages = 303–311|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180320074517/https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0168851008001620|archivedate = 20 March 2018|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tanning industry promotes tanning as a process to stimulate higher levels of vitamin D, associating it with reduced likelihood of sunburn and [[skin cancer]], with increased well being and feelings of happiness.&lt;ref name="Levine"/&gt;

=== Solarium regulation ===
The solarium industry is regulated on a state by state basis. The first states to regulate solarium use (2008) were [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[South Australia]] and [[Western Australia]] following the death of skin cancer victim [[Clare Oliver]].&lt;ref name="Victorian Government 2005"&gt;Victorian Government. Radiation (Tanning Units Amendment) interim regulations 2007 Under section 139 of the Radiation Act 2005. Vol. STATUTORY RULE No. 148/2007, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;South Australia. Radiation protection and control (cosmetic tanning units) regulations 2008 under the Radiation protection and control act 1982, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Radiation Safety Act 1975 Radiation Safety (General) Regulations 1983. Western Australia, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Makin J, Dobbinson SJ. Changes in solarium numbers in Australia following negative media and legislation. Australian &amp; New Zealand Journal of Public Health 2009; 33 (5): 491-494.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2008 regulations required solaria to obtain a license, display health warnings. In Victoria, those under 16 and people with fair skin were banned from solaria and 16-17 year olds were required to have parental consent whereas in South Australia and Western Australia, under 18s were banned.&lt;ref name="Victorian Government 2005"/&gt;

In February 2009, the Victorian Government introduced license changes, including banning under 18s, consistent with the revised Australian standard, released in January 2009. Victorian solarium legalisation was revised in late 2010, strengthening controls around citing evidence of age documents for under 18s.&lt;ref&gt;Victorian Government. Radiation Amendment (Tanning Units and Fees) Regulations 2008 Under section 139 of the Radiation Act 2005. Vol. STATUTORY RULE No. 167/2008, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SASNZ"&gt;Standards Australia/Standards New Zealand. Australian/New Zealand Standard AS/NZS 2635 (Solaria for cosmetic purposes): Standards Australia/Standards New Zealand, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gies P, Javorniczky J, Henderson S, McLennan A, Roy C, Lock J, Lynga C, Melbourne A, Gordon L. UVR emissions from solaria in Australia and implications for the regulation process Photochemistry and Photobiology 2011; 87 (1): 184-190.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Department of Health. Management licence conditions for the possession of a commercial tanning unit. Melbourne: Victorian Government, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian standard requires that operators must:&lt;ref name="SASNZ" /&gt;
* ban people under 18s; 
* sight evidence-of-age documents for those who may be under 18; 
* ban people with very fair skin (skin type I); 
* provide mandatory health warnings; 
* provide a consent form outlining the risks of solarium use for customers to read and sign;
* complete a skin assessment of each client;
* ensure all staff have completed training in carrying out skin assessments and determining exposure times;
* ensure clients wear protective eyewear.
New South Wales, Queensland, ACT and Tasmania introduced legislation applying these standards in 2009 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;New South Wales Government.

=== Ultraviolet radiation and skin cancer ===
[[Melanoma]], [[Basal-cell carcinoma|basal cell carcinomas]] and [[Squamous-cell carcinoma|squamous cell carcinoma]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are predominantly caused by exposure to [[Ultra-violet radiation|ultra violet radiation]] (UVR), and both [[UVB|UVA]] and [[UVB]] radiation has internationally been categorised as carcinogenic.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;  Artificial UVR primarily used in tanning salons and sunbeds, has generated concern among health officials and it was observed to considerably heighten the risk of developing cutaneous malignant melanoma.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A study in 2010 found strong evidence supporting association between indoor tanning salon use and increased risk of developing melanoma.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;.{{Cite journal|title = Sunbed use during adolescence and early adulthood is associated with increased risk of early-onset melanoma|journal = International Journal of Cancer|date = 1 January 2010|pmc = 2993823|pmid = 20669232|volume = 128|issue = 10|doi = 10.1002/ijc.25576|first = Anne E.|last = Cust|first2 = Bruce K.|last2 = Armstrong|first3 = Chris|last3 = Goumas|first4 = Mark A.|last4 = Jenkins|first5 = Helen|last5 = Schmid|first6 = John L.|last6 = Hopper|first7 = Richard F.|last7 = Kefford|first8 = Graham G.|last8 = Giles|first9 = Joanne F.|last9 = Aitken|pages = 2425–2435}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study demonstrated strong correlations between increased risk of [[melanoma]]s and [[carcinogen]]ic ultraviolet radiation related outcomes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These increased risks were specifically associated with younger participants,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; with tanning and solarium use relatively popular among teens and young adults.

== Awareness ==
Australia and New Zealand have the world's highest skin cancer rates.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Factors include the large percentage of the population with fair skin prone to skin cancers and the high levels of ambient UV radiation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Similarly the Anglo-Celtic ancestry of many New Zealanders together with their outdoor lifestyle, is presumed to be a dominant factor in the risk, due to the effect of high UV levels on fair skin.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whiteman|first=David C.|last2=Green|first2=Adele C.|last3=Olsen|first3=Catherine M.|date=June 2016|title=The Growing Burden of Invasive Melanoma: Projections of Incidence Rates and Numbers of New Cases in Six Susceptible Populations through 2031|journal=The Journal of Investigative Dermatology|volume=136|issue=6|pages=1161–1171|doi=10.1016/j.jid.2016.01.035|issn=1523-1747|pmid=26902923}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UV Index (UVI), defined as the sun-burning strength of ultraviolet rays (UVR), in Canada ranges between 1 and 10.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sunsmart.org.nz/sites/default/files/documents/FINAL-Strategy-2017-to-2022.PDF|title=New Zealand Skin Cancer Primary Prevention and Early Detection Steering Committee.|last=|first=|date=May 2017|website=www.sunsmart.org.nz|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614072059/https://www.sunsmart.org.nz//sites/default/files/documents/FINAL-Strategy-2017-to-2022.PDF|archive-date=14 June 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Institute of Water and Atmospheric (NIWA) research recorded that New Zealand (similar latitude to Australia) the UVI exposure often exceeds 13 and is 40% more than that recorded at comparable latitudes in North America.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; In order to maintain effective prevention and national awareness Australia used a variety of campaigns and initiatives beginning in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Skin cancer prevention in Australia|journal = British Journal of Dermatology|date = 1 November 2009|issn = 1365-2133|pages = 116–123|volume = 161|doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2009.09459.x|pmid = 19775367|first = C.|last = Sinclair|first2 = P.|last2 = Foley|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Slip, Slop, Slap]] campaign was initiated in 1981 introduced a seagull singing a catchy jingle “Slip on a shirt!

The first government-funded mass media skin cancer initiative began in Australia during 2006.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; Its skin cancer awareness message was delivered through radio, television and printed mediums.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

Media promotion and education remains a vital and effective tool in Australian skin cancer awareness strategy. Despite its effectiveness{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} members of the public remain indifferent or unaware of the risks caused by inefficient sun protection and skin care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://search.informit.com.au.ipacez.nd.edu.au/documentSummary;dn=TSM201501090146;res=TVNEWS|title = Despite one of the worst skin-cancer rates in the world, and a beach bag full of awareness campaigns over the years, [online]|last = Turner|first = Jessica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mortality ==
[[File:Metastatic Melanoma Cells Nci-vol-9872-300.jpg|thumb|Metastatic melanoma cells]]
Skin cancer has three main forms: [[Basal-cell carcinoma|basal cell carcinoma]], [[Squamous-cell carcinoma|squamous cell carcinoma]] and [[melanoma]]. The first two are the most prevalent forms.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Deaths from non-melanoma skin cancer in Western Australia|journal = Cancer Causes &amp; Control|date = 2 April 2008|issn = 0957-5243|pages = 879–885|volume = 19|issue = 8|doi = 10.1007/s10552-008-9150-9|pmid = 18386140|first = J.|last = Girschik|first2 = Lin|last2 = Fritschi|first3 = T.|last3 = Threlfall|first4 = T.|last4 = Slevin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although generally non-melanoma carcinomas have lower associations with mortality than melanomas, fatalities occur, with 534 reported deaths in 2011.&lt;ref name="Australia"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Non-melanoma - Cancer Council Australia|url = http://www.cancer.org.au/about-cancer/types-of-cancer/skin-cancer/non-melanoma.html|website = www.cancer.org.au|accessdate = 27 August 2015|first = Cancer Council|last = Australia|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150910181744/http://www.cancer.org.au/about-cancer/types-of-cancer/skin-cancer/non-melanoma.html|archivedate = 10 September 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 434,000 Australians in 2008 underwent treatment for non-melanoma carcinomas.&lt;ref name="Australia"/&gt; Melanomas have the highest correlation with mortality, killing 1,544 in 2011.&lt;ref name="Australia"/&gt; Australia shares with New Zealand, the highest diagnosis of melanoma throughout the world and also has the highest diagnosis of non-melanoma carcinomas.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; In 2011, New Zealand surpassed the Australian rate for invasive melanoma cases&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and now has the highest melanoma incidence in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.health.govt.nz/new-zealand-health-system/overview-health-system/funding|title=Funding|work=Ministry of Health NZ|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614071709/https://www.health.govt.nz/new-zealand-health-system/overview-health-system/funding|archive-date=14 June 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trends in melanoma mortality ===
Australia has recorded increased mortality rates of melanoma from the 1950s, continuing to rise until the late 1980s and beginning to steady from 1990 onwards.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; Australia has some of the world's highest melanoma-related fatalities—double the mortality rates of south and central Europe.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; The introduction of preventive campaigns correlate with the transition to decreases in [[melanoma|melanoma mortality]]. Sun protection, other forms of primary protection, early detection and increased public awareness have had the greatest impact.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

== Prevention ==
Awareness and early detection are the most efficient tools for avoiding skin cancer and are the basis of many effective prevention campaigns in Australia. Prevention initiatives such as SunSmart promote awareness by advocating effective sun protective methods, sun risk awareness and are an integral part of skin cancer prevention. SunSmart recommends wearing protective clothing,&lt;ref name="Sun protective clothing - SunSmart"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sun protective clothing - SunSmart|url = http://www.sunsmart.com.au/uv-sun-protection/slip-on-clothing|website = Sun protective clothing - SunSmart|accessdate = 30 August 2015|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150829122416/http://www.sunsmart.com.au/uv-sun-protection/slip-on-clothing|archivedate = 29 August 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; hats,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sun protective hats - SunSmart|url = http://www.sunsmart.com.au/uv-sun-protection/slap-on-a-hat|website = Sun protective hats - SunSmart|accessdate = 30 August 2015|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150829034048/http://www.sunsmart.com.au/uv-sun-protection/slap-on-a-hat|archivedate = 29 August 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; sunscreen,&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sunscreen - SunSmart|url = http://www.sunsmart.com.au/uv-sun-protection/slop-on-sunscreen|website = Sunscreen - SunSmart|accessdate = 30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; seeking shade&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Shade - SunSmart|url = http://www.sunsmart.com.au/uv-sun-protection/seek-shade|website = Shade - SunSmart|accessdate = 30 August 2015|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150906072217/http://www.sunsmart.com.au/uv-sun-protection/seek-shade|archivedate = 6 September 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the sun and wearing UV protective eyeware.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sunglasses - SunSmart|url = http://www.sunsmart.com.au/uv-sun-protection/slide-on-sunglasses|website = Sunglasses - SunSmart|accessdate = 30 August 2015|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150906084759/http://www.sunsmart.com.au/uv-sun-protection/slide-on-sunglasses|archivedate = 6 September 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; SunSmart also provides recommendations on how to choose the right protective products.&lt;ref name="Sun protective clothing - SunSmart"/&gt; Regular skin checks are another important preventive step.
[[File:UV and Vis Sunscreen.jpg|thumb]]
The standard for skin cancer screening in Australia is self-assessment and occasional clinic screening.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.informit.com.au.ipacez.nd.edu.au/documentSummary;dn=581077450891977;res=IELHEA&gt;|title = Skin Checks|last = Sinclair|first = Rodney|date = 2012|journal = Australian Family Physician}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with Australian guidelines for public skin cancer screening, Cancer Council Australia does not recommend annual or regular skin assessment because low national melanoma occurrences do not financially justify national public screening. A 2003 study analysing the effectiveness of skin cancer screening was implemented in northern Germany. Study doctors received 8 hours of training and over a year screened 19% of Schleswig-Holstein’s population.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Initially melanoma detection increased 34%. After 5 years the population experienced over 50% decrease in melanoma mortality.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Economic implications of prevention campaigns ===
Australia spends more than $2 billion annually treating cancer,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cancer Statistics Australia {{!}} ACRF|url = https://acrf.com.au/on-cancer/cancer-statistics-australia/|website = ACRF|accessdate = 29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with skin cancer the most costly. From 2005-15 over $300 million was spent annually on diagnosis, treatment and pathology-related costs of skin cancer. With $512.3 million spent in 2010 on melanoma carcinomas,&lt;ref name="sunsmart.com.au"/&gt; costs continued to rise. The number of life-years lost and loss of productivity both have a bearing on the financial cost of the disease. The direct and indirect expenses of skin cancer in the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW) have been investigated.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doran|first=Christopher M.|last2=Ling|first2=Rod|last3=Byrnes|first3=Joshua|last4=Crane|first4=Melanie|last5=Searles|first5=Andrew|last6=Perez|first6=Donna|last7=Shakeshaft|first7=Anthony|date=2015-09-23|title=Estimating the economic costs of skin cancer in New South Wales, Australia |journal=BMC Public Health|volume=15|issue=1|pages=952|doi=10.1186/s12889-015-2267-3 |pmc=4581089|pmid=26400024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct costs included those resources related to skin cancer management, and indirect costs were concerned with premature mortality and morbidity.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Review of 150 000 skin cancer patients in NSW (2010) revealed a total lifetime cost estimation of AU$536 million, with 72% of this cost related to direct costs, and the remaining 28% to indirect costs; the direct costs were higher in females and indirect costs higher in males.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Prevention initiatives make up an important part of financial expenditure for skin cancer funding and investments. Prevention programs are a productive tool, as they beneficially influence attitudes and behaviours towards skin cancer, but also deliver positive financial returns.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A 2009 study analysed the economic impact of prevention programs such as SunSmart. [[SunSmart]] demonstrated positive health impacts, was cost effective. The Victoria-based program returned $3.60 for every $1 invested. It concluded that [[SunSmart]] prevented 103,000 [[skin cancer]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and more than 1,000 related fatalities from 1988-2003. The study found strong evidence that continued investment and support for SunSmart was economically sound and presented beneficial outcomes for Australia.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shih|first=Sophy Ting-Fang|last2=Carter|first2=Rob|last3=Sinclair|first3=Craig|last4=Mihalopoulos|first4=Cathrine|last5=Vos|first5=Theo|date=1 January 2009|title=Economic evaluation of skin cancer prevention in Australia|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0091743509004204|journal=Preventive Medicine|volume=49|issue=5|doi=10.1016/j.ypmed.2009.09.008|pmid=19747936|pages=449–453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Smoking fetishism''' (also known as '''capnolagnia''') is a [[sexual fetishism|sexual fetish]] based on the [[lung|pulmonary]] consumption ([[smoking]]) of tobacco, most often via [[cigarette]]s, [[cigar]]s, and also, [[pipe smoking|pipe]]s and [[hookah]]s to some extent. As a fetish, its mechanisms regard [[sexual arousal]] from the [[observation]] or [[imagination]] of a person [[smoking]], sometimes including oneself.&lt;ref name="F"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smokingfan.com/category/smoking-fetish-star/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928212838/http://www.smokingfan.com/category/smoking-fetish-star/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-09-28|title=Smoking Fetish Star|date=|accessdate=2013-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Capnolagnia is not considered a disease but an unusual sexual practice, and many of the fetishists do not seek medical help unless this behavior strongly interferes with their daily lives. The majority of people simply learn to accept their fetish and manage to achieve gratification in an appropriate manner.&lt;ref name="I"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/c/capnolagnia/treatments.htm |title=Treatments for Capnolagnia |date=|accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2003 study found that the fetish was not previously the subject of academic study but had been mentioned in "a few newspapers".&lt;ref name=ribisl&gt;Ribisl KM, Lee RE, Henriksen L, Haladjian HH, "A content analysis of Web sites promoting smoking culture and lifestyle", Health Educ Behav. 2003 Feb;30(1):64-78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
[[File:Aketo du groupe Sniper.jpg|thumb|160px|The mannerism of the smoker, as shown here, may also elicit sexual arousal.]]
Like any fetish, the [[classical conditioning|causes]] and [[sexual arousal|mechanisms]] of a smoking fetish vary widely, with roots of [[sexualization|sexual association]] in early [[childhood]] and [[adolescence]]. Typical causes and hypotheses include:

* [[aesthetics]]: mere attraction to, and gratification of, the [[visual]] aspect of [[smoke]] as it exits the mouth
* [[childhood]]: experience or interaction with one or more attractive smoking individuals during childhood
* [[impulsivity]]: perceived [[symbol]]ism of an audacious or impulsivity personality, insinuating [[promiscuity]]
* [[Human behavior|mannerism]]: [[masculine]] or [[feminine]] [[body language]] of smokers
* [[media (communication)|media]]: early exposure to [[sexualization|sexualized]] depictions of smokers, especially from [[advertising media]], the [[film noir]] era, and [[pornography]]&lt;ref name=wallst&gt;{{cite news|last=Hwang|first=Suein|title=Drag Queens: Paula Puffs and Her Fans Watch, Enraptured|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=31 Jan 1996|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[persuasion]]: perceived [[power (social and political)|power]] of convincing or urging another individual to smoke
* [[psychosexual development]]: phenomena in the [[oral stage|oral]] and [[phallic stage|phallic]] stages of childhood development, based on [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] theory
* [[sadomasochism]]: pleasure from infliction of bodily harm caused by smoking, often called "lung damage"
* [[self-confidence]]: perceived confidence or [[masculinity]] of the smoker, regarding taboo or wealth
* [[taboo]]: perceived [[independence]] or [[rebellion]] regarding the act of smoking, amongst cultural adversity to smokers
* [[wealth]]: attraction to individuals who are wealthy enough to fund a cigarette or cigar habit

==Diagnosis==
The diagnostic criteria for fetishism are:
* Unusual [[sexual fantasies]], drives or behavior occur over a time span of at least six months. Sometimes unusual sexual fantasies occur and vanish by themselves; in this case any medical treatment is not necessary.
* The affected person, her object or another person experience impairment or distress in multiple functional areas. Functional area refers to different aspects of life such as private social contacts, job, etc. It is sufficient for the diagnosis if one of the participants is being hurt or mistreated in any other way.

People who experience one or more of the symptoms below are considered to have a smoking fetish:
* Sexual interest in smoking or watching other people smoking.
* Recurring intense sexual fantasies involving smoking or watching other people smoking.
* Recurring intense sexual urges involving smoking or watching other people smoking.&lt;ref name="H"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/c/capnolagnia/symptoms.htm |title=Symptoms of Capnolagnia |date=|accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
Outcome measures in rehabilitation medicine, are tools used to evaluate the level of [[disability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alexander|first=MS|date=2009|title=Outcome measures in spinal cord injury: recent assessments and recommendations for future directions.|url=|journal=Spinal cord|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1038/sc.2009.18|via=|pmc=2722687}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They could be beneficial for physicians to judge the path of patient's recovery, for researchers to compare different management protocols and for politicians in order to find the cost-effectiveness of their decisions.

As an outcome measure specifically designed for [[spinal cord injury]], the '''Spinal Cord Independence Measure''' is a tool that evaluates how much safe, cheap and independent, a patient can do basic [[activities of daily living]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Catz|first=Amiram|date=1997|title=SCIM--spinal cord independence measure:a new disability scale for patients with spinal cord lesions.|url=|journal=Spinal cord|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1038/sj.sc.3100738|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Catz|first=Amiram|date=2007|title=Spinal Cord Independence Measure:comprehensive ability rating scale for the spinal cord lesion patient.|url=|journal=Journal of rehabilitative research|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1682/JRRD.2005.07.0123|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The measure consists of 19 items categorized in three subscales:self care, respiration and sphincter management, and mobility.

==Psychometric property==

'''Sporting Memories Network CIC''' is a [[UK]] registered social enterprise that runs community-wide sports reminiscence projects. These projects (provided by the "Sporting Memories Network CIC") introduce the use of archival sports images, reports, and memorabilia. This is done to engage older people in both stimulating conversation and reminiscence, thus promoting mental and physical well-being. It works in conjunction with a registered charity - The Sporting Memories Foundation that trains and supports volunteers to deliver sports reminiscence in England and Wales

==Start up==
Founded in 2011, Sporting Memories Network Community Interest Company (CIC) ran an initial pilot project with fifteen care homes in [[Leeds]], to test and refine their approach. The project, funded by [[Skills for Care]], was evaluated by Dr. Michael Clark, Research Programme Manager, Personal Social Services Research Unit, [[London School of Economics]]. The project tested the effectiveness of training care staff and sought to engage relatives, [[Volunteering|volunteers]], and more able residents in facilitating group activities. After receiving background training, each home was supplied with archival images and a training manual. They also received a weekly sports reminiscence newspaper called ''The Sporting Pink.'' In his evaluation report, Dr. Clark wrote: "The Sporting Memories work is appealing to people (staff and residents) and draws out enthusiasm and personal information that would otherwise have been dormant".

Enthusiasm for an idea is important if it is to be widely used and effective. Training people in approaches which they do not believe in means that either the intervention will not be used, or will be used unenthusiastically. Consequently it is unlikely to benefit anyone. By tapping into widespread enthusiasm for, and connections with, sports, "Sporting Memories" can be inspirational both to care home staff and to residents. In addition, the training can be readily passed on, and used in a flexible, creative and sustainable manner. The materials can be used many times and adapted to the interests of residents over time. Those who had experienced it, reported that they would continue to use the work in their homes.&lt;ref&gt;Evaluation of the Leeds Care Homes project 2012/13 Dr Michael Clark, PSSRU, London School of Economics&lt;/ref&gt;

The network also works with professional sports clubs by raising awareness of dementia through scheduled league matches which are designated Memories Games. This aspect of the Sporting Memories Network work was acknowledged in the first annual report on the progress of the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister's]] challenge on dementia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Prime Minister's Challenge on Dementia: Delivering major improvements in dementia care and research by 2015: Annual report of progress|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-prime-ministers-challenge-on-dementia-annual-report-of-progress|date=14 May 2013|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their work with Everton Football Club&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.evertonfc.com/employment/pass-on-the-memories/|title=Home - Health &amp; Wellbeing - Pass on the Memories - Everton In The Community|work=evertonfc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published as an example of best practice in the [[Alzheimer's Society]] 2013 report on Creating Dementia-Friendly Communities &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Building dementia-friendly communities: A priority for everyone|date= September 2013|publisher= Alzheimer's Society|url=http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/download_info.php?fileID=1916|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the group activities utilize [[reminiscence therapy]] which is widely recognized as having a beneficial effect on people living with [[dementia]], [[memory problems]] or [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. As identified in a study by Tolson et al. (2012), the use of football as a subject may be more attractive to older men living with dementia than traditional topics covered in reminiscence sessions or group activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tolson  | first1 = Debbie  | last2 =Schofield | first2 = Irene | date = March 2012 | title = Football reminiscence for men with dementia: lessons from a realistic evaluation | journal = Nursing Inquiry | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 63-70 | publisher =  | jstor =  | doi = 10.1111/j.1440-1800.2011.00581.x | url =  | format =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Journal of Dementia Care, North Berwick Day Centre manager Carol Wicker reported: "A lot of men attend our day center and most of the staff and volunteers here are women. We try to find ways of engaging with men but it can be difficult to interact meaningfully and get to know people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|volume= 20|number= 6 |date=November–December 2012|work= The Journal of Dementia Care|title=United through football|url=http://www.careinfo.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/NovDec-JDC-sample-10-11.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sporting Memories Network has developed activities around many different sports, including Football, Cricket, Rugby, Golf, Tennis, and Motorsport.

There are community projects run by the network in England, Wales, and Scotland which are volunteer led. [[Premier League]], [[Football League]], [[Super league]], and [[County cricket|County Cricket Clubs]] are involved in hosting and running some of the groups. Other venues include libraries, museums, social clubs, and pubs.

The network has gained the support of current and former sports stars including: [[David Coulthard]], [[Ross Brawn]] and [[Nico Rosberg]] from [[Formula One]]; and footballers [[Robbie Savage]], [[Chris Kamara]] and [[Nigel Martyn]]. Sporting bodies, such as the [[Professional Footballers' Association]], and the [[British Racing Drivers' Club]], are also supporting the work.

Each supporter has appeared on the network's website and shared their own favourite memories contributing to the 'memory bank' on the company's Replay Websites. In turn, these are used by group facilitators.

On 3 June 2014, the use of sporting memories was featured by [[All in the Mind (BBC radio)|BBC Radio 4 All in the Mind]]. Presented by [[Claudia Hammond]], the programme interviewed gentlemen participating in a weekly sporting memories group in East Lothian. The gentlemen spoke of their experiences in the group, their own health issues, and the impact the group has had on them.[http://www.sportingmemoriesnetwork.com/media-/bbc-radio-4--all-in-the-mind-3rd-june-2014/ Link] It also featured on the lunchtime interview on [[Test Match Special|BBC Test Match Special]], alongside former South African cricketer [[Mike Procter]], during the second day of the first test match England v India on 10 July 2014 - [http://www.sportingmemoriesnetwork.com/media-/test-match-special-lunchtime-interview/ Link]

'''Awards'''

On 20 May 2014, Sporting Memories Network CIC was presented the award for "Best National Dementia Friendly Initiative" by Secretary of State for Health, Jeremy Hunt.

On 7 September 2014, Sporting Memories Network CIC appeared in the list of [http://www.nesta.org.uk/news/new-radicals-2014 Britain's Top 50 New Radicals]. The list was compiled by Nesta and ''The Observer'' newspaper and featured organisations or individuals using innovative approaches to tackle social challenges.

On 6 November 2014, Sporting Memories Network CIC was voted "Best Football Community Scheme" at the [http://www.footballbusinessawards.com/ Football Business Awards]. The shortlist consisted of Football Community Trusts from the following football clubs: Charlton Athletic, Chelsea Football Club, Crystal Palace, Everton, Fulham FC, Liverpool FC, Sunderland AFC, West Bromwich Albion, and Sporting Memories Network CIC

==Memory Games==

Sporting Memories Network has raised awareness of dementia at a number of professional football league, premier league, and super league clubs. [http://www.sportingmemoriesnetwork.com/memories-games/ Memories games] to unite fans who share their own favorite memories of supporting their club. The games engage current and former players and club staff in the build-up to the games. These are usually scheduled league matches. Information about dementia and memory problems is made available to fans through various channels. The first memory game to raise awareness of [[dementia]] took place at Huddersfield Town.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4242">A '''tecoatl''' (plural '''tecoatles''') is a stone [[canal]] making up part of an extensive ancient [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]] network in the [[Tehuacán Valley]] in the state of [[Puebla]] in [[Mexico]]. The word ''tecoatl'' translates to "stone snake" in the [[Aztec]] language [[Classical Nahuatl|Nahuatl]], but the canal system is far older than the Aztecs. The first segments of the system were laid down approximately 2500 years ago. 

Archaeological investigation of the tecoatl system began in the late 1960s, and further studies revealed that the tecoatles make up the longest prehistoric [[irrigation]] system in the [[New World]]. At one point 1200 kilometers of stone canals provided water to 330 km² of cultivated land in the Tehuacán Valley. 

==Development==
The tecoatles started out as simple channels dug in the earth and banked with small [[levee]]s. They were carefully planned, sloping from high ground to low on a tortuous course that sloped less than two degrees at all times. The canal meandered amongst the fields, providing water from uphill [[Spring (hydrosphere)|mineral springs]] to crop fields during Southern Mexico's long dry season, which can last longer than six months. Without irrigation, agriculture is not possible even in the fertile hills and plains of the region.

The Tehuacán Valley is rich with mineral springs, and these water sources were eagerly tapped for farming by early residents of the area. The water in these springs is high in dissolved [[calcium carbonate]] in the form of [[calcite]]. As the water ran through the canals, calcite was slowly but steadily deposited on their walls, forming a hard, stony layer. Through concentration and evaporation calcite crystallized on the earthen surface of the canals, forming a leakproof shell of [[travertine]]. The travertine coating grew in thickness at a rate of about one centimeter per year.

At this rate, the canals began to grow in height. As each canal became shallower due to the travertine accumulation in its bed, water overflowing its levees deposited more travertine along the sides, building up the walls and effectively containing itself. When water did overflow and wash down the sides of the canal, it evaporated and deposited minerals along the base. Eventually, what was once a ditch in the soil became a tall stone aqueduct with a very wide base. The largest were five meters high and 30 meters wide, with water still flowing efficiently through the channel along the top. The farmers probably helped shape the canal, removing travertine buildup as needed, but for the most part each canal became a large winding calcareous aqueduct on its own, and earning it the appellation "stone snake".

==Use==
Nearby aqueducts were built to channel river water as well, but these did not become tecoatles, because the water they bore was much lower in dissolved minerals than the water from the springs. The tecoatles are essentially fossilized structures. As the travertine crystallized on the walls of the tecoatles, it trapped biological material, such as small plants and [[algae]]s, as well as [[pollen]] from the crop plants grown alongside the water system. This material yields information about the composition of the water, the flow rate in the aqueducts, and the wild and cultivated flora of the area. The farmers grew [[maize]], [[tomato]]es, and [[capsicum|peppers]], and probably used wild [[Typha|cattails]] for a variety of purposes. Also, biological material trapped in the stone can be used for [[radiocarbon dating]] of the canals; the first ones were dug as early as 800 BC, and water ran through them as recently as the sixteenth century AD.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4809">A '''third-party administrator'''  ('''TPA''') is an organization that processes [[insurance]] claims or certain aspects of [[employee benefit]] plans for a separate entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/healthcarecrisis/glossary.htm |author=PBS |title=Glossary of Healthcare terms |accessdate=2008-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a term used to define organizations within the insurance industry which administer other services such as underwriting, customer service. This can be viewed as [[outsourcing]] the administration of the claims processing, since the TPA is performing a task traditionally handled by the company providing the insurance or the company itself. Often, in the case of insurance claims, a TPA handles the claims processing for an [[employer]] that self-insures its employees. Thus, the employer is acting as an [[insurance company]] and [[Underwriting#Insurance|underwrites]] the [[Financial risk|risk]].  The risk of loss remains with the employer, and not with the TPA. An insurance company may also use a TPA to manage its claims processing, provider networks, [[utilization review]], or membership functions. While some third-party administrators may operate as units of insurance companies, they are often independent.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Third-party administrators also handle many aspects of other employee benefit plans such as the processing of [[retirement plan]]s and [[flexible spending account]]s. Many employee benefit plans have highly technical aspects and difficult administration that can make using a specialized entity such as a TPA more cost effective than doing the same processing in house.

==Health care{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}==
Third-party administrators are prominent players in the health care industry and have the expertise and capability to administer all or a portion of the claims process. They are normally contracted by a health insurer or self-insuring companies to administer services, including claims administration, premium collection, enrollment and other administrative activities.  A hospital or provider organization desiring to set up its own health plan will often outsource certain responsibilities to a third-party administrator.

For example, an employer may choose to help finance the health care costs of its employees by contracting with a TPA to administer many aspects of a [[self-funded health care]] plan.

==Commercial general liability{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}==
This term is also now commonly used in [[commercial general liability]] (CGL) policies or so called "casualty" business. In these instances, the liability policies are written with a large (in excess of $50,000) [[self-insured retention]] (SIR) that operates somewhat like a deductible, but rather than being paid at the end of a claim (when a loss payment is made to a claimant), the money is paid up front by the insured for costs, expenses, attorney fees etc. as the claim moves forward. If there is a settlement or verdict within the SIR, then that is also paid by the insured up to the limit of the SIR, before the insurer steps in and pays its portion. The TPA acts like a claims adjuster for the insurance company and sometimes works in conjunction with the inside insurance company claims adjuster or an outside claims investigator as well as the defense counsel. The defense counsel in some situations is selected by the TPA. The point is that the larger the SIR, the more responsibility the TPA has over the control of the way the claim is handled and ultimately resolved. Some self-insured retentions are in the millions of dollars and the TPAs are large multinational non-insurance entities that handle all the claims. In contrast, some self-insureds choose not to outsource claims handling to a TPA, preferring instead to handle all claims in house. This is known as self-administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irmi.com/expert/articles/2008/armc11-insurance-claims-management.aspx|title=Is Self-Administration Ever the Right Answer?|work=irmi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement plans==
Retirement plans such as a [[401(k)]] are often partly managed by an investment company. Instead of handling all the plan contributions by employees, distributions to employees, and other aspects of plan processing, the investment company may contract with a third-party administrator to handle much of the administrative work and only handle the remaining investment work.

'''tranSMART''' is an [[open-source software|open-source]] [[data warehouse]] designed to store large amounts of [[Case report form|clinical data]] from clinical trials, as well as data from basic research, so that it can be interrogated together for [[translational research]]. It is also designed to be used by many people, across organizations. It was developed by [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]], in partnership with Recombinant Data Corporation. The platform was released in Jan 2012 and has been governed by the tranSMART Foundation since its initiation in 2013.

The tranSMART platform has been adopted and evaluated by numerous pharmaceutical companies, not-for-profits and patient advocacy groups, academics, governmental organisations and service providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rance B, Canuel V, Countouris H, Laurent-Puig P, Burgun A | title = Integrating Heterogeneous Biomedical Data for Cancer Research: the CARPEM infrastructure | journal = Applied Clinical Informatics | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 260–74 | date = 2016-05-04 | pmid = 27437039 | pmc = 4941838 | doi = 10.4338/ACI-2015-09-RA-0125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Christoph J, Knell C, Naschberger E, Stürzl M, Maier C, Prokosch HU, Sedlmayr M | title = Two Years of tranSMART in a University Hospital for Translational Research and Education | journal = Studies in Health Technology and Informatics | volume = 236 | pages = 70–79 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28508781 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Bio-IT World industry conference both the [[Innovative Medicines Initiative]]'s U-BIOPRED project and [[The Michael J.

In [[obstetrics]] a '''trial of labour''' is the conduction of spontaneous labour in a moderate degree of [[cephalopelvic disproportion]]. It is performed under close observation by an [[obstetrician]] in order to assess a woman's chances of a successful vaginal birth. The physician may allow labor to continue against contraindications during birth or even stimulate labor with [[oxytocin]] when pelvic measurements are borderline to see if the fetal head will descend making vaginal delivery possible; if progressive changes in dilation and station do not occur, a cesarean delivery is performed.

'''Tubal factor infertility''' ('''TFI''') is [[female infertility]] caused by diseases, obstructions, damage, scarring, congenital malformations or other factors which impede the descent of a fertilized or unfertilized ovum into the uterus through the Fallopian tubes and prevents a normal pregnancy and full term birth.  Tubal factors cause 25-30% of infertility cases.&lt;ref name="Bardawil"&gt;{{cite web| title = Fallopian Tube Disorders| last= Bardawil, MD |first= Tarek |editor1-last= Lucidi, MD |editor1-first =Richard Scott |website= |publisher=Medscape| url = http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/275463-overview#aw2aab6b7 | accessdate = 2015-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tubal factor is one complication of Chlamydia trachomatis infection in women.&lt;ref name=Sternak&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ljubin-Sternak|first1=Suncanica|last2=Mestrovic|first2=Tomislav|title=Review: Clamydia trachonmatis and Genital Mycoplasmias: Pathogens with an Impact on Human Reproductive Health|journal=Journal of Pathogens|page= |date=2014|volume=2014|issue=183167|pages=183167|doi=10.1155/2014/183167|pmid=25614838|pmc=4295611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexually transmitted Chlamydia and genital mycoplasma infections are preventable causes of infertility and negative pregnancy outcomes. When the infections progress and ascend, they can result in TFI. Infertility can have multiple possible causes and may not be recognized for years after a gonorrhea, Chlamydia or ''Mycoplasma'' infection has caused tubal damage, as the affected woman may not have attempted to become pregnant until years later.&lt;ref name=Sternak/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Infertility]] is the major symptom of TFI and is generally defined as a woman under 35 who has not become [[pregnant]] after 12 months without the use of [[contraception]]. Twelve months is the lower [[reference limit]] for ''Time to Pregnancy'' (TTP) by the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cooper TG, Noonan E, von Eckardstein S, Auger J, Baker HW, Behre HM, Haugen TB, Kruger T, Wang C, Mbizvo MT, Vogelsong KM | title = World Health Organization reference values for human semen characteristics | journal = Hum.

A history of pelvic inflammatory disease, the [[laproscopic]] evidence of scarring and a diagnosis of [[salpingitis]] supports the [[diagnosis]].

==Cause==
Tubal factor infertility can be due to [[Chlamydia infection]] and testing for [[Chlamydia antibodies]] is one diagnostic tool.&lt;ref name="coog"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kodaman PH, Arici A, Seli E | title=Evidence-based diagnosis and management of tubal factor infertility. |journal=Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology |pmid=15129051|volume=16|issue=3|date=June 2004|pages=221–9|doi=10.1097/00001703-200406000-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' infection has also been linked to TFI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/944920918|title=Williams gynecology|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Schorge, John O.,, Hoffman, Barbara L.,, Bradshaw, Karen D.,, Halvorson, Lisa M.,, Schaffer, Joseph I.,, Corton, Marlene M.,|year=|isbn=9780071849081|edition= Third|location=New York|pages=65|oclc=944920918}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women have difficulty getting pregnant or carrying a baby to term due to the buildup of [[scar|scar tissue]] in the Fallopian tubes causing damage to the cilia on the epithelial cells.&lt;ref name="Tay"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tay JI, Moore J, Walker JJ | title = Ectopic pregnancy | journal = West.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
The physician will obtain a medical history and evaluate for tubal obstructions and infections. Obstruction can occur anywhere along the length of the tube.  It can be partially or completely blocked. The extent of obstruction is typically assessed using hysterosalpingogram (HSG). Some use laparoscopy to establish the extent of the disease. Pelvic adhesions can be visualized, if present.&lt;ref name=coog/&gt;

Distal tubal obstruction is more often observed (70%) than proximal obstruction. It can be caused by hydrosalpinges, pelvic adhesions, or fusion of the fimbriae. Tubal obstruction is caused by infection, endometriosis, myomas, salpingitis isthmica nodosa (SIN), or dried mucus. Because the tube can spasm during the injection of the dye during a hysterosalpingogram, it can be misdiagnosed.&lt;ref name=coog/&gt;

== Treatment ==
If tubal factor infertility is suspected to be the cause of the infertility treatment begins with or without confirmation of infection because of complications that may result from delayed treatment. Appropriate treatment depends on the [[infectious agent]] and utilizes [[antibiotic]] therapy.  Treating the sexual partner for possible STIs helps in treatment and prevents reinfection.&lt;ref name=CDC2014Pub&gt;{{cite web|title=Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) Partner Management and Public Health Measures|url=http://www2a.cdc.gov/stdtraining/self-study/pid/pid_partner_management_self_study_from_cdc.html|website=cdc.gov|accessdate=21 February 2015|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Antibiotic administration affects the short or long-term major outcome of women with mild or moderate disease.&lt;ref name="pmid17342664"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Walker CK, Wiesenfeld HC |title=Antibiotic therapy for acute pelvic inflammatory disease: the 2006 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines |journal=Clin.

For women with infections of mild to moderate severity, parenteral and oral therapies are prescribed .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ness RB, Soper DE, Holley RL | year = 2002 | title = Effectiveness of inpatient and outpatient treatment strategies for women with pelvic inflammatory disease: results from the Pelvic Inflammatory Disease Evaluation and Clinical Health (PEACH) Randomized Trial | url = | journal = Am J Obstet Gynecol | volume = 186 | issue = 5| pages = 929–37 | doi=10.1067/mob.2002.121625| pmid = 12015517 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ness RB, Hillier SL, Kip KE et al.

'''Wat''', '''we̠t’''', '''wot''' ({{lang-am|ወጥ}}, {{IPA-am|wətʼ|IPA}}) or '''tsebhi''' ({{lang-ti|ጸብሒ}}, {{IPA-ti|sʼɐbħi|IPA}}) is an [[Cuisine of Ethiopia|Ethiopian]] and [[Cuisine of Eritrea|Eritrean]] [[stew]] or [[curry]] that may be prepared with [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], [[beef]], [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], a variety of [[vegetable]]s, spice mixtures such as ''[[berbere]]'', and ''[[niter kibbeh]]'', a seasoned [[clarified butter]].

==Overview==
[[File:Ethiopian_food.jpg|thumb|left|Typical serving of wat]]
Several properties distinguish wats from stews of other cultures. Perhaps the most obvious is an unusual cooking technique: the preparation of a wat begins with chopped onions slow cooked, without any fat or oil, in a dry skillet or pot until much of their moisture has been driven away. Fat (usually ''niter kibbeh'') is then added, often in quantities that might seem excessive by modern Western standards, and the onions and other aromatics are [[Sautéing|sautéed]] before the addition of other ingredients. This method causes the onions to break down and thicken the stew.

Wat is traditionally eaten with [[injera]], a spongy [[flat bread]] made from the [[millet]]-like grain known as [[teff]].   There are many types of wats. The popular ones are doro wat and siga wat, (Ge'ez: ሥጋ ''śigā'') made with beef.

=== Doro  wat ===

Doro wat is one such stew, made from chicken and sometimes [[Boiled egg#Hard-boiled eggs|hard-boiled egg]]s; the ethnologist Donald Levine records that doro wat ({{lang-am|ዶሮ ወጥ}} ''dōrō we̠t’'', {{lang-ti|ደርሆ ጸብሒ}} ''derhō tsebhi'') is the most popular traditional food in Ethiopia, often eaten as part of a group who share a communal bowl and basket of injera.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Donald N. ''Wax and Gold: Tradition and Innovation in Ethiopian Culture'' (Chicago: University Press, 1972), p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the national stage he concerned himself with health and [[Africa]] and the fight against [[AIDS]].

==Early life==
[[File:Kilimanjaro Moshi.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Moshi, Kilimanjaro|Moshi]], Tanzania, with [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] in the background]]
Schuster was born in 1939 at [[Moshi, Kilimanjaro|Moshi]] in the [[Kilimanjaro Region]] of the [[Tanganyika Territory]], now part of [[Tanzania]], into a family of German [[settler colonialism|settlers]]. He spent much of his childhood there before migrating to Germany with his parents, and all his life was able to speak [[Swahili language|Swahili]].&lt;ref name=spiegel&gt;Obituary in ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', issues 18-22 (Spiegel-Verlag, 2001), p. 270: "Werner Schuster, 62. Nach einer Ruanda-Reise 1993 drängte der SPD-Abgeordnete die damalige Bundesregierung: Sie solle die Entsendung von 4000 Blauhelm-Soldaten in das afrikanische Land finanziell unterstützen - vergebens, der verstärkte Uno-Einsatz kam nicht zu Stande; im folgenden Jahr starben 800000 Menschen beim Genozid in Ruanda. ... Der Arzt aus dem hessischen Idstein sprach Kisuaheli. Nach seiner Wahl in den Bundestag 1990 kümmerte er sich in der SPD-Fraktion um Afrika und den Kampf gegen Aids. Er forderte, dass die reichen Länder zehn Prozent ihres Bruttosozialprodukts zur Bekämpfung der Armut in der Dritten Welt verwenden. Werner Schuster starb am 9. Mai in Idstein an Leberkrebs."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958 he gained his ''[[Abitur]]'' at the [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in [[Rosenheim]], [[Upper Bavaria]], and from 1959 to 1960 did his [[national service|compulsory military service]] in the Mountain Infantry of the [[Bundeswehr]]. He then proceeded to [[University of Tübingen|Tübingen]] to study [[medicine]]. In 1966 he took the ''[[Staatsexamen]]'', and the same year received his doctorate from the Physiological Institute in Tübingen.&lt;ref name=bundestag&gt;[http://webarchiv.bundestag.de/archive/2007/0206/mdb/mdb14/bio/S/schuswe0.html Dr. R. Werner Schuster] at webarchiv.bundestag.de, accessed 23 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical and health informatics career==
In 1970 Schuster gained his ''Approbation'', or license to practice, at St Joseph's Hospital in [[Bremerhaven]] on the coast of the [[North Sea]].  From 1970 to 1983 he was head of the health department in the Hesse Centre for Data Processing at [[Wiesbaden]]. In 1971 he joined the Medical Emergency Service agency in Wiesbaden. In 1983 he received the [[Health informatics|medical]] [[computer science]] certificate of the ''Gesellschaft für medizinische Informatik und Statistik'' (Society for Medical Informatics and Statistics). From 1984, he worked in the municipal data processing centre at [[Giessen]].&lt;ref name=bundestag/&gt;

==Political career==
In 1964, Schuster had joined the SPD. From 1972 to 1989 he was a city councillor at [[Idstein]] in the [[Taunus|Taunus mountains]] and from 1975 to 1985 was leader of his political group. From 1985 to 1995 he was chairman of the SPD's [[Rheingau-Taunus-Kreis]] branch.&lt;ref name=bundestag/&gt;

In 1985 he founded the ''Bürgerpartnerschaft Dritte Welt Idstein e.V.''&lt;ref&gt;"''eingetragener Verein''", or "registered Association"&lt;/ref&gt; (Third World Civic Partnership Association Idstein) and
later established a civic partnership between Idstein and his native [[Moshi, Kilimanjaro|Moshi]].&lt;ref name=temba/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Der Spiegel'', vol. 43, Issues 40-44 (1989) p. 87: "So bewegten die Mitglieder eines Vereins „Bürgerpartnerschaft Dritte Welt" im südhessischen Idstein ihre Stadt zum Bund mit Moshi in Tansania..."&lt;/ref&gt; This association, later renamed ''Bürgerpartnerschaft Eine Welt e.V., Idstein / People Help People - One World'', had the aim of achieving concrete [[Development aid|development projects]] in Tanzania, focussing on the area of Moshi, at the foot of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]].&lt;ref name=temba/&gt; In Moshi itself, Schuster initiated the founding of a [[non-governmental organization]] called "Friends in Development Association". This sought to link its efforts into those of regional and national German NGOs.&lt;ref name=temba&gt;Peter Temba: [http://www.dailynews.co.tz/home/?n=16655&amp;cat=home Kilimanjaro social projects get financial boost], [[Daily News (Tanzania)|Daily News]] 24 January 2011, accessed 24 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 Schuster was elected to his local ''[[Kreistag]]'', and at the [[German federal election, 1990|federal election of 1990]] he was sent to the [[Bundestag]], representing [[Rheingau-Taunus-Kreis|Rheingau-Taunus]]/[[Limburg-Weilburg]]. As a member of parliament Schuster was chiefly concerned with development and with [[health policy]] and took a particular interest in [[Africa]] and the fight against [[AIDS]]. He called for ten per cent of the gross national product of rich countries to be spent on combatting poverty in the [[Third World]].&lt;ref name=spiegel/&gt;&lt;ref name=bundestag/&gt;

In a debate in the ''Bundestag'' on 21 June 1991 on the situation in the [[Sudan]], Schuster said that the bombing of [[United Nations]] and [[Red Cross]] supply depots by government forces in the south of the country was "completely perverse", and his position was supported on all sides of the chamber.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Marie Henckaerts &amp; Louise Doswald-Beck, eds., ''Customary international humanitarian law: volume 2, Practice'' (Cambridge University Press, 2005), Part 1, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DJTxx-9ayFcC&amp;pg=PA632#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 632]&lt;/ref&gt; After a trip to [[Rwanda]] in 1993, Schuster unsuccessfully called upon the German federal government led by [[Helmut Kohl]] to offer financial support for an enlarged United Nations [[United Nations peacekeeping|peace-keeping force]] there. The next year, some eight hundred thousand people died in the [[Rwandan Genocide|Rwandan genocide]].&lt;ref name=spiegel/&gt; In matters of development policy Schuster was respected across party boundaries. He was closely associated with [[Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul]], who in 1998 became [[Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development|federal minister for economic cooperation and development]] under [[Gerhard Schröder]], the new SPD Chancellor.&lt;ref name=germanwatch&gt;[http://www.germanwatch.org/pubpress/p030509a.htm Einweihung "Dr.Werner-Schuster-Haus" Ehrung für einen herausragenden Entwicklungspolitiker], press release dated 9 May 2003 at germanwatch.org, accessed 24 February 2012 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1995, following the [[1995 NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina|NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia]], Schuster was one of only fifty-five SPD members of parliament who voted against sending four thousand German soldiers to join the [[Implementation Force (IFOR)|IFOR]] international peacekeeping force in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], with the ''Bundestag'' approving the deployment by 543 votes to 107, with six abstentions and sixteen members absent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/buendnis-90-die-gruenen-von-krise-zu-krise_aid_155454.html Von Krise zu Krise] in FOCUS Magazin Nr. 50 (1995) dated 11.12.1995 online at focus.de, accessed 23 February 2012 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

He was married with three children.&lt;ref name=bundestag/&gt; He died in Idstein on 9 May 2001, suffering from [[cancer]] of the [[liver]].&lt;ref name=spiegel/&gt;

In May 2003, on the initiative of the [[Bonn]] City Council, and in the presence of Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul and members of the Schuster family, a building at 201, Kaiserstrasse, was renamed the ''Dr. Werner Schuster Haus''. It contains the offices of several NGOs with development objectives.&lt;ref name=germanwatch/&gt; Reinhard Hermle, chairman of [[VENRO]] (the Association of German Development NGOs) stated {{quote|On the eve of the second anniversary of the death of Werner Schuster, an outstanding figure in German development policy, we wish to honour him by the inauguration of the Dr Werner Schuster House. Anyone who had anything to do with him can tell of his constant and powerful commitment to greater justice in the world. His openness and his clarity were highly esteemed, and sometimes feared. His constituency did not end in the Taunus and the Rheingau. He wanted to bring the concerns and the needs of the poor, above all in Africa, into German politics. In that, he was a role model.&lt;ref name=germanwatch/&gt;}}
