Her last published book is ''Did Moses Exist? The Myth of the Israelite Lawgiver''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QG234o3LHA&lt;/ref&gt;

She wrote and operated a website focused on history, religion and spirituality, and [[astro-theology]]. She asserted that the pre-Christian religious civilizations understood their mythologies as allegorical, but Christians obliterated evidence to the contrary by destroying and controlling literature when they attained control of the [[Roman Empire]], which led to widespread [[illiteracy]] in the ancient world, ensuring that the mythical nature of Christ's story was hidden. She argued that the [[Christianity|Christian]] canon, as well as its important figures, were based on Roman, Greek, Egyptian, and other cultures' [[myth]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.truthbeknown.com/christ.htm |title=The Christ Conspiracy&amp;nbsp;– Home |accessdate=September 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her theories have been variously received by mainstream scholars, for instance [[Robert M. Price]] criticized her first book while praising later ones.

She also wrote against the [[ancient astronauts]] theories, asserting that they "may be prompted by the same type of motivation that produced the Bible, a chronicle largely consisting of the plagiarized myths of other cultures" refashioned as historical facts concerning purported historical characters, and may be driven by the attempt to validate Biblical mythology as historical under a new pseudo-scientific interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Murdock|first=Dorothy Milne|title=Who are the Anunnaki?|date=6 January 2014|website=Truth Be Known|url=http://www.truthbeknown.com/anunnaki.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Murdock was born to James Milne Murdock and Beatrice Murdock in [[Massachusetts]] and grew up in [[Avon, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="CourantObit" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://new.exchristian.net/2016/01/tribute-to-mythicist-dm-murdock-1961.html ExChristian.net&amp;nbsp;– Tribute to Mythicist D.M. Murdock, 1961–2015]&lt;/ref&gt; She received a [[Bachelor of Liberal Arts]] degree in [[Classics]], Greek Civilization, from [[Franklin and Marshall College]], after which she spent a year at the [[American School of Classical Studies at Athens]], Greece.&lt;ref name="CourantObit" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.truthbeknown.com/credentials.html |title=What Are Acharya's Credentials? |author=Acharya S |accessdate=July 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She died of breast cancer that spread into her immune system and liver on December 25, 2015. Murdock had one son, Jason, and she was known as "Dori" to loved ones.&lt;ref name="CourantObit" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barker |first1=N.W. |title=December 27th update |url=https://www.giveforward.com/fundraiser/lsn9/u/updates/138747 |publisher=GiveForward |accessdate=December 31, 2015 |date=December 27, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107075320/https://www.giveforward.com/fundraiser/lsn9/u/updates/138747 |archivedate=January 7, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barker|first1=N.W.|title=Acharya S/D.M.

==Writing career==
Murdock began her website, ''Truth Be Known'', in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.truthbeknown.com/ |title=Welcome to the world of Acharya S/D.M. Murdock! |website=Truth Be Known |accessdate=December 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, as Acharya S, she published her first book, ''The Christ Conspiracy: The Greatest Story Ever Sold'', arguing the concept of [[Jesus]] [[Christ (title)|Christ]] and his story is a fabrication.&lt;ref name="cover"&gt;Adventure Unlimited Press, rear cover of Murdock (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Her 2007 book, ''Who Was Jesus? Fingerprints of The Christ'' continues the theme of ''The Christ Conspiracy'' by expanding her theory questioning the [[historicity of Jesus]], alleging "early Christian history to be largely mythical, by sorting through available historical and archaeological data."

In 2009 she released ''Christ in Egypt: The Horus-Jesus Connection'' and ''The Gospel According to Acharya S''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Gospel According to Acharya S |url=http://stellarhousepublishing.com/gospel.html |publisher=Stellar House Publishing |accessdate=July 9, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716134319/http://stellarhousepublishing.com/gospel.html |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Writer [[Russ Kick]], in his book ''You Are Being Lied To'', describes ''The Christ Conspiracy'' as "an essential book for anyone who wants to know the reality behind the world's dominant religion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Russ |last=Kick |authorlink=Russ Kick |title=You Are Being Lied To: The Disinformation Guide to Media Distortion, Historical Whitewashes and Cultural Myths |location=New York |publisher=[[Disinfo|The Disinformation Company]] |year=2001 |isbn=0-9664100-7-6 |page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conspiracy theorist and publisher [[Kenn Thomas]] calls her a "great chronicler of the conspiracy known as Christianity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Kenn |last=Thomas |authorlink=Kenn Thomas |title=Parapolitics: Conspiracy in Contemporary America |publisher=[[Adventures Unlimited Press]] |year=2006 |isbn=1-931882-55-X |pages=15, 127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Baptist comparative religion scholar [[Clinton Bennett]] compares her views to those of radical freethinker [[Robert Taylor (Radical)|Robert Taylor]] (nicknamed "the Devil's chaplain"), secularist MP and Christ-mythicist [[John M. Robertson]], and American mythographer [[Joseph Campbell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Clinton |last=Bennett |authorlink=Clinton Bennett |title=In Search of Jesus: Insider and Outsider Images |location=London |publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]] |year=2001 |isbn=0-8264-4916-6 |page=339}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Butler University]] religion professor [[James F. McGrath]] describes her viewpoint as one that "once had some currency among scholars" in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but was subsequently abandoned.&lt;ref name="mcgrath"&gt;{{cite news |first=James F. |last=McGrath |title=Fringe View: The World of Jesus Mythicism |work=[[The Christian Century]] |date=November 15, 2011 |volume=128 |issue=123 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atheist activist and Christ mythicist [[Richard Carrier]] criticized her use of the inscriptions at Luxor to make the claim that the story of Jesus' birth was inspired by the Luxor story of the birth of [[Horus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frontline-apologetics.com/Luxor_Inscription.html |title=Brunner's Gottkoenigs &amp; the Nativity of Jesus: A Brief Communication |first=Richard C. |last=Carrier |authorlink=Richard Carrier |year=2004 |publisher=Frontline Apologetics |accessdate=December 30, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123093556/http://www.frontline-apologetics.com/Luxor_Inscription.html |archivedate=January 23, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Theologian and Christ-mythicist [[Robert M. Price]] also criticized Murdock's first book,&lt;ref name="Price 66–67"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Price |first=Robert M. |authorlink=Robert M. Price |title=Aquarian Skeptic |journal=[[Free Inquiry]] |date=Summer 2001 |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=66–67 |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-10515613_ITM}}&lt;/ref&gt; while promoting her ''Suns of God: Krishna, Buddha and Christ Unveiled'' in ''The Pre-Nicene New Testament: Fifty-Four Formative Texts'',&lt;ref&gt;p. 1179&lt;/ref&gt; and writing the foreword to her ''Who Was Jesus?: Fingerprints of the Christ''.&lt;ref name="priceforeword" /&gt;

Her work has also been criticized by New Testament scholar [[Bart D. Ehrman]], who, in his  ''[[Did Jesus Exist? (Ehrman)|Did Jesus Exist?: The Historical Argument for Jesus of Nazareth]]'' calls Murdock's ''The Christ Conspiracy'' "the breathless conspirator's dream". He says "all of Acharya's major points are in fact wrong" and her book "is filled with so many factual errors and outlandish assertions that it is hard to believe the author is serious". Taking her as representative of some other writers about the Christ myth theory, he continues "Mythicists of this ilk should not be surprised that their views are not taken seriously by real scholars, mentioned by experts in the field, or even read by them".&lt;ref name="Ehrman"&gt;{{cite book |title=Did Jesus Exist?: The Historical Argument for Jesus of Nazareth |first=Bart D. |last=Ehrman |authorlink=Bart D. Ehrman |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-06-208994-6 |oclc=808490374 |pages=20–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emeritus Professor of New Testament Languages and Literature at the [[University of Nottingham]] [[Maurice Casey]] criticized her work for "her anti-Christian outlook, a lack of any proper sense of reality, failure to give adequate references, inability to interpret primary sources correctly, and dependence on inaccurate out-of-date secondary sources rather than primary evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Casey|first1=Maurice|title=Jesus: Evidence and Argument or Mythicist Myths?|date=2014|publisher=T&amp;T Clark|isbn=978-0567447623|pages=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Childhood===
She was born ''Aleksandra Aleksandrovna Grigorovich'' in [[Białystok]], in the [[Grodno Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Poland]]) to a wealthy [[Belarusians|Belarusian]] family. Her father, Aleksandr Grigorovich, was a wealthy Belarusian businessman. Her mother was Greek. Young Aleksandra received an excellent private education, studying languages, music, art, and taking private drawing lessons. Soon her parents moved to Kyiv (Kiev), and Asya, as called by her friends, attended Kiev gymnasium St. Olga and Kiev Art School, where she studied with [[Alexander Bogomazov]] and [[Alexander Archipenko]]. Her teachers included [[Mykola Pymonenko]]. Aleksandra graduated in painting from Kiev Art School in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/alexandra-alexandrovna-exter/|title=Alexandra Alexandrovna Exter |first=Encyclopædia|last=Universalis|website=[[Encyclopædia Universalis]]|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage===
In 1908, Aleksandra Grigorovich married a successful [[Kiev]] lawyer, Nikolai Evgenyevich Ekster. The Eksters belonged to cultural and intellectual elite of Kiev. She spent several months with her husband in [[Paris]], and there she attended [[Académie de la Grande Chaumière]] in [[Montparnasse]]. From 1908 to 1924 she intermittently lived in Kiev, [[St. Petersburg]], [[Odessa]], Paris, [[Rome]] and [[Moscow]].&lt;ref name="MoMA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=1784|title=Alexandra Exter|author=Christina Lodder|accessdate=September 16, 2012|work=MoMA, Grove Art Online|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her painting studio in the attic at 27 Funduklievskaya Street, now Khmelnytsky Street, was a rallying stage for Kiev's intellectual elite.In the attic in her studio there worked future luminaries of world decorative art Vadim Meller, Anatole Petrytsky and P.Tchelitchew . There she was visited by poets and writers, such as [[Anna Akhmatova]], [[Ilia Ehrenburg]], and [[Osip Mandelstam]], dancers [[Bronislava Nijinska]] and [[Elsa Kruger]], as well as many artists [[Alexander Bogomazov]], [[Wladimir Baranoff-Rossine]], and students, such as [[Grigori Kozintsev]], [[Sergei Yutkevich]], and [[Aleksei Kapler]] among many others. In 1908 she participated in an exhibition together with members of the group ''[[Zveno (art)|Zveno (Link)]]'' organized by [[David Burliuk]], [[Wladimir Burliuk]] and others in Kiev.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://monoskop.org/images/b/b7/Exter_Goncharova_Popova_Rozanova_Stepanova_Udaltsova_Amazons_of_the_Avant-Garde_low_res.pdf|title=Amazons of the avant-garde|last=John E.

In Paris, Aleksandra Ekster was a personal friend of [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]], who introduced her to [[Gertrude Stein]].

She exhibited six works at the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]], Galerie La Boétie, Paris, October 1912, with [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/viewer/exhibit-catalog-salon-de-la-section-dor-15197|title=Exhibit catalog for Salon de "La Section d'Or", 1912, p. 16, nos. 180-185. Walter Pach papers, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, Ekster participated in the ''[[Salon des Indépendants]]'' exhibitions in Paris, together with [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Vadym Meller]], [[Sonia Delaunay-Terk]] and other French and Russian artists. In that same year she participated with the “Russians” Archipenko, Koulbine and [[Olga Rozanova|Rozanova]] in the ''International Futurist Exhibition'' in Rome. In 1915 she joined the group of avant-garde artists ''[[Supremus]]''. Her friend introduced her to the poet [[Apollinaire]], who took her to Picasso's workshop. According to Moscow Chamber Theatre actress [[Alisa Koonen|Alice Coonen]], "In [Ekster's] Parisian household there was a conspicuous peculiar combination of European culture with Ukrainian life. On the walls between Picasso and Braque paintings there was Ukrainian embroidery; on the floor was a Ukrainian carpet, at the table they served clay pots, colorful majolica plates of dumplings."

===Russian avant-garde===

Under the avant-guard umbrella, Ekster has been noted to be a suprematist and constructivist painter as well as a major influencer of the Art Deco movement.&lt;ref name="Kovalenko"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kovalenko |first=G.F |date=Autumn 2000 {{ndash}} Winter 2001 |title=Aleksandra Ekster: The Artist's Path and Times |journal=Woman's Art Journal |volume= 21 |issue=2 |page=64 |doi=10.2307/1358761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While not confined within a particular movement, Ekster was one of the most experimental women of the [[avant-garde]].&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt; Ekster absorbed from many sources and cultures in order to develop her own original style. In 1915–1916 she worked in the peasant craft cooperatives in the villages [[Skoptsi (village)|Skoptsi]] and [[Verbovka]] along with [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Yevgenia Pribylskaya]], [[Natalia Davidova]], [[Nina Genke-Meller|Nina Genke]], [[Liubov Popova]], [[Ivan Puni]], [[Olga Rozanova]], [[Nadezhda Udaltsova]] and others. Ekster later founded a teaching and production workshop (MDI) in Kiev (1918–1920). [[Vadym Meller]], [[Anatol Petrytsky]], [[Kliment Red'ko]], [[Pavel Tchelitchew|Tchelitchew]], Shifrin, [[Solomon Nikritin|Nikritin]] worked there. Also during this period she was one of the leading stage designers of [[Alexander Tairov]]'s [[Kamerny Theatre|Chamber Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/d/design-for-a-constructivist-stage-setting/|title=Design for a Constructivist stage setting|publisher=Victoria &amp; Albert Museum|accessdate=September 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919 together with other [[Russian avant-garde|avant-garde]] artists [[Kliment Red'ko]] and [[Nina Genke-Meller]] she decorated the streets and squares of Kiev and Odessa in [[abstract art|abstract]] style for Revolution Festivities. She worked with [[Vadym Meller]] as a [[costume designer]] in a ballet studio of the dancer [[Bronislava Nijinska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/gao/9781884446054.article.T027185?rskey=eilTeG&amp;result=5|title=Grove Art Online|first=Christina|last=Lodder|publisher=|doi=10.1093/gao/9781884446054.article.t027185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921 she became a director of the elementary course ''Color'' at the Higher Artistic-Technical Workshop ([[VKhUTEMAS]]) in Moscow, a position she held until 1924. Her work was displayed alongside that of other [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist artists]] at the ''[[5x5=25]]'' exhibition held in Moscow in 1921.

In line with her eclectic avant-guard-like style, Ekster’s early paintings strongly influenced her costume design as well as her book illustrations, which are scarcely noted. All of Ekster’s works, no matter the medium, stick to her distinct style. Her works are vibrant, playful, dramatic, and theatrical in composition, subject matter, and color. Ekster constantly stayed true to her composition aesthetic across all mediums. Furthermore, each medium only enhanced and influenced her work in other mediums.&lt;ref name="Kovalenko" /&gt;

[[File:Alexandra Exter - sketch (Lobanov-Rostovsky coll.) 01.jpg|thumb|Alexandra Exter, sketch, Lobanov-Rostovsky coll.]]
With her assimilation of many different genres her essential futurist and cubist ideas was always in tandem with her attention to colour and rhythm. Ekster uses many elements of geometric compositions, which reinforce the core intentions of dynamism, vibrant contrasts, and free brushwork. Ekster stretched the dynamic intentions of her work across all mediums. Ekster’s theatrical works such as sculptures, costume design, set design, and decorations for the revolutionary festivals, strongly reflect her work with geometric elements and vibrant intentions. Through her costume work she experimented with the transparency, movement, and vibrancy of fabrics. Ekster’s movement of her brushstroke in her artwork is reflected in the movement of the fabric in her costumes. Ekster’s theatrical sets used multi-coloured dimensions and experimented with spatial structures. She continued with these experimental tendencies in her later puppet designs. With her experimentation across many mediums Ekster started to take the concept of her costume designing and integrate it into everyday life. In 1921 Ekster’s work in fashion design began. Though her mass production designs were wearable, most of her fashion design was highly decorative and innovative, usually falling under the category of haute couture.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;

In 1923, she continued her work in many media in addition to collaborating with [[Vera Mukhina]] and Boris Gladkov in Moscow on the decor of the All Russian Exhibition pavilions.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;

===Emigration===
In 1924 Aleksandra Ekster and her husband emigrated to France and settled in Paris, where she initially became a professor at the ''Academie Moderne''. From 1926 to 1930 Ekster was a professor at [[Fernand Léger]]'s Académie d'Art Contemporain. In 1933 she began creating beautiful and original illuminated manuscripts (gouache on paper), perhaps the most important works of the last phase of her life. The "Callimaque" manuscript (c. 1939, the text being a French translation of a hymn by Hellenistic poet [[Callimachus]]) is widely regarded as her masterpiece. In 1936 she participated in the exhibition ''Cubism and Abstract Art'' in [[New York City|New York]] and went on to have solo exhibitions in [[Prague]] and in Paris. She was a book illustrator for the publishing company ''[[Groupe Flammarion|Flammarion]]'' in Paris from 1936 until her death in the Paris suburb of [[Fontenay-aux-Roses]]. During the past few decades her reputation has increased dramatically, as have the prices of her works. As a consequence, several fakes have appeared on the market in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=Alexandra Exter Association|title=Press Release|date=July 2, 2006|accessdate=September 16, 2012|url=http://www.andrei-nakov.org/en/pdf/Exter-Press-release.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fake"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Faking of the Russian Avant-Garde|publisher=ARTnews|date=July 1, 2009|accessdate=September 16, 2012|url=http://www.artnews.com/2009/07/01/the-faking-of-the-russian-avant-garde/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sintistein parkfriedhof marzahn 2003.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Memorial stone on the nearby cemetery, commemorating the camp.]]
'''Berlin-Marzahn Rastplatz''' was a camp set up for [[Romani people]] in the [[Berlin]] [[suburb]] of [[Marzahn]] by [[Nazi]] authorities.

The Nazis used the [[Nuremberg Laws]] related to social misfits, vagabonds, and criminals as a means to intimidate and arrest Romani and Sinti Gypsies in Germany.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; At 4 a.m. on 16 July 1936, prior to the opening of the [[1936 Berlin Olympics]], police arrested 600 Gypsies&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hdl.handle.net/2027/pur1.32754066664065?urlappend=%3Bseq=1|title=Sinti &amp; Roma : victims of the Nazi era, 1933-19 [i.e. 1945].|website=HathiTrust|access-date=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Greater Berlin]] and forcibly relocated them via 130 caravans&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; to Marzahn, an open field in eastern Berlin sandwiched between a cemetery and a sewage dump.&lt;ref name="ushmm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005482|title=Persecution of Roma (Gypsies) in Prewar Germany, 1933-1939|date=2008-05-20|publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|accessdate=2008-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="friedlaender"&gt;{{cite book|last= Friedlaender|first=Saul|title=Nazi Germany and the Jews|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|year=1997|volume=I: The Years of Persecution, 1933-1939|url=http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/camps/ftp.py?camps//marzahn//marzahn-established}} Friedlaender puts the date of the initial arrests at May 1936, not July&lt;/ref&gt;
Upon arrival the men and women were separated and taken for medical inspection. From there, prisoners were either deemed fit to work or unfit. Those that were deemed unfit were sent to execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Atrocities, Massacres, and War Crimes|last=Mikaberidze|first=Alexander|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, the prison would be surrounded by [[barbed wire]] and prisoners were subject to forced labour in armament plants.&lt;ref name="ushmm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="friedlaender" /&gt; The camp also led to involuntary sterilization and loss of citizenship to the Gypsy prisoners as they were classified as aliens (Non-Aryans).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Milton|first=Sybil|date=1990-01-01|title=The Context of the Holocaust|jstor=1430708|journal=German Studies Review|volume=13|issue=2|pages=269–283|doi=10.2307/1430708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, the men from Marzahn would be sent to [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] (in 1938), and women and children were sent to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] (in 1943).&lt;ref name="ushmm" /&gt;

'''Betancuria''' is a small town and a municipality in the western part of the island of [[Fuerteventura]] in the [[Province of Las Palmas]], [[Canary Islands]], Spain. The population is 811 (2013),&lt;ref name=pop/&gt; and the area is {{convert|103.64|km²|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=area/&gt; It is situated in a mountainous region, {{convert|4|km|0|abbr=on}} west of [[Antigua, Fuerteventura|Antigua]] and {{convert|21|km|0|abbr=on}} southwest of the island capital [[Puerto del Rosario]]. By population it is the smallest municipality in Fuerteventura as well as all of the Canary Islands.

Betancuria is named after [[Jean de Béthencourt]], who founded the town in 1404 with [[Gadifer de La Salle]]. It was the original capital of the [[Kingdom of the Canary Islands]], and later capital of Fuerteventura. 

In 1424 Pope [[Martin V]] erected in Betancuria brief [[Bishopric of Fuerteventura]], which encompassed all the [[Canary Islands]] except the island of [[Lanzarote]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juliosanchezrodriguez.com/convertidos/07-02_Cisma.pdf El Cisma de Occidente y el Obispado de Fuerteventura]&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of this bishopric is directly related to the events that occurred after the [[Western Schism|Great Schism]] (1378-1417). This was due to the fact that the bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Canarias|San Marcial del Rubicón]] in [[Lanzarote]] (only diocese at the time of the Canary Islands) did not recognize the papacy of Martin V, as this bishop was a supporter of [[anti-Pope]] [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]]. The Bishopric of Fuerteventura was based in ''Parish of Santa María de Betancuria'', for it to rank high cathedral. After the reintegration of the Diocese of San Marcial del Rubicón in the papacy of Martin V, the Bishopric of Fuerteventura was abolished only seven years after it was created in 1431.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juliosanchezrodriguez.com/convertidos/07-02_Cisma.pdf El Cisma de Occidente y el Obispado de Fuerteventura]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was razed by [[pirates]] in 1593, but remained capital of Fuerteventura until 1834, when [[Antigua, Fuerteventura|Antigua]] became capital. In Vega de Rio Palmas is the hermitage of the Virgen de la Peña, the patron saint of the island of Fuerteventura.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55872">The term '''bioarchaeology''' was first coined by British archaeologist [[Grahame Clark]] in 1972 as a reference to [[zooarchaeology]], or the study of animal bones from [[Archaeological site|archaeological sites]].  Redefined in 1977 by [[Jane Buikstra]], bioarchaeology in the US now refers to the scientific study of human remains from archaeological sites, a discipline known in other countries as '''osteoarchaeology''' or '''palaeo-osteology'''.  In England and other European countries, the term 'bioarchaeology' is borrowed to cover all biological remains from sites.

Bioarchaeology was largely born from the practices of [[New Archaeology]], which developed in the US in the 1970s as a reaction to a mainly [[Culture history|cultural-historical]] approach to understanding the past.  Proponents of New Archaeology advocated using processual methods to test hypotheses about the interaction between culture and biology, or a biocultural approach. Some archaeologists advocate a more holistic approach to bioarchaeology that incorporates [[critical theory]] and is more relevant to modern descent populations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

If possible, human remains from archaeological sites are analyzed to determine sex, age, and health.

== Paleodemography ==
Bioarchaeologists sometimes create [[Life table|life tables]], a type of [[Cohort study|cohort analysis]], to understand the demographic characteristics (such as risk of death or [[sex ratio]]) of a given age cohort within a population.  Age and sex are crucial variables in the construction of a life table, although this information is often not available to bioarchaeologists. Therefore, it is often necessary to estimate the age and sex of individuals based on specific morphological characteristics of the skeleton.

=== Age estimation ===
The estimation of age in bioarchaeology and [[osteology]] actually refers to an approximation of skeletal or biological age-at-death. The primary assumption in age estimation is that an individual's skeletal age is closely associated with their chronological age. Age estimation can be based on patterns of growth and development or degenerative changes in the skeleton. Many methods tracking these types of changes have been developed using a variety of skeletal series. For instance, in children age is typically estimated by assessing their dental development, ossification and fusion of specific skeletal elements, or long bone length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Human skeletal remains: excavation, analysis, interpretation (3rd ed.)|last=Ubelaker|first=D.H.|publisher=Taraxacum|year=1999|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In adults, degenerative changes to the [[pubic symphysis]], the auricular surface of the [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]], the sternal end of the 4th rib, and [[Attrition (dental)|dental attrition]] are commonly used to estimate skeletal age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Standards for data collection from human skeletal remains|last=Buikstra|first=J.E.|author2=D.H. Ubelaker|publisher=Arkansas Archaeological Survey|year=1994|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lovejoy|first=C.O.|author2=Meindl, R.S.|author3=Pryzbeck, T.R.|author4=Mensforth R.P.|year=1985|title=Chronological metamorphosis of the auricular surface of the ilium: a new method for the determination of adult skeletal age at death|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=68|pages=15–28|doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330680103|pmid=4061599}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lovejoy|first=C.O.|year=1985|title=Dental wear in the Libben population: its functional pattern and role in the determination of adult skeletal age at death|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=68|pages=47–56|doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330680105|pmid=4061601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sex determination ===

[[Human skeleton|Differences in male and female skeletal anatomy]] are used by bioarchaeologists to determine the biological sex of human skeletons.  Humans are [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]], although overlap in body shape and sexual characteristics is possible. Not all skeletons can be assigned a sex, and some may be wrongly identified as male or female.  Sexing skeletons is based on the observation that biological males and biological females differ most in the skull and pelvis; bioarchaeologists focus on these parts of the body when determining sex, although other body parts can also be used.  The female pelvis is generally broader than the male pelvis, and the angle between the two inferior pubic rami (the sub-pubic angle) is wider and more U-shaped, while the sub-pubic angle of the male is more V-shaped and less than 90 degrees.&lt;ref name="Mays, Simon 1998" /&gt;  Phenice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phenice|first1=T.W.|year=1969|title=A Newly Developed Visual Method of Sexing the Os Pubis|url=|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=30|issue=|pages=297–302|doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330300214|pmid=5772048}}&lt;/ref&gt; details numerous visual differences between the male and female pelvis.

In general, the male skeleton is more robust than the female skeleton because of the greater muscles mass of the male. Males generally have more pronounced brow ridges, nuchal crests, and mastoid processes.  It should be remembered that skeletal size and robustness are influenced by nutrition and activity levels. Pelvic and cranial features are considered to be more reliable indicators of biological sex.  Sexing skeletons of young people who have not completed puberty is more difficult and problematic than sexing adults, because the body has not had time to develop fully.&lt;ref name="Mays, Simon 1998" /&gt;

Bioarchaeological sexing of skeletons is not error-proof.  In reviewing the sexing of Egyptian skulls from Qua and  Badari, Mann &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mann|first1=George E|year=1989|title=On the Accuracy of Sexing of Skeletons in Archaeological Reports|url=|journal=The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology|volume=75|issue=|pages=246–49|doi=10.2307/3821921}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that 20.3% could be assigned to a different sex than the sex indicated in the archaeological literature. A re-evalutaion of Mann's work showed that he did not understand the tomb numbering system of the old excavation and assigned wrong tomb numbers to the skulls. The sexing of the bone material was actually quite correct.&lt;ref&gt;Tatjana Beuthe: ''On the vailidity of Sexing data from early excavations: examples from Qua'', in ''Journal of Egyptian Archaeology'', 99 (2013), 308-311&lt;/ref&gt; However, recording errors and re-arranging of human remains may play a part in this great incidence of misidentification.

Direct testing of bioarchaeological methods for sexing skeletons by comparing gendered names on coffin plates from the crypt at [[Christ Church, Spitalfields|Christ Church, Spitalfields, London]] to the associated remains resulted in a 98 percent success rate.&lt;ref&gt;Molleson, Theya, and M. Cox. The Spitalfields Project, Volume 2: The Anthropology: Council For British Archaeology, York, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex-based differences are not inherently a form of inequality, but become an inequality when members of one sex are given privileges based on their sex.  This stems from society investing differences with cultural and social meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Ames, Kenneth M. "The Archaeology of Rank." ''Handbook of Archaeological Theories''. Eds. R. Alexander Bently, [[Herbert D. G. Maschner]] and [[Christopher Chippendale]]. Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press, 2008. 487–513.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gendered work patterns may make their marks on the bones and be identifiable in the archaeological record. Molleson&lt;ref name="Molleson, Theya 1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Molleson|first1=Theya|year=1994|title=The Eloquent Bones of Abu Hureyra|url=|journal=Scientific American|volume=271|issue=2|pages=70–75|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0894-70}}&lt;/ref&gt; found evidence of gendered work patterns by noting extremely arthritic big toes, a collapse of the last dorsal vertebrae, and muscular arms and legs among female skeletons at Abu Hureyra.  She interpreted this sex-based pattern of skeletal difference as indicative of gendered work patterns. These kinds of skeletal changes could have resulted from women spending long periods of time kneeling while grinding grain with the toes curled forward. Investigation of gender from mortuary remains is of growing interest to archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Bettina, and Nancy L. Wicker. Gender and the Archaeology of Death. Walnut Creek, CA: Alta Mira Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-specific stress indicators ==

=== Dental non-specific stress indicators ===

==== Enamel hypoplasia ====
[[Enamel hypoplasia]] refers to transverse furrows or pits that form in the enamel surface of teeth when the normal process of tooth growth stops, resulting in a deficit of enamel.  Enamel hypoplasias generally form due to disease and/or poor nutrition.&lt;ref name="Mays, Simon 1998"&gt;Mays, Simon. The Archaeology of Human Bones. 1998. Second ed. New York: Routledge, 2010. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Linear furrows are commonly referred to as linear enamel hypoplasias (LEHs); LEHs can range in size from microscopic to visible to the naked eye.  By examining the spacing of [[perikymata]] grooves (horizontal growth lines), the duration of the stressor can be estimated,&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, Louise T. Enamel Traces of Early Lifetime Events. Cambridge Studies in Biological and Evolutionary Anthropology: Cambridge University Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; although Mays argues that the width of the hypoplasia bears only an indirect relationship to the duration of the stressor.

Studies of dental enamel hypoplasia are used to study child health.  Unlike bone, teeth are not remodeled, so they can provide a more reliable indicator of past health events as long as the enamel remains intact. Dental hypoplasias provide an indicator of health status during the time in childhood when the enamel of the tooth crown is being formed. Not all of the enamel layers are visible on the surface of the tooth because enamel layers that are formed early in crown development are buried by later layers. Hypoplasias on this part of the tooth do not show on the surface of the tooth.  Because of this buried enamel, teeth record stressors form a few months after the start of the event.  The proportion of enamel crown formation time represented by this buried in enamel varies from up to 50 percent in molars to 15-20 percent in anterior teeth.&lt;ref name="Mays, Simon 1998" /&gt;  Surface hypoplasias record stressors occurring from about one to seven years, or up to 13 years if the third molar is included.&lt;ref&gt;Mays, Simon. The Archaeology of Human Bones. 1998. Second ed. New York: Routledge, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Skeletal non-specific stress indicators ===

==== Porotic hyperostosis/cribra orbitalia ====
It was long assumed that [[iron deficiency anemia]] has marked effects on the flat bones of the cranium of infants and young children. That as the body attempts to compensate for low iron levels by increasing red blood cell production in the young, sieve-like lesions develop in the cranial vaults (termed [[porotic hyperostosis]]) and/or the [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbits]] (termed cribia orbitalia). This bone is spongy and soft.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Martin, Debra L., Ryan P. Harrod, and Ventura R. Pérez. Bioarchaeology: An Integrated Approach to Working with Human Remains. New York: Springer, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is however, highly unlikely that iron deficiency anemia is a cause of either porotic hyperostosis or cribra orbitalia.&lt;ref&gt;Walker et al. 2009 "The Causes of Porotic Hyperostosis and Cribra Orbitalia: A Reappraisal of the Iron-Deficiency-Anemia Hypothesis" American Journal of Physical Anthropology.&lt;/ref&gt; These are more likely the result of vascular activity in these areas and are unlikely to be pathological.   The development of cribra orbitalia and porotic hyperostosis could also be attributed to other causes besides an iron deficiency in the diet, such as nutrients lost to intestinal parasites.  However, dietary deficiencies are the most probable cause.&lt;ref name="Schutkowski, Holger 2008"&gt;Schutkowski, Holger. "Thoughts for Food: Evidence and Meaning of Past Dietary Habits."  Between Biology and Culture. Ed. Holger Schutkowski. Cambridge Studies in Biological and Evolutionary Anthropology: Cambridge University Press, 2008. 141–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anemia incidence may be a result of inequalities within society, and/or indicative of different work patterns and activities among different groups within society.  A study of iron-deficiency among early Mongolian nomads showed that although overall rates of cribra orbitalia declined from 28.7 percent (27.8 percent of the total female population, 28.4 percent of the total male population, 75 percent of the total juvenile population) during the Bronze and Iron Ages, to 15.5 percent during the Hunnu (2209–1907 BP) period, the rate of females with cribra orbitalia remained roughly the same, while the incidence of cribra orbitalia among males and children declined (29.4  percent of the total female population, 5.3 percent of the total male population, and 25 percent of the juvenile population had cribra orbitalia).&lt;ref&gt;Bazarsad, Naran. "Iron-Deficiency Anemia in Early Mongolian Nomads."  Ancient Health: Skeletal Indicators of Agricultural and Economic Intensification. Eds. Mark Nathan Cohen and Gillian M.M. Crane-Kramer. Gainesville/Tallahassee/Tampa/Boca Raton: University Press of Florida, 2007. 250–54.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bazarsad posits several reasons for this distribution of cribra orbitalia: adults may have lower rates of cribra orbitalia than juveniles because lesions either heal with age or lead to death.  Higher rates of cribia orbitalia among females may indicate lesser health status, or greater survival of young females with cribia orbitalia into adulthood.

==== Harris lines ====
[[Harris lines]] form before adulthood, when bone growth is temporarily halted or slowed down due to some sort of stress (either disease or malnutrition).  During this time, bone mineralization continues, but growth does not, or does so at very reduced levels.  If and when the stressor is overcome, bone growth will resume, resulting in a line of increased mineral density that will be visible in a [[radiograph]].&lt;ref name="Schutkowski, Holger 2008" /&gt; If there is not recovery from the stressor, no line will be formed.&lt;ref name="Danforth, Marie Elaine 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Danforth|first1=Marie Elaine|year=1999|title=Nutrition and Politics in Prehistory|url=|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=28|issue=|pages=1–25|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.28.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hair ===
The stress hormone [[cortisol]] is deposited in hair as it grows.  This has been used successfully to detect fluctuating levels of stress in the later lifespan of mummies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schulich.uwo.ca/moleculartoxicology/files/Linked/Hair%20cortisol%20as%20a%20biological%20marker%20of%20chronic%20stress%20Current%20status%20future%20directions%20and%20unanswered%20questions.pdf|title=Hair cortisol as a biological marker of chronic stress: Current status, future directions and unanswered questions|date=2011-09-12|accessdate=2012-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanical stress and activity indicators ==

Examining the effects that activities and workload has upon the skeleton allows the archaeologist to examine who was doing what kinds of labor, and how activities were structured within society. The division of labor within the [[Household archaeology|household]] may be divided according to [[gender]] and age, or be based on other hierarchical social structures. Human remains can allow archaeologists to uncover patterns in the division of labor.

Living bones are subject to [[Wolff's law]], which states that bones are physically affected and remodeled by physical activity or inactivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wolff|first1=Julius|year=1893|title=Review: Das Gesetz Der Transformation Der Knochen (the Law of the Transformation of Bones)|url=|journal=The British Medical Journal|volume=1|issue=1673|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Increases in mechanical stress tend to produce bones that are thicker and stronger.

Muscle attachment sites (also called [[Enthesis|entheses]]) have been thought to be impacted in the same way causing what were once called musculoskeletal stress markers, but now widely named entheseal changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uc.pt/en/cia/msm/MSM_terminology3.pdf|title=Terminology.

One example of how these changes have been used to study activities is the [[African Burial Ground National Monument|New York African Burial Ground]] in New York. This provides evidence of the brutal working conditions under which the enslaved labored;&lt;ref&gt;Wilczak, C., R.C. Watkins, and M.L. Blakey. Skeletal Indicators of Work: Musculoskeletal, Arthritic, and Traumatic Events: US Department of the Interior, National Park Service, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; [[osteoarthritis]] of the vertebrae was very common, even among the young.  The pattern of osteoarthritis combined with the early age of onset provides evidence of labor that resulted in mechanical strain to the neck.  One male skeleton shows stress lesions at 37 percent of 33 muscle or ligament attachments, showing he experienced significant musculoskeletal stress.  Overall, the interred show signs of significant musculoskeletal stress and heavy workloads, although workload and activities varied among different individuals.  Some individuals show high levels of stress, while others do not.  This references the variety of types of labor (e.g., domestic vs. carrying heavy loads) labor that enslaved individuals were forced to perform.

=== Injury and workload ===
[[Bone fracture|Fractures]] to bones during or after excavation will appear relatively fresh, with broken surfaces appearing white and unweathered.  Distinguishing between fractures around the time of death and [[Taphonomy|post-depositional]] fractures in bone is difficult, as both types of fractures will show signs of weathering.  Unless evidence of bone healing or other factors are present, researchers may choose to regard all weathered fractures as post-depositional.&lt;ref name="Mays, Simon 1998" /&gt;

Evidence of perimortal fractures (or fractures inflicted on a fresh corpse) can be distinguished in unhealed metal blade injuries to the bones.  Living or freshly dead bones are somewhat resilient, so metal blade injuries to bone will generate a linear cut with relatively clean edges rather than irregular shattering.&lt;ref name="Mays, Simon 1998" /&gt; Archaeologists have tried using the microscopic parallel scratch marks on cut bones in order to estimate the trajectory of the blade that caused the injury.&lt;ref&gt;Wenham, S.J., and J. Wakely. Features of Blade-Injuries to Bone Surfaces in  Six Anglo-Saxon Skeletons from Eccles, Kent: BAR 211 Oxford, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diet and dental health ==

=== Caries ===
[[Dental caries]], commonly referred to as cavities or tooth decay, are caused by localized destruction of tooth enamel, as a result of acids produced by bacteria feeding upon and fermenting carbohydrates in the mouth.  Subsistence based upon agriculture is strongly associated with a higher rate of caries than subsistence based upon foraging, because of the higher levels of carbohydrates in diets based upon agriculture.&lt;ref name="Danforth, Marie Elaine 1999" /&gt; For example, bioarchaeologists have used caries in skeletons to correlate a diet of rice and agriculture with the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tayles|first1=N.|last2=Domett|first2=K.|last3=Nelsen|first3=K.|year=2000|title=Agriculture and dental caries?

== Stable isotope analysis ==
Stable isotope analysis of [[carbon]] and nitrogen in human bone collagen allows bioarchaeologists to carry out dietary reconstruction and to make nutritional inferences. These chemical signatures reflect long-term dietary patterns, rather than a single meal or [[Feasting and Inequality|feast]]. Stable isotope analysis monitors the ratio of carbon 13 to carbon 12 (&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C/&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C), which is expressed as parts per mil (per thousand) using delta notation (δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C).  The ratio of carbon isotopes varies according to the types of plants consumed with different photosynthesis pathways. The three  photosynthesis pathways are [[C3 carbon fixation]], [[C4 carbon fixation]] and [[Crassulacean acid metabolism]]. C4 plants are mainly grasses from tropical and subtropical regions, and are adapted to higher levels of radiation than C3 plants.  Corn, millet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Larsen|first1=Clark Spencer|year=1995|title=Biological Changes in Human Populations with Agriculture|url=|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=24|issue=|pages=185–213|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.24.1.185}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sugar cane are some well-known C4 domesticates, while all trees and shrubs use the C3 pathway.&lt;ref name="Bocherens, Herve 2001"&gt;Bocherens, Herve.

[[Nitrogen]] isotopes (&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N and &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N) have been used to estimate the relative contributions of legumes verses nonlegumes, as well as terrestrial versus marine resources to the diet.&lt;ref name="Klepinger, Linda L 1984" /&gt;&lt;ref name="White, Christine D. 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=Christine D.|display-authors=etal|year=2001|title=Social Complexity and Food Systems at Altun Ha, Belize: The Isotopic Evidence|url=|journal=Latin American Antiquity|volume=12|issue=4|pages=371–93|doi=10.2307/972085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeletons excavated from the Coburn Street Burial Ground (1750 to 1827 CE) in [[Cape Town]], South Africa, were analyzed using stable isotope data by Cox ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Glenda|display-authors=etal|year=2001|title=Stable Carbon and Nitrogen Isotopic Analyses of the Underclass at the Colonial Cape of Good Hope in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries|url=|journal=World Archaeology|volume=33|issue=1|pages=73–97|doi=10.1080/00438240126647}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to determine geographical histories and life histories of the interred.  The people buried in this cemetery were assumed to be slaves and members of the underclass based on the informal nature of the cemetery; biomechanical stress analysis &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ledger|first1=Michael|display-authors=etal|year=2000|title=Biomechanical Beamanalysis of Long Bones from a Late 18th Century Slave Cemetery in Cape Town, South Africa|url=|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=112|issue=2|pages=207–16|doi=10.1002/(sici)1096-8644(2000)112:2&lt;207::aid-ajpa7&gt;3.0.co;2-k|pmid=10813703}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stable isotope analysis, combined with other archaeological data, seem to support this supposition.

Based on stable isotope levels, eight Cobern Street Burial Ground individuals consumed a diet based on C4 (tropical) plants in childhood, then consumed more C3 plants, which were more common at the Cape later in their lives.  Six of these individuals had dental modifications similar to those carried out by peoples inhabiting tropical areas known to be targeted by slavers who brought enslaved individuals from other parts of Africa to the colony.  Based on this evidence, Cox ''et al''. argue that these individuals represent enslaved persons from areas of Africa where C4 plants are consumed and who were brought to the Cape as laborers. Cox ''et al''. do not assign these individuals to a specific [[Ethnicity and archaeology|ethnicity]], but do point out that similar dental modifications are carried out by the Makua, Yao, and Marav peoples.  Four individuals were buried with no [[grave goods]], in accordance with Muslim tradition, facing [[Signal Hill (Cape Town)|Signal Hill]], which is a point of significance for local Muslims. Their isotopic signatures indicate that they grew up in a temperate environment consuming mostly C3 plants, but some C4 plants.  Many of the isotopic signatures of interred individuals indicate that they Cox ''et al''. argue that these individuals were from the Indian Ocean area. They also suggest that these individuals were [[Archaeology of religion and ritual|Muslims]].  Cox ''et al''. argue that stable isotopic analysis of burials, combined with historical and archaeological data can be an effective way in of investigating the worldwide migrations forced by the [[African Slave Trade]], as well as the emergence of the underclass and working class in the colonial Old World.

Stable isotope analysis of [[strontium]] and [[oxygen]] can also be carried out.  The amounts of these isotopes vary in different geological locations.  Because bone is a dynamic tissue that is remodeled over time, and because different parts of the skeleton are laid down at particular times over the course of a human life,  stable isotope analysis can be used to investigate population movements in the past and indicate where people lived at various points of their lives.&lt;ref name="Mays, Simon 1998" /&gt;

== Archaeological uses of DNA ==
[[Ancient DNA|aDNA]] analysis of past populations is used by archaeology to genetically determine the sex of individuals, determine genetic relatedness, understand marriage patterns, and investigate prehistoric population movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaestle|first1=Fredericka A.|last2=Horsburgh|first2=K.

== Bioarchaeological treatments of equality and inequality ==
Aspects of the relationship between the physical body and socio-cultural conditions and practices can be recognized through the study of human remains.  This is most often emphasized in a "[[Biocultural anthropology|biocultural]] bioarchaeology" model. It has often been the case that bioarchaeology has been regarded as a [[positivist]], science-based discipline, while theories of the living body in the social sciences have been viewed as [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivist]] in nature. Physical anthropology and bioarchaeology have been criticized for having little to no concern for culture or history. Blakey&lt;ref name="Blakey, Michael L 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blakey|first1=Michael L|year=2001|title=Bioarchaeology of the African Diaspora in the Americas: Its Origins and Scope|url=|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=30|issue=|pages=387–422|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.30.1.387}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blakey, Michael L. Introduction: Section 1: Background of the New York African Burial Ground Project. Philadelphia, PA: US Department of the Interior, National Park Service, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that scientific or forensic treatments of human remains from archaeological sites construct a view of the past that is neither cultural nor historic, and has suggested that a biocultural version of bioarchaeology will be able to construct a more meaningful and nuanced history that is more relevant to modern populations, especially descent populations.  By biocultural, Blakey means a type of bioarchaeology that is not simply descriptive, but  combines the standard forensic techniques of describing stature, sex and age with investigations of demography and epidemiology in order to verify or critique socioeconomic conditions experienced by human communities of the past.

Currently, some bioarchaeologists are coming to view the discipline as lying at a crucial interface between the science and the humanities; as the human body is non-static, and is constantly being made and re-made by both biological and cultural factors.&lt;ref&gt;Lorentz, Kirsi.

Buikstra and Lane A Beck: Academic Press/Elsevier, 2006. 347–258.&lt;/ref&gt; considers her work to be aligned with Blakey's biocultural version of bioarchaeology because of her emphasis on models stemming from [[critical theory]] and [[political economy]].  She acknowledges that scholars such as [[Clark Spencer Larsen|Larsen]]&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Clark Spencer. "The Changing Face of Bioarchaeology: An Interdisciplinary Science."

Princeton and Oxford: Princeton University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; are productive, but points out that his is a different type of bioarchaeology that focuses on quality of life, lifestyle, behavior, biological relatedness, and population history.  It does not closely link skeletal remains to their archaeological context, and is best viewed as a "skeletal biology of the past."&lt;ref&gt;Buikstra, Jane E.

Inequalities exist in all human societies, even so-called “egalitarian” ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Osborne|first1=Robin|year=2007|title=Is Archaeology Equal to Equality|url=|journal=World Archaeology|volume=39|issue=2|pages=143–50|doi=10.1080/00438240701249447}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that bioarchaeology has helped to dispel the idea that life for foragers of the past was “nasty, brutish and short”; bioarchaeological studies have shown that foragers of the past were often quite healthy, while agricultural societies tend to have increased incidence of malnutrition and disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lambert|first1=Patricia M|year=2009|title=Health Versus Fitness: Competing Themes in the Origins and Spread of Agriculture?|url=|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=50|issue=5|pages=603–08|doi=10.1086/605354}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, based on a comparison of foragers from Oakhurst to agriculturalists from K2 and Mapungubwe, Steyn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steyne|first1=Maryna|year=1997|title=A Reassessment of the Human Skeletons from K2 and Mapungubwe (South Africa)|url=|journal=The South African Archaeological Bulletin|volume=52|issue=165|pages=14–20|doi=10.2307/3888972}}&lt;/ref&gt; believes that agriculturalists from K2 and Mapungubwe were not subject to the lower nutritional levels expected for this type of subsistence system.
	
Danforth argues that more “complex” state-level societies display greater health differences between elites and the rest of society, with elites having the advantage, and that this disparity increases as societies become more unequal.  Some status differences in society do not necessarily mean radically different nutritional levels; Powell did not find evidence of great nutritional differences between elites and commoners, but did find lower rates of anemia among elites in Moundville.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, M.L.

== Archaeological ethics ==
There are ethical issues with bioarchaeology that revolve around treatment and respect for the dead.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Large-scale skeletal collections were first amassed in the US in the 19th century, largely from the remains of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]].  No permission was ever granted from surviving family for study and display.  Recently, federal laws such as [[NAGPRA]] (Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act) have allowed Native Americans to regain control over the skeletal remains of their ancestors and associated artifacts in order to reassert their cultural identities.

NAGPRA passed in 1990.  At this time, many archaeologists underestimated the public perception of archaeologists as non-productive members of society and grave robbers.&lt;ref name="Patterson, Thomas C 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patterson|first1=Thomas C|year=1999|title=The Political Economy of Archaeology in the United States|url=|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=28|issue=|pages=155–75|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.28.1.155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns about occasional mistreatment of Native American remains are not unfounded: in a Minnesota excavation 1971, White and Native American remains were treated differently; remains of White people were reburied, while remains of Native American people were placed in cardboard boxes and placed in a natural history museum.&lt;ref name="Patterson, Thomas C 1999" /&gt; Blakey &lt;ref name="Blakey, Michael L 2001" /&gt; relates the growth in African American bioarchaeology to NAGPRA and its effect of cutting physical anthropologist off from their study of Native American remains.

Bioarchaeology in Europe is not as affected by these repatriation issues as American bioarchaeology but regardless the ethical considerations associated with working with human remains are, and should, be considered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, because much of European archaeology has been focused on classical roots, artifacts and art have been overemphasized and Roman and post-Roman skeletal remains were nearly completely neglected until the 1980s. Prehistoric archaeology in Europe is a different story, as biological remains began to be analyzed earlier than in classical archaeology.

{{History Of The Cold War}}
The '''Cold War period of 1985–1991''' began with the rise of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] as leader of the [[Soviet Union]].  Gorbachev was a revolutionary leader for the USSR, as he was the first to promote liberalization of the political landscape ([[Glasnost]]) and capitalist elements into the economy ([[Perestroika]]); prior to this, the USSR had been strictly prohibiting liberal reform and maintained an inefficient [[command economy]].  The USSR, despite facing massive economic difficulties, was involved in a costly [[arms race]] with the [[United States]] under President [[Ronald Reagan]]. Regardless, the USSR began to crumble as liberal reforms proved difficult to handle and capitalist changes to the economy were badly transitioned and caused major problems.   The Cold War came to an end when the [[Afghan-Soviet War|last war]] of Soviet occupation [[Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan|ended]] in [[Communist Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], the [[Fall of the Berlin Wall|Berlin Wall came down]] in Germany, and a [[Revolutions of 1989|series of mostly peaceful revolutions]] swept the [[Soviet Bloc]] states of [[eastern Europe]] in 1989.

==Thaw in relations==
After the deaths of three successive elderly Soviet leaders since 1982, the Soviet [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] elected Gorbachev [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party General Secretary]] in March 1985, marking the rise of a new generation of leadership. Under Gorbachev, relatively young reform-oriented [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrats]], who had begun their careers in the heyday of "[[History of the Soviet Union (1953–1985)|de-Stalinization]]" under reformist leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]], rapidly consolidated power, providing new momentum for political and economic liberalization, and the impetus for cultivating warmer relations and trade with the West.

[[File:Reagan and Gorbachev hold discussions.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Reagan and Gorbachev during their first summit meeting in the beach house]]
On the Western front, President Reagan's administration had taken a hard line against the Soviet Union. Under the [[Reagan Doctrine]], the Reagan administration began providing military support to [[anti-communist]] armed movements in [[Afghanistan]], [[Angola]], [[Nicaragua]] and elsewhere.

A major breakthrough came in 1985–87, with the successful negotiation of the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]] (INF). The INF Treaty of December 1987, signed by Reagan and Gorbachev, eliminated all nuclear and conventional missiles, as well as their launchers, with ranges of 500–1,000 kilometres (310–620 mi) (short-range) and 1,000–5,500 kilometres (620–3,420 mi) (intermediate-range). The treaty did not cover sea-launched missiles. By May 1991, after on-site investigations by both sides, 2,700 missiles had been destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn E. Davis, "Lessons of the INF Treaty." ''Foreign Affairs'' 66.4 (1988): 720–734. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20043479 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=CQ Press|title=Guide to Congress|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iqN2AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA253|year=2012|publisher=SAGE |pages=252–53|isbn=978-1-4522-3532-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reagan administration also persuaded the [[Saudi Arabia]]n oil companies to increase oil production.&lt;ref name="iet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iet.ru/files/persona/gaidar/un_en.htm |title=Public Expectations and Trust towards the Government: Post-Revolution Stabilization and its Discontents|accessdate=2008-03-15|author=Gaidar, Yegor}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a three-times drop in the prices of oil, and oil was the main source of Soviet export revenues.&lt;ref name="iet" /&gt; Following the USSR's previous large military buildup, President Reagan ordered an enormous peacetime defense buildup of the [[United States Military]]; the Soviets did not respond to this by building up their military because the military expenses, in combination with [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivized agriculture]] in the nation, and inefficient [[Planned economy|planned manufacturing]], would cause a heavy burden for the [[Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet economy]]. It was already stagnant and in a poor state prior to the tenure of Mikhail Gorbachev who, despite significant attempts at reform, was unable to revitalise the economy.&lt;ref name="Gaidar"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gaidar|first=Yegor|title=Collapse of an Empire: Lessons for Modern Russia|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|date=2007-10-17|isbn=5-8243-0759-8|language=Russian|pages=190–210}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, Reagan and Gorbachev held their first of four "summit" meetings, this one in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. After discussing policy, facts, etc., Reagan invited Gorbachev to go with him to a small house near the beach. The two leaders spoke in that house well over their time limit, but came out with the news that they had planned two more (soon three more) summits.

The second summit took place the following year, in 1986 on October 11, in [[Reykjavík]], [[Iceland]]. The [[Reykjavík Summit|meeting]] was held to pursue discussions about scaling back their [[intermediate-range ballistic missile]] arsenals in [[Europe]]. The talks came close to achieving an overall breakthrough on [[arms control|nuclear arms control]], but ended in failure due to Reagan's proposed [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] and Gorbachev's proposed cancellation of it. Nonetheless, cooperation continued to increase and, where it failed, Gorbachev reduced some strategic arms unilaterally.

Fundamental to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Gorbachev policy initiatives of Restructuring (''[[Perestroika]]'') and Openness (''[[Glasnost]]'') had ripple effects throughout the Soviet world, including eventually making it impossible to reassert central control over [[Warsaw Pact]] member states without resorting to military force.

[[File:Tear down this wall.ogv|thumbtime=3:29|thumb|230px|[[United States President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] delivers a speech at the [[Berlin Wall]] in June 1987, in which he called for [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet General Secretary]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] to "[[Tear down this wall|Tear Down This Wall!]]". Famous passage begins at 11:10 into this video.]]

On June 12, 1987, Reagan [[tear down this wall|challenged Gorbachev to go further]] with his reforms and democratization by tearing down the [[Berlin Wall]]. In a speech at the [[Brandenburg Gate]] next to the wall, Reagan stated:

{{quote|General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union, Central and South-East Europe, if you seek liberalization, come here to this gate; Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate. Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-06-12-reagan-speech_N.htm|title=Reagan's 'tear down this wall' speech turns 20|work=USA Today|date=2007-06-12|accessdate=2008-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While the aging communist European leaders kept their states in the grip of "normalization", Gorbachev's reformist policies in the Soviet Union exposed how a once revolutionary Communist Party had become moribund at the very center of the system. Facing declining revenues due to declining oil prices and rising expenditures related to the arms race and the command economy, the Soviet Union was forced during the 1980s to take on significant amounts of debt from the Western banking sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Fifty-Year Wound|last=Leebaert |first=Derek|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|year=2002|isbn=|location=New York, USA|pages=595}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growing public disapproval of the [[Soviet–Afghan War]], and the socio-political effects of the [[Chernobyl accident]] in [[Ukraine]] increased public support for these policies. By the spring of 1989, the USSR had not only experienced lively media debate, but had also held its first multi-candidate elections. For the first time in recent history, the force of liberalization was spreading from West to East.

==Revolt spreads through Communist Europe==
{{main article|Revolutions of 1989}}
Grassroots organizations, such as [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]]'s [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] movement, rapidly gained ground with strong popular bases. In February 1989 the Polish government opened talks with opposition, known as the [[Polish Round Table Agreement]], which allowed elections with participation of anti-Communist parties in June 1989. Also in 1989 the Communist government in [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]] started to negotiate organizing of competitive elections which took place in 1990. In [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[East Germany]], mass protests unseated entrenched Communist leaders. The Communist regimes in [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and [[Communist Romania|Romania]] also crumbled, in the latter case as the result of a [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|violent uprising]]. Attitudes had changed enough that [[US Secretary of State]] [[James Baker]] suggested that the American government would not be opposed to Soviet intervention in Romania, on behalf of the opposition, to prevent bloodshed.&lt;ref&gt;Garthof, Raymond L. "The Great Transition: American-Soviet Relations and the End of the Cold War" (Washington: Brookings Institution, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; The tidal wave of change culminated with the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in November 1989, which symbolized the collapse of European Communist governments and graphically ended the [[Iron Curtain]] divide of Europe.

The collapse of the European governments with Gorbachev's tacit consent inadvertently encouraged several [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]] to seek greater independence from Moscow's rule. Agitation for independence in the [[Baltic states]] led to first [[Lithuania]], and then [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]], declaring their independence. Disaffection in the other republics was met by promises of greater decentralization. More open elections led to the election of candidates opposed to Communist Party rule.

In an attempt to halt the rapid changes to the system, a group of Soviet hard-liners represented by Vice-President [[Gennady Yanayev]] launched a [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|coup]] overthrowing Gorbachev in August 1991. Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] rallied the people and much of the army against the coup and the effort collapsed. Although restored to power, Gorbachev's authority had been irreparably undermined. In September, the Baltic states were granted independence. On December 1, [[Ukraine]] withdrew from the USSR. On December 26, 1991 the USSR officially dissolved, breaking up into fifteen separate nations.

== End of the Cold War and the Beginning of a New World Order ==
After the end of the [[Revolutions of 1989]], Gorbachev and [[George H. W. Bush|President Bush Sr]]. met on the neutral island of [[Malta]] to discuss the events of the year, the withdrawal of the Soviet military from Eastern Europe, and the future course of [[Soviet Union–United States relations|their relationship]].  After their discussions, the two leaders publicly announced they would work together for German reunification, the normalization of relations, the resolution of [[Third World]] conflicts, and the promotion of peace and democracy (referred to by President Bush as a "[[New world order (politics)#The Malta Conference|New World Order]]".)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/3/newsid_4119000/4119950.stm|title=1989: Malta summit ends Cold War|last=|first=|date=1989-12-03|work=British Broadcasting Corporation|access-date=2018-03-31|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the Malta Summit and the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]] negotiations on several arms control agreements began, resulting in agreements such as [[START I]] and the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]].  Additionally, the United States, still believing the Soviet Union would continue to exist in the long term, began to take steps to create a positive long-term relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Arjen Molen|title=Cold War - Conclusions 1989-1991 - Part 24/24|date=2015-09-14|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtztyzMNFOo|accessdate=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This new relationship was demonstrated by the joint American-Soviet opposition to [[Invasion of Kuwait|Iraq's invasion of Kuwait]].  The Soviet Union voted in the [[United Nations Security Council|United Nation's Security Council]] to [https://undocs.org/S/RES/678(1990) authorize] the use of military force against its [[Iraq–Russia relations|former Middle Eastern ally]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://undocs.org/S/RES/678(1990)|title=S/RES/678(1990) - E|website=undocs.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several conflicts in third world nations (i.e. [[Cambodian–Vietnamese War|Cambodia]], [[Angolan Civil War|Angola]], [[Nicaraguan Revolution|Nicaragua]]) related to the Cold War would come to an end during this era of cooperation, with both the Soviet Union and the United States working together to pressure their respective [[Proxy war|proxies]] to make peace with one another.  Overall, this detente which accompanied the final twilight of the Cold War would help bring about a relatively more peaceful world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/12/peace-in-the-post-cold-war-world/249863/|title=Peace in the Post-Cold War World|last=Cohen|first=Michael|date=December 15, 2011|website=The Atlantic|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
There is a fundamental difference in how former communist countries managed during the first quarter of the century after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Countries such as the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Slovakia experienced [[economic reconstruction]], growth and fast integration with [[EU]] and [[NATO]] while their eastern neighbors usually created hybrids of free market oligarchy system, post-communist corrupted administration and dictatorship. The territory behind the EU and NATO borders gradually to a greater or lesser extent returned to economic and military dependency on Russia.

[[Russia#Russian_Federation|Russia]] and the other [[USSR|Soviet]] successor states have faced a chaotic and harsh transition from a command economy to [[free market]] capitalism following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. A large percentage of the population currently lives in poverty. [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] growth also declined, and life expectancy dropped sharply. Living conditions also declined in some other parts of the former &lt;em&gt;[[Eastern bloc]]&lt;/em&gt;.

[[File:Reagan and Gorbachev signing.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Soviet General Secretary Gorbachev and U.S. [[Ronald Reagan|President Reagan]] signing the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty|INF Treaty]], 1987.]]
In addition, the poverty and desperation of the Russians, Ukrainians and allies of post–[[Cold War]] have led to the sale of many advanced Cold War-developed weapons systems, especially very capable modern upgraded versions, around the globe. World-class tanks ([[T-80|T-80/T-84]]), jet fighters ([[MiG-29]] and [[Su-27|Su-27/30/33]]), surface-to-air missile systems ([[SA-10 Grumble|S-300P]], [[SA-12 Gladiator/Giant|S-300V]], [[SA-15 Gauntlet|9K332]] and [[9K38 Igla|Igla]]) and others have been placed on the market in order to obtain some much-needed cash. This poses a possible problem for western powers in coming decades as they increasingly find hostile countries equipped with weapons which were designed by the Soviets to defeat them. The post–Cold War era saw a period of unprecedented prosperity in the West, especially in the United States, and a wave of democratization throughout Latin America, Africa, and Central, South-East and Eastern Europe.

Sociologist [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] expresses a less triumphalist view, arguing that the end of the Cold War is a prelude to the breakdown of ''[[Pax Americana]]''. In his essay "''Pax Americana'' is Over," Wallerstein argues, “The collapse of communism in effect signified the collapse of liberalism, removing the only ideological justification behind US hegemony, a justification tacitly supported by liberalism’s ostensible ideological opponent.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-muenster.de/PeaCon/global-texte/g-m/n/wallerstein-eagle.htm Wallerstein, Immanuel. "Pax Americana is Over"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians, including professor of history [[John Lewis Gaddis]], argue that [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] combined a policy of [[militancy]] and operational pragmatism to bring about the most significant improvement in [[Soviet-American relations]] since the end of [[World War II]]. This bloc, known as the ‘Reagan Victory School’ constitutes a different historiographical perspective to the end of the Cold War.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6221">The '''Criminal Investigation Task Force''' ('''CITF''') is an organization created in early 2002 by the [[United States Department of Defense]] to conduct [[Criminal procedure|investigation]]s of [[detainees]] captured in the [[War on Terrorism]]. It was envisioned that certain captured individuals would be tried by a [[military tribunal]] for [[war crime]]s and/or acts of [[terrorism]].

CITF was initially activated in February 2002 under a mandate from the Secretary of Defense addressed to the Secretary of the Army.  The Secretary of the Army formally tasked the US Army Criminal Investigation Command (CID), and CID activated the Criminal Investigation Task Force solely for the purpose of conducting criminal investigations against suspected terrorists detained by US forces. Under the Secretary of Defense directive, the Army was directed to maximize the capabilities of all the Services, and therefore coordinated with the US Air Force and US Navy to assist.  The CITF included members from four of five of the branches of the [[U.S. armed forces]]; [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command|Army Criminal Investigation Division]] (CID), the [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]] (NCIS), the [[United States Marine Corps Criminal Investigation Division]] (USMC CID), and the [[U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations]] (OSI).  Other personnel for the CITF came from military intelligence and support organizations.  From time to time, liaison personnel and others from Federal Law Enforcement and other government agencies were attached to the CITF.  An element from the CITF was initially deployed to Afghanistan with the goal of identifying captured terrorists, and to collect evidence for use in Military Commissions. Suspected terrorists were temporarily held at the Kandahar or Bagram Dentention Facilities.  Another element of the CITF was deployed to US Naval Base, Gunatanamo Bay, Cuba.  After the invasion of Iraq, CITF deployed yet another element to Iraq, initially to prepare for the possible transfer of detainees in Iraq to Guantanamo.  Later, CITF began to collect evidence for use in the Central Criminal Court of Iraq. CITF also maintained its role in military operations by assisting Special Operations Command (SOCOM) with forensic evidence collection.  In military, and [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]], "Task Forces" are temporary organizations created to conduct a specialized mission or task. Members of "Joint Task Forces" are drawn from many different units.  However, the CITF was never formally given the designation of a "Joint Task Force."

The CITF has operated worldwide and by 2005 had conducted over 1500 investigations and 10,000 interviews, and collected large amounts of [[evidence]] both in places where persons were captured and elsewhere. The results of CITF investigations has been used in military commissions (tribunals) at the [[Guantánamo Bay detainment camp]] and other legal proceedings in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]].[http://www.defenselink.mil/home/features/Detainee_Affairs].  The CITF has provided evidence to Iraqi Courts to prosecute insurgents and foreign fighters captured in Iraq for crimes there, and has assisted other US and international law enforcement agencies.

As a result of widespread criticism of reported [[human rights]] abuses at Guantanamo and in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere, most notably the [[Iraq prison abuse scandals]], including torture and abuse at [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib]] and [[Bagram torture and prisoner abuse|Bagram]], a great deal of media and public attention was given to the methods used by the CITF and other U.S. military and civilian agencies in [[interrogation]]s and other activities.

Senior law enforcement agents with the CITF told [[msnbc.com]] in 2006 that they began to complain to Department of Defense officials in 2002 that the interrogation tactics used by a separate team of intelligence investigators were unproductive, not likely to produce reliable information, and probably illegal. Unable to achieve a satisfactory response from the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] commanders in charge of the detainee camp, they took their concerns to both the Army Criminal Investigation Command under [[General (United States)|General]] [[Donald Ryder]], and the Naval Criminal Investigative Service under [[David Brant]]. Brant alerted [[Alberto J. Mora]], the [[general counsel]] for the [[United States Navy|Navy]]. [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15361458/] The first commander of the CITF was Colonel (now retired) Brittain Mallow, and his Deputy was Special Agent Mark Fallon.  Their names have been in several articles and also mentioned during Congressional testimony.

Some copies of government documents detailing CITF policies and practices have become publicly available through after the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] filed a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request and subsequently a [[lawsuit]]. [https://www.aclu.org/intlhumanrights/gen/13794res20050429.html] There have been numerous discussions in congress and in the press and online regarding the differences between the CITF and other law enforcement methods, and those of the intelligence organizations involved with detainees.  The CITF staff by all reports appear to have used only non-coercive, non-torturous methods in questioning detainees.

'''''Curse on This Country: The Rebellious Army of Imperial Japan''''' is a 2016 history book by [[Danny Orbach]], a professor at [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem|Hebrew University]] in [[Jerusalem]]. It deals with a variety of rebellions by the Imperial military though the 19th and early 20th century. It argues that a culture of disobedience and rebellion existed in the Japanese army, deriving from the tradition of the shishi (warriors of high aspirations), rebellious samurai active in the 1860s. It preserved itself and expanded over decades, due to political conditions, historical circumstances and the institutional development of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. It was fed by enduring leniency to right-wing rebels as long as their motives were "pure".{{fact|date=December 2017}}

The book is tracing this culture of military insubordination through its earliest manifestations, exploring such incidents as the [[Japanese invasion of Taiwan (1874)|Taiwan Expedition]] (1874), the [[Satsuma Rebellion]] (1877), and the assassinations of [[Empress Myeongseong|Queen Min]] (1895) and [[Zhang Zuolin]] (1928), as well as terrorist activities of group such as the [[Sakurakai|Cherry Blossom Society]] (1931) and the Young Officers Movement (1936). Finally, it argues that the Japanese Army's culture of disobedience helped to push the country towards unbridled imperialism, entanglement in China and finally the [[Pacific War]].&lt;ref&gt; Tsuchiyama, Ray [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2017/04/22/books/book-reviews/curse-country-rebellious-army-imperial-japan-insubordination-road-wwii/ ‘Curse on This Country: The Rebellious Army of Imperial Japan’: Of insubordination and the road to WWII April 22, 2017] ''[[Japan Times]]'' Retrieved April 24, 2017 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.andrewlownie.co.uk/authors/danny-orbach/books/curse-on-this-country Curse of This Country] Retrieved April 25, 2017 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [http://oianews.com/curse-on-this-country-the-rebellious-army-of-imperial-japan-of-insubordination-and-the-road-to-wwii 'Curse on This Country: The Rebellious Army of Imperial Japan': Of insubordination and the road to WWII April 23, 2017] ''oianews'' Retrieved April 25, 2017 &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Det Dramatiske Selskab''' is the name for several Norwegian [[amateur theatre]] drama troupes. These troupes were the first permanent theatre troupes in the cities of [[Norway]]. The period between 1780–1830 is described by many as ''the age of the dramatic companies''.

== History ==
The [[amateur theatre]] companies of Det Dramatiske Selskap founded the first theatres and gave the first regular performances in Norwegian cities. Previously, Norway was visited by travelling foreign troupes which performed in temporary structures. However, the theatres run by the amateur troupes of Det Dramatiske Selskap were not public theatres, but private.

== Det Dramatiske Selskab in Christiania ([[Oslo]]) ==
An amateur theatre performed in the city is recorded in 1765. Founded in [[Oslo]] in 1780, it gave the first regular theatre performances in Norway. On 24 October 1780, they performed ''The coffeehouse or the Scottish woman'' by [[Voltaire]] translated by [[Ditlevine Feddersen]] starring [[Henriette Mathiesen]] (Lindane) and [[Envold Falsen]] (Frelon).   

They performed first in [[Gevæxthuset]], a concert house from the 1760s by [[Grændsehaven]] and, from 1802, in [[Dramatiken]], beside the [[Centralteatret]]

They replaced the temporary theatre staged by [[Martin Nürenbach]] in the city 1771–1772, and was in turn replaced by the theatre of [[Johan Peter Strömberg]] in 1827, the [[Christiania Offentlige Theater]], which was the origin of the first Norwegian national theatre, [[Christiania Theatre]].

== Det Dramatiske Selskab in [[Kristiansand|Christianssand]] ==
Founded in 1787 by [[Henrik Arnold Thaulow (businessman)|Henrik Arnold Thaulow]], [[Nicolai Emanuel de Thygeson]], and [[Nicolai Wergeland]] (father of [[Henrik Wergeland]] and [[Camilla Collett]]). 

Their first theatre burned down in 1892, and the second was torn down in 1966. It is now counted as the first amateur theatre in Norway, and is located at [[Agder Theater]].

== Det Dramatiske Selskab in [[Bergen]] ==
Established in 1794 alongside [[Det Harmoniske Selskab]] (founded in 1765), it soon became more independent of it and popular. 

From 1800 it had its own theatre building, [[Komediehuset på Engen]], until 1828; this theatre was later to be the first public theatre in Bergen, when it, after Det Dramatiske Selskap had left in 1828, became the first travelling professional Danish theatre troupe, and, in 1850, it came to [[Den Nationale Scene]], the first public theatre in Bergen. The building was burnt after the bombardment of 15 June 1940.

== Det Dramatiske Selskab in [[Arendal]] ==
The Dramatic company of Arendal was founded in 1796 and performed in [[Comediehuset of Arendal]], a building that it owns. They are still active.

== Det Dramatiske Selskab in [[Drammen]] ==
Founded in 1801.

== Det Forenede Dramatiske Selskab in [[Trondheim]] ==
Founded in 1802 and performed in their own theatre building from 1816. In 1861, they gave the use of their theatre house to the first permanent theatre of the city, the [[Throndhjems Theater]].

== Det Dramatiske Selskab in [[Laurvig]] ==
Founded in 1810.

== Det Dramatiske Selskab in [[Fredrikshald, Norway|Fredrikshald]] ==
Founded in 1819.

== Det Dramatiske Selskab in [[Stavanger]] ==
Founded in 1823.

== Det Dramatiske Selskab in [[Egersund]] ==
Founded in 1825.

== Det Dramatiske Selskab in [[Christiansund]]==
Founded in 1830.

== Det Dramatiske Selskab in [[Tromsö]] ==
Founded in 1832.

'''Doreen Kartinyeri''' (3 February 1935&amp;ndash;2 December 2007) was an [[Ngarrindjeri]] elder and historian, born in the Australian state of [[South Australia]]. She played a key role in the [[Hindmarsh Island bridge controversy|Hindmarsh Bridge controversy]] and made many contributions to [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous]] activism.&lt;ref name="Melbourne"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.womenaustralia.info/leaders/biogs/WLE0509b.htm|title=Kartinyeri, Doreen - Woman - The Encyclopedia of Women and Leadership in Twentieth-Century Australia|last=Melbourne|first=The University of|website=www.womenaustralia.info|language=en-gb|access-date=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
&lt;!-- [[Image:Subject's earliest portrait.ext|thumb|right|Photo caption]] --&gt;
Doreen Kartinyeri was born on 3 February 1935, in the [[Raukkan, South Australia|Point MacLeay Aboriginal Reserve]] in South Australia to parents Thelma Kartinyeri and Oswald (Oscar) Kartinyeri.&lt;ref&gt;http://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/digitised_collections/the_koori_mail/418.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; She had two sisters, Doris and Nancy, and one brother, Ron. However, Doris was the only sibling that Doreen maintained contact with as Ron was in prison and Nancy died on the operating table when getting her tonsils out.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ia.anu.edu.au/biography/kartinyeri-doreen-maude-17798|title=Biography - Doreen Maude Kartinyeri - Indigenous Australia|website=ia.anu.edu.au|access-date=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doreen struggled with authority for most of her life. This struggle began when she was only a child, right after her mother died. Doreen and her newborn sister, Doris, were placed in different childcare institutions. In an interview on ABC radio with Mike Sexton in 2007, Doreen discussed this experience, saying: “I said I want to know where Doris is, what did you do with her, she's not in the home, someone took her. I didn't really know where she was, we didn't, I was only 13, just turned 13.”&lt;ref name="Stateline South Australia"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/sa/content/2006/s2114434.htm|title=Stateline South Australia|website=www.abc.net.au|access-date=28 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330000830/http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/sa/content/2006/s2114434.htm#|archive-date=30 March 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the interview continued, Doreen continued to reveal her passionate, stubborn and argumentative nature, describing herself as “a fiery girl who talked too much”. She mentioned a particular time when she was trying to see her sister, Doris. “All right,” Doreen said, “so I just kicked my shoes off, climbed the top of the wall, and said, ‘if you don't tell me I'm going to jump,’ so she told me where Doris was.”

===Education===
Doreen’s education began in her hometown, at the Raukkan Mission School. Doreen said that she did not like her teacher at this school because he was “too strict”. After the death of her mother, Doreen was, unwillingly, moved to the Salvation Army Home in [[Fullarton, South Australia|Fullarton]], on the condition that she would stay with her sister, Doris. Coincidentally, this was a lie - Doris did not go with Doreen to Fullarton,&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; but was instead sent to the Colebrook Home at [[Eden Hills, South Australia|Eden Hills]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/archived/firstperson/kick-the-tin-by-doris-kartinyeri/3232824 Kick the Tin by Doris Kartinyeri]ABC Radio National, 3 September 2007. Retrieved 15 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Doreen said that the conditions of this institution were “military style”, claiming that she was beaten on her first night for swearing. Doreen did not do well in school - she was rebellious, was punished often, performed poorly, often did not do work, and when she did, teachers accused her of cheating. During her time at school, Doreen found enjoyment in going to the pool and seeing boys. Often Doreen would get into mischief with the other nunga (Aboriginal) girls, and Doreen claimed that they were often the scapegoats for the white girls (herself especially). Later on, Doreen was expelled for getting into a fight with girls who were bullying a disabled girl. From there, she never continued her formal education but she did go on to win many honorary academic awards and has since received lots of praise for her academic work.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

===Domestic Employment===
After being expelled from Fullarton in 1949, Kartinyeri believed she was being sent back home to Raukkan; however, to her surprise she was sent to Joan and George Dunn’s house in the Adelaide Hills to work as a domestic servant for the next two years. After the initial shock had subdued, Doreen settled well into life at Adelaide Hills and came to love and respect Joan and George.

After her two years with the Dunns were complete, Doreen was offered another position, working for the Motterams, who lived in the Adelaide suburb of Kings Park. Having known the Motterams as friends of the Dunns and liking them, she accepted the job. While working there, Doreen did few physical or taxing tasks, describing her main purpose as keeping Mrs Motterham company which was easy because she had a “good sense of humour and was very easy going.”

At the age of 15, Doreen returned to Raukkan to care for her sick grandmother. She took up a position as a domestic servant for the superintendent of the mission, where her small wages went to supporting her grandparents who weren’t entitled to a pension because of their indigenous status.

At the age of 16, Doreen had her first experience as a full-time foster mother, taking care of her cousins and her cousin’s children. Finding motherhood exhausting, Doreen went back to working domestically, taking a job at the [[Maitland, South Australia|Maitland Hotel]]. Deciding that caring for grandmother back home was too stressful, Doreen left Raukkan and took up work sorting grapes at Barmera.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Hindmarsh Bridge==
Doreen played a significant and controversial role in the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Affair in the 1990s. All of her prior research sparked her passionate and argumentative side in 1993, when the South Australian State Government put forward a proposal to build a bridge between [[Hindmarsh Island]] and [[Goolwa, South Australia|Goolwa]]. Doreen quickly became a key figure in the movement against this proposal, saying that Hindmarsh Island was sacred land, particularly for Indigenous women, for reasons which her and her group would not disclose. In early 1994, Doreen’s group were successful in their application to the Federal Government to gain a heritage order to prohibit the bridge being built. However, in 1995, the Royal Commission conducted an investigation into Doreen’s movement and concluded that their “indigenous women” argument was fabricated. In addition, several Ngarrindjeri (the women native to Hindmarsh Island), said that they knew nothing of the spiritual importance that Doreen was talking about. Furthermore, in March 1996, the [[Howard Government]] re-approved the plans for the bridge and in the year 2000, it was built. During this time, there was lots of debate and discussion as to whether Doreen and her group were telling the truth or not. Doreen always maintained her passion and that what she was saying was true and as a result, she bore the brunt of the criticism and debate.&lt;ref name="Melbourne"/&gt;

Finally, in 2010, the South Australian government recognised the honesty of Doreen and her group, formally acknowledging that "women members of the Ngarrindjeri traditional owners were genuine in the mid-1990s when they said that the construction of the bridge would violate their most sacred beliefs." Years later, in an interview on ABC radio with Mike Sexton in 2007, Doreen described her position on this ordeal, saying: "If I was a destructive person I would have went and blown it up, and that's the truth. I would have went and blown it up, but I hate destroying things." Mike Sexton went on to say that "She was defiant to the end. A decade after the phrase 'secret women's business' entered the Australian vernacular, Doreen Kartinyeri maintained her rage against the bridge at Hindmarsh Island."&lt;ref name="Stateline South Australia"/&gt;

==Family==
===Relationship with parents===
Her mother Thelma Kartinyeri was classified as a 'quarter caste' Aboriginal woman. She was highly religious and wove baskets, knitted, crocheted and made clothes out of rags.

Thelma continued to help people and soon became a member of the Red Cross where she cooked food and sent it to needy families. Her youngest daughter died on the operating table whilst she was getting her tonsils taken out. Soon after this occurred, she had another daughter named Doris. Thelma died within a month of giving birth, due to complications following the birth. Doreen was only ten at the time, and had described the early death as one of the most traumatic experiences of her life.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Both mother and father had spent their days at Raukkan. Under the official classificatory system, Oswald (Oscar) Kartinyeri was considered as a 'full blood' Aboriginal. After the death of Thelma, the police took custody of Doris. He was described to be 'beside himself'. Doreen recalled her father travelling to Victoria to search for her. She also claimed that when he finally returned he was tired and dirty. As he grew old, Doreen and Terry had brought him up to live with them in Point Pearce. Oscar died in 1979 of a heart attack.

===Marriage===
Doreen married and had children with Terry Wanganeen, first meeting at Pearce Point when Doreen was visiting her Aunt Rose. Doreen became pregnant in 1954, leading to the decision for her and Terry to get married and move to Point Pearce together. Her relationship with Terry, who was heavily reliant on alcohol, and very violent and abusive when under the influence, was unstable. Both parties were hostile to one another, and their marriage was often unhappy. There was one particular instance when Terry threw a leg of lamb at the door because it was under-cooked, causing Doreen to become so angry that she broke a glass bottle and stabbed him in retaliation. Upon arrival to the hospital, authorities gave Doreen two choices for her consequence: she could either plead guilty to attempted murder or spend six weeks in a psychiatric hospital. She chose to be admitted into psychiatric care. When she returned, Terry’s attitude had drastically changed. However, Doreen still came to the conclusion that their marriage was effectively over, and she moved to Adelaide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Children===
Doreen became a full-time foster mother for her cousins at the age of 16. She also took care of her cousins’ children whilst she was pregnant. She described this experience as exhausting. She fell pregnant in 1954 and gave birth to a boy later that year in December. Her baby had died from an unknown illness at 7 months. She described his death as “one of the most traumatic experiences” in her life, the other being the early death of her mother. During baby Terry’s death, she fell pregnant again. Due to the death of her first born, she was terrified at the loss of another baby, so she considered inducing a miscarriage. From 1955 to 1699, she had given birth to six more sons and two daughters. She described the birth of her children as the “best thing that ever happened”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Projects==
She was living in Point Pierce with her family when she started to examine the histories and genealogies of the indigenous people in the Point Pierce and Point MacLeay area (and she discovered that most Aboriginals in this area were lost during colonisation. From this research, Doreen went on to write and successfully publish several books on the Indigenous people of this area, which led to her being awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Adelaide and given a job offer from the South Australian museum in their Aboriginal Family History Unit.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Awards==
In 1994, Doreen was named the South Australian Aboriginal of Year, and a year later she was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from the University of South Australia in recognition of her genealogical work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Death==
Kartinyeri died in the early morning hours of 2 December 2007, after battling stomach cancer and other illnesses. She was 72.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Dorothy Goebel''' (24 August 1898 – 12 March 1976) was an American [[historian]] of the United States.

==Life==
Dorothy Burne Goebel was born in [[Huntington, New York]] on 24 August 1898. She was a member of [[Phi Beta Kappa]] at [[Barnard College]] where she received her [[A.B.]] in 1920. Two years later she earned her [[M.A.]] from [[Columbia University]] and received her [[Ph.D.]] in 1926 from the same institution while serving as an assistant and lecturer at Barnard. That same year Goebel became an instructor at [[Hunter College]] in [[New York City]]. She was promoted to professor and served as chairman of the department from 1942 to 1948 and from 1961 to 1962, before retiring in 1963.

'''Gregory of Caergwent''' or '''Winchester''' ([[Floruit|fl.]] 1270) was a British monk and historian.

Gregory entered [[Gloucester Abbey]], according to his own account, on 29 October 1237, and is stated to have lived there for 60 years. He wrote the annals of his monastery from 682 to 1290, a work which has only survived in an epitome made by [[Lawrence Nowell]]. It consists almost entirely of obits and of notices relating to events which concerned his own monastery or the town of Gloucester; but in the early part it includes matter which is not contained in the ''Historia S. Petri Gloucestriæ'', printed in the [[Rolls Series]].&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Gregory of Caergwent|volume=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; His compilation is thought to have been a source for [[Walter Froucester]]'s later revision of the Gloucester chronicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=11453|title=Caer-went, Gregory of|first=Henry|last=Summerson|authorlink-Henry Summerson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Gregory of Karewent was [[dean of the arches]] in 1279; for the same year the livings of [[Tetbury]], Gloucestershire, and [[Blockley]], Worcestershire, are mentioned as vacant through the death of Gregory de Kerewent. A Philip de Kayrwent was prior of Gloucester in 1284, and Richard de Kayrwent was infirmarer in 1275 and 1284. Gregory has also been supposed to be the author of the ''Metrical Life'' of [[St. Hugh of Lincoln]]; but this is scarcely probable, since that poem appears to have been written before 1235. The Laudian MS., however, seems to contain a later edition, and ascribes the poem to a Gregory who had dedicated it to a [[bishop of Winchester]], and it is therefore possible that the writer may have been the reviser of the older poem.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

'''Haydée Santamaría Cuadrado''' ([[Villa Clara Province|Villa Clara]], December 30, 1922 – [[Havana]], July 28, 1980) was a Cuban revolutionary and politician, regarded as a heroine in post-revolutionary Cuba. She participated in the assault on [[Moncada Barracks]] in [[Santiago de Cuba]] on July 26, 1953, an action for which she was imprisoned along with [[Melba Hernández]]. She was a founding member of the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of Cuba]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://translatingcuba.com/the-suicide-of-haydee-santamaria-tania-diaz-castro/|title=The Suicide of Haydee Santamaria|last=Castro|first=Tania Diaz|date=12 August 2013|website=translatingcuba.com|publisher=|access-date=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the first women to join the PCC. She maintained a high position in its leadership throughout her life. Having participated in the attack on the Moncada Barracks, Haydée Santamaría is among a relatively small group of people who were involved in every phase of the [[Cuban Revolution]], from its inception to its fruition.

==Early life==
Haydée Santamaría was born to Spanish immigrants Joaquina Cuadrado and Abel Benigno Santamaría on December 30, 1922, in [[Encrucijada]], Cuba, on the Constancia sugar refinery. The eldest among five children, she and her siblings Aida, Abel, Aldo, and Ada were raised in a petite bourgeois family that emigrated from [[Galicia, Spain|Galicia]], [[Spain]] to [[Cuba]] in the area formerly known as Las Villas Province. She only attended school until the sixth grade, which was not uncommon due to poverty and customs regarding gender; however she repeated the sixth grade 3-4 times before leaving school, exhibiting an appreciation of reading and learning.&lt;ref&gt;Randall, Margaret. Haydée Santamaría, Cuban Revolutionary: She Led by Transgression. Duke University Press Books, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In school, she was introduced to important writers, among them [[Jose Marti]]—an important figure of Cuban literature and a national symbol of independence.

After trying to become a nurse and working as a teacher for a short time, Haydée Santamaría was able to leave the trappings of her conservative family behind, joining her brother, Abel Santamaría, in [[Havana, Cuba]] in the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Randall, Margaret. Haydée Santamaría, Cuban Revolutionary: She Led by Transgression. Duke University Press Books, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It was in Havana at this time that she started meeting Abel’s comrades, chief among them [[Fidel Castro]]. Haydée Santamaría and [[Melba Hernandez]] were the only two women to directly participate in the assault on the Moncada Barracks of July 26, 1953. Her roles during, leading up to, and following July 26, 1953 included acquiring and transporting weapons, being involved in the organization of the revolutionary organization of the [[July 26th Movement]], as well as helping to assemble the urban uprising of November 30, 1956 in Santiago de Cuba alongside [[Frank País]] and [[Celia Sánchez]].&lt;ref&gt;Maclean, Betsy. Haydée Santamaría. Melbourne: Ocean Press, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revolutionary and post-revolutionary activity==
During her imprisonment after the Moncada assault, the guards allegedly brought her the bleeding eye of her brother, [[Abel Santamaría]] and threatened to tear out the other. They also brought her the mangled testicle of her then fiancé, Boris Luis Santa Coloma. Her response was: “If you did that to them and they didn't talk, much less will I.” Both Abel and Boris died after the assault of the Moncada Barracks. 
After her release she helped to found the [[26th of July Movement]], joining the guerrilla forces led by [[Fidel Castro]] and [[Che Guevara]] in the [[Sierra Maestra]] mountains. The speech [[History Will Absolve Me]] was converted into a written manifesto by Fidel Castro using lemon juice to write between the lines of letters during his imprisonment after the assault on the Moncada Barracks. The manifesto was disseminated by Haydée Santamaría and Melba Hernandez after their release from prison. They assumed responsibility for smuggling out the speech in sections, raising money to print them, and distributing ten thousand copies throughout Cuba with the help of [[Natalia Revuelta]] and [[Lidia Castro]], building the mythic reputation and de facto leadership of Fidel Castro.&lt;ref&gt;Shayne, Julie D. The Revolution Question: Feminisms in El Salvador, Chile, and Cuba. Rutgers University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 4, 1958, Fidel Castro established the Mariana Grajales Platoon, an all-women’s battalion for the rebel army, and Fidel Castro’s personal security detail.&lt;ref&gt;Puebla, Teté, and Mary-Alice Waters. Marianas in Combat: Teté Puebla &amp; the Mariana Grajales Women's Platoon in Cuba's Revolutionary War, 1956-58. New York: Pathfinder, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Haydée Santamaría was a member of the Marianas during the war, fighting in the mountains of the [[Sierra Maestra]].

After the [[Cuban Revolution]] in 1959, she founded the cultural institution [[Casa de las Américas]], and remained its director for two decades. This was a bold institution that gave voice to the work of Latin American dissidents, and it continues today. As well as literature, the institution brought innovative music, painting and theatre to the Cuban people. Haydée Santamaría’s unique role within the Casa de las Americas allowed her to practice internationalism in the face of the [[United States embargo against Cuba]], creating a space for artists and intellectuals from around the world to meet and collaborate in Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;Randall, Margaret. Haydée Santamaría, Cuban Revolutionary: She Led by Transgression. Duke University Press Books, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Her support of artistry and her dedication to the spirit of revolution helped her foster many intimate relationships with different artists. It was with the exposure at the Casa de las Americas, and support from Santamaría, that [[Silvio Rodriguez]] was able to start the Nueva Trova "New Song Movement" ([[Nueva canción]]) in post-revolutionary Cuba. In an earlier letter written by Ernesto “Che” Guevara to Haydée Santamaría, he alludes to her cultural achievements, and then chooses to recall a specific incident in the mountains of the Sierra Maestra:
"I see that you have become a literati with the power of creation, but I will confess that how I most like you is on that day in the New Year, with all your fuses blown and firing cannons on all sides.”&lt;ref&gt;Maclean, Betsy. Haydée Santamaría. Melbourne: Ocean Press, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
Her commitment to the cultural development of Cuba allowed her to meet many new and interesting people, but she was to be plagued by the tragic losses of her loved ones to the end of her life.

==Personal life and death==
Depression ran in her family and it severely affected her to the end of her life. Often she spent days in bed while in depressive episodes. She eventually married [[Armando Hart]] and had two children with him, Cuban writer [[Celia Hart]] and her brother Abel Hart. They also took in many children and managed their own type of orphanage.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.margaretrandall.org/Haydee-Santamaria-Cuban-Revolutionary-She-Led-by-Transgression-291|title=Haydée Santamaría, Cuban Revolutionary: She Led by Transgression|last=Randall|first=Margret|date=22 January 2015|website=www.margretrandall.org|publisher=|access-date=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two decades of marriage, Armando and Haydée ended up separated. Haydée Santamaría committed suicide at the age of fifty-seven in the home she and her children shared on July 28, 1980, two days after the 27th anniversary of the attack on the Moncada Barracks. The fact of her suicide was problematic within Cuba and, some have speculated, the reason she was not mourned in the [[Plaza de la Revolución]], but rather was given the burial of an ordinary citizen in [[Havana, Cuba]]. Haydée Santamaría’s death followed six months after the death of her close friend Celia Sanchez from lung cancer, and several months after a car accident left her in chronic pain.&lt;ref&gt;Randall, Margaret. Haydée Santamaría, Cuban Revolutionary: She Led by Transgression. Duke University Press Books, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The events of the Cuban Revolution left an indelible mark on her, causing her to lose many people to whom she was close, and ultimately contributing to the lifelong depression from which she suffered. In a letter published by Casa de las Americas in 1968, she wrote to [[Che Guevara]] after his death:
"Fourteen years ago I saw the most intensely beloved human beings die—I think that I have already lived too much. The sun is not as beautiful, I don’t feel pleasure in seeing the palm trees. Sometimes, like now, in spite of enjoying life so much, knowing that it is worth opening one’s eyes every morning if only for those two things, I have the desire to keep them closed, like you."&lt;ref&gt;Maclean, Betsy. Haydée Santamaría. Melbourne: Ocean Press, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Irmen culture''' is an indigenous Late [[Bronze Age]] culture of animal breeders in the [[steppe]] and [[forest steppe]] area of the [[Ob river]] middle course, north of [[Altai Mountains|Altai]] in western [[Siberia]], dated to around the 9th to 8th centuries BCE. Monuments of this advanced bronze-producing culture include numerous settlements and [[kurgan]] cemeteries, the culture was named after Irmen kurgan cemetery now flooded by [[Novosibirsk reservoir]].&lt;ref&gt;''Irmen culture''. Archaeology and Ethnography Institute, Siberian Branch of Russian Academy of Sciences http://www.sati.archaeology.nsc.ru/encyc_p/term.html?act=list&amp;term=766 (''In Russian'')&lt;/ref&gt; Irmen culture was discovered and described by N.L.Chlenova in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Chlenova N.L., ''Dating of Irmen culture''//Chronology and cultural affiliation problems of archaeological sites in Western Siberia, Tomsk, 1970, pp. 133-149 (''In Russian'')&lt;/ref&gt;

Irmen culture period is noted for [[Human migration|migrationary waves]] in two directions, in the beginning of 1st millennium BCE from south from the [[Karasuk culture]], and later in the 1st millennium BCE of northern tribes notable for their cross-decorated [[ceramic]]s. Migrations raised military tensions, noted in emergence of first fortified settlements with [[moats]] and [[Defensive wall|ramparts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sati.archaeology.nsc.ru/encyc_p/term.html?act=list&amp;term=766 ''Irmen culture'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
The mainstay of the Irmen economy was extensive [[animal husbandry]]. Stationary houses of Irmen people were large, sometimes exceeding {{convert|100|m2|abbr=on}}. Villages had several such large dwellings. Next to houses were found large deposits of ash.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sati.archaeology.nsc.ru/encyc_p/term.html?act=list&amp;term=766 ''Irmen culture'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archeology==
Irmen people buried their deceased by inhumation in kurgan cemeteries, with up to 17 predominantly oriented SW graves in a single kurgan, bodies in crouched position, except when inhumation was conducted after ground thawed or bodies were first exposed, and bone remains were mixed. Kurgans were encircled by sometimes rectangular trenches open at the entrance, deposits include vessels and animal bones of funeral feasts. Individual graves were framed with wooden logs, covered by logs laid across. Accompanying inventory furnished ceramic vessels with food, darts with bronze heads, knives, deceased wore bronze jewelry ornaments of earrings, pendants, bead necklaces. Irmen dishes are of household and finery type with geometric ornament and rounded bottoms, finery dishes have mostly flat bottom. Ornamentation of finery dishes is much closer to the Karasuk vessels than of the household ceramics, but ornamentation is similar for both groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sati.archaeology.nsc.ru/encyc_p/term.html?act=list&amp;term=766 ''Irmen culture'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic composition==
In general, migration wave of [[Andronovo]] cultural-historical community tribes, where their physical type (anthropologically ascended to the Southern Eurasian Anthropological Formation), conflated with local tribes (anthropologically ascended to the Northern Eurasian Anthropological Formation) and went on ethnogenesis of the Andronoid cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Chikisheva T.A., ''"Dynamics of anthropological differentiation"'', section Conclusions&lt;/ref&gt; The [[phenotype]] features of Irmen people are distinctive, they developed from the local [[Eneolithic]] culture, in its formation participated [[Caucasoid]] population of [[Eastern Mediterranean]] type, migrants from [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.althisto.ru/bronzovyiy-vek-altaya/stratigraficheskie-nablyudeniya.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Medicine Crow''' (October 27, 1913 – April 3, 2016) was a [[Tribal chief|war chief]], author, and [[historian]] of the [[Crow Nation]] of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. His writings on Native American history and reservation culture are considered seminal works, but he is best known for his writings and lectures concerning the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]] in 1876. He received the [[Bronze Star Medal]] and the [[Légion d'honneur]] for service during World War II, and the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 2009.

He was the last surviving war chief of the Crow Nation and the last living Plains Indian war chief. He was a founding member of the [[Traditional Circle of Indian Elders &amp; Youth|Traditional Circle of Indian Elders and Youth]].&lt;ref name="Centenary"&gt;{{cite news|title = PIM 'founder,' war hero Medicine Crow turns 100|newspaper = [[Cody Enterprise]]|publisher = Sage Publishing|date = October 30, 2013|url = http://www.codyenterprise.com/news/people/article_8ef043b8-41a4-11e3-888e-001a4bcf887a.html|accessdate = November 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Joseph Medicine Crow (his Crow name meant High Bird) was born in 1913 on the [[Crow Indian Reservation]] near [[Lodge Grass, Montana]], to Amy Yellowtail and Leo Medicine Crow.&lt;ref name ="New York Times Obituary"&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/05/us/joseph-medicine-crow-tribal-war-chief-and-historian-dies-at-102.html |first =Mike |last =McPhate |title =Joseph Medicine Crow, Tribal War Chief and Historian, Dies at 102 |work =New York Times |date =April 4, 2016 |accessdate =April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Crow [[kinship]] system was [[matrilineal]], he was considered born for his mother's people, and gained his social status from that line. Property and hereditary positions were passed through the maternal line. Chief Medicine Crow, Leo's father, was a highly distinguished and honored chief in his own right, who at the age of 22 became a war chief. He set a standard for aspiring warriors and was his son's inspiration.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

His maternal step-grandfather, [[White Man Runs Him]], was a scout for US General [[George Armstrong Custer]] and an eyewitness to the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]] in 1876.&lt;ref name="Ken Burn's The War"&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.pbs.org/thewar/detail_5177.htm |publisher = PBS | title = Joe Medicine Crow| accessdate = April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Joe Medicine Crow's cousin is [[Pauline Small]], the first woman elected to office in the [[Crow Nation|Crow Tribe of Indians]].

==Education==
[[File:Whitemanrunshim.jpg|left|175px|thumb|[[White Man Runs Him]].]]
When he was young, Medicine Crow heard direct oral testimony about the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]] in 1876 from his step-grandfather, [[White Man Runs Him]], who had been a scout for General [[George Armstrong Custer]].&lt;ref name=Museum/&gt;

Beginning in 1929, when he was in eighth grade, Medicine Crow attended [[Bacone College]] in [[Muskogee, Oklahoma]], which also had preparatory classes for students of high school age. He studied until he completed an [[Associate of Arts]] degree in 1936. He went on to study sociology and psychology for his bachelor's degree from [[Linfield College]] in 1938.&lt;ref name ="LBHC Library"/&gt; He earned a master's degree in [[anthropology]] from the [[University of Southern California]] in Los Angeles in 1939; he was the first member of the Crow tribe to obtain a master's degree.&lt;ref name=Museum&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.custermuseum.org/medicinecrowarticles.htm| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080730030527/http://www.custermuseum.org/medicinecrowarticles.htm | archivedate = July 30, 2008 | accessdate = April 4, 2016 | title = Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow| publisher = Custer Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; His thesis, ''The Effects of European Culture Contact upon the Economic, Social, and Religious Life of the Crow Indians'', has become a well-respected work about Crow culture.&lt;ref name=worldwisdom&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwisdom.com/public/authors/Joe-Medicine-Crow.aspx|title=Joe Medicine Crow: Life and Work|website=www.worldwisdom.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began work toward a doctorate, and by 1941 had completed the required coursework. He did not complete his Ph.D., due to the United States' entry into [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=Museum/&gt;

Medicine Crow taught at [[Chemawa Indian School]] for a year in 1941, then took a defense industry job in the shipyards of [[Bremerton, Washington]] in 1942.&lt;ref name ="LBHC Library"/&gt;

==World War II==
After spending the latter half of 1942 working in the naval ship yards in [[Bremerton, Washington]], Medicine Crow joined the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] in 1943.&lt;ref name ="LBHC Library"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://lib.lbhc.edu/index.php?q=node/53 |publisher = Little Big Horn College Library| title = Joseph Medicine Crow Collection Inventory| accessdate = April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a scout in the [[103rd Infantry Division (United States)|103rd Infantry Division]], and fought in [[World War II]]. Whenever he went into battle, he wore his [[Body painting|war paint]] (two red stripes on his arms) beneath his uniform and a sacred yellow painted eagle feather, provided by a "sundance" medicine man, beneath his helmet.&lt;ref name="Ken Burn's The War"/&gt;

Medicine Crow completed all four tasks required to become a war chief: [[Counting coup|touching an enemy without killing him]] (counting coup), taking an enemy's weapon, leading a successful war party, and stealing an enemy's horse.&lt;ref name=worldwisdom/&gt; He touched a living enemy soldier and disarmed him after turning a corner and finding himself face to face with a young German soldier:

{{quote|The collision knocked the German's weapon to the ground. Mr. Crow lowered his own weapon and the two fought hand-to-hand. In the end Mr. Crow got the best of the German, grabbing him by the neck and choking him. He was going to kill the German soldier on the spot when the man screamed out 'momma.' Mr. Crow then let him go.&lt;ref name="Ken Burn's The War"/&gt;}}

He also led a successful war party and stole fifty horses owned by the [[Nazi]] [[SS]] from a German camp singing a traditional Crow honor song as he rode off.&lt;ref name ="whitehouse.gov"&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-names-medal-freedom-recipients| title = President Obama Names Medal of Freedom Recipients | date = July 30, 2009 | accessdate = March 29, 2017 | publisher = White House}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Economist2016&gt;{{cite journal |title=War songs of the Plains  |url=https://www.economist.com/news/obituary/21696906-all-his-life-he-was-bridge-between-two-worlds-lecturing-need-combine-best |journal=The Economist |volume=419 |issue=8985 |page=78 |date=April 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medicine Crow is the last member of the Crow tribe to become a war chief. He was interviewed and appeared in the 2007 Ken Burns [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] series ''[[The War (documentary)|The War]],'' describing his World War II service.&lt;ref name="Ken Burn's The War"/&gt; Filmmaker [[Ken Burns]] said, "The story of Joseph Medicine Crow is something I've wanted to tell for 20 years."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://opinionjournal.com/la/?id=110010622 |first =Brendan |last=Miniter| title= Ken Burns Returns to War| work=Wall Street Journal Opinion| date= September 19, 2007| accessdate = September 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tribal spokesman==
After serving in the Army, Medicine Crow returned to the [[Crow Agency, Montana|Crow Agency]]. In 1948, he was appointed tribal historian and anthropologist.&lt;ref name ="NPS"&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.nps.gov/bica/learn/historyculture/joseph-medicine-crow.htm | title = Joseph Medicine Crow | publisher = National Park Service| accessdate = April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked for the BIA beginning in 1951.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} He served as a board member or officer on the Crow Central Education Commission almost continuously since its inception in 1972.&lt;ref name ="LBHC Library"/&gt; In 1999, he addressed the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name ="whitehouse.gov"/&gt;

Medicine Crow was a frequent guest speaker at [[Little Big Horn College]] and the Little Big Horn Battlefield Museum. He also was featured in several documentaries about the battle, because of his family's associated oral history. He wrote a script "that has been used at the reenactment of the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn reenactment#Custer's Last Stand Reenactment|Battle of Little Big Horn]] held every summer in [[Hardin, Montana|Hardin]] since 1965."&lt;ref name = "montanakids"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Joseph Medicine Crow | work = Montanakids | accessdate = March 28, 2013 | year = 2007 | url = http://montanakids.com/cool_stories/Famous_Montanans/Crow.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medicine Crow was a founding member of Little Bighorn College and of the [[Buffalo Bill Historical Center]] in [[Cody, Wyoming]] beginning in 1976. He was given an honorary Emeritus in the recent years.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

As historian, Medicine Crow was the "keeper of memories" of his tribe. He preserved the stories and photographs of his people in an archive in his house and garage.&lt;ref name=Economist2016 /&gt;  His books include ''Crow Migration Story'', ''Medicine Crow'', the ''Handbook of the Crow Indians Law and Treaties'', ''Crow Indian Buffalo Jump Techniques'', and ''From the Heart of Crow Country''. He also wrote a book for children entitled ''Brave Wolf and the Thunderbird''.

[[File:John Adam Cramb.png|thumb|John Adam Cramb c.1913]]
'''John Adam Cramb''' (4 May 1862 – October 1913) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] historian and fervent patriot.  He published non-fiction works under his own name, and fiction under the pseudonym of R. A. Revermont.

Cramb was born at [[Denny, Falkirk]] in Scotland, on 4 May 1862. On leaving school he went to [[University of Glasgow]], where he graduated in 1885, taking 1st Class Honours in Classics.  In the same year he was appointed to the Luke Fellowship in English Literature, he also studied at [[University of Bonn]].  He subsequently travelled in continental Europe, and in 1887 he married the third daughter of the late Mr. Edward W. Selby Lowndes of Winslow, and left one son.  From 1888 to 1890 he was Lecturer in Modern History at [[Queen Margaret College (Glasgow)|Queen Margaret College]], Glasgow.

Settling in London in 1890 he contributed several articles to the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'', and also occasional reviews to periodicals.  For many years he was an examiner for the [[Civil Service Commission]].  In 1892 he was appointed Lecturer and in 1893 Professor of Modern History at [[Queen's College, London]], where he lectured until his death.  He was also an occasional lecturer on military history at the Staff College, Camberley, and at York, Chatham, and other centres.  In London he gave private courses on history, literature and philosophy.  His last series of lectures was delivered in February and March, 1913, the subject being the relations between England and Germany.  In response to many requests he was engaged in preparing these lectures for publication when, in October 1913, he died.

'''Amy Maud Bodkin''' (1875 in [[Chelmsford]], [[Essex]] – 1967 in [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire]]) was an English [[classical scholar]], writer on [[mythology]], and [[literary critic]]. She is best known for her 1934 book ''Archetypal Patterns in Poetry: Psychological Studies of Imagination'' (London: Oxford University Press). It is generally taken to be a major work in applying the theories of [[Carl Jung]] to literature. 

Bodkin's other main works are ''The Quest for Salvation in an Ancient and a Modern Play'' (London and New York: Oxford University Press, 1941) and ''Studies of Type-Images in Poetry, Religion and Philosophy'' (London and New York: Oxford University Press, 1951). She lectured at [[Homerton College, Cambridge]] from 1902 to 1914.

==''Archetypal Patterns in Poetry''==

In ''Archetypal Patterns in Poetry'', Bodkin applies [[Jung]]'s theory of the collective unconscious to poetry, discovering a deep-seated primitive meaning behind recurring poetic images, symbols, and situations. She tried, as Boswell (1936: 553) quotes, "to bring psychological analysis and reflection to bear upon the imaginative experience communicated by great poetry, and to examine those forms or patterns in which the universal forces of our nature there find objectification." 

Among the forms or archetypal patterns Bodkin presented, according to Boswell, may be included: the “[[Oedipus complex]]," the "[[Reincarnation|rebirth]] archetype," the "archetype of [[Heaven]] and [[Hell]]," and "images of the [[Devil]], the [[Hero]], and God" (Boswell 1936: 553). Boswell goes on to write that Bodkin's "analyses and presentation are excellent; but the explanations, where any are attempted, seem inadequate to account for some very significant facts which the analyses have brought out" (Boswell 1936: 553).

On the other hand, Willcock (1936: 92) states that "the final impression left by Bodkin's book is one of unusual sensitiveness in reading and sincerity in recording experience." In addition, "Bodkin's pursuit of primordial symbols serves her determination to show, at least from one angle of approach, what poetry is and how it works. She holds herself back from slipping down the easy slope of paraphrase and prose meanings; neither does she drift into allegories and typifiyings" (Willcock 1936: 91).

Finally, Hooke (1935: 176) called ''Archetypal Patterns in Poetry'', "a distinguished book; distinguished by acute reasoning, wide and deep learning, and a fine sensitiveness to poetic values. It is a courageous and, to a great extent, successful attempt to apply the technique of [[analytical psychology]] to the cloudy and elusive emotional patterns brought up into consciousness by the magic of great poetry.”

The texts Bodkin discusses in ''Archetypal Patterns in Poetry'' include those of [[Virgil]], [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[John Milton|Milton]], and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] (Hooke 1935: 176; Boswell 1936: 553; Willcock 1936: 91); [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] and [[Euripides]] (Boswell 1936: 553); and [[Aeschylus]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], [[T. S. Eliot]], as well as the [[Gospel|Christian Gospels]] (Hooke 1935: 177).

===Discussion===
At work in the poems of Milton and Aeschylus, for example, as well as in Shelley's ''Prometheus Unbound'', is a fatherlike figure that Bodkin identifies as the '''Divine Despot''' (Bodkin 1934: 250; cited in Allgaier 1973: 1036).

The Divine Despot seems to be involved in the '''Heaven-and-Hell archetype''', the kernel of which contains a "vital aspect" that is both positive and negative, and appears in space "as an image of loveliness with an ever attendant threatening shadow, a desolation beneath or around it" (Bodkin 1934: 122; cited in Shmiefsky 1967: 721).

Heaven, Hell, and the Divine Despot may descend to earth and have offspring in the '''Hamlet theme''' which involves a child's "ambivalent attitude" toward its parents and off of which are spun such variants as Oedipus and Orestes (Bodkin 1934: 11–15, cited in Williams 1973: 221), or all may remain at the divine level, as in the situation with Milton's God and Satan, or Aeschylus's Zeus and Prometheus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The antagonism between Prometheus and Zeus can partly be traced to a very general psychological tension, between the instinct of self-expression and rebellion against group values, and the opposite instinct to sustain those group values, and to merge personal claims in a greater power. Bodkin shows how Milton's Satan represents both these psychological forces at different times. Sometimes he is the heroic antagonist of tyranny, and sometimes a devilish enemy of group values, conceived to reside in the protection of God. In the mind of the reader there are these forces, sometimes inherited from very ancient times, and they may determine his response to the poetry quite independently of his conscious thinking about God, fate, and morality. As in the mind of poet or percipient the character of Satan alternates, so inversely the character of God must alternate too. In the Prometheus of Aeschylus are remembered dim fears that progress is wrong, inimical to the group; but also there are present instincts of self-assertion and rebellion. These instincts are connected with the infantile wishes and fears which still lurk in our minds. A poet may 'recall an infantile type of religious fear,' suggesting 'the Freudian doctrine of the [[father complex]] or ''imago'', in relation to God.' 'The Freudian school of psychologists has asserted that the religious life represents a dramatisation on the cosmic plane of emotions which arose in the child's relation to his parents'&amp;nbsp;" (Knight 1938: 53–54; citing Bodkin 1934: 191, 232 ff., 239, 242).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Complicating matters is the '''Rebirth archetype''' which, like the Heaven-and-Hell archetype, also involves a "vital aspect" that is simultaneously positive and negative, but which appears, not static, but rather "as a passage in time, from life to desolate death and beyond, to life renewed" (Bodkin 1934: 122; cited in Shmiefsky 1967: 721). In addition, there is a "'''night-journey stage''' within the pattern of Rebirth" (Bodkin 1934: 136; cited in Shmiefsky 1967: 735).

Rebirth is

&lt;blockquote&gt;"a movement, downward, or inward toward the earth's centre, or a cessation of movement—a physical change which … appears also as a transition toward severed relation with the outer world, and, it may be, toward disintegration and death. This element in the pattern is balanced by a movement upward and outward—an expansion or outburst of activity, a transition toward redintegration and life-renewal" (Bodkin 1934: 54; cited in Morgan 1971: 42).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
{{wiktionary|redintegration}}
Rebirth starts with frustration and has as its goal transcendence; between these two extends the "process of growth, or 'creative evolution,' in the course of which the constituent factors are transformed" (Bodkin 1934: 72; cited in Morgan 1971: 42).

Heaven, Hell, and Rebirth are related: "Heaven is mainly a garden in spring, Hell the scape of winter or a desert, and Rebirth an April violet" (Shmiefsky 1967: 721). Milton's ''Paradise Lost'' is an example of this interrelation of the two archetypes, where Bodkin claims that "it is as though the poet's feeling divined the relation of the concepts of Heaven and Hell to the images of spring's beauty and of the darkness under the earth whence beauty comes forth and to which it returns" (Bodkin 1963: 97; cited in Shmiefsky 1967: 735). Further interpatterning of the two archetypes, spatially and temporally, occurs when Satan emerges "upwards from his tremendous cavern below the realm of Chaos, to waylay the flower-like Eve in her walled Paradise and make her an inmate of his Hell, even as Pluto rose from beneath the earth to carry off Proserpine from her flowery meadow" (Bodkin 1934: 97–98; cited in Rosenman 1978: 12)

Above everything, the '''Star image''' "shines clear, for a moment between the opposites, between man and woman, between day and night; [it] fades and returns like the bloom of a flower, as the world's rhythms sweep on" (Bodkin 1934: 296; cited in Shmiefsky 1967: 725).

==Other readings, other writings==

===Letters and articles===
Bodkin did not limit herself to the classics nor to Jung, however. She was also an astute reader of other important philosophers of the time. The July 1938 issue of ''Philosophy'', for example, published a letter Bodkin wrote to the editor concerning [[George Santayana|Santayana]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt; "It seems to me that many philosophers are rightly realizing—to-day perhaps more than ever before—that our clearest renderings of reality, whether couched in austere conceptual terms or variegated with abundant imagery, may with equal justice be described as myths—myths in the sense of partial renderings of some human, historically conditioned standpoint of what necessarily transcends human grasp" (Bodkin 1938: 379).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While the same journal's issue of July 1940 presented this statement by her:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“In my own thought I have realized the importance of [[R. G. Collingwood|Professor Collingwood]]'s principle. The process he describes of being 'burdened' with a problem that begins as a 'formless disturbance' and takes shape gradually in urgent questions, is a matter of the emotional no less than of the intellectual life. Those of us who genuinely hold liberal or democratic principles hold them, I would maintain, neither as habit nor as merely 'cerebral,' unemotional thought. Rather they are involved in our intellectual and emotional struggle with problems so deeply rooted within our individual and social life as to be virtually religious in character" (Bodkin 1940: 335).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bodkin also grappled with the ideas of [[I. A. Richards]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead|A. N. Whitehead]], examining the latter's concept of the "Divine persuasion" in a 1945 article entitled "Physical Agencies and the Divine Persuasion" and the former's understanding of "truth in poetry" in an article of the same name, which concludes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“As I clarify, through reflective analysis of imaginative communication, my intellectual references to those social objects—states and forces entering our common life—which the poet may portray through heroic figures, or name God, [[Devil]], [[Heaven]], [[Hell]], I am at the same time ordering my emotional attitudes toward those objects. The gain which has come to those of us whom Dr. Richards's writings have stimulated to keener interest in the attitudes harmonized by poetry is enhanced, it seems to me, when we restore to those attitudes and references which Richards separates the unity claimed for them by the [[Philosophy of Organism]]" (Bodkin 1935: 472).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Bodkin's later books===
[[Christianity|Christian themes]], along with those from "the [[Eastern religion|great religions of the East]]" (cited in Hayward 1952), came to dominate Bodkin's later thought and writings, which may also have been influenced by her readings of [[Martin Buber]], [[Gilbert Ryle]], and [[Karl Jaspers]] (among others), as her 1944 letter to the editor of ''Philosophy'', "Our Knowledge of One Another," and a 1956 article in the same journal, "Knowledge and Faith," seem to show. The title of Bodkin's short (54 pages) book, ''The Quest for Salvation in an Ancient and a Modern Play'', substantiates one of her chief concerns. This book compares Aeschylus's Eumenides with themes in T. S. Eliot's ''The Family Reunion'', the "modern play" which Bodkin had reviewed two years earlier, in May 1939.

As for Bodkin's last major work, ''Studies of Type-Images in Poetry, Religion and Philosophy'', Carré (1952: 285) states that it "comprises loose meditations on religious themes, straying through a range of cloudy ideas and culling bunches of quotations from novelists, playwrights, poets and prophets." The "basic question" that ''Studies of Type-Images in Poetry, Religion and Philosophy'' explores was "suggested to the author by [[Martin Buber]]," while "the answer, insofar as any answer can be given, is derived from certain philosophical implications of Carl Jung's psychological studies" (Hayward 1952: 225). In this book, Bodkin tried "to understand and make some reasonable discrimination and choice among the type-images which are actually working among us and openly available to us in literary, ritualistic, or philosophical forms" (Hayward 1952: 225). 

Hayward also states that Bodkin criticised "[[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s critique of religion on the grounds that he knew only [[Zeus]] or [[Yahweh|Jehovah]], the paternal-authoritarian type of God, a God who never underwent birth, suffering, death, as did [[Dionysus|Dionysos]] or Jesus" (Hayward 1952: 226). In addition, Aldrich (1953: 153) points out that ''Studies of Type-Images in Poetry, Religion and Philosophy'' is "a sequel and supplement" to ''Archetypal Patterns in Poetry'' and that the theme of both books is "the current widespread idea that we have not wholly awakened out of the 'dream' of mythic consciousness, whose symbols are still exploited in great poetry and religion and even metaphysics." 

Furthermore, "both books were written under the spell mainly of C. J. Jung, but also of [[Albert Schweitzer]] and [[Plato]]. Both use introspective, subjectivist methods of [[depth psychology]], attempting to disclose or make explicit the 'archetypal patterns' of prelogical experience and culture" (Aldrich 1953: 153).

Some writers felt that the "type-image" of Bodkin's last book was a more fruitful concept than the "archetype" of her first. For example, Walter Sutton published an essay in 1960 which

&lt;blockquote&gt;"discusses C. G. Jung's concept of 'archetype' as it was used by various critics especially by Maud Bodkin. The conclusion of the discussion is to the effect that instead of 'archetype' we should rather use the concept of 'type-image' as Maud Bodkin did lately. We avoid thereby the dubious mythological and psychological connotations of the term: archetype—since the term ‘type-image’ admits the possibility of a historical succession of types without implying the existence of a unique prototype supposed to be the underlying substratum of all literary forms referring to a primordial ‘myth.’ The proposed new term retains the idea of uniformity and recurrence inherent in the idea of ‘archetype’ but makes us conceive literature as a culturally conditioned phenomenon valued not because of mythical uniformity but because of appreciation of historically varying originality” (Rieser 1962: 109).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Michael Mayr''' (10 April 1864 – 21 May 1922) was an Austrian politician, who served as [[Chancellor of Austria]] in the [[First Austrian Republic]] from July 1920 to June 1921. He was a member of the [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]], and by profession a [[historian]].

==Life==
Mayr was born in [[Adlwang]] in [[Upper Austria]], the son of a farmer. He studied history and geography at the [[University of Vienna]] and earned a [[doctorate]] in 1890. From 1897 through 1920 he served as director of the [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] State Archives (''Tiroler Landesarchiv''). In 1900 he became a Professor of Modern History at the [[University of Innsbruck]].

Mayr's political career began under the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]], when from 1907 to 1911 he was a member of the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Imperial Council]] (''Reichsrat'') legislature and from 1908 to 1914 of the Tyrolean ''[[Landtag]]'' assembly. With the breakup of the Empire at the end of [[World War I]], Mayr was in 1919/20 a delegate for the Christian Social Party to the [[Austrian Constitutional Assembly election, 1919|National Assembly]] drafting the new [[Constitution of Austria]]. State Chancellor (''Staatskanzler'') [[Karl Renner]] appointed him a state secretary in his [[grand coalition]] government on 17 October 1919.

After Renner's cabinet finally collapsed, Mayr on 7 July 1920 succeeded him as acting "director of the state chancellery", as part of an interim government of his Christian Social Party and the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democratic Labor Party]] (SDAP). Renner himself remained [[Federal Ministry for European and International Affairs|State Secretary for Foreign Affairs]] until the Social Democrats left the Austrian government after their disappointing outcome in the [[Austrian legislative election, 1920|Austrian legislative election]] of October 17, to remain in opposition until the end of [[World War II]]. From 10 November 1920, with the Constitution's coming into force, the cabinet formed the [[Austrian Federal Government]], with Mayr as Federal Chancellor (''Bundeskanzler''). 

On 20 November 1920, the newly established [[National Council (Austria)|National Council]] parliament elected Mayr Chancellor of a Christian Social minority government. He also remained Foreign Minister of the country, until the cabinet resigned on 1 June 1921, in response to a referendum that was called in [[Styria]] proposing that the state leave Austria and join [[Weimar Republic|Germany]] contrary to the 1919 [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]].

Mayr was succeeded as chancellor by non-partisan [[Johann Schober]], backed by the Christian-Socials and the [[Greater German People's Party]]. He died about a year later in [[Waldneukirchen]].

'''Michael Perelman''' (born October 1, 1939) is an [[Americans|American]] [[Economics|economist]] and [[Economic history|economic historian]], currently professor of [[economics]] at [[California State University, Chico]]. Perelman has written 19 books, including ''Railroading Economics'', ''Manufacturing Discontent'', ''The Perverse Economy'', and ''The Invention of Capitalism''.&lt;ref&gt;Bailes, John &amp; Cihan Aksan.

==Biography==
A student of economics at the [[University of Michigan]] and [[San Francisco State College]], Perelman earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] in [[agricultural economics]] from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1971,&lt;ref name = "CS Economics Department"&gt;[http://www.csuchico.edu/econ/faculty/perelman.shtml Michael Perelman, Ph.D., CV], Economics Department, University of California, Chico (Retrieved 21 March 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; under supervision of [[George Kuznets]].&lt;ref&gt;http://michaelperelman.wordpress.com/2007/03/31/what-is-the-matter-with-empirical-economics-freak-freakonomics-again/&lt;/ref&gt; Perelman writes that he was drawn away from the "framework of conventional economics," noticing that the agricultural system was "consuming ten times more energy than it was producing in the form of edible food." Perelman's research into how "profit-oriented agricultural system created hunger, pollution, serious public health consequences, and environmental disruption, while throwing millions of people off the land" led to his first book, ''Farming for Profit in a Hungry World'' (1977).&lt;ref name="CS Economics Department"/&gt; Perelman continued to write extensively in criticism of conventional or mainstream economics, including in all his [[Michael Perelman#Books|books]] (and especially his [[Michael Perelman#Books|books]]  published from 2000 to date), papers and interviews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2012/fanelli050512.html  "Self-Defense for Workers, Against Market Tyranny: An Interview with Michael Perelman"] by Carlo Fanelli, ''[[Monthly Review]]'' Magazine, May 5, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Although perceiving flaws in Marx's work as it is typically interpreted in the context of its modern reading, Perelman writes that "Marx’s crisis theory was far more sophisticated than many modern readers had realized," focusing on an interpretation that is largely bypassed by many readers of [[Marxian economics|Marxian economic thought]].&lt;ref name="CS Economics Department"/&gt; Perelman views Marxist theory as vindicated through its account of crises that a capitalist economy must inherently generate.&lt;ref name="CS Economics Department"/&gt;

Perelman has appeared on a number of programs, including ''[[Media Matters for America|Media Matters]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://will.illinois.edu/mediamatters/show/july-20-2008 Michael Perelman, economist at California State University, on  Media Matters], July 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pacifica Radio]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://wbai.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=9632&amp;Itemid=127 "Sun, Sept 2 6:00-7:00 pm: Equal Time for Freethought"] by Barry Seidman, Upcoming Programs: ''WBAI-FM and Pacifica Foundation''.

'''Miroslav Brandt''' (1914&amp;ndash;2002) was a [[Croatia]]n [[historian]], writer, [[publicist]] and [[polymath]]. He contributed to disparate areas ranging from politics to history of religions and literary translation. His polemical works helped preserve the national identity of [[Croats]] under [[SFRJ|Yugoslavia]].

==History, religion, literature==

Brandt was born in [[Cerić]] near the [[Croatia]]n town of [[Vinkovci]]. He graduated from the [[Faculty of Philosophy, Zagreb|Faculty of Philosophy]] at the [[University of Zagreb]] in 1948, specializing in history, geography and Latin. In 1954, he obtained his Ph.D. from the same university with the thesis ''Development of Economic and Social Relationships in [[Split (city)|Split]] until the End of the 14th century''. Brandt worked as a librarian in the [[National and University Library in Zagreb]], a curator in the [[Historical Museum in Zagreb]], an assistant at the Historical Institute of the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts|Academy]]. Finally, Brandt was a professor and vice-dean at the Faculty of Philosophy in Zagreb for many years. He died in Zagreb.

The opus of Miroslav Brandt includes large encyclopedic works, polemics and articles, as well as literary works. The greatest work in the first category is ''The [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] Age of Historical Development'', a monumental (around 800 pages) study presenting a detailed history of several centuries (starting from the 3rd) of European and [[History of the Mediterranean|Mediterranean]] history, describing the great clusters of civilizations of [[Western Christianity]], [[Byzantium]], [[Islam]] and other Asian societies (he even included Central American cultures). His ''magnum opus'' has many analyses of economy, culture, language, art, demography...

In 1989 Brandt wrote a large book called ''Sources of Evil: Dualist Themes'', where he collected many older works he had read at international or local conferences. It is a book of ideas, clearly showing the author's interest for [[Gnosticism|gnostic]] and [[dualistic cosmology|dualist]] currents in the [[history of religions]]. It includes a detailed analysis of [[Bible|Biblical]] books ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], [[Ecclesiastes]]), a careful examination of the [[Toltec]] religion, [[John Wycliffe|Wycliffe]]'s heresy, and local heretical movements in [[Dalmatia]] and [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], especially the phenomenon of the [[Bosnian Church]]. As for other larger history works, there is Brandt's book on the [[Kievan Rus']]. All these works are characterized by a modern critical and multifaceted approach, using archeology, [[palaeography]], history of art and other auxiliary history disciplines.

However, Brandt had far wider interests than medieval and religious studies. As the translator of a part of [[Marcel Proust|Proust's]] cycle ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]'', he showed a sensibility for literary and linguistic phenomena.

==Fight for the Croatian cause==

Considering his interest in language, it is no wonder that Brandt was one of the seven creators of the [[Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Standard Language]] of 1967. (There are indications that Brandt personally wrote the text of the Declaration.) As the Declaration went against the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] policy, Brandt became "undesirable": he was not given any serious punishment (neither were the other authors of the Declaration), but his field of activities was restricted.

The most important Brandt's polemical work is definitely the Anti-Memorandum, a text where he vehemently and scientifically refutes the claims of the [[Memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]], the fundamental document of the recent [[Greater Serbia]]n ideology. Later he was the initiator of the collection ''Sources of Greater Serbian Aggression'' (1991), translated into English and French, which includes his Anti-Memorandum.

Ironically, those two influential and historically significant works (especially the Declaration), look quite anachronous today, because of their style and arguments full of communist phrases, which had to be used for such works to be published under Yugoslavia. In this respect, Miroslav Brandt had the paradoxical destiny of a political writer who had much more success than the Croatian classics in that area ([[Ivo Pilar]], [[Milan Šufflay]]), but whose political works have become obsolete.

==Autobiographical writings==

In his old age Brandt turned to literature. He wrote an autobiography, ''Living with Contemporaries'', where he paints a pessimist image of his life, with not much good to say about his colleagues historians, primarily [[Jaroslav Šidak]] and [[Nada Klaić]].

Brandt's claim that his [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] origins, developed [[patriotism|national consciousness]] and non-[[communism|communist]] world view made him incompatible with the ideological framework of his profession which went against his whole being, is not easy to verify or valuate. In his memoirs, he explains why he did not deal with [[history of Croatia|Croatian themes]] (except marginally), instead using his erudition and interests to write about European and world history. Brandt's polemical statement that Croatian historiography under Yugoslavia purposely reduced the national element to a minimum, claiming to destroy myths and create critical historiography represented by [[Nada Klaić]] (whom Brandt accused of being protected by the communist regime only because it considered her work ultimately destructive for the Croatian national pride) remains an intriguing and questionable proposition that is yet to be verified.

Aside from the mentioned memoirs, he wrote a novel, ''Triptych'', where he attacked communist [[totalitarianism]]. It is too early to estimate the future status of his works in Croatian literature. Still, even a superficial reader will notice that Brandt spent the last years of his life in resignation and pessimism. The available sources indicate that not even the [[Croatian War of Independence|creation of a sovereign Croatian state]] (which he had helped prepare) managed to pull him from the lethargy and the feeling of pointlessness radiating from his autobiographic works.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1700">The '''Museum of Copenhagen''' ([[Danish language|Danish]]: Københavns Bymuseum), founded in 1891, is the official museum of [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], documenting the city's history from the 12th century to the present.

==History==

Starting in 1925, the museum had a permanent exhibition in the attic of [[Copenhagen City Hall]]. As the collections grew, the attic became too small and in 1956 the museum moved to the former building of the Royal Shooting Society. The former shooting range became a public park, still known as [[Skydebanehaven]]. In 1984, the museum took over the former Maria Kruuse School in the adjacent Absalongade. It is now used for administration as well as the museum's archives. Part of the street was turned into a museum street featuring historic [[street furniture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_historie/K%C3%B8benhavns_historie/K%C3%B8benhavns_Bymuseum|title=Københavns Bymuseum|publisher=Gyldendal|accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2018, the museum was moved to a new location, right behind the city hall.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6431">The '''New York State Archives''' is a unit of the Office of Cultural Education within the [[New York State Education Department]], with its main facility located in the [[Cultural Education Center]] on Madison Avenue in [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[United States]].  The [[New York State Library]] and the [[New York State Museum]] are also located in the Cultural Education Center. 

==Organization==
The New York State Archives was established in 1971 to preserve and make accessible recorded evidence documenting New York State's [[History of New York (state)|history]], [[government of New York|governments]], events, and peoples from the 17th century to the present.  Full operations began in 1978 when the organization's storage and research facility opened in the Cultural Education Center.  

==Collections==
The Archives preserves and provides access to over 250 million documents dating from the period of [[New Netherland|Dutch]] and British colonial rule during the 17th and 18th centuries through the modern day.  The State Archives preserves records from the [[New York State Legislature|legislative]], [[Judiciary of New York|judicial]], and executive branches of state government.  Topics covered in those records include relations with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], the [[Erie Canal]] and [[westward expansion]], industrial development, labor, the rise of the modern social welfare system, [[education in New York|public education]], public health, the [[environmental movement in the United States|environmental movement]], and New York State citizens' participation in numerous military conflicts.  The collection includes nearly 13,000 documents relating to the administration of the colony of New Netherland.  In addition, the archives maintains the records of the construction of the Erie Canal and [[New York State Barge Canal]] including maps, engineering drawings and [[glass plate]] negatives.  Finally, the collection includes over 50,000 motion picture film scripts from the 1920s to the 1960s.  The Archives' web site provides online access to over 100,000 digital images of maps, photographs and other materials of interest as well as an on-line catalog with descriptions of all records in the collection.

==Statewide programs==
In 1987 the New York State Archives assumed the responsibility for overseeing management and disposition of state government records, including operation of the State Records Center in Albany.  Legislation in 1988 created the Documentary Heritage Program that provided for technical advisory services and competitive grants to historical societies, museums, libraries, and other nonprofit organizations holding historical records.  A local government records law in 1987 required the appointment of records management officers in 4300 local governments, including every county, city, town, village, and school and special district.  A Local Government Records Management Improvement Fund was established in 1989 to support technical advisory services and competitive grants to local governments to help them develop and maintain records management programs.  Through this program the State Archives provides archives and records management advice and technical support to every area of the State. Over $250 million in grant funds have been distributed since the program's inception.

The New York State Archives serves students and teachers, scholars and community researchers, government officials, the legal and business community, and the general public.  It encourages students through awards, grants, and internships; helps teachers use historical documents as primary source material in the classroom; and offers stipends for research using State Archives’ records. The annual Student Research Award provides a cash award to New York State students in grades 3-5, 6-8 and 9-12 for projects that use historical records.  The Hackman Research Residency program provides travel grants to scholars to come to Albany to use the resources of the State Archives to conduct research and develop new knowledge using primary source materials.   The nonprofit New York State Archives Partnership Trust, established in 1992, provides support for preservation of and access to the treasures of the State Archives, educational projects that make historical records available to teachers and students and programs that promote New York State’s archives and history and publishes a quarterly magazine ''New York Archives'' with articles and photographic essays on New York state history.

==New York State Archives Partnership Trust==
The '''New York State Archives Partnership Trust''' was a [[New York state public-benefit corporations|New York State public-benefit corporation]] located within the Cultural Education Center whose mission was to create an endowment to preserve archival records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osc.state.ny.us/pubauth/data/authorities/APT.pdf|title=NYSOSC General Data Document on the NYSAPT|date=November 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not listed within the 2018 [[New York State Authorities Budget Office]] report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.abo.ny.gov/reports/annualreports/ABO2018AnnualReport.pdf|title=NYSABO 2018 Report|date=November 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kerald (Meister des Codex Egberti) 001.jpg|thumb|right|Massacre of the Innocents from the late 10th-century ''[[Codex Egberti]]'']]
The '''''Ordo Rachelis''''' (Play of Rachel), '''''Interfectio Puerorum''''' (Murder of the Children), or '''''Ludus Innocentium''''' (Play of the Innocents) is a [[Medieval theatre|medieval dramatic]] tradition consisting in four [[Play (theatre)|play]]s and based on the [[Massacre of the Innocents]], an event recorded in the [[Gospel of Matthew]], and on the prophecy recorded in the [[Book of Jeremiah]]: "A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not" (31:15, [[KJV]]). The prophecy, which Matthew believed to be fulfilled when [[Herod the Great]] ordered the slaughter of all boys under two in [[Bethlehem]], looks backwards to [[Rachel]], the matriarch of the [[Hebrews]], and towards her lamentation over the death of her children, the Hebrew children, in the massacre.

The ''Ordo Rachelis'' plays were probably performed as part of the [[liturgy]] for [[Innocents Day]] (28 December).

==Texts and origins==
The first modern critical edition of the Rachel plays was made by Karl Young in 1919. Young believed the plays developed from dramatic kernels in the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] plays of the ninth and tenth centuries into full dramatic treatments of their own in the eleventh and twelfth. The four extensive treatments which Young classified as ''ordines Rachelis'' differ considerably. There are the ''Lamentatio Rachelis'' from [[Abbey of Saint Martial, Limoges|Saint-Martial]] at [[Limoges]] (eleventh century), a lengthy part of an Epiphany play from [[Laon]] (twelfth century), a play from [[Freising]] (late eleventh century), and another one from [[Fleury Abbey|Fleury]] (thirteenth century). Only the last two can be regarded as "separate dramatic unit[s]". In both of them the ''[[Flight into Egypt|fuga in Egyptum]]'' and the ''[[Shepherd#Shepherds in religion|pastores]]'' themes have been incorporated, and the Fleury play contains the only extant medieval dramatic representation of the return from Egypt. Chambers has gone so far as to suggest a coalescing of all the Epiphany themes in the Fleury ''ordo'' and of a merging of the Rachel and Herod (''Herodes'') themes in the Freising.

The late eleventh-century manuscript of the Limoges ''ordo'' is now lat. 1139 in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], [[Paris]], which contains many liturgical pieces, including the play ''[[Sponsus]]''. The Fleury version is preserved in the famous [[Fleury Playbook]], an important eleventh-century compilation of liturgical drama.

As to the origins of the tradition Karl Young concluded, like [[:de:Heinrich Anz|Heinrich Anz]] before him (''Die lateinischen Magierspiele'', 1905), that it was initially an independent [[trope (literature)|trope]] at Limoges and then appended to the ''[[Officium stellae]]'' at Laon, representing a French tradition. This tradition was merged with a German one that arose at Freising at Fleury, though the ecclesiastical affairs that brought about this transmission (from Laon, Limoges, and Freising to Fleury) are unknown. Young differs from Anz in that the latter thought the Freising text also developed from the Limoges original. An older theory of origins was put forth by William Meyer (''Fragmenta Burana'', 1901). He hypothesised that a south German original, large and complex, disintegrated into a Freising play that was largely a whittled-down copy and three divergent French plays that were influenced by the French liturgy.

[[Peter Dronke]] believes it was to the dialogic poem ''Quid tu, virgo'' by [[Notker the Stammerer]], written probably in the 860s, that the eleventh-century dramatists were responding with their Rachel sequences.

==Plot and drama==
The Rachel of the play is symbolically every Hebrew mother who lost her child to the massacre. In the Freising version, she opens the action by singing a ''[[planctus]]'' over her children's bodies before a ''consolatrix'' (female comforter) arrives to soothe her spirit. In the Fleury version, she sings a series of four ''plancti'' before two ''consolatrices'' come out to catch her as she faints. The ''consolatrices'' fail to comfort her, but lead her away. In both versions they sing the final lines. In the Fleury version the drama began with a procession of young boys ''per monasterium'' (down the aisle of the church's nave) and a lamb bearing a cross appears running "to and fro" (''huc et illuc''). Then the action shifts to Herod receiving his sceptre and Joseph at the manger receiving a message from [[Gabriel]] to flee to Egypt. Joseph and the holy family exit secretly while [[Herod_the_Great#.22Suicide.22_of_Herod|Herod attempts suicide]] as news is brought that the [[Magi]] avoided telling him the Christ child's location. After he regains his composure, he orders the massacre. The lamb is then led off stage and the massacre begins, despite the pleas of the mothers and the children to the angels above. After the Rachel scenes, an angel conducts the children to the choir and a [[dumb show]] shows Herod being succeeded as king by [[Herod Archelaus|Archelaus]] before the holy family returns from Egypt. The entire Fleury play ends with a singing of the ''[[Te Deum]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3362">Medieval [[Islamic philosophy]] was steeped in both [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Neoplatonism]] from its 9th-century beginnings with [[Al-Kindi]],  but the influence of Neoplatonism becomes more clearly visible in the 10th and 11th centuries with [[Al-Farabi]] and [[Avicenna]]. Al-Farabi expanded on Plato’s concept of an ideal city ruled by philosopher-kings to develop a political philosophy that could accommodate the religious and cultural diversity central to Islamic nations.&lt;ref&gt;Druart, Thérèse-Anne. "Philosophy in Islam." In The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Philosophy. Ed. A. S. McGrade. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003. Pp. 103-104&lt;/ref&gt;
On the other hand, both [[al-Ghazali]] and [[Ibn Rushd]] vigorously opposed Neoplatonic views.

The characteristic of Neoplatonic thought in Islamic theology is that of emanation, linking God's transcendence with the corporeal reality of his creation. 
Islamic Neoplatonism was introduced by Al-Farabi, although  Avicenna proved to have the greater influence. Both authors present a complex scheme of emanation.

Islamic Neoplatonism was allowed to flourish in the 10th to early 11th century, but there 
was a strong reaction against it in the later 11th century, especially from 
[[Al-Ghazali]], who represents Islamic theology's "most biting attack on philosophy" at the time, and the severest reaction to Neoplatonism in particular (Netton 1998).
Al-Ghazali's criticism evoked a counter-reaction by [[Ibn Rushd]], 
who wrote a "systematic rebuttal of al-Ghazali's critique of Greco-Arab philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;Fakhry,  ''A History of Islamic Philosophy,'', 1983, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; 
While Ibn Rushd is trying to defend the possibility of philosophical thought as non-heretical, he does at the same time himself reject  the theses of the Neoplatonist philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;'more often than not...does not, in fact, defend al-Farabi and Ibn Sina.... Instead, he shows to what extent they have departed from the authentic Aristotelian philosophical doctrines, and sometimes joins his voice with that of Ghazali in convicting them of heresy' (Bello 1989: 15).&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Ibn Rushd in 1198, the debate on Neoplatonism in Islam mostly comes to an end, and survival of Neoplatonic thought within Islam was mostly limited to [[Ismailism]].

'''Ross'''  (''Ros'' in [[Scottish Gaelic]]) is a region of [[Scotland]], a former [[Earl of Ross|earldom]] and, under the name [[Ross and Cromarty]], a [[Counties of Scotland|county]]. The name ''Ross'' allegedly derives from a [[Goidelic|Gaelic]] word meaning "headland", perhaps a reference to the [[Black Isle]]. Another possible origin is the [[Old Norse language|West Norse]] word for [[Orkney]]&amp;nbsp;– ''Hrossey''&amp;nbsp;– meaning ''horse island''; the area once belonged to the [[Norway|Norwegian]] ([[West Norse]]) [[earldom]] of Orkney. Ross is a historical comital region, perhaps predating the [[Mormaerdom of Ross]].  It is also a region used by the [[Church of Scotland|Church]], with the [[Presbytery of Ross]] being part of the [[Synod of Ross, Sutherland and Caithness]]. 

== History ==

Excavations of a rock shelter and shell [[midden]] at [[Sand, Applecross]] on the coast of [[Wester Ross]] have shown that the coast was occupied by [[Mesolithic]] hunter-gatherers.

It may be doubted whether the [[Roman empire|Roman]]s ever effected even a temporary settlement in the area of the modern county. In Roman times, and for long afterwards, the land was occupied by [[Picts]], who, in the 6th and 7th centuries, were [[Christianization|converted to Christianity]] by followers of Saint [[Columba]]. Throughout the next three centuries the natives were continually harassed by Norwegian [[Viking Age|Viking]] raiders, of whose presence tokens have survived in several place-names ([[Dingwall]], [[Tain]], and others). At this time the country formed part of the great province of [[Moray]] (Latin: ''Moravia''), which then extended as far as the [[Dornoch Firth]] and the Oykel, and included practically the whole of Ross and Cromarty.

William, the 4th [[Earl of Ross]], was present with his [[Clan Ross|clan]] at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] (1314), and almost a century later (1412) the castle of Dingwall, the chief seat on the mainland of Donald, [[Lord of the Isles]], was captured after the disastrous fight at [[Battle of Harlaw|Harlaw]] in [[Aberdeenshire (traditional)|Aberdeenshire]], which Donald had provoked when his claim to the earldom was rejected. The earldom reverted to the crown in 1424, but [[James I of Scotland|James I]] soon afterwards restored it to the heiress of the line, the mother of Alexander Macdonald, 3rd [[Lord of the Isles]], who thus became the 11th Earl. In consequence, however, of the treason of John Macdonald, 4th and last Lord of the Isles and 12th Earl of Ross, the earldom was again vested in the crown (1476). Five years later [[James III of Scotland|James III]] bestowed it on his second son, [[James Stewart, Duke of Ross|James Stewart]], whom he also created Duke of Ross in 1488.

By the 16th century the whole area of the county was occupied by different [[Scottish clan|clans]]. The Rosses held what is now [[Easter Ross]]; the Munros the small tract around Ben Wyvis, including Dingwall; the Macleods [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]], and, in the mainland, the district between Loch Maree and Loch Torridon; the Macdonalds of Glengarry, Coigach, and the district between Strome Ferry and Kyle of Lochalsh, and the Mackenzies the remainder.

The county of Ross was constituted in 1661, and Cromarty in 1685 and 1698, both being consolidated into the present county in 1889.

Apart from occasional conflicts between rival clans, the only battles in the county were at [[Battle of Carbisdale|Invercarron]], at the head of Dornoch Firth, when [[James Graham, Marquis of Montrose|Montrose]] was crushed by Colonel Archibald Strachan on 27 April 1650; and at [[Battle of Glenshiel|Glenshiel]], where the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], under the [[William Mackenzie, 5th Earl of Seaforth|Earl of Seaforth]], aided by Spaniards, were defeated by a force under the command of General [[Joseph Wightman (general)|Joseph Wightman]] on 10 June 1719.

==Geography==
[[Image:Liathach from Beinn Eighe.jpg|thumb|left|Liathach seen from Beinn Eighe. With the Munro “Top“ of Stuc a' Choire Dhuibh Bhig (915 metres) in the foreground and the two Munro summits in the background.]]

[[Image:Horns of Alligin.jpg|thumb|left|View east from Sgurr Mhòr over the "Horns" of [[Beinn Alligin]]]]
Ross lies south of [[Sutherland]] and the Dornoch Firth, west of the [[North Sea]] and the [[Moray Firth]], north of the [[Beauly Firth]] and [[Inverness-shire]] and east of [[The Minch]]. There are also a number of small islands off the area's west coast, among which are:

* Gillean (lighthouse) in the parish of [[Loch Alsh|Lochalsh]]
* [[Crowlin Islands]] in [[Applecross]]
* [[Eilean Horrisdale]], and [[Isle of Ewe]] in [[Gairloch]] parish
* [[Isle Martin]] and [[Tanera More]], of the [[Summer Isles]] group in the parish of [[Lochbroom (parish)|Lochbroom]]

The area of the mainland is {{convert|1572332|acre}}.

On the North Sea (eastern) side of the county the major [[firth]]s are the Beauly Firth and the (Inner) [[Moray Firth]], which separate the [[Black Isle]] from [[Inverness-shire]]; the [[Cromarty Firth]], which bounds the districts of Easter Ross and the Black Isle; the Moray Firth, separating Easter Ross from [[Nairnshire]]; and the [[Dornoch Firth]], dividing north-east [[Ross-shire|Ross]] from Sutherland.

On the [[Atlantic (ocean)|Atlantic]] (western) coastline&amp;mdash;which has a length of nearly {{convert|311|mi}}&amp;mdash;the principal sea lochs and bays, from south to north, are [[Loch Duich]], [[Loch Alsh]], Loch Carron, Loch Kishorn, [[Loch Torridon]], Loch Shieldaig, Upper Loch Torridon, [[Gair Loch]], [[Loch Ewe]], [[Gruinard Bay]], [[Loch Broom]] and Enard Bay.

The chief capes include Tarbat Ness on the east coast, and Coigach, Greenstone Point, Rubha Reidh, [[Redpoint]] and Hamha Point on the west.

Almost all the southern boundary with Inverness-shire consists of a rampart of peaks, many of them [[Munro]]s:
* [[An Riabhachan]] ({{convert|3704|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}),
* [[Sgurr na Lapaich]] ({{convert|3773|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}),
* [[Carn Eige]] (Càrn Eighe) ({{convert|3881|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}),
* [[Mam Sodhail]] (Mam Soul) ({{convert|3871|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}),
* [[Beinn Fhada]] (Ben Attow) ({{convert|3386|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}),
* [[Sgurr Fhuaran]] ({{convert|3504|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}),
* [[The Saddle]] ({{convert|3317|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}).

To the north of Glen [[Torridon]] are the masses of [[Liathach]] ({{convert|3455|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), [[Beinn Eighe]] ({{convert|3313|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), [[Beinn Alligin]] ({{convert|3235|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and [[Beinn Dearg (Torridon)|Beinn Dearg]] ({{convert|2998|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}). On the northeastern shore of Loch Maree rises [[Slioch]] ({{convert|3219|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), while the Fannich group contains six Munros, the highest being Sgurr Mor ({{convert|3645|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}). The immense isolated bulk of [[Ben Wyvis]] ({{convert|3428|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), forms the most noteworthy feature in the north-east, and [[An Teallach]] ({{convert|3484|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) in the north-west appears equally conspicuous, though less solitary. Only a small fraction of the west and south of the area is under {{convert|1000|ft|abbr=on}} in height. Easter Ross and the peninsula of the Black Isle are comparatively level.

The longest stream of the mainland portion of Ross and Cromarty is the River Orrin, which rises from the slopes of An Sidhean ({{convert|2671|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and pursues a north-easterly course to its confluence with the River Conon after a run of about {{convert|26|mi}}, a small part of which forms the boundary with Inverness-shire. At Aultgowrie the stream rushes through a narrow gorge where the drop is considerable enough to make the Falls of Orrin. The River Blackwater flows from mountains in [[Strathvaich]] southeast for {{convert|18|mi}} until it joins the Conon, forming soon after it leaves Loch Garve the small but picturesque Falls of Rogie. Within a short distance of its exit from Loch Luichart the Conon pours over a series of cascades and rapids and then pursues a winding course of {{convert|12|mi}}, mainly eastward to the head of the Cromarty Firth. Situated above Glen Elchaig in the southwest of the region are the Falls of Glomach. The stream giving rise to them drains a series of small lochs on the northern flanks of Beinn Fhada (Ben Attow) and, in an almost unbroken sheet over a metre in width, effects a sheer drop of 110 m, and soon afterwards ends its course in Glen Elchaig. The falls are usually visited from [[Invershiel]] 11&amp;nbsp;km to the south-west. 12 miles south-east of Ullapool, on the estate of Braemore, are the Falls of Measach, formed by the Droma, a headstream of the River Broom. The cascades, three in number, are close to Corrieshalloch Gorge. The River Oykel, throughout its course, forms the boundary with Sutherland.
[[Image:Slioch from Loch Maree.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Slioch seen from the shores of Loch Maree]]
There are many freshwater [[loch]]s, the largest being [[Loch Maree]]. In the far north-west, {{convert|243|ft|abbr=on}} above the sea, lies Loch Sionascaig, a loch of such irregularity of outline that it has a shore-line of {{convert|17|mi}}. It contains several wooded islands, and drains into Enard Bay by the River Polly. [[Lochan Fada]] (the long loch), {{convert|1000|ft|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} above the sea, is {{convert|4|mi}} in length, and covers an area of {{convert|1112|acre}}, and is {{convert|42|fathom|m}} deep, with a mean depth of {{convert|17|fathom|m}}. Once drained by the Muice (Allt na Muice), it has been tapped a little farther west by the Abhainn na Fhasaigh, which has lowered the level of the loch. Other lochs are Fionn Loch (the white or clear lake), {{convert|8|mi}} long by {{convert|1|mi}} wide, famous for its [[heron]]s, Loch Luichart towards the centre of the area (8 miles long and between {{convert|0.5|-|1|mi|1}} wide), fringed with [[birch]]es and having the shape of a crescent, the mountain-girt Loch Fannich (1 mile wide); and the wild narrow Lochs [[Loch Monar and Loch Mullardoch|Monar]] ({{convert|4|mi|disp=or|abbr=on}} long) and [[Loch Monar and Loch Mullardoch|Mullardoch]] ({{convert|5|mi|disp=or|abbr=on}} long), on the [[Inverness-shire]] boundary.

Of the [[strath]]s or valleys, the more important run from the centre eastwards, such as Strathconon, Strathbran, Strathgarve, Strathpeffer and [[Strathcarron, Highland|Strathcarron]]. Excepting Glen Orrin, in the east central district, the longer glens lie in the south and towards the west. In the extreme south [[Glen Shiel]] runs between five mountains (the [[Five Sisters of Kintail]]) to its mouth on Loch Duich. The [[A87 road|A87]] passes down the glen. Further north lie Glen Elchaig, Glen Carron, and Glen Torridon. The railway from Dingwall runs through Glen Carron to [[Kyle of Lochalsh]].

==Geology==

The central portion of this county is occupied by the younger highland [[schist]]s or Dalradian series. These consist of [[quartzite]]s, mica-schists, garnetiferous mica-schists and [[gneiss]]es, all with a gentle inclination towards the southeast. On the eastern side of the county the Dalradian schists are covered unconformably by the Old Red Sandstone. The boundary runs southward from Edderton on Dornoch Firth, by Strathpeffer, to the neighborhood of Beauly. These rocks comprise red flags and [[sandstone]]s, grey bituminous flags and [[shale]]s. An [[anticline|anticlinal]] fold with a southwest-northeast axis brings up the basal beds of the series about the mouth of Cromarty Firth and exposes once more the schists in The Sutors (The Sutors of Cromarty) guarding the entrance to the firth. The western boundary of the younger schist is formed by the great [[pre-Cambrian]] dislocation line that traverses the county in a fairly direct course from Elphin on the north by [[Ullapool]] to Glencarron. Most of the area west of the line of disturbance is covered by [[Torridonian Sandstone]], mainly dark reddish sandstones, grits and shales, resting unconformably on the ancient [[Lewisian complex|Lewisian gneiss]] with horizontal or slightly inclined bedding. The unconformity is well exposed on the shores of Gairloch, Loch Maree and Loch Torridon. These rocks, which attain a considerable thickness and are divisible into three sub-groups, build up the mountain districts of Applecross, Coigach and elsewhere.

Within the Torridonian tract the older Lewisian gneiss occupies large areas north of Coigach, on the east of Enard Bay, between Gruinard Bay and Loch Maree. Between the last named and Gairloch, on both sides of middle Loch Torridon and at many other spots smaller patches appear. The Lewisian gneiss is everywhere penetrated by basic [[dike (geology)|dikes]], generally with a northwest-southeast direction; some of these are of great breadth. The Torridonian rocks are succeeded unconformably by a series of Cambrian strata confined to a variable but narrow belt west of the line of main thrusting. This belt of Cambrian rocks has suffered an enormous amount of subordinate thrusting. It is composed of the following subdivisions in ascending order: falsebedded quartzite, Pipe Rock quartzite, fucoid beds and Olenellus band, serpulite grit, Durness [[dolomite]] and [[marble]], Durness dolomite and [[limestone]]: but these are not always visible at any one spot. So great has been the disturbance in the region of thrusting that in some places, as in the neighborhood of Loch Kishorn and elsewhere, the rocks have been completely overturned and the ancient gneiss has been piled upon the Torridonian.

On the shore of [[Moray Firth]] at Rathie a small patch of Kimeridge shale occurs, and beneath the cliffs of Shandwick there is a little Lower Oolite with a thin seam of coal. Glacial striae are found upon the mountains up to heights of {{convert|3300|ft|abbr=on}}, and much boulder clay is found in the valleys and spread over large areas in the eastern districts. Raised beaches occur at up to {{convert|108|ft|abbr=on}} or so above the present sea-level; they are well seen in Loch Carron.

==Climate and agriculture==

The west coast has high rainfall: an annual average of {{convert|50.42|in|mm}} at Loch Broom and {{convert|62|in|mm|abbr=on}} at [[Stromeferry|Strome Ferry]] (autumn and winter being the wettest seasons), but on the east coast the annual average is only {{convert|27|in|mm|abbr=on}}. The average daily maximum{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} temperature for the year is {{convert|46.5|F}}. Average daily maxima for January and July are {{convert|38|°F|°C|abbr=on}} and {{convert|57|°F|°C|abbr=on}} respectively.

The most fertile tracts lie on the eastern coast, especially in Easter Ross and the Black Isle, where the soil varies from a light sandy [[gravel]] to a rich deep [[loam]]. As of 1911, among grain crops [[oat]]s were most generally cultivated, but [[barley]] and wheat were also raised. [[Turnip]]s and potatoes were the chief green{{clarify|date=April 2015}} [[Agriculture|crops]]. The higher land contains much good [[Pasture|pasturage]], with many sheep, blackfaced being the principal breed. Most of the horses, principally half-breds between the old [[garron]]s (hardy, serviceable, small animals) and [[Clydesdale]]s, were maintained for the purposes of agriculture. The herds of cattle, mainly native [[Highland cattle|Highland]] or crosses, were large, many of them supplying the London market. Pigs were reared, though in smaller numbers than formerly, most generally by the [[croft (land)|croft]]ers.

As of 1911 about {{convert|800000|acre}} were devoted to [[deer]] forests, a greater area than in any other county in Scotland, among the largest being Achnashellach with {{convert|50000|acre|ha}}), Fannich with {{convert|20000|acre}}, Kinlochluichart with {{convert|20600|acre}}, Braemore with {{convert|40000|acre}}, Inchbae with {{convert|21000|acre}} and Dundonnell with {{convert|23000|acre}}. At one time the area under wood must have been remarkable, if we accept the common derivation of the word "Ross" as from the Old Irish ''ros'', a wood, and there was until recent times a considerable extent of native woodland, principally [[Scots Pine|pine]], [[oak]], [[Ash tree|ash]] and [[alder]].

The [[Fauna (animals)|fauna]] was noteworthy. [[Red deer|Red]] and [[roe deer]] abounded, and [[fox]]es and [[Mountain hare|alpine hare]]s were common, while [[badger]]s and [[wild cat]]s were occasionally trapped. Winged [[Game (food)|game]] was plentiful, and amongst [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]] the [[golden eagle]] and [[osprey]] occurred. [[Wildfowl|Waterfowl]] of all kinds frequented the [[sea loch]]s. Many rivers and lochs were rich in [[salmon]] and [[trout]], and the pearl [[mussel]] was found in the bed of the Conon.

== Other industries ==

Tourism is a major industry in the region, with over 20% of the workforce employed in the wholesale, restaurant and hotels sector, second only to the public service sector. A little over 5% of the workforce are employed in agriculture, forestry and fishing, traditionally major industries in the region. The oil industry, which spurred a rapid increase in industrial development in the 1970s, is in decline, although still a major employer.

The Glen Ord and [[Glenmorangie]] distilleries are prominent whisky distilleries.

A railway, the [[Far North Line]] from [[Inverness]], enters the county to the north of [[Beauly]] and runs northwards through Dingwall and onwards to Tain and along the southerly bank of the Dornoch Firth. From there the single-track line continues north/northeast through Sutherland to [[Thurso]] and [[Wick, Caithness|Wick]] in [[Caithness]]. The [[Kyle of Lochalsh Line]] runs  west/southwest from Dingwall to the [[Kyle of Lochalsh]].

==Antiquities==

The principal relics of antiquity - mainly [[stone circle]]s, [[cairn]]s and [[Fortification|forts]] - appear in the eastern district. A vitrified fort crowns the hill of Knockfarrel in the parish of Fodderty, and there is a circular [[dun]] near the village of [[Lochcarron]]. Some fine examples of sculptured stones occur, especially those that, according to tradition, mark the burial-place of the three sons of a Danish king who were shipwrecked off the coast of Nigg. The largest and handsomest of these three crosses - the Clach a' Charraidh, or Stone of Lamentation - stands at Shandwick. It is about 10 feet (3 m) high and contains representations of the martyrdom of St Andrew and figures of an elephant and dog. It fell during a storm in 1847 and was broken in three pieces. On the top of the cross in Nigg churchyard are two figures with outstretched arms in the act of supplication; the dove descends between them, and below are two dogs. The cross was knocked down by the fall of the belfry in 1725, but has been riveted together. The third stone formerly stood at Hilton of Cadboll, but was removed for security to the grounds of Invergordon Castle.

Among old castles are those of Lochslin, in the parish of Fearn, said to date from the 13th century, which, though ruinous, possesses two square towers in good preservation; Balone, in the parish of Tarbat, once a stronghold of the Earls of Ross; the remains of Dingwall Castle, their original seat; and [[Eilean Donan]] in Loch Alsh, which was blown up by British warships during the [[Jacobitism|abortive Jacobite rising]] in 1719.

== Local government areas ==
: ''See also'' [[Politics of the Highland Council area]]

The local government county was created under the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889]], which also established elected [[county council]]s for all counties in Scotland. The county of Ross and Cromarty was nominally a merger of two older administrative counties, [[Ross-shire]] and [[Cromartyshire]], but there were some alterations to boundaries. The alterations became fully effective, for all purposes except parliamentary representation, in 1892.

The county included six [[burgh]]s: [[Cromarty]], [[Dingwall]], [[Fortrose]], [[Invergordon]], [[Stornoway]] and [[Tain]]. Dingwall was the [[county town]].

When counties and burghs were abolished as local government areas, in 1975, under the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]], the area of the county was divided between two new areas, the [[Highland (council area)|Highland]] [[Regions and districts of Scotland|region]] and the [[Western Isles]], and the Ross and Cromarty district of the region was created as one of eight districts of the new region.

Stornoway and the district of [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]] merged into the Western Isles. Also, the new Ross and Cromarty district excluded two other areas, which merged into other districts of the region. The electoral division of [[Kincardine (disambiguation)|Kincardine]] was merged into [[Sutherland]], and the South West electoral division (an area around and including [[Loch Alsh|Lochalsh]]) was merged into [[Skye and Lochalsh]].

In 1996, under the [[Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994]], the district was abolished and the Highland region was turned into a [[Council areas of Scotland|unitary council area]]. The new [[unitary authority]], the [[Highland Council]], then adopted the area of the former district as a council management area, and created area committees to represent it. The management area consisted then of 13 [[ward (politics)|ward]]s, each electing one [[councillor]] by the [[first past the post]] system of election. The council as a whole had 72 members.

Ward boundaries were altered in 1999, to create 80 new wards, but management area boundaries were unaltered. Therefore, area committees ceased to represent exactly the areas for which they were named and made decisions. 18 wards and, therefore, 18 councillors were related to the Ross and Cromarty management area.

Under the [[Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004]], ward boundaries changed again this year, 2007. Also, the eight management areas were abolished in favour of three new corporate management areas. The Ross and Cromarty area was divided between the Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross area and the Ross, Skye and Lochaber area.

The '''Royal Palace''' (official name '''Haw Kham''', {{Lang-lo|ຫໍຄຳ}} {{IPA-lo|hɔ̌ɔ.kʰám}}) in [[Luang Prabang]], [[Laos]], was built in 1904 during the [[France|French]] colonial era for [[Sisavang Vong|King Sisavang Vong]] and his family. The site for the palace was chosen so that official visitors to Luang Prabang could disembark from their river voyages directly below the palace and be received there. After the death of King Sisavang Vong, the [[Crown Prince]] [[Savang Vatthana]] and his family were the last to occupy the grounds. In 1975, the monarchy was overthrown by the communists and the [[Lao Royal Family|royal family]] were taken to [[re-education camps]]. The palace was then converted into a national museum.

==The Grounds==
[[File:Sisavangvong statue.JPG|right|thumb|150px|Statue of Sisavang Vong on the palace grounds]]
On the palace grounds, there are other buildings surrounding the palace which includes:
*Kitchen/Storage
*Royal Barge Shelter
*Conference Hall
*Haw Pha Bang
*Staff Headquarters

There is a lotus pond and two cannons at the entrance of the palace. A statue of King Sisavang Vong is outside the conference hall.

==Architecture and furnishings==
The architecture of the palace has a mixed of traditional [[Lao people|Lao]] motifs and French [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts]] styles. It was laid out in a double-cruciform shape with the entrance on one side of the lower crossbar. Above the entrance is a three-headed elephant sheltered by the sacred white parasol, the symbol of the Lao monarchy. The steps to the entrance are made of [[Italy|Italian]] marble. There are royal religious objects on display in the large Entrance Hall.

[[File:Palais-Musée.JPG|right|thumb|250px|The front view of the palace]]
On the right of the entrance is the King's reception room, where busts of the [[Kingdom of Luang Phrabang|Luang Phrabang]] and, later, Lao monarchs are displayed along with two large gilded and lacquered [[Ramayana]] screens, crafted by the local artisan [[Thit Tanh]]. The walls are covered with murals that depict scenes from traditional Lao lifestyles, painted in 1930 by a [[French people|French]] artist, [[Alix de Fauntereau]]. Each of the walls is intended to be viewed at a different time of day, depending on the light that enters the windows on one side of the room, which matches the time of day depicted.

In the right front corner room of the palace, which opens to the outside, is a collection of the palace's most prized art, including the [[Phra Bang]], cast of a gold, silver and bronze alloy. This [[Buddharupa|Buddha]] stands 83&amp;nbsp;cm tall and weighs around 50&amp;nbsp;kg. Legend has it that the statue was made around the 1st century in [[Sri Lanka]] and was later presented to the [[Khemer King Phaya Sirichantha]], who then gave it to [[King Fa Ngum]] in 1359 as a Lao Buddhist leader.

The Siamese twice took the image to Thailand in 1779 and 1827, but it was returned to Laos by [[King Mongkut]] in 1867. There are rumours that the one on display is a copy and the original is stored in [[Vientiane]] or [[Moscow]]. It is said the real one had gold leaf over the eyes and a hole drilled through one of its ankle. Also in the room are another Buddha, engraved with large elephant tusks, and three beautiful [[saew mâi khán]] (embroidered silk screens with religious imagery) that were crafted by the Queen.

On the left of the Entrance Hall, the secretary's reception room is filled with paintings, silver and china that have been presented to Laos as diplomatic gifts from [[Myanmar]], [[Cambodia]], [[Thailand]], [[Poland]], Hungary, Russia, Japan, [[Vietnam]], China, [[Nepal]], United States, Canada and Australia. These objects are grouped by "socialist" and "capitalist" countries. One exhibit donated by the USA is a piece of moon rock obtained by an Apollo mission.

The next room to the left was once the Queen's reception room. Large royal portraits of [[Savang Vatthana|King Savang Vatthana]], [[Khamphoui|Queen Khamphoui]] and [[Crown Prince]] [[Vong Savang]], painted by [[Russian people|Russian]] artist [[Ilya Glazunov]] in 1967, are hung on the walls. There are friendship flags from China and Vietnam and replicas of sculpture from the [[National Museum, New Delhi]].

[[File:Luang Prabang Museum.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Haw Pha Bang]]
In the far rooms are the [[Lao Royal Family|royal family]]'s bedrooms and living quarters. The bedrooms have been preserved as they were in 1975 when the [[King of Laos|King]] was forced from the palace. There is a dining hall and a room that contains royal seals and medals.

The [[Throne Room]] contains the [[Crown Jewels]] of Laos.

'''''Sherman's March''''' is a 2007 [[American Civil War]] television documentary film first aired on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]. The film is directed by Rick King and the executive producer is Jason Williams.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0899221|title=Sherman's March}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The production combines narration with reenacted dramatic sequences as its foundation.

The film, narrated by actor [[Edward Herrmann]], tells the tale of [[Union Army|Union]] [[General Officer|General]] [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], called "Uncle Billy" by his [[soldiers|troops]], and his five-week assault from [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] ([[Savannah, Georgia]]) and then north to trap [[Confederate States Army]] General [[Robert E. Lee]].

Sherman's military campaign has become the mythic symbol of destruction during the Civil War. The opening sequence poses the question that reflects the film's theme:
:Sherman: Terrorist or Savior?

==Synopsis==
The documentary chronicles General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]'s historic "[[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]]" through [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[South Carolina]] and [[North Carolina]] during the fall of 1864. It shows Sherman marching 62,000 Union troops over 650 miles in less than 100 days, and losing only 600 men along the way. The march introduces a new concept to the already brutal Civil War: [[Total War|total war]], where the distinctions between combatants and civilians is blurred. While hated by white Southerners as a destroyer, Sherman is hailed by black Southerners as a liberator. It ends with Union victory and closes with Sherman as an old man living in New York and fondly remembering how his "nephews" and their "uncle Billy" would make ten miles a day.

The documentary utilizes state of the art production techniques including [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], special effects and historical re-creations. It relies on historical reenactors to play Sherman's soldiers and all dialogue is in fact quotes from historical sources: letters, Sherman's memoirs, diaries, etc. The documentary features a psychological profile on Sherman, stating that in the months leading up to the Civil War he was accused of being insane and that he contemplated suicide.

Bill Oberst, the actor playing Sherman, states in a behind-the-scenes featurette that while the general will always be a controversial figure, he hopes that the documentary will shed light on why the man did what he did. It emphasizes that Sherman was loved by the enslaved blacks whom he freed and that while he did not see himself as fighting to destroy slavery, he nevertheless made a point of treating blacks whom he met with courtesy and respect. (The documentary also shows the reactions of his soldiers as they met blacks along the March. Many had never seen a black person and were surprised to learn that blacks were ordinary people.) The documentary also mentions that Sherman killed far fewer Confederate soldiers and civilians than did Ulysses S. Grant, his friend and fellow general, yet Sherman was the one vilified. The scholars interviewed postulate that the South had need for a scapegoat in the wake of the Civil War and that Sherman was the easiest target. For his part, Sherman is stated to have seen himself as only doing his duty and that he did not care what people said about him one way or the other.

==Background==
Filming took place on location in High Definition in [[Washington County, Maryland]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herald-mail.com/?module=displaystory&amp;story_id=163771&amp;format=html ''The Herald-Mail'']. "''Sherman's March'' to be shown on The History Channel Sunday", television review, April 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and also at [[Endview Plantation]] and [[Lee Hall, Virginia|Lee Hall]] in [[Newport News, Virginia]] and in [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]].

==Critical reception==
The documentary was well received by television critics. Tony Perry of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote, "Civil War documentaries are inevitably judged against the monumental work ''[[The Civil War (TV series)|The Civil War]]'' by [[Ken Burns]]. ''Sherman's March,'' different in tone and approach, more than holds its own. Whereas Burns used period photographs and regional music, ''Sherman's March'' leans on reenactments, maps and, like Burns, academic talking heads. If there is a quibble, it's that the music tends to distract, not enhance, the effect."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calendarlive.com/tv/cl-et-shermans21apr21,0,2273961.story?coll=cl-tvent-util Perry, Tony]. The ''Los Angeles Times'', television review, April 21, 2007. Last accessed: April 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadcasting critic Dusty Saunders wrote of the scholarly aspects of the documentary, "...''Sherman's March'', [is] a compelling documentary on The History Channel that's must viewing for Civil War buffs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38989">'''Social Darwinism''' is the application of the [[evolutionary]] concept of [[natural selection]] to [[human society]]. The term itself emerged in the 1880s, and it gained widespread currency when used after 1944 by opponents of these ways of thinking. The majority of those who have been categorized as social Darwinists did not identify themselves by such a label.&lt;ref name="h428"&gt;{{harvnb|Hodgson|2004|pp=428–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars debate the extent to which the various social Darwinist ideologies reflect [[Charles Darwin]]'s own views on human social and economic issues. His writings have passages that can be interpreted as opposing aggressive individualism, while other passages appear to promote it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=300–01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars argue that Darwin's view gradually changed and came to incorporate views from other theorists such as [[Herbert Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Gregory |last=Claeys |title=The 'Survival of the Fittest' and the Origins of Social Darwinism |journal=[[Journal of the History of Ideas]] |volume=61 |issue=2 |year=2000 |pages=223–40 |doi=10.1353/jhi.2000.0014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spencer published&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spencer|first=Herbert|date=1852|title=4"A Theory of Population, Deduced from the General Law of Human Fertility|url=|journal=Westminster Review, 57 |pages=468–501|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; his [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] evolutionary ideas about society before Darwin first published his hypothesis in 1859, and both Spencer and Darwin promoted their own conceptions of moral values. Spencer supported ''laissez-faire'' capitalism on the basis of his Lamarckian belief that struggle for survival spurred [[Self-help|self-improvement]] which could be inherited.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=301–02}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important proponent in Germany was [[Ernst Haeckel]], who popularized Darwin's thought (and personal interpretation of it) and used it as well to contribute to a new creed, the [[Monism|monist]] movement.

==Origin of the term==
The term Darwinism was coined by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] in his March 1861 review of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'',&lt;ref name="westminster"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A32&amp;pageseq=29|title=ART. VIII. – Darwin on the origin of Species|authorlink=Thomas Henry Huxley|date=April 1860|publisher=[[Westminster Review]]|pages=541–70|quote=What if the orbit of Darwinism should be a little too circular?|author=Huxley, T.H.|accessdate=2008-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the 1870s it was used to describe a range of concepts of evolution or development, without any specific commitment to Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection.&lt;ref name="b179"&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first use of the phrase "social Darwinism" was in Joseph Fisher's 1877 article on ''The History of Landholding in Ireland'' which was published in the ''[[Royal Historical Society|Transactions of the Royal Historical Society]]''.&lt;ref name="oed" /&gt; Fisher was commenting on how a system for borrowing [[livestock]] which had been called "tenure" had led to the false impression that the early Irish had already evolved or developed [[land tenure]];&lt;ref name="fisher77" /&gt;
{{quotation|These arrangements did not in any way affect that which we understand by the word " tenure", that is, a man's farm, but they related solely to cattle, which we consider a chattel. It has appeared necessary to devote some space to this subject, inasmuch as that usually acute writer Sir Henry Maine has accepted the word " tenure " in its modern interpretation, and has built up a theory under which the Irish chief " developed " into a feudal baron. I can find nothing in the Brehon laws to warrant this theory of social Darwinism, and believe further study will show that the Cain Saerrath and the Cain Aigillue relate solely to what we now call chattels, and did not in any way affect what we now call the freehold, the possession of the land.|Fisher 1877.&lt;ref name=fisher77&gt;{{harvnb|Fisher|1877|pp=249–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Despite the fact that Social Darwinism bears Charles Darwin's name, it is also linked today with others, notably [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Thomas Malthus]], and [[Francis Galton]], the founder of eugenics. In fact, Spencer was not described as a social Darwinist until the 1930s, long after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson&lt;/ref&gt; The social Darwinism term first appeared in Europe in 1880, the journalist [[Émile Gautier|Emilie Gautier]] had coined the term with reference to a health conference in Berlin 1877.&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Joseph|year=1877|title=The History of Landholding in Ireland|journal=Transactions of the Royal Historical Society|volume=V|pages=228–326|jstor=3677953|ref=harv|doi=10.2307/3677953}}, as quoted in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1900 it was used by sociologists, some being opposed to the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ward|first=Lester F|authorlink=Lester Frank Ward|year=1907|title=Social Darwinism|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=12|pages=709–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was popularized in the United States in 1944 by the American historian [[Richard Hofstadter]] who used it in the ideological war effort against fascism to denote a reactionary creed which promoted competitive strife, racism and chauvinism. Hofstadter later also recognized (what he saw as) the influence of Darwinist and other evolutionary ideas upon those with [[collectivist]] views, enough to devise a term for the phenomenon, "Darwinist collectivism".&lt;ref name="TCL"&gt;Leonard, Thomas C. (2009) [http://www.princeton.edu/~tleonard/papers/myth.pdf Origins of the Myth of Social Darwinism: The Ambiguous Legacy of Richard Hofstadter's Social Darwinism in American Thought] Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization 71, pp. 37–51&lt;/ref&gt; Before Hofstadter's work the use of the term "social Darwinism" in English academic journals was quite rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hodgson|2004|pp=445–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact,

{{quote|... there is considerable evidence that the entire concept of "social Darwinism" as we know it today was virtually invented by Richard Hofstadter. [[Eric Foner]], in an introduction to a then-new edition of Hofstadter's book published in the early 1990s, declines to go quite that far. "Hofstadter did not invent the term Social Darwinism", Foner writes, "which originated in Europe in the 1860s and crossed the Atlantic in the early twentieth century. But before he wrote, it was used only on rare occasions; he made it a standard shorthand for a complex of late-nineteenth-century ideas, a familiar part of the lexicon of social thought."|Jeff Riggenbach&lt;ref name=Riggenbach&gt;Riggenbach, Jeff (2011-04-24) [https://mises.org/daily/5206/The-Real-William-Graham-Sumner The Real William Graham Sumner], [[Mises Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Usage ===
Social Darwinism has many definitions, and some of them are incompatible with each other. As such, social Darwinism has been criticized for being an inconsistent philosophy, which does not lead to any clear political conclusions. For example, ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics'' states:&lt;blockquote&gt;Part of the difficulty in establishing sensible and consistent usage is that commitment to the biology of natural selection and to 'survival of the fittest' entailed nothing uniform either for sociological method or for political doctrine. A 'social Darwinist' could just as well be a defender of laissez-faire as a defender of state socialism, just as much an imperialist as a domestic eugenist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics|last=McLean|first=Iain|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780199207800|location=Oxford University|page=490}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term "Social Darwinism" has rarely been used by advocates of the supposed ideologies or ideas; instead it has almost always been used pejoratively by its opponents.&lt;ref name="h428"/&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=D. Paul|title=Contemporary Sociological Theory|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|year=2008|page=492|chapter=The Historical Background of Social Darwinism|quote=In the social realm the competitive struggle may be among individuals or among different groups within society, different societies, or different racial or ethnic populations.|isbn=0-387-76521-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; The term draws upon the common meaning of ''[[Darwinism]]'', which includes a range of [[evolutionism|evolutionary views]], but in the late 19th century was applied more specifically to [[natural selection]] as first advanced by [[Charles Darwin]] to explain [[speciation]] in populations of [[organism]]s. The process includes competition between individuals for limited resources, popularly but inaccurately described by the phrase "[[survival of the fittest]]", a term coined by [[sociologist]] [[Herbert Spencer]]&lt;!--? or "[[The Gospel of Wealth]]" theory written by [[Andrew Carnegie]]--&gt;.

[[Creationism|Creationists]] have often maintained that Social Darwinism—leading to policies designed to reward the most competitive—is a [[logical consequence]] of  "Darwinism" (the theory of natural selection in biology).&lt;ref name="Paul 220"&gt;Paul, Diane B. in {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X1InLet11j0C&amp;pg=PA219|title=The Cambridge Companion to Darwin|date=5 March 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-71184-5|pages=219–20|quote=Like many foes of Darwinism, past and present, the American populist and creationist William Jennings Bryan thought a straight line ran from Darwin's theory ('a dogma of darkness and death') to beliefs that it is right for the strong to crowd out the weak|author=Gregory Radick}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Biologists and historians have stated that this is a fallacy of [[appeal to nature]] and should not be taken to imply that this phenomenon ought to be used as a moral guide in human society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Q&amp;A: Steven Pinker of 'Blank Slate'|url = http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2002/10/30/QA-Steven-Pinker-of-Blank-Slate/26021035991232/|website = [[UPI]]|accessdate = December 5, 2015|date = October 30, 2002|last = Sailer|first = Steve|archivedate = December 5, 2015|dead-url = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151205074319/http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2002/10/30/QA-Steven-Pinker-of-Blank-Slate/26021035991232/}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are historical links between the popularization of Darwin's theory and forms of social Darwinism, social Darwinism is not a necessary consequence of the principles of biological evolution.

While the term has been applied to the claim that Darwin's theory of [[evolution]] by natural selection can be used to understand the social endurance of a nation or country, Social Darwinism commonly refers to ideas that predate Darwin's publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. Others whose ideas are given the label include the 18th century clergyman [[Thomas Malthus]], and Darwin's cousin [[Francis Galton]] who founded eugenics towards the end of the 19th century.

The expansion of the [[British Empire]] fitted in with the broader notion of social Darwinism used from the 1870s onwards to account for the remarkable and universal phenomenon of "the Anglo-Saxon overflowing his boundaries", as phrased by the late-Victorian sociologist [[Benjamin Kidd]] in ''Social Evolution'', published in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin Kidd]], ''Social Evolution'', Kessinger Publishing, LLC, 2007, 400 pages, {{ISBN|978-0548805237}}, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept also proved useful to justify what was seen by some as the inevitable extermination of "the weaker races who disappear before the stronger" not so much "through the effects of … our vices upon them" as "what may be called the virtues of our civilisation."

==Proponents ==
[[Image:Herbert Spencer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Herbert Spencer]]]]
Herbert Spencer's ideas, like those of evolutionary progressivism, stemmed from his reading of Thomas Malthus, and his later theories were influenced by those of Darwin. However, Spencer's major work, ''Progress: Its Law and Cause'' (1857), was released two years before the publication of Darwin's ''On the Origin of Species'', and ''First Principles'' was printed in 1860.

In ''The Social Organism'' (1860), Spencer compares society to a living organism and argues that, just as biological organisms evolve through natural selection, society evolves and increases in complexity through analogous processes.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Herbert. 1860. 'The Social Organism', originally published in ''The Westminster Review''. Reprinted in Spencer's (1892) ''Essays: Scientific, Political and Speculative''. London and New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many ways, Spencer's theory of cosmic evolution has much more in common with the works of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarck]] and [[Auguste Comte]]'s [[positivism]] than with Darwin's.

Jeff Riggenbach argues that Spencer's view was that culture and education made a sort of [[Lamarckism]] possible&lt;ref name=Riggenbach/&gt; and notes that Herbert Spencer was a proponent of private charity.&lt;ref name=Riggenbach/&gt; However, the legacy of his social Darwinism was less than charitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Darwin|last=Paul|first=Diane B.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-521-77197-9|location=Cambridge|pages=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thomas Robert Malthus Wellcome L0069037 -crop.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Thomas Malthus]]]]
Spencer's work also served to renew interest in the work of Malthus. While Malthus's work does not itself qualify as social Darwinism, his 1798 work ''An Essay on the Principle of Population'', was incredibly popular and widely read by social Darwinists. In that book, for example, the author argued that as an increasing population would normally outgrow its food supply, this would result in the starvation of the weakest and a [[Malthusian catastrophe]].

According to [[Michael Ruse]], Darwin read Malthus' famous ''Essay on a Principle of Population'' in 1838, four years after Malthus' death. Malthus himself anticipated the social Darwinists in suggesting that charity could exacerbate social problems.

Another of these social interpretations of Darwin's biological views, later known as eugenics, was put forth by Darwin's cousin, Francis Galton, in 1865 and 1869. Galton argued that just as physical traits were clearly inherited among generations of people, the same could be said for mental qualities (genius and talent). Galton argued that social morals needed to change so that heredity was a conscious decision in order to avoid both the over-breeding by less fit members of society and the under-breeding of the more fit ones.

[[Image:Francis Galton 1850s.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Francis Galton]]]]
In Galton's view, social institutions such as [[Social welfare provision|welfare]] and [[psychiatric hospital|insane asylums]] were allowing inferior humans to survive and reproduce at levels faster than the more "superior" humans in respectable society, and if corrections were not soon taken, society would be awash with "inferiors". Darwin read his cousin's work with interest, and devoted sections of ''Descent of Man'' to discussion of Galton's theories. Neither Galton nor Darwin, though, advocated any eugenic policies restricting reproduction, due to their Whiggish distrust of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Hodge|editor-first1=Jonathan|editor-last2=Radick|editor-first2=Gregory|last1=Paul|first1=Diane|chapter-url=http://www.dianebpaul.com/uploads/2/3/2/9/23295024/darwin_social_darwinism_and_eugenics.pdf|chapter= Darwin, social Darwinism and eugenics |title=The Cambridge companion to Darwin|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780511998690|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s philosophy addressed the question of artificial selection, yet Nietzsche's principles did not concur with Darwinian theories of natural selection. Nietzsche's point of view on sickness and health, in particular, opposed him to the concept of biological adaptation as forged by Spencer's "fitness". Nietzsche criticized Haeckel, Spencer, and Darwin, sometimes under the same banner by maintaining that in specific cases, sickness was necessary and even helpful.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Stiegler, ''Nietzsche et la biologie'', [[PUF]], 2001, p. 90. {{ISBN|2-13-050742-5}}. See, for ex., ''[[Genealogy of Morals]]'', III, 13 here [http://malaspina.edu/~johnstoi/Nietzsche/genealogy3.htm#13]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Wherever progress is to ensue, deviating natures are of greatest importance. Every progress of the whole must be preceded by a partial weakening. The strongest natures retain the type, the weaker ones help to advance it.

Something similar also happens in the individual. There is rarely a degeneration, a truncation, or even a vice or any physical or moral loss without an advantage somewhere else. In a warlike and restless clan, for example, the sicklier man may have occasion to be alone, and may therefore become quieter and wiser; the one-eyed man will have one eye the stronger; the blind man will see deeper inwardly, and certainly hear better. To this extent, the famous theory of the survival of the fittest does not seem to me to be the only viewpoint from which to explain the progress of strengthening of a man or of a race.&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'', §224&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Ernst Haeckel]]'s [[recapitulation theory]] was not Darwinism, but rather attempted to combine the ideas of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], Lamarck and Darwin. It was adopted by emerging social sciences to support the concept that non-European societies were "primitive" in an early stage of development towards the European ideal, but since then it has been heavily refuted on many fronts&lt;ref name=Gilbert&gt;{{cite web |url=http://8e.devbio.com/article.php?id=219 |title=Ernst Haeckel and the Biogenetic Law |accessdate=2008-05-03 |author=Scott F. Gilbert |year=2006 |work=Developmental Biology, 8th edition |publisher=Sinauer Associates |quote=Eventually, the Biogenetic Law had become scientifically untenable. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203072312/http://8e.devbio.com/article.php?id=219 |archivedate=2008-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Haeckel's works led to the formation of the Monist League in 1904 with many prominent citizens among its members, including the [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Wilhelm Ostwald]].

The simpler aspects of social Darwinism followed the earlier Malthusian ideas that humans, especially males, require competition in their lives in order to survive in the future. Further, the poor should have to provide for themselves and not be given any aid. However, amidst this climate, most social Darwinists of the early twentieth century actually supported better working conditions and salaries. Such measures would grant the poor a better chance to provide for themselves yet still distinguish those who are capable of succeeding from those who are poor out of laziness, weakness, or inferiority.

==Hypotheses relating social change and evolution==
{{Further|Social evolution}}
"Social Darwinism" was first described by Oscar Schmidt of the [[University of Strasbourg]], reporting at a scientific and medical conference held in Munich in 1877. He noted how socialists, although opponents of Darwin's theory, used it to add force to their political arguments. Schmidt's essay first appeared in English in ''[[Popular Science]]'' in March 1879.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=Oscar|author2=J. Fitzgerald (translator)|date=March 1879|title=Science and Socialism|journal=Popular Science Monthly|volume=14|pages=577–91|issn=0161-7370|quote=Darwinism is the scientific establishment of inequality|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; There followed an anarchist tract published in Paris in 1880 entitled "Le darwinisme social" by [[Émile Gautier]]. However, the use of the term was very rare—at least in the English-speaking world (Hodgson, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;but see {{cite journal |last=Wells |first=D. Collin |year=1907 |title=Social Darwinism |journal=[[American Journal of Sociology]] |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=695–716 |jstor=2762378 |doi=10.1086/211544}}&lt;/ref&gt;—until the American historian Richard Hofstadter published his influential ''Social Darwinism in American Thought'' (1944) during [[World War II]].

Hypotheses of social evolution and [[Sociocultural evolution|cultural evolution]] were common in Europe. The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers who preceded Darwin, such as [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], often argued that societies progressed through stages of increasing development. Earlier thinkers also emphasized conflict as an inherent feature of social life. [[Thomas Hobbes]]'s 17th century portrayal of the [[state of nature]] seems analogous to the competition for natural resources described by Darwin. Social Darwinism is distinct from other theories of social change because of the way it draws Darwin's distinctive ideas from the field of biology into social studies.

Darwin, unlike Hobbes, believed that this struggle for natural resources allowed individuals with certain physical and mental traits to succeed more frequently than others, and that these traits accumulated in the population over time, which under certain conditions could lead to the descendants being so different that they would be defined as a new species.

However, Darwin felt that "social [[instinct]]s" such as "sympathy" and "[[moral philosophy|moral sentiments]]" also evolved through natural selection, and that these resulted in the strengthening of societies in which they occurred, so much so that he wrote about it in ''Descent of Man'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;The following proposition seems to me in a high degree probable—namely, that any animal whatever, endowed with well-marked social instincts, the parental and filial affections being here included, would inevitably acquire a moral sense or conscience, as soon as its intellectual powers had become as well, or nearly as well developed, as in man. For, firstly, the social instincts lead an animal to take pleasure in the society of its fellows, to feel a certain amount of sympathy with them, and to perform various services for them.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Descent of Man/Chapter IV|Descent of Man, chapter 4]] {{ISBN|1-57392-176-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Regional distribution ==

===United States===
Spencer proved to be a popular figure in the 1880s primarily because his application of evolution to areas of human endeavor promoted an optimistic view of the future as inevitably becoming better. In the United States, writers and thinkers of the [[gilded age]] such as [[Edward L. Youmans]], [[William Graham Sumner]], [[John Fiske (philosopher)|John Fiske]], [[John Burgess (political scientist)|John W. Burgess]], and others developed theories of social evolution as a result of their exposure to the works of Darwin and Spencer.

In 1883, Sumner published a highly influential pamphlet entitled "What Social Classes Owe to Each Other", in which he insisted that the social classes owe each other nothing, synthesizing Darwin's findings with free enterprise Capitalism for his justification.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} According to Sumner, those who feel an obligation to provide assistance to those unequipped or under-equipped to compete for resources, will lead to a country in which the weak and inferior are encouraged to breed more like them, eventually dragging the country down. Sumner also believed that the best equipped to win the struggle for existence was the American businessman, and concluded that taxes and regulations serve as dangers to his survival. This pamphlet makes no mention of Darwinism, and only refers to Darwin in a statement on the meaning of liberty, that "There never has been any man, from the primitive barbarian up to a Humboldt or a Darwin, who could do as he had a mind to."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/18603/18603-h/18603-h.htm|title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of What Social Classes Owe To Each Other, by William Graham Sumner.|author=|date=2006-06-16|website=www.gutenberg.org|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sumner never fully embraced Darwinian ideas, and some contemporary historians do not believe that Sumner ever actually believed in social Darwinism.&lt;ref&gt;"&lt;cite&gt;A careful reading of the theories of Sumner and Spencer exonerates them from the century-old charge of social Darwinism in the strict sense of the word. They did not themselves advocate the application of Darwin's theory of natural selection.&lt;/cite&gt;" [https://books.google.com/books?id=7BJUIOnC534C&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=bannister+social+darwinism The Social Meaning of Modern Biology: From Social Darwinism to Sociobiology]&lt;/ref&gt; The great majority of American businessmen rejected the anti-philanthropic implications of the theory. Instead they gave millions to build schools, colleges, hospitals, art institutes, parks and many other institutions. [[Andrew Carnegie]], who admired Spencer, was the leading philanthropist in the world (1890–1920), and a major leader against imperialism and warfare.&lt;ref&gt;"At least a part—and sometimes a generous part" of the great fortunes went back to the community through many kinds of philanthropic endeavor, says {{cite book |first=Robert H. |last=Bremner |title=American Philanthropy |location= |publisher= |edition=2nd |year=1988 |isbn=978-0-226-07324-8 |page=86 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xRIodAUj1-wC&amp;pg=PA86 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[H. G. Wells]] was heavily influenced by Darwinist thoughts, and novelist [[Jack London]] wrote stories of survival that incorporated his views on social Darwinism.&lt;ref&gt;"&lt;cite&gt;Borrowing from Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, social Darwinists believed that societies, as do organisms evolve over time. Nature then determined that the strong survive and the weak perish. In Jack London's case, he thought that certain favored races were destined for survival, mainly those that could preserve themselves while supplanting others, as in the case of the White race.&lt;/cite&gt;" [http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/London/Essays/philosophy.html The philosophy of Jack London] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027154902/http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/London/Essays/philosophy.html |date=2005-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Film director]] [[Stanley Kubrick]] has been described as having held social Darwinist opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Herr |first1=Michael |title=Kubrick |publisher=Grove Press |isbn=978-0-8021-3818-7 |page=11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1f5FeRYzQwQC&amp;pg=PA11 |accessdate=20 February 2016|year=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Eugenics in Japan}}
Social Darwinism has influenced political, public health and social movements in Japan since the late 19th and early 20th century. Social Darwinism was originally brought to Japan through the works of Francis Galton and Ernst Haeckel as well as United States, British and French Lamarkian eugenic written studies of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Eugenics in Japan: some ironies of modernity, 1883–1945 |last=Otsubo |first=S. |last2=Bartholomew |first2=J. R. |journal=Sci Context |year=1998 |volume=11 |issue=3–4 |pages=545–65 |doi=10.1017/S0269889700003203 |pmid=15168677 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eugenism as a science was hotly debated at the beginning of the 20th century, in ''Jinsei-Der Mensch'', the first eugenics journal in the empire. As Japan sought to close ranks with the west, this practice was adopted wholesale along with colonialism and its justifications.

===China===
Social Darwinism was formally introduced to China through the translation by [[Yan Fu]] of Huxley's ''Evolution and Ethics'', in the course of an extensive series of translations of influential Western thought.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Spence. ''The Search for Modern China". W.W. Norton, 1990, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vI1RRslLNSwC&amp;q=social+darwinism#v=snippet&amp;q=social%20darwinism&amp;f=false p. 301].&lt;/ref&gt; Yan's translation strongly impacted Chinese scholars because he added national elements not found in the original. He understood Spencer's sociology as "not merely analytical and descriptive, but prescriptive as well", and saw Spencer building on Darwin, whom Yan summarized thus:
::Peoples and living things struggle for survival. At first, species struggle with species; they as [people] gradually progress, there is a struggle between one social group and another. The weak invariably become the prey of the strong, the stupid invariably become subservient to the clever."&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;
By the 1920s, social Darwinism found expression in the promotion of eugenics by the Chinese sociologist [[Pan Guangdan]].
When Chiang Kai-shek started the New Life movement in 1934, he

::. . . harked back to theories of Social Darwinism, writing that "only those who readapt themselves to new conditions, day by day, can live properly. When the life of a people is going through this process of readaptation, it has to remedy its own defects, and get rid of those elements which become useless. Then we call it new life."&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', 414–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
Social evolution theories in Germany gained large popularity in the 1860s and had a strong antiestablishment connotation first. Social Darwinism allowed people to counter the connection of ''[[Relations between the Catholic Church and the state|Thron und Altar]]'', the intertwined establishment of clergy and nobility, and provided as well the idea of progressive change and evolution of society as a whole. [[Ernst Haeckel]] propagated both Darwinism as a part of natural history and as a suitable base for a modern [[World view|Weltanschauung]], a world view based on scientific reasoning in his Monist League. [[Friedrich von Hellwald]] had a strong role in popularizing it in Austria. Darwin's work served as a catalyst to popularize evolutionary thinking.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oxc_CwAAQBAJ|title=Sozialdarwinismus als wissenschaftliches Konzept und politisches Programm, in: Gangolf Hübinger (ed.), Europäische Wissenschaftskulturen und politische Ordnungen in der Moderne (1890-1970) (= Schriften des Historischen Kollegs, Kolloquien 77), München 2014, pp. 99–121.|last=Puschner|first=Uwe|date=2014|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG|isbn=9783110446784|location=|pages=|language=de|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin himself called Haeckel's connection between Socialism and Evolution through Natural Selection ''a foolish idea&amp;nbsp;prevailing''&amp;nbsp;in Germany.

A sort of aristocratic turn, the use of the struggle for life as base of social darwinism ''sensu stricto'' came up after 1900 with [[Alexander Tille]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s 1895 work Entwicklungsethik (ethics of evolution) which asked to move ''from Darwin till [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]''. Further interpretations moved to ideologies propagating a racist and hierarchical society and provided ground for the later radical versions of social Darwinism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Criticism==

Social Darwinism is often cited as an ideological justification for much of 18th/19th century European enslavement and colonization of Third World countries;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Crafting qualitative research : working in the postpositivist traditions|last=Pushkala|first=Prasad|isbn=9781317473695|location=London|oclc=904046323}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has often even found its way into the intellectual foundations of public education in neo-colonized countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://getd.libs.uga.edu/pdfs/sabrin_mohammed_201305_phd.pdf|title=Exploring the intellectual foundations of Egyptian national education|last=Sabrin|first=Mohammed|date=2013|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tacna''' is a city in southern [[Peru]] and the regional capital of the [[Tacna Region]]. A very commercially active city, it is located only {{Convert|35|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} north of the border with [[Arica y Parinacota Region]] from [[Chile]], inland from the [[Pacific Ocean]] and in the valley of the [[Caplina River]]. It is Peru's tenth most populous city.

Initially called '''San Pedro de Tacna''', it has gained a reputation for patriotism, with many monuments and streets named after heroes of Peru's struggle for independence (1821–1824) and the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879–1883). Residents of Tacna are known in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as ''{{lang|es|tacneños}}''.

==History==
[[Francisco Antonio De Zela]], a royal accountant (similar in function to a modern-day income tax auditor), initiated the push for Peruvian Independence from [[Spain]] in 1811 in Tacna, leading to a series of commemorative actions for the city, culminating in the 1828 declaration of Tacna as the "Heroic City" (''{{lang|la|La Heroica Ciudad de San Pedro de Tacna}}'') by President [[José de La Mar]].

It was the capital of the short-lived [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]] (1836–1839)

Tacna's economic prosperity attracted a wave of immigrants from [[Italy]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Today, their [[Italian Peruvian]] descendants live in the city and many of them still have Italian surnames. This era of successful commerce and agriculture ended drastically with the start of the [[War of the Pacific]].

During the war, the cities of Tacna and [[Arica, Chile|Arica]] were occupied by the [[Chilean Army]]. A peace agreement, the [[Treaty of Ancón]], was signed in [[1883]]. Under the terms of the treaty, Chile was to occupy the provinces of Tacna and Arica for ten years, after which a plebiscite was to be held to determine the region's sovereignty. [[Tacna Province (Chile)|Tacna remained under Chilean control]] for 50 years, in Chilean groups and authorities lead a [[Chilenization of Tacna, Arica and Tarapacá|campaign of Chilenization]] in an attempt to persuade the local population to abandon their Peruvian past and accept Chilean nationality.

However, Peruvian [[nationalists]] ensured that the Chilean propaganda failed and the planned plebiscite was never held. Finally, in 1929, the [[Treaty of Lima (1929)|Treaty of Lima]] was signed in which Chile kept Arica, whilst Peru reacquired Tacna and receiving $6 million indemnity and other concessions.

Some of the important persons that lived in Tacna during the Chilean administration is [[Salvador Allende]] and his [[Allende family|family]], they lived eight years in the city. Salvador lived in Tacna since he was a baby, he arrived in 1908 and he studied in the Tacna School (Liceo de Tacna).

Today, Tacna is a mostly commercial city with many immigrants from the [[Puno Region]] living there. Its economy is based on mercantile activities with the north of Chile (Arica and [[Iquique]]). Since it is part of a [[duty-free]] zone, Tacna has come to rival [[Arequipa]] as southern Peru's main business area. The city has one of the largest artifact markets in the world with imports from [[Japan]] and [[China]], and traditional Peruvian handicrafts.

==Transport==

=== Rail ===
Tacna is served by a cross-border [[standard gauge]] railway to [[Arica]], [[Chile]].

It is also the location of the [[National Railway Museum (Peru)|National Railway Museum of Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.fuse.net/peruvianrails/peruvianrails/text/southern_peru_railroads.htm Southern Peru Railroads&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air===
Tacna is served by the [[Crnl. FAP. Carlos Ciriani Santa Rosa International Airport]], with flights to [[Arequipa]] and [[Lima]].
===Road===
Tacna is also served by [[Peru Highway 1]] which heads south to [[Arica]] and north to [[Moquegua]].

==Tourist attractions==
Many monuments are located in this city, including the arch of the [[Alto de la Alianza]], which shows the significance of this town.

Other monuments include a neo-[[renaissance]] [[Tacna Cathedral|Cathedral]], [[Courthouse, Tacna|the Courthouse]], the Alameda Bolognesi Walkway and the [[Toquepala Caves|caves of Toquepala]], where [[archaeology|archaeologists]] have found some of the oldest human remains in Peru.

==Festivities==
The most important festivity in the city is the ''Semana de Tacna'' ("Tacna Week"), which runs from August 25–30.

On August 28, a large [[Flag of Peru|Peruvian flag]] is shown throughout the city during the ''{{lang|es|Paseo de la Bandera}}'', which celebrates the anniversary of the reincorporation of Tacna into Peruvian sovereignty and is one of the most important patriotic demonstrations in the whole country. This tradition started in 1901, during the Chilean occupation of Tacna, by a group of ''tacneños'' who defied the prohibition of showing Peruvian flags imposed by the Chilean authorities.

There is an agrarian and industrial fair as part of these celebrations.

In September, the festival of the [[Señor de Locumba]] is celebrated, which draws thousands of faithful people from all over the world.

==Religion==
The major religion in Tacna is [[Catholicism]]

Retrieved 30 Nov 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Tholins do not form naturally on modern-day [[Earth]], but they are found in great abundance on the surface of icy bodies in the outer [[Solar System]], and as reddish aerosols in the atmosphere of outer Solar System planets and moons.

When in the presence of water, tholins may facilitate the formation of prebiotic chemistry to take place, and has implication of the [[Abiogenesis|origins of life]] on Earth and possibly, on other planets. As particles in an atmosphere, tholins scatter light and can affect [[Planetary habitability|habitability]].

==Overview==

The term "tholin" was coined by astronomer [[Carl Sagan]] and his colleague [[Bishun Khare]] to describe the difficult-to-characterize substances they obtained in his [[Miller-Urey experiment|Miller-Urey-type experiments]] on the methane-containing gas mixtures such as those found in Titan's atmosphere.&lt;ref name="sagan1979"&gt;{{cite journal| title =Tholins: organic chemistry of interstellar grains and gas|first1=Carl |last1=Sagan |author1-link=Carl Sagan |first2=Bishun |last2=Khare |author2-link=Bishun Khare|last-author-amp=yes |doi=10.1038/277102a0 |journal=Nature |volume =277 |issue= 5692 |date= 11 January 1979 |pages =102–107 |bibcode = 1979Natur.277..102S |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v277/n5692/abs/277102a0.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their paper proposing the name "tholin" said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;For the past decade we have been producing in our laboratory a variety of complex organic solids from mixtures of the cosmically abundant gases {{chem|CH|4}}, {{chem|C|2|H|6}}, {{chem|NH|3}}, {{chem|H|2|O}}, HCHO, and {{chem|H|2|S}}. The product, synthesized by ultraviolet (UV) light or spark discharge, is a brown, sometimes sticky, residue, which has been called, because of its resistance to conventional analytical chemistry, "intractable polymer".  [...] We propose, as a model-free descriptive term, ‘tholins’ (Gk ϴὸλος, muddy; but also ϴoλòς, vault or dome), although we were tempted by the phrase ‘star-tar’.&lt;ref name="Hörst" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sagan1979" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tholins are not one specific compound but rather are descriptive of a spectrum of molecules, including [[heteropolymer]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://uanews.arizona.edu/story/bit-titan-earth-helps-search-lifes-origins A Bit of Titan on Earth Helps in the Search for Life's Origins]. Lori Stiles, ''University of Arizona''. 19 October  2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103514002346 Amino acids generated from hydrated Titan tholins: Comparison with Miller–Urey electric discharge products]. H. James Cleaves II, Catherine Neish, Michael P. Callahan, Eric Parker, Facundo M. Fernández, Jason P. Dworkin. ''Icarus''. Volume 237, 15 July 2014, Pages 182-189. {{doi|10.1016/j.icarus.2014.04.042}}&lt;/ref&gt; that give a reddish, organic surface covering on certain planetary surfaces. Sagan and Khare note "The properties of tholins will depend on the energy source used and the initial abundances of precursors, but a general physical and chemical similarity among the various tholins is evident."&lt;ref name="sagan1979" /&gt;

Some researchers in the field prefer a narrowed definition of tholins, for example S. Hörst wrote: "Personally, I try to use the word 'tholins' only when describing the laboratory-produced samples, in part because we do not really know yet how similar the material we produce in the lab is to the material found on places like Titan or Triton (or Pluto!)."&lt;ref name="Hörst" /&gt; French researchers also use the term tholins only when describing the laboratory-produced samples as analogues.&lt;ref name='Dubois 2018'&gt;[https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1807/1807.04569.pdf In situ Investigation of Neutrals Involved in the Formation of Titan Tholins].

==Formation==
[[File:Formation of tholins in Titan's upper atmosphere.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|The formation of tholins in the [[atmosphere of Titan]]]]
Tholins may be a major constituent of the [[interstellar medium]].&lt;ref name="sagan1979"/&gt; On Titan, their chemistry is initiated at high altitudes and participates in the formation of solid organic particles.&lt;ref name='Dubois 2018'/&gt; Their key elements are carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen. Laboratory infrared spectroscopy analysis of experimentally synthetized tholins has confirmed earlier identifications of chemical groups present, including primary [[amine]]s, [[nitrile]]s, and [[alkyl]] portions such as {{chem|CH|2}}/{{chem|CH|3}} forming complex disordered macromolecular solids. Laboratory tests generated complex solids formed from exposure of {{chem|N|2}}:{{chem|CH|4}} gaseous mixtures to electrical discharge in cold plasma conditions, reminiscent of the famous [[Miller–Urey experiment]] conducted in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103508002819 |title=New experimental constraints on the composition and structure of tholins |authors=Eric Quirico, Gilles Montagnac, Victoria Lees, Paul F.

Minardi, François Raulin, Bruno Reynard, Bernard Schmitt |journal=Icarus |volume=198 |issue=1 |pages=218–231 |date=November 2008 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2008.07.012|bibcode=2008Icar..198..218Q }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As illustrated to the right, tholins are thought to form in nature through a chain of chemical reactions known as [[pyrolysis]] and [[radiolysis]]. This begins with the [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] and [[ionization]] of molecular [[nitrogen]] ({{chem|N|2}}) and [[methane]] ({{chem|CH|4}}) by energetic particles and solar radiation. This is followed by the formation of [[ethylene]], [[ethane]], [[acetylene]], [[hydrogen cyanide]], and other small simple molecules and small positive ions. Further reactions form [[benzene]] and other organic molecules, and their polymerization leads to the formation of an aerosol of heavier molecules, which then condense and precipitate on the planetary surface below.&lt;ref name="Waite2007"&gt;{{Cite journal

Sagan and Khare note the presence of tholins through multiple locations: "as a constituent of the Earth's primitive oceans and therefore relevant to the [[origin of life]]; as a component of red aerosols in the atmospheres of the outer planets and Titan; present in [[comet]]s, carbonaceous chondrites asteroids, and pre-planetary solar nebulae; and as a major constituent of the [[interstellar medium]]."&lt;ref name="sagan1979" /&gt; The surfaces of comets, [[centaur (planetoid)|centaur]]s, and many icy moons and [[Kuiper belt|Kuiper-belt]] objects in the outer Solar System are rich in deposits of tholins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103515005709 Sublimation of water ice mixed with silicates and tholins: Evolution of surface texture and reflectance spectra, with implications for comets].

'''Vladimir Ivanovich Guerrier''' ({{lang-ru|Владимир Иванович Герье}}; {{OldStyleDate|29 May|1837|17 May}} – 30 June 1919) was a [[Russian Empire|Russian]] historian, professor of history at [[Moscow State University]] from 1868 to 1904. As the founder of the "[[Courses Guerrier]]", he was a leading instigator of higher education for women in Russia.

He was also a member of the [[Moscow City Duma]], the [[State Council of Imperial Russia]] and the [[Union of October 17|Octobrist Party]].

Guerrier's name is sometimes transliterated from the [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] into the [[Latin alphabet|Roman alphabet]] as '''Ger'e''', but he himself preferred '''Guerrier'''. When publishing works in [[German language|German]], he used the form '''W. I. Guerrier''' (the ''W'' representing ''Wladimir'').

==Life==
Born in 1837 in [[Khovrino District|Khovrino]], a suburb of [[Moscow]], Guerrier was descended from Huguenot immigrants to Russia who had moved from [[Hamburg]].&lt;ref&gt;O’Connor, John. ''The French Revolution in Russian Intellectual Life: 1865-1905”. Prager Publishers, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; An uncle, Jean François Guerrier, otherwise Frantz Ivanovitch Guerrier, had arrived in the time of [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great]] to work as a [[millwright]].&lt;ref name=archives&gt;Georges Dulac, S. Karp, &amp; Roland Mortier, ''Les Archives de l'Est et la France des Lumières: Guide des archives'' (2007), pp. 169-170&lt;/ref&gt; Guerrier lost both parents as  a small child and was brought up by relations as a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]]. He received his secondary education in Moscow at the parish school of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Peter and Paul on Kozmodemyansk Street, now Starosadskiy Lane. In 1854 he entered the historical-philological faculty of the Moscow State University, where he was a student of [[Timofey Granovsky|Granovsky]].&lt;ref name=novikov&gt;M. M. Novikov, ''Dvukhsotletie Moskovskogo Universiteta: prazdnovanie v Amerike'' (1956), p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Upon completing this course, he was retained by the university to prepare for a professorship, and at the same time he became a teacher of literature and history to the first Moscow Cadet Corps. In 1862, he defended his master's [[Thesis (academic document)|thesis]]: ''The struggle for the Polish throne in 1733'', and then travelled abroad, spending three years in [[Germany]], [[Italy]] and [[Paris]]. In 1865 he was elected a professor in the department of general history at Moscow University and began teaching there.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Gurko|V. I. Gurko]], ''Features and figures of the past: government and opinion in the reign of Nicholas II'' (Stanford University Press, 1939), pp. 381 &amp; 663&lt;/ref&gt; Guerrier was a lifelong friend of the [[philosopher]] [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]].&lt;ref&gt;P. W. Schrooyen, ''Vladimir Solov'ëv in the rising public sphere'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

A strong campaigner for the independence of universities,&lt;ref name=novikov/&gt; in an article in ''[[Vestnik Evropy]]'' in 1876, Guerrier expressed the opposition of most Russian university professors in attacking proposals by Liubimov to transplant important features of the German system of university education into Russia. In 1879, [[Dmitry Tolstoy|Count Dmitry Tolstoy]] abolished the professors' disciplinary courts, but the subsequent University Statute of 1884 proved unworkable and had to be repealed.&lt;ref&gt;V. I. Guerrier, 'Nauka i gosudarstvo' in ''[[Vestnik Evropy]]'', October 1876&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ben Eklof, John Bushnell, &amp; Larisa Georgievna Zakharova, ''Russia's great reforms, 1855–1881'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=g0BhZY1n5SsC&amp;pg=PA258#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 258] online at books.google.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

Guerrier was not considered an impressive public speaker. One writer has called him "prolix, fairly boring", contrasting him with a riveting performance by [[Maksim Kovalevsky|Kovalevsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Sanders, ed., ''Historiography of Imperial Russia: the Profession and Writing of History in a Multinational State'' (1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=X2zc4VYlLYsC&amp;pg=PA85#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 85] online at books.google.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Guerrier wrote in [[Russian language|Russian]], [[German language|German]], and [[French language|French]]. His study of [[Gabriel Bonnot de Mably|Mably]] and [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobinism]] appeared in French in 1886 and was published in [[Paris]],&lt;ref name=mably&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=UBlbAAAAIAAJ L'Abbé de Mably]'', brief details online at books.google.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; while a major work on [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] appeared in German.&lt;ref&gt;W. Guerrier, ''Leibniz in seinen Beziehungen zu Russland und Peter dem Grossen'' (St Petersburg, 1873)&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have suggested that he turned to the [[French Revolution]] "to stigmatize opponents of the Russian monarchy".&lt;ref&gt;Dmitry Shlapentokh, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/20007224 Forgotten predecessors: the Russian Conservative Historians of the French Revolution] in ''International Journal of Politics, Culture and Society'' vol. 9, no. 1 (1995), on jstor.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Guerrier died in 1919 and is buried in Moscow at the Pyatnitskaya cemetery.

His daughter Elena Vladimirovna Guerrier (1868–1943), who became a schoolteacher, worked also as a translator.&lt;ref name=archives/&gt;

==Higher Courses for Women==
[[File:Wiki pirogovka clinics 1.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;The Second Moscow State University&lt;/center&gt;]]
In Moscow, in 1872, with the consent of Count Dmitry Tolstoy, the Russian Minister of Education, Guerrier founded the Higher Courses for Women (''vysshie zhenskie kursy'', or "''Courses Guerrier''"), and headed them until 1905.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Vucinich, ''Science in Russian culture'' (1963), p. 53: "Encouraged by this development, Professor V I Guerrier of Moscow University obtained permission to institute a program known as the Higher Courses for Women."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Stites, ''The women's liberation movement in Russia'' (1978), [https://books.google.com/books?id=qy679HV7AmkC&amp;pg=PA81#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 81] online at books.google.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Valentine Riasanovsky, ''A History of Russia'' (Oxford University Press, 1993), p. 438&lt;/ref&gt; In his lifetime, the courses developed into the [[Second Moscow State University]].

Guerrier's concern for the education of women was primarily with training good conversationalists, mothers, and schoolteachers, and he advised one new class to avoid politics.&lt;ref&gt;Stites, ''op. cit.'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=qy679HV7AmkC&amp;pg=PA171#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 171] online&lt;/ref&gt; He showed a paternalistic attitude towards women, long after they had shown they could master university-level courses. However, after Tolstoy had refused to give graduates of the courses teaching rights, in 1876 and 1877 Guerrier petitioned the minister to change his mind, arguing that a growing number of unmarried women were without families to support them, so that there was an economic imperative for employment rights for such women.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Johanson, ''Women's struggle for higher education in Russia, 1855–1900'' (1987), [https://books.google.com/books?id=B_BfKgWKDy8C&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 48-49] online at books.google.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point there was controversy about Guerrier among the ''kursistki'', as the female students were known. The cry went up "Let's catcall Guerrier!" after it had been alleged that as director of the Higher Courses he had treated women "like an Oriental despot". This charge, described in Guerrier's defence as "an absurd and malicious slander", caused a bitter division between two rival groups of women known as the 'politicians' and the 'academics'.&lt;ref&gt;''The Russian Review'', Volumes 10-11 (1951), p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Samuel Feuer, ''The conflict of generations: the character and significance of student movements'' (1969), p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political life==
By his own account, during his student years Guerrier was a [[Political radicalism|radical]], but he began his academic career as a [[liberalism|liberal]]. After the [[assassination]] of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] on {{OldStyleDate|13 March|1881|1 March}}, he became a [[Conservatism|conservative]], with the German historian Hecker calling him "a conservative-liberal Westernizer". In 1905, he joined the [[Union of October 17|Octobrists]].&lt;ref&gt;Dmitry Shlapentokh, ''[[The French Revolution]] in Russian Intellectual Life: 1865–1905'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=awMPPDcW-bYC&amp;pg=PA44#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 44] online&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1870s, Russian liberals like Guerrier and [[Boris Chicherin|Chicherin]] accused [[Karl Marx]] of being narrowly concerned with the [[proletariat]] and indifferent to the entrepreneur's more important "psychic labour".&lt;ref&gt;Esther Kingston-Mann, ''In search of the true West: culture, economics, and problems of Russian Development'' (Princeton University Press, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=dIDOywe72mUC&amp;pg=PA130#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 130] online at books.google.com&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1876 Guerrier was active in the [[Moscow City Duma]], making social welfare his special field of expertise.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel R. Brower, ''The Russian city between tradition and modernity, 1850–1900'' (1990), p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; He was seen as a member of the "educated" group of members, and on one occasion remarked witheringly on the [[Petite bourgeoisie|petty bourgeois]] members' habits of "bowing humbly to eminent merchants", "preferring silence in debates", and "voting as their leaders told them".&lt;ref&gt;Brower, ''op. cit.'', p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the Grot Commission on help for the destitute and a founder of 'Guardianship of Work Relief'.&lt;ref&gt;Adele Lindenmeyr, ''Poverty is not a vice: charity, society, and the state in imperial Russia'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=uDi3T3kyOoQC&amp;pg=PA175#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 175] online at books.google.com&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894 he was elected to chair a committee responsible for the welfare of the poor.

In 1903, Guerrier and a colleague named Popov, as members of the City Duma, proposed that binding regulations were needed to control the exploitation of waiters and other catering staff by their employers.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry Pospielovsky, ''Russian police trade unionism: experiment or provocation?'' (1971), p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Russian Constitution of 1906]] came into effect, six members of the [[State Council of Imperial Russia|State Council]] of [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] were to be elected to it by the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], and Guerrier was one of those the Academy appointed that year.&lt;ref&gt;Harley D. Balzer, ''Russia's missing middle class: the professions in Russian history'' (1996), p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;
