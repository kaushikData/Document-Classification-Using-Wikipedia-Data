{{about|the Latin phrase|the musical group|Ad Infinitum (band)|the logic fallacy|Ad nauseam}}
'''''Ad infinitum''''' is a [[Latin]] [[List of Latin phrases|phrase]] meaning "to [[infinity]]" or "forevermore".

==Description==
In context, it usually means "continue forever, without limit" and this can be used to describe a non-terminating process, a non-terminating ''repeating'' process, or a set of instructions to be repeated "forever," among other uses. It may also be used in a manner similar to the Latin phrase ''[[et cetera]]'' to denote written words or a concept that continues for a lengthy period beyond what is shown. Examples include:

*"The [[sequence (mathematics)|sequence]] '''1, 2, 3, ...''' continues ''ad infinitum''."
*"The perimeter of a [[fractal]] may be iteratively drawn ''ad infinitum''."
*The 17th-century writer [[Jonathan Swift]] incorporated the idea of [[self-similarity]] in the following lines from his satirical poem ''On Poetry: a Rhapsody'' (1733):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
The vermin only teaze and pinch
Their foes superior by an inch.
So, naturalists observe, a flea
Has smaller fleas that on him prey;
And these have smaller still to bite 'em,
And so proceed ''ad infinitum''.
Thus every poet, in his kind,
Is bit by him that comes behind&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14353/14353-8.txt |title=On Poetry: a Rhapsody |last=Swift |first=Jonathan |year=1733 |access-date=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*The mathematician [[Augustus De Morgan]] included similar lines in his rhyme ''[[Siphonaptera (poem)|Siphonaptera]]''.&lt;ref name="Budget"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/26408/26408-h/26408-h.htm |title=A Budget of Paradoxes |last=De Morgan |first=Augustus |editor-last=Smith |editor-first=David Eugene |edition=2nd |volume=II |publication-date=1915 |page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Amazing Engine''''' was a series of [[role-playing game]] books that was published by [[TSR, Inc.]] from 1993 until 1994. It was a [[generic role-playing game system]] -
each publication employed the same minimalist generic rules, as described in the ''Amazing Engine System Guide'', but each world book had an entirely different setting or genre. [[David Cook (game designer)|David "Zeb" Cook]] was credited with the design of the game rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==History==
In 1993 [[TSR (company)|TSR]] closed down all of its subsidiary roleplaying lines, from ''[[Gamma World]]'' and ''[[Marvel Super Heroes (role-playing game)|Marvel Super Heroes]]'' to ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set|Basic D&amp;D]]'', and soon replaced these with a new universal game system released via the ''Amazing Engine System Guide'' (1993).&lt;ref name="designers"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers &amp; Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27}} ''Amazing Engine'' was a simple beginner's system, and after the initial rulebook, TSR started publishing setting books, each of which presented a different milieu to play the game in.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|27}} After 1994, ''Amazing Engine'' was cancelled as well.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|28}} ''[[Alternity]]'' was intended to be TSR's generic science-fiction system, a replacement for ''Amazing Engine''.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|284}}

==Description==
In ''Amazing Engine'', [[player characters]] are generated with a set of four core [[Statistic (role-playing games)|statistics]]. The core stats were intended to be migrated from book to book, keeping a general character design concept. These stats were then used to build random [[attribute (role-playing games)|ability scores]], basic characteristics, and [[skill (role-playing games)|skills]]. The skills have prerequisites which must first be learned. Skill checks are made using [[percentile dice]].

'''Bashing''' is a harsh, gratuitous, prejudicial attack on a person, group, or subject. [[Literal and figurative language|Literally]], bashing is a term meaning to hit or assault, but when it is used as a [[Affix|suffix]], or in conjunction with a noun indicating the subject being attacked, it is normally used to imply that the act is motivated by bigotry.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}
The term is also used [[metaphor]]ically, to describe verbal or critical assaults.  Topics which attract bashing tend to be highly [[partisan (political)|partisan]] and personally sensitive topics for the bashers, the victims, or both. Common areas include [[religion]], [[nationality]], [[Sexual orientation|sexuality]], and [[politics]].

Physical bashing is differentiated from regular assault because it is a motivated assault, which may be considered a [[hate crime]]. In relation to non-physical bashing, the term is used to imply that a verbal or critical attack is similarly unacceptable and similarly prejudicial. Use of the term in this manner is an [[ad hominem|abusive ad hominem]] action, used to denounce the attack and admonish the attackers by comparing them to perpetrators of physical bashing.

Karen Franklin, in her paper "Psychosocial motivations of hate crimes perpetrators" identifies the following motivations for bashing: socially instilled prejudice or partisan conflict; the perception that the bashing subject is in some way contrary to, or in offense to, an underlying ideology; group or peer influence.&lt;ref&gt;https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED423939.pdf {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417233212/https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED423939.pdf |date=April 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical bashing ==

One of the more common uses of the term ''bashing'' is to describe assault or vilification of people perceived to be [[homosexuality|homosexual]]. Gay-bashing is related to [[homophobia]] and  [[Religion and homosexuality|religious objections to homosexuality]].

==Non-physical bashing==
{{see also|French bashing}}
In cases of non-physical bashing, the term is normally used with the intention of having a pejorative effect on the identified bashers by comparing them to perpetrators of criminal assaults. Sometimes this label is applied to criticisms that are not particularly vehement nor even inappropriate. In these cases, the term can be seen to be applied purely for partisan benefit. The use of the term within this context is most common in editorial or personal commentary. These terms are used to imply that the criticism of these groups or individuals is excessive, too frequent, uncompromising, or inappropriate. Since politics is inherently partisan, the term bashing is frequently used to cast negative aspersions on critics for political gain.

Fans of different artistic works often accuse critics, who may be other fans, of bashing the subject or individuals upon which the fandom is centered. A common example of this on the [[internet]] is ''Lucas bashing'', where the term is used to decry criticism of [[Star Wars]] or [[George Lucas]] personally. In this case, again the motivations include partisan conflict (for or against an aspect of an artistic work); an offense to an underlying ideology (nostalgic attachment to, or immersion in, an artistic genre); and the group influence of other fans and discussion forums. There is also ''character bashing'', which happens when a part of the fandom openly criticises one or more characters in an artistic work, or even real people from media industry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22459">'''Biased competition theory''' advocates the idea that each object in the [[visual field]] competes for cortical representation and cognitive processing. &lt;ref&gt;Desimone, R., &amp; Duncan, J. (1995). Neural Mechanism of Selective Visual Attention. Annual Review of Neuroscience, 18, 193-222.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory suggests that the process of visual processing can be biased by other mental processes such as [[Top-down_and_bottom-up_design|bottom-up]] and [[Top-down_and_bottom-up_design|top-down]]  systems which prioritize certain features of an object or whole items for [[attention]] and further processing.  Biased competition theory is, simply stated, the competition of objects for processing. This competition can be biased, often toward the object that is currently attended in the visual field, or alternatively toward the object most relevant to behavior.

==History==
Research into the subject of attentional mechanisms in regard to visual perception was undertaken as an attempt to better understand the functional principles and potential constraints surrounding visual perception &lt;ref&gt;Rolls, E. T. (2008). Memory, attention and decision-making: A unified computational neuro-science approach; Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Visual search]] tasks are commonly used by experimenters to aid the exploration of visual perception.
The classical view of visual attention suggests that there are two basic principles: the pre-attentive stage and the attentive stage.&lt;ref&gt;Rolls, E. T. (2008). Memory, attention and decision-making: A unified computational neuro-science approach; Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; In the pre-attentive stage, an individual has an unlimited capacity for perception which is capable of processing information from the entire visual field concurrently. During the attentive stage, the processing of visual information corresponding to local spatial areas takes place.&lt;ref&gt;Rolls, E. T. (2008). Memory, attention and decision-making: A unified computational neuro-science approach; Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; This classical view of visual attention suggests that there is no competition within the visual field. Within this theory an individual is assumed to be capable of processing all information provided concurrently. Until recently it was still thought that individuals had a pre-attentive stage. This is no longer the case, research has now suggested that the pre-attentive stage is now limited in its capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Rolls, E. T. (2008). Memory, attention and decision-making: A unified computational neuro-science approach; Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The attentive stage of being able to process important information has now transformed into what is known as selectivity. The classical view of attention has built the ground work for the recent emergence of two new principles to benefit the understanding of visual attention. The first of these relates to the limited capacity of [[information processing]]. This suggests that at any given time, only a small amount of information can actually be retained and used to control behaviour. The principle of [[Attention#Selective attention and visual attention|selectivity]] incorporates the notion that a person has the ability to filter out unwanted information.  Koch and Ullman &lt;ref&gt;Koch C, &amp; Ullman S (1985) Shifts in selective visual attention: towards the underlying neural circuitry.  Human Neurobiology 4:219-227.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that attentive selection could be implemented by competitive "winner-takes-all" networks.
Robert Desimone and John Duncan  &lt;ref&gt;Desimone, R., &amp; Duncan, J. (1995). Neural Mechanism of Selective Visual Attention. Annual Review of Neuroscience, 18, 193-222.&lt;/ref&gt; expanded on this idea. They proposed that at some point between the visual input of objects and the response to objects in the visual field there is some competition occurring;  competition for representation, analysis, and behavior. This suggests that attention to stimuli makes more demands on processing capacity than unattended stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;Desimone, R., &amp; Duncan, J. (1995). Neural Mechanism of Selective Visual Attention. Annual Review of Neuroscience, 18, 193-222.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of competition led researchers to develop a new theory of attention, which they termed the “biased competition theory".&lt;ref&gt;Desimone, R., &amp; Duncan, J. (1995). Neural Mechanism of Selective Visual Attention. Annual Review of Neuroscience, 18, 193-222.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory attempts to provide an explanation of the processes leading visual attention and their effects on the brain’s neural systems.&lt;ref&gt;Rolls, E. T. (2008). Memory, attention and decision-making: A unified computational neuro-science approach; Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
Biased competition serves to prioritize task relevant information to make visual search more efficient.&lt;ref&gt;Desimone, R., &amp; Duncan, J. (1995).

Annual Review of Neuroscience, 18, 193-222.&lt;/ref&gt; A large amount of visual information is taken in at any given moment and there is a limited capacity available for processing. The visual system therefore needs a way to select relevant information and ignore irrelevant stimuli.
A visual search usually has a target (e.g. a coffee cup), which is being searched for (task relevant) in the visual environment, and task irrelevant information is ignored. The biasing from neural mechanisms guides the search to logical spatial locations (e.g. the table) and items that have similar semantic or visual features to the item that is being searched for.
It has been suggested that more than 30 cortical areas in the [[visual system]] are used for the processing of visual stimuli, and that there is competition from objects in the visual field that takes place in multiple areas of this extensive network.&lt;ref&gt;Desimone R, Ungerleider LG. (1989). Neural mechanisms of visual processing in monkeys. In Handbook of Neuropsychology, Vol. 2, ed. F Boller, J Grafman, pp. 267-99. New York: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baldauf14&gt;{{cite journal |author=Baldauf D, Desimone R |title=Neural mechanisms of object-based attention |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=344 |issue=6182 |pages=424–427 |date=Mar 2014 |pmid=24763592 |doi=10.1126/science.1247003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Biased Competition Model==
Desimone suggested that the Biased Competition Model comprised five main tenets:&lt;ref&gt;4.	Desimone, R. (1998). Visual attention mediated by biased competition in extrastriate visual cortex. ‘’Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B, 353’’, 1245-1255.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Objects presented simultaneously in the visual field compete for cell responses in the visual cortex. When two stimuli are presented at the same time they will activate their neuronal representations. The responses will be determined by these two stimuli interacting in a competitive manner.
# Two stimuli that activate cells in the same area of the cortex will provide the strongest competitive interactions.
# Competitive interactions have the ability to be biased in preference of one stimulus due to many different neural mechanisms. This is called feedback bias. These may include Top-down feedback (for example, one stimulus may hold more situational relevance) or Bottom-up influences (for example, one stimulus is more novel than another).
# Feedback biasing is not purely the result of spatial location. Biasing during processing can be due to a stimuli possessing specific, relevant feature. Such features may include color, texture, and shape.
# A main source of Top-down biasing derives from the structures in the brain involved with working memory, more specifically, from the [[prefrontal cortex]].

==Neural Mechanisms==
There are two major [[neural pathways]] that process the information in the visual field; the [[ventral stream]] and the [[dorsal stream]]. The two pathways run in parallel and are both working simultaneously. The ventral stream is important for object recognition and often referred to as the “what” system of the brain; it projects to the inferior temporal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;Ungerleider, L. G., &amp; Haxby, J. V. (1994). ‘What’ and ‘where’ in the human brain. Current Opinion in Neurobiology, 4, 157-165.&lt;/ref&gt; The dorsal stream is important for spatial perception and performance and is referred to as the “where” system &lt;ref&gt;Ungerleider, L. G., &amp; Haxby, J. V. (1994). ‘What’ and ‘where’ in the human brain. Current Opinion in Neurobiology, 4, 157-165.&lt;/ref&gt; which projects to the [[posterior parietal cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;Desimone, R., &amp; Duncan, J. (1995). Neural Mechanism of Selective Visual Attention. Annual Review of Neuroscience, 18, 193-222.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the biased competition theory, an individual’s visual system has limited capacity to process information about multiple objects at any given time. For example, if an individual was presented with two stimuli (objects) and was asked to identify attributes of each object at the same time, the individual’s performance would be worse in comparison to if the objects were presented separately. This suggests multiple objects presented simultaneously in the visual field will compete for neural representation due to limited processing resources.
Single cell recording studies conducted by Kastner and Ungerleider examined the neural mechanisms behind the biased competition theory.&lt;ref&gt;Kastner, S., L, G., Ungerleider. (2001). The neural basis of biased competition in human visual cortex. Neuropsychologia. 39, 1263-1276.&lt;/ref&gt; In their experiment the size of the [[receptive field]]'s (RF) of neurons within the visual cortex were examined. A single visual stimulus was presented alone in a neuron’s RF, followed with another stimulus presented simultaneously within the same RF.&lt;ref&gt;Kastner, S., L, G., Ungerleider. (2001). The neural basis of biased competition in human visual cortex. Neuropsychologia. 39, 1263-1276.&lt;/ref&gt; The single ‘effective’ stimuli produced a low [[firing rate]], whereas the two stimuli presented together produced a high firing rate. The response to the paired stimuli was reduced. This suggests that when two stimuli are presented together within a neuron’s RF, the stimuli are processed in a mutually suppressive manner, rather than being processed independently.&lt;ref&gt;Kastner, S., L, G., Ungerleider. (2001). The neural basis of biased competition in human visual cortex. Neuropsychologia. 39, 1263-1276.&lt;/ref&gt; This suppression process, according to Kastner and Ungerleider, occurs when two stimuli are presented together because they compete for neural representation, due to limited cognitive processing capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Kastner, S., L, G., Ungerleider. (2001). The neural basis of biased competition in human visual cortex. Neuropsychologia. 39, 1263-1276.&lt;/ref&gt;
The RF experiment suggests that as the number of objects increase, the information available for each object will decrease due to increased neural workload (suppression), and decreased cognitive capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Kastner, S., L, G., Ungerleider. (2001). The neural basis of biased competition in human visual cortex. Neuropsychologia. 39, 1263-1276.&lt;/ref&gt; In order for an object in the visual field or RF be efficiently processed, there needs to be a way to bias these neurological resources towards the object. Attention prioritizes task relevant objects, biasing this process. For example, this bias can be towards an object which is currently attended to in the visual field or RF, or towards the object that is most relevant to one’s behavior.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging ([[fMRI]]) has shown that biased competition theory can explain the observed attention effects at a neuronal level. Attention effects bias the internal weight (strengthens connections) of task relevant features toward the attended object. This was shown by Reddy,  Kanwisher,  and van Rullen  who found an increase in oxygenated blood to a specific neuron following a locational cue.&lt;ref&gt;Reddy, L., Kanwisher, N.G, &amp; VanRullen, R. (2009). Attention and biased competition in multiple voxel object representations. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 106, 50, 21447-21452.&lt;/ref&gt; Further neurological support comes from [[neurophysiological]] studies which have shown that attention results from Top-down biasing, which in turn influences neuronal spiking.&lt;ref&gt;Deco, G., &amp; Rolls, E.T. (2005). Neurodynamics of biased competition and cooperation for attention: A model with Spiking Neurons. Journal of Neurophysiology, 94, 295-313.&lt;/ref&gt; In sum, external inputs affect the Top-down guidance of attention, which bias specific neurons in the brain.

==Empirical Evidence for Biased Competition Theory==
Since the development of Biased Competition Theory much research has been undertaken to validate the theory’s ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, D.M., &amp; Kastner, S. (2009). Top-down and Bottom-up mechanisms in biasing competition in the human brain. ‘’Vision Research, 49’’, 1154-1165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baldauf14&gt;{{cite journal |author=Baldauf D, Desimone R |title=Neural mechanisms of object-based attention |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=344 |issue=6182 |pages=424–427 |date=Mar 2014 |pmid=24763592 |doi=10.1126/science.1247003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Research has formulated predictions based on the theoretical model to be tested in experimental settings. Top-down and Bottom-up biases have been tested in order to ascertain the legitimacy of their influence on visual perception and competition as described by Biased Competition Theory. These experiments provide evidence for the idea of feedback biasing as described in Desimone’s five central tenets.&lt;ref&gt;Desimone, R., &amp; Duncan, J. (1995). Neural Mechanism of Selective Visual Attention. Annual Review of Neuroscience, 18, 193-222.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidence of Bottom-up Process===
Bottom-up processes are characterized by an absence of higher level direction in sensory processing.  It primarily relies on sensory information and incoming sensory information is the starting point for all Bottom-up processing. Bottom-up refers to when a feature stands out in a visual search. This is commonly called the “pop-out” effect.&lt;ref&gt;Gleitman, H., &amp; Jonides, J. (1978). The effect of set on categorization in visual search. Perception &amp; Psychophysics, 24(4), 361-368.&lt;/ref&gt; Salient features like bright colors, movement and big objects make the object “pop-out” of the visual search. “Pop-out” features can often attract attention without conscious processing. Objects that stand out are often given priority (bias) in processing. Bottom-up processing is data driven, and according to this stimuli are perceived on the basis of the data which is being experienced through the senses.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psychologyconcepts.com/bottom-up-and-top-down-processing/.&lt;/ref&gt;
Evidence suggests that simultaneously presented stimuli do in fact compete in order to be represented in the [[visual cortex]], with stimuli mutually suppressing each other to gain this representation.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, D.M., &amp; Kastner, S. (2009). Top-down and bottom-up mechanisms in biasing competition in the human brain. ‘’Vision Research, 49’’, 1154-1165.&lt;/ref&gt; This was examined by Reynolds and colleagues, who looked at the size of neurons’ receptive field’s within the visual cortex. It was found that the presentation of a single stimulus resulted in a low firing rate while two stimuli presented together resulted in a higher firing rate.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, J. H., Chelazzi, L., &amp; Desimone, R. (1999). Competitive mechanisms subserve attention in macaque areas V2 and V4. Journal of Neuroscience, 19, 1736–1753.&lt;/ref&gt; Reynolds and colleagues also found that when comparing the neural response of an individually presented visual stimulus to responses gathered from simultaneously presented stimuli, the responses of the concurrent presented stimuli were less than the sum of the responses gathered when each stimuli was presented alone.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, J. H., Chelazzi, L., &amp; Desimone, R. (1999). Competitive mechanisms subserve attention in macaque areas V2 and V4. Journal of Neuroscience, 19, 1736–1753.&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that two stimuli presented together increase neural work load required for attention. This increased neural load creates suppressive processes and causes the stimuli to compete for neural representation in the brain.
Proulx and Egeth predicted that brighter objects would bias attention in favor of that object. Another prediction is that larger objects would bias the attention in favor of that object.&lt;ref&gt;Proulx, M.J., &amp; Egeth, H.E. (2008). Biased competition and visual search: the role of luminance and size contrast. Psychological Research, 72, 106-113.&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment was a computer-based visual search task, where participants searched for a target among distractions. The results of the study suggested that when irrelevant stimuli were large or bright,  attention was biased towards the irrelevant objects, prioritizing them for cognitive processing.&lt;ref&gt;Proulx, M.J., &amp; Egeth, H.E. (2008). Biased competition and visual search: the role of luminance and size contrast. Psychological Research, 72, 106-113.&lt;/ref&gt; This research shows the effects of Bottom-up (stimulus-driven) processing on biased competition theory.

===Evidence of Top-down Processes===
A Top-down process is characterized by a high level of direction of sensory processing by more cognition; Top-down processing is based on pre-existing knowledge when interpreting sensory information.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psychologyconcepts.com/bottom-up-and-top-down-processing/.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baldauf14&gt;{{cite journal |author=Baldauf D, Desimone R |title=Neural mechanisms of object-based attention |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=344 |issue=6182 |pages=424–427 |date=Mar 2014 |pmid=24763592 |doi=10.1126/science.1247003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Top-down guidance of attention refers to when the properties of an object (i.e. color, shape) are activated and held in working memory to facilitate the visual search for that object.&lt;ref&gt;Hollingworth, A., &amp; Luck, S.J. (2009). The role of visual working memory (VWM) in the control of gaze during visual search. Attention, Perception, &amp; psycho physics, 71, 4, 936-949.&lt;/ref&gt; This controls visual search by guiding attention only to objects that could be the target and avoiding attention on irrelevant objects. Top-down processes are not a complete representation of the object but are coarse, which is why objects similar in color, shape or meaning are often attended to in the process of discriminating irrelevant objects. There is evidence that observers have Top-down control over the locations that will benefit from biased competition in spatial selection visual tasks. Evidence supports that observers can make voluntary decision about which locations are selected.&lt;ref&gt;Jonides, J. (1980). Towards a model of the mind’s eye’s movement. Canadian Journal of Psychology, 34, 103–112.&lt;/ref&gt; or features that capture the attention in a stimulus-driven manner.&lt;ref&gt;Gazzaley, A., &amp; Nobre, A.C. (2012). Top-down Modulation: Bridging selective attention and working memory. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 16, 2, 129-135.&lt;/ref&gt;
Neurophysiology studies have showed that the neural mechanisms in Top-down processing are also seen in attention and working memory, suggesting Top-down processes play an important role in those functions as well.&lt;ref&gt;Hollingworth, A., &amp; Luck, S.J. (2009). The role of visual working memory (VWM) in the control of gaze during visual search. Attention, Perception, &amp; psycho physics, 71, 4, 936-949.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Top-down processes can modulate Bottom-up processes by suppressing the “pop-out” features of Bottom-up processing from distracting from the visual search.
fMRI studies have investigated the Top-down and Bottom-up processes involved in biased competition theory.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, D.M., &amp; Kastner, S. (2009). Top-down and Bottom-up mechanisms in biasing competition in the human brain. ‘’Vision Research, 49’’, 1154-1165.&lt;/ref&gt; Results of fMRI suggest that both Bottom-up and Top-down processes work in parallel to bias competition.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, D.M., &amp; Kastner, S. (2009). Top-down and bottom-up mechanisms in biasing competition in the human brain. ‘’Vision Research, 49’’, 1154-1165.&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple studies have shown that stimuli in the visual field suppress each other when presented together, but not when each stimulus is presented alone. Kastner and colleagues also found that directing attention to the specific location of a stimulus reduces the suppressive effect. Increased activity in the visual cortex was also observed; this was the result of Top-down biasing due to the favoring of the attended location.&lt;ref&gt;O’Craven, K. M., Downing, P., &amp; Kanwisher, N. (1999). fMRI evidence for objects as the units of attentional selection. Nature, 401, 584–587.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further Evidence===
Another supposition of Biased Competition Theory, that competition is integrated across multiple systems in the brain (for example, the visual system as well as working memory), is least studied.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, D.M., &amp; Kastner, S. (2009). Top-down and bottom-up mechanisms in biasing competition in the human brain. ‘’Vision Research, 49’’, 1154-1165.&lt;/ref&gt; However, empirical evidence has been undertaken to confirm the authenticity of this claim. Studies have shown this integration of differing brain systems by undertaking neuroimaging research. Activation in the middle temporal area, as well as the fusiform face area was seen when subjects were asked to attend to a moving face.&lt;ref&gt;Kastner, S., Pinsk, M., De Weerd, P., Desimone, R., &amp; Ungerleider, L. (1999). Increased activity in human visual cortex during directed attention in the absence of visual stimulation. Neuron. 22, 751-761.&lt;/ref&gt; The middle temporal area is involved in the perception of motion, while the [[fusiform face area]] is involved in facial recognition, showing the integrated systems of the brain in Biased Competition Theory.  Ferrera and Lisberger &lt;ref&gt; Ferrera V.P., &amp; Lisberger S.G. (1995) Attention and target selection for smooth pursuit eye movements.  Journal of Neuroscience 15(11);7472-7484.&lt;/ref&gt; provided evidence for competitive interactions in the selection of targets for smooth pursuit eye movements.

[[File:Blockingmiserlou.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Note the movement ratio at trial stage 3A]]
[[File:Classical conditioning - blocking.svg|thumb|right|300px|Blocking effect for mice. ''Left:'' pairings of light (CS1) and food (US) causes salivation (CR). ''Unshown:'' after training, CS1 alone causes CR. ''Mid:'' pairing of CS1, tone (CS2), and US causes CR. ''Right:'' CS2 alone doesn't trigger CR.]]
In [[Leon Kamin|Kamin]]'s '''blocking effect'''&lt;ref&gt;Kamin, L.J. (1969). Predictability, surprise, attention and conditioning. In B.A. Campbell &amp; R.M. Church (eds.), ''Punishment and aversive behavior'', 279–96, New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts&lt;/ref&gt; the [[classical conditioning|conditioning]] of an association between two stimuli, a conditioned stimulus (CS) and an unconditioned stimulus (US) is impaired if, during the conditioning process, the CS is presented together with a second CS that has already been associated with the unconditioned stimulus.

For example, an agent (such as a mouse in the figure) is exposed to a light (the first conditioned stimulus, CS1), together with food (the unconditioned stimulus, US). After repeated pairings of CS1 and US, the agent salivates when the light comes on (conditioned response, CR). Then, there are more conditioning trials, this time with the light (CS1) and a tone (CS2) together with the US.  Now, when tested, the agent does not salivate to the tone (CS2).  In other words, an association between the tone CS2 and the US has been "blocked" because the CS1–US association already exists.

This effect was most famously explained by the [[Rescorla–Wagner model]]. The model says, essentially, that if one CS (here the light) already fully predicts that the US will come, nothing will be learned about a second CS (here the tone) that accompanies the first CS. Blocking is an outcome of other models that also base learning on the difference between what is predicted and what actually happens.&lt;ref name = "Bouton" &gt; Bouton, M. E.(2007)  '' Learning and Behavior: A Contemporary Synthesis'' Sunderland, MA: Sinauer  &lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparator==
While some argue that blocking demonstrates that the organism did not learn the association between the CS2 and the US, this is not necessarily the case. For instance, after a traditional blocking paradigm, the CS2 does not elicit a response (alone). However, if the response to the CS1 is extinguished, the organism will begin to respond to CS2 alone. This demonstrates that the association between the CS2 and the US was initially learned but in comparison to the stronger predictive value of the CS1 there is no conditioned response. However, after extinction, the CS2 does have more predictive value than the now extinguished CS1.&lt;ref&gt;Blaisdell, A., Gunther, L. &amp; Miller, R. (1999). Recovery from blocking achieved by extinguishing the blocking CS. Animal Learning &amp; Behavior, 27, 63-76.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this finding was not replicated in a later, similar study.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, P. (1999). Overshadowing and blocking as acquisition deficits: No recovery after extinction of overshadowing or blocking cues. The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 52B, 307-333.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Backward blocking==
The reverse of blocking is often called backward blocking. In backward blocking, the subject is exposed to the compound stimulus (CS1 and CS2 together) first, and only later to CS1 alone. In some human and animal studies, subjects show a reduction in the association between CS2 and the US, though the effect is often weaker than the standard blocking effect, and vanishes under some conditions. This effect is not predicted by the [[Rescorla–Wagner model]] although other models have been proposed that capture this effect.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole section|date=February 2016}}

==Robustness of the effect==

Maes and colleagues reported fifteen experiments that attempted to replicate the blocking effect. None of them succeeded despite using procedures well-established in previous literature.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Blue Brain''', a Swiss national brain initiative, aims to create a digital reconstruction of the brain by [[Reverse engineering|reverse-engineering]] mammalian brain circuitry. The mission of the project, founded in May 2005 by the Brain and Mind Institute of the ''[[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]]'' (EPFL) in Switzerland, is to use biologically-detailed digital reconstructions and simulations of the mammalian brain ([[brain simulation]]) to identify the fundamental principles of brain structure and function in health and disease.

The project is headed by the founding director [[Henry Markram]], who also launched the European [[Human Brain Project]], and co-directed by [[Felix Schürmann]] and [[Sean Hill (scientist)|Sean Hill]]. Using a [[Blue Gene]] [[supercomputer]] running Michael Hines's [[Neuron (software)|NEURON software]], the simulation does not consist simply of an [[artificial neural network]], but involves a biologically realistic model of [[neuron]]s,&lt;ref name="Brainsim"&gt;Graham-Rowe, Duncan.

==Goal==

===Neocortical column modelling===
The initial goal of the project, completed in December 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluebrain.epfl.ch/Jahia/site/bluebrain/op/edit/pid/19085|title=Project Milestones|work=Blue Brain|accessdate=2008-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the simulation of a rat [[cortical column|neocortical column]], which is considered by some researchers to be the smallest functional unit of the [[neocortex]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=1569491 | pmid=15937015 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2005.1623 | volume=360 | title=The cortical column: a structure without a function | date=April 2005 | journal=Philos.

In humans, each column is about 2&amp;nbsp;mm in length, has a diameter of 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm and contains about 60,000 [[neuron]]s; [[Brown Rat|rat]] neocortical columns are very similar in structure but contain only 10,000 neurons (and 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; [[synapse]]s). Between 1995 and 2005, Markram mapped the types of neurons and their connections in such a column.

==Progress==
In November 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluebrain.epfl.ch/page18700.html|title=News and Media information|work=Blue Brain|accessdate=2008-08-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919051656/http://bluebrain.epfl.ch/page18700.html|archivedate=2008-09-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the project reported the end of the first phase, delivering a data-driven process for creating, validating, and researching the neocortical column.

By 2005, the first single cellular model was completed. The first artificial cellular neocortical column of 10,000 cells was built by 2008. By July 2011, a cellular mesocircuit of 100 neocortical columns with a million cells in total was built. A cellular rat brain is planned{{update after|2015|7|31}} for 2014 with 100 mesocircuits totalling a hundred million cells. Finally a cellular human brain is predicted possible by 2023 equivalent to 1000 rat brains with a total of a hundred billion cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/henry-markram-simulating-the-brain-next-decisive-years|title=Henry Markram: Simulating the brain; the next decisive years, video [3/3] 07:00|accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn_gEoQ8nQI#!|title=Henry Markram: Simulating the brain; the next decisive years - 07:00|accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now that the column is finished, the project is currently busying itself with the publishing of initial results in scientific literature, and pursuing two separate goals:
# construction of a simulation on the ''molecular level'',&lt;ref name="Brainsim"/&gt; which is desirable since it allows studying the effects of [[gene expression]];
# simplification of the column simulation to allow for parallel simulation of large numbers of connected columns, with the ultimate goal of simulating a whole neocortex (which in humans consists of about 1 million cortical columns).

In 2015, scientists at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) developed a quantitative model of the previously unknown relationship between the glial cell astrocytes and neurons.  This model describes the energy management of the brain through the function of the neuro-glial vascular unit (NGV).  The additional layer of neuron-glial cells is being added to Blue Brain Project models to improve functionality of the system.&lt;ref&gt;Multi-timescale Modeling of Activity-Dependent Metabolic Coupling in the Neuron-Glia-Vasculature Ensemble. PLOS Computational Biology, 2015. http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004036&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently,Blue Brain Project releases first-ever digital 3D brain cell atlas:- The Blue Brain Cell Atlas is like 'going from hand-drawn maps to Google Earth' -- providing previously unavailable information on major cell types, numbers and positions in all 737 brain regions. This comprehensive, interactive and dynamic online resource allows anyone to visualize every region in the mouse brain, cell-by-cell and in 3D, and freely download data for new analyses and modelling. It can also be continuously be updated with new findings.&lt;ref&gt;Science-Daily https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/11/181128082718.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding===
The project is funded primarily by the [[Swiss]] government and the [[Future and Emerging Technologies]] (FET) Flagship grant from the [[European Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/billion-euro-brain-simulation-and-graphene-projects-win-european-funds-1.12291|title=Billion-euro brain simulation and graphene projects win European funds|work=Nature, January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and secondarily by grants and some donations from private individuals. The [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne|EPFL]] bought the Blue Gene computer at a reduced cost because at that stage it was still a prototype and IBM was interested in exploring how different applications would perform on the machine. BBP was viewed a validation of the Blue Gene supercomputer concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technology-report.com/2009/01/blue-brain-project-ibm-has-not-withdrawn-support/|title=Blue Brain Project - IBM has not withdrawn support|work=Henry Markram, Project Director as quoted by IBM Switzerland to Technology Report on January 19, 2009| accessdate=2009-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Documentary===

A 10-part documentary is being made by film director Noah Hutton, with each installment detailing the year-long workings of the project at the EPFL. Having started filming in 2009, the documentary is planned to be released in 2020, after the years of filming and editing have finished. Regular contributions from Henry Markram and the rest of the team provide an insight into the Blue Brain Project, while similar research tasks across the world are touched on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluebrainfilm.com/bb/|title= Blue Brain Film Information}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Clean Development Mechanism''' ('''CDM''') is one of the [[Flexible Mechanisms]] defined in the [[Kyoto Protocol]] (IPCC, 2007) that provides for emissions reduction projects which generate [[Certified Emission Reduction]] units (CERs) which may be traded in [[emissions trading]] schemes.&lt;ref name=glossary&gt;{{cite web

The CDM, defined in Article 12 of the Protocol, was intended to meet two objectives: 
*(1) to assist parties not included in [[Annex I]] in achieving [[sustainable development]] and in contributing to the ultimate objective of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC), which is to [[Avoiding dangerous climate change|prevent dangerous climate change]]; and 
*(2) to assist parties included in Annex I in achieving compliance with their quantified emission limitation and reduction commitments ([[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emission caps).&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Chance LLP (2013). "Clean Development Mechanism: CDM and the UNFCC" http://a4id.org/sites/default/files/user/CDM%26UNFCCCcorrected.pdf . Advocates for International Development. Retrieved 19 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; 
"Annex I" parties are the countries listed in Annex I of the treaty, the industrialized countries. Non-Annex I parties are [[developing countries]].

The CDM addresses the second objective by allowing the Annex I countries to meet part of their emission reduction commitments under the [[Kyoto Protocol]] by buying [[Certified Emission Reduction]] units from CDM emission reduction projects in developing countries (''Carbon Trust'', 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;14).&lt;ref name=carbont/&gt; Both the projects and the issue of CERs units are subject to approval to ensure that these emission reductions are real and "additional." The CDM is supervised by the CDM Executive Board (CDM EB) under the guidance of the Conference of the Parties (COP/MOP) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

The CDM allows industrialized countries to buy CERs and to invest in emission reductions where it is cheapest globally (Grubb, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;159).&lt;ref name=grubb/&gt; Between 2001, which was the first year CDM projects could be registered and 7 September 2012, the CDM issued 1 billion [[Certified Emission Reduction]] units.&lt;ref name="giga"&gt;{{cite press release

However, a number of weaknesses of the CDM have been identified (World Bank, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;265-267){{full citation needed|date=July 2016}}. Several of these issues were addressed by the new [[Program of Activities (PoA)]], which moves to approving 'bundles' of projects instead of accrediting each project individually. In 2012, the report ''Climate Change, Carbon Markets and the CDM: A Call to Action'' said governments urgently needed to address the future of the CDM. It suggested the CDM was in danger of collapse because of the low price of carbon and the failure of governments to guarantee its existence into the future. Writing on the website of the [[Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network]], Yolanda Kakabadse, a member of the investigating panel for the report and founder of Fundación Futuro Latinamericano, said a strong CDM is needed to support the political consensus essential for future climate progress. "Therefore we must do everything in our hands to keep it working," she said.&lt;ref&gt;

==History==

The clean development mechanism is one of the "flexibility mechanisms" defined in the Kyoto Protocol. The flexibility mechanisms were designed to allow Annex B countries to meet their emission reduction commitments with reduced impact on their economies (IPCC, 2007).&lt;ref name=glossary/&gt; The flexibility mechanisms were introduced into the Kyoto Protocol by the US government. [[Developing countries]] were highly skeptical and fiercely opposed to the flexibility mechanisms (''Carbon Trust'', 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;6).&lt;ref name=carbont&gt;{{Cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; However, the international negotiations over the follow-up to the Kyoto Protocol agreed that the mechanisms will continue.

==Purpose==
The purpose of the CDM is to promote clean development in developing countries, i.e., the "non-Annex I" countries (countries that aren't listed in Annex I of the Framework Convention). The CDM is one of the Protocol's "project-based" mechanisms, in that the CDM is designed to promote projects that reduce emissions. The CDM is based on the idea of emission reduction "production" (Toth ''et al''., 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;660).&lt;ref&gt;

The baseline emissions are the emissions that are predicted to occur in the absence of a particular CDM project. CDM projects are "credited" against this baseline, in the sense that developing countries gain credit for producing these emission cuts.

The economic basis for including developing countries in efforts to reduce emissions is that emission cuts are thought to be less expensive in developing countries than developed countries (Goldemberg ''et al''., 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;30;&lt;ref name=goldemberg&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in developing countries, environmental regulation is generally weaker than it is in developed countries (Sathaye ''et al''., 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;387-389).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Emissions from developing countries are projected to increase substantially over this century (Goldemberg ''et al''., 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;29).&lt;ref name=goldemberg/&gt; Infrastructure decisions made in developing countries could therefore have a very large influence on future efforts to limit total global emissions (Fisher ''et al''., 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2010-03-18|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDM is designed to start developing countries off on a path towards less pollution, with industrialised (Annex B) countries paying for the reductions.

There were two main concerns about the CDM (Carbon Trust, 2009, pp.&amp;nbsp;14–15). One was over the [[additionality]] of emission reductions produced by the CDM (see the section on ''additionality''). The other was whether it would allow rich, northern countries, and in particular, companies, to impose projects that were contrary to the development interests of host countries. To alleviate this concern, the CDM requires host countries to confirm that CDM projects contribute to their own sustainable development. International rules also prohibit credits for some kinds of activities, notably [[nuclear power]] and avoided [[deforestation]].

To prevent industrialised countries from making unlimited use of CDM, the framework has a provision that use of CDM be ‘supplemental’ to domestic actions to reduce emissions. This wording has led to a wide range of interpretations - the Netherlands for example aims to achieve half of its required emission reductions (from a BAU baseline) by CDM.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} It treats Dutch companies' purchases of [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme]] allowances from companies in other countries as part of its domestic actions.

The CDM gained momentum in 2005 after the Kyoto Protocol took effect. Before the Protocol entered into force, investors considered this{{clarify|date=July 2016}} a key risk factor. The initial years of operation yielded fewer CDM credits than supporters had hoped for, as parties did not provide sufficient funding to the EB, which left it understaffed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The Adaptation Fund was established to finance concrete adaptation projects and programmes in developing countries that are parties to the Kyoto Protocol.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The Fund is to be financed with a share of proceeds from clean development mechanism (CDM) project activities and receive funds from other sources.

==CDM project process==

===Outline===
An industrialised country that wishes to get credits from a CDM project must obtain the consent of the developing country hosting the project and their agreement that the project will contribute to sustainable development. Then, using methodologies approved by the CDM Executive Board (EB), the applicant industrialised country must make the case that the [[carbon project]] would not have happened anyway (establishing [[additionality]]), and must establish a baseline estimating the future emissions in absence of the registered project. The case is then validated by a third party agency, called a Designated Operational Entity (DOE), to ensure the project results in real, measurable, and long-term emission reductions. The EB then decides whether or not to register (approve) the project. If a project is registered and implemented, the EB issues credits, called [[Certified Emission Reduction]]s (CERs, commonly known as [[carbon credit]]s, where each unit is equivalent to the reduction of one metric tonne of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e, e.g. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or its equivalent), to project participants based on the monitored difference between the baseline and the actual emissions, verified by the DOE.

===Additionality===

To avoid giving credits to projects that would have happened anyway ("freeriders"), specified rules ensure the [[additionality]] of the proposed project, that is, ensure the project reduces emissions more than would have occurred in the absence of the intervention created by the CDM.&lt;ref name="Gillenwater, M"&gt;

 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; At present, the CDM Executive Board deems a project additional if its proponents can document that realistic alternative scenarios to the proposed project would be more economically attractive or that the project faces barriers that CDM helps it overcome. Current Guidance from the EB is available at the UNFCCC website.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
|url=http://cdm.unfccc.int/Reference/tools/index.html
|title=UNFCCC Tools
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baseline===

{{refimprove section|date=April 2010}}

The determination of [[additionality]] and the calculation of emission reductions depends on the emissions that would have occurred without the project minus the emissions of the project. Accordingly, the CDM process requires an established baseline or comparative emission estimate. The construction of a project baseline often depends on hypothetical scenario modeling, and may be estimated through reference to emissions from similar activities and technologies in the same country or other countries, or to actual emissions prior to project implementation. The partners involved in the project could have an interest in establishing a baseline with high emissions, which would yield a risk of awarding spurious credits. Independent third party verification is meant to avoid this potential problem.

===Methodologies===

Any proposed CDM project has to use an approved baseline and monitoring methodology to be validated, approved and registered. Baseline Methodology will set steps to determine the baseline within certain applicability conditions whilst monitoring methodology will set specific steps to determine monitoring parameters, quality assurance, equipment to be used, in order to obtain data to calculate the emission reductions. Those approved methodologies are all coded:&lt;ref name=UNFCCCMETHBOOK&gt;http://cdm.unfccc.int/methodologies/documentation/meth_booklet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''AM''' - Approved Methodology

'''ACM''' - Approved Consolidated Methodology

'''AMS''' - Approved Methodology for Small Scale Projects

'''ARAM''' - Aforestation and Reforestation Approved Methodologies

All baseline methodologies approved by Executive Board are publicly available along with relevant guidance on the UNFCCC CDM website.&lt;ref&gt;http://unfccc.int/cdm&lt;/ref&gt; If a DOE determines that a proposed project activity intends to use a new baseline methodology, it shall, prior to the submission for registration of this project activity, forward the proposed methodology to the EB for review, i.e. consideration and approval, if appropriate.&lt;ref name="CDMCharts0511"&gt;Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (May, 2011) CDM in Charts Version 13.1, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==

According to Burniaux ''et al''., 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;37, crediting mechanisms like the CDM could play three important roles in [[climate change mitigation]] :&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

*Improve the cost-effectiveness of GHG mitigation policies in developed countries
*Help to reduce "leakage" ([[carbon leakage]]) of emissions from developed to developing countries. Leakage is where mitigation actions in one country or economic sector result in another country's or sector's emissions increasing, e.g., through relocation of polluting industries from Annex I to non-Annex I countries (Barker ''et al.'', 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

*Boost transfers of clean, less polluting technologies to developing countries.

According to Burniaux ''et al''. (2009, p.&amp;nbsp;37), the cost-saving potential of a well-functioning crediting mechanism appears to be very large. Compared to baseline costs (i.e., costs where emission reductions only take place in Annex I countries), if the cap on offset use was set at 20%, one estimate suggests mitigation costs could be halved. This cost saving, however, should be viewed as an upper bound: it assumes no transaction costs and no uncertainty on the delivery of emission savings. Annex I countries who stand to gain most from crediting include Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. In this economic model, non-Annex I countries enjoy a slight income gain from exploiting low cost emission reductions.
Actual transaction cost in the CDM are rather high, which is problematic for smaller projects.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank, 2010, States and Trend of the Carbon Market http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTCARBONFINANCE/Resources/State_and_Trends_of_the_Carbon_Market_2010_low_res.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This issue is addressed by the [[Program of Activities (PoA)]] modality.

===Difficulties with the CDM===

'''Carbon leakage'''

In theory, leakage may be reduced by crediting mechanisms (Burniaux ''et al.'', 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;38). In practice, the amount of leakage partly depends on the definition of the baseline against which credits are granted. The current CDM approach already incorporates some leakage. Thus, reductions in leakage due to the CDM may, in fact, be small or even non-existent.

'''Additionality, transaction costs and bottlenecks'''

In order to maintain the environmental effectiveness of the Kyoto Protocol, emission savings from the CDM must be additional (World Bank, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;265).&lt;ref name=wdr&gt;{{cite web
|year=2010

|url=http://go.worldbank.org/BKLQ9DSDU0
|accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without additionality, the CDM amounts to an income [[transfer payment|transfer]] to non-Annex I countries (Burniaux ''et al''., 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;40). Additionality is, however, difficult to prove, the subject of vigorous debate.&lt;ref name="Gillenwater, M"/&gt;

Burniaux ''et al''. (2009) commented on the large [[transaction cost]]s of establishing additionality. Assessing additionality has created delays (bottlenecks) in approving CDM projects. According to the [[World Bank]] (2010), there are significant constraints to the continued growth of the CDM to support mitigation in developing countries.

'''Incentives'''

The CDM rewards emissions reductions, but does not penalize emission increases (Burniaux ''et al''., 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;41). It therefore comes close to being an emissions reduction [[subsidy]]. This can create a [[perverse incentive]] for firms to raise their emissions in the short-term, with the aim of getting credits for reducing emissions in the long-term.

Another difficulty is that the CDM might reduce the incentive for non-Annex I countries to cap their emissions. This is because most developing countries benefit more from a well-functioning crediting mechanism than from a world [[carbon emission trading|emissions trading]] scheme (ETS), where their emissions are capped. This is true except in cases where the allocation of emissions rights (i.e., the amount of emissions that each country is allowed to emit) in the ETS is particularly favourable to developing countries.

'''Local resistance'''

While the C in CDM stands for Clean, most projects might be better defined with the B from Big, from large hydropower to HFC or waste to energy and clean coal projects (which all together make the majority of credits generated through CDM). The argument in favor of the CDM is that it brings development to the South. However, in all continents the mainly Big Development it stands for is resisted by local people in those countries. A global coalition of researchers published a large report on African civil society resistance to CDM projects all over the continent.&lt;ref&gt;18th of April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In New Delhi, India, a grassroots movement of wastepickers is resisting another CDM project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejolt.org/2012/02/watch-a-gaia-ejolt-video-on-waste-wars-in-delhi/|title=Watch a GAIA-EJOLT video on Waste Wars in Delhi - Environmental Justice Organisations, Liabilities and Trade|author=|date=|website=www.ejolt.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; on what the makers call 'the waste war' in Delhi.

&lt;/ref&gt; Civil society groups and researchers in both North and South have complained for years that most CDM projects benefit big industries, while doing harm to excluded people. As local protests against CDM projects are arising on every continent, the notion that CDM 'brings development to the South' is contested.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

'''Market deflation'''

Most of the [[demand]] for CERs from the CDM comes from the [[European Union Emissions Trading Scheme]], which is the largest carbon market. In July 2012, the [[market price]] for CERs fell to new record low of €2.67 a tonne, a drop in price of about 70% in a year. Analysts attributed the low CER price to lower prices for European Union emissions allowances, oversupply of EU emissions allowances and the slowing European economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, ''The Economist'' described the CDM as a "complete disaster in the making" and "in need of a radical overhaul". Carbon prices, including prices for CERs, had collapsed from $20 a tonne in August 2008 to below $5 in response to the [[European debt crisis|Eurozone debt crisis]] reducing industrial activity and the over-allocation of emission allowances under the [[European Union Emissions Trading Scheme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Financial issues==
With costs of emission reduction typically much lower in developing countries than in industrialised countries, industrialised countries can comply with their emission reduction targets at much lower cost by receiving credits for emissions reduced in developing countries as long as administration costs are low.

The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] has projected GDP losses for [[OECD]] Europe with full use of CDM and [[Joint Implementation]] to between 0.13% and 0.81% of GDP versus 0.31% to 1.50%&lt;ref&gt;Climate Change 2001 - Synthesis report. Figure SPM-8, IPCC, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; with only domestic action.

While there would always be some cheap domestic emission reductions available in Europe, the cost of switching from coal to gas could be in the order of €40-50 per tonne CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent. [[Certified Emission Reduction]]s from CDM projects were in 2006 traded on a forward basis for between €5 and €20 per tonne CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent. The price depends on the distribution of risk between seller and buyer. The seller could get a very good price if it agrees to bear the risk that the project's baseline and monitoring methodology is rejected; that the host country rejects the project; that the CDM Executive Board rejects the project; that the project for some reason produces fewer credits than planned; or that the buyer doesn't get CERs at the agreed time if the international transaction log (the technical infrastructure ensuring international transfer of carbon credits) is not in place by then. The seller can usually only take these risks if the [[counterparty]] is deemed very reliable, as rated by international rating agencies.

===Mitigation finance===

The revenues of the CDM constitutes the largest source of mitigation finance to developing countries to date (World Bank, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;261-262).&lt;ref name=wdr/&gt; Over the 2001 to 2012 period, CDM projects could raise $18&amp;nbsp;billion ($15&amp;nbsp;billion to $24&amp;nbsp;billion) in direct carbon revenues for developing countries. Actual revenues will depend on the price of carbon. It is estimated that some $95&amp;nbsp;billion in clean energy investment benefitted from the CDM over the 2002-08 period.

===Adaptation finance===

The CDM is the main source of income for the [[UNFCCC]] Adaptation Fund, which was established in 2007 to finance concrete adaptation projects and programmes in developing countries that are parties to the Kyoto Protocol (World Bank, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;262-263).&lt;ref name=wdr/&gt; The CDM is subject to a 2% levy, which could raise between $300&amp;nbsp;million and $600&amp;nbsp;million over the 2008-12 period. The actual amount raised will depend on the carbon price.

The EU ETS allowed firms to comply with their commitments by buying offset credits, and thus created a perceived value to projects. The Kyoto Protocol set the CDM on a firm legal footing.

By the end of 2008, over 4,000 CDM projects had been submitted for validation, and of those, over 1,000 were registered by the CDM Executive Board, and were therefore entitled to be issued CERs (Carbon Trust, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;19). In 2010, the World Bank estimated that in 2012, the largest potential for production of CERs would be from China (52% of total CERs) and India (16%) (World Bank, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;262).&lt;ref name=wdr/&gt; CERs produced in Latin America and the Caribbean would make up 15% of the potential total, with Brazil as the largest producer in the region (7%).

=== Destruction of HFC-23 ===

Some CDM projects remove or destroy industrial gases, such as [[Fluoroform|hydrofluorocarbon-23]] (HFC-23) and nitrous oxide (N2O). HFC-23 is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) and is a byproduct from the production of the refrigerant gas [[chlorodifluoromethane]] (HCFC-22).&lt;ref name=carbont/&gt; The gas HFC-23 is estimated to have a global warming effect 11,000 times greater than carbon dioxide, so destroying a tonne of HFC-23 earns the refrigerant manufacturer 11,000 certified emissions reduction units.&lt;ref name="chill1"&gt;{{cite news

In 2009, the Carbon Trust estimated that industrial gas projects such as those limiting HFC-23 emissions, would contribute about 20% of the CERs issued by the CDM in 2012. The Carbon Trust expressed the concern that projects for destroying HFC-23 were so profitable that coolant manufacturers could be building new factories to produce the coolant gas. (Carbon Trust, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;60).&lt;ref name=carbont/&gt; In September 2010, [[Sandbag]] estimated that in 2009 59% of the CERs used as offsets in the [[European Union Emissions Trading Scheme]] originated from HFC-23 projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

From 2005 to June 2012, 19 manufacturers of refrigerants (11 in China, 5 in India, and one each in Argentina, Mexico and South Korea),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

David Hanrahan, the technical director of IDEAcarbon believes each plant would probably have earned an average of $20 million to $40 million a year from the CDM. The payments also incentivise the increased production of the ozone-depleting refrigerant HCFC-22, and discourage substitution of HCFC-22 with less harmful refrigerants.&lt;ref name="chill1" /&gt;

In 2007 the CDM stopped accepting new refrigerant manufacturers into the CDM. In 2011, the CDM renewed contracts with the nineteen manufacturers on the condition that claims for HFC-23 destruction would be limited to 1 percent of their coolant production. However, in 2012, 18 percent of all CERs issued are expected to go to the 19 coolant plants, compared with 12 percent to 2,372 wind power plants and 0.2 percent to 312 solar projects.&lt;ref name="chill1"/&gt;

In January 2011, the [[European Union]] Climate Change Committee banned the use of HFC-23 CERs in the [[European Union Emissions Trading Scheme]] from 1 May 2013. The ban includes nitrous oxide (N2O) from adipic acid production. The reasons given were the perverse incentives, the lack of additionality, the lack of environmental integrity, the under-mining of the [[Montreal Protocol]], costs and ineffectiveness and the distorting effect of a few projects in advanced [[developing countries]] getting too many CERs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Barriers==

World Bank (n.d., p.&amp;nbsp;12) described a number of barriers to the use of the CDM in [[least developed countries]] (LDCs).&lt;ref name=wbnd/&gt; LDCs have experienced lower participation in the CDM to date. Four CDM decisions were highlighted as having a disproportionate negative impact on LDCs:
*'''Suppressed demand''': Baseline calculations for LDCs are low, meaning that projects cannot generate sufficient [[carbon finance]] to have an impact.
*'''Treatment of projects that replace non-renewable biomass''': A decision taken led to essentially a halving in the emission reduction potential of these projects. This has particularly affected [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and projects in poor communities, where firewood, often from non-renewable sources, is frequently used as a fuel for cooking and heating.
*'''Treatment of forestry projects and exclusion of agriculture under the CDM''': These sectors are more important for LDCs than for middle-income countries. Credits from forestry projects are penalized under the CDM, leading to depressed demand and price.
*'''Transaction costs and CDM process requirements''': These are geared more towards the most advanced developing countries, and do not work well for the projects most often found in LDCs.

==Views on the CDM==

===Additionality===

====Emissions====

One of the difficulties of the CDM is in judging whether or not projects truly make additional savings in GHG emissions (Carbon Trust, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;54-56).&lt;ref name=carbont/&gt; The baseline which is used in making this comparison is not observable. According to the Carbon Trust (2009), some projects have been clearly additional: the fitting of equipment to remove HFCs and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Some low-carbon electricity supply projects were also thought to have displaced coal-powered generation. Carbon Trust (2009) reviewed some approved projects. In their view, some of these projects had debatable points in their [[additionality]] assessments. They compared establishing [[additionality]] to the balance of evidence in a legal system. Certainty in additionality is rare, and the higher the proof of additionality, the greater the risk of rejecting good projects to reduce emissions.

====Types====

Additionality is much contested. There are many rival interpretations of additionality:

# What is often labelled ‘environmental additionality’ has that a project is additional if the emissions from the project are lower than the baseline. It generally looks at what would have happened without the project.
# Another interpretation, sometimes termed ‘project additionality’, the project must not have happened without the CDM.

A number of terms for different kinds of additionality have been discussed, leading to some confusion, particularly over the terms 'financial additionality' and 'investment additionality' which are sometimes used as synonyms. 'Investment additionality', however, was a concept discussed and ultimately rejected during negotiation of the Marrakech Accords. Investment additionality carried the idea that any project that surpasses a certain risk-adjusted profitability threshold would automatically be deemed non-additional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vrom.nl/pagina.html?id=37532|title=VROM (Netherlands Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment|author=|date=|website=vrom.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Financial additionality' is often defined as an economically non-viable project becoming viable as a direct result of CDM revenues.

Many investors argue that the environmental additionality interpretation would make the CDM simpler. Environmental NGOs have argued that this interpretation would open the CDM to free-riders, permitting developed countries to emit more CO&lt;sub&gt;2e&lt;/sub&gt;, while failing to produce emission reductions in the CDM host countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalrivers.org/node/2326 Failed Mechanism: Hundreds of Hydros Expose Serious Flaws in the CDM]; International Rivers; December 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Gillenwater (2011) evaluated the various definitions of [[additionality]] used within the CDM community and provided a synthesis definition that rejects the notion of there being different types of additionality.&lt;ref name="Gillenwater, M"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gillenwater, M. |title=What Is Additionality?

Schneider (2007) produced a report on the CDM for the WWF.&lt;ref name=schneider&gt;{{Cite web

|title=Is the CDM fulfilling its environmental and sustainable development objectives? An evaluation of the CDM and options for improvement

|accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings of the report were based on a systematic evaluation of 93 randomly chosen registered CDM projects, as well as interviews and a literature survey (p.&amp;nbsp;5). According to Schneider (2007, p.&amp;nbsp;72), the additionality of a significant number of projects over the 2004-2007 period seemed to be either unlikely or questionable.

It is never possible to establish with certainty what would have happened without the CDM or in absence of a particular project, which is one common objection to the CDM. Nevertheless, official guidelines have been designed to facilitate uniform assessment,&lt;ref&gt;Tool for the demonstration and assessment of additionality (Version 03), UNFCCC CDM EB, EB 29&lt;/ref&gt; set by the CDM Executive Board for assessing additionality.

====Views on additionality====

An argument against additionality is based on the fact that developing countries are not subject to emission caps in the Kyoto Protocol (Müller, 2009, pp.&amp;nbsp;''iv'',&amp;nbsp;9-10).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
|date=March 2009

|df=
}}&lt;/ref&gt; On these basis, "business-as-usual" (BAU) emissions (i.e., emissions that would occur without any efforts to reduce them) in developing countries should be allowed. By setting a BAU baseline, this can be interpreted as being a target for developing countries. Thus, it is, in effect, a restriction on their right to emit without a cap. This can be used as an argument against having additionality, in the sense that non-additional (i.e., emission reductions that would have taken place under BAU) emission reductions should be credited.

Müller (2009) argued that compromise was necessary between having additionality and not having it. In his view, additionality should sometimes be used, but other times, it shouldn't.

According to World Bank (n.d., pp.&amp;nbsp;16–17), additionality is crucial in maintaining the environmental integrity of the carbon market.&lt;ref name=wbnd&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; To maintain this integrity, it was suggested that projects meeting or exceeding ambitious policy objectives or technical standards could be deemed additional.

===Concerns===

====Overall efficiency====
Pioneering research has suggested that an average of approximately 30% of the money spent on the open market buying CDM credits goes directly to project operating and capital expenditure costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbonretirement.com/project-offsetting-costs|title=Carbon Retirement report: The Efficiency of Carbon Offsetting through the Clean Development Mechanism|date=2009-12-07|accessdate=2011-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kahya|first=Damian|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8399740.stm|title='30% of carbon offsets' spent on reducing emissions|publisher=BBC News|date=2009-12-07|accessdate=2011-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other significant costs include the broker's premium (about 30%, understood to represent the risk of a project not delivering) and the project shareholders' dividend (another 30%). The researchers noted that the sample of projects studied was small, the range of figures was wide and that their methodology of estimating values slightly overstated the average broker's premium.

====The risk of fraud====
One of the main problems concerning CDM-projects is the risk of fraud.&lt;ref name="VODO"&gt;{{cite web|last=VODO vzw &amp; 11.11.11|title=CDM: schoon genoeg? Vlaams en federaal CDM-beleid onder de loep|url=http://www.vodo.be/index.php/component/content/article/2-vodo/132-cdm-schoon-genoeg-vlaams-en-federaal-cdm-beleid-onder-de-loep-.html|publisher=Vlaams Overleg Duurzame Ontwikkeling|accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Despines"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Despines, M. |author2=Bullock, S. |author3=Childs, M. |author4=Picken, T |last-author-amp=yes |title=A dangerous distraction: Why offsets are a mistake the U.S. can't afford to make|url=http://www.foe.org/sites/default/files/A_Dangerous_Distraction_US.pdf|publisher=Friends of the Earth|accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schneider|first=L.|title=Is the CDM fulfilling its environmental and sustainable development objectives? An evaluation of the CDM and options for improvement|url=http://www3.oeko.de/oekodoc/622/2007-162-en.pdf|publisher=Institute for Applied Ecology|accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common practices are covering up the fact that the projects are [[Clean Development Mechanism#Types|financially viable]] by themselves and that the [[carbon offset|emission reductions]] acquired through the CDM-project aren’t [[additionality|additional]]. Exaggerating the carbon benefits is also a common practice, just as [[carbon leakage]]. Sometimes a company even produces more to receive more [[Certified emission reduction|CERs]].

Most of the doubtful projects are [[Clean Development Mechanism#Industrial gas projects|Industrial gas projects]]. Even though only 1.7% of all CDM-projects can be qualified as such, extraordinarily they account for half&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite web |work=Reuters |date= 14 October 2011 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/14/us-carbon-price-snapanalysis-idUSTRE79D33W20111014 |title=Analysis: U.N. carbon price set to fall further |author1=Nina Chestney |author2=John McGarrity }}&lt;/ref&gt; to 69%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNEP Risø Centre|title=CDM projects grouped in types|url=http://cdmpipeline.org/cdm-projects-type.htm|publisher=CDMPipeline.org|accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of all CERs that have been issued, contributing to a collapse in the global market for all CERs.&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt; Since the cost of dismantling these gases is very low compared to the market price of the CERs, very large profits can be made by companies setting up these projects.&lt;ref name="Schneider et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schneider|first=L.|author2=Lazarus, M. |author3=Kollmuss, A |title=Industrial N2O Projects Under the CDM: Adipic Acid - A Case of Carbon Leakage?|journal=Stockholm Environment Institute Working Paper WP-US-1006|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the CDM has become a stimulus for [[carbon leakage]], or even to simply produce more.&lt;ref name="Despines" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schneider et al" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wara"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wara|first=M. W.|author2=Victor, D.

[[Clean Development Mechanism#Hydropower|Hydro-projects]] are also quite problematic. Barbara Haye calculated that more than a third of all hydro-projects recognized as a CDM-project ‘were already completed at the time of registration and almost all were already under construction’,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haye|first=B.|title=Failed mechanism: How the CDM is subsidizing hydro developers and harming the Kyoto Protocol|journal=Internationalrivers.org|date=November 2007|url=http://www.internationalrivers.org/files/Failed_Mechanism_3.pdf|accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means that CERs are issued for projects that aren’t additional, which again indirectly leads to higher emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=International Rivers|title=Failed Mechanism: Hundreds of Hydros Expose Serious Flaws in the CDM|url=http://www.internationalrivers.org/node/2326|publisher=Internationalrivers.org|accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, most of the proposed carbon benefits of these projects are exaggerated.&lt;ref name="Despines" /&gt;

Why are these projects approved by the Clean_Development_Mechanism Executive Board (EB)?’, one might wonder. One of the main problems is that the EB is a highly politicized body. People taking a place in the board aren’t independent technocrats, but are elected as representatives of their respective countries. They face pressure from their own &amp; other (powerful) countries, the [[World Bank]] (that subsidizes certain projects), and other lobbying organisations. This, combined with a lack of transparency regarding the decisions of the board leads to the members favouring political-economical over technical or scientific considerations.&lt;ref name="VODO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wara" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Flues"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Flues|first=F.|author2=Michaelowa, A. |author3=Michaelowa, K |title=UN approval of greenhouse gas emission reduction projects in developing countries: The political economy of the CDM Executive Board|journal=CIS Working Paper|year=2008|issue=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seems clear that the CDM isn’t governed according to the rules of ‘[[good governance]]’. Solving this problem might require a genuine democratization in the election of the EB-members and thus a shift in thinking from government to [[environmental governance|governance]]. In practice this would mean that all the [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] should get a voice in who can have a seat in the EB.

Another important factor in the dysfunctionality of the EB is the lack of time, staff and financial resources it has to fully evaluate a project proposal.&lt;ref name="Despines" /&gt; Moreover, the verification of a project is often outsourced to companies that also deliver services (such as accounting or consultancy) to enterprises setting up these same projects. In this way, the verifiers have serious incentives to deliver a positive report to the EB.&lt;ref name="VODO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Despines" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wara" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bachram|first=H.|title=Climate Fraud and Carbon Colonialism: The New Trade in Greenhouse Gases|journal=Capitalism, Nature, Socialism|year=2004|volume=15|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that implementation is the place where the shoe pinches, as usually happens in environmental issues (mostly due to a lack of funds).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=J.P.|title=Environmental governance|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|location=London|pages=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, it should be noted though that there have been indications in recent years that the EB is becoming more strict in its decisions, due to the huge criticism and the board getting more experience.&lt;ref name="Flues" /&gt;

====Exclusion of forest conservation/avoided deforestation from the CDM====
The first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol excluded forest conservation as well as avoided deforestation from the CDM for a variety of political, practical and ethical reasons.&lt;ref&gt;A New Initiative to Use Carbon Trading for Tropical Forest Conservation] William F. Laurance(2007), Biotropica 39 (1), 20–24&lt;/ref&gt; However, carbon emissions from deforestation represent 18-25% of all emissions,&lt;ref&gt;Stern, N. 2006. Stern Review of the Economics of Climate Change&lt;/ref&gt; and will account for more carbon emissions in the next five years than all emissions from all aircraft since the Wright Brothers until at least 2025.&lt;ref&gt;Forests First in the Fight Against Climate Change, Global Canopy Programme, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This means that there have been growing calls for the inclusion of forests in CDM schemes for the second commitment period from a variety of sectors, under the leadership of the [[Coalition for Rainforest Nations]], and brought together under the [[Forests Now Declaration]], which has been signed by over 300 NGOs, business leaders, and policy makers. There is so far no international agreement about whether projects avoiding deforestation or conserving forests should be initiated through separate policies and measures or stimulated through the carbon market. One major concern is the enormous monitoring effort needed in order to make sure projects are indeed leading to increased carbon storage. There is also local opposition. For example, May 2, 2008, at the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues ([[UNPFII]]), Indigenous leaders from around the world protested against the [[Clean Energy Mechanism]]s, especially against [[Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation]].

====Reasons for including avoided deforestation projects in the CDM====

''Combating global warming has broadly two components: decreasing the release of greenhouse gases and sequestering greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. Greenhouse gas emitters, such as coal-fired power plants, are known as "sources", and places where carbon and other greenhouse gases, such as methane, can be sequestered, i.e. kept out of the atmosphere, are known as "sinks".

The world's forests, particularly rain forests, are important carbon sinks, both because of their uptake of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through photosynthesis and because of the amount of carbon stored in their woody biomass and the soil. When rain forests are logged and burned, not only do we lose the forests' capacity to take up CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere, but also the carbon stored in that biomass and soil is released into the atmosphere through release of roots from the soil and the burning of the woody plant matter.

An emerging proposal, Reduced Emissions from Avoided Deforestation and Degradation (REDD), would allow rain forest preservation to qualify for CDM project status. [[REDD]] has gained support through recent meetings of the COP, and will be examined at Copenhagen.

====Coal thermal power generation in India and China====
In July 2011, Reuters reported that a 4,000 MW coal thermal electricity generation plant in Krishnapatnam in Andhra Pradesh had been registered with the CDM. CDM Watch and the Sierra Club criticised the plant's registration and its eligibility for certified emission reduction units as clearly not additional. A CDM spokesperson dismissed these claims. According to information provided to Reuters, there are total of five coal-fired electricity plants registered with the CDM, four in India with a capacity of 10,640 MW and one 2,000 MW plant in China. The five plants are eligible to receive 68.2 million CERs over a 10-year period with an estimated value of 661 million euros ($919 million) at a CER price of 9.70 euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|quote=...five high-efficiency coal power plants have been registered under the CDM -- four in India and one in China -- meaning they are all eligible to earn CERs that they can sell. |accessdate=September 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, the Executive Board of the Clean Development Mechanism adopted rules confirming that new coal thermal power generation plants could be registered as CDM projects and could use the simplified rules called 'Programmes of Activities'. The organisation CDM-Watch described the decision as inconsistent with the objective of the CDM as it subsidised the construction of new coal power plants. CDM-Watch described the CERs that would be issued as "non-additional dirty carbon credits".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

|date=13 September 2012
|accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Industrial gas projects====

Some CERs are produced from CDM projects at refrigerant-producing factories in non-Annex I countries that generate the powerful greenhouse gas HFC 23 as a by-product. These projects dominated the CDM's early growth, and are expected to generate 20% of all credited emission reductions by 2012 (Carbon Trust, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;60).&lt;ref name=carbont/&gt; Paying for facilities to destroy HFC-23 can cost only 0.2-0.5&amp;nbsp;€/tCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Industrialized countries were, however, paying around 20 €/tCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for reductions that cost below 1&amp;nbsp;€/tCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This provoked strong criticism.

The scale of profits generated by HFC-23 projects threatened distortions in competitiveness with plants in industrialized countries that had already cleaned up their emissions (p.&amp;nbsp;60). In an attempt to address concerns over HFC-23 projects, the CDM Executive Board made changes in how these projects are credited. According to the Carbon Trust (2009, p.&amp;nbsp;60), these changes effectively ensure that:
*the potential to capture emissions from these plants is exploited;
*distortions are reduced;
*and the risk of perverse incentives is capped.

Carbon Trust (2009, p.&amp;nbsp;60) argued that criticizing the CDM for finding low-cost reductions seemed perverse. They also argued that addressing the problem with targeted funding was easy with hindsight, and that before the CDM, these emission reduction opportunities were not taken.

====Hydropower====

{{refimprove section|date=April 2010}}

NGOs have criticized the inclusion of large [[hydropower]] projects, which they consider unsustainable, as CDM projects.{https://www.internationalrivers.org/km/taxonomy/term/1024} Lately, both the CDM EB and investors have become concerned about such projects for potential lack of additionality. One reason was that many of these projects had started well before applying for CDM status. In June 2008, third party validator TÜV SÜD Group rejected a hydropower project in China because the project proponents could not document that they had seriously considered CDM at the time the project was started. In July 2008, third party validators agreed that projects applying for CDM status more than one year after having taken their investment decision should not qualify for CDM status.  Currently, the largest power plant to receive CDM registration is the [[Jirau Dam|Jirau Hydroelectric Plant]] in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brazil's Jirau hydro project world's largest CDM-registered renewable plant|url=http://www.hydroworld.com/articles/2013/06/brazil-s-jirau-hydro-project-world-s-largest-cdm-registered-rene.html|work=Hydro World|accessdate=30 Dec 2014|date=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydropower projects larger than 20&amp;nbsp;MW must document that they follow [[World Commission on Dams]] guidelines or similar guidelines in order to qualify for the European Union's Emissions Trading Scheme.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010|reason=requires a citation}} As of 21 July 2008, CERs from hydropower projects are not listed on European carbon exchanges, because different member states interpret these limitations differently.

Organisation seeking to measure the degree of compliance of individual projects with WCD principles can use the [[Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol]], recommended as the most practical currently available evaluation tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 17517IIED: Watered Down?

====Other concerns====

'''Renewable energy'''

In the initial phase of the CDM, policy makers and NGOs were concerned about the lack of renewable energy CDM projects. As the new CDM projects are now predominantly renewables and energy efficiency projects, this is now less of an issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/NEWS/Resources/State&amp;Trendsformatted06May10pm.pdf|title=World Bank, State and Trends of the Carbon Market, 2010|author=|date=|website=worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sinks'''

NGOs, as well as several governments, have consistently been sceptical towards the inclusion of [[Carbon dioxide sink|sinks]] as CDM projects.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010|reason=this needs a citation}} The main reasons were fear of oversupply, that such projects cannot guarantee permanent storage of carbon, and that the methods of accounting for carbon storage in biomass are complex and still under development. Consequently, two separate carbon currencies (temporary CERs and long-term CERs) were created for such projects. Such credits cannot be imported to the European Union's Emission Trading Scheme. The lack of demand for such projects have resulted in very limited supply: Currently (21 July 2008), only one sinks project has been registered under CDM.

'''Windfarms in Western Sahara'''

In 2012, it was announced, that a windfarm complex is going to be located near [[Laayoune]], the capital city of the disputed territory of Western Sahara. Since this project is to be established under tight collaboration between the UN (which itself recognizes Western Sahara's status of a non-autonomous country) and the Moroccan government, it has been questioned by many parties supporting Western Sahara independence, including the [[Polisario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsrw.org/a105x2329|title=WSRW requests UN to refrain from paying for Moroccan King in Sahara - wsrw.org|first=Western Sahara Resource|last=Watch|date=|website=www.wsrw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Suggestions====

In response to concerns of unsustainable projects or spurious credits, the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and other NGOs devised a ‘Gold Standard’ methodology to certify projects that uses much stricter criteria than required, such as allowing only renewable energy projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdmgoldstandard.org/|title=The Gold Standard|author=|date=|website=www.cdmgoldstandard.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a [[South Africa]]n brick kiln was faced with a business decision; replace its depleted energy supply with coal from a new [[Coal mine|mine]], or build a difficult but cleaner [[natural gas]] pipeline to another country. They chose to build the pipeline with [[Sasol|SASOL]]. SASOL claimed the difference in GHG emissions as a CDM credit, comparing emissions from the pipeline to the contemplated coal mine.
During its approval process, the validators noted that changing the supply from coal to gas met the CDM's 'additionality' criteria and was the least cost-effective option.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdm.unfccc.int/UserManagement/FileStorage/S790NBBTEMPHOKU95G4UB8J0U5V52O CDM Project 0177 Lawley Fuel Switch Project] UNFCCC&lt;/ref&gt;
However, there were unofficial reports that the fuel change was going to take place anyway, although this was later denied by the company's press office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbontradewatch.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;Itemid=36&amp;id=177&amp;task=view|title=Trading the Absurd - carbon trade watch|first=|last=Administrator|date=|website=www.carbontradewatch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Successes===

Schneider (2007, p.&amp;nbsp;73) commented on the success of the CDM in reducing emissions from industrial plants and landfills.&lt;ref name=schneider/&gt; Schneider (2007) concluded by stating that if concerns over the CDM are properly addressed, it would continue to be an "important instrument in the fight against climate change."

The aim is to rise standard of living with a reduced environmental impact.

Scientists and politicians use this terminology. For example, [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] said : 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Our first goal is to find the way to achieve "clean" growth and I want to defend this idea here today. We haven't got to choose between saving the planet and growth. We need to have growth and save the planet. So we need a growth that consumes less energy and fewer raw materials. A new economy must be invented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambafrance-us.org/news/statmnts/2007/62unga_sarkozy_speech_climate_change092407.asp speech] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120184856/http://www.ambafrance-us.org/news/statmnts/2007/62unga_sarkozy_speech_climate_change092407.asp |date=2008-01-20 }}, UN assembly, sept. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Commodification of the womb''' is the process by which services performed by the female womb are offered for sale and purchased on the market. The market transaction transforms the womb from a human body part, to being a service provided for purchase on the market. The womb in its commodified state has both [[exchange value]] and [[use value]]. Market transactions involving the services of women's wombs became increasingly common in the early twenty-first century. Such transactions are generally relied upon by those unable to conceive and those who are willing to pay someone else to bear the inconvenience of going through a pregnancy. [[Commodification]] of the womb raises several ethical and legal questions, which have expanded from questions regarding the rights of surrogates and biological parents, and the legitimacy of a child resulting from the transaction, to questions regarding transnational surrogacy within a global market.

==History==

===Background===
Through modernization of [[reproductive technology]], the options for having a child has expanded to include [[artificial insemination]], in [[vitro fertilization]], and [[surrogacy]] as possible solutions when faced with infertility. A woman may essentially offer to rent her womb for the gestation of a child who will be given to another person following the birth of the child. Surrogacy has been a practice throughout history yet has become more popular in the modern day. In [[the Bible]], [[Rachel]] who was infertile, gives her handmaid [[Bilhah]] to her husband [[Jacob]] to bear him children. The two children, [[Dan (son of Jacob)|Dan]] and [[Naphtali]] whom Bilhah gave birth to were given names by Rachel who was considered their mother following birth. This was the earliest biblical example of surrogacy.&lt;ref&gt; Twine, France Winddance. "Outsourcing the Womb: Race, Class and Gestational Surrogacy in a Global Market", Routledge, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, 2016, pp. 6–15&lt;/ref&gt; From the Middle Ages to modern times, other reproductive services have also been supplied for a fee. For example, in the [[Middle Ages]] a [[wet nurse]] would feed and care for another woman's child, in exchange for payment. These reproductive services often share a common thread of a woman of lesser economic means supplying either gestation or care of another woman's child for an individual fee or as part of her employment

===New reproductive technologies===
In the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, [[artificial insemination]] made impregnation possible without sexual intercourse. Thus the market for commodifcation of the womb was transformed. Through the advancements of modern technology, potential parent(s) have the ability to enter into a market transaction with a woman, in which the woman agrees to gestate a child, either of her own egg or that of a surrogate, with the contractual obligation of turning this child over upon birth. Having a child born of a commercial surrogate could be considered a [[luxury good]]. Luxury goods are typically only available to those with significant means, beyond that of necessities. It could be considered that, just as in the Biblical cases of handmaids being asked to conceive children, early twenty-first century women offering their womb to the market would also be of lesser economic means.

===Early markets===
Viewing the womb as a commodified good allows for the understanding of the market supply, demand, and transactions that take place with a part of the human body. The market for commercial surrogacy began to take shape in the late 1970s; one of the more prominent figures in this market was attorney Noel Keane of Michigan, United States.&lt;ref name="Spar"&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09692290500105615] Spar, Debora. “For love and money: the political economy of commercial surrogacy,” Review of International Political Economy 12 (2005): 287-309.&lt;/ref&gt; Keane and other entrepreneurs saw a market for the womb, and hence the commodification of the womb began.
 
Keane started brokering deals, for a fee, between potential surrogates and parents until he found out that it was illegal for a genetic parent to sell their child to another person in the state of Michigan. Keane's business model was to have fathers contribute sperm and the surrogate mothers provided eggs. The surrogate mothers were genetically related to the child, while the non-birth mothers were not. Such surrogacy arrangements were illegal in some states on the basis that the non-birth mothers were paying the biological mothers for their genetically related children. The state of Michigan was one such state that enacted laws forbidding these surrogacy arrangements, thereby making Keane's business model illegal.&lt;ref name="Keane"&gt;[http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/siulj5&amp;div=26&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals#160] Keane, Noel P. “Legal Problems of Surrogate Motherhood,” Southern Illinois University of Law Journal 5 (1980): 147-169.&lt;/ref&gt; The main purpose of these laws was to prevent the sale of infants as if they were property. Some states viewed surrogate contracts as void, the payment for a child was illegal, and/or viewed artificial insemination as [[adultery]], if the couple was not married.&lt;ref name="Keane"/&gt;

To avoid the legal issues Keane thought women would volunteer, without pay, to become surrogates out of an altruistic motivation. However, without the promise of financial compensation, Keane found a sharp decline in the number of women who volunteered.&lt;ref name="Spar"/&gt; In the early 1980s Keane moved his commercial surrogacy business to Florida, where laws were more lenient. Florida also had no laws regarding the exchange of money for infants.&lt;ref&gt;Merino, Faith. “Adoption and Surrogate Pregnancy.” June 2010. New York, Facts on File: 36.&lt;/ref&gt; A commercial surrogacy broker could be viewed as a [[capitalist]] organizing production and offering a product to the market. This raised the question of whether women and children are being viewed not as human beings but as [[commodities]] of the market, being bought and sold for the highest prices. At the outset of [[commercial surrogacy]], the laws in place in the [[United States]] were not equipped to handle the resulting legal and ethical questions that would arise. As with many modern markets, womb commodification has moved from local markets to outsourcing in foreign countries.

==Conceptualization==
[[Commodification]] refers to the process by which goods and services are transformed into commodities to be bought and sold in the market. In Capital, from the Fetishism of the Commodity and its Secrets, [[Karl Marx]] describes a commodity as a thing. Marx calls commodities trivial, strange, and [[use value|use values]] to satisfy human needs.&lt;ref name="Marx"&gt;Karl Marx. “The Fetishism of the Commodity and its Secret,” Capital Volume I. (London: Penguin Books, 1990) 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx conceptualizes the commodity as something man transforms from raw materials into a final good. Marx is describing things which are not human, and thus the commodity of the womb cannot be independent of the woman. The womb gains value in the market through [[exchange value]] and [[use value]]. Women's overall market participation is growing both as consumers and as producers. The womb, a product owned only by women, being sold to other women creates a market where women are predominantly the consumer as well as the sole owners of the product. It is difficult, if not impossible, to separate the product of the womb from the human being. Outside of the human, the womb has little value, but once its functions can be traded for profit on the market it is of interest to everyone.

==Ethics==
Womb commodification raises ethical questions, while also balancing it against a woman's right to enter in to a contract and to make decisions regarding her own body.&lt;ref name="Elliot"&gt;[http://www.heinonline.org/HOL/Page?page=611&amp;handle=hein.journals%2Fwmjwl17&amp;collection=journals#637] Neal, M. Elliott. “Protecting Women: Preserving Autonomy in the Commodifcation of Motherhood.” William and Mary Journal of Women and the Law, Volume 17 (2010-2011) p 611-638.&lt;/ref&gt; Womb commodification could be viewed as economic agents engaged in free market trade. The commodification argument asks whether women are being given control over their body, or whether they are being exploited for their individual body parts.&lt;ref name="Amrita"&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/the_pluralist/v005/5.3.banerjee.pdf] Amrita Banerjee. “Reorienting the Ethics of Transnational Surrogacy as a Feminist Pragmatist.” The Pluralist Volume 5, number 3, Fall 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

An ethical argument against womb commodification is that it allows the rich to take advantage of the willingness of poor women to perform any job so long as they are able to earn a wage.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; A woman may choose to commodify her womb for money because she is faced with no other profitable options for employment.

==Legal Issues==
[[Reproductive technology]] is a relatively recent phenomenon with little universal regulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heinonline.org/HOL/Page?page=507&amp;handle=hein.journals%2Fumkc79&amp;collection=journals#512] Patton, Brock A. "Buying a Newborn: Globalization and the Lack of Federal Regulation of Commercial Surrogacy Contracts." UKKC Law Review volume 79: (2010-2011) p 507-534.&lt;/ref&gt;  Surrogates, clinics, and commissioning couples often choose the market that is most favorable, beneficial, or profitable to them. Many individual states in the United States view the gestational mother as the legal mother, which can prove problematic when determining rights of the surrogate versus the rights of the commissioning couple.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jme.bmj.com/content/39/6/397.full.pdf+html] Ramskold, Louise Anna Helena, and Marcus Paul Posner. “Commercial surrogacy: how provisions of monetary remuneration and powers of international law can prevent exploitation of gestational surrogates.” Journal of Medical Ethics (2013): 397-402.&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition and challenges to surrogacy agreements most often relate to the nature of the surrogacy contract.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;[http://www.heinonline.org/HOL/Page?page=615&amp;handle=hein.journals%2Fgeojlege21&amp;collection=journals#627] Anderson, Kelly A. "Certainty in an Uncertain World: The Ethics of Drafting Surrogacy Contracts." Georgetown Journal of Legal Ethics, volume 21 (2008). p 615-630.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the legally debated questions is whether the contract is granting a woman the right to sell the service of her labor through womb rental or whether the surrogate and the commissioning parents are entering into an agreement to sell/purchase a child. One of the most controversial legal issues is determining the rights of surrogate as the birth mother versus contractual obligations of the surrogate as a party to a contract. A mother is commonly defined as a woman who has given birth or legally adopted a child.&lt;ref&gt;Larkey, Amy M. “Redefining Motherhood: Determining Legal Maternity in Gestational Surrogacy Arrangements.” Drake Law Review (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; The law often does not keep pace with technology. With the advancements of surrogacy and the invention of commercial surrogacy, what it means to be a mother will inevitability need to be redefined.

A question at the forefront of legal debates is whether the birth mother may be required to relinquish her rights to the child, or whether the biological parents’ rights supersede the rights of the birth mother.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt; In order to avoid the sale of a human, which is illegal, the focus of a surrogacy contract needs to focus on the legal use of the surrogate's womb to be enforceable. There is little case law on which to rely and this legal battle is made more complex when the element of transnational surrogacy is added. Birth often confers nationally and citizenship. With transnational surrogacy being a common form of [[commercial surrogacy]], there is growing demand for international regulation of this burgeoning market.

===Surrogacy laws by country===
There are two types of surrogacy: commercial surrogacy and altruistic surrogacy. Commercial surrogacy is when the surrogate offers the rental of her womb to the market for financial gain. Conversely, the surrogate generally does not profit from the rental of her womb in altruistic surrogacy. The following countries legally permit both commercial surrogacy and altruistic surrogacy: Russian Federation, Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia, Armenia, Cyprus, India, South Africa, and the United States (in the states of Arkansas, California, Florida, Illinois, Texas, Massachusetts, and Vermont). Other countries permit altruistic surrogacy: Australia, Canada (except Quebec), the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Denmark, Hungary, Israel, and United States (in the states of New York, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nebraska, Virginia, Oregon, and Washington). There are also countries in which any form of surrogacy is illegal, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, Estonia, Moldova, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, China, Japan, and the United States (in the states of Arizona, Michigan, Indiana, North Dakota).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surrogatebaby.com/blog/2012/11/27/surrogacy-laws-by-country/] “Surrogacy laws by country.” Surrogate Baby. Accessed April 25, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to varying options within a home country many people seeking a commercial surrogate choose to seek markets abroad. India legalized commercial surrogacy in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india.embassy.gov.au/ndli/vm_surrogacy.html] “Children born through Surrogacy Arrangements,” Australian High Commission India, accessed April 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Legalization was pushed forward with the hope that [[medical tourism]], and specifically [[reproductive tourism]] in India would increase.

==Economic and social impacts==
With a lack of regulation in the commercial surrogacy market, payments to surrogates can vary depending on the terms of the individual contract.&lt;ref name="Deomampo"&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/frontiers/v034/34.3.deomampo.html] Deomampo, Daisy. “Transnational Surrogacy in India: Interrogating Power and Women's Agency.” Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies, Volume 34, Number 3 (2013): 167-188.&lt;/ref&gt;  India is a favored location for commercial surrogacy due to the lower costs. By some estimates, those wishing to enter in to a commercial surrogacy contract could save as much as $70,000 in India versus the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Jaishankar, K., and Natti Ronel, editors. “Second International Conference of the South Asian Society of Criminology and Victimology.” (2013): 167-169.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social benefits===
By becoming commercial surrogates women in India are enabling themselves to improve not only their lives but also the lives of their families. It is common for surrogates to have had limited access to education, which could limit the opportunities for employment in the market.&lt;ref name="Deomampo"/&gt; Payment for surrogacy varies by contract, estimates range from the equivalent of three times what the head of household could make in a month,&lt;ref name="Deomampo"/&gt; to earning in nine months an amount that would take fifteen years worth of work.&lt;ref name="Parks"/&gt; This amount of money can provide access to better housing, food, education, and sanitation, that would otherwise not be probable.

Former surrogates also have the ability to become agents for surrogacy clinics. Agents, for a fee, facilitate a surrogate's doctor's visits and look out for the care and wellbeing of the surrogate throughout the course of her pregnancy. Becoming an agent allows the woman to have several patients and she is able to collect fees from each of them, which may further improve her financial situation.&lt;ref name="Deomampo"/&gt; It was expected that profits for commercial surrogacy would reach as high as six billion dollars by 2012.&lt;ref name="Parks"/&gt;

6 September 2018, [[Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code]] is declared unconstitutional in India. After this path breaking decision, surrogacy, especially single father surrogacy will see a boost among LGBT community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.blognox.com/single-father-surrogacy-unnatural-responsibility-unblended-love/|title=Single Father Surrogacy {{!}} Unnatural responsibility or Unblended Love?|date=2017-08-22|work=BlogNox|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Clinics===
When a woman signs a contract to become a gestational carrier she is subject to hormone administration and embryo transplantation to become impregnated. Many, but not all surrogates move to gestational hostels and receive better medical treatment and care than they would receive were they giving birth to their own child free of the obligation of a contract.&lt;ref name="Vora"&gt;[http://saq.dukejournals.org/content/111/4/681.full.pdf+html] Vora, Kalindi. “Limits of “Labor”: Accounting for Affect and the Biological in Transnational Surrogacy and Service Work.” South Atlantic Quarterly, Winter 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Nutrition, health, and rest are all monitored as part of the contract, with the wellbeing of the fetus often paramount to that of the surrogate.

Many clinics that broker transnational surrogacy prefer women who have already given birth, as the clinics have evidence of a viable uterus. The clinics may also prefer women who have their own children, with the hope that the surrogate will not bond with the fetus. Surrogacy contracts focus on the rental of an unused womb, with the belief that the fetus is the property of another. Many surrogates only receive full payment for their service if the full duration of the pregnancy is met. The appeal for foreign parents of transnational surrogacy is due to the lower costs and wage demands than they would find in their home country.

Dr. Nayna Patel runs the Akanksha clinic, in Anand, India. At first most of the clients seeking fertility services from the Akanksha clinic were Indian, but their clientele has expanded to Westerners also seeking a child. Many come to this distant clinic as the fees are too high in their own country.&lt;ref name="Dunbar"&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-500601/Wombs-rent-Childless-British-couples-pay-Indian-women-carry-babies.html] Dunbar, Polly. “Wombs to rent: Childless British couples pay Indian women to carry their babies.” Mail Online December 8, 2007, web. Accessed April 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign couples are seeking lower priced alternatives to local surrogacy, and foreign surrogates may be willing to accept a lower fee. Surrogates at the Akanksha clinic have the possibility of making $5500 for this transaction, a sum of money that is significant in providing for a family, education, housing, and wellbeing when compared to other alternatives.&lt;ref name="Amrita"/&gt;

==Citizenship and transnational surrogacy==

===Citizenship===
Citizenship of a child has traditionally been established through [[jus soli]], right of the soil, and/or [[jus sanguinis]], right of blood.&lt;ref name="Daisy"&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/01459740.2014.890195] Deomampo, Daisy. “Defining Parents, Making Citizens: Nationality and Citizenship in Transnational Surrogacy.” Medical Anthropology: Cross-Cultural Studies in Health and Illness, posted online March 10, 2014, accessed April 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Surrogacy challenges the traditional view of citizenship, by redefining what it means to be a mother. Nations must now consider if a mother is the person who physically gave birth to the child, the one who provided her ovum, or the one who will care for the child.

In July 2010, consuls general from Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, and the Czech Republic sent letters to surrogacy clinics in Mumbai, India, to direct potential clients from these countries to seek guidance from their consulates before entering into surrogacy contracts. These countries have varying surrogacy laws, and many of their citizens have faced difficulties upon trying to gain citizenship rights for children born in India.&lt;ref name="Daisy"/&gt;

===Manji===
One of the most well known cases of problematic transnational surrogacy and lineage is that of the baby girl known as Manji, born in 2008, in India. Manji's birth was the result of a commercial surrogacy contract between her Japanese parents and her Indian surrogate. Before Manji's birth, her parents divorced, and her commissioning mother refused to claim her. Under Indian law, an infant's passport may only be issued in conjunction with the mother's. Since neither her Japanese or Indian mother would claim Manji, for a brief time she was not considered a citizen of Japan, India, or any other country.&lt;ref name="Parks"&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8519.2010.01831.x/full] Parks, Jennifer A. “Care ethics and the global practice of commercial surrogacy.” Bioethics, Volume 24, Issue 7 (September 2010): 333-340.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until her paternal grandmother claimed her, accompanied by a lengthy legal battle, that Manji was able to apply for a passport and citizenship.

A '''dilemma''' ({{lang-grc-gre|δίλημμα}} "double [[lemma (logic)|proposition]]") is a [[problem]] offering two possibilities, neither of which is unambiguously acceptable or preferable. The possibilities are termed the ''horns'' of the dilemma, a [[cliché]]d usage, but distinguishing the dilemma from other kinds of predicament as a matter of usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Garner |first1=Bryan |title=Garner's Modern American Usage |date=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199888771 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FwmQpyibKkAC&amp;pg=PA257 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dilemmatic arguments==
The dilemma is sometimes used as a [[rhetorical device]]. Its isolation as textbook material has been attributed to [[Hermogenes of Tarsus]] in his work ''On Invention''.&lt;ref&gt;Lucia Calboli Montefusco, ''Rhetorical use of dilemmatic arguments'', Rhetorica: A Journal of the History of Rhetoric Vol. 28, No. 4 (Autumn 2010), pp. 363–383, at p. 364. Published by: University of California Press on behalf of the International Society for the History of Rhetoric. DOI: 10.1525/rh.2010.28.4.363 {{jstor|10.1525/rh.2010.28.4.363}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[C. S. Peirce]] gave a definition of ''dilemmatic argument'' as any argument relying on [[excluded middle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ghosh |first1=Sujata |last2=Prasad |first2=Sanjiva |title=Logic and Its Applications: 7th Indian Conference, ICLA 2017, Kanpur, India, January 5-7, 2017, Proceedings |date=2016 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783662540695 |page=177 note 5|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=etrJDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA177 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the form "you must accept either A, or B"; here A and B would be propositions each leading to some further conclusion, and applied incorrectly, it constitutes a [[false dichotomy]], that is, a [[fallacy]]. Traditional usage distinguished the dilemma as a "horned syllogism" from the [[sophism]] that attracted the Latin name ''cornutus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hamilton |first1=Sir William |title=The Logic of Sir William Hamilton, Bart |date=1863 |publisher=Moore, Wilstach &amp; Baldwin |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rUEdAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA185 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original use of the word ''horns'' in English has been attributed to [[Nicholas Udall]] in his 1548 book ''Paraphrases'', translating from the Latin term ''cornuta interrogatio''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Erasmus |first1=Desiderius |title=Paraphrase on Luke 11-24 |date=2003 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=9780802036537 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=q9ZLk_Qw0ZQC&amp;pg=PA158 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In logic==
In [[propositional logic]], ''dilemma'' is applied to a group of [[rules of inference]], which are in themselves valid rather than fallacious. They each have three premises, and include the [[constructive dilemma]] and [[destructive dilemma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Church |first1=Alonzo |title=Introduction to Mathematical Logic |date=1996 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0691029067 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JDLQOMKbdScC&amp;pg=PA105 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such arguments can be refuted by showing that the disjunctive premise — the "horns of the dilemma" — does not in fact hold, because it presents a false dichotomy. You are asked to accept "A or B", but counter by showing that is not all. Successfully undermining that premise is called "escaping through the horns of the dilemma".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Govier |first1=Trudy |title=A Practical Study of Argument |date=2009 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=0495603406 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IUxXbUvDiswC&amp;pg=PA254 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In philosophy==
Dilemmatic reasoning has been attributed to [[Melissus of Samos]], a [[Presocratic]] philosopher whose works survive in fragmentary form, making the origins of the technique in philosophy imponderable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harriman |first1=Benjamin |title=Melissus and Eleatic Monism |date=2018 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781108416337 |page=44 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=e091DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established with [[Diodorus Cronus]] (died c. 284 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sedley |first1=David |title=Diodorus Cronus |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/diodorus-cronus |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paradoxes of [[Zeno of Elea]] were reported by [[Aristotle]] in dilemma form, but that may have been to conform with what [[Plato]] said about Zeno's style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Palmer |first1=John |title=Zeno of Elea |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zeno-elea/ |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moral and ethical dilemmas==
{{main|ethical dilemma}}
In cases where two [[moral principle]]s appear to be inconsistent, an actor has a dilemma in terms of which principle to follow. This kind of moral case study is attributed to [[Cicero]], in book III of his ''[[De Officiis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jonsen |first1=Albert R. |last2=Toulmin |first2=Stephen Edelston |title=The Abuse of Casuistry: A History of Moral Reasoning |date=1988 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520060630 |page=75 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RNipCKHdnlsC&amp;pg=PA75 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Christian tradition of [[casuistry]], an approach to abstract ranking of principles introduced by [[Bartolomé de Medina (theologian)|Bartolomé de Medina]] in the 16th century became tainted with the accusation of [[laxism]], as did casuistry itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Peters |first1=Francis E. |title=The words and will of God |date=2003 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0691114617 |page=154 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=26aSVSICGIEC&amp;pg=PA154 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach, with legal roots, is to lay emphasis on particular features present in a given case: in other words, the exact framing of the dilemma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jonsen |first1=Albert R. |last2=Toulmin |first2=Stephen Edelston |title=The Abuse of Casuistry: A History of Moral Reasoning |date=1988 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520060630 |page=54 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RNipCKHdnlsC&amp;pg=PA54 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient Greek literature, an '''eidolon''' (plural: '''eidola''' or  '''eidolons''') ([[Greek language|Greek]] εἴδωλον: "image, idol, double, apparition, phantom, [[ghost]]") is a spirit-image of a living or dead person; a shade or phantom look-alike of the human form. The concept of [[Helen of Troy]]'s eidolon was explored both by [[Homer]] and [[Euripides]]. However, where Homer uses the concept as a free-standing idea that gives Helen life after death, Euripides entangles it with the idea of [[kleos]], one being the product of the other.&lt;ref name="Philology"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Meltzer | first = Gary S. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = "Where Is the Glory of Troy?" "Kleos" in Euripides' "Helen" | journal = | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 234–255 | publisher = University of California Press | location = | date = Oct 1994 | url = | jstor = 25011015 | issn = | doi = | id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Euripides and [[Stesichorus]], in their respective works concerning the [[Trojan Horse]], claim that Helen was never physically present in the city at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Papi | first = Donatella Galeotti | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Victors and Sufferers in Euripides' Helen | journal = The American Journal of Philology | volume = 108 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–40  | publisher = The Johns Hopkins University Press | location = | year = 1987  | url = | jstor = 294912 | issn = | doi = | id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the eidola of the dead was explored in various literature regarding [[Penelope]], who in later works was constantly laboring against the eidola of [[Clytamnestra]] and later Helen herself.&lt;ref name="Philology"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Holmberg | first = Ingrid E. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Euripides' Helen: Most Noble and Most Chaste | journal = The American Journal of Philology | volume = 116 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–42  | publisher = The Johns Hopkins University Press | location = | date = Spring 1995  | url = &lt;!--http://www.academicroom.com/article/euripides-helen-most-noble-and-most-chaste | accessdate = March 3, 2015--&gt; | jstor = 295501 | issn = | doi = | id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homer's use of eidola also extends to the [[Odyssey]] where, after the death of the suitors, Theoclymenos notes that he sees the doorway of the court filled with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Barasch | first = Moshe | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Departing Soul. The Long Life of a Medieval Creation | journal = Artibus et Historiae | volume = 26 | issue = 52 | pages = 13–28  | publisher = IRSA s.c. | location = | year = 2005 | url = | jstor = 20067095 | issn = | doi = | id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walt Whitman]]'s poem by the same name in 1876 used a much broader understanding of the term, expanded and detailed in the poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Carpenter | first = Frederic I. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Walt Whitman's "Eidolon" | journal = College English | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | pages = 534–545 | publisher = National Council of Teachers of English | location = | date = Mar 1942 | url = | jstor = 370944 | issn = | doi = | id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Whitman's use of the term we can see the use broaden to include the concept of an oversoul composed of the individual souls of all life and expanding to include the Earth itself and the hierarchy of the planets, Sun, stars and galaxy.

In [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], the astral double or [[perispirit]] or [[Kamarupa (Theosophy)|kamarupa]] after death, before its disintegration is identified with the ''eidolon''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/etgloss/etg-hp.htm Encyclopedic Theosophical Glossary: A Resource on Theosophy, G. de Purucker&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Equiveillance''' is a state of equilibrium, or a desire to attain a state of equilibrium, between [[surveillance]] and [[sousveillance]].&lt;ref&gt;Manders, C. (2013, June). Moving surveillance techniques to sousveillance: Towards equiveillance using wearable computing. In Technology and Society (ISTAS), 2013 IEEE International Symposium on (pp. 19-19). IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Karsten, Surveillance, Sousveillance, Equiveillance: Google Glasses (June 30, 2012).

(2010, June). Socializing Surveillance: An interdisciplinary educational model. In Control &amp; Automation (MED), 2010 18th Mediterranean Conference on (pp. 179-184). IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes confused with [[The Transparent Society|transparency]].  This balance (equilibrium) allows the individual to construct their own case from evidence they gather themselves,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wearcam.org/anonequiveillance.htm |title=Exporing Equiveillance |publisher=Wearcam.org |date=2003-07-17 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than merely having access to surveillance data that could possibly incriminate them.

Sousveillance, in addition to transparency, can be used to preserve the contextual integrity of surveillance data. For example, a lifelong capture of personal experience could provide "best evidence" over external surveillance data, to prevent the surveillance-only data from being taken out of context.

==Ubiquitous computing==
Equiveillance represents a situation where all parties of a society or economy are empowered to be able to use the tools of accountability to make beneficial decisions.  Humanity has always sought to establish authority relationships: the increasing trend to record information from our environment, and of ourselves creates the need to delineate the relationships between privacy, surveillance, and sousveillance.

The emphasis on [[ubiquitous computing]] is to be contrasted with [[wearable computing]]. As personal cell phones store more information and have the capacity to share it, wearable and mobile computing will make manifest the ability for an individual, or small group of individuals, to monitor larger institutional systems with the goal of developing systems of transparency and accountability. For just as large institutions, such as governments or corporations, store information about the buying habits of the public through an integrated surveillance highway that has a ubiquitous computing infrastructure, individuals can act as consumer activists though a system of inverse surveillance that is based upon a wearable computing infrastructure that assists in maximizing personal privacy and alerting one of information being recorded about the self. Such actions could lead to an equiveillant state, as power and respect are shared.

Panoptic surveillance was described by [[Michel Foucault]] in the context of a prison in which prisoners were isolated from each other but visible at all times by guards. Surveillance tends to isolate individuals from one another while setting forth a one-way visibility to authority figures. This isolation leads to social fragmentation.

Sousveillance has a community-based origin, such as a personal electronic diary (or we[[blog]]), made public on the World Wide Web. Sousveillance tends to bring together individuals, by influencing a large city to function more like a small town: with the pitfalls of gossip, but also the benefits of a sense of community participation. There is a greater degree of responsibility in a sousveillance environment.

Ubiquitous computing ("ubicomp"), also known as pervasive computing ("pervcomp"), is the integration of computers with the environment. Ubiquitous computing tends to rely on cooperation of the immediate infrastructure in the environment, but also has a tendency to centralize information, and hence, centralize authority structures. It also creates segregation, and has implications for social rights such as education and healthcare. Individuals are sorted and classified within a ubiquitous computing environment, leading to a new form of segregation. Ubiquitous computing also places emphasis on [[copyright law]] and undermines creative environments due to the controlling tendencies of authority.

Wearable computing ("wearcomp") refers to portable, wearable computing technologies. Wearcomp doesn't require any special infrastructure in the environment, as the computer is self-contained and self-reliant. With sousveillant computing, it is possible for the focus of control to be more distributed rather than centralized.

A free society is one which places emphasis on respect and the balance of power: in a democratic society, respect and power are shared and well distributed, whereas in a despotic community, respect and power are not shared and are restricted to the few. Increasingly, our society is confronted with the realization of a [[ubiquitous computing]] environment, with the infrastructure predicated upon sensor and surveillance systems to function despite efforts to stop such expansions. How we participate in sharing respect and power will converge with how our society conducts surveillance of its citizens, and how citizens conduct sousveillance. Equiveillance represents a harmonious balance that maximizes human freedom, individual rights as well as communal democracy. The field of personal [[cybernetics]] will converge with the fields of personal imaging and glogging ([[CyborgLog]]ging), as individuals store and archive information for personal use and as a form of self-defense.

To have a society within which personal freedoms and justice are equally distributed, transparency is needed. Transparency increasingly will require dealing with the issues of ubiquitous computing and wearable computing, and maintaining a balance between surveillance and inverse surveillance while maximizing personal privacy.

==Equiveillance table==
Equiveillance establishes a social balance between surveillance and sousveillance, as outlined in a general series of comparisons that is known in the published literature as the "equiveillance table".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eyetap.org/papers/docs/acmmm2004sousveillance_p620-mann |title=Proceedings of the Association of Computing Machinery Multimedia (MM) 2004, page 620-627 |publisher=Eyetap.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are two kinds of situations that occur when this social balance does not exist: inequiveillance, in which there is a one-sided nature to surveillance (this is the most common situation), and disequiveillance, which is when the balance is not provably one-sided, but, rather, is unequal but not clearly in one or the other direction.

==Inequiveillance (disequiveillance)==
Equiveillance represents a balance of the power relationships that surveillance and sousveillance touch upon. When there is an imbalance, social consequences can range from loss of privacy, to social reactions that in the aggregate lead to unrest and political instability. The idea of disequiveillance is described by [[Paul Virilio]] in his treatise on Dromology and the possibility of freedom loss as an accident of our modern world and how it relates to terrorism and war. In this context, the lack of equiveillance (disequiveillance) refers to the anthropological consequences of a world filled with continuous recording devices that encourage a despotic form of government with a tendency to intrude upon the lives of its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bronitt | first1 = Simon | last2 = Michael | first2 = Katina | year = 2012 | title = Human rights, regulation, and national security | url = http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=9875&amp;context=infopapers | journal = IEEE Technol.

The evolving field of sousveillance, stems in part from recent research on the topic of surveillance and inverse-surveillance, shedding light on how media technology is changing our sense of privacy and human freedom. Privacy becomes increasingly a measure of freedom and its control central to personal autonomy.

Increasingly, remembering is influenced by both personal and public search engines, as computing is becoming increasingly dependent upon the [[human–computer interaction]]. The issue of being able to control the amount of personal information that escapes and is recorded in the many machines that make up evolving ubiquitous computing world stresses the importance of equiveillance. The impact of surveillance will be increasingly related to the impact of increasing [[computer storage]] space and data mining processing speed.

A 2005 article by Margaret Papandreou entitled "Is nothing Sacred" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stefanospantagis.net/journal/archives/2005/12/is_nothing_sacr.html |accessdate=December 26, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060317173758/http://stefanospantagis.net/journal/archives/2005/12/is_nothing_sacr.html |archivedate=March 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also highlights the issue of disequiveillance and how the theft of personal communications with her son undermined her [[freedom of thought]]. Mrs Papandreou's [[personal computer]] was entered by [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] with malicious intent, with multiple [[emails]], and personal information downloaded and eventually published in book form. The issue of [[freedom of the press]], vs [[theft]] of personal property and [[electronic trespassing]], developed into a subsequent legal action against the journalist and member of the Greek Parliament, [[Liana Kanelli]]. The issue of public vs. private space comes into the debate. The practice of spying as a [[political]] technique creates a flashback to how previous Greek politicians where undermined via covert [[eavesdropping]] and a subsequent outcome from the previous decades of the [[Greek Civil War]]. The complexity of this case becomes twofold when the person surveillanced is a concerned citizen, and not a politician. Furthermore, the issue of taking personal electronic communication out of context for political and financial gain creates the issue of disequiveillance. This can happen on a personal level, or on a larger social, or institutional level.

"The correspondence, which included e-mails, was published in late 2000 and early 2001, in the [[Nemesis magazine]], which was run by journalist and MP Liana Kanelli. It was unclear how Kanelli laid hands on the letters, in which the US-born Papandreou advised the FM on his political career, urging him to make use of non-governmental organizations such as the Andreas Papandreou Foundation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agp.gr/agp/content/Document.aspx?d=7&amp;rd=5499005&amp;f=1427&amp;rf=-2011937565&amp;m=4816&amp;rm=6427264&amp;l=1 |title=/ Andreas G.

The foundations of human [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] also are rooted in the idea of [[social contract]]. Biased comments from the conclusion of documents obtained without a [[search warrant]], and against the principles of legal procedure create an unfair forum for judging and condemnation and expose some of the problems of how electronic freedom can be misused towards a systemic persecution and misrepresentation. It also exposes how social instability can rapidly cause a society to evolve into a prison state. Order is maintained in systematic dissolvement of freedom towards a government that operates more like a prison rather than a body of persons made up of "free individuals" with an overemphasis of everyone watching everyone, with anyone becoming an informant for whatever side that may be competing for power.

Unbalanced surveillance, and disequiveillance can rapidly deevolve society towards the en-masse phenomena such as [[racism]], [[scapegoating]] and even mob reactions towards an individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leymann.se/English/frame.html |title=The Mobbing Encyclopaedia |publisher=Leymann.se |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927110132/http://leymann.se/English/frame.html |archivedate=2013-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also of importance to realize that [[justice]] is not rooted in [[Revenge|vengeance]], but rather, the [[law]].

The Margaret Papandreou case highlights the issue of victimization through use of the media as a form of [[propaganda]]. The social emphasis of a big brother society is rapidly transitioning [[Balkan]] nations via the prevalence of &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/1886998.stm |title=TV AND RADIO &amp;#124; Ban on Greek Big Brother overturned |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-03-22 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/news/greek/ana/2001/01-03-03.ana.html#16 |title=Athens News Agency: Daily News Bulletin in English, 01-03-03 |publisher=Hri.org |date=2001-03-05 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; media support of such systems with an increasingly legal disregard for individual privacy.

The issue of privacy as part of freedom is in conflict with an absolutely [[The Transparent Society|transparent society]] where all things become recorded and available. The ability to mediate ones visibility increasingly intersects with the concept of [[wearable computing]], as a form of sheltering the individual from a world filled with recorders and sensors. The ability of controlling ones personal information is increasingly part of how one is to maintain ones personal and free space. Hence protecting ones privacy also intersects with the concept of [[sousveillance]].

'''Erica Chenoweth''' (born April 22, 1980) is an American [[political scientist]] as well as a faculty member and [[Ph.D.]] program co-director at the [[University of Denver|University of Denver's]] [[Josef Korbel School of International Studies]].&lt;ref name=DUFaculty&gt;{{cite web|title=Erica Chenoweth Faculty Page|url=http://www.du.edu/korbel/faculty/chenoweth.html|work=du.edu/korbel|publisher=University of Denver|accessdate=1 Nov 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chenoweth is also the Director of the university's Program on Terrorism and Insurgency Research and a researcher at the [[Peace Research Institute Oslo|Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO)]]. Within the [[international relations]] community, she is known for her work on [[civil resistance]] movements and political violence.

==Education==
Chenoweth received her [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] at the [[University of Dayton]], followed by an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] and a [[Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]]. She previously taught at [[Wesleyan University]] until 2012 and completed postdoctoral fellowships at [[Harvard University]] and the [[University of Maryland]].&lt;ref name=DUFaculty/&gt; Chenoweth joined the University of Denver faculty in 2012.&lt;ref name=WIAR&gt;{{cite web|title=Another Honor for the University of Denver’s Erica Chenoweth|url=http://www.wiareport.com/2012/12/another-honor-for-the-university-of-denvers-erica-chenoweth/|work=WIAReport|publisher=Women in Academia Report|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with Maria J. Stephan of the [[Department of State|U.S. Department of State]], Chenoweth co-wrote the book, ''Why Civil Resistance Works''.  Chenoweth and Stephan organized an international team of scholars in identifying all the major violent and nonviolent governmental change efforts of the twentieth century.  They translated the results into a theory of civil resistance and its success rate for political change compared to violent resistance.&lt;ref name=InsideHigerEd&gt;{{cite web|title=Success of Nonviolent Revolution|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/audio/2012/11/06/success-nonviolent-revolution|work=Academic Minute|publisher=Inside Higher Ed|accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their team identified over 200 violent revolutions and over 100 nonviolent campaigns.  Twenty-six percent of the violent revolutions were successful, while 53 percent of the nonviolent campaigns succeeded.  Moreover, [[v:Effective defense#Nonviolence builds democracy; violence doesn't|looking at change in democracy]] ([[Polity data series|Polity IV scores]]) indicates that nonviolence promotes democracy while violence promotes tyranny.

In addition every campaign that got active participation from at least 3.5 percent of the population succeeded, and many succeeded with less.  All the campaigns that achieved that threshold were nonviolent;  no violent campaign achieved that threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chenoweth|first1=Erica|title=My Talk at TEDxBoulder: Civil Resistance and the “3.5% Rule”|url=https://rationalinsurgent.com/2013/11/04/my-talk-at-tedxboulder-civil-resistance-and-the-3-5-rule/|website=RationalInsurgent.org|publisher=Rational Insurgent|accessdate=2016-10-10|date=2013-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 ''Why Civil Resistance Works'' won the [[American Political Science Association|American Political Science Association's]] [[Woodrow Wilson Foundation|Woodrow Wilson Foundation Award]] for "the best book published in the U.S. during the previous calendar year on government, politics, or international affairs."&lt;ref name=APSA&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Woodrow Wilson Foundation Award Recipient|url=http://www.apsanet.org/content_58660.cfm|work=Woodrow Wilson Foundation Award|publisher=American Political Science Association|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chenoweth, along with Stephan, also won the 2013 [[University of Louisville]] [[Grawemeyer Award]] for Ideas for Improving the World Order.&lt;ref name=Grawemeyer&gt;{{cite web|title=Pair win world order prize for civil resistance study|url=http://grawemeyer.org/news-updates/pair-win-world-order-prize-for-civil-resistance-study|work=The Grawemeyer Awards|publisher=University of Louisville|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Past winners of this award include [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and [[Robert Keohane]].&lt;ref name=GrawePrevious&gt;{{cite web|title=Previous Winners - University Of Louisville Grawemeyer Award For Ideas Improving World Order |url=http://grawemeyer.org/worldorder/previous-winners/ |work=The Grawemeyer Awards |publisher=University of Louisville |accessdate=28 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528135353/http://grawemeyer.org/worldorder/previous-winners |archivedate=28 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, ''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'' named Chenoweth one of the [[FP Top 100 Global Thinkers|Top 100 Global Thinkers]] of the year "for proving [[Gandhi]] right," noting her work on providing evidence for the efficacy of nonviolent political movements.&lt;ref name=FP100&gt;{{cite news|title=Erica Chenoweth: For proving Gandhi right|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013_global_thinkers/public/chenoweth|accessdate=12 December 2013|newspaper=Foreign Policy|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013, Erica also won the [[Karl Deutsch Award (International Relations)]] for being "judged to have made the most significant contribution to the study of International Relations and Peace Research by the means of publication."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prio.no/News/Item/?x=1835&lt;/ref&gt;

Chenoweth was also awarded the [[International Studies Association]] award for "Best Group Blog of the Year". It was awarded the blog "Violence @ a Glance", which she founded with [[Barbara F. Walter]].

The '''Ersu Shaba script''', also called ''Ersu Shaba Picture Writing'' and known in Ersu as {{IPA|[ndzārāmá]}}, is the writing system used in texts of the indigenous religion of the [[Ersu people]], which is rendered in Chinese as ''Shābā'' (沙巴). These scriptures are recited in divination and when treating the sick. The script is used for non-scriptural texts as well, such as astrological almanacs, but predominantly ones which concern religion. Only Shaba priests are literate in the script.

The script is predominantly [[pictograph]]ic. It is limited in scope and is not sufficient to write the [[Ersu language]] fully. Some 200 glyphs have been identified, most of them depicting (and resembling) concrete objects. These are combined into composite diagrams. The system is [[proto-writing|(proto-)writing]], as the relationship between form and meaning is fixed: Although glyphs may be written simply or elaborately, they may not be chosen at the author's whim, and pronunciation and interpretation is consistent across the several counties of the Ersu-speaking area. However, it typically takes many words to explain a few glyphs; the connection to language is definite in the object depicted, but the position and context of the glyphs does not have a fixed linguistic correlation.

Writing is done with a bamboo brush or animal hair dipped in white, black, red, blue, green, and yellow-colored ink. The color chosen may affect the meaning. For example, the glyph 'stars and moon' written in black means 'dim', but written in white it means 'shining' (Sun 2009:165).

Following is a reading and explanation of the frame from a Shaba book illustrated at the top of the page. 
[[File:Ersu Shaba diagram.png|left|250px]]
Reading:
:{{quote|''The ninth day of the first lunar month, a dog day, will be a fire day. In the morning there will be fog under the earth. Before sunrise, clouds will appear in the sky. A {{IPA|tsʰintʃʰá}} sword and a {{IPA|npʰópá}} will appear afterwards. This means that the morning will be a good morning. After midday, two stars will die, only one of the three will still be shining and the sun will be in an abnormal condition. One can surmise that there is a deity under the earth; it is better not to move earth that day.'' (Sun 2009:173)}}
Explanation. (The reading is not in any particular order; the explanation will start with the glyph in the center and then go clockwise.)

In the center of the diagram is a dog's head, meaning it is a 'dog day'. The dog's body is red, meaning it's also a [[Wu Xing|fire day]]. The combination means the ninth day of the first lunar month. At the bottom left is fog, meaning the morning will be foggy; if the fog were on the right, it would be in the evening. Above that is a red ''tsá'' jug with a handle (#27 in the table above); ''tsá'' jugs are used for alcohol, and the auspicious red color means that the drinking will be good on that day, meaning the day itself will be comparatively good. At the top left are three stars (22 above), two black and one white; a black star is dim, a white star shining. [Meaning unclear.] At top right is the Sun (18 above) crossed out in chains, meaning it will be hindered and the weather will not be good. The ''npʰópá'' (a religious implement) and the ritual ''tsʰintʃʰá'' knife, which can overcome negative forces, indicate that positive and negative forces will balance.

The Ersu text speaks of a 'white moon', meaning the first half of the month (a black moon is the second half of the month), but it is not clear how this is indicated. The earth deity is not directly mentioned, and must be inferred (Sun p 178).

'''Ideal ring bundle''' or '''gold ring bundle''' is a mathematical term which means an ''n''-stage [[Cyclic order|cyclic sequence]] of semi-measured terms, e.g. [[integer]]s for which the set of all circular sums enumerates row of [[natural number]]s by fixed times. The circular sum is called a sum of consecutive terms in the ''n''-sequence of any number of terms (from 1 to ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1).

==Examples==
For example, the cyclic sequence (1,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;7) is an Ideal Ring Bundle because four (''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4) its terms enumerate of all natural numbers from 1 to ''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;12 as its starting term, and can be of any number of summing terms by exactly one (''R''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1) way:

: 1,
: 2,
: 3,
: 4 = 1 + 3,
: 5 = 3 + 2,
: 6 = 1 + 3 + 2,
: 7,
: 8 = 7 + 1,
: 9 = 2 + 7,
: 10 = 2 + 7 + 1,
: 11 = 7 + 1 + 3,
: 12 = 3 + 2 + 7,
: 13 = 1 + 3 + 2 + 7.

The cyclic sequence (1,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3) is an ideal ring bundle also, because four (''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4) its terms enumerate all numbers of the natural row from 1 to ''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)/''R''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6 as its starting term, and can be of any number of summing terms by exactly two (''R''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2) ways:

: 1, 1
: 2, 2 = 1 + 1
: 3, 3 = 2 + 1
: 4 = 3 + 1, 4 = 1 + 1 + 2
: 5 = 2 + 3, 5 = 3 + 1 + 1
: 6 = 1 + 2 + 3, 6 = 2 + 3 + 1

In [[scientific visualization]], '''image-based flow visualization''' (or '''visualisation''') is a computer modelling technique developed by [[Jarke van Wijk]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Wijk|first=Jack|authorlink=Jack van Wijk|title=Image Based Flow Visualization|journal=Proceedings ACM SIGGRAPH 2002, San Antonio, Texas|year=2002|url=http://www.win.tue.nl/~vanwijk/ibfv/ibfv.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to visualize two dimensional flows of liquids such as water and air, like the wind movement of a [[tornado]]. Compared with integration techniques it has the advantage of producing a whole image at every step, as the technique relies upon graphical computing methods for frame-by-frame capture of the model of advective transport of  a decaying dye. It is a method from the [[texture advection]] family.

==Principle==
The core idea is to create a noise texture on a regular grid and then bend this grid according to the flow (the vector field). The bent grid is then sampled at the original grid locations. Thus, the output is a version of the noise, that is displaced according to the flow.

[[File:Image-Based Flow Visualization.svg|Warping of the grid and resampling at original locations]]

The advantage of this approach is that it can be accelerated on modern graphics hardware, thus allowing for real-time or almost real-time simulation of 2D flow data. This is particularly handy if one wants to visualise multiple scaled versions of the vector field to first gain an overview and then concentrate on the details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Multiscale Image Based Flow Visualization|journal=Proceedings of SPIE's Conference on Visualization and Data Analysis (VDA) 2006|volume=6060|pages=606001|year=2006|url=http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~strzodka/papers/public/TeSt06MIBFV.pdf |bibcode=2006SPIE.6060E..01T|last1=Telea|first1=Alexandru|last2=Strzodka|first2=Robert|doi=10.1117/12.640425|series=Visualization and Data Analysis 2006|citeseerx=10.1.1.72.3457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4351">In [[finance]], '''indifference pricing''' is a method of pricing [[financial securities]] with regard to a [[utility function]].  The ''' indifference price''' is also known as the '''[[reservation price]]''' or '''private valuation'''.  In particular, the indifference price is the price at which an agent would have the same [[expected utility]] level by exercising a [[financial transaction]] as by not doing so (with optimal trading otherwise).  Typically the indifference price is a pricing range (a [[bid-ask spread]]) for a specific agent; this price range is an example of [[good-deal bounds]].&lt;ref name="FE"&gt;{{cite book|title=Financial Engineering|author=John R. Birge|year=2008|publisher=Elsevier|pages=521–524|isbn=978-0-444-51781-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematics==
Given a utility function &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and a claim &lt;math&gt;C_T&lt;/math&gt; with known payoffs at some terminal time &lt;math&gt;T,&lt;/math&gt; let the function &lt;math&gt;V: \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be defined by
: &lt;math&gt;V(x,k) = \sup_{X_T \in \mathcal{A}(x)} \mathbb{E}\left[u\left(X_T + k C_T\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the initial endowment, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all [[self-financing portfolio]]s at time &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; starting with endowment &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the number of the claim to be purchased (or sold).  Then the indifference bid price &lt;math&gt;v^b(k)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; units of &lt;math&gt;C_T&lt;/math&gt; is the solution of &lt;math&gt;V(x - v^b(k),k) = V(x,0)&lt;/math&gt; and the indifference ask price &lt;math&gt;v^a(k)&lt;/math&gt; is the solution of &lt;math&gt;V(x + v^a(k),-k) = V(x,0)&lt;/math&gt;.  The indifference price bound is the range &lt;math&gt;\left[v^b(k),v^a(k)\right]&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=C09&gt;{{cite book|first=Rene|last=Carmona|title=Indifference Pricing: Theory and Applications|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-691-13883-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
Consider a market with a risk free asset &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;B_0 = 100&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_T = 110&lt;/math&gt;, and a risky asset &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;S_0 = 100&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_T \in \{90, 110, 130\}&lt;/math&gt; each with probability &lt;math&gt;1/3&lt;/math&gt;.  Let your utility function be given by &lt;math&gt;u(x) = 1 - \exp(-x/10)&lt;/math&gt;.  To find either the bid or ask indifference price for a single European call option with strike 110, first calculate &lt;math&gt;V(x,0)&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;V(x,0) = \max_{\alpha B_0 + \beta S_0 = x} \mathbb{E}[1 - \exp(-.1 \times (\alpha B_T + \beta S_T))]&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; = \max_{\beta} \left[1 - \frac{1}{3} \left[\exp\left(-\frac{1.10 x - 20 \beta}{10}\right) + \exp\left(-\frac{1.10 x}{10}\right) + \exp\left(-\frac{1.10 x + 20 \beta}{10}\right)\right]\right]&lt;/math&gt;.
Which is maximized when &lt;math&gt;\beta = 0&lt;/math&gt;, therefore &lt;math&gt;V(x,0) = 1 - \exp\left(-\frac{1.10 x}{10}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

Now to find the indifference bid price solve for &lt;math&gt;V(x - v^b(1),1)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;V(x - v^b(1),1) = \max_{\alpha B_0 + \beta S_0 = x - v^b(1)} \mathbb{E}[1 - \exp(-.1 \times (\alpha B_T + \beta S_T + C_T))]&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; = \max_{\beta} \left[1 - \frac{1}{3}\left[\exp\left(-\frac{1.10 (x - v^b(1)) - 20 \beta}{10}\right) + \exp\left(-\frac{1.10 (x - v^b(1))}{10}\right) + \exp\left(-\frac{1.10 (x - v^b(1)) + 20 \beta + 20}{10}\right)\right]\right]&lt;/math&gt;
Which is maximized when &lt;math&gt;\beta = -\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, therefore &lt;math&gt;V(x - v^b(1),1) = 1 - \frac{1}{3} \exp(-1.10 x/10) \exp(1.10 v^b(1)/10)\left[1 + 2 \exp(-1)\right]&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore &lt;math&gt;V(x,0) = V(x - v^b(1),1)&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;v^b(1) = \frac{10}{1.1} \log\left(\frac{3}{1+2 \exp(-1)}\right) \approx 4.97&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly solve for &lt;math&gt;v^a(1)&lt;/math&gt; to find the indifference ask price.

==Notes==
* If &lt;math&gt;\left[v^b(k),v^a(k)\right]&lt;/math&gt; are the indifference price bounds for a claim then by definition &lt;math&gt;v^b(k) = -v^a(-k)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=C09 /&gt;
* If &lt;math&gt;v(k)&lt;/math&gt; is the indifference bid price for a claim and &lt;math&gt;v^{sup}(k),v^{sub}(k)&lt;/math&gt; are the [[superhedging price]] and subhedging prices respectively then &lt;math&gt;v^{sub}(k) \leq v(k) \leq v^{sup}(k)&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore, in a [[complete market]] the indifference price is always equal to the price to hedge the claim.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6332">'''Induced gravity''' (or '''emergent gravity''') is an idea in [[quantum gravity]] that [[space-time curvature]] and its dynamics [[emergence|emerge]] as a [[mean field approximation]] of underlying microscopic [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]], similar to the [[fluid mechanics]] approximation of [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s. The concept was originally proposed by [[Andrei Sakharov]] in 1967.

==Overview==
Sakharov observed that many [[condensed matter]] systems give rise to emergent phenomena that are analogous to [[general relativity]]. For example, [[Crystallographic defect|crystal defects]] can look  like [[curvature]] and [[Torsion tensor|torsion]] in an [[Einstein–Cartan theory|Einstein–Cartan spacetime]]. This allows one to create a theory of gravity with torsion from a [[world crystal]] model of spacetime&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| title =  Gravity as Theory of Defects in a Crystal with Only Second-Gradient Elasticity

Sakharov's idea was to start with an arbitrary background [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] (in modern treatments, possibly with torsion) and introduce quantum fields (matter) on it but not introduce any gravitational dynamics explicitly. This gives rise to an [[effective action]] which to [[one-loop order]] contains the [[Einstein–Hilbert action]] with a [[cosmological constant]]. In other words, general relativity arises as an emergent property of matter fields and is not put in by hand. On the other hand, such models typically predict huge [[cosmological constant]]s.

Some argue that the particular models proposed by Sakharov and others have been proven impossible by the [[Weinberg–Witten theorem]]. However, models with emergent gravity are possible as long as other things, such as spacetime dimensions, emerge together with gravity. Developments in [[AdS/CFT correspondence]] after 1997 suggest that the microphysical degrees of freedom in induced gravity might be radically different. The bulk space-time arises as an emergent phenomenon of the quantum degrees of freedom that are entangled and live in the boundary of the space-time. According to some prominent researchers in emergent gravity (such as [[Mark Van Raamsdonk]]) spacetime is built up of quantum entanglement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Raamsdonk|first=Mark|date=19 June 2010|title=Building up spacetime with quantum entanglement.|journal=General Relativity and Gravitation|volume=42|issue=10|pages=2323–2329|doi=10.1007/s10714-010-1034-0|arxiv=1005.3035|bibcode=2010GReGr..42.2323V}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that quantum entanglement is the fundamental property that gives rise to spacetime. In 1995, [[Theodore Jacobson|Jacobson]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacobson|first=Ted|date=1995-08-14|title=Thermodynamics of Spacetime: The Einstein Equation of State|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=75|issue=7|pages=1260–1263|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.75.1260|pmid=10060248|bibcode=1995PhRvL..75.1260J|arxiv=gr-qc/9504004}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the [[Einstein field equations]] can be derived from the first law of thermodynamics applied at local Rindler horizons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6726">'''Landfill mining and reclamation''' (LFMR) is a process whereby solid [[waste]]s 
which have previously been [[landfill]]ed are excavated and processed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enviroalternatives.com/landfill.html Landfill Mining] Landfill Mining, Preserving Resources through Integrated Sustainable Management of Waste, Technical Brief from the World Resource Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; The function of landfill mining is to reduce the amount of landfill mass encapsulated within the closed landfill and/or temporarily remove hazardous material to allow protective measures to be taken before the landfill mass is replaced. In the process, mining recovers valuable recyclable materials, a combustible fraction, soil, and landfill space. The aeration of the landfill soil is a secondary benefit regarding the landfill's future use. The combustible fraction is useful for the generation of power. The overall appearance of the landfill mining procedure is a sequence of processing machines laid out in a functional conveyor system. The operating principle is to excavate, sieve and sort the landfill material.

The concept of  mining was introduced as early as 1953 at the [[Hiriya]] landfill operated by the Dan Region Authority next to the city of [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://som.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/reports/themeB/2003/03B39/03b39.pdf Landfill Mining Paper] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010001855/http://som.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/reports/themeB/2003/03B39/03b39.pdf |date=2006-10-10 }} D.J. van der Zee, ''et al.'' (2004) "Assessing the market opportunities of landfill mining". ''Waste Manag.'' '''24'''(8):795-804.&lt;/ref&gt; Waste contains many resources with high value, the most notable of which are non-ferrous metals such as [[aluminium can]]s and [[scrap metal]]. The concentration of aluminium in many landfills is higher than the concentration of aluminum in [[bauxite]] from which the metal is derived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Landfill mining: new opportunities ahead?|url = http://www.macfarlanes.com/media/1467/landfill-mining-new-opportunities-ahead.pdf|website = macfarlanes.com|publisher = [[Macfarlanes]]|accessdate = 2015-06-11|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150613034513/http://www.macfarlanes.com/media/1467/landfill-mining-new-opportunities-ahead.pdf|archive-date = 2015-06-13|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practical applications ==
Landfill mining is also possible in countries where land is not available for new landfill sites. In this instance landfill space can be reclaimed by the extraction of [[biodegradable waste]] and other substances then refilled with wastes requiring disposal.

Mining construction landfill sites is the simplest form of landfill mining. Construction landfills in the United States contain three basic components, wood, scrap metal and gypsum, or drywall, along with a minimal amount of other construction materials. The wood collected can be used as fuel in coal burning power plants and the scrap metal reprocessed. European landfills tend to have more masonry from demolished bricks, tiles and concrete.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theconstructionindex.co.uk/news/view/the-case-for-pre-demolition-audits The case for pre demolition audits]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mining of municipal landfills is more complicated and has to be based on the expected content of the landfill. Older landfills, in the United States before 1994, were often capped and closed, essentially entombing the waste. This can be beneficial for waste recovery. It can also create a higher risk for [[toxic waste]] and [[leachate]] exposure as the landfill has not fully processed the stewing wastes. Mining of [[bioreactor landfill]]s and properly stabilized modern sanitary landfills provides its own benefits. The biodegradable wastes are more easily sieved out, leaving the non-biodegradable materials readily accessible. The quality of these materials for recycling and reprocessing purposes is not as high as initially recycled materials, however materials such as aluminum and steel are usually excluded from this. 
 
Landfill mining is most useful as a method to remediate hazardous landfills. Landfills that were established before [[landfill liner]] technology was well established often leak their unprocessed leachate into underlying aquifers. This is both an [[environmental hazard]] and also a legal liability. In the US, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] requires closed landfills to be monitored for at least 30 years after waste placement ceases. Mining the landfill simply to lay a safe liner is a last, but sometimes necessary resort.

== Methods ==
The parts of the mining process are the different mining machines. Depending on the complexity of the process more or fewer machines can be used. Machinery is easily transported on trucks from site to site, mounted on trailers.

An [[excavator]] or [[Loader (equipment)|front end loader]] uncovers the landfilled materials and places them on a moving floor conveyor belt to be taken to the sorting machinery. A [[trommel]] is used to separate materials by size. First, a large trommel separates materials like appliances and fabrics. A smaller trommel then allows the biodegraded soil fraction to pass through leaving non-biodegradable, recyclable materials on the screen to be collected. 

An electromagnet is used to remove the [[ferrous]] material from the waste mass as it passes along the conveyor belt.

A [[Loader (equipment)|front end loader]] is used to move sorted materials to trucks for further processing.

Odor control sprayers are wheeled tractors with a cab and movable spray arm mounted on a rotating platform. A large reservoir tank mounted behind the cab holds neutralizing agents, usually in liquid form, to reduce the smell of exposed wastes.

Depending on the level of resource recovery, material can be put through an [[air classifier]] which separates light organic material from heavy organic material. The separate streams are then loaded, by front end loaders, onto trucks either for further processing or for sale. Further manual processing can be done on site if processing facilities are too far away to justify the transportation costs.

The '''Looting of Battleford''' began at the end of  March, 1885, during the [[North-West Rebellion]], in the town of [[Battleford]], Saskatchewan, then a part of the Northwest Territories.

Within days of the [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] victory at the [[Battle of Duck Lake]] on March 26, [[1885 in Canada|1885]]. [[Cree|Cree bands]] sympathetic to the Métis cause and with grievances of their own began raiding stores and farms in the western part of the [[District of Saskatchewan]] for  arms, ammunition and food supplies while civilians fled to the larger settlements and forts of the [[Districts of the Northwest Territories|North-West Territories]].

Prominent leaders of this uprising were Chief [[Poundmaker]] and Chief [[Big Bear]]. Poundmaker and his band had a [[Indian reserve|reserve]] near present-day [[Battle of Cut Knife|Cut Knife]] about 50&amp;nbsp;km (31 miles) west of Fort Battleford. Big Bear and his band had settled near [[Frog Lake Massacre|Frog Lake]] about 55&amp;nbsp;km (34 miles) northwest of [[Battle of Fort Pitt|Fort Pitt]] but had not yet selected a reserve site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Geography==
The District of Saskatchewan in 1885 was divided into three sub-districts and had a population of 10,595. To the east the Carrot River sub-district with 1,770 people remained quiet. The Prince Albert sub-district located in the centre of the district had a population of 5,373 which included the [[Southbranch Settlement|Southbranch settlements]] with about 1,300. The Southbranch settlements was the centre of [[Louis Riel]]'s [[Provisional Government of Saskatchewan|Provisional Government]] during the Rebellion. To the west where the Cree uprising led by Poundmaker and Big Bear occurred was the Battleford sub-district with 3,603 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Siege of Battleford==
[[File:Map of Battleford 1885.jpg|thumb|400px|Map of Battleford 1885]]
On March 28 as news that several [[First Nations|Indian bands]] including Poundmaker's were on their way to Battleford settlers began moving into the nearby [[North-West Mounted Police]] post, [[Fort Battleford]] which was under the command of Colonel Morris and 25 police. Over the next several days 500 civilians would take refuge within the [[palisade]]s. Many crossed over an unstable ice bridge on the Battle River leaving most of their possessions behind in the Old Town. During the night of March 29 nearby [[Homestead (buildings)|homesteads]] were raided their horses and cattle rounded up by the bands.&lt;ref name="looting battleford"/&gt;

Also on the trail to join Poundmaker in Battleford were the [[Mosquito-Grizzly Bear's Head-Lean Man|Assiniboine from the Eagle Hills]] approximately 30&amp;nbsp;km south of Battleford. On March 29 they killed their farm instructor John Payne and raided homesteads on the way killing a farmer by the name of Fremont.&lt;ref name="looting battleford"/&gt;

On March 30 Poundmaker asked for a meeting with the Indian agent J. M. Rae. 
After Rae refused to meet with him the combined Battleford bands took food and supplies from the abandoned stores and houses. The next day the bands camped a few miles away bringing with them their looted provisions including cattle and horses then eventually returned to Poundmaker's reserve.&lt;ref name="looting battleford"/&gt;
 
While the New Town was protected by its proximity to the Fort and its cannon the Old Town was not. Every day until the arrival of [[William Dillon Otter|Colonel Otter]]'s column on April 24 the occupants of the Fort watched as the Old Town about a mile away was plundered. Stolen vehicles and horses carried away the supplies of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and the other merchants. All the public buildings were sacked including the [[Battleford Industrial School]] (located in the Old Government House).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Historiographical interpretation==
The nature of the Cree advance on Battleford, like the entire 1885 Rebellion, is a source of [[historiographical]] controversy.  Historian [[Douglas Hill (historian)|Douglas Hill]] characterized the Cree group as a "war party&amp;nbsp;... ready to take revenge for a winter of incalculable suffering" who "swooped on Battleford, killing six whites". [[George F. G. Stanley]]'s writing on the subject indicated that the Cree were not murderous but more haphazard and bumbling: they "[did] not appear to have in mind an attack upon the town" but were content with "prowling around the neighbourhood".  While [[John L. Tobias]] says that the Crees tried to demonstrate their "peaceful intent" by including women and children in their group, simply took food to sustain themselves after finding the town abandoned, and then withdrew to avoid conflict with the police.

One application of a Mars flyby is for a human mission, where after landing and staying on the surface for some time the ascent stage has a [[space rendezvous]] with another, unmanned spacecraft, that was launched separately from Earth, flying by. This  would mean the ascent stage of the lander to reach the speed necessary equal to that of the spacecraft flying by, but the resources needed for Earth return would not have to enter or leave Mars orbit.&lt;ref name="portree2001flyby"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Astronautica - FLEM"&gt;[http://www.astronautix.com/craft/flem.html Astronautica - FLEM]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spacecraft they live in on the journey to Mars does the flyby, but the crew separates and goes into a lander.&lt;ref name="portree2001flyby"/&gt; The Excursion module's ascent stage must rejoin the main spacecraft before it gets too far away.&lt;ref name="portree2001flyby"/&gt; An advantage is that the resources needed for Earth return don't have to enter and leave Mars orbit, but the ascent stage has to perform [[space rendezvous]] in solar orbit and the time on Mars is constrained by the need to this.&lt;ref name="portree2001flyby"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Astronautica - FLEM"/&gt; [[Mars cycler]]s orbit the Sun in such a way as to pass by Mars and the Earth on regular intervals, performing Mars flybys on regular intervals. The crews would live on the stations during the interplanetary voyages. The concept for [[Flyby Excursion Landing Module]] is that a lander and flyby would separate in solar orbit, the lander would accelerate to get to Mars first, then land on Mars meanwhile the other segment does a Mars flyby, then the lander takes off and rendezvous with the flyby segment transferring the crew over.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2014/01/to-mars-by-flyby-landing-excursion-mode-flem-1966/ W.I.R.E.D.]&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Mars Excursion Module]] (MEM))

Alternately, a flyby-only human mission is also possible, without detaching at Mars, but to [[Gravitational slingshot|slingshot]] around Mars and back to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/dennis-titos-mission-to-mars-launching-in-2018-for-the-children-and-to-beat-china/2013/02/27/4a4a98ce-8135-11e2-8074-b26a871b165a_story.html "Dennis Tito’s mission to Mars: Launching in 2018 for the children (and to beat China)"], Brian Vastag, 27 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Micha Popper''' is a [[professor emeritus]] in the department of [[psychology]] at the [[University of Haifa]], [[Israel]].  He was the commander of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) Leadership Development School (LDS), co-founder and director of the Institute for Quality Leadership in Israel, and, from 1995 he was a faculty member and head of the [[Organizational Psychology]] program at the University of Haifa.  

==Biography==
Popper received his BA in the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and his MA and PhD in [[Tel Aviv University]]. 

==Research areas== 
At the beginning of his research career Popper focused on exploring the origins of leadership in early childhood. Most knowledge in this field is inferred from biographies and studies (based mostly on psycho-dynamic analyses) of well-known people. His  work in this field led him to formulate a conceptual framework dealing with three components relevant to being and functioning as a leader: (1) the psychological potential to lead (P); (2) the motivation to be in a leadership position (M); (3) the environment (e.g. role models, accessibility to leadership experiences...), namely the developmental component (D). Popper and his colleagues have contributed to the identification, definition, evaluation and measurement of each of these components&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Popper, M., Amit, K., Gal, R., Sinai, M. &amp; Lissak, A. (2004). The capacity to lead: Major psychological differences between “leaders” and “non-leaders”. Military Psychology 16, 4, 245-263).&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In his later career, Popper observed that in the Western world, particularly the US, leadership was usually perceived as a positive phenomenon and leaders were socially respected, often even admired. However, history also points to dark manifestations of leadership. This aspect has been discussed by historians but largely neglected in psychological research on leadership. Popper’s work sheds light on the psychological foundations of the dark side of leadership&lt;ref&gt;see e.g., Popper, M. (2001). Hypnotic Leadership. Westport, CT: Prager.&lt;/ref&gt;. 
 
The continuation of Popper’s professional development led him to realize that psychological research on leadership was excessively preoccupied with leaders and there were not enough theoretical and empirical attempts to decipher the phenomenon of followership, without which the phenomenon of leadership cannot be fully understood. 

In recent years Popper’s work has focused on  primary foundations of followership,  both the phylogenetic elements and  the cultural components that “color” differently leaders’ perceptions and images in various cultures. &lt;ref&gt;Examples of this approach are Popper, M. (2012). Fact and fantasy about leadership. London: Edward Elgar; Popper, M., Castelnovo, O. (2017).The function of great leaders in human culture: A cultural-evolutionary perspective. Leadership, on line, of August, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;.
In addition to his work in the domain of leadership, for many years Popper has also studied the field of “[[organizational learning]].” His work in this area has focused mostly on two questions:.How do people learn from their own experiences?  and, how do lessons learned on a personal level become organizational knowledge? 

The first question involves the development of concepts and methodologies for identifying “tacit knowledge” – knowledge created out of experience without awareness. Such knowledge is at the disposal of people when solving problems (as Polanyi puts it:” We know more than we can tell”). 
The second question led Popper and his colleagues to study the structural and cultural aspects that characterize effective learning in organizations. These studies focused on organizational learning mechanisms such as debriefing of air force pilots or debriefing of medical staff performing operatrions&lt;ref&gt;The structural-cultural approach to organizational learning is presented in Lipshitz, R., Friedman, V. &amp; Popper, M. (2007). Demystifying Organizational Learning. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Motivation''' is the reason for people's [[Action_(philosophy)|actions]], willingness and goals. Motivation is derived from the word ''motive'' which is defined as a need that requires satisfaction. These [[Need|needs]] could also be wants or desires that are acquired through influence of culture, society, lifestyle, etc. or generally innate. Motivation is one's direction to [[behavior]], or what causes a person to want to repeat a behavior, a set of force that acts behind the motives. An individual's motivation may be inspired by others or events (extrinsic motivation)&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; or it may come from within the individual (intrinsic motivation)&lt;ref name="Ryan, R. M. 2000" /&gt;. Motivation has been considered as one of the most important reasons that inspires a person to move forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jodai|first=Hojat|last2=Zafarghandi|first2=Amir Mahda Vi|last3=Tous|first3=Maryam Danaye|date=2013-01-01|title=Motivation, Integrativeness, Organizational Influence, Anxiety, and English Achievement|journal=Glottotheory|language=en|volume=4|issue=2|doi=10.1524/glot.2013.0012|issn=2196-6907}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mastering motivation to allow sustained and deliberate practice is central to high levels of achievement e.g. in the worlds of elite sport, medicine or music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Ericsson |first=Karl Anders|title=Peak: Secrets from the new science of expertise|isbn=9781531864880|oclc=961226136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neuroscience==
{{Main article|Motivational salience}}
Motivation as a desire to perform an action is usually defined as having two parts, directional such as directed towards a positive stimulus or away from a negative one, as well as the activated "seeking phase" and consummatory "liking phase". This type of motivation has [[neurobiological]] roots in the [[basal ganglia]], and mesolimbic, [[dopaminergic pathways]]. Activated "seeking" behavior, such as locomotor activity, is influenced by dopaminergic drugs, and [[microdialysis]] experiments reveal that [[dopamine]] is released during the anticipation of a [[reward system |reward]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |doi=10.1016/S0959-4388(96)80077-8  |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222809901|title=Neurobehavioural mechanisms of reward and motivation|journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology|volume=6|issue=2|pages=228–236|year=1996|last1=Robbins|first1=Trevor W.|last2=Everitt|first2=Barry J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "wanting behavior" associated with a rewarding stimulus can be increased by microinjections of [[dopamine]] and dopaminergic drugs in the [[Nucleus accumbens |dorsorostral nucleus accumbens]] and [[Ventral pallidum |posterior ventral palladum]].  [[Opioid]] injections in this area produce pleasure, however outside of these [[hedonic hotspots]] they create an increased desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Berridge |first1=Kent C |last2=Kringelbach |first2=Morten L |title=Neuroscience of affect: brain mechanisms of pleasure and displeasure |journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=294–303 |doi=10.1016/j.conb.2013.01.017 |pmid=23375169 |pmc=3644539 |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, depletion or inhibition of dopamine in neurons of the nucleus accumbens decreases appetitive but not consummatory behavior. Dopamine is further implicated in motivation as administration of amphetamine increased the break point in a progressive ratio self-reinforcement schedule.  That is, subjects were willing to go to greater lengths (e.g. press a lever more times) to obtain a reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Salamone |first1=John D. |last2=Correa |first2=Mercè |title= The mysterious motivational functions of mesolimbic dopamine|journal=Neuron |date=8 November 2012 |volume=76 |issue=3 |pages=470–485 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2012.10.021 |issn=0896-6273 |pmid=23141060 |pmc=4450094}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological theories==
Motivation can be conceived of as a cycle in which thoughts influence behaviors, drive performance affects thoughts, and the cycle begins again. Each stage of the cycle is composed of many dimensions including attitudes, beliefs, intentions, effort, and withdrawal which can all affect the motivation that an individual experiences. Most psychological theories hold that motivation exists purely within the individual, but [[Cultural-historical psychology|socio-cultural theories]] express motivation as an outcome of participation in actions and activities within the [[cultural]] context of social groups.&lt;ref name="Rueda and Moll 1994"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rueda|first1=Richard|last2=Moll|first2=Luis C.|editor1-last=O'Neill, Jr.|editor1-first=Harold F.|editor2-last=Drillings|editor2-first=Michael|title=Motivation: Theory and Research|date=1994|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.|location=Hillsdale, NJ|isbn=978-0-8058-1286-2|chapter=Chapter 7: A Sociocultural Perspective on Motivation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural theories===
The natural system assumes that people have higher order needs, which contrasts with the rational theory that suggests people dislike work and only respond to rewards and punishment.&lt;ref name="Lecture 10/1"&gt;Dobbin, Frank. “From Incentives to Teamwork: Rational and Natural Management Systems.” Lecture. Harvard University. Cambridge, Massachusetts. 1 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Douglas McGregor|McGregor's]] [[Theory X and Theory Y#Theory Y|Theory Y]], human behavior is based on satisfying a hierarchy of needs: physiological, safety, social, ego, and [[self-fulfillment]].&lt;ref name="McGregor"&gt;McGregor, D., 1960. The Human Side of Enterprise, New York, McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

Physiological needs are the lowest and most important level. These fundamental requirements include food, rest, shelter, and exercise. After physiological needs are satisfied, employees can focus on safety needs, which include “protection against danger, threat, deprivation.”&lt;ref name="McGregor"/&gt; However, if management makes arbitrary or biased employment decisions, then an employee's safety needs are unfulfilled.

The next set of needs is social, which refers to the desire for acceptance, affiliation, reciprocal friendships and love. As such, the natural system of management assumes that close-knit work teams are productive. Accordingly, if an employee's social needs are unmet, then he will act disobediently.&lt;ref name="McGregor"/&gt;

There are two types of egoistic needs, the second-highest order of needs. The first type refers to one's self-esteem, which encompasses self-confidence, independence, achievement, competence, and knowledge. The second type of needs deals with reputation, status, recognition, and respect from colleagues.&lt;ref name="McGregor"/&gt; Egoistic needs are much more difficult to satisfy.

The highest order of needs is for self-fulfillment, including recognition of one's full potential, areas for self-improvement, and the opportunity for creativity. This differs from the rational system, which assumes that people prefer routine and security to creativity.&lt;ref name="Lecture 10/1"/&gt; Unlike the rational management system, which assumes that humans don’t care about these higher order needs, the natural system is based on these needs as a means for motivation.

====Self-management through teamwork====
To successfully manage and motivate employees, the natural system posits that being part of a group is necessary.&lt;ref name="Mayo"&gt;Elton Mayo, 1984 [1949]. “Hawthorne and the Western Electric Company.” Pp. 279-292 in Organization Theory: Selected Readings. Second Edition. Edited by D.S. Pugh. New York: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of structural changes in social order, the workplace is more fluid and adaptive according to [[Elton Mayo|Mayo]]. As a result, individual employees have lost their sense of stability and security, which can be provided by a membership in a group. However, if teams continuously change within jobs, then employees feel anxious, empty, and irrational and become harder to work with.&lt;ref name="Mayo"/&gt; The innate desire for lasting human association and management “is not related to single workers, but always to working groups.”&lt;ref name="Mayo"/&gt; In groups, employees will self-manage and form relevant customs, duties, and traditions.

====Wage incentives====
Humans are motivated by additional factors besides wage incentives.&lt;ref name="Roethlisberger book"&gt;Roethlisberger, F. J. (F, et al. Management and the Worker; an Account of a Research Program Conducted by the Western Electric Company, Hawthorne Works, Chicago,. Cambridge, Mass.,: Harvard university press, 1939. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the rational theory of motivation, people are not driven toward economic interests per the natural system. For instance, the straight piecework system pays employees based on each unit of their output. Based on studies such as the Bank Wiring Observation Room, using a piece rate incentive system does not lead to higher production.&lt;ref name="Roethlisberger book"/&gt; Employees actually set upper limits on each person's daily output. These actions stand “in direct opposition to the ideas underlying their system of financial incentive, which countenanced no upper limit to performance other than physical capacity.”&lt;ref name="Roethlisberger book"/&gt; Therefore, as opposed to the rational system that depends on economic rewards and punishments, the natural system of management assumes that humans are also motivated by non-economic factors.

====Autonomy: increased motivation for autonomous tasks====
Employees seek autonomy and responsibility in their work, contrary to assumptions of the rational theory of management. Because supervisors have direct authority over employees, they must ensure that the employee's actions are in line with the standards of efficient conduct.&lt;ref name="Roethlisberger book"/&gt; This creates a sense of restriction on the employee and these constraints are viewed as “annoying and seemingly functioned only as subordinating or differentiating mechanisms."&lt;ref name="Roethlisberger book"/&gt; Accordingly, the natural management system assumes that employees prefer autonomy and responsibility on the job and dislike arbitrary rules and overwhelming supervision. An individual's motivation to complete a task is increased when this task is autonomous. When the motivation to complete a task comes from an "external pressure" that pressure then "undermines" a person's motivation, and as a result decreases a persons desire to complete the task. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sharing Motivation|last=Walton, Cohen|first=Gregory, Geoffrey|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=New York|pages=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rational motivations===
The idea that human beings are rational and [[human behavior]] is guided by reason is an old one. However, recent research (on [[satisficing]] for example) has significantly undermined the idea of [[homo economicus]] or of [[perfect rationality]] in favour of a more [[bounded rationality]]. The field of [[Behavioural Economics|behavioural economics]] is particularly concerned with the limits of rationality in economic agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Motivation|url=http://panoramaconsulting.co.ke/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=60&amp;Itemid=2|website=panoramaconsulting.co.ke|accessdate=8 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103070653/http://panoramaconsulting.co.ke/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=60&amp;Itemid=2|archivedate=3 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incentive theories: intrinsic and extrinsic motivation===
Motivation can be divided into two different theories known as ''intrinsic'' (internal or inherent) motivation and ''extrinsic'' (external) motivation.

====Intrinsic motivation====
{{See also|Flow (psychology)|Ikigai}}
Intrinsic motivation has been studied since the early 1970s. Intrinsic motivation is the self-desire to seek out new things and new challenges, to analyze one's capacity, to observe and to gain knowledge.&lt;ref name="Ryan, R. M. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ryan | first1 = R. M. | last2 = Deci | first2 = E. L. | year = 2000| title = Self-determination theory and the facilitation of intrinsic motivation, social development, and well-being | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 55 | issue = 1| pages = 68–78 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.55.1.68 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.529.4370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is driven by an interest or enjoyment in the task itself, and exists within the individual rather than relying on external pressures or a desire for consideration. The phenomenon of intrinsic motivation was first acknowledged within experimental studies of animal behavior. In these studies, it was evident that the organisms would engage in playful and curiosity-driven behaviors in the absence of [[reward system|reward]]. Intrinsic motivation is a natural motivational tendency and is a critical element in cognitive, social, and physical development.&lt;ref name=Ryan&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ryan |first=Richard |author2=Edward L. Deci |title=Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivations: Classic Definitions and New Directions |journal=[[Contemporary Educational Psychology]] |year=2000 |volume=25  | issue = 1 |pages=54–67 |doi=10.1006/ceps.1999.1020 |pmid=10620381 |citeseerx=10.1.1.318.808}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two necessary elements for intrinsic motivation are [[self-determination]] and an increase in perceived competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Intrinsic motivation and self-determination in human behavior |last=L. |first=Deci, Edward |others=Ryan, Richard M. |isbn=9781489922717 |location=New York |oclc=861705534 |date = 2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, the cause of the behavior must be internal, known as internal local of causality, and the individual who engages in the behavior must perceive that the task increases their competence.&lt;ref name="Ryan" /&gt; 

Students who are intrinsically motivated are more likely to engage in the task willingly as well as work to improve their skills, which will increase their capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wigfield | first1 = A. | last2 = Guthrie | first2 = J. T. | last3 = Tonks | first3 = S. | last4 = Perencevich | first4 = K. C. | year = 2004 | title = Children's motivation for reading: Domain specificity and instructional influences | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Research | volume = 97 | issue = 6| pages = 299–309 | doi=10.3200/joer.97.6.299-310}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students are likely to be intrinsically motivated if they...
* attribute their educational results to factors under their own control, also known as autonomy or [[locus of control]]
* believe they have the skills to be effective agents in reaching their desired goals, also known as [[self-efficacy]] beliefs
* are interested in mastering a topic, not just in achieving good grades

An example of intrinsic motivation is when an employee becomes an IT professional because he or she wants to learn about how computer users interact with computer networks. The employee has the intrinsic motivation to gain more knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=N Root III |first1=George |title=Examples of Intrinsic Workplace Motivation |url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/examples-intrinsic-workplace-motivation-11382.html |website=Chron |accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Art for art's sake]] is an example of intrinsic motivation in the domain of art.

Traditionally, researchers thought of motivations to use computer systems to be primarily driven by extrinsic purposes; however, many modern systems have their use driven primarily by intrinsic motivations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Benjamin Lowry | first1 = Paul | last2 = Gaskin | first2 = James | last3 = Twyman | first3 = Nathan W. | last4 = Hammer | first4 = Bryan | last5 = Roberts | first5 = Tom L. | year = 2013 | title = Taking 'fun and games' seriously: Proposing the hedonic-motivation system adoption model (HMSAM) | ssrn = 2177442 | journal = Journal of the Association for Information Systems | volume = 14 | issue = 11| pages = 617–671 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of such systems used primarily to fulfil users' intrinsic motivations, include on-line gaming, virtual worlds, online shopping&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parker |first1=Christopher J. |last2=Wang |first2=Huchen |title=Examining hedonic and utilitarian motivations for m-commerce fashion retail app engagement |journal=Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=487–506 |doi=10.1108/JFMM-02-2016-0015 |year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;, learning/education, online dating, digital music repositories, social networking, online pornography, gamified systems, and general gamification. Even traditional management information systems (e.g., ERP, CRM) are being 'gamified' such that both extrinsic and intrinsic motivations must increasingly be considered.

Not only can intrinsic motivation be used in a personal setting, but it can also be implemented and utilized in a social environment. Instead of attaining mature desires, such as those presented above via internet which can be attained on one's own, intrinsic motivation can be used to assist extrinsic motivation to attain a goal. For example, Eli, a 4-year-old with autism, wants to achieve the goal of playing with a toy train&lt;ref&gt;StoryStudio, . "One type of therapy is addressing autism, dementia, and so much more." San Francisco Gate, California Applied Behavior Analysis , 4 Aug. 2017, blog.sfgate.com/storystudio/2017/08/04/one-type-of-therapy-is-tackling-autism-dementia-and-so-much-more/. Accessed 15 Nov. 2017. &lt;/ref&gt;. To get the toy, he must first communicate to his therapist that he wants it. His desire to play is strong enough to be considered intrinsic motivation because it is a natural feeling, and his desire to communicate with his therapist to get the train can be considered extrinsic motivation because the outside object is a reward (see incentive theory). Communicating with the therapist is the first, slightly more challenging goal that stands in the way of achieving his larger goal of playing with the train. Achieving these goals in attainable pieces is also known as the [[goal-setting theory]]. 

''Advantages'': Intrinsic motivation can be long-lasting and self-sustaining.  Efforts to build this kind of motivation are also typically efforts at promoting student learning.  Such efforts often focus on the subject rather than rewards or punishments.

''Disadvantages'': Efforts at fostering intrinsic motivation can be slow to affect behavior and can require special and lengthy preparation.  Students are individuals, so a variety of approaches may be needed to motivate different students. It is often helpful to know what interests one's students in order to connect these interests with the subject matter. This requires getting to know one's students. Also, it helps if the instructor is interested in the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Motivating Students|url=http://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/motivating-students/|accessdate=4 March 2015|date=2010-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Extrinsic motivation====
{{See also|Goal orientation}}
Extrinsic motivation comes from influences outside of the individual. In extrinsic motivation, the harder question to answer is where do people get the motivation to carry out and continue to push with persistence. Usually extrinsic motivation is used to attain outcomes that a person wouldn't get from intrinsic motivation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ryan | first1 = R. M. | last2 = Deci | first2 = E. L. |year = 2000 | title = Self-determination theory and the facilitation of intrinsic motivation, social development, and well-being | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 55 | issue = 1| pages = 68–78 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.55.1.68| citeseerx = 10.1.1.529.4370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Common extrinsic motivations are [[reward system|rewards]] (for example money or grades) for showing the desired behavior, and the threat of punishment following misbehavior. Competition is an extrinsic motivator because it encourages the performer to win and to beat others, not simply to enjoy the intrinsic rewards of the activity. A cheering crowd and the desire to win a trophy are also extrinsic incentives.&lt;ref name=Motivation&gt;{{cite web |last=Dewani |first=Vijay |title=Motivation |url=http://www.slideshare.net/vijaydewani7/motivation-15959567 |publisher=slideshare |accessdate=22 March 2013|date=2013-01-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most simple distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic motivation is the type of reasons or goals that lead to an action. While intrinsic motivation refers to doing something because it is inherently interesting or enjoyable, extrinsic motivation, refers to doing something because it leads to a separable outcome. Extrinsic motivation thus contrasts with intrinsic motivation, which is doing an activity simply for the enjoyment of the activity itself, instead of for its instrumental value. &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1006/ceps.1999.1020| pmid=10620381|title = Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivations: Classic Definitions and New Directions| journal=Contemporary Educational Psychology| volume=25| issue=1| pages=54–67|year = 2000|last1 = Ryan|first1 = Richard M.| last2=Deci| first2=Edward L.| citeseerx=10.1.1.318.808}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social psychological research has indicated that extrinsic rewards can lead to [[overjustification effect|overjustification]] and a subsequent reduction in intrinsic motivation. In one study demonstrating this effect, children who expected to be (and were) rewarded with a ribbon and a gold star for drawing pictures spent less time playing with the drawing materials in subsequent observations than children who were assigned to an unexpected reward condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lepper | first1 = Mark R. | last2 = Greene | first2 = David | last3 = Nisbet | first3 = Richard | year = 1973 | title = Undermining Children's Intrinsic Interest with Extrinsic Reward; A Test of 'Overjustification' Hypothesis | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 129–37 | doi=10.1037/h0035519}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, another study showed that third graders who were rewarded with a book showed more reading behavior in the future, implying that some rewards do not undermine intrinsic motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marinak | first1 = Barbara A. | last2 = Gambrell | first2 = Linda B. | year = 2008 | title = Intrinsic Motivation and Rewards: What Sustains Young Children's Engagement with Text? | url = | journal = Literacy Research and Instruction | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 9–26 | doi=10.1080/19388070701749546}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the provision of extrinsic rewards might reduce the desirability of an activity, the use of extrinsic constraints, such as the threat of punishment, against performing an activity has actually been found to increase one's intrinsic interest in that activity. In one study, when children were given mild threats against playing with an attractive toy, it was found that the threat actually served to increase the child's interest in the toy, which was previously undesirable to the child in the absence of threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = T. D. | last2 = Lassiter | first2 = G. D. | year = 1982 | title = Increasing intrinsic interest with superfluous extrinsic constraints | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 42 | issue = 5| pages = 811–819 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.42.5.811}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== '''Flow theory''' ===
Desirable subjective state a person experiences when completely involved in some challenging activity that matches the individual skill.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Motivation : biological, psychological, environmental|last=Lambert.|first=Deckers|date=2014|publisher=Pearson|isbn=9781292027999|oclc=1040982893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“A state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter; the experience is so enjoyable that people will continue to do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it.”

– Csikszentmihalyi, 1990&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://positivepsychologyprogram.com/mihaly-csikszentmihalyi-father-of-flow/|title=Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi: All About Flow &amp; Positive Psychology|date=2016-12-16|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flow theory, the idea of flow theory as first conceptualized by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. Flow in the context of motivation can be seen as an activity that is not too hard, frustrating or madding, or too easy boring and done too fast. If one has achieved perfect flow, then the activity has reached maximum potential. &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Flow is part of something called positive psychology of the psychology of happiness. Positive psychology looks into what makes a person happy. Flow can be considered as achieving happiness or at the least positive feelings. A study that was published in the journal ''Emotion'' looked at flow experienced in college students playing Tetris. The students that they were being evaluated on looks then told to wait and play Tetris. There were three categories; Easy, normal, and hard. The students that played Tetris on normal level experienced flow and were less stressed about the evaluation. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/11/05/662212524/cant-stop-worrying-try-tetris-to-ease-your-mind|title=Can't Stop Worrying? Try Tetris To Ease Your Mind|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Csikszentmihalyi describes 8 characteristics of flow as a complete concentration on the task, clarity of goals and reward in mind and immediate feedback, transformation of time (speeding up/slowing down of time), the experience is intrinsically rewarding, effortlessness and ease, there is a balance between challenge and skills, actions and awareness are merged, losing self-conscious rumination, there is a feeling of control over the task.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The activity no longer becomes something seen as a means to an end and it becomes something an individual wants to do. This can be seen as someone who likes to run for the sheer joy of running and not because they need to do it for exercise or because they want to brag about it. Peak flow can be different for each person. It could take an individual years to reach flow or only moments. If an individual becomes too good at an activity they can become bored. If the challenge becomes too hard then the individual could become discouraged and want to quit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/one-among-many/201502/flow-and-happiness|title=Flow and Happiness|website=Psychology Today|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behaviorist theories===

While many theories on motivation have a [[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]] perspective, [[Behaviorism|behaviorists]] focus only on observable behavior and theories founded on experimental evidence. In the view of behaviorism, motivation is understood as a question about what factors cause, prevent, or withhold various behaviors, while the question of, for instance, conscious motives would be ignored. Where others would speculate about such things as values, drives, or needs, that may not be observed directly, behaviorists are interested in the observable variables that affect the type, intensity, frequency and duration of observable behavior. Through the basic research of such scientists as [[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlov]], [[John B. Watson|Watson]] and [[B. F. Skinner|Skinner]], several basic mechanisms that govern behavior have been identified. The most important of these are classical conditioning and operant conditioning.

====Classical and operant conditioning====
{{Main article|Motivational salience}}
In [[Classical conditioning|classical (or respondent) conditioning]], behavior is understood as responses triggered by certain environmental or physical stimuli. They can be ''unconditioned'', such as in-born reflexes, or learned through the pairing of an unconditioned stimulus with a different stimulus, which then becomes a conditioned stimulus. In relation to motivation, classical conditioning might be seen as one explanation as to why an individual performs certain responses and behaviors in certain situations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Applied Behavior Analysis|last = Cooper|first = John O|publisher = Pearson Education|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0-13-129327-4|location = Upper Saddle River, NJ, USA|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Learning and Complex Behavior|last = Donahoe|first = J.W.|publisher = Ledgetop Publishing|year = 2004|isbn = 978-0-9762371-0-5|location = Richmond, MA, USA|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a dentist might wonder why a patient does not seem motivated to show up for an appointment, with the explanation being that the patient has associated the dentist (conditioned stimulus) with the pain (unconditioned stimulus) that elicits a fear response (conditioned response), leading to the patient being reluctant to visit the dentist.

In [[operant conditioning]], the type and frequency of behavior is determined mainly by its consequences. If a certain behavior, in the presence of a certain stimulus, is followed by a desirable consequence (a [[Reinforcement|reinforcer]]), the emitted behavior will increase in frequency in the future, in the presence of the stimulus that preceded the behavior (or a similar one). Conversely, if the behavior is followed by something undesirable (a [[Punishment (psychology)|punisher]]), the behavior is less likely to occur in the presence of the stimulus. In a similar manner, removal of a stimulus directly following the behavior might either increase or decrease the frequency of that behavior in the future (negative reinforcement or punishment).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For instance, a student that gained praise and a good grade after turning in a paper, might seem more motivated in writing papers in the future ([[positive reinforcement]]); if the same student put in a lot of work on a task without getting any praise for it, he or she might seem less motivated to do school work in the future ([[negative punishment]]). If a student starts to cause trouble in class gets punished with something he or she dislikes, such as detention ([[positive punishment]]), that behavior would decrease in the future. The student might seem more motivated to behave in class, presumably in order to avoid further detention ([[negative reinforcement]]).

The strength of reinforcement or punishment is dependent on [[Schedules of reinforcement|schedule]] and timing. A reinforcer or punisher affects the future frequency of a behavior most strongly if it occurs within seconds of the behavior. A behavior that is reinforced intermittently, at unpredictable intervals, will be more robust and persistent, compared to one that is reinforced every time the behavior is performed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, if the misbehaving student in the above example was punished a week after the troublesome behavior, that might not affect future behavior.

In addition to these basic principles, [[Stimulus control|environmental stimuli also affect behavior]]. Behavior is punished or reinforced in the context of whatever stimuli were present just before the behavior was performed, which means that a particular behavior might not be affected in every environmental context, or situation, after it is punished or reinforced in one specific context.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A lack of praise for school-related behavior might, for instance, not decrease after-school sports-related behavior that is usually reinforced by praise.

The various mechanisms of operant conditioning may be used to understand the motivation for various behaviors by examining what happens just after the behavior (the consequence), in what context the behavior is performed or not performed (the antecedent), and under what circumstances (motivating operators).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=====Incentive motivation=====
{{hatnote|Main section: {{sectionlink|Motivational salience|Incentive salience}}}}
Incentive theory is a specific theory of motivation, derived partly from behaviorist principles of reinforcement, which concerns an incentive or motive to do something. The most common incentive would be a compensation. Compensation can be tangible or intangible, It helps in motivating the employees in their corporate life, students in academics and inspire to do more and more to achieve profitability in every field. Studies show that if the person receives the [[reward system|reward]] immediately, the effect is greater, and decreases as delay lengthens.&lt;ref name="Rani"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Rani|first1 = Rekha|last2 = Kumar-Lenka|first2 = Sameer|title = Motivation and Work Motivation: Concepts, Theories &amp; Researches|journal = International Journal of Research in IT &amp; Management|date = August 2012|volume = 2|issue = 8|pages = 4–6|url = http://www.euroasiapub.org/download.php?filename=iWv27FSHKOjyv8v.pdf&amp;new=3.pdf|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150924003143/http://www.euroasiapub.org/download.php?filename=iWv27FSHKOjyv8v.pdf&amp;new=3.pdf|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 2015-09-24|accessdate = August 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repetitive action-reward combination can cause the action to become a habit.&lt;ref name="Rani" /&gt;

"Reinforcers and reinforcement principles of behavior differ from the hypothetical construct of reward." A reinforcer is anything that follows an action, with the intentions that the action will now occur more frequently. From this perspective, the concept of distinguishing between intrinsic and extrinsic forces is irrelevant.

Incentive theory in psychology treats motivation and behavior of the individual as they are influenced by beliefs, such as engaging in activities that are expected to be profitable. Incentive theory is promoted by behavioral psychologists, such as B.F. Skinner. Incentive theory is especially supported by Skinner in his philosophy of Radical behaviorism, meaning that a person's actions always have social ramifications: and if actions are positively received people are more likely to act in this manner, or if negatively received people are less likely to act in this manner.

Incentive theory distinguishes itself from other motivation theories, such as drive theory, in the direction of the motivation. In incentive theory, stimuli "attract" a person towards them, and push them towards the stimulus. In terms of behaviorism, incentive theory involves positive reinforcement: the reinforcing stimulus has been conditioned to make the person happier. As opposed to in drive theory, which involves negative reinforcement: a stimulus has been associated with the removal of the punishment—the lack of homeostasis in the body. For example, a person has come to know that if they eat when hungry, it will eliminate that negative feeling of hunger, or if they drink when thirsty, it will eliminate that negative feeling of thirst.&lt;ref name="Rani" /&gt;

====Motivating operations====
[[Motivating operation]]s, MOs, relate to the field of motivation in that they help improve understanding aspects of behavior that are not covered by operant conditioning. In operant conditioning, the function of the reinforcer is to influence ''future behavior''. The presence of a stimulus believed to function as a reinforcer does not according to this terminology explain the current behavior of an organism – only previous instances of reinforcement of that behavior (in the same or similar situations) do. Through the behavior-altering effect of MOs, it is possible to affect current behavior of an individual, giving another piece of the puzzle of motivation.

Motivating operations are factors that affect learned behavior in a certain context. MOs have two effects: a '''value-altering effect''', which increases or decreases the efficiency of a reinforcer, and a '''behavior-altering effect''', which modifies learned behavior that has previously been punished or reinforced by a particular stimulus.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

When a motivating operation causes an increase in the effectiveness of a reinforcer, or amplifies a learned behavior in some way (such as increasing frequency, intensity, duration or speed of the behavior), it functions as an '''establishing operation, EO'''. A common example of this would be food deprivation, which functions as an EO in relation to food: the food-deprived organism will perform behaviors previously related to the acquisition of food more intensely, frequently, longer, or faster in the presence of food, and those behaviors would be especially strongly reinforced.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For instance, a fast-food worker earning minimal wage, forced to work more than one job to make ends meet, would be highly motivated by a pay raise, because of the current deprivation of money (a conditioned establishing operation). The worker would work hard to try to achieve the raise, and getting the raise would function as an especially strong reinforcer of work behavior.

Conversely, a motivating operation that causes a decrease in the effectiveness of a reinforcer, or diminishes a learned behavior related to the reinforcer, functions as an '''abolishing operation, AO.''' Again using the example of food, satiation of food prior to the presentation of a food stimulus would produce a decrease on food-related behaviors, and diminish or completely abolish the reinforcing effect of acquiring and ingesting the food.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Consider the board of a large investment bank, concerned with a too small profit margin, deciding to give the CEO a new incentive package in order to motivate him to increase firm profits. If the CEO already has a lot of money, the incentive package might not be a very good way to motivate him, because he would be satiated on money. Getting even more money wouldn't be a strong reinforcer for profit-increasing behavior, and wouldn't elicit increased intensity, frequency or duration of profit-increasing behavior.

====Motivation and psychotherapy====
{{See also|Motivational interviewing}}
Motivation lies at the core of many behaviorist approaches to psychological treatment. A person with [[Autism spectrum|autism-spectrum]] disorder is seen as lacking motivation to perform socially relevant behaviors – social stimuli are not as reinforcing for people with autism compared to other people. [[Major depressive disorder|Depression]] is understood as a lack of reinforcement (especially positive reinforcement) leading to extinction of behavior in the depressed individual. A patient with [[specific phobia]] is not motivated to seek out the phobic stimulus because it acts as a punisher, and is over-motivated to avoid it (negative reinforcement). In accordance, therapies have been designed to address these problems, such as [[Early intensive behavior intervention|EIBI]] and [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|CBT]] for major depression and specific phobia.

===Socio-cultural theory===
Sociocultural theory (see [[Cultural-historical psychology]]) (also known as Social Motivation) emphasizes impact of activity and actions mediated through social interaction, and within social contexts. Sociocultural theory represents a shift from traditional theories of motivation, which view the individual's innate drives or mechanistic operand learning as primary determinants of motivation.  Critical elements to socio-cultural theory applied to motivation include, but are not limited to, the role of social interactions and the contributions from culturally-based knowledge and practice.&lt;ref name="Rueda and Moll 1994"/&gt;  Sociocultural theory extends the social aspects of [[Cognitive Evaluation Theory]], which espouses the important role of positive feedback from others during action,&lt;ref name="Ryan, R. M. 2000"/&gt; but requires the individual as the internal locus of causality.  Sociocultural theory predicts that motivation has an external locus of causality, and is socially distributed among the social group.&lt;ref name="Rueda and Moll 1994"/&gt; 

Motivation can develop through an individuals involvement within their cultural group. Personal motivation often comes from activities a person believes to be central to the everyday occurrences in their community. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rogoff|first=Barbara|date=2009|title=Side by Side: Learning by Observing and Pitching In|url=|journal=Journal of the Society for Psychological Anthropology|volume=|pages=102–138|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of socio-cultural theory would be social settings where people work together to solve collective problems. Although individuals will have internalized goals, they will also develop internalized goals of others, as well as new interests and goals collectively with those that they feel socially connected to.&lt;ref name="Sharing Motivation"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walton|first1=Gregory|last2=Cohen|first2=Geoffrey|date=2011|title=Sharing Motivation|journal=Social Motivation|pages=79–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oftentimes, it is believed that all cultural groups are motivated in the same way. However, motivation can come from different child-rearing practices and cultural behaviors that greatly vary between cultural groups. 

In some indigenous cultures, collaboration between children and adults in community and household tasks is seen as very important &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Growing Up in a Culture of Respect|last=Bolin|first=Inge|publisher=|year=January 2006|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A child from an indigenous community may spend a great deal of their time alongside family and community members doing different tasks and chores that benefit the community. After having seen the benefits of collaboration and work, and also having the opportunity to be included, the child will be intrinsically motivated to participate in similar tasks. In this example, because the adults in the community do not impose the tasks upon the children, the children therefore feel self-motivated and a desire to participate and learn through the task. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murray, Bowen, Segura, Verdugo|first=Marjorie, Sofia, Nicole, Marisol|date=2015|title=Apprehending Volition in Early Socialization: Raising "Little Persons" among Rural Mapuche Families|url=|journal=Ethos|volume=43|pages=376–401|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the community values that surround the child, their source of motivation may vary from a different community with different values. 

In more Westernized communities, where segregation between adults and children participating in work related task is a common practice. As a result of this, these adolescents demonstrate less internalized motivation to do things within their environment than their parents. However, when the motivation to participate in activities is a prominent belief within the family, the adolescents autonomy is significantly higher. This therefore demonstrating that when collaboration and non-segregative tasks are norms within a child's upbringing, their internal motivation to participate in community tasks increases. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gronhoj,Rhogersen|first=Alice, John|date=2017|title=Why young people do things for the environment: the role of parenting for adolescents motivation to engage in pro-environmental behavior|url=|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When given opportunities to work collaboratively with adults on shared tasks during childhood, children will therefore become more intrinsically motivated through adulthood. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Growing Up in a Culture of Respect|last=Bolin|first=Inge|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Austin, TX|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social motivation is tied to one's activity in a group. It cannot form from a single mind alone. For example, bowling alone is naught but the dull act of throwing a ball into pins, and so people are much less likely to smile during the activity alone, even upon getting a strike because their satisfaction or dissatisfaction does not need to be communicated, and so it is internalized. However, when with a group, people are more inclined to smile regardless of their results because it acts as a positive communication that is beneficial for pleasurable interaction and teamwork.&lt;ref name="Sharing Motivation"/&gt; Thus the act of bowling becomes a social activity as opposed to a dull action because it becomes an exercise in interaction, competition, team building, and sportsmanship. It is because of this phenomenon that studies have shown that people are more intrigued in performing mundane activities so long as there is company because it provides the opportunity to interact in one way or another, be it for bonding, amusement, collaboration, or alternative perspectives.&lt;ref name="Sharing Motivation"/&gt; Examples of activities that may one may not be motivated to do alone but could be done with others for social benefit are things such as throwing and catching a baseball with a friend, making funny faces with children, building a treehouse, and performing a debate.

===Push and pull===
'''Push''' motivations are those where people push themselves towards their goals or to achieve something, such as the desire for escape, rest and relaxation, prestige, health and fitness, adventure, and social interaction.&lt;ref name="Testing the push and pull factors"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Testing the push and pull factors | doi=10.1016/0160-7383(94)90091-4 | volume=21|issue=4 |journal=Annals of Tourism Research|pages=844–846|year=1994 | last1 = Uysal | first1 = Muzaffer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, with push motivation it's also easy to get discouraged when there are obstacles present in the path of achievement. Push motivation acts as a willpower and people's willpower is only as strong as the desire behind the willpower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Push and Pull Motivation|url=http://toinspirewithin.com/2012/01/16/push-and-pull-motivation/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, a study has been conducted on social networking and its push and pull effects. One thing that is mentioned is "Regret and dissatisfaction correspond to push factors because regret and dissatisfaction are the negative factors that compel users to leave their current service provider."&lt;ref name="Chang, I. 2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chang | first1 = I. | last2 = Liu | first2 = C. | last3 = Chen | first3 = K. | year = 2014 | title = The push, pull and mooring effects in virtual migration for social networking sites | url = | journal = Information Systems Journal | volume = 24 | issue = 4| pages = 323–346 | doi = 10.1111/isj.12030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So from reading this, we now know that Push motivations can also be a negative force. In this case, that negative force is regret and dissatisfaction.

'''Pull''' motivation is the opposite of push. It is a type of motivation that is much stronger. "Some of the factors are those that emerge as a result of the attractiveness of a destination as it is perceived by those with the propensity to travel. They include both tangible resources, such as beaches, recreation facilities, and cultural attractions, and traveler's perceptions and expectation, such as novelty, benefit expectation, and marketing image."&lt;ref name="Testing the push and pull factors"/&gt; Pull motivation can be seen as the desire to achieve a goal so badly that it seems that the goal is pulling us toward it. That is why pull motivation is stronger than push motivation. It is easier to be drawn to something rather than to push yourself for something you desire. 
It can also be an alternative force when compared to negative force. From the same study as previously mentioned, "Regret and dissatisfaction with an existing SNS service provider may trigger a heightened interest toward switching service providers, but such a motive will likely translate into reality in the presence of a good alternative. Therefore, alternative attractiveness can moderate the effects of regret and dissatisfaction with switching intention"&lt;ref name="Chang, I. 2014"/&gt; And so, pull motivation can be an attracting desire when negative influences come into the picture.

===Self-control===
{{main article|Self-control|Inhibitory control}}
The self-control aspect of motivation is increasingly considered to be a subset of [[emotional intelligence]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kelly|first1=Theresa|title=Empathy: A Quantum Approach – The Psychical Influence of Emotion|date=February 6, 2012|isbn=9781105482885|page=101|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NwaVAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=The+self-control+aspect+of+motivation+is+increasingly+considered+to+be+a+subset+of+emotional+intelligence#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20self-control%20aspect%20of%20motivation%20is%20increasingly%20considered%20to%20be%20a%20subset%20of%20emotional%20intelligence&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is suggested that although a person may be classed as highly intelligent (as measured by many traditional [[intelligence test]]s), they may remain unmotivated to pursue intellectual endeavours. [[Victor Vroom|Vroom's]] "[[expectancy theory]]" provides an account of when people may decide to exert self-control in pursuit of a particular goal.

===Drives===
{{main article|Drive theory}}
A drive or desire can be described as a deficiency or need that activates behavior that is aimed at a goal or an incentive.&lt;ref name="Drive/Desire"&gt;{{cite web|title=Drive|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/drive?s=t|publisher=Dictionary.com|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These drives are thought to originate within the individual and may not require external stimuli to encourage the behavior. Basic drives could be sparked by deficiencies such as hunger, which motivates a person to seek food whereas more subtle drives might be the desire for praise and approval, which motivates a person to behave in a manner pleasing to others.

Another basic drive is the [[sexual drive]] which like food motivates us because it is essential to our survival.&lt;ref name="Schacter, D.L. 2009"&gt;Schacter, D.L., Gilbert, D.L. and Wegner, D.M. (2009,2011) Psychology. 2nd ed. New York: Worth.&lt;/ref&gt; The desire for sex is wired deep into the brain of all human beings as glands secrete hormones that travel through the blood to the brain and stimulates the onset of sexual desire.&lt;ref name="Schacter, D.L. 2009"/&gt; The hormone involved in the initial onset of sexual desire is called [[Dehydroepiandrosterone]] (DHEA).&lt;ref name="Schacter, D.L. 2009"/&gt; The hormonal basis of both men and women's sex drives is testosterone.&lt;ref name="Schacter, D.L. 2009"/&gt; Men naturally have more testosterone than women do and so are more likely than women to think about sex.&lt;ref name="Schacter, D.L. 2009"/&gt;

===Drive-reduction theory===
[[File:ClarkHull2.jpg|thumbnail|Clark Hull was the behaviorist who developed the drive-reduction theory of motivation.]]
[[Drive theory]] grows out of the concept that people have certain biological drives, such as hunger and thirst. As time passes the strength of the drive increases if it is not satisfied (in this case by eating). Upon satisfying a drive the drive's strength is reduced. Created by [[Clark Hull]]  and further developed by [[Kenneth Spence]], the theory became well known in the 1940s and 1950s. Many of the motivational theories that arose during the 1950s and 1960s were either based on Hull's original theory or were focused on providing alternatives to the drive-reduction theory, including Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs, which emerged as an alternative to Hull's approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://psychology.about.com/od/motivation/a/drive-reduction-theory.htm | title=How Does Drive Reduction Theory Explain Human Motivation?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drive theory has some intuitive or folk validity. For instance when preparing food, the drive model appears to be compatible with sensations of rising hunger as the food is prepared, and, after the food has been consumed, a decrease in subjective hunger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kamlesh|first1=M. L.|title=Psychology in Physical Education and Sport|date=Jan 12, 2011|publisher=Pinnacle Technology|isbn=9781618202482|url=https://books.google.com/?id=up-Bc_E_w9UC&amp;pg=PT328&amp;lpg=PT328&amp;dq=Drive+theory+has+some+intuitive+or+folk+validity.+For+instance+when+preparing+food,+the+drive+model+appears+to+be+compatible+with+sensations+of+rising+hunger+as+the+food+is+prepared,+and,+after+the+food+has+been+consumed,+a+decrease+in+subjective+hunger#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several problems, however, that leave the validity of drive reduction open for debate.

===Cognitive dissonance theory===
{{Main article|Cognitive dissonance}}
Suggested by [[Leon Festinger]], cognitive dissonance occurs when an individual experiences some degree of discomfort resulting from an inconsistency between two cognitions: their views on the world around them, and their own personal feelings and actions.&lt;ref name=Rani/&gt; For example, a consumer may seek to reassure themselves regarding a purchase, feeling that another decision may have been preferable. Their feeling that another purchase would have been preferable is inconsistent with their action of purchasing the item. The difference between their feelings and beliefs causes dissonance, so they seek to reassure themselves.

While not a theory of motivation, per se, the theory of cognitive dissonance proposes that people have a [[drive theory|motivational drive]] to reduce dissonance. The [[cognitive miser]] perspective makes people want to justify things in a simple way in order to reduce the effort they put into cognition.  They do this by changing their attitudes, beliefs, or actions, rather than facing the inconsistencies, because dissonance is a mental strain. Dissonance is also reduced by justifying, blaming, and denying. It is one of the most influential and extensively studied theories in [[social psychology]].

===Content theories===
The content theory was one of the earliest theories of motivation. Content theories can also be referred to needs theories, because the theory focuses on the importance of what motivates people (needs). In other words, they try to identify what are the "needs" and how they relate to motivation to fulfill those needs. Another definition could be defined by Pritchard and Ashwood, is the process used to allocate energy to maximize the satisfaction of needs.&lt;ref name=Pritchard2008&gt;{{cite book |last=R. Pritchard &amp; E. Ashwood |title=Managing Motivation |year=2008 |page=6 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group |location=New York |isbn=978-1-84169-789-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Maslow's hierarchy of needs====
[[File:Aspiration Management.jpg|thumb|Maslow's Pyramid]]
[[Content theory]] of human motivation includes both [[Abraham Maslow]]'s [[Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs|hierarchy of needs]] and [[Frederick Herzberg|Herzberg]]'s two-factor theory. Maslow's theory is one of the most widely discussed theories of motivation. Abraham Maslow believed that man is inherently good and argued that individuals possess a constantly growing inner drive that has great potential. The needs hierarchy system, devised by Maslow (1954), is a commonly used scheme for classifying human motives.&lt;ref&gt;Pardee, R. L. (1990). The basic concept behind the hierarchy system is that it's like a food pyramid. Everybody starts at the bottom of the pyramid and are motivated to satisfy each level in the ascending order to work our way to the top of the pyramid, and those levels (needs) are categorized into two main groups with five difference sections which are explained below. Motivation Theories of Maslow, Herzberg, McGregor &amp; McClelland. A Literature Review of Selected Theories Dealing with Job Satisfaction and Motivation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The American motivation psychologist Abraham H. Maslow developed the hierarchy of needs consisting of five hierarchic classes. According to Maslow, people are motivated by unsatisfied needs. 
The needs, listed from basic (lowest-earliest) to most complex (highest-latest) are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Content Theories of Motivation|url=https://sielearning.tafensw.edu.au/MBA/9791F/BusinessServices/LO/1207_020138_605F_02_wi/1207_020138_605F_0204_wi.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Physiology]] ([[hunger]], [[thirst]], [[sleep]], etc.)
* [[Safety]]/[[Security]]/[[Shelter (building)|Shelter]]/[[Health]]
* [[Social]]/[[Love]]/[[Friendship]]
* [[Self-esteem]]/[[Recognition (sociology)|Recognition]]/Achievement
* [[Self actualization]]/achievement of full [[potential]]
The basic requirements build upon the first step in the pyramid: physiology. If there are deficits on this level, all behavior will be oriented to satisfy this deficit. Essentially, if you have not slept or eaten adequately, you won't be interested in your self-esteem desires. Subsequently, we have the second level, which awakens a need for security. After securing those two levels, the motives shift to the social sphere, the third level. Psychological requirements comprise the fourth level, while the top of the hierarchy consists of self-realization and self-actualization.

Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory can be summarized as follows:
* Human beings have wants and desires which influence their behavior. Only unsatisfied needs influence behavior, satisfied needs do not.
* Needs are arranged in order of importance to human life, from the basic to the complex.
* The person advances to the next level of needs only after the lower level need is at least minimally satisfied.
* The further the progress up the hierarchy, the more individuality, humanness and psychological health a person will show.

====Sex, Hedonism, and Evolution====
        
One of the first influential figures to discuss the topic of Hedonism was Socrates, and he did so around 470- 399 BC in ancient Greece. Hedonism, as Socrates described it, is the motivation wherein a person will behave in a manner that will maximize pleasure and minimize pain. The only instance in which a person will behave in a manner that results in more pain than pleasure is when the knowledge of the effects of the behavior is lacking. Sex is one of the pleasures people pursue.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Deckers |first1=Lambert |title=Motivation Biological, Psychological, and Environmental |date=2018 |publisher=Routledge |location=711 Third Avenue, New York, NY 10017 |isbn=9781138036321 |page=30–38, 71–75 |edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Chandler, H. (1975). Hedonism. American Philosophical Quarterly, 12(3), 223-233. Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org/stable/20009578&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Sex is on the first level of Maslow's Hierarchy of needs. It is a necessary physiological need, like air, warmth, or sleep, and if the body lacks it will not function optimally. Without the orgasm that comes with sex, a person will experience “pain,” and as Hedonism would predict, a person will minimize this pain by pursuing sex. That being said, sex as a basic need is different from the need for sexual intimacy, which is located on the third level in Maslow's Hierarchy.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 
	
There are multiple theories for why sex is a strong motivation, and many fall under the Theory of Evolution. On an evolutionary level, the motivation for sex likely has to do with a species’ ability to reproduce. Species that reproduce more, survive and pass on their genes. Therefore, species have sexual desire that leads to sexual intercourse as a means to create more offspring. Without this innate motivation, a species may determine that attaining intercourse is too costly in terms of effort, energy, and danger.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Murray, S. (2018). Heterosexual Men’s Sexual Desire: Supported by, or Deviating from, Traditional Masculinity Norms and Sexual Scripts? Sex Roles, 78(1), 130-141.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
In addition to sexual desire, the motivation for romantic love runs parallel in having an evolutionary function for the survival of a species. On an emotional level, romantic love satiates a psychological need for belonging. Therefore, this is another hedonistic pursuit of pleasure. From the evolutionary perspective, romantic love creates bonds with the parents of offspring. This bond will make it so that the parents will stay together and take care and protect the offspring until it is independent. By rearing the child together, it increases the chances that the offspring will survive and pass on its genes itself, therefore continuing the survival of the species. Without the romantic love bond, the male will pursue satiation of his sexual desire with as many mates as possible, leaving behind the female to rear the offspring by herself. Child rearing with one parent is more difficult and provides less assurance that the offspring survives than with two parents. Romantic love therefore solves the commitment problem of parents needing to be together; individuals that are loyal and faithful to on another will have mutual survival benefits.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gonzaga, G., Turner, R., Keltner, D., Campos, B., Altemus, M., Davidson, Richard J., &amp;Scherer, Klaus R. (2006). Romantic Love and Sexual Desire in Close Relationships. Emotion, 6(2), 163-179.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gonzaga, G. C., Keltner, D. A., Londahl, E. D., &amp; Smith, M. (2001). Love and the commitment problem in romantic relations and friendship. Journal of Personality and Social	Psychology, 81(2), 247-262.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Additionally, under the umbrella of evolution, is Darwin's term sexual selection. This refers to how the female selects the male for reproduction. The male is motivated to attain sex because of all the aforementioned reasons, but how he attains it can vary based on his qualities. For some females, they are motivated by the will to survive mostly, and will prefer a mate that can physically defend her, or financially provide for her (among humans). Some females are more attracted to charm, as it is an indicator of being a good loyal lover that will in turn make for a dependable child rearing partner. Altogether, sex is a hedonistic pleasure seeking behavior that satiates physical and psychological needs and is instinctively guided by principles of evolution. &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hosken, David J. ; House, Clarissa M. Sexual Selection. Current Biology. Volume 21, Issue 2,	Pages R62-R65&lt;/ref&gt;



====Herzberg's two-factor theory====
{{Main article|Two-factor theory}}
[[File:Two factor theory.png|thumb|Two-factor theory]]
[[Frederick Herzberg]]'s two-factor theory concludes that certain factors in the workplace result in [[job satisfaction]], but if absent, they don't lead to dissatisfaction but no satisfaction. The factors that motivate people can change over their lifetime, but "respect for me as a person" is one of the top motivating factors at any stage of life.

He distinguished between:
* '''Motivators''' (e.g. challenging work, recognition, responsibility) which give positive satisfaction, and
* '''Hygiene factors''' (e.g. status, [[job security]], [[salary]] and fringe benefits) that do not motivate if present, but, if absent, result in demotivation.

Herzberg concluded that job satisfaction and dissatisfaction were the products of two separate factors: motivating factors (satisfiers) and hygiene factors (dissatisfiers).

Some motivating factors (satisfiers) were: Achievement, recognition, work itself, responsibility, advancement, and growth.

Some hygiene factors (dissatisfiers) were: company policy, supervision, working conditions, interpersonal relations, salary, status, job security, and personal life.&lt;ref name="Pardee, R. L. 1990"&gt;Pardee, R. L. (1990). Motivation Theories of Maslow, Herzberg, McGregor &amp; McClelland. A Literature Review of Selected Theories Dealing with Job Satisfaction and Motivation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name hygiene factors is used because, like hygiene, the presence will not improve health, but absence can cause health deterioration.

Herzberg's theory has found application in such occupational fields as information systems and in studies of user satisfaction such as [[computer user satisfaction]].

====Alderfer's ERG theory====
{{Main article|ERG theory}}
[[Clayton Alderfer|Alderfer]], expanding on Maslow's hierarchy of needs, created the ''ERG theory''. This theory posits that there are three groups of core needs — existence, relatedness, and growth, hence the label: ERG theory. The existence group is concerned with providing our basic material existence requirements. They include the items that Maslow considered to be physiological and safety needs. The second group of needs are those of relatedness- the desire we have for maintaining important personal relationships. These social and status desires require interaction with others if they are to be satisfied, and they align with Maslow's social need and the external component of Maslow's esteem classification. Finally, Alderfer isolates growth needs as an intrinsic desire for personal development. Maslow's categories are broken down into many different parts and there are a lot of needs. The ERG categories are more broad and covers more than just certain areas. As a person grows, the existence, relatedness, and growth for all desires continue to grow. All these needs should be fulfilled to greater wholeness as a human being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 2392201|title = Three Studies of Measures of Need Satisfaction in Organizations|journal = Administrative Science Quarterly|volume = 18|issue = 4|pages = 489–505|last1 = Schneider|first1 = Benjamin|last2 = Alderfer|first2 = Clayton P.|year = 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include the intrinsic component from Maslow's esteem category and the characteristics included under self-actualization.

====Self-determination theory====
{{Main article|Self-determination theory}}
Since the early 1970s Edward L. Deci and Richard M. Ryan&lt;ref&gt;http://www.selfdeterminationtheory.org/SDT/documents/1971_Deci.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; have conducted research that eventually led to the proposition of the self-determination theory (SDT). This theory focuses on the degree to which an individual's behaviour is self-motivated and self-determined. SDT identifies three innate needs that, if satisfied, allow optimal function and growth: competence,&lt;ref name="Harter, S. 1978"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harter | first1 = S | year = 1978 | title = Effectance motivation reconsidered: Toward a developmental model | url = | journal = Human Development | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 661–669 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="White, R. W. 1963"&gt;White, R. W. (1963). ''Ego and reality in psychoanalytic theory''. New York: International Universities Press.&lt;/ref&gt; relatedness,&lt;ref name="Baumeister, R. 1995"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R. | last2 = Leary | first2 = M. R. | year = 1995 | title = The need to belong: Desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 117 | issue = 3| pages = 497–529 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.117.3.497 | pmid=7777651}}&lt;/ref&gt; and autonomy.&lt;ref name="deCharms, R. 1968"&gt;deCharms, R.

These three psychological needs motivate the self to initiate specific behaviour and mental nutriments that are essential for psychological health and well-being.  When these needs are satisfied, there are positive consequences, such as well-being and growth, leading people to be motivated, productive and happy. When they are thwarted, people's motivation, productivity and happiness plummet.&lt;ref&gt;http://sdtheory.s3.amazonaws.com/SDT/documents/2000_DeciRyan_PIWhatWhy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three essential elements to the theory:&lt;ref name="Deci, E. L. 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deci | first1 = E. L. | last2 = Vansteenkiste | first2 = M. | year = 2004 | title = Self-determination theory and basic need satisfaction: Understanding human development in positive psychology | url = | journal = Ricerche di Psichologia | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 17–34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Humans are inherently proactive with their potential and mastering their inner forces (such as drive and emotions).
* Humans have an inherent tendency towards growth, development and integrated functioning.
* Optimal development and actions are inherent in humans but they do not happen automatically.

===Temporal motivation theory===
{{Main article|Temporal motivation theory}}
A recent approach in developing a broad, integrative theory of motivation is temporal motivation theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webapps2.ucalgary.ca/~steel/images/Integrating.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027140206/http://webapps2.ucalgary.ca/~steel/images/Integrating.pdf |archivedate=2014-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Introduced in a 2006 ''Academy of Management Review'' article,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steel|first=Piers|author2=C. König|title=Integrating theories of motivation|journal=Academy of Management Review|year=2006|volume=31|issue=4|pages=889–913|url=http://managementdemand.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Integrating-Motivation.pdf|doi=10.5465/AMR.2006.22527462|citeseerx=10.1.1.196.3227}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; it synthesizes into a single formulation the primary aspects of several other major motivational theories, including Incentive Theory, Drive Theory, Need Theory, Self-Efficacy and Goal Setting. It simplifies the field of motivation and allows findings from one theory to be translated into terms of another. Another journal article that helped to develop the [[Temporal motivation theory|Temporal Motivation Theory]], "The Nature of Procrastination,&lt;ref name=Steel2007&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.133.1.65 |url=http://studiemetro.au.dk/fileadmin/www.studiemetro.au.dk/Procrastination_2.pdf |title=The nature of procrastination: A meta-analytic and theoretical review of quintessential self-regulatory failure |year=2007 |last1=Steel |first1=Piers |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=133 |pages=65–94 |pmid=17201571 |issue=1|citeseerx=10.1.1.335.2796 }}&lt;/ref&gt; " received American Psychological Association's [[George Armitage Miller|George A. Miller]] award for outstanding contribution to general science.

::&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Motivation} = \frac{\mbox{Expectancy × Value}}{\mbox{1 + Impulsiveness × Delay}}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''Motivation''' is the desire for a particular outcome, '''Expectancy''' or [[self-efficacy]] is the probability of success, '''Value''' is the reward associated with the outcome, '''Impulsiveness''' is the individual's sensitivity to delay and '''Delay''' is the time to realization.&lt;ref name=Steel2007 /&gt;

===Achievement motivation===
Achievement motivation is an integrative perspective based on the premise that performance motivation results from the way broad components of personality are directed towards performance. As a result, it includes a range of dimensions that are relevant to success at work but which are not conventionally regarded as being part of performance motivation. The emphasis on performance seeks to integrate formerly separate approaches as [[need for achievement]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Atkinson|first=John|title=A Theory of Achievement Motivation|year=1974|publisher=Krieger Pub Co|isbn=978-0-88275-166-5|edition=6|author2=Norman Feather}}&lt;/ref&gt;  with, for example, social motives like dominance. Personality is intimately tied to performance and achievement motivation, including such characteristics as tolerance for risk, fear of failure, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Atkinson|first=John|title=Achievement Motive and Text Anxiety Conceived as Motive to Approach Success and Motive to Avoid Failure|year=1960|publisher=Bobbs-Merrill Company|author2=George H. Litwin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Atkinson|first=John|title=Personality, Motivation and Achievement|year=1978|publisher=Hemisphere Pub. Corp|isbn=978-0-470-99336-1|author2=Joel O. Raynor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikiversity:Motivation and emotion/Book/2011/Achievement motivation]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Achievement motivation can be measured by The Achievement Motivation Inventory, which is based on this theory and assesses three factors (in 17 separated scales) relevant to vocational and professional success. This motivation has repeatedly been linked with adaptive motivational patterns, including working hard, a willingness to pick learning tasks with much difficulty, and attributing success to effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Xiang | first1 = P. | last2 = McBride | first2 = R. | last3 = Guan | first3 = J. | year = 2004 | title = Children's motivation in elementary physical education: A longitudinal study | url = | journal = Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport | volume = 75 | issue = 1| pages = 71–80 | doi=10.1080/02701367.2004.10609135| pmid = 15532363 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Achievement motivation was studied intensively by [[David C. McClelland]], [[John William Atkinson|John W. Atkinson]] and their colleagues since the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McClelland|first=David|title=The Achievement Motive|year=1953|publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of motivation is a drive that is developed from an emotional state. One may feel the drive to achieve by striving for success and avoiding failure. In achievement motivation, one would hope that they excel in what they do and not think much about the failures or the negatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Covington | first1 = M. V. | year = 2000 | title = Goal theory, motivation, and school achievement: An integrative review | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 51 | issue = 1| pages = 171–200 | doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.51.1.171 | pmid=10751969}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their research showed that business managers who were successful demonstrated a high need to achieve no matter the culture.  There are three major characteristics of people who have a great need to achieve according to McClelland's research.
#They would prefer a work environment in which they are able to assume responsibility for solving problems.
#They would take calculated risk and establish moderate, attainable goals.
#They want to hear continuous recognition, as well as feedback, in order for them to know how well they are doing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schultz &amp; Schultz|first=Duane|title=Psychology and work today|year=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New York|isbn=978-81-317-3370-7|pages=121–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive theories===
[[Cognitive]] theories define motivation in terms of how people think about situations. Cognitive theories of motivation include goal-setting theory and expectancy theory.

====Goal-setting theory====
{{Main article|Goal-setting theory}}
Goal-setting theory is based on the notion that individuals sometimes have a drive to reach a clearly defined end state. Often, this end state is a [[reward system|reward]] in itself. A goal's efficiency is affected by three features: proximity, difficulty and specificity. One common goal setting methodology incorporates the [[SMART criteria]], in which goals are: specific, measurable, attainable/achievable, relevant, and time-bound. Time management is an important aspect to consider, when regarding time as a factor contributing to goal achievement. Having too much time allows area for distraction and procrastination, which simultaneously distracts the subject by steering his or her attention away from the original goal. An ideal goal should present a situation where the time between the initiation of behavior and the end state is close.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning Strategies and Learning Styles|last=Entwistle|first=Noel|date=1988|publisher=Springer, Boston, MA|isbn=9781489921208|series=Perspectives on Individual Differences|pages=21–51|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-2118-5_2|chapter = Motivational Factors in Students' Approaches to Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; With an overly restricting time restraint, the subject could potentially feel overwhelmed, which could deter the subject from achieving the goal because the amount of time provided is not sufficient or rational.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fried|first=Yitzhak|last2=Slowik|first2=Linda Haynes|date=2004|title=Enriching Goal-Setting Theory with Time: An Integrated Approach|journal=The Academy of Management Review|volume=29|issue=3|pages=404–422|doi=10.2307/20159051|jstor=20159051}}&lt;/ref&gt; This explains why some children are more motivated to learn how to ride a bike than to master [[algebra]]. A goal should be moderate, not too hard or too easy to complete.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Most people are not optimally motivated, as many want a challenge (which assumes some kind of insecurity of success). At the same time people want to feel that there is a substantial [[probability]] that they will succeed. Specificity concerns the description of the goal in their class. The goal should be objectively defined and intelligible for the individual.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Similarly to [[Maslow]]'s Hierarchy of Needs, a larger end goal is easier to achieve if the subject has smaller, more attainable yet still challenging goals to achieve first in order to advance over a period of time.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A classic example of a poorly specified goal is trying to motivate oneself to run a [[marathon]] when s/he has not had proper training. A smaller, more attainable goal is to first motivate oneself to take the stairs instead of an elevator or to replace a stagnant activity, like watching television, with a mobile one, like spending time walking and eventually working up to a jog. '''Note: all goals are subject to the individual's skills and abilities.'''

=== '''Procrastination'''- ===
to voluntarily postpone or delay an intended course of action despite anticipating that you will be worse off because of that delay. &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Procrastination can be seen as a defense mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hub.rockyview.ab.ca/mod/book/view.php?id=260&amp;chapterid=324|title=Defense Mechanisms: Procrastination|website=hub.rockyview.ab.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; When something is put off or will be done at a later time it can be seen as one is protecting one's self from failure. It is creating an excuse for why one didn’t do well on something Take for example a term paper, it is overwhelming, and one is not sure that it can be completed correctly. If one puts it off until the last minute, then one can say that they did not do a good job on it because they didn’t have enough time. Procrastination can be seen as creating a buffer or an excuse to cover up inadequacies. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-procrastination-equation/201207/lying-and-procrastination|title=Lying and Procrastination|website=Psychology Today|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Expectancy theory====
{{Main article|Expectancy theory}}
Expectancy theory was proposed by Victor H. Vroom in 1964. Expectancy theory explains the behavior process in which an individual selects a behavior option over another, and why/how this decision is made in relation to their goal.

There's also an equation for this theory which goes as follows: 
::&lt;math&gt;{\text{M}}= {\text{E}} \times {\text{I}} \times {\text{V}}&lt;/math&gt; or 
::&lt;math&gt;{\text{Motivation}}= {\text{Expectancy}} \times {\text{Instrumentality}} \times {\text{Valence}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="analytictech.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Theories of Motivation|url=http://www.analytictech.com/mb021/motivation.htm|website=analytictech.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*M (Motivation) is the amount an individual will be motivated by the condition or environment they placed themselves in. Which is based from the following hence the equation.
*E (Expectancy) is the person's perception that effort will result in performance. In other words, it's the person assessment of how well and what kind of effort will relate in better performance.
*I (Instrumentality) is the person's perception that performance will be rewarded or punished.
*V (Valence) is the perceived amount of the reward or punishment that will result from the performance."&lt;ref name="analytictech.com"/&gt;

===Models of behavior change===
{{See also|Cognitive control}}
Social-cognitive models of behavior change include the constructs of motivation and [[volition (psychology)|volition]]. Motivation is seen as a process that leads to the forming of behavioral [[intention]]s. Volition is seen as a process that leads from intention to actual behavior. In other words, motivation and volition refer to goal setting and goal pursuit, respectively. Both processes require self-regulatory efforts. Several self-regulatory constructs are needed to operate in [[orchestration]] to attain goals. An example of such a motivational and volitional construct is perceived [[self-efficacy]]. Self-efficacy is supposed to facilitate the forming of behavioral intentions, the development of action plans, and the initiation of action. It can support the translation of intentions into action.

[[John William Atkinson|John W. Atkinson]], David Birch and their colleagues developed the theory of "Dynamics of Action" to mathematically model change in behavior as a consequence of the interaction of motivation and associated tendencies toward specific actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Atkinson|first=John|title=The Dynamics of Action|year=1970|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-03624-1|author2=David Birch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuhl|first=Julius|title=Motivation, Thought, and Action|year=1986|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-0-275-92096-8|author2=John W. Atkinson}}&lt;/ref&gt;    The theory posits that change in behavior occurs when the tendency for a new, unexpressed behavior becomes dominant over the tendency currently motivating action.  In the theory, the strength of tendencies rises and falls as a consequence of internal and external stimuli (sources of instigation), inhibitory factors, and consummatory in factors such as performing an action. In this theory, there are three causes responsible for behavior and change in behavior:
# Instigation (Ts) – increases tendency when an activity has intrinsic ability to satisfy;
# Inhibition (Taf) – decreases tendency when there are obstacles to performing an activity; and
# Consummation – decreases a tendency as it is performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Atkinson|first=John|title=Introduction to Motivation|year=1978|publisher=D. Van Nostrand Company|location=New York|author2=David Birch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reeve|first=J|title=Understanding motivation and emotion|year=2009|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, NJ|edition=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thematic apperception test===
{{Main article|Thematic apperception test}}
Psychologists [[David C. McClelland]] and [[John William Atkinson|John W. Atkinson]] argued that motivation should be unconscious. They refined measures of motivation by means of [[content analysis]] of [[Imagination|imaginative thought]] using, for example, the Thematic Apperception Test.'&lt;ref name="Schacter, Daniel 2011. p.340"&gt;Schacter, Daniel. "Psychology". Worth Publishers. 2011. p.340&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Atkinson|first=John|title=Motives in Fantasy, Action, and Society: a method of assessment and study|year=1958|publisher=Van Nostrand|isbn=978-0-442-00367-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intrinsic motivation and the 16 basic desires theory===
Starting from studies involving more than 6,000 people, Professor [[Steven Reiss]] has proposed a theory that found 16 basic desires that guide nearly all human behavior.&lt;ref name="Reiss New Theory"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.osu.edu/news/2000/06/28/whoami/|title=New Theory of Motivation Lists 16 Basic Desires That Guide Us|last=|first=|date=2000-06-28|work=Research News|publisher=[[Ohio State]]|accessdate=2012-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Reiss | first1 = Steven | title = Who am I?

It is about reaching the most possible potential as a human being.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The 16 basic desires that motivate our actions and define our personalities are:

* [[Tranquility]], the need to be safe
* [[Vengeance (concept)|Vengeance]], the need to strike back and to compete
}}

===Attribution theory===
{{Main article|Attribution (psychology)}}
Attribution theory is a theory developed by psychologist, [[Fritz Heider]] that describes the processes by which individuals explain the causes of their behavior and events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kassin|first=Saul|title=Social Psychology|year=2007|publisher=Wadsworth: Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0618868469}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A form of attribution theory developed by psychologist, [[Bernard Weiner]] describes an individual's beliefs about how the causes of success or failure affect their emotions and motivations. Bernard Weiner's theory can be defined into two perspectives: intrapersonal or interpersonal.  The intrapersonal perspective includes self-directed thoughts and emotions that are attributed to the self. The interpersonal perspective includes beliefs about the responsibility of others and other directed affects of emotions; the individual would place the blame on another individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weiner|first=Bernard|title=Interpersonal and intrapersonal theories of motivation from an attributional perspective|journal=Educational Psychology Review|year=2000|volume=12|issue=1|pages=1–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals formulate explanatory attributions to understand the events they experience and to seek reasons for their failures. When individuals seek positive feedback from their failures, they use the feedback as motivation to show improved performances. For example, using the intrapersonal perspective, a student who failed a test may attribute their failure for not studying enough and would use their emotion of shame or embarrassment as motivation to study harder for the next test. A student who blames their test failure on the teacher would be using the interpersonal perspective, and would use their feeling of disappointment as motivation to rely on a different study source other than the teacher for the next test.

===Approach versus avoidance===
{{Main article|Motivational salience}}
Approach motivation (i.e., [[incentive salience]]) can be defined as when a certain behavior or reaction to a situation/environment is [[reward system|rewarded]] or results in a positive or desirable outcome. In contrast, avoidance motivation (i.e., [[aversive salience]]) can be defined as when a certain behavior or reaction to a situation/environment is punished or results in a [[aversives|negative or undesirable outcome]].&lt;ref name="Schacter, Daniel 2011. p.340"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elliot|first1=Andrew J|last2=Covington|first2=Martin V|title=Approach and Avoidance Motivation|journal=Educational Psychology Review|date=2001|volume=13|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that, all else being equal, avoidance motivations tend to be more powerful than approach motivations. Because people expect losses to have more powerful emotional consequences than equal-size gains, they will take more risks to avoid a loss than to achieve a gain.&lt;ref name="Schacter, Daniel 2011. p.340"/&gt;

'''&lt;big&gt;Conditioned taste aversion.&lt;/big&gt;'''

“A strong dislike (nausea reaction) for food because of prior Association with of that food with nausea or upset stomach.” &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Conditioned taste aversion is the only type of conditioning that only needs one exposure. It does not need to be the specific food or drinks that cause the taste. Conditioned taste aversion can also be attributed to extenuating circumstances. An example of this can be eating a rotten apple. Eating the apple then immediately throwing up. Now it is hard to even near an apple without feeling sick. Conditioned taste aversion can also come about by the mere associations of two stimuli. Eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, but also have the flu. Eating the sandwich makes one feel nauseous, so one throws up, now one cannot smell peanut butter without feeling queasy. Though eating the sandwich does not cause one to through up, they are still linked.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Unconscious Motivation ===
In his book ''A General Introduction to Psychoanalysis'', Sigmund Freud explained his theory on the conscious-unconscious distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A General Introduction to Psychoanalysis|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|publisher=Renaissance Classics|year=2012|isbn=9781484156803|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To explain this relationship, he used a two-room metaphor. The smaller of the two rooms is filled with a person's preconscious, which is the thoughts, emotions, and memories that are available to a person's consciousness. This room also houses a person's consciousness, which is the part of the preconscious that is the focus at that given time. Connected to the small room is a much larger room that houses a person's unconscious. This part of the mind is unavailable to a person's consciousness and consists of impulses and repressed thoughts. The door between these two rooms acts as the person's mental censor. It's job is to keep anxiety inducing thoughts and socially unacceptable behaviors or desires out of the preconscious. Freud describes the event of a thought or impulse being denied at the door as repression, one of the many defense mechanisms. This process is supposed to protect the individual from any embarrassment that could come from acting on these impulses or thoughts that exist in the unconscious.

In terms of motivation, Freud argues that unconscious instinctual impulses can still have great influence on behavior even though the person is not aware of the source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Motivation: Biological, Psychological, and Environmental|last=Deckers|first=Lambert|publisher=Routledge|year=2018|isbn=9781138036338|location=|pages=39–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; When these instincts serve as a motive, the person is only aware of the goal of the motive, and not its actual source. He divides these instincts into sexual instincts, death instincts, and ego or self-preservation instincts. Sexual instincts are those that motivate humans to stay alive and ensure the continuation of the mankind. On the other hand, Freud also maintains that humans have an inherent drive for self-destruction, or the death instinct. Similar to the devil and angel that everyone has on there should, the sexual instinct and death instinct are constantly battling each other to both be satisfied. The death instinct can be closely related to Freud's other concept, the id, which is our need to experience pleasure immediately, regardless of the consequences. The last type of instinct that contributes to motivation is the ego or self-preservation instinct. This instinct is geared towards assuring that a person feels validated in whatever behavior or thought they have. The mental censor, or door between the unconscious and preconscious, helps satisfy this instinct. For example, one may be sexually attracted to a person, due to their sexual instinct, but the self-preservation instinct prevents them to act on this urge until that person finds that it is socially acceptable to do so. Quite similarly to his psychic theory that deals with the id, ego, and superego, Freud's theory of instincts highlights the interdependence of these three instincts. All three instincts serve as a checks and balances system to control what instincts are acted on and what behaviors are used to satisfy as many of them at once.

'''Priming in the context of Motivation'''

Priming is a phenomenon, often used as an experimental technique, whereby a specific stimulus sensitizes the subject to later presentation of a similar stimulus. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://psychcentral.com/encyclopedia/priming/|title=Priming {{!}} Encyclopedia of Psychology|date=2016-06-17|work=Encyclopedia of Psychology|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“Priming refers to an increased sensitivity to certain stimuli, resulting from prior exposure to related visual or audio messages. When an individual is exposed to the word “cancer,” for example, and then offered the choice to smoke a cigarette, we expect that there is a greater probability that they will choose not to smoke as a result of the earlier exposure.”&lt;ref name="AutoRef1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Elgendi |first=Mohamed |last2=Kumar |first2=Parmod |last3=Barbic |first3=Skye |last4=Howard |first4=Newton |last5=Abbott |first5=Derek |last6=Cichocki |first6=Andrzej |date=2018-05-30 |title=Subliminal Priming—State of the Art and Future Perspectives |journal=Behavioral Sciences |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=54 |doi=10.3390/bs8060054 |pmid=29849006 |pmc=6027235 |issn=2076-328X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Priming can affect motivation, in the way that we can be motived to do things by an outside source. 

Priming can be linked with the mere exposer theory. People tend to like thing that they have exposed to before. Mere exposer theory is used by advertising companies to get people to buy their products. An example of this is seeing a picture of the product on a sign and then buying that product later. If an individual is in a room with two strangers they are more likely to gravitate towards the person that they occasionally pass on the street, then the person that they have never seen before. An example of the use of mere exposure theory can be seen in product placements in movies and TV shows. We see a product that our is in our favorite movie, and we are more inclined to buy that product when we see it again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://psychcentral.com/encyclopedia/mere-exposure-effect/|title=Mere Exposure Effect {{!}} Encyclopedia of Psychology|date=2016-06-17|work=Encyclopedia of Psychology|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Priming can fit into these categories; Semantic Priming, Visual Priming, Response Priming, Perceptual and Conceptual Priming, Positive and Negative Priming, Associative and Context Priming, and Olfactory Priming. Visual and Semantic priming is the most used in motivation. Most priming is linked with emotion, the stronger the emotion, the stronger the connection between memory and the stimuli.&lt;ref name="AutoRef1" /&gt;

Priming also has an effect on drug users. In this case, it can be defined at, the reinstatement or increase in drug craving by a small dose of the drug or by stimuli associated with the drug. If a former drug user is in a place where they formerly did drugs, then they are tempted to do that same thing again even if they have been clean for years.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==Practical applications==
The control of motivation is only understood to a limited extent. There are many different approaches of ''motivation training'', but many of these are considered [[pseudoscientific]] by critics. To understand how to control motivation it is first necessary to understand why many people lack motivation.

===Implementations of natural theories===
Natural theories of motivation such as Theory Y argue that individuals are naturally willing to work and prefer jobs with high responsibility, creativity and ingenuity.&lt;ref name="Lecture 10/1"/&gt; Holistically, the implementation in the workplace based on natural theories of motivation requires creating a comfortable and open work environment because it is through this climate that the individuals’ goals are most likely to be aligned with the organization's goals.
Based on the assumptions of natural theorists, individuals are motivated to work for an organization when they feel fulfillment from the work and organization. Therefore, hiring should focus on matching the goals of the individual with the goals of the organization rather than solely on the candidate's proficiency at completing a task, as rational theorists would argue. Logistically, there are several ways that firms can implement the assumptions of natural theories of motivation, including delegation of responsibilities, participation in management by employees, job enlargement, and membership within the firm.

====Delegation of responsibilities====
McGregor's Theory Y makes the assumption that the average person not only accepts, but also seeks out responsibility.&lt;ref name="McGregor"/&gt; Thus, as a firm gives individuals’ greater responsibilities, they will feel a greater sense of satisfaction and, subsequently, more commitment to the organization. Additionally, Malone argues that the delegation of responsibility encourages motivation because employees have creative control over their work and increases productivity as many people can work collaboratively to solve a problem rather than just one manager tackling it alone.&lt;ref name=Malone&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malone|first=Thomas|title=Is 'Empowerment' Just a Fad? Control, Decision-Making, and Information Technology|journal=Sloan Management Review|year=1997|volume=23|issue=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Participative management====
Participative management styles involve consulting employees through the decision making process. Markowitz argues that this boosts employees’ morale and commitment to the organization, subsequently increasing productivity.&lt;ref name=Markowitz&gt;{{cite journal|last=Markowitz|first=Linda|title=Employee Participation at the Workplace: Capitalist Control or Worker Freedom?|journal=Critical Sociology|year=1996|volume=22|issue=2|pages=89–103|doi=10.1177/089692059602200205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Denison provides empirical evidence demonstrating that employee participation is correlated with better organizational performance.&lt;ref name=Denison&gt;{{cite book|last=Denison|first=Daniel R.|title=Corporate Culture and Organizational Effectiveness|year=1990|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that this stands in contract to Graham's rationalist view that kaizen, a participative management style used in Japan, does not engage employees’ minds in the decision making process.&lt;ref name=Graham&gt;{{cite journal|last=Graham|first=Laura|title=Inside a Japanese Transplant: A Critical Perspective|journal=Work and Occupations|date=1 May 1993|volume=20|issue=2|pages=147–173|doi=10.1177/0730888493020002002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graham, however, only examines one specific and flawed participative management style that only allows limited input from employees.&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt; With a properly implemented process that actively engages employees, participative management will create a welcoming and productive environment.

====Job enlargement====
Job enlargement refers to increasing the responsibilities of a job by adding to the scope of the tasks. This provides more variety and prevents a job from getting boring. Additionally, this prevents the problem of alienation brought on by the rational theorists of Fordism.&lt;ref name="Lecture 10/1"/&gt; In assembly lines, the employee feels disconnected from the final product because he or she only performs one task repeatedly. Job enlargement instead keeps employees engaged in the organization and creates a more welcoming environment. It stems on the assumption that employees enjoy doing work and, therefore, are more satisfied when they have a wider range of work to do.

====Firm membership====
As Mayo details, based on observations of the Hawthorn Western Electric Company, an additional facet of motivation stems from creating a culture of teams and membership within the firm.&lt;ref name="Mayo"/&gt; For employees, a large part of job satisfaction is feeling as though one is a member of a larger team. For example, Mayo writes about a young girl worker who refused a transfer to a higher paid position in order to stay with a group that she felt a connection to.&lt;ref name="Mayo"/&gt; This example demonstrates that workers are not necessarily rational and only working for higher monetary compensation; instead, the social aspects of a firm can provide incentives to work. It is important, therefore, to create an inclusive environment that welcomes each worker or employee as a member of that organization.

===Employee motivation===

The Job characteristics Model (JCM), as designed by Hackman&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://hackman.socialpsychology.org/ | title=Richard Hackman}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Oldham attempts to use job design to improve employee motivation.  They show that any job can be described in terms of five key job characteristics:&lt;ref&gt;J.R. Hackman and G.R. Oldham. Work Redesign. Upper Saddle River, N.J.: Pearson Education, Inc, 1980; pp 78-80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/08956308.2005.11657344|title = Motivating Technical Professionals Today| journal=Research-Technology Management| volume=48| issue=6| pages=19–27|year = 2015|last1 = Katz|first1 = Ralph}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Skill variety'' – the degree to which the job requires the use of different skills and talents
# ''Task identity'' – the degree to which the job has contributed to a clearly identifiable larger project
# ''Task significance'' – the degree to which the job affects the lives or work of other people
# ''Autonomy'' – the degree to which the worker has independence, freedom and discretion in carrying out the job
# ''Task feedback'' – the degree to which the worker is provided with clear, specific, detailed, ''[[Action item|actionable]]'' information about the effectiveness of his or her [[job performance]]

The JCM links the core job dimensions listed above to critical psychological states which results in desired personal and work outcomes.  This forms the basis of this 'employee growth-need strength." The core dimensions listed above can be combined into a single predictive index, called the ''[[motivating potential score]]''.

=====Motivating potential score=====
{{See also|Work motivation|Job satisfaction}}

The [[motivating potential score]] (MPS) can be calculated, using the core dimensions discussed above, as follows:

::&lt;math&gt;{\text{MPS}}=&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;{\text{Autonomy}} \, \times \, {\text{Feedback}} \, \times \frac{\text{Skill Variety+Task Identity+Task Significance } }{\text{3} }  &lt;/math&gt;

Jobs high in motivating potential must be high on both Autonomy and Feedback, and also must be high on at least one of the three factors that lead to experienced meaningfulness.&lt;ref name=Steel2012&gt;Steel, Piers.

====Employee recognition programs====
Employee recognition is not only about gifts and points. It's about changing the corporate culture in order to meet goals and initiatives and most importantly to connect employees to the company's core values and beliefs. Strategic employee recognition is seen as the most important program not only to improve employee retention and motivation but also to positively influence the financial situation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfo-insight.com/human-capital-career/talent-management/how-employee-recognition-programmes-improves-retention/ How Employee Recognition Programmes Improve Retention] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116050945/http://www.cfo-insight.com/human-capital-career/talent-management/how-employee-recognition-programmes-improves-retention/ |date=2013-01-16 }} ''CFO Insight Magazine'', January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between the traditional approach (gifts and points) and strategic recognition is the ability to serve as a serious business influencer that can advance a company's strategic objectives in a measurable way. "The vast majority of companies want to be innovative, coming up with new products, business models and better ways of doing things. However, innovation is not so easy to achieve. A CEO cannot just order it, and so it will be. You have to carefully manage an organization so that, over time, innovations will emerge."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/freekvermeulen/2011/05/30/five-mistaken-beliefs-business-leaders-have-about-innovation/ Five mistaken beliefs business leaders have about innovation] by Freek Vermeulen in ''Forbes'', May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education ===
Motivation is of particular interest to [[educational psychology|educational psychologists]] because of the crucial role it plays in student learning. However, the specific kind of motivation that is studied in the specialized setting of education differs qualitatively from the more general forms of motivation studied by psychologists in other fields.

Motivation in education can have several effects on how students learn and how they behave towards subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;Ormrod, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; It can:
# Direct behavior toward particular goals
# Lead to increased effort and energy
# Increase initiation of, and persistence in, activities
# Enhance cognitive processing
# Determine what consequences are reinforcing
# Lead to improved performance.

Because students are not always internally motivated, they sometimes need ''situated motivation'', which is found in environmental conditions that the teacher creates.

If teachers decided to extrinsically reward productive student behaviors, they may find it difficult to extricate themselves from that path. Consequently, student dependency on [[extrinsic reward]]s represents one of the greatest detractors from their use in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/08878730409555342|title = Classroom motivation strategies for prospective teachers| journal=The Teacher Educator| volume=39| issue=3| pages=212–230|year = 2004|last1 = Williams|first1 = Robert L.| last2=Stockdale| first2=Susan L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of new student orientation leaders at colleges and universities recognize that distinctive needs of students should be considered in regard to orientation information provided at the beginning of the higher education experience.  Research done by Whyte in 1986 raised the awareness of counselors and educators in this regard.  In 2007, the National Orientation Directors Association reprinted [[Cassandra B. Whyte]]'s research report allowing readers to ascertain improvements made in addressing specific needs of students over a quarter of a century later to help with academic success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whyte | first1 = Cassandra B | year = 2007 | title = An Additional Look at Orientation Programs Nationally- (reprint of 1986 article in same journal) | url = | journal = National Orientation Directors Association Journal | volume = 15 | issue = 1| pages = 71–77 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, motivation is conceptualized as either ''intrinsic'' or ''extrinsic''. Classically, these categories are regarded as distinct.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Today, these concepts are less likely to be used as distinct categories, but instead as two [[ideal type]]s that define a [[continuum (theory)|continuum]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1177/0013164492052004025|title = The Academic Motivation Scale: A Measure of Intrinsic, Extrinsic, and Amotivation in Education| journal=Educational and Psychological Measurement| volume=52| issue=4| pages=1003–1017|year = 2016|last1 = Vallerand|first1 = Robert J.| last2=Pelletier| first2=Luc G.| last3=Blais| first3=Marc R.| last4=Briere| first4=Nathalie M.| last5=Senecal| first5=Caroline| last6=Vallieres| first6=Evelyne F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# [[#Intrinsic motivation|Intrinsic motivation]] occurs when people are internally motivated to do something because it either brings them pleasure, they think it is important, or they feel that what they are learning is significant.  It has been shown that intrinsic motivation for education drops from grades 3-9 though the exact cause cannot be ascertained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.17.3.300|title = A new self-report scale of intrinsic versus extrinsic orientation in the classroom: Motivational and informational components| journal=Developmental Psychology| volume=17| issue=3| pages=300–312|year = 1981|last1 = Harter|first1 = Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, in younger students it has been shown that contextualizing material that would otherwise be presented in an abstract manner increases the intrinsic motivation of these students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1037/0022-0663.88.4.715|title = Intrinsic motivation and the process of learning: Beneficial effects of contextualization, personalization, and choice| journal=Journal of Educational Psychology| volume=88| issue=4| pages=715–730|year = 1996|last1 = Cordova|first1 = Diana I.| last2=Lepper| first2=Mark R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[#Extrinsic motivation|Extrinsic motivation]] comes into play when a student is compelled to do something or act a certain way because of factors external to him or her (like money or good grades).

Cassandra B. Whyte researched and reported about the importance of locus of control and academic achievement.  Students tending toward a more internal locus of control are more academically successful, thus encouraging curriculum and activity development with consideration of motivation theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/00256307.1978.12022132|title = Effective Counseling Methods for High-Risk College Freshmen| journal=Measurement and Evaluation in Guidance| volume=10| issue=4| pages=198–200|year = 2018|last1 = Whyte|first1 = Cassandra Bolyard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Lauridsen |editor-first=K. |editor2-last=Whyte |editor2-first=C.B. |year=1980 |title=An Integrated counseling and Learning Assistance Center. New Directions Sourcebook |publisher=Jossey-Bass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic motivation orientation may also be tied with one's ability to detect and process errors. Fisher, Nanayakkara, and Marshall conducted neuroscience research on children's motivation orientation, neurological indicators of error monitoring (the process of detecting an error), and academic achievement. Their research suggests that students with high intrinsic motivation attribute performance to personal control and that their error-monitoring system is more strongly engaged by performance errors. They also found that motivation orientation and academic achievement were related to the strength in which their error-monitoring system was engaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fisher | first1 = K. | last2 = Marshall | first2 = M. | last3 = Nanayakkara | first3 = A. | year = 2009 | title = Motivational orientation, error monitoring, and academic performance in middle childhood: A behavioral and electrophysiological investigation | url = | journal = Mind, Brain, and Education | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 56–63 | doi=10.1111/j.1751-228x.2008.01053.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Motivation has been found to be an important element in the concept of [[andragogy]] (what motivates the adult learner), and in treating Autism Spectrum Disorders, as in [[pivotal response treatment]]. 
Motivation has also been found critical in adolescents compliance to health suggestions, since "commitment requires belief in potentially negative and serious consequences of not acting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Adolescent Health Psychology |isbn=978-1-4614-6632-1 |page=376 |editor1=William T. O‘Donohue |editor2=Lorraine T. Benuto |editor3=Lauren Woodward Tolle |year=2013 |publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doyle and Moeyn have noted that traditional methods tended to use anxiety as negative motivation (e.g. use of bad grades by teachers) as a method of getting students to work. However, they have found that progressive approaches with focus on positive motivation over punishment has produced greater effectiveness with learning, since anxiety interferes with performance of complex tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 40195071|title = Measures of Academic Motivation: A Conceptual Review|journal = Research in Higher Education|volume = 8|issue = 1|pages = 1–23|last1 = Moen|first1 = Ross|last2 = Doyle|first2 = Kenneth O.|year = 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Symer et al. attempted to better define those in medical training programs who may have a ”surgical personality”.  They evaluated a group of eight hundred and one first-year surgical interns to compare motivational traits amongst those who did and did not complete surgical training.  There was no difference noted between the 80.5% who completed training when comparing their responses to the 19.5% who did not complete training using the validated Behavior Inhibitory System/Behavior Approach System.  They concluded based on this that resident physician motivation is not associated with completion of a surgical training program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2018.02.007| pmid=29510202|title = The Surgical Personality: Does Surgery Resident Motivation Predict Attrition?| journal=Journal of the American College of Surgeons| volume=226| issue=5| pages=777–783|year = 2018|last1 = Symer|first1 = Matthew M.| last2=Abelson| first2=Jonathan S.| last3=Yeo| first3=Heather L.| last4=Sosa| first4=Julie A.| last5=Rosenthal| first5=M. Zachary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact of teaching style on student intrinsic motivation===

It may appear that the reason some students are more engaged and perform better in class activities relative to other students is because some are more motivated than others. However, current research suggests that motivation is not concrete or quantifiable; it is “dynamic, context sensitive, and changeable.” &lt;ref name="AutoRef2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maclellan|title=Academic achievement:The role of praise in motivating students|journal=Active Learning in Higher Education|date=2005|doi=10.1177/146978740505775|doi-broken-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, students have the flexibility to, intrinsically, motivate themselves to engage in an activity or learn something new even if they were not intrinsically motivated in the first place &lt;ref name="AutoRef13"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sansone|last2=Morgan|title=Intrinsic motivation and education: Competence in context|journal=Motivation and Emotion|date=1992|volume=16|issue=3|pages=249–270|doi=10.1007/bf00991654}}&lt;/ref&gt; . While having this type of flexibility is important, research reveals that a teacher's teaching style and the school environment also play a factor in student motivation.&lt;ref name="AutoRef4"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Katz|last2=Shahar|title=What makes a motivating teacher? Teacher's motivation and beliefs as predictors of their autonomy-supportive style|journal=School Psychology International|date=2015|doi=10.1177/0143034315609969|volume=36|issue=6|pages=575–588}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRef2" /&gt;; &lt;ref name="AutoRef5"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reeve|title=Why teachers adopt a controlling motivating style toward students and how they can become more autonomy supportive|journal=Educational Psychologist|date=2009|volume=44|issue=3|pages=159–175|doi=10.1080/00461520903028990}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to Sansone and Morgan, when students are already motivated to engage in an activity for their own personal pleasure and then a teacher provides the student with feedback, the type of feedback given can change the way that student views the activity and can even undermine their intrinsic motivation.&lt;ref name="AutoRef13" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deci|last2=Koestner|last3=Ryan|title=Extrinsic rewards and intrinsic motivation in education: Reconsidered once again|journal=Review of Educational Research|date=2001|volume=71|issue=1|pages=1–27|doi=10.3102/00346543071001001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maclellan also looked at the relationship between tutors and students and in particular, and the type of feedback the tutor would give to the student. Maclellan's results showed that praise or criticism directed towards the student generated a feeling of “fixed [[intelligence]]” while praise and criticism directed towards the effort and strategy used by the student generated a feeling of “[[Malleability of intelligence|malleable intelligence]]” &lt;ref name="AutoRef2" /&gt; .  In other words, feedback concerning effort and strategy leaves students knowing that there is room for growth. This is important because when students believe their intelligence is “fixed”, their mindset can prevent skill development because students will believe that they only have a “certain amount” of understanding on a particular subject matter and might not even try.Therefore, it's crucial that a teacher is aware of how the feedback they give to their students can both positively and negatively impact the student's engagement and motivation &lt;ref name="AutoRef2" /&gt;  &lt;ref name="AutoRef4" /&gt;.  

In a correlational study, Katz and Shahar used a series of questionnaires and Likert-style scales and gave them to 100 teachers to see what makes a motivating teacher. Their results indicate that teachers who are intrinsically motivated to teach and believe that students should be taught in an autonomous style are the types of teachers that promote intrinsic motivation in the classroom.&lt;ref name="AutoRef4" /&gt; Deci, Sheinman, and Nezlek also found that when teachers adapted to an autonomous teaching style, students were positively affected and became more intrinsically motivated to achieve in the classroom.  However, while the students were quick to adapt to the new teaching style the impact was short-lived.&lt;ref name="AutoRef6"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deci|last2=Sheinman|last3=Nezlek|title=Characteristics of the rewardee and intrinsic motivation of the rewardee|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1981|volume=40|issue=1|pages=1–10|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.40.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, teachers are limited in the way they teach because they’ll feel a pressure to act, teach, and provide feedback in a certain way from the school district, administration, and guardians.&lt;ref name="AutoRef6" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRef5" /&gt; Furthermore, even if students do have a teacher that promotes an autonomous teaching style, their overall school environment is also a factor because it can be extrinsically motivating. Examples of this would be posters around school promoting pizza parties for highest grade point average or longer recess times for the classroom that brings more canned food donations. 

In conclusion, it is not a matter whether a student is motivated, unmotivated, or more motivated than other students- it's a matter of understanding what motivates students before providing a certain type of feedback. Furthermore, it is also important to note that despite the classroom environment and the teacher's teaching style, the overall school environment plays a role in students’ intrinsic motivation. 

====Indigenous education and learning====
For many indigenous students (such as [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] children), motivation may be derived from social organization; an important factor educators should account for in addition to variations in [[sociolinguistics]] and [[cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;Instructional Conversations in Native American Classrooms (1994). Center for Applied Linguistics: Online Digests (5).&lt;/ref&gt; While poor academic performance among Native American students is often attributed to low levels of motivation, [[wikt:top-down|Top-down]] classroom organization is often found to be ineffective for children of many cultures who depend on a sense of community, purpose, and competence in order to engage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McInerney | first1 = Dennis M. | last2 = Gayton Swisher | first2 = Karen | year = 1995 | title = Exploring Navajo Motivation in School Settings | url = | journal = Journal of American Indian Education | volume = 34 | issue = | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Horizontally structured, community-based learning strategies often provide a more structurally supportive environment for motivating [[Child development of the indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous children]], who tend to be driven by "social/affective emphasis, harmony, holistic perspectives, expressive creativity, and [[nonverbal communication]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pewewardy | first1 = Cornel | year = 2002 | title = Learning Styles of American Indian/Alaska Native Students: A Review of the Literature and Implications for Practice | url = | journal = Journal of American Indian Education | volume = 41 | issue = | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This drive is also traceable to a cultural tradition of community-wide expectations of participation in the activities and goals of the greater group, rather than individualized aspirations of success or triumph.&lt;ref&gt;Wilfred Pelletier (1969). Childhood in an Indian Village. Institute for Indian Studies. Neewin Publishing, Toronto etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, in some indigenous communities, young children can often portray a sense of community-based motivation through their parent-like interactions with siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maynard | first1 = A. E. | year = 2004 | title = Cultures of teaching in childhood: formal schooling and Maya sibling teaching at home | url = | journal = Cognitive Development | volume = 19 | issue = 4| pages = 517–535 | doi=10.1016/j.cogdev.2004.09.005| citeseerx = 10.1.1.492.6959 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it is commonplace for children to [[Child work in indigenous American cultures|assist and demonstrate]] for their younger counterparts without being prompted by authority figures.&lt;!--&lt;ref name="Maynard, A. E. 2004"/&gt; (ref not defined)--&gt; [[Observation]] techniques and [[Child Integration|integration]] methods are demonstrated in such examples as [[weaving]] in Chiapas, Mexico, where it is commonplace for children to learn from "a more skilled other" within the community.&lt;ref name="Greenfield P. M"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greenfield | first1 = P. M. | last2 = Maynard | first2 = A. E. | last3 = Childs | first3 = C. P. | year = 2000 | title = History, culture, learning, and development | url = | journal = Cross-cultural Research | volume = 34 | issue = 4| pages = 351–374 | doi=10.1177/106939710003400404}}&lt;/ref&gt; The child's real responsibility within the [[Maya peoples|Mayan]] community can be seen in, for example, weaving apprenticeships; often, when the "more skilled other" is tasked with multiple obligations, an older child will step in and guide the learner.&lt;ref name="Greenfield P. M"/&gt; Sibling guidance is supported from early youth, where [[learning through play]] encourages horizontally structured environments through alternative educational models such as "Intent Community Participation."&lt;ref&gt;Rogoff, Barbara (2011). Developing Destinies: A Mayan Midwife and Town. Cambridge: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Research also suggests that formal Westernized schooling can actually reshape the traditionally collaborative nature of social life in indigenous communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chavajay | first1 = Pablo | year = 2002 | title = Schooling and Traditional Collaborative Social Organization of Problem Solving by Mayan Mothers and Children | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 38| issue = 1| pages = 55–66| doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.38.1.55 | pmid=11806702}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research is supported cross-culturally, with variations in motivation and learning often reported higher between indigenous groups and their national Westernized counterparts than between indigenous groups across international continental divides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lillemyr |first1=Ole Fredrik |last2=Søbstad |first2=Frode |last3=Marder |first3=Kurt |last4=Flowerday |first4=Terri |date=June 2010 |title=Indigenous and non-Indigenous primary school students' attitudes on play, humour, learning and self-concept: a comparative perspective |journal=European Early Childhood Education Research Journal |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=243–267 |doi=10.1080/13502931003784396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, in some Indigenous communities in the Americas, motivation is a driving force for learning. Children are incorporated and welcomed to participate in daily activities and thus feel motivated to participate due to them seeking a sense of belonging in their families and communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rogoff | first1 = B. | last2 = Paradise | first2 = R. | last3 = Mejia Arauz | first3 = R. | last4 = Correa-Chavez | first4 = M. | last5 = Angelillo | first5 = C. | year = 2003 | title = Firsthand learning through intent participation | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 54 | issue = | pages = 175–203 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145118 | pmid=12499516| hdl = 10400.12/5953 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children's participation is encouraged and their learning is supported by their community and family, furthering their motivation. Children are also trusted to be active contributors. Their active participation allows them to learn and gain skills that are valuable and useful in their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rogoff | first1 = B | year = 2012 | title = Learning without lessons: Opportunities to expand knowledge | url = http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/MESO/article/view/54548| journal = Infancia y Aprendizaje / Journal for the Study of Education and Development | volume = 35 | issue = 2| pages = 233–252 | doi = 10.1174/021037012800217970 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As children transition from early childhood to middle childhood, their motivation to participate changes. In both the Indigenous communities of [[Quechua people]] and Rioja in Peru, children often experience a transition in which they become more included into their family's and community's endeavors. This changes their position and role in their families to more responsible ones and leads to an increase in their eagerness to participate and belong. As children go through this transition, they often develop a sense of identity within their family and community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ames | first1 = P | year = 2013 | title = Learning to be responsible: Young children transitions outside of school | url = | journal = Learning, Culture and Social Interaction | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 143–154 | doi = 10.1016/j.lcsi.2013.04.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The transition from childhood to adolescence can be seen in the amount of work children partake in as this changes over time. For example, Yucatec [[Mayan children]]'s play time decreases from childhood to adolescence and as the child gets older, is replaced for time spent working. In childhood the work is initiated by others whereas in adolescence it is self-initiated. The shift in initiation and the change in time spent working versus playing shows the children's motivation to participate in order to learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gaskins | first1 = S | year = 2000 | title = Children's daily activities in a mayan village: A culturally grounded description | url = | journal = Cross-Cultural Research: The Journal of Comparative Social Science | volume = 34 | issue = 4| pages = 375–389 | doi=10.1177/106939710003400405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This transition between childhood and adolescence increases motivation because children gain social responsibility within their families. In some Mexican communities of Indigenous-heritage, the contributions that children make within their community is essential to being social beings, establishes their developing roles, and also helps with developing their relationship with their family and community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Correa-Chávez | first1 = M. | last2 = Roberts | first2 = A. L. D. | last3 = Pérez | first3 = M. M. | year = 2011 | title = Cultural patterns in children's learning through keen observation and participation in their communities | journal = Adv Child Dev Behav | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 209–241 | doi = 10.1016/b978-0-12-386491-8.00006-2 | pmid=21887963| series = Advances in Child Development and Behavior | isbn = 9780123864918 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As children gain more roles and responsibilities within their families, their eagerness to participate also increases. For example, Young Mayan children of San Pedro, Guatemala learn to work in the fields and family run businesses because they are motivated to contribute to their family. Many San Pedro women learned to weave by watching their mothers sew when they were children, sometimes earning their own wool through doing small tasks such as watching young children of busy mothers. Eager to learn and contribute, these young girls helped other members of their community in order to help their mothers with their weaving businesses or through other tasks such as helping carry water while young boys helped with tasks such as carrying firewood alongside their fathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mejía-Arauz | first1 = R. | last2 = Rogoff | first2 = B. | last3 = Dexter | first3 = A. | last4 = Najafi | first4 = B. | year = 2007 | title = Cultural Variation in Children's Social Organization | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 78 | issue = 3| pages = 1001–1014 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01046.x | pmid = 17517018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children's motivation to learn is not solely influenced on their desire to belong but also their eagerness to see their community succeed. Children from [[Navajo]] communities were shown to have higher levels of social concern than Anglo American children in their schools. By having high levels of social concern the indigenous children are showing concern for not only their learning but also their peers', which serves as an example of their instilled sense of responsibility for their community. They wish to succeed as a united group rather than just themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ali | first1 = J. | last2 = Mcinerney | first2 = D. | last3 = Craven | first3 = R. | last4 = Yeung | first4 = A. | last5 = King | first5 = R. | year = 2013 | title = Socially Oriented Motivational Goals and Academic Achievement: Similarities Between Native and Anglo Americans | url = | journal = The Journal of Educational Research | volume = 107 | issue = 2| pages = 123–137 | doi = 10.1080/00220671.2013.788988 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to be knowledgeable contributors, children must be aware of their surroundings and community's goals. Children's learning in Indigenous-heritage communities is mainly based upon observing and helping out others in their community. Through this type of participation within their community, they gain purpose and motivation for the activity that they are doing within their community and become active participants because they know they are doing it for their community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paradise | first1 = R. | last2 = Rogoff | first2 = B. | year = 2009 | title = Side by Side: Learning by Observing and Pitching In. | url = | journal = Ethos | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 102–138 | doi = 10.1111/j.1548-1352.2009.01033.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Self-determination in education====
Self-determination is the ability to make choices and exercise a high degree of control, such as what the student does and how they do it (Deci et al., 1991; Reeve, Hamm, &amp; Nix, 2003; Ryan &amp; Deci, 2002). Self-determination can be supported by providing opportunities for students to be challenged, such as leadership opportunities, providing appropriate feedback and fostering, establishing and maintaining good relationships between teachers and students. These strategies can increase students' interest, competence, creativity and desire to be challenged and ensure that students are intrinsically motivated to study. On the other hand, students who lack self-determination are more likely to feel their success is out of their control. Such students lose motivation to study, which causes a state of "learned helplessness". Students who feel helpless readily believe they will fail and therefore cease to try. Over time, a vicious circle of low achievement develops.

====Physical activity in education====
Physical activity is body movement that works your muscles and requires more energy than resting. According to a blog by the American Intercontinental University, college students should make time for exercise to maintain and increase motivation. AIU states that regular exercise has impeccable effects on the brain. With consistent running routines, there are more complex connections between neurons, meaning the brain is able to access its brain cells more flexibly. By performing well physically, motivation will be present in education because of how well the brain is performing. After exercising, the brain can have more desire to obtain knowledge and better retain the information. In addition, exercise can relieve stress. Exercising can ease [[anxiety]] and relieve negative effects of stress on the body. Without stress factors, individuals can perform better and more efficiently, since their minds will have a more positive outlook. This positive mood will help keep students motivated and more open and willing to succeed academically. Lastly, exercise increases focus and concentration that could also help students maintain their motivation and focus on their studies. AIU claims that exercise may have improved the students' ability to participate and retain information during the class after they had exercised. Being able to retain information and being willing to participate keeps students motivated and performing well academically.&lt;ref&gt;American Intercontinental University.

===Business===
{{main article|Work motivation|Organizational behavior#Motivation}}
At lower levels of [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]], such as physiological needs, money is a motivator, however it tends to have a motivating effect on staff that lasts only for a short period (in accordance with [[Frederick Herzberg|Herzberg]]'s two-factor model of motivation). At higher levels of the hierarchy, praise, respect, recognition, [[empowerment]] and a sense of belonging are far more powerful motivators than money, as both [[Abraham Maslow]]'s theory of motivation and [[Douglas McGregor (business theorist)|Douglas McGregor]]'s [[theory X and theory Y]] (pertaining to the theory of leadership) demonstrate.

According to Maslow, people are motivated by unsatisfied needs.&lt;ref&gt;Tom P (2004). Managing IT According To A Hierarchy Of Needs. N/A. http://archive.webpronews.com/it/itmanagement/wpn-18-20040302ManagingITAccordingtoaHierarchyofNeeds.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The lower level needs such as Physiological and Safety needs will have to be satisfied before higher level needs are to be addressed. We can relate Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory with employee motivation. For example, if a manager is trying to motivate his employees by satisfying their needs; according to Maslow, he should try to satisfy the lower level needs before he tries to satisfy the upper level needs or the employees will not be motivated. Also he has to remember that not everyone will be satisfied by the same needs. A good manager will try to figure out which levels of needs are active for a certain individual or employee.

Maslow has money at the lowest level of the hierarchy and shows other needs are better motivators to staff. McGregor places money in his Theory X category and feels it is a poor motivator. Praise and recognition are placed in the Theory Y category and are considered stronger motivators than money.
* Motivated employees always look for better ways to do a job.
* Motivated employees are more quality oriented.
* Motivated workers are more productive.

The average workplace is about midway between the extremes of high threat and high opportunity. Motivation by threat is a dead-end strategy, and naturally staff are more attracted to the opportunity side of the motivation curve than the threat side. Motivation is a powerful tool in the work environment that can lead to employees working at their most efficient levels of production.&lt;ref&gt;Steinmetz, L. (1983) Nice Guys Finish Last: Management Myths and Reality. Boulder, Colorado: Horizon Publications Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, Steinmetz also discusses three common character types of subordinates: ascendant, indifferent, and ambivalent who all react and interact uniquely, and must be treated, managed, and motivated accordingly. An effective leader must understand how to manage all characters, and more importantly the manager must utilize avenues that allow room for employees to work, grow, and find answers independently.&lt;ref&gt;Steinmetz, L.L. (1983) Nice Guys Finish Last: Management Myths and Reality. Boulder, Colorado: Horizon Publications Inc. (pp. 43–44)&lt;/ref&gt;

The assumptions of Maslow and Herzberg were challenged by a classic study&lt;ref&gt;Goldthorpe, J.H., Lockwood, D., Bechhofer, F. and Platt, J. (1968) The Affluent Worker: Attitudes and Behaviour Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; at Vauxhall Motors' UK manufacturing plant. This introduced the concept of orientation to work and distinguished three main orientations: instrumental (where work is a means to an end), bureaucratic (where work is a source of status, security and immediate reward) and solidaristic (which prioritizes group loyalty).

Other theories which expanded and extended those of Maslow and Herzberg included [[Kurt Lewin]]'s [[force-field analysis]], [[Edwin A. Locke]]'s [[goal-setting theory]] and [[Victor Vroom]]'s [[expectancy theory]]. These tend to stress cultural differences and the fact that individuals tend to be motivated by different factors at different times.&lt;ref&gt;Weightman, J. (2008) The Employee Motivation Audit: Cambridge Strategy Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the system of [[scientific management]] developed by [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]], a worker's motivation is solely determined by pay, and therefore management need not consider psychological or social aspects of work. In essence, scientific management bases human motivation wholly on [[extrinsic reward]]s and discards the idea of [[intrinsic reward]]s.

In contrast, [[David McClelland]] believed that workers could not be motivated by the mere need for [[money]]—in fact, [[#Extrinsic motivation|extrinsic motivation]] (e.g., money) could extinguish [[#Intrinsic motivation|intrinsic motivation]] such as achievement motivation, though money could be used as an indicator of success for various motives, e.g., keeping score. In keeping with this view, his consulting firm, McBer &amp; Company, had as its first motto "To make everyone productive, happy, and free." For McClelland, satisfaction lay in aligning a person's life with their fundamental motivations.

[[Elton Mayo]] found that the social contacts a worker has at the workplace are very important and that boredom and repetitiveness of tasks lead to reduced motivation. Mayo believed that workers could be motivated by acknowledging their social needs and making them feel important. As a result, employees were given freedom to make decisions on the job and greater attention was paid to informal work groups.

Mayo named the model the [[Hawthorne effect]]. His model has been judged as placing undue reliance on social contacts within work situations for motivating employees.&lt;ref&gt;Human Resources Management, HT Graham and R Bennett M+E Handbooks(1993) {{ISBN|0-7121-0844-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Ouchi]] introduced [[Theory Z]], a hybrid management approach consisting of both Japanese and American philosophies and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Tim, and Scott B. Droege. "Theory Z." Encyclopedia of Management. Ed. Marilyn M. Helms. 5th ed. Detroit: Gale, 2006. 914-916. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 5 Feb. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Its Japanese segment is much like the clan culture where organizations focus on a standardized structure with heavy emphasis on socialization of its members. All underlying goals are consistent across the organization. Its American segment retains formality and authority amongst members and the organization. Ultimately, Theory Z promotes common structure and commitment to the organization, as well as constant improvement of work efficacy.

In ''Essentials of Organizational Behavior'', Robbins and Judge examine recognition programs as motivators, and identify five principles that contribute to the success of an employee [[incentive program]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Robbins |first1=Stephen P. |last2=Judge |first2=Timothy A. |year=2007 |title=Essentials of Organizational Behavior |edition=9 |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |location=[[Upper Saddle River, NJ]] |url=http://wps.prenhall.com/bp_robbins_eob_9/64/16396/4197506.cw/index.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614205602/http://wps.prenhall.com/bp_robbins_eob_9/64/16396/4197506.cw/index.html |archivedate=2009-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Recognition of employees' individual differences, and clear identification of behavior deemed worthy of recognition
* Allowing employees to participate
* Linking rewards to performance
* Rewarding of nominators
* Visibility of the recognition process
Modern organizations adopt non-monetary employee motivation methods rather than tying it with tangible rewards. 
* Provide a positive work environment
* Encourage team contribution and rewards
* Feedback 
* Give challenging roles 
* Empowering employees with training and independent thinking
This method makes employees feel they're a part of the organization and their reward is seeing it grow through their efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://motivationmatters.tips/2016/08/31/team-productivity-employee-morale/|title=Team Productivity: 15 Top Tips to Boost Employee Morale|last=Writer|first=Staff|date=2016-08-31|website=Motivation Matters|access-date=2016-11-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129025611/http://motivationmatters.tips/2016/08/31/team-productivity-employee-morale/|archive-date=2016-11-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Games===
Motivational models are central to [[game design]], because without motivation, a player will not be interested in progressing further within a [[game]].&lt;ref&gt;Radoff, Jon. April 2011. ''Game On: Energize Your Business with Social Games.'' {{ISBN|978-0-470-93626-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several models for gameplay motivations have been proposed, including [[Bartle Test|Richard Bartle's]]. [[Jon Radoff]] has proposed a four-quadrant model of gameplay motivation that includes cooperation, competition, immersion and achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Radoff, Jon. "Game Player Motivations." May 2011. [http://radoff.com/blog/2011/05/19/game-player-motivations/ radoff.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521045620/http://radoff.com/blog/2011/05/19/game-player-motivations/ |date=2011-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The motivational structure of games is central to the [[gamification]] trend, which seeks to apply game-based motivation to business applications.&lt;ref name="msn"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=MSNBC|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/37451547/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets/|title=FarmVille invades the real world|first=Helen|last=Popkin|date=June 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, game designers must know the needs and desires of their customers for their companies to flourish.

There have been various studies on the connection between motivation and games. One particular study was on Taiwanese adolescents and their drive of addiction to games. Two studies by the same people were conducted. The first study revealed that addicted players showed higher intrinsic than [[#Extrinsic motivation|extrinsic motivation]] and more [[#Intrinsic motivation|intrinsic motivation]] than the non-addicted players.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid = 17536482|year = 2007|last1 = Wan|first1 = C.

B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can then be said that addicted players, according to the studies findings, are more internally motivated to play games. They enjoy the reward of playing. There are studies that also show that motivation gives these players more to look for in the future such as long-lasting experience that they may keep later on in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ryan | first1 = R.

In [[programming language]]s (more so [[functional programming]] languages) and [[type theory]], an '''option type''' or '''maybe type''' is a [[parametric polymorphism|polymorphic type]] that represents encapsulation of an optional value; e.g., it is used as the return type of functions which may or may not return a meaningful value when they are applied.  It consists of a constructor which either is empty (named ''None'' or ''Nothing''), or which encapsulates the original data type A (written ''Just'' A or ''Some'' A). Outside of functional programming, these are termed [[nullable type]]s.

==Names and definitions==
In different programming languages, the option type has various names and definitions.

* In [[Agda (programming language)|Agda]], it is named {{code|2=agda|Maybe}} with variants {{code|2=agda|nothing}} and {{code|2=agda|just a}}.
* In [[C++17]] it is defined as the template class {{code|2=c++|std::optional&lt;T&gt;}}.
* In [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], it is defined as {{code|2=CSharp|Nullable&lt;T&gt;}} but is generally written as {{code|2=CSharp|T?}}.
* In [[Coq]], it is defined as {{code|2=coq|1=Inductive option (A:Type) : Type := {{!}} Some : A -&gt; option A {{!}} None : option A. }}.
* In [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], it is named ''Maybe'', and defined as {{code|2=haskell|1=data Maybe a = Nothing {{!}} Just a}}.
* In [[Idris (programming language)|Idris]], it is defined as {{code|2=idris|1=data Maybe a = Nothing {{!}} Just a}}.
* In [[Java (programming language)|Java]], since version 8, it is defined as parameterized final class {{code|2=java|Optional&lt;T&gt;}}.
* In [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]], it is named {{code|2=julia|Nullable{T} }}.
* In [[Kotlin (programming language)|Kotlin]], it is defined as {{code|2=kotlin|T?}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html |title=Null Safety - Kotlin Programming Language |accessdate=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[OCaml]], it is defined as {{code|2=ocaml|1=type 'a option = None {{!}} Some of 'a}}.
* In [[Perl 6]], this is the default, but you can add a {{code|2=perl6|:D}} "smiley" to opt into a non option type.
* In [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]], it is defined as {{code|2=rust|enum Option&lt;T&gt; { None, Some(T) } }}.
* In [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], it is defined as parameterized abstract class {{code|2=scala|1='.. Option[A] = if (x == null) None else Some(x)..}}.
* In [[Standard ML]], it is defined as {{code|2=sml|1=datatype 'a option = NONE {{!}} SOME of 'a}}.
* In [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]], it is defined as {{code|2=swift|enum Optional&lt;T&gt; { case none, some(T) } }} but is generally written as {{code|2=swift|T?}}.

In [[type theory]], it may be written as: &lt;math&gt;A^{?} = A + 1&lt;/math&gt;.

In languages having [[tagged union]]s, as in most [[functional programming]] languages, option types can be expressed as the tagged union of a [[unit type]] plus the encapsulated type.

In the [[Curry-Howard correspondence]], option types are related to the [[absorption law|annihilation law]] for ∨: x∨1=1.

An option type can also be seen as a [[collection (computing)|collection]] containing either one or zero elements.

== The option monad ==
{{Further information|Monad (functional programming)#The Maybe monad}}
The option type is a [[monad (functional programming)|monad]] under these functions:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{return}\colon A \to A^{?} = a \mapsto \text{Just} \, a&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{bind}\colon A^{?} \to (A \to B^{?}) \to B^{?} = a \mapsto f \mapsto \begin{cases} \text{Nothing} &amp; \text{if} \ a = \text{Nothing}\\ f \, a' &amp; \text{if} \ a = \text{Just} \, a' \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
We may also describe the option monad in terms of functions ''return'', ''fmap'' and ''join'', where the latter two are given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{fmap} \colon (A \to B) \to A^{?} \to B^{?} = f \mapsto a \mapsto \begin{cases} \text{Nothing} &amp; \text{if} \ a = \text{Nothing}\\ \text{Just} \, f \, a' &amp; \text{if} \ a = \text{Just} \, a' \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{join} \colon {A^{?}}^{?} \to A^{?} = a \mapsto \begin{cases} \text{Nothing} &amp; \text{if} \ a = \text{Nothing}\\ \text{Nothing} &amp; \text{if} \ a = \text{Just} \, \text{Nothing}\\ \text{Just} \, a' &amp; \text{if} \ a = \text{Just} \, \text{Just} \, a' \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The option monad is an additive monad: it has ''Nothing'' as a zero constructor and the following function as a monadic sum:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{mplus} \colon A^{?} \to A^{?} \to A^{?} = a_1 \mapsto a_2 \mapsto \begin{cases} \text{Nothing} &amp; \text{if} \ a_1 = \text{Nothing} \land a_2 = \text{Nothing}\\ \text{Just} \, a'_2 &amp; \text{if} \ a_1 = \text{Nothing} \land a_2 = \text{Just} \, a'_2 \\ \text{Just} \, a'_1 &amp; \text{if} \ a_1 = \text{Just} \, a'_1 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The resulting structure is an [[Idempotence|idempotent]] [[monoid]].

== Examples ==

=== Scala ===
[[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] implements Option as a parameterized type, so a variable can be an Option, accessed as follows:&lt;ref name="OderskySpoon2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Martin Odersky|author2=Lex Spoon|author3=Bill Venners|title=Programming in Scala|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MFjNhTjeQKkC&amp;pg=PA283|accessdate=6 September 2011|year=2008|publisher=Artima Inc|isbn=978-0-9815316-0-1|pages=282–284}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang="scala"&gt;
// Defining variables that are Options of type Int
val res1: Option[Int] = Some(42)
val res2: Option[Int] = None

// sample 1 :  This function uses pattern matching to deconstruct Options
def compute(opt: Option[Int]) = opt match {
  case None =&gt; "No value"
  case Some(x) =&gt; "The value is: " + x
}

// sample 2 :  This function uses monad method
def compute(opt: Option[Int]) = opt.fold("No Value")(v =&gt; "The value is:" + v )

println(compute(res1))  // The value is: 42
println(compute(res2))  // No value
&lt;/source&gt;

Two main ways to use an Option value exist. The first, not the best, is the [[pattern matching]], as in the first example. The second, the best practice, is the monad method, as in the second example. In this way, a program is safe, as it can generate no exception or error (e.g., by trying to obtain the value of an &lt;code&gt;Option&lt;/code&gt; variable that is equal to &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;). Thus, it essentially works as a type-safe alternative to the null value.

=== OCaml ===
[[OCaml]] implements Option as a parameterized variant type.  Options are constructed and deconstructed as follows:
&lt;source lang="ocaml"&gt;
(* Constructing options *)
let none = None
let some = Some 42

(* Deconstructing options *)
let compute opt = match opt with
  | None -&gt; "No value"
  | Some x -&gt; "The value is: " ^ string_of_int x

print_endline (compute none) (* "No value" *)
print_endline (compute some) (* "The value is: 42" *)
&lt;/source&gt;

=== F# ===
&lt;source lang="ocaml"&gt;

(* This function uses pattern matching to deconstruct Options *)
let compute = function
  | None   -&gt; "No value"
  | Some x -&gt; sprintf "The value is: %d" x

printfn "%s" (compute &lt;| Some 42)(* The value is: 42 *)
printfn "%s" (compute None)      (* No value         *)
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Haskell ===
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
-- This function uses pattern matching to deconstruct Maybes
compute :: Maybe Int -&gt; String
compute Nothing  = "No value"
compute (Just x) = "The value is: " ++ show x

main :: IO ()
main = do
    print $ compute (Just 42) -- The value is: 42
    print $ compute Nothing -- No value
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Swift ===
&lt;source lang="swift"&gt;
func compute(_ x: Int?) -&gt; String {
  // This function uses optional binding to deconstruct optionals
  if let y = x {
    // y is now the non-optional `Int` content of `x`, if it has any
    return "The value is: \(y)"
  } else {
    return "No value"
  }
}

print(compute(42)) // The value is: 42
print(compute(nil)) // No value
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang="swift"&gt;
func compute(_ x: Int?) -&gt; String {
  // This function uses `map` to transform the optional if has a value,
  // or pass along the nil if it doesn't. If `map` results in nil,
  // the nil coalescing operator `??` sets a fall-back value of "No value"
  return x.map { unwrappedX in "The value is: \(unwrappedX)" } ?? "No value"
}

print(compute(42)) // The value is: 42
print(compute(nil)) // No value
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang="swift"&gt;
func compute(_ x: Int?) -&gt; String {
  // This function uses pattern matching to deconstruct optionals
  switch x {
  case .none: 
    return "No value"
  case .some(let y): 
    return "The value is: \(y)"
  }
}

print(compute(42)) // The value is: 42
print(compute(nil)) // No value
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang="swift"&gt;
func compute(_ x: Int?) -&gt; String {
  // This function asserts that x has a value, forcefully unwraps x
  // and CRASHES if nil is encountered!
  return "The value is: \(x!)"
}

print(compute(42)) // The value is: 42
print(compute(nil)) // Crash!
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Rust ===
Rust allows using either pattern matching or optional binding to deconstruct the Option type:

&lt;source lang="rust"&gt;
fn main() {
    // This function uses pattern matching to deconstruct optionals
    fn compute(x: Option&lt;i32&gt;) -&gt; String {
        match x {
            Some(a) =&gt; format!("The value is: {}", a),
            None    =&gt; format!("No value")
        }
    }

    println!("{}", compute(Some(42))); // The value is: 42
    println!("{}", compute(None)); // No value
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang="rust"&gt;
fn main() {
    // This function uses optional binding to deconstruct optionals
    fn compute(x: Option&lt;i32&gt;) -&gt; String {
        if let Some(a) = x {
            format!("The value is: {}", a)
        } else {
            format!("No value")
        }
    }

    println!("{}", compute(Some(42))); // The value is: 42
    println!("{}", compute(None)); // No value
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Julia ===
Julia requires explicit deconstruction to access a nullable value:

&lt;source lang="julia"&gt;
function compute(x::Nullable{Int})
    if !isnull(x)
        println("The value is: $(get(x))")
    else
        println("No value")
    end
end
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang="jlcon"&gt;
julia&gt; compute(Nullable(42))
The value is: 42
julia&gt; compute(Nullable{Int}())
No value
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Perl 6 ===
There are as many null values as there are types, that is because every type is its own null.
So all types are also their own option type.

Basically when use type in a declaration, it can be a value of that type or a null of that type.

To designate that it must have a defined value assigned to it (not be in the null state), use the {{code|2=perl6|:D}} "smiley" designation.

It is also possible to designate that it must always be a null using the {{code|2=perl6|:U}} "smiley".

&lt;hr&gt;

* '''Default Option Type Declaration:'''

&lt;source lang="perl6"&gt;
# no type declaration
my $a;
say defined $a; # False
# has a typed null value
say $a; # (Any)
# Note that Any is the default base class

# with a type declaration
my Int   $b;
my Int:_ $b;    # same as above
say defined $b; # False
say $b;         # (Int)
$b = 42;
say defined $b; # True
&lt;/source&gt;

* '''Defined Declaration:'''

&lt;source lang="perl6"&gt;
# my Int:D $c;      # Error, you have to initialize it with a defined value
my Int:D $c = 0;
say defined $c;     # True
say $c.VAR.default; # (Int:D)
# $c = Nil;         # Error, the default is `Int:D` which isn't a defined value

# If you use the defined type "smiley" you may want to use `is default`
# to be able to accept a Nil. (Nil is not the same as a null in other languages)
my Int:D $d is default(10) = 0;
say $d;          # 0
$d = Nil;
say $d;          # 10

# no need to assign a value if it's the same as the default
my Int:D $e is default(10);
say $e;          # 10
&lt;/source&gt;

* '''Typed Null Declaration:'''

&lt;source lang="perl6"&gt;
my Numeric:U $n;
$n = 1.WHAT;
say $n;          # (Int)
$n = (1/2).WHAT;
say $n;          # (Rat)
# $n = 1;        # Error, only accepts undefined values
# $n = Str;      # Error, only accepts types that do the Numeric role
&lt;/source&gt;

* '''Signatures:'''

Type "smileys" are used more often for method and subroutine signatures than they are for variable declarations.

&lt;source lang="perl6"&gt;
proto sub is-it-defined ( Any:_ $ ) {*} # `Any:_` is the same as `Any`, only used here to line up the signatures

multi sub is-it-defined ( Any:U $ ) { 'undefined' } # a null value that is of type `Any` or a subtype
multi sub is-it-defined ( Any:D $ ) {   'defined' } # a non-null value of type `Any` or a subtype
&lt;/source&gt;

* '''Additional Syntax Relief:'''

There are special variations of {{code|2=perl6|if}} and {{code|2=perl6|unless}} called {{code|2=perl6|with}} and {{code|2=perl6|without}} that check for definedness rather than truthiness.

These set {{code|2=perl6|$_}} by default, unlike their boolean cousins.

&lt;source lang="perl6"&gt;
sub say-is-it-defined ( $value ) {
    # notice that these set `$_` to the argument by default, but `if` does not
    with    $value { say "$_.perl() is defined" }
    without $value { say "$_.perl() is not defined" }
}

say-is-it-defined 0;     # 0 is defined
say-is-it-defined '';    # "" is defined

say-is-it-defined Any;   # Any is not defined
say-is-it-defined my $;  # Any is not defined

my $a;
sub something-or-other { … }

# postfix variation of `with` also sets `$_`
$a = $_ with something-or-other;
# `$a` will change to the result, but only if the result was defined
&lt;/source&gt;

There are also variations of {{code|2=perl6|{{!}}{{!}}}}, {{code|2=perl6|or}} and {{code|2=perl6|and}} that test for definedness.

&lt;source lang="perl6"&gt;
say   0 // 42; # 0
say Nil // 42; # 42

# notice that these set `$_` to the left value
Nil orelse  say "$_.perl() is undefined"; # Nil is undefined
0   andthen say "$_.perl() is defined";   # 0 is defined
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Otto Nebel''' (25 December 1892 – 12 September 1973) was a German [[painters|painter]] born in [[Berlin]], Germany.

==Life==
Nebel started his professional career 1909 in the field of building engineering. He took acting classes at the [[Lessingtheater]] in Berlin until 1914. His acting teachers were the famous [[Rudolf Blümner]] and [[Friedrich Kayssler]]. He wanted to give his debut at [[Stadttheater Haben]] when [[World War I]] broke out. Nebel spent the years of war on the German Eastern and Western Fronts. In 1918, during his 14-month war imprisonment in [[Colsterdale]], England, he wrote his [[expressionistic]] poem ''[[Zuginsfeld]]'' condemning the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Bearing Witness: Perspectives on War and Peace from the Arts and Humanities| publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP| location=2012| isbn=9780773587649| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bYByZd0DvQgC&amp;pg=PT120&amp;dq=otto+nebel&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4vSwUa_cE-Tk4APi1oH4BQ&amp;ved=0CGUQ6AEwCA#| author1=Sherrill Grace |author2=Patrick Imbert |author3=Tiffany Johnstone }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, he returned to Berlin and became friends with [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Georg Muche]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], and their art. He joined the circle around [[Herwarth Walden]] and his wife [[Nell Walden]]. She initiated his collaboration at the Sturm gallery and the art school [[Der Sturm]]. Together with [[Hilla von Rebay]] und [[Rudolf Bauer (artist)|Rudolf Bauer]] he founded the artist group ''Der Krater'' in 1923. During this time he also worked for the magazine ''[[Der Sturm]].'' Nebel married Hildegard Heitmeyer, the assistant of [[Gertrud Grunow]], in 1924. He met Hildegard at the [[Bauhaus]] in [[Weimar]]. They stayed in Weimar until 1925 where they painted, wrote poems and acted. In 1933, when the [[National Socialists]] disparaged his work as [[degenerate art]], he left Germany for [[Switzerland]], first in [[Muntelier]], and later in [[Bern]]. Nebel had financial problems because he was not allowed to work in Switzerland. Thanks to the effort of Kandinsky, he could regularly sell some of his paintings to the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation]] between 1936 and 1951. The [[German Federal Republic]] awarded Nebel the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]] in 1965.

==Early work==
The cutthroat reality he experienced during the [[First World War]] as young soldier and army reserve lieutenant influenced his wish to pursue an artistic career. Landmarks for making this decision were the commemorative exhibition for [[Franz Marc]] and Nebel's acquaintance with [[Herwarth Walden]], whom he met in 1916 in Berlin. Walden provided an important platform for [[avant-garde]] approaches in art, literature, and music with both his Der Sturm gallery and the journal with the same name, and thereby greatly facilitated the breakthrough of expression.

Nebel's distressing experiences during the war is the central theme in his literary debut "[[Zuginsfeld]]" (1920). The 6,000-verse poem picks up the thread of [[August Stramm]]'s poetry and the ensuing Der Sturm school while, however, exploring new paths. The literary [[collage]] depicts the mayhem of war by adopting its typical language. Associatively and playing with words, Nebel produced never-ending word chains using authentic word snippets from military orders, passwords and watchwords, headlines, folk songs, and from the language of the educated in [[German Empire#Wilhelmine era|Wilhelmine Germany]]. The satiric bite of the textual collage is visually manifest in the series of drawings for "Zuginsfeld", which he first executed in 1930. With barbed pen Nebel made caricatures in 50 pen-and-ink drawings of the military and other groups in society who, in his eyes, stirred up elation for the war. The grotesque figures are strongly reminiscent of the imagery used by [[Georg Grosz]] and [[Otto Dix]].

War likewise tragically impacted Nebel's work in that almost all of his pictorial oeuvre created prior to 1933 was destroyed in Berlin during the Second World War. Therefore, we know little of his early paintings, drawing, and prints. Nebel was in touch with well-known artists and writers during the disoriented post-war era of [[inflation]]. He lived in precarious conditions and, among other jobs, took on commissions in order to survive. (See the cover designed for ''[[Die Dame]]'' magazine of 1920.) He sought refuge in the utopia of art as the contrasting program to his dismal plight. In 1920, Nebel joined forces with [[Rudolf Bauer (artist)|Rudolf Bauer]] and [[Hilla von Rebay]] and formed the group [[Der Krater]] / Das Hochamt der Kunst ("The crater / The high mass of art"). The three artists shared the view that painting should be purely [[non-figurative]], zeroing in on artistic experience and emotions. The notion that the revolution of modern art could also lead to a wished-for transformation of society linked them to other avant-garde groups of artists and writers. Even if the group did not stay together long, the ideas it pursued remained fundamental for Nebel's work.

==Runic fugues and runic flags==
Nebel executed them for his poem "[[Unfeig]]" (1924/1925), which is a pivotal work for his notions about the [[alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4sWHJ3IpVToC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=otto+nebel&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-fSwUdm0De-j4AP5pIC4Aw&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=otto%20nebel&amp;f=false| title=Insistent Images| editors= Elżbieta Tabakowska, Christina Ljungberg, Olga Fischer |publisher= John Benjamins Publishing |year=2007 |isbn=9789027243416}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called the poem a [[runic]] fugue. In "Unfeig", as in his other runic fugue "[[Das Rad der Titanen]]" (1926/1957), he used only nine or twelve letters of the alphabet.

The Runen-Fahnen ("Runic Flags") are optical scores that visualize the interplay between individual letters of the alphabet and their various facets. Analogous to the [[fugue]] in music, in the runic fugues the vowels and the consonants chosen at the beginning determine the "theme", which is continually repeated and transformed by expansion, reduction, and inversion. Nebel's goal in reduction and concentration of linguistic material was to create a contrasting language to hackneyed everyday language and its rational use. He wrote, "The miseducated people of our times are deaf to words and blind to images. They do not hear what they read. What they write, they cannot see." Nebel believed that he regained the directness lying hidden behind the conventions of language in individual words and letters of the alphabet. With format larger than man-size, the Runen-Fahnen intimate that the whole body should participate in reading.

The Runen-Fahnen are a fourfold visual representation of the original beginning of the text:

'''Runic Flag 1''' displays the wording in a [[typography]] invented by Nebel. Runic Flags 2-4, in turn, replace [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] characters with another system of signs and thereby break with habitual perception. The individual letters of the alphabet can no longer be overlooked. '''Runic Flag 2''' records sounds by allocating each one a special form and color affiliated to its specific qualities. '''Runic Flag 3''' takes on the level of characters, which we become aware of as graphic unities and forms by means of alienation. '''Runic Flag 4''' combines both aforementioned aspects. Nebel understood characters or runes as independent linguistic entities whose sound or acoustic and visual dimensions were the key part of an artwork. The runic fugues, however, represent an experimental search for the "inner sound" ([[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]) of words and letters, their impact on the emotions. Although the fragments of ''Uns, unser, Er sie Es'' (1922) are to be read as preliminary attempts that culminated in the runic fugues, they nevertheless have a very independent and distinct quality. In the original single sheets that were bound together to make the book, Nebel drafted an ABC using painted geometric symbols. On these folios he attempted, at least partly, to find a correspondence between characters and sounds. The artist reworded them later into collages of paper cuttings, making extremely short poems. These works underscore the parity between word and image in his work, between literary and visual forms of expression. His legacy of manuscripts gives insight into the writing process behind the runic fugues and gives a palpable impression of how content is dependent on language.

=="Musical" works==
Even before Nebel "officially" gave up using representational visual language he created a number of non-objective works, which often had titles taken from music terminology: ''Animato'', ''Dopio movimento'', '''ondo con brio gai'' or ''Con Tenerezza''. They were produced during the 1930s, some during his sojourns in [[Italy]]. Nebel compared his endeavors with those of an [[orchestra conductor]] who "rehearses" a score with an orchestra. These works herald his non-objective work.

This is very much what Wassily Kandinsky had in mind in his trailblazing book ''[[Concerning the Spiritual in Art]]'': "Musical sound acts directly on the soul and finds an echo there because, though to varying extents, music is innate in man." With increasing tendencies to abstraction, Kandinsky too referred to music and sought to express emotions - analogous to writing scores - with colors and forms in his ''[[Compositions, Improvisations, and Impressions]]''.

Nebel untiringly demanded of spectators that they open themselves up to the "resonating tons" of the pictures they view. Nebel asserted, "My painting is poetry, the sister of my linguistic art. Where language ends is where the runic order of symbols begins."

==Bavaria and Ascona==
Around 1926 to 1928 Nebel was often in the [[Bavaria]]n village of [[Kochel]], not far from [[Murnau am Staffelsee|Murnau]]. He loved to regularly visit [[Ascona]] in Switzerland as well. In Kochel he founded a [[wallpaper]] factory and met with much adversity and [[red tape]], forcing him very soon to give up the experiment. He produced numerous wallpaper designs at the time, and was able to utilize them repeatedly for his collages at later dates. During his stay in Kochel he often went on hikes in search of motifs in the Bavarian countryside. The artist commented on his colorful drawings from this period in the following words: "The strangeness of the composition is to be understood humorously. The images are such that belong in children's souls. They may be kept protected under galls on small round tables that can be revolved at will. Then mums can take their darlings for a walk around the countryside of Kochel and tell fairytales. They only have to read the story that Uncle Painter has laid down there." Thus are the instructions that Nebel gave to "read" his "colorful and bright compositions" of this period.

Later in the 1920s he returned periodically to Ascona. There he painted intensely colorful scenes with a southern flair (such as ''Aus Losone'' ("From [[Losone]]") or ''Ascona-Lido''. The town in the [[Ticino]] region had a strongly Italian flair and was a key attraction for many avant-garde artists. Among those he met there was, and they planned to start a painting school together (Cavallo rosso). He was additionally invited to exhibit in Ascona together with the artist's group [[Der grosse Bär]]. The group comprised artists such as [[Marianne von Werefkin]] and the founder of the group, [[Walter Helbling]].

==Italy / Arcadia==

Italy was an eternal magnet for Nebel. During a three-month stay in 1931, he compiled his ''Farben-Atlas von Italien'' ("Italian color atlas"). It was to be the essential basis for many future pictorial compositions. In his explanations on the pages opposite the individual plates, the artist added remarks on the overall ambience of the respective views. The greater the variety of color and the more conspicuous the "resonance", the more generously he calculated the geometrical figures and the colored rectangles. He also "portrayed" the objects by their color-values and "sounds" - whether it was paint on house walls or fishing boats, whether olive or pine groves, mountain ranges or beaches. Ultimately, Nebel compiled a "psycho-historical" catalogue by classifying certain colors according to personal optical impressions, and with the resulting scales he laid the basis for his future work.

How important the color atlas would be for the artist from now on when he was designing or composing pictures can be not only seen in works such as ''Rivoli'', ''Pompejanisches'' ("Pompeian"), ''Camogli'', ''Recco'' or ''Arkadisches'' ("Arcadian"), but already in the sheets ''Siena'' ''I'' to ''III''. As a former construction expert, he was often greatly taken by architectural aspects. In [[Siena]] the earthen colors of the brick buildings dominate. They are interwoven by rhythmic accents - of light and shade, rust-red and olive-green. On the other hand, all sorts of variations blue and gray dominate in the works in which he took the atlas plates of [[Florence]] to hand (''Toscanische Stadt''/''Tuscan City'', 1932), the city in which the artist repeatedly took refuge in the future. The works that are related to Florence are especially full of allusions to architectural motifs and colorful flashes, and infused with the city's characteristic bright light. After going into exile, Nebel interpreted both building motifs and landscapes through the lens of the ''[[Farben-Atlas]]'' ("Color Atlas").

==Abstraction and the non-objective==

The artistic freedom he experienced after leaving Germany in 1933 allowed him to increasingly turn away from [[representation (arts)|representational painting]]. The gallerist [[Jeanne Bucher]] played a role in this transformation in his art. Nebel met her in April 1937 in [[Paris]]. She had several artists representing the "new art" in her program, and among them was [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. Thus Nebel had contact to the cosmopolitan group [[Abstraction-Création]] (''Incidents in Light Yellow'', ''Suspended'', ''Happy'', all 1937). In 1938, Nebel first officially used the term "[[abstract art|non-objective]]" in his work catalogue, and among such pieces classified in this way is work number "U2", ''Animato''. As early as 1936 onwards, he was able to sell works to the newly founded "[[Museum of Non-Objective Painting]]" in New York, that is, to the institution that is now the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]]. Nebel's connections to this museum were of fundamental importance to him, because from 1933 – in exile in [[Bern]] – he was without a [[work permit]]. He had especially Kandinsky's recommendation to thank for the Guggenheim's support, as well as the goodwill of his friend from his first years in Berlin, [[Hilla von Rebay]], who was the initiator and administrator of the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]]. This generous and continuous support continued during the [[Second World War]] and lasted until 1951. Today, 36 works of art by Nebel dating from 1936 to 1948 still belong to the Guggenheim Museum collection in New York. Others have been sold in the meantime.

That Nebel, after the mid-1930s, explored abstract painting more intensively is linked to a present he received from his wife Hilda at Christmas in 1935: an edition of the ''[[I Ching|I Ching: Book of Changes]]''.

==The Near East Series==

The whole work comprises sixty large-format sheets. In 1962, Nebel travelled by boat to the [[Near East]] via [[Dubrovnik]] and [[Mykonos]] to [[Istanbul]], [[Sochi]], and [[Bursa]]. The drawings optically resemble [[Arabic script|Arabic]] or [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] characters and, to a great extent, are executed on gray or black "imperial-quality paper". Nebel considered them to be visual runic narratives that were closely related to his literary texts.

==Early portfolio artworks and series==
In 1929 he executed four portfolio artworks. They were conceived as a crossover between text and image, whereby the image was mostly created first, and the text subsequently captured thoughts and observations on the respective work. The initial outlines in pen or pencil are partially visible under the colored pencil drawing.

It is only the first series ''Karneval'' (Carnival) that has no text; presumably in this case Nebel did not deem a corresponding text necessary. A masked ball that took place in Berlin on February 9, 1929, was the inspiration for the [[carnival]] atmosphere Nebel presents in a kaleidoscope of imagery and movement. In total, the artist opens up 26 windows for spectators, through which they can view brightly colored figures and clowns wearing masks as they drift past. Some of them have an eerie appearance.

==Artists' relationships==
While on leave from the war in Berlin, Nebel visited the commemorative exhibition at [[Der Sturm Gallery]] for [[Franz Marc]], who was killed in the war on March 4, 1916. Thus this pivotal artist came to his notice and was henceforth much admired. In [[Herwarth Walden]] he met a patron of the arts who later opened up options for exhibitions and publishing. Waldens's wife at the time, the Swedish artist [[Nell Walden-Roslund]], ran into Nebel again decades later in Bern, and an old friendship was renewed.

In 1922 [[Moholy-Nagy]] exhibited for the first time in der Sturm Gallery. The two artists met again in 1928 in [[Ascona]], where especially Marianne von Werefkin had become close friends with Nebel. Later Nebel corresponded in particular with [[Lothar Schreyer]] and [[Georg Muche]]. They had become acquainted at Der Sturm gallery, and all three sought to restore the missing metaphysical dimensions of art. Nebel felt rapport with [[Albert Gleizes]] too. In 1935, he received a letter from him in which Gleizes confirmed their artistic affinity: "Nous sommes sur les memes voies, occupies des memes recherches."

In the heyday of Der Sturm, Wassily Kandinsky was seen as someone who revitalized art and was a guiding star for many artists. A large segment of Nebel's work found its way into the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Collection]] in New York through Kandinsky's and Hilla Rebay's support. Kandinsky and Nebel exchanged a wealth of letters and thereby left ample proof of their friendship.

== Technical diversity==
The artist liked to experiment especially with the [[linocut]], a great favorite among the [[German Expressionists]] and a medium that they imbued with new life. After contributing to ''Der Sturm'' journal in the early 1920s he began to work with this printing technique again, in particular in 1936, and produced the 7-series ''Gastgeschenk in Schwarz-Weiss'' ("Hospitality gift in black-and-white"), a self-contained series of 210 linocuts - some of them almost miniatures - presenting a fusion of his hitherto art and form vocabulary. The subject matter of his linocuts follows the repertoire of his colored works on paper and sketches as well as paintings, and occasionally they explore paths for developing entirely new genres. Nebel produced linocuts continually alongside his other work. The medium opened up new and diverse avenues of expression. Again and again he returned to this technique and experimented with different kinds of linoleum and various layers of colors. In this way he achieved a multilayer print very similar to the effect he strived for in his other pictures, that is, to achieve an airy spatial effect. He included cuttings from his linocuts in his ''papiers collés'' and ''collages''. In them he also utilized his Kochel wallpapers. Nebel also regularly experimented with "reverse glass painting". This form of art he discovered during a stay in [[Upper Bavaria]], where it was very popular for devotional and [[votive]] pictures. Late in life he started to explore this technique again and produced spirited and colorful abstract compositions on glass panels.

==Summary==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
A reminiscence and summary by Kate T. Steinitz of Artforum Los Angeles:

{{quote|text="When I read the name Otto Nebel on the window of the [[Raboff Gallery]] I heard the echo of voice of long ago. I never forgot the sound. I had heard it in a dark street in Berlin in the 1920s. First it was a solo [[recital]], then there were two voices; they belonged to a middle-sized man and a tall man, Otto Nebel and [[Kurt Schwitters]]. They were followed by a dozen friends, mainly artists. We all came from a party after a party, or from a cafe house after the opening of an exhibition, or was it a recital after a recital in the Sturm Gallery? I do not remember, but I still hear the noise in the dark street, both painter-poets without inhibition shouting, screaming, howling. There were puns and jokes with bitter meaning under the surface. Nebel recited fragments from this epic '[[Zuginsfeld|Zug-ins-Feld]]' – March-to-War – a true story of his own terrifying experience. He recited war-injured, mutilated sentences; sentences which were hit by gunfire and broken into words, single words of protest, bleeding into sounds.

"Nebel had become a poet and a painter during four years of military war duty plus 14 months in an English prisoner-of-war camp. His successful career as an architect and architectural engineer had been bluntly interrupted. However, the stream of his imagination and his urge to create could not be stopped. Restricted in movement by military duties, he was under continuous pressure. The steam of his protest had to find an outlet in words and pictorial forms. Immediately after his return from war, Nebel joined Herwarth Walden's avant-garde group 'Der Sturm'. From that time he collaborated on the journal ''Der Sturm'', exhibited in the Sturm Gallery and performed at the Sturm recitals. [[Kurt Schwitters]] joined the group about the same time. That night, in the Berlin side-street, Nebel's fiery, meaningful words and Schwitters' deliberately non-sensical words and sounds exploded like fireworks. We were lucky that no policeman interfered. Both Schwitters and Nebel were used to loud and emphatic talk at the performances in the Sturm Gallery. These recitals were not soft-spoken. Schwitters, Nebel and the other performers had to keep up with [[Rudolph Bluemner]], the great master of the spoken word, who had abandoned the stage in order to join Herwarth Walden as writer, critic and performer at the Sturm. The Sturm-wind in the Potsdamerstrasse actually became a hurricane, ravaging syntax and grammar, atomizing sentences. Subjects and predicates with their appended clauses exploded in the air, the most radical over [[Zurich]] in 1916, when Hugo Ball recited poems of mere syllables without meaning, assembled from the debris of words for their mere sound value. Destructive tendencies, as it appeared to the public? Or, as [[Gertrude Stein]] later explained her own disconnected language: '...&amp;nbsp;Breaking the paragraph down and everything down to commence again with not connecting with the daily anything and really to choose something.'

"Nebel chose the expressive power of the word; rhythm and meaning combined in [[staccato]] sentences, in fragments of dialogue, evoking situations but not describing. Words that hit and words laid open the decay under well-masked appearances. The "Zug-ins-Feld" epic appeared in many continuations in the Sturm of 1920–1921. At the time of the recitals in the Sturm Gallery the walls trembled under explosions of anger and protest. The Sturm artists believed in their go; they were moralists within their own laws of morality. They condemned the bloody mass-murder of war, but with their pens, their brushes and their voices they killed armies of writers, artists, critics of other artistic and philosophical creeds. They attacked [[hypocrisy]] and compromise; they preferred to disturb and to frighten their audience more than to please it. That this happened in the halls of an art gallery was not accidental. The search for a new art of the world was to a great extent carried by painter-poets and painter-musicians. [[Arnold Schoenberg]] at that time was a painter of the Sturm movement.

"Nebel is hardly known in the United States. He was not at all known to the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coasts]] before the exhibition of s small selection of this paintings in the Raboff Gallery. Ernest Raboff had discovered them in the [[Simone Heller]] Gallery in Paris, and was fascinated by the beauty and harmony in the thematic wealth of abstract composition and by the elaborate execution. In fact they evoked a harmonic [[music of the spheres]] rather than the fortissimo of Nebel's voice of protest in Berlin in the 1920s.

"Nebel is a classic to the abstract movement in painting. Immediately after his return from the war he joined Kandinsky, [[Paul Klee|Klee]] and Schwitters in their concept of art. They remained lifelong friends. One cannot deny that some of Nebel's paintings have a family likeness to Klee and Kandinsky, but in the way [[Juan Gris|Gris']] and [[Georges Braque|Braque's]] [[cubism|cubist]] paintings have a family likeness to those of [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] of the same period. This is caused by the same spiritual concept, certainly not by dependence or imitation. Nebel, like Klee and Schwitters, limits himself to small formats in contrast to the giant formats of the present-day American school. On his small surface, varying in airy colors as the sky at sunset or dawn, orbit clearly defined shapes or bodies, circles, rods, squares and star-like balls and quick-moving serpentine lines. All sorts of [[constellation]]s seem to move in controlled order. Other paintings give the feeling of stability by the equilibrium of geometrical forms. There is nothing accidental, no painterly blur. Nebel is neither a spontaneous [[action painting|action painter]], nor a [[primitivism|primitive]]. He knows his craft, based upon a sound knowledge of [[color theory|color theories]]. One painting has areas of grey which receive a noble quality from the optical division of color. Small regular dots of complementary colors, placed side by side, according to [[Georges Seurat|Seurat's]] principle, mix in the spectator's eye to the fine grey of clouds, non-figurative, words into forms.

"The precise brushstroke, the jewel-like finish of each dot, line and form caused some critics to classify Nebel as a mere craftsman, a jeweller or enamel artist stepping out into painting. But for Nebel, as for Kandinsky and Klee, art is the visible expression of spiritual concepts. Each work of art, says Nebel, is an image of the artist's mental development and transformation. The most elaborate craftsmanship is just good enough to give shape to inspired and enlightened vision. Means and mediums should be used in harmony with the creative process.

"They are precious and almost sacred as they have to make a revelation visible. The artist must combine visual ability with intelligence of interpretation. Nebel expresses his idealistic philosophy of art in [[dithyramb]]ic sentences, which defy direct literary translation, in a book with 24 reproductions of his paintings, drawings and prints: "Worte zu Bildern" (Words to Images). (Six of these pictures are among 100 works in the possession of the Guggenheim Museum in New York; S. H. Guggenheim was a sponsor of Nebel through many hard years). Out of the expressionist free form of his postwar epic he progressed to rigorous studies of language to intensify his medium. The result was introduction of musical form of the Fugue into poetry.

"Nebel was not the only one who used forms in his literary work; [[James Joyce]], also early in the 20th century, experimented with musical forms in his "Ulysses", e.g., in the episode of the [[Siren (mythology)|Sirens]], where he made a rather free use of the fugue. His intellectual variations of words depend on most complex associations. His boundless growth of linguistic flowers has its roots in the swamp of our civilization. Nebel searched for, and found, an archetype of expression in a so-far-undiscovered world of forms. Nebel's Fugues are unique through a self-imposed discipline. In order to intensify the power of the word he concentrated on words composed of 9 letters of the alphabet only for his first Fugue, "Unfeig" (Brave) and of 12 letters for the second Fugue, "Das Rad der Titanen" (The Wheel of the Titans). He explains this attempt to counteract the lack of expression in the outworn language of our time.

"Unfeig Oblong Format standing like trees. To associate Nebel's return to runic characters with romantic, [[Wagnerian]], or worse, Hitlerian, Teutonism would be a misunderstanding of his purpose, the search of simplicity. There is more and deeper affinity to pictorial values in his literary work. Nebel designed the book "Unfeig" in an oblong format. The poems stand like tress, upright. As a painter he transposes the letters into small colored squares on the last folding leaf of his book. Nebel at the completion of his 70th year looks back upon an oeuvre of 7000 leaves of drawings and series of drawings, 2000 painted and graphic leaves, 200 paintings, many unpublished books and writings, several printed books. (Forthcoming is "[[Die Goldene Spur]]", The Golden Track, Arcade Press.) At the present time, another book is forthcoming, small of format, but great significance. It is the Fugue of 12 runic characters, "[[das Rad der Titanen]]" (The Wheel of the Titans). Twelve letters of the alphabet have the power to roll a gigantic wheel of meaning over a new world in gestation.

"'The myth of creation in the 20th century', in the words of [[Lothar Schreyer]], 'not a repetition of old myths, but Ur-Bilder, prime images, shaped by the impact of the 20th century'."}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3874">'''Phala''' is a [[Sanskrit]] term that means “fruit” of one's actions in [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. In Buddhism, the following types of ''phala'' are identified:
* ''Ariya-phala'' also refers to the fruition of following the Buddhist path.
* ''Maha-phala'' refers the ''great fruits'' of the contemplative life.

==Within Hinduism==
In Hinduism, the term ''phala'' is translated as fruition, results, effects.&lt;ref name=yoga1&gt;[http://www.swamij.com/yoga-sutras-23545.htm Yoga Sutras 2.35-2.45]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yoga-Sûtra of Patañjali (verse 2.36) states:&lt;ref name=yoga1/&gt;
: As truthfulness (satya) is achieved, the fruits of actions naturally result according to the will of the Yogi. (satya pratisthayam kriya phala ashrayatvam)

==Within Buddhism==
Within Buddhism, the term ''phala'' is used to refer to the fruition or results of actions according to the doctrine of [[Karma in Buddhism|karmic action and result]].

===Alternate translations===
The term ''phala'' is translated as:
* fruit (Harvey, 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;39;{{sfn|Peter Harvey|1990|p=39-40}} Keown, 2000, loc 810-813)
* fruition
* effect (Ven. D. Mahinda Thera&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metta.lk/english/buddhist-points.htm Buddhist Points Misunderstood], by Ven. D. Mahinda Thera&lt;/ref&gt;)

===Ariya-phala===
The term ''Ariya phala'' is used to refer specifically to the fruition of following the Buddhist path. The fruition for each of the four levels of the path is identified as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chezpaul.org.uk/buddhism/books/glossary.htm Glossary from "Oneness", by Ven. Ajahn Sanong Katapunyo]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/glossary.html#phala A Glossary of Pali and Buddhist Terms]&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Sota patti phala'', fruition of stream entry 
# ''Sakadagamiphala'', fruition of once returning
# ''Anagami phala'', fruition of non returning    
# ''Arahatta phala'', fruition of the worthy one  or perfected one

===Maha-phala===
The term ''Maha-phala'' refers to the ten "Great fruits" of the contemplative life. According to the ''Samaññaphala Sutta'', the 10 “Great fruits” (DN 2) are:&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.greatwesternvehicle.org/pali/Phala_Nikaya/samannaphala.htm Samaññaphala Sutta (DN 2)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Equanimity (upekkha)
# Fearlessness (nibbhaya)
# Freedom from unhappiness &amp; suffering (Asukhacaadukkha)
# Meditative Absorption ([[jhana]]/[[samādhi]])
# [[Out-of-body experience]]  (Manomaya)
# [[Clairaudience]] (dibba-sota)
# Intuition and mental telepathy (ceto-pariya-ñána)
# Recollection of past lives (Patisandhi)
# [[Clairvoyance]] (dibba-cakkhu)
# End of anxiety &amp; mental agitation ([[nirvāna]])

==Comparison to Christianity==
The fruit (phala) of Buddhism and Hinduism are comparable the [[charism]]s of [[Charismatic Christianity]] which are known as the "sign-gifts” of the [[Holy Spirit]], which are the charisms of prophesy, healing, and [[speaking in tongues]], as described in the Christian Gospels 1 Corinthians 12.

A '''piper diagram''' is a graphical representation of the [[chemistry]] of a [[water]] [[Sample (material)|sample]] or samples.

The [[cation]]s and [[anion]]s are shown by separate [[ternary plot]]s. The apexes of the cation plot are [[calcium]], [[magnesium]] and [[sodium]] plus [[potassium]] cations. The apexes of the anion plot are [[sulfate]], [[chloride]] and [[carbonate]] plus [[hydrogen carbonate]] anions. The two ternary plots are then projected onto a diamond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Piper, A.M.|title=A Graphic Procedure in the Geochemical Interpretation of Water Analysis|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|location=Washington D.C.|year=1953|oclc=37707555|id=[[ASIN]] [https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0007HRZ36 B0007HRZ36] &lt;!--ASIN is not valid on amazon.com, but is on amazon.co.uk--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The diamond is a [[Transformation matrix|matrix transformation]] of a graph of the anions ([[sulfate]] + [[chloride]]/ total anions) and cations ([[sodium]] + [[potassium]]/total cations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=MHPT.BAS: a computer program for modified Hill–Piper diagram for classification of ground water |doi=10.1016/S0098-3004(98)00083-1 |first=N.

The required matrix transformation of the anion/cation graph is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} x' \\ y' \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\frac{\pi}{2}) &amp; \sin(\frac{\pi}{2}) &amp; 0 \\ -2\sin(\frac{\pi}{2}) &amp; 2\cos(\frac{\pi}{2}) &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The piper diagram is suitable for comparing the ionic composition of a set of water samples, but does not lend itself to spatial comparisons. For geographical applications, the [[Stiff diagram]] and [[Maucha diagram]] are more applicable, because they can be used as markers on a map.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Velasco | first1 = V. | last2 = Tubau | first2 = I. | last3 = Vázquez-Suñè | first3 = E. | last4 = Gogu | first4 = R. | last5 = Gaitanaru | first5 = D. | last6 = Alcaraz | first6 = M. | last7 = Serrano-Juan | first7 = A. | last8 = Fernàndez-Garcia | first8 = D. | last9 = Garrido | first9 = T. | last10 = Fraile | first10 = J. | last11 = Sanchez-Vila | first11 = X. | last12 = Sep | first12 =  | year = 2014 | title = GIS-based hydrogeochemical analysis tools (QUIMET) | doi = 10.1016/j.cageo.2014.04.013 | journal = Computers &amp; Geosciences | volume = 70 | issue = | pages = 164–180 | bibcode = 2014CG.....70..164V }}&lt;/ref&gt; Colour coding of the background of the Piper diagram allows linking Piper Diagrams and maps&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peeters|first=Luk|date=2014-01-01|title=A Background Color Scheme for Piper Plots to Spatially Visualize Hydrochemical Patterns|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gwat.12118/abstract|journal=Groundwater|language=en|volume=52|issue=1|pages=2–6|doi=10.1111/gwat.12118|issn=1745-6584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3880">According to the '''Porter hypothesis''', strict [[environmental regulation]]s can induce efficiency and encourage innovations that help improve commercial competitiveness. The hypothesis was formulated by the economist [[Michael Porter]] in an article in 1995.

The hypothesis suggests that strict environmental regulation triggers the discovery and introduction of cleaner technologies and environmental improvements, '''the innovation effect''', making production processes and products more efficient.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, M.: The Porter Hypothesis Revisited. A Literature Review of Theoretical Model and Empirical Test. Lüneburg: Centre for Sustainability Management, 2003, p.2 [http://www2.leuphana.de/umanagement/csm/content/nama/downloads/download_publikationen/38-2downloadversion.pdf CSM Lüneburg]&lt;/ref&gt; The cost savings that can be achieved are sufficient to overcompensate for both the compliance costs directly attributed to new regulations and the innovation costs.

In the [[first mover advantage]], a company is able to exploit innovation by [[learning curve]] effects or [[patent]]ing and attains a dominating competitive position compared to companies in countries where environmental regulations were enforced much later.

The Porter hypothesis has been applied to [[Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals|REACH]]. In one conclusion,&lt;ref&gt;''Chemicals Regulation and the Porter Hypothesis: A Critical Review of the New European Chemicals Regulation'' Torsten Frohwein, Bernd Hansjürgens Journal of Business Chemistry January 2005 [http://www.wirtschaftschemie.de/journal/20051-19-36.pdf] [[open access (publishing)|open access]] publication&lt;/ref&gt; companies that adopt a [[cost leadership]] [[business strategy]] and have a relatively small product portfolio will fare better than companies that compete by [[product differentiation]] and have a larger number of chemicals that require regulation.

Various studies found that stricter environmental regulation stimulates innovation ("weak" version of Porter hypothesis). There is mixed evidence whether stricter regulation enhances business performance ("strong" version).&lt;ref&gt;''The Porter Hypothesis at 20. Can Environmental Regulation Enhance Innovation and
Competitiveness?''

RFF DP 11-01, January 2011 [http://www.rff.org/documents/RFF-DP-11-01.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the type of regulation - market-based approaches or requirements and prohibitions - has an impact, is an open question. Economic theory suggests that market based instruments could be more efficient but there is mixed empirical evidence.&lt;ref&gt;"The Porter Hypothesis at 20" Ambec et al., 2013&lt;/ref&gt; A study of OECD countries, however, showed no evidence of permanent effects of environmental policy tightening on productivity following the introduction of environmental measures, regardless of the type of regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Do Environmental Policies Matter for Productivity Growth?: Insights from New Cross-Country Measures of Environmental Policies.

'''Reflective equilibrium''' is a state of [[Balance (metaphysics)|balance]] or coherence among a set of beliefs arrived at by a process of deliberative mutual adjustment among general principles and particular [[judgment]]s.  Although he did not use the term, philosopher [[Nelson Goodman]] introduced the method of reflective equilibrium as an approach to [[theory of justification|justifying]] the ''principles'' of [[inductive logic]].  The term 'reflective equilibrium' was coined by [[John Rawls]] and popularized in his ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' as a method for arriving at the content of the principles of justice.

[[:de:Dietmar Hübner|Dietmar Hübner]] has pointed out that there are many interpretations of reflective equilibrium that deviate from Rawls' method in ways that reduce the cogency of the idea.&lt;ref name="Hübner"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hübner |first=Dietmar |date=January 2017 |title=Three remarks on 'reflective equilibrium': on the use and misuse of Rawls' balancing concept in contemporary ethics |journal=[[Philosophical Inquiry]] |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=11–40 |doi=10.5840/philinquiry20174112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these misinterpretations, according to Hübner, are definitions of reflective equilibrium as "(a) balancing theoretical accounts against intuitive convictions; (b) balancing general principles against particular judgements; (c) balancing opposite ethical conceptions or divergent moral statements".&lt;ref name="Hübner"/&gt;

==Overview==
Rawls argues that human beings have a "sense of [[justice]]" which is both a source of moral judgment and moral motivation.  In Rawls's theory, we begin with "considered judgments" that arise from the sense of justice.  These may be judgments about general moral principles (of any level of generality) or specific moral cases. If our judgments conflict in some way, we proceed by adjusting our various beliefs until they are in "equilibrium", which is to say that they are stable, not in conflict, and provide consistent practical guidance.  Rawls argues that a set of moral beliefs in ideal reflective equilibrium describes or characterizes the underlying principles of the human sense of justice.

An example of the method of reflective equilibrium may be useful.  Suppose Zachary believes in the general principle of always obeying the commands in the [[Bible]], and mistakenly thinks that these are completely encompassed by every Old Testament command.{{clarify|date=May 2015}}&lt;!--What is "encompassed" supposed to mean here? A member of a set obviously can't "encompass" the set, it's the other way round! If you mean something like "he mistakenly believes that every Old Testament command counts", then just say so, but first prove it is a mistaken belief, or better yet, change your example.--&gt;  Suppose also that he thinks that it is not ethical to [[stoning|stone]] people to death merely for being [[Wicca]]n.  These views may come into conflict (see Exodus 22:18, but see John 8:7).  If they do, Zachary will then have several choices.  He can discard his general principle in search of a better one (for example, only obeying the [[Ten Commandments]]), modify his general principle (for example, choosing a different translation of the Bible, or letting Jesus' teaching from John 8:7 "If any of you is without sin, let him be the first to cast a stone" override the Old Testament command), or change his opinions about the point in question to conform with his theory (by deciding that witches really should be killed).  Whatever the decision, he has moved toward reflective equilibrium.

==Use in Rawls's political theory==
Reflective equilibrium serves an important justificatory function within Rawls's political theory. The nature of this function, however, is disputed. The dominant view, best exemplified by the work of [[Norman Daniels]] and [[T. M. Scanlon|Thomas Scanlon]], is that the method of reflective equilibrium is a kind of [[coherentism|coherentist]] method for the epistemic justification of moral beliefs. However, in other writings, Rawls seems to argue that his theory bypasses traditional [[Meta-ethics|metaethical]] questions, including questions of moral epistemology, and is intended instead to serve a practical function. This provides some motivation for a different view of the justificatory role of reflective equilibrium. On this view, the method of reflective equilibrium serves its justificatory function by linking together the cognitive and motivational aspects of the human sense of justice in the appropriate way.

Rawls argues that candidate principles of justice cannot be justified unless they are shown to be stable. Principles of justice are stable if, among other things, the members of society regard them as authoritative and reliably compliant with them. The method of reflective equilibrium determines a set of principles rooted in the human sense of justice, which is a capacity that both provides the material for the process of reflective equilibration and our motivation to adhere to principles we judge morally sound. The method of reflective equilibrium serves the aim of defining a realistic and stable social order by determining a practically coherent set of principles that are grounded in the right way in the source of our moral motivation, such that we will be disposed to comply with them. As Fred D'Agostino puts it, stable principles of justice will require considerable "up-take" by the members of society. The method of reflective equilibrium provides a way of settling on principles that will achieve the kind of "up-take" necessary for stability.

Reflective equilibrium is not static, though Rawls allows for provisional fixed points; it will change as the individual considers his opinions about individual issues or explores the consequences of his principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rawls |first=John |authorlink=John Rawls |date=1971 |title=A theory of justice |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=[[Belknap Press]] of [[Harvard University Press]] |isbn=0674880102 |oclc=216912 |page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rawls applied this technique to his conception of a hypothetical [[original position]] from which people would agree to a [[social contract]].  He arrived at the conclusion that the optimal theory of justice is the one to which people would agree from behind a [[veil of ignorance (philosophy)|veil of ignorance]], not knowing their social positions.

==Wide reflective equilibrium==
&lt;!--[[Wide reflective equilibrium]] redirects here ([[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt;
{{Expand section|date=October 2017}}
Wide reflective equilibrium, first introduced by Rawls, has been described by Norman Daniels as "a method that attempts to produce coherence in ordered triple sets of beliefs held by a particular person, namely: (a) a set of considered moral judgments, (b) a set of moral principles, and (c) a set of relevant (scientific and philosophical) background theories".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Räikkä |first=Juha |date=2011 |chapter=Wide reflective equilibrium |editor-last=Chatterjee |editor-first=Deen K. |title=Encyclopedia of global justice |series=Springer reference |location=Dordrecht |publisher=[[Springer Verlag]] |pages=1157–1158 |isbn=9781402091599 |oclc=772633396 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-9160-5_33 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to constructivism==
{{See also|Constructivism (psychological school)|Constructivist epistemology}}
[[Kai Nielsen (philosopher)|Kai Nielsen]] has asserted that "philosophers who are defenders of reflective equilibrium are also ''[[Constructivism (psychological school)|constructivists]]''", in response to what he considered to be the misconception that reflective equilibrium works with some necessarily preexisting coherent system of moral beliefs and practices:&lt;ref name="Nielsen"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nielsen |first=Kai |authorlink=Kai Nielsen (philosopher) |date=1996 |chapter=Preface |title=Naturalism without foundations |series=Prometheus lectures |location=Amherst, NY |publisher=[[Prometheus Books]] |pages=9–22 |isbn=1573920762 |oclc=34798014}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quote|The pattern of consistent beliefs, including very centrally moral beliefs, is not a structure to be discovered or unearthed, as if it were analogous to the deep underlying "depth grammar" of language (if indeed there is any such a thing), but something to be ''forged''—constructed—by a careful and resolute use of the method of reflective equilibrium. We start from our considered judgments (convictions), however culturally and historically skewed. This involves—indeed, inescapably involves—seeing things by our own lights. Where else could we start? We can hardly jump out of our cultural and historical skins.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;}}

==Criticism==
[[Paul Thagard]] has criticized the method of reflective equilibrium as "only like a smokescreen for a relatively sophisticated form of logical and methodological relativism" and "at best incidental to the process of developing normative principles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thagard |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Thagard |date=1988 |title=Computational philosophy of science |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |page=115 |isbn=0262200686 |oclc=16525738}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the "numerous problems" of reflective equilibrium, Thagard counted "undue reliance on intuition and the danger of arriving at stable but suboptimal sets of norms".&lt;ref name="Thagard 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thagard |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Thagard |date=April 2009 |title=Why cognitive science needs philosophy and vice versa |journal=Topics in Cognitive Science |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=237–254 [248] |doi=10.1111/j.1756-8765.2009.01016.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In place of reflective equilibrium, Thagard recommended what he considered to be a more [[consequentialist]] method of justifying norms by identifying a domain of practices, identifying candidate norms for the practices, identifying the appropriate goals of the practices, evaluating the extent to which different practices accomplish these goals, and adopting as domain norms the practices that best accomplish these goals.&lt;ref name="Thagard 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thagard |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Thagard |date=2010 |title=The brain and the meaning of life |location=Princeton, NJ |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |pages=202–217 |isbn=9780691142722 |oclc=416717721}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Section_retract.svg|thumbnail|''f'' is a retraction of ''g''. ''g'' is a section of ''f''.|150px]]
In [[category theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], a '''section''' is a [[Inverse function#Left and right inverses|right inverse]] of some [[morphism]]. [[Dual (category theory)|Dually]], a '''retraction''' is a [[Inverse function#Left and right inverses|left inverse]] of some [[morphism]].
In other words, if ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' and ''g'' : ''Y'' → ''X'' are morphisms whose composition ''f'' &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ''g'' : ''Y'' → ''Y'' is the [[identity morphism]] on ''Y'', then ''g'' is a section of ''f'', and ''f'' is a retraction of ''g''.

Every section is a [[monomorphism]], and every retraction is an [[epimorphism]].

In algebra the sections are also called '''split monomorphisms''' and the retractions '''split epimorphisms'''.
In an [[abelian category]], if ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is a split epimorphism with split monomorphism ''g'' : ''Y'' → ''X'',
then ''X'' is isomorphic to the [[direct sum]] of ''Y'' and the [[kernel (category theory)|kernel]] of ''f''.

==Examples==
In the [[category of sets]], every monomorphism ([[injective function]]) with a non-empty domain is a section and every epimorphism ([[surjective function]]) is a retraction; the latter statement is equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]].

In the [[category of vector spaces]] over a field ''K'', every monomorphism and every epimorphism splits; this follows from the fact that linear maps can be uniquely defined by specifying their values on a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]].

In the [[category of abelian groups]], the epimorphism '''Z'''&amp;rarr;'''Z'''/2'''Z''' which sends every integer to its image [[modular arithmetic|modulo 2]] does not split; in fact the only morphism '''Z'''/2'''Z'''&amp;rarr;'''Z''' is the 0 map. Similarly, the natural monomorphism '''Z'''/2'''Z'''&amp;rarr;'''Z'''/4'''Z''' doesn't split even though there is a non-trivial homomorphism '''Z'''/4'''Z'''&amp;rarr;'''Z'''/2'''Z'''.

The categorical concept of a section is important in [[homological algebra]], and is also closely related to the notion of a [[section (fiber bundle)|section of a fiber bundle]] in topology: in the latter case, a section of a fiber bundle is a section of the bundle projection map of the fiber bundle.

Given a [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] &lt;math&gt;\bar X&lt;/math&gt; with quotient map &lt;math&gt;\pi\colon X \to \bar X&lt;/math&gt;, a section of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is called a [[Transversal (combinatorics)|transversal]].

'''Setsuban Kanri''' (節番管理) is the name of a [[production management]] methodology for make-to-order business companies. More specifically, it indicates a "management system by synchronized process blocks" which had been originally set and implemented as a management model for the control of the manufacturing progress with makers whose products were very much tailored upon the requests of their customers. It is specific to organizations where the production model is one of the following: DTO ("Design-to-order"), ETO ("Engineer-to-order"), ATO ("Assembly-to-order") or MTO ("Make-to-order").

==Origins==

The first applications of this model concerned the [[Japan]]ese [[railway]]s and the aviation industry, which in the operational management of activities had been referring to a block by block workflow progress management system (what is meant literally by the expression "suishin kusei kōtei kanri" 推進区制工程管理).

This one was the root of the so-called [[Oiban kanri]] for series production management, of the [[Seiban kanri]] for discontinuous productions and of the Setsuban Kanri for make-to-order productions. The study and formalization of this threefold approach were run later on by JMA - the [[Japan Management Association]], who could base their work on the most significant industrial experiences to date (such as the application of the oiban kanri at [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]]). Besides, they could enrich and tune the methodological contents with specific implementation tools and gave meaningful contributions to the definition of the methodology itself, which was named Setsuban Kanri from the reading of the ideographic characters 節 (setsu = period/temporal unit) and 番 (ban = ordinal number) + 管理 (kanri = management, control).

Employed until the 1970s in many companies operating as make-to-order in [[Japan]], for some decades it has fallen out of practice and knowledge. Since 2006, thanks to the direct initiative of [[Akira Kōdate]], a Japanese engineer who launched it and promoted its application in Italy. Its name had a revival and it is now being adopted by several companies (among machine tools makers especially).

==Basic principles==

The basic principles of the Setsuban Kanri are:

1. ''Awareness of both the "axes" (nijiku kanri 二軸管理) to be managed''.

Make-order productions need a continuous monitoring to grant for integration and fair balance in-between the following:

[[File:Figura setsuban nijiku.jpg|thumb|The double perspective of the ''setsuban kanri'' management approach]]

a. the X axis represents the  made-to-order flow, where attention must be paid to [[quality (business)|quality]], [[cost]], [[time]], and [[customer satisfaction]] issues per each order, throughout all work phases - from the order receipt to the delivery to customer.

b. the Y axis represents the department/function where attention should be paid in managing the load/capacity, know-how and priorities to complete all the orders which go through a single dept./function.

The targets for every order can be achieved only by managing at the same time both axes according to a production plan which allows the various production flows get synchronized one another. Actually, the current [[Project Management]] practices generally result too unbalanced on the X axis; the normal practices of [[production management]], on the contrary, tend to focus almost exclusively to the governance of the Y axis.

[[File:ScreenHunter 02 May. 14 16.59.jpg|thumb|Production Control Board at a machine tool assembly plant]]

2.  ''Synchronization''.

It is like what happens with the Japanese railway system: the on time arrival of trains is not granted by forcing a check on each single train on the run. Instead, it is the result of careful synchronization of the entry and departure of all the trains from/to each railway station. Each train is considered with reference to the train running before and the one to follow. That is to say that the sequence can be effectively managed only by synchronizing the entire system and verifying the consistency among the drawings release plan, the supply plan and the production plan.

3. ''Backward planning starting from point zero''.

Every single order must be planned backwards starting prom a point zero (the point after which it is no longer necessary to have processes monitored because there is a minimum risk of jamming). Choosing a reference time unit called [[Setsuban]] (can be days, weeks, decades or months), a number of time units are accounted for in the calendar and the duration of each stage in the working flow is fixed accordingly, and referred to by using delivery indicators called ''teban'' (see below).

4.  ''The fourfold multilevel planning''.
 
The planning system consists of 4 levels:

a. Level 0 or ''portfolio planning'': all orders to all departments/functions

b. Level 1 or ''make-to-order planning'': each order through all departments

c. Level 2 or ''department planning'': all the orders with each department/function

d. Level 3 or ''block planning'':  plan by block, that is a set of activities related to every single order being realized inside a single department/function.

==Terminology==

'''Workflow progress block''' (Suishin-ku 推進区):

A set of activities realized for a production order within the department or office where a person is clearly identified to be in charge of the correct (qualitative) completion and of meeting the production plan as well.

'''Reference time unit''' (Setsuban 節番):

The unit in which the time available is divided and the basis on which the plan is organized. For simplicity the week  is generally preferred (the work shift or a period of time – e.g. 10 days - can be chosen instead).

'''Delivery turn'''  (Teban手番):

The number showing the moment of time when the object planned should reach or leave a specific division or office (e.g. piece to be worked at dept. Y supposed to get in the dept. at teban 23 and to leave the same department at teban 25).

'''Workflow progress assistant''' (Shinkōin 進行員):

The person in charge of the due progress of the job /activity block in the department where the part/product is being manufactured. It is not necessarily an assigned job role, as it can be performed by the shift leader, by the head of department, by single operators or even by the in-house logistic workforce (e.g. the forklift operator).

'''The management system''' (Suishin kusei kōtei kanri 推進区制工程管理):

The true name of the organizational and managerial system  and the concept the "setsuban kanri" has been referring to from its origins. The term refers to the set of processes, roles, coordination mechanisms and supporting visual tools which allow the management of processes/organizational functions by "blocks of stepping progress (advancement)".

==Tools==

One of the founding principles of Setsuban Kanri is that the work progress control can take place only by combining to electronic tools some visual tools the use of which is the closest possible to the physical place where things happen (e.g. Assembly Dept., R&amp;D office). Four types of tools are used:

• Tools for controlling the quality, cost, time,and customer satisfaction progress over each order for all the y axes

• Tools for managing the workload and capacity, priorities and competences through all the y axes

• Tools for synchronization and portfolio control (e.g. Portfolio plans, aggregated [[Key performance indicator|KPIs]], etc.)

• Tools for the [[know-how]] retrieval and for the execution speed-up of each activity.

==Relationship with other methods of operations management==

The method shares many aspects with the [[Lean Thinking]] techniques. Inspired by the [[Toyota Production System]] (TPS), it facilitates the application of the same approach to [[make-to-order]] business companies, while overcoming some of its limits. As a matter of fact, the Setsuban Kanri is adopting approaches which meet the needs of discontinuous production, high product customization and strict cross-relation among the sale, design and production phases.

[[Image:Bildstein-Fornsalen 01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An [[image stone]] on [[Gotland]], [[Sweden]], with imagery from the tradition of the ''[[Völsunga saga]]'' and ''[[Nibelungenlied]]''. Note the slain [[Sigurd]] with [[Andvarinaut]] on the top of the stone, and a lady who puts snakes into a snake pit.

A '''snake pit''' is, in a literal sense, a hole filled with [[snake]]s. In idiomatic speech, "snake pits" are places of horror, torture and even death in European legends and fairy tales. The [[Viking]] [[warlord]] [[Ragnar Lodbrok]] is said to have been thrown into a snake pit and died there, after his army had been defeated in battle by King [[Aelle II of Northumbria]]. An older legend recorded in ''[[Atlakviða]]'' and ''[[Oddrúnargrátr]]'' tells that [[Attila the Hun]] murdered [[Gunther|Gunnarr]], the [[King of Burgundy]], in a snake pit. In a medieval German poem, [[Dietrich von Bern]] is thrown into a snake pit by the [[Giant (mythology)|giant]] Sigenot – he is protected by a magical jewel that had been given to him earlier by a [[Dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=hYdLS6qyTwUC&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;ots=rZY4rO5laI&amp;dq=he%20origin%20of%20the%20term%20%E2%80%9Csnake%20pit%E2%80%9D%20for%20insane%20asylum&amp;pg=PA66#v=onepage&amp;q=he%20origin%20of%20the%20term%20%E2%80%9Csnake%20pit%E2%80%9D%20for%20insane%20asylum&amp;f=false "Coerrcion as Cure: A critical history of psychiatry".

People may not only share emotions with others, but may also experience similar physiological arousal to others if they feel a sense of social connectedness to the other person. A laboratory-based study by Cwir, Car, Walton, and Spencer (2011) showed that, when a participant felt a sense of social connectedness to a stranger (research confederate), the participant experienced similar emotional states and physiological responses to that of the stranger while observing the stranger perform a stressful task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cwir|first=D.|author2=Carr, P.

==Behavioral neuroscience==
After [[functional imaging]]—[[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) in particular—became popular roughly a decade ago, researchers have begun to study economic decision-making with this new technology. This allows researchers to investigate, on a neurological level, the role emotions play in decision-making.

===Developmental picture===
The ability to describe situations in which a social emotion will be experienced emerges at around age 7,&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt; and, by adolescence, the experience of social emotion permeates everyday [[social exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zeman | first1 = J. | last2 = Cassano | first2 = M. | last3 = Perry-Parrish | first3 = C. | last4 = Stegall | first4 = S. | year = 2006 | title = Emotion regulation in children and adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Developmental &amp; Behavioral Pediatrics | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 155–168 | doi=10.1097/00004703-200604000-00014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elkind|first=David|author2=Bowen, Robert |title=Imaginary audience behavior in children and adolescents.|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=1 January 1979|volume=15|issue=1|pages=38–44|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.15.1.38|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/dev/15/1/38/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies using fMRI have found that different brain regions are involved in different age groups when performing social-cognitive and social-emotional tasks. While brain areas such as [[Medial prefrontal cortex|medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC)]], [[Superior temporal sulcus|superior temporal sulcus (STS)]], [[Temporal pole|temporal poles (TP)]] and [[precuneus]] bordering with [[Posterior cingulate|posterior cingulate cortex]] are activated in both adults and adolescents when they reason about intentionality of others, the medial PFC is more activated in adolescents and the right STS more in adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blakemore|first=S.-J. |author2=den Ouden, H. |author3=Choudhury, S. |author4=Frith, C. |title=Adolescent development of the neural circuitry for thinking about intentions|journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience|date=1 June 2007|volume=2|issue=2|pages=130–139|doi=10.1093/scan/nsm009|url=http://scan.oxfordjournals.org/content/2/2/130.full.pdf+html|pmc=1948845}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar age effects were found with younger participants, such that, when participants perform tasks that involve [[theory of mind]], increase in age is correlated with an increase in activation in the dorsal part of the MPFC and a decrease in the activity in the ventral part of the MPFC were observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MORIGUCHI|first=YOSHIYA |author2=OHNISHI, TAKASHI |author3=MORI, TAKEYUKI |author4=MATSUDA, HIROSHI |author5=KOMAKI, GEN|title=Changes of brain activity in the neural substrates for theory of mind during childhood and adolescence|journal=Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|date=1 August 2007|volume=61|issue=4|pages=355–363|doi=10.1111/j.1440-1819.2007.01687.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1440-1819.2007.01687.x/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies that compare adults with adolescents in their processings of basic and social emotions also suggest developmental shifts in brain areas being involved. Comparing with adolescents, the left [[temporal pole]] has a stronger activity in adults when they read stories that elicit social emotions.&lt;ref name=Burnett&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burnett|first=S|author2=Bird, G |author3=Moll, J |author4=Frith, C |author5=Blakemore, SJ |title=Development during adolescence of the neural processing of social emotion.|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|date=September 2009|volume=21|issue=9|pages=1736–50|pmid=18823226|doi=10.1162/jocn.2009.21121}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temporal poles are thought to store abstract social knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frith|first=C. D|title=The social brain?|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=29 April 2007|volume=362|issue=1480|pages=671–678|doi=10.1098/rstb.2006.2003|pmc=1919402}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zahn|first=R.|author2=Moll, J. |author3=Krueger, F. |author4=Huey, E.

===Neuroeconomics===
{{Main article|Neuroeconomics}}
To investigate the function of social emotions in economic behaviors, researchers are interested in the differences in brain regions involved when participants are playing with, or think that they are playing with, another person as opposed to a computer. A study with fMRI found that, for participants who tend to cooperate on two-person “trust and reciprocity” games, believing that they are playing with another participant activated the [[prefrontal cortex]], while believing that they are playing with a computer did not.&lt;ref name=McCabe/&gt; This difference was not seen with players who tend not to cooperate.&lt;ref name=McCabe&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCabe|first=K.|title=A functional imaging study of cooperation in two-person reciprocal exchange|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=98|issue=20|pages=11832–11835|doi=10.1073/pnas.211415698|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/98/20/11832.long|pmid=11562505|pmc=58817}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors interpret this difference as theory of minds that cooperators employ to anticipate the opponents' strategies. This is an example of the way social decision making differs from other forms of decision making.

In [[behavioral economics]], a heavy criticism is that people do not always act in a fully rational way, as many [[economic model]]s assume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|title=Maps of Bounded Rationality: Psychology for Behavioral Economics|journal=The American Economic Review|date=Dec 2003|volume=93|issue=5|pages=1449–1475|jstor=3132137|doi=10.1257/000282803322655392}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel |author2=Jack L. Knetsch |author3=Richard H. Thaler|title=Anomalies: The Endowment Effect, Loss Aversion, and Status Quo Bias|journal=The Journal of Economic Perspectives|date=Winter 1991|volume=5|issue=1|pages=193–206|jstor=1942711|doi=10.1257/jep.5.1.193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellsberg|first=Daniel|title=Risk, Ambiguity, and the Savage Axioms|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|date=Nov 1961|volume=75|issue=4|pages=643–669|jstor=1884324|doi=10.2307/1884324}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the [[ultimatum game]], two players are asked to divide a certain amount of money, say ''x''. One player, called the ''proposer'', decides ratio by which the money gets divided. The other player, called the ''responder'', decides whether or not to accept this offer. If the responder accepts the offer, say, ''y'' amount of money, then the proposer gets ''x-y'' amount and the responder gets ''y''. But if the responder refuses to accept the offer, both players get nothing. This game is widely studied in behavioral economics. According to the [[rational agent]] model, the most rational way for the proposer to act is to make ''y'' as small as possible, and the most rational way for the responder to act is to accept the offer, since little amount of money is better than no money. However, what these experiments tend to find is that the proposers tend to offer 40% of ''x'', and offers below 20% would get rejected by the responders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Camerer|first=Colin F.|title=Behavioral game theory experiments in strategic interaction|year=2003|publisher=Russell Sage [u.a.]|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0-691-09039-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using fMRI scans, researchers found that social emotions elicited by the offers may play a role in explaining the result. When offers are unfair as opposed to fair, three regions of the brain are active: the [[Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex|dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)]], the [[Anterior cingulate cortex|anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)]], and the [[insular cortex|insula]]. The insula is an area active in registering body discomfort.
It is activated when people feel, among other things, social exclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eisenberger|first=N. I.|title=Does Rejection Hurt? An fMRI Study of Social Exclusion|journal=Science|date=10 October 2003|volume=302|issue=5643|pages=290–292|doi=10.1126/science.1089134|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/302/5643/290.short|pmid=14551436}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors interpret activity in the insula as the aversive reaction one feels when faced with unfairness, activity in the DLPFC as processing the future reward from keeping the money, and the ACC is an arbiter that weighs these two conflicting inputs to make a decision. Whether or not the offer gets rejected can be predicted (with a correlation of 0.45) by the level of the responder's insula activity.&lt;ref name=Stanfey/&gt;

Neuroeconomics and social emotions are also tightly linked in the study of punishment. Research using [[PET scan|PET]] scan has found that, when players punish other players, activity in the [[nucleus accumbens]] (part of the [[striatum]]), a region known for processing rewards derived from actions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Doherty|first=J.|title=Dissociable Roles of Ventral and Dorsal Striatum in Instrumental Conditioning|journal=Science|date=16 April 2004|volume=304|issue=5669|pages=452–454|doi=10.1126/science.1094285|pmid=15087550}}&lt;/ref&gt; gets activated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Quervain|first=D. J.-F.|title=The Neural Basis of Altruistic Punishment|journal=Science|date=27 August 2004|volume=305|issue=5688|pages=1254–1258|doi=10.1126/science.1100735|bibcode=2004Sci...305.1254D}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows that we not only feel hurtful when we become victims of unfairness, but we also find it psychologically rewarding to punish the wrongdoer, even at a cost to our own utility.

==Social or moral aspect==
Some social emotions are also referred to as moral emotions because of the fundamental role they play in morality.&lt;ref name=Eisenberg/&gt; For example, guilt is the discomfort and regret one feels over one's wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson TJ, Stegge H. 1998. Measuring guilt in children: a rose by any other name still has thorns. In Guilt and Children, ed. J Bybee, pp. 19–74. San Diego: Academic&lt;/ref&gt; It is a social emotion, because it requires the perception that another person is being hurt by this act; and it also has implication in morality, such that the guilty actor, in virtue of feeling distressed and guilty, accepts responsibility for the wrongdoing, which might cause desire to make amends or punish the self.&lt;ref name=Tangney&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tangney|first=June P.|title=Moral affect: The good, the bad, and the ugly.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 1991|volume=61|issue=4|pages=598–607|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.61.4.598|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/61/4/598/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all social emotions are moral emotions. Pride, for instance, is a social emotion which involves the perceived admiration of other people, but research on the role it plays in moral behaviors yields problematic results.&lt;ref name=Eisenberg/&gt;

===Empathic response===
[[Empathy]] is defined by Eisenberg and colleagues as an affective response that stems from the apprehension or comprehension of another's emotional state or condition and is similar to what the other person is feeling or would be expected to feel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eisenberg|first=Nancy |author2=Fabes, Richard A. |author3=Murphy, Bridget |author4=Karbon, Mariss |display-authors=etal |title=The relations of emotionality and regulation to dispositional and situational empathy-related responding.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 1994|volume=66|issue=4|pages=776–797|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.66.4.776}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guilt, which is a social emotion with strong moral implication, is also strongly correlated with empathic responsiveness; whereas shame, an emotion with less moral flavor, is negatively correlated with empathic responsiveness, when controlling for guilt.&lt;ref name=Tangney/&gt;

Perceived controllability also plays an important role modulating people's socio-emotional reactions and empathic responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Bernard|title=Social motivation, justice, and the moral emotions : an attributional approach|year=2006|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ [u.a.]|isbn=0-8058-5526-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, participants who are asked to evaluate other people's academic performances are more likely to assign punishments when the low performance is interpreted as low-effort, as opposed to low-ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weiner|first=Bernard|title=An attributional theory of achievement motivation and emotion.|journal=Psychological Review|date=1 January 1985|volume=92|issue=4|pages=548–573|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.92.4.548|pmid=3903815}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social stigma|Stigmas]] also elicit more empathic response when they are perceived as uncontrollable (i.e., having a biological origin, such as having certain disease), as opposed to controllable (i.e. having a behavioral origin, such as obesity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weiner|first=Bernard|author2=Perry, Raymond P. |author3=Magnusson, Jamie |title=An attributional analysis of reactions to stigmas.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 1988|volume=55|issue=5|pages=738–748|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.55.5.738}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
Outcome measures in rehabilitation medicine, are tools used to evaluate the level of [[disability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alexander|first=MS|date=2009|title=Outcome measures in spinal cord injury: recent assessments and recommendations for future directions.|url=|journal=Spinal cord|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1038/sc.2009.18|via=|pmc=2722687}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They could be beneficial for physicians to judge the path of patient's recovery, for researchers to compare different management protocols and for politicians in order to find the cost-effectiveness of their decisions.

As an outcome measure specifically designed for [[spinal cord injury]], the '''Spinal Cord Independence Measure''' is a tool that evaluates how much safe, cheap and independent, a patient can do basic [[activities of daily living]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Catz|first=Amiram|date=1997|title=SCIM--spinal cord independence measure:a new disability scale for patients with spinal cord lesions.|url=|journal=Spinal cord|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1038/sj.sc.3100738|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Catz|first=Amiram|date=2007|title=Spinal Cord Independence Measure:comprehensive ability rating scale for the spinal cord lesion patient.|url=|journal=Journal of rehabilitative research|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1682/JRRD.2005.07.0123|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The measure consists of 19 items categorized in three subscales:self care, respiration and sphincter management, and mobility.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18250">'''Symbolic behavior''' is “a person’s capacity to respond to or use a system of significant symbols” (Faules &amp; Alexander, 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;5).  The symbolic behavior perspective argues that the [[reality]] of an [[organization]] is socially constructed through [[communication]] ([[George Edward Cheney|Cheney]] &amp; Christensen, 2000; Putnam, Phillips, &amp; Chapman, 1996).  Symbolic [[messages]] are used by individuals to understand their [[Social environment|environment]] and create a [[social reality]] (Faules &amp; Alexander, 1978; Mills, 2002).  When faced with uncertainty, individuals continually organize themselves within their group based reality and respond within that reality (Weick, 1995).

==History==
Symbolic interactionism (SI), a phrase coined by Herbert Blumer as early as 1937, was derived from lectures of early philosophy and sociologist theorist George Herbert Mead’s student notes.  Mead’s notes from a course he taught in social psychology were posthumously transcribed into the book Mind, Self, and Society; 1934.  Mead, born in 1863, arguably laid the foundation for the symbolic interactionism concept of how the individual mind arises out of the social process.  Mead’s description of language as communication through significant symbols and concepts of “me” and “I” are examples of his contributions to symbolic behavior perspective.  Symbolic behavior perspective stems from [[symbolic interactionism]] perspective.  [[Blumer]] (1962) summarizes the perspective as how people act towards things based on the meaning those things have for them.  These meanings are derived from [[social interaction]] and modified through interpretation.  The symbolic interactionism perspective relates to the organization by describing how employees form a [[concept]] of self in relationship to their organization as they interact with individuals, subordinates, and superiors within the organizational architecture.  Individuals learn appropriate behavior within an organization as the [[code]] of [[values]], [[roles]], attitudes, and norms of behavior of that work environment become apparent (Wood, 1999).

==Symbolic behavior perspective viewpoints==
Symbolic behavior perspective proposes that individuals are faced with uncertainty when introduced to an organization.  This uncertainty creates a reliance on symbolic messages so individuals can make sense of their environment (Brown, 1986).  In order to reduce uncertainty, organizations create sets of [[standardized]] meanings depicted by [[symbols]].  As symbolic messages are [[Semantics|interpreted]] by individuals, they react collectively within the [[organizational culture]].  As organizational cultures are learned, shared, and transmitted a collective [[social reality]] emerges (Harris &amp; Nelson, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;225). Organizational cultures are created and maintained by symbolic behavior, giving managers an opportunity to create, articulate, and sustain the organization’s values as individuals focus on [shared values] (Colvin, 2000, p. F-9).  The symbolic nature of shared values can also reduce [[ambiguity]] and tension within an organization (Harris &amp; Nelson, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;233).
According to Mead's theory, a social act involves a three-part relationship:  an initial gesture from one person, a response to that gesture by another, and a result.  The result is what the act means for the communicator (Littlejohn &amp; Foss, p.&amp;nbsp;160).

==Symbolic behavior perspective propositions==
The above discussion can be summarized into 7 major propositions posited by Symbolic Behavior Perspective.  The issues of [[complexity]], uncertainty and [[organizing (management)|organizing]], cultural creation and maintenance, interpersonal reality, group behavior, [[leadership]], and managing incongruences are addressed in the following propositions (Harris &amp; Nelson, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;222):

===Complexity===

Proposition 1:  [[Organizational complexity]] creates a reliance on symbolic messages.

===Uncertainty and organizing===

Proposition 2:  Uncertainty promotes a continual process of organizing.

===Cultural creation and maintenance===

Proposition 3:  Symbolic behavior creates and maintains organizational [[cultures]].

===Interpersonal reality===

Proposition 4:  Symbols constitute the basis for [[interpersonal]] reality.

===Group behavior===

Proposition 5:  Groups reaffirm the importance of symbolic behavior.

===Leadership===

Proposition 6:  Leadership requires effective symbolic behavior.

===Managing incongruences===

Proposition 7:  Incongruences and paradoxes are managed through acculturation.

==Tools of symbolic behavior==
According to Harris &amp; Nelson (2008, p.&amp;nbsp;237), tools consist of anything that provides symbolic meaning to people.  Tools can be in the form of verbal or non-verbal communication.

===Examples communication tools===

Stories/myths: As stories are continually repeated, they provide [[analogies]] for individuals and serve to guide behavior within the organization.

[[Titles]]: The use of titles communicates the relationship of the employee in [[correlation]] to the organization.

[[Slogans]]:  Slogans can be used to [[reinforce]] established priorities or to bring attention to new priorities (Waterman, 1987).

Dress:  Clothing is very important to an organization because it communicates culture (Remland, 2003).  Because clothing can [[Social influence|influence]] [[perceptions]] of both behavior and intent (Galin, 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;51), the dress code of an organization can impact their overall image.

Priorities:  The priorities within an organization and the way they are carried out on daily basis carry enormous impact.  Individuals can better identify with the organization when management’s priorities are in line with those of employees (Harris &amp; Nelson, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;238).

==Limitations of symbolic behavior==
An over-reliance on symbolic activities can lead to significant problems.  These include unethical [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]], empty or meaningless actions, [[omnipresence]], divisions, and unexpected interpretations (Harris &amp; Nelson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;239).  Likewise, [[Blumer]] notes in advanced societies large group actions consist of highly recurrent, stable patterns that establish common, established meanings for the participants.  [[Blumer]] heads a warning to bear in mind that new situations present problems requiring adjustment and redefinition (Littlejohn &amp; Foss, p.&amp;nbsp;160).

===Unethical manipulation===
The use of gimmickry, using [[wiktionary:superficial|superficial]] pleasantness to cover up [[dishonest]] activities or intentions, providing misleading or incorrect advice regarding [[safety]], or providing untrue explanations for behaviors are means used by unethical organizations, managers, or coworkers in order to obtain some advantage (Harris &amp; Nelson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;240).

===Empty or meaningless actions===
Without meaning individuals can get caught up in an activity trap, where styles gets substituted for substance (Robbins 1980).  [[Diversity (business)|Diversity]] efforts are criticized for focusing more on comparative statistics generated by sporadic efforts and less on the nature of the issues a clearly thought-out strategic solution (Harris, 1997).

===Omnipresence===
Symbolic messages can prevent effective change or realistic responses to environmental demands.  Cultures create identification and unity (Tompkins &amp; Cheney, 1983), these trained incapacities can occur when values are strong or the culture’s influence is too pervasive.  Specifically, [[obsolescence]], resistance to change, and inconsistency are the three [[risks]] posed by strong values (Deal &amp; Kennedy, 1982).  Strong cultures dictate roles and performances meaning individuals can be co-opted by the culture and its messages (Conrad, 1985). [[Mead]] called a gesture with shared meaning a "significant symbol", suggesting that once there is shared meaning the gesture takes on the value of a significant symbol (Littlejohn &amp; Foss, p.&amp;nbsp;161).

===Divisions===
Symbols can create great divisions in an organization.  Culture provides both division and unity, and the symbols used to reinforce the organization can create powerful [[social alienation]] between individuals and groups.  [[Subcultures]] develop between managers and workers, blue and white collars, or factory and sales creating the potential for a “them versus us” environment (Harris &amp; Nelson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;243).

===Unexpected interpretations===
Can be unpredictable because individuals respond to symbolic behavior through their own [[frame of reference]], attempts to use symbolism can have unintended results (Harris and Nelson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;244).  A judicious use of symbols is necessary or the wrong action based on the right intent can occur.  A powerful sense of organizational [[pride]] can lead to dysfunctional responses by employees and managers (Harris &amp; Nelson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;244).

==Performances involved in symbolic behavior==
A dramatistic perspective views individuals as actors “who creatively play, [[improvise]], interpret, and re-present roles and scripts” (Conquergood, 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;187).  Because the set of intangible activities that support the actual service itself provide a satisfying experience or a performance worth an increased financial burden (Pine &amp; Gilmore, 1999).

===Role performance===
Learning to act out appropriate roles is a fundamental aspect of [[Developmental psychology|human development]] and important to organizational success (Harris &amp; Nelson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;244). One's own ability to use significant symbols to respond to one's self makes the thinking process possible.

===Appropriate front===
Putting on an appropriate front (e.g. choice of clothes, [[language]], [[facial expressions]], excellent [[customer service]]) provides messages to support the role (Harris &amp; Nelson 2008, p 245).  Some individuals seem more adept at saying and doing the right thing at the right time, thereby avoiding [[malapropisms]] with some regularity.  Individuals and group role abilities often determine the acceptability of the act (Pacanowsky &amp; O’Donnell-Trujillo, 1983).

===Dramatic realization===
Using [[Words|verbal]] and [[nonverbal]] symbols to fulfill the requirements of the role leads to dramatic realization (Harris &amp; Nelson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;246).  Image presentation and impression management are popular concepts for these efforts (Lord &amp; Maher, 1991).  Although there may be legitimate concerns regarding unethical impression management, it is a useful tool “to secure leadership positions and to achieve goals” (Hackman &amp; Johnson, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;24).

===Mystification===
A certain amount of mystification is required to put distance between the actor and the audience (Harris &amp; Nelson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;247).

==Types of Rituals==
[[Rituals]] are acted out by performances and encompass all repeated activities (Harris &amp; Nelson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;248).  Rituals provide for organizational reality.

===Rituals of arrival===
The rituals of arrival include those processes that explain what we must learn in order to be a bonafide member of the organization (Harris &amp; Nelson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;248).  [[Socialization]] is the process of indoctrinating [[Indoctrination]] new employees to a company’s [[policies]].  New members find that “taken-for-granted ways no longer fit; the familiar customs and practices of the previous job or role are inappropriate” (Gabriel et al., 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;16).  Many organizations have adopted a clear [[acculturation]] process to guarantee successful socialization (Harris, 1990).

===Rituals of belonging and exclusion===
Once an individual is a part of an organization, there are rituals of belonging and exclusion (Harris &amp; Nelson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;248).  Belonging rituals are indications that one is being accepted within the organization and or work group (Harris &amp; Nelson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;248).

===Organizational rites===
Organization rites are planned activities that have both practical and expressive consequences (Harris &amp; Nelson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;250).  When this definition is applied to corporate life, such diverse activities as personnel testing, [[organizational development]] programs, and [[collective bargaining]] can be seen as rites that have not only practical consequences but also express important cultural meanings (Trice &amp; Beyer, 1985, pp.&amp;nbsp;372–373).

==Related theories==
As mentioned above, symbolic behavior perspective has strong roots in symbolic interactionism perspective.  SI described as a movement is devoted to exploring ways people come together, or come to share meaning.  Philosopher [[Susan Langer]] created the Symbol Theory which posits symbolism to be the central concern of philosophy because it underlies all human knowing and understanding (Littlejohn &amp; Foss, p.&amp;nbsp;105).  Langer believes that while all animal life is dominated by feeling, human feeling is mediated by conceptions, symbols and language.  Animals respond to signs, but humans' stimulus from a sign is significantly more complex. The perspective is also associated with [[symbolic communication]] where animal societies are studied to help understand how symbolic communication affects the conduct of members of cooperating group.  Symbolic behavior is also linked to the work of American anthropologist [[Leslie Alvin White]] (1940) who stated that “all human behavior originates in the use of symbols.”  He believed human behavior and symbolic behavior to be synonymous with one another.  Symbolic behavior perspective is also closely related to [[organizational communication]] and  [[interpersonal relationships]] which involve interaction between two or more people and how they work together to achieve goals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1245">In [[category theory]], a branch of abstract mathematics, a '''tower''' is defined as follows.  Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal I&lt;/math&gt; be the poset

:&lt;math&gt;\cdots\rightarrow 2\rightarrow 1\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;

of whole numbers in reverse order, regarded as a category. A '''(countable) tower of objects in a category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt;''' is a [[functor]] from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal I&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt;.

In other words, a tower (of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt;) is a family of objects &lt;math&gt;\{A_i\}_{i\geq 0}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; where there exists a map
:&lt;math&gt;A_i\rightarrow A_j&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;i&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;
and the composition
:&lt;math&gt;A_i\rightarrow A_j\rightarrow A_k&lt;/math&gt;
is the map &lt;math&gt;A_i\rightarrow A_k&lt;/math&gt;

== Example ==

Let &lt;math&gt;M_i=M&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-module &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;M_i\rightarrow M_j&lt;/math&gt; be the identity map for &lt;math&gt;i&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\{M_i\}&lt;/math&gt; forms a tower of modules.

In [[philosophy]], '''transcendence''' conveys the basic ground concept from the word's literal meaning (from [[Latin]]), of climbing or going beyond, albeit with varying connotations in its different historical and cultural stages. It includes [[philosophies]], systems, and approaches that describe the fundamental structures of being, not as an [[ontology]] (theory of being), but as the framework of emergence and validation of [[knowledge]] of being. "Transcendental" is a word derived from the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]], designating the extra-categorical attributes of beings.&lt;ref name="transcendental"&gt;Caygill, Howard. ''A Kant Dictionary''. (Blackwell Philosopher Dictionaries), Blackwell Publishing Ltd., 2000, p. 398&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="catholic"&gt;Turner, W. (1912). Transcendentalism. In ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''. New York: Robert Appleton Company. &lt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15017a.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Religious definition==
{{See also|Transcendence (religion)}}
In [[religion]], transcendence refers to the aspect of a god's nature and power which is wholly independent of the material universe, beyond all physical laws. This is contrasted with [[immanence]], where a god is said to be fully present in the physical world and thus accessible to creatures in various ways. In [[religious experience]] transcendence is a state of being that has overcome the limitations of physical existence and by some definitions has also become independent of it. This is typically manifested in [[prayer]], [[séance]], [[meditation]], [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]]s and [[paranormal]] "visions".

It is affirmed in various religious traditions' concept of the [[divinity|divine]], which contrasts with the notion of a [[god]] (or, the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]]) that exists exclusively in the physical order (immanentism), or indistinguishable from it ([[pantheism]]). Transcendence can be attributed to the divine not only in its being, but also in its knowledge. Thus, a god may transcend both the universe and knowledge (is beyond the grasp of the human mind).

Although transcendence is defined as the opposite of immanence, the two are not necessarily [[mutually exclusive]]. Some [[theology|theologians]] and [[metaphysics|metaphysicians]] of various religious traditions affirm that a god is both within and beyond the universe ([[panentheism]]); in it, but not of it; simultaneously pervading it and surpassing it.

==Modern philosophy==
{{Further|Transcendental idealism|Transcendental arguments}}

In [[modern philosophy]], [[Immanuel Kant]] introduced a new term — ''transcendental'', thus instituting a new, third meaning. In his [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]], this concept is concerned with the [[condition of possibility]] of knowledge itself. He also opposed the term ''transcendental'' to the term ''transcendent'', the latter meaning "that which goes beyond" (transcends) any possible knowledge of a human being.&lt;ref&gt;cf. ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' or ''[[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Volume 2, Chapter 10, § 141, [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] presented the difference between transcendent and immanent in the form of a dialogue. The dialogists were Thrasymachos, a student of [[German idealism|German Idealism]], and Philalethes, a [[Transcendental idealism|Kantian Transcendental Idealist]]. "Thrasymachos: …I know these expressions from my professor, but only as predicates of a loving God with whom his philosophy was exclusively concerned, as is only right and proper. Namely, if God is situated within the world, he is immanent; if he resides somewhere outside, he is transcendent. … Philalethes: Transcendent knowledge is that which, going beyond all possibility of experience, strives to determine the nature of things as they are in themselves; immanent knowledge, on the other hand, is that which keeps within the bounds of the possibility of experience, but thus can speak only of phenomena." In Schopenhauer’s German: "Thrasymachos: …Mir sind diese Ausdrücke zwar auch bekannt, von meinem Professor her, aber nur als Prädikate des lieben Gottes, mit welchem seine Philosophie, wie sich das eben auch geziemt, es ausschließlich zu tun hatte. Steckt nämlich der in der Welt drinne, so ist er immanent: sitzt er aber irgendwo draußen, so ist er transzendent….Philalethes: Transzendente Erkenntnis ist die, welche, über alle Möglichkeit der Erfahrung hinausgehend, das Wesen der Dinge, wie sie an sich selbst sind, zu bestimmen anstrebt; immanente Erkenntnis hingegen die, welche sich innerhalb der Schranken der Möglichkeit der Erfahrung hält, daher aber auch nur von Erscheinungen reden kann."&lt;/ref&gt; For him ''transcendental'' meant knowledge about our cognitive faculty with regard to how objects are possible ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''. "I call all knowledge ''transcendental'' if it is occupied, not with objects, but with the way that we can possibly know objects even before we experience them."&lt;ref&gt;"I call all cognition transcendental that is occupied not so much with objects but rather with our mode of cognition of objects insofar as this is to be possible ''a priori''. A '''system''' of such concepts would be called '''transcendental philosophy'''." Kant, Immanuel. ''Critique of Pure Reason''. Edited and translated by [[Paul Guyer]] and Allen Wood, Cambridge University Press, 1998. p. 149 (B25)&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, [[metaphysics]], as a fundamental and universal theory, turns out to be an [[epistemology]]. Transcendental philosophy, consequently, is not considered a traditional ontological form of metaphysics.

Kant also equated ''transcendental'' with that which is "...in respect of the subject's faculty of cognition."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'', Introduction, V&lt;/ref&gt; Something is transcendental if it plays a role in the way in which the mind "constitutes" objects and makes it possible for us to experience them as objects in the first place. Ordinary knowledge is knowledge of objects; transcendental knowledge is knowledge of how it is possible for us to experience those objects as objects. This is based on Kant's acceptance of [[David Hume]]'s argument that certain general features of objects (e.g. persistence, causal relationships) cannot be derived from the sense impressions we have of them. Kant argues that the mind must contribute those features and make it possible for us to experience objects as objects. In the central part of his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', the "Transcendental Deduction of the Categories", Kant argues for a deep interconnection between the ability to have self-consciousness and the ability to experience a world of objects. Through a process of synthesis, the mind generates both the structure of objects and its own unity.

A metaphilosophical question discussed by many Kantian scholars is how transcendental reflection is itself possible. Stephen Palmquist interprets Kant's appeal to [[faith]] as his most effective solution to this problem.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Palmquist, "Faith as Kant's Key to the Justification of Transcendental Reflection", The Heythrop Journal 25:4 (October 1984), pp.442-455. A revised version of this paper appeared as Chapter V in Palmquist's book, [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/ksp1 Kant's System of Perspectives] (Lanham: University Press of America, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

For Kant, the "transcendent", as opposed to the "transcendental", is that which lies beyond what our faculty of knowledge can legitimately know. [[Hegel]]'s counter-argument to Kant was that to know a boundary is also to be aware of what it bounds and as such what lies beyond it &amp;ndash; in other words, to have already transcended it.

==Contemporary philosophy==
In [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], the "transcendent" is that which transcends our own consciousness: that which is objective rather than only a phenomenon of consciousness. [[Noema]] is employed in phenomenology to refer to the terminus of an intention as given for [[consciousness]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

[[Jean-Paul Sartre]] also speaks of transcendence in his works. In ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', Sartre uses transcendence to describe the relation of the self to the object oriented world, as well as our concrete relations with others. For Sartre, the [[Pour soi|for-itself]] is sometimes called a transcendence. Additionally if the other is viewed strictly as an object, much like any other object, then the other is, for the for-itself, a transcendence-transcended. When the for-itself grasps the other in the others world, and grasps the subjectivity that the other has, it is referred to as transcending-transcendence. Thus, Sartre defines relations with others in terms of transcendence.&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, Jean-Paul. Being and Nothingness. Trans. Hazel E. Barnes. New York: Washington Square Press, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary transcendental philosophy is developed by German philosopher [[Harald Holz]] with a holistic approach. Holz liberated transcendental philosophy from the convergence of [[neo-Kantianism]], he critically discussed transcendental pragmatism and the relation between transcendental philosophy, [[neo-empiricism]] and the so-called [[postmodernism]].

==Colloquial usage==
In everyday language, "transcendence" means "going beyond", and "self-transcendence" means going beyond a prior form or state of oneself. [[Mystical]] experience is thought of as a particularly advanced state of self-transcendence, in which the sense of a separate self is abandoned. "[[Self-transcendence]]" is believed to be psychometrically measurable, and (at least partially) inherited, and has been incorporated as a personality dimension in the [[Temperament and Character Inventory]].&lt;ref name=Cloninger&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cloninger|first=C.R.|title=A psychobiological model of temperament and character|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|date=December 1993|volume=50|issue=12|pages=975–90|pmid=8250684|doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1993.01820240059008|last2=Svrakic|first2=DM|last3=Przybeck|first3=TR}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of this is described in the book "The God Gene" by [[Dean Hamer]], although this has been criticized by commentators such as [[Carl Zimmer]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2581">The term '''"Ukrainian Avant-Garde"''' was first introduced by [[Paris]]ian [[art historian]] [[Andrei Nakov|Andréi Nakov]] for the [[exhibition]] ''[[Tatlin]]'s dream'', arranged in [[London]], 1973, where works of international standard by avant-garde Ukrainian artists [[Vasyl Yermylov]] and [[Alexander Bogomazov]] were presented to the Western audience. Famous artists were mentioned by Nakov, such as [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[David Burliuk]], [[Vladimir Tatlin]], [[Aleksandra Ekster]], who were connected to [[Kiev]], [[Kharkiv]], [[Lviv]], [[Odessa]] by birth, education, national traditions and identity. The Ukrainian avant-garde artists also include the outstanding [[Alexander Archipenko]], whose art was influenced by impressions of his native land, [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture|Trypillya culture]], archaic [[Cuman]] prairie statues, [[mosaics]] of [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev|Saint Sophia Cathedral]], and [[St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery|St. Michael's]] reliefs and [[peasant]] [[pottery]] colours.

Against this background, Yermylov's and Bogomazov's appearance was not accidental. The first abstract work appeared here - that was the picture by [[Wassily Kandinsky]] on the catalogue cover of "Izdebsky Salon 2" (1910). The first international avant-garde exhibitions in the Russian Empire (the same Izdebsky Salon) took place in [[Odessa]] and [[Kiev]],&lt;ref&gt;in Ukrainian: "Олена Голуб".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4062">'''Vaginal contractions''' are [[muscle contraction|contraction]]s of the [[pelvic muscles]] surrounding the [[vagina]], especially the [[pubococcygeus muscle]]. Vaginal contractions are generally an involuntary muscular response to [[sexual stimulation]], including [[sexual arousal]], and are commonly most intense during [[sexual stimulation]] and culminating in [[orgasm]]. Though usually an involuntary response, some women can control the muscles of the vagina to perform vaginal contractions at will. Vaginal contractions enhance the sexual experience and pleasure for both parties during sexual intercourse.

In a 1982 study, pelvic contractions of 11 women who manually self-stimulated to orgasm were monitored using an anal probe and a vaginal probe simultaneously. Near the perceived start of orgasm, a series of regular contractions began in 9 of the women, with anal and vaginal contractions synchronizing with each other. Three of the women's orgasms consistently included only a series of regular contractions; for six other women, orgasms consistently continued beyond the regular series with additional irregular contractions. Two women had no regular contractions during reported orgasms. The women showed marked differences in orgasm duration and the number of contractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=7181645 |year=1982 |last1=Bohlen |first1=JG | last2=Held |first2=JP | last3=Sanderson |first3=MO | last4=Ahlgren |first4=A | title=The female orgasm: pelvic contractions |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=367–86 |journal= Arch Sex Behav| doi=10.1007/bf01541570}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1994 study confirmed these results, but concluded that some women experience their orgasm regularly without contractions and some report having contractions during orgasm only occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8174183 |year=1994 |last1=Kratochvíl |first1=S |title=Vaginal contractions in female orgasm |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=28–33 |journal=Ceskoslovenska psychiatrie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaginal contractions are caused by both the activity of certain brain regions and the release of the hormone oxytocin. It has been suggested that vaginal contractions during orgasm can increase the chances of pregnancy as they transport sperm up the reproductive tract from the vagina to the oviducts, which decreases the distance it has to travel. Additionally, when the woman is fertile sperm is only transported to the side of the dominant ovary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Why Women Have Orgasms: An Evolutionary Analysis|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-012-9967-x|journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior|date = 2012-06-26|issn = 0004-0002|pages = 1127–1143|volume = 41|issue = 5|doi = 10.1007/s10508-012-9967-x|language = en|first = David A.|last = Puts|first2 = Khytam|last2 = Dawood|first3 = Lisa L. M.|last3 = Welling|pmid=22733154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Involuntary vaginal contractions may arise from non-sexual causes. Involuntary spasm of the muscles around the vagina, usually caused by anxiety, can result in [[vaginismus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000141441.41178.6b |title=Botulinum Toxin in the Treatment of Refractory Vaginismus |year=2004 |last1=Ghazizadeh |first1=Shirin |last2=Nikzad |first2=Masoomeh |journal=Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology |volume=104 |issue=5, Part 1 |pages=922–925}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaginal contractions should not be confused with [[uterine contraction]]s.

An [[2010 College Football All-America Team#Linebacker|All-American in 2010]], Burfict was projected an early first round pick for the [[2012 NFL Draft]] on the eve of his junior season.&lt;ref name="Prisco2012early" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pauline2012early" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuter2012early" /&gt; However, a mediocre on-field performance and poor pre-draft workouts deteriorated his draft stock. He went on to have a productive rookie season, starting 14 games and leading the team in tackles.&lt;ref name="ESPN Rookie Stats"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/59227/burficts-impact-on-bengals-is-unmatched|title=Burfict's impact on Bengals is unmatched|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==High school career==
Burfict attended [[Centennial High School (Corona, California)|Centennial High School]] in [[Corona, California]], where he was part of an undefeated Huskies team that won a [[California Interscholastic Federation|CIF]] title, a state championship with the help of quarterback [[Taylor Martinez]], and was ranked second in the nation by ''[[USA Today]]'' in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |date=December 22, 2008 |title=Fort Lauderdale's Aquinas finishes season atop Super 25 |newspaper=USA Today |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/preps/football/poll/2008-super25.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Burfict led the Huskies with 159 [[Tackle (football move)|tackles]], two [[quarterback sack]]s, two [[interception]]s and two [[Fumble (American football)|fumble]] recoveries. Burfict participated in the [[US Army All-American Bowl]] and was the third-leading tackler for the West team. He also earned numerous All-American honors, including ''Parade''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=O'Shea |first=Michael |date=January 25, 2009 |title=Meet PARADE's All-America High School Football Team |newspaper=Parade |url=http://www.parade.com/news/all-america/2009/parade-all-america-high-school-football-team.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a junior, Burfict collected a team-high 130 tackles and added four sacks, two interceptions and one fumble recovery. He helped anchor a linebackers unit that included fellow Sun Devils Shelly Lyons and [[Brandon Magee]]. Corona Centennial finished the 2007 season as No. 24 on ''USA Today‘s'' Top 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |date=December 26, 2007 |title=Miami Northwestern crowned Super 25 champion |newspaper=USA Today |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/preps/football/poll/2007-super25.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burfict missed almost all of his sophomore season due to academic problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Crabtree |first=Jeremy |date=November 4, 2007 |title=Junior LB makes the grades, delivers impact |newspaper=USA Today |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/recruiting/football/west/2007-10-30-west.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He played in the 2009 [[U.S. Army All-American Bowl]]. Considered a five-star recruit by ''[[Rivals.com]]'' and ''[[Scout.com]]'', Burfict was listed as the No. 1 inside linebacker prospect in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |date=January 16, 2009 |title=Rivals.com inside linebackers 2009 |url=http://rivals100.rivals.com/viewrank.asp?ra_key=2128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://recruiting.scout.com/a.z?s=73&amp;p=9&amp;c=4&amp;pid=65&amp;yr=2009 |title=Linebackers 2009 |work=Scout.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By midseason, Burfict ranked second in the team with 30 tackles despite starting only three of six games, and had five tackles for a loss, two sacks, and three pass break-ups. ''[[ESPN]]'' named him Arizona State's midseason defensive MVP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Miller |first=Ted |date=October 20, 2009 |title=Midseason review: Arizona State |work=ESPN.com |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/pac10/post/_/id/4209/midseason-review-arizona-state }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a road game against [[2009 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia]] on September 26, Burfict collected a season-high 11 tackles (three solo) and one and half tackles for loss. He led the Sun Devils in tackles in five games over the course of the season. By the end of the year, he had collected 69 tackles, seven tackles for loss, and a pair of sacks, and was named a Freshman All-American by ''[[College Football News]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://cfn.scout.com/2/927274.html |last=Cirminiello |first=Richard |title=2009 CFN All-Freshman Team: Defense &amp; Special Teams |date=December 8, 2009 |work=College Football News |access-date=March 10, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219011540/http://cfn.scout.com/2/927274.html |archive-date=December 19, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[Football Writers Association of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.sportswriters.net/fwaa/news/2009/allamerica100107.html |title=2009 AON Insurance/FWAA Freshman All-America Team |work=FWAA |date=January 7, 2010 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also honored as the [[Pacific-10 Conference]] Defensive Freshman of the Year.

At the start of his sophomore season, Burfict was named First-Team Preseason All-American by ''[[The Sporting News]]''. He was also named to the watchlists of the 2010 [[Rotary Lombardi Award]] and the [[Bronko Nagurski Trophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/062210aaa.html |title=ASU's Vontaze Burfict Named First-Team All-American By Sporting News |work=ASU Athletics Football |date=June 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 6, 2010, Burfict was benched by Arizona State head coach Dennis Erickson. The reason given was Burfict's unusually high number of personal foul penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.azcentral.com/sports/asu/articles/2010/10/05/20101005arizona-state-football-burfict-benched.html |title=Dennis Erickson takes Vontaze Burfict out of Arizona State starting lineup vs. Washington |first=Jeff |last=Metcalfe |date=October 5, 2010 |newspaper=The Arizona Republic }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a game against [[2010 Stanford Cardinal football team|Stanford]], Burfict was called for grabbing the facemask of [[Doug Baldwin]], and—after complaining to the referee—charged with a personal foul for unsportsmanlike conduct that gave Stanford a first down at the ASU 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Youtube|sjxxWFNJN-U|Highlights: (6) Stanford - ASU}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two plays later, Stanford scored what turned out to be the winning touchdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.azcentral.com/sports/asu/articles/2010/11/13/20101113asu-vontaze-burfict-mistakes.html |title=ASU football team sees spirited effort derailed by Vontaze Burfict's mistakes |work=The Arizona Republic |date=November 13, 2010 |first=Paola |last=Boivin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burfict finished the 2010 season with a team leading 90 tackles, 8.5 for a loss, and two forced fumbles. ''[[The Sporting News]]'' selected him to their All-American team, as well as Pacific-10 Defensive MVP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.azcentral.com/members/Blog/DouglasHaller/110593 |title=Burfict honored as an All-American |work=The Arizona Republic |date=2010-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Burfict is ASU's first 1st team All-American since [[Terrell Suggs]].

With senior cornerback [[Omar Bolden]] lost for the season to a knee injury, Burfict was expected to take over as the leader of the Sun Devils defense in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.azcentral.com/sports/asu/articles/2011/04/21/20110421asu-football-vontaze-burfict-leader.html |title=ASU's Vontaze Burfict embracing leadership role |newspaper=The Arizona Republic |date=April 21, 2011 |first=Doug |last=Haller }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/story/15084294/burfict-timing-arizona-state-can-climb-if-backer-grows-up |title=Burfict timing?

==Professional career==

===2012 NFL Draft===
When he entered his junior season, Burfict was regarded as one of the best linebackers available in the [[2012 NFL Draft]], projected to go as high as the fifth pick.&lt;ref name="Prisco2012early"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/15014424/flash-forward-top-32-picks-for-the-2012-nfl-draft |title=Flash forward: Top 32 picks for the 2012 NFL Draft |date=May 1, 2011 |work=[[CBSSports.com]] |first=Pete |last=Prisco }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pauline2012early"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/football/nfl/05/03/2012.prospects/ |title=Stanford's Luck headlines early look at top 2012 draft prospects |work=Sports Illustrated |date=May 3, 2011 |first=Tony |last=Pauline}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuter2012early"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/story/15029593/mock-draft-first-look-with-luck-and-heels |title=2012 mock draft: First look with Luck and Heels |work=CBSSports.com |date=May 4, 2011 |first=Chad |last=Reuter }}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems on and off the field at Arizona State, however, caused his draft stock to plummet. In October 2011, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''′s Tony Pauline still ranked him as the No. 20 prospect on his midseason draft board, but noted that he has been "a loose cannon on and off the field, which has raised red flags."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/tony_pauline/10/24/top.50/ |title=Andrew Luck, Trent Richardson high in midseason NFL draft rankings |date=October 24, 2011 |work=SI.com |first=Tony |last=Pauline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burfict entered the [[NFL Combine]] rated as the third best inside linebacker, behind [[Luke Kuechly]] and [[Dont'a Hightower]], but his "disappointing" performance—including a 5.09 sec in the [[40-yard dash]], slowest among linebackers—caused some analysts to project him as a third day (Rd. 4-7) draft pick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rob-rang.blogs.cbssports.com/mcc/blogs/entry/13682485/35011522 |title=Lackluster Combine could push Burfict to Day 3 |work=CBS Sports |first=Rob |last=Rang |date=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/don_banks/02/29/combine.awards/index.html?xid=si_nfl |title=Andrew Luck, Stephen Hill, Vontaze Burfict make their mark on NFL combine |first=Don |last=Banks |work=SI.com |date=February 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NFL scouts also faulted him for his interview process, in which he blamed the Arizona State coaching staff for his mediocre junior season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bruce-feldman.blogs.cbssports.com/mcc/blogs/entry/31626208/35006810 |work=CBS Sports |first=Bruce |last=Feldman |date=February 27, 2012 |title=Burfict from yellow flags to red ones?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later it was also reported that Burfict tested positive for [[marijuana]] at the combine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/arizona|title=Arizona|first=Fox|last=Sports|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Arizona State pro day on March 16, Burfict had an "average" performance by his own estimation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://arizonasports.com/44/1515612/ASU-Pro-Day-Burfict-average-Bolden-100-healthy |title=ASU Pro Day: Burfict 'average', Bolden '100% healthy' |first=Vince |last=Marotta |date=March 16, 2012 |work=Arizona Sports }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Sports Illustrated''{{'}}s Tony Pauline, Burfict "looked poorly conditioned and out-of-place in drills".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/web/COM1195540/index.htm|title=Pro Day Tracker|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/03/16/vontaze-burfict-bombs-his-pro-day-too/|title=Vontaze Burfict bombs his Pro Day, too|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their draft coverage, SI.com projected him as 7th round to undrafted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/nfl/draft-2012/players/97974.html |work=CNN |title=Vontaze Burfict}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burfict eventually went undrafted, but was signed by the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] as an undrafted free agent.&lt;ref name="Yahoo" /&gt;

[[FIle:LB Vontaze Burfict Bengals.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Burfict at Bengals training camp in 2012]]

===2012 season===
An undrafted rookie, Burfict managed to make the Cincinnati Bengals' roster. He played in all 16 games and started 14 of those, finishing the seasons as the Bengals' top tackler with 127 combined tackles, including 18 tackles in their final game of the year against their divisional rival [[2012 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]]. When Burfict was on field, the Bengals defense allowed 2.4 yards fewer per play, allowing 4.5 compared to 6.9 when he was off the field.&lt;ref name="ESPN Rookie Stats" /&gt;

===2013 season===
For incidents that occurred in the 34–30 win over the [[2013 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] in Week 3 of the 2013 season, Burfict was fined a total of $31,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap2000000251454/article/vontaze-burfict-fined-31000-for-two-week-3-incidents |title=Vontaze Burfict fined $31,000 for two Week 3 incidents |work=NFL.com |date=September 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had hit a defenseless receiver ([[James Jones (wide receiver)|James Jones]]) and intentionally struck an opponent in the groin ([[Ryan Taylor (American football)|Ryan Taylor]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2013/09/27/week-3-nfl-fines-vontaze-burfict-antonio-brown-alex-henery/2884709/ |title=Bengals' Vontaze Burfict racks up $31K in Week 3 fines |newspaper=USA Today |date=September 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burfict finished the 2013 season leading the NFL in tackles with 171, and was the only Bengals defensive player selected to the Pro Bowl. He was the first Bengals linebacker to make the Pro Bowl since [[Jim LeClair]] in 1976. Burfict also topped the list for the NFL'Performance-Based Pay' program with earning $299,465.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000152307/article/vontaze-burfict-earns-top-figure-in-performancebased-pay|title=Vontaze Burfict earns top figure in 'Performance-Based Pay'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 9, 2016, in the AFC Wild Card Round against the Steelers, Burfict committed a critical penalty with 18 seconds left in the fourth quarter, when the Bengals were leading Pittsburgh 16-15. Ben Roethlisberger had reentered the game, drove from inside his own 10 yard line, and crossed midfield into Bengals territory. The penalty, which was for an illegal hit to the head on [[Antonio Brown]] after Brown had converted a 4th and 3 for a 1st down into Bengal territory, which together with a second personal foul by [[Adam Jones (American football)|Adam Jones]] positioned Pittsburgh to kick a go-ahead field goal and win the game, 18-16, and advance to the divisional round against the [[Denver Broncos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vontaze Burfict, Pacman Jones commit two personal fouls to give Steelers game-winner|url = https://www.sbnation.com/2016/1/9/10743832/vontaze-burfict-pacman-jones-awful-personal-fouls-hand-steelers-game|website = SBNation.com|accessdate = 2016-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 11, the NFL announced that Burfict would be suspended for the first three games of the 2016 season for repeated violations of player safety rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/bengals--vontaze-burfict-suspended-first-three-games-of-2016-005521943.html|title=Bengals’ Vontaze Burfict suspended three games, plans to appeal|website=Yahoo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4134">{{Descartes}}
The '''wax argument''' or the '''ball of wax example''' is a [[thought experiment]] that [[René Descartes]] created within his ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]''. He devised it to analyze what properties are essential for bodies, show how uncertain our knowledge of the world is compared to our knowledge of our minds, and argue for [[rationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Graziano, Richard G. [http://www.cla.calpoly.edu/~rgrazian/docs/courses/230/instruction/handouts/wax.pdf "Descartes’ wax argument for the sum res cogitans".]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Lex, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/descartes-epistemology/ "Descartes' Epistemology", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The thought experiment==
Descartes first considers all the sensible properties of a ball of [[wax]] such as its shape, texture, size, color, and smell. He then points out that all these properties change as the wax is moved closer to a fire. The only properties that necessarily remain are extension, changeability and movability:

{{quote|text=Let us begin by considering the commonest matters, those which we believe to be the most distinctly comprehended, to wit, the bodies which we touch and see; not indeed bodies in general, for these general ideas are usually a little more confused, but let us consider one body in particular.  Let us take, for example, this piece of wax:  it has been taken quite freshly from the hive, and it has not yet lost the sweetness of the honey which it contains; it still retains somewhat of the odour of the flowers from which it has been culled; its colour, its figure, its size are apparent; it is hard, cold, easily handled, and if you strike it with the finger, it will emit a sound.  Finally all the things which are requisite to cause us distinctly to recognise a body, are met with in it. But notice that while I speak and approach the fire what remained of the taste is exhaled, the smell evaporates, the colour alters, the figure is destroyed, the size increases, it becomes liquid, it heats, scarcely can one handle it, and when one strikes it, no sound is emitted.  Does the same wax remain after this change?  We must confess that it remains; none would judge otherwise.  What then did I know so distinctly in this piece of wax?  It could certainly be nothing of all that the senses brought to my notice, since all these things which fall under taste, smell, sight, touch, and hearing, are found to be changed, and yet the same wax remains.}}

{{quote|text=Perhaps it was what I now think, viz. that this wax was not that sweetness of honey, nor that agreeable scent of flowers, nor that particular whiteness, nor that figure, nor that sound, but simply a body which a little while before appeared to me as perceptible under these forms, and which is now perceptible under others.  But what, precisely, is it that I imagine when I form such conceptions?  Let us attentively consider this, and, abstracting from all that does not belong to the wax, let us see what remains.  Certainly nothing remains excepting a certain extended thing which is flexible and movable.|sign=René Descartes|source=1911 edition of The Philosophical Works of Descartes (Cambridge University Press), translated by Elizabeth S. Haldane}}

These properties are however not directly perceived through the senses or imagination (the wax can be extended and moved in more ways than can be imagined). Instead to grasp the essence of the wax, it must be done through pure reason:

{{quote|text=We must then grant that I could not even understand through the imagination what this piece of wax is, and that it is my mind alone which perceives it.|sign=René Descartes|source=1911 edition of The Philosophical Works of Descartes (Cambridge University Press), translated by Elizabeth S. Haldane}}
