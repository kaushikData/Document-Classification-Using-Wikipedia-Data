[[File:Charity gift cards for good little Yahoos (3119024104).jpg|thumb|A charity gift card, describing its donation as an alternative to a "sweater you'd never wear"]]
'''Alternative giving''' is a form of [[gift|gift giving]] in which the giver makes a [[donation]] to a [[charitable organization]] on the gift recipient’s behalf, rather than giving them an item. The idea of giving something to one person by paying another was applied by [[Benjamin Franklin]] as a "trick [...] for doing a deal of good with a little money", which came to be known as "[[pay it forward]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Franklin to Benjamin Webb|Benjamin Franklin to Benjamin Webb, April 22d, 1784]]&lt;/ref&gt; This form of giving is often used as an alternative to [[consumerism]] and to mitigate the impact of gift-giving on the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newdream.org/holiday/simplify.pdf|title=Simplify the Holidays|publisher=[[Center for a New American Dream]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charities that promote this type of donating will normally provide a card or certificate describing the donation, often with an example of how the donation will be used (such as one day’s worth of food for a hungry person) or a symbolic denomination, called "ownership" or "adoption" (of an animal or a tree for example). Some charities promote alternative giving at weddings in place of [[wedding favors]], normally providing several cards to be left on tables at the reception letting guests know a donation has been made rather than individual cards for each guest. Kate Middleton and Prince William made the decision to "Pay it Forward" with their wedding gifts, asking that the money to be used for gifts be given to charities and good causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/16/royal-wedding-charity-gifts_n_836429.html|title=Prince William &amp; Kate Middleton Ask For Charitable Royal Wedding Gifts, Not Presents|date=16 March 2011|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pop culture references==
The concept was [[satire|spoofed]] in the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode [[The Strike (Seinfeld episode)|"The Strike"]]. [[George Costanza]], angry at having received a donation to charity instead of an actual gift, made up his own non-existent charity and handed out fake donations to save money on gifts and cheques.

Comedian [[Ricky Gervais]] poked fun at the concept during a stand-up routine in which he recounts the time when his friends gave a goat to an African family in Gervais' name. Gervais considers this to be a lose-lose situation for all involved: he gets nothing, his friends spent a considerable amount of money on the alternative gift, the African family would not likely appreciate having "another mouth to feed," and the goat being taken away from its natural environment to an unfamiliar place unsuited for it.

The '''American Zen Teachers Association''' was founded in the late 1980s as the Second Generation Zen Teachers Group. It is a peer-group organization of ordained and lay [[Zen Buddhist]] teachers, all of whom have received either teaching authorization or [[dharma transmission]] from the mostly [[Asia]]n Zen teachers who brought their practices to [[United States of America|America]] in the second half of the twentieth century, or their heirs. The first meetings of the AZTA were attended by a dozen or so people, reflecting what would be a Western Zen phenomenon of roughly equal numbers of men and women.

Today the AZTA has grown to over two hundred members. AZTA members serve Buddhist groups ranging from a dozen or so people who meet and practice in members’ homes or area churches to those serving three or four hundred members and who meet and practice in large [[temple]]s and monasteries.

[[File:Park Kyu-su.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Bak Gyusu]]
'''Bak Gyusu''' (박규수, 朴珪壽, 1807&amp;ndash;1877) was a [[scholar-bureaucrat]], teacher, politician, and a diplomat of the [[Joseon Dynasty]]. He was known as a pioneer of the enlightenment group. Bak Gyusu was a grandson of [[Bak Jiwon (born 1737)|Park Ji-won]], the great [[Silhak]] scholar of the Joseon. His nickname was '''Hwanjae''' (환재, 瓛齋), '''Hwanjae''' (환재, 桓齋) en '''Heonjae''' (헌재, 獻齋), '''Hwanjaegeosa''' (환재거사  瓛齋居士).

==Life==
In 1827, Bak Gyusu met [[Crown Prince Hyomyeong]], who quickly became a trusted friend. The Crown Prince would often ask Bak for his thoughts on the delicate political and social issues of the day. When the Crown Prince died three years later at the age of 20, Bak fell into a deep state of mourning. Due to this, Bak isolated himself from the outside world for twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohmynews.com/NWS_Web/view/at_pg.aspx?CNTN_CD=A0000275319 조선의 마지막 희망이었던 '효명세자'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723001233/http://www.ohmynews.com/NWS_Web/view/at_pg.aspx?CNTN_CD=A0000275319 |date=2011-07-23 }} 오마이뉴스&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1848, he successfully passed the [[Gwageo]] civil service exam, a test required for government work. Doing well on this test allowed Bak Gyusu to acquire a well-paid job early on. Later in his life, Bak became a mentor for a Korean politician [[Pak Yeong-hyo|Pak Yung-hio]] during the mid-1870s. Bak decided to instruct Pak Yung-hio in his ways of enlightened thinking after he took the initiative and sought him out.&lt;ref&gt;반민족문제연구소,《친일파99인》(돌베개, 1993년) 119쪽(윤해동 집필 부분)&lt;/ref&gt; Bak's ideas influenced many people throughout Korea, the most notable being the Korean reformist [[Kim Okgyun]], who went on to incorporate foreign sciences and technologies into Korea in order to help strengthen it against further encroachment and military advances by an increasingly imperialistic Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Harrington, Fred Harvey. 1966. ''God, Mammon and the Japanese: dr. Horace N. Allen and Korean-American relations, 1884-1905''. Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin Press. OCLC: 63470036&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period of [[Emperor Gojong of the Korean Empire|King Gojong]]'s reign, the Queen actively supported him. [[Queen Sinjeong]] had been the wife of Crown Prince Hyomyeong, who was posthumously named [[Crown Prince Hyomyeong|King Munjo]].  Bak Gyusu was the governor of [[Pyongan]] province when the [[General Sherman incident|''General Sherman'' incident]] occurred, an event commonly cited as an important catalyst to the ending of Korean isolationism in the 19th century. On the 9th of July, 1866, the ''General Sherman'' entered the [[General Sherman incident|Keupsa Gate]] without permission. Bak gave the ''General Sherman''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s crew a warning to depart from Joseon. The ship's crew ignored his warning and captured the messenger [[Adjutant general|adjutant-general]] Yi Hyon-Ik, a subordinate of Bak Gyusu. Bak was present during the rescue of Yi and the destruction of the ''General Sherman'' on the 24th of July, 1866. In 1872, Bak Gyusu was made the Joseon Chief Envoy to the court of the [[Tongzhi Emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;Kang, Jae-eun, and Suzanne Lee. (2006).

She is a critic of [[intelligent design]] and the [[Discovery Institute]].

== Biography ==
Forrest is a graduate of [[Hammond High School (Louisiana)|Hammond High School]]. She received her B.A. in English in 1974 from [[Southeastern Louisiana University]], her M.A. in Philosophy in 1978 from [[Louisiana State University]], and her Ph.D. in philosophy from [[Tulane University]] in 1988. She has taught [[philosophy]] at [[Southeastern Louisiana University]] since 1988 and presently is a professor of philosophy in the Department of History and Political Science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.selu.edu/Academics/Faculty/bforrest/Forrest_ONLINE_Vitae_July_07.pdf Forrest's ''curriculum vitae'' (July 2007).]&lt;/ref&gt;

She co-authored ''[[Creationism's Trojan Horse: The Wedge of Intelligent Design]]'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 2004), with biologist [[Paul R. Gross]]. The book examines the goals and strategies of the [[intelligent design movement]] and its attempts to undermine the teaching of [[evolutionary biology]]. The authors analyze the absence of a scientific intelligent design hypothesis, identifies religious foundations, and the political ambitions of intelligent design proponents. They examine the movement's [[Wedge strategy]] which has advanced and is succeeding through public relations rather than through scientific research. They also highlight intelligent design creationism's relationship to [[public education]] and to the [[First amendment|separation of church and state]].

Forrest serves on the board of directors of the [[National Center for Science Education]] (NCSE), the Board of Trustees of [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]], and the New Orleans Secular Humanist Association (NOSHA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Supporters of NCSE |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |url=http://ncseweb.org/about/supporters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Americans United Board of Trustees |publisher=[[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] |url=http://www.au.org/site/PageServer?pagename=about_board}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nosha.secularhumanism.net/whoswho.html Who's who] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503031945/http://nosha.secularhumanism.net/whoswho.html |date=May 3, 2008 }}, New Orleans Secular Humanist Association&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intelligent design==

===Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District===
Forrest was a key [[expert witness]] for the plaintiffs in the 2005 [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]] trial.  The defendants were represented by the [[Thomas More Law Center]] (TMLC), a conservative Christian, not-for-profit law center whose motto is ''"The Sword and the Shield for People of Faith"''. After Forrest had been deposed, the TMLC tried but failed to have her stopped from testifying. In a motion to have her removed as a witness, they described her as "little more than a conspiracy theorist and a web-surfing, 'cyber-stalker' of the Discovery Institute...."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/all_legal/2005-09_pretrial_in_limine_motions/Forrest/2005-09-06_Ds_brief_supporting_motion_in_limine_exclude_Forrest.pdf Brief supporting defendants' motion in limine] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712170113/http://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/all_legal/2005-09_pretrial_in_limine_motions/Forrest/2005-09-06_Ds_brief_supporting_motion_in_limine_exclude_Forrest.pdf |date=July 12, 2007 }}, [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/all_legal/2005-09_pretrial_in_limine_motions/Forrest/2005-09-06_Ds_motion_in_limine_exclude_Forrest.pdf Defendants' motion in limine] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712170153/http://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/all_legal/2005-09_pretrial_in_limine_motions/Forrest/2005-09-06_Ds_motion_in_limine_exclude_Forrest.pdf |date=July 12, 2007 }}, [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Jones denied the motion and Forrest's testimony began on October 5.

According to Forrest, after the TMLC's attempt to exclude her as a witness had failed, and only a few days before she would be testifying, the [[Discovery Institute]] attempted to  publicly ridicule her on their website.  She wrote:
{{quote|On September 29, I noticed that DI had posted a transcript of an interview I had done—except that I hadn't done it. The transcript was fake. Apparently meant (though not marked) as a parody, the organization whose self-described goal is "to support high quality scholarship [...] relevant to the question of evidence for intelligent design in nature" ridiculed me by, among other things, having fictitious radio host "Marvin Waldburger" refer to me as "Dr. Barking Forrest Ph.D." If DI thought this would unsettle me, they were ignoring the fact that I had just been through two killer hurricanes. I could only shake my head at their doing something so jaw-droppingly stupid. If they were hoping Judge Jones would see and be influenced by this silliness, it was just another sign of the disrespect for his intelligence and integrity that began before the trial and continues today.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Forrest, [http://www.csicop.org/intelligentdesignwatch/kitzmiller.html The "Vise Strategy" Undone] (accessed 2009 April 21).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During her testimony the defense lawyers again asked the court to exclude Forrest from testifying as expert witness. Judge Jones allowed them to present their case for dismissing her and then denied their request. Forrest would go on to testify on the religious origins and nature of the intelligent design movement, the [[wedge document]], and also demonstrated that the drafts of the textbook at the center of the court case, ''[[Of Pandas and People]]'', substituted terms such as "intelligent design" and "intelligent designer" in place of "creationism" and "creator" in an attempt to circumvent the ruling in the [[Edwards v. Aguillard]] which determined that teaching creationism in public schools violated the [[Establishment Clause]] of the United States constitution. Her testimony had a significant impact on Judge Jones's decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pamd.uscourts.gov/kitzmiller/kitzmiller_342.pdf Decision] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116080036/http://www.pamd.uscourts.gov/kitzmiller/kitzmiller_342.pdf |date=January 16, 2013 }}, [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A year after the ruling, Forrest commented in a telephone interview "It was very clear to everyone who followed the case that intelligent design is not science. The Discovery Institute has been trying for years to foment a court case. And they finally got one dropped in their laps and what was ironic is they didn't want it. They knew what this case would do to them."&lt;ref&gt;Forrest quoted by Christina Kauffman, [http://www.yorkdispatch.com/local/ci_4872535 Behind the bench with the intelligent design judge, one year later,] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301063227/http://www.yorkdispatch.com/local/ci_4872535 |date=March 1, 2007 }} ''[[The York Dispatch]]'' (accessed 2009 April 21).&lt;/ref&gt;

An essay by Forrest, "The non-epistemology of intelligent design: its implications for public policy", was published online in March 2009 as part of a special issue of the journal ''[[Synthese]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Barbara |last=Forrest |title=The non-epistemology of intelligent design: its implications for public policy |journal=[[Synthese]] |volume=178 |issue=2 |pages=331–379 |date=January 2011 |doi=10.1007/s11229-009-9539-3 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-009-9539-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was titled "Evolution and Its Rivals" and was guest edited by [[Glenn Branch]] and [[James H. Fetzer]], the latter a former editor of ''Synthese''.  Forrest's essay strongly criticized philosopher [[Francis J. Beckwith]], noting that he had "no formal credentials as a constitutional scholar" to justify his stances on issues regarding the [[separation of church and state]] and connected Beckwith and other advocates of intelligent design to [[Christian Reconstructionism]]. Following complaints from Beckwith and others mentioned in the issue, the regular editors of ''Synthese'', [[Johan van Benthem (logician)|Johan van Benthem]], [[Vincent F. Hendricks]], and [[John F. Symons]], included an editorial statement in the print version of the special issue, published in January 2011, which criticized the tone of some of the papers in that issue. The note was perceived as directed at Forrest's essay and drew angry denunciations from the guest editors, who were not consulted about the statement, and other critics.  At least one philosopher has withdrawn a paper from ''Synthese'' as a result.&lt;ref name="Oppenheimer"&gt;{{cite news|last=Oppenheimer|first=Mark|title=BELIEFS; Debate Over Intelligent Design Ensnares a Journal|work=The New York Times|page=20|date=14 May 2011|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/14/us/14beliefs.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Louisiana Science Education Act===

Forrest worked with [[Zack Kopplin]] and helped begin the campaign to repeal the [[Louisiana Science Education Act]] law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://io9.com/5976112/how-19+year+old-activist-zack-kopplin-is-making-life-hell-for-louisianas-creationists |title=How 19-year-old activist Zack Kopplin is making life hell for Louisiana's creationists |first=George|last=Dvorsky|date=January 15, 2013 | work=io9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The repeal effort, SB70 of 2011, failed in the Senate Education Committee by a 5-1 vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/news/2011/05/repeal-effort-fails-committee-006685 |date=26 May 2011 |title=Repeal effort fails in committee |publisher=National Center for Science Education }}&lt;/ref&gt; The repeal effort, SB374 of 2012, also failed in the Senate Education Committee by a 2-1 effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Repeal effort fails in Louisiana |date=20 April 2012 |publisher=National Center for Science Education |url=http://ncse.com/news/2012/04/repeal-effort-fails-louisiana-007311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Black Power: The Politics of Liberation''''' is a 1967 book co-authored by [[Stokely Carmichael]] (later known as Kwame Ture) and political scientist [[Charles V. Hamilton]]. The work defines [[Black Power]], presents insights into the roots of [[racism in the United States]] and means of reforming the traditional political process for the future.  Published originally as ''Black Power: The Politics of Liberation in America'', the book has become a staple work produced during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and [[Black Power movement]].&lt;ref name="Ture"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stokely Carmichael|first1=Charles V. Hamilton|title=Black Power: The Politics of Liberation|date=1967|publisher=A Division of Random House Inc.,}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main focuses of the book is describing the struggles that black communities faced with trying to get involved in politics.  Black people faced severe and violent discrimination in the 1950s, as well as [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]]. Consequently, the community faced problems with political participation as the community faced material consequences of systemic racism when attempting to vote or engaging with the political world.  Carmichael and Hamilton cite [[white supremacy]], [[colonialism]], and the systemic continuation of said dynamics as drivers of disenfranchisement and racism.&lt;ref name="Ture"/&gt;

These issues led to the creation of certain groups and organizations.  For instance, the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) attempted to build organizational capacity within the Southern black community, offering a progressive alternative to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in Mississippi that would adopt the national party's platform (see [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]]).  By creating regional campaigns and running black candidates, SNCC saw success within their own community.  However, with the limited power that this and other organizations held, their efforts to engage in the political arena for the black community were often not fully realized.&lt;ref&gt;Black Power: The Politics of Liberation. pg. 101-103.&lt;/ref&gt; This led the authors to reconceptualize Black Power as a tool for confronting the totality of oppression, not exclusively that of political representation.

Carmichael and Hamilton continue to write about the ways that black communities' attempts to be active in politics have been thwarted by self-serving groups who offer shallow allyship.&lt;ref&gt;Black Power: The Politics of Liberation. pg. 58-84.&lt;/ref&gt;  Criticizing labor movements, liberals, and the middle class for being complacent in systemic racism, Black Power challenges coalitions to genuinely serve the anti-racism and the needs of the black community. Carmichael and Hamilton state, "We do not believe it is possible to form meaningful coalitions unless both or all parties are not only willing but believe it absolutely necessary to challenge [white supremacy] and other prevailing norms and institutions".&lt;ref&gt;Black Power: The Politics of Liberation. pg. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carmichael and Hamilton write that Black Power meant more than simply changing the physical, material conditions of inequality faced by black Americans; it also meant changing perspectives of race relations in a historical context, both inside and outside the community. The authors believe Black Power not only rests in dismantling white supremacy, but also in establishing camaraderie within the black community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://s-usih.org/2013/11/black-power-and-stokely-carmichaels-defining-of-ideology-in-1967.html#_ftn2|title=“Black Power” and Stokely Carmichael’s Defining of Ideology in 1967|last=Greene II|first=Robert|date=3 Nov 2013|website=s-usih.org|publisher=Society for U.S. Intellectual History|access-date=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, Black Power disavows the legitimacy of liberal, conformist politics, and instead seeks a degree of sovereignty for black community.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4770">'''Brahma [[muhurta]]''' (time of [[Brahma]]) is a period (muhurta) one and a half hours before sunrise or more precisely 1Hr 36 Mins before sunrise. (i.e. 96 Minutes = 2 Muhūrta or 4 Ghaṭīkā.) Literally meaning "The Creator's Hour", it is traditionally the penultimate phase or muhurta of the night and is considered an auspicious time for all practices of yoga and most appropriate for
[[meditation]], worship or any other religious practice.
Each muhurta lasts 48 minutes, and therefore the Brahma muhurta begins 1 hour and 36 minutes before sunrise, and ends 48 minutes before sunrise. The time of sunrise varies each day, according to geographic location and time of year, thus the time of the Brahma muhurta also varies. For example, if sunrise is at 6am, the brahma muhurta begins at 4:24am. If sunrise is at 7am, brahma muhurta begins at 5:24am, and so on. &lt;ref&gt;http://nitaaiveda.com/NITAAI_Yoga_Forums/Swami%27s_Writings_and_Articles/Brahma-Muhurta_-_The_48_mins_from_1_hr_36_min_to_48_min_before_Sunrise.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Brahmamuhurta: The best time for meditation

Sri Thirumalai Krishnamacharya (S. T. K.)stated "Think of God. If not God, the sun, if not the sun, your parents."&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=JeoDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA167&amp;lpg=PA167&amp;dq=Think+of+god+if+not+god+the+sun+if+not+the+sun+your+parents&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pGWo3xXj4n&amp;sig=HSWibQnWLYqmMrubggjBA3_t6ys&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAWoVChMI5IWp3aaGxgIVRBqMCh2l5wBo#v=onepage&amp;q=Think%20of%20god%20if%20not%20god%20the%20sun%20if%20not%20the%20sun%20your%20parents&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; S. T. K. identified himself with Vaishnavism(worship of Vishnu), as did Annanta, under the guidance of Shiva, who is the first yogi.&lt;ref name="Maehle, G"&gt;Maehle, G.&lt;/ref&gt; A modern Yogi would then show reverence to the sun.

In the Kali Yuga, divinity can still be reached through yoga, but because of the agitated mind associated with the Yuga, Yoga must be practiced through Kriya, based on asana.&lt;ref name="Maehle, G"/&gt; It is therefore common for modern yogis whose lineage can be traced to S. T. K. to practice the Suryanamaskara (Sun Salutation) in the morning. The Sun Salutation can be used in ritual cleansing practice that uses the mind states associated with Vata in Ayurveda. These mind states are mentioned in Patanjali's Yoga sutras &lt;ref&gt;Maehle,G.&lt;/ref&gt; These qualities are nearer to the divine, as they pertain to stillness of the mind, which allows for the spirit to shine. It's because of the inherently stiller state of mind in Brahmamuhurtha, that meditative states can be more easily achieved.&lt;ref name="Maehle, G"/&gt;

== Importance of waking up in Brahma Muhurta ==
Ayurveda states that there are three doshas found in the human physical body, called Vata (Air and Ether), Pitta (Fire and Water) and Kapha (Earth and Water). The increase or decrease of these three doshas is related to the cycles of time. From sunrise until 10:00am is the time of Kapha; from 10:00am until 2:00pm is Pitta time; and from 2:00pm until sunset (6:00pm) is the time of Vata.

The evening follows a similar pattern, from 6:00pm until 10:00pm is the time of Kapha, from 10:00pm until 2:00am is the time of Pitta, and from 2:00am until 6:00am (sunrise) is Vata time.
Brahmamuhurtha occurs during the Vata phase of the morning, between 2:00am and 6:00am, and Yoga masters state that the best time to meditate is one and a half hours before dawn, because the mind is inherently still at that time, enabling one to achieve a deeper meditative state.&lt;ref&gt;Lad, Vasant.

'''CD3WD''' was a project that focused on assisting in third world development by making technical documents and other relevant information easily available to all people. Created by Alex Weir in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weir|first1=Alex|title=Australia slashing aid budget can greatly help Third World|url=https://alexweir1949.wordpress.com/2013/09/30/australia-slashing-aid-budget-can-greatly-help-third-world/|website=alexweir1949.wordpress.com|accessdate=15 May 2016|date=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the concept was to share useful [[DIY]] guides and technical information for free using [[CD]]s. The name CD3WD comes from "CD for the Third World Development". In later versions of the project the archive was distributed on [[DVD]]. The last version that is available online (the 2012 version) was a total of 6 DVDs (core set) and 32 DVDs of extra educational content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CD3WD Directory Listing|url=http://www.fastspeedtest.net/mirrors/cd3wd/|website=www.fastspeedtest.net|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content of the project==
CD3WD gathered a massive free electronic library of largely donor-generated information on agriculture, forestry, fisheries, food processing, engineering, appropriate technology, water and sanitation, education, health, etc. This information came mostly from [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] and [[governmental agencies]].  The information was structured into topics and was the 6-DVD core set. The main language of the project was English but there were also parts in other languages. The core set was available from the project's webpage and by DVDs sent by mail.

The project also had an educational extra part of 32 DVDs with educational content from sources like [[Khan Academy]], [[Wikipedia for Schools]] and [[Project Gutenberg]]. This part of the project was limited to DVDs sent by mail because most of the content was easy to find online.

==Survivalists' interest==
CD3WD was focused on gathering and spreading information to assist third world development,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Want to reboot civilization? What you’ll need - The Boston Globe|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2014/04/19/want-reboot-civilization-what-you-need/fReMGOEq2ZkgZ8WPu3xLCL/story.html|accessdate=16 May 2016|work=BostonGlobe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the project got much of its attention from [[survivalists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rebuilding Civilization With Cd3wd|url=http://afterthelastday.com/2013/09/06/rebuilding-civilization-cd3wd/|website=After The Last Day|accessdate=16 May 2016|date=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CD3WD - Listen to Alex Weir from CD3WD.com on the Prepper Podcast tonight. - American Preppers Network|url=http://americanpreppersnetwork.com/2010/12/listen-to-alex-weir-from-wwwcd3wdcom-on.html|website=American Preppers Network|accessdate=16 May 2016|language=en-US|date=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drager|first1=Dave|title=CD3WD Archives the Information Necessary to Rebuild Society|url=http://lifehacker.com/5765617/cd3wd-archives-the-information-necessary-to-rebuild-society|website=Lifehacker|accessdate=16 May 2016|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The information in the archive handled a widespread area of practical topics relevant to [[preppers]]. This, the structure, and the offline nature of the CD3WD archive made it ideal for survivalists. In 2013 author [[Annalee Newitz]] wrote about humans surviving a global extinction event, saying, "If we're lucky, the hangers-on will have access to a repository of human knowledge called the CD3WD database."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newitz|first1=Annalee|title=Scatter, adapt, and remember : how humans will survive a mass extinction|date=2013|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York|isbn=0385535910|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The discontinuation of the project==
After the death of Alex Weir in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A memorial Library|url=http://www.cd3wd.info/about.html|website=A CD for third world development ... cd3wd ...|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the project stopped and the project domain "cd3wd.com" was taken over. It is no longer connected to the project. There is still a mirror page of the 2006 version of the website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CD3WD Mirror version 4 (2006)|url=http://www.fastonline.org/CD3WD_40/CD3WD/INDEX.HTM|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a torrent of the 2012 version of the project's DVDs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CD3WD Directory Listing|url=http://www.fastspeedtest.net/mirrors/cd3wd/|website=www.fastspeedtest.net|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was available online.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5085">The '''climate gap''' refers to a body of data indicating disparities in how climate change impacts various racial, ethnic and [[socioeconomic]] groups in the United States. The data show that low [[socioeconomic status]] groups and racial and ethnic minorities will experience more negative health and economic impacts from the results of climate change than other populations in the United States. This term, climate gap, was first used in the May 2009 report, “The Climate Gap: Inequalities in How Climate Change Hurts Americans &amp; How to Close the Gap”,&lt;ref&gt;http://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/242/docs/The_Climate_Gap_Full_Report_FINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/greenspace/2009/05/global-warming-hurts-poor-people-more.html&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in a concurrent paper published in the journal, ''Environmental Justice'', by Seth B. Shonkoff, Rachel Morello-Frosch and colleagues entitled, "Minding the Climate Gap: Implications of Environmental Health Inequities for Mitigation Policies in California".&lt;ref&gt;Shonkoff SB, Morello-Frosch R, Pastor M, Sadd J. 2009. "Minding the Climate Gap: Implications of Environmental Health Inequities for Mitigation Policies" in ''California Environmental Justice'' '''2'''(4): 173-177.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
'''Disparate health impacts of climate change'''&lt;br /&gt;
Extreme weather events, such as heat waves, droughts and floods, are expected to increase in their frequency and intensity in the next hundred years due to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-spm.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Low socioeconomic status groups and racial and ethnic minorities are affected by heat-related illness at greater rates due to factors such as lack of access to air conditioning, lack of transportation, occupations that require outdoor work and the heat-island effect in urban neighborhoods.

Higher temperatures resulting from climate change will also increase chemical interactions between nitrogen oxide, volatile organic gases and sunlight, leading to increased concentrations of ambient ozone in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/2007GL031101.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Along with particulate matter, ozone is a primary cause of air pollution-related health effects. Low socioeconomic status groups and racial and ethnic minorities in the United States are more likely to live in areas with dangerous levels of air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://college.usc.edu/geography/ESPE/documents/justice_in_the_air_web.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829091603/http://college.usc.edu/geography/ESPE/documents/justice_in_the_air_web.pdf |archivedate=2009-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This pollution will be exacerbated by climate change, and low socioeconomic status groups and racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to lack health insurance,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rprogress.org/publications/2006/CARB_Full_0306.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; making them increasingly vulnerable to these elevated levels of air pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;Shonkoff SB, Morello-Frosch R, Pastor M, Sadd J. 2009. Environmental Health and Equity Impacts from Climate Change and Mitigation Policies in California: A Review of the Literature. Publication # CEC-500-2009-038-D. Available at: http://www.climatechange.ca.gov/publications/cat/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;  

'''Disparate economic impacts of climate change'''&lt;br /&gt;
The proportion of income that low socioeconomic status groups spend on basic necessities such as food, water and energy is already greater than the proportion spent by other populations and is expected to increase as the cost of these necessities increases due to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics). 2002. Consumer expenditure
survey. Washington D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, job sectors that employ predominantly low socioeconomic status groups and racial and ethnic minorities such as the agriculture and tourism industries are projected to experience the most dramatic shifts due to climate change, reducing employment opportunities for these populations.&lt;ref&gt;EDD (California Employment Development Department). 2004. Occupational Employment (2002) and Wage (2003) Data, Occupational Employment Statistics Survey Results. Sacramento, California.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, due to the lack of access to insurance and emergency credit, less savings, fewer personal resources and disproportionate hardships from previous economic stress, low socioeconomic status groups and racial and ethnic minorities are likely to suffer the most pronounced and long-lasting economic impacts from climate change-related extreme weather events such as hurricanes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/0/6/9/9/pages106994/p106994-1.php&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4015">[[File:IndependenceTemple2.jpg|thumb|255px|right|Community of Christ Temple in Independence, Missouri, USA. Dedicated 1994.]]
The '''Daily Prayer for Peace''' is a spiritual discipline unique to the [[Community of Christ]] and practiced at the [[Independence Temple]] in the church's headquarters campus in [[Independence, Missouri]]. It falls within the most common category of [[Christian prayer]] known as [[supplication]]. 

Each day of the year at 1 p.m. [[Central Time zone|Central Standard Time/Central Daylight Time]] a Daily Prayer for Peace is held as part of a brief worship for that purpose held in the sanctuary of the Independence Temple. The sanctuary is open to the public as members lead a brief worship service that includes the Daily Prayer for Peace. The form of the prayer is a public spoken prayer, usually written by one of the members from somewhere in the world and read aloud either by that member or another person. Each day of the year, the Daily Prayer for Peace is focused on the needs of a different nation of the world. The supplicant prays aloud for peace under the 150-foot dome of the temple spire.

Those living in or visiting Independence, Mo. are encouraged to stop in to participate in this worship experience, and those elsewhere around the globe are encouraged to pause for a moment of silent prayer.

==Background==
At the 1984 [[World Conference (Community of Christ)|World Conference]] of the Community of Christ, its President, [[Wallace B. Smith]], called for the construction of the Independence Temple and its dedication "to the pursuit of peace."

A committee formed to consider the worship ministries to be held in the new temple, devised the idea of a Daily Prayer for Peace to act as a witness of Christ's peace and a "symbol of the Church's unrelenting pursuit of peace." 

The Daily Prayer for Peace has been held daily in the Independence Temple since December 1993. It is one of many practices, including the [[Community of Christ International Peace Award]] that distinguish the denomination and its members.

Prior to 9 April 2007 the Daily Prayer for Peace was held at 12:30 p.m. Central Standard Time/Central Daylight Time. With the change in time those working at Community of Christ International Headquarters are encouraged to pause and attend this service.

Since 26 October 2007 each Friday at Noon Eastern Time the Daily Prayer for Peace service is celebrated at the Kirtland Temple Complex as the Friday Prayer for Peace. Starting in May 2008 it started being celebrated daily in both Independence and Kirtland.

==Order of service==
The committee developed a standard order of service which is normally followed: Gathering in Silence, Call to Prayer, Lighting of Candle, Invitation, Scripture Reading, Prayer for Peace, Prayers of the People, Hymn, Benediction and Postlude. 

==Prayer topics==
In order to ensure a truly global reach for the prayers, a different country is named each day as a  focus  of prayer. The schedule can be seen on the Community of Christ website http://www.cofchrist.org/prayerpeace/. This schedule reflects the ecumenical prayer cycle of the World Council of Churches, which lists  a nation or series of nations for each week of the year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7319">'''Distributed manufacturing''' also known as '''distributed production''', '''cloud producing''' and '''local manufacturing''' is a form of decentralized manufacturing practiced by enterprises using a network of geographically dispersed manufacturing facilities that are coordinated using [[information technology]]. It can also refer to local manufacture via the historic [[cottage industry]] model, or manufacturing that takes place in the homes of consumers.

==Consumer==
Within the [[maker movement]] and [[DIY]] culture, small scale production by consumers often using [[peer to peer]] resources is being referred to as distributed manufacturing. Consumers download digital designs from an [[open design]] repository website like [[Youmagine]] or [[Thingiverse]] and produce a product for low costs through a distributed network of 3D printing services such as [[3D Hubs]] or at home with an [[open-source 3-D printer]] such as the [[RepRap]].&lt;ref&gt;Sells, Ed, Zach Smith, Sebastien Bailard, Adrian Bowyer, and Vik Olliver. "Reprap: the replicating rapid prototyper: maximizing customizability by breeding the means of production." HANDBOOK OF RESEARCH IN MASS CUSTOMIZATION AND PERSONALIZATION, (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, R., Haufe, P., Sells, E., Iravani, P., Olliver, V., Palmer, C., &amp; Bowyer, A. (2011). Reprap??? the replicating rapid prototyper. Robotica, 29(1), 177-191.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Enterprise==
The primary attribute of distributed manufacturing is the ability to create value at geographically dispersed locations via manufacturing. For example, [[shipping]] costs could be minimized when products are built geographically close to their intended markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Durach|first=Christian F.|last2=Kurpjuweit|first2=Stefan|last3=Wagner|first3=Stephan M.|date=2017-09-25|title=The impact of additive manufacturing on supply chains|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/10.1108/IJPDLM-11-2016-0332|journal=International Journal of Physical Distribution &amp; Logistics Management|volume=47|issue=10|pages=954–971|doi=10.1108/ijpdlm-11-2016-0332|issn=0960-0035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, products manufactured in a number of small facilities distributed over a wide area can be customized with details adapted to individual or regional tastes. Manufacturing components in different physical locations and then managing the supply chain to bring them together for final assembly of a product is also considered a form of distributed manufacturing.&lt;ref name=Chrisman&gt;{{cite web|last=Chrisman|first=Ray|title=Enhancement of Distributed Manufacturing using expanded Process Intensification Concepts|url=http://depts.washington.edu/cpac/Activities/Meetings/Satellite/2010/Wednesday/Chrisman_The%20Value%20of%20Distributed%20Manufacturing.pdf|publisher=University of Washington|accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kühnle2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hermann Kühnle|title=Distributed Manufacturing: Paradigm, Concepts, Solutions and Examples|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9AnmyB1Gs-0C|accessdate=7 May 2013|year=2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-84882-707-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital networks combined with additive manufacturing allow companies a decentralized and geographically independent distributed production ([[Cloud manufacturing]]).&lt;ref name="Bopp2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Felix Bopp|title=Future Business Models by Additive Manufacturing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M_SmmUOwsWwC|accessdate=4 July 2014|year=2010|publisher=Verlag|isbn=3836685086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the advantages of scale rest on cheap global transportation,  the economies of scope share infrastructure costs (intangible and tangible productive resources), taking advantage of the capabilities of the fabrication tools.&lt;ref name="triple-c.at"/&gt; And following [[Neil Gershenfeld]]&lt;ref&gt;Gershenfeld, Neil (2007): ''FAB: The Coming Revolution on your Desktop: From Personal Computers to Personal Fabrication''. Cambridge: Basic Books, p. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt; in that “some of the least developed parts of the world need some of the most advanced technologies”, commons-based peer production and distributed manufacturing may offer the necessary tools for thinking globally but act locally in response to certain problems and needs. This can take the most radical form --individual personal manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;Mota, C., 2011, November. The rise of personal fabrication.

[[Zen]] has a rich doctrinal background, despite the traditional Zen narrative which states that it is a "special transmission outside scriptures" which "did not stand upon words."{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A|p=85-94}}

==Polarities==
Classical Chinese Chán is characterised by a set of polarities:{{sfn|McRae|2003|pp=138–142}} absolute-relative,&lt;ref name="Liang-Chieh 1986 9"&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Liang-Chieh|1986|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddha-nature - sunyata,{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|pp=26–29}} sudden and gradual enlightenment,{{sfn|McRae|2003|pp=123–138}} esoteric and exoteric transmission.{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=9}}

===Absolute-relative===
The [[Prajnaparamita|Prajnaparamita-sutras]]  and [[Madhyamaka]] emphasized the non-duality of form and emptiness: "form is emptiness, emptiness is form", as the [[heart sutra]] says.&lt;ref name="Liang-Chieh 1986 9"/&gt; 
This was understood to mean that ultimate reality is not a transcendental realm, but equal to the daily world of relative reality. This idea fitted into the Chinese culture, which emphasized the mundane world and society. But this does not tell how the absolute is present in the relative world:
{{quote|To deny the duality of samsara and nirvana, as the Perfection of Wisdom does, or to demonstrate logically the error of dichotomizing conceptualization, as Nagarjuna does, is not to address the question of the relationship between samsara and nirvana -or, in more philosophical terms, between phenomenal and ultimate reality [...] What, then, is the relationship between these two realms?&lt;ref name="Liang-Chieh 1986 9"/&gt;}}
This question is answered in such schemata as [[Five Ranks|the Five Ranks of Tozan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Kasulis|2003|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Ten Bulls|Oxherding Pictures]], and [[Hakuin#Four ways of knowing|Hakuin's Four ways of knowing]].{{sfn|Low|2006}}

The [[Madhyamaka|Madhyamaka-scheme]] of the [[Two Truths doctrine]], and the [[Yogacara|Yogacara-schemes]] of the [[Three natures|Three Natures]] and the [[Trikaya|Trikaya-doctrine]], also give depictions of the interplay between the absolute and the relative.

===Buddha-nature and sunyata===
When Buddhism was introduced in China it was understood in terms of its own culture. Various sects struggled to attain an understanding of the Indian texts. The [[Tathāgatagarbha Sutras]] and the idea of the [[Buddha-nature]] were endorsed, because of the perceived similarities with the [[Tao]], which was understood as a transcendental reality underlying the world of appearances. [[Sunyata]] at first was understood as pointing to the Taoist [[Mu (negative)|"wu"]], ''nothingness''.{{sfn|Lai|Year unknown}}{{sfn|Swanson|1993|p=373}}

The doctrine of the Buddha-nature asserts that all [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]] have [[Buddha-nature]] (Skt. ''Buddhadhātu'', "Buddha Element", "Buddha-Principle"), the element from which awakening springs. The [[Tathāgatagarbha Sutras]] (literally: the womb of the thus-gone) state that every living being has the potential to realize awakening.{{sfn|Wayman|1990}} Hence Buddhism offers salvation to every-one, not only to monks or those who have freed themselves almost completely from karma in previous lives.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} The  [[Yogacara]] theory of the [[Eight Consciousnesses]] explains how sensory input and the mind create the world we experience, and obscure the alaya-vijnana, which is equated to the Buddha-nature.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992}}

When this potential is realized, and the defilements have been eliminated, the tathagatagarbha manifests as the [[Dharmakaya]], the absolute reality which pervades everything in the world.{{sfn|Wayman|1990}} In this way, it is also the primordial reality from which phenomenal reality springs. When this understanding is idealized, it becomes a transcendental reality beneath the world of appearances.{{sfn|Kalupahan|1994}}

Sunyata points to the "emptiness" or no-"thing"-ness of all "things". Though we perceive a world of concrete and discrete objects, designated by names, on close analysis the "thingness" dissolves, leaving them "empty" of inherent existence.{{sfn|Kalupahan|1994|p=160-169}} The [[Heart sutra]], a text from the [[Prajnaparamita|prajnaparamita-sutras]], articulates this in the following saying in which the [[Skandha|five skandhas]] are said to be "empty":
{{quote|"Oh, Sariputra, Form Does not Differ From the Void,&lt;br/&gt;
And the Void Does Not Differ From Form.&lt;br/&gt;
Form is Void and Void is Form;&lt;br/&gt;
The Same is True For Feelings,&lt;br/&gt;
Perceptions, Volitions and Consciousness".&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/heartstr.htm The Heart Sutra Prajna Paramita Hrydaya Sutra]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The teachings on the five skandhas belong to the central teachings in the [[Tripitaka]]. They form a subdivision of the [[Samyutta Nikaya#Divisions|Samyutta Nikaya]]. The five skandhas are also mentioned in the Lankavatara-sutra:
{{quote|The [[Citta]] dances like a dancer; [[Manas (early Buddhism)|the Manas]] resembles a jester; the [[Manas-vijnana|[Mano-]vijnana]] together with the [[Eight Consciousnesses|five [Vijnanas]]] creates an objective world which is like a stage.&lt;ref group=web name=Lanka&gt;[http://lirs.ru/do/lanka_eng/lanka-nondiacritical.htm Lankavatara Sutra, chapter LXXXII, p.192 Suzuki-translation, p.223/224 in brackets]&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|The influence of these teachings can be seen in the sayings of Mazu:&lt;br/&gt;
Master Liang visited Ma-tsu.&lt;br/&gt;
Ma-tsu said: I heard that the master is great at explaining the sutras and sastras, is that so?&lt;br/&gt;
Liang said: Indeed&lt;br/&gt;
Ma-tsu said: With what do you explain?&lt;br/&gt;
Liang said: I explain with the mind&lt;br/&gt;
Ma-tsu said: The mind is like an artist and consciousness is [like] his helper, how can you explain the teachings with that?{{sfn|Lievens|1981|p=§19, p.105-106 }}}}}}

The [[Yogacara]] explains this "emptiness" in an analysis of the way we perceive "things". Everything we conceive of is the result of the working of the [[Skandha|five skandhas]]—results of perception, feeling, volition, and discrimination.{{refn|group=note|Translations do differ, which makes a difference. [[Vijñāna]] can be translated as "consciousness", but also as "discernment".{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992}}}} The five skandhas together compose consciousness. The "things" we are conscious of are "mere concepts", not ''[[Noumenon|Ding an sich]]''.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992}}

It took [[Chinese Buddhism]] several centuries to recognize that [[sunyata]] does not refer to "wu", ''nothingness'',{{sfn|Lai|Year unknown}}{{sfn|Swanson|1993}} nor does Buddhism postulate an undying soul.{{sfn|Lai|Year unknown}} The influence of those various doctrinal and textual backgrounds is still discernible in Zen. Zen teachers still refer to Buddha-nature, but the Zen tradition also emphasizes that Buddha-nature ''is'' sunyata, the absence of an independent and substantial self.{{sfn|Lai|Year unknown}}

===Sudden and gradual enlightenment===
[[File:Kano White-robed Kannon, Bodhisattva of Compassion.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Avalokiteśvara]] Bodhisattva sitting in meditation]]

In Zen Buddhism two main views on the way to enlightenment are discernible, namely [[Subitism|sudden]] and gradual enlightenment.

Early Chán recognized the ''"transcendence of the body and mind"'', followed by ''"non-defilement [of] knowledge and perception"'', meaning [[Kensho|sudden insight into the true nature]] followed by gradual purification of intentions.{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=88-92}}

In the 8th-century the Ch'an-history was effectively re-fashioned by [[Shenhui]], who created a dichotomy between the so-called [[East Mountain Teaching|"Northern School"]], led by [[Yuquan Shenxiu]], and his own line of teaching, which he called the "Southern school".{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=54-56}} Shenhui placed [[Hui-neng]] into prominence as the sixth Chán-patriarch, and emphasized ''sudden enlightenment'', as opposed to the concurrent Northern School's alleged ''gradual enlightenment''.{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=54-56}} According to the ''sudden enlightenment'' propagated by Shenhui insight into true nature is sudden; thereafter there can be no misunderstanding anymore about this true nature.

In the [[Platform Sutra]] the dichotomy between sudden and gradual is reconciled.{{sfn|MacRae|2003|p=60-67}} [[Guifeng Zongmi]], fifth-generation successor to Shenhui, also softened the edge between sudden and gradual. In his analysis, sudden awakening points to seeing into one's true nature, but is to be followed by a gradual cultivation to attain [[Buddhahood]].{{sfn|Gregory|1991}}

[[Jinul|Chinul]], a 12th-century Korean Seon master, followed Zongmi, and also emphasized that insight into our true nature is sudden, but is to be followed by practice to ripen the insight and attain full Buddhahood. This is also the standpoint of the contemporary [[Sanbo Kyodan]], according to whom kensho is at the start of the path to full  enlightenment.{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}}

This gradual cultivation is also recognized by [[Tozan]], who described the [[Five Ranks|Five ranks of enlightenment]].&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.nl/2008/02/tozan-ryokais-verses-on-five-ranks.html The Five Ranks of Tozan]&lt;/ref&gt; Other example of depiction of stages on the path are the [[Ten Bulls|Ten Ox-Herding Pictures]] which detail the steps on the Path, [[Linji Yixuan#Expressing the inexpressible|The Three mysterious Gates]] of Linji, and the [[Hakuin#Four ways of knowing|Four Ways of Knowing]] of [[Hakuin]].{{sfn|Low|2006}} This gradual cultivation is described by Chan Master Sheng Yen as follows:
{{quote|Ch'an expressions refer to enlightenment as "seeing your self-nature". But even this is not enough. After seeing your self-nature, you need to deepen your experience even further and bring it into maturation. You should have enlightenment experience again and again and support them with continuous practice. Even though Ch'an says that at the time of enlightenment, your outlook is the same as of the Buddha, you are not yet a [[Buddhahood|full Buddha]].{{sfn|Yen|2006|p=54)}}}}

The emphasis which Shenhui placed on [[Subitism|sudden enlightenment]], also reflected a growing appreciation of the [[Diamond Sutra]] in 8th-century Chinese Buddhism.{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=62}}{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|pp=26–28}} The Lankavatara-sutra, which endorses the Buddha-nature, emphasized purity of mind, which can be attained in gradations. The Diamond-sutra emphasizes sunyata, which "must be realized  totally or not at all".{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|pp=26–28}}

Once the dichotomy between sudden and gradual was in place, it defined its own logic and rhetorics, which are also recognizable in the distinction between Caodong (Soto) and Lin-ji (Rinzai) chán.{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=123}} But it also leads to a "sometimes bitter and always prolix sectarian controversy between later Chán and [[Huayan school|Hua-yen]] exegetes".{{sfn|Buswell|1993|p=234}} In the [[Huayan school#Classification of Buddhist teachings|Huayan classification of teachings]], the sudden approach was regarded inferior to the Perfect Teaching of Hua-yen. [[Guifeng Zongmi]], fifth patriarch of Hua-yen ànd Chán-master, devised his [[Guifeng Zongmi#The Buddha's Teachings|own classification]] to counter this subordination.{{sfn|Gregory|1991}} To establish the superiority of the Chán-teachings, Chinul explained the sudden approach as not pointing to mere emptiness, but to ''suchness'' or the [[dharmadhatu]].{{sfn|Buswell|1991|p=240-241}}

===Esoteric and exoteric transmission===
According to Borup the emphasis on 'mind to mind transmission' is a form of esoteric transmission, in which "the tradition and the enlightened mind is transmitted face to face".{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=9}} Metaphorically this can be described as the transmission from a flame from one candle to another candle,{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=9}} or the transmission from one vein to another.{{sfn|Faure|2000|p=58}} In exoteric transmission requires "direct access to the teaching through a personal discovery of one's self. This type of transmission and identification is symbolized by the discovery of a shining lantern, or a mirror."{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=9}}

This polarity is recognizable in the emphasis that the Zen-tradition puts on maintaining the correct [[Dharma transmission]], while simultaneously stressing seeing into one's nature:
{{quote|The matter of learning from a teacher is most essential. People of old who arrived at the source of [[Kensho|seeing nature]], passed through many barriers clearly and completely without a dot of doubt, and traveled freely through the world opening big mouths in discussion, only came to know the transcendental message of Zen after they finally ran into Zen masters of great vision. Then they sincerely sought certainty and wound up with the duty of the teacher's succession, bearing the debt of Dharma, never to forget it for a moment. This is called dharma succession. Since ancient times the designated succession of the ancestral teachers has always been like this.{{sfn|Torei|2010|p=88}}{{refn|group=note|The modern framing of Zen as the ''experience'' of 'ultimate truth' or reality{{sfn|Sharf|2005-B}} may influence the institutional shape western Zen is going to take, where individual freedom is highly appraised. See also Bodiford 2008, pp 277-279}}}}

Nevertheless, while the Zen tradition has always stressed the importance of formal Dharma transmission, there are well known examples of [[Mushi dokugo]], such as [[Nōnin]], [[Jinul]] and [[Suzuki Shōsan]] who attained awakening on their own, though all of them were familiair with the Zen-teachings.

==The Bodhisattva ideal==
{{main article|Bodhisattva}}

An important, though easily overlooked aspect of Zen is the bodhisattva ideal.{{sfn|Batchelor|2004}} It supplements [[kensho]] and insight into the [[Dharmadhatu|absolute]] with [[Karuṇā]], compassion with all sentient beings.{{sfn|Low|2006}} This ideal is reflected in the [[Bodhisattva vow]] and the [[Bodhisattva Precepts]]{{sfn|Anderson|2000}} or [[jukai]].&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenTeachings/Dogen_Teachings/Shobogenzo/083jukai.pdf Dogen, ''On Receiving the Precepts'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of this Bodhisattva-ideal are the [[pāramitā]]s, which are also being mentioned in the Diamond Sutra: 
* [[Dāna]] (generosity, giving of oneself),
* [[Śīla]] (virtue, morality, proper conduct),
* [[Kṣānti]] (patience, tolerance, forbearance, acceptance, endurance),
* [[Vīrya]] (energy, diligence, vigour, effort),
* [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|Dhyāna]] (meditation, tranquility), and
* [[Wisdom in Buddhism|Prajñā]] (wisdom, insight).{{sfn|Wai-tao|1994}}{{refn|group=note|Wai-tao and Goddard re-arranged their translation of the Diamond Sutra topically, using the six paramitas as a framework{{sfn|Aitken|1994}}}}

The Bodhisattva-ideal is a central theme in the prajnaparamita-sutras.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A|p=41}}

Dogen mentions the Bodhisattva-ideal throughout his works.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenTeachings/Dogen_Teachings/Shobogenzo/032kannon.pdf Dogen, Sobogenzo, ''On Kannon, the Bodhisattva of Compassion'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenTeachings/Dogen_Teachings/Shobogenzo/046bodaisattaShishobo.pdf dogen, Shobogenzo, ''On the Four Exemplary Acts of a Bodhisattva'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hakuin]] saw "deep compassion and commitment to help all sentient beings everywhere"{{sfn|Low|2006|p=35}} as an indispensable part of the [[Hakuin#Four ways of knowing|Buddhist path to awakening]]. Hakuin emphasized the need of "post-satori training",{{sfn|Waddell|2010}}{{sfn|Hakuin|2010}} purifying the mind of karmic tendencies and 
{{quote|[W]hipping forward the wheel of the Four Universal Vows, pledging yourself to benefit and save all sentient beings while striving every minute of your life to practice the great Dharma giving.{{sfn|Hakuin|2010}}}}

The insight in the need of arousing [[bodhicitta]] formed Hakuin's final awakening:
{{quote|Wasn't a shaven head and monk's robe the Mind of Enlightenment? Wasn't reciting sutras, mantras, and dharanis the Mind of Enlightenment? [...] [At] my forty-first year, [...] I at long last penetrated into the heart of this great matter. Suddenly, unexpectedly, I saw it — it was as clear as if it were right there in the hollow of my hand. What is the Mind of Enlightenment? It is, I realized, a matter of doing good — benefiting others by giving them the gift of the Dharma teaching.{{sfn|Hakuin|2010}}}}

Buddhas and bodhisattvas such as [[Amitabha|Amitābha]], [[Avalokitesvara|Avalokiteśvara]], [[Manjusri|Mañjuśrī]], [[Samantabhadra]], and [[Ksitigarbha|Kṣitigarbha]] are venerated alongside [[Shakyamuni Buddha|Gautama Buddha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Lathouwers|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|{{sfn|Lathouwers|2000|p=221}} mentions: Blofeld, John (1988), ''Bodhisattva of compassion - the mystical tradition of kuan Yin''. Boston: Shanbhala}}

By repeatedly chanting the {{Nihongo|Avalokiteshvara sutra|観世音菩薩普門品|Kanzeon Bosatsu Fumonbon}} (chapter 25 of the Lotus Sutra&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://zen.rinnou.net/whats_zen/sacred_texts.html#Avalokite%C5%9Bvara%20Sutra Avalokiteśvara Sutra]&lt;/ref&gt;), for example, one instills the Bodhisattva's ideals into one's mind. The ultimate goal is given in the end of the sutra, which states, "In the morning, be one with [[Avalokiteshvara]]; in the evening, be one with Avalokiteshvara". Through the realization of [[Shunyata|emptiness]] and the Mahayana notion that all things have [[Buddha-nature]], one understands that there is no difference between the cosmic bodhisattva and oneself. The wisdom and compassion of the Bodhisattva one is chanting to is seen to equal the inner wisdom and compassion of the practitioner. Thus, the duality between subject and object, practitioner and Bodhisattva, chanter and sutra is ended.

{{evolutionary biology}}
'''Evolutionary capacitance''' is the storage and release of variation, just as electric capacitors store and release charge. Living systems are [[mutational robustness|robust]] to mutations. This means that living systems accumulate [[genetic variation]] without the variation having a [[phenotype|phenotypic]] effect. But when the system is disturbed (perhaps by stress), robustness breaks down, and the variation has phenotypic effects and is subject to the full force of [[natural selection]]. An evolutionary capacitor is a molecular switch mechanism that can "toggle" genetic variation between hidden and revealed states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Masel |first=J |authorlink=Joanna Masel |title=Q&amp;A: Evolutionary capacitance |journal=BMC Biology |date=Sep 30, 2013|volume=11|pages=103 |doi=10.1186/1741-7007-11-103 |pmid=24228631 |pmc=3849687}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If some subset of newly revealed variation is adaptive, it becomes fixed by [[genetic assimilation]]. After that, the rest of variation, most of which is presumably deleterious, can be switched off, leaving the population with a newly evolved advantageous trait, but no long-term handicap. For evolutionary capacitance to increase [[evolvability]] in this way, the switching rate should not be faster than the timescale of genetic assimilation.&lt;ref name="Kim 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kim Y|title=Rate of adaptive peak shifts with partial genetic robustness |journal=Evolution |volume=61 |issue=8 |pages=1847–1856 |year=2007 |pmid=17683428 | doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00166.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This mechanism would allow for rapid [[adaptation]] to new environmental conditions. Switching rates may be a function of stress, making genetic variation more likely to affect the phenotype at times when it is most likely to be useful for adaptation. In addition, strongly deleterious variation may be purged while in a partially cryptic state, so cryptic variation that remains is more likely to be adaptive than random mutations are.&lt;ref name="Masel 2006"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Masel| first=Joanna |authorlink=Joanna Masel | title=Cryptic Genetic Variation Is Enriched for Potential Adaptations| journal=Genetics| volume=172| issue=3| pages=1985–1991| date=March 2006| url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?&amp;artid=1456269| doi=10.1534/genetics.105.051649 | accessdate =| pmid=16387877| pmc=1456269 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Capacitance can help cross "valleys" in the [[fitness landscape]], where a combination of two mutations would be beneficial, even though each is deleterious on its own.&lt;ref name="Kim 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Masel 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trotter|first1=Meredith V.|last2=Weissman|first2=Daniel B.|last3=Peterson|first3=Grant I.|last4=Peck|first4=Kayla M.|last5=Masel |first5=Joanna |authorlink=Joanna Masel |title=Cryptic genetic variation can make "irreducible complexity" a common mode of adaptation in sexual populations|journal=Evolution|date=December 2014|volume=68 |issue=12|pages=3357–3367|doi=10.1111/evo.12517|pmid=25178652|pmc=4258170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is currently no [[scientific consensus|consensus]] about the extent to which capacitance might contribute to evolution in natural populations. The possibility of evolutionary capacitance is considered to be part of the [[extended evolutionary synthesis]].&lt;ref name="Pigliucci 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pigliucci |first1=Massimo |title=Do We Need an Extended Evolutionary Synthesis? |journal=Evolution |volume=61|issue=12 |pages=2743–2749 |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00246.x |pmid=17924956 |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Switches that turn robustness to phenotypic rather than genetic variation on and off do not fit the capacitance analogy, as their presence does not cause variation to accumulate over time. They have instead been called phenotypic stabilizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2009.07.005 |author1=Masel J |author1link=Joanna Masel |author2=Siegal ML |title=Robustness: mechanisms and consequences |journal=Trends in Genetics |volume=25 |issue=9 |pages=395–403 |year=2009 |url=http://www.cell.com/trends/genetics/abstract/S0168-9525(09)00146-2 |pmid=19717203 |pmc=2770586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enzyme promiscuity==
{{main|enzyme promiscuity}}
In addition to their native reaction, many [[enzymes]] perform side reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mohamed|first=MF|author2=Hollfelder, F|title=Efficient, crosswise catalytic promiscuity among enzymes that catalyze phosphoryl transfer.|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta|date=Jan 2013|volume=1834|issue=1|pages=417–24|pmid=22885024|doi=10.1016/j.bbapap.2012.07.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, binding proteins may spend some proportion of their time bound to off-target proteins. These reactions or interactions may be of no consequence to current [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] but under altered conditions, may provide the starting point for adaptive evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Brien|first=PJ|author2=Herschlag, D|title=Catalytic promiscuity and the evolution of new enzymatic activities.|journal=Chemistry &amp; Biology|date=Apr 1999|volume=6|issue=4|pages=R91–R105|pmid=10099128|doi=10.1016/s1074-5521(99)80033-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, several mutations in the antibiotic resistance gene [[B-lactamase]] introduce [[cefotaxime]] resistance but do not affect [[ampicillin]] resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matsumura|first=I|author2=Ellington, AD|title=In vitro evolution of beta-glucuronidase into a beta-galactosidase proceeds through non-specific intermediates.|journal=Journal of Molecular Biology|date=Jan 12, 2001|volume=305|issue=2|pages=331–9|pmid=11124909|doi=10.1006/jmbi.2000.4259}}&lt;/ref&gt; In populations exposed only to ampicillin, such mutations may be present in a minority of members since there is not fitness cost (i.e. are within the [[neutral network (evolution)|neutral network]]). This represents cryptic genetic variation since if the population is newly exposed to cefotaxime, the minority members will exhibit some resistance.

==Chaperones==
[[Chaperone (protein)|Chaperones]] assist in [[protein folding]]. The need to fold proteins correctly is a big restriction on the [[Molecular evolution|evolution of protein sequences]]. It has been proposed that the presence of chaperones may, by providing additional robustness to errors in folding, allow the exploration of a larger set of genotypes. When chaperones are overworked at times of environmental stress, this may "switch on" previously cryptic genetic variation.&lt;ref name="Rutherford 98"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/24550 |vauthors=Rutherford SL, Lindquist S |title=Hsp90 as a capacitor for morphological evolution |journal=Nature |volume=396 |issue=6709 |pages=336–342 |year=1998 |pmid=9845070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hsp90===
The hypothesis that chaperones can act as evolutionary capacitors is closely associated with the heat shock protein [[Hsp90]]. When Hsp90 is downregulated in the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', a broad range of different phenotypes are seen, where the identity of the phenotype depends on the genetic background.&lt;ref name="Rutherford 98" /&gt; This was thought to prove that the new phenotypes depended on pre-existing cryptic genetic variation that had merely been revealed. More recent evidence suggests that these data might be explained by new mutations caused by the reactivation of formally dormant [[Transposon|transposable elements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Specchia V |author2=Piacentini L |author3=Tritto P |author4=Fanti L |author5=D’Alessandro R |author6=Palumbo G |author7=Pimpinelli S |author8=Bozzetti MP | title=Hsp90 prevents phenotypic variation by suppressing the mutagenic activity of transposons |journal=Nature |volume=463 |issue=1 |pages=662–665  |year=2010 |doi=10.1038/nature08739 |url= http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v463/n7281/full/nature08739.html |pmid=20062045}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this finding regarding transposable elements may be dependent on the strong nature of the Hsp90 knockdown used in that experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Vamsi K Gangaraju |author2=Hang Yin |author3=Molly M Weiner |author4=Jianquan Wang |author5=Xiao A Huang |author6=[[Haifan Lin]] | title=Drosophila Piwi functions in Hsp90-mediated suppression of phenotypic variation |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=43 |pages=153–158  |year=2011 |doi=10.1038/ng.743 |url= http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v43/n2/abs/ng.743.html |issue=2 |pmid= 21186352 |pmc=3443399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GroEL===

The overproduction of [[GroEL]] in ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' increases [[mutational robustness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mario A. Fares |author2=Mario X. Ruiz-González |author3=Andrés Moya |author4=Santiago F. Elena |author5=Eladio Barrio | title=Endosymbiotic bacteria: GroEL buffers against deleterious mutations |journal=Nature |volume=417 |pages=398  |year=2002 |doi=10.1038/417398a |url= http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v417/n6887/abs/417398a.html |issue=6887 |pmid= 12024205}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can increase [[evolvability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nobuhiko Tokuriki |author2=Dan S. Tawfik | title=Chaperonin overexpression promotes genetic variation and enzyme evolution |journal=Nature |volume=459 |pages=668–673 |year=2009 |doi=10.1038/nature08009 |url= http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v459/n7247/abs/nature08009.html |issue=7247 |pmid= 19494908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yeast prion [PSI+]==

[[Sup35p]] is a [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|yeast]] protein involved in recognising [[stop codon]]s and causing [[Translation (genetics)|translation]] to stop correctly at the ends of proteins. Sup35p comes in a normal form ([psi-]) and a [[Fungal prions|prion]] form ([PSI+]). When [PSI+] is present, this depletes the amount of normal Sup35p available. As a result, the rate of errors in which translation continues beyond a stop codon increases from about 0.3% to about 1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/yea.320070211 |vauthors=Firoozan M, Grant CM, Duarte JA, Tuite MF |title=Quantitation of readthrough of termination codons in yeast using a novel gene fusion assay |journal=Yeast |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=173–183 |year=1991 |pmid=1905859 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This can lead to different growth rates, and sometimes different [[Morphology (biology)|morphologies]], in matched [PSI+] and [psi-] strains in a variety of stressful environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/35035005 |vauthors=True HL, Lindquist SL |title=A yeast prion provides a mechanism for genetic variation and phenotypic diversity |journal=Nature| volume=407 |issue=6803 |pages=477–483 |year=2000 |pmid=11028992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the [PSI+] strain grows faster, sometimes [psi-]: this depends on the genetic background of the strain, suggesting that [PSI+] taps into pre-existing cryptic genetic variation. Mathematical models suggest that [PSI+] may have evolved, as an evolutionary capacitor, to promote [[evolvability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Masel J, Bergman A |title=The evolution of the evolvability properties of the yeast prion [PSI+] |journal=Evolution |volume=57 |issue=7 |pages=1498–1512 |year=2003 |pmid=12940355 |doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2003.tb00358.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1534/genetics.109.110213 |vauthors=Lancaster AK, Bardill JP, True HL, Masel J |title=The Spontaneous Appearance Rate of the Yeast Prion PSI+ and Its Implications for the Evolution of the Evolvability Properties of the PSI+ System |journal=Genetics|volume=184 |issue=2 |pages=393–400 |year=2010 |pmid=19917766 |pmc=2828720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[PSI+] appears more frequently in response to environmental stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tyedmers J, Madariaga ML, Lindquist S |title=Prion Switching in Response to Environmental Stress |journal=PLoS Biology|volume=6 |issue=11 |pages=e294 |year=2008 |pmid=19067491 |pmc=2586387 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060294 |editor1-last=Weissman |editor1-first=Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In yeast, more stop codon disappearances are [[Reading frame|in-frame]], mimicking the effects of [PSI+], than would be expected from mutation bias or than are observed in other taxa that do not form the [PSI+] prion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/molbev/msl172 |vauthors=Giacomelli M, Hancock AS, Masel J |title=The conversion of 3′ UTRs into coding regions |journal=Molecular Biology &amp; Evolution |volume=24 |pages=457–464 |year=2007 |pmid=17099057 |issue=2 |pmc=1808353}}&lt;/ref&gt; These observations are compatible with [PSI+] acting as an evolutionary capacitor in the wild.

==Gene knockouts==

Evolutionary capacitance may also be a general feature of complex gene networks, and can be seen in simulations of gene knockouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bergman A, Siegal ML |title=Evolutionary capacitance as a general feature of complex gene networks |journal=Nature |volume=424 |issue=6948 |pages=549–552 |date=July 2003 |pmid=12891357 |doi=10.1038/nature01765}}&lt;/ref&gt; A screen of all gene knockouts in [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|yeast]] found that many act as phenotypic stabilizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Levy SF, Siegal ML |title=Network hubs buffer environmental variation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae |journal=PLoS Biology |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=e264 |year=2008 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060264 |pmid=18986213 |pmc=2577700 |editor1-last=Levchenko |editor1-first=Andre}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knocking out a regulatory protein such as a chromatin regulator may lead to more effective capacitance than knocking out a metabolic enzyme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Itay Tirosh |author2=Sharon Reikhav |author3=Nadejda Sigal |author4=Yael Assia |author5=Naama Barkai |title=Chromatin regulators as capacitors of interspecies variations in gene expression |journal=Molecular Systems Biology| volume=6 |year=2010 |doi=10.1038/msb.2010.84 |issue=435 |pages=435 |pmid=21119629 |pmc=3010112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facultative sex==

[[Recessive]] mutations can be thought of as cryptic when they are present overwhelmingly in [[zygosity|heterozygotes]] rather than homozygotes. [[Origin and function of meiosis#Function of Meiosis|Facultative sex]] that takes the form of [[Self-fertilization#Autogamy|selfing]] can act as an evolutionary capacitor in a primarily [[asexual reproduction|asexual]] population by creating homozygotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Masel J, Lyttle DN |title=The consequences of rare sexual reproduction by means of selfing in an otherwise clonally reproducing species |journal=Theoretical Population Biology |year=2011 | doi=10.1016/j.tpb.2011.08.004 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040580911000736 |volume=80 |issue=4 |pages=317–322 |pmid=21888925 |pmc=3218209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facultative sex that takes the form of [[Reproduction#Allogamy|outcrossing]] can act as an evolutionary capacitor by breaking up allele combinations with phenotypic effects that normally cancel out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lynch M, Gabriel W |title=Phenotypic evolution and parthenogenesis |journal=American Naturalist| volume=122 |year=1983 |issue=6 |pages=745–764 |jstor=2460915 |doi=10.1086/284169|url=http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bvb:19-epub-5009-1 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fernando Fernández-Savater Martín''' (born 21 June 1947 at Basque city of San Sebastián) is one of [[Spain]]'s most popular living [[philosophers]], as well as an [[essayist]] and celebrated author.

Born in [[San Sebastián]], he was an [[Ethics]] professor at the [[University of the Basque Country]] for over a decade. Presently he is a [[Philosophy]] professor at the [[Complutense University of Madrid]]. He has won several accolades for his literary work, which covers issues as diverse as contemporary ethics, politics, cinema and literary studies.

'''Friedrich Maximilian von Klinger''' (17 February 1752 &amp;ndash; 25 February 1831) was a [[Germany|German]] dramatist and novelist. His play ''[[Sturm und Drang (play)|Sturm und Drang]]'' (1776) gave name to the [[Sturm und Drang]] artistic epoch. He was a childhood friend of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] and is often closely associated with [[Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz]]. Klinger worked as a playwright for the ''[[Seylersche Schauspiel-Gesellschaft]]'' for two years, but eventually left the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] to become a General in the [[Imperial Russian Army]].

==Biography==
One of the few eighteenth-century authors from the lower [[social class]], Klinger was born of humble parentage in [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]]. His father, Johannes Klinger, was a town constable who died when Klinger was just eight years old, forcing his mother Cornelia Fuchs Klinger, a sergeant's daughter, to support her son and two daughters by taking in laundry from the Frankfurt elite{{emdash}}including, perhaps, Klinger's future friends and patrons, the Goethes of Hirschgrabenallee.&lt;ref name="Harris" /&gt; In spite of this misfortune, however, Klinger excelled in his studies and was awarded a tuition waiver to study at the [[Gymnasium (Germany)|gymnasium]] where he also raised funds for his family by working as a tutor.&lt;ref name="Hochman"/&gt;

Though there is little documentation of Klinger's earliest interactions with [[Goethe]] during their Frankfurt years, they appear to have made acquaintance by 1773, as Klinger had begun work on his first dramas, ''Otto'' and ''Das leidende Weib'' (''The Suffering Wife'') which, according to his Leipzig publisher, owe a great debt to Goethe's then-unpublished ''[[Goetz von Berlichingen (Goethe)|Götz von Berlichingen mit der eisernen Hand]]''. Weygand released the collection at its Easter book fair of 1775, calling them "plays in the Goethean/Lenzian Manner."&lt;ref name="Harris" /&gt; Additionally, it was only with Goethe's financial assistance that Klinger was able to enroll at the [[University of Giessen|University of Gießen]] in 1774 where he briefly studied to be a legal clerk.&lt;ref name="Harris" /&gt;

In 1776, Klinger submitted his tragedy ''Die Zwillinge'' (''The Twins'') to a contest hosted by the Hamburg theatre under the auspices of the actress [[Sophie Charlotte Ackermann]] and her son, the famous actor and playwright [[Friedrich Ludwig Schröder]]. The play took first prize, earning Klinger enough critical acclaim to be appointed Theaterdichter to the ''[[Seylersche Schauspiel-Gesellschaft]]'' headed by [[Abel Seyler]] and held this post for two years.

In 1778, he joined the Austrian military and took part in the [[War of the Bavarian Succession]]. In 1780, he went to [[Saint Petersburg]], became an officer in the [[Imperial Russian Army]], was ennobled and attached to the Grand Duke Paul, whom he accompanied on a journey to [[Italy]] and [[France]]. In 1785, he was appointed director of the corps of cadets, and having married Elizaveta Alekseyeva (rumored to be a natural daughter of [[Catherine the Great]] and Prince [[Grigory Orlov]]), was made praeses of the Academy of Knights in 1799. In 1803, Klinger was nominated by Emperor Alexander curator of the [[University of Tartu#Universität Dorpat|Universität Dorpat]], an office he held until 1817. In 1811, he became lieutenant-general. He then gradually gave up his official posts, and after living for many years in honorable retirement, died in the imperial city of [[Tartu|Dorpat]] in present-day [[Estonia]].

Klinger was a man of vigorous moral character and full of fine feeling, though the bitter experiences and deprivations of his youth are largely reflected in his dramas. It was one of his earliest works, ''Sturm und Drang'' (1776), which gave its name to [[Sturm und Drang|this artistic epoch]]. In addition to this tragedy and ''Die Zwillinge'' (1776), the chief plays of his early period of passionate fervour and restless "storm and stress" are ''Die neue Arria'' (1776), ''Simsone Grisaldo'' (1776) and ''Stilpo und seine Kinder'' (1780). To a later period belongs the fine double tragedy of ''Medea in Korinth'' and ''Medea auf dem Kaukasos'' (1791). In Russia, he devoted himself mainly to the writing of philosophical romances, of which the best known are ''Fausts Leben, Taten und Höllenfahrt'' (1791), ''Geschichte Giafars des Barmeciden'' (1792) and ''Geschichte Raphaeis de Aquillas'' (1793). This series was closed in 1803 with ''Betrachtungen und Gedanken über verschiedene Gegenstände der Welt und der Literatur''. In these works, Klinger gives calm and dignified expression to the leading ideas which the period of Sturm und Drang had bequeathed to German classical literature.

==Bibliography==
Klingers works were published in twelve volumes (1809–1815), also 1832–1833 and 1842. The most recent edition is in eight volumes (1878–1880); but none of these is complete. A selection will be found in A. Sauer, ''Stürmer und Dränger'', vol. 1. (1883). See E. Schmidt, ''Lenz und Klinger'' (1878); M. Rieger, ''Klinger in der Sturm-und Drangperiode'' (1880); and ''Klinger in seiner Reife'' (1896).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16331">'''German philosophy''', here taken to mean either (1) [[philosophy]] in the [[German language]] or (2) philosophy by Germans, has been extremely diverse, and central to both the [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] and [[continental philosophy|continental]] traditions in philosophy for centuries, from [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] through [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Martin Heidegger]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] to contemporary philosophers. [[Søren Kierkegaard]] (a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[Danish philosophy|philosopher]]) is frequently included in surveys of German (or Germanic) philosophy due to his extensive engagement with German thinkers.&lt;ref&gt;Lowith, Karl.

==17th century==
===Leibniz===
[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bernhard Christoph Francke.jpg|upright|thumb|Leibniz]]
[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] (1646–1716) was both a philosopher and a [[mathematician]] who wrote primarily in [[Latin]] and [[French language|French]]. Leibniz, along with [[René Descartes]] and [[Baruch Spinoza]], was one of the three great 17th century advocates of [[rationalism]]. The work of Leibniz also anticipated modern [[logic]] and [[analytic philosophy]], but his philosophy also looks back to the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition, in which conclusions are produced by applying reason to first principles or a priori definitions rather than to [[empirical evidence]].

Leibniz is noted for his optimism - his ''[[Théodicée]]''&lt;ref&gt;Rutherford (1998) is a detailed scholarly study of Leibniz's [[theodicy]].&lt;/ref&gt; tries to justify the apparent imperfections of the world by claiming that it is [[Best of all possible worlds|optimal among all possible worlds]]. It must be the best possible and most balanced world, because it was created by an all powerful and all knowing God, who would not choose to create an imperfect world if a better world could be known to him or possible to exist. In effect, apparent flaws that can be identified in this world must exist in every possible world, because otherwise God would have chosen to create the world that excluded those flaws.

Leibniz is also known for his theory of [[Monad (Greek philosophy)|monads]], as exposited in ''[[Monadology|Monadologie]]''. Monads are to the metaphysical realm what [[atom]]s are to the physical/phenomenal.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}  They can also be compared to the corpuscles of the [[Mechanical Philosophy]] of René Descartes and others. Monads are the ultimate elements of the [[universe]]. The monads are "substantial forms of being" with the following properties: they are eternal, indecomposable, individual, subject to their own laws, un-interacting, and each reflecting the entire universe in a [[pre-established harmony]] (a historically important example of [[panpsychism]]). Monads are centers of [[force]]; substance is force, while [[space]], [[matter]], and [[Motion (physics)|motion]] are merely phenomenal.

==18th century==
===Wolff===
[[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] (1679–1754) was the most eminent German philosopher after Leibniz. His main achievement was a complete ''oeuvre'' on almost every scholarly subject of his time, displayed and unfolded according to his demonstrative-deductive, mathematical method, which perhaps represents the peak of [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[rationality]] in [[Germany]].

Wolff was one of the first to use German as a language of scholarly instruction and research, although he also wrote in Latin, so that an international audience could, and did, read him. A founding father of, among other fields, [[economics]] and [[public administration]] as academic disciplines, he concentrated especially in these fields, giving advice on practical matters to people in government, and stressing the professional nature of university education.

===Kant===
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|Immanuel Kant]]
In 1781, [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) published his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', in which he attempted to determine what we can and cannot know through the use of reason independent of all experience. Briefly, he came to the conclusion that we could come to know an external world through experience, but that what we could know about it was limited by the limited terms in which the mind can think: if we can only comprehend things in terms of cause and effect, then we can only know causes and effects. It follows from this that we can know the form of all possible experience independent of all experience, but nothing else, but we can never know the world from the “standpoint of nowhere” and therefore we can never know the world in its entirety, neither via reason nor experience.

Since the publication of his ''Critique'', Immanuel Kant has been considered one of the greatest influences in all of western philosophy. In the late 18th and early 19th century, one direct line of influence from Kant is [[German Idealism]].

Neo-Kantianism refers broadly to the revival of the type of philosophy explained by [[Immanuel Kant]] and of the interpretations of Kant provided by post-Kantian philosophers such as [[Schopenhauer]], [[Jakob Friedrich Fries]] and [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]]. Major figures in the neo-Kantian movement, which began around the 1860s, include [[Friedrich Albert Lange]] and [[Hermann Cohen]].

==19th century==
===German idealism===
{{Main|German idealism}}
[[File:Hegel portrait by Schlesinger 1831.jpg|thumb|left|upright|G. W. F. Hegel]]
The three most prominent German idealists were [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] (1762–1814), [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]] (1775–1854) and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1770–1831), who was the predominant figure in nineteenth century German philosophy.

===Schopenhauer===
[[File:Arthur Schopenhauer Portrait by Ludwig Sigismund Ruhl 1815.jpeg|upright|thumb|Schopenhauer]]
An idiosyncratic opponent of German idealism, particularly Hegel's thought, was [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] (1788&amp;nbsp;– 1860). He was influenced by Eastern philosophy, particularly Buddhism, and was known for his [[pessimism]]. Schopenhauer's most influential work, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', claimed that the world is fundamentally what we recognize in ourselves as our [[will (philosophy)|will]]. His analysis of will led him to the conclusion that emotional, physical, and sexual desires can never be fulfilled. Consequently, he eloquently described a lifestyle of negating  desires, similar to the [[Asceticism|ascetic]] teachings of [[Vedanta]] and the [[Desert Fathers]] of [[early Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 48 (Dover page 616), "The ascetic tendency is certainly unmistakable in [[Early Christianity|genuine and original Christianity]], as it was developed in the writings of the [[Desert Fathers|Church Fathers]] from the kernel of the [[New Testament]]; this tendency is the highest point to which everything strives upwards."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Karl Marx and the Young Hegelians===
[[File:Karl Marx 001.jpg|thumb|left|upright||Karl Marx, German economist and philosopher.]]
Among those influenced by Hegel was a group of young radicals called the [[Young Hegelians]], who were unpopular because of their radical views on religion and society. They included [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] (1804–72), [[Bruno Bauer]] (1809–82) and [[Max Stirner]] (1806–56) among their ranks.

[[Karl Marx]] (1818–83) often attended their meetings. He developed an interest in Hegelianism, French socialism and British economic theory. He transformed the three into an essential work of economics called ''[[Das Kapital]]'', which consisted of a critical economic examination of capitalism. [[Marxism]] became one of the major forces on twentieth century world history.

===Nietzsche===
[[File:Nietzsche187c.jpg|thumb|upright|Nietzsche]]
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900) was initially a proponent of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]. However, he soon came to disavow Schopenhauer's pessimistic outlook on life and sought to provide a positive philosophy. He believed this task to be urgent, as he believed a form of nihilism caused by modernity was spreading across Europe, which he summed up in the phrase "God is dead". His problem, then, was how to live a positive life considering that if you believe in God, you give in to dishonesty and cruel beliefs (e.g. divine predestination of some individuals to Hell), and if you don't believe in God, you give in to nihilism. He believed he found his solution in the concepts of the [[Übermensch]] and [[Eternal return|Eternal Recurrence]]. His work continues to have a major influence on both philosophers and artists.

==20th century==
===Analytic philosophy===
====Frege, Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle====
In the late 19th century, the predicate logic of [[Gottlob Frege]] (1848–1925) overthrew Aristotelian logic (the dominant logic since its inception in Ancient Greece). This was the beginning of [[analytic philosophy]]. In the early part of the 20th century, a group of German and Austrian philosophers and scientists formed the [[Vienna Circle]] to promote scientific thought over Hegelian system-building, which they saw as a bad influence on intellectual thought. The group considered themselves [[logical positivists]] because they believed all knowledge is either derived through experience or arrived at through analytic statements, and they adopted the predicate logic of Frege, as well as the early work of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] (1889–1951) as foundations to their work. Wittgenstein did not agree with their interpretation of his philosophy.

===Continental philosophy===
While some of the seminal philosophers of twentieth-century analytical philosophy were German-speakers, most German-language philosophy of the twentieth century tends to be defined not as analytical but 'continental' philosophy – as befits Germany's position as part of the European 'continent' as opposed to the British Isles or other culturally European nations outside of Europe.

====Phenomenology====
[[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]] began at the start of the 20th century with the descriptive psychology of [[Franz Brentano]] (1838–1917), and then the transcendental phenomenology of [[Edmund Husserl]] (1859–1938). It was then transformed by [[Martin Heidegger]] (1889–1976), whose famous book ''[[Being and Time]]'' applied phenomenology to [[ontology]], and who, along with [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], is considered one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century. Phenomenology has had a large influence on Continental Philosophy, particularly [[existentialism]] and [[poststructuralism]]. Heidegger himself is often identified as an existentialist, though he would have rejected this.

====Hermeneutics====
{{Main|Hermeneutics}}
Hermeneutics is the philosophical theory and practice of interpretation and understanding.

Originally hermeneutics referred to the interpretation of texts, especially religious texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friesian.com/hermenut.htm|title=Foundationalism and Hermeneutics|author=|date=|website=www.friesian.com|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768–1834), [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] (1833–1911) and others expanded the discipline of hermeneutics beyond mere [[exegesis]] and turned it into a general humanistic discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stonybrook.edu/philosophy/research/ihde_6.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604190525/http://www.stonybrook.edu/philosophy/research/ihde_6.html |archivedate=2011-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schleiermacher wondered whether there could be a hermeneutics that was not a collection of pieces of ad hoc advice for the solution of specific problems with text interpretation but rather a "general hermeneutics," which dealt with the "art of understanding" as such, which pertained to the structure and function of understanding wherever it occurs. Later in the 19th century, Dilthey began to see possibilities for continuing Schleiermacher's general hermeneutics project as a "general methodology of the humanities and social sciences".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mac.edu/faculty/richardpalmer/relevance.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-09-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928141532/http://www.mac.edu/faculty/richardpalmer/relevance.html |archive-date=2007-09-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, hermeneutics took an 'ontological turn'. Martin Heidegger's ''Being and Time'' fundamentally transformed the discipline. No longer was it conceived of as being about understanding linguistic communication, or providing a methodological basis for the human sciences - as far as Heidegger was concerned, hermeneutics is ontology, dealing with the most fundamental conditions of man's being in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/hermeneutics/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=C.|last=Mantzavinos|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=22 June 2016|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=22 March 2018|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Heideggerian conception of hermeneutics was further developed by Heidegger's pupil [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] (1900–2002), in his book ''[[Truth and Method]]''.

====Frankfurt School====
{{Main|Frankfurt School}}
[[File:JuergenHabermas.jpg|200px|thumb|Jürgen Habermas]]
In 1923, [[Carl Grünberg]] founded the [[Institute for Social Research]], drawing from [[Marxism]], [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s psychoanalysis and [[Max Weber|Weberian]] philosophy, which came to be known as the "[[Frankfurt School]]". Expelled by the [[Nazis]], the school reformed again in Frankfurt after [[World War II]]. Although they drew from Marxism, they were outspoken opponents of [[Stalinism]]. Books from the group, like [[Theodor W. Adorno|Adorno’s]] and [[Max Horkheimer|Horkheimer’s]] ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' and Adorno’s ''[[Negative Dialectics]]'', critiqued what they saw as the failure of the Enlightenment project and the problems of modernity. [[Postmodernism|Postmodernists]] consider the Frankfurt school to be one of their precursors.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Since the 1960s the [[Frankfurt School]] has been guided by [[Jürgen Habermas]]' (born 1929) work on [[communicative rationality|communicative reason]],&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen. (1987). ''The Theory of Communicative Action''. Third Edition, Vols. 1 &amp; 2, Beacon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen. (1990). ''Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action'', MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; linguistic [[intersubjectivity]] and what Habermas calls "the philosophical discourse of [[Modernity#In sociological thought|modernity]]".&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen. (1987). ''The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity''. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Goobi''' ([[Abbreviation|Abbr.]] of ''[[Göttingen]] online-objects binaries'') is an [[open-source software]] suite intended to support mass digitisation projects for cultural heritage institutions. The software implements international standards such as [[Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard|METS]], [[Metadata Object Description Schema|MODS]] and other formats maintained by the [[Library of Congress]]. Goobi consists of several independent modules serving different purposes such as controlling the digitization workflow, enriching descriptive and structural metadata, and presenting the results to the public in a modern and convenient way. It is used by archives, libraries, museums, publishers and scanning utilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|accessdate = 2016-05-23

|publisher  = intranda GmbH
|title      = Goobi - open source software for workflow management in digitisation projects
|url        = http://goobi.intranda.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
Goobi has the following properties:
* Central management of the digital copies (images)
* Central [[metadata]] [[Data management|management]]: it is possible to catalogue and integrate metadata from various locations
* Controlling mechanisms: they are used to control the progress of work of the partners
* Export and import interfaces for metadata and third-party digital copies
* Management tasks: managing error messages, completion of work steps and conveying to the next step, including changing partners
* Platform-independence: Goobi is a [[Web application]] and has to be designed in this way, as partners in digitisation of a customer are often distributed all over the world.

Components for the distributed workflow management are integrated into the product to ensure the management of a distributed communication and production among various partners.

==History==
Goobi is widely used in 40 European libraries in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and UK.
The workflow part of the software existed in two different forks of the original Goobi software. While the Goobi community edition was cooperatively maintained by major German libraries and digitization service providers, the Intranda edition is developed by a single company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:14-qucosa-101855 |title=Goobi wird Verein.

In May 2016, the German Goobi association ''Goobi Digitalisieren im Verein e.&amp;nbsp;V.'' decided to choose the new name ''[[Kitodo]]'' to avoid legal problems with the old name ''Goobi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''''Hypotheses non fingo''''' ([[Latin]] for "I feign no hypotheses", "I frame no [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]]", or "I contrive no hypotheses") is a famous phrase used by [[Isaac Newton]] in an essay, "[[General Scholium]]", which was appended to the second (1713) edition of the ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]''.

Here is a modern translation (published 1999) of the passage containing this famous remark:
{{quote|I have not as yet been able to discover the reason for these properties of gravity from phenomena, and I do not feign hypotheses. For whatever is not deduced from the phenomena must be called a hypothesis; and hypotheses, whether metaphysical or physical, or based on occult qualities, or mechanical, have no place in experimental philosophy. In this philosophy particular propositions are inferred from the phenomena, and afterwards rendered general by induction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaac Newton]] (1726). ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', General Scholium. Third edition, page 943 of [[I. Bernard Cohen]] and Anne Whitman's 1999 translation, [[University of California Press]]  {{ISBN|0-520-08817-4}}, 974 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The nineteenth century philosopher of science, [[William Whewell]], qualified this statement, as, he said, "it was by such a use of hypotheses, that both Newton himself and [[Kepler]], on whose discoveries those of Newton were based, made their discoveries". Whewell stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;What is requisite is, that the hypotheses should be close to the facts, and not connected with them by other arbitrary and untried facts; and that the philosopher should be ready to resign it as soon as the facts refuse to confirm it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences|first=William|last=Whewell|date=1840|publisher=London|page=438|url=https://archive.org/stream/philosophyinduc00whewgoog#page/n450/mode/2up}}

[[Aristotle]] defined '''inclination''' in the first paragraph of ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' with the statement "all men by their nature, desire to know."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Aristotle|title=Metaphysics|page=I.I.,980a2I-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]] proposed that humans have four natural inclinations - a natural inclination to preservation (life), an inclination to sexual reproduction (procreation), sociability, and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ethics: The Basics|last = Mizzoni|first = John|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons|year =2009|isbn = |location = |pages = 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inclination in the modern philosophy of ethics is viewed in the context of [[morality]], or moral worth.

== History ==

The definition of inclination has varying definitions in philosophy. Aristotle "holds it to be the mark of a good person to take pleasure in moral action," or what one wants to do. Immanuel Kant made a study of whether inclination is of the highest moral worth, and objected to Aristotle's analysis, reasoning that "it is the person who acts from the motive of duty in the teeth of contrary inclination who shows an especially high degree of moral worth." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Aristotle, Kant, and the Stoics: Rethinking Happiness and Duty|last = Stephen Engstrom, Jennifer Whiting|first = |publisher = Cambridge University Press|year =1998|isbn = |location = |pages = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Shopkeeper ===
Kant posits the example of a shopkeeper who continually charges fair prices to customers in order to build good will and repeat business.  If the shopkeeper continued that practice due to a mere inclination (to obtain repeat business) rather than sense of duty (higher principles of fairness and justice), though the shopkeeper's keeping the prices fair may conform with duty it has "no true moral worth."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Kant's Theory of Virtue: The Value of Autocracy|last = Baxley|first = Anne Margaret|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2010|isbn = |location = |pages = 14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; If instead the shopkeeper kept the prices fair solely out a duty to justice then he is acting simply from that duty. And in that case, in so doing Kant argues that the act now has "genuine moral worth."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

But changing the facts of the example might lead to an altogether different conclusion. If instead the shopkeeper is nearly bankrupt and desperately needs money to feed his family, and still the shopkeeper keeps the prices fair less out of a sense of duty but rather a sense of pride (an inclination), then some may argue that it is more impressive to stay fair under those circumstances.

== Criticism ==
Kant argues that acting out of pure duty has the highest value, in that the visitor is doing the right thing for the right reason, because it is the right thing to do.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Immanuel Kant's Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals|last = Dieter Schönecker, Allen W. Wood|first = |publisher = Harvard University Press|year = 2015|isbn = |location = |pages = 73}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not always clear whether inclination is morally more worthy than duty, or vice versa. For example, if following one's moral duty to always tell the truth has the highest value, then telling the truth (the location of a person) where it results in the murder of that person may show that following pure duty may not have the highest moral value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Ethics|last = Lawrence C. Becker, Charlotte B. Becker|first = |publisher = Routledge|year =2013|isbn = |location = |pages = 427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But many criticisms of Kant do not take into account that he did not preclude other acts from having moral worth, instead Kant is said to have only valued acting from pure duty as having "true" or "authentic" moral worth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Philosophers tend to disagree on whether operating solely out of duty is always the most morally worthy thing to do, rather than operating via inclination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ethics: Theory and Contemporary Issues, Concise Edition|last = Barbara|first = MacKinnon|publisher = Cengage Learning|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = 44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Kantian Ethics Almost Without Apology|last = Baron|first = Marcia W.|publisher = Cornell University Press|year = 1999|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Hospital Visitor ===
One famous example illustrates the difference between inclination and duty while illustrating a criticism of it, as given by Michael Stocker in his paper ''[[The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories]]'' (1976).
{{quote|[S]uppose you are in a hospital, recovering from a long illness. You are very bored and restless and at loose ends when Smith comes in once again. You are now convinced more than ever that he is a fine fellow and a real friend - taking so much time to cheer you up, traveling all the way across town, and so on. You are so effusive with your praise and thanks that he protests that he always tries to do what he thinks is his duty. . . . You at first think he is engaging in a polite form of self-deprecation, relieving the moral burden. But the more you two speak, the more clear it becomes that he was telling you the literal truth: that it is not essentially because of you that he came to see you, not because you are friends, but because he thought it his duty.}}
The visitor could be seen as lacking in moral merit. In other words, which scenario has more moral worth: one in which the friend goes to the hospital out of a cold sense of duty (what one should do) instead of wanting to do it (inclination)?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Kant's Search for the Supreme Principle of Morality|last = Kerstein|first = Samuel J.|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = May 2, 2002|isbn = |location = |pages = 116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kant might argue that the former has the "true" or "authentic" moral worthiness where Stocker argues acting purely out of duty in his example is morally inauthentic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''John Petrov Plamenatz''' born as '''Jovan Petrov Plamenac''' ({{lang-sr-cyrl|Јован Петров Пламенац}}, 16 May 1912 &amp;ndash; 19 February 1975), was a [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] political philosopher, who spent most of his academic life at the [[University of Oxford]]. He is best known for his analysis of political obligation and his theory of democracy.

==Biography==
Born to an upper-class family that had to flee [[Montenegro]] after the German and Austro-Hungarian occupation in 1916, Plamenatz came to [[England]] as a boy and was raised there. His father Peter was a politician active in [[True People's Party]] and served for one term as a Foreign Minister for Montenegro,  while his mother was of aristocratic background. Peter Plamenatz was forced to leave Montenegro in 1917, and John was sent to England.

He was educated at [[Clayesmore School]], whose head master and founder, [[Alexander Devine]], was an activist for the Montenegrin cause, and at [[Oriel College, Oxford]], where he read history. Plamenatz's speciality was political theory, which he spent most of his academic life teaching at the [[University of Oxford]]. When [[World War II]] broke out, he joined an anti-aircraft battery, and he was naturalized in 1941. At the end of the war, he returned to [[All Souls College|All Souls]], and he spent the rest of his life at Oxford. From 1951 to 1967 he was a research fellow at [[Nuffield College]], before returning to All Souls as Chichele Professor. He was a Fellow of [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls College]], 1936–51, and from 1951 to 1967 a Fellow of [[Nuffield College, Oxford|Nuffield College]]. He returned to All Souls as a professorial Fellow in 1967 when he succeeded [[Isaiah Berlin]] as [[Chichele Professor of Social and Political Theory]].

He was a member of the [[government in exile]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] in [[London]] during the [[Second World War]]. During this period he wrote "The Case of General Mihailovic".

In 1943 he married Marjorie Hunter, one of his students; there were no children. He lived at All Souls and at Scotland Mount, Hook Norton, [[Banbury, Oxfordshire|Banbury]], [[Oxfordshire]]. His principal recreation was walking.

In [[software development]], a '''leaky abstraction''' is an [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]] that leaks details that it is supposed to abstract away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Seibel, Peter |title=Practical Common Lisp|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dVJvr8PtCMUC&amp;pg=PA96|date=1 November 2006|publisher=Apress|isbn=978-1-4302-0017-8|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term "leaky abstraction" was popularized in 2002 by [[Joel Spolsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Spolsky|first=Joel|url=http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html|year=2002|accessdate=2010-09-22|title=The Law of Leaky Abstractions}} - a blog post by Spolsky that asserts that all non-trivial abstractions are 'leaky' and therefore problematic.&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier paper by [[Gregor Kiczales|Kiczales]] describes some of the issues with imperfect abstractions and presents a potential solution to the problem by allowing for the customization of the abstraction itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kiczales |first= Gregor |url=http://www2.parc.com/csl/groups/sda/publications/papers/Kiczales-IMSA92/for-web.pdf|year=1992|accessdate=2010-02-03| title=Towards a New Model of Abstraction in the Engineering of Software}} - a paper by Gregor Kiczales that describes the problem of imperfect abstractions and suggests a programming model for coping with them.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Law of Leaky Abstractions==
As coined by Spolsky, the '''Law of Leaky Abstractions''' states:

{{Cquote|All non-trivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky.}}

This statement highlights a particularly problematic cause of software defects: the reliance of the software developer on an abstraction's infallibility.

Spolsky's article gives examples of an abstraction that works most of the time, but where a detail of the underlying complexity cannot be ignored, thus leaking complexity out of the abstraction back into the software that uses the abstraction.

==Effect on software development==
As systems become more complex, software developers must rely upon more abstractions.  Each abstraction tries to hide complexity, letting a developer write software that "handles" the many variations of modern computing.

However, this law claims that developers of ''reliable'' software must learn the abstraction's underlying details anyway.

==Examples==
Spolsky's article cites many examples of leaky abstractions that create problems for software development:
*The [[TCP/IP]] protocol stack is the combination of [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]], which tries to provide reliable delivery of information, running on top of [[Internet Protocol|IP]], which provides only 'best-effort' service.  When IP loses a packet TCP has to retransmit it, which takes additional time. Thus TCP provides the abstraction of a reliable connection, but the implementation details leak through in the form of potentially variable performance (throughput and latency both suffer when data has to be retransmitted).
*[[Iterator|Iterating]] over a large two-dimensional [[Array data structure|array]] can have radically different performance if done horizontally rather than vertically, depending on the order in which elements are stored in memory. One direction may vastly increase [[CPU cache#Cache_miss|cache misses]] and [[page fault]]s, both of which greatly delay access to memory.
*The [[SQL]] language abstracts away the procedural steps for querying a [[database]], allowing one to merely define what one wants. But certain SQL queries are thousands of times slower than other logically equivalent queries.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} On an even higher level of abstraction, [[Object-relational mapping|ORM]] systems, which isolate object-oriented code from the implementation of object persistence using a relational database, still force the programmer to think in terms of databases, tables, and native SQL queries as soon as performance of ORM-generated queries becomes a concern.
*Although network file systems like [[Network File System|NFS]] and [[Server Message Block|SMB]] let one treat files on remote machines as if they were local, the connection to the remote machine may slow down or break, and the file stops acting as if it were local.
*The [[ASP.NET]] web forms programming platform, not to be confused with ASP.NET MVC, abstracts away the difference between HTML code to handle clicking on a hyperlink (&lt;a&gt;) and code to handle clicking on a button. However, ASP.NET needs to hide the fact that in HTML there is no way to submit a form from a hyperlink. It does this by generating a few lines of JavaScript and attaching an [[DOM_events#Common.2FW3C_events|onclick]] handler to the hyperlink. However, if the end user has JavaScript disabled, the ASP.NET application malfunctions. Furthermore, one cannot naively think of event handlers in ASP.NET in the same way as in a desktop GUI framework such as [[Windows Forms]]; due to the asynchronous nature of the Web, processing event handlers in ASP.NET requires exchanging data with the server and reloading the form.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3792">'''Logical harmony''', a name coined by [[Michael Dummett]], is a supposed constraint on the [[rules of inference]] that can be used in a given [[logical system]].

==Overview&lt;!--'Prior's tonk' redirects here--&gt;==
The logician [[Gerhard Gentzen]] proposed that the meanings of logical [[Logical connective|connective]]s could be given by the rules for introducing them into discourse. For example, if one believes that ''the sky is blue'' and one also believes that ''grass is green'', then one can introduce the connective ''[[logical conjunction|and]]'' as follows: ''The sky is blue AND grass is green.''  Gentzen's idea was that having rules like this is what gives meaning to one's words, or at least to certain words. The idea has also been associated with [[Wittgenstein]]'s dictum that in many cases we can say, ''[[meaning is use]]''. Most contemporary logicians prefer to think that the [[introduction rule]]s and the [[elimination rule]]s for an expression are equally important.  In this case, ''and'' is  characterized by the following rules:
{| border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" align="center"
|-
! Intro
! colspan="2" | Elim
|-
|
{| border="0"
|-
| &lt;VAR&gt;P&lt;/VAR&gt; || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || &lt;VAR&gt;Q&lt;/VAR&gt;
|-
| colspan="4" style="border-top:2px solid black;" |
|-
| colspan="4" align="center" | &lt;VAR&gt;P&lt;/VAR&gt; and &lt;VAR&gt;Q&lt;/VAR&gt;
|}
|
{| border="0"
|-
| &lt;VAR&gt;P&lt;/VAR&gt; and &lt;VAR&gt;Q&lt;/VAR&gt;
|-
| style="border-top:2px solid black;" |
|-
| align="center"| &lt;VAR&gt;P&lt;/VAR&gt;
|}
|
{| border="0"
|-
| &lt;VAR&gt;P&lt;/VAR&gt; and &lt;VAR&gt;Q&lt;/VAR&gt;
|-
| style="border-top:2px solid black;" |
|-
| align="center"| &lt;VAR&gt;Q&lt;/VAR&gt;
|}
|}

An apparent problem with this was pointed out by [[Arthur Prior]]: Why can't we have an expression (call it "'''tonk'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;") whose introduction rule is that of OR (from "p" to "p tonk q") but whose elimination rule is that of AND (from "p tonk q" to "q")?  This lets us deduce anything at all from any starting point.  Prior suggested that this meant that inferential rules could ''not'' determine meaning.  He was answered by [[Nuel Belnap]], that even though introduction and elimination rules can constitute meaning, not just any pair of such rules will determine a meaningful expression—they must meet certain constraints, such as not allowing us to deduce any new truths in the old vocabulary.  These constraints are what Dummett was referring to.

Harmony, then, refers to certain constraints that a proof theory must let hold between introduction and elimination rules for it to be meaningful, or in other words, for its inference rules to be meaning-constituting.

The application of harmony to logic may be considered a special case; it makes sense to talk of harmony with respect to not only inferential systems, but also conceptual systems in human cognition, and to type systems in programming languages.

Semantics of this form has not provided a very great challenge to that sketched in Tarski's [[semantic theory of truth]], but many philosophers interested in reconstituting the semantics of logic in a way that respects [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s ''meaning is use'' have felt that harmony holds the key.

'''Marilyn Ann Friedman''' (born April 7, 1945),&lt;ref name=Congress&gt;{{cite web |title= Friedman, Marilyn, 1945- |url= http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n93054794.html |publisher= Library of Congress |accessdate= 4 March 2015 |quote= data sheet (Marilyn Ann Friedman; b. 4/7/1945) }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American philosopher. She is the [[W. Alton Jones]] Chair of Philosophy at [[Vanderbilt University]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Education==
In 1967, she received an A.B. in political science from Washington University in St. Louis. In 1968, she moved to Canada for political reasons and resided there for a decade.  And by 1974 she received a Ph.D. in Philosophy from the University of Western Ontario in London, Canada. In 1964, while Friedman was taking a year off from college, she was persuaded by what she refers to as "a kind of political ignorance and apathy" by political chaos.

==Career==
Friedman's full-time teaching career began in 1973 where she spent four years teaching at [[Denison University]]. Since then she has also taught in the U.S. and Canada, ranging from small private liberal arts college to a large state university, such as University of Western Ontario, Bowling Green State University, Purdue University, and Washington University in St. Louis.

By the mid-1980s, autonomy had begun her main academic focus. "Many feminists thought that the moral ideal of autonomy represented male but not female modes of moral reasoning," said Friedman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Washington University in St. Louis Magazine|url = http://magazine-archives.wustl.edu/spring06/selfdetermination.htm|website = magazine-archives.wustl.edu|access-date = 2016-02-02|last = Tennant|first = Kristin|authorlink = }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Most people saw autonomy as a separation of self from loved ones—a kind of selfishness. I see it in terms of self-determination, and I didn't think it had to carry specifically masculine associations." Friedman considers the impact of familial and community relationships on autonomy and considers critical reflection as a way to diminish oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080970868630040|title=Autonomy, Philosophy of A2  - Wright, James D.|last=Stoljar|first=Natalie|date=2015-01-01|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780080970875|location=Oxford|pages=314–319|doi=10.1016/b978-0-08-097086-8.63004-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also explored such topics as: the nature of close interpersonal relationships, women in poverty, care and justice, partiality and impartiality, [[autonomy]], [[gender identity]], and [[multicultural education]].&lt;ref&gt;Switala, Kristin.

==Awards and Recognition==
Throughout Friedman's career, she has earned several research fellowships and directed a woman’s studies program. Her fields of special interest are female terrorists, [[women’s rights]], and [[cultural diversity]]. Friedman's current interests include a project on female terrorists, and she is covering topics such as whether virtue is required for happiness, how to engage in blaming people in a responsible manner, and how to understand abused women who are convicted of failing to protect their children from the same abusers who are abusing them.

==Personal life==
Friedman was raised in the city of [[Chicago]] by parents who were poorly educated, working class Jewish immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cddc.vt.edu/feminism/Friedman.html&lt;/ref&gt; She is married to philosopher, [[Larry May (philosopher)|Larry May]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-2284500143/may-larry-1952.html Larry May (born 1952)]&lt;/ref&gt; and has one daughter.

{{Descartes}}
'''Mental substance''' is the idea held by [[Mind-body dualism|dualists]] and [[idealism|idealists]], that minds are made-up of non-physical substance. This substance is often referred to as [[consciousness]].

This is opposed to the [[materialism|materialists]], who hold that what we normally think of as mental substance is ultimately physical matter (i.e., brains).

[[René Descartes|Descartes]], who was most famous for the assertion "[[I think therefore I am]]", has had a lot of influence on the [[mind–body problem]]. He describes his theory of mental substance (which he calls '''''res cogitans''''' distinguishing it from the ''[[res extensa]]'') in the ''Second [[Meditations on First Philosophy|Meditation]]'' (II.8) and in ''[[Principia Philosophiae]]'' (2.002).

He used a more precise definition of the word "substance" than is currently popular: that a substance is something which can exist without the existence of any other substance. For many philosophers, this word or the phrase "mental substance" has a special meaning.

[[Gottfried Leibniz]], belonging to the generation immediately after Descartes, held the position that the mental world was built up by [[Monad (philosophy)|monad]]s, mental objects that are not part of the physical world (see ''[[Monadology]]'').

When analysing the regularities and structure of [[music]] as well as the processing of music in the [[brain]], certain findings lead to the question of whether music is based on a [[syntax]] that could be compared with [[linguistic syntax]]. To get closer to this question it is necessary to have a look at the basic aspects of syntax in [[language]], as language unquestionably presents a complex syntactical system. If music has a matchable syntax, noteworthy equivalents to basic aspects of linguistic syntax have to be found in musical structure. By implication the processing of music in comparison to language could also give information about the structure of music.

==Comparison to linguistic syntax==
Syntax in general can be referred to as a study of the principles and rules needed for the construction of a language or as a term in particular describing these principles and rules for a special language.

===Linguistic syntax – three principles&lt;ref name=Patel2008&gt;Patel, A.D. (2008). Music, Language, and the Brain. Oxford University Press, USA&lt;/ref&gt;===
Linguistic syntax is especially marked by its structural richness, which becomes apparent in its multi layered organization as well as in the strong relationship between syntax and meaning. That is that there are special linguistic syntactic principles that define how the language is formed out of different subunits, such as words out of [[morphemes]], phrases out of words and sentences out of phrases. Furthermore, linguistic syntax is featured by the fact that a word can take on abstract [[grammatical functions]] that are less defined through properties of the word itself and more through the context and structural relations. This is for example that every [[noun]] can be used as a [[subject (grammar)|subject]], [[object (grammar)|object]] or [[indirect object]], but without a sentence as the normal context of a word, no statement about its [[grammatical function]] can be made. At last, linguistic syntax is marked by abstractness. This means that only conventional structural relations and not psychoacoustic relationships are the basis for the linguistic syntax.

===Musical syntax&lt;ref name=Patel2008/&gt;===
Concerning musical syntax these three aspects of richness in linguistic syntax as well as the abstractness should be found in music too, if one wants to claim that music has a comparable syntax. An annotation that has to be made concerns the fact that most of the studies dealing with musical syntax are confined to the consideration of Western European tonal music. Thus this article can also only focus on [[tonality|Western tonal music]].

====Multilayered organization====
Considering the multilayered organization of music, three levels of [[pitch organization]] can be found in music.

=====Scale degrees=====
The lowest level are [[musical scales]], which consist of seven tones or "scale degrees" per [[octave]] and have an asymmetric pattern of [[interval (music)|intervals]] between them (for example the C-major scale). They are built up out of the 12 possible [[pitch class]]es per octave (A, A{{music|#}},B, C, C{{music|#}}, D, D{{music|#}}, E, F, F{{music|#}}, G, G{{music|#}}) and the different scale tones are not equal in their structural stability. Empirical evidence indicates that there is a hierarchy concerning the stability of the single tones. The most stable one is called the "[[tonic (music)|tonic]]" and embodies the tonal centre of the scale. The most unstable tones were the ones closest to the tonic (scale degrees 2 and 7), which are called the "[[supertonic]]" and the "[[leading tone]]". In studies scale degrees 1, 3 and 5 have been judged as closely related. It was also shown that an implicit knowledge of scale structure has to be learned and developed in childhood and is not inborn.

=====Chord structure=====
The next superordinate level of pitch organization is the [[chord (music)|chord]] structure, which means that three scale tones with a distance of two scale steps each are played simultaneously and are therefore combined into chords. When building up chords on the basis of a musical scale there are three different kinds of chords resulting, namely "major"(e.g. C-E-G), "minor" (e.g. D-F-A) and "diminished" (e.g. B-D-F) triads. This is due to the asymmetric intervals between the scale tones. These asymmetric intervals effect, that a distance of two scale steps can comprise either three or four semitones and therefore be an interval of a minor (with three semitones) or a major (with four semitones) third. A [[major triad]] consists of a major third followed by a minor third and is built on scale degrees 1, 3 and 5 (or 4, 6 and 1, for the subdominant, and 5, 7 and 2, for the dominant, the other two major triads that can be formed from the major scale). A [[minor triad]] consists of a minor third followed by a major third and is built on scale degrees 2, 4 and 6 (or 3, 5 and 7, for the mediant, and 6, 1 and 4, for the submediant). Only on scale degree 7 the triad consists of two minor thirds and is therefore defined as a [[diminished triad]].
Chordal syntax touches mainly four basic aspects. The first is, that the lowest [[Musical note|note]] in each triad functions as a fundament of the chord and therefore as the structural most important pitch. The chord is named after this note as well as the chord's harmonic label is grounded on it. The second aspect is, that chord syntax provides norms for altering chords by additional tones. One example is the addition of a fourth tone to a triad, which is the seventh tone of the scale (e.g. in a C-major scale the addition of F to the triad G-B-D would lead to a so-called "[[dominant seventh chord]]"). Concerning norms for the progression of chords in time the third aspect focuses on the relationship between chords. The patterning of chords in a [[cadence (music)|cadence]] for example indicates a movement from a V chord to a I chord. The fact that the I chord is perceived as a resting point in a musical phrase implicates, that the single chords built up on notes of a scale are not equal in there stability but show the same differences in stability as the notes of the scale do. This describes the fourth basic aspect of chordal syntax. The tonic chord (the one built on the tonic, C-E-G in C-major, for example) is the most stable and central chord, followed by the dominant chord (built on the 5th scale degree) and the subdominant chord (built on the 4th scale degree).
"

=====Key structure=====
The highest level of pitch organization can be seen in [[key (music)|key structure]]. In Western European tonal music the key is based on a scale with its associated chords and chord relations. Scales can be built up as minor or major scales (differing in the succession of intervals between the scale tones) on each of the 12 pitch classes and therefore there are 24 possible keys in tonal music. Analysing [[key (music)|key]] structure in context of musical syntax means to examine the relationship between keys in a piece of music. Usually, not only one key is used to build up a composition, but also so-called key "[[modulation]]s" (in other words the alteration of keys) are utilized. In these modulations a certain recurring pattern can be perceived. Switches from one key to another are often found between related keys. Three general principles for relationship between keys can be postulated on the basis of perceptual experiments and also neural evidence for implicit knowledge of key structure. Looking at the C-major key as an example, there are three close related keys: G-major, A-minor and C-minor. C-major and G-major are keys whose 1st scale degrees are separated by a musical fifth (the pattern of relations is represented in the [[circle of fifths]]" for major keys). A-minor and C-major share the same notes of the scale but with a different tonic (so-called [[relative minor key]], i.e. C-major and A-minor). And C-major and C-minor have the same tonic in their scales.
All in all it can be said that music like the human language has a considerable multi layered organization.

====Hierarchical structure====
Considering the last two basic aspects of linguistic syntax, namely the considerable significance of the order of subunits for the meaning of a sentence as well as the fact that words undertake abstract grammatical functions defined through context and structural relations, it seems to be useful to analyse the hierarchical structure of music to find correlations in music.

=====Ornamentation=====
One aspect of hierarchical structure of music is the [[Ornament (music)|ornamentation]]. The meaning of the word "ornamentation" points to the fact that there are events in a musical context that are less important to form an idea of the general gist of a sequence than others. The decision on the importance of events not only comprises harmonic considerations, but also rhythmic and motivic information. But a classification of events simply into ornamental and structural events would be too superficial. In fact the most common hypothesis implies, that music is organized into structural levels, which can be pictured as branches of a tree. A pitch that is structural at a higher level may be ornamental at a deeper level. This can be compared with the hierarchical syntactic structure of a [[sentence (music)|sentence]] in which there are structural elements that are necessary to build up a sentence like the noun phrase and the verb phrase but looking at a deeper level the structural elements also contain additional or ornamental constituents.

=====Tension and resolution=====
Searching for other aspects of hierarchical structure of music there is a controversial discussion, if the organization of [[Tension (music)|tension]] and [[Resolution (music)|resolution]] in music can be described as hierarchical structure or only as a purely sequential structure. According to [[Patel]]&lt;ref name =Patel2008/&gt; research in this area has produced apparently contradictory evidence, and more research is needed to answer this question.
The question concerning the kind of structure that features tension and resolution in music is linked very close to the relationship between order and meaning in music. Considering tension and resolution as one possible kind of meaning in music a hierarchical structure would imply that a change of order of musical elements would have an influence on the meaning of the music.

====Abstractness====
The last aspect to examine is the [[abstraction|abstractness]] of linguistic syntax and its correlate in music. There are two contradicting points of views. The first one claims that the foundation for musical scales and for the existence of a [[tonal centre]] in music can be seen in the physical basis of [[overtone]] series or in the psychoacoustic properties of chord in tonal music respectively. But in recent time there is strong evidence for the second point of view that syntax reflects abstract cognitive relationships.

All in all the consideration of syntax in music and language shows, that music has a syntax comparable to the linguistic syntax especially concerning a great complexity and a hierarchical organization. Nevertheless, it has to be emphasized, that musical syntax is not a simple variant of linguistic syntax, but a similar complex system with its own substance. That means that it would be the wrong way just to search for musical analogies of linguistic syntactic entities such as nouns or verbs.

==Neuronal processing of musical and linguistic syntax==

Investigating the neuronal processing of musical syntax can serve two proposed aspects.'''&lt;ref&gt;Patel, A.D. (2003). Language, music, syntax and the brain. Nature Neuroscience. 6(7):674-681&lt;/ref&gt;''' The first is to learn more about the processing of music in general. That is, which areas of the [[brain]] are involved and if there are specific markers of brain activity due to the processing of music and musical syntax. The second aspect is to compare the processing of musical and linguistic syntax to find out, if they have an effect upon each other or if there even is a significant overlap. The verification of an overlap would support the thesis, that syntactic operations (musical as well as linguistic) are modular. "Modular" means, that the complex system of processing is decomposed into subsystems with modular functions. Concerning the processing of syntax this would mean, that the [[domain knowledge|domain]] of music and language each have specific syntactic representations, but that they share [[neural resources]] for activating and integrating these representations during [[syntactic processing]].

===Processing of music and musical syntax===

====Requirements====

Processing of music and musical syntax comprises several aspects concerning melodic, rhythmic, metric, timbral and harmonic structure. For the processing of [[Diatonic function|chord functions]] four steps in processing can be described.
(1)Primarily, a tonal centre has to be detected out of the first chords of a sequence. Often the first chord is interpreted as the tonal centre of a sequence and a reevaluation is necessary, if the first chord has another harmonic function.
(2)Successive chords are related to this tonal centre concerning their [[harmonic distance]] from the tonal centre.
(3)As described above (Does music have a syntax?), music has a hierarchical structure in terms of pitch organization and organization of tensioning and releasing in music. Pitch organization concerning chords means, that in a musical phrase the tonic is the most stable chord and experienced as the resting point. The dominant and subdominant anon are more stable than the submediant and the supertonic. The progression of chords in time forms a tonal structure based on pitch organization, in which moving away from the tonic is perceived as tensioning and moving towards the tonic is experienced as releasing. Therefore, hierarchical relations may convey organized patterns of meaning.
(4)Concerning harmonic aspects of major-minor tonal music, Musical syntax can be characterized by statistical regularities in the succession of chord functions in time, that is probabilities of chord transitions. As these regularities are stored in a [[long-term memory]], predictions about following chords are made automatically, when listening to a musical phrase.

====MMN and ERAN&lt;ref&gt;Koelsch, S. (2009). "Music-syntactic Processing and Auditory Memory – Similarities and Differences between ERAN and MMN". Psychophysiology, 46(1): 179-190.&lt;/ref&gt;====

The violation of these automatically made predictions lead to the observation of so-called [[Event-related potential|ERPs]] (event related potential, a stereotyped electrophysiological response to an internal or external stimulus). Two forms of ERPs can be detected in the context of processing music. One is the [[Mismatch negativity|MMN]] (mismatch negativity), which has first been investigated only with physical deviants like [[frequency]], [[sound intensity]], [[timbre]] deviants (referred to as [[phMMN]]) and could now also be shown for changes of abstract auditory features like tone pitches (referred to as [[afMMN]]). The other one is the so-called [[Electroencephalography|ERAN]] (early right anterior negativity), which can be elicited by syntactic irregularities in music. Both the ERAN and the MMN are ERPs indicating a mismatch between predictions based on regularities and actually experienced acoustic information. As for a long time it seemed to be, that the ERAN is a special variant of the MMN, the question arises, why they are told apart today. There are several differences between the MMN and the ERAN found in the last years:

=====Differences – occurrence=====
Even though music syntactic regularities are often simultaneously acoustical similar and music syntactic irregularities are often simultaneously acoustical different, an ERAN but not an MMN can be elicit, when a chord does not represent a physical but a syntactic deviance. To demonstrate this, so-called "Neapolitan sixth chords" are used. These are consonant chords when played solitary, but which are added into a musical phrase of in which they are only distantly related to the harmonic context. Added into a chord sequence of five chords, the addition of a [[Neapolitan sixth chord]] at the third or at the fifth position evokes different amplitudes of ERANs in the [[EEG]] with a higher [[amplitude]] at the fifth position. Nevertheless, when creating a chord sequence in which the [[Neapolitan chord]] at the fifth position is music-syntactically less irregular than a Neapolitan chord at the third position, the amplitude is higher at the third position (see figure 4...). In opposition to the MMN, a clear ERAN is also elicited by using syntactically irregular chords, which are acoustically more similar to a proceeding harmonic context than syntactically regular chords. Therefore, the MMN seems to be based on an on-line establishment of regularities. That means, that the regularities are extracted on-line from the acoustic environment. In opposition, the ERAN rests upon representations of music-syntactic regularities which exist in a [[long-term memory]] format and which are learned during early childhood.

=====Differences – development=====
This is represented in the development of the ERAN and MMN. The ERAN cannot be verified in newborn babies, whereas the MMN can actually be demonstrated in [[fetus]]. In two-year-old children, the ERAN is very small, in five-year-old children a clear ERAN is found, but with a longer latency than in adults. With the age of 11 years children show an ERAN similar to ERANs in adults. Out of these observation the thesis can be built that the MMN is essential for the establishment and maintenance of representations of the acoustic environment and for processes of the auditory scene analysis. But only the ERAN is completely based on learning to build up a structural model, which is established with reference to representations of syntactic regularities already existing in a long-term memory format. Considering effects of [[training]] both the ERAN and the MMN can be modulated by training.

=====Differences – neural sources=====
Differences between the ERAN and the MMN also exist in the [[neural sources]] for the main contributions to the ERPs. The sources for the ERAN are located in the [[pars opercularis]] of the [[inferior fronto-lateral cortex]] (inferior [[Brodmann's area]] with contributions from the ventrolateral [[premotor cortex]] and the [[anterior superior temporal gyrus]], whereas the MMN receives its main contributions from and within the vicinity of the [[primary auditory cortex]] with additional sources in the [[frontal cortex|frontal cortical areas]]. Therefore, the sources for the ERAN basically lie in the frontal cortex whereas the sources for the MMN are located in the [[temporal lobe]]. Other hints for this thesis emerge from the fact that under a [[propofol]] sedation which mainly affects the frontal cortex, the ERAN is abolished while the MMN is only reduced. At last, the amplitude of the ERAN is reduced under ignore conditions whereas the MMN is largely unaffected by attentional modulations.

=====Processes to elicit the MMN or ERAN=====

(1)First, a separation of sound sources, an extraction of sound features and the establishment of representations of auditory objects of the incoming acoustic input have to be made. The same processes are required for the MMN and ERAN.

(2)For the MMN regularities are filtered on-line out of the input to create a model of the acoustic environment. At this point, there is a difference to the ERAN as for the ERAN representations of regularities already exist in a long-term memory format and the incoming sound is integrated into a pre existent model of [[musical form|musical structure]].

(3)According to the model of musical structure, predictions concerning forthcoming auditory events are formed. This process is similar for the ERAN and for the MMN.

(4)At least a comparison between the actually incoming sound and the predictions based on the model is made. This process is partly the same for the MMN and the ERAN as well.

=== Comparison of the processing of musical and linguistic syntax&lt;ref name=Patel2008/&gt;===

As the ERAN is similar to an ERP called [[Early Left Anterior Negativity|ELAN]] which can be elicited by violation of linguistic syntax it seems to be obvious that the ERAN really represents syntactic processing. Deduced from this thought an interaction between music-syntactic and language-syntactic processing would be very likely.There are different possibilities in [[neuroscience]] to approach to an answer to the question of an overlap between the neuronal processing of linguistic and musical syntax.

====Neuropsychological approach====
This method deals with the question, how structure and function of the [[brain]] relate to outcomes in behaviour and other psychological processes. From this area of research there has been evidence for the dissociation between musical and linguistic syntactic abilities. In case reports it was possible to show that [[amusia]] ( a deficiency in fine-grainded perception of pitch which leads to musical tone-deafness and can be congenital or acquired later in life as from brain damage) is not necessarily linked to [[aphasia]] (severe language impairments following brain damage) and vice versa. This means that individuals with normal speech and language abilities showed musical tone-deafness as well as individuals with language impairments had sufficient means of musical syntactic abilities. The problem of neuropsychologic research is that there has not been a former case report which showed that aphasia does not necessarily entail amusia in non-musicians, to the contrary newer findings suggest that amusia is almost always linked to aphasia.

====Neuroimaging====
Furthermore, results from [[neuroimaging]] led to the "[[shared syntactic integration resource hypothesis]]" (SSIRH), which supports the presumption, that there is an overlap between the processing of musical and linguistic syntax and that syntactic operations are modular. Furthermore, research using the method of [[electroencephalography]] has shown that a difficulty or irritation in musical as well as in linguistic syntax elicit ERPs which are similar to each other.

How can the discrepancy between [[neuropsychology]] and neuroimaging be explained?

====Modularity====
In fact, the concept of modularity itself can help to understand the different and apparently contradicting findings in neuropsychologic research and neuroimaging. Introducing the concept of a dual system, in which there is a distinction between syntactic representation and syntactic processing, this could mean, that there is a distinction between long-term structural knowledge in a [[domain knowledge|domain]] (representation) and operations conducted on that knowledge (syntactic processing). A damage in an area representing long-term musical knowledge would lead to amusia without aphasia, but a damage in an area representing syntactic processing would cause an impairment of both musical and linguistic syntactic processing.

====Comparison of syntactic processing-three theories====
The comparison of the syntactic processing of language and music is based on three theories which should be mentioned but which are not explained in detail. The first two, the "dependency locality theory" and the "expectancy theory" refer to syntactic processing in language, whereas the third one, the "tonal pitch space theory", relates to the syntactic processing in music.

The language theories contribute to the concept that in order to conceive the structure of a sentence, resources are consumed. If the conception of a this structure is difficult due to the fact that distant words belong to each other or an expected structure of the sentence is violated, more resources, namely the ones for activating low-activation items, are consumed.

Violating an anticipated structure in music could mean a harmonically unexpected note or chord in a musical sequence. As in language this is associated with a "processing cost due to the tonal distance" (Patel, 2008) and therefore means that more resources are needed for activating low-activation items.

====SSIRH – the leading concept====
Overall these theories lead to the "shared syntactic integration resources hypothesis" as the areas from which low-activation items are activated could be the correlate to the overlap between linguistic and musical syntax.
Strong evidence for the existence of this overlap comes from studies, in which music-syntactic and a linguistic-syntactic irregularities were presented simultaneously. They showed an interaction between the ERAN and the [[LAN]] (left anterior negativity;ERP which is elicited by linguistic-syntactic irregularities). The LAN elicited was reduced when an irregular word was presented simultaneously with an irregular chord compared to the condition when an irregular word was presented with a regular chord. Contrary to this finding the phMMN elicited by frequency deviants did not interact with the LAN.

From this facts it can be reasoned that the ERAN relies on neural resources related to syntactic processing (Koelsch 2008). Furthermore, they give strong evidence for the thesis, that there is an overlap between the processing of musical and linguistic syntax and therefore that syntactic operations (musical as well as linguistic) are modular.

His specialty is contemporary [[Western philosophy]], including modern Spanish thinkers such as [[José Ortega y Gasset]], [[Xavier Zubiri]] and [[Antonio Machado]].
 
== Biography ==
He graduated from the [[Universidad Complutense de Madrid]] in 1958, with a degree in philosophy and literature, and obtained his doctorate there three years later. His thesis on the concept of [[ousia]] in [[Aristotle]] was published as a book in 1962. This was followed by studies at the [[University of Freiburg]] and the [[University of Heidelberg]]. He was also a [[research fellow|Fellow]] at the [[Spanish National Research Council]], the [[Goethe-Institut]] and the [[Alexander von Humboldt Foundation]].&lt;ref name="R"&gt;[https://cordobapedia.wikanda.es/wiki/Pedro_Cerezo_Gal%c3%a1n Brief biography] @ Córdobapedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6278">The [[Phagdru Kagyu|Phagmo Drupa Kagyu]] ({{bo|t=ཕག་མོ་གྲུ་པ་བཀའ་བརྒྱུད|w=phag mo gru pa bka' brgyud|}}) or [[Phagdru Kagyu]] (ཕག་གྲུ་བཀའ་བརྒྱུད) is a subschool of the Tibetan [[Kagyu]] school. 

==History==
It was founded by [[Phagmo Drupa Dorje Gyalpo]]  ({{bo|t=ཕག་མོ་གྲུ་པ་རྡོ་རྗེ་རྒྱལ་པོ|w=phag mo gru pa rdo rje rgyal po}}, 1110–1170) who was the elder brother of the famous Nyingma lama [[Ka Dampa Deshek]] (1122–1192) founder of [[Katok Monastery]]. Before meeting [[Gampopa]], Dorje Gyalpo studied with [[Sachen Kunga Nyingpo]] ''(sa chen kun dga' snying po)'' (1092–1158) from whom he received [[lamdre]] transmission.&lt;ref&gt;Stearns, Cyrus. ''Luminous Lives: The Story of the Early Masters of the Lam dre in Tibet''. Wisdom Publications. {{ISBN|0-86171-307-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1158 Dorje Gyalpo built a reed-hut hermitage at Phakmo Drupa (''"Sow's Ferry Crossing"'') in a juniper forest in Nedong  ({{bo|t=སྣེ་གདོང|w=sne gdong|}}) high above the [[Brahmaputra River]]. Later, as his fame spread and disciples gathered, this site developed into the major monastic seat of Dentsa Thel  ({{bo|t=གདན་ས་ཐེལ|w=gdan sa thel}}). Following his death the monastery declined and his disciple [[Jigten Sumgön]] sent Chenga Drakpa Jungne ({{bo|t=སྤྱན་སྔ་གྲགས་པ་འབྱུང་གནས|w=spyan snga grags pa 'byung-gnas}}) (1175–1255), a member of the Lang ({{bo|w=rlang}}) family, to become abbot and look after the monastery.{{quote|Chenga Drakpa Jungne was abbot for 21 years and restored the monastery to its former grandeur. In 1253 when the Sakyapas came to power they appointed Dorje Pel [({{bo|t=རྡོ་རྗེ་དཔལ|w=rdo rje dpal}})] the brother of Chenga Drakpa Jungne as Tripon [hereditary myriarch] of Nedon. From that time on the Tripon who as a monk, assumed the seat of government of Nedon and also ruled as abbot at Dentsa Thel and his brothers married in order to perpetuate the family line. This tie with the monastery founded by Phagmo Drupa led to the Tripons of Nedong to become known as Phagdru (short of Phagmo Drupa) Tripon and their period of rule in Tibet as the Phagmo Drupa period (or Phagmodrupa dynasty).&lt;ref&gt;''"The rise of Changchub Gyaltsen and the Phagmo Drupa Period″ '' in ''Bulletin of Tibetology'', 1981 Gangtok: Namgyal Institute of Tibetology [http://www.thdl.org/texts/reprints/bot/bot_1981_01_02.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen]] (1302–1364) was born into this Lang family. In 1322, he was appointed by the Sakyapas as the Pagmodru Myriarch of Nedong and given the title "Tai Situ" in the name of the Yuan emperor. Soon he fought with a neighboring myriarchy trying to recover land lost in earlier times. This quarrel displeased the Sakya ruler (''[[dpon-chen]]'') Gyelwa Zangpo ({{bo|t=རྒྱལ་བ་བཟང་པོ|w=rgyal ba bzang po}}) who dismissed him as myriach. Following a split between Gyelwa Zangpo and his minister Nangchen Wangtsön ({{bo|t=ནང་ཆེན་དབང་བརྩོན|w=nang chen dbang brtson}}), the former restored Changchup Gyeltsen to his position in 1352. Taking advantage of the situation, Changchup Gyeltsen immediately went on the offensive and soon controlled the whole of the central [[Tibet]]an province of Ü. Gyelwa Zangpo and Changchup Gyeltsen were reconciled at a meeting with the Sakya lama Künpangpa ({{bo|t=བླ་མ་ཀུན་སྤངས་པ|w=bla ma kun spangs pa}}). This angered Nangchen Wangtsön, who usurped Gyelwa Zangpo as Sakya ruler and imprisoned him.

In 1351 Changchup Gyeltsen established an important Kagyu monastery at the ancient Tibetan capital of [[Tsetang]]. This was later dismantled during the time of the [[7th Dalai Lama]] (18th century) and replaced by a Gelugpa monastery, Gaden Chokhorling.&lt;ref&gt;Dorje, Gyurme. Tibet Handbook: The Travel Guide. Footprint 1999. p.185 {{ISBN|1-900949-33-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1358, Wangtson assassinated Lama Kunpangpa. Learning of this, Changchup Gyeltsen then took his forces to Sakya, imprisoned Wangtsön, and replaced four hundred court officials and the newly appointed ruling lama. The Pagmodrupa rule of Central Tibet (U, Tsang and Ngari) dates from this coup in 1358.&lt;ref&gt;Berzin, Alexandra  [http://studybuddhism.com/web/en/archives/e-books/unpublished_manuscripts/survey_tibetan_history/chapter_4.html A Survey of Tibetan History: 4 The Pagmodru, Rinpung, and Tsangpa Hegemonies]&lt;/ref&gt;

As ruler, Changchup Gyeltsen was keen to revive the glories of the [[Tibetan Empire]] of [[Songtsän Gampo]] and assert Tibetan independence from the [[Yuan dynasty]] of the [[Mongols]] and from [[Ming dynasty|Ming China]]. He took the Tibetan title "Desi" (sde-srid), re-organized the thirteen myriarchies of the Yuan Shakya rulers into numerous districts ({{bo|w=rdzong}}), abolished Mongol law in favour of the old Tibetan legal code, and Mongol court dress in favour of traditional Tibetan dress.&lt;ref&gt;Norbu, Dawa "China's Tibet Policy". RoutledgeCurzon 2001. p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen died in 1364 and was succeeded as by his nephew [[Jamyang Shakya Gyaltsen]] ({{bo|t=ཇམ་དབྱངས་ཤ་ཀྱ་རྒྱལ་མཚན|w=jam dbyangs sha kya rgyal mtshan}}) (1340–1373), who was also a monk. The subsequent rule of the [[Phagmodrupa Dynasty]] lasted until 1435 followed by the [[Rinpungpa]] kings who ruled for four generations from 1435–1565 and the three [[Tsangpa]] kings 1566-1641.

In 1406 the ruling Phagmodrupa prince, [[Gongma Drakpa Gyaltsen|Drakpa Gyaltsen]], turned down the imperial invitation to him to visit China.

From 1435 to 1481 the power of the Phagmodrupa declined and they were eclipsed by the Rinpungpa ({{bo|w=rin spungs pa}}) of Tsang, who patronized the Karma Kagyu.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5787">'''Phenomenological description''' is a method of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. A phenomenological description attempts to depict the structure of first person lived experience, rather than theoretically explain it. This method was first conceived of by [[Edmund Husserl]]. It was developed through the latter work of [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Immanuel Levinas]] and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] — and others. It has also been developed through recent strands of modern psychology and cognitive science.

== Early proponents ==
=== Edmund Husserl ===
Husserl originally conceived of and developed the method of phenomenological description. A Husserlian description uncovers or discloses the structures and forms of conscious experience. A Husserlian description typically begins by describing an actual experience in the first person. For example, in ''The Phenomenology of the Consciousness of Internal Time'' Husserl describes the phenomenon of being conscious of an individual, actual tone.&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, E. ''On the Phenomenology of the Consciousness of Internal Time.'' Klumer Academic Publishers: Dordrecht. Translated by John Barnett Brough. pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; This description is "a typical example of Husserl's descriptive... method".&lt;ref&gt;Farber, M. (1943) ''The Foundation of Phenomenology.'' State University of New York Press: Albany. p. 516.&lt;/ref&gt; Another good example of Husserl describing the structure of a conscious experience is his description of the act of naming his inkpot, provided in the ''[[Logical Investigations (Husserl)|Logical Investigations]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, E. ''The Shorter Logical Investigations'', Taylor &amp; Francis. Translated by [[John Niemeyer Findlay|J. N. Findlay]], 2001. p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

However, although Husserl's descriptions may begin at this basic level, they are often considerably more lengthy, involved and complex. For example, they often range from descriptions of the singular and empirical to descriptions of the essential and universal. Husserlian descriptions often depict the essential or invariant structures of conscious experience. For example, immediately after he describes the singular example of naming his inkpot in ''Logical Investigations'' he proceeds to describe the phenomenon of naming at the more general, invariant and essential level.&lt;ref&gt;Husserl (2001), pp. 291–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Martin Heidegger ===
Heidegger's explication of phenomenological description is sketched out in the Introduction to ''[[Being and Time]].''&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, Martin. ''[[Being and Time]].'' Trans. John Macquarrie and Edward Robinson. New York: Harper Press, 1962 [1927].&lt;/ref&gt; There he argues that the way to best approach the question of the meaning of Being is to examine the concrete ways in which phenomena show themselves in themselves — as they seem in consciousness. By examining the way phenomena immediately present themselves, we can get insight into how revealing as such occurs. For Heidegger, truth is always revealing — ''[[aletheia]]''. Important to note is that Heidegger's method of phenomenology is that it represents a new tradition of "hermeneutic phenomenology" as opposed to merely descriptive, as in the Husserlian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;L. Finlay. "Debating Phenomenological Research Methods." ''Phenomenology &amp; Practice.'' Vol. 3, No. 1, 2009, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jean-Paul Sartre ===
Sartre's ''Nausea'' gives immediate first-person accounts of the main character Antoine Roquentin's lived experience. He describes the way objects lose their meaning and nausea disturbingly creeps up on him unexpectedly. His worst encounter is in a park with a tree root, where he realizes the gift (and burden) of human freedom as compared to other non-conscious beings. Sartre vividly characterizes what appears in the foreground of Antoine's awareness, including all of the ambiguity and confusion that is usually abstracted away in traditional or [[realism (arts)|realist]] novels.

== Later research ==
Phenomenological description has found widespread application within psychology and the cognitive sciences. For example, Maurice Merleau-Ponty is the first well known phenomenologist to openly mingle the results of empirical research with phenomenologically descriptive research. Contemporarily, diverse theorists such as [[Shaun Gallagher]], Dieter Lohmar, Natalie Depraz and [[Francisco Varela]] fall under the broad umbrella of what's being termed "hybrid" theorists, drawing on both phenomenological description and research from modern cognitive science.

According to L. Finlay (2009),
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Phenomenological research characteristically starts with concrete descriptions of lived situations, often first-person accounts, set down in everyday language and avoiding abstract intellectual generalizations. The researcher proceeds by reflectively analyzing these descriptions, perhaps idiographically first, then by offering a synthesized account, for example, identifying general themes about the essence of the phenomenon. Importantly, the phenomenological researcher aims to go beyond surface expressions or explicit meanings to read between the lines so as to access implicit dimensions and intuitions.&lt;ref&gt;L. Finlay, 2009, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Schmicking (2010) itemizes the aspects involved in approaching any particular phenomenon:

* Detecting and grasping (''[[Nachgewahren]]'').
* Analyzing.
* Describing (including everyday, technical, and symbolic languages).&lt;ref&gt;Schmicking, Daniel. "A Toolbox of Phenomenological Methods." ''Handbook of Phenomenology and Cognitive Science.'' Eds. S. Gallagher and Daniel Schmicking. New York: Springer, pg 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philippe Van Parijs''' ({{IPA-fr|filip vɑ̃ paʁɛjs|lang}}; born 23 May 1951) is a Belgian political philosopher and political economist, best known as a proponent and main defender of the concept of a [[basic income]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euractiv.com/sections/social-europe-jobs/van-parijs-unconditional-basic-income-europe-will-help-end-crisis-301503&lt;/ref&gt; and for the first systematic treatment of linguistic justice.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Van Parijs, [[Linguistic Justice for Europe and for the World]], Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Philippe Van Parijs studied [[philosophy]], [[law]], [[political economy]], [[sociology]] and [[linguistics]] at the [[Saint-Louis University, Brussels|Université Saint-Louis - Bruxelles]] in [[Brussels]], at the [[Université catholique de Louvain]] (UCLouvain) in [[Louvain-la-Neuve]], at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]] (KU Leuven) in [[Leuven]], in [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[Bielefeld University|Bielefeld]] and [[University of California, Berkeley|California]] ([[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]). He holds doctorates in the [[social science]]s (Louvain, 1977) and in philosophy (Oxford, 1980).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uclouvain.be/en-11688.html "Philippe Van Parijs"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213751/http://www.uclouvain.be/en-11688.html |date=27 September 2007 }}, at uclouvain.be (in English)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He is professor at the Faculty of Economic, Social and Political Sciences of the Université catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain), where he directs the [[Hoover Chair]] of Economic and Social Ethics since its creation in 1991. He was a Visiting Professor at [[Harvard University]]'s Department of Philosophy from 2004 to 2011, and has been a Visiting Professor at the [[Higher Institute of Philosophy]] of the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]] since 2006, and a senior research fellow at Nuffield College, Oxford, since 2011.

Van Parijs has also held visiting positions at the Universities of [[University of Amsterdam|Amsterdam]], [[University of Manchester|Manchester]], [[University of Siena|Siena]], [[Université du Québec à Montréal|Québec]] ([[Montréal]]), [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|Wisconsin]] ([[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]]), [[University of Maine|Maine]] (Orono) and [[Aix-Marseille University|Aix-Marseille]], the [[European University Institute]] ([[Florence]]), the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] (Moscow), the [[Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro|Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]], the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]] (Beijing), the Catholic Faculties of [[Kinshasa]] (Congo), [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls College]] (Oxford), [[Yale University]], [[Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris|Sciences Po]] (Paris), the [[Universidad Católica del Uruguay Dámaso Antonio Larrañaga|Catholic University of Uruguay]], the [[Autonomous University of Barcelona]] and the [[École Normale Supérieure]] (Paris).

He is one of the founders of the [[Basic Income Earth Network|Basic Income European Network]] (BIEN), which became in 2004 the [[Basic Income Earth Network]], and he chairs its International Board.&lt;ref&gt;http://basicincome.org/about-bien/&lt;/ref&gt; He coordinates the Ethical Forum of the [[University Foundation]]. He also coordinates the [http://www.paviagroup.be/ Pavia Group]  with [[Kris Deschouwer]] and, with Paul De Grauwe, the [http://www.rethinkingbelgium.eu/ Re-Bel initiative]. He is a member of Belgium's [[The Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium|Royal Academy of Sciences, Letters and Fine Arts]], of the [[International Institute of Philosophy]], and of the [[European Academy of Sciences and Arts]] and fellow of the [[British Academy]]. In 2001, he was awarded the [[Francqui Prize]], Belgium's most generous scientific prize.

== Work ==

=== Basic income ===
In ''Real Freedom for All: What (if anything) can justify capitalism?''&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Van Parijs, Real Freedom for All, What (if anything) can justify capitalism: Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; (1995) he argues for both the justice and feasibility of a [[basic income]] for every citizen. Van Parijs asserts that it promotes the achievement of a [[real freedom]] to make choices. For example, he purports that one cannot really choose to stay at home to raise children or start a business if one cannot afford to. As proposed by Van Parijs, such freedom should be feasible through taxing the scarce, valued social good of jobs, as a form of [[income redistribution]].

=== Linguistic justice ===
Another part of Van Parijs' work is about linguistic justice. In order to address the injustice arising from the privilege enjoyed by English as a global ''[[lingua franca]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290060830_A_Lingua_Franca_as_Condition_for_Global_Justice_Philippe_Van_Parijs_on_Linguistic_Justice|title=A Lingua Franca as Condition for Global Justice? Philippe Van Parijs on Linguistic Justice|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; he discusses a wide range of measures such as a [[language tax]]&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Van Parijs, [http://www.uclouvain.be/cps/ucl/doc/etes/documents/DOCH_122_%28PVP%29.pdf Europe's three language problems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228083819/http://www.uclouvain.be/cps/ucl/doc/etes/documents/DOCH_122_(PVP).pdf |date=28 December 2013 }}, Multilingualism in Law and Politics&lt;/ref&gt; which would be paid by English-speaking countries, a ban on the dubbing of films, and the enforcement of a linguistic territoriality principle that would protect weaker languages.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Van Parijs, [http://global.oup.com/academic/product/linguistic-justice-for-europe-and-for-the-world-9780199208876 Linguistic Justice for Europe and for the World], Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Parijs's work is sometimes associated with the [[September Group]] of [[analytic Marxism]], though he is not himself a Marxist.

      <comment>/* History */ Maja Wollman was not a student of Joseph Pilates. Her own website, manta.com, claims she trained with "Authentic Beverly Hills Celebrity Trainer" and that she has been teaching Pilates for 26 years, so since 1992. She is too young to have studied with Joseph, who died in 1968. Her inclusion in this list of first-generation teachers must be someone's idea of a joke.</comment>

'''Pilates''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ɪ|ˈ|l|ɑː|t|ɪ|z}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/pronunciation/british/Pilates|title=Pilates – pronunciation of Pilates by Macmillan Dictionary|accessdate=8 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108074933/http://www.macmillandictionary.com/pronunciation/british/Pilates|archivedate=8 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-de|piˈlaːtəs|lang}}) is a [[physical fitness]] system developed in the early 20th century by [[Joseph Pilates]], after whom it was named. Pilates called his method "Contrology".&lt;ref name=Contrology/&gt; It is practiced worldwide, especially in Western countries such as [[Canada]], the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. As of 2005, there were 11 million people practicing the discipline regularly and 14,000 instructors in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/21/business/21sbiz.html | title = Now Let Us All Contemplate Our Own Financial Navels | last = Ellin | first = A. | publisher = New York Times | date = 21 June 2005 | accessdate = 2007-09-20 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090417074115/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/21/business/21sbiz.html | archivedate = 17 April 2009 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is only limited evidence to support the use of Pilates to alleviate [[low back pain]],&lt;ref name=Cochrane-LBP-2015/&gt; or improve balance in elderly people. Evidence from studies show that while Pilates improves balance, limited data exists on whether this impacts on falls by the elderly. &lt;ref name=Barker/&gt; Pilates has not been shown to be an effective treatment for any medical condition.&lt;ref name=aus17/&gt; There is some evidence regular Pilates sessions can help muscle conditioning in healthy adults, when compared to doing no exercise.&lt;ref name=campos/&gt;

If practiced with consistency, Pilates improves flexibility, builds strength and develops control and endurance in the entire body.&lt;ref name="mayo"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/pilates-for-beginners/MY01377| title = Pilates for Beginners: Explore the Core of Pilates| last = Mayo Clinic Staff| first = | publisher = Mayo Clinic| year = 2012| accessdate = 2012-11-04| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120918231344/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/pilates-for-beginners/MY01377| archivedate = 2012-09-18| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It puts emphasis on alignment, breathing, developing a strong [[Core (anatomy)|core]], and improving coordination and balance. The core, consisting of the muscles of the abdomen, low back, and hips, is often called the "powerhouse" and is thought to be the key to a person's stability.&lt;ref name="Houglum"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Houglum|first1=Peggy|title=Therapeutic Exercise for Musculoskeletal Injuries|date=2016|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=9781450468831|pages=297–299|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pilates' system allows for different exercises to be modified in range of difficulty from beginner to advanced or to any other level, and also in terms of the instructor and practitioner's specific goals and/or limitations. Intensity can be increased over time as the body adapts itself to the exercises.&lt;ref name=mayo/&gt;

== History ==
Pilates was developed by Joseph Pilates, from [[Mönchengladbach]], Germany. His father was a gymnast and his mother a [[naturopath]].  &lt;!--It is widely claimed on the internet that Joseph Pilates studied Yoga, but there is no evidence for this in his writings, or in the accounts of his students or the people who knew him.{{cn|date=October 2017}}--&gt;

During the first half of the twentieth century, he developed a system of exercises which were intended to strengthen the human mind and body. Pilates believed that mental and physical health were interrelated.&lt;ref name="Lange"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lange|first1=Claudia|last2=Unittham|first2=Viswanath|last3=Larkham|first3=Elizabeth|last4=Latta|first4=Paula|title=Maximizing the benefits of Pilates-inspired exercise for learning functional motor skills|journal=Journal of Movement and Bodywork Therapies|date=April 2000|volume=4|issue=2|pages=99–108|doi=10.1054/jbmt.1999.0161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his youth he had practised many of the physical training regimes available in Germany, and it was from these he developed his own method. It has clear connections with the [[physical culture]] of the late nineteenth century, such as the use of special [[Sports equipment|apparatuses]] and claims that the exercises could cure ill health. It is also related to the tradition of "corrective exercise" or "medical gymnastics" as typified by [[Pehr Henrik Ling]].

Pilates said that the inspiration for his method came to him during World War One, while he was being held at the [[Knockaloe internment camp]] on the Isle of Man&lt;ref name="knockaloe.im"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knockaloe.im/profile_428812.html|title=Joseph Pilates  - Knockaloe - Isle of Man|author=|date=|website=www.knockaloe.im|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020191252/http://www.knockaloe.im/profile_428812.html|archivedate=20 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He developed his method there for four years, working on his fellow internees &lt;ref name="knockaloe.im"/&gt;.  

Joseph Pilates accompanied his method with a variety of equipment, for which he used the term "apparatus". Each apparatus was designed to help accelerate the process of [[stretching]], [[strengthening]], [[body alignment]] and increased core strength started by the mat work. The best-known and most popular apparatus today, the Reformer, was originally called the Universal Reformer, aptly named for "universally reforming the body". Eventually Pilates designed other apparatus, including the Cadillac, Wunda Chair, High "Electric" Chair, Spine Corrector, Ladder Barrel and Pedi-Pole.&lt;ref name="Lange" /&gt;

Pilates published two books related to his training method: ''Your Health: A Corrective System of Exercising That Revolutionizes the Entire Field of Physical Education'' in 1934, and ''Return to Life Through Contrology'' in 1945.

His first students went on to teach his methods, including: [[Romana Kryzanowska]], Kathy Grant, Jay Grimes, [[Ron Fletcher]], Mary Bowen, Carola Treir, Bob Seed, [[Eve Gentry]], Bruce King, Lolita San Miguel, and Mary Pilates, Joseph's niece. Contemporary Pilates includes both the "Modern" Pilates and the "Classical/Traditional" Pilates. Modern Pilates is partly derived from the teaching of some first generation students, while Classical Pilates aims to preserve the original work as Joseph Pilates taught it.

==Principles==
A number of versions of Pilates are taught today and the majority are based on up to nine principles.&lt;ref name="Houglum" /&gt; [[Philip Friedman|Frank Philip Friedman]] and Gail Eisen, two students of Romana Kryzanowska, published the first modern book on Pilates, ''The Pilates Method of Physical and Mental Conditioning'', in 1980 and in it they outlined six "principles of Pilates".&lt;ref name="Eisen"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pilates Method of Physical and Mental Conditioning|last=Philip Friedman and Gail Eisen|first2=|year=2004|pages=13–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; These have been widely adopted—and adapted—by the wider community. The original six principles were concentration, control, center, flow, precision, and breathing.

===Breathing===
[[File:Pilates-yhden-jalan-ojennus.jpg|alt=Pilates one leg stretch|thumb|One leg stretch, classic Pilates movement]]
Breathing is important in the Pilates method. In ''Return to Life'', Pilates devotes a section of his introduction specifically to breathing "bodily house-cleaning with [[Circulatory system|blood circulation]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Return to Life'', p.&amp;nbsp;12ff&lt;/ref&gt; He saw considerable value in increasing the intake of oxygen and the circulation of this oxygenated blood to every part of the body. This he saw as cleansing and invigorating. Proper full inhalation and complete exhalation were key to this.&lt;ref name=Eisen/&gt; He advised people to squeeze out the lungs as they would wring a wet towel dry.&lt;ref name=Contrology/&gt; In Pilates exercises, the practitioner breathes out with the effort and in on the return.&lt;ref name=Eisen/&gt; In order to keep the lower abdominals close to the spine; the breathing needs to be directed laterally, into the lower [[Human rib cage|rib cage]]. Pilates breathing is described as a posterior lateral breathing, meaning that the practitioner is instructed to breathe deep into the back and sides of his or her rib cage. When practitioners exhale, they are instructed to note the engagement of their deep abdominal and pelvic floor muscles and maintain this engagement as they inhale. Pilates attempts to properly coordinate this breathing practice with movement.

===Concentration===
Pilates demands intense focus, the way that exercises are done is more important than the exercises themselves.&lt;ref name=Eisen/&gt;

===Control===
[[File:Pilates-hundred-sata.jpg|thumb|Pilates-hundred-sata]]
"Contrology" was [[Joseph Pilates]]' preferred name for his method, and it was based on the idea of muscle control.&lt;ref name=Eisen/&gt; All exercises are done with control, the muscles working to lift against gravity and the resistance of the springs and thereby control the movement of the body and the apparatus.&lt;ref name=Eisen/&gt;

===Centering===
For practitioners to control their bodies, they must have a starting place: the center. The center is the focal point of the Pilates method.&lt;ref name=Eisen/&gt; Many Pilates teachers refer to the group of muscles in the center of the body—encompassing the abdomen, lower and upper back, hips, buttocks, and inner thighs—as the "powerhouse". All movement in Pilates should begin from the center and move outward to the limbs.

===Flow===
Pilates aims for elegant economy of movement, creating flow through the use of appropriate transitions. Once precision has been achieved, the exercises are intended to flow within and into each other in order to build strength and stamina. In other words, the Pilates technique asserts that physical energy exerted from the center should coordinate movements of the extremities.&lt;ref name=Eisen/&gt;

===Postural alignment===
Using correct posture while doing Pilates exercises improves safety by correcting muscle imbalances and optimizing coordination.&lt;ref name="Houglum" /&gt;

===Precision===
Precision is essential to correct Pilates.&lt;ref name=Contrology/&gt; The focus is on doing one precise and perfect movement, rather than many halfhearted ones.  Here Pilates reflects common physical culture wisdom, gaining more from a few energetic efforts than from many listless ones.&lt;ref&gt;Barnarr MacFadden, ''Muscular Power and Beauty'', chap VI, p.&amp;nbsp;47&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is for this precision to eventually become second nature and carry over into everyday life as grace and economy of movement.&lt;ref name=Contrology/&gt;

===Relaxation===
Correct muscle firing patterns and improved mental concentration are enhanced with relaxation.&lt;ref name="Houglum" /&gt;

===Stamina===
With increased precision, motion becomes more efficient so there is less stress to perform the exercises.&lt;ref name="Houglum" /&gt;

==Effectiveness==
In 2015 the [[Department of Health (Australia)|Australian Government's Department of Health]] published a meta study which reviewed the existing literature on 17 alternative therapies including Pilates, in order to determine if any were suitable for being covered by [[health insurance]]. The review found that due to the small number and methodologically limited nature of the existing studies, the effectiveness of Pilates is uncertain.&lt;ref name="aus17"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/0E9129B3574FCA53CA257BF0001ACD11/$File/Natural%20Therapies%20Overview%20Report%20Final%20with%20copyright%2011%20March.pdf|title=Review of the Australian Government Rebate on Natural Therapies for Private Health Insurance|year=2015|publisher=Australian Government &amp;ndash; Department of Health|pages=110–118|format=PDF|author=Baggoley C|laysummary=https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/australian-review-finds-no-benefit-to-17-natural-therapies|lay-source=Gavura, S.

For the treatment of lower back pain, low quality evidence suggests that while Pilates is better than doing nothing, it is no more effective than other forms of physical exercise.&lt;ref name="Lim"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lim EC, Poh RL, Low AY, Wong WP |title=Effects of Pilates-based exercises on pain and disability in individuals with persistent nonspecific low back pain: a systematic review with meta-analysis |journal=J Orthop Sports Phys Ther |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=70–80 |year=2011 |pmid=20972339 |doi=10.2519/jospt.2011.3393 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cochrane-LBP-2015&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yamato TP, Maher CG, Saragiotto BT, Hancock MJ, Ostelo RW, Cabral CM, Menezes Costa LC, Costa LO |title=Pilates for low back pain |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=7 |issue= |pages=CD010265 |year=2015 |pmid= |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010265.pub2 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010265.pub2/full}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence regular sessions can help with the conditioning of the abdominal muscles of healthy people, when compared to doing no exercise.&lt;ref name=campos&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Campos RR, Dias JM, Pereira LM, Obara K, Barreto MS, Siva MF, Mazuquin BF, Christofaro DG, Fernandes RA, Iversen MD, Cardoso JR |title=The effect of the Pilates method on the physical conditioning of healthy subjects: a systematic review with meta-analysis |journal=J Sports Med Phys Fitness |volume= 56|issue= |pages= 864–73|year=2015 |pmid=26004043 |type=Systematic review}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no good evidence it helps improve balance in elderly people.&lt;ref name=Barker&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barker AL, Bird ML, Talevski J |title=Effect of pilates exercise for improving balance in older adults: a systematic review with meta-analysis |journal=Arch Phys Med Rehabil |volume=96 |issue=4 |pages=715–23 |year=2015 |pmid=25511371 |doi=10.1016/j.apmr.2014.11.021 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
Pilates is an [[Regulation|unregulated]] method of exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = PMA Quick Facts - Pilates Method Alliance| accessdate = 2015-07-30| url = http://www.pilatesmethodalliance.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageID=3295#regulated| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024130/http://www.pilatesmethodalliance.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageID=3295#regulated| archivedate = 2016-03-04| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2000 "Pilates" was ruled a generic term by a U.S. federal court, making it free for unrestricted use.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. District Court &amp;ndash; Southern District of NY, ''Opinion 96 civ. 43 (MGC) October 2000'', [http://www.pilates.com/resources/aboutpilates/pilates-decision.pdf pilates.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the court ruling, the Pilates Method Alliance was formed as a professional association for the Pilates community. Its purpose was to provide an international organization to connect teachers, teacher trainers, studios, and facilities dedicated to preserving and enhancing the legacy of Joseph H. Pilates and his exercise method by establishing standards, encouraging unity, and promoting professionalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About the PMA|url = http://www.pilatesmethodalliance.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3278|publisher = Pilates Method Alliance|accessdate = 2015-11-28|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208123708/http://www.pilatesmethodalliance.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3278|archivedate = 2015-12-08|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rodolfo Mondolfo''' (August 20, 1877 – July 15, 1976) was an Italian philosopher who lived in Italy and Argentina.

Born in [[Senigallia]] into a prominent family of [[Jews|Jewish]] origin, he studied at [[University of Florence]] and the [[University of Siena]]. In 1910 he started teaching at [[University of Turin]] where he worked until 1914, when he left for [[University of Bologna]] and later at the [[University of Padova]].

Due to the enactment of racial laws he left Italy in 1938 and was exiled in Argentina. There he worked as a professor at [[National University of Córdoba]] and [[National University of Tucumán]]. At the end of World War II he could have returned to Italy, but he preferred to stay in Argentina.

He died in [[Buenos Aires]].

'''Rupert Spira''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|p|aɪ|r|ə}} (born March 13, 1960) is an international teacher of the [[Advaita Vedanta]] ''direct path method'' of spiritual self enquiry, and an [[England|English]] [[studio potter]]. He first studied [[pottery]] with Henry Hammond and later with [[Michael Cardew]] at [[Wenford Bridge Pottery]] from 1980 to 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sculpture.uk.com/artists/rupert_spira/ NewArtCentre. Rupert Spira&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pottery==
[[Image:Spira left.JPG|thumb|200px|Medium size open poem bowl (43cm x 38cm x 12 cm)]]
[[Image:Spira left white.JPG|thumb|200px|Medium white glaze bowl (35cm x 26cm x 14cm)]]

Spira's early pottery work was reminiscent of these early influences being in a very traditional [[Bernard Leach]] style. This work is mostly practical in nature taking the form of [[teapot]]s, functional vases and other culinary ware.

He later moved to set up his own pottery in [[Shropshire]] where his style changed from a functional to a more minimalistic style. While he continues to make and sell functional pottery he is now known for his more recent [[studio pottery]]. His best and most recognizable work contains poems, both self written and by [[Kathleen Raine]] the celebrated British poet. The poems are either scratched into the glaze in the [[sgraffito]] style or written as embossed letters either in a square block or in a single line across the surface of the vessel.&lt;ref name="scva.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.scva.org.uk/exhibitions/archive/?exhibition=32 Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts - Exhibitions - Archive&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; These works vary in size from prayer bowls only a few centimetres across through to huge open bowls 50&amp;nbsp;cm or more in diameter. He is also known for his cylinders which are often made as part of a series and while beautiful in their own right were made to be exhibited as a group. These also vary in scale from a few centimetres in height through to the largest being a meter or more high. He works mainly in simple white, off white and black minimalistic colors but he does also occasionally make deep redly glazed bowls and very distinguishable yellow tea sets.

His work can be found in many galleries throughout Britain including the V&amp;A and Sainsbury collection as well as in many private collections worldwide.

== Spiritual teaching==
Spira is also a spiritual teacher and writer in the branch of [[Nondualism|nonduality]] ([[Advaita]], in [[Sanskrit]]), exploring the nature of experience in his essays and texts. He has published several books (see below), and a few DVDs with interviews. He holds regular meetings and retreats in the UK, Europe and the US.

One of his talks about nonduality is included in the video game ''[[The Witness (2016 video game)|The Witness]]''.

During her education, she developed a desire to unite scholars from all over the world from varying fields. In 1941, she put together the Science of Culture Series, hoping to develop a "unitary principle under which there could be subsumed and evaluated the nature of man and the nature of life, the relationship of knowledge to life."

{{about|the Sant Mat origins in the 13th century|contemporary movements claiming a Sant Mat lineage|Contemporary Sant Mat movements}}

'''''Sant Mat''''' was a spiritual movement that gained some importance in the Indian subcontinent in the 13th century CE. The name literally means "teachings of sants", i.e. mystic saints. By association and seeking truth by following ''[[Sant (religion)|sants]]'' and their teachings, a movement was formed. Theologically, the teachings are distinguished by inward, loving devotion by the individual soul (''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|atma]]'') to the Divine Principal God (''Parmatma''). Socially, an [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] understanding stands separate from qualitative distinctions of the [[Caste system in India|Hindu caste system]], and to those between [[Hindu]]s and [[Muslim]]s.&lt;ref name=Woodhead&gt;{{cite book|title=Religions in the modern world: traditions and transformations|date=2001|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-21784-9|pages=71–2|edition=Reprint.|editor=Linda Woodhead|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lineage of ''sants'' can be divided into two main groups: a northern group from the provinces of [[Punjab region|Punjab]], [[Rajasthan]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]], who expressed themselves mainly in [[vernacular]] Hindi; and a southern group, whose language is archaic [[Marathi language|Marathi]], represented by [[Namdev]] and other sants of [[Maharashtra]].&lt;ref name="Woodhead" /&gt;

==Etymology==
The expression ''Sant Mat'' literally means "Teachings of the Saints" – the "Path of Sants (Saints)", "Path of Truth", "Right or Positive Path". As "point of view of the Sants", the term ''Sant'' is pivotal. Derived from the [[Sanskrit]] ''[[Sat (Sanskrit)|sat]]'' ({{lang|sa|सत}}) and has overlapping usages (true, real, honest, right). Its root meaning is "one who knows(is) the truth" or "one who has experienced (merged into) Ultimate Reality." The term ''sant'' has taken on the general meaning of "a good person" but is properly assigned to the poet-sants of medieval India.&lt;ref name=Schomer&gt;Schomer, Karine, ''The Sant Tradition in Perspective'', in ''Sant Mat: Studies in a Devotional Tradition of India'' in Schomer K. and McLeod W. H. (Eds.) {{ISBN|0-9612208-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2013}}

==The Sants==
The Sant Mat movement was not homogeneous, and consisted mostly of the ''sants'' own socio-religious attitudes, which were based on ''[[bhakti]]'' (devotion) as described in the [[Bhagavad Gita]].&lt;ref name=Lipner&gt;Lipner, Julius J. ''Hindus: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices'' (1994). Routledge (United Kingdom), pp. 120-1 . {{ISBN|0-415-05181-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharing as few conventions with each other as with the followers of the traditions they challenged, the ''sants'' appear more as a diverse collection of spiritual personalities than a specific religious tradition, although they acknowledged a common spiritual root.&lt;ref&gt;Gold, Daniel, ''Clan and Lineage amongst the Sants: Seed, Substance, Service'', in ''Sant Mat:Studies in a Devotional Tradition of India'' in Schomer K. and McLeod W. H. (Eds.). pp.&amp;nbsp;305, {{ISBN|0-9612208-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The boundaries of the movement were likely not sectarian and were devoid of [[Brahmin]] concepts of caste and liturgy. The poet-sants expressed their teaching in [[vernacular]] verse, addressing themselves to the common folk in oral style in [[Hindi]] and other dialects such as [[Marathi language|Marathi]]. They referred to the "Divine Name" as having saving power, and dismissed the religious rituals as having no value. They presented the idea that true religion was a matter of surrendering to God "who dwells in the heart".&lt;ref name=Lipner /&gt;

The first generation of north Indian ''sants'', (which included [[Kabir]] and [[Ravidas]]), appeared in the region of [[Benares]] in the mid–15th century. Preceding them were two notable 13th and 14th century figures, [[Namdev]] and [[Ramananda]]. The latter, according to Sant Mat tradition, was a [[Vaishnava]] ascetic who initiated Kabir, Ravidas, and other sants. Ramanand's story is told differently by his lineage of "Ramanandi" monks, by other ''sants'' preceding him, and later by the [[Sikhs]]. What is known is that Ramananda accepted students of all castes, a practice that was contested by the orthodox Hindus of that time. Sant Mat practitioners accept that Ramananda's students formed the first generation of ''sants''.&lt;ref name=Hees&gt;Hees, Peter, ''Indian Religions: A Historical Reader of Spiritual Expression and Experience'', (2002) p.&amp;nbsp;359. NYU Press, {{ISBN|0-8147-3650-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sants'' developed a culture of being close to marginalized humans in society including women, and the [[Dalit (outcaste)|untouchables]] (''Atishudras''). Some of the more notable ''sants'' include Namdev (d. 1350), [[Kabir]] (d. 1518), [[Nanak]] (d. 1539), [[Mira Bai]] (d. 1545), [[Surdas]] (d. 1573), [[Tulsidas]] (d. 1623), and [[Tukaram]] (d. 1650).

The tradition of the ''sants'' (''sant [[parampara]]'') remained non-sectarian, although a number of ''sant'' poets have been considered as the founders of sects. Some of these may bear the ''sant's'' name, but were developed after them by later followers such as [[Kabir Panth]], [[Dadu Dayal|Dadu Panth]], Dariya Panth, [[Advait Mat]], [[Sant Rajinder Singh Ji Maharaj#Science and spirituality|Science of Spirituality]] and [[Radhasoami]].&lt;ref name=vaudeville&gt;Vaudeville, Charlotte. "Sant Mat: Santism as the Universal Path to Sanctity" in ''Sant Mat: Studies in a Devotional Tradition of India'' in Schomer K. and McLeod W.H. (Eds.) {{ISBN|0-9612208-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a small minority of religious Hindus have formally followed Sant Mat, but the tradition has considerably influenced Hindus across sects and castes. [[Bhajans]] (devotional songs) attributed to past ''sants'' such as Mira Bai are widely listened to in India and in Hindu communities around the world. The ''sant'' tradition is the only one in medieval and modern India that has successfully crossed some barriers between Hindu and Muslim blocks. [[Julius J. Lipner]] asserts that the lives of many Hindus have been leavened by the religious teachings of the ''sants'', which he describes as liberating.&lt;ref name=Lipner /&gt;

The Sant Mat tradition refers to the necessity of a living human master, which is referred to with honorific titles such as ''[[satguru]]'', or perfect master.&lt;ref name="isbn0-914829-42-4"&gt;{{cite book |author=Lewis, James P. |title=Seeking the light: uncovering the truth about the movement of spiritual inner awareness and its founder John-Roger |publisher=Mandeville Press |location=Hitchin |year=1998 |isbn=0-914829-42-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diem, Andrea Grace, ''The Gnostic Mystery''. Tessler, Neil, ''Sophia’s Passion'', on-line.&lt;/ref&gt; medieval [[Sufi]] poets such as [[Shams Tabrizi]], [[Jalal al-Din Muhammad Rumi]] or [[Hafez]], as well as [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]] poets, are considered to have many similarities with the poet-sants of Sant Mat.&lt;ref name=Asani&gt;Alsani, Ali. ''Sindhi Literary Culture'', in Pollock, Sheldon I (Ed.) ''Literary Culture in History'' (2003), p.&amp;nbsp;637–8, University of California Press, {{ISBN|0-520-22821-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Radha Soami]] movement in North India is regarded as a repository of the tradition of the Sants and their teachings, as well as their approach to religious endeavours, and presents itself as a living incarnation of the Sant tradition. The most notable being [[Radhasoami Satsang Beas]], situated on the banks of the river Beas, whose current living master is [[Gurinder Singh]]. According to [[Mark Juergensmeyer]], that claim is also made by the [[Kabir_panth|Kabir-panthis]], the [[Satpanth|Satpanthis]], the [[Sikhs]] and other movements that continue to find the insights from the Sant tradition valid today.&lt;ref name=Juergensmeyer&gt;Juergensmeyer, Mark.

[[Prem Rawat]] and the [[Divine Light Mission]] ([[Elan Vital (organization)|Elan Vital]]) are considered to be part of the Sant Mat tradition by [[J. Gordon Melton]], Lucy DuPertuis, and [[Vishal Mangalwadi]], but that characterization is disputed by [[Ron Geaves]].&lt;ref&gt;Melton, J.

The '''semiotic square''', also known as the '''Greimas square''', is a tool used in structural analysis of the relationships between [[semiotic]] [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] through the opposition of concepts, such as feminine-masculine or beautiful-ugly, and of extending the relevant ontology.

The semiotic square, derived from Aristotle's logical [[square of opposition]], was developed by [[Algirdas J. Greimas]], a [[France|French]]-[[Lithuania]]n [[linguist]] and semiotician, who considered the semiotic square to be the elementary structure of meaning.

Greimas first presented the square in ''Semantique Structurale'' (1966), a book which was later published as ''Structural Semantics: An Attempt at a Method'' (1983).  He further developed the semiotic square with Francois Rastier in "The Interaction of Semiotic Constraints" (1968).

== Basic structure ==

The Greimas Square is a model based on relationships:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Structure
! Relationship Type
! Relationship Elements
|-
| Complex
| Contrary
| S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| Neutral
| Contrary
| ~S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ~S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| Schema 1
| Contradiction
| S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ~S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| Schema 2
| Contradiction
| S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ~S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| Deixes 1
| Implication
| ~S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| Deixes 2
| Implication
| ~S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|}

*S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = positive [[seme (semantics)|seme]]
*S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = negative seme
*S = complex axis (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
*~S = neutral axis (neither S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; nor S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
# The Semiotic Square is formed by an initial binary relationship between two contrary signs. S&lt;sub&gt;1 &lt;/sub&gt;is considered to be the assertion/positive element and S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the negation/negative element in the binary pair:
# The second binary relationship is now created on the ~S axis.  ~S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is considered to be the complex term, and ~S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the neutral term. This is where the principle of difference is brought into play: every element in a system is defined by its differences from the other elements. 
# In most modes of interpretation, the S-axis is a hyponym of the ~S-axis.  The ~S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; element combines aspects of S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and is also contradictory to S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; . The ~S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; element contains aspects of neither S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; nor S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; .
# Finally, the ~S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; element can be identified. Considered to be "always the most critical position and the one that remains open or empty the longest time, for its identification completes the process and in that sense constitutes the most creative act of the construction.".&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, Fredric. 1987. "Foreword." ''On Meaning: Selected Writings.'' Algirdas Julien Greimas. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press. pg. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==

Starting from a given opposition of concepts S1 and S2, the semiotic square entails first the existence of two other concepts, namely ~S1 and ~S2, which are in the following relationships:

* S1 and S2: opposition
* S1 and ~S1, S2 and ~S2: contradiction
* S1 and ~S2, S2 and ~S1: complementarity

The semiotic square also produces, second, so-called meta-concepts, which are compound ones, the most important of which are:

* S1 and S2
* neither S1 nor S2

For example, from the pair of opposite concepts masculine-feminine, we get:

* S1: masculine
* S2: feminine
* ~S1: not-masculine
* ~S2: not-feminine
* S1 and S2: masculine and feminine, i.e. hermaphrodite, gender-fluid
* neither S1 nor S2: neither masculine nor feminine, agender

== Styles of interpretation ==

The Greimas Square is a tool used within the system of semiotics.
*As such, one form of interpretation is to look at each of the elements: S1, S2, ~S1, and ~S2 as either developed by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] (bi-modal) or [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (tripartite) sign.
*In the Peircean system of semiotics, the [[interpretant]] becomes the representamen for another, interrelated sign. In this same way, each of the elements of the Semiotic Square (S1, S2, ~S1, and ~S2) can become an element in a new, interrelated square.
*Finally, Greimas suggests placing semiotic squares of associated meaning on top of one another to create a layered effect and another form of analysis and interpretation.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The square is a map of logical possibilities. As such, it can be used as a heuristic device, and in fact, attempting to fill it in stimulates the imagination. The puzzle pieces, especially the neutral term, seldom fall conveniently into place … playing with the possibilities of the square is authorized since the theory of the square allows us to see all thinking as a game, with the logical relations as the rules and concepts current in a given language and culture as the pieces".&lt;ref&gt;Katilius-Boydstun, Marvin. 1990. “The Semiotics of A.J. Greimas: An Introduction,” Litanus: Lithuanian Quarterly Journal of Arts and Sciences. 36(3).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Sergei Nikolaevich Bulgakov''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ʊ|l|ˈ|ɡ|ɑː|k|ə|f}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bulgakov "Bulgakov"]. ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-ru|Серге́й Никола́евич Булга́ков}}; {{OldStyleDate|28 July|1871|16 July}} – 13 July 1944) was a [[Russia]]n Orthodox Christian theologian, philosopher, and economist.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Sergei Nicolaevich Bulgakov was born on 16 July 1871 to the family of an [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] priest (Nikolai Bulgakov) in the town of [[Livny]], [[Oryol]] [[guberniya]], in Russia. The family provided Orthodox priests for six generations, beginning in the sixteenth century with his ancestor Bulgak, a [[Tatar peoples|Tatar]].&lt;ref&gt;[[George Vernadsky]], ''The Mongols and Russia'', Yale University Press (1943), p. 384&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Evtuhov, ''The Cross &amp; the Sickle: Sergei Bulgakov and the Fate of Russian Religious Philosophy'', Cornell University Press (1997), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judith Deutsch Kornblatt &amp; Richard F. Gustafson, ''Russian Religious Thought'', Univ of Wisconsin Press (1996), p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] [[Macarius Bulgakov]] (1816-1882), one of the major [[Eastern Orthodox]] theologians of his days, and one of the most important Russian [[church historian]]s, was a distant relative.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rowan Williams]], "General introduction" in Sergii Nikolaevich Bulgakov, ''Sergii Bulgakov: Towards a Russian Political Theology'', A&amp;C Black (1999), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied at Orel [[seminary]], then at [[Yelets]] [[gimnasium]]. In 1894 he graduated from the Law School of [[Moscow State University|Moscow University]], where he had also undertaken a serious study of [[political economy]].

During his study at the seminary Bulgakov became interested in [[Marxism]] and took part in the [[Legal Marxism]] movement. Under the influence of works of Russian religious thinkers ([[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]], etc.), in the course of his meetings and arguments with Leo Tolstoy he found his religious beliefs again. He wrote a book about his evolution (Sergey Bulgakov, ''From Marxism to [[Idealism]]'', 1903). Such an evolution was common for the Russian [[intelligentsia]] of the time, and he soon became one of their recognised ideologists. A primary contributor to the books ''Problems of Idealism'' (1902), ''Vekhi'', ''Problems of Religion'', ''About Vladimir Solovyev'', ''About the Religion of Leo Tolstoy'', ''The Religion of Solovyov's Philosophical Society'', he participated in the journals ''New Way'' (Новый Путь) and ''Questions of Life'' (Вопросы Жизни). He was a leader of the publisher ''Way'' (Путь, 1911–1917), where he printed many important works of contemporary Orthodox theology.

===From 1906 to 1922===
[[File:Sergey Bulgakov karikatura.jpg|thumb|100px|right|1907 caricature portraying Bulgakov as a member of the State Duma]]
In 1907 he was elected as an independent ''Christian Socialist'' to the [[State Duma of the Russian Empire#Second Duma|Second Duma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://yqyq.net/5485-Sergeiy_Nikolaevich_Bulgakov.html |title=Sergei Bulgakov » News from different disciplines |first= |last= |work=yqyq.net |year=2009 |accessdate=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published the important original monographs ''Philosophy of Economy''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bogatzky|first=Nikolay|year=2017|title=A "gung-ho" approach towards Sophic Economy|url=http://www.unwe.bg/uploads/Alternatives/Bogatzky_ea_en_br_1_2017-10.pdf|journal=Economic Alternatives|publisher=UNWE Publishing Complex|publication-place=Sofia|volume=Issue 1|pages= 160–186|issn=2367-9409|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; («Философия хозяйства» 1912) and ''Unfading Light'' («Свет Невечерний» 1917), in which he first offered his own teaching based on the combination of ''[[sophiology]]'' of [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]] and [[Pavel Florensky]], the later works of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling|Schelling]], and his own [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]]-based ideas about the Orthodox Christian faith.

In 1918, having returned to the Orthodox Church, he was ordained to the priesthood, and rose to prominence in church circles. He took part in the All-Russia [[Synod#Orthodox usage|Sobor]] of the Russian Orthodox Church that elected [[patriarch]] [[Tikhon of Moscow]]. Bulgakov rejected the [[October revolution]] and responded with ''On the Feast of the Gods'' ("На пиру богов", 1918), a book similar to the ''Three Talks'' of Vladimir Solovyov.

During the [[Russian Civil War]] he was in [[Crimea]], where he worked in the field of philosophy. He wrote books ''Philosophy of the Name'' ( "Философия имени", 1920) and ''Tragedy of Philosophy'' ("Трагедия философии", 1920) in which he revised his views about the relation of Philosophy to [[Dogmatism]]. He concluded that the Christian views can be expressed only by dogmatic theology. Thereafter his works were devoted to dogmatic theology.

On 30 December 1922 the Bolshevik government expelled some 160 prominent intellectuals on the so-called [[Philosophers' ship]], Bulgakov, [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], and [[Ivan Ilyin]] among them.

===Bulgakov in Paris===
In May 1923 he became professor of Church Law and Theology at the school of law of the ''Russian Research Institute'' in [[Prague]].

In 1925 he helped found [[St. Sergius Orthodox Theological Institute]] (''l'Institut de Théologie Orthodoxe Saint-Serge''), in [[Paris]], France. He was the head of this institute and Professor of [[Dogmatic Theology]] until his death from [[throat]] [[cancer]] on 12 July 1944. His last work was devoted to the [[Apocalypse]].

==Controversy==
Bulgakov’s teaching on [[sophiology]] is highly controversial. The attempt to understand it properly is hindered by the highly political controversy surrounding it in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;For commentary, texts and a fuller account of the sophiological controversy see Antoine Arjakovsky, ''Essai sur le père Serge Boulgakov (1871-1944), philosophe et théologien chrétien'' (Paris: Les Éditions Parole et Silence, 2006), pp. 99-125 and ''La génération des penseurs religieux de l’émigration Russe: La Revue ‘La Voie’ (Put’)'', 1925-1940 (Kiev/Paris:  L’Esprit et la Lettre,  2002), pp. 433 ff., N. T. Eneeva, Spor o sofiologii v russkom zarubezh’e 1920-1930 godov (Moscow: Institut vseobshchei istorii RAN, 2001), Igumen Gennadii (Eikalovich), Delo prot.

===Ecclesiastical situation in Russian Orthodoxy===
By 1931, there were three separate Russian Orthodox jurisdictions in Europe: the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia|Russian Church Abroad/Sremski Karlovtsy Synod]] (ROCA or ROCOR), under Met. [[Anthony (Khrapovitsky)]]; "Patriarchal" Church, answering ultimately to Met. [[Sergius I of Moscow]] and had the young [[Vladimir Lossky]] as a member and the Russian Church in Western Europe, Bulgakov’s own jurisdiction as well as the church of Georges Florovsky, under Met. [[Evlogy Georgievsky|Evlogy (Georgievsky)]], under the jurisdiction of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], in 1934, Met. Evlogy was privately reconciled to Met. Anthony, and in 1935, he went to [[Sremski Karlovci|Karlovtsy]] for a special reunion conference at which time the schism between him and ROCOR was healed.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Ware, ''The Orthodox Church'' (London: Penguin Books, 1964); p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, Met. Evlogy again cut his ties with ROCOR, quite possibly because of the controversy over Sophianism.&lt;ref&gt;Protopresbyter George Grabbe, "Toward a History of the Ecclesiastical Divisions Within the Russian Diaspora", in: ''Living Orthodoxy'', Vol. XIV, No. 4, July–August, 1992, pp. 37-39&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction to Bulgakov's writings===
[[File:Sbulgakov.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Father Sergey Bulgakov]]
In the Decree on Sophianism, an ukaz of 24 August 1935 of Met. Sergius, Bulgakov’s teaching on ‘Sophia’ was described as ‘alien’ to the Orthodox faith.&lt;ref&gt;Protopresbyter George Grabbe, ''Toward a History of the Ecclesiastical Divisions Within the Russian Diaspora'', In: Living Orthodoxy, Vol. XIV, No. 4, July–August, 1992, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; This ukaz was largely based on the epistolary reports of Alexis Stavrovsky. He was also the president of the Brotherhood of St Photius (Alexis Stavrovskii was president; Vladimir Lossky, the vice-president, and Evgraf Kovalevskii, later Jean-Nectaire Kovalevsky of Saint-Denis, were also among the 12-15 young laymen who made up its numbers) whose members had left the jurisdiction of Metropolitan Evlogy for that of Met. Elevthery of Lithuania. This exodus was in reaction to Met. Sergius having removed, on 10 June 1930, Met. Evlogy as the head of the Russian Orthodox Church in Western Europe (since Metropolitan Evlogy had continually refused to agree to the 30 June 1927 Declaration of Loyalty to the Soviet government) and named Elevthery as his replacement. In late 1935, Metropolitan Evlogy appointed a commission to look into the charges of heresy levelled against Bulgakov.

The commission quickly broke into factions. In June 1936 the majority report (prepared by Vasilii Zenkovskii, Anton Kartashov and others) rejected the charge of heresy but had serious objections about Sophiology. The minority report of 6 July 1936 was prepared by Fr Sergei Chetverikov and signed by Fr Georges Florovsky, who despite his personal respect for Fr. Sergius, remained an ardent critic of Sophianism for the remainder of his life. Meanwhile, the Church Abroad formally accused Bulgakov of heresy in 1935.

The 1935 decision of the Church Abroad was based on Archbishop Seraphim (Sobolev) of Boguchar’s ''Novoe uchenie o Sofii'' (Sofia, 1935), as well as on the arguments of St. [[John Maximovitch|John (Maximovitch)]].&lt;ref&gt;Protopresbyter George Grabbe, ''Toward a History of the Ecclesiastical Divisions Within the Russian Diaspora'', In: Living Orthodoxy, Vol. XIV, No. 4, July–August, 1992, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; St. John, in his book ''The Orthodox Veneration of the Mother of God'', discusses at length why the sophianism of Sergius Bulgakov is [[heresy]], specifically one as destructive as [[Nestorianism]]. Speaking of those who attempt to deify the Theotokos, he wrote: 
{{quote|In the words [of Fr. Sergius Bulgakov], when the Holy Spirit came to dwell in the Virgin Mary, she acquired "a dyadic life, human and divine; that is, She was completely deified, because in Her hypostatic being was manifest the living, creative revelation of the Holy Spirit" (Archpriest Sergei Bulgakov, ''The Unburnt Bush'', 1927, p. 154). "She is a perfect manifestation of the Third Hypostasis" (Ibid., p. 175), "a creature, but also no longer a creature" (P. 19 1)....But we can say with the words of St. Epiphanius of Cyprus: "There is an equal harm in both these heresies, both when men demean the Virgin and when, on the contrary, they glorify Her beyond what is proper" (Panarion, ''Against the Collyridians''). This Holy Father accuses those who give Her an almost divine worship: "Let Mary be in honor, but let worship be given to the Lord" (same source). "Although Mary is a chosen vessel, still she was a woman by nature, not to be distinguished at all from others. Although the history of Mary and Tradition relate that it was said to Her father Joachim in the desert, 'Thy wife hath conceived,' still this was done not without marital union and not without the seed of man" (same source). "One should not revere the saints above what is proper, but should revere their Master. Mary is not God, and did not receive a body from heaven, but from the joining of man and woman; and according to the promise, like Isaac, She was prepared to take part in the Divine Economy. But, on the other hand, let none dare foolishly to offend the Holy Virgin" (St. Epiphanius, "Against the Antidikomarionites"). The Orthodox Church, highly exalting the Mother of God in its hymns of praise, does not dare to ascribe to Her that which has not been communicated about Her by Sacred Scripture or Tradition. "Truth is foreign to all overstatements as well as to all understatements. It gives to everything a fitting measure and fitting place" (Bishop Ignatius Brianchaninov).&lt;ref&gt;St. John Maximovitch, {{cite web|url=http://www.ortodoks.dk/On_Orthodox_Veneration_of_the_Mary.htm |title=''The Orthodox Veneration of the Mother of God''}}, (Platina, Ca: St. Herman Press, 1978), p. 40 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Bulgakov's reply and the episcopal conference, 1937===
Bulgakov responded to the heresy accusation in his ''Dokladnaia zapiska Mitropolitu Evlogiiu prof. prot. Sergiia Bulgakova'' (Paris, 1936). Archbishop Seraphim then rebutted Bulgakov in his ''Zashchita sofianskoi eresi'' (Sofia, 1937). No final report was prepared on the sophiology controversy by the commission set up by Bulgakov's own jurisdiction. However, Metropolitan Evlogy convoked a bishops' conference on 26–29 November 1937 to bring closure to the matter. The bishops in their statement were working from reports by Archimandrite Cassian (Bezobrazov) and Chetverikov and they concluded that the accusations of heresy against Bulgakov were unfounded but that his theological opinions showed serious flaws and needed correction.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

===Inclined toward universalism===
Bulgakov in some respects sympathized with the doctrine of [[universal reconciliation]], with the reservation that the continuing punishment of the immortal souls of the wicked in hell may be unending since human free choice can never be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Sergeĭ Nikolaevich Bulgakov ''The Orthodox Church'' intro page xiii 1988 "God does not punish; he forgives. Sinful creatures may refuse His forgiveness. This refusal (which may be unending since human free choice can never be destroyed) makes hell to be hell. In a word, God has mercy on all, whether all like." See also S.N. Bulgakov, S. N. (1995). Apocatastasis and transfiguration : comprising his essay "On the question of the apocatastasis of the Fallen Spirits" (B. Jakim, Trans.). New Haven: Variable Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political views ===
There is conflict in the studies regarding how conservative Bulgakov was. A classmate of Bulgakov's said he had been called a "jingoistic monarchist" and that he did not attend discussion groups. Together with [[Petr Struve]], Bulgakov founded the illegal liberal Union of Liberation (which later emerged as the Constitutional Democratic (Kadet) Party, the largest party in Russia between 1906–1907), and was one of the key persons in the journal ''Liberation'' (1902–1905). Because of the circle's [[secularism]], which conflicted with Bulgakov's religious views, he left the society to join the [[liberal nationalist]] and [[Christian socialism|socio-Christian]] Union of Christian Politics. When that circle was dissolved Bulgakov was more active in the Orthodoxy, so his leanings became [[liberal conservative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sakwa|first=Richard|title=Russian politics and society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DIjtpGVRDdQC|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415227537}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Valliere|first=Paul|title=Bukharev, Soloviev, Bulgakov|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cx6mh3bi50oC|year=2000|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=9780567087553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shi Xing Mi''' (Walter Gjergja) is a Shaolin secular monk of the 32nd generation, speaker and writer.

==Biography==

===Early martial arts practice===

Walter Gjergja started studying [[Shaolin Kung Fu]] in his early teens in Italy and France, winning numerous international competitions in both forms (traditional Kung Fu and modern WuShu) and fighting (Sanda and Qingda/Quingda), initially in Europe (late 1980s) and later in Asia (early 1990s).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Shaolin masters' biography pages, Italy. http://www.culturashaolin.it&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further studies and work===

He then moved to Australia where from 1992 he attended Melbourne La Trobe University; he graduated in 1996 with a double major degree and, in parallel to his studies and then to a rapid career in management and consulting, traveled numerous times to the Shaolin monastery where he learned Shaolin culture in its entirety (Chan - philosophy, Wu - martial arts and physical training, Yi - health practices), specialising in philosophy and in several Shaolin martial arts such as Xiao Hong Quan, Da Hong Quan, Qi Xing Quan, Chang Hu Xin Yi Men Quan, Rou Quan and others.  He was eventually accepted as a 32nd generation Shaolin disciple with the monastic name Shi Xing Mi. The official discipleship ceremony was held in Shaolin Temple and presided by his master, [[Shaolin Kung Fu|Shaolin]] [[Grandmaster (martial arts)|Grand Master]] [[Shi De Yang]].&lt;ref&gt;Book 'Shaolin: a journey', published in 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Authors presentation by Italian publishers. https://www.macrolibrarsi.it/autori/_shi-xing-mi.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sk.ru"&gt;Skolkovo University. http://sk.ru/news/b/articles/archive/2016/06/10/tips-for-startups-from-a-shaolin-monk.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 2002 Shi Xing Mi returned to Italy and decided to teach full-time in Europe and Asia, subsequently appearing in television documentaries (BBC, Discovery Channel, Disney XD, Italia1, CCTV, Wild and the 2nd episode of the popular martial arts show "Kill Arman"), numerous press articles (Men's Health, Outside Magazine, Sportweek, Die Zeit, Kung Fu Magazine, For Men, Handelsblatt, Corriere Della Sera, Frankfurt Allgemeine, Budo, etc.), demonstrations and major events.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaolin press book pages, Italy. http://www.shaolin-wushu.it/press.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kung Fu Magazine Shaolin Specials, USA 2005 - 2006 - 2007 - 2009 - 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching===

In 2004 he founded in Milan the first Italian Shaolin culture center, Shaolin Wuseng Houbeidui Italy, today with several branches in Italy and Switzerland. Over the years he has taught in a dozen countries and has also been appointed to several official roles for the development of international Shaolin cultural projects, such as Shaolin Cultural Director for FIWUK (Federazione Italiana WuShu KungFu) and Shaolin Master member of SEA (Shaolin Europe Association).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaolin Europe Association members page. http://www.shaolin-europe.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008 he has also utilised his cultural and professional background to apply Shaolin principles and methods to diversified contexts such as human development, business management and sports performance, conducting keynote speeches, seminars and workshops at various international conferences (TEDx, FIBO, Trainertage, etc.) and for companies such as BMW, Bayer, Postbank, Red Bull, Siltronic, UBS, Kempinski, Merck, Technogym, Sberbank, Cheil, DWP Bank, Jaguar, Publicis and many more, as well as coaching professional sports people in football, tennis, winter sports and combat sports.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Official website. http://www.shaolinshixingmi.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper, Germany 05/2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Die Zeit newspaper, Germany 10/2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sk.ru"/&gt; 
In 2012 he published his first book, titled 'Shaolin: a journey', followed in 2014 by a philosophy and self-development book co-authored with a German trainer and writer titled 'Gib Nicht Alles, Gib Das Richtige' and subsequently translated in other languages as 'The Shaolin strategy'.&lt;ref&gt;Shaolin news pages, Italy. http://www.shaolin-wushu.it/news.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Random House Group. http://www.randomhouse.de/catalog/catalog.jsp?men=1500&amp;lbl=51000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alpina Russia.https://www.alpinabook.ru/catalog/GeneralManagment/337884/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 he published a new book, co-authored with Swiss trainer and coach, titled 'Shaoness'.&lt;ref&gt;Mondadori Electa. http://www.electa.it/en/product/shaoness/&lt;/ref&gt;

Shi Xing Mi (Walter Gjergja) lives in a village in Ticino, Switzerland, and teaches mostly in Europe and Asia.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

[[Image:Table-book, Lawes.jpg|thumb|right|A table-book printing from [[Henry Lawes]]' ''The treasury of musick: containing ayres and dialogues to sing to the theorbo-lute or basse-viol.'', 1669.]]
A '''table-book''' is a [[manuscript]] or printed book which is arranged so that all the parts of a piece of music can be read from it while seated around a table. They were made in the 16th and 17th century for both instrumental and vocal pieces. They are an extension of the idea of Choir books, in which all parts are displayed on one page, in contrast with [[partbook]]s, which have a different book for each part (one book for all the soprano parts, another for all the altos, etc.) and each performer has their own book. 

The first example of such a book is probably ''Le parangon des chansons'' (1538) by [[Jacques Moderne]] of [[Lyon]]. There are far more English than Continental examples of this type of book. English sources contain many lute pieces and works by [[John Dowland]], including his ''[[Lachrimae]]''. 

The books began displaying duets, and later quartets. Later systems of displaying parts worked for up to six performers, and in extreme cases as many as 12. 
[[Image:Tablebook.jpg|thumb|right|A more involved example, showing four parts and multiple verses]]

The publisher [[Peter Short (printer)|Peter Short]] published 30 [[lute song]] books in the table-book format, many of them containing Dowland's music, beginning in 1597.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~mlo26/printers.html Drexel.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Taoism}}

[[Taoism]] is believed to be the inspiration for spiritual concepts in [[Culture of Japan|Japanese culture]]. Taoism is similar to [[Shinto]] in that it also started as an [[indigenous religion]] in China, although it is more [[Hermeticism|hermetic]] than [[shamanism|shamanistic]].  Taoism's influence can be seen throughout the culture but to a lesser extent than [[Edo Neo-Confucianism|Confucianism]].

Taoism in the form it takes in Japan can be easily seen as superstitious or astrological and the concept of demons and spirits seem to have their roots in a Taoist influence such as [[Onmyōdō]] and [[Shugendō]]. The widely practiced ritual of ''[[setsubun]]'' (節分) where chanters repeat "Demons out!  Luck in!" has its base in Taoism and also touches on a relation to ''[[uchi-soto]]''. There is a culture of consultation where ''ogamiyasan'' are called upon to provide their Taoism based insight to bear upon events such as house-buildings. Taoism has a calendar whereby one can determine the best day, element and time should be chosen to color an event in the right light ([[Tengenjutsu (fortune telling)]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first = Joy | last = Hendry |title = Understanding Japanese Society| publisher = Routledge| location = Britain| year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The Japanese ''[[kanji]]'' for Taoism is 道教 (Dô-kyô). The root of this ''kanji'' is 道 (''michi'', way, path) + 教 (''kyō'', doctrine, teaching, education). ''Dô'' shares the same Chinese character as ''tao'', 道 which literally means "way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Kodansha's ''furigana'' Japanese Dictionary|  publisher = Kodansha Inc.| location = Japan| year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taoism in Japan==
According to a tale from the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'', a man named Tajima Mori set out to explore for the elixir of immortality and reached the Eternal Land, where he brought back the “fragrant fruit” to offer to his ruler; the latter turned out to be already dead so Tajima Mori followed suit. “Scholars have identified it as the immortals’ isles of ''Penglai'', and the ‘fragrant fruit’ as the mandarin orange".&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=EXVk1tr6lEYC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=daoism+handbook&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iHzJAScmVd&amp;sig=4oG8mud2A65TDaZdpwhF1IYlIAI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0HsGUIfBB4qsrAfUpIC-Bg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=daoism%20handbook&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal system of China was brought to Japan in the late 7th and early 8th centuries, specifically a Bureau of ''yin'' and ''yang'', the ''Ommyokan'', to handle affairs of time keeping, astronomy, dream interpretation and calendar calculation and ''yin-yang'' and the [[Five Phases]] cosmology. By the 10th century, it developed with rituals to cast away unlucky tendencies and this became known as the religious practice in Japan called ''inyodo'' or ''yin-yang'' divination.

Taoism also influenced ''[[Shugendo]]'', Japan’s shamanistic and mountain worship. It began in the 7th century and combined Buddhism, ''yin-yang'' divination, Shinto and Taoist elements. One spell of Taoistic influence is the “Come down, soldiers and fighters, and line up before me!” which is used to enter a holy mountain on certain days. Another ritual formula evident of Taoism is the “Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!” which can be seen in banners, talismans and roof tiles even today in Japan.

Taoist influences made their way even to Shinto, specifically [[Ise, Mie|Ise]] and [[Yoshida Shintō]], both of which developed in Kamakura in 1281. Shinto became one of Japan’s political doctrines in the early 20th century, known as the State Shinto. In 1950, the Society for the Research of Daoism was founded. In 1951, the Society published its first journal.

One of the Taoist practices in Japan is the ''[[Kōshin]]'' religion. ''Koshin'' refers to the 57th day of the 60-day calendar cycle, where three worms bringing death from the human body go to report of people’s sins in heaven. The worms then go back to the human body and shorten the people’s lifespan by causing illnesses and unhappiness. To avoid this, the Taoists stays awake the whole day and night and perform rituals. “The Koshin cult is the most obvious and best known instance of Taoism in Japan” &lt;ref&gt;Kohn, L. (1995). Taoism in Japan: Positions and evaluations. Cahiers d'Extrême-Asie, 8(8), 389-412. doi:10.3406/asie.1995.1103&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Veritatis splendor''''' ([[Latin]]: ''The Splendor of the Truth'') is an [[encyclical]] by [[Pope John Paul II]]. It expresses the position of the [[Catholicism|Catholic Church]] regarding fundamentals of the Church's role in moral teaching. The encyclical is one of the most comprehensive and philosophical teachings of moral theology in the Catholic tradition. It was [[Promulgation|promulgated]] on 6 August 1993.

And then the Ut unum sint on ecumenicalism, the moral encyclical Veritatis splendor, and the Fides et ratio… also the Catechism of the Catholic Church" http://www.30giorni.it/articoli_id_3545_l3.htm  Accessed  17 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Servais-Théodore Pinckaers]] a professor of moral theology at the [[University of Fribourg]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Romanus Cessario, "On the Place of Servais Pinckaers († 7 April 2008) in the Renewal of Catholic Theology," in: ''The Thomist,'' 73.1 (2009), 1-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
''Veritatis splendor'' responds to questions of [[Ethics in religion|moral theology]] that had been raised during the postconciliar period of the Church (events after the [[Vatican II]] ecumenical council of 1962-65). These questions revolve around man's ability to discern good, the existence of evil, the role of human freedom and human [[conscience]], [[mortal sin]], and the authority of the [[magisterium]] of the Catholic Church in guiding man. In response to these, Pope John Paul II emphatically says that moral truth is knowable, that the choice of good or evil has a profound effect on one's relationship with God, and that there is no true contradiction between freedom and following the good. ''Veritatis splendor'' consists of three chapters: (I) Teacher, What Good Must I Do; (II) Do Not Be Conformed to this World; and (III) Lest the Cross of Christ be Emptied of its Power.

===Response to moral relativism===
''Veritatis splendor'' begins by asserting that there are indeed absolute truths accessible to all persons. Contrary to the philosophy of [[moral relativism]], the encyclical says that moral law is universal across people in varying cultures, and is in fact rooted in the human condition. Pope John Paul teaches that no matter how separated someone is from God, "in the depths of his heart there always remains a yearning for absolute truth and a thirst to attain full knowledge of it." He goes on to say that the splendor of truth "shines forth deep within the human spirit."

===[[Moral authority]] of the Catholic Church===
Ultimately, John Paul teaches, "to ask about the good, in fact, ultimately means to turn towards God, the fullness of goodness." Against the idea that the Church's teaching body has a mainly exhortatory role, the pope reiterates the Catholic doctrine that the magisterium of the Catholic Church has authority to definitively pronounce on moral questions. Even more, John Paul teaches that the Church is Christ's particular response to help answer everyone's question of what is right and wrong.

===Human freedom and divine law===
John Paul teaches that there is no true conflict between human freedom and God's law. The true end of human freedom is growth as a mature person into how each is created by God. Furthermore, God's divine law governing human behavior is not opposed to human freedom, but rather "it protects and promotes that freedom."

The encyclical affirms that today's respect for human freedom "represents one of the positive achievements of modern culture." However, he cautions, though it is a good, human freedom is not in itself an absolute. Merely deciding for oneself that one may do something is not at all a true substitute for determining whether something is in fact good or bad. Because God is the true author of good, it remains of critical importance to understand how the divine Law, as expressed by the authoritative magisterium of the Church, considers an issue before determining absolutely for oneself.

===Natural law===
The pope welcomes and supports the role of human reason in discovering and applying the natural law (those aspects of the moral law that may be discovered without divine revelation). Nevertheless, because God remains the true author of moral law, he states that human reason will not properly supersede the elements of the moral law that are of divine origin—the encyclical states that this "would be the death of true freedom." In particular, John Paul denies those ideas of morality that treat the human body as a "raw datum," separating man and how he uses his body from his greater meaning derived from the entirety of his person.

===The judgment of conscience===
John Paul reiterates the longstanding Catholic teaching that people are obliged to follow their [[conscience]], and that if they do not, they are condemned by their own conscience.

John Paul depicts conscience as a form of inner dialogue. However, he says, it is not merely a dialogue of a man with himself, but it is very much a dialogue between man and God. Following [[Bonaventure]], John Paul likens conscience to a herald from God who proclaims the divine law. In opposition to how it is often represented elsewhere, John Paul says that conscience is emphatically not a replacement for the divine law. Rather, it is the process by which a person may apply the divinely revealed law to the concrete situation at hand.

''Veritatis splendor'' states that because conscience may err in its judgment, a person is obliged to do his best to inform his conscience. Hence, it remains crucial for a person to make an effort to understand what the divine law on a matter is, as expressed by the Church, and the reasons behind it. Even if a person is not condemned by his conscience for a morally wrong act, committing that act nevertheless causes damage in other ways, and if done habitually it can progressively make it harder for a person to perceive the truth. Furthermore, habitual sin enslaves us, so following a wrong judgment of conscience is in the end a step away from freedom.

===The "fundamental option," sin, and salvation===
The encyclical also responds to the idea of the "fundamental option." In this way of thinking, a man's particular actions do not necessarily affect his ultimate salvation—what is important is his fundamental orientation towards or against God. The pope writes:

"There is no doubt that Christian moral teaching, even in its Biblical roots, acknowledges the specific importance of a fundamental choice which qualifies the moral life and engages freedom on a radical level before God. It is a question of the decision of faith, of the obedience of faith (cf. Rom 16:26) "by which man makes a total and free self-commitment to God, offering 'the full submission of intellect and will to God as he reveals' "."&lt;ref&gt;''Veritatis Splendor'', 66&lt;/ref&gt;

John Paul firmly opposes the theological assertion that such a fundamental choice can be separated from particular actions, stating that it is contrary to Scripture as well as to long-held Catholic teaching on sin and salvation. He also opposes it on philosophical grounds, writing, "To separate the fundamental option from concrete kinds of behaviour means to contradict the substantial integrity or personal unity of the moral agent in his body and in his soul."

John Paul emphasizes that the "fundamental option" view undermines the traditional Catholic understanding on [[mortal sin]] and [[venial sin]], their distinction, and effects: "For mortal sin exists also when a person knowingly and willingly, for whatever reason, chooses something gravely disordered.... The person turns away from God and loses charity."

===Reality of intrinsically evil acts===
The encyclical also says that certain acts are intrinsically  evil. In the language of Catholic moral theology, this means that certain acts are always wrong, and that there are never circumstances in which they may be permitted if done knowingly and intentionally. Stated another way, this is a strong support for the long-held doctrine of Catholic moral theology that "the ends do not justify the means." John Paul bases this on the argument that certain acts are so destructive to the human person that there are no extenuating circumstances that would allow them. As an example, John Paul specifically mentions the teaching of [[Pope Paul VI]] on contraception, which stipulates that although it is permissible to tolerate a lesser evil to prevent a greater one, or to promote a greater good, it is never permissible, even in the gravest of circumstances to intentionally do an evil so that good may come of it. Or in other words it is never permissible to intend directly something which contradicts a moral order. This reiterates  Paul VI's teaching on contraception, and that if an act is intrinsically evil, a good intention or particular circumstances can diminish their evil, but they cannot remove it.

=== Possibility of obeying the commandments ===
John Paul teaches that man can and must respect the norm of morality even in the most difficult situations: "Temptations can be overcome, sins can be avoided, because together with the commandments the Lord gives us the possibility of keeping them."&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', 102&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected the proposition that the Church's teaching is essentially only an "ideal" which must then be adapted to each case.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., 103&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Winona LaDuke''' (born August 18, 1959) is an American environmentalist, economist, and writer, known for her work on tribal land claims and preservation, as well as sustainable development.  In [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996]] and [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]], she ran for [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] as the nominee of the [[Green Party of the United States]], on a ticket headed by [[Ralph Nader]].

She is the executive director of [[Honor the Earth]], a Native environmental advocacy organization that plays an active role in the [[Dakota Access Pipeline protests]].&lt;ref name=NoDAPL&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.laprogressive.com/protesting-dakota-access-pipeline/ |title=What Would Sitting Bull Do?|date= August 25, 2016|accessdate=November 17, 2016|quote=|author=Winona LaDuke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
[[File:Winona laduke.jpg|thumb|left|Winona Laduke in earlier years]]
Winona (meaning "first daughter" in [[Dakota language]]) LaDuke was born in 1959 in Los Angeles, California, to [[Betty LaDuke|Betty Bernstein]] and Vincent LaDuke (later known as [[Sun Bear (author)|Sun Bear]]&lt;ref name="Ritter"&gt;[https://archive.is/20131227025140/http://www.citypages.com/2000-10-11/news/the-party-crasher/3/ Peter Ritter, "The Party Crasher"], ''Minneapolis News'', October 11, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;). Her father was from the [[Ojibwe]] [[White Earth Reservation]] in [[Minnesota]], and her mother of Jewish European ancestry from the Bronx, New York. Though LaDuke spent some of her childhood in Los Angeles, she was primarily raised in [[Ashland, Oregon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wweek.com/editorial/3237/7789 Willamette Week | "Winona Laduke" | July 19th, 2006&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827152733/http://www.wweek.com/editorial/3237/7789 |date=August 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to her father's heritage, she was enrolled with the Ojibwe Nation at an early age, but she did not live at [[White Earth Indian Reservation|White Earth]], or on any other reservation, until 1982. She started work at [[White Earth Indian Reservation|White Earth]] after she graduated college, when she got a job there as principal of the high school.&lt;ref name="Ritter"/&gt;

After her parents married, Vincent LaDuke worked as an actor in Hollywood, with supporting roles in [[Western movie]]s, while Betty LaDuke completed her academic studies. The couple separated when Winona was five, and her mother took a position as an art instructor at Southern Oregon College, now [[Southern Oregon University]] at [[Ashland, Oregon|Ashland]], which was then a small logging and college town near the California border.&lt;ref name="Ritter"/&gt; In the 1980s, LaDuke's father Vincent reinvented himself as a [[New Age]] spiritual leader and went by the name Sun Bear.&lt;ref name="Ritter"/&gt;

While growing up in [[Ashland, Oregon|Ashland]], LaDuke attended public school and was on the debate team in high school. She attended [[Harvard University]], where she became part of a larger group of Indian activists, and graduated in 1982 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[Economics]] (rural economic development).&lt;ref name="Ritter"/&gt; When LaDuke moved to [[White Earth Indian Reservation|White Earth]] she did not know the [[Ojibwe language]], or many people, and was not quickly accepted. While working as the principal of the local Minnesota reservation high school she completed research for her master's thesis on the reservation's subsistence economy and became involved in local issues. She completed an M.A. in Community Economic Development through the distance-learning program of [[Antioch University]].&lt;ref name="Ritter"/&gt;

==Career and activism==
[[File:Reception (4099192018) (cropped).jpg|thumb|LaDuke in 2009]]
While working as a principal at the high school, LaDuke became an activist. In 1985 she helped found the [[Indigenous Women's Network]]. She worked with [[Women of All Red Nations]] to publicize American [[Forced sterilization in the United States|forced sterilization]] of Native American women.

Next she became involved in the struggle to recover lands for the [[Anishinaabe]]. An 1867 treaty with the United States had originally provided a territory of more than 860,000 acres for the [[White Earth Indian Reservation]]. Under the [[Nelson Act of 1889]], an attempt to have the [[Anishinaabe]] assimilate by adopting a European-American model of subsistence farming, communal tribal land had been allotted to individual households. The US classified any land in excess as surplus, allowing it to be sold to non-natives. In addition, many [[Anishinaabe]] sold their land individually over the years; these elements resulted in the tribe's losing control of most of its land. By the mid-20th century, the tribe held only one-tenth of the land within its reservation.&lt;ref name="Ritter"/&gt;

In 1989, LaDuke founded the [[White Earth Land Recovery Project]] (WELRP) in Minnesota with the proceeds of a human rights award from [[Reebok]]. The goal is to buy back land within the reservation that had been bought by non-Natives and to create enterprises that provide work to [[Anishinaabe]]. By 2000, the foundation had bought 1200 acres, which it held in a conservation trust for eventual cession to the tribe.&lt;ref name="Ritter"/&gt;

The non-profit is also working to reforest the lands and a revive cultivation of [[wild rice]], long a traditional food. It markets that and other traditional products, including [[hominy]], jam, buffalo sausage and other products. It has started an Ojibwe language program, a herd of [[American Bison|buffalo]], and a wind-energy project.&lt;ref name="Ritter"/&gt;

LaDuke is also Executive Director of [[Honor the Earth]], an organization she co-founded with the non-Native folk-rock duo, the [[Indigo Girls]] in 1993. The organization's mission is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''to create awareness and support for Native environmental issues and to develop needed financial and political resources for the survival of sustainable Native communities. Honor the Earth develops these resources by using music, the arts, the media, and Indigenous wisdom to ask people to recognize our joint dependency on the Earth and be a voice for those not heard''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.honorearth.org/about|title=About Us|work=Honor The Earth|access-date=2017-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

LaDuke was selected by [[The Evergreen State College]] Class of 2014 to be a keynote speaker and delivered her address at the school's graduation on June 13, 2014.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In 2016, LaDuke was involved in the [[Dakota Access Pipeline protests]], participating at the resistance camps in North Dakota as well as speaking to the media on the issue.&lt;ref name="DN-Sep4-16"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2016/9/4/dakota_access_pipeline_company_attacks_native|title=VIDEO: Dakota Access Pipeline Company Attacks Native American Protesters with Dogs and Pepper Spray|date=September 4, 2016|website=democracynow.org|publisher=[[Democracy Now!]]|access-date=September 11, 2016|quote=|author=Amy Goodman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political career===
In 1996 and 2000, LaDuke ran as the vice-presidential candidate with [[Ralph Nader]] on the [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] ticket. She was not endorsed by any tribal council or other tribal government. LaDuke endorsed the Democratic Party ticket for the president and vice-president in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/ictarchives/2004/10/20/winona-laduke-endorsement-of-john-kerry-for-president-94117 |title=Winona LaDuke endorsement of John Kerry for president|date= October 20, 2004|accessdate=October 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.minnpost.com/politics-policy/2008/05/laduke-and-lessons-she-learned-nader|title=LaDuke and the lessons she learned with Nader|publisher=Minnesota Post|date=May 22, 2008|accessdate=October 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puvzO5vjesw|title=Winona LaDuke on Presidential Politics (7:41)|accessdate=October 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[Robert Satiacum, Jr.]], a [[faithless electors in the United States presidential election, 2016|faithless elector]] from Washington cast his presidential vote for [[Dakota Access Pipeline protests|Native American activist]], [[Faith Spotted Eagle]]; he then cast his vote for Vice President for Winona LaDuke, making her the first Native American woman to receive an [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] vote for Vice President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-faith-spotted-eagle-2016-story.html |title=How Faith Spotted Eagle became the first Native American to win an electoral vote for president |publisher=LA Times |date= |accessdate=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==White Earth Land Recovery Project==
{{main|White Earth Land Recovery Project}}
WELRP has worked to revive cultivation and harvesting of wild rice, a traditional food of the Ojibwe people. It produces and sells traditional foods and crafts through its label, Native Harvest.&lt;ref name=NPR-Rice&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4165045&amp;from=mobile "Ricing Time: Harvesting on the Lakes of White Earth"], ''[[National Public Radio]].'' 12 November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honor the Earth==
{{main|Honor the Earth}}

Members of Honor the Earth are active in the [[Dakota Access Pipeline protests]].&lt;ref name=NoDAPL/&gt;

== Hemp activism ==
LaDuke has begun a 40 acre industrial hemp farm in Minnesota on the White Earth Indian Reservation, dedicated to growing hemp from different regions of the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://inthesetimes.com/rural-america/entry/21083/industrial-hemp-native-american-tribes-winona-laduke|title=In These Times- The Renaissance of Tribal Hemp|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to vegetables and tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newsmaven.io/indiancountrytoday/news/winona-laduke-announces-her-hemp-and-heritage-farm-is-coming-alive-_iMHVEHjEkObJeMqKOxIZA/|title=Winona LaDuke announces her Hemp and Heritage Farm is coming alive - IndianCountryToday.com|work=IndianCountryToday.com|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; LaDuke has advocated for the growth of both marijuana and industrial hemp on tribal lands as moneymaking opportunities for tribal communities; this position is controversial, however, as when the Oglala Sioux Tribe attempted this they were raided by the DEA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.indianz.com/News/2015/03/05/winona-laduke-consider-marijua.asp|title=Winona LaDuke: Consider Marijuana and Hemp for Indian Country|last=|first=|date=March 5, 2015|website=Indianz|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic title}}
'''''World Hypotheses: a study in evidence''''' (also known as '''''World Hypotheses: Prolegomena to systematic philosophy and a complete survey of metaphysics''''') is a book written by [[Stephen Pepper]], published in 1942.

In ''World Hypotheses'', Pepper demonstrates the error of [[logical positivism]], that there is no such thing as data free from interpretation, and that root metaphors are necessary in epistemology.  In other words, objectivity is a myth because there is no such thing as pure, objective fact.  Consequently, an analysis is necessary to understand how to interpret these 'facts.'  Pepper does so by developing the "[root metaphor method, ...] and outlines what he considers to be four basically adequate world hypotheses (world views or conceptual systems): formism, mechanism, contextualism, and organicism." He identifies the strengths and weaknesses of each of the world hypotheses as well as the paradoxical and sometimes mystifying effects of the effort to synthesize them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.sunyit.edu/~harrell/Pepper/Index.htm Pepper's home page]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dogmatism==
Pepper begins by demonstrating the very weak positions of utter [[skepticism]] and [[dogmatism]] while explaining that each are essentially two sides of the same coin.  He has no problem with relative skepticism, where one suspends belief until justification is provided.  But utter skepticism is essentially a dogmatist who doubts all things, always.  Pepper defines a dogmatist "as one whose belief exceeds his cognitive grounds for belief." &lt;ref&gt;Pepper, S.C., (1942).  World Hypotheses: A study of evidence, University of California Press, Berkeley, Los Angeles and London.&lt;/ref&gt;  If neither position of utter skepticism and dogmatism are cognitively justifiable, then knowledge about the world will be somewhere in between. Specifically, between '''Common Sense''' and '''Refined Knowledge'''.

==Evidence==
There is a tension between '''Common Sense''' and '''Refined Knowledge'''.  Common sense is ubiquitous and ever present, and therefore gives a strong sense of certainty.  But once you reflect upon common sense, it is no longer common sense and has moved into the realm of refined knowledge.  To a large extent, the philosophy of science, and science in general, is interested in this shift.

Once you embark into refined knowledge, there are certain criteria as to what constitutes 'evidence.'  In other words, there are rules governing how we know what we know (This should be recognized as an [[epistemological]] concept).  And depending on the choice of your '''Root Metaphor''' (described below), different criteria exist as to what constitutes good evidence.

==World Hypotheses==
Pepper presents two types of World Hypotheses.

'''Inadequate Hypotheses'''
*[[Mysticism]]
*[[Animism]]

'''(Relatively) adequate Hypotheses'''
*[[Formism]]
**Immanent formism
**Transcendent formism
*[[mechanism (philosophy)|Mechanism]]
**Discrete mechanism
**Consolidated mechanism
*[[Contextualism]]
*[[Organicism]]

==Jargon==
*'''dubitanda:''' Pepper's jargon for Common Sense
*'''data:''' Pepper's jargon for '''Multiplicative Corroboration''', which simply refers to repeated empirical observation.  If two people read a thermometer and agree on the reading, there has been '''Multiplicative Corroboration.'''  In layman's terms, we call this data.
*'''danda:''' Pepper's jargon for Structural Corroboration, which in layman's terms is similar to '''Logical Data'''.
