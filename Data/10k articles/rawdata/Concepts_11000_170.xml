The '''2011 Crosstown Shootout brawl''', nicknamed '''The Crosstown Punch-Out''', was a [[bench-clearing brawl]] that took place at the end of the 2011 edition of the [[Crosstown Shootout]] [[college basketball]] game between the [[University of Cincinnati]] [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Bearcats]] and the [[Xavier University]] [[Xavier Musketeers men's basketball|Musketeers]].  The game took place on December 10, 2011 at Xavier's home arena, the [[Cintas Center]] in [[Norwood, Ohio|Norwood]].

==Background==
The Crosstown Shootout has always been one of the more intense rivalries in college basketball, all the more so because Xavier and UC are only two miles ({{convert|2|mi|disp=output only}}) apart. There has always been a fair amount of [[trash talk]] between the two schools, and the 2011 game was no different. On December 8, UC guard [[Sean Kilpatrick]] told Andy Furman of [[WCVX|WQRT]] that Xavier's All-American guard [[Tu Holloway]] probably wouldn't start for the Bearcats "with the players that we have now."&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Shannon. [http://cincinnati.com/blogs/xavier/2011/12/08/kilpatrick-holloway-wouldnt-start-at-uc Kilpatrick: Holloway wouldn't start at UC]. [[Cincinnati Enquirer]], 2011-12-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

The series had developed a history of bad blood in the years leading up to the 2011 Crosstown Shootout.&lt;br&gt;
In '''2008''', a total of ''six'' technicals were called in a 76-66 XU win.  XU's Derrick Brown was ejected, and two freshman post players were involved in an altercation that included a heavy dose of foreshadowing: XU's [[Kenny Frease]] head-butted UC's [[Yancy Gates]] (both players received technicals).  The altercation between Frease and Gates in 2008 set the tone for bad blood between the two, and may have motivated Gates to seek revenge in 2011.&lt;br&gt;
In '''2009''', multiple verbal exchanges resulting in UC clearing their bench as well as technicals called on XU's [[Jordan Crawford]] and UC's Rashad Bishop in XU's double overtime win.&lt;br&gt;
In '''2010''', Xavier's Tu Holloway received a technical foul for throwing an elbow late in UC's 66-46 win.&lt;br&gt;

==The brawl==
The game was close at first, with eight ties and six lead changes in the first half. Xavier led 34-25 at halftime.&lt;ref name=Enquirergamestory&gt;Russell, Shannon. [http://news.cincinnati.com/article/20111210/SPT0102/312100035 Brouhaha mars Xavier's 76-53 win against UC at Cintas Center]. [[Cincinnati Enquirer]], 2011-12-11.&lt;/ref&gt; The first sign of trouble occurred in the closing seconds of the first half, when Bearcat backup [[Octavius Ellis]] began exchanging some words with Xavier player [[Mark Lyons]] from the bench. Ellis jumped up from the bench to confront Lyons, and the two players had to be separated. Before the start of the second half, according to Xavier coach [[Chris Mack (basketball)|Chris Mack]], both teams were warned that any further incident would result in [[technical foul]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Zac. [http://www.foxsportsohio.com/12/10/11/Xavier-UC-rivalry-hits-rock-bottom/landing.html?blockID=623940&amp;feedID=3725 Xavier-UC rivalry hits rock bottom]. [[Fox Sports Ohio]], 2011-12-11.&lt;/ref&gt; The Musketeers started the second half on a 9-2 run and were never seriously threatened afterward.&lt;ref name=APESPN&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=313442752 Bench-clearing melee halts end of Xavier's rout of Cincinnati]. [[Associated Press]] via [[ESPN]], 2011-12-10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ultimately, the Musketeers outscored the Bearcats 42-28 in the second half.&lt;ref name=Enquirergamestory/&gt;

With 18.6 seconds remaining, [[Tu Holloway]] scored a layup to give the Musketeers the 76-53 lead. As Holloway walked to the other end of the court, he began shouting at the Bearcat bench, bringing UC's Ge'Lawn Guyn over to confront him, leading to an argument between both men. As Guyn reached for Holloway's throat, Xavier's [[Dezmine Wells]] intervened by pushing Guyn to the ground,&lt;ref name=APESPN/&gt; causing UC's [[Yancy Gates]] to throw the ball at Holloway's head, and both benches to empty. In the ensuing fight, Gates punched Xavier's Kenny Frease in the face, opening up a large cut under Frease's left eye and knocking him to the ground. As Frease tried to crawl away from the crowd, UC's Cheikh Mbodj stomped on the back of his head. Ellis threw a punch at Lyons, causing him and Wells to throw several back, before coaches got in between them. This brought Gates over, who began shouting and throwing more punches at a Xavier backup, until Xavier assistant [[Aaron Williams (basketball)|Aaron Williams]] and Lyons calmed him down.&lt;ref name=Highlights&gt;[http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=7339298 ESPN highlights of game]&lt;/ref&gt; Referees Michael Roberts, Jeff Anderson, and Tony Crisp ended the game with 9.4 seconds remaining, giving Xavier the 76-53 win. UC's Gates and Mbodj, and Xavier's Wells were retroactively ejected from the game for fighting. Under NCAA rules, they were suspended for their next game, a sanction that cannot be appealed.

Immediately following the incident, both sides were escorted to the tunnels at either end of the court so that they would enter their respective locker rooms. However, due to the chaos of the brawl, both teams entered through the tunnels opposite from where they were supposed to go. This would have resulted in another confrontation in the hallways beneath the Cintas Center stands as both teams would have had to cross each other in the narrow hallway leading to their locker rooms. To avoid this, the Xavier team was corralled into the south tunnel leading out of the main arena. Once the UC players were off the court and had filed through the north tunnel to their locker room, the Xavier players were brought back out and began celebrating with the remaining fans and students still in the stands. This however resulted in an incident between the Xavier players and the Cincinnati fans who began yelling obscenities at one another. Security again had to get involved to keep the two groups away from each other.

==Aftermath==
UC coach [[Mick Cronin (basketball)|Mick Cronin]], angry at how his players behaved, ordered them to take off their jerseys in the locker room, and in some cases physically took them off. In his postgame comments, a visibly angry Cronin said that he told his players not to put them on again "until they have a full understanding of where they go to school and what the university stands for and how lucky they are to even be there, let alone have a scholarship." He also hinted that several players could face suspensions, and possibly dismissal from the team, saying that he was going to review the tape with school president [[Gregory H. Williams]] and athletic director Whit Babcock "and decide who's going to be on my team going forward." He also appeared to blame the referees for not taking control of the situation sooner (threats of technicals after the first-half incident notwithstanding), saying that Musketeer players were yelling at his bench for the whole game and even cursing at his coaches. Cronin said he tried to call a time out before the brawl broke out so the players could go to their respective benches, but couldn't get the officials' attention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gobearcats.com/allaccess/?media=273285 Mick Cronin postgame comments]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the postgame interview, Holloway claimed the Bearcats had "disrespected" his teammates in the run-up to the game. He also said, "We went out there and zipped them up at the end of the game." He also added that he and his teammates considered themselves "gangsters, not thugs, but tough guys on the court." Lyons added, "If somebody puts their hand in your face or tries to do something to you, where we're from you're gonna do something back."&lt;ref name=Highlights/&gt;

Later that night, Cronin spoke with [[ESPN]]'s [[Andy Katz]] and reiterated that there would be additional suspensions coming. "Nobody is going to walk on our side," he said. He also said this was the most embarrassing moment of his coaching career. Mack was somewhat more restrained in his remarks, saying he wasn't "in a position to be a decision maker," but that his players needed to learn "how to handle themselves and not let that happen again." 
Earlier, Mack had tweeted, "If my players say they've been taught to be tough their whole life, they mean ON THE FLOOR. Nothing else is condoned."&lt;ref name=ESPN&gt;[[Andy Katz|Katz, Andy]]. [http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/7339184/cincinnati-bearcats-coach-embarrassed-brawl-xavier-musketeers Penalties pending after Cincinnati brawl]. [[ESPN]], 2011-12-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both schools' presidents issued statements condemning the brawl. UC's Williams strongly supported Cronin's postgame remarks, saying that the brawl was "not what we expect of representatives of the University of Cincinnati" and that school officials would "act swiftly and firmly" to ensure it never happened again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gobearcats.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/121011aaa.html Statement on brawl from UC president Gregory Williams]&lt;/ref&gt; Xavier's [[Michael J. Graham]] called the brawl "unsportsmanlike" and apologized to Xavier's fans and "the entire Cincinnati community."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goxavier.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/121011aaa.html Statement from Xavier president Michael J. Graham]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Big East Conference (1979–2013)|Big East Conference]] and [[Atlantic 10 Conference]], the home conferences for UC and Xavier respectively at the time, also condemned the brawl and promised to hand down additional suspensions if they felt the schools haven't acted harshly enough.&lt;ref name=ESPN/&gt;

On December 11, both schools announced suspensions for the players involved. UC suspended Gates, Mbodj and Ellis for six games each, and Guyn for one game. Cronin said that the four players would still have to earn their way back onto the team even after they serve out their suspensions.  At the very least, Cronin said, they would have to sincerely apologize on camera and complete several other unspecified tasks. Xavier suspended Wells and Landen Amos for four games, Lyons for two and Holloway for one.  Xavier athletic director Mike Bobinski also apologized for Holloway and Lyons' postgame remarks. Mack said that Holloway was suspended specifically for his postgame comments, and admitted that neither he nor Lyons should have been before the media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/7341744/cincinnati-bearcats-suspend-four-players-brawl-xavier-musketeers Cincinnati, Xavier reveal suspensions]. [[ESPN]], 2011-12-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 11, Mack, Holloway, Lyons and Xavier Athletic Director Mike Bobinski all apologized for what occurred.  Mike Bobinski said, "It was an embarrassment. It was a disappointment at every level. We take full responsibility for the role that we played in those events and are resolved to whatever is necessary to see to it that it never happens again."&lt;ref name="cincinnati.com"&gt;[http://cincinnati.com/blogs/xavier/2011/12/11/bobinski-mack-holloway-apologize/]&lt;/ref&gt; Tu Holloway also apologized for post game comments saying, "Myself, I used the wrong choice of words. I represent Xavier University, my family and myself and I really apologize for what took place."&lt;ref name="cincinnati.com"/&gt;

On December 12, an emotional Gates apologized for his actions, saying they were "not what my family is about."  Guyn, Ellis and Mbodj also apologized.&lt;ref&gt;Koch, Bill. [http://cincinnati.com/blogs/uc/2011/12/12/tearful-yancy-gates-uc-apologize-for-role-in-xaiver-game Tearful Yancy Gates, UC apologize for role in Xavier game]. [[Cincinnati Enquirer]], 2011-12-12.&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, [[Hamilton County, Ohio]] prosecutor [[Joe Deters]] said he was considering filing criminal charges related to the brawl.  Under Ohio law, Deters' office would handle the case if the charges rose to the level of felonies; Cincinnati city solicitor John Curp would prosecute if they are only misdemeanors. There is no known instance of criminal charges being filed as a result of a brawl at an NCAA game.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Kimball.[http://news.cincinnati.com/article/20111212/SPT0101/312120055 Prosecutors explore possible criminal charges for UC, Xavier]. [[Cincinnati Enquirer]], 2011-12-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, Deters announced he would not file charges. He also indicated that Gates and Frease had "reached out to each other privately", and that Frease was satisfied with a personal apology from Gates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/7352151/no-charges-cincinnati-bearcats-xavier-musketeers-brawl-prosecutor-says |title=Prosecutor: No charges in brawl |author=Associated Press |work=ESPN.com |date=December 14, 2011 |accessdate=December 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On that same day XU athletic Director Mike Bobinski used head coach Chris Mack's radio show to again apologize and take questions from fans concerning the incident.

On December 18, prior to Xavier's game against Oral Roberts, Mack took the floor again to apologize for the incident that had occurred in the previous game. Mack said, "We were all embarrassed by our behavior last weekend," and added, "It's extremely disappointing and in no way was a representation of what our university and our basketball program is all about."&lt;ref&gt;[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/college/mensbasketball/story/2011-12-18/xavier-oral-roberts-holloway-lyons/52049068/1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Partly due to the incident, Xavier and UC officials decided to move the game to [[U.S. Bank Arena]] for at least the next two seasons and rename it the Crosstown Classic. Player and fan behavior was extensively reevaluated after the 2013 game, and was said to be a major factor in the decision to continue the series beyond the 2013–14 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cincinnati.com/article/20120521/SPT01/305210101/Exclusive-Crosstown-Shootout-set-U-S-Bank-Arena  |title=Exclusive: Crosstown Shootout set for U.S. Bank Arena |first=Bill |last=Koch |newspaper=The Cincinnati Enquirer |date=May 22, 2012 |accessdate=May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crosstown Shootout Gets New Name, Venue|url=http://www.wlwt.com/news/sports/Crosstown-Shootout-to-get-new-name-venue/-/9837968/14860932/-/oofsoq/-/index.html|publisher=[[WLWT]]|date=14 June 2012|access-date=2012-12-14|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130209090751/http://www.wlwt.com/news/sports/Crosstown-Shootout-to-get-new-name-venue/-/9837968/14860932/-/oofsoq/-/index.html|archive-date=2013-02-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 12, 2014, the two schools announced a 10-year agreement to continue the series, alternating between campuses, and to revert the name of the series back to the Crosstown Shootout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Xavier, UC reach 10-year agreement to continue Crosstown Shootout, with rivalry returning to campuses |url=http://www.xavier.edu/news/Xavier-UC-reach-10-year-agreement-to-continue-Crosstown-Shootout-with-rivalry-returning-to-campuses.cfm#.VNmKWJ_X-_Q |website=xu.edu|publisher=Xavier University|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Atheist Centre''' is an institution founded by [[Goparaju Ramachandra Rao]] (aka '''Gora''', 1902–1975) and [[Saraswathi Gora]] (1912–2006) to initiate social change in rural [[Andhra Pradesh]] based on the ideology of [[Gandhism]] and [[Atheism]]. Founded in 1940 at Mudnur village in [[Krishna district]] in Andhra Pradesh, India the Centre was later shifted to [[Vijayawada]] in 1947.
As a member organisation of the [[Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations]], the Atheist Centre endorses the [[Amsterdam Declaration 2002]].The institution received the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]]'s International Humanist Award in 1986 for pioneering in the field of social work.
After the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Indian Ocean tsunami]], the Atheist Centre worked with the [[Institute for Humanist Studies]] to provide aid to the victim of the disaster.&lt;ref name=tsunami&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. Humanists &amp; Indian Atheists Aid Tsunami Victims|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2005/01/prweb196161.htm|accessdate=5 September 2013|newspaper=PR Web|date=12 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Atheist Centre celebrated its platinum jubilee of 75 years on 5 January 2014. Gora's daughter Mythri is currently the Chairperson, and sons [[Lavanam]] and Vijyam continuing as Executive Directors of the Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/show-constructive-alternatives-to-youth/article5544245.ece|title=Platinum Jubilee of Atheist Centre, Vijayawada|date=6 January 2014|work=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secular social work==
With the guiding principles of Gora and his positive  atheism, Atheist Centre, India brought revolutionary changes in Indian social work. Born for the cause of social change with Gandhian principles, Atheist Centre, India initiated and continuing the social work for social change. Atheist Centre started its work from removal of untouchability in 1940s, Atheist Centre organised the cosmopolitan dinners and inter-caste marriages to annihilate the [[caste system in India|caste system]], exposing superstitious beliefs and promoting scientific temper and [[humanism]]. [[Mahatma Gandhi]] was impressed with Atheist Centre's work and interested
and met atheist Gora. Atheist Centre still continuing the legacy of Gora and [[Saraswathi Gora]] in carrying the comprehensive programmes of social as well as individual development for the transformation of society. Atheist Centre 
initiated social organisation '''Arthik Samata Mandal''', '''Vasavya Mahila Mandali'''  and '''Samskar'''. The first two were founded by Gora and '''Samskar''' was started in post-Gora period. '''Arthik Samata Mandali''' is involved in integrated rural development and specific programmes for children. It continues as one of the leading organisations in the field of disaster management. The organisation has specific emphasis on weavers  and tribal population. The eye camps and polio camps run by the organisation have been popular. '''Vasavya Mahila Mandali''' is involved in women's programmes like promotion of women groups for self-help, health programmes, working women's hostel, a shelter home for women with problems, an eye bank and AIDS control. The organisation is highly reputed for its women's counselling programmes in Andhra Pradesh.
'''Samskar (Reform)''' is an initiative of Atheist Centre’s work among the criminal tribes who are now known as denotified tribes.[[Lavanam]], Hemalata Lavanam and others  worked in the Criminal settlements of Andhra Pradesh and initiated
steps for criminal  reformation. Samskar also took up the programme for the eradication of the [[Jogini]] system, which is a remnant of  the [[Devadasi]] in [[Telangana]] region of AP. It is a heinous practice thrust on the poor untouchable women in the remote villages of the erstwhile [[Hyderabad State]]. Chelli Nilayam, Sister's Home, was founded at [[Varni]], in Nizamabad District in 1987 for the Jogins. All three organisations have their headquarters at Atheist Centre, [[Vijayawada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NGO to prevent flesh trade in Medak|url=http://www.hindu.com/2003/06/12/stories/2003061202980500.htm|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=June 12, 2003|accessdate=June 12, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==University and research centre==

On September 26, 2011, the Atheist Centre announced that it would open a university and research centre founded on the principles of Gora that would serve as India's first atheist university. It will not be affiliated with any conventional institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2487992.ece|title=Atheist varsity, research centre to open in Vijayawada|last=Susarla|first=Ramesh|date=26 September 2011|work=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=27 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atheist Centre has a library, with a good collection of books by Gora and his articles on atheism, still primary sources research on atheism, humanism and Gandhian philosophy.

==Books and publications==

''The Atheist'', an (English-language monthly magazine, was established in 1969. It carries articles on atheism, humanism, spirit of inquiry, and scientific reform through secular social work.{{Citation needed|date= September 2015}}

''Nasthika Margam'', a Telugu-language monthly, has been published since 1977. It deals with atheism, rationalism, and women's issues.{{Citation needed|date= September 2015}}

Humans are motivated to assign causes to their actions and behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Moskowitz, G. B. (2005). Social cognition: Understanding self and others. New York, NY: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[social psychology]], '''attribution''' is the process by which individuals explain the causes of behavior and events. Models to explain this process are called '''attribution theory'''.&lt;ref name="social psy"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kassin |last2=Fein |last3=Markus |title=Social Psychology |location=Wadsworth |publisher=Cengage Learning |edition=Eighth international |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-8400-3172-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological research into attribution began with the work of [[Fritz Heider]] in the early 20th century, and the theory was further advanced by [[Harold Kelley]] and [[Bernard Weiner]].

==Background==
[[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt psychologist]] [[Fritz Heider]] is often described as the early-20th-century "father of attribution theory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sanderson |first=Catherine |title=Social Psychology |year=2010 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-471-25026-5 |page=112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1920s dissertation, Heider addressed the problem of [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]]: why do perceivers attribute the properties such as color to perceived objects, when those properties are mental constructs? Heider's answer that perceivers attribute that which they "directly" sense – vibrations in the air for instance – to an object they construe as causing those sense data. "Perceivers faced with sensory data thus see the perceptual object as 'out there', because they attribute the sensory data to their underlying causes in the world."&lt;ref name=Malle&gt;{{cite book |last=Malle |first=Bertram F. |title=How the Mind Explains Behavior: Folk Explanations, Meaning, and Social Interaction |year=2004 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0-262-13445-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}}

Heider extended this idea to attributions about people: "motives, intentions, sentiments&amp;nbsp;... the core processes which manifest themselves in overt behavior".&lt;ref name=Malle/&gt;{{rp|7–8}}

==Types==

===External===
External attribution, also called situational attribution, refers to interpreting someone's behavior as being caused by the situation that the individual is in. For example, if Jacob's car tire is punctured he may attribute that to a hole in the road; by making attributions to the poor condition of the highway, he can make sense of the event without any discomfort that it may in reality have been the result of his bad driving.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|author=Heider. F|year=1958|title=The psychology of interpersonal relations|location=New York|publisher= Wiley|isbn=9780898592825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal===
The process of assigning the cause of behavior to some internal characteristic, rather than to outside forces.
This concept has overlap with the Locus of control, in which individuals feel they are personally responsible for everything that happens to them.

==Theories and models==

===Common sense psychology===
From the book ''The Psychology of Interpersonal Relations'' (1958), Fritz Heider tried to explore the nature of [[interpersonal relationship]], and espoused the concept of what he called "[[common sense]]" or "[[naïve psychology]]". In his theory, he believed that people observe, analyze, and explain behaviors with explanations. Although people have different kinds of explanations for the events of human behaviors, Heider found it is very useful to group explanation into two categories; Internal (personal) and external (situational) attributions.&lt;ref name=Lilien-1&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lilienfeld |first=Scott O. |last2=Lynn |first2=Steven Jay |last3=Namy |first3=Laura L. |last4=Woolf |first4=Nancy J. |title=Psychology: A Framework For Everyday Thinking |place= |publisher=Pearson Education |year=2010 |chapter=Social Psychology |page=380 |isbn=978-0-205-65048-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When an internal attribution is made, the cause of the given behavior is assigned to the individual's characteristics such as ability, personality, mood, efforts, attitudes, or disposition. When an external attribution is made, the cause of the given behavior is assigned to the situation in which the behavior was seen such as the task, other people, or luck (that the individual producing the behavior did so because of the surrounding environment or the social situation). These two types lead to very different perceptions of the individual engaging in a behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aronson |title=Social Psychology |location= |publisher= |edition= |year= |isbn= |pages=106–108 }}{{full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Correspondent inference===
{{Main|Correspondent inference theory}}
Correspondent inferences state that people make inferences about a person when their actions are freely chosen, are unexpected, and result in a small number of desirable effects.&lt;ref name="social psy"/&gt; According to [[Edward E. Jones]] and Keith Davis' correspondent inference theory, people make correspondent inferences by reviewing the context of behavior. It describes how people try to find out individual's personal characteristics from the behavioral evidence. People make inferences on the basis of three factors; degree of choice, expectedness of behavior, and effects of someone's behaviors. For example, we believe we can make stronger&amp;nbsp;assumptions&amp;nbsp;about a man who gives half of his money to charity, than we can about one who gives $5 to charity. An average person would not want to donate as much as the first man because they would lose a lot of money. By donating half of his money, it is easier for someone to figure out what the first man's personality is like. The second factor, that affects correspondence of action and inferred characteristic, is the number of differences between the choices made and the previous alternatives. If there aren't many differences, the assumption made will match the action because it is easy to guess the important aspect between each choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lipe|first1=Marlys G|title=Counterfactual reasoning as a framework for attribution theories|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=a455fc14-9779-4b61-91d9-828e8eff368b%40sessionmgr4010&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=4110&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=1991-21263-001&amp;db=pdh|accessdate=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Covariation model===
{{Main|Covariation model}}
The covariation model states that people attribute behavior to the factors that are present when a behavior occurs and absent when it does not. Thus, the theory assumes that people make causal attributions in a rational, logical fashion, and that they assign the cause of an action to the factor that co-varies most closely with that action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kelley |first=Harold H. |authorlink=Harold Kelley |chapter=Attribution Theory in Social Psychology |editor-first=David |editor-last=Levine |title=Nebraska Symposium on Motivation |location= |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |volume=15 |issue= |pages=192–238 |year=1967 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harold Kelley]]'s covariation model of attribution looks to three main types of information from which to make an attribution decision about an individual's behavior. The first is ''consensus information'', or information on how other people in the same situation and with the same stimulus behave. The second is ''distinctive information'', or how the individual responds to different stimuli. The third is ''consistency information'', or how frequent the individual's behavior can be observed with similar stimulus but varied situations. From these three sources of information observers make attribution decisions on the individual's behavior as either internal or external. There have been claims that people under-utilise consensus information, although there has been some dispute over this.&lt;ref name="Attribution Theory"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McLeod|first1=Saul|title=Attribution Theory|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/attribution-theory.html|website=Simply Psychology|accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several levels in the covariation model: high and low. Each of these levels influences the three covariation model criteria. High consensus is when many people can agree on an event or area of interest. Low consensus is when very few people can agree. High distinctiveness is when the event or area of interest is very unusual, whereas low distinctness is when the event or area of interest is fairly common. High consistency is when the event or area of interest continues for a length of time and low consistency is when the event or area of interest goes away quickly.&lt;ref name="Attribution Theory"/&gt;

===Three-dimensional model===
[[Bernard Weiner]] proposed that individuals have initial affective responses to the potential consequences of the intrinsic or extrinsic motives of the actor, which in turn influence future behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Weiner |first=B. |year=1992 |title=Human Motivation: Metaphors, Theories and Research |location=Newbury Park, CA |publisher=Sage Publications |isbn=0-7619-0491-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, a person's own perceptions or attributions as to why they succeeded or failed at an activity determine the amount of effort the person will engage in activities in the future. Weiner suggests that individuals exert their attribution search and cognitively evaluate casual properties on the behaviors they experience. When attributions lead to positive affect and high expectancy of future success, such attributions should result in greater willingness to approach to similar achievement tasks in the future than those attributions that produce negative affect and low expectancy of future success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Munton |last2=Silvester |last3=Stratton |last4=Hanks |title=Attributions in Action |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=1999 |isbn=0-471-98216-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, such affective and cognitive assessment influences future behavior when individuals encounter similar situations.

Weiner's achievement attribution has three categories:
# stable theory (stable and unstable)
# [[locus of control]] (internal and external)
# controllability (controllable or uncontrollable)

Stability influences individuals' expectancy about their future; control is related with individuals' persistence on mission; causality influences emotional responses to the outcome of task.

==Bias and errors==
While people strive to find reasons for behaviors, they fall into many traps of biases and errors. As Fritz Heider says, "our perceptions of causality are often distorted by our needs and certain [[cognitive biases]]".&lt;ref name="social"&gt;{{cite book |last=Forsyth |first=Donelson |title=Social Psychology |location= |publisher=Brooks/Cole |year=1987 |isbn=0-534-06744-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following are examples of attributional biases.

===Fundamental attribution error===
{{Main|Fundamental attribution error}}
The fundamental attribution error describes the habit to misunderstand dispositional or personality-based explanations for behavior, rather than considering external factors. The fundamental attribution error is most visible when people explain and assume the behavior of others. For example, if a person is overweight, a person's first assumption might be that they have a problem with overeating or are lazy and not that they might have a medical reason for being heavier set.&lt;ref name="Social Psychology Textbook"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sanderson |first=Catherine |title=Social Psychology |year=2010 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-471-25026-5 |page=118 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When evaluating others' behaviors, the situational context is often ignored in favor of the disposition of the actor to be the cause of an observed behavior. This is because when a behavior occurs attention is most often focused on the person performing the behavior.  Thus, the individual is more salient than the environment and dispositional attributions are made more often than situational attributions to explain the behavior of others.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; However, when evaluating one's own behavior, the situational factors are often exaggerated when there is a negative outcome while dispositional factors are exaggerated when there is a positive outcome.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The core process assumptions of attitude construction models are mainstays of social cognition research and are not controversial—as long as we talk about "judgment". Once the particular judgment made can be thought of as a person's "attitude", however, construal assumptions elicit discomfort, presumably because they dispense with the intuitively appealing attitude concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schwarz |first=N. |year=2006 |title=Attitude Research: Between Ockham's Razor and the Fundamental Attribution Error |journal=[[Journal of Consumer Research]] |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=19–21 |doi=10.1086/504124 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture bias===
{{Main|Culture bias}}
Culture bias is when someone makes an assumption about the behavior of a person based on their cultural practices and beliefs. People in [[individualist]] cultures, generally [[Anglo-America]] and Anglo-Saxon European societies, value individuals, personal goals, and independence. People in [[collectivist]] cultures see individuals as members of groups such as families, tribes, work units, and nations, and tend to value conformity and interdependence. In other words, working together and being involved as a group is more common in certain cultures that views each person as a part of the community. This cultural trait is common in Asia, traditional Native American societies, and Africa. Research shows that culture, either individualist or collectivist, affects how people make attributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hongyin Wang |script-title=zh:跨文化心理学导论 |trans-title=Introduction to the Cross-Culture Psychology |location= |publisher=Shanxi Normal University Press |year=1993 |isbn=7-5613-0864-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People from individualist cultures are more inclined to make fundamental-attribution error than people from collectivist cultures. Individualist cultures tend to attribute a person's behavior due to their internal factors whereas collectivist cultures tend to attribute a person's behavior to his external factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Perrius|first1=Chris|title=Individualism, collectivism, and attribution|url=https://blog.nationalequityproject.org/2011/03/11/individualism-collectivism-and-attribution/|accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests that individualist cultures engage in [[self-serving bias]] more than do collectivist cultures, i.e. individualist cultures tend to attribute success to internal factors and to attribute failure to external factors. In contrast, collectivist cultures engage in the opposite of self-serving bias i.e. self-effacing bias, which is: attributing success to external factors and blaming failure on internal factors (the individual).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Individual and Cultural Differences in Person Perception|url=http://open.lib.umn.edu/socialpsychology/chapter/6-3-individual-and-cultural-differences-in-person-perception/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actor/observer difference===
People tend to attribute other people's behaviors to their dispositional factors while attributing own actions to situational factors. In the same situation, people's attribution can differ depending on their role as actor or observer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |last2=Nisbett |title=The Actor and the Observer: Divergent Perceptions of the Causes of Behavior |location=New York |publisher=General Learning Press |year=1971 |isbn=0-382-25026-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when a person scores a low grade on a test, they find situational factors to justify the negative event such as saying that the teacher asked a question that he/she never went over in class. However, if another person scores poorly on a test, the person will attribute the results to internal factors such as laziness and inattentiveness in classes. The theory of the actor-observer bias was first developed by E. Jones and R. Nisbett  in 1971, whose explanation for the effect was that when we observe other people, we tend to focus on the person, whereas when we are actors, our attention is focused towards situational factors. The actor/observer bias is used less frequently with people one knows well such as friends and family since one knows how his/her close friends and family will behave in certain situation, leading him/her to think more about the external factors rather than internal factors.{{original research inline|date=February 2015}}

===Dispositional attributions===
{{Main|Dispositional attribution}}
Dispositional attribution is a tendency to attribute people's behaviors to their dispositions; that is, to their personality, character, and ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pettigrew |title= The ultimate attribution error: Extending Allport's cognitive analysis of prejudice, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|journal= Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=5|issue=4|year=1979 | pages=461–476 |doi=10.1177/014616727900500407 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248047301_The_Ultimate_Attribution_Error_Extending_Allport's_Cognitive_Analysis_of_Prejudice}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, when a normally pleasant waiter is being rude to his/her customer, the customer may assume he/she has a bad temper. The customer, just by looking at the attitude that the waiter is giving him/her, instantly decides that the waiter is a bad person. The customer oversimplifies the situation by not taking into account all the unfortunate events that might have happened to the waiter which made him/her become rude at that moment. Therefore, the customer made dispositional attribution by attributing the waiter's behavior directly to his/her personality rather than considering situational factors that might have caused the whole "rudeness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Graham |last2=Folkes |title=Attribution Theory: Applications to Achievement, Mental Health, and Interpersonal Conflict |location= |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |year=1990 |isbn=0-8058-0531-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-serving bias===
{{Main|Self-serving bias}}
Self-serving bias is attributing dispositional and internal factors for success, while external and uncontrollable factors are used to explain the reason for failure. For example, if a person gets promoted, it is because of his/her ability and competence whereas if he/she does not get promoted, it is because his/her manager does not like him/her (external, uncontrollable factor). Originally, researchers assumed that self-serving bias is strongly related to the fact that people want to protect their self-esteem.  However, an alternative information processing explanation is that when the outcomes match people's expectations, they make attributions to internal factors. For example, if you pass a test you believe it was  because of your intelligence; when the outcome does not match their expectations, they make external attributions or excuses. Whereas if you fail a test, you would give an excuse saying that you did not have enough time to study.&lt;ref name="social"/&gt; People also use defensive attribution to avoid feelings of vulnerability and to differentiate themselves from a victim of a tragic accident.&lt;ref name="Shaver"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shaver |first=Kelly G. |title=Defensive Attribution: Effects of Severity and Relevance on the Responsibility Assigned for an Accident |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association |year=1970 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=101–113 |doi=10.1037/h0028777 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An alternative version of the theory of self-serving bias states that the bias does not arise because people wish to protect their private self-esteem, but to protect their self-image (a self-presentational bias). This version of the theory would predict that people attribute their successes to situational factors, for fear that others will disapprove of them looking overly vain if they should attribute successes to themselves.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

For example, it is [[just-world hypothesis|suggested]] that coming to believe that "good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people" will reduce feelings of vulnerability {{Citation needed|date = August 2015}}. This belief would have side-effects of [[blaming the victim]] even in tragic situations.&lt;ref name="social"/&gt; When a mudslide destroys several houses in a rural neighborhood, a person living in a more urban setting might blame the victims for choosing to live in a certain area or not building a safer, stronger house. Another example of attributional bias is [[optimism bias]] in which most people believe positive events happen to them more often than to  others and that negative events happen to them less often than to others. For example, smokers on average believe they are less likely to get lung cancer than other smokers.&lt;ref name="Roesch and Amirkham, 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roesch |last2=Amirkham |title= Boundary Conditions for Self-serving Attributions: Another Look at the Sports Pages |journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology |location= |publisher=  |year=1997 |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=245–261 | doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1997.tb00631.x|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229546801_Boundary_Conditions_for_Self-serving_Attributions_Another_Look_at_the_Sports_Pages1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defensive attribution hypothesis===
{{Main|Defensive attribution hypothesis}}
The defensive attribution hypothesis is a [[social psychology|social psychological]] term referring to a set of beliefs held by an individual with the function of defending themselves from concern that they will be the cause or victim of a mishap. Commonly, defensive attributions are made when individuals witness or learn of a mishap happening to another person.  In these situations, attributions of responsibility to the victim or harm-doer for the mishap will depend upon the severity of the outcomes of the mishap and the level of personal and situational similarity between the individual and victim.  More responsibility will be attributed to the harm-doer as the outcome becomes more severe, and as personal or situational similarity decreases.&lt;ref name="Shaver" /&gt;

An example of defensive attribution is the [[just-world hypothesis]], which is where "good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people". People believe in this in order to avoid feeling vulnerable to situations that they have no control over. However, this also leads to blaming the victim even in a tragic situation.&lt;ref name="social"/&gt; When people hear someone died from a car accident, they decide that the driver was drunk at the time of the accident, and so they reassure themselves that an accident will never happen to them. Despite the fact there was no other information provided, people will automatically attribute that the accident was the driver's fault due to an internal factor (in this case, deciding to drive while drunk), and thus they would not allow it to happen to themselves.

Another example of defensive attribution is [[optimism bias]], in which people believe positive events happen to them more often than to others and that negative events happen to them less often than to others. Too much optimism leads people to ignore some warnings and precautions given to them. For example, smokers believe that they are less likely to get lung cancer than other smokers.&lt;ref name="Roesch and Amirkham, 1997"/&gt;

==Application==

Attribution theory can be applied to juror decision making. Jurors use attributions to explain the cause of the defendant's intent and actions related to the criminal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Moskowitz, G. B.|year=2005|title=Social cognition: Understanding self and others|location=New York, NY|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=9781593850852}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The attribution made (situational or dispositional) might affect a juror's punitiveness towards the defendant.&lt;ref name=Sommers&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sommers, S. R.|author2=Ellsworth, P. C.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2000|title=Race in the courtroom: Perceptions of guilt and dispositional attributions|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=26|issue=11|pages=1367–1379|doi=10.1177/0146167200263005|url=http://ase.tufts.edu/psychology/sommersLab/documents/raceRealSommersEllsworth2000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; When jurors attribute a defendant's behavior to dispositional attributions they tend to be more punitive and are more likely find a defendant guilty&lt;ref name=Sommers/&gt; and to recommend a death sentence compared to a life sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cochran, J. K.|author2=Boots, D. P.|author3=Heide, K.

==In clinical psychology==

Attribution theory has had a big application in clinical psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Antaki, C.|editor2=Brewin, C.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1982|title=Attributions and psychological change: Applications of attributional theories to clinical and educational practice|location=London|publisher=Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abramson, Seligman, and Teasdale developed a theory of the depressive attributional style, claiming that individuals who tend to attribute their failures to internal, stable and global factors are more vulnerable to clinical depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Abramson, L. Y.|author2=Seligman, M. E.|author3=Teasdale, J. D. |lastauthoramp=y|year=1978|title=Learned helplessness in humans: critique and reformulation|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|volume=87|issue=1|pages=49–74|pmid=649856|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ef52/775276f83a46162a9b364335d9ee5ee73b99.pdf|doi=10.1037/0021-843X.87.1.49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Attributional Style Questionnaire (ASQ) has been developed to assess whether individuals have the depressogenic attributional style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Peterson, C.|author2=Semmel, A.|author3=Von Baeyer, C.|author4=Abramson, L. Y.|author5=Metalsky, G. I.|author6=Seligman, M. E.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1982|title=The attributional style questionnaire|journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research|volume=6|issue=3|pages=287–299|doi=10.1007/BF01173577}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ASQ has been criticized, with some researchers preferring to use a technique called Content Analysis of Verbatim Explanation (CAVE) in which an individual's ordinary writings are analysed to assess whether s/he is vulnerable to the depressive attributional style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Schulman, P.|author2=Castellon, C.|author3=Seligman, M. E.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1989|title=Assessing explanatory style: The content analysis of verbatim explanations and the attributional style questionnaire|journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy|volume=27|issue=5|pages=505–509|pmid=2818415|url=https://diamitch.home.xs4all.nl/artikels%20reveraat/science.pdf|doi=10.1016/0005-7967(89)90084-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learned helplessness===
{{Main|Learned helplessness}}
The concept of learned helplessness emerged from animal research in which psychologists [[Martin Seligman]] and Steven F. Maier discovered that dogs classically conditioned to an electrical shock which they could not escape, subsequently failed to attempt to escape an avoidable shock in a similar situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Maier |last2=Seligman |title=Learned Helplessness: Theory and Evidence |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General |volume=105 |issue=1 |pages=3–46 |year=1976 |doi=10.1037/0096-3445.105.1.3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that learned helplessness applied to human psychopathology. In particular, individuals who [[Explanatory style|attribute]] negative outcomes to internal, stable and global factors reflect a view in which they have no control over their situation. It is suggested that this aspect of not attempting to better a situation exacerbates negative mood, and may lead to clinical depression and related mental illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Seligman |first=Martin |title=Helplessness: On Depression, Development, and Death |publisher=Freeman/Times Books/Henry Holt &amp; Co |year=1975 |isbn=0-7167-0752-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perceptual salience==
{{Main|Perceptual salience}}
When people try to make attributions about another's behavior, their information focuses on the individual. Their perception of that individual is lacking most of the external factors which might affect the individual. The gaps tend to be skipped over and the attribution is made based on the perception information most salient. The most salient perceptual information dominates a person's perception of the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aronson |title=Social Psychology |location= |publisher= |edition= |year= |isbn= |pages=113–114 }}{{full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For individuals making behavioral attributions about themselves, the situation and external environment are entirely salient, but their own body and behavior are less so. This leads to the tendency to make an external attribution in regard to their own behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Huffman |title=Psychology in Action |location= |publisher= |edition= |year= |isbn= |page=622 }}{{full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Attribution theory has been criticised as being mechanistic and [[reductionist]] for assuming that people are rational, logical, and systematic thinkers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The fundamental attribution error, however, demonstrates that they are [[cognitive miser]]s and [[motivated tactician]]. It also fails to address the social, cultural, and historical factors that shape attributions of cause. This has been addressed extensively by [[discourse analysis]], a branch of psychology that prefers to use qualitative methods including the use of language to understand psychological phenomena. The [[linguistic categorization theory]] for example demonstrates how language influences our attribution style.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

'''Automath''' ("automating mathematics") was a [[formal language]], devised by [[Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn]] starting in 1967, for expressing complete mathematical theories in such a way that an included automated [[proof checker]] can verify their correctness.

==Overview==
The Automath system included many novel notions that were later adopted and/or reinvented in areas such as [[typed lambda calculus]] and [[explicit substitution]]. [[Dependent types]] is one outstanding example. Automath was also the first practical system that exploited the [[Curry&amp;ndash;Howard correspondence]]. Propositions were represented as sets (called "categories") of their proofs, and the question of provability became a question of non-emptiness ([[type inhabitation]]); de Bruijn was unaware of Howard's work, and stated the correspondence independently.&lt;ref&gt;Morten Heine Sørensen, Paweł Urzyczyn, ''Lectures on the Curry&amp;ndash;Howard isomorphism'', Elsevier, 2006, {{ISBN|0-444-52077-5}}, pp 98-99&lt;/ref&gt;  

L. S. van Benthem Jutting, as part of this Ph.D. thesis in 1976, translated [[Edmund Landau]]'s ''Foundations of Analysis'' into Automath and checked its correctness.
 
Automath was never widely publicized at the time, however, and so never achieved widespread use; nonetheless, it proved very influential in the later development of [[logical framework]]s and [[proof assistant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;R. P. Nederpelt, J. H. Geuvers, R. C. de Vrijer (1994) ''Selected Papers on Automath.'' Vol. 133 of Studies Logic, Elsevier, Amsterdam. {{ISBN|0-444-89822-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. Kamareddine (2003) ''Thirty-five years of automating mathematics.'' Workshop, Dordrecht, Boston, published by Kluwer Academic Publishers, {{ISBN|1-4020-1656-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mizar system]], a system of writing and checking formalized mathematics that is still in active use, was influenced by Automath.

== Background ==
{{Main article|Epigenetics}}
In [[biology]], and specifically [[genetics]], epigenetics is the study of [[heritable]] changes in [[gene]] activity which are ''not'' caused by changes in the [[DNA]] sequence; the term can also be used to describe the study of stable, long-term alterations in the transcriptional potential of a cell that are not necessarily heritable.&lt;ref name="pmid17522671"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bird A | title = Perceptions of epigenetics | journal = Nature | volume = 447 | issue = 7143 | pages = 396–8 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17522671 | doi = 10.1038/nature05913 | bibcode = 2007Natur.447..396B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Overview of the Roadmap Epigenomics Project |url=http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/overview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of mechanisms that produce such changes are [[DNA methylation]]&lt;ref name="pmid18940229"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mehler MF | title = Epigenetic principles and mechanisms underlying nervous system functions in health and disease | journal = Progress in Neurobiology | volume = 86 | issue = 4 | pages = 305–41 | date = Dec 2008 | pmid = 18940229 | pmc = 2636693 | doi =  10.1016/j.pneurobio.2008.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[histone modification]],&lt;ref name="Maze_2011"/&gt; each of which alters how genes are expressed without altering the underlying [[DNA sequence]]. Gene expression can be controlled through the action of repressor proteins that attach to [[silencer (DNA)|silencer]] regions of the DNA.

Epigenetics has a strong influence on the development of an organism and can alter the expression of individual traits.&lt;ref name="pmid11498570"/&gt;  Epigenetic changes occur not only in the developing fetus, but also in individuals throughout the human life-span.&lt;ref name="Moore_2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Campbell_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Campbell IC, Mill J, Uher R, Schmidt U | title = Eating disorders, gene-environment interactions and epigenetics | journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 784–93 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 20888360 | doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2010.09.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Because some epigenetic modifications can be passed from one generation to the next,&lt;ref name="Goto_1998"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goto T, Monk M | title = Regulation of X-chromosome inactivation in development in mice and humans | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | volume = 62 | issue = 2 | pages = 362–78 | date = Jun 1998 | pmid = 9618446 | pmc = 98919 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; subsequent generations may be affected by the epigenetic changes that took place in the parents.&lt;ref name="Goto_1998"/&gt;

== Discovery ==

The first documented example of epigenetics affecting behavior was provided by [[Michael Meaney]] and [[Moshe Szyf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weaver IC, Cervoni N, Champagne FA, D'Alessio AC, Sharma S, Seckl JR, Dymov S, Szyf M, Meaney MJ | title = Epigenetic programming by maternal behavior | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 7 | issue = 8 | pages = 847–54 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15220929 | doi = 10.1038/nn1276 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While working at [[McGill University]] in [[Montréal]] in 2004, they discovered that the type and amount of nurturing a mother rat provides in the early weeks of the rat's [[infancy]] determines how that rat responds to [[stress (psychological)|stress]] later in life.&lt;ref name="Moore_2015"/&gt; This stress sensitivity was linked to a [[Regulation of gene expression#Up-regulation and down-regulation|down-regulation]] in the expression of the [[glucocorticoid receptor]] in the brain.  In turn, this down-regulation was found to be a consequence of the extent of [[Methylation#Epigenetics|methylation]] in the [[promoter (genetics)|promoter]] region of the glucocorticoid receptor [[gene]].&lt;ref name="Miller_2010"/&gt; Immediately after birth, Meaney and Szyf found that [[methyl group]]s repress the [[glucocorticoid receptor]] gene in all rat pups, making the gene unable to unwind from the histone in order to be transcribed, causing a decreased stress response. Nurturing behaviours from the mother rat were found to stimulate activation of stress signalling pathways that remove methyl groups from DNA. This releases the tightly wound gene, exposing it for transcription. The glucocorticoid gene is activated, resulting in lowered stress response. Rat pups that receive a less nurturing upbringing are more sensitive to stress throughout their life-span.

This pioneering work in rodents has been difficult to replicate in humans because of a general lack of availability human brain tissue for measurement of epigenetic changes.&lt;ref name="Miller_2010"/&gt;

== Research into epigenetics in psychology ==

=== Anxiety and risk-taking ===
[[Image:TwinGirls.jpg|right|thumb|[[Twin#Monozygotic ("identical") twins|Monozygotic twins]] are identical twins. [[Twin studies]] help to reveal epigenetic differences related to various aspects of psychology.]]
In a small clinical study in humans published in 2008, epigenetic differences were linked to differences in risk-taking and reactions to stress in [[Twin#Monozygotic ("identical") twins|monozygotic twins]].&lt;ref name="Kaminsky_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaminsky Z, Petronis A, Wang SC, Levine B, Ghaffar O, Floden D, Feinstein A | title = Epigenetics of personality traits: an illustrative study of identical twins discordant for risk-taking behavior | journal = Twin Research and Human Genetics | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–11 | date = Feb 2008 | pmid = 18251670 | doi = 10.1375/twin.11.1.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The study identified twins with different life paths, wherein one twin displayed risk-taking behaviours, and the other displayed risk-averse behaviours.  Epigenetic differences in [[DNA methylation]] of the [[CpG island]]s proximal to the [[DLX1]] gene correlated with the differing behavior.&lt;ref name="Kaminsky_2008"/&gt;   The authors of the twin study noted that despite the associations between epigenetic markers and differences personality traits, epigenetics cannot predict complex decision-making processes like career selection.&lt;ref name="Kaminsky_2008"/&gt;

=== Stress ===
[[Image:Basic HPA Axis.jpeg|right|thumb|The [[Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis|hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis]] is involved in the [[Stress (biology)|human stress response]].]]
Animal and human studies have found correlations between poor care during infancy and epigenetic changes that correlate with long-term impairments that result from neglect.&lt;ref name=Masterpasqua&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =Masterpasqua F | title = Psychology and epigenetics | journal = Review of General Psychology | year = 2009 | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 194–201 |pmid = | doi = 10.1037/a0016301}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Szyf and McGowan"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Szyf M, McGowan P, Meaney MJ | title = The social environment and the epigenome | journal = Environmental and Molecular Mutagenesis | volume = 49 | issue = 1 | pages = 46–60 | date = Jan 2008 | pmid = 18095330 | doi = 10.1002/em.20357 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gonzalez-Pardo&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = González-Pardo H, Pérez Álvarez M | title = Epigenetics and its implications for Psychology | journal = Psicothema | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–12 | date = Feb 2013 | pmid = 23336536 | doi = 10.7334/psicothema2012.327 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in rats have shown correlations between maternal care in terms of the parental licking of offspring and epigenetic changes.&lt;ref name=Masterpasqua/&gt; A high level of licking results in a long-term reduction in stress response as measured behaviorally and biochemically in elements of the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA).  Further, decreased DNA methylation of the [[glucocorticoid receptor]] gene were found in offspring that experienced a high level of licking; the glucorticoid receptor plays a key role in regulating the HPA.&lt;ref name=Masterpasqua /&gt;  The opposite is found in offspring that experienced low levels of licking, and when pups are switched,  the epigenetic changes are reversed. This research provides evidence for an underlying epigenetic mechanism.&lt;ref name=Masterpasqua /&gt;  Further support comes from experiments with the same setup, using drugs that can increase or decrease methylation.&lt;ref name="Szyf and McGowan"/&gt;  Finally, epigenetic variations in parental care can be passed down from one generation to the next, from mother to female offspring. Female offspring who received increased parental care (i.e., high licking) became mothers who engaged in high licking and offspring who received less licking became mothers who engaged in less licking.&lt;ref name=Masterpasqua /&gt;

In humans, a small clinical research study showed the relationship between prenatal exposure to maternal [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] and genetic expression resulting in increased reactivity to stress in offspring.&lt;ref name="Moore_2015"/&gt; Three groups of infants were examined: those born to mothers medicated for [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] with [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|serotonin reuptake inhibitors]]; those born to depressed mothers not being treated for depression; and those born to non-depressed mothers. Prenatal exposure to depressed/anxious mood was associated with increased DNA methylation at the glucocorticoid receptor gene and to increased HPA axis stress reactivity.&lt;ref name=Masterpasqua /&gt;  The findings were independent of whether the mothers were being pharmaceutically treated for depression.&lt;ref name=Masterpasqua /&gt;

Recent research has also shown the relationship of methylation of the maternal glucocorticoid receptor and maternal neural activity in response to mother-infant interactions on video.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter DS, Moser DA, Giacobino A, Stenz L, Gex-Fabry M, Adouan W, Cordero MI, Suardi F, Manini A, Sancho-Rossignol A, Merminod G, Aue T, Ansermet F, Dayer AG, Rusconi-Serpa S.

{{Psychostimulant addiction|Colorcode=yes|align=right}}
Environmental and epigenetic influences seem to work together to increase the risk of [[addiction]].&lt;ref name="Wong_2011"/&gt; For example, environmental stress has been shown to increase the risk of [[substance abuse]].&lt;ref name="Andersen and Teicher"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Andersen SL, Teicher MH | title = Desperately driven and no brakes: developmental stress exposure and subsequent risk for substance abuse | journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 33 | issue = 4 | pages = 516–24 | date = Apr 2009 | pmid = 18938197 | pmc = 2688959 | doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2008.09.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to cope with stress, [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and [[Psychoactive drug|drugs]] can be used as an escape.&lt;ref name=Carver&gt;{{cite book | vauthors =  Carver C | chapter = Coping | veditors = Baum A, Contrada RJ | title = The Handbook of Stress Science: Biology, Psychology, and Health | edition = | publisher = Springer Publishing Company | location = New York | year = 2010  | pages = 223 | quote = | isbn = 978-0-8261-1471-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once substance abuse commences, however, epigenetic alterations may further exacerbate the biological and behavioural changes associated with addiction.&lt;ref name="Wong_2011"/&gt;

Even short-term substance abuse can produce long-lasting epigenetic changes in the brain of rodents,&lt;ref name="Wong_2011"/&gt; via DNA methylation and histone modification.&lt;ref name="Maze_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maze I, Nestler EJ | title = The epigenetic landscape of addiction | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1216 | issue =  | pages = 99–113 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21272014 | pmc = 3071632 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05893.x | bibcode = 2011NYASA1216...99M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Epigenetic modifications have been observed in studies on rodents involving [[ethanol]], [[nicotine]], [[cocaine]], [[amphetamine]], [[methamphetamine]] and [[opiate]]s.&lt;ref name="Moore_2015"/&gt; Specifically, these epigenetic changes modify gene expression, which in turn increases the vulnerability of an individual to engage in repeated substance overdose in the future.

=== Eating disorders and obesity ===
{{further|ΔFosB}}
Epigenetic changes may help to facilitate the development and maintenance of [[eating disorder]]s via influences in the early environment and throughout the life-span.&lt;ref name="Campbell_2011"/&gt; [[Pre-natal]] epigenetic changes due to maternal stress, behaviour and diet may later predispose offspring to persistent, increased anxiety and [[anxiety disorders]].

Epigenetic differences accumulating over the life-span may account for the incongruent differences in eating disorders observed in monozygotic twins. At [[puberty]], [[sex hormones]] may exert epigenetic changes (via DNA methylation) on gene expression, thus accounting for higher rates of eating disorders in men as compared to women.

Epigenetic changes including hypomethylation of glutamatergic genes (i.e., NMDA-receptor-subunit gene [[NMDA receptor|NR3B]] and the promoter of the AMPA-receptor-subunit gene [[GRIA2]]) in the post-mortem human brains of schizophrenics are associated with increased levels of the neurotransmitter [[glutamic acid|glutamate]].&lt;ref name="Mostafavi-Abdolmaleky"&gt;{{cite book |veditors=Bronner F, Helmtrud I |title=Epigenetic Aspects of Chronic Diseases |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-84882-643-4 |vauthors=Mostafavi-Abdolmaleky H, Glatt SJ, Tsuang MT |chapter=Epigenetics in Psychiatry |pages=163–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since glutamate is the most prevalent, fast, excitatory neurotransmitter, increased levels may result in the [[psychotic episodes]] related to [[schizophrenia]].

=== Major depressive disorder===
The causes of [[major depressive disorder]] (MDD) are poorly understood from a [[neuroscience]] perspective.&lt;ref name="Massart"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Massart R, Mongeau R, Lanfumey L | title = Beyond the monoaminergic hypothesis: neuroplasticity and epigenetic changes in a transgenic mouse model of depression | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Much of the work in animal models has focused on the indirect downregulation of [[brain derived neurotrophic factor]] (BDNF) by over-activation of the stress axis.&lt;ref name="Tsankova"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tsankova NM, Berton O, Renthal W, Kumar A, Neve RL, Nestler EJ | title = Sustained hippocampal chromatin regulation in a mouse model of depression and antidepressant action | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 519–25 | date = Apr 2006 | pmid = 16501568 | doi = 10.1038/nn1659 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gray"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gray JD, Milner TA, McEwen BS | title = Dynamic plasticity: the role of glucocorticoids, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and other trophic factors | journal = Neuroscience | volume = 239 | pages = 214–27 | date = Jun 2013 | pmid = 22922121 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2012.08.034 | pmc = 3743657 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Studies in various rodent models of depression, often involving induction of stress, have found direct epigenetic modulation of BDNF as well.&lt;ref name="Hunter"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hunter RG | title = Epigenetic effects of stress and corticosteroids in the brain | journal = Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | volume = 6 | pages = 18 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22529779 | doi = 10.3389/fncel.2012.00018 | pmc=3329877}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychopathy===

Epigenetics may be relevant to aspects of psychopathic behaviour through methylation and histone modification.&lt;ref name="pmid19005036"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jiang Y, Langley B, Lubin FD, Renthal W, Wood MA, Yasui DH, Kumar A, Nestler EJ, Akbarian S, Beckel-Mitchener AC | title = Epigenetics in the nervous system | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 28 | issue = 46 | pages = 11753–9 | date = Nov 2008 | pmid = 19005036 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3797-08.2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These processes are heritable but can also be influenced by environmental factors such as smoking and abuse.&lt;ref name="pmid19777560"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Philibert RA, Beach SR, Gunter TD, Brody GH, Madan A, Gerrard M | title = The effect of smoking on MAOA promoter methylation in DNA prepared from lymphoblasts and whole blood | journal = American Journal of Medical Genetics Part B | volume = 153B | issue = 2 | pages = 619–28 | date = Mar 2010 | pmid = 19777560 | pmc = 3694401 | doi = 10.1002/ajmg.b.31031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Epigenetics may be one of the mechanisms through which the environment can impact the expression of the genome.&lt;ref name="pmid17987668"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Philibert RA, Sandhu H, Hollenbeck N, Gunter T, Adams W, Madan A | title = The relationship of 5HTT (SLC6A4) methylation and genotype on mRNA expression and liability to major depression and alcohol dependence in subjects from the Iowa Adoption Studies | journal = American Journal of Medical Genetics Part B | volume = 147B | issue = 5 | pages = 543–9 | date = Jul 2008 | pmid = 17987668 | pmc = 3643119 | doi = 10.1002/ajmg.b.30657 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies have also linked methylation of genes associated with nicotine and alcohol dependence in women, ADHD, and drug abuse.&lt;ref name="pmid18454435"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Philibert RA, Gunter TD, Beach SR, Brody GH, Madan A | title = MAOA methylation is associated with nicotine and alcohol dependence in women | journal = American Journal of Medical Genetics Part B | volume = 147B | issue = 5 | pages = 565–70 | date = Jul 2008 | pmid = 18454435 | pmc = 3685146 | doi = 10.1002/ajmg.b.30778 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20875476"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bodnar RJ | title = Endogenous opiates and behavior: 2009 | journal = Peptides | volume = 31 | issue = 12 | pages = 2325–59 | date = Dec 2010 | pmid = 20875476 | doi = 10.1016/j.peptides.2010.09.016 | pmc = 2693002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18492038"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mill J, Petronis A | title = Pre- and peri-natal environmental risks for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): the potential role of epigenetic processes in mediating susceptibility | journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, and Allied Disciplines | volume = 49 | issue = 10 | pages = 1020–30 | date = Oct 2008 | pmid = 18492038 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2008.01909.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is probable that epigenetic regulation as well as methylation profiling will play an increasingly important role in the study of the play between the environment and genetics of psychopaths.&lt;ref name="pmid20422643"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gunter TD, Vaughn MG, Philibert RA | title = Behavioral genetics in antisocial spectrum disorders and psychopathy: a review of the recent literature | journal = Behavioral Sciences &amp; the Law | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 148–73 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20422643 | doi = 10.1002/bsl.923 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Suicide ===

A study of the brains of 24 suicide completers, 12 of whom had a history of child abuse and 12 who did not, found decreased levels of [[glucocorticoid receptor]] in victims of child abuse and associated epigenetic changes.&lt;ref name="McGowan_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McGowan PO, Sasaki A, D'Alessio AC, Dymov S, Labonté B, Szyf M, Turecki G, Meaney MJ | title = Epigenetic regulation of the glucocorticoid receptor in human brain associates with childhood abuse | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 342–8 | date = Mar 2009 | pmid = 19234457 | pmc = 2944040 | doi = 10.1038/nn.2270 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social insects ==
Several studies have indicated DNA cytosine methylation linked to the social behavior of insects, such as honeybees and ants. In honeybees, when nurse bee switched from her in-hive tasks to out foraging, cytosine methylation marks are changing. When a forager bee was reversed to do nurse duties, the cytosine methylation marks were also reversed.&lt;ref name="Herb_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Herb BR, Wolschin F, Hansen KD, Aryee MJ, Langmead B, Irizarry R, Amdam GV, Feinberg AP | title = Reversible switching between epigenetic states in honeybee behavioral subcastes | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 15 | issue = 10 | pages = 1371–3 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22983211 | doi = 10.1038/nn.3218 | pmc=3518384}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knocking down the DNMT3 in the larvae changed the worker to queen-like phenotype.&lt;ref name="Kucharski_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kucharski R, Maleszka J, Foret S, Maleszka R | title = Nutritional control of reproductive status in honeybees via DNA methylation | journal = Science | volume = 319 | issue = 5871 | pages = 1827–30 | date = Mar 2008 | pmid = 18339900 | doi = 10.1126/science.1153069 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Queen and worker are two distinguish castes with different morphology, behavior, and physiology. Studies in DNMT3 silencing also indicated DNA methylation may regulate gene alternative splicing and pre-mRNA maturation.&lt;ref name="Li-Byarlay_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li-Byarlay H, Li Y, Stroud H, Feng S, Newman TC, Kaneda M, Hou KK, Worley KC, Elsik CG, Wickline SA, Jacobsen SE, Ma J, Robinson GE | title = RNA interference knockdown of DNA methyl-transferase 3 affects gene alternative splicing in the honey bee | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 110 | issue = 31 | pages = 12750–5 | date = Jul 2013 | pmid = 23852726 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1310735110 | pmc=3732956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations and future direction ==
Many researchers contribute information to the [[International Human Epigenome Consortium|Human Epigenome Consortium]].&lt;ref name="Albert_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Albert PR | title = Epigenetics in mental illness: hope or hype? | journal = Journal of Psychiatry &amp; Neuroscience | volume = 35 | issue = 6 | pages = 366–8 | date = Nov 2010 | pmid = 20964959 | pmc = 2964366 | doi = 10.1503/jpn.100148 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of future research is to reprogram epigenetic changes to help with addiction, mental illness, age related changes,&lt;ref name="Powledge_2011" /&gt;  memory decline, and other issues.&lt;ref name="Miller_2010" /&gt; However, the sheer volume of consortium-based data makes analysis difficult.&lt;ref name="Powledge_2011" /&gt; Most studies also focus on one gene.&lt;ref name=McCaffery&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = McCaffery JM | chapter = Genetic epidemiology of stress and gene by stress interaction |veditors=Baum A, Contrada RJ | title = The Handbook of Stress Science: Biology, Psychology, and Health | edition = | publisher = Springer Publishing Company | location = New York | year = 2010 | pages = 78–85 | isbn = 978-0-8261-1471-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   In actuality, many genes and interactions between them likely contribute to individual differences in personality, behaviour and health.&lt;ref name="Kalant_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kalant H | title = What neurobiology cannot tell us about addiction | journal = Addiction | volume = 105 | issue = 5 | pages = 780–9 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 19919596 | doi = 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02739.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; As social scientists often work with many variables, determining the number of affected genes also poses methodological challenges. More collaboration between medical researchers, geneticists and social scientists has been advocated to increase knowledge in this field of study.&lt;ref name = "Guo_2010"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors =  Guo G | chapter = Family influences on children's well being: potential roles of molecular genetics and epigenetics |veditors=Landale N, Booth A, McHale S | title = Biosocial Foundations of Family Processes (National Symposium on Family Issues) | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin | year = 2010 | pages = 181–204 | quote = | isbn = 978-1-4419-7360-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Limited access to human brain tissue poses a challenge to conducting human research.&lt;ref name="Powledge_2011" /&gt; Not yet knowing if epigenetic changes in the blood and (non-brain) tissues parallel modifications in the brain, places even greater reliance on brain research.&lt;ref name="Albert_2010"/&gt; Although some epigenetic studies have translated findings from animals to humans,&lt;ref name="McGowan_2009"/&gt; some researchers caution about the extrapolation of animal studies to humans.&lt;ref name="Miller_2010" /&gt; One view notes that when animal studies do not consider how the subcellular and  cellular components, organs and the entire individual interact with the influences of the environment, results are too reductive to explain behaviour.&lt;ref name="Kalant_2010" /&gt;

Some researchers note that epigenetic perspectives will likely be incorporated into pharmacological treatments.&lt;ref name="pmid18197504" /&gt; Others caution that more research is necessary as drugs are known to modify the activity of multiple genes and may, therefore, cause serious side effects.&lt;ref name="Miller_2010" /&gt; However, the ultimate goal is to find patterns of epigenetic changes that can be targeted to treat mental illness, and reverse the effects of childhood stressors, for example. If such treatable patterns eventually become well-established, the inability to access brains in living humans to identify them poses an obstacle to pharmacological treatment.&lt;ref name="Albert_2010"/&gt; Future research may also focus on epigenetic changes that mediate the impact of psychotherapy on personality and behaviour.&lt;ref name=Masterpasqua /&gt;

Most epigenetic research is correlational; it merely establishes associations. More experimental research is necessary to help establish causation.&lt;ref name="pmid21908516"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dempster EL, Pidsley R, Schalkwyk LC, Owens S, Georgiades A, Kane F, Kalidindi S, Picchioni M, Kravariti E, Toulopoulou T, Murray RM, Mill J | title = Disease-associated epigenetic changes in monozygotic twins discordant for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 20 | issue = 24 | pages = 4786–96 | date = Dec 2011 | pmid = 21908516 | pmc = 3221539 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddr416 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of resources has also limited the number of intergenerational studies.&lt;ref name="Powledge_2011" /&gt; Therefore, advancing longitudinal&lt;ref name="Guo_2010" /&gt; and multigenerational, experience-dependent studies will be critical to further understanding the role of epigenetics in psychology.&lt;ref name="Champagne" /&gt;

'''Civil liberties''' or '''personal freedoms''' are personal guarantees and freedoms that the [[government]] cannot abridge, either by law or by [[judicial interpretation]], without due process. Though the scope of the term differs between countries, civil liberties may include the [[freedom of conscience]], [[freedom of press]], [[freedom of religion]], [[freedom of expression]], [[freedom of assembly]], the right to security and [[liberty]], [[freedom of speech]], the [[right to privacy]], the right to [[legal equality|equal treatment under the law]] and [[due process]], the [[right to a fair trial]], and the [[right to life]]. Other civil liberties include the [[property rights|right to own property]], the [[self-defence|right to defend oneself]], and the right to [[bodily integrity]]. Within the distinctions between civil liberties and other types of liberty, distinctions exist between [[positive liberty]]/[[positive rights]] and [[negative liberty]]/[[negative rights]].

==Overview==
[[File:Li-ber-ty.jpg|thumb| upright|Broken Liberty: [[Istanbul]] Archaeology Museum]]
Many contemporary states have a [[constitution]], a [[bill of rights]], or similar constitutional documents that enumerate and seek to guarantee civil liberties. Other states have enacted similar laws through a variety of legal means, including signing and ratifying or otherwise giving effect to key conventions such as the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. The existence of some claimed civil liberties is a matter of dispute, as are the extent of most [[civil rights]]. Controversial examples include [[property rights]], [[reproductive rights]], and [[civil marriage]]. The degree that democracies have involved themselves in needs to take into fact the influence of terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunter|first=Lance Y.|date=2015-09-18|title=Terrorism, Civil Liberties, and Political Rights: A Cross-National Analysis|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1080%2F1057610X.2015.1084165|journal=Studies in Conflict &amp; Terrorism|language=en|volume=39|issue=2|pages=165–193|doi=10.1080/1057610x.2015.1084165|issn=1057-610X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the existence of [[victimless crime]]s infringes upon civil liberties is a matter of dispute. Another matter of debate is the suspension or alteration of certain civil liberties in times of [[war]] or [[state of emergency]], including whether and to what extent this should occur.

The formal concept of civil liberties is often dated back to [[Magna Carta]], an English legal [[charter]] agreed in 1215 which in turn was based on pre-existing documents, namely the [[Charter of Liberties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Hugh Starkey, Professor of Citizenship and Human Rights Education at UCL Institute of Education, London|title=Magna Carta and Human rights legislation|url=https://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/human-rights-legislation|publisher=British Library|accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|Constitution of People's Republic of China]] (which applies only to [[mainland China]], not to [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] and [[Taiwan]]), especially its Fundamental Rights and Duties of Citizens, claims to protect many civil liberties.
Taiwan, which is separated from China, has its own Constitution.

The Fundamental Rights—embodied in Part III of the constitution—guarantee  liberties such that all Indians can lead their lives in peace as citizens of India. The six fundamental rights are right to equality, right to freedom, right against exploitation, right to freedom of religion, cultural and educational rights and right to constitutional remedies.&lt;ref name=constpartIII&gt;[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part III|Constitution of India-Part III Fundamental Rights]].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dyfikolkata (54).jpg|thumb|left|Huge rallies like this one in [[Kolkata]] are commonplace in [[India]].]]
These include individual rights common to most [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]], incorporated in the fundamental law of the land and are enforceable in a court of law. Violations of these rights result in punishments as prescribed in the [[Indian Penal Code]], subject to discretion of the [[judiciary]]. These rights are neither absolute nor immune from constitutional amendments. They have been aimed at overturning the inequalities of pre-independence social practices. Specifically, they resulted in abolishment of un-touchability and prohibit [[discrimination]] on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. They forbid [[human trafficking]] and [[unfree labour]]. They protect cultural and educational rights of ethnic and religious [[minorities]] by allowing them to preserve their languages and administer their own educational institutions.

All people, irrespective of race, religion, caste or sex, have the right to approach the [[High Courts of India|High Courts]] or the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] for the enforcement of their fundamental rights. It is not necessary that the aggrieved party has to be the one to do so. In public interest, anyone can initiate litigation in the court on their behalf. This is known as "[[Public interest litigation]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}} This was the case where [[public interest litigation]] was introduced (date of ruling 15 December 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; High Court and Supreme Court judges can also act on their own on the basis of media reports.

The Fundamental Rights emphasize equality by guaranteeing to all citizens the access and use of public institutions and protections, irrespective of their background. The rights to life and personal liberty apply for persons of any nationality, while others, such as the freedom of speech and expression are applicable only to the [[Indian nationality law|citizens of India]] (including [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|non-resident Indian]] citizens).&lt;ref&gt;Tayal, B.B. &amp; Jacob, A.

Fundamental Rights primarily protect individuals from any arbitrary State actions, but some rights are enforceable against private individuals too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}} This was the case where Fundamental Rights were enforced against private individuals (date of ruling 15 December 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the constitution abolishes untouchability and prohibits ''[[Unfree labour|begar]]''. These provisions act as a check both on State action and actions of private individuals. Fundamental Rights are not absolute and are subject to reasonable restrictions as necessary for the protection of national interest. In the [[Basic structure#Kesavananda|''Kesavananda Bharati vs. state of Kerala'' case]], the Supreme Court ruled that all provisions of the constitution, including Fundamental Rights can be amended.&lt;ref&gt;[[Basic structure#Kesavananda|''Kesavananda Bharati vs. state of Kerala''; AIR 1973 S.C. 1461, (1973) 4 SCC 225]] – In what became famously known as the "Fundamental Rights case", the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] decided that the basic structure of the constitution was unamendable.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Parliament cannot alter the basic structure of the constitution like secularism, democracy, federalism, separation of powers. Often called the "Basic structure doctrine", this decision is widely regarded as an important part of Indian history. In the 1978 ''[[Maneka Gandhi]] v. Union of India'' case, the Supreme Court extended the doctrine's importance as superior to any parliamentary legislation.According to the verdict, no act of parliament can be considered a law if it violated the basic structure of the constitution. This landmark guarantee of Fundamental Rights was regarded as a unique example of judicial independence in preserving the sanctity of Fundamental Rights.
The Fundamental Rights can only be altered by a constitutional amendment, hence their inclusion is a check not only on the executive branch, but also on the Parliament and state legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;Tayal, B.B. &amp; Jacob, A. (2005), ''Indian History, World Developments and Civics'', p. A-24&lt;/ref&gt; The imposition of a [[State of Emergency in India|state of emergency]] may lead to a temporary suspension of the rights conferred by Article 19 (including freedoms of speech, assembly and movement, etc.) to preserve national security and public order. The [[President]] can, by order, suspend the constitutional written remedies as well.

===Japan===
{{Main article|Human rights in Japan}}
Since 1947, [[Japan]], a country with a [[constitutional monarchy]] and known for its socially “conservative society where change is gradual,” has a [[Constitution of Japan|constitution]] with a seemingly strong bill of rights at its core ([[:wikisource: Constitution of Japan#CHAPTER III. RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE PEOPLE|Chapter III. Rights and Duties of the People]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VvL8d8RH-Z8C&amp;pg=PT225&amp;dq=Japan+conservative+society+where+change+is+gradual&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjRjtG70tvNAhVE5oMKHcnhBxQQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Japan%20conservative%20society%20where%20change%20is%20gradual&amp;f=false | title=apan: A Global Studies Handbook | publisher=ABC-CLIO | author=Ellington, Lucien | year=2002 | location=Santa Barbara, CA | page=209 | isbn=1576072711}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways, it resembles the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] prior to the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], and that is because it came into life during the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[occupation of Japan]].  This constitution may have felt like a foreign imposition to the governing elites, but not to the ordinary people "who lacked faith in their discredited leaders and supported meaningful change."&lt;ref&gt;Law, David S., The Myth of the Imposed Constitution (May 26, 2013).

Available at SSRN:http://ssrn.com/abstract=2270399&lt;/ref&gt;  In the abstract, the constitution strives to secure fundamental individual liberties and rights, which are covered pointedly in articles 10 to 40.  Most salient of the human dignity articles is article 25, section 1, which guarantees that all [[:wikisource: Constitution of Japan#CHAPTER III. RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE PEOPLE|“people shall have the right to maintain the minimum standards of wholesome and cultured living.”]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.corteidh.or.cr/tablas/27531.pdf | title=Japan’s foreign policy towards human rights: uncertain changes | author=Yokota, Yozo, &amp; Chiyuki Aoi | journal=Human Rights and Comparative Foreign Policy: Foundations of Peace, edited by David Forsythe | year=2000 | volume=United Nations University Press | pages=Chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite, the adoption of this liberal constitution, often referred as the "Postwar Constitution" (戦後憲法, Sengo-Kenpō) or the "Peace Constitution" (平和憲法, Heiwa-Kenpō), the Japanese governing elites have struggled to usher in an inclusive, open and [[Pluralist society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H-HODTsc7LsC | title=Building Democracy in Japan | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Haddad,  Mary Alice | year=2012 | location=Cambridge, UK | page=59 | isbn=1107014077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even after the end of [[World War II]] and the departure of the [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers#End of SCAP|Allied government of occupation]] in 1952, Japan has been the target of international criticism for failing to admit to [[war crimes]], [[Freedom of religion|institutional religious discrimination]] and maintaining a weak [[freedom of the press]], the treatment of children, minorities, foreigners, and women, its punitive criminal justice system, and more recently, the systematic bias against [[LGBT]] people.&lt;ref name="Japan veering away"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/02/25/national/japan-veering-away-from-global-human-rights-standards-says-amnesty-international/ | title=Japan veering away from global human rights standards, says Amnesty International | work=[[The Japan Times]] | date=February 25, 2015 | accessdate=July 5, 2016 | agency=[[Kyodo News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Japan LGBT Discrimination"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.outrightinternational.org/content/un-urges-end-discrimination-against-lgbt-individuals-japan | title=UN Urges End to Discrimination Against LGBT Individuals in Japan | publisher=Outright International | work=Analysis | date=July 25, 2014 | accessdate=July 5, 2016 |author1=Suzanne Trimel }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/06/26/national/u-s-rights-report-slams-japan-on-child-abuse-prison-conditions-asylum-system/#.V3sEBJMrJE6 | title=U.S. rights report slams Japan on child abuse, prison conditions, asylum system | work=News report | date=June 26, 2015 | agency=Japan Times | accessdate=July 5, 2016 | author=Osumi, Magdalena}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The first Japanese attempt to a bill of rights was in the 19th century [[Meiji constitution]] (1890), which took both the [[Constitution of Prussia (1850)|Prussian]] (1850) and [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British]] constitutions as basic models.&lt;ref&gt;Kazuhiro Takii and David Noble, The Meiji Constitution: The Japanese Experience of the West and the Shaping of the Modern State (Tokyo, Japan: International House of Japan, 2007), 181.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it had but a meager influence in the practice of the rule of law as well as in people’s daily living.  So, the short and deliberately gradual history of struggles for personal rights and protection against government/society's impositions has yet to transform Japan into a champion of universal and individual freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Gordon, ''Postwar Japan As History''.

London: Routledge, 2013, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; According to constitutional scholar, Shigenori Matsui,

{{Quote|text= People tend to view the bill of rights as a moral imperative and not as a judicial norm. The people also tend to rely upon bureaucrats to remedy social problems, including even human rights violations, rather than the court.|author= Shigenori Matsui | source=“The protection of ‘Fundamental human rights’ in Japan.”&lt;ref&gt;“The protection of ‘Fundamental human rights’ in Japan,” a chapter in Human Rights in Asia: A Comparative Legal Study of Twelve Asian Jurisdictions, France and the USA, edited by Peerenboom, R. P., Carole Petersen, and Hongyi Chen (London: Routledge, 2006), 149&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Despite the divergences between Japan's social culture and the [[Constitutional liberalism|Liberal Constitutionalism]] that it purports to have adopted, the country has moved toward closing the gap between the notion and the practice of the law. The trend is more evident in the long term. Among several examples, the [[National Diet|Diet]] (bicameral legislature) ratified the [[International Bill of Human Rights]] in 1979 and then it passed the Law for Equal Opportunity in Employment for Men and Women in 1985, measures that were heralded as major steps toward a democratic and participatory society.  In 2015, moreover, it reached an agreement with [[Korea]] to compensate for abuses related to the so-called “[[Comfort women|women of comfort]]” that took place during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation]] of the [[Korean Peninsula|peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35188135 | title=Japan and South Korea agree WW2 'comfort women' deal | date=December 28, 2015 | agency=BBC | accessdate=July 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, human rights group, and families of the survivors condemned the agreement as patronizing and insulting.&lt;ref name=" horrific story of Korea's 'comfort women' "&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/the-horrific-story-of-koreas-comfort-women---forced-to-be-sex-sl/ | title=The horrific story of Korea's 'comfort women' - forced to be sex slaves during World War Two | work=Telegraph | date=December 29, 2015 | accessdate=July 5, 2016 | author=Sanghani, Radhika | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On its official [http://www.moj.go.jp/ENGLISH/HB/hb-03.html site], the Japanese government has identified various human rights problems. Among these are child abuses (e.g., [[bullying]], [[corporal punishment]], [[child sexual abuse]], [[child prostitution]], and [[child pornography]]), frequent neglect and ill-treatment of [[Elder abuse|elderly persons]] and individuals with [[Disability abuse|disabilities]], [[Burakumin#Discrimination in access to services|Dowa claims]] (discrimination against the [[Burakumin]]), [[Ainu people]] (indigenous people in Japan), foreign nationals, [[HIV/AIDS in Japan|HIV/AIDS carriers]], [[Hansen's disease]] patients, persons released from prison after serving their sentence, [[Victims' rights|crime victims]], people whose [[Human rights#Information and communication technologies|human rights are violated using the Internet]], the homeless, individuals with [[Gender dysphoria|
identity disorders]], and [[Misogyny|women]]. Also, the government lists systematic problems with gender biases and the standard reference to sexual preferences for jobs and other functions in society.&lt;ref name="Major problems"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.moj.go.jp/ENGLISH/HB/hb-03.html | title=Major Human Rights Problems | publisher=Ministry of Justice, Japan | work=Human Rights Bureau | date=March 6, 2009  | accessdate=July 5, 2016 | author=Government of Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human rights organizations, national and foreign, expand the list to include human rights violations that relate to government policies, as in the case of [[daiyo kangoku]] system (substitute prison) and the methods of interrogating crime suspects.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Flynn,  Reframing the Intercultural Dialogue on Human Rights: A Philosophical Approach (London: Routledge, 2014), 114.&lt;/ref&gt; The effort of these agencies and ordinary people seem to pay off. In 2016, the U.S. Department of State released a report stating that Japan's human right record is showing signs of improvement.&lt;ref name=" human rights improve but problems persist"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/04/14/national/social-issues/japan-human-rights-improve-problems-persist-u-s-state-department/#.V3tLxZMrKRs | title=Japan human rights improve but problems persist: U.S. State Department | work=Japan Times  | date=April 14, 2016 | accessdate=July 5, 2016 | author=Wanklyn, Alastair}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
Although Australia does not have an enshrined Bill of Rights or similar binding legal document, civil liberties are assumed as protected through a series of rules and conventions. Australia was a key player and signatory to the UN Universal Declaration on Human Rights (1948)

The [[Constitution of Australia]] (1900) does offer very limited protection of rights:
* the right to freedom of religion and;
* the right to freedom from discrimination based on out-of-state residence (historical prejudice based upon residence within one state affecting treatment within another)
Certain High Court interpretations of the Constitution have allowed for implied rights such as freedom of speech and the right to vote to be established, however others such as freedom of assembly and freedom of association are yet to be identified.

'''Refugee issues'''

Within the past decade Australia has experienced increasing contention regarding its treatment of those seeking asylum. Although Australia is a signatory to the UN Refugee Convention (1951), successive governments have demonstrated an increasing tightening of borders; particularly against those who seek passage via small water vessels.

The Abbott Government (2013) like its predecessors (the Gillard and Howard Governments) has encountered particular difficulty curbing asylum seekers via sea, increasingly identified as "illegal immigration". The recent involvement of the Australian Navy in refugee rescue operations has many human rights groups such as Amnesty International concerned over the "militarisation" of treatment of refugees. The current "turn-back" policy is particularly divisive, as it involves placing refugees in government lifeboats and turning them towards Indonesia. Despite opposition however, the Abbott government's response has so far seen a reduction in the amount of potential refugees undertaking the hazardous cross to Australia, which is argued by the government as an indicator for its policy success.

==Europe==

===European Convention on Human Rights===
The [[European Convention on Human Rights]], to which almost all European countries belong (apart from [[Belarus]]), enumerates a number of civil liberties and is of varying constitutional force in different European states.

===Czech Republic===
Following the [[Velvet Revolution]], a constitutional overhaul took place in [[Czech and Slovak Federal Republic|Czechoslovakia]]. In 1991, the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms]] was adopted, having the same legal standing as the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic|Constitution]]. The Czech Republic has kept the Charter in its entirety following the [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]] as Act No. 2/1993 Coll. (Constitution being No. 1).

===France===
France's 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] listed many civil liberties and is of constitutional force.

===Germany===
The [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German constitution]], the "Grundgesetz" (lit. "Base Law"), starts with an elaborate listing of civil liberties and states in sec. 1 "The dignity of man is inviolable. To respect and protect it shall be the duty of all public authority." Following the "[[Austrian System]]", the people have the right to appeal to the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] ("Bundesverfassungsgericht") if they feel their civil rights are being violated. This procedure has shaped German law considerably over the years.

===United Kingdom===
{{Main article|Civil liberties in the United Kingdom}}
Civil liberties in the [[United Kingdom]] date back to [[Magna Carta]] in 1215 and 17th century [[English common law|common law]] and [[statute law]], such as the 1628 [[Petition of Right]], the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679]] and the [[Bill of Rights 1689]]. Parts of these laws remain in statute today and are supplemented by other legislation and conventions that collectively form the uncodified [[Constitution of the United Kingdom]]. In addition, the United Kingdom is a signatory to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] which covers both [[human rights]] and civil liberties. The [[Human Rights Act 1998]] incorporates the great majority of Convention rights directly into UK law.

In June 2008 the then Shadow Home Secretary [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] [[David Davis by-election campaign, 2008|resigned his parliamentary seat]] over what he described as the "erosion of civil liberties" by the then Labour government, and was re-elected on a civil liberties platform (although he was not opposed by candidates of other major parties). This was in reference to anti-terrorism laws and in particular the extension to pre-trial detention, that is perceived by many to be an infringement of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' established in Magna Carta.

===Russia===
The [[Constitution of Russia|Constitution of the Russian Federation]] guarantees in theory many of the same rights and civil liberties as the U.S. except to [[bear arms]], i.e.: freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of association and assembly, freedom to choose language, to due process, to a fair trial, privacy, freedom to vote, right for education, etc. However, human rights groups like [[Amnesty International]] have warned that [[Vladimir Putin]] has seriously curtailed [[freedom of expression]], [[freedom of assembly]] and [[freedom of association]] amidst growing authoritarianism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/27/russia.humanrights Putin rolling back civil rights, warns Amnesty | World news | The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;

==North America==

===Canada===
The [[Constitution of Canada]] includes the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] which guarantees many of the same rights as the U.S. constitution, with the notable exceptions of protection against [[establishment of religion]]. However, the Charter does protect [[freedom of religion]]. The Charter also omits any mention of, or protection for, property.

===United States===
{{main article|Civil liberties in the United States}}
The [[United States Constitution]], especially its [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], protects civil liberties. The passage of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] further protected civil liberties by introducing the [[Privileges or Immunities Clause]], [[Due Process Clause]], and [[Equal Protection Clause]]. Human rights within the United States are often called [[civil rights]], which are those rights, privileges and immunities held by all people, in distinction to ''political'' rights, which are the rights that inhere to those who are entitled to participate in elections, as candidates or voters.&lt;ref&gt;America's Constitution: A Biography by Akhil Reed Amar&lt;/ref&gt; Before universal suffrage, this distinction was important, since many people were ineligible to vote but still were considered to have the fundamental freedoms derived from the rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. This distinction is less important now that Americans enjoy near [[universal suffrage]], and civil liberties are now taken to include the political rights to vote and participate in elections.  Because Indian tribal governments retain sovereignty over tribal members, the U.S. Congress in 1968 enacted a law that essentially applies most of the protections of the Bill of Rights to tribal members, to be enforced mainly by tribal courts.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. McCarthy, Civil Rights in Tribal Courts; The Indian Bill of Rights at 30 Years, 34 IDAHO LAW REVIEW 465 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Civil Liberties Act of 1988 was signed into effect by President Ronald Reagan on August 10, 1988. The act was passed by Congress to issue a public apology for those of Japanese ancestry who lost their property and liberty due to discriminatory actions by the United States Government during the internment period.

This act also provided many other benefits within various sectors of the government. Within the treasury it establishes a civil liberties public education fund. It directs the Attorney General to identify and locate each individual affected by this act and to pay them $20,000 from the civil liberties public education fund. It also established a board of directors who is responsible for making disbursements from this fund. Finally, it requires that all documents and records that are created or received by the commission be kept in the United States archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foley|first1=Thomas|title=Civil Liberties Act of 1987 - Conference Report|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/100th-congress/house-bill/442|website=Congress.gov|accessdate=2015-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''civil penalty''' or '''civil fine''' is a financial penalty imposed by a [[government agency]] as restitution for wrongdoing.  The wrongdoing is typically defined by a [[Codification (law)|codification]] of [[legislation]], [[regulation]]s, and [[decree]]s. The civil fine is not considered to be a [[Crime|criminal]] [[punishment]], because it is primarily sought in order to compensate the state for harm done to it, rather than to punish the wrongful conduct. As such, a civil penalty, in itself, will not carry jail time or other legal penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbs2.com/cc.htm|title=Differences between Civil and Criminal Law in the USA|date=1998|author=Ronald B. Standler|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=July 2014}} For example, if a person were to dump toxic waste in a state park, the state would have the same right to seek to recover the cost of cleaning up the mess as would a private landowner, and to bring the complaint to a [[court]] of law, if necessary.

Civil penalties occupy a strange place in some legal systems - because they are not criminal penalties, the state need not meet a [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] that is "[[balance of probabilities]]"; but because the action is brought by the government, and some civil penalties can run into the millions of dollars, it would be uncomfortable to subject citizens to them by a burden of proof that is merely a "[[preponderance of the evidence]]." Therefore, the assessment of most civil penalties requires a finding of "[[clear and convincing evidence]]" before a civil defendant will be held liable. A defendant may well raise [[excuse|excuses, justifications]], [[affirmative defense]]s,  and [[procedural defense]]s. An [[administrative law judge]] or [[hearing officer]] may oversee the proceedings and render a [[Legal judgment|judgment]]. Judgment is made on the balance of probabilities, meaning if it is more than fifty percent likely that the accused is responsible then the accused shall be found guilty.

In some cases, a civil penalty may be supplemented by other legal process, including administrative sanctions or even criminal charges, and their respective [[appeal]]s. For example, failure to pay a fine assessed for a [[traffic code]] violation may result in administrative suspension of a [[driver's license]], and further driving after suspension may be a criminal offense. On the other hand, a minimal case may be "put on file", or otherwise suspended for a period during which the defendant may be required to avoid further violations, or carry out specific duties (such as making repairs or restitution, or attending supplemental education), after which the matter is dismissed.

In other cases, such as [[public safety]] and [[consumer protection]] violations, the local authorities may revoke permits and licenses, and seek [[injunction]] to stop or remove non-conforming works or goods, in addition to the civil penalty.

Pending or admitted civil violations may also be used as [[evidence]] of [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] in a [[lawsuit|civil suit]]. One example is [[speed limit|speeding]] causing in a [[car accident]], resulting in a [[wrongful death claim]].  However, the plaintiff may be required to prove [[causation (law)|causation]] through a harm encompassed in the regulations.

== Civil Penalties in England ==
The concept of civil penalties in English is in a state of flux.  In contract, damages is a remedy to provide monetary compensation for loss; and damages may be unliquidated (general damages), or liquidated (pre-determined).  In the absence of an out-of court settlement, unliquidated damages must be ascertained by a court or tribunal, whereas liquidated damages will be determined by reference to the contract or to a mutually agreed arbitrator.  The purpose of liquidated damages is to provide certainty and to avoid both the bother and cost of legal proceedings. 

It is well established that liquidated  damages for breach of contract are void if they seek to punish rather than to compensate for loss.  For a contractual "penalty" clause to be valid,  one must show that it was drawn up after a bona fide attempt to estimate loss in advance of the breach.   For example, a motorway construction contract may have an estimated finish date with a "penalty clause" for every day late; but provided that this date is realistic and the "penalty" is a reasonable approximation of loss, the clause will be valid. The validity of the clause will be advanced if there is an equivalent bonus for finishing early.

Difficulties can arise with fines for wrongful parking (parking in the wrong area, or overstaying).  There are three scenarios: (i) parking on public streets; &amp; parking in a private car park either (ii) with permission, or (iii) without permission.  If a parking fine is imposed for type (i), since the powers exercised by the local authority have been delegated by Parliament, there is little that one can do, except to seek judicial review and allege disproportionality.  If it is type (ii), such as in a supermarket car-park, then contract rules apply.  If, say, the cost was £1 for an hour, and you got a £60 ticket for overstaying a further hour, you can legally send them an extra £1, plus (say) £5 as a contribution to their administration expenses.  If they are not satisfied, they would have to issue a county court summons, which might not be cost effective.

In type (iii) where one has parked on private land without permission, a typical notice might read: "In parking on this land, you hereby accept that your vehicle will be clamped and a £100 release charged".  Although this may seem a simple matter of [[trespass]] with an unavoidable fine, it may amount to a case of implied contract (i.e. "if you park here, you agree to pay a penalty"); and such a "penalty" (read "damages") must be proportionate or else the fine will be void.  Also, since the penalty notice could have been attached to the windscreen, the clamping of the vehicle may itself be unlawful trespass. It should be noted that since the introduction of the [[Protection of Freedoms Act 2012]] (also known as POFA), that wheel clamping is illegal unless by an Authority (e.g. Police, Local Authority or DVLA).

[[File:VHS-Video-Tape-Top-Flat.jpg|thumb|The VHS cassette in the [[Japanese horror]] film [[Ring (film)|''Ring'']] is an example of a dark medium.]]
'''Dark media''' are a type of media outlined by American philosopher [[Eugene Thacker]].

==Overview==
Discussed at length in the essay of the same name, Eugene Thacker writes that dark media are media that function too well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thacker|first1=Eugene|title=Excommunication|date=2013|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thacker writes that, "dark media have, as their aim, the mediation of that which is unavailable or inaccessible to the senses, and thus that which we are normally "in the dark" about."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thacker|first1=Eugene|title=Excommunication|date=2013|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically in works of [[Horror fiction|Horror]], dark media are relatively commonplace media that show more of the world than is expected, with the dark medium showing what lies beyond the possibility of human sense. Dark media are significant in their ability to breach the, typically unbridgeable, gap between objects being mediated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thacker|first1=Eugene|title=Excommunication|date=2013|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; With dark media, as shown in the [[Japanese horror|J-Horror]] film [[Ring (film)|''Ring'']], dark media can create a point between the natural and the supernatural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thacker|first1=Eugene|title=Excommunication|date=2013|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Ring'', the dark medium of the [[VHS|VHS cassette]] makes it possible for antagonist [[Sadako Yamamura]] to cross the threshold of a tv, and subsequently kill those that have viewed the videotape.

==Examples of dark media==
* Videotape from [[Ring (film)|''Ring'' (200000006)]].
* Machine from ''[[Long Distance Wireless Photography]]''.
* Webcam from [[Pulse (2001 film)|''Pulse'' (2001)]].

'''Distrust''' is a formal way of not [[Trust (emotion)|trust]]ing any one [[party]] too much in a situation of grave [[risk]] or deep [[doubt]]. It is commonly expressed in [[civics]] as a division or balance of powers, or in politics as means of validating [[treaty]] terms. Systems based on distrust simply divide the [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] so that [[checks and balances]] can operate. The phrase "[[Trust, but verify]]" refers specifically to distrust.

An [[electoral system]] or [[adversarial process]] inevitably is based on distrust, but not on mistrust. Parties [[compete]] in the system, but they do not compete to [[Subversion (politics)|subvert]] the system itself, or gain bad faith advantage through it - if they do they are easily caught by the others. Much mistrust does exist between parties, and it is exactly this which motivates putting in place a [[formal system]] of distrust. [[Diplomatic protocol]] for instance, which applies between [[Sovereign state|states]], relies on such means as [[formal disapproval]] which in effect say "we do not trust that person". It also tends to rely on a strict etiquette - distrusting each person's habits to signal their intent, and instead relying on a global standard for [[behaviour]] in sensitive social settings.

A [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] as defined in [[computer science]] uses a more formal idea of distrust itself. Different parts of a system are not supposed to "trust" each other but rather perform specific assertions, [[Object (computer science)|requests]] and [[Verification and Validation (software)|validations]]. Once these are passed, the responsibility for [[error]]s lies strictly with the receiving part of the system, not that which sent the original information. Applying this principle inside one program is called contract-based design.

[[Corporate governance]] relies on distrust insofar as the board is not to trust the reports it receives from [[management]], but is empowered to investigate them, challenge them, and otherwise act on behalf of [[shareholder]]s vs. [[Management|managers]]. The fact that they rarely or never do so in most American companies is a sign that the distrust relationship has broken down - [[accounting scandal]]s and calls for [[accounting reform]] are the inevitable result. It is precisely to avoid such larger crises of trust in "the [[system]]" that formal distrust measures are put in place to begin with.

== Study ==
[[Neuroeconomics]] explain how economists are attempting to understand why humans trust or distrust others by recording physiological measurements during trust experiments.&lt;ref name="The Neuroeconomics of Distrust"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zak|first=Paul J.|author2=Karla Borja|author3=William T. Matzner|author4=Robert Kurzban|date=|year=2005|title=The Neuroeconomics of Distrust: Sex Differences in Behavior and Physiology|url=http://www.nexthumanproject.com/references/Neuroeconomics_of_Distrust.pdf|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=95|issue=2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economists conducted an experiment observing distrust through a trust game. Subjects were asked to anonymously donate various amounts of money to other anonymous subjects with no guarantee of receiving money in return. Various conditions were run of the experiment and after each decision, subjects' levels of DHT were measured. The results of this experiment suggest men and women respond to distrust physiologically differently; a heightened level of the hormone [[Dihydrotestosterone|Dihydrotestosterone (DHT)]] in men is associated with distrust. However, more experiments need to be conducted and more results need to be obtained to accurately state the relationship between the amount of DHT present in males and responses to distrust.&lt;ref name="The Neuroeconomics of Distrust" /&gt;

Distrust has also been shown to increase the speed and performance of individuals and groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lowry|first=Paul Benjamin|author2=Justin Scott Giboney|author3=Ryan Schuetzler|author4=Jacob Richardson|author5=Tom Gregory|author6=John Romney|author7=Bonnie Anderson|title=The Value of Distrust in Computer-Based Decision-Making Groups|journal=43rd Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences|date=5–8 January 2009|ssrn=1487345}}&lt;/ref&gt;  at certain tasks. One way to classify tasks is to split them into routine (normal, usual) and nonroutine (creative, unusual, undefined). In experiments distrust has been shown to increase performance in nonroutine tasks while decreasing performance in routine tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schul|first=Y.|author2=Mayo, R. |author3= Burnstein, E. |title=The value of distrust|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2008|volume=44|issue=5|pages=1293–1302|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2008.05.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on high risk settings such as oil platforms, investment banking, medical surgery, aircraft piloting and nuclear powerplants has related distrust to failure avoidance.&lt;ref&gt;Conchie, S. M. &amp; Donald, I. J. (2007). The functions and development of safety-specific trust and distrust. Safety Science, 46(1) 92-103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burns, C., Mearns, K. &amp; McGeorge, P. (2006). Explicit and Implicit Trust Within Safety Culture. Risk Analysis, 26(5), 1139-1150.&lt;/ref&gt; When non-routine strategies are needed, distrusting persons perform better, while when routine strategies are needed trusting persons perform better.&lt;ref&gt;Schul, Y., Mayo, R., &amp; Burnstein, E. (2008). The Value of Distrust. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 44, 1293–1302.&lt;/ref&gt; This research was extended to entrepreneurial firms by Gudmundsson and Lechner.&lt;ref name="GUDMUNDSSON, S.V 2013"&gt;GUDMUNDSSON, S.V. and LECHNER, C. (2013) Cognitive Biases, Organization, and Entrepreneurial Firm Survival. European Management Journal, 31(3), 278-294&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that in entrepreneurial firms the threat of failure is ever present resembling non-routine situations in high risk settings. They found that the firms of distrusting entrepreneurs were more likely to survive than the firms of optimistic or overconfident entrepreneurs. The reasons were that distrusting entrepreneurs would emphasize failure avoidance through sensible task selection, and more analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Teach, R.D., Schwartz, R.G., &amp; Tarpley, F.A. (1989). The recognition and exploitation of opportunity in the software industry: a study of surviving firms. Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research. Wellesley, MA: Babson College, 383–397.&lt;/ref&gt; Kets de Vries has pointed out that distrusting entrepreneurs are more alert about their external environment.&lt;ref name="Vries, M. 2003"&gt;Kets de Vries, M. (2003). The entrepreneur on the couch. INSEAD Quarterly, 5, 17-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, distrusting entrepreneurs are less likely to discount negative events, and are more likely to engage control mechanisms.&lt;ref name="GUDMUNDSSON, S.V 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis, J. H., Schoorman, F. D., &amp; Donaldson, L. (1997). Toward a stewardship theory of management.

Trust and distrust: New relationships and realities. Academy of Management Review, 23, 438 – 458.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, according to Gudmundsson and Lechner distrust leads to higher precaution and therefore increases chances of entrepreneurial firm survival.&lt;ref name="GUDMUNDSSON, S.V 2013"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19398">'''Due process''' is the legal requirement that the state must respect all [[legal rights]] that are owed to a person. Due process balances the power of [[law of the land]] and protects the individual person from it. When a government harms a person without following the exact course of the law, this constitutes a due process violation, which offends the [[rule of law]].

[[File:Attorney General Seal Variant.jpg|thumb|right|A variant of [[Lady Justice]] used in [[California Department of Justice|California]], wherein the blindfold covering her eyes represents the due process of law]]

Due process has also been frequently interpreted as limiting [[law]]s and [[legal process|legal proceedings]] (see [[substantive due process]]) so that judges, instead of legislators, may define and guarantee fundamental fairness, justice, and liberty. That interpretation has proven controversial. Analogous to the concepts of [[natural justice]], and [[procedural justice]] used in various other jurisdictions, the interpretation of due process is sometimes expressed as a command that the government must not be unfair to the people or abuse them physically.
The term is not used in contemporary English law, but two similar concepts are [[natural justice]], which generally applies only to decisions of administrative agencies and some types of private bodies like trade unions, and the British constitutional concept of the [[rule of law]] as articulated by [[A. V. Dicey]] and others.&lt;ref name="Marshall, 69"&gt;Geoffrey Marshall, "Due Process in England", in ''Nomos XVIII: Due Process'', eds. J. Roland Pennock &amp; John W. Chapman, 69–92 (New York: New York University Press, 1977), 69.&lt;/ref&gt; However, neither concept lines up perfectly with the American theory of due process, which, as explained below, presently contains many implied rights not found in either ancient or modern concepts of due process in England.&lt;ref
name="Marshall, 69–70"&gt;Marshall, 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due process developed from clause 39 of [[Magna Carta]] in England. Reference to due process first appeared in a statutory rendition of clause 39 in 1354 thus: "No man of what state or condition he be, shall be put out of his lands or tenements nor taken, nor disinherited, nor put to death, without he be brought to answer by due process of law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt5bfrag1_user.html| title = CRS Annotated Constitution: Due Process| accessdate = June 30, 2014
| publisher = Cornell University Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt; When English and American law gradually diverged, due process was not upheld in England but became incorporated in the [[US Constitution]].

==By jurisdiction==

===Magna Carta===
In clause 39 of [[Magna Carta]], issued in 1215, [[John of England]] promised: "No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his standing in any other way, nor will we proceed with force against him, or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgment of his equals or by the law of the land."&lt;ref name="Magna"&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/magnacarta.html The Text of Magna Carta (1215)]&lt;/ref&gt; Magna Carta itself immediately became part of the "[[law of the land]]", and Clause 61 of that charter authorized an elected body of 25 barons to determine by majority vote what redress the King must provide when the King offends "in any respect against any man."&lt;ref name="Magna"/&gt; Thus, Magna Carta established the [[rule of law]] in England by not only requiring the monarchy to obey the law of the land but also limiting how the monarchy could change the law of the land. However, in the 13th century, the provisions may have been referring only to the rights of landowners, and not to ordinary peasantry or villagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McKechnie |first=William Sharp |title=Magna Carta: A Commentary on the Great Charter of King John |publisher=Robert MacLehose and Co., Ltd. |year=1905 |location=Glasgow |pages=136–37 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCWIAAAAMAAJ}}: "The question must be considered an open one; but much might be said in favor of the opinion that 'freeman' as used in the Charter is synonymous with 'freeholder'...."&lt;/ref&gt;

Shorter versions of Magna Carta were subsequently issued by British [[monarchs]], and Clause 39 of Magna Carta was renumbered "29."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/magna_carta/translation.html The Text of Magna Carta (1297)]&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase ''due process of law'' first appeared in a statutory rendition of Magna Carta in 1354 during the reign of [[Edward III of England]], as follows: "No man of what state or condition he be, shall be put out of his lands or tenements nor taken, nor disinherited, nor put to death, without he be brought to answer by due process of law."&lt;ref&gt;28 Edw. 3, c. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1608, the English jurist [[Edward Coke]] wrote a treatise in which he discussed the meaning of Magna Carta. Coke explained that no man shall be deprived but by ''legem terrae'', the law of the land, "that is, by the common law, statute law, or custom of England.... (that is, to speak it once and for all) by the due course, and process of law.."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/18th/coke2nd1797/coke2nd1797_051-100.pdf 2 ''Institutes of the Laws of England'' 46 (1608)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the clause in Magna Carta and the later statute of 1354 were again explained in 1704 (during the reign of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]) by the [[King's Bench|Queen's Bench]], in the case of ''Regina v. Paty''.&lt;ref name="paty"&gt;''Regina v. Paty'', 92 Eng. Rep. 232, 234 (1704) reprinted in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=SA4wAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1108&amp;lpg=PA1108&amp;dq=%22not+confined+to+the+common+law+but+takes+in+all+the+other+laws+which+are+in+force+in+this+realm%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=TXaUQaHu_X&amp;sig=x3B0WSlbDv2Y0HufHcrZAfneS6U Reports of Cases Argued and Adjudged in the Courts of King's Bench and Common Pleas: In the Reigns of the Late King William, Queen Anne, King George the First, and King George the Second]'', Vol. 2, pp. 1105, 1108.(1792).&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, the [[British House of Commons]] had deprived John Paty and certain other citizens of the right to vote in an election and committed them to [[Newgate Prison]] merely for the offense of pursuing a legal action in the courts.&lt;ref&gt;Dudley Julius Medly, [https://books.google.com/books?num=100&amp;q=%22julius+medley%22+and+%22Manual+of+english+constitutional+history%22+and+1902&amp;as_brr=1 ''A Student's Manual of English Constitutional History'' 613 (1902)]&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen's Bench, in an opinion by Justice Powys,{{clarification needed|date=January 2018|reason=Finding for which party?}} explained the meaning of "due process of law" as follows:
{{quote|[I]t is objected, that by Mag. Chart. c. 29, no man ought to be taken or imprisoned, but by the law of the land. But to this I answer, that lex terrae is not confined to the common law, but takes in all the other laws, which are in force in this realm; as the civil and canon law.... By the 28 Ed. 3, c. 3, there the words lex terrae, which are used in Mag. Char. are explained by the words, due process of law; and the meaning of the statute is, that all commitments must be by a legal authority; and the law of Parliament is as much a law as any, nay, if there be any superiority this is a superior law.&lt;ref name="paty"/&gt;}}

[[John Holt (judge)|Chief Justice Holt]] dissented in this case because he believed that the commitment had not in fact been by a legal authority. The House of Commons had purported to legislate unilaterally, without approval of the [[British House of Lords]], ostensibly to regulate the election of its members.&lt;ref&gt;George Godfrey Cunningham,[https://books.google.com/books?num=100&amp;q=%22John+Paty%2C+and+four+others%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=1 4 ''Lives of Eminent and Illustrious Englishmen'' 54 (1835)]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Queen's Bench held that the House of Commons had not infringed or overturned due process, John Paty was ultimately freed by Queen Anne when she [[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogued]] Parliament.

===English law and American law diverge===

Throughout centuries of British history, many laws and treatises asserted various requirements as being part of "due process" or included in the "law of the land". That view usually held in regards to what was required by existing law, rather than what was intrinsically required by due process itself. As the [[United States Supreme Court]] has explained, a due process requirement in Britain was not "essential to the idea of due process of law in the prosecution and punishment of crimes, but was only mentioned as an example and illustration of due process of law as it actually existed in cases in which it was customarily used."&lt;ref name="caselaw1"&gt;''Hurtado v. California'', {{ussc|110|516|1884}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the scattered references to "due process of law" in [[English law]] did not limit the power of the government; in the words of American law professor [[John V. Orth]], "the great phrases failed to retain their vitality."&lt;ref&gt;John V. Orth, ''Due Process of Law: A Brief History'' ([[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence, KS]]: University Press of Kansas, 2003), 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; Orth points out that this is generally attributed to the rise of the doctrine of [[parliamentary supremacy]] in the United Kingdom, which was accompanied by hostility towards [[judicial review]] as an undemocratic foreign invention.&lt;ref&gt;Orth, 28–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have occasionally interpreted Lord Coke's ruling in ''[[Dr. Bonham's Case]]'' as implying the possibility of judicial review, but by the 1870s, [[John Campbell, 1st Baron Campbell|Lord Campbell]] was dismissing judicial review as "a foolish doctrine alleged to have been laid down extra-judicially in Dr. Bonham's Case..., a conundrum [that] ought to have been laughed at."&lt;ref&gt;Orth, 29.&lt;/ref&gt;
Lacking the power of judicial review, English courts possessed no means by which to declare government statutes or actions invalid as a violation of due process. In contrast, American legislators and executive branch officers possessed virtually no means by which to overrule judicial invalidation of statutes or actions as due process violations, with the sole exception of proposing a constitutional amendment, which are rarely successful.&lt;ref&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court recognized that it is nearly impossible for the legislative branch to overrule the Court's constitutional interpretations in ''[[Washington v. Glucksberg]]'', 521 U.S. 702, 720 (1997): "By extending constitutional protection to an asserted right or liberty interest, we, to a great extent, place the matter outside the arena of public debate and legislative action. We must therefore exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in this field."&lt;/ref&gt;  As a consequence, English law and American law diverged.  Unlike their English counterparts, American judges became increasingly assertive about enforcing due process of law.  In turn, the legislative and executive branches learned how to avoid such confrontations in the first place, by tailoring statutes and executive actions to the constitutional requirements of due process as elaborated upon by the judiciary.

In 1977, an English political science professor explained the present situation in England for the benefit of American lawyers:
&lt;blockquote&gt;An American constitutional lawyer might well be surprised by the elusiveness of references to the term 'due process of law' in the general body of English legal writing.... Today one finds no space devoted to due process in Halsbury's ''Laws of England'', in Stephen's ''Commentaries'', or Anson's ''Law and Custom of the Constitution.'' The phrase rates no entry in such works as Stroud's ''Judicial Dictionary'' or Wharton's ''Law Lexicon.''&lt;ref name="Marshall, 69" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two similar concepts in contemporary English law are [[natural justice]], which generally applies only to decisions of administrative agencies and some types of private bodies like trade unions, and the British constitutional concept of the [[rule of law]] as articulated by [[A. V. Dicey]] and others.&lt;ref name="Marshall, 69"/&gt; However, neither concept lines up perfectly with the American conception of due process, which presently contains many implied rights not found in the ancient or modern concepts of due process in England.&lt;ref name="Marshall, 69–70"/&gt;

===United States===
{{main article|Due Process Clause}}
The [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendments]] to the [[United States Constitution]] each contain a [[Due Process Clause]]. Due process deals with the administration of justice and thus the Due Process Clause acts as a safeguard from arbitrary denial of life, liberty, or property by the government outside the sanction of law.&lt;ref name="PAMadisonDPC"&gt;{{cite web |last=Madison |first=P. A. |title=Historical Analysis of the Meaning of the 14th Amendment's First Section |url=http://www.federalistblog.us/mt/articles/14th_dummy_guide.htm#due |publisher=The Federalist Blog |accessdate=19 January 2013|date=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] interprets the clauses as providing four protections: [[procedural due process]] (in civil and criminal proceedings), [[substantive due process]], a prohibition against [[void for vagueness|vague]] laws, and as the vehicle for the [[incorporation of the Bill of Rights]].

===Others===
Various countries recognize some form of due process under [[custom (law)|customary]] [[international law]]. Although the specifics are often unclear, most nations agree that they should guarantee foreign visitors a basic minimum level of justice and fairness. Some nations have argued that they are bound to grant no more rights to aliens than they do to their own [[citizens]], the doctrine of [[national treatment]], which also means that both would be vulnerable to the same deprivations by the government. With the growth of [[international human rights law]] and the frequent use of [[treaty|treaties]] to govern treatment of foreign nationals abroad, the distinction, in practice, between these two perspectives may be disappearing.

In [[biochemistry]], an '''Eadie–Hofstee diagram''' (also '''Woolf–Eadie–Augustinsson–Hofstee''' or '''Eadie–Augustinsson plot''') is a graphical representation of [[enzyme kinetics]] in which [[reaction rate]] is plotted as a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of the ratio between rate and [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] [[concentration]]:

:&lt;math&gt;v = -K_M { v \over [S] } + V_\max&lt;/math&gt;

where ''v'' represents reaction rate, ''K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Michaelis–Menten constant]], [''S''] is the substrate concentration, and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is the maximum reaction rate.

It can be derived from the Michaelis–Menten equation as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;v = {{V_\max{} [S]} \over {K_M + [S]}}&lt;/math&gt;

invert and multiply with &lt;math&gt;V_\max&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; {V_\max \over v} = {{V_\max{}(K_M+[S])}\over{V_\max{}[S]}} = {{K_M+[S]}\over{[S]}}&lt;/math&gt;

Rearrange:

:&lt;math&gt; V_\max = {{{vK_M} \over {[S]}} + {{v[S]} \over {[S]}}} = {{vK_M}\over {[S]}} + v&lt;/math&gt;

Isolate v:

:&lt;math&gt;v = -K_M{v \over {[S]}} + V_\max&lt;/math&gt;

A plot of v against ''v''/[S] will hence yield ''V''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; as the y-intercept, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;/K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; as the x-intercept, and ''K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;'' as the negative  slope. Like other techniques that linearize the [[Michaelis–Menten equation]], the Eadie-Hofstee plot was used historically for rapid identification of important kinetic terms like ''K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, but has been superseded by [[nonlinear regression]] methods that are significantly more accurate and no longer computationally inaccessible.  It is also more robust against error-prone data than the [[Lineweaver–Burk plot]], particularly because it gives equal weight to data points in any range of substrate concentration or reaction rate. (The Lineweaver–Burk plot unevenly weights such points.)  Both plots remain useful as a means to present data graphically.

One drawback from the Eadie–Hofstee approach is that neither [[ordinate]] nor [[abscissa]] represent [[independent variable]]s: both are dependent on reaction rate. Thus any experimental error will be present in both axes. Also, experimental error or [[Propagation of uncertainty|uncertainty will propagate]] unevenly and become larger over the [[abscissa]] thereby giving more weight to smaller values of ''v''/[S]. Therefore, the typical measure of goodness of fit for [[linear regression]], the correlation coefficient ''R'', is not applicable.

'''Four discourses''' is a concept developed by French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]]. He argued that there were four fundamental types of '''discourse'''. He defined four discourses, which he called Master, University, Hysteric and Analyst, and suggested that these relate dynamically to one another&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neill|first=Calum|date=2013-06-01|title=Breaking the text: An introduction to Lacanian discourse analysis|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0959354312473520|journal=Theory &amp; Psychology|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=334–350|doi=10.1177/0959354312473520|issn=0959-3543}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
 
*'''Discourse of the University''' – Provision and worship of "objective" knowledge — usually in the unacknowledged service of some external master discourse.
*'''Discourse of the Master''' – Struggle for mastery / domination / penetration.  Based on Hegel's [[master–slave dialectic]]. 
*'''Discourse of the Hysteric''' – Symptoms embodying and revealing resistance to the prevailing master discourse.
*'''Discourse of the Analyst''' – Deliberate subversion of the prevailing master discourse.

Lacan's theory of the four discourses was initially developed in 1969, perhaps in response to the events of social unrest during [[May 1968 in France]], but also through his discovery of what he believed were deficiencies in the orthodox reading of the [[Oedipus complex|Oedipus Complex]]. The Four Discourses theory is presented in his seminar ''L'envers de la psychanalyse'' and in ''Radiophonie'', where he starts using "discourse" as a social bond founded in [[intersubjectivity]].  He uses the term discourse to stress the transindividual nature of language: speech always implies another subject.

==Necessity of Formalising Psychoanalysis==

Prior to the development of the Four Discourses, the primary guideline for clinical psychoanalysis was Freud's Oedipus Complex. In Lacan's Seminar of 1969-70, Lacan argues that the terrifying Oedipal father that Freud invoked was already castrated at the point of intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=stanford encyclopedia of philosophy |website=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lacan/#sect2.4.1 |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The castration was symbolic rather than physical. In an effort to stem analysts' tendency to project their own[[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|imaginary]] readings and neurotic fantasies onto psychoanalysis, Lacan worked to formalise psychoanalytic theory with mathematical functions with renewed focus on the semiology of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]. This would ensure only a minimum of teaching is lost when communicated and also provide the conceptual architecture to limit the [[Free association (psychology)|associations]] of the analyst.

==Structure==

Discourse, in the first place, refers to a point where [[Langue and parole|speech and language]] intersect. The four discourses represent the four possible formulations of the symbolic network which social bonds can take and can be expressed as the permutations of a four-term configuration showing the relative positions — the agent, the other, the product and the truth — of four terms, [[the subject]], the [[master signifier]], [[knowledge]] and [[objet petit a]].

The four positions in each discourse are :

Agent = Upper left. This is the speaker of the discourse

Other = Upper right. This is what the discourse is addressed to

Product = Lower right. This is what the discourse has created

Truth = Lower left. This is what the discourse attempted to express

The four variables which occupy these positions are :

S1 = the master signifier

S2 = knowledge (''le savoir'')

$  = the subject (barred)

a  = the [[objet petit a]] or surplus-''jouissance''

S1 refers to "the marked circle of the field of the Other," it is the Master-Signifier. S2 is the "battery of signifiers, already there" at the place where "one wants to determine the status of a discourse as status of statement," that is knowledge (''savoir''). S1 comes into play in a signifying battery conforming the network of knowledge. $ is the subject, marked by the unbroken line (''trait unaire'') which represents it and is different from the living individual who is not the locus of this subject. Add the ''objet petit a'', the object-waste or the loss of the object that occurred when the originary division of the subject took place — the object that is the cause of desire: the ''plus-de-jouir''.

'''Discourse of the Master''':

It is the basic discourse from which the other three derive. The dominant position is occupied by the master signifier, S1, which represents the subject, S, for all other signifiers: S2. In this signifying operation there is a surplus: ''objet a''. All attempts at totalisation are doomed to fail. This discourse masks the division of the subject, it illustrates the structure of the dialectic of the master and the slave. The master, S1, is the agent who puts the slave, S2, to work: the result is a surplus, ''objet a'', that the master struggles to appropriate.

'''Discourse of the University''':

It is caused by an anticlockwise quarter turn of the previous discourse. The dominant position is occupied by knowledge (''savoir''). An attempt to mastery can be traced behind the endeavors to impart neutral knowledge: domination of the other to whom knowledge is transmitted. This hegemony is visible in modernity with science.

'''Discourse of the Hysteric''':

It is effected by a clockwise quarter turn of the discourse of the master. It is not simply "that which is uttered by the hysteric," but a certain kind of articulation in which any subject may be inscribed. The divided subject, $, the symptom, is in the pole position. This discourse points toward knowledge. "The cure involves the structural introduction of the discourse of the hysteric by way of artificial conditions": the analyst hystericizes the analysand's discourse.

'''Discourse of the Analyst''':

It is produced by a quarter turn of the discourse of the hysteric in the same way as Freud develops psychoanalysis by giving an interpretative turn to the discourse of his hysterical patients. The position of the agent — the analyst — is occupied by ''objet a'': the analyst becomes the cause of the analysand's desire. This discourse being the reverse of the discourse of the master, does it make psychoanalysis an essentially subversive practice which undermines attempts at domination and mastery?

==Relevance for cultural studies==

[[Slavoj Žižek]] uses the theory to explain various cultural artefacts, including ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' and ''[[Parsifal]]''.

In [[information visualization]] and [[computing]], '''GapChart''' is a [[chart]] for displaying [[time series]] data by using non overlapped thick curves. It was invented in 2013 by Fred. Vernier (LIMSI labs at Univ. Paris Sud) and Charles Perin (LIMSI labs at Univ. Paris Sud and AVIZ-INRIA). Jeremy Boy (AVIZ-INRIA) helped them to improve the original design to its current form.

== Main idea ==
GapChart display one thick curve by time series data. At each time step curves display a flat part and a transition part. Flat parts are separated by gaps proportional to data difference. When two or more time series have same value at the same time step they are distinguished by an external method and represented side by side. Transition steps are represented by straight or S shaped link. They can partially overlap but never totally since star
Labels can fit inside thick curves where i't not too steep and different colors ca be used to better distinguish elements.

[[File:ComparizonGapChart.png|comparison of GapChart with RankChart and SlopeGraph]]
* GapChart can be compared to RankChart with additional space between curves to represent value difference behind the ranking
* GapChart can be compared to SlopeGraph where curve thickness is removed from the layout and equal values are distinguished with an external method 
* GapChart can be compared to table of numbers which are commonly available for many rankings

== Visual attributes ==
* Curves can be shaded (top to bottom) to better distinguish multiple elements with the same number of points.
* Space between curves can be decorated with tick lines (i.e. marking every block of 3, 5 or 10 points according to the application domain) to better visually evaluate gaps 
* Labels can be added on curves if thick enough and only where not too steep
* Consistent well chosen colors can help to follow elements of interest
* Top Right and/or Top Left labels can help drawing a full list of elements or initial/final scores
* Inspectors can be used on mouse hover in interactive gapChart to display quantitative ranks and scores (or any relevant information like match in championships)

== Application domains ==
* [[Sport]]: GapChart perfectly apply to all [[Championship]] with points and rankings. Colors can be used to highlight qualified teams or relegated ones. 
* [[Finance]]: GapChart can be used to compare stocks, index or fund yields along time while ranking them when is pertinent 
* [[Economy]]: GapChart is useful to compare a list of countries/states in different indexes (for instance NRI) or companies (i.e. Fortune 500)
* [[Academic]]: GapChart can be used to follow different rankings (i.e. Shanghai ranking, h-indexes, impact factors, ...)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8617">[[File:Erik Erikson.png|thumb|Erik Erikson(1902-1994) was the first to use the term generativity.]]

The term '''generativity''' was coined by the psychoanalyst [[Erik Erikson]] in 1950 to denote "a concern for establishing and guiding the next generation."&lt;ref&gt;Slater, C. L. (2003). Generativity Versus Stagnation: An Elaboration of Erikson's Adult Stage of Human Development. Journal of Adult Development, 10(1), 53-65. Retrieved February 18, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; He first used the term while defining the Care stage in his theory of the stages of psychosocial development.

[[Jonathan Zittrain]] adopted the term in 2006 to refer to “the ability of a technology platform or technology ecosystem to create, generate or produce new output, structure or behavior without input from the originator of the system.”&lt;ref name=GenInt&gt;Zittrain, J. L. (2006). The Generative Internet. Harvard Law Review, 119, 1974-2040. doi:10.1145/1435417.1435426&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In 1950 Erik Erikson created the term generativity to explain the Care stage in his theory of the stages of psychosocial development. The Care stage encompasses the middle ages of one’s life, from 40 through 64. Generativity was defined as the “ability to transcend personal interests to provide care and concern for younger and older generations.”&lt;ref&gt;Hutchison, Elizabeth D. Dimensions of Human Behavior: The Changing Life Course. 4th ed., vol. 10, SAGE Publications Ltd, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It took over 30 years for generativity to become a subject of empirical research. Modern psychoanalysts, starting in the early 1990s, have included a concern for one’s legacy, referred to as an “inner desire for immortality”, in the definition of generativity.&lt;ref name=mcadams&gt;McAdams, D. P., &amp; De St. Aubin, E. (1992). A Theory of Generativity and Its Assessment through Self-Report, Behavioral Acts, and Narrative Themes in Autobiography. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 62(6), 1003-1015. Retrieved February 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the term has been adopted by people who deal with technology, first used by Johnathan Zittrain in 2006. Generativity in technology is defined as “the ability of a technology platform or technology ecosystem to create, generate or produce new output, structure or behavior without input from the originator of the system.”&lt;ref name="GenInt" /&gt; An example of this could be the [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] mobile operating systems, for which developers have created millions of unique applications. It has been argued that the open Internet is both an inspiration of generativity and a means to spread the products of generativity. However, some people including Johnathan Zittrain fear that society and technology are moving away from a generative internet, claiming “A shift in consumer priorities from generativity to stability will compel undesirable responses from regulators and markets and, if unaddressed, could prove decisive in closing today’s open computing environments.”&lt;ref name=GenInt /&gt;

== Use in Psychology ==
Psychologically, generativity is concern for the future, a need to nurture and guide younger people and contribute to the next generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/732894649|title=Dimensions of a new identity|last=1902-1994.|first=Erikson, Erik H. (Erik Homburger),|publisher=W.W. Norton and Co|isbn=9780393009231|oclc=732894649}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erikson argued that this usually develops during middle age (which spans ages 40 through 64) in keeping with his stage-model of [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|psychosocial development]].&lt;ref name=stage&gt;HQ, Psychology. "Erikson's Stages Of Development - Stages 7 And 8". Psychologynoteshq.com. N. p., 2017. Web. 27 Feb. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; After having experienced old age himself, Erikson believed that generativity maintains a more important role in later life than he initially had thought.

In Erikson’s theory Generativity is contrasted with Stagnation.&lt;ref name=stage /&gt; During this stage, people contribute to the next generation through caring, teaching, engaging in creative work which contributes to society. Generativity involves answering the question "Can I Make My Life Count?", and in this process, finding your life’s work and contributing to the development of others through activities such as volunteering, mentoring, and contributing to future generations. It has also been described as a concern for one's legacy, accepting the independence lives of family and increasing philanthropic pursuits.&lt;ref name=mcadams /&gt; Generative concern leads to concrete goals and actions such as "providing a narrative schematic of the generative self to the next generation".&lt;ref&gt;Cheng, S.-T. "Generativity In Later Life: Perceived Respect From Younger Generations As A Determinant Of Goal Disengagement And Psychological Well-Being". The Journals of Gerontology Series B: Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences 64B.1 (2009): 45-54. Web. 27 Feb. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

McAdams developed a 20-item scale to assess generativity, and to help discover who it is that is nurturing and leading the next generation.&lt;ref name="mcadams" /&gt; McAdam's model is not restricted to stages, with generativity able to be a concern throughout adulthood, not just in middle adulthood, as Erikson suggested. Example items include "I try to pass along the knowledge that I have gained through my experiences", "I have a responsibility to improve the neighborhood in which I live", and (reversed) "In general, my actions do not have a positive effect on other people."

== Use in Technology ==

Generativity in technology refers to cases where a technology supports the creation of novel products. Such technologies are referred to as [[generative systems]]. Canonical examples are the PC and the Internet.&lt;ref name="GenInt" /&gt; From its inception, the internet has acted as a generative force allowing users to create and communicate in ways unimagined but foreseen by its creators who for this purpose built-in an openness and hardware and software agnosticism.&lt;ref&gt;"Cultures Of The Internet". Google Books. N. p., 2017. Web. 6 Mar. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zittrain was first to apply this term outside psychology, in cases where a generative technology leads to "unanticipated change through unfiltered contributions from broad and varied audiences."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/INF5210/h14/slides/group-lectures/generativity-updated.pdf. N. p., 2017. Web. 6 Mar. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Zittrain has also highlighted that precarious nature of generative technology: arguing that features which, for instance, may enhance security and stability may, even unintentionally reduce or destroy a generativity in a system. He highlighted cases in which apparently innocuous producer, consumer, and government actions from a move away from PCs to one-way systems such as "smart" appliances cause a decline in generativity.&lt;ref name="GenInt" /&gt; As a result, he emphasised the need to be clear about treating generativity, rather than apparent means supporting this as the key valued characteristic of the system. In the case of the internet/PC complex this is its capacity as a generative networked grid, rather than traits associated with this, such as "open internet" or “[[network neutrality]]”. He termed a focus on these mere-means to the end of generativity a "myopic" "end-to-end theory" which confused means with ends. Zittrain argued:&lt;blockquote&gt;focusing on “network” without regard to a particular network policy’s influence on the design of net- work endpoints such as PCs. As a result of this focus, political advo- cates of end-to-end are too often myopic; many writers seem to pre- sume current PC and OS architecture to be fixed in an “open” position. If they can be persuaded to see a larger picture, they may agree to some compromises at the network level. If complete fidelity to end-to- end network neutrality persists, our PCs may be replaced by informa- tion appliances or may undergo a transformation from open platforms to gated communities to prisons, creating a consumer information en- vironment that betrays the very principles that animate end-to-end theory. (&lt;ref name="GenInt" /&gt; p. 1978)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Green information system''' ('''green IS''') or Green IT as per International Federation of Global &amp; Green ICT "IFGICT"  is a combination of [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] and [[information technology]] (IT). The relationship between information technology and the environment is complex, because of  the negative environmental impact of IT production, use, and disposal then, making this effect greener has been termed [[Green Information Technology]], which considers IT's environmental impact primarily as a problem to be mitigated. Another effect involves the positive impact of using [[information system]]s (IS) to improve the eco-sustainability of businesses and society; this is termed green IS. This green IS viewpoint sees IS as a partial solution to many environmental problems. So green IS is a solution for the negative environmental effect of information technology. IS facilitates the reuse of waste and energy and can serve as a tool for industrial symbiosis, which involves "the mutualistic interaction of different industries for beneficial reuse of waste flows or energy cascading that results in a more resource-efficient production system and fewer adverse environmental impacts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gholami|first1=Roya|last2=Binti Sulaiman|first2=Ainin|last3=Ramayah|first3=T|last4=Molla|first4=Alemayehu|title=Senior managers’ perception on green information systems (IS) adoption and environmental performance: Results from a field survey.|journal=Information &amp; Management|date=2013|volume=50|issue=7|pages=431–438|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378720613000724|doi=10.1016/j.im.2013.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5124">'''Healthy city''' is a term used in [[public health]] and [[urban design]] to stress the impact of policy on [[health|human health]]. Its modern form derives from a [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) initiative on Healthy Cities and Villages in 1986, but has a history dating back to the mid 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Niyi Awofeso. [http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?pid=S0042-96862003000300013&amp;script=sci_arttext  The Healthy Cities approach — reflections on a framework for improving global health.] ''Bull World Health Organ'' 2003; 81(3).&lt;/ref&gt; The term was developed in conjunction with the [[European Union]], but rapidly became international as a way of establishing healthy public policy at the local level through [[health promotion]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill M, Simard P. [http://heapro.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/2/145.full Choosing indicators to evaluate Healthy Cities projects: a political task?] ''Health Promotion International'' 2006; 21(2): 145-152.&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasises the multi-dimensionality of [[health]] as laid out in WHO's constitution and, more recently, the [[Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion]].&lt;ref name="whohc"&gt;World Health Organization.[http://www.euro.who.int/healthy-cities Healthy Cities and urban governance.] Copenhagen: WHO Europe.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative term is [[Healthy community design|Healthy Communities]], or ''Municipios saludables'' in parts of Latin America.

==Approaches==
Many jurisdictions which have healthy community programmes and cities can apply to become a WHO-designated "Healthy City". WHO defines the Healthy City as:&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/entity/healthpromotion/about/HPR%20Glossary%201998.pdf Health Promotion Glossary 1998.]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"one that is continually creating and improving those physical and social environments and expanding those community resources which enable
people to mutually support each other in performing all the functions of life and in developing to their maximum potential."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Measuring the indices required, establishing standards and determining the impact of each component on health is difficult. In some regions such as Europe, a health impact assessment is a required piece of [[public policy]] development.&lt;ref&gt;WHO Europe. [http://www.euro.who.int/healthimpact Health impact assessment methods and strategies.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erica Ison. [http://heapro.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/24/suppl_1/i64  The introduction of health impact assessment in the WHO European Healthy Cities Network.] ''Health Promotion International'' 2009; 24(Supplement 1):i64-i71.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many networks of healthy cities, including in Europe&lt;ref&gt;WHO Europe. [http://www.euro.who.int/en/what-we-do/health-topics/environment-and-health/urban-health/partners WHO European Healthy Cities Network.]&lt;/ref&gt; and internationally, such as the [[Alliance for Healthy Cities]]. A key feature is ensuring that the [[social determinants of health]] are taken into consideration in urban design and urban governance. For example, "[[urbanization]] and health" was the theme of the 2010 [[World Health Day]].&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization.[http://www.euro.who.int/worldhealthday/20100325_1 World Health Day 2010.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407222812/http://www.euro.who.int/worldhealthday/20100325_1 |date=2010-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One tool in developing healthy cities is [[social entrepreneurship]].&lt;ref&gt;Evelyne de Leeuw. [http://heapro.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/14/3/261  Healthy Cities: urban social entrepreneurship for health.] ''Health Promotion International'' 1999; 14(3): 261-270.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2699">In [[geometry]], any [[hyperplane]] ''H'' of a [[projective space]] ''P'' may be taken as a '''hyperplane at infinity'''. Then the [[set complement]] {{nowrap|''P'' ∖ ''H''}} is called an [[affine space]]. For instance, if {{nowrap|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} are [[homogeneous coordinates]] for ''n''-dimensional projective space, then the equation {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}} defines a hyperplane at infinity for the ''n''-dimensional affine space with coordinates {{nowrap|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. ''H'' is also called the '''ideal hyperplane'''.

Similarly, starting from an affine space ''A'', every class of [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] lines can be associated with a [[point at infinity]]. The [[union (set theory)|union]] over all classes of parallels constitute the points of the hyperplane at infinity. Adjoining the points of this hyperplane (called '''ideal points''') to ''A'' converts it into an ''n''-dimensional projective space, such as the real projective space {{nowrap|'''R'''P&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

By adding these ideal points, the entire affine space ''A'' is completed to a projective space ''P'', which may be called the '''projective completion''' of ''A''.  Each [[affine subspace]] ''S'' of ''A'' is completed to a [[projective space|projective subspace]] of ''P'' by adding to ''S'' all the ideal points corresponding to the directions of the lines contained in ''S''.  The resulting projective subspaces are often called ''affine subspaces'' of the projective space ''P'', as opposed to the '''infinite''' or '''ideal''' subspaces, which are the subspaces of the hyperplane at infinity (however, they are projective spaces, not affine spaces).

In the projective space, each projective subspace of dimension ''k'' intersects the ideal hyperplane in a projective subspace "at infinity" whose dimension is {{nowrap|''k'' − 1}}.

A pair of non-[[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] affine hyperplanes intersect at an affine subspace of dimension {{nowrap|''n'' − 2}}, but a parallel pair of affine hyperplanes intersect at a projective subspace of the ideal hyperplane (the intersection ''lies on'' the ideal hyperplane). Thus, parallel hyperplanes, which did not meet in the affine space, intersect in the projective completion due to the addition of the hyperplane at infinity.

The [[ion channel]] hypothesis of [[Alzheimer’s disease]] (AD), also known as the channel hypothesis or the [[amyloid beta]] ion channel hypothesis, is a more recent variant of the [[Alzheimer's disease#Amyloid hypothesis|amyloid hypothesis]] of AD, which identifies [[amyloid beta]] (Aβ) as the underlying cause of [[neurotoxicity]] seen in AD.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ekinci|first=Fatma J|last2=Linsley|first2=Maria-Dawn|last3=Shea|first3=Thomas B|date=2000-03-29|title=β-Amyloid-induced calcium influx induces apoptosis in culture by oxidative stress rather than tau phosphorylation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169328X00000255|journal=Molecular Brain Research|volume=76|issue=2|pages=389–395|doi=10.1016/S0169-328X(00)00025-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the traditional formulation of the amyloid hypothesis pinpoints insoluble, fibrillar aggregates of Aβ as the basis of disruption of [[calcium]] ion [[homeostasis]] and subsequent [[apoptosis]] in AD,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abramov|first=Andrey Y.|last2=Canevari|first2=Laura|last3=Duchen|first3=Michael R.|date=2004-12-06|title=Calcium signals induced by amyloid β peptide and their consequences in neurons and astrocytes in culture|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167488904002241|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Cell Research|series=8th European Symposium on Calcium|volume=1742|issue=1–3|pages=81–87|doi=10.1016/j.bbamcr.2004.09.006|pmid=15590058}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ion channel hypothesis in 1993 introduced the possibility of an ion-channel-forming [[oligomer]] of soluble, non-fibrillar Aβ as the [[Cytotoxicity|cytotoxic]] species allowing unregulated calcium influx into neurons in AD.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arispe|first=N|last2=Rojas|first2=E|last3=Pollard|first3=H B|date=1993-01-15|title=Alzheimer disease amyloid beta protein forms calcium channels in bilayer membranes: blockade by tromethamine and aluminum.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=90|issue=2|pages=567–571|issn=0027-8424|pmc=45704|pmid=8380642|doi=10.1073/pnas.90.2.567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ion channel hypothesis is broadly supported as an explanation for the calcium ion influx that disrupts calcium ion homeostasis and induces apoptosis in [[neurons]]. Because the extracellular deposition of Aβ fibrils in [[senile plaques]] is not sufficient to predict risk or onset of AD, and [[clinical trials]] of drugs that target the Aβ fibrillization process have largely failed, the ion channel hypothesis provides novel molecular targets for continued development of [[Alzheimer's disease research|AD therapies]] and for better understanding of the mechanism underlying onset and progression of AD.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jang|first=Hyunbum|last2=Connelly|first2=Laura|last3=Arce|first3=Fernando Teran|last4=Ramachandran|first4=Srinivasan|last5=Lal|first5=Ratnesh|last6=Kagan|first6=Bruce L.|last7=Nussinov|first7=Ruth|date=2013-05-22|title=Alzheimer's disease: which type of amyloid-preventing drug agents to employ?|url=http://doi.org/10.1039/c3cp00017f|journal=Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics|language=en|volume=15|issue=23|doi=10.1039/c3cp00017f|issn=1463-9084|pmc=3663909|pmid=23450150|pages=8868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ion channel hypothesis was first proposed by Arispe and colleagues in 1993 upon discovery that Aβ could form unregulated [[cation]]-selective ion channels when incorporated into planar [[lipid bilayer]]s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Further research showed that a particular fragment of Aβ, Aβ (25-35), spontaneously inserts into planar lipid bilayers to form weakly selective ion channels&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mirzabekov|first=T.|last2=Lin|first2=M.

== Mechanism of action ==

=== Channel formation ===
[[Cytotoxicity]] caused by ion channel formation is commonly seen in the world of bacteria.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Amyloid Peptide Channels|chapterurl=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-20149-8_14|title=Amyloid Peptide Channels|last=Azimov|first=Rustam|last2=Kagan|first2=Bruce L.|date=2015-01-01|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=9783319201481|editor-last=Delcour|editor-first=Anne H.|series=Springer Series in Biophysics|pages=343–360|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells are generally less vulnerable to channel-forming toxins because of their larger volume and stiffer, [[sterol]]-containing membranes, several eukaryotic channel-forming toxins have been seen to sidestep these obstacles by forming especially large, stable ion channels or anchoring to sterols in the cell membrane.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kagan|first=B.

=== Ionic leakage ===
The large, poorly selective, and long-lived nature of Aβ channels allows rapid degradation of membrane potential in neurons.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A single Aβ channel 4 nS in size can cause [[Sodium|Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] concentration to change as much as 10 μM/s.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Degradation of membrane potential in this manner also generates additional [[Calcium in biology|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] influx through voltage-sensitive [[Calcium in biology|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] channels in the plasma membrane.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Ionic leakage alone has been demonstrated to be sufficient to rapidly disrupt cellular homeostasis and induce cell [[necrosis]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Knapp|first=O.|last2=Benz|first2=R.|last3=Popoff|first3=M.

=== Mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis ===
Aβ channels may also trigger [[apoptosis]] through insertion in [[Mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] membranes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Aβ injection in rats has been shown to damage mitochondrial structure in neurons, decrease mitochondrial membrane potential, and increase intracellular [[Calcium in biology|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] concentration.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ren|first=Rui|last2=Zhang|first2=Yang|last3=Li|first3=Benchang|last4=Wu|first4=Yanping|last5=Li|first5=Baixiang|date=2011-05-01|title=Effect of β-amyloid (25–35) on mitochondrial function and expression of mitochondrial permeability transition pore proteins in rat hippocampal neurons|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcb.23062/abstract|journal=Journal of Cellular Biochemistry|language=en|volume=112|issue=5|pages=1450–1457|doi=10.1002/jcb.23062|issn=1097-4644}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Aβ accumulation increases expression of genes associated with the [[mitochondrial permeability transition pore]] (MPTP), a non-selective, high conductance channel spanning the inner and outer mitochondrial membrane.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Qu|first=Mingyue|last2=Zhou|first2=Zhou|last3=Chen|first3=Chunhai|last4=Li|first4=Min|last5=Pei|first5=Liping|last6=Yang|first6=Ju|last7=Wang|first7=Yuan|last8=Li|first8=Li|last9=Liu|first9=Chuan|date=2012-01-01|title=Inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening is involved in the protective effects of mortalin overexpression against beta-amyloid-induced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016801021102092X|journal=Neuroscience Research|volume=72|issue=1|pages=94–102|doi=10.1016/j.neures.2011.09.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Calcium in biology|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] influx into mitochondria can collapse mitochondrial membrane potential, causing MPTP opening, which then induces mitochondrial swelling, further dissipation of membrane potential, generation of mitochondrial [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS), rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane, and release of apoptogenic factors such as [[cytochrome c]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferreiro|first=Elisabete|last2=Oliveira|first2=Catarina R.|last3=Pereira|first3=Cláudia M.F.|title=The release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum induced by amyloid-beta and prion peptides activates the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0969996108000284|journal=Neurobiology of Disease|volume=30|issue=3|pages=331–342|doi=10.1016/j.nbd.2008.02.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=La Rovere|first=Rita M.L.|last2=Roest|first2=Gemma|last3=Bultynck|first3=Geert|last4=Parys|first4=Jan B.|title=Intracellular Ca2+ signaling and Ca2+ microdomains in the control of cell survival, apoptosis and autophagy|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0143416016300483|journal=Cell Calcium|doi=10.1016/j.ceca.2016.04.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only treatments currently approved for AD are either [[Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor|cholinesterase inhibitors]] (such as [[donepezil]]) or [[Glutamic acid|glutamate]] [[receptor antagonist]]s (such as [[memantine]]), which show limited efficacy in treating symptoms or halting progression of AD.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shirwany|first=Najeeb A|last2=Payette|first2=Daniel|last3=Xie|first3=Jun|last4=Guo|first4=Qing|date=2007-10-01|title=The amyloid beta ion channel hypothesis of Alzheimer’s disease|journal=Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment|volume=3|issue=5|pages=597–612|issn=1176-6328|pmc=2656296|pmid=19300589}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slight improvement in cognitive function brought about by these drugs is only seen in patients with mild to moderate AD, and is confined to the first year of treatment, as efficacy progressively declines, completely disappearing by 2 or 3 years of treatment. Extensive research has gone into the design of potential AD treatments to reduce Aβ production or aggregation, but these therapeutics have historically failed in Phase III clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karran|first=Eric|last2=Mercken|first2=Marc|last3=Strooper|first3=Bart De|date=2011-09-01|title=The amyloid cascade hypothesis for Alzheimer's disease: an appraisal for the development of therapeutics|url=http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v10/n9/full/nrd3505.html|journal=Nature Reviews Drug Discovery|language=en|volume=10|issue=9|pages=698–712|doi=10.1038/nrd3505|issn=1474-1776|pmid=21852788}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jang|first=Hyunbum|last2=Connelly|first2=Laura|last3=Arce|first3=Fernando Teran|last4=Ramachandran|first4=Srinivasan|last5=Lal|first5=Ratnesh|last6=Kagan|first6=Bruce L.|last7=Nussinov|first7=Ruth|date=2013-06-21|title=Alzheimer’s disease: Which type of amyloid-preventing drug agents to employ?|journal=Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics|volume=15|issue=23|pages=8868–8877|doi=10.1039/c3cp00017f|issn=1463-9076|pmc=3663909|pmid=23450150}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ion channel hypothesis of AD provides a novel avenue for development of AD therapies that may more directly target the underlying [[pathophysiology]] of AD.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Channel blockers ===
Nonspecific Aβ channel blockers including [[Tris|tromethamine]] (Tris) and [[Zinc|Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] have successfully inhibited Aβ [[cytotoxicity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arispe|first=Nelson|last2=Doh|first2=Michael|date=2002-10-01|title=Plasma membrane cholesterol controls the cytotoxicity of Alzheimer’s disease AβP (1–40) and (1–42) peptides|url=http://www.fasebj.org/content/16/12/1526|journal=The FASEB Journal|language=en|volume=16|issue=12|pages=1526–1536|doi=10.1096/fj.02-0829com|issn=0892-6638|pmid=12374775}}&lt;/ref&gt; Least-energy molecular models of the Aβ channel have been used to create polypeptide segments to target the mouth of the Aβ pore, and these selective Aβ channel blockers have also been shown to inhibit Aβ cytotoxicity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Structural modeling of Aβ channels, however, suggests that the channels are highly polymorphic, with the ability to move and change size and shape within the lipid membrane. The broad range of conformations adopted by the Aβ channel makes design of a specific, highly effective Aβ channel blocker difficult.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Membrane hyperpolarization ===
Indirect methods such as membrane [[Hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarization]] may help limit the cytotoxic [[Depolarization|depolarizing]] effects of Aβ channels.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[ATP-sensitive potassium channel|Potassium ATP channel]] activation has been demonstrated to attenuate Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx and reduce [[oxidative stress]] in neurons, as well as to improve memory and reduce Aβ and [[Tau protein|tau]] pathology in a [[Genetically modified mouse|transgenic]] AD mouse model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Dong|last2=Pitta|first2=Michael|last3=Lee|first3=Jong-Hwan|last4=Ray|first4=Balmiki|last5=Lahiri|first5=Debomoy|last6=Furukawa|first6=Katsutoshi|last7=Mughal|first7=Mohamed|last8=Jiang|first8=Haiyang|last9=Villarreal|first9=Julissa|date=2010-01-01|title=The KATP Channel Activator Diazoxide Ameliorates Aβ and Tau Pathologies and Improves Memory in the 3xTgAD Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease|journal=Journal of Alzheimer's Disease|volume=22|issue=2|pages=443–457|doi=10.3233/JAD-2010-101017|issn=1387-2877|pmc=2988870|pmid=20847430}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, drugs that block [[Voltage-gated ion channel|voltage-gated]] Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels have also been shown to protect neurons from Aβ toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anekonda|first=Thimmappa S.|last2=Quinn|first2=Joseph F.|last3=Harris|first3=Christopher|last4=Frahler|first4=Kate|last5=Wadsworth|first5=Teri L.|last6=Woltjer|first6=Randall L.|date=2011-01-01|title=L-type voltage-gated calcium channel blockade with isradipine as a therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease|journal=Neurobiology of Disease|volume=41|issue=1|pages=62–70|doi=10.1016/j.nbd.2010.08.020|issn=1095-953X|pmc=2982927|pmid=20816785}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other amyloid channels ==
Several other classes of [[amyloid]] proteins also form ion channels, including proteins implicated in [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type II diabetes mellitus]], [[prion]] diseases, [[Parkinson's disease]], and [[Huntington's disease]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Consistent with Aβ channels, other amyloid channels have also been reported to be large, non-selective, voltage-independent, heterogeneous, and irreversible.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These distinct properties set amyloid channels apart from other ion channels in neurons and facilitate unregulated ionic leakage resulting in cell depolarization, disruption of ion homeostasis, and cell death.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Further investigation of amyloid proteins and the cytotoxic effects of amyloid channel formation is necessary for development of drug candidates that are able to selectively block amyloid channels or bind them prior to membrane insertion, an area of research that may prove highly relevant to not just AD but a wide variety of other diseases.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

[[File:Love padlocks at Butchers' Bridge (Ljubljana).JPG|thumb|Love padlocks by night on Butchers' Bridge in [[Ljubljana]], Slovenia.]]
[[File:Love without locks campaign, Passerelle Debilly, Paris 1 November 2016.jpg|thumb|Love without locks campaign, Passerelle Debilly, Paris]]
A '''love lock''' or  '''love padlock''' is a [[padlock]] which [[Significant other|sweethearts]] lock to a [[bridge]], [[fence]], [[gate]], [[monument]], or similar public fixture to symbolize their love.&lt;ref name='bbc-rome'&gt;{{cite news | first = Dana | last = Enulescu | title = Rome mayor in 'love padlock' row | date = 1 March 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6408635.stm | work = [[BBC]] | accessdate = 19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically the sweethearts' names or initials, and perhaps the date, are inscribed on the padlock, and its key is thrown away (often into the nearby river) to symbolize unbreakable love.

Since the 2000s, love locks have proliferated at an increasing number of locations worldwide. They are now mostly treated by municipal authorities as litter or [[vandalism]], and there is some cost to their removal. However, there are authorities who embrace them, and who use them as fundraising projects or tourist attractions.

== History ==
[[File:Karlův most, removing love padlocks.jpg|thumb|Removing love locks at [[Charles Bridge]] in [[Prague]]]]
The history of love padlocks dates back at least 100 years to a melancholic Serbian tale of [[World War I]], with an attribution for the bridge [[Most Ljubavi]] (lit. the ''Bridge of Love'') in the [[Spa towns in Serbia|spa town]] of [[Vrnjačka Banja]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rubin|first=Alissa|title=On Bridges in Paris, Clanking With Love|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/28/world/europe/on-bridges-in-paris-clanking-with-love.html?_r=0|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local schoolmistress named ''Nada'', who was from Vrnjačka Banja, fell in love with a Serbian officer named ''Relja''. After they committed to each other Relja went to war in [[Greece]] where he fell in love with a local woman from [[Corfu]]. As a consequence, Relja and Nada broke off their engagement. Nada never recovered from that devastating blow, and after some time she died due to heartbreak from her unfortunate love.{{citation needed|date=September 2018|reason=For All since the last citation}}

As young women from [[Vrnjačka Banja]] wanted to protect their own loves, they started writing down their names, with the names of their loved ones, on [[padlock]]s and affixing them to the railings of the bridge where Nada and Relja used to meet.&lt;ref name="vrnjackabanja.biz"&gt;{{cite web|title=Most ljubavi |url=http://www.vrnjackabanja.biz/mostljubavi.php|website=Vrnjackabanja.biz|accessdate=6 October 2010|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ogrizović|first=Slobodan|title=Vrnjačka banja, najveće lečilište u Srbiji|url=http://www.b92.net/putovanja/destinacije/evropa.php?yyyy=2009&amp;mm=04&amp;dd=22&amp;nav_category=823&amp;nav_id=356735|accessdate=6 October 2010|newspaper=B92|date=22 April 2009|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the rest of Europe, love padlocks started appearing in the early 2000s as a [[ritual]] or [[epidemy]].&lt;ref name='ind-paris'&gt;{{cite news | first = Louisa | last = Long | title = Love-locks return to the bridges of Paris | date = 6 June 2011 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/lovelocks-return-to-the-bridges-of-paris-2293506.html | work = [[The Independent]] | accessdate = 19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons love padlocks started to appear vary between locations and in many instances are unclear. However, in [[Rome]], the ritual of affixing love padlocks to the bridge [[Ponte Milvio]] can be attributed to the 2006 book [[:it:Ho voglia di te (romanzo)|''I Want You'']] by Italian author [[Federico Moccia]], who made a [[film]] adaptation in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Ian Fischer |date=6 August 2007|title=In Rome, a New Ritual on an Old Bridge|journal=[[The New York Times|New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/06/world/europe/06rome.html|accessdate=9 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='ponte'&gt;{{cite news | first = Justin | last = Demetri | title = The Bridge of Love in Rome | year = 2008 | url = http://www.lifeinitaly.com/tourism/lazio/milvian-bridge.asp | website=Lifeinitaly.com | accessdate = 19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How to Get Your Ex-Girlfriend Back Advice|url=https://myrelationshipscenter.com/get-your-ex-girlfriend-back/|website=Myrelationshipscenter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable locations and controversies ==
[[File:Moscow-love-padlocks.jpg|thumb|right|One of many purpose-built iron trees on a bridge across the [[Vodootvodny Canal]] in Moscow completely covered in love padlocks.]]
In many cities, love locking has been classified an act of [[vandalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite |url=http://theconversation.com/the-lock-of-love-how-leaving-padlocks-became-a-modern-day-romantic-ritual-72140 |title=Forbidden love|website=Theconversation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In several countries, the local authorities and owners of various landmarks have expressed concern often have the padlocks removed:
[[File:Telemly avant apres.png|thumb|Love padlocks in Algiers have been removed by youths]]
* In [[Algiers]] love padlocks were added in September 2013 to a bridge that was previously known as the "[[suicide bridge]]" in Telemly, a district of Algiers. Some youths brought tools to remove them by night a few days later,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.algerie-focus.com/blog/2013/09/alger-le-pont-damour-redevient-le-pont-des-suicides/ Alger : le pont "d’amour" redevient le pont des "suicidés"] Algérie focus.2013-09-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Missous|first1=Naila|title=Algeria's controversial bridge of love|url=http://www.yourmiddleeast.com/features/algerias-controversial-bridge-of-love_18186|accessdate=14 July 2014|publisher=Your Middle East|date=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; after a video was made by an imam saying that love padlocks are forbidden in Islam.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}
[[File:Love-locks in Suseong Lake, Daegu.jpg|thumb|Love locks in Suseong Lake, Daegu, South Korea]]
* Authorities in [[Canberra]], Australia, decided in February 2015 to remove love locks from a bridge that was becoming a popular location to affix them, and from other locations in Canberra. Justifications given for the decision were the possibility of future threats to public safety from eventual overloading of the bridge with a mass of padlocks, and structural interference resulting from corrosion. A bridge in Paris was mentioned by authorities as an example of an overloaded bridge, a probable reference to the [[Pont des Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Love locks to be removed from National Carillon footbridge in Canberra|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-02-02/love-locks-to-be-removed-from-carillion-footbridge-in-canberra/6064200|accessdate=2 February 2015|work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation News]]|date=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 May 2015, council authorities in [[Melbourne]], Australia, began removing love locks from Southgate footbridge due to safety concerns. Around 22,000 love locks were reported to have been fixed to the railings, causing cables to sag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Melbourne love locks: Council cuts padlocks off Southgate footbridge to save structure|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-20/melbourne-city-council-cuts-love-locks-off-southgate-footbridge/6483880|accessdate=20 May 2015|work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation News]]|date=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Toowoomba]], Australia, love locks have been appearing at [[Picnic Point, Toowoomba|Picnic Point]], a heritage-listed tourist attraction featuring a park and lookout at the top of the [[Great Dividing Range]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Romantics secure their love locks|url=http://www.thechronicle.com.au/news/romantics-secure-their-love-locks/2071254/|accessdate=14 November 2014|newspaper=[[Toowoomba Chronicle]]|date=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, love padlocks appearing along the [[Wild Pacific Trail]] in [[Ucluelet]] on [[Vancouver Island]], have caused controversy as some{{who|date=October 2017}} regard them as a distraction from nature. Love padlocks were removed from the [[Humber Bay Arch Bridge]] in Toronto, due to concerns over aesthetics and structural concerns if the Bridge were to become a love padlock destination.&lt;ref name='can'&gt;{{cite news | first = Yasmin | last = Aboelsaud | title = Accidental locks of love on Wild Pacific Trail | date = 6 January 2011 | url = http://www2.canada.com/westerly/news/story.html?id=dfbfc1bc-6501-4258-9854-ad2afe035e68 | work = Westerly News | accessdate = 19 August 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120905142909/http://www2.canada.com/westerly/news/story.html?id=dfbfc1bc-6501-4258-9854-ad2afe035e68 | archivedate = 5 September 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Love Padlocks on the Corktown Footbridge in Ottawa, August 14th, 2017.jpg|thumb|Love padlocks attached to the railing of Corktown Footbridge]] 
* In the [[United States]], in [[De Pere, Wisconsin|De Pere]], Wisconsin, at Voyageur Park, locks are being attached to a lookout called Sunset Point. In [[Canfield, Ohio]], the BIG LOCK was installed in 2014 as a community art project at the Canfield Fairgrounds. Visitors are encouraged to add a personalized lock to the 12' x 12' steel-cage rooster.  The Canfield Fair is one of the largest county fairs in the country, and the rooster its official symbol. The name BIG LOCK is a play on words, referencing the Big Rock, which is also a highly referenced symbol of the Fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hall|first1=Kalea|title=BIG LOCK encourages Canfield fairgoers to share fair love|url=http://www.vindy.com/news/2014/aug/27/big-lock-offers-chance-to-share-love-for|website=Vindy.com|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New York City a group of [[locksport]] enthusiasts organized to remove locks from the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2013/10/picking-the-bridge.html|title=Picking the Bridge|author=Geoff Manaugh|date=11 October 2013|newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Las Vegas]], a 1/2 scale model of the [[Eiffel Tower]] located at the [[Paris Hotel]] on the famed [[Las Vegas Strip]] has inspired visitors to place lovers' locks on the walkway out to the elevators to the top of the tower. Visitors are told not to throw the key from the tower and locks sold in the lobby are opened and provided for a fee without a key to prevent this practice. People are actually encouraged to leave their locks on chains strung between posts at Lover's Lock Plaza in [[Lovelock, Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loverslock.com|title=Lovelock Nevada|website=Loverslock.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the town is unrelated to the love locks, it was named after a family that settled in the area in the 1860s. The town didn't adopt the practice until much later. In San Angelo, TX, the city has erected a sculpture "Forever Love" inspired by other "love locks" such as (formerly) the bridge in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sanangelolive.com/news/entertainment/2015-10-24/exploring-san-angelo%E2%80%99s-haunted-bridge|title=Exploring San Angelo’s Haunted Bridge|date=24 October 2015|website=Sanangleolive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gosanangelo.com/news/lone-wolf-bridge-home-to-new-public-art-work-ep-305688106-355143201.html|title=Lone Wolf Bridge home to new public art work|website=Gosanangelo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Discovery Bay, California|Discovery Bay]], a small town in Northern California, a lover's bridge was created by newlyweds Carolyn and Anthony George in 2011.  The couple was married on 11-11-11, and after seeing the movie "[[Now You See Me (film)|Now you see me]]" got the idea to create a location for lovers to be "locked in love", by putting a love lock on the bridge and throwing the keys into the California Delta waterways that surround Discovery Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thepress.net/news/romance-is-a-lock-in-discovery-bay/article_8e395e9a-3abf-11e4-8dc9-001a4bcf6878.html|title=Romance is a lock in Discovery Bay|last=Schrader|first=Amy|website=Thepress.net|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lovelocks on pont des Arts, Paris.jpg|thumb|Love padlocks on [[Pont des Arts]], Paris]]
* In France, in May 2010 the city of Paris expressed concern over the growing number of love-locks on the [[Pont des Arts]], [[Passerelle Léopold-Sédar-Senghor]], and the [[Pont de l'Archevêché]] bridges, stating: "they raise problems for the preservation of our architectural heritage". The lovelocks of the Pont des Arts disappeared during the night of 11 May 2010; they had been removed by a student of the nearby [[École des Beaux-Arts]] to make a sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kumo09.blogspot.ca/2010/07/500-ou-sont-passes-les-cadenas-du-pont.html « Où sont passés les cadenas du pont des Arts »], [[Les Nuages Bleus]], 20 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Love locks immediately began appearing on the [[Pont de l'Archevêché]]&lt;ref name='ind-paris' /&gt; and have since spread to at least 11 Seine bridges, the Canal Saint Martin footbridges, and to parks and monuments all over the city. Many tourists mistakenly believe this is a longstanding Parisian tradition, not realizing the practice only migrated into Paris in late 2008 after affecting cities in Italy and Asia. In January 2014, a campaign and petition, No Love Locks™,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nolovelocks.com|title=NO LOVE LOCKS™|website=Nolovelocks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded by two Americans living in Paris in an effort to save the city's historic bridges and monuments from the overwhelming number of locks. The international media attention the campaign received has been credited with the actions begun in the summer and fall of 2014, when the city began seeking alternatives to love locks and asking the public to stop placing locks on Parisian bridges and monuments. On 9 May 2014, the weight of the padlocks on the Pont Des Arts bridge was blamed for the collapse of part of the [[parapet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Urquhart|first1=Wendy|title='Lovelocks' collapse Paris bridge rail|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27758940|accessdate=14 July 2014|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city began an experiment in September 2014 on the Pont des Arts, replacing three panels with a special type of glass that would prevent locks from being attached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/world/europe/paris-falls-out-of-love-with-the-padlocks-on-its-bridges.html|title=Paris Falls Out of Love With the Padlocks on Its Bridges|date=21 September 2014|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 June 2015, the locks were taken down due to the collapsing of the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Paris Bridge's Love Locks Are Taken Down|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/world/europe/paris-bridges-locks-of-love-taken-down.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 1 June 2015|access-date = 1 June 2015|issn = 0362-4331|first = Alissa J.|last = Rubin|first2 = Aurelien|last2 = Breeden}}&lt;/ref&gt; A website called Passion Locks exists, a tribute to [[Pont des Arts]], where users can send others a virtual love lock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Tarczynski|title=Passion Locks|url=http://www.passionlocks.com|website=Passionlocks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Bamberg]], [[Germany]], after inviting the public to attach love locks on the [[Chain Bridge (Bamberg)|Kettenbrücke]] in 2011, officials threatened to remove them during the same year due to rust. After public outrage and several township meetings, the locks remain. In [[Berlin]], applying a lock to a bridge is a misdemeanor and can generate cautionary fines up to 35 euros. Historical bridges are especially affected, as it disturbs the visual impression, and can even cause an electrolytic corrosion of noble brass of the locks against the baser iron bridges, leading to rust damage. Rust damage was noted in [[Lübeck]] at the [[Obertrave]] bridge. In addition, damage in removing the locks is seen by municipalities as a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/weltspiegel/auf-ewige-liebe/4893848.html|title=Auf ewige Liebe – Welt – Tagesspiegel|website=Tagesspiegel.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deutsche Bahn]], the bridge's operator, threatened to have the locks removed from the [[Hohenzollern Bridge]] in [[Cologne]], but in the end relented in the face of public opposition.&lt;ref name='dw'&gt;{{cite news | first = Sarah | last = Stolarz | title = Cologne Gets a Lock on Love | date = 2 September 2009 | url = http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4008316,00.html | work = Deutsche Welle | accessdate = 19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelocks are now embraced on the bridge, and visitors are directed to them on the city tourism site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cologne.de/what-to-do/sightseeing/love-locks.html|title=Love locks|website=Cologne.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hamburg]] this [[ritual]] was also spread among [[bridge]]s and [[lighthouse]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hamburg-travel.com/attractions/culture-in-hamburg/culture-from-a-to-z/schwanenwikbruecke/|title=Schwanenwikbrücke|website=Hamburg-travel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Florence]], Italy, 5,500 love padlocks affixed to the [[Ponte Vecchio]] bridge were removed by the city council. According to the council the padlocks both pose an aesthetic problem in addition to scratching and denting the metal of the bridge.&lt;ref name='flor'&gt;{{cite news | title = Florence tries to stamp out locks of love | date = 1 May 2006 | url = http://www.italymag.co.uk/italy/tuscany/florence-tries-stamp-out-locks-love | work = Italy Mag | accessdate = 19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Venice]] is among cities where affixing padlocks to bridges is strictly prohibited.

* In [[Dublin]], Ireland, padlocks on the [[Ha'penny Bridge]] over the [[River Liffey]] were removed by the Dublin City Council in early 2012. The padlocks could damage the protected structure, the Council has said. "This seems to have only started happening in the last few months and we're asking people not to do it," said a spokesperson for Dublin City Council. Some locks have also been removed from the [[Millennium Bridge (Dublin)|Millennium Bridge]], close to the [[Ha'penny Bridge]] in the city centre, the Council said. The padlocks have been criticised for being an eyesore on public structures. They can also cause further damage when they have to be removed, the Council said. The spokesperson confirmed that the Council will continue to remove the locks from any bridges they appear on in the city centre.&lt;ref name='dub'&gt;{{cite news | title = Where's the love?

* In Scotland, a "Mark your Spot" campaign was launched by the Edinburgh City Council on the [[Forth Road Bridge]]. 4 sets of panels on the bridge itself were dedicated to Lovelocks, with both locals and tourists buying and affixing locks to them. This was a charity initiative that raised £10,300 for the Queensferry [[RNLI]], a local lifeboat service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/forth-road-bridge-lovelocks-raise-10-000-1-3740145|title=Forth Road Bridge lovelocks raise £10,000|website=Scotsman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in Scotland, Lovelocks can also be found at the Courtship Maze at Gretna Green. Couples are welcome to affix padlocks to the bridge there.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} To celebrate their meeting in Japan, Jonathan Montagu and [[Nathalie Daoust]] commissioned artist Clare Grotefeld to design and create a giant [[bonsai]] love lock tree for their wedding on 4 October 2014. The tree is located at [[Beaulieu Palace House]], UK, where couples are invited to help the tree flourish by adding their own love locks. The 125-year-old delicate cast-iron Listed [[Ferry Bridge, Burton|Ferry Bridge, Burton-on-Trent]] was refurbished (2015-2016) at considerable expense. Within days a love lock was affixed to the bridge, but it was quickly removed, as such items are unsightly, a hazard, add to the load on the structure, and are not allowed under the Listing Regulations.  Any that do get affixed are removed at once.

* In [[Recife]], [[Brazil]], a love lock project initiated by ''Diego Lima'' was present at a [[fence]] on the Aurora Street; however, after it was stolen and sold for scrap metal a second time he decided not to give the installment a third chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite |url=http://www.brasileiros-mundo-afora.com/2013/07/cadeados-do-amor-mundo-afora.html |title=Brazilians abroad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legends and superstitions ==
On some locations the padlocks have been given almost legendary or superstitious character:
* In [[Fengyuan]], Taiwan, love padlocks affixed to an overpass at [[Fengyuan railway station|the city's train station]] are often affixed in pairs. These locks are known as "wish locks" and local legend holds that the magnetic field generated by trains passing underneath will cause energy to accumulate in the locks and fulfill the wishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |authorlink= |author=Chang Jui-chen |year=2009 |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2009/06/08/2003445646 |title='Wish lock' phenomenon attracts youth to Fengyuan |newspaper=[[Taipei Times]] |accessdate=6 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On a fountain in [[Montevideo]] in Uruguay, a plaque is affixed to the front of the fountain that provides an explanation in both English and Spanish. The English version of the text reads, "''The legend of this young fountain tells us that if a lock with the initials of two people in love is placed in it, they will return together to the fountain and their love will be forever locked.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inspiringtravellers.com/montevideos-locks-fountain/|title=Montevideo's Locks Fountain|website=Inspiringtravellers.com|accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neurofeedback''' ('''NFB'''), also called '''neurotherapy''' or '''neurobiofeedback''', is a type of [[biofeedback]] that uses real-time displays of brain activity—most commonly [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), to teach self-regulation of brain function. Typically, sensors are placed on the scalp to measure activity, with measurements displayed using video displays or sound.

==Definition==

Neurofeedback is a type of [[biofeedback]] that measures brain waves to produce a signal that can be used as feedback to teach self-regulation of brain function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Napoletano|first1=Margo | name-list-format = vanc |title=Neurofeedback: Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.childandfamilycenter.com/services-specialized-neurofeedback.htm|website=Child and Family Counseling Center|access-date=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurofeedback is commonly provided using video or sound, with positive feedback for desired brain activity and negative feedback for brain activity that is undesirable.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} Related technologies include [[hemoencephalography]] biofeedback (HEG) and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) biofeedback.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

===ADHD===
Clinical guidelines on neurofeedback as a treatment for ADHD are mixed. Biofeedback is graded by the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] with their Level 2 evidence-based treatment for ADHD.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.braintrainuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/How-AAP-reached-conclusion-other-recent-evidence-July-2013-V3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=June 2016}} The [[NICE]] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK53652/ guideline for ADHD] leaves the efficacy of biofeedback an open question (p.&amp;nbsp;412). In page 202 states "Biofeedback has been employed as a non-invasive treatment for children with ADHD since the 1970s but is probably not used as a significant intervention in UK clinical practice".  However this is unsurprising since in the UK, NICE evaluates whether treatments should  be recommended on the basis of the cost of a [[quality-adjusted life year]]. [http://www.sign.ac.uk/guidelines/fulltext/112/index.html SIGN guideline no 112] in page 24 mentions "Neurofeedback is presently considered to be an experimental intervention in children and young people with ADHD/HKD. There are no standardised interventions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network|title=Management of attention deficit and hyperkinetic disorders in children and young people: A national clinical guideline|year=2009|publisher=NHS Quality Improvement Scotland|pages=24|url=http://www.sign.ac.uk/guidelines/fulltext/112/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement [https://www.icsi.org/guidelines__more/catalog_guidelines_and_more/catalog_guidelines/catalog_behavioral_health_guidelines/adhd/ guideline on Diagnosis and Management of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Primary Care for School-Age Children and Adolescents] in page 41 mentions neurofeedback lacks enough research evidence for efficacy in ADHD.&lt;ref name=ICSI&gt;{{cite book|title=Diagnosis and Management of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Primary Care for School-Age Children and Adolescents|year=2012|publisher=Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement|page=41|url=https://www.icsi.org/guidelines__more/catalog_guidelines_and_more/catalog_guidelines/catalog_behavioral_health_guidelines/adhd/|author=Dobie C, |author2=Donald WB |author3=Hanson M |author4=Heim C |author5=Huxsahl J |author6=Karasov R |author7=Kippes C |author8=Neumann A |author9=Spinner P |author10=Staples T |author11=Steiner L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall research into neurofeedback is considered to have been limited and of low quality,&lt;ref name=ICSI/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22930416"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid25220087/&gt; although others have disagreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arns M, de Ridder S, Strehl U, Breteler M, Coenen A | title = Efficacy of neurofeedback treatment in ADHD: the effects on inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity: a meta-analysis | journal = Clinical EEG and Neuroscience | volume = 40 | issue = 3 | pages = 180–9 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19715181 | doi = 10.1177/155005940904000311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued there is some indication on the effectiveness of biofeedback for [[ADHD]] but that it is not conclusive: several studies have yielded positive results, however the best designed ones have either shown absent or reduced effects.&lt;ref name=ICSI/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22930416"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid25220087&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Holtmann M, Sonuga-Barke E, Cortese S, Brandeis D | title = Neurofeedback for ADHD: a review of current evidence | journal = Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 789–806 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25220087 | doi = 10.1016/j.chc.2014.05.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22890816"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lofthouse N, Arnold LE, Hurt E | title = Current status of neurofeedback for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder | journal = Current Psychiatry Reports | volume = 14 | issue = 5 | pages = 536–42 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22890816 | doi = 10.1007/s11920-012-0301-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other experts have proposed that standard neurofeedback protocols for ADHD, such as theta/beta, SMR and slow cortical potentials neurofeedback are well investigated and have demonstrated specificity.&lt;ref name="arns2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arns M, Heinrich H, Strehl U | title = Evaluation of neurofeedback in ADHD: the long and winding road | journal = Biological Psychology | volume = 95 | pages = 108–15 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24321363 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2013.11.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No serious adverse side effects from neurofeedback have been reported.&lt;ref name="pmid22930416"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moriyama TS, Polanczyk G, Caye A, Banaschewski T, Brandeis D, Rohde LA | title = Evidence-based information on the clinical use of neurofeedback for ADHD | journal = Neurotherapeutics | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 588–98 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22930416 | pmc = 3441929 | doi = 10.1007/s13311-012-0136-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

QEEG has been used to develop EEG models of ADHD. According to this model, persons with ADHD often have too many slow theta brain waves (associated with relaxation) and not enough fast beta wave activity (associated with mental focus).&lt;ref name = "Butnik"&gt;Butnik, Steven M.

===Non-medical===
The applications of neurofeedback to enhance performance extend to the arts in fields such as music, dance, and acting. A study with conservatoire musicians found that [[alpha wave|alpha-theta]] training benefitted the three music domains of [[musicality]], communication, and technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Egner T, Gruzelier JH | title = Ecological validity of neurofeedback: modulation of slow wave EEG enhances musical performance | journal = Neuroreport | volume = 14 | issue = 9 | pages = 1221–4 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12824763 | doi = 10.1097/00001756-200307010-00006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historically, alpha-theta training, a form of neurofeedback, was created to assist creativity by inducing [[hypnagogia]], a “borderline waking state associated with creative insights”, through facilitation of neural connectivity.&lt;ref name=Gruzelier&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gruzelier|first=John | name-list-format = vanc |title=Neurofeedback and the performing arts|journal=Neuroscience Letters|date=1 July 2011|volume=500|pages=e15|doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2011.05.106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alpha-theta training has also been shown to improve novice singing in children. Alpha-theta neurofeedback, in conjunction with [[heart rate variability|heart rate variability training]], a form of [[biofeedback]], has also produced benefits in dance by enhancing performance in competitive ballroom dancing and increasing cognitive creativity in contemporary dancers. Additionally, neurofeedback has also been shown to instil a superior [[flow (psychology)|flow state]] in actors, possibly due to greater immersion while performing.&lt;ref name=Gruzelier/&gt;

However, randomized control trials have found that neurofeedback training (using either sensorimotor rhythm or theta/beta ratio training) did not enhance performance on attention-related tasks or creative tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Doppelmayr M, Weber E |title=Effects of SMR and Theta/Beta Neurofeedback on Reaction Times, Spatial Abilities, and Creativity|journal=Journal of Neurotherapy|date=20 May 2011|volume=15|issue=2|pages=115–129|doi=10.1080/10874208.2011.570689 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that claims made by proponents of alpha wave neurofeedback training techniques have yet to be validated by randomized, double-blind, controlled studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Beyerstein |first=Barry L | name-list-format = vanc |title=Brainscams: Neuromythologies of the New Age|journal=International Journal of Mental Health|date=1990|volume=19|issue=3|pages=27–36 |doi=10.1080/00207411.1990.11449169}}&lt;/ref&gt; a view which even some supporters of alpha neurofeedback training have also expressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Vernon D, Dempster T, Bazanova O, Rutterford N, Pasqualini M, Andersen S |title=Alpha Neurofeedback Training for Performance Enhancement: Reviewing the Methodology|journal=Journal of Neurotherapy|date=30 Nov 2009|volume=13|issue=4|pages=214–227|doi=10.1080/10874200903334397 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and application ==

In 1924, the German psychiatrist [[Hans Berger]] connected a couple of electrodes (small round discs of metal) to a patient's scalp and detected a small current by using a ballistic [[galvanometer]].  During the years 1929-1938 he published 14 reports about his studies of EEGs, and much of our modern knowledge of the subject, especially in the middle frequencies, is due to his research.&lt;ref name="Kaiser"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kaiser David A |year=2005 |title=Basic Principles of Quantitative EEG | journal=Journal of Adult Development |volume=12 |issue=2/3 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berger analyzed EEGs qualitatively, but in 1932&amp;nbsp;G. Dietsch applied [[Fourier analysis]] to seven records of EEG and became the first researcher of what later is called QEEG (quantitative EEG).&lt;ref name="Kaiser" /&gt;

Later, [[Joe Kamiya]] popularized neurofeedback in the 1960s when an article&lt;ref name="Kamiya1971"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kamiya J | year = 1971 | title = Operant Control of the EEG Alpha Rhythm and Some of its Reported Effects on Consciousness | journal = Biofeedback and Self-Control: an Aldine Reader on the Regulation of Bodily Processes and Consciousness }}&lt;/ref&gt; about the alpha brain wave experiments he had been conducting was published in ''Psychology Today'' in 1968. Kamiya’s experiment had two parts. In the first part, a subject was asked to keep his eyes closed and when a tone sounded to say whether he thought he was in [[alpha rhythm|alpha]]. He was then told whether he was correct or wrong. Initially the subject would get about fifty percent correct, but some subjects would eventually develop the ability to better distinguish between states.&lt;ref name="Frederick2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Frederick JA | title = Psychophysics of EEG alpha state discrimination | journal = Consciousness and Cognition | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 1345–54 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22800733 | doi = 10.1016/j.concog.2012.06.009 | url = http://www.brainm.com/documents/Publications/Frederick.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second part of the study, subjects were asked to go into alpha when a bell rang once and not go into the state when the bell rang twice.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} Once again some subjects were able to enter the state on command. Alpha states were connected with relaxation, and alpha training had the possibility to alleviate stress and stress-related conditions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Despite these claims, the universal correlation of high alpha density to a subjective experience of calm cannot be assumed.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} Alpha states do not seem to have the universal stress-alleviating power indicated by early observations.&lt;ref name="Hardt1978"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hardt JV, Kamiya J | title = Anxiety change through electroencephalographic alpha feedback seen only in high anxiety subjects | journal = Science | volume = 201 | issue = 4350 | pages = 79–81 | date = July 1978 | pmid = 663641 | doi = 10.1126/science.663641 | bibcode = 1978Sci...201...79H }}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, [[Martin Theodore Orne|Martin Orne]] and others challenged the claim that alpha biofeedback actually involved the training of an individual to voluntarily regulate brainwave activity.&lt;ref name="Paskewitz1973"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Paskewitz DA, Orne MT | title = Visual effects on alpha feedback training | journal = Science | volume = 181 | issue = 4097 | pages = 360–3 | date = July 1973 | pmid = 4719909 | doi = 10.1126/science.181.4097.360 | bibcode = 1973Sci...181..360P }}&lt;/ref&gt; James Hardt and Joe Kamiya, then at [[University of California, San Francisco|UC San Francisco]]'s [[Langley Porter Psychiatric Institute|Langley Porter Neuropsychiatric Institute]] published a paper that supported biofeedback.&lt;ref name="Hardt1976"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hardt JV, Kamiya J | title = Conflicting results in EEG alpha feedback studies: why amplitude integration should replace percent time | journal = Biofeedback and Self-Regulation | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–75 | date = March 1976 | pmid = 990344 | doi = 10.1007/bf00998691 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late sixties and early seventies, [[Barbara Brown (scientist)|Barbara Brown]], one of the most effective popularizers of Biofeedback, wrote several books on biofeedback, making the public much more aware of the technology.  The books included ''New Mind New Body'', with a foreword from [[Hugh Downs]], and ''Stress and the Art of Biofeedback''. Brown took a creative approach to neurofeedback, linking brainwave self-regulation to a switching relay which turned on an electric train.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Forghan|first1=Bahamin| name-list-format = vanc |title=Investigation brain Neuro biofeedback |url= https://www.academia.edu/660583/Investigation_brain_Neuro_biofeedback |website=Academia|access-date=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of Barry Sterman, Joel F. Lubar and others has been relevant on the study of beta training, involving the role of sensorimotor rhythmic EEG activity.&lt;ref name="Sterman1962"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sterman MB, Clemente CD | title = Forebrain inhibitory mechanisms: cortical synchronization induced by basal forebrain stimulation | journal = Experimental Neurology | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 91–102 | date = August 1962 | pmid = 13916975 | doi = 10.1016/0014-4886(62)90080-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This training has been used in the treatment of epilepsy,&lt;ref name="Sterman1972"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sterman MB, Friar L | title = Suppression of seizures in an epileptic following sensorimotor EEG feedback training | journal = Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 89–95 | date = July 1972 | pmid = 4113278 | doi = 10.1016/0013-4694(72)90028-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sterman2000"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sterman MB | title = Basic concepts and clinical findings in the treatment of seizure disorders with EEG operant conditioning | journal = Clinical EEG | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 45–55 | date = January 2000 | pmid = 10638352 | doi = 10.1177/155005940003100111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; attention deficit disorder and hyperactive disorder.&lt;ref name="Lubar1995"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lubar JF, Swartwood MO, Swartwood JN, O'Donnell PH | year = 1995 | title = Evaluation of the effectiveness of EEG neurofeedback training for ADHD in a clinical setting as measured by changes in TOVA scores, behavioral ratings, and WISC-R performance | journal = Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 83–99 | doi = 10.1007/bf01712768 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) is rhythmic activity between 12 and 16 hertz that can be recorded from an area near the sensorimotor cortex. SMR is found in waking states and is very similar if not identical to the sleep spindles that are recorded in the second stage of sleep.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

For example, Sterman has shown that both monkeys and cats who had undergone SMR training had elevated thresholds for the convulsant chemical monomethylhydrazine. These studies indicate that SMR may be associated with an inhibitory process in the motor system.&lt;ref name=Sterman2000 /&gt;

Within the last 5–10 years, neurofeedback has taken a new approach in taking a look at deep states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hammond |first1=D. Corydon | name-list-format = vanc |title=Neurotherapy also called Neurofeedback or EEG Biofeedback |url=http://www.appliedneuroscience.org.au/neurotherapy |website=Applied Neuroscience Society of Australasia |publisher=Applied Neuroscience Society of Australasia |access-date=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alpha-theta training has been tried with patients with alcoholism,&lt;ref name="SokhadzeEtal2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sokhadze TM, Cannon RL, Trudeau DL | title = EEG biofeedback as a treatment for substance use disorders: review, rating of efficacy, and recommendations for further research | journal = Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–28 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18214670 | pmc = 2259255 | doi = 10.1007/s10484-007-9047-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; other addictions as well as [[anxiety]].&lt;ref name="SokhadzeEtal2008" /&gt; This low frequency training differs greatly from the high frequency beta and SMR training that has been practiced for over thirty years and is reminiscent of the original alpha training of Elmer Green and Joe Kamiya.&lt;ref name="SokhadzeEtal2008" /&gt; Beta and SMR training can be considered a more directly physiological approach, strengthening sensorimotor inhibition in the cortex and inhibiting alpha patterns, which slow metabolism.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} Alpha-theta training, however, derives from the psychotherapeutic model and involves accessing of painful or repressed memories through the alpha-theta state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reel |first1=Justine J. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Eating Disorders: An Encyclopedia of Causes, Treatment, and Prevention |date=2013 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-4408-0058-0 |page=300 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The alpha-theta state is a term that comes from the representation on the EEG.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

A recent development in the field is a conceptual approach called the Coordinated Allocation of Resource Model (CAR) of brain functioning which states that specific cognitive abilities are a function of specific electrophysiological variables which can overlap across different cognitive tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Thornton K. |author2=Carmody D. |year=2009 |title=Eyes-Closed and Activation QEEG Databases in Predicting Cognitive Effectiveness and the Inefficiency Hypothesis | journal=Journal of Neurotherapy |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=1–22 |doi=10.1080/10874200802429850}}&lt;/ref&gt; The activation database guided EEG biofeedback approach initially involves evaluating the subject on a number of academically relevant cognitive tasks and compares the subject's values on the QEEG measures to a normative database, in particular on the variables that are related to success at that task.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Neuroplasticity==

In 2010, a study provided some evidence of [[neuroplastic]] changes occurring after brainwave training. Half an hour of voluntary control of brain rhythms led in this study to a lasting shift in cortical excitability and intracortical function.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100310114936.htm Science Daily]&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors observed that the cortical response to [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS) was significantly enhanced after neurofeedback, persisted for at least 20&amp;nbsp;minutes, and was correlated with an EEG time-course indicative of [[activity-dependent plasticity]].&lt;ref name="Ros2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ros T, Munneke MA, Ruge D, Gruzelier JH, Rothwell JC | title = Endogenous control of waking brain rhythms induces neuroplasticity in humans | journal = The European Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 31 | issue = 4 | pages = 770–8 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 20384819 | doi = 10.1111/j.1460-9568.2010.07100.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="743">The '''panopticon gaze''' (from [[panopticon]]) is an ideological phrase, a [[metaphor]].  The panopticon gaze is the idea of a silent, unknown overseer in the society such as the government that subconsciously controlled all aspects of life.  It symbolizes extreme transparency within the society where the rulers or leaders can look down and know, being able to see exactly what is going on, influencing the actions of every individual.
[[Milan Kundera]] used this idea in his fictional novel about the Soviet Invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, ''[[The Unbearable Lightness of Being]]''.

'''Personal data services''' or '''personal data stores''' (PDS) are services to let an individual store, manage and deploy their key personal data in a highly secure and structured way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=|date=|url=https://mydex.org/understand-pds/|title=UNDERSTANDING PERSONAL DATA STORES (PDS)|work=|publisher=mydex|accessdate=2016-01-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001065833/https://mydex.org/understand-pds/|archivedate=2015-10-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

They give the user a central point of control for their personal information (e.g. interests, contact information, affiliations, preferences, friends). The user's data attributes being managed by the service may be stored in a co-located repository, or they may be stored multiple external distributed repositories, or a combination of both. Attributes from a PDS may be accessed via an API. Users of the same PDS instance may be allowed to selectively share sets of attributes with other users.

A '''plan''' is typically any diagram or list of steps with details of timing and resources, used to achieve an [[Goal|objective]] to do something. See also [[strategy]]. It is commonly understood as a [[modal logic|temporal]] [[set (mathematics)|set]] of intended actions through which one expects to achieve a [[goal]].

For [[space|spatial]] or [[Plane (geometry)|planar]] [[topology|topologic]] or [[topography|topographic]] sets see [[map]].
  
Plans can be formal or informal:
* Structured and formal plans, used by multiple people, are more likely to occur in [[project]]s, [[diplomacy]], [[career]]s, [[economic development]], [[military]] campaigns, [[combat]], [[sports]], [[games]], or in the conduct of other [[business]]. In most cases, the absence of a well-laid plan can have adverse effects: for example, a non-robust project plan can cost the organization time and money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pmhut.com/what-should-be-included-in-a-project-plan |title=What Should Be Included in a Project Plan |accessdate=December 18, 2009 |website=www.pmhut.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.forecastingprinciples.com/paperpdf/Value%20of%20Formal%20Planning.pdf | title = The Value of Formal Planning for Strategic Decisions: A Reply | author = J. Scott Armstrong | journal = Strategic Management Journal | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 183–185| year = 1986 | doi=10.1002/smj.4250070207}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Informal or [[ad hoc]] plans are created by individuals in all of their pursuits.

The most popular ways to describe plans are by their breadth, time frame, and specificity; however, these planning classifications are not independent of one another. For instance, there is a close relationship between the short- and long-term categories and the strategic and operational categories.

It is common for less formal plans to be created as abstract ideas, and remain in that form as they are maintained and put to use. More formal plans as used for business and military purposes, while initially created with and as an abstract thought, are likely to be written down, drawn up or otherwise stored in a form that is accessible to multiple people across time and space. This allows more reliable collaboration in the execution of the plan.

==Topics==

===Planning===
The term [[planning]] implies the working out of sub-components in some degree of elaborate detail. Broader-brush enunciations of objectives may qualify as metaphorical [[Technology roadmap|roadmap]]s. Planning literally just means the creation of a plan; it can be as simple as making a [[task list|list]]. It has acquired a technical meaning, however, to cover the area of [[government]] [[legislation]] and [[regulation]]s elated to the use of resources.

Planning can refer to the planned use of any and all resources, as in the succession of [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five-Year Plan]]s through which the government of the [[Soviet Union]] sought to develop the country. However, the term is most frequently used in relation to planning for the use of land and related resources, for example in [[urban planning]], [[transportation planning]], etc.

[[transportation planning|ión  planning]], etc.

In a governmental context, "planning" without any qualification is most likely to mean the regulation of [[land use]]. See also [[zoning]].

===Planners===
Planners are the professionals that have the requisite training to take or make decisions that will help or balance the society in order to have a functional, aesthetic, and convenient environment.

===Methodology===
Concepts such as [[top-down planning]] (as opposed to bottom-up planning) reveal similarities with the [[systems thinking]] behind the [[top-down model]].

The subject touches such broad fields as [[psychology]], [[game theory]], [[communication]]s and [[information theory]], which inform the planning methods that people seek to use and refine; as well as [[logic]] and [[science]] (i.e. methodological naturalism) which serve as a means of testing different parts of a plan for reliability or consistency.

The specific methods used to create and refine plans depend on who is to make it, who is to put it to use, and what resources are available for the task. The methods used by an [[individual]] in his or her [[mind]] or [[personal organizer]], may be very different from the collection of planning techniques found in a [[corporation|corporate]] board-room, and the planning done by a [[project manager]] has different priorities and uses different tools to the planning done by an [[engineer]] or [[industrial designer]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4755">'''Rafael Yossef Herman''' (born 1974 in [[Be'er Sheva]] רפאל י. הרמן) is an artist best known for his breakthrough photography project '''''Bereshit - Genesis'''''. Recalling the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] Creation story, this photography research project, of Israeli desert [[Negev]] trees, marked for the first time in photography history, a ''nocturnes photos'' that looks like taken in day light, using just the '''"moon-light"''', with no electronic or digital manipulation. The night, like never seen before, with monochromatic but full colored of its '''"colors of the night"'''. This lighted night, nearly divined, without [[shadow]], creates a new [[surrealism|surreal]] reality, one that our eye can not see and does not know.
 
The Bereshit project was exposed for the first time to public in Dec. 2006, in [[Milano]] [[Italy]], in the prestigious "Sala delle Cariatidi" &lt;ref&gt;Corriere Della Sera, [http://www.corriere.it/dynvm/dyn/vivimilano/edicola/dorsi/2006/12/20/vetrinatempolib/15_NOTIZD.shtml Curriere Della Sera Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404034505/http://www.corriere.it/dynvm/dyn/vivimilano/edicola/dorsi/2006/12/20/vetrinatempolib/15_NOTIZD.shtml |date=2011-04-04 }},  November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; of Palazzo Reale's museum of art. Bereshit photos, were one out of four fragments of [[Israel]],  that Rafael showed, under the title ''Magà''. The exhibition attracted the attention of the public and media, and above all, of the Milan's assessor of culture, [[Vittorio Sgarbi]], that wrote: "...His images are mirror of Creation, beyond which there is no more to say, revelation that only conceives the contemplative dimension, mixing spirit, mystery and material. Like this Herman wins the darkness." This occasion brought to Herman the invitation present the project to [[Pompidou Center]], [[Paris]]. In November 2007, in a personal exhibition titled Bereshit, in Studio Guastalla, Rafael Y. Herman discovered by the prestigious [[art historian]], [[writer]] and collector [[Arturo Schwarz]] that wrote on Herman's project&lt;ref&gt;Conference - The Light of the Creation [http://maurizioturchet.blogspot.com/2008_02_01_archive.html Images from Arturo Schwarz conference]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} February 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; "...this black light, is the responsible of the intense poetical aura, of this photos serial...". Newspaper and Magazine titled the exhibition like; The Voice Of The Moon (Arte), Symbolic Research (Elle), The Trees Of Herman (TG), The Beginning Of All (Bolletino). During this exhibition period, Rafael lost his father Maxim (b. 1937 [[Bucharest]] d. 2007 [[19 Kislev]] ) just before finishing to write a documentary/romance book on his father's family story during the second world war.

Rafael Y. Herman showed his works in South America, Europe, and Asia in collective and personal exhibitions. He was collaborating with [[Amnesty International]] and Behia's government at [[Bahian Carnival]] 2002. Herman was graduate in Economy and Management from [[Tel Aviv University]], and as a child had musical education for 13 years. Today he lives in Italy and spend his life between Europe, America, and Israel. Currently his multiform photographic projects roam from fashion to reportage, from editorial and movie set photography to experimental photo research.

[[File:Reciprocal altruism summary.svg|thumb|right|240px|Diagram showing reciprocal altruism]]
In [[evolutionary biology]], '''reciprocal altruism''' is a behaviour whereby an organism acts in a manner that temporarily reduces its fitness while increasing another organism's fitness, with the expectation that the other organism will act in a similar manner at a later time. The concept was initially developed by [[Robert Trivers]] to explain the evolution of cooperation as instances of mutually altruistic acts. The concept is close to the strategy of "[[tit for tat]]" used in [[game theory]].

==Theory==
The concept of "reciprocal altruism", as introduced by Trivers, suggests that [[altruism]], defined as an act of helping another individual while incurring some cost for this act, could have evolved since it might be beneficial to incur this cost if there is a chance of being in a reverse situation where the individual who was helped before may perform an altruistic act towards the individual who helped them initially.&lt;ref name="trivers"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trivers | first1 = R.L. | year = 1971 | title = The evolution of reciprocal altruism | url = | journal = Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 46 | issue = | pages = 35–57 | doi = 10.1086/406755 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept finds its roots in the work of [[W. D. Hamilton|W.D. Hamilton]], who developed mathematical models for predicting the likelihood of an altruistic act to be performed on behalf of one's kin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamilton|date=1964|title=The Genetical Evolution of Social Behavior II|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=7|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(64)90039-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Putting this into the form of a strategy in a repeated [[prisoner’s dilemma]] would mean to cooperate unconditionally in the first period and behave cooperatively (altruistically) as long as the other agent does as well.&lt;ref name="trivers" /&gt; If chances of meeting another reciprocal altruist are high enough, or if the game is repeated for a long enough amount of time, this form of altruism can evolve within a population.

This is close to the notion of "[[tit for tat]]" introduced by [[Anatol Rapoport]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Dawkins, Richard (2006). The Selfish Gene (30th Anniversary ed.). United Kingdom: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-929114-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; although there still seems a slight distinction in that "tit for tat" cooperates in the first period and from thereon always replicates an opponent’s previous action, whereas “reciprocal altruists” stop cooperation in the first instance of non-cooperation by an opponent and stay non-cooperative from thereon. This distinction leads to the fact that in contrast to reciprocal altruism, tit for tat may be able to restore cooperation under certain conditions despite cooperation having broken down.

Christopher Stephens shows a set of necessary and jointly sufficient conditions “… for an instance of reciprocal altruism:&lt;ref name="Stephens"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stephens | first1 = C. | year = 1996 | title = Modelling Reciprocal Altruism | url = | journal = British Journal for the Philosophy of Science | volume = 47 | issue = 4| pages = 533–551 | doi = 10.1093/bjps/47.4.533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# the behaviour must reduce a donor's fitness relative to a selfish alternative;&lt;ref name="Stephens"/&gt;
# the fitness of the recipient must be elevated relative to non-recipients;&lt;ref name="Stephens"/&gt;
# the performance of the behaviour must not depend on the receipt of an immediate benefit;&lt;ref name="Stephens"/&gt;
# conditions 1, 2, and 3 must apply to both individuals engaging in reciprocal helping.&lt;ref name="Stephens"/&gt;

There are two additional conditions necessary "…for reciprocal altruism to evolve:"&lt;ref name="Stephens"/&gt;

* A mechanism for detecting 'cheaters' must exist.&lt;ref name="Stephens"/&gt;
* A large (indefinite) number of opportunities to exchange aid must exist.&lt;ref name="Stephens"/&gt;

The first two conditions are necessary for altruism as such, while the third is distinguishing reciprocal altruism from simple mutualism and the fourth makes the interaction reciprocal.
Condition number five is required as otherwise non-altruists may always exploit altruistic behaviour without any consequences and therefore evolution of reciprocal altruism would not be possible. However, it is pointed out that this “conditioning device” does not need to be conscious. Condition number six is required to avoid cooperation breakdown through backwards induction&amp;mdash;a possibility suggested by game theoretical models.&lt;ref name="Stephens" /&gt;

==Examples==
The following examples could be understood as altruism. 
However, showing reciprocal altruism in an unambiguous way requires more evidence as will be shown later.

===Cleaner fish===
{{further|Cleaning symbiosis}}
[[File:Cleaner station komodo.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Cleaning symbiosis]]: a small cleaner [[wrasse]] (''Labroides dimidiatus'') with [[Animal coloration|advertising coloration]] services a big eye squirrelfish (''[[Priacanthidae|Priacanthus hamrur]]'') in an apparent example of reciprocal altruism.]]

An example of reciprocal altruism is [[cleaning symbiosis]], such as between [[cleaner fish]] and their hosts, though cleaners include shrimps and birds, and clients include fish, turtles, octopuses and mammals.&lt;ref name=Grutter&gt;{{cite journal | title=Cleaning symbioses from the parasites' perspective | author=Grutter, Alexandra S. | journal=Parasitology | year=2002 | volume=124 | issue=7 | pages=S65–S81 | doi=10.1017/S0031182002001488}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Aside from the apparent [[symbiosis]] of the cleaner and the host during actual cleaning, which cannot be interpreted as altruism, the host displays additional behaviour that meets the criteria for altruism:

The host fish allows the cleaner fish free entrance and exit and does not eat the cleaner, even after the cleaning is done.&lt;ref name="Eibel-Eibesfeldt"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1439-0310.1955.tb01523.x | title = Über Symbiosen, Parasitismus und andere besondere zwischenartliche Beziehungen tropischer Meeresfische1 | year = 2010 | last1 = Eibi-Eibesfeldt | first1 = T | journal = Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 203–219 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heidiger"&gt;Heidiger, H. 1968. Putzer-fische im aquarium. Natur und Museum, 98:89–96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Randall1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Randall | first1 = J. E. | year = 1958 | title = A review of the Labrid fish genus Labriodes with descriptions of two new species and notes on ecology | journal = Pacific Science | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 327–347 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Randall2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Randall | first1 = J. E. | year = 1962 | title = Fish service stations | journal = Sea Frontiers | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 40–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The host signals the cleaner it is about to depart the cleaner's locality, even when the cleaner is not in its body. The host sometimes chases off possible dangers to the cleaner.&lt;ref name="Randall2" /&gt;

The following evidence supports the hypothesis:

The cleaning by cleaners is essential for the host. In the absence of cleaners the hosts leave the locality or suffer from injuries inflicted by ecto-parasites.&lt;ref name="Feder"&gt;Feder, H. M. 1996. "Cleaning symbioses in the marine environment". In S. M. Henry (ed.), ''Symbiosis'', Vol. 1, pp. 327–380. Academic Press, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt; There is difficulty and danger in finding a cleaner. Hosts leave their element to get cleaned.&lt;ref name="Randall2" /&gt; Others wait no longer than 30 seconds before searching for cleaners elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Eibel-Eibesfeldt" /&gt;

A key requirement for the establishment of reciprocal altruism is that the same two individuals must interact repeatedly, as otherwise the best strategy for the host would be to eat the cleaner as soon as cleaning was complete. This constraint imposes both a spatial and a temporal condition on the cleaner and on its host. Both individuals must remain in the same physical location, and both must have a long enough lifespan, to enable multiple interactions. There is reliable evidence that individual cleaners and hosts do indeed interact repeatedly.&lt;ref name="Randall1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Feder" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Limbaugh"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Limbaugh | first1 = C. | last2 = Pederson | first2 = H. | last3 = Chase | first3 = F. | year = 1961 | title = Shrimps that clean fishes | url =http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/umrsmas/bullmar/1961/00000011/00000001/art00011 | journal = Bull. Mar. Sci. Gulf Caribb. | volume = 11 | issue =1 | pages = 237–257 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This example meets some, but not all, of the criteria described in Trivers’s model. In the cleaner-host system the benefit to the cleaner is always immediate. However, the evolution of reciprocal altruism is contingent on opportunities for future rewards through repeated interactions. In one study, nearby host fish observed "cheater" cleaners and subsequently avoided them.&lt;ref name="bshary"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bshary | first1 = R. | year = 2002 | title = Biting cleaner fish use altruism to deceive image-scoring client reef fish | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B | volume = 269 | issue = 1505 | pages = 2087–2093 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2002.2084| pmid = 12396482 | pmc = 1691138 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these examples, true reciprocity is difficult to demonstrate since failure means the death of the cleaner. However, if Randall’s claim that hosts sometimes chase off possible dangers to the cleaner is correct, an experiment might be constructed in which reciprocity could be demonstrated.&lt;ref name="Randall1" /&gt;

===Warning calls in birds===
[[File:2012-06-09 16-04-22 Switzerland Kanton Graubünden Sagliaz cropped.JPG|thumb|Eurasian jay, ''[[Garrulus glandarius]]'', gives loud alarm calls from its tree perch when it sees a predator.]]
{{further|Signalling theory}}

Warning calls, although exposing a bird and putting it in danger, are frequently given by birds. An explanation in terms of altruistic behaviors given by Trivers:&lt;ref name="trivers"/&gt;

It has been shown that predators learn specific localities and specialize individually on prey types and hunting techniques.&lt;ref name="Murie"&gt;Murie, A. 1944. The Wolves of Mount McKinley. Fauna of National Parks, Faunal Series # 5; Wash., D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Southern"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Southern | first1 = H. N. | year = 1954 | title = Tawny owls and their prey | url = | journal = Ibis | volume = 96 | issue = 3| pages = 384–410 |doi=10.1111/j.1474-919X.1954.tb02332.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tinbergen"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tinbergen | first1 = N. | year = 1968 | title = On war and peace in animals and man | url = | journal = Science | volume = 160 | issue = 3835| pages = 1411–1418 | doi = 10.1126/science.160.3835.1411 | pmid = 5690147 |bibcode = 1968Sci...160.1411T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Owen"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Owen | first1 = D. F. | year = 1963 | title = Similar polymorphismas in an insect and a land snail | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 198 | issue = 4876| pages = 201–203 | doi = 10.1038/198201b0 |bibcode = 1963Natur.198..201O }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is therefore disadvantageous for a bird to have a predator eat a conspecific, because the experienced predator may then be more likely to eat him. Alarming another bird by giving a warning call tends to prevent predators from specializing on the caller’s species and locality. In this way, birds in areas in which warning calls are given will be at a selective advantage relative to birds in areas free from warning calls.

Nevertheless, this presentation lacks important elements of reciprocity. It is very hard to detect and ostracize cheaters. There is no evidence that a bird refrains from giving calls when another bird is not reciprocating, nor evidence that individuals interact repeatedly. Given the aforementioned characteristics of bird calling, a continuous bird emigration and immigration environment (true of many avian species) is most likely to be partial to cheaters, since selection against the [[Gene-centered view of evolution|selfish gene]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; is unlikely.&lt;ref name="trivers" /&gt;

Another explanation for warning calls is that these are not warning calls at all:
A bird, once it has detected a bird of prey, calls to signal to the bird of prey that it was detected, and that there is no use trying to attack the calling bird. Two facts support this hypothesis:

* The call frequencies match the hearing range of the predator bird.
* Calling birds are less attacked—predator birds attack calling birds less frequently than other birds.

===Nest protecting===

[[File:Arctic tern (Sterna paradisaea) attacking, Amsterdam island, Svalbard.jpg|thumb|[[Arctic tern]]s protect their offspring extremely aggressively by very quick drop-downs from a stationary flight over their enemies. Other birds often benefit from this behavior by breeding very close to the Arctic terns.]]
[[Red-winged blackbird]] males help defend neighbor's nests. There are many theories as to why males behave this way. One is that males only defend other nests which contain their extra-pair offspring. Extra-pair offspring is juveniles which may contain some of the male bird's DNA. Another is the tit-for-tat strategy of reciprocal altruism. A third theory is, males help only other closely related males. A study done by The Department of Fisheries and Wildlife provided evidence that males used a tit-for-tat strategy. The Department of Fisheries and Wildlife tested many different nests by placing stuffed crows by nests, and then observing behavior of neighboring males. The behaviors they looked for included the number of calls, dives, and strikes. After analyzing the results, there was not significance evidence for kin selection; the presence of extra-pair offspring did not affect the probability of help in nest defense. However, males reduced the amount of defense given to neighbors when neighbor males reduced defense for their nests. This demonstrates a tit-for-tat strategy, where animals help those who previously helped them. This strategy is one type of reciprocal altruism.&lt;ref&gt;Olendorf, Robert, Thomas Getty, and Kim Scribner. "Cooperative Nest Defence in Red–winged 
Blackbirds: Reciprocal Altruism, Kinship or By–product Mutualism?" Cooperative Nest Defence in Red–winged Blackbirds: Reciprocal Altruism, Kinship or By–product Mutualism?Royal Society Publishing, 22 Jan. 2004. Web. 14 Sept. 2014. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vampire bats===
[[Vampire bats]] also display reciprocal altruism, as described by Wilkinson.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilkinson | first1 = G. | year = 1984 | title = Reciprocal Food Sharing in the Vampire Bat | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 308 | issue = 5955| pages = 181–184 | doi=10.1038/308181a0 | bibcode=1984Natur.308..181W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilkinson2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilkinson | first1 = G. | year = 1988 | title = Reciprocal Altruism in Bats and Other Mammals | url = | journal = Ethology and Sociobiology | volume = 9 | issue =2–4 | pages = 85–100 | doi=10.1016/0162-3095(88)90015-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The bats feed each other by regurgitating blood. Since bats only feed on blood and will die after just 70 hours of not eating, this food sharing is a great benefit to the receiver and a great cost to the giver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carter|first1=Gerald|title=Food Sharing in Vampire Bats: Reciprocal Help Predicts Donations More than Relatedness or Harassment | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society|date=January 2, 2013 |url= https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3574350/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To qualify for reciprocal altruism, the benefit to the receiver would have to be larger than the cost to the donor. This seems to hold as these bats usually die if they do not find a blood meal two nights in a row. Also, the requirement that individuals who have behaved altruistically in the past are helped by others in the future is confirmed by the data.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson1" /&gt; However, the consistency of the reciprocal behaviour, namely that a previously non-altruistic bat is refused help when it requires it, has not been demonstrated. Therefore, the bats do not seem to qualify yet as an unequivocal example of reciprocal altruism.

===Primates===
Grooming in primates meets the conditions for reciprocal altruism according to some studies.  One of the studies in vervet monkeys shows that among unrelated individuals, grooming induce higher chance of attending to each other's calls for aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Grooming, alliances and reciprocal altruism in vervet monkeys|last = Seyfarth|first = Robert M|date = 1984|journal = Nature |volume=308 |issue = 5959|pages=541–543|doi = 10.1038/308541a0|pmid = 6709060|access-date = |first2 = Dorothy L|last2 = Cheney|bibcode = 1984Natur.308..541S}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, vervet monkeys also display grooming behaviors within group members, displaying alliances.&lt;ref name="sibships"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = P.C. | year = 1987 | title = Sibships: Cooperation and Competition Among Immature Vervet Monkeys. | url = | journal = [[Primates (journal)|Primates]] | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 47–59 | doi=10.1007/bf02382182}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would demonstrate vervet monkey's grooming behavior as a part of kin selection since the activity is done between siblings in this study. Moreover, following the criteria by Stephen,&lt;ref name="Stephens" /&gt; if the study is to be an example of reciprocal altruism, it must prove the mechanism for detecting cheaters.

==Regulation by emotional disposition==
In comparison to that of other animals, the human altruistic system is a sensitive and unstable one.&lt;ref name="trivers" /&gt; Therefore, the tendency to give, to cheat, and the response to other’s acts of giving and cheating must be regulated by a complex psychology in each individual, social structures, and cultural traditions. Individuals differ in the degree of these tendencies and responses.
According to [[Trivers]], the following emotional dispositions and their evolution can be understood in terms of regulation of altruism.&lt;ref name="trivers" /&gt;

*Friendship and emotions of liking and disliking.
*Moralistic aggression. A protection mechanism from cheaters acts to regulate the advantage of cheaters in selection against altruists. The moralistic altruist may want to educate or even punish a cheater.
*Gratitude and sympathy. A fine regulation of altruism can be associated with gratitude and sympathy in terms of cost/benefit and the level in which the beneficiary will reciprocate.
*Guilt and reparative altruism. Prevents the cheater from cheating again. The cheater shows regret to avoid paying too dearly for past acts.
*Subtle cheating. A stable evolutionary equilibrium could include a low percentage of mimics in controversial support of adaptive sociopathy.
*Trust and suspicion. These are regulators for cheating and subtle cheating.
*Partnerships. Altruism to create friendships.

It is not known how individuals pick partners as there has been little research on choice. Modeling indicates that altruism about partner choices is unlikely to evolve, as costs and benefits between multiple individuals are variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schino | first1 = G. | last2 = Aureli | first2 = F. | year = 2010 | title = A few misunderstandings about reciprocal altruism | journal = Commun. Integr. Biol. | volume = 3 | issue = 6| pages = 561–563 | doi = 10.4161/cib.3.6.12977 | pmid = 21331239 | pmc=3038063}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the time or frequency of reciprocal actions contributes more to an individual's choice of partner than the reciprocal act itself.

== Overview ==
The concept of ″altruism″ was firstly coined by the French philosopher Auguete Comte in the 19th century, which was derived from the French word ″''altruisme''″.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Comte believed that ″altruism″ is a moral doctrine, which is the opposite of egoism, emphasizing the noble morality of sacrificing themselves and benefiting others. Human beings have both selfish and altruistic motivations, and altruism is used to restrain the egoistical instinct.&lt;ref&gt;Comte, A. (1858). ''The catechism of positive religion''. London: John Chapman Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Comte’s altruism describes the nature of human and ethical significances, but it’s completely different from the altruism in biological sciences. In evolutionary biology, altruism is an individual behavior that benefits another individual’s fitness but reduces their own fitness in population&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham, B. (2008). ''Selection: the mechanism of evolution''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 367-368.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of ″altruism″ in biology arose from the debate of ″the Problem of Altruism″ in Natural Selection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Charles Darwin suggested that animals behave in the ways that can increase their survival and reproductive chances while competing with others. However, altruistic behavior – the act of helping others even if it accompanies with a personal cost – is common in the animal kingdom, like the Vampire Bat&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, G. (1988). Reciprocal Altruism in bats and other mammals. ''Ethology and Sociobiology''. 9 (2–4): pp. 85–100.&lt;/ref&gt; and pariousrprimates.&lt;ref&gt;Seyfarth, R. M. &amp; Cheney, D. L. (1984). Grooming, alliances and reciprocal altruism in vervet monkeys. ''Nature''. 308 (5959): pp. 541–543.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Charles Darwin regarded ″the Problem of Altruism″ as a potential fatal challenge to his concept of natural selection. In ″The Descent of Man″, Darwin (1859) wrote:&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Darwin, C. (1859). ''On the origin of species by means of Natural Selection''. London: John Murray.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|1=He who was ready to sacrifice his life, as many a savage has been, rather than betray his comrades, would often leave no offspring to inherit his noble nature.}}

In 1964, William Hamilton&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Hamilton, D. W. (1964). The genetic evolution of social behavior, I and II. ''Journal of Theoretical Biology'', 7, pp. 1-52.&lt;/ref&gt; developed mathematical model and put forward to his theory – ″Kin selection″ theory or ″Inclusive fitness″ theory. ″Kin selection″ theory or ″Inclusive fitness″ theory reveals that an altruistic gene evolved by natural selection. The gene can be only shared with relatives, and reduces the individuals own fitness but boots the fitness of their relatives and off-springs. In this way, this behavior increases the proportion of altruistic gene in population. Hamilton’s rule provides mathematical inequality to state that an altruistic gene spread by natural selection only if the following condition can be satisfied: r B &gt; C, where C is the cost to the individual performing the altruistic act, B is the benefit gained by the recipients of the altruistic act, r is the genetic relatedness between individual and recipients.

Hamilton's &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; ″Kin selection″ theory or ″Inclusive fitness″ theory expands the Darwinian definition of ″fitness″ and continues the same Darwinian framework that allows the spread of not only selfish genes but also altruistic genes. Nevertheless, Hamilton’s theory did not support an appropriate explanation with unrelated members of other species. In order to solve this problem, Robert Trivers &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; developed the original theory of reciprocal altruism into an attempt to explain the altruism behaviors among unrelated organisms. The idea of reciprocal altruism is straightforward: an altruistic behavior is probably selected only if a return would be obtained in the future. It is similar to the Tit-for-Tat strategy &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; from the game theory explained later in the paper.

The theory of reciprocal altruism in humanity, based on the biological characteristics of human beings and the realistic society, explicates the interdependence and cooperation between people, as well as its rationality. It also demonstrates the original motivations and the internal mechanisms of the human cooperation, revealing the inevitability and social significance ranging from kin altruism to un-relative altruism in the human population. As a result, the subjective guess and emotion of human cooperation can be refined to a theory, and is gradually become one of the most popular explanations to a variety of social behaviors. In addition, cooperation is the most deep-seated foundation for the formation and existence of human society. Therefore, the proposition of reciprocal altruism is undoubtedly a great theoretical advance in human cognition history.

Human reciprocal altruism seems to be a huge magnetic field to interweave different disciplines closely. New exploration has been made by these disciplines at different levels from different points. Generally, the core of Human reciprocal altruism is located in the puzzle: How to overcome short-term self-interest and achieve cooperation. Ultimately, it reveals that altruistic individuals are more competitive than selfish individuals, on either improving individual fitness or resolving conflicts. The compatibility and complementarity of different theoretical perspectives lay the basis of human reciprocal altruism, and help with exploring human different viewpoints of human reciprocal altruism. The debate of human reciprocal altruism has been the focus of biology, sociology, economics and culture.

== Scientific viewpoints==

=== Biology===
In 1902, Peter Kropotkin&lt;ref&gt;Kropotkin, P. (1902). ''Mutual aid: a factor of evolution''. New York: Alfred A. Knope.&lt;/ref&gt; published his monograph – ''Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution'', and demonstrates the survival mechanisms of cooperation, based on various examplesm of animal and human societies. He attempted to reveal that the law of biological evolution is mutual aid rather than survival competition. Mutual aid and cooperation are the principles of all species’ biological evolution including human beings’, and the concepts resulting in a profound influence upon biological evolution. Wilson&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, E. O. (1975). ''Sociobiology: the new synthesis''. New York: Harvard University press.&lt;/ref&gt; applied the term of ″sociobiology″ as an attempt to explain social behavior of insect and thus explored the evolutionary mechanism of other animals including human such as the social behavior, altruism. He argued that human altruistic behavior, as one of the human nature characteristics, is the result of the genetic inheritance.

In 1971, Trivers published one of the most important biological articles of the 20th century -  ''The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism'' &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and introduced the term of ″reciprocal altruism″ to explain the evolution of cooperation. The idea of reciprocal altruism is almost the same as kin selection, except to put emphasis on reciprocation instead of the need for genetic relatedness. It described that an altruistic trait or behavior may be selected, because the recipient will very likely to return benefits to the altruistic sender. If the reproductive benefit that the altruistic sender receives in return is larger than the cost initially incurred by the altruistic action, individuals who engage in this kind of reciprocal altruism will outbreed those who do not. Therefore, a seemingly altruistic trait can spread in a population. The reciprocation can be delayed as long as the individuals stay in the trade, and, so to speak, have sufficient long-term memory. This explains many features of human social life, for example, we do a favor for someone with the expectation that the favor would be remembered, and lead to a return in the future.

As Trivers supported the foundation for reciprocal altruism, Axelrod and Hamilton &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Axelrod, R. &amp; Hamilton, W. D. (1981). The evolution of cooperation. ''Science'', 211, pp. 1390-1396.&lt;/ref&gt; applied the Game Theory to study the mechanism of reciprocal altruism, and attempted to answer the key question: How altruism spreads when cheating is an all-win strategy used by members of the population. In this paper, Axelrod and Hamilton &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; revealed that reciprocating the assistance from another individual is stable in evolution as long as there are enough altruists in the population.  They also demonstrate that a population of altruists can initially emerge through inclusive fitness, helping and receiving help among genetically related individuals. Subsequent work indicates that only a few altruists are initially needed for the emergence of reciprocation in a heterogeneous population.&lt;ref&gt;Nowak, M. &amp; Sigmund, K. (1992). Tit for Tat in heterogeneous population. ''Nature'', 355, pp.250–253.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some evolutionary biologists, like Richard Dawkins, wholly endorse Axelrod and Hamilton’s work in individual selection. In describing genes as being selfish, Dawkins&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Dawkins, R. (1976). ''The selfish gene''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; states that the organisms act altruistically against their individual interests in order to help copies of themselves in other bodies to replicate. Essentially, reciprocal altruism is the individual behavior behind selfish motivations. The bird is a prime example in the narrative of Dawkins:&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; those altruistic birds who sacrifice their own interests by reproducing late or less during hard times would not have been able to pass their altruistic genes to the future generations, which will be dominated by the selfish genes from birds who take advantage of the situation by using up others’ food supply to reproduce their own offspring. Nevertheless, some scholars such as K. Lorenz and W. Edwards have been strongly opposed to the individual selection. In contrast, they spearhead the campaign of group selection.

The debate whether individuals/gene or group/species are the basic level/unit of selection has occurred since the 1960s. The major idea of group selection is that individuals may sacrifice their own reproductive interests for the benefit of the survival of the group to which they belong. W. Edwards&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, W. V. C. (1962). ''Animal dispersion in relation to social behavior''. Edinburgh: Oliver and Boyd.&lt;/ref&gt; builds this argument mainly on birth related behaviors of birds. He points out that many bird species with small clutches have prolonged periods before reaching reproductive maturity, and have long breeding seasons sometimes in excess of one year. Other group selection supporters also argue that these behaviors must be social and altruistic in that, for example, when food supply is abundant, clutches are bigger than when food supply is more scarce. Birds thus can regulate their population densities below starvation levels through social conventions. All of these characteristics run contrary to the idea that fitness is defined by individual organisms attempting to selfishly reproduce. However, it soon became clear that group selection was losing the battle. In 1966, George Williams&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, G. C. (1966). ''Adaptation and natural selection: a critique of some current evolutionary thought''. Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; published the influential ''Adaptation and Natural'' ''Selection: a critique of some current evolutionary thought''. By the end of the 1960s, a Neo-Darwinian interpretation of the modern synthesis had taken hold and it has become almost a gold standard that the unit of evolutionary analysis is at the individual's and the gene’s level. Dawkins, Hamilton, and Trivers represent the mainstream view of individual selection.

=== Sociology===
Some scholars, such as Michael Taylor, Anatol Rapoport, Robert Keohane, Arthur Stein, Helen Milner and Kennth Oye, point out that reciprocal altruism widely spread in international relations and human society, and international reciprocity is the foundation of the international community. States act in the confidence that their cooperative actions will be repaid in the long term instead of seeking for the immediate benefit, so reciprocal altruism can be seen as generally accepted standards in international relations.&lt;ref&gt;Keohane, R. O. (1986). Reciprocity in international relations. ''International Organization'', 40(1), pp. 1-27.&lt;/ref&gt; On a personal scale, some scholars believe that reciprocal altruism derives from the subjective feeling of individuals and compliance with social rules. Smith put forward an alternative based on the idea of sympathy and indicates that altruistic behavior is the product of the measure of gains and losses, emphasizing that people are easy to compare with others when measuring the gains and losses. Due to this, the subjective sense of fairness exerts an effect on people's altruistic behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Khalil, E. L. (2001). Adam Smith and three theories of altruism. ''Louvain Economic Review'', 67(4), pp.421-435.&lt;/ref&gt; For humans, social norms can be argued to reduce individual level variation and competition, thus shifting selection to the group level, so human behavior should be consistent with social norms.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, D. S. &amp; Wilson, E. O. (2008). Evolution ″for the good of the group″. ''American Scientist'', 96 (5): pp. 380–389.&lt;/ref&gt; Altruistic behavior is the result of learning and internalizing these social norms by individuals.

=== Economy===

==== Economic model ====
The economic model of reciprocal altruism includes direct reciprocity and indirect reciprocity. Direct reciprocity is an immediate collaborative exchange that benefits everyone. Direct reciprocity was introduced by Robert Trivers&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ) as a mechanism for the evolution of cooperation. The direct reciprocal is typically one-for-one: I incur the cost today to benefit you, you incur the cost at some point later on to benefit me. There is little negotiation and the exchange is simple. The strategy of ″the prisoner dilemma″ is the common direct reciprocity.

The Prisoners Dilemma requires that:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

:temptation to defect (T=+5) &gt; reward for mutual cooperation(R=+3) &gt; being a sucker (S=-2)

and that:

:reward for mutual cooperation (R=+3) &gt; (T+S)/2.

There is immediate and obvious benefit from direct reciprocity and relatively little need for trust into the future. Cheating is a critical question and may happen at some time.

In the context of Indirect reciprocity, two players are randomly selected in a population, one is donor while the other is recipient. Each player can play many times, but never with the same partner twice. Thus it is impossible that a cheat is held to account by the victim. Obviously, trigger strategies can ensure a cooperative Nash equilibrium. If all players use these strategies, no player would have deviated.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Nowak, M. &amp; Sigmund, K. (2005). Evolution of indirect reciprocity. ''Nature'', 437, pp.1291-1298.&lt;/ref&gt; In many situations, cooperation is favored and it even benefits an individual to forgive a defection but cooperative societies are always unstable because mutants which are inclined to defect may lose any balance.&lt;ref&gt;Tbomas, R. (2012). Does it pay to be nice? – the math of altruism. Retrieved from April 23, 2017:&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Indirect reciprocity typifies two forms: ″Upstream reciprocity″ and ″Downstream reciprocity″.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In the description of "Figure1. Direct and indirect reciprocity", Nowak and Sigmund provided the explicit identifications of ″Upstream reciprocity″ and ″Downstream reciprocity″:&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Upstream reciprocity is based on a recent positive experience. A person who has been at the receiving end of a donation may feel motivated to donate in turn. Individual B, who has just received help from A, goes on to help C. ‘Downstream reciprocity’ is built on reputation. Individual A has helped B and therefore receives help from C. Mathematical investigations of indirect reciprocity have shown that natural selection can favor strategies that help others based on their reputation. Upstream reciprocity is harder to understand but is observed in economic experiments. In both cases, the decision to help can be interpreted as a misdirected act of gratitude. In one case recipients are thanked for what another did; in the other case they are thanked by someone who did not profit by what they did".(p.&amp;nbsp;1292.)

==== Utility function====
Utility function&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/072915/what-utility-function-and-how-it-calculated.asp|title=utility Function|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an important concept in economy that measures preferences over a set of goods and services using mathematics. In general, a utility function U (X, Y) will represent a consumer’s preferences for different goods if the following condition holds:

:U(A) &gt; U(B) if and only if A is preferred to B.

Economists, such as Gary S. Becker, use the theory of utility function and establish the hypothesis of altruism model. Becker&lt;ref&gt;Becker, S. G. (1976). ''The economic approach to human behavior''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the donor's utility function includes the utility of potential recipients. That is, the donor would donate a resource if the vicarious enjoyment of watching the pleasure of others exceeds at the margin the donor's satisfaction from consuming the resource himself. He indicates that all human behaviors are the maximization of different utility functions, and attempts to establish all human behaviors on the basis of generalized utility theory with resource constraints. He also puts the human irrational behavior into the framework of this analysis, emphasizing that human altruistic behavior can be defined by the generalized utility function appropriately.

==== Game theory====
Game theory, especially the prisoner’s dilemma, is originally introduced by Trivers&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; to explain the mechanism of reciprocal altruism. Unlike Hamilton’s inclusive fitness where the selection of an altruistic allele is ″secured″ by the extent of genetic relatedness between the donor and recipient, reciprocation is no guarantee and, in fact, cheating or not reciprocating is evolutionarily stable because cheaters are doubly rewarded reproductively. That is, they receive a benefit from helpers and, at the same time, helpers bear a cost for the cheaters, although the cost is smaller than the benefit.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Smith, J. M. (1982). ''Evolution and the theory of games. Cambridge'': Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The relationship between donor and recipient in reciprocal altruism is exactly analogous to the situation of the prisoner’s dilemma. In Triver’s narrative,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; the prisoner’s dilemma can be characterized by the following payoff matrix:
{| class="wikitable"
|
|A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
|A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|R, R
|S, T
|-
|C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|T, S
|P, P
|}

Where A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the individuals’ altruistic acts and C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the cheating acts, and where T represents the temptation to defect, R represents the reward for mutual cooperation and S stands for being a sucker.

And the following inequality must hold for reciprocal altruism:

:S &lt; P &lt; R &lt; T.

The Prisoner's dilemma becomes the classical example to understand the reciprocal altruism. Combining the theory of biological evolution with classical game theory, Maynard Smith&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; and George. R. Price explained how selfish individuals can achieve cooperation and develop the basic equilibrium concept in evolutionary - Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS). Evolutionarily Stable Strategy is a strategy and adopted by a population in a given environment. An ESS is an equilibrium refinement of the Nash equilibrium that once it is fixed in a population, natural selection alone is sufficient to prevent alternative strategies from invading successfully. Simultaneously, the collaboration between Axelrod and Hamilton is also significant for applying game theory to evolutionary issues. Their paper&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and the book ''Evolution and the theory'' ''of games'',&lt;ref&gt;Maynard, J. (1982). ''Evolution and the theory'' ''of games.'' London: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; written by John Maynard, illustrate that the process of natural selection can be mathematically modeled using game theory. In essence, natural selection entails differential replication of genes. That is, different traits and attributes are selected for or against because of the different effects they have on their ″own″ genetic reproduction or replication. The differential replication process, independent of its underlying nature being biological, physiological, or psychological, can be approximated by game theory. Different game-theoretical strategies have imbedded probabilistic functions that result in their winning or losing a game, similar to the selecting - for or selecting - against of genes.

The strategy of game theory discussed in Axelrod and Hamilton's paper&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; is called Tit for Tat. Tit for Tat represents such a strategy that, in a repeated game, the player starts by not telling on the other player or cooperates and subsequently reciprocates the same action undertaken by the other player. That is, the player cooperates if the other player cooperates and defects if the other player defects. As a game theoretical strategy, Tit for Tat essentially entails the same concept as Trivers' reciprocal altruism. Unlike Trivers' original publication which provides conceptual explanations and examples, Axelrod and Hamilton's paper provides more rigorous mathematical proofs of the viability or ESS of reciprocal altruism.&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, L. R. (2002). ''Natural selection and social theory: Selected papers of Robert Trivers''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reciprocal altruism has since become one of the major theoretical foundations of evolutionary psychology and game theory, and the repeated prisoner's dilemma game has also become popular tools by which to derive and test evolutionary psychological concepts. Social interactions similar in form to Tit for Tat are prevalent in our daily lives. When someone does you a favor, you feel you owe that person. If you fail to return the favor, you are likely to feel guilty and may try to find ways to overcompensate for your friend. Generally, when you do favors for another person, you are also likely to expect something in return. When that person fails to reciprocate, you may feel cheated and may seek revenge by not being generous to the person in the future. On the other hand, when someone gives you a large gift for which you did not do anything, you may feel uncomfortable and even resentful because you do not want to owe the person a debt. These behaviors and emotions that have clearly been selected for are consistent with the Tit for Tat game theoretical strategy and reciprocal altruism.

=== Culture ===
D. S. Wilson and E. O. Wilson&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, D. S. &amp; Wilson, E. O. (2007). Rethinking the theoretical foundation of sociobiology. ''The Quarterly Review of Biology'', 82(4), pp. 327-348.&lt;/ref&gt; stated that the speed and function of "gene evolution" in human society is far less than that of "cultural evolution", but these two elements interact, thus they achieve the evolution of human altruism. To further illustrate this mechanism, Dawkins&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; proposed the concept of ″Meme″ in his book ''The selfish gene.'' ″Meme″{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} refers to ″an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture″. It is seen as the basic unit of culture that can be transmitted from one mind to another. Susan Blackmore is one of the scholars that has made contributions to the theory of ″Meme″. Blackmore&lt;ref&gt;Blackmore, S. (1999). ''The Meme machine''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; insisted that memes are the medium of the spread of altruism. The transmission of altruism has been carried out through memes. Memes are true evolutionary replicators like genetics and undergo evolutionary change.

Nawaz has used the phrase "regressive left" to describe left-leaning people who—in his opinion—pander to Islamism, which he defines as a "global totalitarian theo-political project" with a "desire to impose any given interpretation of Islam over society as law"&lt;ref name="rad"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nawaz|first=Maajid|date=2012|title=Radical: My Journey out of Islamist Extremism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FIjms8hwoW8C|publisher=WH Allen|isbn=9781448131617}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which he opposes on the ground that "any desire to impose any version of Islam over anyone anywhere, ever, is a fundamental violation of our basic civil liberties".&lt;ref name="beast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/08/08/the-british-left-s-hypocritical-embrace-of-islamism.html|title=The British Left's Hypocritical Embrace of Islamism|author=Maajid Nawaz|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=8 August 2015|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nawaz, such sympathizers of Islamism include "[[Atheism|atheists]] who are on the side of the Islamists, defending Islamism in the name of cultural tolerance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQhu1A-Ats|title=Lateline: An atheist and a Muslim on the future of Islam|author=[[Tony Jones (news journalist)|Tony Jones]]|work=[[Lateline]]|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=28 October 2015|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an October 2015 interview with political talk show host [[Dave Rubin]], Nawaz elucidated further the reasoning behind his choice of the word "regressive" and hypothesized that a section of people on the left "genuinely believe" that they are fighting an "ideological war" against neoconservative and neocolonialist foreign policies of Western governments which promote state-organized violence and chaos in the form of wars and military invasions. In contrast, he claims that such leftists forgo their duty to denounce the violent acts of theocratic extremists such as Islamists, at times going so far as to "make alliances" with some of the most regressive, theocratic and murderous regimes and organizations. He cited [[Jeremy Corbyn]], leader of the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], as an example of someone who "has been historically very close" to supporters of Islamist organisations like [[Hamas]] and [[Hezbollah]]. In Nawaz's opinion, it is possible to denounce both neoconservative foreign policies such as the Iraq War (which he had opposed) and theocratic extremism, but those that he labels "regressive leftists" fail to do so he says.&lt;ref name=Nawaz&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rubin|first1=Dave|title=Maajid Nawaz and Dave Rubin Discuss the Regressive Left and Political Correctness|url=http://www.ora.tv/rubinreport/2015/10/2/maajid-nawaz-and-dave-rubin-discuss-the-regressive-left-political-correctness-0_twq2e3jhwn8|accessdate=3 January 2016|work=Rubin Report|date=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Nawaz, the notion that Muslims cannot cope with criticism or mockery of Islam and only react violently is "patronizing, self-pity inspiring mollycoddling" of the very Muslims it claims to serve and emancipate, because it does not expect them to be civil and control their anger.&lt;ref name="beast"/&gt; This "racism of low expectations" lowers the moral standards of people within minorities, seeking excuses if they express [[misogyny]], [[homophobia]],&lt;!-- Source has been checked: although not in the text, it is in the actual video presentation. --&gt; [[chauvinism]], [[bigotry]] or [[antisemitism]], whilst holding members of the majority to "universal liberal standards".&lt;ref name="Bigthink"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/videos/maajid-nawaz-on-islamic-reform|title=Je Suis Muslim: How Universal Secular Rights Protect Muslim Communities the Most|author=Maajid Nawaz|date=18 November 2015|publisher=[[Big Think]]|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haras Rafiq, managing director of Quilliam, expressed the view that there is a tendency of some on the left to excuse Islamism: "We have not got to grips with the symbiotic relationship between Islamism and far-right hatred, and the regressive left that is prepared to excuse Islamism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Adam Lebor|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2015/12/25/donald-trump-worse-voldemort-europeans-say-404653.html|title=Donald Trump: The America Stereotype Europeans Love To Hate|work=Newsweek|date=14 December 2015|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use of the term ==

In September 2015, Sam Harris and Maajid Nawaz participated in a public forum hosted by [[Harvard University]]'s Institute of Politics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI9QwEKqrso|title=Islam and the Future of Tolerance|author=Harvard's Institute of Politics hosting Sam Harris and Maajid Nawaz|publisher=Harvard’s Institute of Politics|date=|accessdate=3 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was later published in a short book, titled ''[[Islam and the Future of Tolerance]]'' (2015). In a review of the book in the magazine ''[[National Review#National Review Online|National Review Online]]'', political writer Brian Stewart noted that according to both Nawaz and Harris "regressive leftists" in the West are "willfully blind" to the fact that jihadists and Islamists make up a significant portion (20% in Harris's estimate) of the global Muslim community and the minority Muslim communities within the West, even though these factions are opposed to liberal values such as individual autonomy, freedom of expression, democracy, women's rights, gay rights, etc. Nawaz and Harris have denounced the paradoxically illiberal, isolationist and censuring attitude towards any criticism of this phenomenon, which they contend betrays universal liberal values and also abandons supporting and defending the most vulnerable liberal members living within the Muslim community such as women, homosexuals and apostates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Brian|date=7 October 2015|title=A Liberal Atheist and a Liberal Muslim Discuss the Problems of Contemporary Islam|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/425169/sam-harris-maajid-nawaz-islam-book|journal=[[National Review#National Review Online|National Review Online]]|publisher=|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, ''The Washington Times'' reported that American comedian and show host [[Bill Maher]] and British biologist and [[New Atheism|New Atheist]] author [[Richard Dawkins]] "lamented regressive leftists who fail to understand they are anything but liberal when it comes to Islam".&lt;ref name="WT20151003"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/3/bill-maher-richard-dawkins-blast-regressive-libera/|title=Bill Maher, Richard Dawkins blast 'regressive liberals' giving a 'free pass' to Islam|author=Kellan Howell|date=3 October 2015|work=[[The Washington Times]]|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maher noted a willingness to criticise anything except [[Islam]], excusing it as "their culture", to which Dawkins responded: "Well, to hell with their culture".&lt;ref name="Maher"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvvQJ_zsL1U|title=Real Time with Bill Maher: Richard Dawkins – Regressive Leftists (HBO)|date=2 October 2015|work=[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]|publisher=HBO|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/611231/Richard-Dawkins-in-extraordinary-blast-at-Muslims-To-hell-with-their-culture|title='To hell with their culture' - Richard Dawkins in extraordinary blast at Muslims|author=John Worthing|work=The Independent|date=27 October 2015|access-date=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Making reference to student initiatives to disinvite ex-Muslim speakers on campus, Dawkins saw this as "a betrayal of the Free Speech Movement of the 1960s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/richard-dawkins-free-speech_561038c4e4b0af3706e11397|title=Richard Dawkins: College Students Are Betraying The Free Speech Movement|author=Tyler Kingkade|work=Huffington Post|date=3 October 2015|accessdate=3 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October and November 2015, Sam Harris frequently used the term in his exchanges with the media, saying the greatest danger is that the "regressive left" is willing to give up [[freedom of speech]] "out of fear of offending minorities", which will lead to [[censorship]] imposed by those minorities, citing American journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]]'s comments on the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting]] as an example.&lt;ref name="Chris Beck"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.splicetoday.com/politics-and-media/sam-harris-unloads-on-the-regressive-left|title=Sam Harris Unloads on the Regressive Left|author=Chris Beck|work=[[Splice Today]]|publisher=[[Russ Smith (publisher)|Russ Smith]]|date=21 October 2015|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Salon20151125&gt;{{cite web|author=Sean Illing|title=Sam Harris talks Islam, ISIS, atheism, GOP madness: "We are confronting people, in dozens of countries, who despise more or less everything that we value"|url=http://www.salon.com/2015/11/25/harris_and_illing_correspondence/|publisher=Salon.com|date=25 November 2015|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris considers [[Reza Aslan]]&lt;ref name="Chris Beck"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Salon20151125/&gt; and [[Noam Chomsky]] to be of the regressive left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawstory.com/2015/10/sam-harris-is-still-mad-about-liberals-who-followed-noam-chomsky-off-the-edge-of-the-world/|title=Sam Harris is still mad about 'liberals who followed Noam Chomsky off the edge of the world'|publisher=Rawstory.com|date=16 October 2015|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell'', 15 October 15, 2015, MSNBC.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015 in an appearance on the talk radio show ''[[American Humanist Association|The Humanist Hour]]'', author and philosopher [[Peter Boghossian]] defined the term as a pejorative used to describe those on the left that have made the "strangest bedfellows" with the Islamists. According to him, the word "regressive" is used to contrast with the word "[[Progressivism|progressive]]" – the latter being the group that is egalitarian and wants to create systems of justice and [[racial equality]], while the former being a group that "[looks] for the worst in people... and [does] not extend hermeneutics of charity, or a charitable interpretation of anything anyone says, but uses it as a hammer to beat people down". In addition, Boghossian believes that "regressive leftists" have become "hyper-moralists" and champions of their perceived victims. He cites the historical wrongdoings such as [[slavery in the United States]] and [[colonialism]] as a legitimate concern that has caused mistrust of anything Western and capitalistic. He also added that "there are people who have suffered and still suffer legitimate instances of racism, homophobia etc. The problem is that every time the word racist is just thrown around like that, that word loses its meaning. And it should have quite a sting. That should be a horrible word".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast|url=http://thehumanist.com/multimedia/podcast/the-humanist-hour-175-the-regressive-left-and-safe-spaces-with-dr-peter-boghossian|title=The Humanist Hour #175: The "Regressive Left" and Safe Spaces, with Dr. Peter Boghossian|website=thehumanist.com|publisher=The Humanist Hour|host=Bo Bennett, Kim Ellington|date=4 November 2015|time=4:08, 9:48, 0:10|accessdate=7 January 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111234501/http://thehumanist.com/multimedia/podcast/the-humanist-hour-175-the-regressive-left-and-safe-spaces-with-dr-peter-boghossian|archivedate=11 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2015, talk show host Dave Rubin hosted discussions about the "regressive left" in several ''[[The Rubin Report]]'' segments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ora.tv/rubinreport/2015/10/8/milo-yiannopoulos-and-dave-rubin-discuss-gay-rights-and-cultural-libertarians-0_40xbq9svp490|title=Milo Yiannopoulos and Dave Rubin Discuss Gay Rights and Cultural Libertarians|publisher=Ora TV|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rubin describes the regressive left as "the left's version of the [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]]", saying that the regressive left will damage the Democratic Party in a similar way the Tea Party damages the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref name="Rubin7Oct"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzzLiJ6na1k|title=Dave Rubin: Regressives are the Left's Tea Party|work=[[The Rubin Report]]|date=7 October 2015 |accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political commentator [[David Pakman]] supported the concept in his [[The David Pakman Show|talk show]], saying "there are liberals who do use [[cultural relativism]] and distaste for US foreign policy as an excuse to defend or at least minimize violence and injustice that they would certainly otherwise oppose". Pakman has distanced himself from the term, saying that it is misused by conservatives to insult all liberals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pakman|first=David|authorlink=David Pakman|title=Would David Appear on Drunken Peasants or Illiberal Podcasts?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMremqM8Q28|website=[[The David Pakman Show]]|date=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pakman|first=David|authorlink=David Pakman|title=The Truth About the Regressive Left|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=315icKVWb6w|website=[[The David Pakman Show]]|date=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakman suggests that the actual regressive leftists are leftists who use authoritarianism to enforce progressivism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pakman|first=David|authorlink=David Pakman|title=Authoritarian Leftism: The Actual "Regressive Left"|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCUrTMmtHbo|website=[[The David Pakman Show]]|date=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
In November 2015, psychiatrist Khwaja Khusro Tariq from ''[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]'' classified the term as an unsubstantiated [[Ad hominem|''ad hominem'' attack]], stating that the harshest critics of Islam are courted by both liberal and conservative media in the United States. Khusro also stated the term has been directed towards Glenn Greenwald and Noam Chomsky, both of whom he said have never condoned violence or opined on the doctrine of Islam. He argued that there was no genuine inhibition on speaking against the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tariq|first=Khwaja|date=11 November 2015|title="Regressive Liberals": The New Mantra of Islamophobia|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/khwaja-khusro-tariq/regressive-liberals-the-n_b_8597284.html|newspaper=Huffington Post|accessdate= 9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, Joseph Bernstein, a ''[[BuzzFeed]]'' reporter on [[World Wide Web|web culture]], wrote that according to [[Google Trends]] interest in the term "shot up" in late 2015. According to Bernstein, instead of criticising "cultural tolerance gone too far", the phrase has "become a catch-all for any element of the dominant [[new media]] culture that the anti-[[Social justice warrior|SJW]] internet doesn't like". He also suggests that even though the term can be sourced back to self-described liberal commentators like Nawaz, Maher and Dawkins, it is currently heavily used by the [[alt-right]] and other Anti-SJW Groups on Internet forums and social media as part of their rhetorical warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Joseph|date=16 March 2016|title=The Rise Of The #Regressiveleft Hashtag|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/the-rise-of-the-regressiveleft-hashtag#.tf71OEVY1|newspaper=Buzzfeed|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''second-class citizen''' is a person who is systematically [[discrimination|discriminated]] against within a [[State (polity)|state]] or other [[Political division|political jurisdiction]], despite their nominal status as a citizen or legal resident there. While not necessarily [[slaves]], [[civil death|outlaws]] or [[criminals]], second-class citizens have limited legal rights, civil rights and socioeconomic opportunities, and are often subject to mistreatment or neglect at the hands of their putative superiors. However, they are different from "[[less-than-whole citizens]]",&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fragmented Citizens: The Changing Landscape of Gay and Lesbian Lives|last=Engel|first=Stephen|publisher=NYU Press|year=2016|isbn=1479809128|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as second-class citizens are often disregarded by the law or have it used to [[harassment|harass]] them (see [[police misconduct]] and [[racial profiling]]). Systems with ''[[de facto]]'' second-class citizenry are generally regarded as violating human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/second-class-citizen|title=the definition of second-class citizen|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2017-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/second-class%20citizen|title=Definition of SECOND-CLASS CITIZEN|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical conditions facing second-class citizens include but are not limited to: 
* [[disenfranchisement]] (a lack or loss of voting rights) 
* limitations on [[civil service|civil]] or [[military]] service (not including [[conscription]] in every case) 
* restrictions on [[language]], [[religion]], [[education]] 
* lack of freedom of movement and association 
* limitations on weapons ownership 
* restrictions on [[marriage]] 
* restrictions on [[Gender Identity|gender identity and expression]] 
* restrictions on [[House|housing]]  
* restrictions on [[property|property ownership]]

The category is normally unofficial and mostly academic, and the term itself is generally used as a [[pejorative]] and governments will typically deny the existence of a second class within the [[polity]]. As an informal category, second-class citizenship is not objectively measured; however, cases such as the [[American South]] under [[Racial segregation|segregation]], [[Aboriginal Australians|aborigines]] in [[Australia]] prior to 1967, [[apartheid]] in [[Republic of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Women's rights in Saudi Arabia|women]] in [[Saudi Arabia]] under Saudi law, [[Dalit]]s in [[India]] and [[Nepal]], and [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]] in [[Northern Ireland]] during the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|parliamentary]] era are all examples of groups that have been historically described as having second-class citizenry. Historically, before the mid-20th century, this policy was applied by some European [[Colonial empire|Colonial Empires]] on colonial [[Domicile (law)|residents]] of overseas holdings. 

A [[resident alien]] or [[foreign national]], and [[children]] in general, fit most definitions of second-class citizen. This does not mean that they do not have any legal protections, nor do they lack acceptance by the local population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/second-class-citizen|title=the definition of second-class citizen|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[naturalized]] citizen carries essentially the same rights and responsibilities as any other citizen (a possible exception being ineligibility for certain public offices), and is also legally protected.

* [[Non-citizens (Latvia)|Latvian non-citizens]] constitute a group similar to second-class citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neurope.eu/article/walk-latvian|title='Walk like a Latvian'|publisher=New Europe|date=2013-06-01|accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they are not considered foreigners (they hold no other citizenship, have Latvian IDs), they have reduced rights compared to full citizens. For example, non-citizens are not eligible to vote or hold public office. The [[European Commission against Racism and Intolerance]] has described their status as making "people concerned feel like “second-class citizens”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hudoc.ecri.coe.int/XMLEcri/ENGLISH/Cycle_03/03_CbC_eng/LVA-CbC-III-2008-2-ENG.pdf Third report on Latvia.

* New Zealanders receive automatically a "[[Special Category Visa]]" upon entering Australia, which presents no pathway to Australian citizenship.  New Zealanders are denied access to [[Centrelink]], to name just one of the services.  This means that if, for example, a New Zealand person came to Australia to live with his or her Australian spouse, and that spouse committed domestic violence upon them, the New Zealander could not then turn to Centrelink to provide them with funds to leave the abusive spouse. 
* Mainland Chinese citizens who are settling in Hong Kong or Macau by means of a [[one-way permit]] do not have citizenship rights (such as obtaining a [[passport]]) in both the mainland or the SAR after settling but before obtaining the permanent resident status, effectively rendering them second-class citizens.
* [[Burakumin]] (部落民) is a designation of Japanese Second-class status meaning the people who are from a place called a "buraku." “Buraku” basically means a village or small district. For a long time, people have discriminated against people from a "buraku" even though they belong to the same [[Race (human categorization)|race]], and there are no differences between ordinary [[Japanese people|Japanese]] people and people who are called burakumin. It is not clear when and why this started, but it is said that it was most common in the [[Edo period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roth|first1=Louis Frédéric ; translated by Käthe|title=Japan encyclopedia|date=2005|publisher=Belknap|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780674017535|pages=93–94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;pg=PA93#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often called "eta" (穢多) or "[[hinin]]" (非人) meaning polluted or not a human.  Even though in [[Meiji 4]] (1871), this discrimination was officially ended by kaihourei ([[:ja:解放令|解放令]]), many people resisted it and continued treating them as burakumin. Today, fewer people are discriminate towards burakumin, however, the term burakumin is still recognized as a discriminating word while there are certain amount of recent young generations who do not even know the term and idea of burakumin. Also, in some cases, people still happen to be discriminated against, especially when they get a job or get married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saito (齋藤）|first1=Naoko(直子)|title=部落出身者と結婚差別|website=http://synodos.jp/society/10900}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cases often reported as problems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3477">'''Self-executing rights''' in [[international human rights law]] are rights that are formulated in such a way that one can deduce that it was the purpose to create international laws that citizens can invoke directly in their national courts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pieter Kooijmans]], Internationaal publiekrecht in vogelvlucht, Wolters-Noordhoff, Groningen, 1994, p. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt; Self-executing rights, or directly applicable rights, are rights which, from the viewpoint of [[international law]], do not require transformation into national law. They are binding as such and national judges can apply them as such, as if they were national rules. From the viewpoint of national law, it may be required that all international law be incorporated into national law before becoming valid. This depends on the national legal tradition.

In order to decide whether a rule is self-executing or not, one must only look at the rule in question. National traditions do not count. A rule that says that states should guarantee [[freedom of expression]] to its citizens is self-executing.{{fact|date=January 2015}} A rule that says that states should take all the necessary measures to create enough [[employment]] is not.{{fact|date=January 2015}} Non-self-executing rules of international law only impose the obligation on states to take measures and to create or alter legislation. Citizens or national judges cannot invoke these rules (and demand employment as in the previous example) in a national court. This means that international law that is not self-executing must be transformed into national law in order to take effect.

The priority of international law remains a fact whether this law is or is not self-executing. A state cannot invoke its national law as a reason not to respect its international obligations. In case of non-self-executing rules, it is obliged to change its national law or to take certain measures. It violates international law if it does not do so.&lt;ref&gt;"[T]he general principle of international law is that a state cannot plead a rule or a gap in its own municipal law as a defence to a claim based on international law", M. Akehurst, A Modern Introduction to International Law, London: Harper Collins, 1991, p. 43. "The fact that a conflicting domestic provision is contained in the national constitution does not absolve the State Party concerned from international responsibility", A. Rosas, in D. Beetham, Politics and Human Rights, Oxford: Blackwell, 1995, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, a national judge can only decide that their state should modify national law or take certain measures. They cannot invalidate national law that contradicts non-self-executing international law. They can only declare national law null and void if it contradicts self-executing international rights.

Most human rights contained in the main human rights treaties are self-executing and can be invoked by individuals in a national courtroom,&lt;ref&gt;Art. 1 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECPHR) states that "The High Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of this Convention", which means that the rights are self-executing and do not need further legal transformation.&lt;/ref&gt; although this is the case more for civil rights than for economic and social rights.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6591">A '''self-validating reduction''' is kind of [[self-fulfilling prophecy]] of which the result is a dramatic reduction in a person, group, or natural being. This term was coined by [[Anthony Weston]] and used in his book ''Back to Earth'' in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Weston, Anthony (1994). ''Back to Earth: Tomorrow's Environmentalism''. Philadelphia: Temple University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Weston's work, Bob Jickling, et al. in ''Environmental Education, Ethics, and Action'' (United Nations Education Program ([[UNEP]]), 2006) wrote: 
:A self-validating reduction is a self-fulfilling prophecy in which one of the main effects of the "prophecy" is to reduce someone or something in the world. It acts to make that person or thing less than they, or it, are or could be; or it diminishes some part of the world’s richness, depth and promise. And, this reduction in turn feeds back, not only to justify the original "prophecy" but also to perpetuate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jickling, B., Lotz-Sisitka, H., O’Donoghue, R., Ogbuigwe. A. (2006)|title=''Environmental Education, Ethics, and Action''|url= http://cjee.lakeheadu.ca/public/journals/22/Ethics_book_english.pdf |publisher=United Nations Education Program (UNEP)|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition and examples ==

According to [[Thomas Schelling]]’s classic (1978) treatment, the term “self-fulfilling prophecy” originally referred to a process in which a negative but quite possibly baseless expectation or prediction generates a [[feedback loop]] that ends by producing exactly the expected negative result: the diminution or defeat of something originally stable and seemingly solid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schelling|first=Thomas|title=Micromotives and Macrobehavior|year=1978|publisher=W W Norton and Company|location=New York|pages=115–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The standard example is a run on an initially solvent bank that can accelerate into a panic and drive the bank into bankruptcy simply because very few banks, however well-managed, can cash out large numbers of depositors upon unexpected demand. The term has since broadened greatly, however, to include any self-augmenting expectation, prediction, or disposition, many of which can also have positive effects. High self-esteem, however ill-founded, may produce more confident and capable acts, hence "fulfilling" itself. Other interpersonal expectations such as predictions of student success, initially quite baseless, can produce student success through subtly altering the expectations of their teachers.

A 1996 article by philosopher [[Anthony Weston]] refocused on part of what Schelling described as the original denotation of “self-fulfilling prophecy” using the more specific term “self-validating reduction”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weston|first=Anthony|title=Self-validating reduction: A theory of environmental devaluation|journal=Environmental Ethics|year=1996|volume=18|pages=115–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "reduction" is an actual change – some kind of deprivation, loss, or diminution – not merely a "prophecy" in the sense of an attitude change in another person or society at large; and a change that comes to justify or "validate"  a changed judgment of the person changed or reduced, specifically by ignoring the actual cause of the reduction and attributing it instead to the essential character of the reduced person(s) instead. 

For example, the abolitionist [[Frederick Douglass]] pointed out that

: Ignorance and depravity, and the inability to arise from degradation to civilization and respectability, are the most usual allegations against the oppressed. The evils most fostered by slavery and oppression are precisely those which slaveholders and oppressors would transfer from their system to the inherent character of their victims. Thus the very crimes of slavery become slavery’s best defense. By making the enslaved a character fit only for slavery, they excuse themselves for failing to make the slave a freeman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Douglass|first=Frederick|title=The Claims of the Negro Ethnologically Considered|journal=The Frederick Douglass Papers|year=1982|volume=2|series=Series One|pages=507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among many other possible examples are the Nazi concentration camps, designed to destroy the inmates' very humanity and thus to validate the Nazis’ prejudices and make systematic murder possible; and the ways in which prejudiced persons, convinced of (say) a co-worker's incapacity or inequality, are likely to reduce their co-workers to uncooperative antagonists: missing their own contribution to the process, they will then naturally conclude that their co-workers – not themselves – are incapable of good work.

== Other animals and nature ==

Self-validating reduction applies beyond the human sphere as well.  For example, wild animals who were not originally hostile or wary become that way upon being hunted. Scientific research on other animals that tends to avoid calling on their social instincts, in the name of objectivity, may in fact drive them away and actually induce an avoidance of humans that then is taken to be an objective and independent fact about them. Highly confined and managed animals under "[[factory farming]]" can be reduced to a state of social and physical dysfunction that seems to be their "inherent character", as Douglass puts it, thus making their treatment less morally troubling, and thereby making them more available for further reduction in turn.

The ecological critic [[Paul Shepard]] noted that land can be reduced in self-validating ways as well, as when Isaiah commands Israel to “tear down the [pagan] altars, break their images, cut down their groves” -– so that it ''becomes'' true, as it may not have been initially, that only the other world, beyond nature, is truly sacred.  Shepard called this kind of self-validating reduction “the evangelical desacralizing of place”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shepard|first=Paul|title=Nature and Madness|year=1982|publisher=Sierra Club Books|location=San Francisco|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Forced Sterilization of Indigenous women''' is an issue affecting both [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[First Nations]] women. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous women]] have been sterilized without informed consent, or coerced into consenting to medical procedures;&lt;ref name=Volscho&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Volscho|first1=Thomas|title=Sterilization Racism and Pan-Ethnic Disparities of the Past Decade: The Continued Encroachment on Reproductive Rights|journal=Wicazo Sa Review|volume=25|issue=1|pages=17–31|doi=10.1353/wic.0.0053}}&lt;/ref&gt; this has been done when they were unconscious from sedation, or during the stress of childbirth.&lt;ref name=CBC-11-13-18&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-november-13-2018-1.4902679/indigenous-women-kept-from-seeing-their-newborn-babies-until-agreeing-to-sterilization-says-lawyer-1.4902693|title=Indigenous women kept from seeing their newborn babies until agreeing to sterilization, says lawyerlast=|first=|date=|website=[[CBC Radio]]|archive-url=|archive-date=13 Nov 2018|dead-url=|access-date=14 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s, the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA), through the federally-funded [[Indian Health Service]] (IHS), covertly imposed a policy of involuntary surgical sterilization upon Native American women in the United States.&lt;ref name=ForcedSterilization&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/6242/Forced-Sterilization-of-Native-Americans.html|title=Forced Sterilization of Native Americans|last=|first=|date=|website=Encylopedia JRank|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy was only revealed when members of the [[American Indian Movement]] occupied the offices of the BIA in 1972.&lt;ref name=ForcedSterilization/&gt;&lt;ref name=Volscho /&gt; The U.S. General Accounting Office found that the Indian Health Service sterilized 3,406 Native American women between 1973 and 1976. The study showed that 36 women under age 21 were forcibly sterilized regardless of a court-ordered moratorium on sterilizations of women younger than 21.&lt;ref name=NV&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/nativevoices/timeline/543.html|title=Native Voices|last=|first=|date=|website=NLM|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GAO&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[Government Accountability Office]] | title= Investigation of Allegations Concerning Indian Health Service | url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/120/117355.pdf | access-date=May 29, 2015 | date=November 4, 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; One out of four Native American women were involuntarily sterilized through [[tubal ligation]] or [[hysterectomy]].&lt;ref name=MRL&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ralstin-Lewis|first1=D. Marie|title=The Continuing Struggle against Genocide: Indigenous Women's Reproductive Rights|journal=Wicazo Sa Review|date=2005|volume=20|issue=2|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure was often done under the pretense of a check up or abortion and most individuals were not aware they had been sterilized. In the 1970s, the average [[birth rate]] of Native American women was 3.7 however, in 1980 it fell to 1.8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawrence|first1=Jane|title=The Sterilization of Native American Women|journal=American Indian Quarterly|volume=24|issue=3|page=402|date = 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, forced and coerced sterilizations are alleged to have happened as recently as 2017. In November, 2018, it was announced that over 60 Indigenous women are pursuing a class-action lawsuit alleging they underwent forced or coerced sterilizations over the past 20 to 25 years in [[Saskatchewan]], in which they were not allowed contact with their newborns until they signed forms "consenting" to tubal ligations.&lt;ref name=CBC-11-13-18 /&gt;

== Types of sterilization ==
In the 1970s, after being forced onto [[Indian reservation|reservations]] by the United States government, or [[Indian Relocation Act of 1956|relocated into urban areas]] without adequate support, many Native Americans were struggling with [[poverty]]. The [[Indian Health Service]] (IHS) was their main health provider. A common sterilization procedure was the [[hysterectomy]], a form of permanent sterilization in which the [[uterus]] is removed through the patient's [[abdomen]] or [[vagina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sterilization Abuse: A Proposed Regulatory Scheme|journal=DePaul Law Review|volume=28|issue=3|page=734|last1=Kelly|first1=Mary E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hysterectomies were often performed on Native American women by [[Residency (medicine)|residents]] without the patient's knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peal|first1=Tiesha|title=The Continuing Sterilization of Undesirables in America|journal=Rutgers Race and the Law Review|date=2004|volume=6|issue=1|page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common form of sterilization was tubal ligation, a sterilization procedure in which a woman's [[fallopian tubes]] are tied, blocked, or cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carpio|first1=Myla |title=The Lost Generation: American Indian and Sterilization Abuse|journal=Social Justice|date=2004|volume=31|issue=4|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quinacrine]] was also used to sterilize Native American women.  Quinacrine is commonly used to treat [[malaria]], but can also be used for non-surgical sterilization. Capsules inserted into the uterus spread and destroy the lining of the Fallopian tubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ralstin-Lewis|first1=D. Marie|title=The Continuing Struggles against Genocide: Indigenous Women's Reproductive Rights|journal=Wicazo Sa Review|date=2005|volume=20|issue=1|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-permanent forms of sterilization were also used including [[Depo-Provera]] and [[Norplant]]. Depo-Provera was used mainly on [[intellectually disabled]] Native American women before it gained clearance from the FDA in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=4140251|title=The Continuing Struggle against Genocide: Indigenous Women's Reproductive Rights|last=Ralston-Lewis|first=D. Marie|date=|publisher=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norplant, promoted by the IHS, was marketed by [[Wyeth Pharmaceuticals]] (who were sued over insufficient disclosure of side effects including irregular menstrual bleeding, headaches, nausea and depression). Side effects of these two types of sterilization included the cessation of the menstrual cycle and excessive bleeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ralstin-Lewis|first1=D. Marie|title=The Continuing Struggle against Genocide: Indigenous Women's Reproductive Rights|journal=Wicazo Sa Review|date=2005|volume=20|issue=1|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using 2002 data from the [[National Survey of Family Growth]], the Urban Indian Health Institute found that among women using contraception, the most common methods used by urban American Indian and Alaskan Native women age 15–44 years were female sterilization (34%), oral contraceptive pills (21%), and male condoms (21%). However among the urban Non-Hispanic Whites, the most common methods were oral contraceptive pills 36%),  female sterilization (20%) and male condoms (18%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Urban Indian Health Institute, Seattle Indian Health Board.| title=Reproductive Health of Urban American Indian and Alaska Native Women: Examining Unintended Pregnancy, Contraception, Sexual History and Behavior, and Non-Voluntary Sexual Intercourse. | date=2010| access-date=June 14, 2016 |page=23 | url=http://mchb.hrsa.gov/research/documents/finalreports/forquera_r40_mc_08954_final_report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Excuses for sterilization ==
[[Racism]] and harmful [[stereotypes]] of the Native American population, held by members of the dominant culture, were factors that made Native American women targets for sterilization. The media commonly referred to Native American women by misogynist, racist [[Pejorative|slurs]] such as "[[squaw]]",&lt;ref name=Volscho/&gt; defined as a "dirty, subservient, abused, alcoholic and ugly woman who loves to torture white men."&lt;ref name=Volscho/&gt; Negative racial stereotypes propagated the belief among the dominant culture that Native American women were unfit to raise or to have children in comparison to white women.&lt;ref name=Volscho/&gt; First Nations women who have given birth in white hospitals have been coerced into being sterilized against their will; often being told it was mandatory before seeing their babies,&lt;ref name=CBC-11-13-18 /&gt; or being lied to that it was a requirement of the delivery process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kelly|first1=Mary E.|title=Sterilization Abuse: A Proposed Regulatory Scheme|journal=De Paul Law Review|date=1979|volume=28|issue=3|page=733}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not agreeing to the sterilization procedure would result in the withdrawal of [[welfare]] benefits. Consent forms presented to them failed to indicate that the decision would affect their ability to bear children in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawrence|first1=Jane|title=The Indian Health Service and the Sterilization of Native American Women|journal=American Indian Quarterly|date=2000|volume=24|issue=3|page=409}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Studies by the [[Health Research Group]] in 1973 and [[Doctor Bernard Rosenfeld]]'s interviews in 1974 and 1975 show that this action was driven by social and economic factors.&lt;ref name="Lawrence"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawrence|first1=Jane|title=The Indian Health Service and the Sterilization of Native American Women|journal=American Indian Quarterly|date=2000|volume=24|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the white physicians performing this procedure viewed sterilization as the best alternative for these women. They claimed it would improve their financial situation and their family's quality of life.&lt;ref name="Carpio"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carpio|first1=Myla|title=The Lost Generation: American Indian and Sterilization Abuse|journal=Social Justice|date=2004|volume=31|issue=4|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physicians were paid more for performing hysterectomies and tubal ligations than for prescribing other forms of birth control.&lt;ref name="Lawrence" /&gt; The influx of surgical procedures was seen as a training for physicians and as a practice for resident physicians. In 1971, Dr. James Ryan stated that he favored hysterectomies over tubal ligations because "it's more of a challenge...and it's good experience for the junior resident".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peal|first1=Tiesha|title=The Continuing Sterilization of the Undesirables in America|journal=Rutgers Race and the Law Review|volume=6|issue=1|page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; With fewer people applying for Medicaid and welfare, the federal government could decrease spending on welfare programs.&lt;ref name="Lawrence" /&gt;

In the 1970s, the negative stereotypes of Native American women held by members of the dominant culture, along with racist beliefs of white superiority, contributed to the belief among white physicians that these women would not be able to limit the number of children or use birth control effectively. These factors all contributed to the sterilization policy.&lt;ref name="Lawrence" /&gt;

==IHS regulations==
The [[Indian Health Service]] (IHS) continues to offer sterilization as a method of family planning.  Tubal ligation and vasectomy are the only procedures which may be performed for the primary purpose of sterilization. Legally, the IHS requires for the patient to give informed consent to the operation, be 21 years of age or older, and not be institutionalized in a correctional or mental health facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Indian Health Service  | title=Indian Health Manual § 3-13.12(F)(5) | url=http://www.ihs.gov/IHM/index.cfm?module=dsp_ihm_pc_p3c13#3-13.12F5 | access-date=June 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A change to the structure, organization or policies in that system could alleviate the systemic problem. On an [[Ishikawa diagram]] (fishbone diagram) of cause-and-effect links, the source of the problem can be said to be a [[common cause]], rather than a [[special cause]].

'''Tarksheel Society''' (Rationalist Society) is a [[rationalist]] group based in [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]], [[India]].

==The beginning==

Founded in 1984 under the leadership of [[Megh Raj Mitter]]&lt;ref name="Ohmy"&gt;{{Citation | url=http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?at_code=328911  | title=Man With a Mission: Indian teaches science to locals to overcome superstitions | author=Nagar, Munish | newspaper=[[OhmyNews]] | date=8 May 2006 | accessdate=18 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp; [[Sarjit Talwar]]. Tarksheel Society aims to disseminate [[rationalist]] ideas and scientific temper among the Indian people in order to eradicate [[religious fanaticism]], [[communalism]], [[caste system]], [[untouchability]] and [[superstitions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Bhoot hai, say villagers, cops find no clue - Members of Tarksheel Society are educating residents too | url=http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=96979 | work=expressindia.com | publisher=[[The Indian Express]] | date=25 August 2004 | accessdate=18 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Bhoot talk continues in village - Tarksheel member gets a ghost call. | url=http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=97271 | work=expressindia.com | publisher=[[The Indian Express]] | date=27 August 2004 | accessdate=18 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Affiliated to [[Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations]],&lt;ref name="FIRA"&gt;{{Citation | title= National Conference to fight communalisation. | url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-20934922_ITM | newspaper=[[The Times of India]] | date=6 April 2004 | accessdate=18 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarksheel Society advocates the separation of religion and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Separation of religion and politics demanded. | url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-20888777_ITM | author=Garg, Balwant | newspaper=[[The Times of India]] | date=1 April 2004 | accessdate=18 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The society has units in almost all the villages and towns of Punjab.

Though mainly confined to the state of Punjab, the Society now operates in the neighboring states of [[Haryana]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Delhi]], [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Madhya Pradesh]] and [[Jammu and Kashmir]] also. Due to its high South-Asian population, the Society is also active in three major cities in Canada: Vancouver, Calgary and Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Tarksheel Society in Canada. | url=http://www.tarksheel.com/page.php?aid=13&amp;pn=Tarksheel_Society_in_Canada | author=Tarksheel Society | accessdate=11 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaigns==

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Firewalking.jpg|thumb|150px| [[Fire_walking]] by a volunteer of Tarksheel Society : Courtesy: http://www.tarksheel.com/]] --&gt;

To accomplish its mission, the society organizes public meetings, conferences, study camps, seminars and publishes rationalist literature. The society undertakes campaigns to expose the so-called [[miracle]]s and charlatanry of [[Godman (Hindu ascetic)|godmen]] who claim [[supernatural]] powers.&lt;ref name="Ohmy"/&gt; Towards this the Society has announced a cash award of rupees five lakh (US$8,000) for anybody who demonstrates supernatural powers or miracles under fraud-proof conditions. The Society has so far published about 50 books in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and [[Hindi]] on rationalism and science to inculcate scientific temper among people.

In 2004 Tarksheel organized the three-day national conference for Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations.&lt;ref name="FIRA"/&gt;

==Periodicals==

First book of the society was 'Te Dev Pursh Har Gaye' original author Dr. T. Kapoor was translated in Punjabi by Sarjit Talwar &amp; Meghraj Mitter. The society publishes its own journals in Punjabi and Hindi. ''Tarak Bodh'' (Logical Cognition) and ''Taraksheel'' (Rationalist) are brought out in Punjabi and ''Tarak Jyoti'' (Logical Enlightenment) in Hindi.

'''Tatramajjhattatā''' (Pali) is a [[Buddhist]] term that is translated as "equanimity", "neutrality of mind", etc. In the Theravada tradition, it is defined as a mental attitude of balance, detachment, and impartiality.&lt;ref name=bodhi1&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hxopJgv85y4C&amp;q=neutrality+mind#v=snippet&amp;q=neutrality%20mind&amp;f=false Bhikkhu Bodhi (2003), pp. 86]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tatramajjhattatā is identified as:
* One of the [[Mental_factors_(Buddhism)#Twenty-five beautiful mental factors|twenty-five beautiful mental factors]] within the Theravada Abhidharma teachings
* A synonym of [[upekkha]]

==Explanations==

===Theravada===
Bhikkhu Bodhi explains:
:The Pali term for this cetisaka literally means "there in the middleness." It is a synonym for equanimity ([[upekkha]]), not as neutral feeling, but as a mental attitude of balance, detachment, and impartiality. It has the characteristic of conveying consciousness and the mental factors evenly. Its function is to prevent deficiency and excess, or to prevent partiality. It is manifested as neutrality. It should be seen as the state of looking on with equanimity in the citta and cetasikas, like a charioteer who looks on with equanimity at the thoroughbreds progressing evenly along the roadway.&lt;ref name=bodhi1/&gt;

The [[Visuddhimagga]] (XIV, 153) states about equanimity:
: It has the characteristic of conveying citta and cetasikas evenly. Its function is to prevent deficiency and excess, or its function is to inhibit partiality. It is manifested as neutrality. It should be regarded as like a conductor (driver) who looks on with equanimity on thoroughbreds progressing evenly.&lt;ref name=gorkom1&gt;Gorkom (2010), [http://www.zolag.co.uk/Cetasikas/html_node/Equanimity.html#Equanimity Definition of Tatramajjhattatā ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nina van Gorkom explains:
:When there is equanimity there is neither elation nor depression. The object which is experienced is viewed with impartiality and neutrality, just as a charioteer treats with impartiality his well-trained horses. Equanimity effects the balance of the citta and the other cetasikas it arises together with. There is no balance of mind when akusala citta arises, when we are cross, greedy, avaricious or ignorant. Whereas when we are generous, observe morality (sīla), develop calm or develop right understanding of nāma and rūpa, there is balance of mind.&lt;ref name=gorkom1/&gt;

'''''The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values''''' is a book by [[Sam Harris]] published in 2010. In it, he promotes a [[science of morality]] and argues that many thinkers have long confused the relationship between morality, facts, and science. He aims to carve a third path between secularists who say morality is subjective (e.g. [[ethical relativism|moral relativists]]), and religionists who say that morality is given by God and scripture. Harris contends that the only moral framework worth talking about is one where "morally good" things pertain to increases in the "well-being of conscious creatures". He then argues that, problems with philosophy of science and reason in general notwithstanding, 'moral questions' will have objectively right and wrong answers which are grounded in empirical facts about what causes people to flourish.

Challenging the traditional philosophical notion that humans can never get an 'ought' from an 'is' (the so called [[Hume's law]]), Harris argues that moral questions are best pursued using not just philosophy, but the [[scientific method|methods of science]]. Thus, "science can determine human values" translates to "science can tell us which values lead to human flourishing". It is in this sense that Harris advocates that scientists begin conversations about a normative science of "morality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samharris.org/ |title=Sam Harris |publisher=Sam Harris |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
{{Primary sources|synopsis|date=August 2012}}
Sam Harris's case starts with two premises: "(1) some people have better lives than others, and (2) these differences are related, in some lawful and not entirely arbitrary way, to states of the human brain and to states of the world".&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that a person is simply describing material facts (many about their brain) when they describe possible "better" and "worse" lives for themselves. Granting this, Harris says we must conclude that there are facts about which courses of action will allow one to pursue a better life.

Harris attests to the importance of admitting that such facts exist, because he says this logic applies to groups of individuals as well. He suggests that there are better and worse ways for whole societies to pursue better lives. Just like at the scale of the individual, there may be multiple different paths and "peaks" to flourishing for societies - and many more ways to fail.

Harris then makes a case that science could usefully define "morality" according to such facts (about people's wellbeing). Often his arguments point out that problems with this scientific definition of morality seem to be problems shared by all science, or reason and words in general. Harris also spends some time describing how science might engage nuances and challenges of identifying the best ways for individuals, and groups of individuals, to improve their lives. Many of these issues are covered below.

===Philosophical case===
[[File:Researchers using Niskin bottle to collect water sample · DN-SD-01-00282.JPEG|thumb|right|Harris says science requires that one acknowledge certain values (e.g. curiosity)]]Although Harris's book discusses the challenges that a [[science of morality]] must face, he also mentions that his scientific argument is indeed [[Philosophy of science|philosophical]]. Furthermore, he says that this is the case for almost all scientific investigation. He mentions that modern science amounts to careful practice of accepted [[first principles|first philosophical principles]] like [[empiricism]] and [[physicalism]].&lt;ref name="The Moral Landscape, pg. 180"&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 180&lt;/ref&gt; He also suggests that science has already very much settled on ''values'' in answering the question "what should I believe, and why should I believe it?".&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 144&lt;/ref&gt; Harris says it should not be surprising that normative ethical sciences are, or would be, similarly founded on bedrock assumptions ([[Basic norm]]s). Harris says:

{{quote|...science is often a matter of philosophy in practice. It is probably worth recalling that the original name for the physical sciences was, in fact, 'natural philosophy'... One could call [my proposal in ''The Moral Landscape''] a 'philosophical' position, but it is one that directly relates to the boundaries of science.&lt;ref name="The Moral Landscape, pg. 180"/&gt;}}

The way he thinks science might engage moral issues draws on various philosophical positions like [[ethical realism]] (there are facts worth calling 'moral facts'), and [[ethical naturalism]] (these facts relate to the physical world). Harris says a [[science of morality]] may resemble [[Utilitarianism]], but that the science is, importantly, more open-ended because it involves an evolving definition of well-being. Rather than committing to [[Reductive materialism]], then, Harris recognizes the arguments of [[Revisionary materialism|revisionists]] that psychological definitions themselves are contingent on research and discoveries. Harris adds that any science of morality must consider everything from emotions and thoughts to the actual actions and their consequences.&lt;ref name=EdgeHarris&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/morality10/morality10_index.html |title=The New Science Of Morality |publisher=Edge |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To Harris, moral propositions, and explicit values in general, are concerned with the flourishing of conscious creatures in a society.&lt;ref name=tedharris&gt;{{cite web|author=TED2010 |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/sam_harris_science_can_show_what_s_right.html |title=Sam Harris: Science can answer moral questions &amp;#124; Video on |publisher=Ted.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that "Social morality exists to sustain cooperative social relationships, and morality can be objectively evaluated by that standard."&lt;ref name=HarrisCFI1&gt;{{cite web|author=Washington, D.C. |url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blogs/entry/video_of_sam_harris_talking_the_moral_landscape_in_nyc/ |title=Sam Harris Talks "The Moral Landscape" in NYC |publisher=Center for Inquiry |date=2010-10-13 |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris sees some philosophers' talk of strictly ''private'' morality as akin to unproductive discussion of some private, personal physics. "If philosophers want to only talk about some bizarrely unnatural private morality, they are just changing the subject..."&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris also discusses how [[veil of ignorance|interchangeability of perspective]] might emerge as an important part of moral reasoning. He alludes to an 'unpleasant surprise principle', where someone realizes they have been supporting an ineffective moral norm (e.g. reported cases of Jew-hunting Nazis discovering that they themselves were of Jewish descent).&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science and moral truths===
Harris identifies three projects for science as it relates to morality: (1) explaining why humans do what they do in the name of "morality" (e.g. traditional [[evolutionary psychology]]), (2) determining which patterns of thought and behaviour humans actually ''should'' follow (i.e. the [[science of morality]]), and (3) generally persuading humans to change their ways.&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Harris says that the first project is focused only on describing what is, whereas projects (2) and (3) are focused on what should and could be, respectively. Harris's point is that this second, prescriptive project should be the focus of a [[science of morality]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 42&lt;/ref&gt; He mentions, however, that we should not fear an "Orwellian future" with scientists at every door - vital progress in the science of morality could be shared in much the same way as advances in medicine.&lt;ref name=SalonHarris&gt;{{cite web|last=Don |first=Katherine |url=http://www.salon.com/books/feature/2010/10/17/sam_harris_interview/ |title="The Moral Landscape": Why science should shape morality |publisher=Salon.com |date=2010-10-17 |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris says it is important to delineate project (1) from project (2), or else we risk committing a [[moralistic fallacy]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 101&lt;/ref&gt; He also highlights the importance of distinguishing between project (2) (asking what is right) from project (3) (trying to change behaviour). He says we must realize that the nuances of human motivation is a challenge in itself; humans often fail to do what they "ought" to do even to be successfully selfish - there is every reason to believe that discovering what is best for society would not change every member's habits overnight.&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris does not imagine that people, even scientists, have always made the right moral decisions—indeed it is precisely his argument that many of them are wrong about moral facts.&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 42-44&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the many real challenges of good science in general, including human cognitive limitations and biases (e.g. [[loss aversion]] can sway human decisions on important issues like medicine). He mentions [[psychic numbing#Paul Slovic|the research of Paul Slovic]] and others to describe just a few of these established mental [[heuristics]] that might keep us from reasoning properly.&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Although he mentions that training might temper the influence of these biases, Harris worries about research showing that incompetence and ignorance in a domain leads to confidence (the [[Dunning–Kruger effect]]).&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris explains that debates and disagreement are a part of the [[scientific method]], and that one side can certainly be wrong.&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 88&lt;/ref&gt; He also explains that all the debates still available to science illustrate how much work could still be done, and how much conversation must continue.&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harris's positive beliefs===
The book is full of issues that Harris thinks are far from being empirically, morally grey areas. That is, besides saying that 'reasonable' thinking about moral issues amounts to scientific thinking. For instance, he references one poll that found that 36 percent of British Muslims think apostates should be put to death for their unbelief,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-432075/Multiculturalism-drives-young-Muslims-shun-British-values.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Multiculturalism 'drives young Muslims to shun British values' | date=2007-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he says that these individuals are "morally confused".&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 90&lt;/ref&gt; He also suggests it is obvious that loneliness, helplessness, and poverty are "bad", but that these are by no means as far as [[positive psychology]] has taken, and will take us.&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

In one section, called ''The illusion of free will'', Harris argues that there is a wealth of evidence in [[psychology]] (e.g. the [[illusion of introspection]]) or specifically related to the [[neuroscience of free will]] that suggests that metaphysically free will does not exist. This, he thinks, is intuitive; "trains of thought...convey the apparent reality of choices, freely made. But from a deeper perspective...thoughts simply arise (what else could they do?)".&lt;ref name="The Moral Landscape, pg. 105"&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 105&lt;/ref&gt; He adds "The illusion of free will is itself an illusion".&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 112&lt;/ref&gt; The implications of free will's non-existence may be a working determinism, and Harris warns us not to confuse this with [[fatalism]].&lt;ref name="The Moral Landscape, pg. 105"/&gt;

One implication of a determined will, Harris says, is that it becomes unreasonable to punish people out of retribution—only behaviour modification and the deterrence of others still seem to be potentially valid reasons to punish.&lt;ref name="The Moral Landscape, pg. 109"&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 109&lt;/ref&gt; This, especially because behaviour modification is a sort of cure for the evil behaviours; Harris provides a thought experiment: {{quote|Consider what would happen if we discovered a cure for human evil. Imagine, for the sake of argument...the cure for psychopathy can be put directly into the food supply like vitamin D...consider, for instance, the prospect of withholding the cure for evil from a murderer as part of his punishment. Would this make any moral sense at all?&lt;ref name="The Moral Landscape, pg. 109"/&gt;}}

Harris acknowledges a hierarchy of moral consideration (e.g. humans are more important than bacteria or mice). He says it follows that there could, in principle, be a species compared to which we are relatively unimportant (although he doubts such a species exists).&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris supports the development of lie-detection technology and believes it would be, on the whole, beneficial for humanity. He also supports the formation of an explicit global civilization because of the potential for stability under a [[world government]].&lt;ref name="SalonHarris"/&gt;

====Religion: good or bad?====
Consistent with Harris's definition of morality, he says we must ask whether religion increases human flourishing today (regardless of whether it increased it in the distant past).&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 148&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that religions may largely be practiced because they fit well with human cognitive tendencies (e.g. [[animism]]).&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 150&lt;/ref&gt;
In Harris's view, religion and religious dogma is an impediment to reason, and he discusses the views of [[Francis Collins]] as one example.

Harris criticizes the tactics of secularists like [[Chris Mooney (journalist)|Chris Mooney]], who argue that science is not fundamentally (and certainly not superficially) in conflict with religion. Harris sees this as a very serious disagreement, that patronizingly attempts to pacify more devout theists.&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Harris claims that societies can move away from deep dependence on religion just as it has from witchcraft, which he says was once just as deeply ingrained.&lt;ref name="SalonHarris"/&gt;

==Promotion==

In advance of publication, four personal and professional acquaintances of the author,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example,[http://www.samharris.org/site/full_text/god-and-science-dont-mix1/L. Krauss, "God and Science Don't Mix"], ''The Wall Street Journal''(describing Harris and Dawkins as his "friends") (accessed on Harris's personal website, Nov. 7, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; biologist and science popularizer [[Richard Dawkins]], novelist [[Ian McEwan]], psycholinguist [[Steven Pinker]], and theoretical physicist [[Lawrence Krauss]], offered their praise for the book. They each serve on the Advisory Board of Harris's [[Project Reason]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.project-reason.org/about/advisory_board/ |title=Project Reason Advisory Board |publisher=Project-reason.org |date=1989-02-14 |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their praise appears as [[blurb]]s (released by the book's publisher on Harris's website and reproduced on the book's [[dust jacket]]).&lt;ref name="blurb"&gt;{{cite web|author=Tweet &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; |url=http://www.samharris.org/site/full_text/the-moral-landscape/ |title=www.samharris.org |publisher=www.samharris.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dawkins said,
{{quote|I was one of those who had unthinkingly bought into the hectoring myth that science can say nothing about morals. To my surprise, The Moral Landscape has changed all that for me. It should change it for philosophers too. Philosophers of mind have already discovered that they can't duck the study of neuroscience, and the best of them have raised their game as a result...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values |url=https://www.amazon.com/Moral-Landscape-Science-Determine-Values/dp/1439171211 |title=The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values (9781439171219): Sam Harris: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

McEwan wrote that "Harris breathes intellectual fire into an ancient debate. Reading this thrilling, audacious book, you feel the ground shifting beneath your feet. Reason has never had a more passionate advocate."&lt;ref name="blurb"/&gt; Pinker said that Harris offers "a tremendously appealing vision, and one that no thinking person can afford to ignore."&lt;ref name="blurb"/&gt; Krauss opined that Harris "has the rare ability to frame arguments that are not only stimulating, they are downright nourishing, even if you don't always agree with him!"&lt;ref name="blurb"/&gt;  Krauss predicted that "readers are bound to come away with previously firm convictions about the world challenged, and a vital new awareness about the nature and value of science and reason in our lives."&lt;ref name="blurb"/&gt;

===Reviews===
[[Eastern Connecticut State University|ECSU]] Associate Professor of Philosophy James W. Diller&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Gate|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/James_Diller/publications|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Andrew E. Nuzzolilli wrote a generally favorable review in a journal of the [[Association for Behavior Analysis International]]:

{{quote|The Moral Landscape represents an important contribution to a scientific discussion of morality. It explicates the determinants of moral behavior for a popular audience, placing causality in the external environment and in the organism's correlated neurological states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="The Science of Values: The Moral Landscape by Sam Harris" - US National Library of Medicine  National Institutes of Health|pmc=3501430}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his review for [[Barnes &amp; Noble]], [[California State University|Cal State]] Associate Professor of Philosophy Troy Jollimore wrote that the book "has some good, reasonable, and at times persuasive things to say" to people who are unfamiliar with [[moral skepticism]], but "has little to say to those people who actually do know what the arguments are, and it will not help others become much better informed." Jollimore also worried that Harris wrongly presents complex issues as having simple solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bnreview.barnesandnoble.com/t5/Reviews-Essays/The-Moral-Landscape/ba-p/3477T. Jollimore, ''Barnes &amp; Noble Review''], Oct. 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kwame Anthony Appiah]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' "when [Harris] stays closest to neuroscience, he says much that is interesting and important...".&lt;ref name=Times&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/books/review/Appiah-t.html K.A. Appiah, "Science Knows Best"], ''The New York Times'', Oct. 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He later criticized Harris for failing to articulate "his central claim" and to identify how science has "revealed" that human well-being has an objective component.&lt;ref name= Times/&gt;  Appiah argued that Harris "ends up endorsing ... something very like [[utilitarianism]], a philosophical position that is now more than two centuries old, ... that faces a battery of familiar problems," which Harris merely "push[es] ... aside."&lt;ref name= Times/&gt; Harris responded to Appiah in the afterword of the paperback version, writing that  all of Appiah's criticisms had already been addressed in the chapter "Good and Evil".

Cognitive scientist and anthropologist [[Scott Atran]] criticized Harris for failing to engage with the philosophical literature on ethics and the problems in attempting to scientifically quantify human well being, noting that
{{quote|Nobel Prize–winner Daniel Kahneman studies what gives Americans pleasure—watching TV, talking to friends, having sex—and what makes them unhappy—commuting, working, looking after their children.

Critiquing the book, [[Kenan Malik]] wrote:

{{quote|Imagine a sociologist who wrote about evolutionary theory without discussing the work of Darwin, Fisher, Mayr, Hamilton, Trivers or Dawkins on the grounds that he did not come to his conclusions by reading about biology and because discussing concepts such as "adaptation", "speciation", "homology", "phylogenetics" or "kin selection" would "increase the amount of boredom in the universe". How seriously would we, and should we, take his argument?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Malik|first=Kenan|title=Test tube truths|accessdate=12 November 2011|newspaper=New Humanist|page=26|date=May–June 2011|url=http://newhumanist.org.uk/2538/test-tube-truths}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

American novelist [[Marilynne Robinson]], writing in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', asserted that Harris fails to "articulate a positive morality of his own" but, had he done so, would have found himself in the company of the "[[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], busily cooperating on schemes to enhance the world's well being, as they have been doing for generations."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703882404575520062380030080 M. Robinson, "What Unitarians Know (and Sam Harris Doesn't)"], ''The Wall Street Journal'', Oct. 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

David Sexton of the London Evening Standard described Harris's claim to provide a science of morality as“the most extraordinarily overweening claim and evidently flawed. Science does not generate its own moral values; it can be used for good or ill and has been. Harris cannot stand outside culture, and the 'better future' he prophesies is itself a cultural projection. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The King James Bible bashers|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/lifestyle/article-23938503-the-king-james-bible-bashers.do|accessdate=13 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430172150/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/lifestyle/article-23938503-the-king-james-bible-bashers.do|archivedate=30 April 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Horgan (American journalist)|John Horgan]], journalist for the ''[[Scientific American]]'' blog and author of ''The End of Science'', wrote "Harris further shows his arrogance when he claims that neuroscience, his own field, is best positioned to help us achieve a universal morality. ... Neuroscience can't even tell me how I can know the big, black, hairy thing on my couch is my dog Merlin. And we're going to trust neuroscience to tell us how we should resolve debates over the morality of abortion, euthanasia and armed intervention in other nations' affairs?"&lt;ref name="Horgan"&gt;[http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/2010/10/11/be-wary-of-the-righteous-rationalist-we-should-reject-sam-harriss-claim-that-science-can-be-a-moral-guidepost/ J. Horgan, "Be wary of the righteous rationalist: We should reject Sam Harris's claim that science can be a moral guidepost"], ''Scientific American'' blog, Oct. 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russell Blackford]] said "The Moral Landscape is an ambitious work that will gladden the hearts, and strengthen the spines, of many secular thinkers" but that he had "serious reservations about a good book".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jetpress.org/v21/blackford3.htm |title=Book review: Sam Harris’ The Moral Landscape |publisher=Jetpress.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Simon Blackburn]], reviewing the book, described Harris as "a knockabout atheist" who "joins the prodigious ranks of those whose claim to have transcended philosophy is just an instance of their doing it very badly", pointing out that "if [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]]'s hedonist is in one brain state and [[Aristotle]]'s active subject is in another, as no doubt they would be, it is a moral, not an empirical, problem to say which is to be preferred."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/2011/03/blackburn-ethics-without-god-secularism-religion-sam-harris/ Morality without God] [[Prospect magazine]] 23-Mar-2011&lt;/ref&gt;  And [[H. Allen Orr]] in the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' finds that "Despite Harris's bravado about 'how science can determine human values,' The Moral Landscape delivers nothing of the kind."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/may/12/science-right-and-wrong/?page=2 The Science of Right and Wrong] by [[H.

Steve Isaacson wrote ''Mining The Moral Landscape: Why Science Does Not (and cannot) Determine Human Values''. Isaacson concludes, "The largest objection to Harris' argument is still Moore's [[open-question argument]]. Harris dismisses the argument as a word game easily avoided, but he never explains the game nor how to avoid it. He just ignores it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mining The Moral Landscape: Why Science Does Not (and cannot) Determine Human Values |url=https://www.amazon.com/Mining-Moral-Landscape-Science-Determine/dp/1480292680 |title=Mining The Moral Landscape: Why Science Does Not (and cannot) Determine Human Values (978-1480292680): Steve Isaacson: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-20}}, page 38&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Moving Naturalism Forward workshop, [[Nobel Prize]] winning physicist [[Steven Weinberg]] described how in his youth he had been a utilitarian but had been dissuaded of the notion that "the fundamental principle that guides our actions should be the greatest happiness for the greatest number" by reading [[Aldous Hŭley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]''. Weinberg went on to say: "Now, Sam Harris is aware of this kind of counter argument [to utilitarianism], and says it's not happiness, it's human welfare. Well, as you make things vaguer and vaguer, of course, it becomes harder and harder to say it doesn't fit your own moral feelings, but it also becomes less and less useful as a means of making moral judgements. You could take that to the extreme and make up some nonsense word and say that's the important thing and no-one could refute it but it wouldn't be very helpful. I regard human welfare and the way Sam Harris refers to it as sort of halfway in that direction to absolute nonsense."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebuve4INdAU&amp;list=PLrxfgDEc2NxYQuZ5T6CSdS8uafdh0kmDL&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months after the book's release, Sam Harris wrote a follow-up at ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' responding to his critics.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sam-harris/a-response-to-critics_b_815742.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Sam | last=Harris | title=A Response to Critics | date=2011-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Moral Landscape Challenge''===

On August 31, 2013, in response to the negative reviews of his book, Harris issued a public challenge for anyone to write an essay of less than 1,000 words rebutting the "central argument" of the book.&lt;ref name="MLChallenge"&gt;[http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/the-moral-landscape-challenge1/ The Moral Landscape Challenge : : Sam Harris]&lt;/ref&gt; The submissions were vetted by Russell Blackford, with the author of the essay judged best to receive $2,000, or $20,000 if they succeeded in changing Harris's mind.&lt;ref name="MLChallenge"/&gt; 424 essays were received by the deadline.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/Metamagician/status/433134620637274113 "Twitter Russell Blackford"]&lt;/ref&gt; On March 11, 2014, Blackford announced the winning essay was written by philosophy instructor Ryan Born.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/the-moral-landscape-challenge ''The Moral Landscape Challenge: The Winning Essay'']&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20434">'''The Toyota Way''' is a set of principles and behaviors that underlie the [[Toyota]] Motor Corporation's managerial approach and production system. Toyota first summed up its philosophy, values and manufacturing ideals in 2001, calling it "The Toyota Way 2001". It consists of  principles in two key areas: continuous improvement, and respect for people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Toyota Motor |title=Environmental &amp; Social Report 2003 |page=80 |url=http://www.toyota.co.jp/en/environmental_rep/03/pdf/E_p80.pdf |accessdate=26 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toyota Motor Corporation Annual Report, 2003, page 19. "The Toyota Way, which has been passed down since the Companyʼs founding, is a unique set of values and manufacturing ideals. Clearly, our operations are going to become more and more globalized. With this in mind, we compiled a booklet, The Toyota Way 2001, in order to transcend the diverse languages and cultures of our employees and to communicate our philosophy to them." (Mr. Fujio Cho, President, Toyota Motor Corporation)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Toyota Motor |title=Sustainability Report 2009 |page=54 |url=http://www.toyota-global.com/sustainability/sustainability_report/pdf_file_download/09/pdf/sr09_p54_p59.pdf |accessdate=26 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of the principles==
The Toyota Way has been called "a system designed to provide the tools for people to continually improve their work"&lt;ref name = "Exec sum" /&gt; The 14 principles of The Toyota Way are organized in four sections: 
# Long-Term Philosophy
# The Right Process Will Produce the Right Results
# Add Value to the Organization by Developing Your People
# Continuously Solving Root Problems Drives Organizational Learning
The two focal points of the principles are continuous improvement and respect for people. The principles for a continuous improvement include establishing a long-term vision, working on challenges, continual innovation, and going to the source of the issue or problem. The principles relating to respect for people include ways of building respect and teamwork.

==The 14 Principles==
The system can be summarized in 14 principles.&lt;ref name="The Toyota Way"&gt;{{cite book |last=Liker |first=Jeffrey K. |title=The Toyota Way: 14 Management Principles from the World's Greatest Manufacturer |year=2004 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=978-0-07-139231-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The principles are set out and briefly described below:

===Section I — Long-Term Philosophy===
'''Principle 1'''
*''Base your management decisions on a long-term philosophy, even at the expense of short-term financial goals.''
People need purpose to find motivation and establish goals.

===Section II — The Right Process Will Produce the Right Results===
'''Principle 2'''
*''Create a continuous process flow to bring problems to the surface.''

Work processes are redesigned to eliminate waste ([[Muda (Japanese term)|muda]]) through the process of continuous improvement — [[kaizen]]. The seven types of muda are:
#Overproduction
#Waiting (time on hand)
#Unnecessary transport or conveyance
#Overprocessing or incorrect processing
#Excess inventory
#Motion
# Defects

'''Principle 3'''
*''Use "pull" systems to avoid overproduction.''

A method where a process signals its predecessor that more material is needed. The pull system produces only the required material after the subsequent operation signals a need for it. This process is necessary to reduce overproduction.

'''Principle 4'''
*''Level out the workload ([[heijunka]]). (Work like the tortoise, not the hare).''

This helps achieve the goal of minimizing waste ([[Muda (Japanese term)|muda]]), not overburdening people or the equipment ([[Muri (Japanese term)|muri]]), and not creating uneven production levels ([[Mura (Japanese term)|mura]]).

'''Principle 5'''
*''Build a culture of stopping to fix problems, to get quality right the first time.''

Quality takes precedence ([[Jidoka]]). Any employee in the [[Toyota Production System]] has the authority to stop the process to signal a quality issue.

'''Principle 6'''
*''Standardized tasks and processes are the foundation for continuous improvement and employee empowerment.''

Although Toyota has a bureaucratic system, the way that it is implemented allows for continuous improvement (kaizen) from the people affected by that system. It empowers the employee to aid in the growth and improvement of the company.

'''Principle 7'''
*''Use visual control so no problems are hidden.''

Included in this principle is the [[5S (methodology)|5S]] Program - steps that are used to make all work spaces efficient and productive, help people share work stations, reduce time looking for needed tools and improve the work environment.

*Sort: Sort out unneeded items
*Straighten: Have a place for everything
*Shine: Keep the area clean
*Standardize: Create rules and standard operating procedures
*Sustain: Maintain the system and continue to improve it

'''Principle 8'''
*''Use only reliable, thoroughly tested technology that serves your people and processes.''

Technology is '''pulled by''' manufacturing, not '''pushed to''' manufacturing.

===Section III — Add Value to the Organization by Developing Your People===
'''Principle 9'''
*''Grow leaders who thoroughly understand the work, live the philosophy, and teach it to others.''

Without constant attention, the principles will fade. The principles have to be ingrained, it must be the way one thinks. Employees must be educated and trained: they have to maintain a learning organization.

'''Principle 10'''
*''Develop exceptional people and teams who follow your company's philosophy.''

Teams should consist of 4-5 people and numerous management tiers. Success is based on the team, not the individual.

'''Principle 11'''
*''Respect your extended network of partners and suppliers by challenging them and helping them improve.''

Toyota treats suppliers much like they treat their employees, challenging them to do better and helping them to achieve it. Toyota provides cross functional teams to help suppliers discover and fix problems so that they can become a stronger, better supplier.

===Section IV — Continuously Solving Root Problems Drives Organizational Learning===
'''Principle 12'''
*''Go and see for yourself to thoroughly understand the situation ([[Genchi Genbutsu]]).''

Toyota managers are expected to "go-and-see" operations. Without experiencing the situation firsthand, managers will not have an understanding of how it can be improved. Furthermore, managers use Tadashi Yamashima's (President, Toyota Technical Center (TTC)) ten management principles as a guideline:

#Always keep the final target in mind.
#Clearly assign tasks to yourself and others.
#Think and speak on verified, proven information and data.
#Take full advantage of the wisdom and experiences of others to send, gather or discuss information. 
#Share information with others in a timely fashion.
#Always report, inform and consult in a timely manner.
#Analyze and understand shortcomings in your capabilities in a measurable way.
#Relentlessly strive to conduct [[kaizen]] activities.
#Think "outside the box," or beyond common sense and standard rules.
#Always be mindful of protecting your safety and health.

'''Principle 13'''
*''Make decisions slowly by consensus, thoroughly considering all options; implement decisions rapidly ([[nemawashi]]).''

The following are decision parameters:
#Find what is really going on (go-and-see) to test 
#Determine the underlying cause
#Consider a broad range of alternatives
#Build consensus on the resolution
#Use efficient communication tools

'''Principle 14'''
*''Become a learning organization through relentless reflection ([[hansei]]) and continuous improvement ([[kaizen]]).''

The process of becoming a learning organization involves criticizing every aspect of what one does. The general problem solving technique to determine the root cause of a problem includes:
#Initial problem perception
#Clarify the problem
#Locate area/point of cause
#[[Root cause analysis|Investigate root cause]] (5 whys)
#Countermeasure
#Evaluate
#Standardize

==Research findings==
In 2004, Dr. Jeffrey Liker, a [[University of Michigan]] professor of [[industrial engineering]], published ''The Toyota Way''. In his book Liker calls the Toyota Way "a system designed to provide the tools for people to continually improve their work."&lt;ref name = "Exec sum"&gt;{{cite web|last=Liker |first= Jeffrey |year=2004 |url=http://ICOS.groups.si.umich.edu//Liker04.pdf |title=The 14 Principles of the Toyota Way: An Executive Summary of the Culture Behind TPS|page=36 |publisher=University of Michigan |accessdate=26 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to Liker, the 14 principles of The Toyota Way are organized in four sections: (1) long-term philosophy, (2) the right process will produce the right results, (3) add value to the organization by developing your people, and (4) continuously solving root problems drives organizational learning.

===Long-term philosophy===
The first principle involves managing with a long-view rather than for short-term gain. It reflects a belief that people need purpose to find motivation and establish goals.

===Right process will produce right results===
The next seven principles are focused on process with an eye towards quality outcome. Following these principles, work processes are redesigned to eliminate waste ([[Muda (Japanese term)|muda]]) through the process of continuous improvement — [[kaizen]]. The seven types of muda are (1) overproduction; (2) waiting, time on hand; (3) unnecessary transport or conveyance; (4) overprocessing or incorrect processing; (5) excess inventory; (6) motion; and (7) defects.

The principles in this section empower employees in spite of the bureaucratic processes of Toyota, as any employee in the [[Toyota Production System]] has the authority to stop production to signal a quality issue, emphasizing that quality takes precedence ([[Jidoka]]). The way the Toyota bureaucratic system is implemented to allow for continuous improvement (kaizen) from the people affected by that system so that any employee may aid in the growth and improvement of the company.

Recognition of the value of employees is also part of the principle of measured production rate ([[heijunka]]), as a level workload helps avoid overburdening people and equipment ([[Muri (Japanese term)|muri]]), but this is also intended to minimize waste (muda) and avoid uneven production levels ([[Mura (Japanese term)|mura]]).

These principles are also designed to ensure that only essential materials are employed (to avoid overproduction), that the work environment is maintained efficiently (the [[5S (methodology)|5S]] Program) to help people share work stations and to reduce time looking for needed tools, and that the technology used is reliable and thoroughly tested.

===Value to organization by developing people===
Human development is the focus of principles 9 through 11. Principle 9 emphasizes the need to ensure that leaders embrace and promote the corporate philosophy. This reflects, according to Liker, a belief that the principles have to be ingrained in employees to survive. The 10th principle emphasizes the need of individuals and work teams to embrace the company's philosophy, with teams of 4-5 people who are judged in success by their team achievements, rather than their individual efforts. Principle 11 looks to business partners, who are treated by Toyota much like they treat their employees. Toyota challenges them to do better and helps them to achieve it, providing cross functional teams to help suppliers discover and fix problems so that they can become a stronger, better supplier.

===Solving root problems drives organizational learning===
The final principles embrace a philosophy of problem solving that emphasizes thorough understanding, [[consensus]]-based solutions swiftly implemented and continual reflection ([[hansei]]) and improvement ([[kaizen]]). The 12th principle ([[Genchi Genbutsu]]) sets out the expectation that managers will personally evaluate operations so that they have a firsthand understanding of situations and problems. Principle 13 encourages thorough consideration of possible solutions through a consensus process, with rapid implementation of decisions once reached ([[nemawashi]]). The final principle requires that Toyota be a "learning organization", continually reflecting on its practices and striving for improvement. According to Liker, the process of becoming a learning organization involves criticizing every aspect of what one does.

==Translating the principles==
There is a question of [[Diffusion (business)|uptake]] of the principles now that Toyota has production operations in many different countries around the world. As a ''New York Times'' article notes, while the corporate culture may have been easily disseminated by word of mouth when Toyota manufacturing was only in Japan, with worldwide production, many different [[culture]]s must be taken into account. Concepts such as "mutual ownership of problems", or ''"[[Genchi Genbutsu|genchi genbutsu]]"'', (solving problems at the source instead of behind desks), and the ''"[[kaizen]] mind"'', (an unending sense of crisis behind the company’s constant drive to improve), may be unfamiliar to North Americans and people of other cultures. A recent increase in vehicle recalls may be due, in part, to "a failure by Toyota to spread its obsession for craftsmanship among its growing ranks of overseas factory workers and managers." Toyota is attempting to address these needs by establishing training institutes in the United States and in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fackler |first=Martin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/15/business/worldbusiness/15toyota.html?pagewanted=all |title=The 'Toyota Way' Is Translated for a New Generation of Foreign Managers |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 15, 2007 |accessdate=26 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Results ==
Toyota Way has been driven so deeply into the psyche of employees at all levels that it has morphed from a strategy into an important element of the company's culture.&lt;ref name="Heskett"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LCDoh6-opEkC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=%22Toyota+way%22+so+shocking+that+it+may+have+led+to+some+amount+of+denial+as+well+as+loyal+customers |page=130 |title=The culture cycle : how to shape the unseen force that transforms performance |first=James L |last=Heskett |publisher= FT Press |year=2012 |isbn=9780132779784 |accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Masaki Saruta, author of several books on Toyota, "the real Toyota Way is a culture of control."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-03-24/news/sc-biz-0325-toyota-man-20100324_1_toyota-motor-corp-toyota-officials-paul-nolasco |title=Toyota’s rigid culture criticized in light of recalls - Automaker’s Toyota Way handbook dictates details of employees’ lives, even in their off time |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=24 March 2010|first=John M. |last=Glionna |accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=rAlcjg0QhGkC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=Masaki+Saruta+Toyota+Way |page=65 |title=Inside the mind of Toyota : management principles for enduring growth |first=Satoshi |last=Hino |publisher=Productivity Press |year=2006 |accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Toyota Way rewards intense company loyalty that at the same time invariably reduces the voice of those who challenge authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.toyota-global.com/sustainability/csr_initiatives/stakeholders/employees/index3.html |title=Relations with Employees |publisher=Toyota Motors |accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toyota.dk/Images/ToyotaCodeOfConduct_tcm200-635681.pdf |title=Toyota Code of Conduct |publisher=Toyota Motor Europe |date=October 2006 |accessdate=29 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914012629/http://www.toyota.dk/Images/ToyotaCodeOfConduct_tcm200-635681.pdf |archivedate=14 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "The Toyota Way of constructive criticism to reach a better way of doing things 'is not always received in good spirit at home.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=nrYWDniU9X8C&amp;pg=PA130&amp;lpg=PA130&amp;dq=Atkins+noted+wryly+that+the+Toyota+Way+of+constructive+criticism+to+reach+a+better+way+of+doing+things+“is+not+always+received+in+good+spirit+at+home%22

The '''triune brain''' is a model of the [[evolution]] of the [[vertebrate]] [[forebrain]] and behavior, proposed by the American physician and [[neuroscience|neuroscientist]] [[Paul D. MacLean]]. MacLean originally formulated his model in the 1960s and propounded it at length in his 1990 book ''The Triune Brain in Evolution''.&lt;ref name="KHEPER"&gt;{{cite web| last = Kazlev| first = M. Alan| title = The Triune Brain.| work = KHEPER| date = 2003-10-19| url = http://www.kheper.net/topics/intelligence/MacLean.htm| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20031119214318/http://www.kheper.net/topics/intelligence/MacLean.htm| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 2003-11-19| accessdate = 2007-05-25| display-authors = etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The triune brain consists of the [[Basal ganglia|reptilian complex]], the paleomammalian complex ([[limbic system]]), and the neomammalian complex ([[neocortex]]), viewed as structures sequentially added to the forebrain in the course of evolution. However, this hypothesis is no longer espoused by the majority of comparative neuroscientists in the post-2000 era.&lt;ref&gt;Kiverstein, J., &amp; Miller, M. (2015). The embodied brain: towards a radical embodied cognitive neuroscience. Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, 9, 237. http://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2015.00237&lt;/ref&gt; 
The triune brain hypothesis became familiar to a broad popular audience through [[Carl Sagan]]'s [[Pulitzer prize]] winning 1977 book ''[[The Dragons of Eden]]''. The theory has been embraced by some psychiatrists and at least one leading [[affective neuroscience]] researcher.&lt;ref&gt;Panksepp, J. (2003). Foreword to Cory, G. and Gardner, R. (2002) ''The Evolutionary Neuroethology of Paul MacLean: Convergences and Frontiers''. {{ISBN|978-0275972196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reptilian complex ==
The reptilian complex, also known as the R-complex or "reptilian brain" was the name MacLean gave to the [[basal ganglia]], structures derived from the floor of the forebrain during development. The term derives from the idea that comparative neuroanatomists once believed that the forebrains of reptiles and birds were dominated by these structures. MacLean proposed that the reptilian complex was responsible for species-typical instinctual behaviours involved in aggression, dominance, territoriality, and ritual displays. {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

== Paleomammalian complex ==
The paleomammalian brain consists of the [[septum]], [[amygdalae]], [[hypothalamus]], [[hippocampus|hippocampal complex]], and [[cingulate cortex]]. MacLean first introduced the term "[[limbic system]]" to refer to this set of interconnected brain structures in a paper in 1952. MacLean's recognition of the limbic system as a major functional system in the brain was widely accepted among neuroscientists, and is generally regarded as his most important contribution to the field. MacLean maintained that the structures of the limbic system arose early in mammalian evolution (hence "paleomammalian") and were responsible for the motivation and emotion involved in feeding, reproductive behaviour, and parental behaviour.  {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

== Neomammalian complex ==
The neomammalian complex consists of the cerebral [[neocortex]], a structure found uniquely in higher mammals, and especially humans. MacLean regarded its addition as the most recent step in the evolution of the mammalian brain, conferring the ability for language, abstraction, planning, and perception. {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

== Status of the model ==
MacLean originally formulated the triune brain hypothesis in the 1960s, drawing on comparative neuroanatomical work done by [[Ludwig Edinger]], [[Elizabeth C. Crosby]] and Charles Judson Herrick early in the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Reiner|first=A. |year=1990 |title=An Explanation of Behavior |journal=Science |volume=250 |pages=303–305 |doi=10.1126/science.250.4978.303-a|pmid=17797318|issue=4978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = PrinciplesBrainEvolution&gt;[[Georg F. Striedter|Striedter, G. F.]] (2005) ''Principles of Brain Evolution.'' Sinauer Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980s saw a rebirth of interest in comparative neuroanatomy, motivated in part by the availability of a variety of new neuroanatomical techniques for charting the circuitry of animal brains. Subsequent findings have refined the traditional neuroanatomical ideas upon which MacLean based his hypothesis.

For example, the basal ganglia (structures derived from the floor of the forebrain and making up MacLean's reptilian complex) were shown to take up a much smaller portion of the forebrains of reptiles and birds (together called [[sauropsids]]) than previously supposed, and to exist in [[amphibians]] and [[fish]] as well as [[mammals]] and sauropsids. Because the basal ganglia are found in the forebrains of all modern vertebrates, they most likely date to the common evolutionary ancestor of the vertebrates, more than 500 million years ago, rather than to the origin of reptiles.

Some recent behavioral studies do not support the traditional view of sauropsid behavior as stereotyped and ritualistic (as in MacLean's reptilian complex). Birds have been shown to possess highly sophisticated cognitive abilities, such as the toolmaking of the [[New Caledonian crow]] and the language-like categorization abilities of the [[grey parrot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Paul | last=Patton |title= One World, Many Minds: Intelligence in the Animal Kingdom |url= http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=one-world-many-minds |work= Scientific American |date= December 2008|accessdate=29 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structures of the limbic system, which MacLean proposed arose in early mammals, have now been shown to exist across a range of modern vertebrates. The "paleomammalian" trait of parental care of offspring is widespread in birds and occurs in some fishes as well.  Thus, like the basal ganglia, the evolution of these systems presumably dates to a common vertebrate ancestor.&lt;ref name = PrinciplesBrainEvolution /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Butler, A. B. and Hodos, W. Comparative Vertebrate Neuroanatomy: Evolution and Adaptation, Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, recent studies based on paleontological data or comparative anatomical evidence strongly suggest that the neocortex was already present in the earliest emerging mammals.&lt;ref name="PrinciplesBrainEvolution"/&gt; In addition, although non-mammals do not have a neocortex in the true sense (that is, a structure comprising part of the forebrain roof, or pallium,  consisting of six characteristic layers of neurons), they possess [[Pallium (neuroanatomy)|pallial]] regions, and some parts of the pallium are considered homologous to the mammalian neocortex. While these areas lack the characteristic six neocortical layers, birds and reptiles generally possess three layers in the dorsal pallium (the homolog of the mammalian neocortex).&lt;ref name = PrinciplesBrainEvolution /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The [[telencephalon]] of birds and mammals makes neuroanatomical connections with other telecencephalic structures&lt;ref name = PrinciplesBrainEvolution /&gt; like those made by neocortex. It mediates similar functions such as perception, learning and memory, decision making, motor control, conceptual thinking.

== Lay interest ==
The triune model of the mammalian brain is seen as an oversimplified organizing theme by some in the field of comparative neuroscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = CU | year = 2010 | title = The triune brain in antiquity: Plato, Aristotle, Erasistratus | url = | journal = [[Journal of the History of the Neurosciences]] | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 1–14 | doi = 10.1080/09647040802601605 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to hold public interest because of its simplicity. While technically inaccurate in many respects as an explanation for brain activity, it remains one of very few approximations of the truth we have to work with:  the "neocortex" represents that cluster of brain structures involved in advanced cognition, including planning, modeling and simulation; the "limbic brain" refers to those brain structures, wherever located, associated with social and nurturing behaviors, mutual reciprocity, and other behaviors and affects that arose during the age of the mammals; and the "reptilian brain" refers to those brain structures related to territoriality, ritual behavior and other "reptile" behaviors.  The broad explanatory value makes this approximation very engaging and is a useful level of complexity for high school students to begin engaging with brain research.
 
[[Howard Bloom]], in his book ''[[The Lucifer Principle]]'', references the concept of the triune brain in his explanations of certain aspects of human behavior. [[Arthur Koestler]] made MacLean's concept of the triune brain the centerpiece of much of his later work, notably ''[[The Ghost in the Machine]]''. English novelist [[Julian Barnes]] quotes MacLean on the triune brain in the foreword to his 1982 novel ''Before She Met Me''. Peter A. Levine uses the triune brain concept in his book ''Waking the Tiger'' to explain his [[somatic experiencing]] approach to healing trauma.

Glynda-Lee Hoffmann, in her book, "The Secret Dowry of Eve, Women's Role in the Development of Consciousness," references the triune theory explored by MacLean, and she goes one step further.  Her theory about human behavior and the problems we create with that behavior, distinguishes the prefrontal cortex as uniquely different from the rest of the neocortex.  The prefrontal cortex, with its agenda of integration, is the part of the brain that can get the other parts to work together for the good of the individual.  In many humans the reptilian cortex (agenda: territory and reproduction [in humans that translates to power and sex] is out of control and the amygdala stokes the fear that leads to more bad behavior.  The prefrontal cortex is the key to our future if we can harness its power.&lt;ref&gt;The Secret Dowry of Eve 2003, {{ISBN|0-89281-968-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vilfredo Federico Damaso Pareto''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|r|ɛ|t|oʊ}}; {{IPA-it|vilˈfreːdo paˈreːto|lang}}; born '''Wilfried Fritz Pareto''', 15 July 1848 – 19 August 1923) was an Italian [[engineer]], [[sociologist]], [[economist]], political scientist, and [[philosopher]]. He made several important contributions to economics, particularly in the study of [[income distribution]] and in the analysis of individuals' choices.  He was also responsible for popularising the use of the term "[[elite]]" in social analysis.

He introduced the concept of [[Pareto efficiency]] and helped develop the field of [[microeconomics]]. He was also the first to discover that [[income]] follows a [[Pareto distribution]], which is a [[power law]] probability distribution. The [[Pareto principle]] was named after him, and it was built on observations of his such as that 80% of the land in Italy was owned by about 20% of the population. He also contributed to the fields of [[sociology]] and [[mathematics]], according to the mathematician [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] and Richard L. Hudson:

{{quote|His legacy as an economist was profound. Partly because of him, the field evolved from a branch of moral philosophy as practised by [[Adam Smith]] into a data intensive field of scientific research and mathematical equations.  His books look more like modern economics than most other texts of that day: tables of statistics from across the world and ages, rows of integral signs and equations, intricate charts and graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mandelbrot |first=Benoit |authorlink =Benoit Mandelbrot|author2=Richard L Hudson  |title=The (mis)behavior of markets : a fractal view of risk, ruin, and reward |year=2004 |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |page=153|isbn=0465043577}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Biography==
Pareto was born of an exiled noble [[Genoa|Genoese]] family in 1848 in Paris, the centre of the popular revolutions of that year. His father, Raffaele Pareto (1812–1882), was an Italian civil engineer and [[Liguria]]n marquis who had left Italy much like [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] and other Italian nationalists.&lt;ref name=Amoroso&gt;{{cite journal|last=Amoroso|first=Luigi|title=Vilfredo Pareto|journal=Econometrica|date=January 1938|volume=6|issue=1|pages=1–21|jstor=1910081|doi=10.2307/1910081}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Marie Metenier, was a French woman. Enthusiastic about the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 German revolution]], his parents named him Fritz Wilfried, which became Vilfredo Federico upon his family's move back to Italy in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=van Suntum |first=Ulrich |title=The Invisible Hand |isbn=3-540-20497-0 |publisher=Springer |year=2005 |page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his childhood, Pareto lived in a middle-class environment, receiving a high standard of education, attending the new created ''Istituto Tecnico Leardi'' where  Fernando Pio Rosellini was his mathematics professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Giacalone-Monaco|first= Tommaso|title= Ricerche intorno alla giovinezza di Vilfredo Pareto|jstor=23239355|language= it|journal= Giornale degli Economisti e Annali di Economia|volume= 25|issue= 1/2|year= 1966|pages= 97–104|issn= 0017-0097}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1869, he earned a doctor's degree in engineering from what is now the [[Politecnico di Torino|Polytechnic University of Turin]]&lt;ref name=Amoroso/&gt; (then the Technical School for Engineers). His dissertation was entitled "The Fundamental Principles of Equilibrium in Solid Bodies". His later interest in equilibrium analysis in [[Economic equilibrium|economics]] and [[Social equilibrium|sociology]] can be traced back to this paper.

===From civil engineer to classical liberal economist===
For some years after graduation, he worked as a [[civil engineer]], first for the state-owned Italian Railway Company and later in private industry. He was manager of the Iron Works of San Giovanni Valdarno and later general manager of Italian Iron Works.&lt;ref name=Amoroso/&gt;

He did not begin serious work in economics until his mid-forties. He started his career a fiery advocate of [[classical liberalism]], besting the most ardent British liberals with his attacks on any form of government intervention in the [[free market]]. In 1886, he became a lecturer on [[economics]] and [[management]] at the [[University of Florence]]. His stay in [[Florence]] was marked by political activity, much of it fueled by his own frustrations with government regulators. In 1889, after the death of his parents, Pareto changed his lifestyle, quitting his job and marrying a Russian, Alessandrina Bakunina. She left him in 1902 for a young servant.

===Economics and sociology===
In 1893, he succeeded [[Léon Walras]] to the chair of Political Economy at the [[University of Lausanne]]&lt;ref name=Amoroso/&gt; in Switzerland where he remained for the rest of his life. In 1906, he made the famous observation that twenty percent of the population owned eighty percent of the property in Italy, later generalised by [[Joseph M. Juran]] into the [[Pareto principle]] (also termed the [[80–20 rule]]). In one of his books published in 1909 he showed the [[Pareto distribution]] of how wealth is distributed, he believed "through any human society, in any age, or country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mandelbrot |first=Benoit |author2=Richard L Hudson  |title=The (Mis)behavior of Markets :A Fractal View of Risk, Ruin, and Reward |year=2004 |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained cordial personal relationships with individual socialists, but always thought their economic ideas were severely flawed. He later became suspicious of their humanitarian motives and denounced socialist leaders as an 'aristocracy of brigands' who threatened to despoil the country and criticized the government of [[Giovanni Giolitti]] for not taking a tougher stance against worker strikes. Growing unrest among labor in Italy led him to the anti-socialist and anti-democratic camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03085149000000016|author=Bellamy, Richard |year=1990|title=From Ethical to Economic Liberalism – The Sociology of Pareto's Politics|journal=Economy and Society|volume=19|issue=4|pages=431–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; His attitude toward [[fascism]] in his last years is a matter of controversy.&lt;ref name="RenatoCirillo"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Was Vilfredo Pareto Really a 'Precursor' of Fascism?|journal=American Journal of Economics and Sociology|volume=42|issue=2|pages=235|jstor=3486644|doi=10.1111/j.1536-7150.1983.tb01708.x|quote=Vilfredo Pareto has been labeled a fascist and 'a precursor of fascism' largely because he welcomed the advent of fascism in Italy and was honored by the new regime. Some have seen in his sociological  works the foundations of fascism. This is not correct. Even fascist writers did not find much merit in these works, and definitely condemned his economic theories. As a political thinker he remained a radical libertarian till the end, and continued to express serious reservations about fascism, and to voice opposition to its basic policies. This is evident from his correspondence with his close friends. There are strong reasons to believe that, had he lived long enough, Pareto would have revolted against fascism|year=1983|last1=Cirillo|first1=Renato}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Four Paretos of Raymond Aron|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|volume=47|issue=2|pages=287|jstor=2709815|doi=10.2307/2709815 |year=1986|last1=Campbell|first1=Stuart L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pareto's relationship with scientific sociology in the age of the foundation is grafted in a paradigmatic way in the moment in which he, starting from the political economy, criticizes positivism as a totalizing and metaphysical system devoid of a rigorous logical-experimental method. In this sense we can read the fate of the
Paretian production within a history of the social sciences that continues to show its peculiarity and interest for its contributions in the 21st century (Giovanni Busino, ''Sugli studi paretiani all'alba del XXI secolo'' in ''Omaggio a Vilfredo Pareto'', ''Numero monografico in memoria di Giorgio Sola'' a cura di Stefano Monti Bragadin, "Storia Politica Società", Quaderni di Scienze Umane, anno IX, n. 15, giugno-dicembre 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;1 e sg.)) . The story of Pareto is also part of the multidisciplinary research of a scientific model that privileges sociology as a critique of cumulative models of knowledge as well as a discipline tending to the affirmation of relational models of science (Guglielmo Rinzivillo, ''Vilfredo Pareto e i modelli interdisciplinari nella scienza,'' "Sociologia", A. XXIX, n. 1, New Series, 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;2017–222 see also in Guglielmo Rinzivillo, ''Una epistemologia senza storia'', Rome, New Culture, 2013, pp.&amp;nbsp;13–29, {{ISBN|978-88-6812-222-5}}).

===Personal life===
In 1923 Pareto remarried with Jeanne Regis, just before he died in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, 19 August 1923,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://statprob.com/encyclopedia/VilfredoFederigoSamasoPARETO.html |title=The Encyclopedia Sponsored by Statistics and Probability Societies |publisher=StatProb |date=19 August 1923 |accessdate=4 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304204438/http://statprob.com/encyclopedia/VilfredoFederigoSamasoPARETO.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "among a menagerie of cats that he and his French lover kept" in their villa; "the local divorce laws prevented him from divorcing his wife and remarrying until just a few months prior to his death".

==Sociology==
Pareto's later years were spent in collecting the material for his best-known work, ''Trattato di sociologia generale'' (1916) (''The Mind and Society'', published in 1935). His final work was ''Compendio di sociologia generale'' (1920).

In his ''Trattato di Sociologia Generale'' (1916, rev. French trans. 1917), published in English by [[Harcourt, Brace]] in a four-volume edition edited by [[Arthur Livingston]] under the title ''[[The Mind and Society]]'' (1935), Pareto developed the notion of the [[circulation of elite]]s, the first [[social cycle theory]] in sociology. He is famous for saying "history is a graveyard of aristocracies".&lt;ref&gt;Rossides, Daniel W. (1998) ''Social Theory: Its Origins, History, and Contemporary Relevance''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield. p. 203. {{ISBN|1882289501}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pareto seems to have turned to sociology for an understanding of why his abstract mathematical economic theories did not work out in practice, in the belief that unforeseen or uncontrollable social factors intervened. His sociology holds that much social action is nonlogical and that much personal action is designed to give spurious logicality to non-rational actions. We are driven, he taught, by certain "residues" and by "derivations" from these residues. The more important of these have to do with conservatism and risk-taking, and human history is the story of the alternate dominance of these sentiments in the ruling elite, which comes into power strong in conservatism but gradually changes over to the philosophy of the "foxes" or speculators. A catastrophe results, with a return to conservatism; the "lion" mentality follows. This cycle might be broken by the use of force, says Pareto, but the elite becomes weak and humanitarian and shrinks from violence.&lt;ref&gt;Aron, Raymond. (1967) ''Main Currents in Sociological Thought: Durkheim, Pareto, Weber – Vol. 2''  [https://www.questia.com/read/100306508 online edition]; [https://www.amazon.com/Main-Currents-Sociological-Thought-Durkheim/dp/0765804360/  excerpt and text search]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Pareto's sociology was introduced to the United States by [[George C. Homans|George Homans]] and [[Lawrence Joseph Henderson|Lawrence J. Henderson]] at Harvard, and had considerable influence, especially on Harvard sociologist [[Talcott Parsons]], who developed a systems approach to society and economics that argues the status quo is usually functional.&lt;ref&gt;Homans, George C., and Charles P. Curtis Jr. (1934) [https://www.questia.com/read/80982212 ''An Introduction to Pareto: His Sociology'']. Alfred A. Knopf. New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pareto was a lifelong [[Anti-Marxism|opponent of Marxism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jkalb.freeshell.org/misc/pareto.html |title=Vilfredo Pareto – An Overview |publisher=Jkalb.freeshell.org |date= |accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fascism and power distribution==
[[Benoît Mandelbrot]] wrote:

{{quote|One of Pareto's equations achieved special prominence, and controversy. He was fascinated by problems of power and wealth. How do people get it? How is it distributed around society? How do those who have it use it? The gulf between rich and poor has always been part of the human condition, but Pareto resolved to measure it. He gathered reams of data on wealth and income through different centuries, through different countries: the tax records of Basel, Switzerland, from 1454 and from Augsburg, Germany, in 1471, 1498 and 1512; contemporary rental income from Paris; personal income from Britain, Prussia, Saxony, Ireland, Italy, Peru. What he found – or thought he found – was striking. When he plotted the data on graph paper, with income on one axis, and number of people with that income on the other, he saw the same picture nearly everywhere in every era. Society was not a "social pyramid" with the proportion of rich to poor sloping gently from one class to the next. Instead it was more of a "social arrow" – very fat on the bottom where the mass of men live, and very thin at the top where sit the wealthy elite.  Nor was this effect by chance; the data did not remotely fit a bell curve, as one would expect if wealth were distributed randomly. "It is a social law", he wrote: something "in the nature of man".&lt;ref name=mandelbrot&gt;{{cite book |last=Mandelbrot |first=Benoît  |authorlink= Benoît Mandelbrot|title=The Misbehavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Financial Turbulence |publisher=Basic Books|date=2006 |pages=|chapter=Τhe Mystery of Cotton |isbn=978-0465043576}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|153}}}}

Pareto had argued that democracy was an illusion and that a ruling class always emerged and enriched itself. For him, the key question was how actively the rulers ruled. For this reason he called for a drastic reduction of the state and welcomed [[Benito Mussolini]]'s rule as a transition to this minimal state so as to liberate the "pure" economic forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Contemporary Political Ideologies |last=Eatwell |first=Roger |author2=Anthony Wright  |publisher=Continuum |location=London |year=1999 |pages=38–39|isbn=082645173X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandelbrot summarized Pareto's notions as follows:

{{quote|At the bottom of the Wealth curve, he wrote, Men and Women starve and children die young. In the broad middle of the curve all is turmoil and motion: people rising and falling, climbing by talent or luck and falling by alcoholism, tuberculosis and other kinds of unfitness. At the very top sit the elite of the elite, who control wealth and power for a time – until they are unseated through revolution or upheaval by a new aristocratic class. There is no progress in human history. Democracy is a fraud. Human nature is primitive, emotional, unyielding. The smarter, abler, stronger, and shrewder take the lion's share. The weak starve, lest society become degenerate: One can, Pareto wrote, 'compare the social body to the human body, which will promptly perish if prevented from eliminating toxins.' Inflammatory stuff – and it burned Pareto's reputation.&lt;ref name=mandelbrot/&gt;{{rp|154}}}}

The future leader of [[Italian fascism]] [[Benito Mussolini]], in 1904, when he was a young student, attended some of Pareto's lectures at the [[University of Lausanne]]. It has been argued that Mussolini's move away from [[socialism]] towards a form of "[[elitism]]" may be attributed to Pareto's ideas.&lt;ref name=musso&gt;{{cite book |last= |first=|editor-last1=Di Scala |editor-first1=Spencer M. |editor-last2=Gentile|editor-first2= Emilio|title=Mussolini 1883-1915: Triumph and Transformation of a Revolutionary Socialist |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=USA|date=2016 |pages=|chapter= |isbn=978-1-137-53486-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To quote [[Franz Borkenau]], a biographer:
{{quote|In the first years of his rule Mussolini literally executed the policy prescribed by Pareto, destroying political liberalism, but at the same time largely replacing state management of private enterprise, diminishing taxes on property, favoring industrial development, imposing a religious education in dogmas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Borkenau |first=Franz |authorlink=Franz Borkenau |title=Pareto |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=1936 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}}}}

[[Karl Popper]] dubbed Pareto the "theoretician of totalitarianism",&lt;ref&gt;Mandelbrot, Benoit; Richard L Hudson (2004). ''The (mis)behavior of markets : a fractal view of risk, ruin, and reward.'' New York: Basic Books. pp. 152–155. {{ISBN|0465043577}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but, according to Cirillo, there is no evidence in Popper's published work that he read Pareto in any detail before repeating what was then a common but dubious judgment in anti-fascist circles.&lt;ref name="RenatoCirillo"/&gt;

Some fascist writers, such as [[Luigi Amoroso]], wrote approvingly of Pareto's ideas:
{{quote|Just as the weaknesses of the flesh delayed, but could not prevent, the triumph of [[Saint Augustine]], so a [[rational]]istic vocation retarded but did not impede the flowering of the [[mysticism]] of Pareto. For that reason, Fascism, having become victorious, extolled him in life, and glorifies his memory, like that of a confessor of its faith.&lt;ref name=Amoroso/&gt;}}

Author  Renato Cirillo argued, on the contrary, that:
{{quote|Some have seen in [Pareto's] sociological works the foundations of fascism. This is not correct. Even fascist writers did not find much merit in these works, and definitely condemned his economic theories.&lt;ref name="RenatoCirillo" /&gt;}}

== Economic concepts ==

'''Pareto Theory Of Maximum Economics'''

Pareto turned his interest to economic matters and he became an advocate of free trade, finding himself in difficulty with the Italian government. His writings reflected the ideas of [[Léon Walras]] that economics is essentially a mathematical science. Pareto was a leader of the "[[Lausanne School]]" and represents the second generation of the [[Neoclassical Revolution]].  His "tastes-and-obstacles" approach to [[general equilibrium theory]] was resurrected during the great "Paretian Revival" of the 1930s and has influenced theoretical economics since.&lt;ref&gt;Cirillo, Renato (1978) ''The Economics of Vilfredo Pareto''&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Manual of Political Economy'' (1906) the focus is on equilibrium in terms of solutions to individual problems of "objectives and constraints".  He used the indifference curve of Edgeworth (1881) extensively, for the theory of the consumer and, another great novelty, in his theory of the producer. He gave the first presentation of the trade-off box now known as the "Edgeworth-Bowley" box.&lt;ref&gt;Mclure, Michael (2001) [https://www.questia.com/read/102813057 ''Pareto, Economics and Society: The Mechanical Analogy''].&lt;/ref&gt;

Pareto was the first to realize that cardinal utility could be dispensed with and economic equilibrium thought of in terms of ordinal utility&lt;ref name=Aspers&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aspers|first=Patrik|title=Crossing the Boundary of Economics and Sociology: The Case of Vilfredo Pareto|journal=The American Journal of Economics and Sociology|date=April 2001|volume=60|issue=2|pages=519–45|jstor=3487932|doi=10.1111/1536-7150.00073}}&lt;/ref&gt; – that is, it was not necessary to know how much a person valued this or that, only that he preferred X of this to Y of that. Utility was a preference-ordering.  With this, Pareto not only inaugurated modern microeconomics, but he also demolished the alliance of economics and utilitarian philosophy (which calls for the greatest good for the greatest number; Pareto said "good" cannot be measured). He replaced it with the notion of ''[[Pareto efficiency|Pareto-optimality]]'', the idea that a system is enjoying maximum economic satisfaction when no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off.  Pareto optimality is widely used in welfare economics and game theory. A standard theorem is that a perfectly competitive market creates distributions of wealth that are Pareto optimal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00220485.1991.10844705|jstor=1182422|title=How Well Do We Know Pareto Optimality?|journal=The Journal of Economic Education|volume=22|issue=2|pages=172|year=2014|last1=Mathur|first1=Vijay K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concepts===
Some economic concepts in current use are based on his work:
* The [[Pareto index]] is a measure of the inequality of income distribution.
He argued that in all countries and times, the distribution of income and wealth is highly skewed, with a few holding most of the wealth.   He argued that all observed societies follow a regular logarithmic pattern:
#  &lt;math&gt;\log N = \log A + m \log x&lt;/math&gt;

where N is the number of people with wealth higher than x, and A and m are constants.  Over the years, Pareto's Law has proved remarkably close to observed data.
* The [[Pareto chart]] is a special type of [[histogram]], used to view causes of a problem in order of severity from largest to smallest. It is a statistical tool that graphically demonstrates the Pareto principle or the 80–20 rule.
* [[Pareto principle|Pareto's law]] concerns the distribution of income.
* The [[Pareto distribution]] is a [[probability distribution]] used, among other things, as a mathematical realization of Pareto's law.
* [[Ophelimity]] is a measure of purely economic satisfaction.

The '''Void type''', in several [[Curly bracket programming language|programming languages derived from C and Algol68]], is the [[type theory|type]] for the result of a [[function (computer science)|function]] that returns normally, but does not provide a result value to its caller.  Usually such functions are called for their [[Side effect (computer science)|side effects]], such as performing some task or writing to their output parameters. The usage of the void type in such context is comparable to [[Procedure (computer science)|procedures]] in [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]] and syntactic constructs which define [[subroutines]] in [[Visual Basic]]. It is also similar to the [[unit type]] used in [[functional programming languages]] and type theory.  See [[Unit type#In programming languages]] for a comparison.

[[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] also support the '''pointer to void type''' (specified as &lt;code&gt;void *&lt;/code&gt;), but this is an unrelated notion. Variables of this type are [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointer]]s to data of an ''unspecified'' type, so in this context (but not the others) &lt;code&gt;void *&lt;/code&gt; acts roughly like a universal or [[top type]]. A program can probably convert a pointer to any type of data (except a [[function pointer]]) to a pointer to void and back to the original type without losing information, which makes these pointers useful for [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphic]] functions. The C language standard does not guarantee that the different pointer types have the same size.

== In C and C++ ==

A function with void result type ends either by reaching the end of the function or by executing a [[return statement]] with no returned value. The void type may also appear as the sole [[Parameter (computer programming)|argument]] of a [[function prototype]] to indicate that the function takes no arguments. Note that despite the name, in all of these situations, the void type serves as a [[unit type]], not as a zero or [[bottom type]] (which 
is sometimes confusingly called the "void type"), even though unlike a real unit type which is a singleton, the void type lacks a way to represent its value and the language does not provide any way to declare an object or represent a value with type &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt;.

In the earliest versions of C, functions with no specific result defaulted to a return type of &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; and functions with no arguments simply had empty argument lists. Pointers to untyped data were declared as integers or pointers to &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;. Some early C [[compiler]]s had the feature, now seen as an annoyance, of generating a warning on any function call that did not use the function's returned value. Old code sometimes [[Type conversion|casts]] such function calls to void to suppress this warning.  By the time [[Bjarne Stroustrup]] began his work on [[C++]] in 1979–1980, void and void pointers were part of the C language dialect supported by AT&amp;T-derived compilers.&lt;ref&gt;http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/chist.html, "Standardisation."&lt;/ref&gt;

The explicit use of void vs. giving no arguments in a [[function prototype]] has different semantics in C and C++, as detailed in the following table:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Stroustrup | first = Bjarne | title = Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++| publisher = Addison-Wesley | location = Boston | year = 2009 | isbn = 0-321-54372-6 | page=996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
|  &lt;code&gt;void f();&lt;/code&gt; (''accepts a constant but unknown number of arguments'')

A C prototype taking no arguments, e.g. &lt;code&gt;void f()&lt;/code&gt; above, has been deprecated in [[C99]]&lt;ref&gt;Bjarne Stroustrup, ''[http://www.ddj.com/cpp/184401562 C and C++: Case Studies in Compatibility. Reconcilable differences? You decide]'', [[Dr. Dobb's]], September 01, 2002; [http://www.research.att.com/~bs/examples_short.pdf print version]&lt;/ref&gt;, however.

==In Haskell==

Quite contrary to C++, in the [[functional programming language]] [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] the void type denotes the empty type, which has no inhabitants [http://hackage.haskell.org/package/void]. A function into the void type does not return results, and a side-effectful program with type signature  &lt;code&gt;IO Void&lt;/code&gt;  does not terminate, or crashes. In particular, there are no [[total functions]] into the void type.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9404">A '''wallflower''' is someone with an [[Introversion|introverted]] personality type (or in more extreme cases, [[social anxiety]]) who will attend parties and social gatherings, but will usually distance themselves from the crowd and actively avoid being in the limelight.

The name itself derives from [[Wallflower|eponymous plant]]'s unusual growth pattern; against a wall as a stake or in cracks and gaps in stone walls. "Wallflowers" might literally stand against a wall and simply observe others at a social gathering, rather than mingle. This could be due to [[anxiety]], [[shyness]], lack of [[social skills]] or [[inferiority complex|self-esteem]].

Wallflower can also be used on a grander scale. When a company or organization chooses or is forced to remain on the sidelines of any activity, they can be referred to as a "wallflower".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/wallflower|title=the definition of wallflower|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Connection to Sociology ==

=== Structural function theory ===

[[Structural functionalism]] is a sociological theory that sees society as a number of complex parts that form a stable and functional whole. This leads to a strong and coherent family unit made of smaller parts, with the functioning family unit then going on to form the smaller parts of a wider community, society and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reference.com/world-view/example-structural-functionalism-83dd92e670a96efc#|title=What is an example of structural functionalism?|newspaper=Reference|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social conflict theory ===

[[Social conflict]] theory in [[sociology]] claims that society is in a state of perpetual conflict due to competition for limited resources. It holds that social order is maintained by domination and power, rather than consensus and conformity. According to conflict theory, those with wealth and power try to hold on to it by any means possible, chiefly by suppressing the poor and powerless.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conflict-theory.asp|title=Conflict Theory|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2013-07-10|newspaper=Investopedia|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Symbolic interaction theory ===
The most relevant sociological theory that the "wallflower" relates to, [[Symbolic interactionism|Symbolic Interaction]] describes specific gestures or [[Norm (social)|social norms]] that are symbolic in meaning. The theory consists of three core principles: meaning, language and thought. These core principles lead to conclusions about the creation of a person’s self and socialization into a larger community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.utwente.nl/cw/theorieenoverzicht/Theory%20Clusters/Interpersonal%20Communication%20and%20Relations/Symbolic_Interactionism/|title=Symbolic Interactionism|website=www.utwente.nl|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the "wallflower" will usually exhibit a ''lack of'' interaction with others, it becomes symbolic of their thoughts and feelings towards others. The most specific example would be in the [[body language]]. Many times people who are shy have little or no eye contact with others. You may see a man, woman, or child try to avoid eye contact with others while out walking around in public or even in private. For some this may be a condition that becomes consistent over time and become a normal action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://readingbodylanguagenow.com/shyness/|title=Body language of shyness – Body language expert, reading body language, read body language of men and women|website=readingbodylanguagenow.com|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of parties or social gatherings, the "wallflower" will remain at a certain distance from the crowd or most of the people. When a shy person is around others you may see that they do what they can to stay away from the people that they do not know. Even with some friends you may or may not see the shy man or woman even near or in the Bell Bubble or within the intimate distance of friends. In a social setting you may not see a shy person in the center of the room without a friend or group of friends. Shy people tend to stay out of the possibility of even being the center of attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://readingbodylanguagenow.com/shyness/|title=Body language of shyness – Body language expert, reading body language, read body language of men and women|website=readingbodylanguagenow.com|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social anxiety ===
[[Social anxiety disorder|Social anxiety]] the extreme fear of being scrutinized and judged by others in social or performance situations: Social anxiety disorder can wreak havoc on the lives of those who suffer from it. This disorder is ''not'' simply shyness that has been inappropriately medicated. Symptoms may be so extreme that they disrupt daily life. People with this disorder, also called ''[[Social Phobia|social phobia]]'', may have few or no social or romantic relationships, making them feel powerless, alone, or even ashamed.

Although they recognize that the fear is excessive and unreasonable, people with social anxiety disorder feel powerless against their anxiety. They are terrified they will humiliate or embarrass themselves.The anxiety can interfere significantly with daily routines, occupational performance, or social life, making it difficult to complete school, interview and get a job, and have friendships and romantic relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/social-anxiety-disorder|title=Social Anxiety Disorder {{!}} Anxiety and Depression Association of America, ADAA|website=www.adaa.org|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being a wallflower can be considered a less-intense form of social anxiety. A person with social anxiety may feel a sense of hesitation in large crowds, and may even have a sense of panic if forced to become the center of attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.healthcentral.com/anxiety/c/22705/98818/fear-crowds/|title=Fear of Crowds - Phobias - Anxiety|website=www.healthcentral.com|access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fear may cause them to do something as minor as stand away from the center of a party, but it may also cause a major or minor anxiety attack.

People with social anxiety disorder do not believe that their anxiety is related to a medical or physical illness or disease. This type of anxiety occurs in most social situations, especially when the person feels on display or is the center of attention. Once a person avoids almost all social and public interactions we say the person has an extreme case of social anxiety disorder, more commonly called [[Avoidant personality disorder|Avoidant Personality Disorder]].  As you would expect, people with social anxiety disorder have an elevated rate of relationship difficulties and [[substance abuse]].

=== Panic and anxiety attacks ===
[[Panic attack|Anxiety attacks]] are a combination of physical and mental symptoms that are intense and overwhelming. The anxiety is, however, more than just regular nervousness. Symptoms of anxiety attacks and panic attacks mimic serious medical issues, such as:

* [[Myocardial infarction|Heart attacks]] and [[heart failure]].
* [[Brain tumor]]s.
* [[Multiple sclerosis]].
Despite their intensity, anxiety attacks are generally not life-threatening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.calmclinic.com/anxiety/attacks/symptoms-and-signs|title=Signs and Symptoms of Anxiety Attacks|website=www.calmclinic.com|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40886">The existence of a '''wood economy''', or more broadly, a '''forest economy''' (since in many countries a [[bamboo economy]] predominates), is a prominent matter in many [[developing countries]] as well as in many other nations with temperate climate and especially in those with [[Boreal climate|low temperatures]]. These are generally the countries with greater [[forest]]ed areas. The uses of wood in furniture, buildings, bridges, and as a source of energy are widely known. Additionally, wood from [[tree]]s and [[Shrub|bushes]], can be employed in a wide variety, including those produced from [[wood pulp]], as [[cellulose]] in paper, [[celluloid]] in early [[photographic]] film, [[cellophane]], and [[rayon]] (a substitute for silk).

At the end of their normal usage, wood products can be burnt to obtain [[thermal energy]], or can be used as a [[fertilizer]]. The potential environmental damage that a wood economy could occasion include (problems of reduction the [[biodiversity]] due to [[monoculture]] forestry—the intensive cultivation of very few types of trees); and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. However, forests can aid in reduction of atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] and therefore decrease [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forestadaptation2008.net/home/en/|title=Adaptation of Forests and Forest Management to Changing Climate with Emphasis on Forest Health: a Review of Science, Policies, and Practices.

== Introduction ==

=== History of use of wood ===
The wood economy is historically the starting point of the [[civilization]]s worldwide, since eras preceding the [[Paleolithic]] and the [[Neolithic]]. It necessarily preceded [[Bronze Age|ages of metals]] by many millenia, as the melting of metals was possible only through the discovery of techniques to light [[fire]] (usually obtained by the scraping of two very dry wooden rods) and the building of many [[simple machine]]s and rudimentary tools, as canes, club handles, [[Bow (weapon)|bows]], [[arrow]]s, [[lance]]s. One of the most ancient handmade articles ever found is one smoothed pricked of wood (Clacton Spear) 250,000 years old (third interglacial period), that was buried under sediments in England, at [[Clacton-on-Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Tecnologia Dalle Origini al 2000, pag. 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Clacton Spear |publisher=[[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] |url=http://piclib.nhm.ac.uk/results.asp?image=001066 |accessdate=2012-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028210420/http://piclib.nhm.ac.uk/results.asp?image=001066 |archivedate=October 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Successive civilizations such as the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] and [[Sumer|Sumerians]] built sophisticated [[Furniture|objects of furniture]]. Many types of furniture in [[ivory]] and valuable woods have survived to our time practically intact, because secluded in inviolated secret tombs, they were protected from decay also by the dry environment of desert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/gpkillen/history.htm |title=History of Egyptian Furniture |date=27 October 2009 |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027112058/http://geocities.com/gpkillen/history.htm |archivedate=27 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many buildings and parts of these (above all roofs) contained elements in wood (often of [[oak]]) forming structural supports and covering; means of transport such as boats, ships; and later (with the invention of the [[wheel]]) wagons and carriages, winches, flour mills powered by water, etc.

=== Dimensions and geography ===
The main source of the lumber used in the world is [[forest]]s, which can be classified as [[Virgin forest|virgin]], [[Semivirgin forests|semivirgin]] and [[Plantation#Forestry|plantations]]. Much [[timber]] is removed for [[firewood]] by local populations in many countries, especially in the [[third world]], but this amount can only be estimated, with wide margins of uncertainty.

In 1998, the worldwide production of "roundwood" (officially counted wood not used as firewood), was about {{convert|1,500,000,000|m3|cuyd}}, amounting to around 45% of the wood cultivated in the world. Cut logs and branches destined to become elements for building construction accounted for approximately 55% of the world's [[wood industry|industrial]] [[wood production]]. 25% became [[wood pulp]] (including wood powder and truccioli) mainly destined for the production of [[paper]] and [[paperboard]], and approximately 20% became panels in [[plywood]] and valuable wood for furnitures and objects of common use (FAO 1998).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unece.org/trade/timber/mis/energy/output.htm#2007 FAO 1998] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724193223/http://www.unece.org/trade/timber/mis/energy/output.htm#2007 |date=July 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The World's largest producer and consumer of officially accounted wood is the United States, although the country that possesses the greatest area of forest is Russia.

In the 1970s, the countries with the largest forest area were: [[Soviet Union]] (approximately 8,800,000&amp;nbsp;km²), [[Brazil]] (5,150,000&amp;nbsp;km²), Canada (4,400,000&amp;nbsp;km²), United States (3,000,000&amp;nbsp;km²), [[Indonesia]] (1,200,000&amp;nbsp;km²) and [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] (1,000,000&amp;nbsp;km²). Other countries with important production and consumption of wood usually have a low [[density of population]] in relation to their territorial extension, here we can include countries as [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Finland]], [[Poland]], Sweden, [[Ukraine]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

By 2001 the [[rainforest]] areas of Brazil were [[Deforestation in Brazil|reduced by a fifth]] (respect of 1970), to around 4,000,000&amp;nbsp;km²; the ground cleared was mainly destined for cattle [[pasture]]—Brazil is the world's largest exporter of [[beef]] with almost 200,000,000 head of cattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0625-amazon_beef.html|title=Brazil seizes cattle illegally grazing on Amazon forest lands|publisher=|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The booming Brazilian [[ethanol economy]] based upon [[sugar cane]] cultivation, is likewise reducing forests area. Canadian forest was reduced by almost 30% to 3,101,340&amp;nbsp;km² over the same period.&lt;ref name="Canadian Forests - Quick Facts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadian-forests.com/canadian_forests_quick_facts.htm|title=Canadian Forests - Quick Facts|publisher=|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Importance in fighting greenhouse effect ===
Regarding the problem of climate change, it is known that burning forests increase CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in atmosphere, while intact virgin forest or plantations act as sinks for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, for these reasons wood economy fights [[greenhouse effect]]. The amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; absorbed depends on the type of trees, lands and the climate of the place where trees naturally grow or are planted. Moreover, by night plants do not [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]], and produce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, eliminated the successive day. Paradoxically in summer [[oxygen]] created by photosynthesis in forests near to cities and urban parks, interacts with urban [[air pollution]] (from cars, etc.) and is transformed by solar beams in [[ozone]] (molecule of three oxygen atoms), that while in high atmosphere constitutes a filter against [[ultraviolet]] beams, in the low atmosphere is a pollutant, able to provoke respiratory disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/maps/ozone/welcome|title=Air quality levels in Europe — European Environment Agency|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlunghealth.org/healthy_living/pollution/outdoor/effects|title=YourLungHealth.org - The Effects of Ozone Pollution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[low-carbon economy]], forestry operations will be focused on low-impact practices and regrowth.  Forest managers will make sure that they do not disturb soil based carbon reserves too much. Specialized tree farms will be the main source of material for many products.  Quick maturing tree varieties will be grown on short rotations in order to maximize output.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woodland-trust.org.uk/campaigns/briefingsmore/carbonmgt.htm Trees and their role in carbon management for land and business] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927190041/http://www.woodland-trust.org.uk/campaigns/briefingsmore/carbonmgt.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}, The Woodland Trust.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Per nation/continental area ==

=== In Australia ===
* [[Eucalyptus]]: these are seven hundred tree species from Australia, that grow very fast in tropical, sub-tropical and semi-arid climates, and are very resistant to forest fires (with their tree cortex) and drought. Its [[essential oil]] is used in pharmacology, its wood for building, and the small branches as firewood and pulpwood.

=== In Brazil ===
[[Brazil]] has a long tradition in the harvesting of several types of trees with specific uses. Since the 1960s, imported species of pine tree and eucalyptus have been grown mostly for the [[plywood]] and [[pulp and paper industry|paper pulp industries]]. Currently high-level research is being conducted, to apply the enzymes of [[sugar cane]] fermentation to cellulose in wood, in order to obtain [[methanol]], but the cost is much higher when compared with ethanol derived from [[maize|corn]] costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brazzilmag.com/content/view/8280/54|title=Brazzil Mag - Trying to understand Brazil since 1989|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Brazilwood]]: has a dense, orange-red heartwood that takes a high red shine (brasa=ember), and it is the premier wood used for making bows for string instruments from the [[violin]] family. These trees soon became the biggest source of [[red]] [[dye]], and they were such a large part of the economy and export of that country, that slowly it was known as Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forestryencyclopedia.jot.com/WikiHome/Harvesting%20Wood%20in%20Brazil|title=Harvesting wood in Brazil|publisher=|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hevea brasiliensis]]: is the biggest source of the best [[latex]], that is used to manufacture many objects in [[rubber]],  as an example [[gloves]], [[condom]]s, anti-allergic [[mattress]]es and [[tires]] (vulcanized rubber). Latex has the ability to adjust to the exact shape of the body part, an advantage over [[polyurethane]] or [[polyethylene]] gloves.

=== In Canada and the US ===
There is a close relation in the forestry economy between these countries; they have many tree genera in common, and Canada is the main producer of wood and wooden items destined to the US, the biggest consumer of wood and its byproducts in the world. The water systems of the [[Great Lakes]], [[Erie Canal]], [[Hudson River]] and [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] to the east coast and the [[Mississippi River]] to the central plains and [[Louisiana]] allows transportation of logs at very low costs. On the [[West Coast of the United States|west coast]], the basin of the [[Columbia River]] has plenty of forests with excellent timber.

==== Canada ====
The agency Canada Wood  Council calculates that in the year 2005 in Canada, the forest sector employed 930,000 workers (1 job in every 17), making around $108 billion of value in goods and services. For many years products derived from trees in Canadian forests had been the most important export items of the country. In 2011, exports around the world totaled some $64.3 billion – the single largest contributor to Canadian trade balance.&lt;ref name="Canadian Forests - Quick Facts" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wood-works.org|title=Wood-Works - Program of the Canadian Wood Council|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada is the world leader in [[sustainable forest management]] practices. Only {{convert|120000000|ha|km2 sqmi|-1}} (28% of Canadian forests) are currently managed for timber production while an estimated {{convert|32000000|ha|km2 sqmi|-1}} are protected from harvesting by the current legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadian-forests.com|title=Canadian Forests Website - Home Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cedar oil and wood is known to be a natural repellent to moths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~nodice/new/magazine/cedar/cedar.htm|title=Cedarwood Oils|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actually are planted in western and southern US, mostly for ornamental purposes, but also for the production of [[pencil]]s (specially [[incense-cedar]]).
* [[Douglas fir]]: a native tree of the United States [[West Coast of the United States|west coast]] and [[Mountain States|mountain states]], with records in fast growth and high statures in brief time. The [[Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii|coast Douglas fir]] grows in coastal regions up to altitudes of about 1,800 meters; the [[Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca|Rocky Mountain Douglas fir]] grows farther inland, at altitudes ranging from 800 m to 3,000 m or higher. The wood is used for construction, for [[homebuilt aircraft]], for paper pulp, and also as [[firewood]].
* [[Hybrid poplar]] is being investigated by [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in [[Tennessee]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioenergy.ornl.gov/papers/misc/trees.html|title=Biofuels from Trees: Renewable Energy Research Branches Out|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osti.gov/scitech/biblio/5051|title=A National Assessment of Promising Areas for Switchgrass, Hybrid Poplar, or Willow Energy Crop Production|first1=R.

* [[Walnut]]: a prized furniture and carving hardwood because of its colour, hardness, grain and durability. Walnut wood has been the timber of choice for gun makers for centuries. It remains one of the most popular choices for rifle and shotgun stocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walnutcouncil.org|title=Walnut Council--Growing Walnut and Other Fine Hardwoods|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the Caribbean and Central America ===
* [[Mahogany]]: has a straight grain, usually free of voids and pockets. The most prized species come from [[Cuba]] and [[Honduras]]. It has a reddish-brown color, which darkens over time, and displays a beautiful reddish sheen when polished. It has excellent workability, is available in big boards, and is very durable. Mahogany is used in the making of many musical instruments, as [[drum]]s, acoustic and electric [[guitar]]s' back and side, and luxury [[headphone]]s.

=== In Europe ===

==== Italy ====
The species that are ideal for the many uses in this type of economy are those employed by [[arboriculture]], that are very well known for their features and the need for certain types of ground and climates.
* [[Fraxinus]]: being a lightweight wood is easy to transport, as firewood burns easily, grows in damp environments like those present in river flooding areas, stands pollution of water and air.
* [[Larix]]: in Italy it grows at high altitudes around mountain tops, its timber stand sudden climatic change, from icy winds to high temperatures in sunny afternoon summers, it is excellent for use in the building of exposed structures as bridges, roofs, etc.
* [[Stone pine]]: "Mediterranean pine" could be the noble emblem of many coastal areas in Italy, originally giant forests of pines extended from the mouth of the [[Tiber]] river until [[Liguria]] and [[Provence]] in France, over soils with high [[salinity]], not very apt for agriculture. Its trees produce a vast amount of dry branches that can be burnt, [[Pine cone|cones]] (used for Christmas decoration) and needle-like foliage that can be burnt, or used as [[mulch]]. Oils and resins can be used in [[scent]]s and [[ointments]]. The [[pinoli]] are useful elements in Italian cooking (along with [[basil]] are tritured to make [[pesto]] sauce). Currently, "progress" has brought to a severe reduction of this magnificent tree extensions, and in many places cheap beach buildings, car-parking and semi-abandoned areas have taken their place.
* [[Populus|Poplar]]: in Italy is the most important species for tree plantations, is used for several purposes as [[plywood]] manufacture, packing boxes, paper, [[match]]es, etc. It needs good quality grounds with good drainage, but can be used to protect the cultivations if disposed in [[windbreak]] lines. More than 70% of Italian poplar cultivations are located in the [[pianura Padana]]. Constantly the extension of the cultivation is being reduced, from 650&amp;nbsp;km² in the 1980s to current 350&amp;nbsp;km². The yield of poplars is about 1,500 t/km² of wood every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federlegno.it/tool/home.php?s=0,1,29,37,417,1042,1043|title=Federlegno - Italian federation of wood producers and industry|publisher=|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production from poplars is around 45–50% of the total Italian wood production.&lt;ref&gt;Fonte:http://www.federlegno.it/tool/home.php?s=0,1,29,37,417,1042&lt;/ref&gt;
** In the [[history of art]] poplar was the wood of choice for painting surfaces as panels, as in [[Renaissance]] (The [[Mona Lisa]] by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]). Because of this reason, many of the products with the highest [[added value]], extremely expensive, are made with wood from the humble but durable poplar.
** Because of the presence of [[tannic acid]], poplar cortex was often used in Europe for the [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] of [[leather]].

==== Portugal ====
* [[Cork oak|Oak]] for [[Cork (material)|cork]]: are trees with a slow growth, but long life, are cultivated in warm hill areas (min. temp. &gt; -5°Celsius) in all the west area of [[Mediterranean]] shores. Cork is popular as a material for [[bulletin board]]s. Even if the production as [[Stopper (plug)|stopper]]s for wine bottles is diminishing in favor of [[nylon]] stoppers, in the sake of energy saving granules of cork can be mixed into [[concrete]]. These composites have low thermal conductivity, low density and good energy absorption (earthquake resistant). Some of the property ranges of the composites are density (400–1500&amp;nbsp;kg/m³), compressive strength (1–26 MPa) and flexural strength (0.5–4.0&amp;nbsp;MPa).&lt;ref&gt;Karade SR. 2003. An Investigation of Cork Cement Composites. PhD Thesis. BCUC. Brunel University, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this cork can be used as [[Thermal conductivity|thermal isolation]] in buildings (as well in its natural form and as a mixture), useful also as [[sound insulation]]. In the [[shoe]] industry cork is used for [[Shoe#Sole|sole]]s and [[insole]]s. In the world there are 20,000&amp;nbsp;km² of cork oak plantations, and every year are extracted around 300,000 tons of cork, 50% in [[Portugal]], 15,000 in Italy (12,000 in the island of [[Sardinia]]). The advantage of this natural industry is that the extraction of cork from layers outer to the [[cortex (botany)|cortex]] does not kill the tree.

=== In Scandinavia and Russia ===
In Sweden, Finland and to an extent Norway, much of the land area is forested, the pulp and paper industry is one of the most significant industrial sectors. Chemical pulping produces an excess of energy, since the organic matter in [[black liquor]], mostly [[lignin]] and [[hemicellulose]] breakdown products, is burned in the [[recovery boiler]]. Thus, these countries have high proportions of renewable energy use (25% in Finland, for instance). Considerable effort is directed towards increasing the value and usage of forest products by companies and by government projects.

* [[Scots pine]] and [[Norway spruce]]: These species comprise most of boreal forest, and together as a softwood mixture they are converted chemical pulp for paper.
* [[Birch]]: is a genus with many species of trees from [[Scandinavia]] and Russia, excellent for acid grounds. They act as [[pioneer species]] in the frozen border between [[taiga]] and [[tundra]], are very resistant to periods of [[drought]] and [[icy condition]]s. The species [[Betula nana]] has been identified as the ideal tree for the acid grounds of the sides of sloped mountains, also in southern Europe, with soils poor in nutrients, where these trees can be used to restrain [[landslide]]s. [[Dissolving pulp]] is produced from birch. [[Xylitol]] can be produced by hydrogenation of [[xylose]], which is a byproduct of chemical pulping of birch.

&lt;!--
Nessuna di queste specie sottrae terreni pregiati o particolarmente fertili all'agricoltura, ma, al contrario, contribuiscono a proteggere i suoli coltivati dall'erosione e dai venti. Nonostante questa caratteristica positiva in Italia, da secoli si assiste alla progressiva riduzione della presenza degli alberi nei terreni circostanti le colture con la conseguenza che l'eccesso di acqua meteorica non viene adeguatemente trattenuto e si possano verificare, quando succedono piogge abbondanti, catastrofiche [[alluvioni]].

== Uses of wood ==
{{Further information|Wood#Uses}}

== Combustion ==
{{main article|Wood fuel}}
The [[combustion|burning]] of wood is currently the largest use of [[energy]] derived from a [[solid fuel]] [[biomass]]. Wood fuel may be available as [[firewood]] (e.g. logs, bolts, blocks), [[charcoal]], chips, sheets, [[wood pellets|pellets]] and [[sawdust]]. Wood fuel can be used for [[cooking]] and [[heating]] through [[stove]]s and [[fireplace]]s, and occasionally for fueling [[steam engine]]s and steam [[turbines]] that [[electricity generation|generate electricity]]. For many centuries many types of traditional [[oven]]s were used in order to benefit from the heat generated by wood combustion. Now, more efficient and clean solutions have been developed: advanced [[fireplace]]s (with [[heat exchanger]]s), [[wood-fired oven]]s,  [[wood-burning stove]]s and [[pellet stove]]s, that are able to filter and separate pollutants (centrifuging [[wood ash|ash]]es with rotative filters), thus eliminating many emissions, also allowing to recover a higher quantity of heat that escaped with the [[chimney]] fumes.

Mean [[energy density]] of [[Wood]], was calculated at around 6–17 [[Megajoule]]/[[Kilogram]], depending on species and moisture content.

Combustion of wood is, however, linked to the production of micro-environmental pollutants, as [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) (an invisible gas able to provoke irreversible saturation of [[blood]]'s [[hemoglobine]]), as well as [[nanoparticles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olivares G, Ström J, Johansson C, Gidhagen L |title=Estimates of black carbon and size-resolved particle number emission factors from residential wood burning based on ambient monitoring and model simulations |journal=J Air Waste Manag Assoc |volume=58 |issue=6 |pages=838–48 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18581814 |doi=10.3155/1047-3289.58.6.838 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy [[Populus|poplar]] has been proposed as a tree cultivated to be transformed into [[biofuel]]s, because of the excellent ratio of energy extracted from its wood because of poplar's fast growing and capture of atmospheric carbon dioxide to the small amount of energy needed to cultivate, cut and transport the trees. ''Populus x canadensis'' 'I-214', grows so fast that is able to reach {{convert|14|in|cm}} in diameter and heights of {{convert|100|ft|m}} in ten years.

=== Charcoal ===
{{main article|Charcoal}}
Charcoal is the dark grey residue consisting of impure [[carbon]] obtained by removing water and other volatile constituents from [[animal]] and [[vegetation]] substances.  Charcoal is usually produced by slow [[pyrolysis]], the heating of [[wood]] or other substances in the absence of [[oxygen]]. Charcoal can then be used as a fuel with a higher combustion temperature.

=== Wood gasogen ===
[[Wood gas generator]] (gasogen): is a bulky and heavy device (but technically simple) that transforms burning wood in a mix of molecular [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[carbon monoxide]] (CO), [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), molecular [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and water vapor (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). This gas mixture, known as "[[wood gas]]", "poor gas" or "[[syngas]]" is obtained after the [[combustion]] of dry wood in a [[redox|reductive environment]] (low in [[oxygen]]) with a limited amount of atmospheric air, at temperatures of 900° Celsius, and can fuel an [[internal combustion engine]].&lt;ref&gt;UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE [https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/dspace/bitstream/1957/1569/1/FPL_1463ocr.pdf Gasogens Report] (Original report dated 1944): now in the possession of the University of Wisconsin&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gasogenog.jpg|thumb|300px|A car built in the 1940s by [[Ilario Bandini]], with a wood gas generator device.]]

In the time between World War I and [[World War II]] included, because of the lack of [[oil]], in many countries, like Italy, France, [[Great Britain]] and Sweden, several [[gasoline]]-powered cars were modified, with the addition of a [[wood gas generator]] (a "''gasogen''"), a device powered by wood, coal, or burnable waste, able to produce (and purify) gas that immediately, in the same vehicle, could power a slightly modified [[Internal combustion engine|ICE]] [[engine]] of a standard car (low-compression engine). [[Carburetor]] had to be changed with an air-gas [[Mixer (engine)|mixer]]). There were several setbacks, as the great reduction of maximum speed and the need to drive using low [[gear]]s and wisely dosing the amount of air. In modern cars, modified with a wood gas generator, gas emissions (CO, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NOx) are lower to those of the same vehicle running with gasoline (keeping the same [[catalytic converter]]).

===Methanol===
{{Main article|Methanol economy}}
[[Methanol]] (the simplest [[alcohol]]) behaves as a liquid at 25&amp;nbsp;°C, is toxic and  corrosive, and in [[organic chemistry]] basic books is often called "the spirit of wood", since it can be obtained from wood [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]]. Rarely, when unwise [[wine]]-makers mix small chunks of wood and leaves with grapes, methanol can be found as a pollutant of the blend of water, [[ethanol]] and other substances derived from [[grape]]'s fermentation.

The best way to obtain methanol from wood is through [[syngas]] (CO, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) produced by the [[anhydrous]] [[pyrolysis]] of wood, a method discovered by [[ancient Egypt]]ians.

Methanol can be used as an oxygen-rich additive for [[gasoline]]. However, it is usually much cheaper to produce methanol from [[methane]] or from syngas.  Methanol is the most important base material for industrial chemistry, where it is often used to make more complex molecules through reactions of [[halogenation]] and chemical [[addition reaction]].

===Gas turbine===

====Tanks====
The American [[M1 Abrams]] [[main battle tank]] is powered by a [[gas turbine]] of {{convert|1500|hp|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www51.honeywell.com/aero/common/documents/myaerospacecatalog-documents/SurfaceSystems/AGT1500_Turbine_Technology.pdf |title=AGT1500 Turbine Technology on Honeywell.com |publisher= |accessdate=13 May 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909103204/http://www51.honeywell.com/aero/common/documents/myaerospacecatalog-documents/SurfaceSystems/AGT1500_Turbine_Technology.pdf |archivedate=9 September 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that it is able to function also with a mix at 50% of wood powder and [[biodiesel]], [[diesel fuel]] or [[kerosene]]. Its advantages over [[Turbocharger|turbo]]-[[diesel engine]], are the small size and light weight, the lack of a [[radiator]] (which gives an advantage against the effect of gun and cannon shots and missile strikes suffered in battle). A setback is the high fuel consumption, since the turbine engine has not the ability to work at a low revolutions per minute rate, much lower than ideal, and during the march this engine consumes twice as much fuel as a modern turbo-diesel engine with [[intercooler]] and [[Fuel injection|direct injection]].

==Construction==
{{main article|Lumber}}
Wood is relatively light in weight, because its [[specific weight]] is less than 500&amp;nbsp;kg/m³, this is an advantage,  when compared against 2,000-2,500&amp;nbsp;kg/m³ for [[armed concrete]] or 7,800&amp;nbsp;kg/m³ for [[steel]].

Wood is strong, because the efficiency of wood for structural purposes has qualities that are similar to steel.

===Bridges, levees, microhydro, piers===
Wood is used to build bridges (as the [[Magere Brug|Magere bridge]] in [[Amsterdam]]), as well as water and air mills, and [[microhydro]] generators for electricity.

===Housing===
[[Hardwood]] is used as a material in [[lumber|wooden]] [[house]]s, and other structures with a broad range of dimensions. In traditional homes wood is preferred for [[ceiling]]s, [[door]]s, [[flooring]]s and [[window]]s. Wooden [[Framing (construction)|frame]]s were traditionally used for home ceilings, but they risk collapse during fires.

The development of [[Efficient energy use|energy efficient]] houses including the "[[passive house]]" has revamped the importance of wood in construction, because wood provides acoustic and thermal [[Building insulation|insulation]], with much better results than concrete.

====Earthquake resistant buildings====
In Japan, ancient buildings, of relatively high elevation, like [[pagoda]]s, historically had shown to be able to resist [[earthquake]]s of high [[Seismic scale|intensity]], thanks to the traditional building techniques, employing elastic [[Kinematic pair|joint]]s, and to the excellent ability of wooden frames to elastically deform and absorb severe [[peak ground acceleration|acceleration]]s and [[compression (physical)|compressive]] shocks.

In 2006, Italian scientists from [[Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche|CNR]] patented&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.girodivite.it/Terremoti-dal-Cnr-arriva-il.html|title=Girodivite: Terremoti: dal Cnr arriva il palazzo antisismico|first=|last=Girodivite.it|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a building system that they called "[[SOFIE]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.progettosofie.it PROGETTOSOFIE: Edificio Antisismico in Legno]&lt;/ref&gt; a seven-[[storey]] wooden building, 24 meters high, built by the "Istituto per la valorizzazione del legno e delle specie arboree" (Ivalsa) of [[San Michele all'Adige]]. In 2007 it was tested with the hardest Japanese [[Earthquake engineering|antiseismic]] test for civil structures: the simulation of [[Great Hanshin earthquake|Kobe's earthquake]] (7.2 [[Richter scale]]), with the building placed over an enormous oscillating platform belonging to the NIED-Institute, located in [[Tsukuba]] science park, near the city of [[Miki, Hyogo|Miki]] in Japan. This Italian project, employed very thin and flexible panels in [[glued laminated timber]], and according to CNR researchers could brought to the construction of much more safe houses in seismic areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/SoleOnLine4/Italia/2009/04/cnr-progetto-casa-legno-anti-sisma.shtml?uuid=222999a2-241a-11de-bdf4-e9c9b14e9445&amp;DocRulesView=Libero|title=Dalla ricerca italiana la casa &amp;nbsp;di legno che resiste al terremoto - Il Sole 24 ORE|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shipbuilding ===
One of the most enduring materials is the lumber from [[virginia]]n [[Quercus virginiana|southern live oak]] and [[white oak]], specially live oak is 60% stronger than white oak and more resistant to moisture. As an example, the main component in the structure of battle ship [[USS Constitution]], the world's oldest commissioned naval vessel afloat (launched in 1797) is white oak.&lt;ref name="Victory"&gt;{{cite web

== History of crisis in wood economies ==

===Classical Greece===
One of the most famous [[crisis]] of a wood-based economy is what happened in [[Classical Greece]], where trees began to disappear specially in the areas of [[Attica]], [[Boeotia]] and [[Peloponnesus]] where indiscriminate cutting of trees for several uses, associated to drought and [[wildfire]]s led to a severe lack of timber in order to build lances, shields, ships, etc. and to a slow but progressive weakening in military and naval power of the peninsular kingdoms in Greece, that were overwhelmed by [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]] and by the [[Kingdom of Macedon]], much more fertile lands because of their rainy winters. This process arrived to the apex with the conquest of Greece by [[Phillip II of Macedon]].

The secret weapon of the [[Sarissaphoros]] soldiers (supported by [[peltast]] javelineers), commanded by Philipp II in the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)]] and in those that followed fought by [[Alexander the Great]] (which brought to the conquest of [[Lesser Asia]], [[Babylon]], [[Persia]] and [[Egypt]]), was the [[sarissa]], a type of [[Pike (weapon)|pike]], longer and stronger (5–7 m.) than the other Greek [[lance]]s, obtained from the heavy and strong [[European Cornel|cornel wood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ardeavalpometto.org/parco_boschi.html|title=Parco Naturale Valpometto - I boschi di casa nostra|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rapa Nui===
{{Dispute|date=July 2017}}
[[History of Easter Island#Pre-European society|Rapa Nui]], best known as "Easter Island", is a typical example of [[malthusianism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/27864/1/WP117.pdf|title=Why Easter Island Collapsed: An Answer for an Enduring Question|publisher=|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically how the [[exponential growth]] of a populace leads to the end of a [[renewable resource]]. At a certain point, the compelling societal need forces exploitation of the resource above and beyond the resource's natural rate of renewal.

It has been calculated &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/eterms/qt/easter_island.htm|title=What Has Science Learned about the People Who Settled Easter Island?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that after the year 1000, around 10 million [[palmtree]]s were cut in Rapa Nui, resulting in the [[erosion]] of the fertile land, and eventually to a [[desertification]] around the 15th century. (This deforestation may have also been aggravated and/or caused by a rat [[infestation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/discoveries/2005-12-05-easter-island_x.htm|title=USATODAY.com - Did Easter Island get 'ratted' out?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This provoked a population reduction from 15,000 to 2,500 individuals. Without palmtree wood, no boats, or lances could be constructed. Without palm fibers, construction of ropes and fishing nets halted.  This led to a decrease in the local fish harvest, which in turn led to a decrease in the quantity of dietary protein available to the island's inhabitants.  At the end, the society became an easy prey for [[hunger]] and [[civil war]].  From 1600 to 1700, the people became superstitious in a fanatical way. In the last moments, there was a disintegration of [[society]] and total chaos. The destruction of the traditional symbols followed, leading to the eventual extinction of the [[Moai]]s [[civilization]] and [[culture]], even if there was not any external human enemy.
