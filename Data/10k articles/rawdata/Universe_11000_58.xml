      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11964">The '''Guanabara Bay oil spill''', one of three major spills in the bay, occurred in January 2000 in Brazil when a leaking pipeline released {{convert|1,300,000|l| gal}} of oil into [[Guanabara Bay]]. It leaked from the [[oil refinery]] at [[Duque de Caxias]] (REDUC) operated by [[Petrobras]].  Petrobas the company at the center of the oil spill immediately moved into gear and hired a cleanup crew to assess the damages and start the process to cleaning up the affected areas.  This catastrophic accident had a damaging effect on marine life in the ocean, fishes, as well as, other existing areas surrounding the bay area.    Many fishes were washing up on the shore dead or covered in oil.  The fishing industry took a nose dive and the fishermen's livelihood was gravely affected.  As a matter of fact, the fishing industry was brought to a halt giving rise to economic downfall.  There was astronomical cost to be incurred with the clean-up process and the stakeholders were in a state of growing panic.Large areas of [[mangrove]] forests were killed and had not grown back ten years later.&lt;!-- need better ref here: &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/americas/2010/07/07/effects-brazilian-oil-spill-10-years | first=Gabriel | last=Elizondo | title= Effects of a Brazilian oil spill 10 years on | publisher=The Americas Blog, Aljazeera.net | accessdate=2010-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; The [[tucuxi]] (''Sotalia fluviatilis'') dolphin species inhabit the bay but were able to avoid the primary effects of the oil spill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iosc.org/papers_posters/IOSC%202003%20a468.pdf|title=Guanabara Bay oil spill 2000, Brazil - Cetacean response|last=Short |first=Michael |publisher=International Oil Spill Conference| year = 2003|accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oil spill was a catalyst for the passage of new [[environmental law]] in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/oem/docs/oil/fss/fss02/taampaper.pdf|title=The Guanabara Bay Oil Spill Incident – "The Brazilian Exxon Valdez" An Institutional Perspective|last=Taam|first=Mauricio|date=n.d.|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]|accessdate=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
There were affects to society and to the marine life and environment at large. The fishing industry suffered tremendously.  The fishes and crabs could not get oxygen and as a result, they succumbed to death.&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Business Review on Greening Your Business Profitably. Boston, Mass: Harvard

Standard - Freeholder: 8. Jul 26 2000. 
         ABI/INFORM Complete; OxResearch; ProQuest Central; ProQuest Criminal Justice; ProQuest Education Journals; 
         ProQuest Health Management; ProQuest Research Library; ProQuest Social Science Journals. Web. 5 Mar. 2013 .&lt;/ref&gt; One major concern that the fishermen had was concerning the fish that survived the oil spill.  They had no aquatic plants to feed because the plant life in the ocean became none existent as the oil settle itself on the ocean surface.  The fishermen, who relied on fishing for their livelihood, could not have a catch to depend on, and soon the industry resorted to lost of employment for fishermen, trading lost among crab vendors, and loss of revenue for families who depended on fishing as their primary means of survival.  Even a decade of efforts by the Petrobras refinery was not enough to restore the Bay to its original condition.

==Clean-up costs==
The cost of the clean-up and the drastic effect the spill had on the fishing industry remained for many years to come.  The Petrobras refinery who were responsible for the spill in the first place, accepted liabilities and promised to execute the cleanup process.  Among the affected areas were the beaches, mangrove mashes, and the surrounding areas leading to the beach front (pathways and tunnels).  There were also, dead birds and fishers along the shoreline of the front.  The actual cleanup process cost Petrobras over $100,000,000.  The process of recovery, environmental cleaning and compensation for damages took a significant toll on the company’s expenditures, which resulted in great profit loss for Petrobras.  Their years of efforts was overwhelming, but the result did little to justify the labor extended to the task.

==Economical impact of the Guanabara Bay Oil Spill on Brazilian society==
The spill impacted the Brazilian society and the overall economy on a hold.  The massive death and extinction of many species of fish prompted a significant decrease in the number of fish that supported the bay.  A total of about 4000 of the total 6000 fishermen in the Guanabara Bay had resorted to alternative sources of income and jobs, because of the decline in the fishing industry.  According to some fishermen in the region one can hardly obtain ten kilos of catch, a scenario which was contrary to the previous period before the spillage when the fishermen could obtain a catch of 100 kilos or more.  The quality of the fish from the bay area had also been a source of concern.  Research findings have shown that the fish surrounding the bay area was contaminated; therefore the prices in the region were valued at half the price because of quality.  In addition, the Petrobas refinery company also lost a substantial amount of money through fines from the Brazilian Government, as well as, compensation and other strict environmental conservation concerns.  To combat this growing onslaught Petrobas developed some environmental conservation strategies by putting strict methods and policies in place to offset its critics.  However, these measures proved to be extremely costly, putting a dent in the company’s fiscal stability.

==Stakeholders affected from disaster==
Greenpeace (an environmental bureau set up by the government ) challenged Petrobras on its demand to observe dramatic changes on corporate policies.  They questioned their ability to execute the environmental conservation mandate and were very vocal in their disapproval of their handling of the situation. To gain some ground Petrobras argued that the spill was caused, not by dumping of oil, but by a broken pipeline, a mere accident that did not result in customer’s being revengeful or unaccommodating.&lt;ref&gt;The Petroleum Economist. London: Petroleum Press Bureau, 1974. Print.

        Source Identification. Amsterdam:        
        Elsevier/Academic Press, 2007. Internet resource
&lt;/ref&gt;  The other affected stakeholders were the government of Brazil, the local authorities, the fishermen in the region, the local business people and the Petrobras refinery company.  The fishermen were affected by the 	decreased in the number of fishes that influenced their daily catch, as well as, the fish quality.  There was a high level of contamination in the fishes 	that occupied the bay area. The local authorities were also affected by the spillage, since it led to the halt of the activities at the coast that would attribute to government revenue collection.  The government was first 	affected by the challenge the event caused on its policies and they had to make immediate re-adjustment.  New policies had to be adopted to cater for future tragedies of this nature.  Petrobras Refinery Company was the hardest hit, since they had to pay huge fines of over 28 million dollars for the damages caused as a result, of the oil spill. Compensation was also paid out to affected citizens within the bay area and adjacent to it.&lt;ref&gt;International Environment Reporter: Current Report. Washington: Bureau of National Affairs,1978.

==Changes in government regulations==
Changes and regulatory policies became the order of the day for the government following the oil spill.  Transforming the way government performed its regulatory measures were address.  One of the main changes that occurred was the enhanced precision by which the governing and the oil industries handle the environmental requirements for incidents such as this oil spill. The government changed their regulations and demanded Risk Management and an Emergency Plan to be put in place. Every oil institution must execute “oil Pollution Risk Assessment”.&lt;ref&gt;"THE AMERICAS Brazil Discovers New Leak Near Oil Refinery." Orange County Register: 0. Jan 30 2000.

         ProQuest Education Journals; ProQuest Health Management; ProQuest Research Library; ProQuest 
         Social Science Journals. Web. 4 Mar. 2013 .&lt;/ref&gt;  This law demanded an inclusive policy manual on the avoidance of oil pollution accident.  The “Emergency plan” had to take effect during an oil spill and must have the official endorsement of the environmental bureau (Greenpeace).  In order to drive home the seriousness of the situation the Government established a task force (in addition to Greenpeace) to regulate and enforce the plans that were laid out by the environmental bureau.  This was done in the form of an auditing team.  This team must be independent and not be affiliated with any of the immediate parties (government or oil company).  Oil industries were given strict guidelines to observe these regulations, by creating higher standards within their institution.  This was a very challenging experience for the oil companies, who had suffered enormous financial loss during this period.  Complying with the regulation was a must, but the effect it had on the oil companies was tremendous.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, Stephen."Brazil Fights Giant Oil Spill; Damage Appears Checked; State-Owned Firm Faces 2nd Major Fine this

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Company changes as a result==
Immediate work was done to ensure that Government policies were adhered to:
-  Immediate replacement of storage tanks as well as, underground piping facilities was done to avoid any more disaster.  A compulsory replacement plan was put in place to ensure that compliance was followed and adhered too.
- Transportation method was another important aspect of change that had to be address.  The policy demanded a merit based approval of the transportation vessels to minimize or eliminate spillage.
- There had to be strict approval policies that required stable channels and vessels for the transportation of oil within the environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19417">'''Airborne radioactivity''' was detected '''in Europe in autumn 2017''', starting from the last days of September. The source is widely suspected to be in Russia; however, the Russian government denies that any nuclear mishaps occurred that could have caused the radiation spike. The radioactive isotope detected was [[ruthenium-106]]; across Europe, it was found to be in small quantities (from micro[[Becquerel|becquerels]] to a few millibecquerels per cubic metre of air), not significant for the health of the population far away from the source.&lt;ref name="irsn"&gt;[http://www.irsn.fr/EN/newsroom/News/Pages/20171109_Detection-of-Ruthenium-106-in-France-and-in-Europe-Results-of-IRSN-investigations.aspx Detection of Ruthenium 106 in France and in Europe: Results of IRSN’s investigations]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smag"&gt;[https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/02/mishandling-spent-nuclear-fuel-russia-may-have-caused-radioactivity-spread-across Mishandling of spent nuclear fuel in Russia may have caused radioactivity to spread across Europe By Edwin CartlidgeFeb. 14, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT111217"/&gt; However, it is estimated that the radiation released posed a danger to any employees or residents within several kilometers of the currently-unknown source.

== Radioactivity detected ==
European monitoring networks declared increased radioactivity levels in Europe, coming from Eastern Europe, in the first days of October:
* the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Federal Office of Public Health]] (FOPH) reported increase of radioactive particles of ruthenium-106 since 25 September&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irsn.fr/EN/newsroom/News/Pages/20171004-Detection-ruthenium-106-in-the-air-in-Europe.aspx|title=Detection of ruthenium 106 in the air in the east and south-east parts of Europe|website=www.irsn.fr|language=fr-FR|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Institut de radioprotection et de sûreté nucléaire|Institute of Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety]] of [[France]], indicated that the relatively high levels in the beginning of October have steadily decreased from 6 October, while no radioactive element was detected after 13 of October.&lt;ref name="irsn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="smag" /&gt;

An assessment of the [[Institut de radioprotection et de sûreté nucléaire|French nuclear safety institute IRSN]] indicated that while there was no health risk for the vast majority of people in Europe, the radioactive quantity released was significant, estimated from 100 to 300 terabecquerels, which would require an evacuation of people from a radius of several kilometers from the source, as yet then unidentified.&lt;ref name="irsn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="smag" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/10/nuclear-accident-in-russia-or-kazakhstan-sends-radioactive-cloud-over-europe|title=Nuclear accident sends 'harmless' radioactive cloud over Europe|last=Sample|first=Ian|date=2017-11-10|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-10|last2=Willsher|first2=Kim|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The source of the aforementioned 100–300 TBq activity corresponds approximately to 1–3 grams of the ruthenium-106 isotope.&lt;ref name="smag" /&gt;

While the release of the gaseous noble gas element [[Krypton-85]] is rountine during [[nuclear reprocessing]], the noble metal [[Ruthenium]] that is generated in a [[fission product yield]] rate of from "0.39" to "3.103"% of every fission of a nucleus of uranium or plutonium respectively, is by contrast ''generally'' in metallic form, with a high boiling point of 4150 degrees celsius in spent fuel. However, owing to the [[ionizing radiation]] environment of [[spent fuel]] and the entry of oxygen, [[radiolysis]]-reactions can generate the more volatile compound [[Ruthenium(VIII) oxide]] which has a boiling point of approximately 40 degrees celsius and is a strong oxidizer, reacting with virtually any fuel/[[hydrocarbon]]. The use of a solution of [[tributyl phosphate]] in the hydrocarbons [[kerosene]] or [[dodecane]], is frequently used as part of the [[nuclear reprocessing]] method known as [[PUREX]]. Accidental airborne releases of Ru-106 have occurred, through this pathway in the past, such as the British [[B205]] reprocessing incident in 1973, were a number of employees were heavily exposed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20180505200059/http://network.bellona.org/content/uploads/sites/3/Sellaengweb.pdf "In 1972, B205 was shut down for one year for repairs, and as a consequence B204 also had to be closed. The pre-handling plant was supposed to reopen on September 26,  1973.  However,  when the operators started up the plant, a chemical reaction occurred which released a cloud of radioactive gas.The entire plant was contaminated by radiation,  and 34 workers were exposed to radioactive ruthenium-106. After that, B204 was never taken into use again."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0265931X08001392 Sources of anthropogenic radionuclides in the environment: a review doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2008.08.004]&lt;/ref&gt; With corrosion of the [[fuel rod]]-cladding, an issue in the British case, due to the selection of magnesium for the coating on the fuel rods, in the [[MAGNOX]]-reactor spent fuel pools, reprocessing needed to occur within a ''few months'' at the B205 facility. While most other facilities like the French [[La Hague]], place the spent-fuel in [[spent fuel pool]]s for ''about a decade'', until the Ru-106, which has a half-life of ~ 1 year, has safely decayed into [[isotopes of rhodium|Rh-106]] and finally stable [[Isotopes of palladium|Pd-106]]. All attempts at PUREX applied to relatively freshly discharged spent-fuel, need to take the presence, oxidative and volatile nature of Ruthenium(VIII) oxide into account.

[[File:RIAN archive 132603 Nuclear power reactor fuel assembly.jpg|thumb|A [[nuclear fuel rod]] assembly bundle being inspected before entering a reactor.]]

The French IRSN has put forth the hypothesis in Jan-2018 that a possible reason for the release of Ru-106 radioactivity at Mayak-PA might be an unsuccessful attempt to extract the equally short-lived reactor-generated-isotope [[Isotopes of cerium|cerium-144]] for the European/Italian nuetrino-detecton-project ''[[Borexino]]''. Mayak-PA had agreed to deliver cerium-144 in early 2018, but canceled the contract in December 2017.&lt;ref name="smag" /&gt; Mayak PA was the only facility contractually-willing to attempt the extraction of cerium-144 from "fresh" spent nuclear fuel, 2–3 years old. Usually spent fuel is not processed earlier than five years after extraction. The Ru106/Ru103 ratio in analyzed environmental samples during the pollution spread was characteristic of "fresh" spent fuel.&lt;ref name="irsn" /&gt;

Initially, there was no indication given for the source of these radioactive particles, apart from a October 2017 statement coming from German authorities estimating the source in Eastern Europe, at a distance of more than 1,000&amp;nbsp;km from Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4951812/Spike-airborne-radioactivity-detected-Europe.html|title=Spike in airborne radioactivity detected in Europe|work=Mail Online|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later report from the German Federal Radiation Protection Service indicated that a location to the South of the Urals was possible (as well as other potential locations), however [[Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring of Russia|Roshydromet]] (the meteorology service of Russia) initially announced that the only location in [[Russia]] where ruthenium-106 was detected was St. Petersburg, from September 25 until October 7, in very small quantities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rt.com/news/406260-radioactive-particles-europe-spike/|title=Mysterious spike in radioactive particles across Europe baffles scientists|work=RT International|access-date=2017-10-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; As reported by [[Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring of Russia|Roshydromet]], Ru-106 activity in St. Petersburg was at 115.4 μBq/m³ from October 2 to 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newizv.ru/news/incident/14-10-2017/nikto-ne-hotel-priznavat-no-ruteniy-106-letaet-nad-evropoy|title=Никто не хотел признавать... Но рутений-106 летает над Европой|work=newizv.ru|access-date=2017-10-14|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French [[Institut de radioprotection et de sûreté nucléaire|Institute of Radioprotection and Nuclear Security]] (IRSN) ruled out the emissions as coming from a nuclear reactor, estimating that it should have come either from a nuclear treatment site or from a center producing radioactive medicine. The location where emissions have taken place is estimated south of the Ural mountains, between the Urals and the Volga river, in Russia or [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/harmless-radioactive-cloud-spread-over-europe-from-russia-or-kazakhstan/a-41323409|title=Harmless radioactive cloud spread over Europe from Russia or Kazakhstan {{!}} News {{!}} DW {{!}} 10.11.2017|last=(www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|language=en|access-date=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring of Russia|Roshydromet]] then issued a report describing a rise in beta activity of aerosols and surfaces at all monitoring posts in South Ural from September 25 to October 1, 2017. In two aerosol samples, an increase in Ru-106 activity was detected. On September 26 and 27, Ru-106 decay products were detected in the Republic of Tatarstan. On September 27 and 28, high pollution levels of aerosols and surfaces was detected in Volgograd and Rostov-on-Don. In two aerosol samples from Chelyabinsk Oblast, 986- and 440-fold activity increases were measured, as compared to the preceding month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report|url=http://www.meteorf.ru/product/infomaterials/91/15078/?sphrase_id=135727|title=Об аварийном, экстремально высоком и высоком загрязнении окружающей среды на территории Российской Федерации в период с 6 по 13 октября 2017 года|access-date=2017-11-21|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mayak|Mayak nuclear plant]] is widely suspected as the source of the radiation. However, authorities at Mayak and [[Rosatom]], the Russian state company running the nuclear industry, have both denied a link.&lt;ref name="NYT111217"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Luxmoore|first1=Matthew|last2=Cowell|first2=Alan|title=Russia, in Reversal, Confirms Radiation Spike|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/world/europe/russia-nuclear-cloud.html|accessdate=November 21, 2017|publisher=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 November 2017 Russia reversed itself by confirming that a radiation spike was recorded at two monitoring facilities within a 62-mile radius of the Mayak nuclear reprocessing and isotope production plant. However, Russia continues to deny that the source of the radiation is within Russia, and claims that "the published data is not sufficient to establish the location of the pollution source."&lt;ref name="NYT111217"/&gt;

Rosatom initially stated that it had not carried out any operations that could have led to the isotope's release into the atmosphere "for many years". However, in December 2017, senior Mayak executive Yuri Morkov admitted that ruthenium-106 is routinely released as part of the plant's processing of spent nuclear fuel. Morkov characterized the amount released as "insignificant" and denied Mayak was the source of the radiation spike.&lt;ref name=newsweek&gt;{{cite news|title=Critics accuse Russian nuclear authorities of Soviet-style cover-ups and heavy-handed tactics|url=http://www.newsweek.com/crackdown-russia-critics-accuse-nuclear-authorities-soviet-style-cover-ups-and-755389|accessdate=20 January 2018|work=Newsweek|date=21 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic investigation within Russia is hampered by the problem that Mayak is in the walled-off closed city of [[Ozyorsk, Chelyabinsk Oblast|Ozyorsk]], which non-resident Russians are barred from visiting without special permission, and by government harassment of nuclear critics. In Russia prominent nuclear critics experience government raids, are accused on state TV of "exploiting the nuclear issue to foment revolution", and risk criminal prosecution on charges of incitement of hatred against nuclear energy employees.&lt;ref name=newsweek/&gt;

The [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]'s Nuclear Safety Institute set up an international committee to investigate the incident.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308230144/http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/02/mishandling-spent-nuclear-fuel-russia-may-have-caused-radioactivity-spread-across|title=Mishandling of spent nuclear fuel in Russia may have caused radioactivity to spread across Europe|last1=Cartlidge|first1=Edwin|date=14 February 2018|website=Science|publisher=Science|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French [[Institut de radioprotection et de sûreté nucléaire|Institute of Radioprotection and Nuclear Security]] (IRSN) provided a report to the committee in January 2018. The report concluded that the most likely source of the pollution is a spent fuel treatment facility located in a region between Volga and Ural. A possible reason for the release of radioactivity at Mayak PA might be an unsuccessful attempt to produce [[cerium]]-144 for the European scientific project [[Borexino]]. Mayak PA had agreed to deliver cerium-144 in early 2018, but canceled the contract in December 2017.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Mayak PA was the only facility capable of producing cerium-144 from "fresh" spent nuclear fuel 2–3 years old. Usually spent fuel is not processed earlier than five years after extraction. The Ru106/Ru103 ratio in analyzed environmental samples during the pollution spread was characteristic of "fresh" spent fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/sciences/2018/02/02/01008-20180202ARTFIG00327-ruthenium-le-scenario-de-l-accident.php?redirect_premium|title=Une commande franco-italienne à l'origine de la pollution au ruthénium 106?|date=2018-02-02|work=FIGARO|access-date=2018-02-05|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the non-Russian members of the committee accepted the conclusions of IRSN's report, the Russian members maintain that an inspection of the Mayak PA facility in November 2017 showed no anomalies and a rare meteorological event may have transported the ruthenium-106 from somewhere else to the apparent region of origin.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7229">The '''Central America bioregion''' is a [[biogeographic]] region comprising southern [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]].

The bioregion covers the southern portion of Mexico, all of [[Belize]], [[Costa Rica]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], and [[Nicaragua]], and all but easternmost [[Panama]].

WWF defines bioregions as "geographic clusters of ecoregions that may span several habitat types, but have strong biogeographic affinities, particularly at taxonomic levels higher than the species level (genus, family)."

The bioregion lies in the [[tropics]], and is home to [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forests]], [[tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical dry broadleaf forests]], and [[tropical and subtropical coniferous forests|tropical coniferous forests]]. The higher mountains are home to cool-climate [[montane forest]]s, [[montane grasslands and shrublands|grasslands and shrublands]].

Central America connects [[North America]] to [[South America]]. The land bridge was completed 2.8 million years ago, when the [[Isthmus of Panama]] was formed, linking the two continents for the first time in tens of millions of years. The resulting [[Great American Interchange]] of animals and plants shaped the flora and fauna of the Central America bioregion.

Large mammals include the [[white-lipped peccary]] ''(Tayassu pecari)'', [[Baird's tapir]] ''(Tapirus bairdii)'', [[white-tailed deer]] ''(Odocoileus virginianus)'', [[Central American red brocket]] ''(Mazama temama)'', [[Yucatan brown brocket]] ''(Mazama pandora)'', [[giant anteater]] ''(Myrmecophaga tridactyla)'', [[brown-throated sloth]] ''(Bradypus variegatus)'', [[jaguar]] ''(Panthera onca)'', [[cougar]] ''(Puma concolor)'', and [[ocelot]] ''(Leopardus pardalis)''.

Plants of South American origin came to dominate the tropical lowlands of Central America, as did South American freshwater fish and invertebrates. 95% of Central American freshwater fish are South American in origin, with only the [[Tropical gar]] ''(Atractosteus tropicus)'', three [[clupeid]]s ''([[Dorosoma]])'', a [[catostomid]] ''([[Ictiobus]])'', and an [[ictalurid]] ''([[Ictalurus]])'' of North American origin.&lt;ref&gt;Flannery, Tim (2001). ''The Eternal Frontier: An Ecological History of North America and its Peoples.'' Grove Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

The montane vegetation of the region is distinct from the lowland vegetation, and includes species with origins in temperate North America, including [[oak]]s ''(Quercus)'', [[Pine]]s ''(Pinus)'' and [[alder]]s ''(Alnus)'', as well as a some species with origins in temperate South America, including ''[[Weinmannia]]'' and ''[[Drimys]]''.

== Cerro Dominador CSP project ==
The Cerro Dominador project&lt;ref&gt;[http://seia.sea.gob.cl/expediente/ficha/fichaPrincipal.php?modo=ficha&amp;id_expediente=2128879352 Ficha del Proyecto:“PLANTA SOLAR CERRO DOMINADOR”] Servicio de Evaluación Ambiental&lt;/ref&gt; will see the construction and operation of a 110 MW [[concentrated solar power]] plant with storage in the northern [[Chile]]an region of [[Antofagasta Region|Antofagasta]], located in the [[Atacama desert]], one of the driest places with the highest solar radiation on earth. When finished, Cerro Dominador will be the largest CSP power plant with storage in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘A solar Saudi Arabia’: While Trump promotes coal, Chile and others are turning to cheap sun power|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/world/2017/03/31/while-trump-promotes-coal-other-countries-are-turning-to-cheap-sun-power/|accessdate=2 April 2017|publisher=[[Washington Post]]|date=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Funcionamiento PS10.jpg|thumb|left | An example of a CSP (Concentrated Solar Power) plant, also called “concentrating solar power” or “concentrated solar thermal”]]

==Details==

===Technology===
The Cerro Dominador project will have a 110&amp;nbsp;MW solar-thermal tower. This technology uses a series of mirrors (heliostats) that track the sun on two axes, concentrating the solar radiation on a receiver on the upper part of the tower, where the heat is transferred to molten salts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisischile.cl/9090/2/chile-to-welcome-largest-solar-concentration-plant-in-lat-am/News.aspx Chile to welcome largest solar concentration plant in Lat Am] www.thisischile.cl Thursday, January 16, 2014 retrieved January 27, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
The molten salts then transfer their heat in a heat exchanger to water, generating superheated steam, which feeds a turbine that transforms the kinetic energy of the steam into electric energy using the [[Rankine cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nrel.gov/csp/solarpaces/project_detail.cfm/projectID=3275 |title=Concentrating Solar Power Projects - Atacama-1 |publisher=[[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] |date= 1 July 2015 |accessdate=10 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the Cerro Dominador plant will be capable of generating around 110 MW of power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reneweconomy.com.au/2014/abengoa-to-build-110mw-solar-tower-storage-plant-in-chile-24839 Abengoa to build 110MW solar tower storage plant in Chile] reneweconomy.com.au/ By Giles Parkinson on 13 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
The plant will have an advanced storage system enabling it to generate electricity for up to 17.5 hours without direct solar radiation, which allows it to provide a stable electricity supply without interruptions if required.
Additionally, the plant will have a sub-station and transmission line connected to the SING (Sistema Interconectado del Norte Grande) or Norte Grande Electric Grid.
The plant has an estimated lifespan of 30 to 50 years.

===Funding===
The cost of the project is estimated at US$1 billion, and construction started in May 2014. The Chilean government, through [[CORFO]], is providing US$20 million of funding and is also loaning the land where the plant is located. The government also negotiated loans from the [[Inter-American Development Bank]], the [[Climate Investment Funds|Clean Technology Fund]], the German state-owned development bank ([[KfW]]), and the European Union.

===Purpose===
The project is part of Chile’s national renewable energy program, intended to provide Chile with cleaner energy, while also reducing its dependency on fossil fuels like coal and natural gas.
Chile has set a target to produce 20% of its electricity from clean energy sources by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cer.gob.cl/en/blog/2013/09/congreso-aprobo-ley-de-fomento-al-desarrollo-de-las-ernc-2025/ Chilean Congress approved new law for NCRE: 20% by 2025] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012052040/http://cer.gob.cl/en/blog/2013/09/congreso-aprobo-ley-de-fomento-al-desarrollo-de-las-ernc-2025/ |date=October 12, 2013 }} Centro de Energías Renovables retrieved January 26, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Cerro Dominador will prevent the emission of approximately 643,000 tons of [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] into the atmosphere every year. The construction, operation and maintenance of the plant will also act as a catalyst for regional socio-economic development, creating a large number of direct and indirect jobs in construction, development, commissioning and plant operation as well as a network of services that will promote economic growth in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abengoa.com/web/en/noticias_y_publicaciones/noticias/historico/2014/01_enero/abg_20140109.html?q=chile Abengoa to develop South America’s largest solar-thermal plant in Chile] www.abengoa.com retived January 9, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2643">'''Cutan''' is one of two [[biopolymer]]s which occur in the [[plant cuticle|cuticle]] of some plants. The other and better-known polymer is [[cutin]]. Cutan is believed to be a [[hydrocarbon]] polymer, whereas cutin is a [[polyester]], but the structure and synthesis of cutan are not yet fully understood. Cutan is not present in as many plants as once thought; for instance it is absent in ''[[Ginkgo]]''.&lt;ref name=Briggs1999&gt;{{Cite journal

Cutan was first detected as a non-[[saponification|saponifiable]] component, resistant to de-[[esterification]] by [[alkaline hydrolysis]], that increases in amount in cuticles of some species such as ''[[Clivia miniata]]'' as they reach maturity, apparently replacing the cutin secreted in the early stages of cuticle development (Schmidt and Schönherr, 1982). Evidence that cutan is a hydrocarbon polymer comes from the fact that its flash [[pyrolysis]] products are a characteristic [[homologous series]] of paired [[alkane]]s and [[alkene]]s (Nip ''et al.'' 1986)

Its preservation potential is much greater than that of cutin.&lt;ref name="Briggs1999"/&gt;

A '''depolarizer''' or '''depolariser''', in electrochemistry, according to an [[IUPAC]] definition,&lt;ref&gt;Entries [http://goldbook.iupac.org/D01599.html "depolarizer"] and [http://goldbook.iupac.org/E01940.html "electroactive substance"] in "The IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology", 2nd ed. (the "Gold Book"). Compiled by A. D. McNaught and A. Wilkinson. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford (1997). XML on-line corrected version: http://goldbook.iupac.org (2006-) created by M. Nic, J. Jirat, B. Kosata; updates compiled by A. Jenkins. {{ISBN|0-9678550-9-8}}. {{doi|10.1351/goldbook}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a synonym of '''electroactive substance''', i.e., a substance which changes its [[oxidation state]], or partakes in a formation or breaking of chemical bonds, in a [[Intervalence charge transfer|charge-transfer]] step of an [[electrochemical reaction]].

In the [[battery industry]], the term "depolarizer" has been used to denote a substance used in a [[primary cell]] to prevent buildup of hydrogen gas bubbles.&lt;ref&gt;"McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific &amp; Technical Terms",  McGraw-Hill, Inc., 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; A battery depolarizer takes up electrons during discharge of the cell; therefore, it is always an [[oxidizing agent]]. The term "depolarizer" can be considered as outdated or misleading, since it is based on the concept of "[[Polarisation (electrochemistry)|polarization]]" which is hardly realistic in many cases{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}.

==Polarization==
Under certain conditions for some electrochemical cells, especially if they use an aqueous electrolyte, [[hydrogen ion]]s can be converted into [[hydrogen atom]]s and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules. In the extreme case, bubbles of [[hydrogen]] gas might appear at one of the electrodes. If such a layer of hydrogen or even H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas bubbles appear on the positive plate of a battery, they interfere with the chemical action of the cell. An electrode covered with gases is said to be ''polarized''. Polarization in galvanic cells causes the voltage and thus current to be reduced, especially if the bubbles cover a large fraction of a plate. Depolarizers are substances which are intended to remove the hydrogen, and therefore, they help to keep the voltage at a high level. However, this concept is outdated, since if enough depolarizer is present, it will react directly in most cases by getting electrons from the positive plate of the galvanic cell, i.e. there will be no relevant amount of hydrogen gas present. Therefore, the original concept of polarization does not apply to most batteries, and the depolarizer does not react with hydrogen as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Still, the term is used today, however, in most cases, it might be replaced with oxidizing agent.

Many different substances have been used as depolarizers; the most notable are listed below.

==Oxidizing agents==
These [[Redox|oxidize]] the hydrogen to water.  Examples include:

* [[Nitric acid]], used in the [[Grove cell]] and [[Bunsen cell]]
* [[Chromic acid]], used in the [[Chromic acid cell]]
* [[Manganese dioxide]], used in the [[Leclanché cell]] and [[Dry cell]]

Nitric and chromic acids are powerful oxidizing agents, and effective depolarizers, but their hazardous nature makes them unsuitable for general use.  Manganese dioxide is, therefore, the most widely used depolarizer.

==Salts of metals==
The hydrogen ions displace metal from the salt so that metal, instead of hydrogen, is deposited on the positive plate.  Examples:

* [[Silver oxide]], used in the [[Silver-oxide battery]]
* [[Copper(II) sulfate|Copper sulphate]], used in the [[Daniell cell]]
* [[Mercury(I) sulfate|Mercurous sulphate]], used in the [[Weston cell|Weston]] and [[Clark cell|Clark standard cells]]

The '''dew point''' is the [[temperature]] to which [[air]] must be cooled to become saturated with [[water vapor]]. When further cooled, the airborne water vapor will [[Water vapor#Condensation|condense]] to form liquid water ([[dew]]). When air cools to its dew point through contact with a surface that is colder than the air, water will condense on the surface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://w1.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?word=dew+point Glossary - NOAA's National Weather Service&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WallaceHobbs2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John M.

A higher dew point means there will be more moisture in the air.&lt;ref name="WallaceHobbs2006" /&gt;

==Humidity==
If all the other factors influencing humidity remain constant, at ground level the [[relative humidity]] rises as the temperature falls. This is because less vapor is needed to saturate the air, so vapor condenses as the temperature falls. In normal conditions, the dew point temperature will not be greater than the air temperature because relative humidity cannot exceed 100%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Observed Dew Point Temperature|url=http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/maps/sfcobs/dwp.rxml|website=Department of Atmospheric Sciences (DAS) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In technical terms, the dew point is the temperature at which the water vapor in a sample of [[air]] at constant [[barometric pressure]] condenses into liquid water at the same [[reaction rate|rate]] at which it evaporates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dew%20point Dew Point | Definition of dew point by Merriam-Webster&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; At temperatures below the dew point, the rate of condensation will be greater than that of evaporation, forming more liquid water. The condensed water is called dew when it forms on a solid surface, or frost if it freezes. The condensed water is called either [[fog]] or a [[cloud]], depending on its altitude, when it forms in the air.  If the temperature is below the dew point, the vapor is called [[supersaturated]]. This can happen if there are not enough particles in the air to act as [[condensation nuclei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Skilling|first1=Tom|title=Ask Tom why: Is it possible for relative humidity to exceed 100 percent?|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-07-20/news/ct-wea-0720-asktom-20110720_1_relative-humidity-condensation-nuclei-supersaturated-air|accessdate=24 January 2018|work=Chicago Tribune|date=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A high [[relative humidity]] implies that the dew point is closer to the current air temperature. A relative humidity of 100% indicates the dew point is equal to the current temperature and that the air is maximally saturated with water. When the moisture content remains constant and temperature increases, relative humidity decreases, but the dew point remains constant.&lt;ref name=Horstmeyer&gt;{{cite web| last=Horstmeyer | first=Steve | title=Relative Humidity....Relative to What? The Dew Point Temperature...a better approach | publisher=Steve Horstmeyer, Meteorologist, WKRC TV, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA | date=2006-08-15 | url=http://www.shorstmeyer.com/wxfaqs/humidity/humidity.html| accessdate=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[General aviation]] pilots use dew point data to calculate the likelihood of [[carburetor icing]] and [[fog]], and to estimate the height of a [[cumuliform]] [[cloud base]].

[[Image:dewpoint.jpg|400px|right|thumb|This graph shows the maximum percentage, by mass, of water vapor that air at [[sea-level pressure]] across a range of temperatures can contain. For a lower ambient pressure, a curve has to be drawn above the current curve. A higher ambient pressure yields a curve under the current curve.]]

Increasing the barometric pressure increases the dew point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dew Point in Compressed Air – Frequently Asked Questions|url=https://www.vaisala.com/sites/default/files/documents/Dew-point-compressed-air-Application-note-B210991EN-B-LOW-v1.pdf|website=Vaisala|accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that, if the pressure increases, the mass of water vapour in the air must be reduced in order to maintain the same dew point. For example, consider [[New York City|New York]] ({{convert|33|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=or}} elevation) and [[Denver]] ({{convert|5280|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=or}} elevation&lt;ref name="denfacts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denvergov.org/AboutDenver/today_factsguide.asp |title=Denver Facts Guide&amp;nbsp;– Today |publisher=The City and County of Denver |accessdate=March 19, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203182736/http://www.denvergov.org/AboutDenver/today_factsguide.asp |archivedate=February 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Because Denver is at a higher elevation than New York, it will tend to have a lower barometric pressure. This means that if the dew point and temperature in both cities are the same, the amount of water vapor in the air will be greater in Denver.

==Relationship to human comfort==
{{refimprove section |date=October 2016}}
When the air temperature is high, the human body uses the evaporation of [[Perspiration|sweat]] to cool down, with the cooling effect directly related to how fast the perspiration evaporates. The rate at which perspiration can evaporate depends on how much moisture is in the air and how much moisture the air can hold. If the air is already saturated with moisture, perspiration will not evaporate. The body's [[thermoregulation]] will produce perspiration in an effort to keep the body at its normal temperature even when the rate it is producing sweat exceeds the evaporation rate, so one can become coated with sweat on humid days even without generating additional body heat (such as by exercising).

As the air surrounding one's body is warmed by body heat, it will rise and be replaced with other air. If air is moved away from one's body with a natural breeze or a fan, sweat will evaporate faster, making perspiration more effective at cooling the body. The more unevaporated perspiration, the greater the discomfort.

A [[wet bulb thermometer]] also uses [[evaporative cooling]], so it provides a good measure for use in evaluating comfort level.

Discomfort also exists when the dew point is low (below around {{convert|-30|°C|°F|disp=or}}).{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} The drier air can cause skin to crack and become irritated more easily. It will also dry out the airways. The US [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] recommends indoor air be maintained at {{convert|20|-|24.5|C|F|0}} with a 20–60% relative humidity, equivalent to a dew point of {{convert|-4.5|to|15.5|C|F|0}}.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Lower dew points, less than {{convert|10|°C|°F}}, correlate with lower ambient temperatures and the body requires less cooling. A lower dew point can go along with a high temperature only at extremely low relative humidity, allowing for relatively effective cooling.

People inhabiting [[tropical climate|tropical]] and [[humid subtropical climate|subtropical]] climates acclimatize somewhat to higher dew points. Thus, a resident of [[Singapore]] or [[Miami]], for example, might have a higher threshold for discomfort than a resident of a temperate climate like [[London]] or [[Chicago]]. Those accustomed to temperate climates often begin to feel uncomfortable when the dew point reaches between {{convert|15|and(-)|20|C|F}}, while others might find dew points below {{convert|18|C|F}} comfortable. Most inhabitants of temperate areas will consider dew points above {{convert|21|°C|°F}} oppressive and tropical-like, while inhabitants of hot and humid areas may not find this uncomfortable. Thermal comfort depends not just on physical environmental factors, but also on psychological factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lin|first1=Tzu-Ping|title=Thermal perception, adaptation and attendance in a public square in hot and humid regions|journal=Building and Environment|date=10 February 2009|volume=44|issue=10|pages=2017–2026|url=https://www.academia.edu/download/46325093/Thermal_perception_adaptation_and_attend20160607-13171-4gct3e.pdf|accessdate=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
Devices called hygrometers are used to measure dew point over a wide range of temperatures. These devices consist of a polished metal mirror which is cooled as air is passed over it.  The temperature at which dew forms is, by definition, the dew point. Manual devices of this sort can be used to calibrate other types of humidity sensors, and automatic sensors may be used in a control loop with a humidifier or dehumidifier to control the dew point of the air in a building or in a smaller space for a manufacturing process.

== Extreme values ==
A dew point of {{convert|33|°C|F}} was observed at 14:00&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time|EDT]] on July 12, 1987, in [[Melbourne, Florida]]. A dew point of {{convert|32|°C|F}} has been observed in the United States on at least two other occasions: [[Appleton, Wisconsin]], at 17:00&amp;nbsp;[[Central Time Zone|CDT]] on July 13, 1995, and New Orleans Naval Air Station at 17:00&amp;nbsp;[[Central Time Zone|CDT]] on July 30, 1987. A dew point of {{convert|35|°C|F}} was observed at [[Dhahran]], Saudi Arabia, at 15:00&amp;nbsp;[[Arabia Standard Time|AST]] on July 8, 2003, which caused the [[heat index]] to reach {{convert|81|°C|F}}, the highest value recorded.

==Calculating the dew point==
[[Image:Dewpoint-RH.svg|thumb|396px|right|Graph of the dependence of the dew point upon air temperature for several levels of relative humidity.]]
{{See also|Psychrometric chart}}

A well-known approximation used to calculate the dew point, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;dp&lt;/sub&gt;, given just the actual ("dry bulb") air temperature, ''T'' (in degrees Celsius) and [[relative humidity]] (in percent), RH, is the Magnus formula:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\gamma(T,\mathrm{RH})&amp;=\ln\left(\frac\mathrm{RH}{100}\right)+\frac{bT}{c+T};\\[8pt]
T_\mathrm{dp}&amp;= \frac{c\gamma(T,\mathrm{RH})}{b-\gamma(T,\mathrm{RH})};\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
The more complete formulation and origin of this approximation involves the interrelated [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturated]] water [[vapor pressure]] (in units of [[bar (unit)|millibar]]s, also called [[Pascal (unit)|hectopascals]]) at ''T'', ''P''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;(''T''), and the actual vapor pressure (also in units of millibars), ''P''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(''T''), which can be either found with ''RH'' or approximated with the barometric pressure (in millibars), ''BP''&lt;sub&gt;mb&lt;/sub&gt;, and "[[wet-bulb temperature|wet-bulb]]" temperature, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; is (unless declared otherwise, all temperatures are expressed in [[degrees Celsius]]):
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
P_\mathrm{s}(T)&amp; = \frac{100}\mathrm{RH}P_\mathrm{a}(T) = ae^{\frac{bT}{c+T}};\\[8pt]
P_\mathrm{a}(T) &amp; = \frac\mathrm{RH}{100}P_\mathrm{s}(T)=ae^{\gamma(T,\mathrm{RH})}\\
&amp;\approx P_\mathrm{s}(T_\mathrm{w}) - BP_\mathrm{mb} 0.00066 \left(1 + 0.00115T_\mathrm{w} \right)\left(T-T_\mathrm{w}\right);\\[8pt]
T_\mathrm{dp} &amp; = \frac{c\ln\frac{P_\mathrm{a}(T)}{a}}{b-\ln\frac{P_\mathrm{a}(T)}{a}};
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For greater accuracy, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'') (and therefore ''γ''(''T'', RH)) can be enhanced, using part of the ''Bögel modification'', also known as the [[Arden Buck equation]], which adds a fourth constant ''d'':
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}P_\mathrm{s,m}(T)&amp;=ae^{\left(b-\frac{T}{d}\right)\left(\frac{T}{c+T}\right)};\\[8pt]
\gamma_\mathrm{m}(T,\mathrm{RH})&amp;=\ln\left(\frac\mathrm{RH}{100}e^{\left(b-\frac{T}{d}\right)\left(\frac{T}{c+T}\right)}\right);\\[8pt]
T_{dp}&amp;= \frac{c\gamma_m(T,\mathrm{RH})}{b-\gamma_m(T,\mathrm{RH})};
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:''a'' = 6.1121&amp;nbsp;mb, ''b'' = 18.678, ''c'' = 257.14&amp;nbsp;°C, ''d'' = 234.5&amp;nbsp;°C.

There are several different constant sets in use. The ones used in [[NOAA]]'s presentation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crh.noaa.gov/images/epz/wxcalc/rhTdFromWetBulb.pdf ''Relative Humidity and Dewpoint Temperature from Temperature and Wet-Bulb Temperature'']&lt;/ref&gt; are taken from a 1980 paper by David Bolton in the ''Monthly Weather Review'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bolton|first1=David|title=The Computation of Equivalent Potential Temperature|journal=Monthly Weather Review|date=July 1980|volume=108|issue=7|pages=1046–1053|doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1980)108&lt;1046:TCOEPT&gt;2.0.CO;2|url=https://www.rsmas.miami.edu/users/pzuidema/Bolton.pdf|bibcode=1980MWRv..108.1046B}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''a'' = 6.112&amp;nbsp;mb, ''b'' = 17.67, ''c'' = 243.5&amp;nbsp;°C.
These valuations provide a maximum error of 0.1%, for {{nowrap|−30 °C ≤ ''T'' ≤ 35°C}} and {{nowrap|1% &lt; RH &lt; 100%}}.
Also noteworthy is the Sonntag1990,&lt;ref&gt;[http://irtfweb.ifa.hawaii.edu/~tcs3/tcs3/Misc/Dewpoint_Calculation_Humidity_Sensor_E.pdf SHTxx Application Note Dew-point Calculation]&lt;/ref&gt;
:''a'' = 6.112&amp;nbsp;mb, ''b'' = 17.62, ''c'' = 243.12&amp;nbsp;°C; for {{nowrap|−45 °C ≤ ''T'' ≤ 60&amp;nbsp;°C}} (error ±0.35&amp;nbsp;°C).
Another common set of values originates from the 1974 ''Psychrometry and Psychrometric Charts'', as presented by '''''Paroscientific''''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paroscientific.com/dewpoint.htm |title=MET4 and MET4A Calculation of Dew Point |publisher= |accessdate=7 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120526034637/http://www.paroscientific.com/dewpoint.htm |archivedate=May 26, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''a'' = 6.105&amp;nbsp;mb, ''b'' = 17.27, ''c'' = 237.7&amp;nbsp;°C; for {{nowrap|0 °C ≤ ''T'' ≤ 60&amp;nbsp;°C}} (error ±0.4&amp;nbsp;°C).
Also, in the ''Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buck|first1=Arden L.|title=New Equations for Computing Vapor Pressure and Enhancement Factor|journal=Journal of Applied Meteorology|date=December 1981|volume=20|issue=12|pages=1527–1532|doi=10.1175/1520-0450(1981)020&lt;1527:NEFCVP&gt;2.0.CO;2|url=http://www.public.iastate.edu/~bkh/teaching/505/arden_buck_sat.pdf|bibcode=1981JApMe..20.1527B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arden Buck presents several different valuation sets, with different minimum accuracies for different temperature ranges.  Two particular sets provide a range of −40&amp;nbsp;°C to +50&amp;nbsp;°C between the two, with even greater minimum accuracy than all of the other, above sets (maximum error at extremes of temperature range):
:''a'' = 6.1121&amp;nbsp;mb, ''b'' = 17.368, ''c'' = 238.88&amp;nbsp;°C; for {{nowrap|0 °C ≤ ''T'' ≤ 50&amp;nbsp;°C}} (error ≤ 0.05%).
:''a'' = 6.1121&amp;nbsp;mb, ''b'' = 17.966, ''c'' = 247.15&amp;nbsp;°C; for {{nowrap|−40 °C ≤ ''T'' ≤ 0&amp;nbsp;°C}} (error ≤ 0.06%).

===Simple approximation===
There is also a very simple approximation that allows conversion between the dew point, temperature, and relative humidity. This approach is accurate to within about ±1&amp;nbsp;°C as long as the relative humidity is above 50%:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
T_\mathrm{dp} &amp;\approx T-\frac{100-\mathrm{RH}}{5}; \\[5pt]
\mathrm{RH} &amp;\approx 100-5(T-T_\mathrm{dp});
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This can be expressed as a simple rule of thumb:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''For every 1&amp;nbsp;°C difference in the dew point and dry bulb temperatures, the relative humidity decreases by 5%, starting with RH&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;100% when the dew point equals the dry bulb temperature.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The derivation of this approach, a discussion of its accuracy, comparisons to other approximations, and more information on the history and applications of the dew point are given in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawrence|first1=Mark G.|title=The Relationship between Relative Humidity and the Dewpoint Temperature in Moist Air: A Simple Conversion and Applications|journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society|date=February 2005|volume=86|issue=2|pages=225–233|doi=10.1175/BAMS-86-2-225|bibcode=2005BAMS...86..225L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit, these approximations work out to
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
T_\mathrm{dp,^\circ F} &amp;\approx T_\mathrm{{}^\circ F}-\tfrac{9}{25}\left(100-\mathrm{RH}\right);\\[5pt]
\mathrm{RH} &amp;\approx 100-\tfrac{25}{9}\left(T_\mathrm{{}^\circ F}-T_\mathrm{dp,^\circ F}\right);
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, a relative humidity of 100% means dew point is the same as air temp. For 90% RH,  dew point is 3&amp;nbsp;°F lower than air temperature. For every 10 percent lower, dew point drops 3&amp;nbsp;°F.

== Frost point ==
The '''frost point''' is similar to the dew point in that it is the temperature to which a given parcel of humid air must be cooled, at constant [[atmospheric pressure]], for [[water vapor]] to be [[deposition (phase transition)|deposited]] on a surface as [[ice crystals]] without undergoing the liquid phase (compare with [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]]). The [[frost]] point for a given parcel of air is always higher than the dew point, as the stronger bonding between water molecules on the surface of ice requires higher temperature to break.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theweatherprediction.com/habyhints/347/ |title=Frost point and dew point |last=Haby |first=Jeff |accessdate=September 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Donald Bannerman Macleod''' (21 July 1887 – 8 March 1972) was a New Zealand [[molecular physicist]].

==Early life and education==
Born at [[Doyleston]], near [[Christchurch]], in 1887,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=CHP18870810.2.87.6.1 | title=Births | date=10 August 1887 | work=The Press | accessdate=18 August 2014 | page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macleod studied at [[University of Canterbury|Canterbury University College]], graduating with an [[Master of Arts|MA]] with first-class honours in chemistry in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://shadowsoftime.co.nz/university15.html |title=NZ university graduates 1870–1961: Ma |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=CHP19230512.2.132.20 |title=N.Z.

==Academic career==
Following his graduation, Macleod was appointed as a lecturer in physics at Canterbury and worked there until his retirement in 1953 as an associate professor. He had a research collaboration with Professor [[Coleridge Farr]] from 1911 to 1936.&lt;ref name="Chronicle"&gt;{{cite journal |date=April 1972 |title=Death of Dr Macleod |url=http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/irm/graphics/Registry/Chronicle%20-%20Tender%20Accepted%20for%20Registry%20at%20Ilam%20-%20April%201972%20-%20Vol%207,%20No%202.pdf |journal=Chronicle |publisher=University of Canterbury |volume=7 |issue=2  |accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922 Macleod was awarded a [[DSc]] from Canterbury University College.&lt;ref name="DSC"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=CHP19220508.2.94 |title=N.Z.

{{Earthquakes}}
An '''earthquake''' (also known as a '''quake''', '''tremor''' or '''temblor''') is the shaking of the surface of the Earth, resulting from the sudden release of energy in the [[Earth]]'s [[lithosphere]] that creates [[seismic wave]]s. Earthquakes can range in size from those that are so weak that they cannot be felt to those violent enough to toss people around and destroy whole cities. The [[seismicity]], or '''seismic activity,''' of an area is the frequency, type and size of earthquakes experienced over a period of time. The word ''tremor'' is also used for [[Episodic tremor and slip|non-earthquake seismic rumbling]].

At the Earth's surface, earthquakes manifest themselves by shaking and displacing or disrupting the ground. When the [[epicenter]] of a large earthquake is located offshore, the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to cause a [[tsunami]]. Earthquakes can also trigger [[landslide]]s, and occasionally volcanic activity.

In its most general sense, the word ''earthquake'' is used to describe any seismic event — whether natural or caused by humans — that generates seismic waves. Earthquakes are caused mostly by rupture of geological [[Fault (geology)|faults]], but also by other events such as volcanic activity, landslides, mine blasts, and [[Underground nuclear testing|nuclear tests]]. An earthquake's point of initial rupture is called its [[focus (earthquake)|focus]] or hypocenter. The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter.

]]

Tectonic earthquakes occur anywhere in the earth where there is sufficient stored elastic strain energy to drive fracture propagation along a [[Fault (geology)|fault plane]]. The sides of a fault move past each other smoothly and [[Aseismic creep|aseismically]] only if there are no irregularities or [[Asperity (faults)|asperities]] along the fault surface that increase the frictional resistance. Most fault surfaces do have such asperities and this leads to a form of [[Stick-slip phenomenon|stick-slip behavior]]. Once the fault has locked, continued relative motion between the plates leads to increasing stress and therefore, stored strain energy in the volume around the fault surface. This continues until the stress has risen sufficiently to break through the asperity, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault, releasing the [[Potential energy|stored energy]].&lt;ref name="Ohnaka"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bp0gAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA234 | title=The Physics of Rock Failure and Earthquakes | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Ohnaka, M. | year=2013 | page=148 | isbn=9781107355330}}&lt;/ref&gt; This energy is released as a combination of radiated elastic [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] [[seismic waves]], frictional heating of the fault surface, and cracking of the rock, thus causing an earthquake. This process of gradual build-up of strain and stress punctuated by occasional sudden earthquake failure is referred to as the [[elastic-rebound theory]]. It is estimated that only 10 percent or less of an earthquake's total energy is radiated as seismic energy. Most of the earthquake's energy is used to power the earthquake [[Fracture (geology)|fracture]] growth or is converted into heat generated by friction. Therefore, earthquakes lower the Earth's available [[elastic potential energy]] and raise its temperature, though these changes are negligible compared to the conductive and convective flow of heat out from the [[Structure of the Earth|Earth's deep interior.]]&lt;ref name="USGS1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Spence |first=William |author2=S.

===Earthquake fault types===
{{main|Fault (geology)}}
There are three main types of fault, all of which may cause an [[interplate earthquake]]: normal, reverse (thrust) and strike-slip. Normal and reverse faulting are examples of dip-slip, where the displacement along the fault is in the direction of [[Strike and dip|dip]] and movement on them involves a vertical component. Normal faults occur mainly in areas where the crust is being [[Extensional tectonics|extended]] such as a [[divergent boundary]]. Reverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being [[Thrust tectonics|shortened]] such as at a convergent boundary. [[Strike-slip fault]]s are steep structures where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other; transform boundaries are a particular type of strike-slip fault. Many earthquakes are caused by movement on faults that have components of both dip-slip and strike-slip; this is known as oblique slip.

Reverse faults, particularly those along [[Convergent boundary|convergent plate boundaries]] are associated with the most powerful earthquakes, [[megathrust earthquake]]s, including almost all of those of magnitude 8 or more. Strike-slip faults, particularly continental [[Transform fault|transforms]], can produce major earthquakes up to about magnitude 8. Earthquakes associated with normal faults are generally less than magnitude 7. For every unit increase in magnitude, there is a roughly thirtyfold increase in the energy released. For instance, an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 releases approximately 30 times more energy than a 5.0 magnitude earthquake and a 7.0 magnitude earthquake releases 900 times (30 × 30) more energy than a 5.0 magnitude of earthquake. An 8.6 magnitude earthquake releases the same amount of energy as 10,000 atomic bombs like those used in [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Geoscience Australia&lt;/ref&gt;

This is so because the energy released in an earthquake, and thus its magnitude, is proportional to the area of the fault that ruptures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wyss | first1 = M. | year = 1979 | title = Estimating expectable maximum magnitude of earthquakes from fault dimensions | url = | journal = Geology | volume = 7 | issue = 7| pages = 336–340 |bibcode = 1979Geo.....7..336W |doi = 10.1130/0091-7613(1979)7&lt;336:EMEMOE&gt;2.0.CO;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the stress drop. Therefore, the longer the length and the wider the width of the faulted area, the larger the resulting magnitude. The topmost, brittle part of the Earth's crust, and the cool slabs of the tectonic plates that are descending down into the hot mantle, are the only parts of our planet which can store elastic energy and release it in fault ruptures. Rocks hotter than about 300 degrees Celsius flow in response to stress; they do not rupture in earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;Sibson R. H. (1982) "Fault Zone Models, Heat Flow, and the Depth Distribution of Earthquakes in the Continental Crust of the United States", Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, Vol 72, No. 1, pp. 151–163&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sibson, R. H. (2002) "Geology of the crustal earthquake source" International handbook of earthquake and engineering seismology, Volume 1, Part 1, page 455, eds. W H K Lee, H Kanamori, P C Jennings, and C. Kisslinger, Academic Press, ISBN / ASIN: 0124406521&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum observed lengths of ruptures and mapped faults (which may break in a single rupture) are approximately 1000&amp;nbsp;km. Examples are the earthquakes in [[List of earthquakes in Chile|Chile, 1960]]; [[1957 Andreanof Islands earthquake|Alaska, 1957]]; [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Sumatra, 2004]], all in subduction zones. The longest earthquake ruptures on strike-slip faults, like the [[San Andreas Fault]] (1857, 1906), the [[North Anatolian Fault]] in Turkey (1939) and the [[Denali Fault]] in Alaska (2002), are about half to one third as long as the lengths along subducting plate margins, and those along normal faults are even shorter.

[[File:Kluft-photo-Carrizo-Plain-Nov-2007-Img 0327.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial photo of the San Andreas Fault in the [[Carrizo Plain]], northwest of Los Angeles]]

The most important parameter controlling the maximum earthquake magnitude on a fault is however not the maximum available length, but the available width because the latter varies by a factor of 20. Along converging plate margins, the dip angle of the rupture plane is very shallow, typically about 10 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalcmt.org/CMTsearch.html |title=Global Centroid Moment Tensor Catalog |publisher=Globalcmt.org |accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the width of the plane within the top brittle crust of the Earth can become 50 to 100&amp;nbsp;km ([[2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami|Japan, 2011]]; [[1964 Alaska earthquake|Alaska, 1964]]), making the most powerful earthquakes possible.

Strike-slip faults tend to be oriented near vertically, resulting in an approximate width of 10&amp;nbsp;km within the brittle crust,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wgcep.org/data-inst_eq_cat |title=Instrumental California Earthquake Catalog |publisher=WGCEP |accessdate=2011-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725021215/http://wgcep.org/data-inst_eq_cat |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus earthquakes with magnitudes much larger than 8 are not possible. Maximum magnitudes along many normal faults are even more limited because many of them are located along spreading centers, as in Iceland, where the thickness of the brittle layer is only about 6&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;Hjaltadóttir S., 2010, "Use of relatively located microearthquakes to map fault patterns and estimate the thickness of the brittle crust in Southwest Iceland"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.vedur.is/earthquakes-and-volcanism/reports-and-publications/ |title=Reports and publications &amp;#124; Seismicity &amp;#124; Icelandic Meteorological office |publisher=En.vedur.is |accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there exists a hierarchy of stress level in the three fault types. Thrust faults are generated by the highest, strike slip by intermediate, and normal faults by the lowest stress levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schorlemmer | first1 = D. | last2 = Wiemer | first2 = S. | last3 = Wyss | first3 = M. | year = 2005 | title = Variations in earthquake-size distribution across different stress regimes | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 437 | issue = 7058| pages = 539–542 |bibcode = 2005Natur.437..539S |doi = 10.1038/nature04094 | pmid = 16177788 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can easily be understood by considering the direction of the greatest principal stress, the direction of the force that 'pushes' the rock mass during the faulting. In the case of normal faults, the rock mass is pushed down in a vertical direction, thus the pushing force (''greatest'' principal stress) equals the weight of the rock mass itself. In the case of thrusting, the rock mass 'escapes' in the direction of the least principal stress, namely upward, lifting the rock mass up, thus the overburden equals the ''least'' principal stress. Strike-slip faulting is intermediate between the other two types described above. This difference in stress regime in the three faulting environments can contribute to differences in stress drop during faulting, which contributes to differences in the radiated energy, regardless of fault dimensions.

===Earthquakes away from plate boundaries===
{{main|Intraplate earthquake}}
[[File:Tremor(English).gif|thumb|Comparison of the 1985 and 2017 earthquakes on Mexico City, Puebla and Michoacán/Guerrero]]
Where plate boundaries occur within the [[Continental crust|continental lithosphere]], deformation is spread out over a much larger area than the plate boundary itself. In the case of the [[San Andreas fault]] continental transform, many earthquakes occur away from the plate boundary and are related to strains developed within the broader zone of deformation caused by major irregularities in the fault trace (e.g., the "Big bend" region). The [[1994 Northridge earthquake|Northridge earthquake]] was associated with movement on a blind thrust within such a zone. Another example is the strongly oblique convergent plate boundary between the [[Arabian plate|Arabian]] and [[Eurasian plate]]s where it runs through the northwestern part of the [[Zagros Mountains]]. The deformation associated with this plate boundary is partitioned into nearly pure thrust sense movements perpendicular to the boundary over a wide zone to the southwest and nearly pure strike-slip motion along the Main Recent Fault close to the actual plate boundary itself. This is demonstrated by earthquake [[focal mechanism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Talebian | first1 = M | last2 = Jackson | first2 = J | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-246X.2004.02092.x | title = A reappraisal of earthquake focal mechanisms and active shortening in the Zagros mountains of Iran | journal = Geophysical Journal International | volume = 156 | issue = 3 | pages = 506–526 | year = 2004 | bibcode=2004GeoJI.156..506T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All tectonic plates have internal stress fields caused by their interactions with neighboring plates and sedimentary loading or unloading (e.g. deglaciation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Nettles | first1 = M.| last2 = Ekström | first2 = G.| title = Glacial Earthquakes in Greenland and Antarctica| journal = Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences| volume = 38| issue = 1| pages = 467–491| date=May 2010 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-earth-040809-152414|bibcode = 2010AREPS..38..467N }}&lt;/ref&gt; These stresses may be sufficient to cause failure along existing fault planes, giving rise to intraplate earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Noson, Qamar, and Thorsen|year=1988|title=Washington State Earthquake Hazards: Washington State Department of Natural Resources|publisher=Washington Division of Geology and Earth Resources Information Circular 85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shallow-focus and deep-focus earthquakes===
{{Main|Depth of focus (tectonics)}}
[[File:HotelSanSalvador.jpg|thumb|Collapsed Gran Hotel building in the [[San Salvador]] metropolis, after the shallow [[1986 San Salvador earthquake]].]]

The majority of tectonic earthquakes originate at the ring of fire in depths not exceeding tens of kilometers. Earthquakes occurring at a depth of less than 70&amp;nbsp;km are classified as 'shallow-focus' earthquakes, while those with a focal-depth between 70 and 300&amp;nbsp;km are commonly termed 'mid-focus' or 'intermediate-depth' earthquakes. In [[Subduction|subduction zones]], where older and colder [[oceanic crust]] descends beneath another tectonic plate, [[Deep-focus earthquake]]s may occur at much greater depths (ranging from 300 up to 700&amp;nbsp;kilometers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher = [[National Earthquake Information Center]]| title = M7.5 Northern Peru Earthquake of 26 September 2005| date = 17 October 2005| url = ftp://hazards.cr.usgs.gov/maps/sigeqs/20050926/20050926.pdf| accessdate = 2008-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; These seismically active areas of subduction are known as [[Wadati–Benioff zone]]s. Deep-focus earthquakes occur at a depth where the subducted [[lithosphere]] should no longer be brittle, due to the high temperature and pressure. A possible mechanism for the generation of deep-focus earthquakes is faulting caused by [[olivine]] undergoing a [[phase transition]] into a [[spinel]] structure.&lt;ref name="olivine"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Greene II | first = H. W.| last2 = Burnley | first2 = P.

===Earthquakes and volcanic activity===
{{main|Volcano tectonic earthquake}}

Earthquakes often occur in volcanic regions and are caused there, both by [[tectonic plates|tectonic]] faults and the movement of [[magma]] in [[volcano]]es. Such earthquakes can serve as an early warning of volcanic eruptions, as during the [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Foxworthy and Hill|year=1982|title=Volcanic Eruptions of 1980 at Mount St. Helens, The First 100&amp;nbsp;Days: USGS Professional Paper 1249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earthquake swarms can serve as markers for the location of the flowing magma throughout the volcanoes. These swarms can be recorded by [[seismometers]] and [[tiltmeter]]s (a device that measures ground slope) and used as sensors to predict imminent or upcoming eruptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/earthq1/volcano.html|title=Volcanoes and Earthquakes|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|date=January 7, 1998|author=Watson, John|author2=Watson, Kathie|accessdate=May 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rupture dynamics===
A tectonic earthquake begins by an initial rupture at a point on the fault surface, a process known as nucleation. The scale of the nucleation zone is uncertain, with some evidence, such as the rupture dimensions of the smallest earthquakes, suggesting that it is smaller than 100 m while other evidence, such as a slow component revealed by low-frequency spectra of some earthquakes, suggest that it is larger. The possibility that the nucleation involves some sort of preparation process is supported by the observation that about 40% of earthquakes are preceded by foreshocks. Once the rupture has initiated, it begins to propagate along the fault surface. The mechanics of this process are poorly understood, partly because it is difficult to recreate the high sliding velocities in a laboratory. Also the effects of strong ground motion make it very difficult to record information close to a nucleation zone.&lt;ref name="NRS"/&gt;

Rupture propagation is generally modeled using a [[fracture mechanics]] approach, likening the rupture to a propagating mixed mode shear crack. The rupture velocity is a function of the fracture energy in the volume around the crack tip, increasing with decreasing fracture energy. The velocity of rupture propagation is orders of magnitude faster than the displacement velocity across the fault. Earthquake ruptures typically propagate at velocities that are in the range 70–90% of the S-wave velocity, and this is independent of earthquake size. A small subset of earthquake ruptures appear to have propagated at speeds greater than the S-wave velocity. These [[supershear earthquake]]s have all been observed during large strike-slip events. The unusually wide zone of coseismic damage caused by the [[2001 Kunlun earthquake]] has been attributed to the effects of the [[sonic boom]] developed in such earthquakes. Some earthquake ruptures travel at unusually low velocities and are referred to as [[slow earthquake]]s. A particularly dangerous form of slow earthquake is the [[tsunami earthquake]], observed where the relatively low felt intensities, caused by the slow propagation speed of some great earthquakes, fail to alert the population of the neighboring coast, as in the [[1896 Sanriku earthquake]].&lt;ref name="NRS"&gt;{{cite book|last=National Research Council (U.S.).

===Tidal forces===
[[Tides]] may induce some [[seismicity]], see [[tidal triggering of earthquakes]] for details.

===Earthquake clusters===
Most earthquakes form part of a sequence, related to each other in terms of location and time.&lt;ref name=WAAFEC&gt;{{cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/step/explain.php|title=What are Aftershocks, Foreshocks, and Earthquake Clusters?|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511175245/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/step/explain.php|archivedate=2009-05-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most earthquake clusters consist of small tremors that cause little to no damage, but there is a theory that earthquakes can recur in a regular pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/parkfield/repeat.php|title=Repeating Earthquakes|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|date=January 29, 2009|accessdate=May 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aftershocks====
{{Main|Aftershock}}
[[File:2016 Central Italy earthquake wide.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|Magnitude of the [[August 2016 Central Italy earthquake|Central Italy earthquakes of August]] and [[October 2016 Central Italy earthquakes|October 2016]], of [[January 2017 Central Italy earthquakes|January 2017]] and the aftershocks (which continued to occur after the period shown here).]]
An aftershock is an earthquake that occurs after a previous earthquake, the mainshock. An aftershock is in the same region of the main shock but always of a smaller magnitude. If an aftershock is larger than the main shock, the aftershock is redesignated as the main shock and the original main shock is redesignated as a [[foreshock]]. Aftershocks are formed as the crust around the displaced [[Fault (geology)|fault plane]] adjusts to the effects of the main shock.&lt;ref name=WAAFEC/&gt;

====Earthquake swarms====
{{Main|Earthquake swarm}}
Earthquake swarms are sequences of earthquakes striking in a specific area within a short period of time. They are different from earthquakes followed by a series of [[aftershock]]s by the fact that no single earthquake in the sequence is obviously the main shock, therefore none have notable higher magnitudes than the other. An example of an earthquake swarm is the 2004 activity at [[Yellowstone National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/yvo/2004/Apr04Swarm.html|title=Earthquake Swarms at Yellowstone|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=2008-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, a swarm of earthquakes shook [[Southern California]]'s [[Imperial Valley]], showing the most recorded activity in the area since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Duke|first=Alan|title=Quake 'swarm' shakes Southern California|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/26/us/california-quake-swarm/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes a series of earthquakes occur in what has been called an ''earthquake storm'', where the earthquakes strike a fault in clusters, each triggered by the shaking or stress redistribution of the previous earthquakes. Similar to [[aftershock]]s but on adjacent segments of fault, these storms occur over the course of years, and with some of the later earthquakes as damaging as the early ones. Such a pattern was observed in the sequence of about a dozen earthquakes that struck the [[North Anatolian Fault]] in Turkey in the 20th century and has been inferred for older anomalous clusters of large earthquakes in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Poseidon's Horses: Plate Tectonics and Earthquake Storms in the Late Bronze Age Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean | journal = Journal of Archaeological Science | year = 2000 | author = Amos Nur | issn = 0305-4403 | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 43–63 | url = http://water.stanford.edu/nur/EndBronzeage.pdf | doi = 10.1006/jasc.1999.0431 | last2 = Cline | first2 = Eric H. | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090325050459/http://water.stanford.edu/nur/EndBronzeage.pdf | archivedate = 2009-03-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2003/earthquakestorms.shtml | title = Earthquake Storms | work = [[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]] | date = 1 April 2003 | accessdate = 2007-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Magnitude}}Intensity of earth quaking and magnitude of earthquakes==
Quaking or shaking of the earth is a common phenomenon undoubtedly known to humans from earliest times. Prior to the development of [[accelerograph|strong-motion accelerometers]] that can measure peak ground speed and acceleration directly, the intensity of the earth-shaking was estimated on the basis of the observed effects, as categorized on various [[seismic intensity scales]].  Only in the last century has the source of such shaking been identified as ruptures in the earth's crust, with the intensity of shaking at any locality dependent not only on the local ground conditions, but also on the strength or ''magnitude'' of the rupture, and on its distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bolt|1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Seismic magnitude scales#Richter|first scale for measuring earthquake magnitudes]] was developed by [[Charles F. Richter]] in 1935.  Subsequent scales (see [[seismic magnitude scales]]) have retained a key feature, where each unit represents a ten-fold difference in the amplitude of the ground shaking, and a 32-fold difference in energy. Subsequent scales are also adjusted to have approximately the same numeric value within the limits of the scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chung|Bernreuter|1980|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the mass media commonly reports earthquake magnitudes as "Richter magnitude" or "Richter scale", standard practice by most seismological authorities is to express an earthquake's strength on the [[seismic scale#Mw|moment magnitude]] scale, which is based on the actual energy released by an earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;The USGS policy for reporting magnitudes to the press was posted at [https://earthquake.usgs.gov/aboutus/docs/020204mag_policy.php USGS policy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504144754/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/aboutus/docs/020204mag_policy.php |date=2016-05-04 }}, but has been removed. A copy can be found at http://dapgeol.tripod.com/usgsearthquakemagnitudepolicy.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frequency of occurrence==
It is estimated that around 500,000 earthquakes occur each year, detectable with current instrumentation.

The number of seismic stations has increased from about 350 in 1931 to many thousands today. As a result, many more earthquakes are reported than in the past, but this is because of the vast improvement in instrumentation, rather than an increase in the number of earthquakes. The [[United States Geological Survey]] estimates that, since 1900, there have been an average of 18 major earthquakes (magnitude 7.0–7.9) and one great earthquake (magnitude 8.0 or greater) per year, and that this average has been relatively stable.&lt;ref&gt;

A recent increase in the number of major earthquakes has been noted, which could be explained by a cyclical pattern of periods of intense tectonic activity, interspersed with longer periods of low-intensity. However, accurate recordings of earthquakes only began in the early 1900s, so it is too early to categorically state that this is the case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/the-10-biggest-earthquakes-in-recorded-history.htm/ The 10 biggest earthquakes in history], Australian Geographic, March 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the world's earthquakes (90%, and 81% of the largest) take place in the 40,000&amp;nbsp;km long, horseshoe-shaped zone called the circum-Pacific seismic belt, known as the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]], which for the most part bounds the [[Pacific Plate]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Induced seismicity==
{{main|Induced seismicity}}
While most earthquakes are caused by movement of the Earth's [[tectonic plate]]s, human activity can also produce earthquakes. Four main activities contribute to this phenomenon: storing large amounts of water behind a [[dam]] (and possibly building an extremely heavy [[building]]), drilling and injecting liquid into [[water well|wells]], and by [[coal mining]] and [[oil well|oil drilling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Madrigal, Alexis|title=Top 5 Ways to Cause a Man-Made Earthquake|url=http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/06/top-5-ways-that.html|date=4 June 2008|work=Wired News|publisher=CondéNet|accessdate=2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the best known example is the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]] in China's [[Sichuan Province]] in May; this tremor resulted in 69,227 fatalities and is the [[List of natural disasters by death toll#Earthquakes|19th deadliest earthquake of all time]]. The [[Zipingpu Dam]] is believed to have fluctuated the pressure of the fault {{convert|1650|ft|m|0|}} away; this pressure probably increased the power of the earthquake and accelerated the rate of movement for the fault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/02/photogalleries/humans-cause-earthquakes/photo2.html|title=How Humans Can Trigger Earthquakes|publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]|date=February 10, 2009|accessdate=April 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest earthquake in Australia's history is also claimed to be induced by humanity, through coal mining.

==Measuring and locating earthquakes==
{{Main|Seismic magnitude scales|Seismology}}
The instrumental scales used to describe the size of an earthquake began with the [[Richter magnitude scale]] in the 1930s. It is a relatively simple measurement of an event's amplitude, and its use has become minimal in the 21st century. [[Seismic waves]] travel through the [[Earth's interior]] and can be recorded by [[seismometer]]s at great distances. The [[surface wave magnitude]] was developed in the 1950s as a means to measure remote earthquakes and to improve the accuracy for larger events. The [[moment magnitude scale]] measures the amplitude of the shock, but also takes into account the [[seismic moment]] (total rupture area, average slip of the fault, and rigidity of the rock). The [[Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale]], the [[Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale]], and the [[Mercalli intensity scale]] are based on the observed effects and are related to the intensity of shaking.

Every tremor produces different types of seismic waves, which travel through rock with different velocities:
* Longitudinal [[P-waves]] (shock- or pressure waves)
* Transverse [[S-waves]] (both body waves)
* [[Surface wave]]s — ([[Rayleigh wave|Rayleigh]] and [[Love wave|Love]] waves)
[[Propagation velocity]] of the seismic waves ranges from approx. 3&amp;nbsp;km/s up to 13&amp;nbsp;km/s, depending on the [[density]] and [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] of the medium. In the Earth's interior the shock- or P waves travel much faster than the S waves (approx. relation 1.7 : 1). The differences in travel time from the [[epicentre|epicenter]] to the observatory are a measure of the distance and can be used to image both sources of quakes and structures within the Earth. Also, the depth of the [[hypocenter]] can be computed roughly.

In solid rock P-waves travel at about 6 to 7&amp;nbsp;km per second; the velocity increases within the deep mantle to ~13&amp;nbsp;km/s. The velocity of S-waves ranges from 2–3&amp;nbsp;km/s in light sediments and 4–5&amp;nbsp;km/s in the Earth's crust up to 7&amp;nbsp;km/s in the deep mantle. As a consequence, the first waves of a distant earthquake arrive at an observatory via the Earth's mantle.

On average, the kilometer distance to the earthquake is the number of seconds between the P and S wave '''times 8'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2001/PamelaSpiegel.shtml |title=Speed of Sound through the Earth |publisher=Hypertextbook.com |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slight deviations are caused by inhomogeneities of subsurface structure. By such analyses of seismograms the Earth's core was located in 1913 by [[Beno Gutenberg]].

S waves and later arriving surface waves do main damage compared to P waves. P wave squeezes and expands material in the same direction it is traveling. S wave shakes the ground up and down and back and forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newsela.com/articles/govt-science-earthquakes/id/26756/|title=Newsela {{!}} The science of earthquakes|website=newsela.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earthquakes are not only categorized by their magnitude but also by the place where they occur. The world is divided into 754 [[Flinn–Engdahl regions]] (F-E regions), which are based on political and geographical boundaries as well as seismic activity. More active zones are divided into smaller F-E regions whereas less active zones belong to larger F-E regions.

Standard reporting of earthquakes includes its [[Richter magnitude scale|magnitude]], date and time of occurrence, [[geographic coordinates]] of its [[epicenter]], depth of the epicenter, geographical region, distances to population centers, location uncertainty, a number of parameters that are included in USGS earthquake reports (number of stations reporting, number of observations, etc.), and a unique event ID.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geographic.org/earthquakes/real_time_details.php?id=recenteqsww/Quakes/usc000f1s0.php&amp;lat=-10.7377&amp;lon=165.1378 |title=Magnitude 8.0 - SANTA CRUZ ISLANDS Earthquake Details|work=Global Earthquake Epicenters with Maps |author=Geographic.org |accessdate=2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although relatively slow seismic waves have traditionally been used to detect earthquakes, scientists realized in 2016 that gravitational measurements could provide instantaneous detection of earthquakes, and confirmed this by analyzing gravitational records associated with the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|2011 Tohoku-Oki]] ("Fukushima") earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/blog/post/changes-to-earths-gravity-offer-early-earthquake-warning|title=Earth's gravity offers earlier earthquake warnings|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/geoscience/gravity-shifts-could-sound-early-earthquake-alarm|title=Gravity shifts could sound early earthquake alarm|access-date=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of earthquakes==

The effects of earthquakes include, but are not limited to, the following:

===Shaking and ground rupture===
[[File:Haiti earthquake damage.jpg|thumb|Damaged buildings in [[Port-au-Prince]], [[2010 Haiti earthquake|Haiti]], January 2010.]]

Shaking and ground rupture are the main effects created by earthquakes, principally resulting in more or less severe damage to buildings and other rigid structures. The severity of the local effects depends on the complex combination of the earthquake [[Richter magnitude scale|magnitude]], the distance from the [[epicenter]], and the local geological and geomorphological conditions, which may amplify or reduce [[wave propagation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abag.ca.gov/bayarea/eqmaps/doc/contents.html |title=On Shaky Ground, Association of Bay Area Governments, San Francisco, reports 1995,1998 (updated 2003) |publisher=Abag.ca.gov |accessdate=2010-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090921082202/http://www.abag.ca.gov/bayarea/eqmaps/doc/contents.html |archivedate=2009-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ground-shaking is measured by [[ground acceleration]].

Specific local geological, geomorphological, and geostructural features can induce high levels of shaking on the ground surface even from low-intensity earthquakes. This effect is called site or local amplification. It is principally due to the transfer of the [[seismic]] motion from hard deep soils to soft superficial soils and to effects of seismic energy focalization owing to typical geometrical setting of the deposits.

Ground rupture is a visible breaking and displacement of the Earth's surface along the trace of the fault, which may be of the order of several meters in the case of major earthquakes. Ground rupture is a major risk for large engineering structures such as [[dams]], bridges and [[nuclear power stations]] and requires careful mapping of existing faults to identify any which are likely to break the ground surface within the life of the structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consrv.ca.gov/cgs/information/publications/cgs_notes/note_49/Documents/note_49.pdf|title=Guidelines for evaluating the hazard of surface fault rupture, California Geological Survey|publisher=California Department of Conservation|year=2002|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009065422/http://www.consrv.ca.gov/cgs/information/publications/cgs_notes/note_49/Documents/note_49.pdf|archivedate=2009-10-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Landslides and avalanches===
{{main|Landslide}}

Earthquakes, along with severe storms, volcanic activity, coastal wave attack, and wildfires, can produce slope instability leading to landslides, a major geological hazard. Landslide danger may persist while emergency personnel are attempting rescue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgs.gov/hazards/landslides/|title=Natural Hazards — Landslides|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=2008-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fires===
[[File:Sfearthquake3b.jpg|thumb|Fires of the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]]]]

Earthquakes can cause [[fire]]s by damaging [[electric power|electrical power]] or gas lines. In the event of water mains rupturing and a loss of pressure, it may also become difficult to stop the spread of a fire once it has started. For example, more deaths in the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] were caused by fire than by the earthquake itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/nca/1906/18april/index.php|title=The Great 1906 San Francisco earthquake of 1906|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=2008-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soil liquefaction===
{{Main|Soil liquefaction}}
Soil liquefaction occurs when, because of the shaking, water-saturated [[granular]] material (such as sand) temporarily loses its strength and transforms from a [[solid]] to a [[liquid]]. Soil liquefaction may cause rigid structures, like buildings and bridges, to tilt or sink into the liquefied deposits. For example, in the [[1964 Alaska earthquake]], soil liquefaction caused many buildings to sink into the ground, eventually collapsing upon themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/states/events/1964_03_28.php |title=Historic Earthquakes — 1964 Anchorage Earthquake |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |accessdate=2008-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623111831/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/states/events/1964_03_28.php |archivedate=2011-06-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tsunami===
[[File:2004-tsunami.jpg|thumb|The tsunami of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]]]
{{main|Tsunami}}

Tsunamis are long-wavelength, long-period sea waves produced by the sudden or abrupt movement of large volumes of water – including when an earthquake [[Submarine earthquake|occurs at sea]]. In the open ocean the distance between wave crests can surpass {{convert|100|km|mi|sp=us}}, and the wave periods can vary from five minutes to one hour. Such tsunamis travel 600–800&amp;nbsp;kilometers per hour (373–497 miles per hour), depending on water depth. Large waves produced by an earthquake or a submarine landslide can overrun nearby coastal areas in a matter of minutes. Tsunamis can also travel thousands of kilometers across open ocean and wreak destruction on far shores hours after the earthquake that generated them.&lt;ref name=Noson&gt;{{Cite book|last=Noson, Qamar, and Thorsen|publisher=Washington State Earthquake Hazards|year=1988|title=Washington Division of Geology and Earth Resources Information Circular 85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ordinarily, subduction earthquakes under magnitude 7.5 on the [[Richter Scale|Richter]] magnitude scale do not cause tsunamis, although some instances of this have been recorded. Most destructive tsunamis are caused by earthquakes of magnitude 7.5 or more.&lt;ref name=Noson/&gt;

===Floods===
{{main|Flood}}
A flood is an overflow of any amount of water that reaches land.&lt;ref&gt;[[MSN Encarta]] Dictionary. [http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861612277 Flood]. Retrieved on 2006-12-28.

However, floods may be secondary effects of earthquakes, if dams are damaged. Earthquakes may cause landslips to dam rivers, which collapse and cause floods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quakes.bgs.ac.uk/earthquakes/historical/historical_listing.htm |title=Notes on Historical Earthquakes |publisher=[[British Geological Survey]] |accessdate=2008-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516173115/http://www.quakes.bgs.ac.uk/earthquakes/historical/historical_listing.htm |archivedate=2011-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terrain below the [[Sarez Lake]] in [[Tajikistan]] is in danger of catastrophic flood if the [[landslide dam]] formed by the earthquake, known as the [[Usoi Dam]], were to fail during a future earthquake. Impact projections suggest the flood could affect roughly 5&amp;nbsp;million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3120693.stm|title=Fresh alert over Tajik flood threat|date=2003-08-03|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2008-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human impacts===
[[File:Ghajn Hadid Tower closer view.JPG|thumb|Ruins of the [[Għajn Ħadid Tower]], which collapsed in an earthquake in 1856]]

An earthquake may cause injury and loss of life, road and bridge damage, general [[property damage]], and collapse or destabilization (potentially leading to future collapse) of buildings. The aftermath may bring [[disease]], lack of basic necessities, mental consequences such as panic attacks, depression to survivors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nctsn.org/trauma-types/natural-disasters/earthquakes |title=Earthquake Resources |publisher=Nctsn.org |date= |accessdate=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and higher insurance premiums.

U.S. Geological Survey&lt;/ref&gt; Most houses in the area were [[yaodong]]s—dwellings carved out of [[loess]] hillsides—and many victims were killed when these structures collapsed. The [[1976 Tangshan earthquake]], which killed between 240,000 and 655,000 people, was the deadliest of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Spignesi, Stephen J. (2005).

Earthquakes that caused the greatest loss of life, while powerful, were deadly because of their proximity to either heavily populated areas or the ocean, where earthquakes often create [[tsunamis]] that can devastate communities thousands of kilometers away. Regions most at risk for great loss of life include those where earthquakes are relatively rare but powerful, and poor regions with lax, unenforced, or nonexistent seismic building codes.

==Prediction==

{{Main|Earthquake prediction}}

[[Earthquake prediction]] is a branch of the science of [[seismology]] concerned with the specification of the time, location, and [[seismic scale|magnitude]] of future earthquakes within stated limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Geller|Jackson|Kagan|Mulargia|1997|p=1616}}, following {{Harvtxt|Allen|1976|p=2070}}, who in turn followed {{Harvtxt|Wood|Gutenberg|1935}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many methods have been developed for predicting the time and place in which earthquakes will occur. Despite considerable research efforts by [[seismologist]]s, scientifically reproducible predictions cannot yet be made to a specific day or month.&lt;ref name="ludwin"&gt;[http://www.geophys.washington.edu/SEIS/PNSN/INFO_GENERAL/eq_prediction.html Earthquake Prediction].

==Forecasting==

{{Main|Earthquake forecasting}}

While [[forecasting]] is usually considered to be a type of [[prediction]], [[earthquake forecasting]] is often differentiated from [[earthquake prediction]]. Earthquake forecasting is concerned with the probabilistic assessment of general earthquake hazard, including the frequency and magnitude of damaging earthquakes in a given area over years or decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kanamori|2003}}, p. 1205.  See also {{Harvnb|International Commission on Earthquake Forecasting for Civil Protection|2011}}, p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; For well-understood faults the probability that a segment may rupture during the next few decades can be estimated.&lt;ref&gt;Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities in the San Francisco Bay Region, 2003 to 2032, 2003, {{cite web |url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/nca/wg02/index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218174649/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/nca/wg02/index.php |archivedate=2017-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pailoplee|first=Santi|date=2017-03-13|title=Probabilities of Earthquake Occurrences along the Sumatra-Andaman Subduction Zone|url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/geo.2017.9.issue-1/geo-2017-0004/geo-2017-0004.xml|journal=Open Geosciences|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=4|doi=10.1515/geo-2017-0004|issn=2391-5447|bibcode=2017OGeo....9....4P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Earthquake warning system]]s have been developed that can provide regional notification of an earthquake in progress, but before the ground surface has begun to move, potentially allowing people within the system's range to seek shelter before the earthquake's impact is felt.

==Preparedness==
{{main|Earthquake preparedness}}

The objective of [[earthquake engineering]] is to foresee the impact of earthquakes on buildings and other structures and to design such structures to minimize the risk of damage. Existing structures can be modified by [[seismic retrofitting]] to improve their resistance to earthquakes. [[Earthquake insurance]] can provide building owners with financial protection against losses resulting from earthquakes [[Emergency management]] strategies can be employed by a government or organization to mitigate risks and prepare for consequences.

Individuals can also take preparedness steps like securing [[water heater]]s and heavy items that could injure someone, locating shutoffs for utilities, and being educated about what to do when shaking starts. For areas near large bodies of water, earthquake preparedness encompasses the possibility of a [[tsunami]] caused by a large quake.

==Historical views==
[[File:Lycosthène.jpg|thumb|An image from a 1557 book depicting an earthquake in Italy in the 4th century BCE]]

From the lifetime of the Greek philosopher [[Anaxagoras]] in the 5th century BCE to the 14th century CE, earthquakes were usually attributed to "air (vapors) in the cavities of the Earth."&lt;ref name=World&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| title =Earthquakes | encyclopedia =Encyclopedia of World Environmental History | volume =1 | pages =358–364| publisher =Encyclopedia of World Environmental History | year =2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thales]] of Miletus, who lived from 625–547 (BCE) was the only documented person who believed that earthquakes were caused by tension between the earth and water.&lt;ref name=World/&gt; Other theories existed, including the Greek philosopher Anaxamines' (585–526 BCE) beliefs that short incline episodes of dryness and wetness caused seismic activity. The Greek philosopher Democritus (460–371 BCE) blamed water in general for earthquakes.&lt;ref name=World/&gt; [[Pliny the Elder]] called earthquakes "underground thunderstorms."&lt;ref name=World/&gt;

==Recent studies==

In recent studies, geologists claim that [[global warming]] is one of the reasons for increased seismic activity. According to these studies melting glaciers and rising sea levels disturb the balance of pressure on Earth's tectonic plates thus causing increase in the frequency and intensity of earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://environment.about.com/od/globalwarming/a/earthquakes.htm|title=Fire and Ice: Melting Glaciers Trigger Earthquakes, Tsunamis and Volcanos|publisher=about News|access-date=October 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In culture==

===Mythology and religion===
In [[Norse mythology]], earthquakes were explained as the violent struggling of the god [[Loki]]. When Loki, [[Aesir|god]] of mischief and strife, murdered [[Baldr]], god of beauty and light, he was punished by being bound in a cave with a poisonous serpent placed above his head dripping venom. Loki's wife [[Sigyn]] stood by him with a bowl to catch the poison, but whenever she had to empty the bowl the poison dripped on Loki's face, forcing him to jerk his head away and thrash against his bonds, which caused the earth to tremble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Snorri Sturluson|Sturluson, Snorri]]|title=Prose Edda|year=1220|isbn=978-1-156-78621-5|title-link=Prose Edda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Greek mythology]], [[Poseidon]] was the cause and god of earthquakes. When he was in a bad mood, he struck the ground with a [[trident]], causing earthquakes and other calamities. He also used earthquakes to punish and inflict fear upon people as revenge.&lt;ref name="Dimock1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=George E. Dimock|title=The Unity of the Odyssey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hS1acr-lOeEC&amp;pg=PA179|year=1990|publisher=Univ of Massachusetts Press|isbn=978-0-87023-721-8|pages=179–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japanese mythology]], [[Namazu (Japanese mythology)|Namazu]] (鯰) is a giant [[catfish]] who causes earthquakes. Namazu lives in the mud beneath the earth, and is guarded by the god [[Kashima (god)|Kashima]] who restrains the fish with a stone. When Kashima lets his guard fall, Namazu thrashes about, causing violent earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Namazu/|title=Namazu|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular culture===
In modern [[popular culture]], the portrayal of earthquakes is shaped by the memory of great cities laid waste, such as [[Great Hanshin earthquake|Kobe in 1995]] or [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|San Francisco in 1906]].&lt;ref name="Van Riper 60"&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Riper|first=A. Bowdoin|title=Science in popular culture: a reference guide|publisher=[[Greenwood Press]]|location=Westport|year=2002|page=60|isbn=978-0-313-31822-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fictional earthquakes tend to strike suddenly and without warning.&lt;ref name="Van Riper 60" /&gt; For this reason, stories about earthquakes generally begin with the disaster and focus on its immediate aftermath, as in ''Short Walk to Daylight'' (1972), ''[[A Wrinkle in the Skin|The Ragged Edge]]'' (1968) or ''[[Aftershock: Earthquake in New York]]'' (1999).&lt;ref name="Van Riper 60" /&gt; A notable example is Heinrich von Kleist's classic novella, ''[[The Earthquake in Chile]]'', which describes the destruction of Santiago in 1647. [[Haruki Murakami]]'s short fiction collection ''[[After the Quake]]'' depicts the consequences of the Kobe earthquake of 1995.

{{anchor|big one}}The most popular single earthquake in fiction is the hypothetical "Big One" expected of [[California]]'s [[San Andreas Fault]] someday, as depicted in the novels ''[[Richter 10]]'' (1996), ''[[Goodbye California (novel)|Goodbye California]]'' (1977), ''[[2012 (film)|2012]]'' (2009) and ''[[San Andreas (film)|San Andreas]]'' (2015) among other works.&lt;ref name="Van Riper 60" /&gt; Jacob M. Appel's widely anthologized short story, ''A Comparative Seismology'', features a con artist who convinces an elderly woman that an apocalyptic earthquake is imminent.&lt;ref&gt;JM Appel. A Comparative Seismology. Weber Studies (first publication), Volume 18, Number 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary depictions of earthquakes in film are variable in the manner in which they reflect human psychological reactions to the actual trauma that can be caused to directly afflicted families and their loved ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goenjian | first1 = Najarian | last2 = Pynoos | first2 = Steinberg | last3 = Manoukian | first3 = Tavosian | last4 = Fairbanks | first4 = AM| year = 1994 | title = Posttraumatic stress disorder in elderly and younger adults after the 1988 earthquake in Armenia | url = | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 151 | issue = 6| pages = 895–901 | pmid = 8185000 | last5 = Manoukian | first5 = G | last6 = Tavosian | first6 = A | last7 = Fairbanks | first7 = LA | doi=10.1176/ajp.151.6.895}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disaster mental health response research emphasizes the need to be aware of the different roles of loss of family and key community members, loss of home and familiar surroundings, loss of essential supplies and services to maintain survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = Gao | last2 = Shinfuku | first2 = Zhang | last3 = Zhao | first3 = Shen | year = 2000 | title = Longitudinal Study of Earthquake-Related PTSD in a Randomly Selected Community Sample in North China | url = | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 157 | issue = 8| pages = 1260–1266 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.157.8.1260 | pmid = 10910788 | last4 = Zhang | first4 = H | last5 = Zhao | first5 = C | last6 = Shen | first6 = Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goenjian | first1 = Steinberg | last2 = Najarian | first2 = Fairbanks | last3 = Tashjian | first3 = Pynoos | year = 2000 | title = Prospective Study of Posttraumatic Stress, Anxiety, and Depressive Reactions After Earthquake and Political Violence | url = http://smrrc.org/PDF+files/mass_fatality/Posttraumatic+Stress+and+Depressive+Reactions.pdf | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 157 | issue = 6 | pages = 911–6 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.157.6.911 | pmid = 10831470 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170810011421/http://www.smrrc.org/PDF%20files/mass_fatality/Posttraumatic%20Stress%20and%20Depressive%20Reactions.pdf | archivedate = 2017-08-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly for children, the clear availability of caregiving adults who are able to protect, nourish, and clothe them in the aftermath of the earthquake, and to help them make sense of what has befallen them has been shown even more important to their emotional and physical health than the simple giving of provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coates | first1 = SW | authorlink = Susan Coates | authorlink2 = Daniel Schechter | last2 = Schechter | first2 = D | year = 2004 | title = Preschoolers' traumatic stress post-9/11: relational and developmental perspectives.

'''Elastic Recoil Detection Analysis''' ('''ERDA'''), also referred to as forward recoil scattering (or, contextually, spectrometry), is an Ion Beam Analysis technique in [[materials science]] to obtain elemental concentration depth profiles in [[thin films]].&lt;ref name=Assmann1994&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Assmann |first1=W. |last2=Huber |first2=H. |last3=Steinhausen |first3=Ch. |last4=Dobler |first4=M. |last5=Glückler |first5=H. |last6=Weidinger |first6=A. |title=Elastic recoil detection analysis with heavy ions. |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section B: Beam Interactions with Materials and Atoms |volume=89 |issue=1-4 |pages=131–139 |publisher=Elsevier B.V. |date=1 May 1994 |doi=10.1016/0168-583X(94)95159-4 |ref=none |bibcode = 1994NIMPB..89..131A }}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 May 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This technique is known by several different names. These names are listed below. In the technique of ERDA, an energetic [[ion beam]] is directed at a sample to be characterized and (as in [[Rutherford backscattering spectrometry|Rutherford backscattering]]) there is an elastic nuclear interaction between the [[ions]] of beam and the [[atoms]] of the target sample. Such interactions are commonly of [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb]] nature. Depending on the [[Kinetics (physics)|kinetics]] of the [[ions]], [[Cross section (physics)|cross section]] area, and the loss of energy of the ions in the matter, Elastic Recoil Detection Analysis helps determine the quantification of the [[elemental analysis]]. It also provides information about the depth profile of the sample.

The incident energetic ions can have a wide range of [[energy]] from 2 MeV to 200 MeV. The energy of the beam depends on the sample to be studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brijs|first1=B.|last2=Deleu |first2=J. |last3=Conard |first3=T. |last4=De Witte |first4=H. |last5=Vandervorst |first5=W. |last6=Nakajima |first6=K. |last7=Kimura |first7=K. |last8=Genchev |first8=I. |last9=Bergmaier |first9=A. |last10=Goergens |first10=L. |last11=Neumaier |first11=P. |last12=Dollinger |first12=G. |last13=Döbeli |first13=M. |title=Characterization of ultra thin oxynitrides: A general approach|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section B: Beam Interactions with Materials and Atoms|volume=161-163|pages=429–434|doi=10.1016/S0168-583X(99)00674-6|bibcode = 2000NIMPB.161..429B|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dollinger 311–315"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dollinger|first=G.|author2=Bergmaier, A. |author3=Faestermann, T. |author4= Frey, C.

Thus, ERD usually employs appropriate source and detectors to detect recoiled atoms.

However, such experimental setup is expensive and along with a source requirement of high energy ions appears to make this technique relatively less commonly used for materials characterization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Avasthi|first=DK|author2=Acharya, MG |author3=Tarey, RD |author4=Malhotra, LK |author5= Mehta, GK |title=Hydrogen profiling and the stoichiometry of an a-SiNx: H film|journal=Vacuum|volume=46|issue=3|pages=265–267|doi=10.1016/0042-207X(94)00056-5 |date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the angle of incidence that an ion beam makes with the sample must also be taken into account for correct analysis of the sample. This is because, depending on this angle, the recoiled atoms will be collected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maas|first=Adrianus Johannes Henricus|title=Elastic recoil detection analysis with [alpha]-particles|date=1998|publisher=Eindhoven University of Technology|location=Eindhoven|isbn=9789038606774}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is not very clear, the assumption for why this technique is not very well known would be due to the fact that it is hard to have a perfect combination of the source, the angle of incidence, and the detector to have the best characterization of the sample. Such problem would make the technique very time consuming and tedious.

This article provides information about ERDA that has been around for a long time, since the mid-1970s, still not very well known. The article provides detailed information about the High ion Incident ERDA. However, Low ion Incident ERDA is still not neglected. The comparative analysis of overall ERDA with other techniques such as TEM, AFM, XRR, NR, VASE, XPS, and DSIMS is also mentioned. The article briefly touches upon the history of ERDA but the main focus is on the technique itself.  Comprehensive information on the instrumentation as well as its applications in elemental characterization and depth profile are provided.

ERDA and RBS have similar theory but minor differences in the set-up of the experiment. In case of RBS, the detector is placed in the back of the sample whereas in ERDA, the detector is placed in the front. This difference in the set-up is shown in figure 1 on the right.

==Comparative Analysis==
There are several techniques used today for characterization of materials. Combination of techniques is usually needed in order to obtain correct characterization. When comparing several techniques, important parameters like detection limit, depth resolution and lateral resolution must be taken into account. For this purpose, comparisons of several techniques have been shown in the table below.

==Characteristics of ERDA==
The main characteristics of ERDA are listed below.&lt;ref name="Assmann1994"/&gt; 
* A variety of elements can be analyzed simultaneously as long as the atomic number of recoiled ion is smaller than the atomic number of the primary ion.
* The sensitivity of this technique, primarily depending upon scattering cross-section area, and the method has almost equal sensitivity to all light elements. In this case the light element is any element which has atomic number between 2 and 50.&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt;
* Depth resolution is depended upon stopping power of heavy ions after interactions with sample, and the detection of scattered primary ions is reduced due to the narrow scattering cone of heavy ions scattering from light elements.
* Gas-ionization detector provides efficient recoil detection and thus minimizes the exposure of sample to the ion beam making this a non-destructive technique. This is important for accurate measurement of hydrogen which is known for its instability and its loss under ion beam irradiation.
Such characteristics have led to many groups and scientists to explore applications of ERDA.

==History==

ERDA was first demonstrated by L’Ecuyer et al. in 1976. They had used 25-40 MeV &lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;Cl ions were used to detect the recoils in the sample.&lt;ref name=LEcuyer1&gt;{{cite journal|last=L’Ecuyer|first=J.|author2=Brassard, C. |author3=Cardinal, C. |author4=Chabbal, J. |author5=Deschênes, L. |author6=Labrie, J.P. |author7=Terreault, B. |author8=Martel, J.G. |author9=St. Jacques, R.  |title=An accurate and sensitive method for the determination of the depth distribution of light elements in heavy materials|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|year=1976|volume=47|issue=1|pages=381|doi=10.1063/1.322288|bibcode = 1976JAP....47..381L }}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 April 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After more than three decades, ERDA has been divided into two main groups. First is the Light incident Ion ERDA (LI-ERDA) and the second is the Heavy incident Ion ERDA (HI-ERDA).

LI-ERDA uses low voltage single-ended accelerators, whereas the HI-ERDA uses large tandem accelerators. These techniques were mainly developed after heavy ion accelerators were introduced in the materials research. LI-ERDA is also often performed using a relatively low energy (2 MeV) 4He beam specifically to depth profile hydrogen. In this technique, multiple detectors are used:  at backscattering angles to detect heavier elements by RBS and forward (recoil) detector to simultaneously detect the recoiled hydrogen. The recoil detector for LI-ERDA typically has a “range foil” which is typically a Mylar foil placed in front of the detector for blocking scattered incident ions but allow lighter recoiling target atoms to pass through to the detector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gauglitz|first=ed. by G.|title=Handbook of spectroscopy|date=2002|publisher=Wiley-VCH|location=Weinheim|isbn=9783527297825|author2=Vo-Dinh, T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually a 10&amp;nbsp;µm thick Mylar foil is able to completely stop 2.6 MeV He+ ions but allows the recoiled protons to go through with a low energy loss.

HI-ERDA is more widely used compared to LI-ERDA because it can be used to study a lot more variety of elements compared to LI-ERDA. It can be used to identify heavy elements. It is used to detect recoiled target atoms and scattered beam ions using several detectors namely silicon diode detector, time-of-flight detector, gas ionization detector, etc. Such detectors are described below.&lt;ref name="Dollinger 311–315"/&gt; Main advantage of HI-ERDA is its ability to obtain quantitative depth profiling information of all the sample elements in one measurement. Recent studies have shown that depth resolution obtained by using this technique is excellent. Depth resolution less than 1&amp;nbsp;nm can be obtained with good quantitative accuracy thus giving these techniques significant advantages over other surface analysis methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tomita|first=Mitsuhiro|author2=Akutsu, Haruko |author3=Oshima, Yasunori |author4=Sato, Nobutaka |author5=Mure, Shoichi |author6=Fukuyama, Hirofumi |author7= Ichihara, Chikara |title=Depth profile analysis of helium in silicon with high-resolution elastic recoil detection analysis|journal=Journal of Vacuum Science &amp; Technology B: Microelectronics and Nanometer Structures|volume=28|issue=3|pages=554|doi=10.1116/1.3425636|bibcode = 2010JVSTB..28..554T |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the accessible depth of 300&amp;nbsp;nm can be achieved using this technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=G.D. |author2=Kim J.K. |author3=Kim, Y.S. |author4=Cho, S. Y. |author5=Woo, H. J.|title=Elastic Recoil Detection by Time of Flight System for Analysis of Light Elements in Thin Film|journal=Journal of the Korean Physical Society|date=5 May 1998|volume=32|issue=5|pages=739, 743|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wide range of ion beams including &lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;Cl, &lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt;Cu, &lt;sup&gt;127&lt;/sup&gt;I, and &lt;sup&gt;197&lt;/sup&gt;Au, with different energies can be used in this technique in order for recoil to occur.

It must be noted that LI-ERDA and HI-ERDA both provide similar information. The difference in the name of the technique is only due to the type of ion beam used as a source.

The setup and the experimental conditions affect the performances of both of these techniques. Factors such as multiple scattering, and ion beam induced damage must be taken into account before obtaining the data because these processes can affect the data interpretation, quantification and the accuracy of the study. Additionally, the incident angle and the scattered angle help determine the sample surface topography. Incorporating surface topography into Ion Beam Analysis technique, a reliable characterization of layers of a surface can be obtained.

==Prominent Features of ERDA==
ERDA is very similar to RBS, but instead of detecting the projectile at the back angle, the recoils are detected in the forward direction. Doyle and Peercey in 1979 were able to establish the use of this technique for hydrogen depth profiling. Some of the prominent features of ERDA with high energy heavy ions are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elliman|first=R.G.|author2=Timmers, H. |author3=Palmer, G.R. |author4= Ophel, T.R. |title=Limitations to depth resolution in high-energy, heavy-ion elastic recoil detection analysis|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section B: Beam Interactions with Materials and Atoms|volume=136-138|pages=649–653|doi=10.1016/S0168-583X(97)00879-3|bibcode = 1998NIMPB.136..649E |date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Large recoil cross section with heavy ions provides good sensitivity. Moreover, all chemical elements, including hydrogen, can be detected simultaneously with similar sensitivity and depth resolution.&lt;ref name="Timmers"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Timmers|first=H|author2=Elimana R.G. |author3=Ophelb T.R. |author4=Weijersa T.D |title=Elastic Recoil detection using heavy ion beams}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Concentrations of 0.1 atomic percent can be easily detected. The sampling depth depends on the sample material and is of the order of 1.5-2.5&amp;nbsp;µm. For the surface region, a depth resolution of 10&amp;nbsp;nm can be achieved. The resolution deteriorates, with increasing depth due to several physical processes mainly the energy straggling and multi-scattering of the ions in the sample.&lt;ref name="Timmers"/&gt;
* Same recoil cross section for a wide mass range of target atoms&lt;ref name="Assmann1994"/&gt; 
* The unique characteristic of this technique is that element depth profiling of a wide range of elements from hydrogen to rare earth elements.&lt;ref name="Assmann1994"/&gt;

ERDA can overcome some of the limitations of Rutherford backscattering (RBS). ERDA has enabled depth profiling of elements from lightest elements like hydrogen up to heavy elements with high resolution in the light mass region as discussed above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Avasthi|first=DK|title=Role of swift heavy ions in materials characterization and modification|journal=Vacuum|volume=48|issue=12|pages=1011–1015|doi=10.1016/S0042-207X(97)00114-0|date=1997|bibcode=1997Vacuu..48.1011A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, this technique has been highly sensitive because of the use of large area position sensitive telescope detectors This detector is used especially when the elements in the sample have similar masses. Telescope detectors are one way to distinguish such elements in the sample as it becomes extremely difficult to separate the elements using a normal detector.&lt;ref name="Assmann1994"/&gt;

==Principles of ERDA==

The calculations that model this process are relatively simple, assuming projectile energy is in the range corresponding to Rutherford scattering. Projectile energy range for light incident ions is in 0.5-3.0 MeV/nucleon range.&lt;ref name=Dollinger1995&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dollinger|first=G.|author2=Bergmaier, A. |author3=Faestermann, T. |author4= Frey, C. M. |title=High resolution depth profile analysis by elastic recoil detection with heavy ions|journal=Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry|date=1 October 1995|volume=353|issue=3-4|pages=311–315|doi=10.1007/s0021653530311}}&lt;/ref&gt; For heavier projectile ions such as &lt;sup&gt;127&lt;/sup&gt;I the energy range is usually between 60-120 MeV/nucleon;&lt;ref name=Dollinger1995/&gt; and for medium heavy ion beams,&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl is a common ion beam used with an energy of approximately 30 MeV/nucleon.&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt; For the instrumentation section, the focus will be on heavy ion bombardment. The ''E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' transferred by projectile ions of mass ''m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and energy ''E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' to sample atoms of mass ''m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' recoiling at an angle ''ϕ'', with respect to the incidence direction is given by the following equation.&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt;

:(1)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;E_2 = \frac{(4m_1 m_2)}{(m_1 + m_2)^2}(E_1 \cos^2 \phi)&lt;/math&gt;

Equation 1 models the energy transfer from the incident ions striking the sample atoms and the recoiling effect of the target atoms with an angle of ''ϕ''. For heavier ions in elastic recoil detection analysis, if ''m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt;&lt;1, all recoiling ions have similar velocities.&lt;ref name=Dollinger1995/&gt; It can be deduced from the previous equation the maximum scattering angle, ''θ&lt;sup&gt;’&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;'', as equation 2 describes:&lt;ref name=Dollinger1995/&gt;

:(2)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\theta_{max} = \arcsin \frac {m_2}{m_1}&lt;/math&gt;

Using these parameters, absorber foils do not need to be incorporated into the instrument design. When using heavy ion beams and the parameters above, the geometry can be estimated as to allow for incident particle collision and scattering at an angle deflected away from the detector. This will prevent degradation of the detector from the more intense beam energies.

The differential elastic recoil cross-section ''σ&lt;sub&gt;ERD&lt;/sub&gt;'' is given by:&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt;

:(3)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ERD} = \left ( \frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{2E_1} \right ) ^2 \left ( \frac{m_1+m_2}{m_2} \right ) ^2 \cos^{-3} \phi&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the atomic numbers of projectile and sample atoms, respectively.&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt; For ''m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt;&lt;1 and with approximation ''m=2Z''; ''Z'' being the atomic number of ''Z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''. In equation (3) two essential consequences can be seen, first the sensitivity is roughly the same for all elements and second it has a ''Z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;'' dependence on the projector of the ion.&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt; This allows for the use of low energy beam currents in HI-ERDA preventing sample degradation and excessive heating of the specimen.

When using heavy ion beams, care must be taken for beam-induced damage in sample such as sputtering or amorphization. If only nuclear interaction is taken into account, it has been shown that the ratio of recoiling to displaced atoms is independent of ''Z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and only weakly dependent on the projectile mass of the incident ion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yu|first=R.|author2=Gustafsson, T.|title=Determination of the abundance of adsorbed light atoms on a surface using recoil scattering|journal=Surface Science|volume=177|issue=2|date=December 1986|pages=L987-L993|doi=10.1016/0039-6028(86)90133-0|bibcode = 1986SurSc.177L.987Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; With heavy ion bombardment, it has been shown that the sputter yield by the ion beam on the sample increases for nonmetallic samples&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seiberling|first=L.E.|author2=Cooper, B.H. |author3=Griffith, J.E. |author4=Mendenhall, M.H. |author5=Tombrello, T.A. |title=The sputtering of insulating materials by fast heavy ions|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research|volume=198|issue=1|year=1982|pages=17–25|bibcode = 1982NIMPR.198...17S |doi = 10.1016/0167-5087(82)90045-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; and enhanced radiation damage in superconductors. In any case, the acceptance angle of the detector system should be as large as possible to minimize the radiation damage. However, it may reduce the depth profiling and elemental analysis due to the ion beam not being able to penetrate the sample.
 
The figure on the right summarizes the principles of ERDA and how a spectrum is obtained.

This demand of a large acceptance angle, however, is in conflict with the requirement of optimum depth resolution dependency on the detection geometry. In the surface approximation and assuming constant energy loss the depth resolution ''δx'' can be written:&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt;

:(4)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\delta x = \frac{\delta E_2}{E_2} S_{rel}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''S&lt;sub&gt;rel&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the relative energy loss factor defined by:&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt;

:(5)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;S_{rel} = \frac{\frac{d E_1}{dx}}{E_1} \frac{1}{\sin \alpha} + \frac{\frac{d E_2}{dx}}{E_2} \frac{1}{\sin \beta}&lt;/math&gt;

here, ''α'' and ''β'' are the incidence angles of the beam and exit angle of the recoiling ion respectively, connected to the scattering angle ''ϕ'' by ''ϕ=α+β''.&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt; It should be noticed here that the depth resolution depends on the relative energy resolution only, as well as the relative stopping power of incoming and outgoing ions.&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt; The detector resolution and energy broadening associated with the measuring geometry contribute to the energy spread, ''δE''. The detector acceptance angle and the finite beam spot size define a scattering angle range ''δϕ'' causing a kinematic energy spread ''δE&lt;sub&gt;kin&lt;/sub&gt;'' according to equation 6:&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt;
  
:(6)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\delta E_{kin} = 2 E_2 \tan\phi \ \delta\phi&lt;/math&gt;

A detailed analysis of the different contributions to depth resolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stoquert|first=J.P.|author2=Guillaume, G. |author3=Hage-Ah, M. |author4=Grob, J.J. |author5=Gamer, C. |author6=Siffert, P. |title=Determination of concentration profiles by elastic recoil detection with a ΔE−E gas telescope and high energy incident heavy ions|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section B|volume=44|year=1989|pages=184–194|bibcode = 1989NIMPB..44..184S |doi = 10.1016/0168-583X(89)90426-6 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that this kinematic effect is the predominant term near the surface, severely limiting the permitted detector acceptance angle, whereas energy straggling dominates the resolution at larger depth.&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt; For example, if one estimates ''δϕ'' for a scattering angle of 37.5° causing a kinematic energy shift comparable to typical detector energy resolutions of 1%, the angular spread ''δψ'' must be less than 0.4°.&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt; The angular spread can be maintained within this range by contributions from the beam spot size; however, the solid angle geometry of the detector is only 0.04 msr. Therefore, a detector system with large solid angle as well as high depth resolution may enable corrections for the kinematic energy shift.

In an elastic scattering event, the kinematics requires that the target atom is recoiled with significant energy.&lt;ref name=Jeynes1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jeynes|first=Chris|author2=Webb, Roger P. |author3=Lohstroh, Annika |title=Ion Beam Analysis: A Century of Exploiting the Electronic and Nuclear Structure of the Atom for Materials Characterisation|journal=Reviews of Accelerator Science and Technology|date=January 2011|volume=4|issue=1|pages=41–82|doi=10.1142/S1793626811000483}}&lt;!--|accessdate=27 April 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Equation 7 models the recoil kinematical factor that occurs during the ion bombardment.&lt;ref name=Jeynes1/&gt;

:(7)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;E \approx K E_0&lt;/math&gt;

:(8)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;K_s = \left (\frac{\cos \theta \pm \sqrt{r^2 - \sin^2 \theta}}{(1+r)} \right )^2&lt;/math&gt;

:(9)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;Kr = \frac{4r \, \cos^2 \phi}{(1+r)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:(10)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;r = \frac{M_1}{M_2}&lt;/math&gt;

Equation 7 gives a mathematical model of the collision event when the heavier ions in the beam strike the specimen. ''K&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' is termed the ''kinematical factor'' for the scattered particle (Eq. 8)&lt;ref name=Jeynes1/&gt; with a scattering angle of ''θ'', and the recoiled particle (Eq. 9)&lt;ref name=Jeynes1/&gt; with a recoil angle of ''Φ''.&lt;ref name=Jeynes1/&gt; The variable ''r'' is the ratio of mass of the incident nuclei to that of the mass of the target nuclei, (Eq. 10).&lt;ref name=Jeynes1/&gt; To achieve this recoil of particles, the specimen needs to be very thin and the geometries need to be precisely optimized to obtain accurate recoil detection. Since ERD beam intensity can damage the specimen and there has been growing interest to invest in the development of low energy beams for reducing the damage of the specimen.

The cathode is divided into two insulated halves, where particle entrance position is derived from charges induced on the left, ''l'', and right, ''r'', halves of the cathode.&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt; Using the following equation, ''x''-coordinates of particle positions, as they enter the detector, can be calculated from charges ''l'' and ''r'' :&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt;

:(11)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;x = \frac{l-r}{l+r}&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, the ''y''-coordinate is calculated from the following equation due to the position independence of the anode pulses:&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt;

:(12)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;y = \frac{l+r}{E_{tot}}&lt;/math&gt;

For transformation of the ''(x, y)'' information into scattering angle ''ϕ'' a removable calibration mask in front of the entrance window is used. This mask allows correction for ''x'' and ''y'' distortions too.&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt; For notation detail, the cathode has an ion drift time on the order of a few ms. To prevent ion saturation of the detector, a limit of 1&amp;nbsp;kHz must be applied to the number of particles entering the detector.

==Instrumentation==
Elastic Recoil Detection Analysis was originally developed for hydrogen detection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Doyle|first=B.L.|author2=Peercy, P.S. |author3=Gray, T.J. |author4=Cocke, C.L. |author5=Justiniano, E. |journal=IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science|issue=NS-30|year=1983|page=1252}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a light element (H, He, Li, C, O, Mg, K) profiling with an absorber foil in front of the energy detector for beam suppression.&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt; Using an absorber foil prevents the higher energy ion beam from striking the detector and causing degradation. Absorber foils increase the lifetime of the detector. More advanced techniques have been implemented to negate the use of absorber foils and the associated difficulties that arise through the use of it. In most cases, medium heavy ion beams, typically &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl ions, have been used for ERDA so far with energies around 30 MeV. Depth resolution and element profiling of thin films has been greatly advanced using elastic recoil detection analysis.&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt; Figure 2, on the left, depicts the interaction of a heavy ion beam striking the sample atoms and the resulting backscattering and recoil ions.&lt;ref name=Elliott1&gt;Elliott, Lee.

===Ion Source and Interactions===

[[File:Image of a Van de Graaff generator coupled with a particle accelerator.JPG|thumb|300 px|Figure 3: Image of a Van de Graaff generator coupled with a particle accelerator&lt;ref name=Monniaux&gt;[[Van de Graaff generator]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Particle accelerators, such as a magnetron or cyclotron, implement electromagnetic fields to achieve acceleration of elements.&lt;ref name=ECR/&gt; Atoms must be electrically charged (ionized) before they can be accelerated.&lt;ref name=ECR/&gt; Ionization involves the removal of electrons from the target atoms. A magnetron can be used to produce H- ions. [[Van de Graaff generator]]s have also been integrated with particle accelerators, shown in figure 3, for light ion beam generation.

For heavier ion production, for example, an electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) source can be used.&lt;ref name=ECR/&gt; Figure 4 shows a schematic diagram of an ECR. At the [http://www.nscl.msu.edu/tech/ionsources National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory], neutral atoms have their electrons removed using an ECR ion source.&lt;ref name=ECR/&gt; ECR works by ionizing the vapor of a desired element such as chlorine and iodine.  Further, utilizing this technique metals (Au, Ag, etc.) can also be ionized using a small oven to achieve a vapor phase.&lt;ref name=ECR&gt;.{{cite web|last1=Michigan State University|title=Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Sources|url=http://www.nscl.msu.edu/tech/ionsources|publisher=Michigan State University: National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory|accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vapor is maintained within a magnetic field long enough for the atoms to be ionized by collisions with electrons.&lt;ref name=ECR/&gt; Microwaves are applied to the chamber as to keep the electrons in motion.

The vapor is introduced via injection directly into the “magnetic bottle” or the magnetic field.&lt;ref name=ECR/&gt; Circular coils provide the shape for the magnetic bottle. The coils are found at the top and bottom of the chamber with a hexapole magnet around the sides.&lt;ref name=ECR/&gt; A hexapole magnet consists of permanent magnets or superconducting coils. The plasma is contained within the magnetic trap that is formed from electric current flowing in solenoids located on the sides of the chamber. A radial magnetic field, exerted by the hexapole magnetic, is applied to the system that also confines the plasma.&lt;ref name=ECR/&gt; Acceleration of the electrons is achieved using resonance. For this to occur, the electrons must pass through a resonance zone. In this zone, their gyrofrequency or cyclotron frequency is equal to the frequency of the microwave injected into the plasma chamber.&lt;ref name=ECR/&gt; [[Cyclotron frequency]] is defined as the frequency of a charged particle moving perpendicular to the direction of a uniform magnetic field ''B''.&lt;ref name=gyro&gt;{{cite book|last=Chen|first=Francis F.|title=Introduction to plasma physics and controlled fusion.|date=1984|publisher=Plemum Pr.|location=New York u.a.|isbn=0-306-41332-9|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the motion is always circular, cyclotron frequency-''ω'' in radians/second-can be described by the following equation:&lt;ref name="gyro"/&gt;

:(13)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\frac{|q|B}{m}&lt;/math&gt; ''='' ''ω''

where ''m'' is the mass of the particle, its charge is ''q'', and the velocity is ''v''. Ionization is a step-by-step process from collisions of the accelerated electrons with the desired vapor atoms. The gyrofrequency of an electron is calculated to be 1.76x107 Brad/second.&lt;ref name=NRL&gt;{{cite web|last=plasma formulary|first=NRL|title=NRL plasma formulary|url=http://www2.ipp.mpg.de/~dpc/nrl/|publisher=David Coster|accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now that the vapor of the desired has been ionized, they must be removed from the magnetic bottle. To do this, a high voltage is between the hexapoles applied to pull out the ions from the magnetic field.&lt;ref name=ECR/&gt; The extraction of the ions, from the chamber, is carried out using an electrode system through a hole in a positively biased plasma chamber.&lt;ref name=ECR/&gt; Once the ions have been extracted from the chamber, they are then sent to the cyclotron for acceleration.
It is very important that the ion source used is optimal for the experiment being carried out. To perform an experiment in a practical amount of time, the ions provided from the accelerator complex should have the correct desired energy.&lt;ref name=ECR/&gt; The quality and stability of the ion beam needs to be considered carefully, due to the fact that only the ions with the correct flight trajectory can be injected in the cyclotron and accelerated to the desired energy.&lt;ref name=ECR/&gt;

During ERDA, the idea is to place an ion beam source at a grazing angle to the sample. In this set up, the angle is calculated as to allow the incident ions to scatter off of the sample so that there is no contact made with the detector. The physical basis that has given the method its name stems from the elastic scattering of incident ions on a sample surface and detecting the recoiling sample atoms while the incident ions backscatter at such an angle, that they do not reach the detector; this is typically in reflection geometry,&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt; illustrated in figure shown:

Another method for preventing incident ions from making contact with the detector is to use an absorber foil. During analysis of the elastically recoiled particles, an absorber foil with selected specific thickness can be used to "stop" the heavy recoil and beam ions from reaching the detector; reducing the background noise. Incorporating an absorber into the experimental set up can be the most difficult to achieve. The stopping of the beam using either direct or scattered methods can only be accomplished without also stopping the light impurity atoms, if it is heavier (beam ions) than the impurity atoms being analyzed.&lt;ref name=Terreault1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Terreault|first=B. |author2=Martel, J.G. |author3=St‐Jacques, R.G. |author4=L'Ecuyer, J.|title=Depth profiling of light elements in materials with high‐energy ion beams|journal=Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology|volume=14|date=January 1977|pages=492–500|doi=10.1116/1.569240|bibcode = 1977JVST...14..492T|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are advantages when using absorber films:

:::1) The large beam ''Z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' gives rise to a large Rutherford cross section and because of the kinematics of heavy-on-light collisions that cross section is nearly independent of the target, if ''M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;&gt; M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''M ~2Z''; this helps in reducing the background.&lt;ref name=Terreault1/&gt;
:::2) The higher stopping power provides a good depth resolution of  ~300 Angstroms, limited in fact by straggling in the absorber.&lt;ref name=Terreault1/&gt;

The major criterion for absorber foils used in ERDA is whether a recoiling impurity atom can be transmitted through the absorber, preferably a commercially available metal foil, while stopping heavy particles.&lt;ref name=Terreault1/&gt; Since the lighter atoms leave the absorber with smaller energies, the kinematic calculations do not provide much help. Favorable results have been obtained by using heavier ion beams of approximately 1 MeV/ nucleon.&lt;ref name=Terreault1/&gt; The best overall candidate is the &lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;Cl ion beam; although, &lt;sup&gt;79&lt;/sup&gt;Br would give better sensitivity by one order of magnitude compared to the &lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;Cl ion beam. The mass resolution, of the detector at ''θ= 0°'', of thin samples is ''ΔM/Δx'' ~ 0.3 amu/1000 Angstroms of the profile width. With thick samples, the mass resolution is feasible at θ≤30°. In thicker samples there is some degradation of mass resolution and slight loss of sensitivity. The detector solid angle has to be closed, but the thick sample can take more current without heating, which decreases sample degradation.&lt;ref name=Terreault1/&gt;

===Detectors===
Once the ion beam has ionized target sample atoms, the sample ions are recoiled toward the detector. The beam ions are scattered at an angle that does not permit them to reach the detector. The sample ions pass through an entrance window of the detector, and depending on the type of detector used, the signal is converted into a spectrum.

====Silicon Diode Detector====
In elastic recoil detection analysis, a silicon diode is the most common detector.&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt; This type of detector is commonly used, however, there are some major disadvantages when using this type of detector. For example, the energy resolution decreases significantly with a Si detector when detecting heavy recoiled ions. There is also a possibility of damage to the detector by radiation exposure. These detectors have a short functional lifetime (5–10 years) when doing heavy ion analysis.&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt; One of the main advantages of silicon detectors is their simplicity. However, they have to be used with a so-called “range foil” to range out the forward scattered heavy beam ions. Therefore, the simple range foil ERD has two major disadvantages: first, the loss of energy resolution due to the energy straggle and second, thickness inhomogeneity of the range foil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szilágyi|first=E.|author2=Pászti, F. |author3=Quillet, V. |author4=Abel, F. |title=Optimization of the depth resolution in ERDA of H using 12C ions|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section B|volume=85|year=1994|pages=63–67|bibcode = 1994NIMPB..85...63S |doi = 10.1016/0168-583X(94)95787-8 |issue=1-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the intrinsic indistinguishability of the signals for the various different recoiled target elements.&lt;ref name=Jeynes1/&gt; Aside from the listed disadvantages, ERDA range foils with silicon detectors is still a powerful method and is relatively simple to work with.

====Time of Flight Detector====
Another method of detection for ERDA is time of flight (TOF)-ERD. This method does not present the same issues, as those for the silicon detector. However, the throughput of TOF detectors is limited; the detection is performed in a serial fashion (one ion in the detector at a time). The longer the TOF for ions, the better the time resolution (equivalent to energy resolution) will be.&lt;ref name=Jeynes1/&gt; TOF spectrometers that have an incorporated solid state detector must be confined to small solid angles. When performing HI-ERDA, TOF detectors are often used and/or ''∆E/E'' detectors-such as ionization chambers.&lt;ref name=IBADamage&gt;{{cite book|last=Vickridge|first=D. Benzeggouta|title=Handbook on Best Practice for Minimising Beam Induced Damage during IBA|date=1 March 2011|publisher=Spirit Damage Handbook|location=Université de Pierre et Marie Curie,  UMR7588 du CNRS, Paris|page=17|url=http://spirit-ion.eu/tl_files/spirit_ion/files/newsletters/Spirit%20Damage%20Handbook%20V1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of detectors usually implement small solid angles for higher depth resolution.&lt;ref name="IBADamage"/&gt; Figure 6, on the left, shows a Time-of-Flight detector commonly used in ERDA.&lt;ref name=Elliott1/&gt; Heavier ions have a longer flight time than the lighter ions. Detectors in modern time-of-flight instruments have improved sensitivity, temporal and spatial resolution, and lifetimes.&lt;ref name=tof&gt;{{cite web|last=Detectors |first=TOF |title=TOF-Detectors |url=http://www.photonis.com/en/ism/23-time-of-flight-detectors.html |publisher=Photonis |accessdate=9 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512224903/http://www.photonis.com/en/ism/23-time-of-flight-detectors.html |archivedate=12 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hi mass bipolar (high mass ion detection), Gen 2 Ultra Fast (twice as fast as traditional detectors), and High temperature (operated up to 150&amp;nbsp;°C) TOF are just a few of the commercially available detectors integrated with time-of-flight instruments.&lt;ref name="tof"/&gt; Linear and reflectron-TOF are the more common instruments used.

====Ionization Detector====
A third type of detector is the gas ionization detector. The gas ionization detectors have some advantages over silicon detectors, for example, they are completely impervious to beam damage, since the gas can be replenished continuously.&lt;ref name=Jeynes1/&gt; Nuclear experiments with large area ionization chambers increase the particle and position resolution have been used for many years and can easily be assimilated to any specific geometry.&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt; The limiting factor on energy resolution using this type of detector is the entrance window, which needs to be strong enough to withstand the atmospheric pressure of the gas, 20-90 mbar.&lt;ref name=Jeynes1/&gt; Ultra-thin silicon nitride windows have been introduced, together with dramatic simplifications in the design, which have been demonstrated to be nearly as good as more complex designs for low energy ERD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mallepell|first=M.|author2=Döbeli, M. |author3=Suter, M. |title=Annular gas ionization detector for low energy heavy ion backscattering spectrometry.|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section B: Beam Interactions with Materials and Atoms|volume=267|issue=7|year=2009|pages=1193–1198|doi=10.1016/j.nimb.2009.01.031|bibcode = 2009NIMPB.267.1193M }}&lt;/ref&gt; These detectors have also been implemented in heavy ion Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry. Figure 7 shows the Gas Ionization chamber with Isobutane as the detector gas.&lt;ref name=Elliott1/&gt; [[File:Gas ionization chamber (1).png|thumb|300 px|Figure 7: Gas Ionization Chamber showing the positive charges migrating toward the cathode and the negatively charged ions migrating toward the sub divided anode through a Frisch Grid.&lt;ref name=Elliott1/&gt;]]

The energy resolution obtained from this detector is better than a silicon detector when using ion beams heavier than helium ions. There are various designs of ionization detectors but a general schematic of the detector consists of a transversal field ionization chamber with a Frisch grid positioned between anode and cathode electrodes. The anode is subdivided into two plates separated by a specific distance.&lt;ref&gt;For a more detailed description of ionization detector design, see {{cite journal|last=Assmann|first=W.|author2=Hartung, P. |author3=Huber, H. |author4=Staat, P. |author5=Steinhausen, C. |author6=Steffens, H. |title=Elastic recoil detection analysis with heavy ions|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section B|volume=85|year=1994|pages=726–731|bibcode = 1994NIMPB..85..726A |doi = 10.1016/0168-583X(94)95911-0 |issue=1-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the anode, signals ''∆E''(energy lost), ''E&lt;sub&gt;rest&lt;/sub&gt;''(residual energy after loss),&lt;ref name=swiftions&gt;{{cite book|last=Mehta|first=D.K.

A polypropylene foil was used as the entrance window. It has to be noted that the foil thickness homogeneity is of more importance for the detector energy resolution than the absolute thickness.&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt; If heavy ions are used and detected, the effect of energy loss straggling will be easily surpassed by the energy loss variation, which is a direct consequence of different foil thicknesses. The cathode electrode is divided in two insulated halves, thus information of particle entrance position is derived from charges induced at the right and left halves.&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt;

===ERDA and Energy Detection of Recoiled Sample Atoms===
ERDA in transmission geometry, where only the energy of the recoiling sample atoms is measured, was extensively used for contamination analysis of target foils for nuclear physics experiments.&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt; This technique is excellent for discerning different contaminants of foils used in sensitive experiments, such as carbon contamination. Using  &lt;sup&gt;127&lt;/sup&gt;I ion beam, a profile of various elements can be obtained and the amount of contamination can be determined. High levels of carbon contamination could be associated with beam excursions on the support, such as a graphite support. This could be corrected by using a different support material. Using a Mo support, the carbon content could be reduced from 20-100 at.% to 1-2 at.% level of the oxygen contamination probably originating from residual gas components.&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt; For nuclear experiments, high carbon contamination would result in extremely high background and the experimental results would be skewed or less differentiable with the background. With ERDA and heavy ion projectiles, valuable information can be obtained on the light element content of thin foils even if only the energy of the recoils is measured.&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt;

===ERDA and Particle Identification===
Generally, the energy spectra of different recoil elements overlap due to finite sample thickness, therefore particle identification is necessary to separate the contributions of different elements.&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt; Common examples of analysis are thin films of TiN&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;-Cu and BaBiKO. TiN&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;-Cu films were developed at the University of Munich and are used as tandem solar absorbers.&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt; Figure 8 shows the various components to the film. The copper coating and the glass substrate was also identified. Not only is ERDA is also coupled to Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, which is a similar process to ERDA. Using a solid angle of 7.5 mrs, recoils can be detected for this specific analysis of TiN&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;-Cu. It is important when designing an experiment to always consider the geometry of the system as to achieve recoil detection. In this geometry and with Cu being the heaviest component of the sample, according to eq. 2, scattered projectiles could not reach the detector.&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt; To prevent pileup of signals from these recoiled ions, a limit of 500&amp;nbsp;Hz needed to be set on the count rate of ΔΕ pulses.&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt; This corresponded to beam currents of lass than 20 particle pA.&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt;

Another example of thin film analysis is of BaBiKO. This type of film showed superconductivity at one of the highest-temperatures for oxide superconductors.&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt; Elemental analysis, shown in figure 9, of this film was carried out using heavy ion-ERDA.  These elemental constitutes of the polymer film (Bi, K, Mg, O, along with carbon contamination) were detected using an ionization chamber. Other than Potassium, the lighter elements are clearly separated in the matrix.&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt; From the matrix, there is evidence of a strong carbon contamination within the film. Some films showed a 1:1 ratio of K to carbon contamination.&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt; For this specific film analysis, the source for contamination was traced to an oil diffusion pump and replaced with an oil free pumping system.&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt;

===ERDA and position resolution===
In the above examples, the main focus was identification of constituent particles found in thin films and depth resolution was of less significance.&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt; Depth resolution is of great importance in applications when a profile of a samples' elemental composition, in different sample layers, has to be measured. This is a powerful tool for materials characterization. Being able to quantify elemental concentration in sub-surface layers can provide a great deal of information pertaining to chemical properties. High sensitivity, i.e. large detector solid angle, can be combined with high depth resolution only if the related kinematic energy shift is compensated.&lt;ref name=Assmann1994/&gt;

==Physical Processes of Elastic Recoil Detection Analysis==

The Basic chemistry of Forward recoil scattering process is considered to be charged particle interaction with matters.
To Understand Forward recoil spectrometry we should know the physics involved in Elastic and Inelastic collisions. In Elastic collision only Kinetic Energy is conserved in the scattering process and there is no role of particle internal energy. Where as in case of 
Inelastic collision both kinetic energy and internal energy are participated in the scattering process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Serruys|first=Jorge Tirira ; Yves|title=Forward recoil spectrometry : applications to hydrogen determination in solids|date=1996|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0-306-45249-9|author2=Trocellier, Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Physical concepts of two-body elastic scattering are the basis of several nuclear methods for elemental material characterization.

===Fundamentals of Recoil (Back Scattering) Spectrometry===

The Fundamental aspects in dealing with recoil spectroscopy involves electron back scattering process of matter such as thin films and solid materials. Energy loss of particles in target materials is evaluated by assuming that the target sample is laterally uniform and constituted by a mono isotopic element. This allows a simple relationship between that of penetration depth profile and elastic scattering yield&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chu|first=Wei-Kan|title=Back Scattering Spectrometry|publisher=ACADEMIC PRESS.INC|location=New York|isbn=0-12-173850-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Main assumptions in physical concepts of Back scattering spectrometry===

* Elastic collision between two bodies is the energy transfer from a projectile to a target molecule. This process depends on the concept of kinematics and mass perceptibility.
* Probability of occurrence of collision provides information about scattering cross section.
* Average loss of energy of an atom moving through a dense medium gives idea on stopping cross section and capability of depth perception.
* Statistical fluctuations caused by the energy loss of an atom while moving through a dense medium. This process leads to the concept of energy straggling and a limitation to the ultimate depth and mass resolution in back scattering spectroscopy.&lt;ref name="Tirira 2–3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tirira|first=Jorge|title=forward recoil spectrometry|isbn=0-306-45249-9|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical concepts that are highly important in interpretation of forward recoil spectrum are depth profile, energy straggling, and multiple scattering.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last=Serruys|first=Jorge Tirira ; Yves|title=Forward recoil spectrometry : applications to hydrogen determination in solids|date=1996|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0-306-45249-9|author2=Trocellier, Patrick }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These concepts are described in detail in the following sections :

===Depth profile and Resolution analysis===

A key parameter that characterizes recoil spectrometry is the depth resolution. This parameter is defined as the ability of an analytical technique to measure a variation in atomic distribution as a function of depth in a sample layer.

In terms of low energy forward recoil spectrometry, hydrogen and deuterium depth profiling can be expressed in a mathematical notation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szilágyi|first=E.|author2=Pászti, F. |author3=Amsel, G. |title=Theoretical approximations for depth resolution calculations in IBA methods|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section B: Beam Interactions with Materials and Atoms|volume=100|issue=1|pages=103–121|doi=10.1016/0168-583X(95)00186-7|bibcode = 1995NIMPB.100..103S|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Δx  = ΔE&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt;/(dE&lt;sub&gt;det&lt;/sub&gt;/dx)

where δE&lt;sub&gt;det&lt;/sub&gt; defines as the energy width of a channel in a multichannel analyzer, and dE&lt;sub&gt;det&lt;/sub&gt;/dx is the effective stopping power of the recoiled particles.

Let us consider an Incoming and outgoing ion beams that are calculated as a function of collisional depth, by considering two trajectories are in a plane perpendicular to target surface, and incoming and outgoing paths are the shortest possible ones for a given collision depth and given scattering and recoil angles .

Impinging ions reach the surface, making an angle θ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, with the inward-pointing normal to the surface. After collision their velocity makes an angle θ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, with the outward surface normal; and the atom initially at rest recoils, making an angle θ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, with this normal. Detection is possible at one of these angles as such that the particle crosses the target surface.
Paths of particles are related to collisional depth x, measured along a normal to the surface.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[File:ERDA1.jpg|left|thumb|350 px|Planar representation of Scattered projectile path of an ion beam&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;]]This Figure is plane representation of a scattered projectile on the target surface, when both incoming and outgoing paths are in perpendicular to target surface

For the impinging ion, length of the incoming path L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is given by :&lt;math&gt;L_{1}
= \frac{x}{\cos\theta_{1}}&lt;/math&gt;

The outgoing path length L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of the scattered projectile is :&lt;math&gt;L_{2} 
= \frac{x}{\cos\theta_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

And finally the outgoing path L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; of the recoil is :&lt;math&gt;L_{3}                                                                                                                                                                                                       
= \frac{x}{\cos\theta_{3}}&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:ERDA2.jpg|right|thumb|350 px|Planar representation of Recoiled path of an ion beam&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;]]This Figure is plane representation of a Recoiled ion path on the target surface, when both incoming and outgoing paths are in perpendicular to target surface

In this simple case a collisional plane is perpendicular to the target surface, the scattering angle of the impinging ion is θ = π-θ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-θ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp; the recoil angle is φ =  π-θ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-θ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

Target angle with the collisional plane is taken as α, and path is augmented by a factor of 1/cos α.

For the purpose of converting outgoing particle in to collision depth, geometrical factors are chosen.

For recoil R(φ, α)is defined as sin L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = R(φ, α)L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;math&gt;R(\phi,\alpha) = {\cos\theta_{1}\cos\alpha} \over{\sin\phi \sqrt{\cos^{2}\alpha-\cos^{2}\theta_{1}} - \cos\theta_{1}\cos\phi}&lt;/math&gt;

For forward scattering of the projectile R(φ,α)by:L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = R(θ,α)L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
R(θ,α) = cos θ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;cosα/Sin θ√(cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;α-cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;θ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)-cosθ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;cosθ

The Figure below is the Geometrical configuration of recoil spectrometry. Paths of scattered particles are considered to be L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; for incident beam, L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is for scattered particle, and L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is for recoiled atoms.

===Energy Depth Relationship===
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tirira|first=Jorge|title=Forward recoil spectrometry|isbn=0-306-45249-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The energy E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(x) of the incident particle at a depth (x) to its initial energy E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; where scattering occurs is given by the following Equations. (Tirira. J., 1996)

:&lt;math&gt; E_{0}(x) = E_{0}- \int_{0}^{(x/\cos\theta1)}S(E)\,dL_{1}---Equation(1)&lt;/math&gt;

similarly Energy expression for scattered particle is:&lt;math&gt; E_{1}(x) = KE_{0}(x)- \int_{0}^{(x/\cos\theta2)}S(E)\,dL_{2}---Equation(2)&lt;/math&gt;

and for recoil atom is:&lt;math&gt; E_{2}(x) = K'E_{0}(x)- \int_{0}^{(x/\cos\theta3)}Sr(E)\,dL_{3}---Equation(3)&lt;/math&gt;

The energy loss per unit path is usually defined as stopping power and it is represented by :&lt;math&gt;S 
= \frac{dE}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;

Specifically, stopping power S(E) is known as a function of the energy E of an ion.

Starting point for energy loss calculations is illustrated by the expression:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta E 
= \int_{0}^{\Delta x} \frac{dE}{dx}\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

By applying above equation and energy conservation Illustrates expressions in 3 cases &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tirira|first=Jones|title=Forward Recoil Spectrometry|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York|isbn=0-306-45249-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L_{1}                                  
= \int_{E_0(x)}^{E_0} \frac{dE}{S(E)}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L_{2}
= \int_{E_1(x)}^{E_01(x)} \frac{dE}{S(E)}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L_{3}
= \int_{E_2(x)}^{E_02(x)} \frac{dE}{Sr(E)}&lt;/math&gt;

where E&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt;(x)= KE&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(x)and E&lt;sub&gt;02&lt;/sub&gt;(x)=K'E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(x)

S(E)and S_r(E) are stopping powers for projectile and recoil in the Target material

Finally stopping cross section is defined by ɛ(E)= S(E)/N
 
ɛ is stopping cross section factor.

To obtain energy path scale We need to evaluate energy variation δE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of the outgoing beam of energy E2 from the target surface for an increment δx of collisional depth, here E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; remains fixed. Evidently this causes changes in path lengths L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; a variation of path around the collision point x is related to the corresponding variation in energy before scattering :

δL1 =  δE&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(x)/S[E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(x)-----  Equation 5

Moreover, particles with slight energy differences after scattering from a depth x undergo slight energy losses on their outgoing path.
Then change δ L3 of the path length L3 can be written as 
δL3 =  δ(K’E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(x)]/ Sr[K’E0(x)) + δ(E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)/S&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) -----Equation 6

δ L1 is the path variations due to energy variation just after the collision and  δ L3 is the path variation because of variation of energy loss along the outward path.
Solving equations 5 and 6 by considering δ x = 0 for the derivative dL1/dE2 with L3=R(φα)L1,yields

dL1/dE2 = 1/{S&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;(E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)/S&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;[K’E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(x)]}{[R(φ,α) S&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;[K’E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(x)+K’S[E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(x)]}  -----------Equation 7

In elastic spectrometry, the term[S] is called as energy loss factor
[S] =   K’S(E(x))/Cos θ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + S&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;(K’E(x))2Cos θ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; -----------------Equation 8

finally stopping cross section is defined by ε(E) ≡S(E)/N
where N is atomic density of the target material.

Stopping cross section factor [ε]  = ((K^'ε(E(x) ))/cos θ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; )+(ε&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;(K^' E(x) )/cosθ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)--------Equation 9

===Depth Resolution===

An important parameter that characterizes recoil spectrometer is depth resolution. It is defined as the ability of an analytical technique to detect a variation in atomic distribution as a function of depth. The capability to separate in energy in the recoil system arising from small depth intervals. The expression for depth resolution is given as

δR&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = δE&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;/[{S&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;(E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)/S&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;K'E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(x)}][R(φ,α)S&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;K'E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(x)+K'SE&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(x)]-----------Equation 10

Where δE&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; is the total energy resolution of the system, and the huge expression in the denominator is the sum of the path integrals of initial, scattered and recoil ion beams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=E.,|first=Szilagyi |author2=Paszti, F. |author3=Amsel, G.|title=Theoretical approach of depth resolution in IBA geometry|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=100|issue=1|doi=10.1016/0168-583X(95)00186-7|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168583X95001867|bibcode = 1995NIMPB.100..103S|date=1995|pages=103–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Practical importance Of Depth Resolution===

The concept of depth resolution represents the ability of Recoil spectrometry to separate the energies of scattered particles that occurred at slightly different depths
δRx is interpreted as an absolute limit for determining concentration profile. From this point of view concentration profile separated by a depth interval of the order of magnitude of δRx would be undistinguishable in the spectrum, and obviously it is impossible to gain accuracy better than δRx to assign depth profile. In particular the fact that the signals corresponding to features of the concentration profile separated by less than δRx strongly overlap in the spectrum.

A finite final depth resolution resulting from both theoretical and experimental limitations has deviation from exact result when consider an ideal situation. Final resolution is not coincide with theoretical evaluation such as the classical depth resolution δRx precisely because it results from three terms that escape from theoretical estimations:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; 
 
*Incertitude due to approximations of energy spread among molecules.
*Inconsistency in data on stopping powers and cross section values
*Statistical fluctuations of recoil yield (counting noise)

===Influence of Energy Broadening on a Recoil spectrum===

Straggling: Energy loss of particle in a dense medium is statistical in nature due to a large number of individual collisions between the particle and sample. Thus the evolution of an initially mono energetic and mono directional beam leads to dispersion of energy and direction. The resulting statistical energy distribution or deviation from initial energy is called energy straggling. Energy straggling data are plotted as a function of depth in the material.&lt;ref name="Tschalär 2863–2869"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tschalär|first=C.|author2=Maccabee, H. |title=Energy-Straggling Measurements of Heavy Charged Particles in Thick Absorbers|journal=Physical Review B|volume=1|issue=7|pages=2863–2869|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.1.2863|bibcode = 1970PhRvB...1.2863T|date=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theories of energy straggling : Energy straggling distribution is divided into three domains depending on the ratio of ΔE i.e., ΔE /E where ΔE is the mean energy loss and E is the average energy of the particle along the trajectory.&lt;ref name="Tschalär 2863–2869" /&gt;

[[File:Energy Straggling Effect.jpg|thumb|350 px|Propagation of the Energy Straggling distribution through matter in an Al foil for protons of 19.6MeV with different distribution functions f&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;:Bohr,f&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;:Symon,f&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;:Tschalar]]

1. Low fraction of energy loss: for very thin films with small path lengths, where ΔE/E ≤ 0.01, Landau and Vavilov &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sigmund|first=Peter|title=Particle penetration and radiation effects general aspects and stopping of swift point charges|date=2006|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=3-540-31713-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  derived that infrequent single collisions with large energy transfers contributes certain amount of loss in energy.

2. Medium fraction of energy loss: for regions where 0.01&lt; ΔE/E ≤ 0.2. Bohr’s model based on electronic interactions is useful for estimating energy straggling for this case, and this model includes the amount of energy straggling in terms of the areal density of electrons traversed by the beam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bohr|first=N.|title=II.|journal=Philosophical Magazine |series=Series 6|volume=25|issue=145|pages=10–31|doi=10.1080/14786440108634305|date=1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The standard deviation Ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B of the energy distribution is given by : Ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;B=4π((Z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;NZ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;∆x
Where NZ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Δx is the number of electrons per unit area over the path length increment Δx.

3. Large fraction of energy loss: for fractional energy loss in the region of 0.2&lt; ΔE/E ≤ 0.8, the energy dependence of stopping power causes the energy loss distribution to differ from Bohr’s straggling function. Hence the Bohr theory can not be applicable for this case.&lt;ref name="Tschalär 2863–2869"/&gt;   Various theoretical advances were made in understanding energy straggling in this case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmaus|first=D.|author2=L'hoir, A.|title=Experimental study of the multiple scattering lateral spread of MeV protons transmitted through polyester films|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section B: Beam Interactions with Materials and Atoms|volume=2|issue=1-3|pages=156–158|doi=10.1016/0168-583X(84)90178-2|bibcode = 1984NIMPB...2..156S|date=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An expression of energy for straggling is proposed by Symon in the region of 0.2&lt; ΔE/E ≤ 0.5 is a function of momentums Mi( Mi = M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; where M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is stopping power, M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is variation in straggling with depth of a stopping power)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Payne|first=M.|title=Energy Straggling of Heavy Charged Particles in Thick Absorbers|journal=Physical Review|volume=185|issue=2|pages=611–623|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.185.611|bibcode = 1969PhRv..185..611P|date=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tschalar et al.&lt;ref name="Tschalär 2863–2869"/&gt;   derived a straggling function solving the differential equation:
d Ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/dx = S(E) .d Ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/dE

The Tschalar’s expression which is valid for nearly symmetrical energy loss spectra,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tschalär|first=C.|title=Straggling distributions of large energy losses|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods|volume=61|issue=2|pages=141–156|doi=10.1016/0029-554X(68)90535-1|bibcode = 1968NucIM..61..141T|date=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; is

Where σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(E) represents energy straggling per unit length (or) variance of energy loss distribution per unit length for particles of energy E. E(x)is the mean energy at depth x.

===Mass resolution===

In a similar way mass resolution is a parameter that characterizes the capability of recoil spectrometry to separate two signals arising from two neighboring elements in the target. The difference in the energy δE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of recoil atoms after collision when two types of atoms differ in their masses by a quantity  δM&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   is&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

δE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/ δM&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (dK’/dM&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)

δE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/ δM&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 4E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;φ/(M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

Mass resolution  δMR  (≡ δE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/ δM&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

A main limitation of using low beam energies is the reduced mass resolution. The energy separation of different masses is, in fact, directly proportional to the incident energy. The mass resolution is limited by the relative E and velocity v.

Expression for mass resolution is   ΔM = √(∂M/∂E.∆E)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + √(∂M/∂v.∆v)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

ΔM = M(√((∆E)/E)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+√(2.∆v/v)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)

E is the Energy, M is the mass and v is the velocity of the particle beam.and ΔM is reduced mass difference.

===Multiple scattering scheme in Forward Recoil Spectrometry===
&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

When an Ion beam penetrating in to matter, ions undergo successive scattering events and deviates from original direction. The beam of ions in initial stage are well collimated(single direction), but after passing through a thickness of Δx in a random medium their direction of light propagation certainly differs from normal direction . As a result, both angular and lateral deviations from the initial direction can occur.&lt;ref name="Scott 1963"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scott|first=William|title=The Theory of Small-Angle Multiple Scattering of Fast Charged Particles|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=35|issue=2|pages=231–313|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.35.231|bibcode = 1963RvMP...35..231S|date=1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two parameters are discussed below. Hence, path length will be increased than expected causing fluctuations in ion beam. This process is called multiple scattering, and it is statistical in nature due to the large number of collisions.

'''Lateral displacement Case 1'''

Ion beam fluctuations because of lateral deviations on Target surface is explained by considering Multiple scattering of an ion beam which is directed in x – direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sigmund|first=P.|author2=Heinemeier, J. |author3=Besenbacher, F. |author4=Hvelplund, P. |author5= Knudsen, H. |title=Small-angle multiple scattering of ions in the screened-coulomb region.

[[File:ERDA6.png|right|thumb|350 px|Multiple scattering scheme where the ion beam is directed in x direction. Lateral displacement perpendicular to the beam direction is ρ(y,z),and α is the total angular deviation after the penetrated depth x]]

'''Angular deviation Case 2'''

===Theory and Experimental work involved in Multiple Scattering phenomena===
&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In the study of Multiple Scattering phenomenon angular distribution of a beam is important quantity for Consideration. The lateral distribution is closely related to the angular one but secondary to it, since lateral displacement is a consequence of angular divergence. Lateral distribution represents the beam profile in the matter.  both lateral and angular Multiple scattering distributions are interdependent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=E.|title=Multiple Scattering of Fast Electrons and Alpha-Particles, and "Curvature" of Cloud Tracks Due to Scattering|journal=Physical Review|volume=58|issue=4|pages=292–306|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.58.292|bibcode = 1940PhRv...58..292W|date=1940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The analysis of Multiple Scattering was started by Bothe(Bothe, W,1921) and Wentzel (Wentzel, G,1922)in the Nineteen twenties using well-known approximation of small angles. The physics of energy straggling and Multiple Scattering was developed quite far by Williams from 1929 to 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=E.|title=Application of Ordinary Space-Time Concepts in Collision Problems and Relation of Classical Theory to Born's Approximation|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=17|issue=2-3|pages=217–226|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.17.217|bibcode = 1945RvMP...17..217W|date=1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams devised a theory, which consists of fitting the Multiple Scattering distribution as a Gaussian-like portion due to small scattering angles and the single collision tail due to the large angles. William, E.J., studied beta particle straggling, Multiple scattering of fast electrons and alpha particles, and cloud curvature tracks due to scattering to explain Multiple scattering in different scenario and he proposed a mean projection deflection occurrence due to scattering. His theory later extended to multiple scattering of alpha particles.
Goudsmit and Saunderson provided a more complete treatment of Multiple Scattering, including large angles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goudsmit|first=S.|author2=Saunderson, J.|title=Multiple Scattering of Electrons. II|journal=Physical Review|volume=58|issue=1|pages=36–42|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.58.36|bibcode = 1940PhRv...58...36G|date=1940}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For large angles Goudsmit considered series of Legendre polynomials which are numerically evaluated for distribution of scattering. The angular distribution from Coulomb scattering has been studied in detail by Molière.,(Molière:1948) and further continued by Marion and coworkers. Marion, J.B., and Young, F.C., in their Nuclear Reaction Analysis provided Tabular information regarding energy loss of charged particles in matter, Multiple scattering of charged particles, Range straggling of protons, deuterons and alpha particles, equilibrium charge states of ions in solids and energies of elastically scattered particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=J.B.|last1=Marion|last2=Young|first2=F.C.|title=Nuclear Reaction Analysis|publisher=North-Holland publishing company|location=Amsterdam}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scott presents a complete review of basic theory, Mathematical methods, as well as results and applications.&lt;ref name="Scott 1963"/&gt;
A comparative development of Multiple Scattering at small angles is presented by Meyer, based on a classical calculation of single cross section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meyer,|first=L.,|title=Plural and multiple scattering of low-energy heavy particles in solids|journal=Physica Status Solidi B|volume=44|issue=1|pages=253–268|doi=10.1002/pssb.2220440127|bibcode = 1971PSSBR..44..253M|date=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sigmund and Winterbon reevaluated Meyer’s calculation to extend it to a more general case. Marwick and Sigmund carried out development on lateral spreading by Multiple Scattering, which resulted in a simple scaling relation with the angular distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=A.D.,|first=Marwick|author2=Sigmund.P.,|title=Small-angle multiple scattering of ions in the screened coulomb region|journal=Journal of the ICRU|volume=12|issue=1|doi=10.1093/jicru/ndi014|date=2005|pages=239–253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
HI-ERDA and LI-ERDA have similar applications. As mentioned previously, the only difference between the two techniques is energy of the source used for the bombardment of the sample.

ERDA, in general, has many applications in the areas of polymer science, material science – semiconductor materials, electronics, and thin film characterization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Serruys|first=Jorge Tirira ; Yves|title=Forward recoil spectrometry : applications to hydrogen determination in solids|date=1996|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0306452499|author2=Trocellier, Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt; ERDA is widely used in polymer science.&lt;ref name="Composto 107–180"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Composto|first=Russell J.|author2=Walters, Russel M. |author3=Genzer, Jan |title=Application of ion scattering techniques to characterize polymer surfaces and interfaces|journal=Materials Science and Engineering: R: Reports|volume=38|issue=3-4|pages=107–180|doi=10.1016/S0927-796X(02)00009-8|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is because polymers are hydrogen-rich materials which can be easily studied by LI-ERDA. One can examine surface properties of polymers, polymer blends and evolution of polymer composition induced by irradiation. HI-ERDA can also be used in the field of new materials processed for microelectronics and opto-electronic applications. Moreover, elemental analysis and depth profiling in thin film can also be performed using ERDA.

An example of how ERDA can be used by scientists is shown below. In one of the experiments performed by Compsoto, et al., ERDA spectrum was obtained for a thin film of polystyrene (PS) on a deuterated polystyrene (dPS) matrix after annealing for 240 seconds at 171&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C. This spectrum is shown in figure 16 on the left.

It must be noted that the plot above is simply the normalized yield at each channel number from a thin dPS layer (about 200 Angstroms) on top of a thick PS. Normalized yield is usually the number of atoms detected. Channeling, however occurs when a beam of ions is carefully aligned with a major symmetry direction of a single crystal, such as a crystal axis or a plane. In this condition, most of the beam is steered through the channels formed by the string of atoms. Channeled particles cannot get close enough to the atomic nuclei to undergo scattering.  Several mathematical operations were then performed, electronically, to obtain a concentration versus depth-profile as shown below in figure 17. Please refer to the source for detailed explanation of the mathematical equations.

In addition to all these applications, ERDA is one of the methods to follow elemental transport mechanism. More importantly, hydrogen transport near interfaces induced by corrosion and wear can be probed using ERDA.&lt;ref name="Serruys 1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Serruys|first=Jorge Tirira ; Yves|title=Forward recoil spectrometry : applications to hydrogen determination in solids|date=1996|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=9780306452499|author2=Trocellier, Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt; ERDA can also be used to perform composition diagnosis in various media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Forward Recoil Spectrometry|isbn=9780306452499}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Characterizing how polymer molecules behave at free polymer surfaces at interfaces between incompatible polymers and at interfaces with inorganic solid substances is crucial to our fundamental understanding and for improving the performance of polymers in high-tech applications. For example, the adhesion of two polymers strongly depends on the interactions occurring at the interface, between polymer segments. LI-ERDA is one of the most attractive methods for investigating these aspects of polymer science quantitatively.

A typical LI- ERDA spectrum obtained using this technique to study elemental concentration and depth profile of polymers is shown in the figure 18 below. It is ERDA spectra of a thin (20&amp;nbsp;nm) dPS tracer film on a thick (500&amp;nbsp;nm) PS matrix.

Hydrogen and deuterium profiles can be measured using various polymer blends by using this technique. Green and Russel &lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{cite journal|last=Green|first=Peter F.|author2=Russell, Thomas P.|title=Segregation of low molecular weight symmetric diblock copolymers at the interface of high molecular weight homopolymers|journal=Macromolecules|volume=24|issue=10|pages=2931–2935|doi=10.1021/ma00010a045|bibcode = 1991MaMol..24.2931G|date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; have studied the segregation of deuterated polystyrene/polymethamethacrylate copolymer at the interface of polystyrene, and polymethylmethacrylate homopolymer at the interface of polystyrene and polymethylmetacrylate homopolymer using ERDA with 2.8 MeV 4He+ ions. They also studied the interface properties of copolymers/Al or Si structures.&lt;ref name=Green/&gt; Figure 19 shows the results obtained which is a typical ERD spectrum of yield vs. energy of P(d-S-b-d-MMA) block copolymer chains that segregated at the interface of the PS and PMMA homopolymers.

This profile can then be converted to volume fraction versus depth after doing several mathematical operations to obtain figure 20. In the figure 20 shown, the shaded region is the interface excess. The PS phase is located at x&lt;0 whereas the PMMA phase is located at x&gt;0.&lt;ref name=Green/&gt; Please refer to the source to obtain complete analysis of the figure.

Thus the authors were able to see that copolymer chains segregate to the interfacial region between the PS and PMMA homolymer phases and elevated temperatures while others remain in bulk.&lt;ref name=Green/&gt; Similar studies can be easily done using the technique of ERDA

The profile that lies in the energy range between 600 and 1000 keV is the hydrogen from the homopolymers and the other profile, which lies between 1000 and 1400 keV, is that of the deuterium from the copolymer chains.&lt;ref name=Green/&gt;

Ion implantation is one of the methods used to transform physical properties of polymers and to improve their electrical, optical, and mechanical performance.&lt;ref name="Serruys 1996"/&gt; Ion implantation is a technique by which the ions of a material are accelerated in an electrical field and impacted into a materials such that ion are inserted into this material. This technique has many important uses. One such example is the introduction of silver plasma into the biomedical titanium. This is important because Titanium-based implantable devices such as joint prostheses, fracture fixation devices and dental implants, are important to human lives and improvement of the life quality of patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Visai|first1=Livia|last2=De Nardo|first2=Luigi|last3=Punta|first3=Carlo|last4=Melone|first4=Lucio|last5=Cigada|first5=Alberto|last6=Imbriani|first6=Marcello|last7=Arciola|first7=Carla Renata|title=Titanium oxide antibacterial surfaces in biomedical devices|journal=The International Journal of Artificial Organs|volume=34|issue=9|pages=929–946|doi=10.5301/ijao.5000050|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, biomedical titanium is lack of Osseo integration and antibacterium ability. Plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII) is a physical technique which can enhance the multi-functionality, mechanical and chemical properties as well as biological activities of artificial implants and biomedical devices. ERDA can be used to study this phenomenon very effectively. Moreover, many scientists have measured the evolution of electrical conductivity, optical transparency, corrosion resistance, and wear resistance of different polymers after irradiation by electron or low-energy light ions or high-energy heavy ions.&lt;ref name="Serruys 1996"/&gt;

Electronic devices are usually composed of sequential thin layers made up of oxides, nitrides, silicades, metals, polymers, or doped semiconductor–based media coated on a single crystalline substrate (Si, Ge or AsGa).&lt;ref name="Serruys 1996"/&gt; These structures can be studied by HI-ERDA. This technique has one major advantage over other methods.  The profile of impurities can be found in a one-shot measurement at a constant incident energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gusinskii|first=G M|author2=Kudryavtsev, I V |author3=Kudoyarova, V K |author4=Naidenov, V O |author5= Rassadin, L A |title=A method for investigation of light-element distribution in the surface layers of semiconductors and dielectrics|journal=Semiconductor Science and Technology|date=1 July 1992|volume=7|issue=7|pages=881–887|doi=10.1088/0268-1242/7/7/002|bibcode = 1992SeScT...7..881G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this technique offers an opportunity to study the density profiles of hydrogen, carbon and oxygen in various materials, as well as the absolute hydrogen, carbon and oxygen content.

Combination of techniques is required in order to study the composition of thin films. Ion beam techniques – RBS and elastic recoil detection analysis combination has proved to be an attractive way to study the elemental composition of the samples as well as the depth profiles of the thin films. ERDA technique is capable of separating masses and energies of scattered incident ions and the recoiled target atoms. It is especially useful to profile light elements such as H, B, C, N, and O in the presence of heavier material background. Thus it has proved to be a useful technique in studying the composition of the thin films. The dependence of the hydrogen density profile on the features of processing and maintenance, and the effect of injected hydrogen on the dielectric properties of ditantalum pentoxide can also be studied.

[[File:Fulham Workhorse 4 ballast.jpg|thumb|350px|A modern ballast for powering four F32T8 office lamps.]]

An '''electrical ballast''' is a device placed in line with the load to limit the amount of [[Electric current|current]] in an  [[Electrical network|electrical circuit]]. It may be a fixed or variable resistor.

A familiar and widely used example is the inductive ballast used in [[fluorescent lamp]]s to limit the current through the tube, which would otherwise rise to a destructive level due to the [[negative resistance|negative differential resistance]] of the tube's voltage-current characteristic.

Ballasts vary greatly in complexity. They may be as simple as a [[resistor]], [[inductor]] or [[capacitor]] (or a combination of these) wired in series with the lamp; or as complex as the electronic ballasts used in [[compact fluorescent lamp]]s and [[high-intensity discharge lamp]]s.

== Current limiting ==
[[Image:Tanning-chokeballast.jpg|thumbnail|upright|250px|A ''choke ballast'' (inductor) used in older lighting. This example is from a tanning bed. It requires a lamp starter (below) and a capacitor.]] 
[[Image:Tanning-starter.jpg|thumbnail|250px|A [[Fluorescent lamp#Starting|lamp starter]], required with some inductor type ballasts.  It connects the two ends of the lamp to preheat them for one second before lighting.]]

An electrical ballast is a device which limits the current through an [[electrical load]]. These are most often used when a load (such as an arc discharge) has its terminal voltage decline when current through the load increases.  If such a device were connected to a constant-voltage power supply, it would draw an increasing amount of current until it will be destroyed or caused the power supply to fail. To prevent this, a ballast provides a positive [[electrical resistance|resistance]] or [[reactance (electronics)|reactance]] that limits the current. The ballast provides for the proper operation of the negative-resistance device by limiting current.

Ballasts can also be used simply to limit the current in an ordinary, positive-resistance circuit. Prior to the advent of solid-state ignition, automobile [[ignition system]]s commonly included a ballast resistor to regulate the voltage applied to the ignition system.

Series resistors are used as ballasts to control the current through LEDs.

== Resistors ==

=== Fixed resistors ===
For simple, low-powered loads such as a neon lamp or a LED, a fixed resistor is commonly used. Because the resistance of the ballast resistor is large it determines the current in the circuit, even in the face of [[negative resistance]] introduced by the neon lamp.

Ballast was also a component used in early model [[automobiles]] [[Internal combustion engine|engine]]  that lowered the supply [[voltage]] to the [[ignition system]] after the engine had been started. Starting the engine requires a significant amount of electrical current from the [[battery (electricity)|battery]], resulting in an equally significant voltage drop. To allow the engine to start, the ignition system was designed to operate on this lower voltage. But once the vehicle was started and the starter disengaged, the normal operating voltage was too high for the ignition system. To avoid this problem, a ballast resistor was inserted in series with the ignition system, resulting in two different operating voltages for the starting and ignition systems.

Occasionally, this ballast resistor would fail and the classic symptom of this failure was that the engine ran while being cranked (while the resistor was bypassed) but stalled immediately when cranking ceased (and the resistor was reconnected in the circuit via the ignition switch). Modern electronic ignition systems (those used since the 1980s or late '70s) do not require a ballast resistor as they are flexible enough to operate on the lower cranking voltage or the normal operating voltage.

Another common use of a ballast resistor in the automotive industry is adjusting the ventilation fan speed. The ballast is a fixed resistor with usually two center taps, and the fan speed selector switch is used to bypass portions of the ballast: all of them for full speed, and none for the low speed setting. A very common failure occurs when the fan is being constantly run at the next-to-full speed setting (usually 3 out of 4). This will cause a very short piece of resistor coil to be operated with a relatively high current (up to 10&amp;nbsp;A), eventually burning it out. This will render the fan unable to run at the reduced speed settings.

In some consumer electronic equipment, notably in television sets in the era of valves (vacuum tubes), but also in some low-cost record players, the [[vacuum tube]] heaters were connected in series. Since the voltage drop across all the heaters in series was usually less than the full mains voltage, it was necessary to provide a ballast to drop the excess voltage. A resistor was often used for this purpose, as it was cheap and worked with both AC and DC.

=== Self-variable resistors ===
Some ballast resistors have the property of increasing in [[electrical resistance|resistance]] as current through them increases, and decreasing in resistance as current decreases. Physically, some such devices are often built quite like [[incandescent lamp]]s. Like the [[tungsten]] filament of an ordinary incandescent lamp, if [[electric current|current]] increases, the ballast resistor gets hotter, its resistance goes up, and its voltage drop increases. If [[electric current|current]] decreases, the ballast resistor gets colder, its resistance drops, and the [[voltage drop]] decreases. Therefore, the ballast resistor reduces variations in current, despite variations in applied voltage or changes in the rest of an electric circuit. These devices are sometimes called "[[Iron-hydrogen resistor|barretters]]" and were used in the series heating circuits of 1930s to 1960s [[AC/DC receiver design#Series tube heaters|AC/DC]] [[All American Five|radio]] and TV home receivers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

This property can lead to more precise current control than merely choosing an appropriate fixed resistor. The power lost in the resistive ballast is also reduced because a smaller portion of the overall power is dropped in the ballast compared to what might be required with a fixed resistor.

Earlier, household [[clothes dryer]]s sometimes incorporated a [[germicidal lamp]] in series with an ordinary incandescent lamp; the incandescent lamp operated as the ballast for the germicidal lamp. A commonly used light in the home in the 1960s in 220–240&amp;nbsp;V countries was a circular tube ballasted by an under-run regular mains filament lamp. Self ballasted [[mercury-vapor lamp]]s incorporate ordinary tungsten filaments within the overall envelope of the lamp to act as the ballast, and it supplements the otherwise lacking red area of the light spectrum produced.

[[image:Magnetic Ballasts 1.jpg|thumb|Several typical American magnetic ballasts for [[fluorescent lamp]]s. The top is a high-power factor rapid start series ballast for two 30–40&amp;nbsp;W lamps. The middle is a low power factor preheat ballast for a single 30–40&amp;nbsp;W lamp while the bottom ballast is a simple inductor used with a 15&amp;nbsp;W preheat lamp.]]

Because of the power that would be lost, resistors are not used as ballasts for lamps of more than about two watts. Instead, a [[reactance (electronics)|reactance]] is used. Losses in the ballast due to its resistance and losses in its magnetic core may be significant, on the order of 5 to 25% of the lamp input electric power. Practical lighting design calculations must allow for ballast loss in estimating the running cost of a lighting installation.

An [[inductor]] is very common in line-frequency ballasts to provide the proper starting and operating electrical condition to power a [[fluorescent lamp]], [[neon lamp]], or [[high-intensity discharge lamp|high intensity discharge (HID) lamp]]. (Because of the use of the inductor, such ballasts are usually called ''magnetic ballasts''.) The inductor has two benefits:
# Its reactance limits the power available to the lamp with only minimal power losses in the inductor
# The [[voltage spike]] produced when current through the inductor is rapidly interrupted is used in some circuits to first strike the arc in the lamp.

A disadvantage of the inductor is that current is shifted out of phase with the voltage, producing a poor [[power factor]]. In more expensive ballasts, a [[capacitor]] is often paired with the inductor to correct the power factor. In ballasts that control two or more lamps, line-frequency ballasts commonly use different phase relationships between the multiple lamps. This not only mitigates the flicker of the individual lamps, it also helps maintain a high power factor. These ballasts are often called ''lead-lag'' ballasts because the current in one lamp leads the mains phase and the current in the other lamp lags the mains phase.

In Europe, and most 220-240&amp;nbsp;V territories, the line voltage is sufficient to start lamps over 20W with a series inductor. In North America and Japan however, the line voltage (120&amp;nbsp;V or 100&amp;nbsp;V respectively) may not be sufficient to start lamps over 20&amp;nbsp;W with a series inductor, so an [[autotransformer]] winding is included in the ballast to step up the voltage. The autotransformer is designed with enough [[leakage inductance]] ([[short-circuit inductance]]) so that the current is appropriately limited.

Because of the large inductors and capacitors that must be used, reactive ballasts operated at line frequency tend to be large and heavy. They commonly also produce acoustic [[noise]] (line-frequency [[mains hum|hum]]).

Prior to 1980 in the United States, [[polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]-based oils were used as an insulating oil in many ballasts to provide cooling and electrical isolation (see [[transformer oil]]).

==Electronic and magnetic ballasts{{anchor|Electronic_ballasts}}==
An electronic ballast uses [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] [[electronic circuit]]ry to provide the proper starting and operating electrical conditions to power discharge lamps. An electronic ballast can be smaller and lighter than a comparably-rated magnetic one. An electronic ballast is usually quieter than a magnetic one, which produces a line-frequency hum by vibration of the transformer laminations.&lt;ref&gt;

Electronic ballasts are often based on [[switched-mode power supply|SMPS]] topology, first rectifying the input power and then chopping it at a high frequency. Advanced electronic ballasts may allow dimming via [[pulse-width modulation]] or via changing the frequency to a higher value. Ballasts incorporating a [[microcontroller]] (digital ballasts) may offer remote control and monitoring via networks such as [[LonWorks]], [[Digital Addressable Lighting Interface|DALI]], [[DMX512]], [[Digital Signal Interface|DSI]] or simple analog control using a [[0-10 V lighting control|0-10&amp;nbsp;V]] [[Direct current|DC]] brightness control signal. Systems with remote control of light level  via a [[wireless mesh network]] have been introduced.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Image:Elektronstarterp.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Electronic ballast of a [[compact fluorescent lamp]] ]]

Electronic ballasts usually supply power to the lamp at a frequency of {{nowrap|20,000 Hz}} or higher, rather than the [[Utility frequency|mains frequency]] of {{nowrap|50 – 60 Hz}}; this substantially eliminates the [[stroboscopic effect]] of flicker, a product of the line frequency associated with fluorescent lighting (see [[photosensitive epilepsy]]). The high output frequency of an electronic ballast refreshes the phosphors in a fluorescent lamp so rapidly that there is no perceptible flicker. The flicker index, used for measuring perceptible light modulation, has a range from 0.00 to 1.00, with 0 indicating the lowest possibility of flickering and 1 indicating the highest. Lamps operated on magnetic ballasts have a flicker index between 0.04–0.07 while digital ballasts have a flicker index of below 0.01.&lt;ref name="nlpip"&gt;[http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/NLPIP/PDF/VIEW/SREB2.pdf Specifier Reports: Electronic Ballasts p.18], National Lighting Product Information Program, Volume 8 Number 1, May 2000. Retrieved 13 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because more gas remains ionized in the arc stream, the lamp operates at about 9% higher [[luminous efficacy|efficacy]] above approximately 10&amp;nbsp;kHz. Lamp efficiency increases sharply at about 10&amp;nbsp;kHz and continues to improve until approximately 20&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref&gt;IES Lighting Handbook 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Electronic ballast retrofits to existing street lights had been tested in some Canadian provinces circa 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.calgary.ca/Transportation/Roads/Pages/Traffic/Traffic-signals-and-streetlights/Streetlighting-Digital-Ballast-pilot-project.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729141605/http://www.calgary.ca/Transportation/Roads/Pages/Traffic/Traffic-signals-and-streetlights/Streetlighting-Digital-Ballast-pilot-project.aspx |archivedate=2013-07-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;; since then LED retrofits have become more common.

With the higher efficiency of the ballast itself and the higher lamp efficacy at higher frequency, electronic ballasts offer higher system efficacy for low pressure lamps like the [[fluorescent lamp]]. For [[HID lamp]]s, there is no improvement of the lamp efficacy in using higher frequency, but for these lamps the ballast losses are lower at higher frequencies and also the light depreciation is lower, meaning the lamp produces more light over its entire lifespan.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} Some HID lamp types like the [[ceramic discharge metal halide lamp]] have reduced reliability when operated at high frequencies in the range of {{nowrap|20 – 200 kHz}}; for these lamps a square wave low frequency current drive is mostly used with frequency in the range of {{nowrap|100 – 400 Hz}}, with the same advantage of lower light depreciation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Application of electronic ballasts to HID lighting is growing in popularity. Most newer generation electronic ballasts can operate both [[Sodium-vapor lamp#High-pressure sodium|high pressure sodium (HPS) lamps]] as well as [[metal-halide lamp]]s, reducing costs for building managers who use both types of lamps. The ballast initially works as a starter for the arc, supplying a high-voltage impulse and, later, it works as a limiter/regulator of the electric flow inside the circuit. Electronic ballasts also run much cooler and are lighter than their magnetic counterparts.&lt;ref name="nlpip" /&gt;

==Fluorescent lamp ballasts==
{{Main article|Fluorescent lamp}}

===Preheating===
This technique uses a combination [[Electrical filament|filament]]–[[cathode]] at each end of the lamp in conjunction with a mechanical or automatic (bi-metallic or electronic) switch that initially connect the filaments in series with the ballast to preheat them. When filaments are disconnected, an inductive pulse from the ballast starts the lamp. This system is described as "Preheat" in North America and "Switch Start" in the UK, and have no specific name in the rest part of the world. This systems is common in 200–240 V countries (and for 100–120 V lamps up to about 30 watts).

Although an inductive pulse makes it more likely that the lamp will start when the starter switch opens, it is not actually necessary. The ballast in such systems can equally be a resistor. A number of fluorescent lamp fittings used a filament lamp as the ballast in the late 1950s through to the 1960s.  Special lamps were manufactured that were rated at 170&amp;nbsp;volts and 120&amp;nbsp;watts.  The lamp had a thermal starter built into the 4 pin base. The power requirements were much larger than using an inductive ballast (though the consumed current was the same), but the warmer light from the lamp type of ballast was often preferred by users particularly in a domestic environment.

Resistive ballasts were the only type that was usable when the only supply available to power the fluorescent lamp was DC. Such fittings used the thermal type of starter (mostly because they had gone out use long before the [[Glow switch starter|glow starter]] was invented), but it was possible to include a choke in the circuit whose sole purpose was to provide a pulse on opening of the starter switch to improve starting. DC fittings were complicated by the need to reverse the polarity of the supply to the tube each time it started. Failure to do so vastly shortened the life of the tube.

===Instant start===
An instant start ballast does not preheat the electrodes, instead using a relatively high voltage (~600&amp;nbsp;V) to initiate the discharge arc. It is the most energy efficient type, but yields the fewest lamp-start cycles, as material is blasted from the surface of the cold electrodes each time the lamp is turned on. Instant-start ballasts are best suited to applications with long duty cycles, where the lamps are not frequently turned on and off. Although these were mostly used in countries with 100-120&amp;nbsp;volt mains supplies (for lamps of 40&amp;nbsp;W or above), they were briefly popular in other countries because the lamp started without the flicker of switch start systems. The popularity was short lived because of the short lamp life.

===Rapid start===
A rapid start ballast applies voltage and heats the cathodes simultaneously. It provides superior lamp life and more cycle life, but uses slightly more energy as the electrodes in each end of the lamp continue to consume heating power as the lamp operates. Again, although popular in 100-120&amp;nbsp;volt countries for lamps of 40&amp;nbsp;W and above, rapid start is sometimes used in other countries particularly where the flicker of switch start systems is undesirable. This ballast is incompatible with the European energy saver T8 fluorescent lamps, that retrofits the older T12 lamps, since these lamps have much higher starting voltage than the [[open-circuit voltage]] of rapid start ballasts.

===Dimmable ballast===
A dimmable ballast is very similar to a rapid start ballast, but usually has a capacitor incorporated to give a [[power factor]] nearer to unity than a standard rapid start ballast.  A [[quadrac]] type light dimmer can be used with a dimming ballast, which maintains the heating current while allowing lamp current to be controlled.  A resistor of about 10&amp;nbsp;kΩ is required to be connected in parallel with the fluorescent tube to allow reliable firing of the quadrac at low light levels.

===Programmed start===
Used in high end electronic fluorescent ballasts. This ballast applies power to the filaments first, it allows the cathodes to preheat and then applies voltage to the lamps to strike an arc. Lamp life typically operates up to 100,000 on/off cycles when using programmed start ballasts.  Once started, filament voltage is reduced to increase operating efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ballast gives the best life and most starts from lamps, and so is preferred for applications with very frequent power cycling such as vision examination rooms and restrooms with a motion detector switch.

===Hybrid===
A hybrid ballast has a magnetic core-and-coil [[transformer]] and an electronic switch for the [[electrode]]-heating circuit. Like a magnetic ballast, a hybrid unit operates at line power frequency—50&amp;nbsp;Hz in Europe, for example. These types of ballasts, which are also referred to as ''[[cathode]]-disconnect ballasts'', disconnect the [[electrode]]-heating [[Electrical circuit|circuit]] after they start the lamps.

==ANSI Ballast factor==
For a lighting ballast, the ANSI  ''ballast factor'' is used in North America to compare the light output (in [[Lumen (unit)|lumens]]) of a lamp operated on a ballast compared to the lamp operating on an ANSI reference ballast. Reference ballast operates the lamp at its ANSI specified nominal power rating.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE Std. 100 "Dictionary of IEEE Standards Terms, Standard 100" , {{ISBN|0-7381-2601-2}}, page 83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ANSI standard C82.13-2002 ''Definitions for Flurorescent Lamp Ballasts", page 1&lt;/ref&gt;  The ballast factor of practical ballasts must be considered in [[Architectural lighting design|lighting design]]; a low ballast factor may save energy, but will produce less light.  With fluorescent lamps, ballast factor can vary from the reference value of 1.0.&lt;ref name="LBL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ateam.lbl.gov/Design-Guide/DGHtm/ballastfactor.htm |title=Ballast factor |accessdate=April 12, 2013 |publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319012221/http://ateam.lbl.gov/Design-Guide/DGHtm/ballastfactor.htm |archivedate=March 19, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ballast triode==
Early tube-based [[TV set|color TV sets]] used a ballast [[triode]], such as the PD500, as a parallel shunt stabilizer for the [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] acceleration voltage, to keep the CRT's deflection factor constant.

It refers to the tendency of [[liquid]]s — and of unbound aggregates of small solid objects, like seeds, gravel, or crushed ore, whose behavior approximates that of liquids — to move in response to changes in the [[Attitude dynamics and control|attitude]] of a craft's cargo holds, decks, or liquid tanks in reaction to operator-induced motions (or [[sea state]]s caused by waves and wind acting upon the craft). When referring to the [[free surface]] effect, the condition of a tank that is not full is described as a "slack tank", while a full tank is "pressed up".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shipinspection.eu/index.php?action=page_display&amp;PageID=444 Ship inspection maritime guide.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stability and equilibrium==
In a normally loaded vessel any rolling from perpendicular is countered by a [[righting moment]] generated from the increased volume of water displaced by the hull on the lowered side. This assumes the center of gravity of the vessel is relatively constant. If a moving mass inside the vessel moves in the direction of the roll, this counters the righting effect by moving the center of gravity towards the lowered side. The free surface effect can become a problem in a craft with large partially full bulk cargo compartments, fuel tanks, or water tanks (especially if they span the full breadth of the ship), or from accidental flooding, such as has occurred in several accidents involving [[roll-on/roll-off]] ferries.

If a compartment or tank is either empty or full, there is no change in the craft's center of mass as it rolls from side to side (in strong winds, heavy seas, or on sharp motions or turns). However, if the compartment is only partially full, the liquid in the compartment will respond to the vessel's [[Ship motions|heave, pitch, roll, surge, sway or yaw]]. For example, as a vessel rolls to port, liquid will displace to the port side of a compartment, and this will move the vessel's center of mass to port. This has the effect of slowing the vessel's return to vertical.

The [[momentum]] of large volumes of moving liquids cause significant [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] forces, which act against the righting effect. When the vessel returns to vertical the roll continues and the effect is repeated on the opposite side. In heavy sea states, this can become a [[positive feedback]] loop, causing each roll to become more and more extreme, eventually overcoming the righting effect leading to a capsize. While repeated oscillations of increasing magnitude are commonly associated with the free surface effect, they are not a necessary condition. For example, in the cases of both the {{SS|Normandie}} and {{MS|al-Salam Boccaccio 98}}, gradual buildup of water from fire-fighting caused capsizing in a single continuous roll.

==Mitigation==
To mitigate this hazard, cargo vessels use multiple smaller bulk compartments or liquid tanks, instead of fewer larger ones, and possibly [[wikt:baffle|baffle]]s within bulk compartments or liquid tanks to minimize the free surface effects on the craft as a whole. Keeping individual bulk compartments or liquid tanks either relatively empty or full is another way to minimize the effect and its attendant problems. [[Hydraulic tanker]]s use water to displace lighter oil to keep the tank full at all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morrell |first=Robert W. |authorlink = |title =Oil Tankers |publisher =Simmons-Boardman Publishing Company |volume = |edition =Second |date =1931 |location =New York |pages =305&amp;306 |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tanks or compartments that do not straddle the vessel's centerline are somewhat less prone to destabilising oscillations. Similarly, narrow compartments (aligned bow to stern) and compartments at the extremes away from the centerline, are less prone to cause instability.

==Historical examples==
Flooding, liquid cargo leakage, or unintended water (from precipitation, waves, or hull damage) in any compartments or on any decks of watercraft, and the resulting free surface effect are often a contributing cause of accidents, capsizes, and casualties e.g. the loss of {{ship|TEV|Wahine}} (Wellington, New Zealand, April 1968), {{MS|Herald of Free Enterprise}} (Zeebrugge, Belgium, March 1987), and {{MS|Estonia}} (Baltic Sea, September 1994). In the case of the RORO ferry ''[[al-Salam Boccaccio 98]]'' (Red Sea, February 2006), improper fire-fighting procedures caused flooding leading directly to instability and capsize. In both the cases of the ''al-Salam Boccaccio 98'' and {{Ship||Costa Concordia}}, severe listing followed immediately after the ship had undergone a hard turn, causing unstable volumes of water (from collision damage in the latter) to surge from one side of the ship to the other.

==Effects on land and aircraft==
The free surface effect can affect any kind of craft, including [[watercraft]] (where it is most common), [[bulk cargo]] or liquid [[Tanker (ship)|tanker]] [[semi-trailer]]s and [[truck]]s (causing either [[jackknifing]] or roll-overs), and [[aircraft]] (especially [[fire-fighting]] water-droppers and refueling tankers where baffles mitigate but do not eliminate the effects). The term "free surface effect" implies a liquid under the influence of gravity. [[Slosh dynamics]] is the overarching field which covers both free surface effects and situations such as space vehicles, where gravity is inconsequential but inertia and momentum interact with complex fluid mechanics to cause vehicle instability.

== Sam Harkleroad==
Sam Harkleroad was born on October 20, 1909, and grew up on a farm in [[Fresno]].  His education ended with high school.  He lived much of his life in  Marin County.  Harkleroad died on June 12, 1993, at the age of 83.

Harkleroad was a contractor, who liked to use recycled materials.

The Harkleroad structures are on a street named Harkle Road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Novato—Did You Know? |publisher=Marin Magazine |date=2009 |url=http://www.marinmagazine.com/Annual-2009/Novato/ |accessdate=August 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The [http://www.hattonbrown.com Hatton-Brown] organization''' in Montgomery, Alabama dates back to 1948, when local newspaperman Hartwell Hatton founded Hatton Publications at age 49. His first forest-oriented magazine, ''[[Alabama Lumberman]]'', was published from 1949-57.[[Image:Mrhatton old.jpg|frame|right|Hartwell Hatton]]

== History ==

Hatton, Brown &amp; Co., Inc. was established in 1953, the same year the company started a new Southern regional [[logging]] title, ''[[Pulpwood Production]]''. At 33, Charles Cline joined the company as editor in the summer of 1953 and helped get the first issue into print that August. ''Pulpwood Production'''s title was lengthened to ''[[Pulpwood Production &amp; Saw Mill Logging]]'' in 1956 and its circulation was extended into the Lake States and [[New England]] in 1962. Dianne Sullivan joined the company as circulation manager in 1964. &lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Pulpwoodprodold.jpg|frame|left|Pulpwood Production]] --&gt;

In 1966 and 1967 Hatton and Cline searched for a full time advertising salesman and editor.  David Ramsey, joined the staff as sales manager February 1968 and David Knight joined the company 30 days later as an editor.

Mr. Hatton retired in 1971 selling his stock to Charles Cline, David Ramsey and David Knight. Dianne Sullivan then became office manager.

== Publications ==

Anticipating the need for an economical logging newspaper in the South, Hatton-Brown launched ''[[Loggin' Times]]'' (later titled ''[[Southern Loggin' Times]]'') in 1972. In late 1974, sensing a change in the nature of the traditional [[pulpwood]] market, management decided to phase in a new name for ''[[Pulpwood Production &amp; Saw Mill Logging]]''. The latter part of the title was dropped and replaced with the words, ''Timber Harvesting''. The journal carried a double title until it went national in 1977 and became more fittingly known as ''[[Timber Harvesting]]''.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Tholdissue.jpg|frame|right|Timber Harvesting]] --&gt;
In 1977 ''[[Timber Processing Industry]]'', (later shortened to ''[[Timber Processing]]'') began as a regional tabloid newspaper for the sawmill Industry and remained so until 1978. In 1979 ''Timber Processing'' became a national sawmill magazine.

In 1981 Charles Cline retired and David Ramsey and David Knight became the new owners. Ramsey and Knight formed a new corporation '''Hatton-Brown Publishers, Inc.''' Dianne Sullivan became Secretary of the corporation, and was named General Manager and joined the owners on the Board of Directors.

In June of that year the company moved from 458 S. Lawrence St. to larger facilities at 610 S. McDonough St.

In 1981 David Ramsey, David Knight and some key employees of Hatton-Brown purchased another publication. A separate corporation, '''Plywood and Panel World, Inc.''', was formed to purchase a magazine known as ''[[Plywood &amp; Panel]]''. This journal, officially acquired in January 1982, was subsequently renamed ''[[Plywood &amp; Panel World]]'' and later ''[[Panel World]]''.

Hatton-Brown has also published the official program for various logging equipment expositions through the years. Some of which included: [[Timber Harvesting Expo-SE]] in south Georgia and [[Carolina Log'n Demo]] in eastern North Carolina.

In late 1988, with employment practically double the number of 1981, the company owners elected to build a new and larger office building at the corner of Clay and Hanrick Streets in Montgomery. The building was completed and occupied in April 1990. The official open house followed on June 7, 1990.

Hatton-Brown diversified its [[publishing]] interests in January 1991 by acquiring its first non-forestry or paper related title, ''[[Chain Saw Age &amp; Power Equipment Trade]]''. To position the publication for expanded outdoor power equipment advertising opportunities, the company in January 1992, officially changed the publication's title to ''[[Power Equipment Trade]]''.

In 1995 Hatton-Brown purchased its first consumer publication, ''[[IronWorks]]'', a nine-times-per-year upscale magazine appealing to [[Harley-Davidson]] [[motorcycle]] enthusiasts. Dennis Stemp, founder of the magazine remained as editor until his death.
 
Hatton-Brown purchased another wood products magazine, ''[[Southern Lumberman]]'', in late summer of 1999. This publication has been published under this title since 1881, making it the oldest forestry related trade magazine in the country.

In [[electrical engineering]] and [[power system automation]], the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] 60870 standards define systems used for telecontrol ([[supervisory control and data acquisition]]). Such systems are used for controlling electric power transmission grids and other geographically widespread control systems. By use of standardized protocols, equipment from many different suppliers can be made to interoperate. IEC standard 60870 has six parts, defining general information related to the standard, operating conditions, electrical interfaces, performance requirements, and data transmission protocols. The 60870 standards are developed by [[IEC TC 57|IEC Technical Committee 57]] (Working Group 03).

== List of IEC 60870 parts ==
*IEC TR 60870-1-1:1988 General considerations. Section One: General principles
*IEC 60870-1-2:1989 General considerations. Section Two: Guide for specifications
*IEC TR 60870-1-3:1997 General considerations - Section 3: Glossary
*IEC TR 60870-1-4:1994 General considerations - Section 4: Basic aspects of telecontrol data transmission and organization of standards IEC 870-5 and IEC 870-6
*IEC TR 60870-1-5:2000 General considerations - Section 4: Influence of modem transmission procedures with scramblers on the data integrity of transmission systems using the protocol IEC 60870-5
*IEC 60870-2-1:1995 Operating conditions - Section 1: Power supply and electromagnetic compatibility
*IEC 60870-2-2:1996 Operating conditions - Section 2: Environmental conditions (climatic, mechanical and other non electrical influences)
*IEC 60870-3:1989 Interfaces (electrical characteristics)
*IEC 60870-4:1990 Performance requirements

== IEC 60870-5 ==
{{Main|IEC 60870-5}}
IEC 60870 part 5, known as '''Transmission protocols''', &lt;ref name=Clarke04&gt;Gordon R. Clarke et al, ''Practical modern SCADA protocols: DNP3, 60870.5 and related systems'',Newnes, 2004 {{ISBN|0-7506-5799-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a communication profile for sending basic telecontrol messages between two systems, which uses permanent directly connected data circuits between the systems. The IEC TC 57 WG3 have developed a [[Communications protocol|protocol]] standard for telecontrol, teleprotection, and associated telecommunications for [[electric power]] systems. The result of this work is IEC 60870-5. Five documents specify the base IEC 60870-5:
* IEC 60870-5-1 Transmission Frame Formats
* IEC 60870-5-2 Data Link Transmission Services
* IEC 60870-5-3 General Structure of Application Data
* IEC 60870-5-4 Definition and Coding of Information Elements
* IEC 60870-5-5 Basic Application Functions
* IEC 60870-5-6 Guidelines for conformance testing for the IEC 60870-5 companion standards
* IEC TS 60870-5-7 Security extensions to IEC 60870-5-101 and IEC 60870-5-104 protocols (applying IEC 62351)

The IEC TC 57 has also generated companion standards:
* IEC 60870-5-101 Transmission Protocols - companion standards especially for basic telecontrol tasks
* IEC 60870-5-102 Transmission Protocols - Companion standard for the transmission of integrated totals in electric power systems (this standard is not widely used)
* IEC 60870-5-103 Transmission Protocols - Companion standard for the informative interface of protection equipment
* IEC 60870-5-104 Transmission Protocols - Network access for IEC 60870-5-101 using standard transport profiles
* IEC TS 60870-5-601 Transmission protocols - Conformance test cases for the IEC 60870-5-101 companion standard
* IEC TS 60870-5-604 Conformance test cases for the IEC 60870-5-104 companion standard

IEC 60870-5-101/102/103/104 are companion standards generated for basic telecontrol tasks, transmission of integrated totals, data exchange from protection equipment &amp; network access of IEC101 respectively.

== IEC 60870-6 ==
{{Main|IEC 60870-6}}
IEC TC 57 WG3 also generated standards for telecontrol protocols compatible with ISO standards and ITU-T recommendations. These standards include:
* IEC 60870-6-1 Application context and organization of standards
* IEC 60870-6-2 Use of basic standards (OSI layers 1–4)
* IEC 60870-6-501 TASE.1 Service definitions
* IEC 60870-6-502 TASE.1 Protocol definitions
* IEC 60870-6-503 TASE.2 Services and protocol
* IEC 60870-6-504 TASE.1 User conventions
* IEC TR 60870-6-505 TASE.2 User guide
* IEC 60870-6-601 Functional profile for providing the connection-oriented transport service in an end system connected via permanent access to a packet switched data network
* IEC 60870-6-602 TASE transport profiles
* IEC 60870-6-701 Functional profile for providing the TASE.1 application service in end systems
* IEC 60870-6-702 Functional profile for providing the TASE.2 application service in end systems
* IEC 60870-6-802 TASE.2 Object models

'''Isobutylgermane''' ('''IBGe''', [[Chemical formula]]: (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;GeH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), is an [[organogermanium compound]].  It is a colourless, volatile liquid that is used in [[MOVPE]] ([[Metalorganic]] Vapor Phase [[Epitaxy]]) as an alternative to [[germane]]. IBGe is used in the deposition of Ge films and Ge-containing thin [[semiconductor]] films such as [[SiGe]] in [[strained silicon]] application, and [[GeSbTe]] in [[NAND Flash]] applications.

==Properties==
IBGe is a non-[[pyrophoric]] liquid source for chemical vapor deposition ([[Chemical vapor deposition|CVD]]) and [[atomic layer deposition]] (ALD) of [[semiconductors]]. It possesses very high vapor pressure and is considerably less hazardous than germane gas. IBGe also offers lower decomposition temperature (the onset of decomposition at ca. 325-350 °C).,&lt;ref name=crystalgrowthabstract2&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TJ6-4MS9K7M-1&amp;_user=208309&amp;_coverDate=01%2F31%2F2007&amp;_alid=754729900&amp;_rdoc=3&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_cdi=5302&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_ct=41&amp;_acct=C000014358&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=208309&amp;md5=00462bdb50786f22769e4ca9e4c583bd Safer alternative liquid germanium precursors for relaxed graded SiGe layers and strained silicon by MOVPE]; D.V.

==Uses==
[[Rohm and Haas]] (now part of The [[Dow Chemical Company]]), IMEM, and [[CNRS]] have developed a process to grow germanium films on germanium at low temperatures in a Metalorganic Vapor Phase Epitaxy ([[MOVPE]]) reactor using isobutylgermane. The research targets Ge/III-V hetero devices.&lt;ref name=crystalgrowthabstract&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TJ6-4HNSJS8-X&amp;_user=10&amp;_handle=V-WA-A-W-AUY-MsSWYWW-UUA-U-AAZBCYVDBE-AAZAAZCCBE-WUWZDAWZE-AUY-U&amp;_fmt=summary&amp;_coverDate=01%2F25%2F2006&amp;_rdoc=103&amp;_orig=browse&amp;_srch=%23toc%235302%232006%23997129997%23614855!&amp;_cdi=5302&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=b727a26cf1d2921d65096fc1f93658bb Designing Novel Organogermanium OMVPE Precursors for High-purity Germanium Films]; Shenai-Khatkhate et al., Rohm and Haas Electronic Materials; ''Presentation at ACCGE-16, Montana, USA, July 11, 2005'', and publication in ''Journal of Crystal Growth'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been demonstrated that the growth of high quality germanium films at temperatures as low as 350 °C can be achieved.&lt;ref name=crystalgrowthpresentation2&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2008.04.009 MOVPE growth of homoepitaxial germanium], M.

'''Liander''' is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Electric utility|utility]] company which operates in the distribution of [[Electricity distribution|electricity]] and [[natural gas]] in part of the Netherlands. Liander NV is the largest utility company in the Netherlands, managing the energy network in the provinces of [[Gelderland]] and [[Noord-Holland]] entirely, and in large parts of [[Flevoland]], [[Friesland]] and [[Zuid-Holland]].

Liander NV was formerly known as Continuon, and is now a division of the umbrella-company Alliander. Alliander includes also Liandon (formerly Nuon Tecno), focused on building and maintenance of large energy infrastructures, and Lyandin (formerly Dynamicom) that operates in lighting of public spaces.

Liander was split from the [[Nuon (company)|Nuon]] group in July 2008 and since 12 November 2008 it has operated under the new name Liander. Nuon continues to operate as a production and supply company, under the name Nuon Energy.

The '''limiting oxygen concentration''' is shown in the lower right of the diagram.]] 
The '''limiting oxygen concentration, (LOC)''',&lt;ref&gt;Perry&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the '''minimum oxygen concentration, (MOC)''',&lt;ref&gt;Drysdale&lt;/ref&gt; is defined as the limiting concentration of [[oxygen]] below which [[combustion]] is not possible, independent of the concentration of fuel.  It is expressed in units of volume percent of oxygen.  The LOC varies with pressure and temperature.  It is also dependent on the type of inert (non-flammable) gas.

The effect of increasing the concentration of [[inert gas]] can be understood by viewing the inert as thermal ballast that quenches the flame temperature to a level below which the flame cannot exist.&lt;ref&gt;Drysdale:84-85&lt;/ref&gt;  Carbon dioxide is therefore more effective than nitrogen due to its higher molar [[heat capacity]].&lt;ref&gt;Drysdale:92&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept has important practical use in [[fire safety engineering]].  For instance, to safely fill a new container or a pressure vessel with flammable gasses, the atmosphere of normal air (containing 20.9 volume percent of oxygen) in the vessel would first be flushed (purged) with [[nitrogen]] or another [[non-flammable]] inert gas, thereby reducing the oxygen concentration inside the container.  When the oxygen concentration is below the LOC, flammable gas can then be safely admitted to the vessel, because the possibility of internal explosion has been eliminated.

The limiting oxygen concentration is a necessary parameter when designing [[hypoxic air fire prevention system]]s.

[[Image:Luminescent paint pigment applied on a diver’s watch to make it readable in low light conditions..jpg|thumb|Lume applied on a diver’s watch to make it readable in low light conditions.]]
'''Lume''' is a short term for the luminous [[phosphorescence|phosphorescent]] glowing solution applied on [[watch dial]]s. There are some people who "relume" watches, or replace faded lume. Formerly, lume consisted mostly of [[radium]]; however, radium is [[radioactive]] and has been mostly replaced on new watches by less bright, but less toxic compounds.

Common pigments used in lume include the [[phosphorescence|phosphorescent]] pigments [[zinc sulfide]] and [[strontium aluminate]]. Use of zinc sulfide for safety related products dates back to the 1930s. However, the development of strontium oxide aluminate, with a luminance approximately 10 times greater than zinc sulfide, has relegated most zinc sulfide based products to the novelty category. Strontium oxide aluminate based pigments are now used in exit signs, pathway marking, and other safety related signage.

Strontium aluminate based afterglow pigments are marketed under brandnames like [[Super-LumiNova]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rctritec.com/index.php?id=13 RC TRITEC Super-LumiNova]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nemoto.co.jp/en/products/luminova/index.html Nemoto &amp; Co., Ltd LumiNova] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517010332/http://www.nemoto.co.jp/en/products/luminova/index.html |date=2008-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Watchlume Co,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watchlume.net watchlume's website]&lt;/ref&gt; NoctiLumina,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noctilumina.com/ NoctiLumina company website]&lt;/ref&gt; and Glow in the Dark (Phosphorescent) Technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://glowinc.com/glow-in-the-dark/glow-in-the-dark-technologies.aspx Glow in the Dark (Phosphorescent) Technologies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915142453/http://glowinc.com/glow-in-the-dark/glow-in-the-dark-technologies.aspx |date=2008-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MT ''Haven''''', formerly '''''Amoco Milford Haven''''', was a [[VLCC]] ([[supertanker|very large crude carrier]]), leased to [[Troodos Shipping]] (a company run by [[Lucas Haji-Ioannou]] and his son [[Stelios Haji-Ioannou]]). In 1991, while loaded with 144,000 tonnes (1 million barrels) of [[crude oil]], the ship exploded, caught fire and sank off the coast of [[Genoa]], [[Italy]], killing six [[Cyprus|Cypriot]] crew and flooding the [[Mediterranean]] with up to 50,000 tonnes of [[crude oil]].&lt;ref name="observ"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://observer.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,687834,00.html |title=Making it all look easy |first=Joanna |last=Walters |date=21 April 2002|work=[[The Observer]] |accessdate=10 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It broke in two and sank after burning for three days, and for the next 12 years the Mediterranean coast of Italy and [[France]] was polluted, especially around Genoa and southern France.

==History==
''Amoco Milford Haven'' was built by [[Astilleros Españoles S.A.]] in [[Cadiz]], [[Spain]], the [[sister ship]] of ''[[Amoco Cadiz]]'', which sank in 1978. Launched in 1973, she worked various routes shipping crude oil from the [[middle east]] gulf. In 1988 she was hit by a missile in the [[Persian Gulf]] during the [[Iran-Iraq War]]. Extensively refitted in [[Singapore]], she was sold to ship brokers who leased her to [[Troodos Shipping]], for whom she ran from [[Iran]]'s [[Kharg Island]] to the [[Mediterranean]].

==Accident==
On 11 April 1991, ''Haven'' was unloading a cargo of 230,000 [[tonnes]] of crude oil to the [[Multedo]] floating platform, {{convert|11|km|mi}} off the coast of [[Genoa]], [[Italy]]. Having transferred 80,000 tonnes, the ship disconnected from the platform for a routine internal transfer operation, to allow oil to be pumped from two side-holds into a central one.

In later testimony, [[First mate|First Officer]] Donatos Lilis said: "I heard a very loud noise, like iron bars beating against each other. Perhaps the cover of a pump had broken. Then there was an awful explosion." Five crewmen died immediately, as fire broke out and oil started leaking from the hull as the plates overheated. As the fire engulfed the ship, flames rose 100m high and, after a series of further explosions occurred, between 30-40,000 tons of oil poured into the sea.

The Italian authorities acted quickly, with hundreds of men fighting a fire which was difficult to access, and distributing more than {{convert|10|km|mi}} of inflatable barriers, submerged a [[metre]] below the surface, around the vessel to control the spillage. On day two, MT ''Haven'' was to be towed close to the coast, in a bid to reduce the coastal area affected and make intervention easier. As the bow slipped beneath the surface, a steel cable was passed around the rudder and tugs applied towing pressure. But it was quickly clear that the ship had broken its back, and the bow section came to rest in 450m of water. On 14 April, the 250m long main body sank {{convert|2|km|mi}} from the coast, between [[Arenzano]] and [[Cogoleto]]

==Shipwreck==
[[File:MT Haven Wreck.jpg|thumb|Wreck of MT ''Haven'']]
After the wreck was declared safe, a [[mini sub]] diver found that the stern section had grazed a rocky spur, though not hard enough to open any new holes in the hull, and come to rest at an angle on the flat, sandy seabed. He reported that most of the remaining 80,000 tons of crude had burnt or was at the surface. Most of the oil on the surface could be sucked up, and what remained below was in a solid state. For the next 12 years the Mediterranean coast of Italy and France was polluted, especially around [[Genoa]] and southern [[France]].

''Haven'' is the largest shipwreck in the sea and lies at a depth of 33 to 83m off the coast of [[Genoa]]. It is a popular tourist attraction with deep sea divers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Haven: The world's largest wreck at Arenzana-Genova, Italy |publisher=Diving-World |url= http://www.diving-world.com/haven.htm |date=5 October 2007 |accessdate=16 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court case==

===Background and allegations===
At the centre of the case was the allegation that Lucas and Stelios had kept their vessel, the Troodos-owned Cyprus-flagged ''Haven'', in such disrepair that she exploded. According to news items it is also alleged that the tanker was scrapped after being hit by an [[Exocet]] missile during the Iran–Iraq War and should not have been put back into operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Haven (IMO 7304302): Summary for Casualty ID 19910411_001 |url=http://www.c4tx.org/ctx/job/cdb/precis.php5?key=19880301_001 |work=Casualty Database |publisher=Center for Tankship Excellence |accessdate=16 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutors had asked for seven-year sentences for manslaughter against both father and son. Christos Dovles, former director of the shipping firm for whom prosecutors had sought a sentence of two years and four months.

===Outcome===
Lucas and Stelios were later acquitted after three retrials (of which 2002 was the last) and much controversy, with subsequent appeals and demands for compensation also thrown out.&lt;ref name="observ"/&gt; Stelios was quoted after the trial: "My main comment is to ask why it took so long to clear innocent people of these terrible charges."&lt;ref name="cyprus"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jean |last=Christou |url=http://www.hri.org/news/cyprus/cmnews/1997/97-11-25.cmnews.html#09 |title=Unions and environmental groups furious at Haji-Ioannou acquittal |date=25 November 1997 |work=[[Cyprus Mail]] |accessdate=10 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302025218/http://www.hri.org/news/cyprus/cmnews/1997/97-11-25.cmnews.html |archivedate=2 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Italy's Environment Ministry under-secretary said he was "greatly embittered" by the verdict, saying, "The victims, the relatives and the marine environment that were all seriously damaged are left without convincing answers."&lt;ref name="cyprus"/&gt;

The Italian president of the [[World Wildlife Fund]], Grazia Francescato, said in a statement that she was disgusted with Stelios' conduct. She drew similarities with the [[Moby Prince disaster|''Moby Prince'' disaster]], an unrelated collision in which 140 people died on a ferry just off the nearby city of [[Livorno]], and the acquittal of four men on charges of manslaughter.&lt;ref name="cyprus"/&gt;

[[NUMAST]], the union that represents merchant officers, described the acquittal as "depressing", a sentiment also expressed by the [[International Transport Workers' Federation]]. Only by making ship owners accountable for the state of vessels under their control would substandard ships be eliminated, Andrew Linington, head of communications at NUMAST said. "Even when ship owners were clearly linked with a ship that did not meet acceptable standards it seems no action will be taken," Linington said.&lt;ref name="cyprus"/&gt;

The '''March 6–8, 2018 nor'easter''' was a powerful [[nor'easter]] that wreaked havoc on the [[Northeastern United States]] just days after [[March 1–3, 2018 nor'easter|another intense nor'easter]] struck the Mid-Atlantic, hampering recovery efforts from that storm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://weather.com/storms/winter/news/2018-03-07-winter-storm-quinn-noreaster-snow-wind-forecast|title=Winter Storm Quinn Will Hammer the Northeast With Heavy Snow, Strong Winds, Leading to More Power Outages, Tree Damage|publisher=|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forming near the [[Outer Banks]] late on March 6 as the end phase of a long-tracked [[winter storm]] across the country, it rapidly deepened off the Mid-Atlantic coast on March 7 and brought up to {{convert|3|ft|in}} of heavy [[snow]], whiteout conditions and even coastal flooding (though nowhere near the levels seen in the prior nor'easter) to those in the impact zone from the storm, many of which were still without power from the previous storm less than a week prior.

The storm caused up to 1 million people to lose power, and at least two people has been confirmed dead due to the storm as of March 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Staff |first=Writer |url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2018/03/08/tri-state-area-storm-deaths/ |title=Storm Blamed For At Least 2 Deaths In Tri-State Area |work=[[WCBS-TV]] |date=2018-03-08 |accessdate=2018-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of flights were cancelled across the region, and many schools closed due to the nor'easter, although some opted to remain open such as those in [[New York City]], causing controversy. Many freeways were also closed in the regions, and several states were put under [[state of emergency|state of emergencies]].

==Meteorological history==
While the [[March 1–3, 2018 nor'easter|previous nor'easter]] hammered the [[Northeastern U.S.]] on March 2–3, another winter storm had begun setting up in the western part of the country, dumping very heavy snow in the Sierra Mountains. This storm moved into the [[Upper Midwest]] over the next few days and became an intense snowstorm for the affected areas. By early on March 6, the system had reached the [[Great Lakes]], with the surface low beginning to weaken. As it did so, energy began to be transferred over to a new area of low pressure that was forming near the [[Outer Banks]] late that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=03/07/2018&amp;selmap=2018030621&amp;maptype=satsfcnps|title=WPC Surface Analysis for 21:00 UTC on 3/06/2018|work=[[Weather Prediction Center]]|date=March 6, 2018|accessdate=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the new low began to rapidly intensify, the [[Weather Prediction Center]] (WPC) began issuing storm summaries on the intensifying low off the coast of [[New Jersey]] early on March 7.&lt;ref name="summary1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Storm Summary Number 1 for Mid-Atlantic to Northeast Winter Storm|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/storm_summaries/storm12/stormsum_1.html|website=Storm Summary Message|publisher=National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center|accessdate=March 7, 2018|location=College Park, Maryland|date=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sharp transition of heavy snow to rain was observed near the [[Jersey Shore]], due to warm air aloft pushing slightly inland, with the cold air residing just inland.&lt;ref name="summary2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Storm Summary Number 2 for Mid-Atlantic to Northeast Winter Storm|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/storm_summaries/storm12/stormsum_2.html|website=Storm Summary Message|publisher=National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center|accessdate=March 7, 2018|location=College Park, Maryland|date=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thundersnow]] and snowfall rates of up to {{convert|3|in|cm}} an hour were reported in areas around the [[Tri-State Area]], signaling the rapid intensification of the storm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/east-coast-bracing-2nd-noreaster-week/story?id=53575745|title=Treacherous conditions expected this evening as nor'easter pummels Northeast|first=A.

After peaking, the system began to gradually weaken as it continued moving northeastwards towards the [[Canadian Maritimes]] late on March 7–8, while heavy snowfall fell around the areas near [[Boston, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="summary5"&gt;{{cite web|title=Storm Summary Number 5 for Mid-Atlantic to Northeast Winter Storm|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/storm_summaries/storm12/stormsum_5.html|website=Storm Summary Message|publisher=National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center|accessdate=March 11, 2018|location=College Park, Maryland|date=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turning northwestward slightly, moderate snowfall continued to occur over the coastal and interior sections of [[New England]]. The low continued to spin down throughout the day, with snow tapering off in much of the region except for the northern parts of [[New York (state)|New York]] and far northern New England. By 15:00&amp;nbsp;UTC the next day, the system had weakened to the point where the WPC terminated storm summaries on the [[winter storm]].&lt;ref name="summary10"&gt;{{cite web|title=Storm Summary Number 10 for Mid-Atlantic to Northeast Winter Storm|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/storm_summaries/storm12/stormsum_10.html|website=Storm Summary Message|publisher=National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center|accessdate=March 7, 2018|location=College Park, Maryland|date=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It dissipated shortly afterwards.

====New York====
In [[New York City]], the exceptionally heavy snow made travel difficult, with ferry service suspended. [[Central Park]] reported 3.2 inches, while [[JFK International Airport]] reported only 2.8 inches, which was much less than many of the forecasts, which suggested that 1-2 feet of snow would fall. However, there was a very sharp gradient in snow totals, with Franklin Lakes, NJ, just under 20 miles away from Central Park, reporting a total of 24.8 inches. In [[North White Plains, New York|North White Plains]], 10 people were taken to the hospital with carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator running inside their home. Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] announced a travel ban for tractor-trailers along the [[New York State Thruway]] between New York City and [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]]. Classes were cancelled until March 9 at [[Binghamton University]] due to the storm.&lt;ref name="weather1"/&gt; Many schools in the Lower Hudson Valley closed for the fifth time in a row, eliminating most of the districts’ spring breaks (from Friday, March 2 to Thursday, March 8). Putnam County issued a State Of Emergency, closing all school districts in the county on Thursday, March 8.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9012">The '''mean effective pressure''' is a quantity relating to the operation of a [[reciprocating engine]] and is a valuable measure of an engine's capacity to do work that is independent of [[engine displacement]].{{sfnp|Heywood|1988|page=50}} When quoted as an ''indicated'' mean effective pressure or IMEP (defined below), it may be thought of as the average [[pressure]] acting on a piston during the different portions of its cycle.

==Derivation==
Let:
:&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; = work per cycle in joule
:&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; = power output in watt
:&lt;math&gt;p_{me}&lt;/math&gt; = mean effective pressure in pascal
:&lt;math&gt;V_d&lt;/math&gt; = displacement volume in cubic metre
:&lt;math&gt;n_c&lt;/math&gt; = number of revolutions per power stroke (for a 4-stroke engine &lt;math&gt;n_c =2&lt;/math&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; = number of revolutions per second
:&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; = torque in newton-metre

The [[Power (physics)|power]] produced by the engine is equal to the work done per operating cycle times the number of operating cycles per second. If ''N'' is the number of revolutions per second, and &lt;math&gt;n_c&lt;/math&gt; is the number of revolutions per power stroke, the number of power strokes per second is just their ratio. We can write
:&lt;math&gt;
P = {W  {N \over n_c}}
&lt;/math&gt;
Reordering to put work on the left:
:&lt;math&gt;
W = {P n_c \over N}
&lt;/math&gt;

By definition:
:&lt;math&gt;
W = p_{me}  V_d
&lt;/math&gt;
so that
:&lt;math&gt;
p_{me} = {P n_c \over V_d N}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since the [[torque]] ''T'' is related to the angular speed (which is just ''N'' 2 ''π'') and power produced by
:&lt;math&gt;
P = T N {2 \pi}
&lt;/math&gt;

Then the equation for mep in terms of torque becomes,
:&lt;math&gt;
p_{me} = {T n_c \over V_d} {2 \pi}
&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that speed has dropped out of the equation and the only variables are the torque and displacement volume. Since the range of maximum brake mean effective pressures for good engine designs is well established, we now have a displacement-independent measure of the torque-producing capacity of an engine design (a specific torque of sorts). This is useful for comparing engines of different displacements. Mean effective pressure is also useful for initial design calculations; that is, given a torque, standard MEP values can be used to estimate the required engine displacement. However, it is important to remember that mean effective pressure does not reflect the actual pressures inside an individual combustion chamber—although the two are certainly related—and serves only as a convenient measure of performance.

Brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) is calculated from measured [[dynamometer]] torque. Net indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) is calculated using the [[horsepower|indicated power]]; i.e., the pressure volume integral in the work per cycle equation. Sometimes the term FMEP (friction mean effective pressure) is used as an indicator of the mean effective pressure lost to friction (or friction torque) and is just the difference between IMEP&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; and BMEP.

==Types of mean effective pressures==
Mean effective pressure (MEP) is defined by the location measurement and method of calculation, some commonly used MEPs are given here.

* Brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) - Mean effective pressure calculated from measured brake torque.
* Gross indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;) - Mean effective pressure calculated from in-cylinder pressure over compression and expansion portion of engine cycle (360° in a [[four-stroke]], 180° in a [[two-stroke]]).  Direct measurement requires cylinder pressure sensing equipment.
* Net indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) - Mean effective pressure calculated from in-cylinder pressure over the complete engine cycle (720° in a four-stroke, 360° in a two-stroke).  Direct measurement requires cylinder pressure sensing equipment.
* Pumping mean effective pressure (PMEP) - Mean effective pressure from work moving air in and out of the cylinder, across the intake and exhaust valves. Calculated from in-cylinder pressure over intake and exhaust portions of engine cycle (360° in a four-stroke, 0° in a two-stroke).  Direct measurement requires cylinder pressure sensing equipment. PMEP = IMEP&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; - IMEP&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.
* Friction mean effective pressure (FMEP) - Theoretical mean effective pressure required to overcome engine friction, can be thought of as mean effective pressure lost due to friction. Friction mean effective pressure calculation requires accurate measurement of cylinder pressure and dynamometer brake torque.  FMEP = IMEP&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; - BMEP.

==BMEP typical values==

* High boost engines such as the [[Koenigsegg Agera]] can run at BMEPs as high as 28 bar (32 bar for the Agera R)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |author= Drive |title= The 1140 hp Heart of a Hypercar - Inside Koenigsegg |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzVc13UF2s8 |date= 26 February 2013 |publisher= Youtube}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Formula One engines]] : in 1986 the 1.5L Williams-Honda FW11 Turbo produced {{cvt|1400|hp|kW|0}} at 12000 rpm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.f1technical.net/articles/26 |title= F1 rules and stats 1980-1989 |work= F1Technical |date= 1 Jan 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; for {{#expr:1044000/(2*pi)/(12000/60)round0}} Nm of torque, a {{cvt|{{#expr:4*pi*8.31/1.5round1}}|bar|psi}} BMEP.

* Top Fuel dragster engines: 80–100 bar (8.0-10 MPa; 1160-1450&amp;nbsp;psi)

Diesel Engines :
* Naturally aspirated four-stroke diesels: current [[List of Volkswagen Group diesel engines|VW diesel engines]] have a {{cvt|8.9|bar|psi}} maximum MEP, {{cvt|8|bar|psi}} at max power.
* Boosted automotive four-stroke diesels : current [[List of Volkswagen Group diesel engines|VW diesel engines]] have a {{cvt|17.7|to|31.9|bar|psi}} maximum MEP, {{cvt|14.5|to|26.8|bar|psi}} at max power.
* Two-stroke diesels have comparable values, but very large low speed diesels like the [[Wärtsilä-Sulzer RTA96-C]] can run at BMEPs of up to 19 bar (1.9 MPa; 275&amp;nbsp;lbf/in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).
* The [[Wärtsilä]] W31, the world's most efficient four-stroke diesel engine as of October 2015, has a mean effective pressure of 30.1 bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cdn.wartsila.com/docs/default-source/product-files/engines/ms-engine/brochure-o-e-w31.pdf |title= Wärtsilä 31 |publisher= Wärtsilä |date= 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For example, a four-stroke motor producing 160 N·m from 2 litres of displacement has a bmep of (4π)(160 N·m)/(0.002 m³) = 1,005,000 N/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=1,005 kPa (10.05 [[Bar (unit)|bar]]). If the same engine produces 76&amp;nbsp;kW at 5400 rpm (90&amp;nbsp;Hz), its torque is 134 N·m and its bmep is 8.42 bar (842 kPa). As piston engines usually have their maximum torque at a lower rotating speed than the maximum power output, the BMEP is lower at full power (at higher rotating speed). The exception is with engines with sharp artificial torque limiter past certain RPM, as in 320 N·m, 90&amp;nbsp;kW RZ4E for trucks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.isuzutruck.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Isuzu-Spec-Sheet-Grafter-Green-N35_125S-1.pdf |title= Grafter Green N35.125 |publisher= Isuzu Truck UK |date= March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, with calculated BMEP of 21.16 bar from 1600 to 2800 rpm, peak power at 2800 rpm.

== Phenomenology ==
Mechanically stimulated gas emission (MSGE) is a complex phenomenon embracing various physical and chemical processes occurring on the surface and in the bulk of a solid under applied mechanical stress and resulting in emission of gases. MSGE is a part of a more general phenomenon of Mechanically Stimulated Neutral Emission (MSNE).&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson J.T. Atomic and molecular emission following fracture of alkali halides: a dislocation driven process. J. Mat. Res. 1991. V. 6. P. 112 .&lt;/ref&gt; The specific characteristics of MSGE as compared with MSNE is that the emitted neutral particles are limited to gas molecules. MSGE is opposite to Mechanically Stimulated Gas Absorption that usually occurs under [[fretting]] [[corrosion]] of metals, exposure to gases at high pressures, etc. &lt;br /&gt;
There are three main sources of MSGE:&lt;ref&gt;Řepa P. Mechanically induced desorption. Vacuum. 1992. V.43. P. 367-371&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Řepa P., Rott, M. Outgassing of metals stimulated by friction. Vacuum. 1997. V.48. P. 775-778&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Řepa P., Orálek D. Outgassing stimulated by deformation. Vacuum. 1999. V. 53. P. 299-302&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nevshupa R., de Segovia J.L., Roman E. The origin of gas desorption during friction in an ultrahigh vacuum. J. Vac. Sci Technol A , v 26. 2008. – P. 1218-1223.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
: I. Gas molecules adsorbed on the surface of a solid
: IIa. Gases dissolved in the material bulk
: IIb. Gases occluded or trapped in micro- and nanovoids, discontinuties and on defects in the material bulk
: III. Gases generated as a result of mechanical activation of chemical reactions.&lt;ref&gt;Urakaev F. K. Mechanodestruction of minerals at the crack tip (Overview): 1. Experiment.Physics and Chemistry of Minerals. 2007. V.34. P. 351-361&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mori S., Shitara Y. Tribochemical activation of gold surface by scratching. Applied Surface Science. 1994. V. 78. P. 269-273.&lt;/ref&gt;
Generally, for producing MSGE, the mechanical action on the solid can be of any type including tension, compression, torsion, shearing, rubbing, fretting, rolling, indentation, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
In previous studies carried out by various groups it was found that MSGE is associated mainly with plastic deformation, fracture, wear and other irreversible modifications of a solid.&lt;ref&gt;Frisch B., Thiele W.-R. The tribologically induced effect of hydrogen effusion and penetration in steels. Wear. 1984.  V.95. P. 213-227.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Louthan M.R., et al. Hydrogen embrittlement of metals, Material Science and Engineering. 1972. V. 10. P. 357-368.&lt;/ref&gt; Under elastic deformation MSGE is almost negligible and only was observed just below elastic limit due to possible microplastic deformation. &lt;br /&gt;
In accordance to the main sources, the emitted gases usually contain [[hydrogen]] (source type IIa), [[argon]] (for coatings obtained using [[Physical vapor deposition|PVD]] in Ar plasma - source type IIb), [[methane]] (source type III), [[water]] (source type I and/or III), carbon [[Carbon monoxide|mono-]] and [[Carbon dioxide|dioxide]] (source type I/III). &lt;br /&gt;
The knowledge on the mechanisms of MSGE is still vague. On the basis of the experimental findings it was speculated that the following processes can be related with MSGE:
# Transport of gas atoms by moving [[dislocations]]
# Gas diffusion in the bulk driven by gradient of mechanical stress
# [[Phase transformation]] induced by deformation
# Removal of oxide and other surface layers, which prevent exit of dissolved atoms on the surface
# Extension of free surface
Thermal effect seems to be irrelevant to the gas emission under light load conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Nevshupa R.A., Roman E., de Segovia J.L. Model of the effect of local frictional heating on the tribodesorbed gases from metals in ultra-high vacuum. International Journal of Materials and Product Technology. 2010. V. 38, N.1, pp. 57-65&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
Emerging character of this interdisciplinar branch of science is reflected by a lack of established terminology. There are different terms and definitions used by different authors depending on the main approach used (chemical, physical, mechanical, vacuum science, etc.), specific gas emission mechanism (desorption, emanation, emission, etc.) and type of mechanical activation (friction, traction, etc.):&lt;br /&gt;
:Mechanically stimulated outgassing (MSO) &lt;ref&gt;Peressadko A. G., Nevshupa R. A., Deulin E.A. Mechanically stimulated outgassing from ball bearings in vacuum.Vacuum. 2002. V. 64. P. 451-456&lt;/ref&gt;
:Tribodesorption
:Triboemission,&lt;ref&gt;Nevshupa R. A. Triboemission: an attempt of developing a generalized classification», in “Tribology: science and applications”. Vienna: PAS, 2003. P. 11-25&lt;/ref&gt;
:Fractoemission &lt;ref&gt;Dickinson J. T., Langford S. C., Jensen L. C.,  Fractoemission from fused silica and sodium silicate glasses. J. Vac. Sci. Technol. A. 1988. V.6. Р. 1084-1089&lt;/ref&gt;
:Atomic and Molecular emission &lt;ref&gt;Dickinson J. T., Jensen L. C., Langford S. C. Atomic and Molecular Emission Accompanying Fracture of Single-Crystal Ge: A Dislocation Driven Process.  Phys. Rev. Lett. 1991. V.66. P.2120-2123&lt;/ref&gt;
:Outgassing stimulated by friction &lt;ref&gt;Řepa P., Rott, M. Outgassing of metals stimulated by friction. Vacuum. 1997. V.48. P. 775-778&lt;/ref&gt;
:Outgassing stimulated by deformation &lt;ref&gt;Řepa P., Orálek D. Outgassing stimulated by deformation. Vacuum. 1999. V. 53. P. 299-302&lt;/ref&gt;
Desorption (tribodesorption, fractodesorption, etc.) refers to release of gases dissolved in the bulk and adsorbed on the surface. Therefore, desortpion is only one of the contributing processes to MSGE. Outgassing is a technical term usually utilized in vacuum science. Thus, term "gas emission" embraces various processes, reflects the physical nature of this complex phenomenon and is preferable for use in scientific publications.

== Experimental observations ==
Due to low emission rate experiments should be performed in ultrahigh vacuum ([[Ultra high vacuum|UHV]]). In some studies the materials were previously doped with [[tritium]]. MSGE rate then was measured by radioactivity outcome from the material under applied mechanical stress.&lt;ref&gt;Louthan M. R. Jr., Derrick R. G. Hydrogen transport in austenitic stainless steel. Corrosion science. 1975. V. 15, № 6-12. Р. 565-570&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10857">'''Mycolic acids''' are long [[fatty acid]]s found in the [[cell wall]]s of the [[Mycobacterium|Mycolata]] [[taxon]], a group of [[bacteria]] that includes ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'', the causative agent of the disease [[tuberculosis]].  They form the major component of the cell wall of mycolata species.  Despite their name, mycolic acids have no biological link to [[fungus|fungi]]; the name arises from the filamentous appearance their presence gives mycolata under high magnification.  The presence of mycolic acids in the cell wall also gives mycolata a distinct gross morphological trait known as "[[Cording (mycobacterium)|cording]]".  Mycolic acids were first isolated by Stodola ''et al.'' in 1938 from an extract of ''M. tuberculosis''.

Mycolic acids are composed of a longer [[Beta hydroxy acid|beta-hydroxy]] chain with a shorter alpha-[[alkyl]] [[side chain]].  Each molecule contains between 60 and 90 [[carbon]] atoms.  The exact number of carbons varies by species and can be used as an identification aid.  Most mycolic acids also contain various [[functional group]]s.

==Mycolic acids of ''M. tuberculosis''==
[[File:Mycobacterium mycolic acids.svg|thumb|500px|Mycolic acids in ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis.'']]

''[[M. tuberculosis]]'' produces three main types of mycolic acids: alpha-, methoxy-, and keto-.  Alpha-mycolic acids make up at least 70% of the mycolic acids of the organism and contain several [[cyclopropane]] rings.  Methoxy-mycolic acids, which contain several [[methoxy]] groups, constitute between 10% and 15% of the mycolic acids in the organism.  The remaining 10% to 15% of the mycolic acids are keto-mycolic acids, which contain several [[ketone]] groups.

Mycolic acids impart ''M. tuberculosis'' with unique properties that defy medical treatment.  They make the organism more resistant to chemical damage and dehydration, and limit the effectiveness of [[hydrophilic]] [[antibiotic]]s and [[biocides]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lampart|first1=PA|title=Cellular impermeability and uptake of biocides and antibiotics in Gram-positive bacteria and mycobacteria|journal=J Appl Microbiol|date=2002|volume=92|pages=46S-54S|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2672.92.5s1.7.x|pmid=12000612}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mycolic acids also allow the bacterium to grow inside [[macrophage]]s, effectively hiding it from the host [[immune system]]. Mycolate biosynthesis is crucial for survival and pathogenesis of ''M. tuberculosis''. The pathway and enzymes have been elucidated and reported in detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The fatty acid synthase-I and fatty acid synthase-II pathways producing mycolic acids are linked by the [[beta-ketoacyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) synthase III]] enzyme, often designated as mtFabH. Novel inhibitors of this enzyme could potentially be used as therapeutic agents.

The mycolic acids show interesting inflammation controlling properties. A clear tolerogenic response was promoted by natural mycolic acids in experimental [[asthma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The natural extracts are however chemically heterogeneous and inflammatory. By [[organic synthesis]], the different homologues from the natural mixture could be obtained in pure form and tested for biological activity. One subclass proved to be a very good suppressor of asthma, through a totally new mode of action. These compounds are now under further investigation. A second subclass triggered a [[cell (biology)|cell]]ular immune response ([[Th1 cell|Th1]] and [[Th17]]), so studies are ongoing to use this subclass as an [[adjuvant]] for [[vaccination]].

The exact structure of mycolic acids appears to be closely linked to the virulence of the organism, as modification of the functional groups of the molecule can lead to an attenuation of growth ''[[in vivo]]''.  Further, individuals with [[mutation]]s in genes responsible for mycolic acid synthesis exhibit altered cording.

An international multi-centre study has proved that [[delamanid]] (OPC-67683), a new agent derived from the nitro-dihydro-imidazooxazole class of compounds that inhibits mycolic acid synthesis, can increase the rate of sputum [[culture conversion]] in [[multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis]] (MDRTB) at 2 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Mycolic acids of ''Rhodococcus'' sp.==
The mycolic acids of members of the [[genus]] ''[[Rhodococcus]]'', another member of the mycolata taxon, differ in several ways from those of ''M. tuberculosis''.  They contain no functional groups, but instead may have several [[unsaturated compound|unsaturated bonds]].  Two different profiles of ''Rhodococcus'' mycolic acids exist.  The first has between 28 and 46 carbon atoms with either 0 or 1 unsaturated bonds.  The second has between 34 and 54 carbon atoms with between 0 and 4 unsaturated bonds.  Sutcliffe (1998) has proposed that they are linked to the rest of the cell wall by [[arabinogalactan]] molecules.

The '''Myitsone Dam''' ({{lang-my|မြစ်ဆုံ တာတမံ}} {{IPA-my|mjɪʔsʰòʊɴ tàtəmàɴ|}}; {{abbr|lit.|literally}} the '''Confluence Dam''') is a large [[dam]] and [[hydroelectric power]] development project which was planned to be built in [[Myanmar]] (aka Burma).  The proposed construction site is at the confluence of the Mali and N’mai rivers and the source of the [[Irawaddy River]] (Ayeyawady River) in northern [[Burma]].&lt;ref name=R300911&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/09/30/us-myanmar-dam-factbox-idUKTRE78T15S20110930 |title=Factbox: Myanmar suspends controversial Myitsone Dam |date=30 September 2011|work=Reuters |accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is (as of 2017) suspended.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/special-reports/1180397/against-the-flow&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 September 2011, amid [[2011–12 Burmese political reforms|democratic reforms]] in the country, President [[Thein Sein]] announced that the Myitsone dam project was to be suspended during his tenure. Because the government appears to have taken public opinion into account, the unexpected decision is seen as a reversal to the authoritarian rule since the coup in 1962.&lt;ref name="halt"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-15121801 | title=Burma dam: Work halted on divisive Myitsone project | publisher=BBC | date=30 September 2011 | accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Myitkyina-ayeyarwady-d01.jpg|right|thumb|Irawaddy River below the dam site at [[Myitkyina]]]]

The dam site is located {{convert|3.2|km}} below the confluence of the [[Mali River]] and the [[N'Mai River]] about {{convert|42|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Myitkyina]], the capital of [[Kachin State]], in northern Burma.&lt;ref name="International Rivers"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.internationalrivers.org/en/southeast-asia/burma/myitsone-dam|title=Irrawaddy Myitsone Dam|work=Burma|publisher=International Rivers |accessdate=4 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The source of both the N'mai and Mali Rivers is the [[Himalaya#Glaciers and river systems|Himalaya glaciers]] of northern Burma in the vicinity of 28° N. The easternmost of the two, N'mai river, is the larger stream and rises in the Languela Glacier north of [[Putao]]. It is unnavigable because of the strong current whereas the smaller western river, the Mali, is navigable, despite a few [[rapids]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=koacGt0fhUoC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=main+source+irrawaddy+river James R Penn (2001) Rivers of the World].

The project location is in the politically unstable Kachin State. Since 1962, the [[Kachin Independence Army]] (KIA) has been waging war against Burmese military. Despite ceasefire in 1994, clashes and bomb explosions occasionally occur near the dam site. In 2011, clashes between Burmese military and KIA intensified and the Burmese military ordered airstrikes in Northern Kachin State.&lt;ref name="Yun"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/SEA-01-190214.html | title=China, Myanmar face Myitsone dam truths | publisher=Asia Times | accessdate=31 March 2014 | author=Yun Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Myitsone Dam is part of the Confluence Region Hydropower Project (CRHP), which includes seven dams with a total installed capacity of 20,000 MW. CRHP alone accounts for 41 percent of the total power capacity called for by a 30-year strategic plan. Outlined in 2001, the plan includes 64 hydropower plants and three coal power plants with combined installed capacity of more than {{convert|40000|MW}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mmtimes.com/2011/news/595/news59501.html | title=President halts dam | publisher=MM times | accessdate=October 8, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006061636/http://mmtimes.com/2011/news/595/news59501.html | archivedate=October 6, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Myanmar Electrical Power Enterprise and the Agriculture and Irrigation Ministry scheduled the ''Irawaddy Myitsone Dam Multipurpose Water Utilization Project'' in 2001. The survey phase was initiated in 2003. First the government contracted the Japanese [[Kansai Electric Power Company]] to build a small [[weather station]] at Tang Hpre village, near the confluence. Chinese and Burmese contractors, including  Yunnan Machinery Equipment Import &amp; Export Company (YMEC), Kunming Hydropower Institute of Design, surveyed the dam site. In 2006, Suntac Technologies Co. Ltd., a Burmese [[Geographic Information System]] (GIS) mapping contractor set up an office at the monastery in Tang Hpre village. They also set up a temporary camp at Washawng village to facilitate transport of survey equipment from the YMEC company in China. In October, the Asia World Company built a project implementation camp on a hill top at the dam site {{convert|3|mi}} downstream from the confluence. when the camp was complete, Chinese inspectors stayed and surveyed the area for five months. In December 2006, the Ministry of Electric Power No. 1 and the China Power Investment Corporation signed a Memorandum of Understanding for a {{convert|6000|MW}} project at Myitsone and a {{convert|3400|MW}} project at Chibwe.

The design phase began in 2007. The Changjiang Design Institute of China sent several groups of design personnel and conducted geological drilling, reservoir inspection and hydrological measuring near the dam site. To supply electricity for dam construction projects, a small {{convert|99|MW}}, Chibwe Nge hydropower project was built in April 2007. In May, the ''New Light of Myanmar'' reported that the Ministry of Power No. 1 and CPI would build seven hydropower dams on the N'Mai and Irawaddy rivers.

On 16 June 2009, Myanmar Ambassador Thein Lwin and President of China Power Investment Corporation Lu Qizhou signed a Memorandum of Agreement between the Department of Hydropower Implementation and the China Power Investment Corporation for the Development, Operation and Transfer of the hydropower Projects in Maykha, Malikha and Upstream of Irrawaddy-Myitsone River Basins.&lt;ref name="MOU"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.burmariversnetwork.org/news/news-archives/202-memorandum-of-agreement-on-nmaimaliirrawaddy-dams-signed.html |title=Memorandum of Agreement on N’Mai/Mali/Irrawaddy Dams Signed	|date=2009-06-21|work=Excerpts from ''New Light of Myanmar''|publisher=Burma Rivers Network |accessdate=16 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official opening ceremony of the dam construction phase was held on December 21.&lt;ref name="bni"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bnionline.net/news/kng/7775-exiled-kachins-urge-china-to-stop-irrawaddy-myitsone-dam-project-.html|title=Exiled Kachins urge China to stop Irrawaddy Myitsone dam project|last=Kachin News Group|date=2010-01-27|publisher=Burma News International|accessdate=3 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616045632/http://bnionline.net/news/kng/7775-exiled-kachins-urge-china-to-stop-irrawaddy-myitsone-dam-project-.html|archivedate=16 June 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Resisting"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/22702866/Resisting-theFlood|title=Resisting the Flood|date=October 2009 |publisher=Kachin Development Networking Group |pages=12, 13|accessdate=5 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Burmese government would earn about $54 billion by means of tax payment, power and shares, accounting for 60 percent of the total revenue of the Irrawaddy projects during the contracted 50 years, more than CPI's return on investment during the fifty years Chinese operation period according to the President of CPI.&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irrawaddy.org/business/cpis-social-responsibility-report-slammed-propaganda.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, the government economic calculations have been criticized for not considering potential environmental and societal impacts.

==Design==
[[File:Computerised drawing of Myitsone dam project by the Chinese Embassy Myanmar.png|thumb|right|Computerised drawing of Myitsone]]
The dam was planned to be a [[Dam#Rock-fill dams|concrete faced rock-fill dam]] {{convert|139.6|m}} high and {{convert|1310|m}} long, and projected to produce 6,000 MW of electricity by 2017.&lt;ref name="Min"/&gt; This is equivalent to 27% of the {{convert|22500|MW}} output of the [[Three Gorges Dam]] In China, the world's largest electricity-generating plant of any kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.industcards.com/top-100-pt-4.htm |title=top-100-pt-4 |publisher=Industcards.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090718062042/http://www.industcards.com/top%2D100%2Dpt%2D4.htm |archivedate=2009-07-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minister of Electric Power Zaw Min claimed that the dam was designed to withstand an earthquake of 8.0 [[Richter Scale]], a scale that has never been recorded to have occurred in that region, and the most devastating flood of a millennium.&lt;ref name="reviewed"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eversion.news-eleven.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1466:myitsone-hydropower-project-to-be-reviewed-report&amp;catid=42:weekly-eleven-eversion&amp;Itemid=109 | title=Myitsone Hydropower Project to be reviewed: Report | publisher=Eleven | accessdate=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Power generation==
The Myitsone Dam is the largest of the seven large dams currently planned on the Mali, N'Mai and Irawaddy rivers. The [[China Power Investment Corporation]] is project manager of the Confluence Region Hydropower Projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myanmar-information.net/infosheet/2006/070507.htm SupervisoryOffice of Confluence Region Hydropower Project Opened] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501034219/http://www.myanmar-information.net/infosheet/2006/070507.htm |date=2011-05-01 }} on the [http://www.myanmar-information.net/ Myanmar Information Website] May 7, 2007. Paragraph 4. Retrieved d.d. September 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The seven dams combined total design installed capacity is 20,000 [[Watt#Megawatt|MW]] of electricity.

The dam is to provide electricity primarily to the [[China Southern Power Grid]] via its subsidiary, the Yunnan Power Grid Company, in [[Yunnan|Yunnan Province]] and then on to the power hungry eastern coastal areas of [[China]], in conformity with the Chinese central Government's 'West to East Transmission Policy'.&lt;ref name="Min"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staff, KEO, Execuative Summary&lt;/ref&gt; The hydropower project was being implemented under an agreement signed in late 2006 with the state-owned [[China Power Investment Corporation]] and Burma’s Ministry of Electric Power No 1.  The dam and reservoir planning and construction is managed by the Burmese government in cooperation with the China Southern Power Grid and several subcontractors.&lt;ref name="Naing"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=10064|title=Irrawaddy Dam Construction Begins, Human Rights Abuses Begin|last=Naing|first=Saw Yan|date=2010-02-15|work=The Irrawaddy / News|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|accessdate=15 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106124049/http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=10064|archivedate=6 January 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dam would also supply ten percent of its generated electricity to the Myanmar Power Grid if needed.&lt;ref name=Yun/&gt; The Chipwi Nge Hydropower Project, which was installed to provide electricity for construction projects, began supplying electricity to [[Myitkyina]], [[Chipwi Township|Chipwi]], and the Myitsone Resettlement Village. However, few villagers have electrical devices. "We don’t need to buy candles, this is the only useful thing" a villager told. They prefer to have their productive land back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kachinnews.com/news/2613-chinese-firm-claims-myitsone-restart-will-be-transparent.html | title=Chinese firm claims Myitsone restart will be transparent | publisher=Kachin News | date=27 December 2013 | accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social impact==
[[File:Relocated village Tang Hpre.jpg|thumb|right|One of the relocated villages]]
[[File:New concrete road and electricity supply for Tang Hpre village.jpg|thumb|right|Tang Hpre village, after relocation, supplied with electricity and new concrete roads.]]
The dam was expected to flood {{convert|447|km2}} including 47 villages near the construction site and about 11800 local people would be relocated in the newly built resettlement villages. The activists in exile stated that the dam would submerge historical  temples, churches and cultural heritage sites important to Kachin identity and history and the natural heritage of the Kachin people in Myitsone area would be lost.&lt;ref name="Naing"/&gt;

In response, the government reported in the state-run ''[[New Light of Myanmar]]'' that relocated villages from the project area had been provided with all forms of aids including water, electric power and buildings and that the government also helped in relocation of religious buildings.&lt;ref name=gov&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.myanmar.com/newspaper/nlm/Jan25_01.html | title=In future, large hydropower projects must be implemented successfully with domestic industrial products, national experts and national skilled workers only | publisher=New Light of Myanmar | date=22 January 2001 | accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; CPI reported a total expense of 4.1 billion kyats in compensation and 25 million U.S. dollars in resettlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.uachc.com/Liems/esite/content/showDetail.jsp?nid=6859&amp;newtype_no=2248 | title=Resettlement work | publisher=China Power Investment | accessdate=October 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the government stated that the remote region would benefit greatly from the new roads and access to electricity.&lt;ref name=gov/&gt;

Local communities pointed out other issues such as the dam's location on earthquake-prone zone. They opposed the dam site because it is less than {{convert|100|km}} from the major [[Mandalay#Location|Sagaing fault line]], posing a risk to basin inhabitants if an [[earthquake]] weakened the dam or caused landslides in the reservoir. If the Irrawaddy Myitsone Dam broke during an earthquake, it would endanger the lives of hundred of thousands of people downstream in Kachin State’s largest city, Myikyina.&lt;ref name="Why halted"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/world-asia-pacific-15123833 | title=Burma dam: Why Myitsone plan is being halted | publisher=BBC | date=August 31, 2011 | accessdate=August 31, 2011 | author=Rachel Harvey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, the government said that the dam would withstand an earthquake of magnitude 8.0 Richter scale. In an interview with [[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua News]], Lu Qizhou, President of China Power Investment Corporation said that Myitsone Hydropower Station follows the standard of fortification intensity 9, two points above the intensity of Zipingbu Hydropower Station that withstood [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]] of 8.0 Richter scale.&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2011-10/04/content_13836037.htm | title=Myitsone Hydropower Project mutually beneficial | publisher=Xinhua News | date=October 4, 2011 | accessdate=October 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Burmese scientists who carried out the environmental assessment, recommended to build two smaller dams farther upstream instead of building on earthquake-prone zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/22/world/asia/controversy-over-dam-fuels-rare-public-outcry-in-myanmar.html?pagewanted=all | title=Controversy Over Dam Fuels Rare Public Outcry in Myanmar | publisher=New York Times | date=September 21, 2011 | accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental impact==
[[File:Wildlife in Tang Hpre village near Myitsone Dam project area.jpg|thumb|right|Livestock near the project area. The area is expected to flood after the dam completion]] 
As with other large dam projects, the Myitsone Dam construction would have altered the [[hydrology|hydrological]] characteristics of the river and prevent [[sediment]] from enriching the historically highly productive agricultural floodplains downstream.&lt;ref&gt;William L. Graf (1999) [http://www.fiu.edu/~envstud/courses/evr5320/Graf_1999.pdf'' Dam nation: A geographic census of American dams and their large-scale hydrologic impacts ''] page 5, published Water Resources Research, Vol. 35, No. 4, pages 1305–1311, April 1999&lt;/ref&gt; This can affect fertility as far downstream as the [[Irrawaddy Delta]], the major rice-producing area of [[Burma|Myanmar]]. The government responded that officials had taken sediment accumulation into consideration, and that the Myitsone dam would have capabilities to discharge the accumulated sediment.

Other consequences of flooding by the reservoir include loss of farmland and loss of spawning habitat as some migratory fish will be able to swim upstream after dam completion. This would lead to lost income for fishermen according to Kachin environmental activist groups in exile.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, KEO, p 23&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, research by Biodiversity And Nature Conservation Association (BANCA) contradicts the activists' statement. BANCA's research asserts that commercial fishing is not reported from the project area. But it confirms that some resident aquatic species will be affected by the change in hydrological conditions.&lt;ref&gt;EIA report, pp 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecological concerns focus on the [[inundation]] of an area that is the border of the Indo-Burma and South Central China [[biodiversity hotspot]]. The Mali and N'mai River confluence region falls within the Mizoram-Manipur-Kachin [[rainforest]]s. Nevertheless, the dam would increase the shipping capacity of [[Irrawaddy river|Irrawaddy River]].&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Myitsone Hydropower Project mutually beneficial{{!}}Politics{{!}}chinadaily.com.cn|url = http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2011-10/04/content_13836037.htm|website = www.chinadaily.com.cn|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The floods, currently an annual occurrence, would only occur once every twenty years. Since the hydropower is the renewable and green energy, the energy produced by the dam would decrease the need for air-polluting sources of energy such as [[fossil fuel]]s. The construction and the maintenance of the dam would have employed a large number of people.&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt;

==Opposition==
[[File:Aung San Suu Kyi on Hot news front page.jpg|thumb|right|News reports such as Aung San Suu Kyi's campaign against the Myitsone Dam are not censored]]
In Burma, the Irrawaddy river, on the bank of which major historic cities such as [[Bagan]] were built, is considered as the birthplace of Burmese civilization. For that reason, The Burmese public protests against the dam project, which would inevitably alter hydrological characteristics of the historic river. Moreover, the growing Chinese influence in Burma is seen as exploitative by Burmese people, due to its association with previous military junta.&lt;ref name=Yun/&gt;

On the other hand, local villages have opposed the project since its proposal in 2001. According to the environmental organization ''International Rivers'' based in the US, in 2007, 12 local leaders from [[Kachin State]] sent a letter to Senior [[General Than Shwe]] and the junta’s Ministry of Electric Power, asking for the project to be cancelled.&lt;ref name="International Rivers"/&gt; The Burma Rivers Network also sent a letter to the Chinese government asking Chinese companies operating in Burma to conduct [[Environmental impact assessment|environmental]] and [[social impact assessment]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, to release information publicly, and to consider opinions of affected communities in the decision-making process.&lt;ref name="Naing"/&gt; In a parliamentary session, government minister Zaw Min responded that environmental impact had been carried out by the Biodiversity And Nature Conservation Association (BANCA) at a cost of $1.25 million and stated that Myitsone Dam Project was started only when the government had studied the possible environmental impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eversion.news-eleven.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1449:myitsone-dam-project-will-not-be-discarded-anyhow-despite-objections-from-any-sources-electric-power-minister&amp;catid=42:weekly-eleven-eversion&amp;Itemid=109 | title=Myitsone Hydropower Project will not be discarded anyhow despite objections from any sources: Electric Power Minister | publisher=Eleven Media Group | accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the results of BANCA's assessment were not disclosed publicly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eversion.news-eleven.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1449:myitsone-dam-project-will-not-be-discarded-anyhow-despite-objections-from-any-sources-electric-power-minister&amp;catid=42:weekly-eleven-eversion&amp;Itemid=109 | title=BANCA Chairman advocates transparency on EIA report | publisher=Eleven Media Group | accessdate=August 31, 2011 | author=Hein Min Latt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside Burma, activists in exile have actively carried out protests in various countries. In February 2010, the UK-based Kachin National Organization (KNO) protested against construction of the dam in front of the Burmese Embassies in the UK, Japan, Australia, and the United States.&lt;ref name="bni"/&gt; Leaked [[United States diplomatic cables leak|United States diplomatic cable]]s by [[Wikileak]] revealed that U.S. embassy in Yangon funded some of the activist groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/30/us-embassy-cables-burma-myitsone-dam | title=US embassy cables: how Rangoon office helped opponents of Myitsone dam | publisher=Gurdians | work=United States government | accessdate=October 2, 2011 | author=Wikileak | location=London | date=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TG&gt;{{cite news|title=WikiLeaks cables: Americans funded groups that stalled Burma dam project |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/30/us-embassy-cables-burma-myitsone-dam |accessdate=1 November 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the country an activist has been detained for what local authorities said were unrelated charges. Land rights activist and politician [[Daw Bauk Ja]] was arrested for [[medical negligence]] in 2013, though the case against her had been withdrawn years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kachin activist Daw Bauk Ja arrested over 2008 death |url=http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/national-news/7573-kachin-activist-daw-bauk-ja-arrested-over-2008-death.html |accessdate=7 November 2013|newspaper=Myanmar Times|date=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skirmishes have been broken out between [[Kachin Independence Army]] and Burmese military over the dam issue since June 2011.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/09/30/idINIndia-59646920110930 | title=Myanmar govt shelves $3.6 bln mega dam – officials | publisher=Reuters | accessdate=October 2, 2011 | date=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 17, 2010, three bombs exploded close to the site of dam, reportedly killing four Chinese workers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dvb.no/news/kachin-dam-bombing-kills-four/8640&lt;/ref&gt; The Burmese government blamed Kachin Independence Army for planting the bombs. KIA has denied having anything to do with the Myitsone bombing.

Domestic campaigns against the project are brought together by political activists including [[Nobel peace prize]] laureate [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] who called for reevaluation, conservationists, scholars, poets and journalists.&lt;ref name="why halted"/&gt; Local media openly criticized the lack of transparency in dam project. Journalists argued that the deal was agreed by [[State Peace and Development Council|previous government]] without considering public opinions.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;

Despite the opposition, Minister Zaw Min for the Ministry of Electric Power responded to the press that the government would continue this project up to the completion.&lt;ref name="U Zaw Min"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eversion.news-eleven.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1449:myitsone-dam-project-will-not-be-discarded-anyhow-despite-objections-from-any-sources-electric-power-minister&amp;catid=42:weekly-eleven-eversion&amp;Itemid=109 | title=Myitsone Hydropower Project will not be discarded anyhow despite objections from any sources: Electric Power Minister | publisher=Eleven Media Group | work=Aung Khin | date=11 September 2011 | accessdate=September 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, in September 2011 he conceded that despite promised benefits from the project, it may be appropriate to minimize the environmental impacts by redesigning the tunnel, shortening the dam's height and reducing the water storage capacity, relocating to the upstream, and reassessing environmental impacts. He also agreed that final decision should depend on the environment impact assessment report by the Ministry of Environmental Conservation and Forestry and the study by the Engineer Group.&lt;ref name="reviewed"/&gt;

==Suspension==
On 30 September 2011, in an address to the parliament, Burma's president [[Thein Sein]] announced that the Myitsone Dam project would be halted during the term of his government.&lt;ref name="halt" /&gt; The letter from the president consisted of ten points including,

{{quote|As our government is elected by the people, it is to respect the people’s will. We have the responsibility to address public concerns in all seriousness. So construction of Myitsone Dam will be suspended in the time of our government. Other hydropower projects that pose no threat will be implemented through thorough survey for availability of electricity needed for the nation.

In response, [[Chinese Foreign Ministry]] spokesman Hong Lei stated that the Chinese government has urged the Burmese government to protect the legal and legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iOZ3WITtW9CP0wdt0nLUHyHK1N0A?docId=caea755eb6f8488bb6e842edbd4df2f1 | title=China wants talks after Myanmar halts dam project | publisher=AP | accessdate=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reminded that the Myitsone Dam is a jointly invested project between China and Myanmar, and one that has been thoroughly examined by both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/01/us-china-myanmar-dam-idUSTRE7900N120111001 | title=China calls for talks over shelved Myanmar dam | publisher=Reuters | date=Oct 1, 2011&lt;!-- 7:19am EDT --&gt;| accessdate=October 1, 2011 | author=Ben Blanchard}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also confirmed that the matters would be resolved through friendly consultation.&lt;ref name="Hong Lei"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mfa.gov.cn/chn/gxh/tyb/fyrbt/t864634.htm | title=A reporter asked  Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei | publisher=Government of China | accessdate=September 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president of CPI, Lu Qizhou, has warned that a halt in construction could lead to legal action.&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt;

In October 2011, Myanmar Foreign Minister traveled to Beijing to settle the dispute.

Although the President Thein Sein's decision has been widely applauded, experts caution that Sino-Burma relation could be ultimately harmed by the suspension. Nicholas Farrelly, a Southeast Asia specialist at the [[Australian National University]] in [[Canberra]] said that while there would inevitably be some short-term damage to bilateral relations, pragmatism would override any potential for long-term animosity.&lt;ref name=travel&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mmtimes.com/2011/news/597/news59707.html | title=China, Myanmar close in on agreement to settle dispute over Myitsone suspension | publisher=MM Times | accessdate=November 13, 2011 | author=San Oo | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119030521/http://www.mmtimes.com/2011/news/597/news59707.html | archivedate=November 19, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue is further exacerbated by the massacre of 13 Chinese sailors near Burma-Thailand border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/30/us-china-myanmar-idUSTRE79T0K420111030 | title=Myanmar reassures China after dam blocked, sailors killed | publisher=Reuters | accessdate=November 13, 2011 | first=Ben | last=Blanchard | date=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, should the project be terminated entirely, the Burmese government would face legal and financial liability associated with the investments and prior agreements.&lt;ref name=Yun/&gt;

Internationally, the suspension is considered as one of the [[Reforms in Burma|democratic reforms]] along with other engagements such as dialogues with pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and release of some political prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.todayonline.com/Commentary/EDC111018-0000150/Major-steps-in-Myanmars-transformation | title=Major steps in Myanmar's transformation | publisher=Today | accessdate=November 13, 2011 | author=Thaung Tun}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marie Lall, a BBC South Asia analyst attributes Burma's bid for the ASEAN chair in 2014, the needs to reform the economy for [[ASEAN Free Trade Area]] and the government's desire to win the election in 2015 as the main motives of the reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-15560414 | title=Viewpoint: Has a year of civilian rule changed Burma? | publisher=BBC | date=7 November 2011 | accessdate=November 13, 2011 | author=Marie Lall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Renaissance Wax''' is a brand of [[microcrystalline wax]] [[Polishing|polish]] that is encountered in [[Antiques restoration|antique restoration]] and museum conservation. It is not appropriate for all materials, and is most safely used on metal objects. However, it is also used for the polish and conservation of gemstones and of organic materials such as wood, ivory, and tortoiseshell. Renaissance Wax is sometimes used by reenactors of historic swordsmanship to protect armor and weapons. Waxes are more protective and longer-lasting than oil, especially for swords and helmets that are frequently touched by human hands.&lt;ref name="Chinese Swords" &gt;{{cite web
  |title=Chinese Swords Guide: Restoration 
  |url=http://www.chinese-swords-guide.com/renaissance-wax.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has recently been introduced in the world of guitar building, as a finish that protects and gives colour to the wood. {{cn|date=November 2016}}

Wax coatings for conservation are most widely, and least controversially, applied to metals. This has several objectives: to produce a barrier that excludes moisture and oxygen from the metal surface, to preclude the introduction of contaminating elements by handling, and to provide a protective layer over [[anti-corrosion]] undercoatings. 

Microcrystalline waxes used on ethnographic metal objects are discouraged, as they may require extensive treatment for removal.&lt;ref name=Moffett&gt;{{cite journal
  |title=Wax Coatings on Ethnographic Metal Objects: Justifications for Allowing a Tradition to Wane

  |author=Moffett, Dana L.
  |doi=10.2307/3179934 
  |jstor=3179934
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
The wax is evenly and lightly applied over the surface, then lightly buffed with a smooth lint-free cloth to give a sheen. Where the shape of the item requires, a brush may be used instead.  It is also used in jewelry making to preserve the patina of the metal. 

===Application over other coatings===
For retarding further [[red rot]] in leather bookbindings, it is common to first consolidate the leather by application of Klucel G or a similar material and then apply a protective coating of a microcrystalline wax. When Renaissance Wax is used for this protective coating, it can create a white residue if applied too heavily. This white residue cannot be removed. Use of a different wax, such as SC6000, is recommended for leather. 

Renaissance Wax is also commonly used in the preservation of bronze and copper coins. The wax seals the coins and helps prevent deterioration from moisture and air exposure. It may also help prevent the onset of the chloride-related corrosion commonly called [[bronze disease]], although it won't arrest this once started.

Conservation of metals may also involve the application of an undercoat such as Incralac followed by the application of Renaissance Wax.

==Formulation==
Renaissance Wax was developed in the British Museum Research Laboratory by Dr A E A Werner&lt;ref&gt;Who's Who, 1998, p. 2099&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 1950s. It is now manufactured by Picreator Enterprises Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |url=http://www.renaissancewaxes.com/
  |title=Renaissance Wax
  |publisher=Picreator Enterprises Ltd. (Manufacturer)
  |accessdate=2007-04-27
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier wax polishes based on [[beeswax]] and [[carnauba wax]] either contained acids or became acidic over time. Renaissance Wax is based on more stable [[microcrystalline wax]]es refined from [[crude oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  |last=Horie |first=C V
  |publisher=Elsevier Science and Technology
  |isbn=0-7506-0881-1
  |year=1996
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renaissance Wax contains polyethylene waxes. Some other microcrystalline waxes intended for conservation use  do not contain these.

==Controversy over its use==
Wax coatings, in general, may accumulate dust and lint. 

In one example where a [[Benin art|Benin bust]] made from a copper-iron alloy had been coated with multiple materials including this wax, the polyethylene component required a higher-temperature solvent for removal than the rest of the wax.&lt;ref name = Moffett /&gt;

'''Sandstone''' is a [[clastic sedimentary rock]] composed mainly of [[grain size|sand-sized]] (0.0625 to 2 mm) [[mineral]] particles or [[rock fragment]]s.

Most sandstone is composed of [[quartz]] or [[feldspar]] (both [[Silicate|silicates]]) because they are the most resistant minerals to [[weathering]] processes at the Earth's surface, as seen in [[Bowen's reaction series]]. Like uncemented [[sand]], sandstone may be any color due to impurities within the minerals, but the most common colors are tan, brown, yellow, red, grey, pink, white, and black. Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other [[topography|topographic]] features, certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions.

Rock formations that are primarily composed of sandstone usually allow the [[percolation]] of water and other fluids and are [[porosity|porous]] enough to store large quantities, making them valuable [[aquifer]]s and [[petroleum reservoir]]s. Fine-grained aquifers, such as sandstones, are better able to filter out pollutants from the surface than are rocks with cracks and crevices, such as [[limestone]] or other rocks fractured by [[earthquake|seismic activity]].

Quartz-bearing sandstone can be changed into [[quartzite]] through [[metamorphism]], usually related to tectonic compression within [[orogenic belts]].

== Origins ==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2014}}
[[File:CoralPinkSandDunesSand.JPG|thumb|right|Sand from [[Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park]], [[Utah]]. These are grains of [[quartz]] with a [[hematite]] coating providing the orange colour. Scale bar is 1.0 mm.]]

Sandstones are ''[[clastic rock|clastic]]'' in origin (as opposed to either ''organic'', like [[chalk]] and [[coal]], or ''chemical'', like [[gypsum]] and [[jasper]]).&lt;ref name="LF"&gt;"A Basic Sedimentary Rock Classification", L.S. Fichter, Department of Geology/Environmental Science, [[James Madison University]] (JMU), Harrisonburg, Virginia, October 2000, [http://csmres.jmu.edu/geollab/fichter/SedRx/sedclass.html JMU-sed-classif] (accessed: March 2009): separates clastic, chemical &amp; biochemical (organic).&lt;/ref&gt;
They are formed from [[cementation (geology)|cemented]] grains that may either be fragments of a pre-existing rock or be mono-minerallic [[crystal]]s. The cements binding these grains together are typically [[calcite]], [[clay]]s, and [[silica]]. [[particle size (grain size)|Grain sizes]] in sands are defined (in geology) within the range of 0.0625&amp;nbsp;mm to 2&amp;nbsp;mm (0.0025–0.08&amp;nbsp;inches). Clays and sediments with smaller grain sizes not visible with the naked eye, including [[siltstone]]s and [[shale]]s, are typically called ''[[argillaceous minerals|argillaceous]]'' sediments; rocks with larger grain sizes, including [[breccia]]s and [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]], are termed ''rudaceous'' sediments.
[[File:Lower antelope 2 md.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Red sandstone interior of [[Antelope Canyon|Lower Antelope Canyon]], [[Arizona]], worn smooth by erosion from [[flash flood]]ing over thousands of years.]]
[[File:Tafoni at Twyfelfontein (Namibia).jpg|thumb|240px|[[Tafoni]] at [[Twyfelfontein]] in [[Namibia]]]]
The formation of sandstone involves two principal stages. First, a layer or layers of sand accumulates as the result of [[sedimentation]], either from water (as in a stream, lake, or sea) or from air (as in a desert). Typically, sedimentation occurs by the sand settling out from suspension; i.e., ceasing to be rolled or bounced along the bottom of a body of water or ground surface (e.g., in a desert or [[erg (landform)|erg]]). Finally, once it has accumulated, the sand becomes sandstone when it is [[compaction (geology)|compacted]] by the pressure of overlying deposits and cemented by the precipitation of minerals within the pore spaces between sand grains.

The most common cementing materials are silica and [[calcium carbonate]], which are often derived either from dissolution or from alteration of the sand after it was buried. Colors will usually be tan or yellow (from a blend of the clear quartz with the dark amber feldspar content of the sand). A predominant additional colourant in the southwestern United States is [[iron oxide]], which imparts reddish tints ranging from pink to dark red ([[terracotta]]), with additional [[manganese]] imparting a purplish [[hue]]. Red sandstones are also seen in the Southwest and West of [[United Kingdom|Britain]], as well as central [[Europe]] and [[Mongolia]]. The regularity of the latter favours use as a source for [[masonry]], either as a primary building material or as a facing stone, over other forms of construction.

The environment where it is deposited is crucial in determining the characteristics of the resulting sandstone, which, in finer detail, include its grain size, sorting, and composition and, in more general detail, include the rock geometry and sedimentary structures. Principal [[sedimentary depositional environment|environments of deposition]] may be split between terrestrial and marine, as illustrated by the following broad groupings:
* Terrestrial environments
# [[River]]s ([[levee]]s, point bars, channel sands)
# [[Alluvial fan]]s
# [[Glacial outwash]]
# [[Lake]]s
# [[Deserts]] ([[sand dune]]s and [[erg (landform)|ergs]])
* Marine environments
# [[River delta|Deltas]]
# [[Beach]] and shoreface sands
# [[Tidal flat]]s
# Offshore bars and [[sand waves]]
# Storm deposits (tempestites)
# [[Turbidite]]s (submarine channels and fans)

==Components==

===Framework grains===
[[File:(1)Saunders Quarry-1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Paradise Quarry, [[Sydney]], Australia]]
[[File:GrusSand.JPG|thumb|left|[[grus (geology)|Grus]] sand and the granitoid from which it is derived]]
Framework grains are sand-sized ({{convert|0.0625|to|2|mm|in|adj=on}} diameter) detrital fragments that make up the bulk of a sandstone.&lt;ref name="Stow"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dorrik A. V. Stow|title=Sedimentary Rocks in the Field: A Colour Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CRfXEf0Q9q8C|accessdate=11 May 2012|year=2005|publisher=Manson Publishing|isbn=978-1-874545-69-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pettijohn"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Francis John Pettijohn|author2=Paul Edwin Potter|author3=Raymond Siever|title=Sand and Sandstone|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QnpYqGksckwC|accessdate=11 May 2012|year=1987|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-96350-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These grains can be classified into several different categories based on their mineral composition:
* Quartz framework grains are the dominant minerals in most [[clastic sedimentary rock]]s; this is because they have exceptional physical properties, such as hardness and chemical stability.&lt;ref name="Boggs"&gt;Boggs, J.R., 2000, ''Principles of sedimentology and stratigraphy'', 3rd ed. Toronto: Merril Publishing Company. {{ISBN|0-13-099696-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These physical properties allow the quartz grains to survive multiple recycling events, while also allowing the grains to display some degree of rounding.&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt; Quartz grains evolve from plutonic rock, which are felsic in origin and also from older sandstones that have been recycled.
* Feldspathic framework grains are commonly the second most abundant mineral in sandstones.&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt; Feldspar can be divided into two smaller subdivisions: alkali feldspars and plagioclase feldspars. The different types of feldspar can be distinguished under a petrographic microscope.&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt; Below is a description of the different types of feldspar.

::*[[Alkali feldspar]] is a group of minerals in which the chemical composition of the mineral can range from KAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; to NaAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, this represents a complete solid solution.&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt;

::*[[Plagioclase feldspar]] is a complex group of solid solution minerals that range in composition from NaAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; to CaAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt;
[[File:LvMS-Lvm.jpg|thumb|Photomicrograph of a [[volcanic]] [[sand grain]]; upper picture is plane-polarised light, bottom picture is cross-polarised light, scale box at left-centre is 0.25 millimetre. This type of grain would be a main component of a lithic sandstone.]]
* Lithic framework grains are pieces of ancient source rock that have yet to weather away to individual mineral grains, called lithic fragments or clasts.&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt; Lithic fragments can be any fine-grained or coarse-grained igneous, metamorphic, or sedimentary rock,&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt; although the most common lithic fragments found in sedimentary rocks are clasts of volcanic rocks.&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt;
* Accessory minerals are all other mineral grains in a sandstone; commonly these minerals make up just a small percentage of the grains in a sandstone. Common accessory minerals include micas ([[muscovite]] and [[biotite]]), [[olivine]], [[pyroxene]], and [[corundum]].&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prothero"&gt;Prothero, D. (2004). Sedimentary Geology. New York, NN: W.H. Freeman and Company&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these accessory grains are more dense than the silicates that make up the bulk of the rock. These '''heavy minerals''' are commonly resistant to weathering and can be used as an indicator of sandstone maturity through the [[ZTR index]].&lt;ref&gt;Prothero, D. R. and Schwab, F., 1996, Sedimentary Geology, p. 460, {{ISBN|0-7167-2726-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common heavy minerals include [[zircon]], [[tourmaline]], [[rutile]] (hence ''ZTR''), [[garnet]], [[magnetite]], or other dense, resistant minerals derived from the source rock.

===Matrix===
[[Matrix (geology)|Matrix]] is very fine material, which is present within interstitial pore space between the framework grains.&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt; The interstitial pore space can be classified into two varieties. One is to call the sandstone an arenite, and the other is to call it a wacke. Below is a definition of the differences between the two matrices:
* Arenites are texturally ''clean'' sandstones that are free of or have very little matrix.&lt;ref name="Prothero"/&gt;
* Wackes are texturally ''dirty'' sandstones that have a significant amount of matrix.&lt;ref name="Pettijohn"/&gt;

===Cement===
Cement is what binds the siliciclastic framework grains together. Cement is a secondary mineral that forms after deposition and during burial of the sandstone.&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt; These cementing materials may be either silicate minerals or non-silicate minerals, such as calcite.&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt;
* Silica cement can consist of either quartz or [[opal]] minerals. Quartz is the most common silicate mineral that acts as cement. In sandstone where there is silica cement present, the quartz grains are attached to cement, which creates a rim around the quartz grain called overgrowth. The overgrowth retains the same crystallographic continuity of quartz framework grain that is being cemented. Opal cement is found in sandstones that are rich in volcanogenic materials, and very rarely is in other sandstones.&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt;
* Calcite cement is the most common carbonate cement. Calcite cement is an assortment of smaller calcite crystals. The cement adheres itself to the framework grains, this adhesion is what causes the framework grains to be adhered together.&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt;
* Other minerals that act as cements include: [[hematite]], [[limonite]], [[feldspar]]s, [[anhydrite]], [[gypsum]], [[barite]], [[clay minerals]], and [[zeolite]] minerals.&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt;

===Pore space===
Pore space includes the open spaces within a rock or a soil.&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;Jackson, J. (1997). Glossary of Geology. Alexandria, VA: American Geological Institute {{ISBN|3-540-27951-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pore space in a rock has a direct relationship to the [[porosity]] and [[permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] of the rock. The porosity and permeability are directly influenced by the way the sand grains are packed together.&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt;
* Porosity is the percentage of bulk volume that is inhabited by interstices within a given rock.&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt; Porosity is directly influenced by the packing of even-sized spherical grains, rearranged from loosely packed to tightest packed in sandstones.&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt;
* Permeability is the rate in which water or other fluids flow through the rock. For [[groundwater]], work permeability may be measured in gallons per day through a one square foot cross section under a unit [[hydraulic gradient]].&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt;

== Types of sandstone ==

[[File:Logan Formation Cross Bedding Scour.jpg|thumb|Cross-bedding and scour in sandstone of the [[Logan Formation]] ([[Lower Carboniferous]]) of Jackson County, [[Ohio]]]]

All sandstones are composed of the same general minerals. These minerals make up the framework components of the sandstones. Such components are quartz, feldspars,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://geology.com/rocks/sandstone.shtml|title=Sandstone: Sedimentary Rock - Pictures, Definition &amp; More|website=geology.com|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lithic fragments. Matrix may also be present in the interstitial spaces between the framework grains.&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt; Below is a list of several major groups of sandstones. These groups are divided based on [[mineralogy]] and texture. Even though sandstones have very simple compositions which are based on framework grains, geologists have not been able to agree on a specific, right way, to classify sandstones.&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt; Sandstone classifications are typically done by point-counting a [[thin section]] using a method like the [[Gazzi-Dickinson Method]]. The composition of a sandstone can have important information regarding the genesis of the sediment when used with a triangular ''Q''uartz, ''F''eldspar, ''L''ithic fragment ([[QFL diagrams]]). Many geologists, however, do not agree on how to separate the triangle parts into the single components so that the framework grains can be plotted.&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt; Therefore, there have been many published ways to classify sandstones, all of which are similar in their general format.

Visual aids are diagrams that allow geologists to interpret different characteristics about a sandstone. The following QFL chart and the sandstone provenance model correspond with each other therefore, when the QFL chart is plotted those points can then be plotted on the sandstone provenance model. The stage of textural maturity chart illustrates the different stages that a sandstone goes through.
* A QFL chart is a representation of the framework grains and matrix that is present in a sandstone. This chart is similar to those used in igneous petrology. When plotted correctly, this model of analysis creates for a meaningful quantitative classification of sandstones.&lt;ref name="Carozzi"&gt;Carozzi, A. (1993). Sedimentary petrography. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall {{ISBN|0-13-799438-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A sandstone provenance chart allows geologists to visually interpret the different types of places from which sandstones can originate.
* A stage of textural maturity is a chart that shows the different stages of sandstones. This chart shows the difference between immature, submature, mature, and supermature sandstones. As the sandstone becomes more mature, grains become more rounded, and there is less clay in the matrix of the rock.&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt;

===Dott's classification scheme===
Dott's (1964) sandstone classification scheme is one of many such schemes used by geologists for classifying sandstones. Dott's scheme is a modification of Gilbert's classification of silicate sandstones, and it incorporates R.L. Folk's dual textural and compositional maturity concepts into one classification system.&lt;ref name="Dott"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Wacke, greywacke and matrix; what approach to immature sandstone classification?|author=Robert H. Dott|url=http://jsedres.geoscienceworld.org/content/34/3/625.abstract|year=1964 |volume=34|issue=3 |pages=625–32|doi=10.1306/74D71109-2B21-11D7-8648000102C1865D|journal=SEPM Journal of Sedimentary Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy behind combining Gilbert's and R. L. Folk's schemes is that it is better able to "portray the continuous nature of textural variation from mudstone to arenite and from stable to unstable grain composition".&lt;ref name="Dott"/&gt; Dott's classification scheme is based on the mineralogy of framework grains, and on the type of matrix present in between the framework grains.

In this specific classification scheme, Dott has set the boundary between arenite and wackes at 15% matrix. In addition, Dott also breaks up the different types of framework grains that can be present in a sandstone into three major categories: quartz, feldspar, and lithic grains.&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt;
* Arenites are types of sandstone that have less than 15% clay matrix in between the framework grains.
** Quartz arenites are sandstones that contain more than 90% of siliceous grains. Grains can include [[quartz]] or [[chert]] rock fragments.&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt; Quartz arenites are texturally mature to supermature sandstones. These pure quartz sands result from extensive [[weathering]] that occurred before and during transport. This weathering removed everything but quartz grains, the most stable [[mineral]]. They are commonly affiliated with rocks that are deposited in a stable cratonic environment, such as aeolian [[beach]]es or shelf environments.&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt; Quartz arenites emanate from multiple recycling of quartz grains, generally as sedimentary source rocks and less regularly as first-cycle deposits derived from primary [[igneous]] or [[metamorphic rock]]s.&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt;
** Feldspathic arenites are sandstones that contain less than 90% quartz, and more feldspar than unstable lithic fragments, and minor accessory minerals.&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt; Feldspathic sandstones are commonly immature or sub-mature.&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt; These sandstones occur in association with cratonic or stable shelf settings.&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt; Feldspathic sandstones are derived from granitic-type, primary crystalline, rocks.&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt; If the sandstone is dominantly plagioclase, then it is igneous in origin.&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt;
** Lithic arenites are characterised by generally high content of unstable lithic fragments. Examples include volcanic and metamorphic clasts, though stable clasts such as chert are common in lithic arenites.&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt; This type of rock contains less than 90% quartz grains and more unstable rock fragments than feldspars.&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt; They are commonly immature to submature texturally.&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt; They are associated with fluvial conglomerates and other fluvial deposits, or in deeper water marine conglomerates.&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt; They are formed under conditions that produce large volumes of unstable material, derived from fine-grained rocks, mostly [[shale]]s, [[volcanic rock]]s, and [[metamorphic rock]].&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt;
* Wackes are sandstones that contain more than 15% clay matrix between framework grains.
** Quartz wackes are uncommon because quartz arenites are texturally mature to supermature.&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt;
** Felspathic wackes are feldspathic sandstone that contain a matrix that is greater than 15%.&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt;
** Lithic wacke is a sandstone in which the matrix greater than 15%.&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt;
* [[Arkose]] sandstones are more than 25 percent [[feldspar]].&lt;ref name=LF/&gt; The grains tend to be poorly rounded and less well sorted than those of pure quartz sandstones. These feldspar-rich sandstones come from rapidly eroding [[granitic]] and [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] [[terrain]]s where [[chemical weathering]] is [[subordinate]] to [[physical weathering]].
* [[Greywacke]] sandstones are a [[heterogeneous]] mixture of [[Lithic Fragment (geology)|lithic fragments]] and angular grains of quartz and feldspar or grains surrounded by a fine-grained [[Clay mineral|clay]] [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]]. Much of this matrix is formed by relatively soft fragments, such as [[shale]] and some volcanic rocks, that are chemically altered and physically compacted after deep burial of the sandstone formation.

Sandstone has been used for domestic construction and housewares since prehistoric times, and continues to be used.

Sandstone was a popular building material from ancient times. It is relatively soft, making it easy to carve. It has been widely used around the world in constructing temples, homes, and other buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/112582|title=Sandstone: Characteristics, Uses And Problems|website=www.gsa.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used for artistic purposes to create ornamental fountains and statues.

Some sandstones are resistant to [[weathering]], yet are easy to work. This makes sandstone a common [[building material|building]] and [[pavement (material)|paving]] material including in [[asphalt concrete]]. However, some that have been used in the past, such as the [[Collyhurst sandstone]] used in [[North West England]], have been found less resistant, necessitating repair and replacement in older buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sci-eng.mmu.ac.uk/manchester_stone/images.asp?page1=2&amp;vartype=building&amp;id=&amp;offset=0# Edensor, T. &amp; Drew, I. ''Building stone in the City of Manchester: St Ann's Church'']. Sci-eng.mmu.ac.uk. Retrieved on 2012-05-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the hardness of individual grains, uniformity of grain size and [[friability]] of their structure, some types of sandstone are excellent materials from which to make [[grindstone (tool)|grindstones]], for sharpening blades and other implements. Non-friable sandstone can be used to make grindstones for grinding grain, e.g., [[gritstone]].

A type of pure quartz sandstone, orthoquartzite, with more of 90–95 percent of quartz,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Definition of orthoquartzite – mindat.org glossary|url = http://www.mindat.org/glossary/orthoquartzite|website = www.mindat.org|accessdate = 2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been proposed for nomination to the [[Global Heritage Stone Resource]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.segemar.gov.ar/bibliotecaintemin/LIBROSDIGITALES/GeologicalSocietyLondonSpecialPublications2014CraveroSP4079.pdf|title = ‘Piedra Mar del Plata’: An Argentine orthoquartzite worthy of being considered as a ‘Global Heritage Stone Resource’|date = 8 July 2014|accessdate = 3 April 2015|website = |publisher = Geological Society, London|last = Cravero|first = Fernanda et alia|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150409151134/http://www.segemar.gov.ar/bibliotecaintemin/LIBROSDIGITALES/GeologicalSocietyLondonSpecialPublications2014CraveroSP4079.pdf|archivedate = 9 April 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some regions of Argentina, the orthoquartzite-stoned [[facade]] is one of the main features of the [[Mar del Plata style]] bungalows.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions''' was a [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom Cabinet]] position created in 1997, with responsibility for the '''Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions''' ('''DETR''').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/caboff/bodies97/detr.htm www.archive.official-documents.co.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410040322/http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/caboff/bodies97/detr.htm |date=2009-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The position and department were created for [[John Prescott]] by merging the positions and responsibilities of the [[Secretary of State for Environment]], the [[Secretary of State for Transport]] and some other functions.

[[Frank Dobson]], who had been [[Shadow Secretary of State for the Environment]] prior to the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 General Election]], was made [[Secretary of State for Health]], while [[Andrew Smith (politician)|Andrew Smith]], who had been [[Shadow Secretary of State for Transport]], was made a junior minister at the [[Department for Education and Employment]]. 

[[Michael Meacher]], who had been Shadow Minister for Environmental Protection within the Shadow Cabinet, was given the non cabinet position of Minister of State for the Environment, and attended cabinet meetings where the Environment was discussed,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6385545.stm]&lt;/ref&gt; and a position of Minister of State for Transport was similarly created, initially held by [[Gavin Strang]].

In June 2001, the department was renamed the [[Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions]] (DTLR), with the Environment portfolio being merged with the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]] into the [[Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]]. All departments were given their own [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretaries of State]]. In May 2002, the Local Government and the Regions portfolios were separated from Transport and given to the [[Office of the Deputy Prime Minister]], which in turn became the [[Department for Communities and Local Government]] in May 2006.

==Transport==
From 1997 to 2001, the Ministers of State with responsibility for Transport were:

* [[Gavin Strang]] (3 May 1997 – 27 July 1998)
* [[John Reid, Baron Reid of Cardowan|John Reid]] (27 July 1998 – 17 May 1999)
* [[Helen Liddell]] (17 May 1999 – 29 July 1999)
* [[Gus Macdonald, Baron Macdonald of Tradeston|Lord Macdonald of Tradeston]] (29 July 1999 – 8 June 2001)

John Reid attended cabinet meetings, but was not formally a member of the cabinet, whereas Gavin Strang was given a seat in the cabinet when he held the position.

==Environment==
Ministers of State with responsibility for the Environment included
*[[Michael Meacher]] (1997–2001)
*[[Richard Caborn]] (1997–1999)
*[[Nick Raynsford]]&lt;ref name= VFF&gt;Chris Mullin ''A view from the Foothills;'' extract from [[The Mail on Sunday]] 22 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; (1999–2001)

==Local government==
[[Hilary Armstrong]] was Minister of State with responsibility for Local Government (1997–2001).

[[File:Shear crack.svg|thumb|150px|A crack or tear may develop in a body from parallel shearing forces pushing in opposite directions at different points of the body. If the forces were aligned and aimed straight into each other, they would pinch or compress the body, rather than tear or crack it.]]

{{See|Shear stress}}
'''Shearing forces''' are unaligned [[force]]s pushing one part of a body in one specific direction, and another part of the body in the opposite direction. When the forces are aligned into each other, they are called [[compression forces]]. An example is a deck of cards being pushed one way on the top, and the other at the bottom, causing the cards to slide. Another example is when wind blows at the side of a peaked roof of a home - the side walls experience a force at their top pushing in the direction of the wind, and their bottom in the opposite direction, from the ground or foundation. William A. Nash defines shear force in terms of [[Plane (geometry)|planes]]: "If a plane is passed through a body, a force acting along this plane is called a ''shear force'' or ''shearing force''."&lt;ref name="Nash1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=William A. Nash|title=Schaum's Outline of Theory and Problems of Strength of Materials|pages=82|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vwdApH7qneAC&amp;pg=PR4|accessdate=20 May 2012|date=1 July 1998|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-046617-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shear force of steel and bolts==
Here follows a short example of how to work out the shear force of a piece of steel. The factor of 0.6 used to change from [[tensile force|tensile]] to shear force could vary from 0.58–0.62 and will depend on application.

Steel called EN8 bright has a tensile strength of 800{{nbsp}}MPa and mild steel has a tensile strength of 400{{nbsp}}MPa.

To work out the force to shear a 25&amp;nbsp;mm diameter round steel EN8 bright;
: Area of the 25{{nbsp}}mm round steel in mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (12.5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)(π) ≈ 490.8{{nbsp}}mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
: 0.8{{nbsp}}kN/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × 490.8{{nbsp}}mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 392.64{{nbsp}}kN ≈ 40{{nbsp}}tonne-force
: 40{{nbsp}}tonne-force × 0.6 (to change force from tensile to shear) = 24{{nbsp}}tonne-force

When working with a [[rivet]]ed or tensioned [[bolted joint]], the strength comes from friction between the materials bolted together. Bolts are correctly torqued to maintain the friction. The shear force only becomes relevant when the bolts are not torqued.

A bolt with property class 12.9 has a tensile strength of 1200{{nbsp}}MPa (1{{nbsp}}MPa = 1{{nbsp}}N/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) or 1.2{{nbsp}}kN/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and the yield strength is 0.90 times tensile strength, 1080{{nbsp}}MPa in this case.

A bolt with property class 4.6 has a tensile strength of 400{{nbsp}}MPa (1{{nbsp}}MPa = 1{{nbsp}}N/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) or 0.4&amp;nbsp;kN/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and yield strength is 0.60 times tensile strength, 240{{nbsp}}MPa in this case.

In case of fasteners, proof load is specified as it gives a real life picture about the characteristics of the bolt.

'''Sillénite''' or '''sillenite''' is a mineral with the [[chemical formula]] Bi&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;. It is named after the Swedish chemist [[Lars Gunnar Sillén]], who mostly studied bismuth-oxygen compounds. It is found in Australia, Europe, China, Japan, Mexico and Mozambique, typically in association with [[bismutite]].&lt;ref name=Webmineral/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt;&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt;

'''Social Fund for Development''' ([[Egypt]]) was established in 1991 by a Presidential decree # 189 and with support of the United Nations Development Programme.  SFD was created with a capital of 1.1 Billion Egyptian Pounds to alleviate the hardship created by the returning Egyptian workers from the Gulf area as a result of the [[First Gulf War]]. According to Magdy Moussa, Middle East Regional Director at Plant Finance, "SFD was regarded as a social safety net associated with the Government of Egypt's agreement to undertake its extensive Economic Reform and Structural Adjustment Program."&lt;ref&gt;Magdy Moussa (January 2007). ''Regulation and Supervision of Microfinance in Egypt''. Essays on Regulation and Supervision series, Microfinance Regulation and Supervision Resource Center.&lt;/ref&gt; SFD focuses on [[sustainable development]] projects.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} Also according to Moussa, a prominent focal point for SFD is promoting self-employment through microcredit projects.

Major donors are: the [[World Bank]], the [[European Union]], [[Germany]], [[JICA]], [[Kuwaiti Development Fund]].

[[File:Dust on the a solar panel.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Dust]] often accumulates on the glass of solar modules - highlighted in this negative image as black dots - which reduces the amount of light admitted to the solar cells]]

'''Solar cell efficiency''' refers to the portion of energy in the form of sunlight that can be converted via [[photovoltaic]]s into electricity.

The efficiency of the solar cells used in a [[photovoltaic system]], in combination with latitude and climate, determines the annual energy output of the system. For example, a solar panel with 20% efficiency and an area of 1&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; will produce 200&amp;nbsp;W at Standard Test Conditions, but it can produce more when the sun is high in the sky and will produce less in cloudy conditions or when the sun is low in the sky. In central Colorado, which receives annual [[insolation]] of 5.5&amp;nbsp;kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/day (or 230W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;),&lt;ref name="nrel.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrel.gov/gis/images/map_pv_national_lo-res.jpg |title=Photovoltaic Solar Resource of the United States |author=Billy Roberts |date=20 October 2008 |website=[[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] |access-date=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; such a panel can be expected to produce 400&amp;nbsp;[[kilowatt-hour|kWh]] of energy per year. However, in Michigan, which receives only 3.8&amp;nbsp;kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/day,&lt;ref name="nrel.gov"/&gt; annual energy yield will drop to 280&amp;nbsp;kWh for the same panel. At more northerly European latitudes, yields are significantly lower: 175&amp;nbsp;kWh annual energy yield in southern England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inference.org.uk/withouthotair/c6/page_40.shtml |title=Sustainable Energy - without the hot air |author=[[David J.

Several factors affect a cell's conversion efficiency value, including its [[Reflectivity#Reflectance|reflectance]] efficiency, [[thermodynamic efficiency limit|thermodynamic efficiency]], [[Theory of solar cells#Charge carrier separation|charge carrier separation]] efficiency, charge carrier collection efficiency and [[Thermal conduction|conduction]] efficiency values.&lt;ref name="Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Photovoltaic Cell Conversion Efficiency Basics|url=http://energy.gov/eere/energybasics/articles/photovoltaic-cell-conversion-efficiency-basics|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=6 Sep 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=kumar2017&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Ankush|date=2017-01-03|title=Predicting efficiency of solar cells based on transparent conducting electrodes|url=http://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.4973117|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=121|issue=1|pages=014502|doi=10.1063/1.4973117|issn=0021-8979|bibcode=2017JAP...121a4502K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because these parameters can be difficult to measure directly, other parameters are measured instead, including [[quantum efficiency]], [[Open-circuit voltage|V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;]] ratio, and [[#Fill factor|fill factor]]. Reflectance losses are accounted for by the quantum efficiency value, as they affect "external quantum efficiency." Recombination losses are accounted for by the quantum efficiency, V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; ratio, and fill factor values. Resistive losses are predominantly accounted for by the fill factor value, but also contribute to the quantum efficiency and V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; ratio values.

As of December 2014, the world record for solar cell efficiency at 46.0% was achieved by using [[Multi-junction solar cell|multi-junction]] [[Concentrator photovoltaics|concentrator]] solar cells, developed from collaboration efforts of [[Soitec]], [[CEA-Leti: Laboratoire d'électronique des technologies de l'information|CEA-Leti]], France together with [[Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE|Fraunhofer ISE]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/press-and-media/press-releases/press-releases-2014/new-world-record-for-solar-cell-efficiency-at-46-percent |title=New world record for solar cell efficiency at 46.0% French-German cooperation confirms competitive advantage of European photovoltaic industry |publisher=Fraunhofer ISE |date=2014-12-01 |accessdate=2016-03-24 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150823133519/http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/press-and-media/press-releases/press-releases-2014/new-world-record-for-solar-cell-efficiency-at-46-percent |archivedate= 2015-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;



==Factors affecting energy conversion efficiency==
The factors affecting energy conversion efficiency were expounded in a landmark paper by [[William Shockley]] and [[Hans Queisser]] in 1961.&lt;ref name=shockley&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Shockley William | author2 = Queisser Hans J | year = 1961 | title = Detailed Balance Limit of Efficiency of p-n Junction Solar Cells | url = http://jap.aip.org/resource/1/japiau/v32/i3/p510_s1 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20130223070842/http://jap.aip.org/resource/1/japiau/v32/i3/p510_s1 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2013-02-23 | journal = Journal of Applied Physics | volume = 32 | issue =  3| pages = 510–519 | doi = 10.1063/1.1736034 | bibcode = 1961JAP....32..510S }}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Shockley-Queisser limit]] for more detail.

===Thermodynamic efficiency limit and infinite-stack limit===
{{Main|Thermodynamic efficiency limit}}
[[File:ShockleyQueisserFullCurve.svg|thumb|The [[Shockley-Queisser limit]] for the efficiency of a single-junction solar cell under unconcentrated sunlight at 273 K. This calculated curve uses actual solar spectrum data, and therefore the curve is wiggly from IR absorption bands in the atmosphere. This efficiency limit of ~34% can be exceeded by [[multijunction solar cell]]s.]]

If one has a source of heat at temperature {{mvar|T&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} and cooler heat sink at temperature {{mvar|T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the maximum theoretically possible value for the ratio of work (or electric power) obtained to heat supplied is {{math|1-''T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''/''T&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, given by a [[Carnot heat engine]]. If we take 6000&amp;nbsp;K for the temperature of the sun and 300&amp;nbsp;K for ambient conditions on earth, this comes to 95%. In 1981, [[Alexis de Vos]] and [[Herman Pauwels]] showed that this is achievable with a stack of an infinite number of cells with band gaps ranging from infinity (the first cells encountered by the incoming photons) to zero, with a voltage in each cell very close to the open-circuit voltage, equal to 95% of the band gap of that cell, and with 6000&amp;nbsp;K [[blackbody radiation]] coming from all directions. However, the 95% efficiency thereby achieved means that the electric power is 95% of the '''''net''''' amount of light absorbed – the stack '''''emits''''' radiation as it has non-zero temperature, and this radiation has to be subtracted from the incoming radiation when calculating the amount of heat being transferred and the efficiency. They also considered the more relevant problem of maximizing the power output for a stack being illuminated from all directions by 6000&amp;nbsp;K blackbody radiation. In this case, the voltages must be lowered to less than 95% of the band gap (the percentage is not constant over all the cells). The maximum theoretical efficiency calculated is 86.8% for a stack of an infinite number of cells, using the incoming concentrated sunlight radiation.&lt;ref name=Vos80&gt;A. De Vos, "Detailed balance limit of the efficiency of tandem solar cells", ''Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics'' Volume 13, Issue 5 (14 May 1980), page 839-846 {{doi|10.1088/0022-3727/13/5/018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the incoming radiation comes only from an area of the sky the size of the sun, the efficiency limit drops to 68.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=On the Thermodynamic Limit of Photovoltaic Energy Conversion|author1=A. De Vos  |author2=H. Pauwels |lastauthoramp=yes |doi=10.1007/BF00901283|journal=Appl. Phys.|volume=25|issue=2  |pages=119–125|year=1981 |bibcode = 1981ApPhy..25..119D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultimate efficiency===
Normal photovoltaic systems however have only one [[p-n junction]] and are therefore subject to a lower efficiency limit, called the "ultimate efficiency" by Shockley and Queisser. Photons with an energy below the band gap of the absorber material cannot generate an [[Theory of solar cells#Photogeneration of charge carriers|electron-hole pair]], so their energy is not converted to useful output, and only generates heat if absorbed. For photons with an energy above the band gap energy, only a fraction of the energy above the band gap can be converted to useful output. When a photon of greater energy is absorbed, the excess energy above the band gap is converted to kinetic energy of the carrier combination. The excess kinetic energy is converted to heat through [[phonon]] interactions as the kinetic energy of the carriers slows to equilibrium velocity. Traditional single-junction cells have a maximum theoretical efficiency of 33.16%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Tabulated Values of the Shockley-Queisser Limit for Single Junction Solar Cells|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X16001110 |journal = Solar Energy|date = 2016-02-08|pages = 139–147|volume = 130|doi = 10.1016/j.solener.2016.02.015 |language = EN|first = Sven|last = Rühle|bibcode = 2016SoEn..130..139R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar cells with multiple band gap absorber materials improve efficiency by dividing the solar spectrum into smaller bins where the thermodynamic efficiency limit is higher for each bin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Limiting efficiencies for multiple energy-gap quantum devices|author1=Cheng-Hsiao Wu  |author2=Richard Williams |lastauthoramp=yes |doi=10.1063/1.331859|journal=J. Appl. Phys.|volume=54|issue=11  |page=6721 |year=1983|bibcode = 1983JAP....54.6721W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantum efficiency===
{{Main|Quantum efficiency}}
As described above, when a photon is absorbed by a solar cell it can produce an electron-hole pair. One of the carriers may reach the p-n junction and contribute to the current produced by the solar cell; such a carrier is said to be ''collected''. Or, the carriers [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombine]] with no net contribution to cell current.

Quantum efficiency refers to the percentage of photons that are converted to electric current (i.e., collected carriers) when the cell is operated under short circuit conditions. The "external" quantum efficiency of a silicon solar cell includes the effect of optical losses such as transmission and reflection.

In particular, some measures can be taken to reduce these losses. The reflection losses, which can account for up to 10% of the total incident energy, can be dramatically decreased using a technique called texturization, a light trapping method that modifies the average light path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/092702489290126A | doi=10.1016/0927-0248(92)90126-A | volume=26 | issue=1–2 | title=The surface texturization of solar cells: A new method using V-grooves with controllable sidewall angles | journal=Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells | pages=71–78| date=March 1992 | last1=Verlinden | first1=Pierre | last2=Evrard | first2=Olivier | last3=Mazy | first3=Emmanuel | last4=Crahay | first4=André }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quantum efficiency is most usefully expressed as a ''spectral'' measurement (that is, as a function of photon wavelength or energy). Since some wavelengths are absorbed more effectively than others, spectral measurements of quantum efficiency can yield valuable information about the quality of the semiconductor bulk and surfaces. Quantum efficiency alone is not the same as overall energy conversion efficiency, as it does not convey information about the fraction of power that is converted by the solar cell.

===Maximum power point===
A solar cell may operate over a wide range of [[voltage]]s (V) and [[current (electricity)|currents]] (I). By increasing the resistive load on an irradiated cell continuously from zero (a ''[[short circuit]]'') to a very high value (an ''open circuit'') one can determine the [[maximum power theorem|maximum power]] point, the point that maximizes V&amp;times;I; that is, the load for which the cell can deliver maximum electrical power at that level of irradiation. (The output power is zero in both the short circuit and open circuit extremes).

A high quality, monocrystalline silicon solar cell, at 25&amp;nbsp;°C cell temperature, may produce 0.60&amp;nbsp;[[volt|V]] open-circuit (''V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;''). The cell temperature in full sunlight, even with 25&amp;nbsp;°C air temperature, will probably be close to 45&amp;nbsp;°C, reducing the open-circuit voltage to 0.55&amp;nbsp;V per cell. The voltage drops modestly, with this type of cell, until the short-circuit current is approached (''I&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;''). Maximum power (with 45&amp;nbsp;°C cell temperature) is typically produced with 75% to 80% of the open-circuit voltage (0.43&amp;nbsp;V in this case) and 90% of the short-circuit current. This output can be up to 70% of the ''V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; x I&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;'' product. The short-circuit current (''I&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;'') from a cell is nearly proportional to the illumination, while the open-circuit voltage (''V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;'') may drop only 10% with an 80% drop in illumination. Lower-quality cells have a more rapid drop in voltage with increasing current and could produce only 1/2&amp;nbsp;''V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;'' at 1/2&amp;nbsp;''I&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;''. The usable power output could thus drop from 70% of the ''V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; x I&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;'' product to 50% or even as little as 25%. Vendors who rate their solar cell "power" only as ''V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; x I&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;'', without giving load curves, can be seriously distorting their actual performance.

The maximum power point of a [[photovoltaic]] varies with incident illumination. For example, accumulation of dust on photovoltaic panels reduces the maximum power point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=A. Molki|doi=10.1088/0031-9120/45/5/F03|title=Dust affects solar-cell efficiency|journal=Physics Education|volume=45|issue=5|pages=456–458|year=2010|bibcode = 2010PhyEd..45..456M }}&lt;/ref&gt; For systems large enough to justify the extra expense, a [[maximum power point tracker]] tracks the instantaneous power by continually measuring the voltage and [[Electric current|current]] (and hence, power transfer), and uses this information to dynamically adjust the load so the maximum power is ''always'' transferred, regardless of the variation in lighting.

===Fill factor===
Another defining term in the overall behavior of a solar cell is the '''''fill factor''''' (''FF''). This factor is a measure of quality of a solar cell. This is the  available ''power'' at the ''maximum power point'' (''P&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'') divided by the ''open circuit voltage'' (''V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;'') and the ''short circuit current'' (''I&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;''):

:&lt;math&gt;FF = \frac{P_{m}}{V_{OC} \times I_{SC}} = \frac{\eta \times A_c \times G}{V_{OC} \times I_{SC}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The fill factor can be represented graphically by the IV sweep, where it is the ratio of the different rectangular areas.&lt;ref&gt;“Part II – Photovoltaic Cell I-V Characterization Theory and LabVIEW Analysis Code.” Part II – Photovoltaic Cell I-V Characterization Theory and LabVIEW Analysis Code - National Instruments, 10 May 2012, www.ni.com/white-paper/7230/en/.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fill factor is directly affected by the values of the cell's series, [[Shunt (electrical)|shunt resistances]] and diodes losses. Increasing the shunt resistance (R&lt;sub&gt;sh&lt;/sub&gt;) and decreasing the [[Equivalent series resistance|series resistance]] (R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) lead to a higher fill factor, thus resulting in greater efficiency, and bringing the cell's output power closer to its theoretical maximum.&lt;ref name=nelson&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Physics of Solar Cells|author = Jenny Nelson|publisher = Imperial College Press|year = 2003|isbn = 978-1-86094-340-9|url=http://www.solarfreaks.com/download/file.php?id=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical fill factors range from 50% to 82%. The fill factor for a normal silicon PV cell is 80%.

== Comparison ==

{{Main|Photovoltaics}}

Energy conversion efficiency is measured by dividing the electrical output by the incident light power. Factors influencing output include spectral distribution, spatial distribution of power, temperature, and resistive load. [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] standard 61215 is used to compare the performance of cells and is designed around standard (terrestrial, temperate) temperature and conditions (STC): [[irradiance]] of 1&amp;nbsp;kW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a spectral distribution close to solar radiation through AM ([[airmass]]) of 1.5 and a cell temperature 25&amp;nbsp;°C.  The resistive load is varied until the peak or maximum power point (MPP) is achieved.  The power at this point is recorded as [[Watt-peak]] (Wp).  The same standard is used for measuring the power and efficiency of PV modules.

Air mass affects output. In space, where there is no atmosphere, the spectrum of the sun is relatively unfiltered. However, on earth, air filters the incoming light, changing the solar spectrum. The filtering effect ranges from [[air mass (solar energy)|Air Mass]] 0 (AM0) in space, to approximately Air Mass 1.5 on Earth. Multiplying the spectral differences by the quantum efficiency of the solar cell in question yields the efficiency. Terrestrial efficiencies typically are greater than space efficiencies. For example, a silicon solar cell in space might have an efficiency of 14% at AM0, but 16% on earth at AM 1.5. Note, however, that the number of incident photons in space is considerably larger, so the solar cell might produce considerably more power in space, despite the lower efficiency as indicated by reduced percentage of the total incident energy captured.

[[File:PVeff(rev180813)a.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Reported timeline of research [[solar cell]] energy conversion efficiencies since 1976 ([[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]])]]

Solar cell efficiencies vary from 6% for amorphous silicon-based solar cells to 44.0% with multiple-junction production cells and 44.4% with multiple dies assembled into a hybrid package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|url = http://publica.fraunhofer.de/documents/N-73521.html|title = Silicon Solar Cells with Screen-Printed Front Side Metallization Exceeding 19% Efficiency}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest efficiency cells have not always been the most economical — for example a 30% efficient multijunction cell based on exotic materials such as gallium arsenide or indium selenide produced at low volume might well cost one hundred times as much as an 8% efficient amorphous silicon cell in mass production, while delivering only about four times the output.

However, there is a way to "boost" solar power. By increasing the light intensity, typically photogenerated carriers are increased, increasing efficiency by up to 15%. These so-called "[[Concentrator photovoltaics|concentrator systems]]" have only begun to become cost-competitive as a result of the development of high efficiency GaAs cells. The increase in intensity is typically accomplished by using concentrating optics. A typical concentrator system may use a light intensity 6-400 times the sun, and increase the efficiency of a one sun GaAs cell from 31% at AM 1.5 to 35%.

A common method used to express economic costs is to calculate a price per delivered [[kilowatt-hour]] (kWh). The solar cell efficiency in combination with the available irradiation has a major influence on the costs, but generally speaking the overall system efficiency is important. Commercially available solar cells (as of 2006) reached system efficiencies between 5 and 19%.

Undoped crystalline silicon devices are approaching the theoretical limiting efficiency of 29.43%.&lt;ref name="Richter2013"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=A. Richter |author2=M. Hermle |author3=S.W.

Like any other technology, solar cell manufacture is dependent on and presupposes the existence of a complex global industrial manufacturing system. This comprises not only the fabrication systems typically accounted for in estimates of manufacturing energy, but the contingent mining, refining and global transportation systems, as well as other energy intensive critical support systems including finance, information, and security systems. The uncertainty of that energy component confers uncertainty on any estimate of payback times derived from that estimate, considered by some to be significant.&lt;ref&gt;Trainer, FE (2007) "Renewable Energy Cannot Sustain a Consumer Society"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical methods of improving efficiency ==

=== Choosing optimum transparent conductor ===
The illuminated side of some types of solar cells, thin films, have a transparent conducting film to allow light to enter into the active material and to collect the generated charge carriers. Typically, films with high transmittance and high electrical conductance such as indium tin oxide, conducting polymers or conducting nanowire networks are used for the purpose. There is a trade-off between high transmittance and electrical conductance, thus optimum density of conducting nanowires or conducting network structure should be chosen for high efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Ankush|date=2017-01-03|title=Predicting efficiency of solar cells based on transparent conducting electrodes|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=121|issue=1|pages=014502|doi=10.1063/1.4973117|issn=0021-8979|bibcode=2017JAP...121a4502K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Promoting light scattering in the visible spectrum ===
By lining the light receiving surface of the cell with nano-sized metallic studs, the efficiency of the cell can be substantially increased, as the light reflects off these studs at an oblique angle to the cell, increasing the length of the path the light takes through the cell, thereby increasing the number of photons absorbed by the cell, and so also the amount of current generated.&lt;ref name="Hindu Article"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mukunth|first1=Vasudevan|title=Improving the efficiency of solar panels|url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/improving-the-efficiency-of-solar-panels/article5265330.ece|accessdate=6 August 2016|publisher=The Hindu|date=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main materials used for the nano-studs are [[silver]], [[gold]], and [[aluminium]], to name a few. However, gold and silver are not very efficient, as they absorb much of the light in the visible spectrum, which contains most of the energy present in sunlight, reducing the amount of light reaching the cell.&lt;ref name="Hindu Article"/&gt; Aluminium, on the other hand, absorbs only ultraviolet radiation, and reflects both visible and infra-red light, so energy loss is minimized on that front. Aluminium is therefore capable of increasing the efficiency of the cell by up to 22% (in lab conditions).&lt;ref name="Scientific Reports Paper"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hylton|first1=Nicholas|last2=Li|first2=X.

=== Radiative cooling ===
An increase in solar cell temperature of around 1&amp;nbsp;°C leads to a decrease in efficiency of about 0.45%. To prevent decreased efficiency due to heating, a visibly transparent [[Silicon dioxide|silica]] crystal layer can be applied to a solar panel. The silica layer acts as a [[Black body|thermal black body]] which emits heat as [[Infrared|infrared radiation]] into space cooling the cell by up to 13&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhu|first=Linxiao|last2=Raman|first2=Aaswath P.|last3=Fan|first3=Shanhui|date=2015-10-06|title=Radiative cooling of solar absorbers using a visibly transparent photonic crystal thermal blackbody|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/112/40/12282|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=112|issue=40|pages=12282–12287|doi=10.1073/pnas.1509453112|issn=0027-8424|pmc=4603484|pmid=26392542|bibcode=2015PNAS..11212282Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antireflective coatings and textures ===
Antireflective coatings could result in more destructive interference of incident light waves from the sun.&lt;ref&gt;Gee, Justin. “How to Make Solar Panels More Efficient in 2018 | EnergySage.” EnergySage Solar News Feed, EnergySage, 19 Sept. 2017, news.energysage.com/how-to-make-solar-panels-more-efficient/.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, all sunlight would be transmitted into the photovoltaic. Additionally, texturizing, in which the surface of a solar cell is altered so that the reflected light strikes the surface again, is another technique used in order to reduce reflection. These surfaces can be created by etching or using lithography. Adding a flat back surface in addition to texturizing the front surface helps to trap the light within the cell for a longer optical path length.

=== Rear-surface passivation ===
While many improvements have been made to the front side of solar cells for mass production, the aluminium back-surface is holding back improvements in efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;“Rear-Surface Passivation Technology for Crystalline Silicon Solar Cells: A Versatile Process for Mass Production.” Ieee, IEEE, 2012, www.osapublishing.org/DirectPDFAccess/F1E0036E-C63D-5F6F-EA52FF38B5D1786D_270075/oe-21-S6-A1065.pdf?da=1&amp;id=270075&amp;seq=0&amp;mobile=no.&lt;/ref&gt; The efficiency of many solar cells has benefitted by creating so called, passivated emitter and rear cells (PERCs). The chemical deposition of a rear-surface dielectric passivation layer stack that is also made of either a thin silica or aluminium oxide film topped with a silicon nitride film helps to improve efficiency in silicon solar cells by over 1%. This helps increase cell efficiency for commercial Cz-Si wafer material to 20.2% and the cell efficiency for quasi-mono-Si to a record 19.9%.

=== Thin-film materials ===
Thin Film Materials show a lot of promise for solar cells in terms of low costs and adaptability to existing structures and frameworks in technology.&lt;ref&gt;Da, Yun, and Yimin Xuan. “Role of Surface Recombination in Affecting the Efficiency of Nanostructured Thin-Film Solar Cells .” Osapublishing, 2013, www.osapublishing.org/DirectPDFAccess/F1E0036E-C63D-5F6F-EA52FF38B5D1786D_270075/oe-21-S6-A1065&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the materials are so thin, they lack the optical absorption that bulk material solar cells have. While attempts to make correct this problem have been tried, more important is the focus on the thin film surface recombination. Since this is the dominant recombination process of nanoscale thin-film solar cells, it is crucial to their efficiency. Adding a passivating thin layer of silicon dioxide could reduce recombination.

The '''solar coverage rate''' is the percentage of an amount of [[energy]] that is provided by the sun. This may be in reference to a [[Solar water heating|solar thermal installation]] or a [[Photovoltaic system|photovoltaic installation]], i.e. a calculation of solar heat, [[electricity]] or total energy produced. The observation period is typically one year. As a general rule, higher values represent improved [[Energy efficiency (physics)|energy efficiency]] and improved environmental outcomes.

== General ==
The solar coverage rate is used for need-based planning of solar installations and is a measure of the energetic (non-)dependence on [[energy sources]] other than the sun.

Differentiation between solar coverage rate for buildings for:
* [[water heating]],
* [[room heating]],
* required overall heating,
* [[electricity generation]],
* required total energy.

This value depends on the size of the storage unit ([[Hot water storage tank|hot water tank]] or [[Solar battery|storage battery]]), the size of the harvesting surface (sun collection surface or surface area of photovoltaic modules), and on the amount of energy required. In addition to the total yield, there is another dimension that is important for assessing the effectiveness of a solar facility. This is the total energy loss and storage loss suffered by the facility.

== Cost effectiveness ==
The solar coverage rate cannot be used as the only measure of the [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost effectiveness]] or quality of a facility. Other conditions must be taken into account. Among other factors, the value depends on the size of the facility, the location and orientation of the collectors, the size of storage available and the amount of energy required. A solar coverage rate of 100% would mean that the system's entire energy requirement can be covered by solar energy. For a solar thermal facility in Europe, this would mean that the entire heat requirement could be covered, even on a cold winter's day. On summer days, however, this same facility would produce a very large surplus that could not be used. The facility would have to be heavily over-dimensioned for the summer and could not necessarily be operated economically. A high level of coverage is therefore not always an advantage. Nevertheless, if very high coverage levels are to be achieved, then solutions can be offered in a local heat network.

When planning a solar thermal facility, the optimal goal is to find a balanced compromise between yield, i.e. heat energy provided, and the solar coverage rate. A good compromise between yield and solar coverage usually also represents a good compromise between investment costs for the solar facility and costs saved on conventional energy.

'''Take Care of Texas'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://takecareoftexas.org/ - Take Care of Texas]&lt;/ref&gt; is a personal responsibility campaign which provides information on ways to keep air and water clean, conserve water and energy, reduce waste, and save money. The campaign is spearheaded by the [[Texas Commission on Environmental Quality]] and is known for its trademarked catchphrase, "Take Care of Texas. It’s the only one we’ve got!" 

In June 2013, country music recording artist [[Kevin Fowler]] teamed up with Take Care of Texas to produce a public service announcement that promotes outdoor recreation in the state and encourages protection of natural resources.

The '''Taxibot''' is a semi-robotic towbarless [[aircraft]] tractor developed by the Lahav Division of [[Israel Aerospace Industries]]. The tractor can tow an aircraft from the terminal gate to the take-off point (taxi-out phase) and return it to the gate after landing (taxi-in phase). The TaxiBot eliminates the use of airplane engines during taxi-in and until immediately prior to take-off during taxi-out, significantly reducing aircraft fuel usage and the risk of [[foreign object damage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Airbus MoU with IAI to explore eco-efficient ‘engines-off’ taxiing|url=http://www.aviationnews.eu/7092/airbus-mou-with-iai-to-explore-eco-efficient-engines-off-taxiing/|accessdate=27 January 2015|date=17 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TaxiBot is controlled by the pilot from the cockpit using the regular pilot controls&lt;ref name=Globes1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000620538&amp;fid=1725 |title=New IAI "taxibot" to save airlines billions |date=3 February 2011|accessdate=9 July 2012 |work=[[Globes]]|publisher=Globes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has an 800-hp hybrid-electric engine.&lt;ref name=Globes/&gt;

The TaxiBot has two models. The Narrow-Body (NB) TaxiBot will be used by existing and future single-aisle aircraft such as the [[Airbus A320]] and [[Boeing 737]] while the Wide-Body (WB) TaxiBot aim for all existing and future twin-aisle aircraft such as [[Airbus A380]] and [[Boeing 747]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taxibot-international.com/#!products/c12b6&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tinkertoy Construction Set''' is a toy construction set for children. It was created in 1914&amp;mdash;six years after the [[Frank Hornby]]'s [[Meccano]] sets&amp;mdash;by Charles H. Pajeau, who formed the Toy Tinker Company in [[Evanston, Illinois]] to manufacture them. Pajeau, a [[stonemason]], designed the [[toy]] after seeing children play with sticks and empty spools of thread. Pajeu partnered with Robert Pettit and Gordon Tinker to market a toy that would allow and inspire children to use their imaginations. After an initially slow start, over a million were sold.&lt;ref name="Coopee"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coopee|first1=Todd|title=Tinkertoys Vintage Toys|url=https://toytales.ca/tinker-toys/|website=Toy Tales|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cole"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cole|first1=David J.|last2=Cole,|first2=Eve Browning|last3=Schroeder|first3=Fred E.H.|title=The encyclopedia of everyday inventions|date=2003|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=978-0313313455|pages=73–77|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rVQfBSlAZvAC&amp;pg=PA73|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cornerstone of the set is a wooden spool roughly two [[inch]]es (5 [[Centimetre|cm]]) in diameter with holes drilled every 45 [[degree (angle)|degree]]s around the perimeter and one through the center. Unlike the center, the perimeter holes do not go all the way through. With the differing-length sticks, the set was intended to be based on the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] progressive [[right triangle]].

The sets were introduced to the public through displays in and around [[Chicago]] which included model [[Ferris wheel]]s. Tinkertoys have been used to create complex machines, including [[W. Daniel Hillis|Danny Hillis]]'s [[tic-tac-toe]]-playing [[computer]] (now in the collection of the [[Computer History Museum]] in [[Mountain View, California]]) and a [[robot]] at [[Cornell University]] in 1998.

One of Tinker Toy’s most distinctive features is the toy’s packaging. Initially, the mailing tube design was chosen to reduce shipping costs. Early versions of the packaging included an address label on the tube with space for postage. To assist consumers in differentiating between the various offerings, sets were placed in mail tube packages of different sizes and also delineated with a number (ex: 116, 136) and a name (ex: major, prep, big boy, junior, grad). A colorful “how-to” instruction guide accompanied each set. In the 1950s, color was added and the wooden sticks appeared in red, green, blue, and yellow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coopee|first1=Todd|title=Tinker Toys|url=https://toytales.ca/tinker-toys/|website=ToyTales.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main manufacturing location was a 65,000 square foot four story plant at 2012 Ridge Avenue, Evanston, Illinois.

Tinkertoys were inducted into the [[National Toy Hall of Fame]] at [[The Strong]] in [[Rochester, New York]], in 1998.

[[Hasbro]] owns the Tinkertoy brand and currently produces both Tinkertoy Plastic and Tinkertoy Classic (wood) sets and parts.

In addition to the spools, a standard Tinkertoy set includes:
*Wheels, which are thinner than spools, but larger in diameter. Like spools, their center holes have a snug fit.
*Caps, originally wooden, but later plastic, cylindrical pieces with a single blind axial hole snugly fitted to the rods.
*Couplings, small cylindrical pieces (originally wood; later plastic) approximately 2 inches long and half an inch in diameter, with snug-fitting blind-drilled holes in either end, and a loose-fitting through-drilled hole crosswise through the center of the part.
*Pulleys, identical to spools, except that the center holes are loose-fitting.
*"Part W", approximately the same size and shape as a spool, but with perimeter holes 90 degrees apart, loose-fitting center holes, and four tight-fitting through-drilled holes parallel to the center hole. This allowed for free-spinning parts, and also for construction of "cage" or "lantern" gears.
*Short pointed sticks (originally wood, but later plastic), typically red, and flags ("fan blades,") typically green plastic, and various other small parts.
Spools and pulleys all have a single groove around the outside; "Part W" has two parallel grooves.

Sticks (or "rods") are slotted on each end, both to provide some "give" when inserted into snug-fitting holes, and to allow thin cards, flags, and strings to be inserted into the slots. They  are color-coded by size; in the 1960s-era sets, they were, in order from shortest to longest, orange, yellow, blue, red, green, and violet. Each successively longer rod is (with allowances for the size of the spools) next smaller size times the square root of two; thus any two of the same size will combine with one of the next size up, and three spools, to form an [[isosceles right triangle]] (45°–45°–90°).

Tinkertoy sticks before 1992 were made with a diameter of 0.25 inch. The earlier sets had natural wood sticks, but changed to colored sticks in the late 1950s. From measurement, the orange sticks are 1.25 inches long; yellow, 2.15; blue, 3.35; red, 5.05; green, 7.40; and, purple, 10.85. Spools are 1.35 inches in diameter with holes of 0.30 inch depth.

Most of the larger sets also include a driveshaft (an unfinished wooden rod without slotted ends, of an intermediate length between "green" and "violet," normally turned with a small plastic crank.

The Ultra Construction Set also includes connectors, small cylindrical plastic pieces approximately 2 inches long with a slot in either end and a slotted hole crosswise through the center of the part.

Sets with [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]-powered [[electric motor]]s were available; these sets also typically included at least one wooden "double pulley," with a single snug-fitting through-drilled center hole, and grooved rims at two diameters, allowing different moving parts to operate at different speeds.

The '''transport length''' in a strongly diffusing medium (noted l*) is the length over which the direction of propagation of the [[photon]] is randomized. It is related to the [[mean free path]] l by the relation:&lt;ref&gt;A. Ishimaru, Wave Propagation and Scattering in Random Media, Academic Press, New York, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;l^*=\frac{l}{1-g}&lt;/math&gt;

with:
g: the asymmetry coefficient. &lt;math&gt;g=  &lt;cos (\theta) &gt; &lt;/math&gt; or averaging of the scattering angle θ over a high number of [[scattering event]]s.

g can be evaluated with the [[Mie theory]].&lt;br /&gt;
If g=0, l=l*. A single scattering is already isotropic.&lt;br /&gt;
If g→1, l*→infinite. A single scattering doesn't deviate the photons. Then the scattering never gets isotropic.

This length is useful for renormalizing a non-isotropic scattering problem into an isotropic one in order to use classical diffusion laws ([[Fick law]] and [[Brownian motion]]). The transport length might be measured by transmission experiments and backscattering experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Talanta, Volume 50, Issue 2, 13 September 1999, Pages 445–456&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Snabre, A. Arhaliass, Anisotropic scattering of light in random media. Incoherent backscattered spot light, Appl. Optics 37 (18) (1998) 211–225.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tropical medicine''' is an interdisciplinary branch of medicine that deals with health issues that occur uniquely, are more widespread, or are more difficult to control in tropical and subtropical regions.&lt;ref name="healthcareers"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.healthcareers.nhs.uk/explore-roles/doctors/roles-doctors/medicine/tropical-medicine|title=Tropical medicine|date=2015-04-07|work=Health Careers }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicians in this field diagnose and treat a variety of diseases and ailments. Most infections they deal with are [[Endemism|endemic]] to the tropics. A few of the most well-known include [[malaria]], [[HIV]]/[[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]], and [[tuberculosis]]. They must be knowledgeable in the 18 lesser known neglected tropical diseases, which include Chagas disease, rabies, and dengue. Poor living conditions in underdeveloped tropical countries have led to a rising number of non-communicable diseases. These diseases include cancer and cardiovascular disease, which, in the past, have been more of a worry in developed countries. Physicians trained in tropical medicine must also be prepared to diagnose and treat these diseases.&lt;ref name="healthcareers" /&gt;

Training for physicians wishing to specialize in tropical medicine varies widely over the different countries. They must study [[epidemiology]], [[virology]], [[parasitology]], and statistics, as well as the training required of an ordinary MD. Research on tropical diseases and how to treat them comes from both field research and research centers, including those of the military.&lt;ref name="Beaumier_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beaumier CM, Gomez-Rubio AM, Hotez PJ, Weina PJ | title = United States military tropical medicine: extraordinary legacy, uncertain future | journal = PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases | volume = 7 | issue = 12 | pages = e2448 | date = 2013-12-26 | pmid = 24386494 | pmc = 3873258 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pntd.0002448 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sir Patrick Manson]] is recognized as the [[List of people considered father or mother of a scientific field|father]] of tropical medicine. He founded the [[London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine]] in 1899.&lt;ref name="To_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = To KK, Yuen KY | title = In memory of Patrick Manson, founding father of tropical medicine and the discovery of vector-borne infections | journal = Emerging Microbes &amp; Infections | volume = 1 | issue = 10 | pages = e31 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 26038403 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1038/emi.2012.32 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with discovering the vector by which [[elephantiasis]] was being passed to humans. He learned it was a microscopic nematode worm called ''filaria'' ''sanguinis hominis.'' He continued to study this worm and its life cycle and determined the worms underwent metamorphosis within female ''culex fatigans'' mosquitoes. Thus he discovered mosquitoes as a vector for elephantiasis. After this discovery he collaborated with [[Ronald Ross]] to examine the transmission of malaria via mosquito vector. His work with discovering vectors as modes of transmission was critical in the founding of tropical medicine and our current understanding of many tropical diseases.&lt;ref name="To_2012" /&gt;

==Training==
Training in tropical medicine is quite different between countries. Most physicians are trained at institutes of tropical medicine or incorporated into the training of infectious diseases.
[[File:London_School_of_Hygiene_&amp;_Tropical_Medicine_-_entrance.JPG|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:London_School_of_Hygiene_&amp;_Tropical_Medicine_-_entrance.JPG|thumb|238x238px|The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, founded by Sir Patrick Manson]]
In the UK, if a physician wants to specialize in tropical medicine, they must first train in general internal medicine and get accepted into the [[Royal College of Physicians]]. They must simultaneously study the specialty of infectious diseases while completing a full-time course load to receive their Diploma of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. Their studies are carried out at either the London or Liverpool schools of tropical medicine. Additionally, they must spend two years at one of the UK centers approved for tropical medicine (located in London, Liverpool, or Birmingham). Physicians in the UK who wish to be certified in tropical medicine must spend at least a year abroad in an area lacking resources. Only then can they become certified in tropical medicine.

The training of United States tropical doctors is similar, though it is not a board recognized specialty in America. Physicians must first complete medical school and a program focusing on infectious diseases. Once completed, physicians can take the certification exam from the [[American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene]] in order to receive the Certificate of Knowledge in Clinical Tropical Medicine and Travelers' Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sph.tulane.edu/mdmph/trmd-program-reqs|title=Tropical Medicine MD/MPH Program Requirements {{!}} School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine|website=sph.tulane.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mayo.edu/mayo-clinic-school-of-graduate-medical-education/mayo-international-health-program/resources/tropical-medicine-courses|title=Mayo International Health Program - Tropical Medicine Courses|work=Mayo Clinic|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
===HIV===
In developing countries alone, 22 million people are living with HIV. Most infections are still in Africa, but Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean are now seeing large numbers of infections as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/immunization/topics/hiv/en/index1.html|title=WHO {{!}} HIV / AIDS|website=www.who.int|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilks_1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilks|first=Charles F |name-list-format = vanc | date = 1997-06-01|title=Tropical medicine in the HIV/AIDS era |journal=The Lancet|volume=349|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(97)90076-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 95% of expected new infections will occur in the low income countries in the tropics.&lt;ref name="Boutayeb_2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boutayeb A | title = The double burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases in developing countries | journal = Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene | volume = 100 | issue = 3 | pages = 191–9 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16274715 | doi = 10.1016/j.trstmh.2005.07.021 | url = https://academic.oup.com/trstmh/article/100/3/191/1880267 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilks_1997" /&gt; The expected number of new infections is 3-4 million per year.&lt;ref name="Gilks_1997" /&gt; Risk factors such as needle use and unprotected sex are much more prevalent in tropical and underdeveloped areas. Once HIV is transmitted to a tropical area it is spread throughout the sexually active population. Though how fast and how far it spreads varies, some African countries have an HIV prevalence of 10%. More alarming still, in urban areas, prevalence among pregnant women can get as high as 30%. Healthcare professionals themselves are at great risk of exposure to HIV. An HIV prevalence of 10% means any given workforce will also have a 10% prevalence, and this does not exclude the healthcare team.&lt;ref name="Gilks_1997" /&gt;{{dubious|reason=Even if the source says so, this is not how statistics work.|date=November 2018}} Tuberculosis is thought to cause a more rapid disease progression. Tuberculosis is prevalent in tropical and under-developed countries, only making HIV more devastating.&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt; Without the expensive and high-tech medical equipment of developed, western countries, physicians in the tropics are left with few options. If they are able to catch an HIV-related bacterial or [[Mycobacterium|mycobacterial]] disease they can diagnose and manage the disease with basic drugs and standard treatment protocol. Many under-developed countries do not have a care strategy, and of those that do, they aren't as effective as they need to be to stop the spread of HIV.&lt;ref name="Gilks_1997" /&gt;

===Malaria===
[[File:Malaria_map.PNG|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Malaria_map.PNG|thumb|297x297px|A map detailing areas where malaria is endemic.]]
[[Malaria]] is a parasitic disease transmitted by an ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquito to a human host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/biology/index.html|title=CDC - Malaria - About Malaria - Biology|last=Prevention|first=CDC - Centers for Disease Control and|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parasite that causes malaria belongs to the genus ''[[Plasmodium]]''. Once infected, malaria can take a wide variety of forms and symptoms. The disease is placed into the uncomplicated category or the severe category. If quickly diagnosed and treated, malaria can be cured. However, some of the more serious symptoms, such as [[acute kidney failure]], severe [[anemia]], and [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] can be fatal if not dealt with swiftly and properly. Certain types of ''Plasmodium'' can leave dormant parasites in the liver that can reawaken months or years later, causing additional relapses of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/disease.html|title=CDC - Malaria - About Malaria - Disease|last=Prevention|first=CDC - Centers for Disease Control and|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''World Malaria Report'' of 2016, the World Health Organization reported a malaria infection rate of 212 million, 90% of which occurred in the African region. However, malaria infection rates had fallen 21% since 2010 at the time of the report. The WHO also reported an estimated mortality rate of 429,000 deaths in the year 2015. The malaria mortality rate had fallen 29% globally since 2010.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/malaria/media/world-malaria-report-2016/en/|title=Fact Sheet: World Malaria Report 2016|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children under 5 contract the malaria disease more easily than others, and in the year 2015, an estimated 303,000 children under the age of 5 were killed by malaria. Since the year 2010 however, the mortality rate of children under 5 fell by an estimated 35%.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

===Tuberculosis===
[[Tuberculosis]] (TB) is an infectious bacterial disease that can affect any part of the body, though it primarily affects the lungs. It is a disease that affects the poor and weak, and is far more common in developing countries.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lstmed.ac.uk/research/topics/tuberculosis|title=Tuberculosis {{!}} LSTM|website=www.lstmed.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/tb/topic/basics/default.htm|title=Basic TB Facts {{!}} TB {{!}} CDC|date=2018-02-20|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; TB can either be in its latent or active form. TB can be latent for years, sometimes over a decade.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Though TB research receives a mere 1/6th the funding of HIV research, the disease has killed more people in the last 200 years than any other infectious disease.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; According to the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, an estimated 9 million people were infected with TB in the year 2013 alone. That same year 1.5 million people died from TB. Of those 1.5 million, 360,000 were HIV positive. Tuberculosis is extremely expensive to treat, and treatments are now becoming ineffective due to drug-resistant TB strains.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In the year 2016, 1.3 million people died from TB. An additional 374,000 people died who were co-infected with both TB and HIV.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tbfacts.org/tb-hiv/|title=TB and HIV {{!}} Co-infection, statistics, diagnosis &amp; treatment|work=TB Facts.org|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that if the subject is infected with HIV, the risk of latent TB becoming active TB is between 12 and 20 times higher.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

===Non-communicable diseases===
[[Non-communicable disease]]s are a series of chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, injuries, and respiratory diseases, among others. Historically these diseases have plagued developed countries far more than developing countries.&lt;ref name="Boutayeb_2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Miranda JJ, Kinra S, Casas JP, Davey Smith G, Ebrahim S | title = Non-communicable diseases in low- and middle-income countries: context, determinants and health policy | journal = Tropical Medicine &amp; International Health | volume = 13 | issue = 10 | pages = 1225–34 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18937743 | pmc = 2687091 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2008.02116.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Global Burden of Disease Study]] of 2001, it was discovered that 20% of deaths in sub-Saharan Africa were caused by non-communicable diseases. In 2005, the World Health Organization performed a study that showed 80% of chronic disease deaths occurred in low to middle income countries.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boutayeb_2006" /&gt; Non-communicable disease prevalence has been rising in under-developed countries for a variety of reasons. Lack of education and preventative medicine in under-developed countries, along with malnutrition or poor diet lead to many risk factors for non-communicable diseases.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

===Neglected tropical diseases===
[[Neglected tropical diseases]] (NTDs) have been identified by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) as 18 tropical diseases, affecting over a billion people worldwide, especially in developing countries. These diseases are [[heterogeneous]], meaning originating outside the organism affected by the disease. NTDs are caused by parasites, viruses, and bacteria. NTDs are neglected because they are not normally fatal on their own but are disabling. Persons with these diseases become more susceptible to other NTDs and fatal diseases such as [[HIV]] or [[malaria]].&lt;ref name="hms"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/special-edition-on-infectious-disease/2014/neglected-tropical-diseases-progress-and-challenges-for-the-post-2015-development-era/|title=Neglected Tropical Diseases: Progress and Challenges for the Post-2015 Development Era - Science in the News|date=2014-12-31|work=Science in the News|access-date=2018-02-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neglected tropical diseases effect can be measured in [[disability-adjusted life year]] (DALY). Each DALY corresponds to one lost year of healthy life, whether by death or disability. In the year 2010, it was estimated 26.6 million DALYs were lost. In addition to this, it is estimated NTDs cause a loss of 15-30% of productivity in countries that NTDs are endemic too.&lt;ref name="hms" /&gt; According to the CDC, 100% of countries categorized as 'low income' were affected by 5 different NTDs at once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/ntd/index.html|title=CDC - Global Health - Neglected Tropical Diseases|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interdisciplinary approach==
Tropical medicine requires an interdisciplinary approach, as the infections and diseases tropical medicine faces are both broad and unique. Tropical medicine requires research and assistance from the fields of [[epidemiology]], [[microbiology]], [[virology]], [[parasitology]], and [[logistics]]. Physicians of tropical medicine must have effective communication skills, as many of the patients they interact with do not speak English comfortably. They must be proficient in their knowledge of clinical and diagnostic skills, as they are often without high-tech diagnostic tools when in the field. For example, in an attempt to manage the [[Chagas disease]] being brought into the almost Chagas-free Brazilian city [[São Paulo]] by Bolivian immigrants, an interdisciplinary team was set up. The Bolivian immigrant population in São Paulo had a prevalence of Chagas disease of 4.4%, while Chagas disease transmission in [[São Paulo]] has been under control since the 1970s. This influx of Chagas disease led to an interdisciplinary team being brought together, This team tested the feasibility of managing Chagas disease and transmission at the primary healthcare level. The interdisciplinary team consisted of community health agents and clerical healthcare workers to recruit Chagas infected persons for the study, physicians, nurses, lab workers, and community agents. A pediatrician and cardiologist were also on call. Each were trained in [[pathology]], parasitology, ecoepidemiology, and how to prevent, diagnose, and control Chagas disease. Training from experts in these respective fields was required. They examined reasons for lack of adherence to treatment, and used this knowledge to improve the effectiveness of their interventions. This interdisciplinary approach has been used to train many teams across Brazil in the management of Chagas disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shikanai Yasuda MA, Sátolo CG, Carvalho NB, Atala MM, Ferrufino RQ, Leite RM, Furucho CR, Luna E, Silva RA, Hage M, Oliveira CM, Busser FD, Freitas VL, Wanderley DM, Martinelli L, Almeida SR, Viñas PA, Carneiro N | title = Interdisciplinary approach at the primary healthcare level for Bolivian immigrants with Chagas disease in the city of São Paulo | journal = PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = e0005466 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28333923 | pmc = 5380346 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pntd.0005466 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tropical medicine also consists of a preventative approach, especially in an educational aspect. For example, from 2009 to 2011, the [[London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine]] did an interventional study on a cohort of female sex workers (FSW) in [[Ouagadougou]], [[Burkina Faso]], a country in Eastern Africa. 321 HIV-unaffected FSWs were provided with peer-led HIV/STI education, HIV/STI testing and care, psychological support, general healthcare, and services for reproductive health. The same cohort would continue to follow up, quarterly, for 21 months. At each follow up they were tested for HIV and were able to utilize the preventative interventions if need be. Using models based on the same study population had their been no interventions, the expected prevalence of HIV infections was 1.23 infection per 100 person years. In the actual cohort with access to interventions not a single HIV infection was observed in the collective 409 person-years of follow-up.&lt;ref&gt;"Recent Findings in HIV/AIDS Described by Researchers from London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (HIV prevention and care services for female sex workers: efficacy of a targeted community-based intervention in Burkina Faso)." ''AIDS Weekly'', 19 Oct. 2015, p. 66. ''General OneFile'', &lt;nowiki&gt;http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A431893004/ITOF?u=mlin_b_northest&amp;sid=ITOF&amp;xid=6128df21&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Accessed 22 Mar. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tropical research in the military==
Throughout history, American military forces have been affected by many tropical diseases. In [[World War II]] alone, it was estimated almost one million soldiers had been infected by a tropical disease while serving. Most affected soldiers served in the Pacific, especially in the Philippines and New Guinea. Malaria was especially widespread in the Pacific, though soldiers in Southern Europe and Northern Africa also contracted it.&lt;ref name="Beaumier_2013"/&gt; Many diseases now known as neglected tropical diseases affected America soldiers as well. These included [[helminthiasis]], [[schistosomiasis]], [[Dengue fever|dengue]], and [[lymphatic filariasis]]. Lymphatic filariasis was such a problem it caused a $100 million evacuation of U.S troops out of New Guinea and the Tonga Islands.&lt;ref name="Beaumier_2013"/&gt;

In both the [[Korean War|Korean]] and [[Vietnam War|Vietnam Wars]] the United States army continued to be affected by tropical diseases. The most prevalent diseases to affect their military were malaria and dengue. Hepatitis A, scrub typhus, and hookworm infections were among the other tropical infections picked up by troops in these conflicts.&lt;ref name="Beaumier_2013"/&gt;

To combat the significant effects tropical diseases were having on their forces, the United States Military worked hard to develop drugs, vaccines, and other methods of disease control. Research done at the [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research]] (WRAIR), the [[Naval Medical Research Center]] (NMRC), and various affiliated research centers have greatly improved the military's preparedness against tropical disease. In 1967, Captain Robert Phillips earned the [[Lasker Award]] for developing a type of IV therapy that reduced cholera's fatality rate from 60% to less than 1%. Other interventions licensed by the US Army include vaccines for [[hepatitis A]] and [[Japanese encephalitis]]. They have also developed the drugs [[mefloquine]] and [[malarone]], both used in the treatment of malaria.&lt;ref name="Beaumier_2013"/&gt;

Looking forward, the United States military currently has clinical trials testing for vaccines of malaria, [[adenovirus infection]], dengue, and HIV/AIDS underway.&lt;ref name="Beaumier_2013"/&gt; However, with massive budget cuts to their military, these research centers are getting less and less funding and have lost many contractors already.&lt;ref name="Beaumier_2013"/&gt;

'''Tropical timber''' may refer to any type of [[timber]] or [[wood]] that grows in [[tropical rainforest]]s and [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests]] and is [[Harvester (forestry)|harvested]] there. Typical examples of worldwide industrial significance include the [[hardwood]]s
*[[Mahogany]]
*[[Teak]]
*[[Ebony]]
*[[Rosewood]]
*[[Pterocarpus indicus|Narra]]
*[[Chloroxylon]]
among many others.

[[Overexploitation]] of those woods has led to widespread [[tropical deforestation|deforestation]] in the [[tropics]]. The [[intergovernmental organization]] [[International Tropical Timber Organization]] is concerned with [[ecological conservation|conservation]] of the habitats of tropical timber trees.

'''Honeywell UOP''', formerly known as '''UOP LLC''' or '''Universal Oil Products''', is a multi-national company developing and delivering technology to the petroleum [[oil refining|refining]], gas processing, [[petrochemical]] production, and major manufacturing industries. 

The company's roots date back to 1914, when the revolutionary Dubbs [[thermal cracking]] process created the technological foundation for today's modern refining industry. In the ensuing decades, UOP engineers generated thousands of patents, leading to important advances in process technology, profitability consultation, and equipment design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Universal Oil Products |url=http://www.uop.com/overview/8045.html |accessdate=2009-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817130033/http://www.uop.com/overview/8045.html |archivedate=2009-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
UOP was founded in 1914 to exploit the market potential of patents held by inventors Jesse A. Dubbs and his son, Carbon Petroleum (C. P.) Dubbs. Perhaps because he was born in Pennsylvania oil country, Jesse Dubbs was enamored with the oil business. He even named his son Carbon after one of the elemental constituents of oil. Later, Carbon added the P. to make his name "euphonious," he said. People started calling him "Petroleum" for fun, and the name stuck. C. P.'s son and grandson were also named Carbon, but each had a different middle initial.&lt;ref name="Universal Oil Products (UOP) Riverside Laboratory"&gt;{{cite web|title=Universal Oil Products (UOP) Riverside Laboratory|url=http://portal.acs.org/portal/PublicWebSite/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/uoplaboratory/index.htm | publisher=[[American Chemical Society]] |accessdate=April 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.uop.com/about-us/uop-history/founding-years-2/ |title=Founding Years |publisher=UOP |accessdate=September 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When founded in 1914 it was a privately held firm known as the '''National Hydrocarbon Company'''. [[J. Ogden Armour]] provided initial seed money and kept the firm going the first years it lost money.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abcolby.com/ A.B. Colby, Inc., UOP distributor&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;  Most of the losses were incurred during lengthy legal battles with petroleum firms that were using technology patented by Dubbs.

In 1919 the firm's name became Universal Oil Products. 

By 1931, petroleum firms saw a possible competitive advantage to owning UOP.  A consortium of firms banded together to purchase the firm.  These firms were Shell Oil Company, Standard Oil Company of California, Standard Oil Company of Indiana, Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, The Texas Company, and N. V. de Bataafsche Petroleum Maatschappij. This worried oil firms that were not part of the group and it helped prompt the Justice Department to begin an investigation of this arrangement as a possible violation of antitrust laws.

The oil firms placed the assets of UOP into a trust to support the [[American Chemical Society]].  In 1959 UOP went public and the income from that sale still provides monies to the [[American Chemical Society]] to administer grants to universities worldwide.&lt;ref name="Universal Oil Products (UOP) Riverside Laboratory"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1988 Union Carbide Corporation and [[AlliedSignal]] formed a joint venture combining the latter's wholly owned subsidiary, UOP Inc., and the Catalyst, Adsorbents and Process Systems (CAPS) business of Union Carbide.

AlliedSignal acquired [[Honeywell]] in 1999 and assumed the latter's name. In 2005, what was now known as Honeywell acquired Union Carbide's stake in UOP, making it again a wholly owned subsidiary. The reported payment to Union Carbide was $835 million, valuing UOP at $1.6 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nema.org/media/ind/20051004c.cfm |title=Honeywell to acquire remaining stake in UOP LLC Joint Venture |publisher=Nema.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
[[File:Honeywell green fuel refinery in Pasadena, Texas.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A Honeywell refinery producing [[green diesel]] from natural oils in Pasadena, Texas.]]The UOP Riverside research and development laboratory was conceived in 1921 by [[Hiram Halle|Hiram J. Halle]], the chief executive officer of Universal Oil Products (now simply UOP), as a focal point where the best and brightest scientists could create new products and provide scientific support for the oil refining industry. Between 1921 and 1955, Riverside research resulted in 8,790 U.S. and foreign patents and provided the foundation on which UOP built its success.&lt;ref name="Universal Oil Products (UOP) Riverside Laboratory"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The company benefited immensely by the addition to its research staff of Professor [[Vladimir Ipatieff]], famous Russian scientist known internationally for his work in high-pressure catalysis. His contribution in catalytic chemistry gave UOP a position of leadership in the development of [[catalysis]] as applied to petroleum processing, the first being catalytic [[polymerization]].  Vladimir Haensel, a student of Ipatieff’s, joined UOP and developed Platforming in the 1950s.  This process used very small amounts of [[platinum]] as a catalyst for the high yield of high-octane gasoline from petroleum-based feeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebah.com.br/content/ABAAABOMUAA/a-history-of-industrial-catalysis-2010 |title=A history of industrial catalysis 2010, Author Nicholas Nicholas |publisher=Ebah.com.br |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Riverside facility was recognized as a [[National Historic Chemical Landmarks|National Historic Chemical Landmark]] by the [[American Chemical Society]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="Universal Oil Products (UOP) Riverside Laboratory"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
UOP products fall into two groupings, physical products that can be seen, and technology products that provide knowledge and design.  Physical products tend to be items used within a refinery or petrochemical plant to help convert chemicals into a desired product.  Technology products tend to be based upon the ability to convert one chemical into another, refine crude oil, and separate chemicals from each other.  For example: One area of UOP's expertise is [[fluid catalytic cracking]] that breaks long-chain hydrocarbons from crude oil into shorter compounds.

==Technologies==
===Adsorption separation technology===
[[Fractionating column | Distillation]] is the most common way to separate chemicals with different [[boiling point]]s.  The greater the difference in boiling points, the easier it is to do.  However, when boiling points are too similar, this isn't feasible.  Adsorption separation might be possible.  In adsorption separation, a mixture of chemicals flows past a porous solid called the adsorbent and some chemicals tend to "hang out" longer.  A valid analogy is to imagine a busy street with people walking in the same direction past great places to eat.  The hungriest people will tend to stop right away.  The people that were pretty full will make it far down the street.  Now imagine flooding the whole town with water and everyone runs out where you can collect them according to how hungry they were.  In technical terms the liquid flush is called the desorbent.

This type of separation was first commonly used in the laboratory to separate small test samples.  UOP pioneered a method of separating large volumes of chemicals.  They call the counter-current embodiment of it the Sorbex family of processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chemeng-processing.blogspot.com/2009/02/uop-sobrex-technology.html |title=UOP Sorbex family of technologies, Author James Johnson |publisher=Chemeng-processing.blogspot.com |date=2009-02-21 |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These are the major ones designed by UOP:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Parex: separation of [[p-xylene|para-xylene]] from a mixture of [[xylene]] [[isomers]]&lt;br&gt;
MX Sorbex: separation of [[m-xylene|meta-xylene]] from a mixed of xylene isomers&lt;br&gt;
Molex: [[linear paraffins]] from branched and cyclic hydrocarbons&lt;br&gt;
Olex: olefins from paraffins&lt;br&gt;
Cresex: para-cresol or meta-cresol from other cresol isomers&lt;br&gt;
Cymex: para-cymene or meta-cymene from other cymene isomers&lt;br&gt;
Sarex: fructose from mixed sugars

===Renewable fuels technology===
In 2008, UOP revealed its Ecofining process which takes [[vegetable oils]], or [[lipids]], and converts them into replacements for diesel and jet fuels. The resultant fuels from this refining process are indistinguishable from existing fossil-based petro-diesels and jet fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UOP/Eni Ecofining Process for Green Diesel Fuel | url=http://www.uop.com/renewables/10010.html | accessdate=2009-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catalytic converter===
Most of UOP's work is not known to the general public since most applications are within refineries and petrochemical plants.  However, one technology UOP helped developed is familiar to automobile owners.  During the 1970s, UOP worked on pioneering a combined [[muffler]] [[catalytic converter]].  To help publicize their work they sponsored [[Can-Am Challenge Cup|CanAm]] and [[Formula One]] teams.  The race cars used were developed by [[Shadow Racing Cars]]. Many race fans were drawn to the team's innovative designs and underdog status. UOP finally achieved a goal when California adopted the catalytic converter after the UOP governmental relations rep, Donald Gazzaniga, helped push legislation through the state Senate and Assembly. &lt;ref&gt;UOP&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AT0725 map.png|thumb|Map of the Zambezian and mopane woodlands]] 
The '''Zambezian and mopane woodlands''' is a [[tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] [[ecoregion]] of southeastern [[Africa]].

The ecoregion is characterized by the mopane tree ''([[Colophospermum mopane]])'', and extends across portions of [[Botswana]], [[Malawi]], [[Mozambique]], [[Namibia]], [[South Africa]], [[Swaziland]], [[Zambia]], and [[Zimbabwe]], including the lower basins of the [[Zambezi River|Zambezi]] and [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] rivers. 

The more humid [[Southern Zanzibar-Inhambane coastal forest mosaic]] and [[Maputaland coastal forest mosaic]] ecoregions lie between the Zambezian and mopane woodlands and the [[Indian Ocean]]. The Zambezian and mopane woodlands lie generally at a lower elevation, and has lower rainfall, than the neighboring [[miombo woodlands]] ecoregions, which occupy the plateaus and escarpments above the river lowlands. It is bounded to the southwest by the [[Drakensberg Range]] and [[Southern African Bushveld]] and [[Drakensberg montane grassland, woodland, and forest]] ecoregions. To the west, it transitions to the drier [[Zambezian baikiaea woodlands]] and [[Kalahari Acacia-Baikiaea woodlands]] on the [[Kalahari]] sands of the Southern African Plateau.

==Protected areas==
Protected areas in the ecoregion include:
* [[Banhine National Park]], Mozambique
* [[Gonarezhou National Park]], Zimbabwe
* [[Gorongosa National Park]], Mozambique
* [[Kruger National Park]], South Africa
* [[Limpopo National Park]], Mozambique
* [[Lower Zambezi National Park]], Zambia
* [[Mana Pools National Park]], Zimbabwe
* [[Matusadona National Park]], Zimbabwe
* [[Zinave National Park]], Mozambique
