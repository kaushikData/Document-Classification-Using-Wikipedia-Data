{{italic title}}
'''''{{lang|la|Ad nauseam}}''''' is a [[Latin]] term for argument or other discussion that has continued 'to [the point of] nausea'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Amo, Amas, Amat and More| first=Eugene| last=Ehrlich| year=1985| page=25| publisher=Harper &amp; Row, Publishers| location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ad%20nauseam "ad nauseam" definitions from Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the sentence "This topic has been discussed ''{{lang|la|ad nauseam}}''" signifies that the topic in question has been discussed extensively, and that those involved in the discussion have grown tired of it.  The fallacy is also called '''''{{lang|la|argumentum [[ad infinitum]]}}''''' ('to infinity'), and '''argument from repetition'''.&lt;ref name="AHD"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ad nauseam|url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=ad%20nauseam|publisher=[[American Heritage Dictionary]]|accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applicability==

The term (in all three variants) is defined by the ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]'' as "an argument made repeatedly (possibly by different people) until nobody cares to discuss it any more. This may sometimes, but not always, be a form of [[proof by assertion]]."&lt;ref name="AHD" /&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2018}} 

In other words, it refers not to something initially or topically unpleasant; rather, it is something discussed to the point of being so.

{{Semiotics}}
'''Algirdas Julien Greimas''' ({{IPA-fr|alɡiʁdas ʒyljɛ̃ gʁɛmas|lang}};&lt;ref name="DSD"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Sprog,_religion_og_filosofi/Sprog/Sprogforskeres_biografier/Algirdas_Julien_Greimas |title= Algirdas Julien Greimas |accessdate= 15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; born ''Algirdas Julius Greimas''; 9 March 1917 – 27 February 1992), was a [[France|French]]-[[Lithuania]]n literary scientist, known among other things for the [[Semiotic square|Greimas Square]] (''le carré sémiotique''). He is, along with [[Roland Barthes]], considered the most prominent of the French [[semiotics|semiotician]]s. With his training in structural linguistics, he added to the theory of [[Sign (semiotics)|signification]] and laid the foundations for the Parisian school of semiotics.  Among Greimas's major contributions to semiotics are the concepts of [[Isotopy (semiotics)|isotopy]], the [[actantial model]], the narrative program, and the semiotics of the natural world. He also researched [[Lithuanian mythology]] and [[Proto-Indo-European religion]], and was influential in [[semiotic literary criticism]].

==Biography==
Greimas's father, Julius Greimas, 1882–1942, a teacher and later school inspector, was from Liudvinavas in the [[Suvalkija]] region of present-day [[Lithuania]]. His mother Konstancija Greimienė, née Mickevičiūtė (Mickevičius), 1886–1956, a secretary, was from [[Kalvarija, Lithuania|Kalvarija]].&lt;ref name=kasponis2005/&gt; They lived in [[Tula, Russia|Tula]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], when he was born, where they ran away as refugees during World War I. They returned with him to Lithuania when he was two years old. His baptismal names are "Algirdas Julius"&lt;ref name=zemlickas/&gt; but he used the French version of his middle name, ''Julien'', while he lived abroad.  He did not speak another language than [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] until [[Gymnasium (school)|preparatory middle school]], where he started with German and then French, which opened the door for his early philosophical readings in [[Gymnasium (school)|high school]] of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]. After attending schools in several towns, as his family moved, and finishing [[Rygiškių Jonas High School]] in [[Marijampolė]] in 1934, he studied law at [[Kaunas University|Vytautas Magnus University]], [[Kaunas]], and then drifted toward linguistics at the [[University of Grenoble]], from which he graduated in 1939 with a paper on [[Provençal dialect|Franco-Provençal dialects]].&lt;ref name=peron/&gt; He hoped to focus next on early medieval linguistics (substrate [[Toponymy|toponyms]] in the [[Grésivaudan|Alps]]),&lt;ref name=greimas1985/&gt; but the beginning of [[History of Lithuania#World War II (1939–1945)|World War II]] returned him to Lithuania for military service, where he then taught, worked as an editor, and published literary reviews and essays on culture.&lt;ref name=katilus/&gt;

In 1944 he enrolled for graduate study at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in Paris and specialized in [[lexicography]], namely [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] of exact, interrelated definitions. He wrote a thesis on the vocabulary of fashion (a topic later popularized by [[Roland Barthes]]), for which he received a PhD in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Key Thinkers in Linguistics and the Philosophy of Language |chapter= Greimas |editor= Siobhan Chapman |editor2= Christopher Routledge| publisher= Oxford University Press |year=2005 |pages= 106–107 |isbn=0-19-518768-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greimas began his academic career as a teacher at a French Catholic boarding school for girls in [[Alexandria]] in Egypt,&lt;ref name=greimas1985/&gt; where he would take part in a weekly discussion group of about a dozen European researchers that included a philosopher, a historian, and a sociologist.&lt;ref name=dosse/&gt; Early on, he also met [[Roland Barthes]], with whom he remained close for the next 15 years.&lt;ref name=greimas1985/&gt; In 1959 he moved on to universities in Ankara and Istanbul in Turkey, and then to [[Poitiers]] in France. In 1965 he became professor at the [[École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]] (EHESS) in Paris, where he taught for almost 25 years. He co-founded and became Secretary General of the [[International Association for Semiotic Studies]].

Greimas died in 1992 in [[Paris]], and was buried at his mother's resting place,&lt;ref name=bagdonas/&gt; [[Petrašiūnai Cemetery]] in Kaunas, Lithuania.&lt;ref name=grabauskas/&gt; (His parents were [[Soviet deportations from Lithuania|deported to Siberia]] during the [[History of Lithuania#World War II (1939–1945)|Soviet occupation]]. His mother managed to return in 1954; his father perished and his grave is unknown, but he has a symbolic tombstone at the cemetery.&lt;ref name=kasponis2010/&gt;) He was survived by his wife, Teresa Mary Keane.&lt;ref name=sulgiene/&gt;

== Work ==

=== Early ===
[[File:Costumes Parisiens 1826.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Greimas's thesis was on old Parisian fashion words.]]
Greimas's first published essay ''Cervantes ir jo don Kichotas'' ("[[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]] and his Don Quixote")&lt;ref name=greimas1943/&gt; came out in the literary journal ''Varpai'', which he helped to found, during the period of alternating [[History of Lithuania#World War II (1939–1945)|Nazi and Soviet occupations of Lithuania]]. Although a review of the first Lithuanian translation of ''[[Don Quixote]]'',&lt;ref name=cervantes/&gt; it addressed partly the issue of one's resistance to circumstances&lt;ref name=macianskaite/&gt; – even when doomed, defiance can at least aim at the preservation of one's dignity (''Nebijokime būti donkichotai'', "Let's not be afraid to be Don Quixotes").&lt;ref name=greimas1943/&gt; The first work of direct significance to his subsequent research was his doctoral thesis "La Mode en 1830. Essai de description du vocabulaire vestimentaire d' après les journaux de modes {{sic}} de l'époque" ("Fashion in 1830. A Study of the Vocabulary of Clothes based on the Fashion Magazines of the Times").&lt;ref name=greimas1948/&gt; He left [[lexicology]] soon after, acknowledging the limitations of the discipline in its concentration on the word as a unit and in its basic aim of classification, but he never ceased to maintain his lexicological convictions. He published three dictionaries throughout his career.&lt;ref name=budniakiewicz/&gt; During his decade in Alexandria, the discussions in his circle of friends helped broaden his interests. The topics included Greimas's early influences – the works of the founder of [[structural linguistics]] [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and his follower, Danish linguist [[Louis Hjelmslev]], the initiator of [[comparative mythology]] [[Georges Dumézil]], the [[Structural anthropology|structural anthropologist]] [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], the Russian specialist in fairy tales [[Vladimir Propp]], the researcher into the aesthetics of theater [[Étienne Souriau]], the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologists]] [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], the [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Gaston Bachelard]], and the novelist and art historian [[André Malraux]].&lt;ref name=beliauskas/&gt;

=== Discourse semiotics ===
[[File:Es515 semiotic square.jpg|left|thumb|[[Semiotic square]]]]
Greimas proposed an original method for ''discourse semiotics'' that evolved over a thirty-year period. His starting point began with a profound dissatisfaction with the structural linguistics of the mid-century that studied only phonemes (minimal sound units of every language) and morphemes (grammatical units that occur in the combination of phonemes). These grammatical units could generate an infinite number of sentences, the sentence remaining the largest unit of analysis. Such a molecular model did not permit the analysis of units beyond the sentence.

Greimas begins by positing the existence of a ''semantic universe'' that he defined as the sum of all possible meanings that can be produced by the value systems of the entire culture of an ethno-linguistic community. As the semantic universe cannot possibly be conceived of in its entirety, Greimas was led to introduce the notion of ''semantic micro-universe'' and ''discourse universe'', as actualized in written, spoken or iconic texts. To come to grips with the problem of signification or the production of meaning, Greimas had to transpose one level of language (the ''text'') into another level of language (the ''metalanguage'') and work out adequate techniques of ''transposition''.

The descriptive procedures of ''narratology'' and the notion of ''narrativity'' are at the very base of Greimassian semiotics of discourse. His initial hypothesis is that meaning is only apprehensible if it is articulated or narrativized. Second, for him narrative structures can be perceived in other systems not necessarily dependent upon natural languages. This leads him to posit the existence of two levels of analysis and representation: a ''surface'' and a ''deep level'', which forms a common trunk where narrativity is situated and organized anterior to its manifestation. The signification of a phenomenon does not therefore depend on the mode of its manifestation, but since it originates at the deep level it cuts through all forms of linguistic and non-linguistic manifestation. Greimas' semiotics, which is ''generative'' and ''transformational'', goes through three phases of development. He begins by working out a ''semiotics of action'' (''sémiotique de l'action'') where ''subjects'' are defined in terms of their quest for ''objects'', following a ''canonical narrative schema'', which is a formal framework made up of three successive sequences: a ''mandate'', an ''action'' and an ''evaluation''. He then constructs a ''narrative grammar'' and works out a syntax of ''narrative programs'' in which subjects are ''joined up with'' or ''separated'' from objects of value. In the second phase he works out a ''cognitive semiotics'' (''sémiotique cognitive''), where in order to perform, subjects must be ''competent'' to do so. The subjects' competence is organized by means of a ''modal grammar'' that accounts for their existence and performance. This modal semiotics opens the way to the final phase that studies how ''passions'' modify actional and cognitive performance of subjects (''sémiotique de passions'') and how belief and knowledge modify the competence and performance of these very same subjects.

=== Mythology ===
[[File:Algirdas Julien Greimas 2017 stamp of Lithuania.jpg|thumb|Algirdas Julien Greimas on a 2017 stamp of Lithuania]]

He later began researching and reconstructing [[Lithuanian mythology]]. He based his work on the methods of [[Vladimir Propp]], [[Georges Dumézil]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], and [[Marcel Detienne]]. He published the results in ''Apie dievus ir žmones: lietuvių mitologijos studijos'' (''Of Gods and Men: Studies in Lithuanian Mythology'') 1979, and ''Tautos atminties beieškant'' (''In Search of National Memory'') 1990. He also wrote on [[Proto-Indo-European religion]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7418">'''Anxiety of Influence''' is a type of [[literary criticism]] established by [[Harold Bloom]] in 1973, in his book, ''[[The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry]]''. It refers to the psychological struggle of aspiring authors to overcome the anxiety posed by the influence of their literary antecedents.

== Theory ==

The theory of anxiety of influence is a theory applied principally to early nineteenth century romantic poetry. Its author, Harold Bloom, maintains that the theory has general applicability to the study of literary tradition, ranging from Homer and the Bible to [[Thomas Pynchon]] and [[Anne Carson]] in the 20th and 21st century. It is based primarily on Bloom's belief that there is no such thing as an original poem, that every new composition is simply a misreading or misinterpretation of an earlier poem and that influence is unavoidable and inescapable; all writers inevitably, to some degree, adopt, manipulate or alter and assimilate certain aspects of the content or subject matter, literary style or form from their predecessors.&lt;ref name="Abrams"&gt;{{harvnb|Abrams &amp; Harpham|2009|pp=155–156}}&lt;/ref&gt; To illustrate his point, Bloom quotes Oscar Wilde, noting that:

"Influence is simply transference of personality, a mode of giving away what is most precious to one's self, and its exercise produces a sense, and, it may be, a reality of loss. Every disciple takes away something from his master."&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-6"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|1997|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to universally-held beliefs that the literary influence of precursors can provide a purely benevolent, inspirational platform for young, aspiring writers; Bloom deems that this influence provides entirely the opposite effect.&lt;ref name="Bloom1997"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom}}{{page needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He contends that it proves detrimental; that this influence instills in young writers a type of unease, apprehension or anxiety as they psychologically struggle against past literary forebears to create something definitive and original and achieve literary recognition and success. Bloom equates this struggle to the Freudian family drama; particularly to the Oedipal complex and relationship of son to father, where the emerging writer is cast as the 'son' in a battle against the 'father'; a literary precursor.&lt;ref name="Abrams" /&gt; Bloom claims that this forces poets or authors into a type of 'creative misprision'; where they must distort the works of their literary masters in an attempt to create something revolutionary and innovative.&lt;ref name="Bloom1997" /&gt; The authors who triumph over this struggle are deemed 'strong', with some even receiving acclaim to the extent where the contemporary has the potential to transcend time, with some literary predecessors being read in terms of their contemporary successor. In contrast, writers who cannot prevail over this anxiety of influence are deemed 'weak', with their works regarded as markedly derivative and reminiscent of the works of earlier literary masters. Some great poets in which Bloom draws upon, who have overcome this anxiety of influence include Wordsworth, Shelley and Wallace Stevens.

== Effects on literature ==
In order to determine the effects of this theory on literature, Bloom has established the six "revisionary ratios", which are occasionally based on the model of Freud's defense mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Abrams" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-8"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|1997|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ratios show the developmental stages of anxiety of influence in relation to the ways a poet or author misreads and deforms the work of a literary precursor in the composition of a literary text.&lt;ref name="Geddes"&gt;{{harvnb|Geddes|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Clinamen'' – Bloom defines this as "poetic misreading or misprision proper".&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-14"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|1997|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author makes a swerve away from a precursor, alluding to the proposition that the original work was only precise and accurate up until a particular end; at which point, the successive author makes the corrective motion.&lt;ref name="Geddes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-14" /&gt;  
* ''Tessera'' – Bloom defines this as "completion and antithesis".&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-14" /&gt; The author elaborates upon a precursor's work, maintaining the precursor's terms and ideas but constituting them in another sense, with the implication that the predecessor failed to take the argument far enough in the first instance&lt;ref name="Geddes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-14" /&gt;
* ''Kenosis'' – Bloom defines this as a "breaking device similar to the defence mechanisms our psyches employ against repetition compulsions".&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-14" /&gt; The author seeks a state of discontinuity, in the act of isolating themself from the influence of the precursor&lt;ref name="Geddes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-14" /&gt;
* ''Daemonization'' – Bloom defines this as a "movement towards a personalised Counter-Sublime, in reaction to the precursor's Sublime".&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-15"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|1997|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author manipulates an apparent power of a precursor that they believe is superior to the precursor in an effort to dismiss the originality of the predecessor's work and perpetuate the greatness of their own.&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-15" /&gt;
* ''Askesis'' – Bloom defines this as a "movement of self-purgation which intends the attainment of a state of solitude".&lt;ref name="Bloom1997" /&gt; In this process, the author diminishes both his own and his precursor's achievements, purging themself of all remnants of influence, with a rationale for independent, individual success and achievement.&lt;ref name="Geddes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-15" /&gt;
* ''Apophrades'' – Bloom defines this as the "return of the dead".&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-15" /&gt; The author is encumbered by his previous state of solitude and holds his work open for inspection with that of his predecessors&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-15" /&gt; Geddes 1999). Instead of proving detrimental to the author, this instead has the effect of the successor overpowering the predecessor, with the predecessor's work being read in terms of the successor's work.&lt;ref name="Geddes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-15" /&gt;

'''Aparoksha'''  ([[Sanskrit]]: अपरोक्ष), a Sanskrit adjective meaning not invisible or perceptible,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit de.|url=http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B7&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU }}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to direct intuitive [[Vidya (Knowledge)|knowledge]] which is one of the seven stages of knowledge or conditions of [[Chidabhasa]], the first three being the sources of bondage and the rest four being the processes of liberation; and to the continuation of the deepening of conventional knowledge. It removes sorrows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of the Panchdasi|author=Swami Krishnanda|publisher=The Divine Life Society|url= http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/panch/panch_07.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Indian Philosophy]], the three traditional kinds of knowledge are – ''[[pratyaksha]]'' (empirical), ''[[paroksha]]'' (conventional, universal) and ''aparoksha'' (transcendental).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The Eastern Anthropologist, Vol.49| publisher= Ethnographic and Folk Culture Society|page=103|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H5oiAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=aproksha&amp;dq=aproksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RwW-U7yeHY25uATW4YH4AQ&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwCQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aparoksha'' is the highest kind of knowledge which cannot be gained without the practice of morality that converts ''paroksha'' knowledge from which unity of existence is derived. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Five years of Theosophy| publisher= Theosophical Pub.

Aparoksha is ''[[savikalpa]] jnana'' (knowledge) when one re-recognizes the non-dual nature of the ever-realized Self ([[Tat Tvam Asi]]), it is the immediate knowledge gained through the ''[[pramana]]s''; practice of ''[[Dhyana in Hinduism|Dhyana]]'' (meditation) removes all ''vikalpas'' (varied thoughts) and leads to ''[[nirvikalpa]]'' or the thoughtless state, which is the highest experience, the immediate realization of Truth. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The Wisdom of Sri Dattatreya|author =K.N.Subramanian| publisher= Sura Books| pages= 80,81| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=wbeg45SMdagC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=aproksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RwW-U7yeHY25uATW4YH4AQ&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=aproksha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the method of cessation from individual and collective perception leading to the position of neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyber temple of the Beautiful Lord – The Bhagavata|url= http://www.mahaprabhu.net/bhag2.html  }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sarvam khalvidam Brahman'' (all this is Brahman) is ''paroksha'' knowledge, but the understanding  that ''[[Aham Brahman Asmi]]'' (I am Brahman) is ''aparoksha'' knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Self Knowledge|url= http://www.vijnana.org/2009/04/shravanammananamnidhidhyasanam.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15904">{{Basic Forms of government}}
An '''autocracy''' is a [[Government|system of government]] in which supreme [[power (social and political)|power]] is concentrated in the hands of one person, whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regularized mechanisms of popular control (except perhaps for the implicit threat of a [[coup d'état]] or mass [[insurrection]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auburn.edu/~johnspm/gloss/autocracy |title=Autocracy: A Glossary of Political Economy Terms|author=Paul M. Johnson |publisher=Auburn.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Absolute monarchy|Absolute monarchies]] (such as [[Saudi Arabia]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Oman]], [[Brunei]] and [[Swaziland]]) and [[dictatorships]] (such as  [[Turkmenistan]] and [[North Korea]]) are the main modern-day forms of autocracy.

In earlier times, the term "autocrat" was coined as a favorable feature of the ruler, having some connection to the concept of "lack of conflicts of interests" as well as an indication of grandeur and power. The Russian [[Tsar]] for example was styled, "Autocrat of all the Russians", as late as the early 20th century.

==History and etymology==
Autocracy comes from the Ancient Greek ''autós'' (self) and ''krátos'' (power, strength) from [[Kratos (mythology)|Kratos]], the Greek personification of authority. In the [[Medieval Greek]] [[Greek language|language]], the term ''Autocrates''  was used for anyone holding the title ''emperor'', regardless of the actual power of the [[monarch]]. Some historical Slavic monarchs, such as [[List of Russian rulers|Russian tsars and emperors]], included the title ''Autocrat'' as part of their official styles, distinguishing them from the [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchs]] elsewhere in Europe.

==Comparison with other forms of government==
Both [[totalitarianism]] and [[military dictatorship]] are often identified with, but need not be, an autocracy. Totalitarianism is a system where the state strives to control every aspect of life and civil society. It can be headed by a supreme leader, making it autocratic, but it can also have a [[collective leadership]] such as a commune, [[Military junta|junta]], or single [[political party]].

In an analysis of militarized disputes between two states, if one of the states involved was an autocracy the chance of violence occurring doubled.&lt;ref name="Pinker"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pinker |first=Steven |date=2011 |title=The Better Angels Of Our Nature |p=341 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-141-03464-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin and developments ==
Examples from early modern Europe suggests early statehood was favorable for democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tilly|first1=Charles|title=Western-state Making and Theories of Political Transformation}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, according to Jacob Hariri, outside Europe, history shows that early statehood has led to autocracy.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hariri|first=Jacob|title=The Autocratic Legacy of Early Statehood|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/autocratic-legacy-of-early-statehood/11A9BAFB016B1D89F273DC523B394C7D}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons he gives are: continuation of the original autocratic rule and absence of "institutional transplantation"&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; or European settlement. This may be because of the country's capacity to fight colonization or the presence of state infrastructure that Europeans did not need to build new institutions to rule. In all the cases, representative institutions were unable to get introduced in these countries and they sustained their autocratic rule. European colonization was varied and conditional on many factors. Countries which were rich in natural resources had an extractive and indirect rule, whereas other colonies saw European settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Acemoglu|first1=Daron|last2=Johnson|first2=Simon|last3=A. Robinson|first3=James|title=Reversal of Fortune: Geography and Institutions in the Making of the Modern World Income Distribution.|url=https://economics.mit.edu/files/4127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this settlement, these countries possibly experienced setting up of new institutions. Colonization also depended on factor endowments and settler mortality.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[Mancur Olson]] theorizes the development of autocracies as the first transition from [[anarchy]] to [[State (polity)|state]].  Anarchy for Olson is characterized by a number of "roving bandits" who travel around many different geographic areas extorting wealth from local populations leaving little incentive for populations to invest, and produce. As local populations lose the incentive to produce, there is little wealth for either the bandits to steal or the people to use. Olson theorizes autocrats as "stationary bandits" who solve this dilemma by establishing control over a small fiefdom and monopolize the extortion of wealth in the fiefdom in the form of taxes.  Once an autocracy is developed, Olson theorizes that both the autocrat and the local population will be better off as the autocrat will have an "encompassing interest" in the maintenance and growth of wealth in the fiefdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olson|first=Mancur|date=1993-01-01|title=Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=87|issue=3|pages=567–576|doi=10.2307/2938736|jstor=2938736}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because violence threatens the creation of rents, the "stationary bandit" has incentives to monopolize violence and to create a peaceful order.

[[Douglass North]], John Joseph Wallis and [[Barry R. Weingast]] describe autocracies as limited access orders that arise from this need to monopolize violence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Douglass C. North|last2=John Joseph Wallis|last3=Barry R. Weingast|title=Violence and the Rise of Open-Access Orders|journal=Journal of Democracy|date=2008|volume=20|issue=1|pages=55–68|doi=10.1353/jod.0.0060}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to [[Mancur Olson|Olson]], these scholars understand the early state not as a single ruler, but  as an organization formed by many actors. They describe the process of autocratic state formation as a bargaining process among individuals with access to violence. For them, these individuals form a dominant coalition that grants each other privileges such as the access to resources. As violence reduces the rents, members of the dominant coalition have incentives to cooperate and to avoid fighting. A limited access to privileges is necessary to avoid competition among the members of the dominant coalition, who then will credibly commit to cooperate and will form the state.

==Maintenance==
Because autocrats need a power structure to rule, it can be difficult to draw a clear line between historical autocracies and [[Oligarchy|oligarchies]]. Most historical autocrats depended on their [[Nobility|nobles]], the [[military]], the [[priest]]hood, or other elite groups.&lt;ref name="Tullock"&gt;Tullock, Gordon. "Autocracy", Springer Science+Business, 1987. {{ISBN|90-247-3398-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some autocracies are rationalized by assertion of [[Divine right of kings|divine right]].

According to [[Douglass North]], John Joseph Wallis and [[Barry R. Weingast]], in limited access orders the state is ruled by a dominant coalition formed by a small elite group that relates to each other by personal relationships. In order to remain in power, this elite hinders people outside the dominant coalition to access organizations and resources. Autocracy, then, is maintained as long as the personal relationships of the elite continue to forge the dominant coalition. These scholars further suggest that once the dominant coalition starts to become broader and allow for impersonal relationships, limited access orders can give place to open access orders.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

For [[Daron Acemoglu]], [[Simon Johnson (economist)|Simon Johnson]] and [[James A. Robinson (economist)|James Robinson]], the allocation of political power explains the maintenance of autocracies, which they usually refer to as "extractive states".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Acemoglu|first1=Daron|last2=Johnson|first2=Simon|last3=Robinson|first3=James A.|title=Chapter 6 Institutions as a Fundamental Cause of Long-Run Growth|journal=Handbook of Economic Growth|date=2005|volume=1, Part A|pages=385–472|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574068405010063|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/S1574-0684(05)01006-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For them, the [[de jure]] political power comes from political institutions, whereas the [[de facto]] political power is determined by the distribution of resources. Those holding the political power in the present will design the political and economic institutions in the future according to their interests. In autocracies, both de jure and de facto political powers are concentrated in one person or a small elite that will promote institutions for keeping the de jure political power as concentrated as the de facto political power, thereby maintaining autocratic regimes with extractive institutions.

It has been argued that [[authoritarian]] regimes, such as [[China]] and [[Russia]], have attempted to export their system of government to other countries through "autocracy promotion".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324685104578388550346881268|title=A New Axis of Autocracy|last=Kurlantzick|first=Joshua|date=2013-03-30|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-05-17|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of scholars are skeptical that China and Russia have successfully exported authoritarianism abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tansey|first=Oisín|date=2016-01-02|title=The problem with autocracy promotion|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13510347.2015.1095736|journal=Democratization|volume=23|issue=1|pages=141–163|doi=10.1080/13510347.2015.1095736|issn=1351-0347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Way|first=Lucan|date=2016-01-27|title=Weaknesses of Autocracy Promotion|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/607617|journal=Journal of Democracy|volume=27|issue=1|pages=64–75|doi=10.1353/jod.2016.0009|issn=1086-3214}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brownlee|first=Jason|date=2017-05-15|title=The limited reach of authoritarian powers|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13510347.2017.1287175|journal=Democratization|volume=0|issue=7|pages=1–19|doi=10.1080/13510347.2017.1287175|issn=1351-0347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-6765.12092/abstract|title=The limits of autocracy promotion: The case of Russia in the ‘near abroad’|date=|access-date=|doi=10.1111/1475-6765.12092|volume=54|year=2015|journal=European Journal of Political Research|pages=691–706 | last1 = Way | first1 = Lucan A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical examples ==
'''The [[Roman Empire]]''': In 27 B.C., [[Augustus]] founded the [[Roman Empire]] following the end of the [[Roman Republic]]. Augustus officially kept the [[Roman Senate]] while effectively consolidating all of the real power in himself. Rome was peaceful and prosperous until the dictatorial rule of [[Commodus]] starting in 180 A.D. The third century saw invasions from the barbarians as well as economic decline. Both [[Diocletian]] and [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] ruled as autocratic leaders, strengthening the control of the emperor. The empire grew extremely large, and was ruled by a [[tetrarchy]], instituted by Diocletian. Eventually, it was split into two halves: the Western (Roman) and the Eastern (Byzantine). The Western Roman Empire fell in 476 after civic unrest, further economic decline, and invasions led to the surrender of Romulus Augustus to Odoacer, a German king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/whic/ReferenceDetailsPage/DocumentToolsPortletWindow?displayGroupName=Reference&amp;action=2&amp;catId=&amp;documentId=GALE%257CCX3048600025&amp;source=Bookmark&amp;u=winn16583&amp;jsid=27e1682bb560031bbe2eb2284a8039ed|title=Password Logon Page|website=ic.galegroup.com|access-date=2016-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Aztec Empire]]''': In Mesoamerica, the [[Aztec]]s were a tremendous military powerhouse that earned a fearsome reputation of capturing prisoners during battle to be used for sacrificial rituals. The priesthood supported a pantheon that demanded human sacrifice, and the nobility consisted mainly of warriors who had captured many prisoners for these sacrificial rites. The Aztec Emperor hence functioned both as the sole ruler of the empire and its military forces, and as the religious figurehead behind the empire's aggressive foreign policy.

'''[[Chile]] under the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973-1990)|dictatorship]] of [[Pinochet]]

'''[[Tsardom of Russia|Tsarist]] and [[Empire of Russia|Imperial Russia]]''': Shortly after being crowned as ruler, Tsar Ivan immediately removed his political enemies by execution or exile and established dominance over an Empire, expanding the borders of his kingdom dramatically. To enforce his rule, [[Ivan the Terrible]] established the [[Streltzy]] as Russia's standing army, and he developed two cavalry divisions that were fiercely loyal to the Tsar; the [[Cossacks]], and the [[Oprichniki]]. In his later years, Ivan made orders for his forces to sack the city of [[Novgorod]] in fear of being overthrown. The ideology [[Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality]] was introduced by Emperor [[Nicholas I of Russia]].

'''[[Tokugawa Shogunate]]''': Medieval Japan was caught in a vicious series of skirmishes between warring clans, states, and rulers, all of them vying for power in a mad scramble. While many of these lords struggled against each other openly, [[Ieyasu Tokugawa]] seized mastery of all of Japan through a mix of superior tactics and cunning diplomacy, until he became the dominant power of the land. By establishing his shogunate as the sole ruling power in Japan, Ieyasu Tokugawa and his successors controlled all aspects of life, closing the borders of Japan to all foreign nations and ruling with a policy of isolationism.

'''[[Nazi Germany]]''': After the failed Beer Hall Putsch, the [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]] began a more subtle political strategy to take over the government. Following a tense social and political environment in the 1930s, the Nazis under [[Adolf Hitler]] took advantage of the civil unrest of the state to seize power through cunning propaganda and by the charismatic speeches of their party leader. By the time Hitler was appointed chancellor, the Nazi party began to restrict civil liberties on the public following the Reichstag Fire. With a combination of cooperation and intimidation, Hitler and his party systematically weakened all opposition to his rule, [[Machtergreifung|transforming]] the [[Weimar Republic]] into a fascist dictatorship where Hitler alone spoke and acted on behalf of Germany. Nazi Germany is an example of an autocracy run primarily by a single leader, but many decisions made by Hitler coincided with the interests and ideology of the Nazi Party in mind, also making an example of an autocracy ruled by a political party rather than solely one man.

'''[[Soviet Union]]''': During [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[History of the Soviet Union (1927–1953)|rule]].

'''[[Spain]]''': During [[Francisco Franco]]'s [[Francoist Spain|rule]].

'''Avshalom Cyrus Elitzur''' ({{lang-he-n|אבשלום כורש אליצור}}; born 30 May 1957) is an [[Israel]]i [[physicist]] and [[philosopher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://a-c-elitzur.co.il/uploads/articlesdocs/CV-0310.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930074021/http://a-c-elitzur.co.il/uploads/articlesdocs/CV-0310.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Avshalom Elitzur was born in [[Kerman]], [[Iran]], to a Jewish family. When he was two, his family immigrated to Israel and settled in [[Rehovot]]. He left school at the age of sixteen and began working as a laboratory technician at the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] in Rehovot. Elitzur received no formal university training before obtaining his PhD. 

Elitzur is a senior lecturer at the Unit for Interdisciplinary Studies, [[Bar-Ilan University]], [[Ramat-Gan]], Israel. He is noted for the [[Elitzur–Vaidman bomb-testing problem]] in [[quantum mechanics]], which was publicised by [[Roger Penrose]] in his book ''[[Shadows of the Mind]]''. 

In 1987, he published his book: ''Into the Holy of Holies: Psychoanalytic Insights into the Bible and Judaism''.  During that same year, he was invited to present an unpublished manuscript on quantum mechanics at an international conference in [[Temple University]] in [[Philadelphia]]. Consequently, he was later invited by [[Yakir Aharonov]] of [[Tel Aviv University]], the doyen of physicists in Israel, to write a doctoral thesis on the subject. He was the chief editor of natural sciences in [[Encyclopaedia Hebraica]]. In 2008, he was a visiting professor at [[Joseph Fourier University]].

Elitzur is the founder of the Iyar, The Israeli Institute for Advanced Research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://a-c-elitzur.co.il/site/siteArticle.asp?ar=159 Iyar, The Israeli Institute for Advanced Research (English)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003074204/http://a-c-elitzur.co.il/site/siteArticle.asp?ar=159 |date=October 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elitzur had a relationship with journalist Timura Lessinger, with whom he has a daughter.

==Awards==
In 2010, Elitzur won the Noetic Medal of Consciousness and Brain Research for his contributions to cosmology of mind and Quantum Theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prlog.org/10696155-the-2010-noetic-medal-awarded-to-israeli-physicist-avshalom-elitzur.html The 2010 Noetic Medal awarded to Israeli Physicist Avshalom C.

'''Bernard Ryosuke Inagaki''' (ca. 1928– ) is a [[Japanese philosopher]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] scholar. He has written extensively on medieval philosophy, scholastic philosophy, and philosophy of law; while he is known as one of the leading members for the Japanese translation of [[Summa Theologiæ]]. A number of his works are dedicated to the study of Thomas Aquinas. He received [[Mainichi Shuppan Bunka Shō]] (Mainichi Publishing Prize for Culture) for the translation of [[Summa Theologiæ]] in 2013&lt;ref&gt;[http://pelebo.la.coocan.jp/prizes/various/mshp.htm#list067/ Mainichi Shuppan Bunka Shō 毎日出版文化賞]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Watsuji Tetsurō Bunka Shō]] (Watsuji Tetsurō Prise) for his Thomas Aquinas: Metaphysics of Existence in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city.himeji.lg.jp/bungaku/watsuji/kako1.htm/ Watsuji Tetsurō Bunka Shō  和辻哲郎文化賞] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406064937/http://www.city.himeji.lg.jp/bungaku/watsuji/kako1.htm/ |date=April 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Inagaki graduated from the [[University of Tokyo]] in 1951 and finished his PhD in philosophy at the [[Catholic University of America]] in 1955. After teaching philosophy at [[Nanzan University]], [[Kyushu University]], and [[Fukuoka Jo Gakuin University]], he became a professor of humanities at the [[Nagasaki Junshin Catholic University]]. He claims that his work has been greatly influenced by the study of Aquinas in [[Étienne Gilson]] and [[Jacques Maritain]].

== Education ==

Osburn graduated from [[Harding University]], where he was president of the senior class and received a BA in 1963, with majors in biology and Greek. He received the MTh in 1968 from [[Harding School of Theology]]. After graduating from [[Vanderbilt University]] in 1970 with the DDiv [now DMin] degree, he received his PhD in New Testament and early Byzantine Greek from the University of St. Andrews, Scotland, in 1974.

== Academic career ==

From 1973-1983, Osburn served as Professor of Greek and New Testament at Harding School of Theology.&lt;ref&gt;Harding of Memphis ''Graduate School Bulletin'' 13.8 (Nov. 1974): 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  To students primarily from Churches of Christ for whom the use of scripture was dogmatic proof-texting, Osburn emphasized literary and historical controls to biblical interpretation. Eugene Nida encouraged him to serve as translation consultant for Bible translators among pre-literate people. Utilizing discourse analysis, Osburn conducted numerous short-term, one book workshops for translators in Central and South America in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;“Carroll Osburn.” ''ACU Today'' (Spring, 1996): 13, “Bible Translation Among Pre-Literate People,” ''Image'' 7 (1991): 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also developed sensitivity to humanitarian needs in the Developing World. Adding discourse analysis to literary and historical method led to Greek classes formerly of five or six numbering fifty or sixty. He became a popular speaker at seminars and retreats in the U.S. and around the world. In 1980, he was Visiting Professor at the University of St. Andrews, and in 1983, was named “Educator of the Year” by ''20th Century Christian''.&lt;ref&gt;“Osburn Honored as Educator of the Year,” ''20th Century Christian'' 45.11 (August 1983): 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Osburn became Distinguished Professor of New Testament at Pepperdine University 1983-1987.&lt;ref&gt;“Osburn Assumes Post.” ''The Christian Chronicle'' 40.7 (July 1983): 12, and ''Who’s Who in the World'', 1984-85.&lt;/ref&gt;   Urged by Kurt Aland, Matthew Black, and Bruce Metzger, he concentrated attention on ancient manuscripts underlying the Greek New Testament, and chaired the New Testament Textual Criticism Section of the Society of Biblical Literature 1984-90.

In 1987, Osburn was invited to Abilene Christian University, where he was Carmichel-Walling Distinguished Professor of New Testament Language and Literature until 2004.&lt;ref&gt;“First $1 Million Endowed Chair Established.” ''ACU Today'' 41.4 (Winter, 1990): 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was named “Honors Professor of the Year” in 1992 and 1996, and was Chair of the Faculty Senate in 1999-2000. He was on the Steering Committee of the International Greek New Testament Project on John (Birmingham, England) and co-editor of ''Acts of the Apostles'' in ''Novum Testamentum Graecum Editio Critica Maior'' (Institüt für neutestamentliche Textforschung; Münster, Germany) until 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Tera Harmon, “Carroll D. Osburn,” in ''Transmission and Reception: New Testament Text-Critical and Exegetical Studies''. Texts and Studies, Third Series, Vol. 4. Ed. J. Childers and D. Parker. Piscataway, NJ: Gorgias Press, 2006: 286. Osburn also served as Beirat for the Hermann Kunst-Stiftung at Münster, 2003-2005.&lt;/ref&gt; He was Visiting Professor at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens in 1989, at Universität Münster in 2003, and at Claremont School of Theology in 2008. He did archaeological work with Hebrew University of Jerusalem at the Philistine city of Ekron [Tel Miqne] in 1993. In 2004, he published ''The Text of the Apostolos in Epiphanius of Salamis''.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll Osburn, ''The Text of the Apostolos in Epiphanius of Salamis''. NTGF 6. Leiden, The Netherlands: E. J. Brill, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Osburn was invited frequently to lecture at universities in Europe, Canada, Africa, and South America. He was a member of Association Internationale d’Études Patristiques and continues membership in ''Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas''.&lt;ref&gt;''Firm Foundation'' 100:28 (12 July 1983): 21 [489].&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to challenging fundamentalists to rethink polemical interpretation of biblical texts,&lt;ref&gt;E.g., “Interpreting Greek Syntax.” In ''Biblical Interpretation: Principles and Practices. Studies in Honor of Jack Pearl Lewis''. Grand Rapids, MI: Baker, 1986: 234-243; and “Continuing in Sin–Matthew 19:9,” ACU Lectures. Ed. Carl Brecheen. Abilene, TX: ACU Bookstore, 1982: 131-148.&lt;/ref&gt;  Osburn also worked to expand boundaries of exclusiveness. He was a pioneer within his religious heritage, tackling difficult issues such as dogmatic sectarianism and gender inequality. In 1993, he published ''The Peaceable Kingdom: Essays Favoring Non-Sectarian Christianity'',&lt;ref&gt;E.g., ''The Peaceable Kingdom: Essays Favoring Non-Sectarian Christianity''. Abilene, TX: Restoration Perspectives, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2001, ''Women in the Church: Reclaiming the Ideal''.&lt;ref&gt;''Women in the Church: Reclaiming the Ideal''. Abilene, TX: ACU Press, 2001. See “Prominent Christian Egalitarians,” in en.Wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_egalitarianism. ''Essays on Women in Earliest Christianity''. Ed. Carroll Osburn. 2 Vols. Joplin, MO: College Press, 1993, 1995, is now published by Wipf and Stock.&lt;/ref&gt; He initiated and hosted the annual Carmichael-Walling Lectures at ACU, which brought renowned scholars from around the world to the campus for stimulating lectures and discussion beyond traditional thinking. His challenges to rethink crucial issues met forceful opposition, but with passing of time, were accepted by increasing numbers of moderates. A ''festschrift'' presented to him on his sixty-fifth birthday consists of essays by noted scholars from around the world, some his former students.&lt;ref&gt;Childers and Parker, ''Transmission and Reception'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contract law}}
'''Consideration''' is a concept of [[English law|English]] [[common law]] and is a necessity for simple contracts but not for special contracts (contracts by [[deed]]). The concept has been adopted by other common law jurisdictions, including the US.

The court in ''Currie v Misa'' &lt;ref&gt;''Currie v Misa''  (1875)  LR 10 Ex 893&lt;/ref&gt; declared consideration to be a “Right,  Interest,  Profit,  Benefit, or Forbearance,  Detriment,  Loss,  Responsibility”. Thus, consideration is a promise of something of value given by a promissor in exchange for something of value given by a promisee; and typically the thing of value is goods, money, or an act. Forbearance to act, such as an adult promising to refrain from smoking, is enforceable '''only''' if one is thereby surrendering a legal right.&lt;ref&gt;''Wade v Simeon'' (1846)  2 CB 548&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''White v Bluett''  (1853)  2 WR 75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bronaugh R. (1976). [http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2434&amp;context=wmlr Agreement, Mistake, and Objectivity in the Bargain Theory of Conflict]. ''William &amp; Mary Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Consideration may be thought of as the concept of value offered and accepted by people or organisations entering into [[contract]]s. Anything of value promised by one party to the other when making a contract can be treated as "consideration": for example, if A signs a contract to buy a car from B for $5,000, A's consideration is the $5,000, and B's consideration is the car.

Additionally, if A signs a contract with B such that A will paint B's house for $500, A's consideration is the service of painting B's house, and B's consideration is $500 paid to A. Further, if A signs a contract with B such that A will ''not'' repaint his own house in any other color than white, and B will pay A $500 per year to keep this deal up, there is also consideration. Although A did not promise to affirmatively do anything, A did promise ''not'' to do something that he was allowed to do, and so A did pass consideration. A's consideration to B is the ''forbearance'' in painting his own house in a color other than white, and B's consideration to A is $500 per year. Conversely, if A signs a contract to buy a car from B for $0, B's consideration is still the car, but A is giving no consideration, and so there is no valid contract. However, if B still gives the title to the car to A, then B cannot take the car back, since, while it may not be a valid contract, it ''is'' a valid [[Gift (law)|gift]].

In [[common law]] it is a prerequisite that both parties offer consideration before a contract can be thought of as binding. The doctrine of consideration is irrelevant in many jurisdictions, although contemporary commercial litigant relations have held the relationship between a promise and a deed is a reflection of the nature of contractual considerations. If there is no element of consideration found, there is thus no contract formed.

However, even if a court decides there is no contract, there might be a possible recovery under the doctrines of ''[[quantum meruit]]'' (sometimes referred to as a [[quasi-contract]]) or [[Estoppel#Promissory estoppel|promissory estoppel]].

==Legal rules regarding consideration==
There are a number of common issues as to whether consideration exists in a contract:
# Part payment is not good consideration&lt;ref&gt; ''[[Pinnel's Case]]'' (1602)  5 Co Rep 117a&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; ''[[Jorden v Money]]'' (1854) 5 HLC 185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; ''[[Foakes v Beer]]''  ''([[per incuriam]]?)'' (1884) AC 605&lt;/ref&gt;
# Consideration must move from the promisee but need not flow to the promisor &lt;ref&gt;''[[Tweddle v Atkinson]],, (1861)  1 B&amp;S 393&lt;/ref&gt;
# Consideration must be sufficient but need not be adequate &lt;ref&gt;''[[De la Bere v Pearson]]'' [1908]  1 KB 280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chappell v Nestlés]]'' [1960]  AC 87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Atlantic Baron]]'' [1979]  QB 705  (aka North Ocean Shipping v Hyundai Construction) &lt;/ref&gt; 
# Consideration cannot be illusory 
# Consideration must not be past. Past consideration is not good consideration &lt;ref&gt;''[[Roscorla v Thomas]]'' 	(1842)  3 QB 234&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Re McArdle]]'' 	[1951]  Ch 669&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lampleigh v Braithwaite]]'' 	( 1615) Hob 105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Kennedy v Broun]]''	 (1863)  13 CB (NS) 677&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Re Casey's Patents]]'' (aka  Stewart v Casey)	[1893] 1 Ch 104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Pao On v Lau Yiu Long]]'' 	[1980] AC 614 (PC)&lt;/ref&gt;
# Moral consideration is not sufficient&lt;ref&gt;Except for contracts by deed, where "love and affection" is often cited as the (unnecessary) consideration.&lt;/ref&gt;  
# Performance of existing duties is not good consideration &lt;ref&gt;''[[Stilk v Myrick (1809)  2 Camp 317&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hartley v Ponsonby]]'' (1857)  7 E&amp;B 872&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Glasbrook Bros v Glamorgan CC]]'' [1925]  AC 270&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Williams v Roffey]]'' [1990] 2 WLR 1153&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and comparative law==
Systems based on Roman law (including Germany &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_bgb/englisch_bgb.html#p1008 German Civil Code § 311], accessed 15 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and Scotland) do not require consideration, and some commentators consider it unnecessary and have suggested that the doctrine of consideration should be abandoned,&lt;ref&gt; See: [[Harvey McGregor]]'s [[Contract Code]]&lt;/ref&gt; and estoppel used to replace it as a basis for contracts.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. P.S. Atiyah, 'Consideration: A Restatement' in ''Essays on Contract'' (1986) p.195, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[legislation]], rather than judicial development, has been touted as the only way to remove this entrenched common law doctrine. [[Lord Denning|Lord Justice Denning]] famously stated that "The doctrine of consideration is too firmly fixed to be overthrown by a side-wind".&lt;ref&gt;[[Central London Property Trust Ltd. v. High Trees House Ltd.]] [1947] KB 130&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason that both exist in common law jurisdictions is thought by leading scholars to be the result of the combining by 19th century judges of two distinct threads: first the consideration requirement was at the heart of the action of [[assumpsit]], which had grown up in medieval times and remained the normal action for breach of a simple contract in England and Wales until 1884, when the old forms of action were abolished; secondly, the notion of agreement between two or more parties as being the essential legal and moral foundation of contract in all legal systems, was promoted by the 18th century French writer Pothier in his ''Traite des Obligations'', much read (especially after translation into English in 1805) by English judges and jurists. The latter chimed well with the fashionable will theories of the time, especially [[John Stuart Mill]]'s influential ideas on free will, and got grafted on to the traditional common law requirement for consideration to ground an action in assumpsit.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed and authoritative account of this process, see [[A. W. B. Simpson]], ''A History of the Common Law of Contract: The Rise of the Action of Assumpsit'', ([[Oxford University Press]]: Oxford, 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] systems take the approach that an exchange of promises, or a concurrence of wills alone, rather than an exchange in valuable rights is the correct basis. So if A promises to give B a book, and B accepts the offer without giving anything in return, B would have a legal right to the book and A could not change her mind about giving it to B as a gift. However, in [[common law system]]s the concept of ''[[culpa in contrahendo]]'', a form of [[estoppel]], is increasingly used to create obligations during [[pre-contractual negotiations]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Austotel v Franklins]]'' (1989) 16 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 582&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Waltons HCA"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|7|1988|litigants=[[Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher]] |parallelcite=(1988) 164 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 387 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Estoppel is an [[Equity (law)|equitable doctrine]] that provides for the creation of legal obligations if a party has given another an [[wikt:assurance|assurance]] and the other has relied on the assurance to his [[detriment (law)|detriment]].

==Monetary value of consideration==
Generally, courts do not inquire whether the deal between two parties was monetarily fair&amp;mdash;merely that each party passed some legal obligation or duty to the other party.&lt;ref&gt;''Thomas v Thomas'' (1842)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Woollen Mills HCA"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|20|1954|litigants=Australian Woollen Mills Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth |parallelcite=(1954) 92 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 424 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The dispositive issue is presence of consideration, not adequacy of the consideration. The values between consideration passed by each party to a contract need not be comparable.

For instance, if A offers B $200 to buy B's mansion, luxury sports car, and private jet, there is still consideration on both sides. A's consideration is $200, and B's consideration is the mansion, car, and jet. Courts in the United States generally leave parties to their own contracts, and do not intervene. The old English rule of consideration questioned whether a party gave the ''value of a [[peppercorn (legal)|peppercorn]]'' to the other party. As a result, contracts in the United States have sometimes have had one party pass nominal amounts of consideration, typically citing $1. Thus, licensing contracts that do not involve any money at all often cite as consideration, "for the sum of $1 and other good and valuable consideration."

However, some courts in the United States may take issue with nominal consideration, or consideration with virtually no value. Some courts have since thought this was a sham. Since contract disputes are typically resolved in state court, some state courts have found that merely providing $1 to another is not a sufficiently legal duty, and therefore no legal consideration passes in these kinds of deals, and consequently, no contract is formed. However, this is a minority position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supreme.courts.state.tx.us/historical/2004/dec/030109.htm Supreme Court of Texas (1464-EIGHT, LTD. &amp; MILLIS MANAGEMENT CORP, v. GAIL ANN JOPPICH See section III)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-existing legal duties==
{{main article|Pre-existing duty rule}}
A party that ''already'' has a legal duty to provide money, an object, a service, or a forbearance, does not provide consideration when promising merely to uphold that duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Foakes v Beer |year=1884 |court=UKHL |num=1 |courtname=auto}}; See also {{cite AustLII|NSWSC|1390|2010|litigants=Andrew Hennessey v Architectus Group Holdings Pty Ltd |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|court=EWHC |division=KB |year=1809 |num=J58 |litigants=Stilk v Myrick |parallelcite=(1809) 170 ER 1168}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Wigan v Edwards'' (1973) 1 [[Australian Law Reports|ALR]] 497.&lt;/ref&gt; That legal duty can arise from law, or obligation under a previous contract.

The prime example of this sub-issue is where an uncle gives his seven-year-old nephew (a resident of the US) the following offer: "if you do not smoke cigarettes or marijuana until your 18th birthday, then I will pay you $500". On the nephew's 18th birthday, he tells the uncle to pay up, and the uncle says no.  In the subsequent lawsuit, the uncle wins, because the nephew, by U.S. criminal law, already had a duty to refrain from smoking cigarettes while under 18, or marijuana at any age.

The same applies if the consideration is a performance for which the parties had previously contracted. For example, A agrees to paint B's house for $500, but halfway through the job A tells B that he will not finish unless B increases the payment to $750. If B agrees, and A then finishes the job, B still only needs to pay A the $500 originally agreed to, because A was already contractually obligated to paint the house for that amount.

An exception to this rule holds for [[settlement (litigation)|settlement]]s, such as an [[accord and satisfaction]].  If a creditor has a credit against a debtor for $10,000, and offers to settle it for $5,000, it is still binding, if accepted, even though the debtor had a legal duty to repay the entire $10,000.

Pre-existing duties relating to [[at-will employment]] depend largely on state law.  Generally, [[at-will employment]] allows the employer to terminate the employee for good or even no reason, and allows the employee to resign for any reason.  There are no duties of continued employment in the future.  Therefore, when an employee demands a raise, there is no issue with consideration because the employee has no legal duty to continue working.  Similarly, when an employer demands a pay-cut, there is also no contractual issue with consideration, because the employer has no legal duty to continue employing the worker.  However, certain states require additional consideration other than the prospect of continued employment, to enforce terms demanded later by the employer, in particular, non-competition clauses.

==Bundled terms==
Contracts where a legally valueless term is bundled with a term that does have legal value are still generally enforceable.

Consider the uncle's situation above. If the same uncle had instead told his 17-year-old nephew the following offer: "if you do not smoke cigarettes and do not engage females before your 18th birthday, then I will pay you $500".  On the nephew's 18th birthday, he asks the uncle to pay up, and this time, in the subsequent lawsuit, the nephew may win.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Although the promise of not smoking was not valuable consideration (it was already legally prohibited), virtually all states allow some sort of engagement by minors.  Even though the engagement by minors is legally restricted, there are circumstances where it is legal, and thus the promise to forbear from it entirely has legal value.  However, the uncle would still be relieved from the liability if his nephew smoked a cigarette, even though ''that'' consideration is valueless, because it was paired with something of legal value; therefore, adherence to the entire, collective agreement is necessary.

==Past consideration==
Generally, past consideration is not a valid consideration and has no legal value. Past consideration is consideration that has already flowed from the promisee to the promisor. That is, the promisee's act or forbearance predates the promisor's promise. Past consideration therefore cannot be used as a basis when claiming damages.&lt;ref&gt;see {{cite BAILII|court= EWHC |num=J74 |year=1842 |litigants=Roscorla v Thomas |parallelcite=(1842) 114 ER 496}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An exception to this rule is where there is a duty owed to a third party. 	An act done before the giving of a promise to make a payment or to confer some other benefit can sometimes be consideration for the promise. For this to hold, three conditions must be satisfied (Pao On v Lau Yiu Long [1980]):

# The act must have been done at the promisor’s request
# The parties must have understood the act was to be remunerated either by a payment or the conferment of some other benefit 
# Payment/conferment of the benefit must have been legally enforceable had it been promised in advance

==Option contracts and conditional consideration==
Generally, conditional consideration is valid consideration.

Suppose A is a movie script writer and B runs a movie production company.  A says to B, "buy my script." B says "How about this – I will pay you $5,000 so that you do not let anyone else produce your movie until one year from now.  If I do produce your movie in that year, then I will give you another $50,000, and no one else can produce it.  If I do not produce your movie in that year, then you're free to go."  If the two subsequently get into a dispute, the issue of whether a contract exists is answered.  B had an option contract—he could decide to produce the script, or not. B's consideration passed was the $5,000 down, and the possibility of $50,000.  A's consideration passed was the exclusive rights to the movie script for at least one year.

==In settlements==

Suppose B commits a [[tort]] against A, causing $5,000 in [[compensatory damages]] and $3,000 in [[punitive damages]].  Since there is no guarantee that A would win against B if it went to court, A may agree to drop the case if B pays the $5,000 compensatory damages.  This is sufficient consideration, since B's consideration is a guaranteed recovery, and A's consideration is that B only has to pay $5,000, instead of $8,000.

'''Emotional intimacy''' is an aspect of [[interpersonal relationship]]s that varies in intensity from one relationship to another and varies from one time to another, much like [[physical intimacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Emotional Intimacy: Overlooked Requirement for Survival|last = Dahms|first = Alan M.|publisher = Pruett Publishers|year = 1972|isbn = 978-0871081841|location =|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional intimacy involves a perception of closeness to another that allows sharing of personal feelings, accompanied by expectations of understanding, affirmation, and demonstration of caring.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Description ==
{{Close Relationships}}
Emotional intimacy can be expressed in verbal and [[non-verbal]] communication. The degree of comfort, effectiveness, and mutual experience of [[Proxemics|closeness]] might indicate emotional intimacy between individuals. Intimate [[communication]] is both expressed (e.g. talking) and implied (e.g. friends sitting close on a park bench in silence).

Emotional intimacy depends primarily on [[Trust (sociology)|trust]], as well as the nature of the relationship and the culture in which it is observed. Emotional intimacy is different from sexual intimacy. Sexual intimacy can take place with or without emotional intimacy. Sexual intimacy differs from emotional intimacy because it often does not occur within any kind of sexual context. Emotional intimacy is a psychological event that happens when trust levels and communication between two people are such that it fosters the mutual sharing of one another's deepest selves.  Depending on the background and [[Convention (norm)|conventions]] of the participants, emotional intimacy might involve disclosing [[thought]]s, [[feeling]]s and [[emotion]]s in order to reach an understanding, offer mutual support or build a sense of community. Or it might involve sharing a duty, without commentary.

Deep intimacy requires a high level of transparency and openness. [[Conversation]] is a key point in every emotional intimate relationship. For example, a [[long-distance relationship]] is purely based on conversation. A long-distance relationship can be stronger, in comparison to a normal one, because it forces the two partners to enhance the conversation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jurkane-Hobein|first=Ivet|date=2015|title=Imagining the Absent Partner: Intimacy and Imagination in Long-distance relationships|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.681.6965&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf#page=223|journal=Innovative Issues and appraoches in social sciences|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This involves a degree of vulnerability that can feel uncomfortable or anxiety-producing to many individuals. These feelings do, however, tend to diminish and even dissolve over time and with practice.  Couples who partake in this act of emotional intimacy are able to be more comfortable with each other.  They feel they can share their dreams and their positive characteristics, along with the negative characteristics that they may have.  There are great moments and also tough moments that come along within a relationship.  Emotional intimacy is being able to communicate your feelings to show how much you care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/stronger-the-broken-places/201303/emotional-intimacy|title=Emotional Intimacy|publisher=Psychologytoday.com|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to practice emotional intimacy in relationships. A lack of emotional intimacy could be solved by taking the time to be with your partner throughout the duration of your relationships. Many specialists suggest that talking about problems as soon as they arise is wise to continue emotional intimacy. Being honest, expressing appreciation, and routinely communicating also keeps stable emotional intimacy.

== Link with society ==

=== A social fact ===


The [[interdependence]] between all the individuals contains our [[Political freedom|freedom]]. By maintaining a strong relationship, individuals need to follow written and [[Unspoken rule|unwritten rules]] to permit a [[community]] life. They also ask for services to different people to fulfill the mandatory aspects of their life. It is impossible for an individual to occupy all the positions in [[society]] that he or she needs, to be able to live in this society. So, the individual is constantly forced to be dependent of people that he or she did not choose or has selected by default. But, according to [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], the individual chooses with whom to have an intimate relationship, and thus can have more freedom and choice to be "ourselves".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Everyday Friendships: Intimacy as Freedom in a Complex World|last=Blatterer|first=Harry|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This freedom is even more important because it allows the individual not to be the subject of public property or of private secrecy. The emotional intimacy can be seen as a bubble, an exception which permits to separate the individual. Paradoxically, this intimacy, with [[Love]] for example, creates a stronger [[self-confidence]] which is developed by a process of [[socialization]]. So emotional intimacy also permits to be easily integrated in society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The individual stays dependent of the social process because the intimate relationships can be framed by society. For example, a family or a couple needs to declare their status and follow government laws.

Being more emotionally invested in a relationship than the other partner can be considered as a loss of [[Power (social and political)|power]]. Emotional intimacy can also enhance the physical and physiologic [[well-being]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Sinclair, Development and validation of the Emotional Intimacy Scale, {{ISSN|1061-3749}}, Vol 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The individual is stronger to be a part of the social process and thus, he can have a more powerful impact to make evolve the values’ system of the society. Emotional intimacy can be shared with not just your partner in life, but with friends, family, colleagues, even pets.

Emotional intimacy is difficult to create because of social barriers or norms. For example, emotional intimacy between men is hard to create owing to the role of [[masculinity]] in society: the competition pressure, the fear of vulnerability, being [[Homophobia|homophobe]]. Men have a lot of best friends of the same sex but a big majority discuss important topics and decisions with their female friends. Society determines or at least has a strong influence on the building of an emotional intimate relationship.

=== Emotional Intimacy Scale ===

The 5-item Emotional Intimacy Scale (EIS) is a scale which enables to evaluate the emotional intimacy in a relationship. Its goal is to predict the different outcomes produced by the existence of an intimate relationship.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This scale is created with a study of different items which are fundamental components of an intimate relationship. Some persons need to answer to a questionnaire. They answer to judge the degree of truth of each of these components in comparison with their actual situation. There are five of them: 
*  This person completely accepts me as I am
*  I can openly share my deepest thoughts and feelings with this person
*  This person cares deeply for me
*  This person would willingly help me in any way
*  My thoughts and feelings are understood and affirmed by this person
These results are putting in correlation with specific values which characterize an individual such as psychological and physical well-being, social support, and health.

The results provided by the scale prove a positive relationship between an increase of EIS and an increase for the individual of social support, self-efficiency, life satisfaction and other positive effects. It also shows the negative relation between a decrease of EIS and an increase of stress, pain, and fatigue for the individual. An intimate relationship gives a sentiment of purpose and belonging which increases the physiological and psychological well-being.

'''Enrique Fidel Verástegui Peláez ''' (24 April 1950 – 27 July 2018), was a Peruvian author and mathematician. With his first book, ''In the extramural of the world'' (1971), he was regarded as one of the most important poets of Latin America&lt;ref name="telesurtv"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Peruvian-Rebel-Poet-Enrique-Verastegui-Dead-at-68-20180728-0012.html|title=Peruvian Rebel Poet Enrique Verastegui Dies Aged 68 &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; teleSUR English|website=telesurtv.net|accessdate=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080508204248/http://www.educared.edu.pe/estudiantes/literatura/verastegui.htm Poemas de Enrique Verástegui] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and co-founded the Zero Hour Movement, together with the poets: Jorge Pimentel, Juan Ramírez Ruiz, Jorge Nájar, Enriqueta Belevan and Carmen Ollé.&lt;ref&gt;[https://elcomercio.pe/luces/libros/enrique-verastegui-poeta-peruano-reconocido-fallecio-68-anos-noticia-540859 Reconocido poeta peruano Enrique Verástegui falleció a los 68 años] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://christianul.blogspot.com/2012/11/entrevista-enrique-verastegui-por-raul.html ENTREVISTA A ENRIQUE VERÁSTEGUI POR RAÚL HERAUD.] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born on 24 April 1950 in the city of [[Lima]], but grew up in the city of [[San Vicente de Cañete]]. He finished his secondary studies at G.U.E. José Buenaventura Sepúlveda of said city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rpp.pe/cultura/literatura/la-poesia-peruana-de-luto-fallecio-enrique-verastegui-noticia-1139653 La poesía peruana de luto: Falleció Enrique Verástegui] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moved to Lima, he studied economics, administration and accounting at the National University of San Marcos. In 1975 he recorded his poems for the [[Library of Congress|Library of Congress of the United States]] and worked for [[El Colegio de México]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ecured.cu/Enrique_Ver%C3%A1stegui Enrique Verástegui.] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1976 he received the [[Guggenheim Fellowship]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serperuano.com/2017/04/enrique-verastegui/ Enrique Fidel Verástegui] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, he founded Hora Zero Internacional in Paris with José Carlos Rodríguez and André Laude and writes his book ''The Motor of Desire'' (''El motor del deseo'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartoneracohuina.blogspot.com/2014/08/entrevista-enrique-verastegui-por-paul.html Entrevista a Enrique Verástegui por Paul Guillén] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1978, representing the [[Peru]]vian community, he reads his poems before the tomb of [[César Vallejo]], which earned him the congratulations of [[Julio Ramón Ribeyro]], consul of Peru to [[UNESCO]]. In 1992 he published his novel trilogy, entitled ''Terceto de Lima''. In 1999 he wrote ''Pro-total Apology: Essay on Stephen Hawkings'', the Peruvian equivalent of the ''[[Novum Organum]]'' by [[Francis Bacon]], which suggests original developments of algebra, and which is recommended by the  Library of Congress of the United States. He also invents the Scientific Research Method of pre-duction, which is superior to induction and the deduction. He also publishes ''El Modelo del Teorema'' (''The model of the theorem'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://lancomperu.wordpress.com/2013/11/15/enrique-fidel-verastegui-pelaez-referencias/ Enrique Fidel Verástegui Peláez, referencias] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Equinet''' is the '''European Network of Equality Bodies'''. It serves as a professional platform for cooperation, capacity building and peer support amongst equality bodies around the legal interpretation and implementation in practice of the EU equal treatment Directives and around the promotion of equality and the elimination of discrimination.&lt;ref name="Equinet"&gt;{{cite web|last=Equinet|title=Strategic Plan 2015-2018|url=http://www.equineteurope.org/spip.php?action=telecharger&amp;arg=1754&amp;type=application.pdf|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Equinet currently consists of 46 Equality Bodies from 34 different European countries. Members of Equinet have been established on the basis of the [[List of European Union directives#Anti-discrimination measures|EU equal treatment Directives]] and they are empowered to counteract discrimination across the range of grounds including [[Ageing|age]], [[disability]], [[gender]], [[Race (human classification)|race]] or [[ethnic origin]], [[religion]] or [[belief]], and [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref name="age-platform"&gt;{{cite web|last=AGE|title=Factsheet on Equinet|url=http://www.age-platform.eu/images/stories/EN/pdf_AGE_Factsheet_on_Equinet-2.pdf|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Equinet builds upon the two-year project "''Strengthening the co-operation between specialised bodies for the implementation of equal treatment legislation''" (2002-2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gunda Werner Institute|title=Institutions Of The EU Commission And Parliament|url=http://www.gwi-boell.de/web/eu-gender-politics-institutions-eu-commission-3055.html|accessdate=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The initiative to create a network of equality bodies was taken by the Migration Policy Group,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Migration Policy Group|title=Migration Policy Group|url=http://www.migpolgroup.com/|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who also acted as Equinet's Secretariat until 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Migration Policy Group|title=Project: Equality bodies|url=http://www.migpolgroup.com/projects_detail.php?id=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Equinet was established as an independent structure in 2007 with the creation of the Equinet Secretariat in Brussels and its registration as a not-for-profit international association ([[AISBL]]) under [[Belgian law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=European Commission|title=EU action against discrimination Activity report 2007-08|url=http://www.igfse.pt/upload/docs/gabdoc/2009/Novidades/07-Jul/EU%20action%20against%20discrimination_Activity%20report%202007-08.pdf|accessdate=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
Equinet is the European network of equality bodies. The network promotes equality in Europe through supporting and enabling the work of national equality bodies. It supports equality bodies to be independent and effective as valuable catalysts for more equal societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Equinet|title=Equinet at a Glance|url=http://www.equineteurope.org/-About-us-|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Apart from being a platform for exchange among member equality bodies, Equinet contributes to the wider European debate on matters of equal-treatment and non-discrimination by sharing the experience of equality bodies through so-called perspectives aimed at equality experts and policy-makers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=SIPU International|title=Review of EU Networks for Civil Society Organizations|url=http://zaklada.civilnodrustvo.hr/upload/File/hr/izdavastvo/digitalna_zbirka/eu_networks.pdf|accessdate=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Equinet attempts to strengthen the voice and contributions of national equality bodies to the wider European equality debate. Equinet's input in advancing equality is achieved by:&lt;ref name="Equinet Strategic Plan 2015-2018"&gt;{{cite web|last=Equinet Webpage|title=Strategic Plan 2015-2018|url=http://www.equineteurope.org/spip.php?action=telecharger&amp;arg=1754&amp;type=application.pdf|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Building capacity and peer support of equality bodies
*Contributing to the European equality agenda
*Serving as a knowledge and communication hub on equal treatment 
*Consolidating the network and the position of its members

Equinet is an umbrella organisation for European equality bodies and has no mandate to provide any kind of legal assistance to individual victims of discrimination. The organisation however provides contact details (see next section) for equality bodies based in all EU members states and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=AGE|title=Factsheet on Equinet|url=http://www.age-platform.eu/images/stories/EN/pdf_AGE_Factsheet_on_Equinet-2.pdf|accessdate=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   EU anti-discrimination legislation provides that each Member State shall have (at least) one such equality body with the power to, among other, give independent assistance to victims of discrimination. The equality bodies are specialised authorities whose staff are trained and experienced to handle cases of discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=ENAR - European Network Against Racism|title=What you can do if you are a victim of racial/ethnic discrimination|url=http://www.enar-eu.org/Page_Generale.asp?DocID=29966&amp;lb=3884|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
Most Equinet members belong to the [[European Union]], while six equality bodies come from outside the European Union ([[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Norway]] and [[Serbia]]).

==Organizational Structure==

===Governance===

====General Assembly of Members====

The main decisions concerning the general direction of Equinet are taken by the [[Popular assembly|General Assembly]] of Members. This assembly is made up of all the members of the network and is convened at least once a year for an annual general meeting (AGM). The General Assembly has the power to approve new members and, following a nomination process by members, to vote for representatives on the Executive Board etc.&lt;ref&gt;Equinet ''Annual Report 2013''. 2014, p. 16.{{cite web|title=Annual Report 2013|url=http://www.equineteurope.org/spip.php?action=telecharger&amp;arg=1671&amp;type=application.pdf|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Executive Board====

Management and administration of the network is delegated to the [[Executive Board]]. The Board is also responsible for the preparation and implementation of the AGM’s decisions. Executive Board Members, the advisor to the Board and the treasurer receive no salary for their input.&lt;ref&gt;Equinet ''Annual Report 2013'', p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

====Working Groups====

[[Working groups]] are composed of staff from member organisations and led by a moderator. Working groups are the main medium for the sharing of expertise between different equality bodies. There were four Equinet Working Groups in 2015:&lt;ref&gt;Equinet ''Working Groups''.{{cite web|title=Equinet Working Groups|url=http://www.equineteurope.org/-Thematic-Working-Groups-|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Existential phenomenology''' is [[Martin Heidegger]]'s brand of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (1998): [https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/phenomenological-movement/existential-phenomenology "Phenomenological movement: 4. Existential phenomenology].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In contrast with his former mentor [[Edmund Husserl]], Heidegger (in his ''[[Being and Time]]'') put [[ontology]] before [[epistemology]] and thought that phenomenology would have to be based on an observation and analysis of ''[[Dasein]]'' ("being-there"), human being, investigating the fundamental ontology of the ''Lebenswelt'' ([[lifeworld]], Husserl's term) underlying all so-called regional ontologies of the special sciences. In Heidegger's philosophy, people are thrown into the world in a given situation, but they are also a project towards the future, possibility, freedom, wait, hope, anguish.&lt;ref&gt;Farina, Gabriella (2014). [http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A14-07.pdf Some reflections on the phenomenological method.] ''Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences'', '''7'''(2):50–62.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast with the philosopher [[Kierkegaard]], Heidegger wanted to explore the problem of ''Dasein'' existentially (''existenzial''), rather than [[existentiell]]y (''existenziell'') because Heidegger argued Kierkegaard had already described the latter with "penetrating fashion".{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Development==
Besides Heidegger, other existential phenomenologists were [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Karl Jaspers]], [[Emmanuel Levinas]], [[Gabriel Marcel]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Frantz Fanon]],  [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Enzo Paci|it}} and [[Samuel Todes]].

==Other disciplines==
Existential phenomenology extends also to other disciplines. For example, [[Leo Steinberg]]'s essay "[[The Philosophical Brothel]]" describes Picasso's ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' in a perspective that is existential-phenomenological. It has also impacted [[architectural theory]], especially in the phenomenological and Heideggerian approaches to space, place, dwelling, technology, etc.&lt;ref&gt;This is evident in the works of [[Christian Norberg-Schulz]], as for example is the case with his book: ''Genius Loci, Towards a Phenomenology of Architecture'' (New York: Rizzoli, 1980), or more recently with the numerous papers of [[Nader El-Bizri]] such as his paper: 'On Dwelling: Heideggerian Allusions to Architectural Phenomenology', ''Studia UBB Philosophia'' Volume 60 (2015): 5–30. This is also felt with the practices of architects in the [[Phenomenology (architecture)]] movement&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Forrest Yoga''' is a modern [[yoga]] style based on [[Hatha yoga]]. It was created by and named for [[Ana T. Forrest]], an American [[yogini]].&lt;ref name="Fierce Medicine"&gt;{{cite book|last=Forrest|first=Ana T.|title=Fierce Medicine|year=2011|publisher=Harper One|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-186424-7|url=http://harpercollins.com/books/Fierce-Medicine-Ana-T-Forrest/?isbn=978-0-06-186424-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known for "its long holding of positions, emphasis on abdominal core work, and standing series that can go on for 20 poses on each side".&lt;ref name = "Billard"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/31/nyregion/in-forrest-yoga-guardians-of-a-mission-to-heal.html "Yoga Guardians on a Healing Mission,"] by Mary Billard, NYTimes, July 29, 2011,&lt;/ref&gt; Reputed for its intensity, the style emphasizes connecting to one's feelings in order to work through physical and emotional trauma.&lt;ref name="Houston Chronicle 2009"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cook|first=Lynn|title=Forrest yoga challenges with added intensity|url=http://www.chron.com/life/article/Forrest-yoga-challenges-with-added-intensity-1744808.php|publisher=[[Houston Chronicle]]|accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Forrest derived her practice from some aspects of [[Sivananda yoga]], along with attention to alignment and use of props found in [[Iyengar yoga]], and the heat and flowing sequences of [[Ashtanga vinyasa yoga]]. As the style evolved, she created a number of additional poses and sequences adapted to modern society,&lt;ref name = "Billard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aloft"&gt;"Firefly, Frog and other Yoga Positions Good Aloft", by Ana Forrest, ''New York Times'', June 20, 2006, [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/20/business/20flier.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
such as wrist stretches to prevent and relieve [[carpal tunnel syndrome]].  Forrest wrist stretches are also important "to warm up and stretch out the hands and wrists before their usual yoga practice. First, stretch each finger open one at a time, by grasping the finger and pulling it back for one breath. You should feel the stretch in the fingers and across the palm and a little into the forearm. Next, place all of the fingers on the floor or a table with the fingertips facing toward your torso. Stretch the fingers, but not the palm of the hand, down toward the surface. From that position, see if you can stretch the whole palm down, though you may not make it the whole way. Finally, extend the arms straight out from your shoulders, parallel to the floor. Curl the fingers one by one into the palm, starting with the little finger and ending with the thumb, forming a fist. First, curl the fist in toward the underside of the wrist and then stretch it out. Repeat this exercise a few times before you put weight on your hands." &lt;ref name="Yoga as Medicine: the Yogic Prescription for Health and Healing"&gt;{{cite book|last=McCall MD|first=Timothy|title=Yoga as Medicine:the Yogic Prescription for Health and Healing|year=2007|publisher=Bantam Dell|location=New York|ISBN=978-0-553-38406-2|pages=237–238}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also created [[shoulder]] shrugs to relieve tension and loosen the upper back,&lt;ref name="shrugs"&gt;"Shrugs: A Pose for all Seasons and Reasons," by Barbara Passy, "Yoga Chicago", May–June, 2014.[http://yogachicago.com/2014/05/shrugs-a-pose-for-all-reasons-and-seasons]&lt;/ref&gt; [[abdominal]] exercises to tone internal organs and strengthen the lower back, and a number of poses using a folded over and rolled up yoga mat.&lt;ref name="FY Philo" /&gt;

Forrest Yoga classes are conducted in a warm room ({{convert|85|F|disp=or}})&lt;ref name="Anchorage Press 2012"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dobbyn|first=Paula|title=Ana Forrest: Rock star of the yoga world|url=http://www.anchoragepress.com/news/ana-forrest-rock-star-of-the-yoga-world/article_389d9b30-ed65-11e1-8546-001a4bcf887a.html|publisher=Anchorage Press|accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and begin with [[pranayama]], then move through seated poses and abs before arriving on to the "hot part" of the class that might involve [[Surya Namaskara|sun salutations]], standing poses, inversions, backbends and other [[Asana|asanas]] that build up to a number of more challenging "apex" poses. The "contemplative, intensive poses are sustained, some for 10 deep breaths, others for minutes at a time".&lt;ref name="Liu"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/articles/2010/01/21/introduction_to_yoga_is_a_breath_of_fresh_air/?page=2|title=Om my!|last=Liu|first=Christine|date=January 21, 2010|work=Boston Globe|accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Forrest Yoga's vision and mission is "to mend the hoop of the people".&lt;ref name="Fierce Medicine" /&gt;{{rp|257}} &lt;ref name="Creating Embodiment"&gt;"Creating Embodiment: An Interview with Ana Forrest", by Eva Norlyk Smith, Ph.D., ''HuffPost'', February 12, 2015, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eva-norlyk-smith-phd/ana-forrest-creating-embo_b_6654906.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Ana T. Forrest wrote, "I began to read about [[Black Elk]], a healer and [[Medicine Man]] of the [[Oglala Lakota]] [[Sioux]]. He's best known for sharing the teachings of the Sioux with a white man named [[John Neihardt]] (who earned the name Flaming Rainbow), who published them as ''[[Black Elk Speaks]]''. In that book, he shared a powerful vision he'd received through a 'rainbow door' when he was nine years old, about his mission to protect a '[[medicine wheel]]' around a sacred tree on the 'good red road' that is the true good medicine of the native peoples. At the time Black Elk had his vision, the assault on the traditions of the Sioux was well under way; their culture and Spirit were dying out. Black Elk proclaimed, 'The Rainbow Hoop of the People has been broken.' He wanted to restore it, and this became his life's work...reading about Black Elk's life's work  helped me to articulate my own—I call it Mending the Rainbow Hoop of the People."&lt;ref name="Fierce Medicine" /&gt;{{rp|171}}   In this style, "the healing aspect of Forrest Yoga extends to the emotional body. Students are encouraged to breathe into tight spots or places where they feel stagnant energy in order to free up emotional issues that may be stored there."&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Steffensen, "Ana Forrest: Mending the Hoop of the People", ''Yoga Chicago'', November/December 2003, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

The style is founded on four principles, or "pillars":&lt;ref name = "Liu" /&gt;
# '''Breath''', to help connect in feeling with one's body and ignite passion for living
# '''Strength''', via intense core sequences and long holds of poses that generate heat and heighten the senses
# '''Integrity''', in working with the edges of one's practice, particularly around physical and emotional injuries, developing tools to deal with fear and struggle
# '''Spirit''', to create a sense of freedom and "courage to walk as your Spirit dictates"&lt;ref name="FY Philo"&gt;{{cite web|last=Forrest|first=Ana|title=Forrest Yoga Philosophy|url=http://www.forrestyoga.com/about/philosophy.php|publisher=Mossy Knolls Inc.|accessdate=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sources cite a fifth pillar exemplified by the style's [[motto]], "Go Deeper".&lt;ref name="Jakarta Do Yoga"&gt;{{cite web|title=Workshops with Ana Forrest — First time in Jakarta, Indonesia!|url=http://jakartadoyoga.com/index.php?option=com_eventlist&amp;Itemid=4&amp;func=details&amp;did=36|publisher=jakartadoyoga|accessdate=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic Moves==

Forrest Yoga's physical practice uses a number of "basic moves" in every pose up until [[Savasana]].&lt;ref&gt;"Yoga for Healing," by Melissa B.Williams, Fit Yoga, February, 2006, p.22&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these moves resemble those practiced in other yoga styles, such as [[Ujjayi breath]] and tucking the [[tailbone]], while others are unique to this style, particularly the practice of relaxing the neck and wrapping the shoulders. Overall emphasis is on breath work and core strengthening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/275428341.html?dids=275428341:275428341&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jan+08%2C+2003&amp;author=LAURA+BAGINSKI&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=Be+a+swinger+%3B+Treadmills+have+you+running+in+circles%3F+Try+these+offbeat+ways+to+get+in+shape.&amp;pqatl=google|title=Be a swinger ; Treadmills have you running in circles? Try these offbeat ways to get in shape.|last=Baginski|first=Laura|date=January 8, 2003|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#'''Active Hands and Active Feet''': For Active Hands, spread hand bones wide and extend finger bones fully to benefit arms, wrists and hands. For Active Feet, press through heels and balls of feet and lift toes to help strengthen the lower half of the body. "&lt;ref&gt;Ana Forrest, "Choosing Healing is the Ultimate Warrior Action", ''Origin Magazine'', December/January 2012, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Tuck Tailbone''': Turn on glutes in order to lengthen tailbone downward. Takes pressure off of lower back.
#'''Telescope Ribs''': Place hands on lower part of rib cage and inhale to lift ribcage away from belly. Helps to create space in back and in soft organs as well as increasing breath capacity.
#'''Expand Ribs''': Place hands on sides of ribs and inhale so that the ribs move like an accordion—outward on inhale and inward on exhale. Enhances breath capacity.
#'''Wrap Shoulders''': Move shoulder blades around toward armpits. Ensures shoulder girdle involvement and in poses using arms, creates muscle awareness in upper back and shoulders, conditions that part of your body.&lt;ref name="Chicago Shoulders"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sadtler, RYT|first=BJ|title=Understanding Your Shoulders|url=http://www.yogachicago.com/mar05/shoulders.shtml|publisher=Yoga Chicago|accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Relax Neck''': Gently relax ear toward shoulder and keep neck relaxed during other poses. Opens up muscles that are typically tense and engaged.
#'''Deep breathing''': Provides more aliveness to the entire body. &lt;ref&gt;"Healing PTSD Through a New Kind of Yoga", by Ana Forrest, ''HuffPost'', May 15, 2011 [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ana-forrest/yoga-ptsd_b_862188.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another part of Forrest Yoga practice is development of feeling connections between one part of the body and another. As Forrest noted, "I call this synaptic bridging. Synaptic bridging helps the brain make more intelligent mind-body connections."&lt;ref&gt;Ana Forrest, "Choosing Healing is the Ultimate Warrior Action", ''Origin Magazine'', December/January 2012, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:OSH gift card.jpg|thumb|Gift card for a US hardware store]]

A '''gift card''' (also known as '''gift certificate''' in North America, or '''gift voucher''' or '''gift token''' in the UK&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/gift-token|title=GIFT TOKEN {{!}} meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|last=|first=|date=|website=Cambridge Dictionary|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a prepaid [[stored-value card|stored-value money card]] usually issued by a [[retailer]] or [[bank]] to be used as an alternative to cash for purchases within a particular store or related businesses. Gift cards are also given out by retailers and marketers as part of a promotion strategy, to entice the recipient to come in or return to the store, and at times such cards are called '''cash cards'''. Gift cards are generally redeemable only for purchases at the relevant retail premises and cannot be cashed out, and in some situations may be subject to an expiry date or fees. Visa and MasterCard credit cards produce generic gift cards which need not be redeemed at particular stores, and which are widely used for '''cashback''' marketing strategies. A feature of these cards is that they are generally anonymous and are disposed of when the stored value on a card is exhausted.

From the purchaser's point of view, a gift card is a [[gift]], given in place of an object which the recipient may not need, when the giving of cash as a present may be regarded as socially inappropriate. In the [[United States]], gift cards are highly popular, ranking in 2006 as the second-most given gift by consumers and the most-wanted gift by women, and the third-most wanted by males.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Gift cards have become increasingly popular as they relieve the donor of selecting a specific gift.&lt;ref name=consumer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2006/02/gift_cards_congress.html |title=Congress Considers New Gift Card Rules |author=James R.

==History==
{{refimprove|date=June 2012}}
The first giftcard using a payments infrastructure was introduced by [[Neiman Marcus]] in late 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Buchanan|first=Matt|title=The Vile History of Gift Cards and How They Came to Destroy Christmas|url=https://gizmodo.com/5434783/the-vile-history-of-gift-cards-and-how-they-came-to-destroy-christmas|publisher=Gizmodo|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;, though [[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster Entertainment]] was the first company to do so at a wide scale&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CES/NaBANCO introduces stored value card technology; Blockbuster Video is first merchant partner|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/CES%2fNaBANCO+introduces+stored+value+card+technology%3b+Blockbuster...-a017787941|publisher=Business Wire|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, test-marketing them in 1995 and launching them around the country the next year. In the beginning, the Blockbuster giftcard replaced gift certificates that were being counterfeited with recently introduced color copiers and color printers. Blockbuster's first giftcard transactions were processed by what was then Nabanco of [[Sunrise, Florida]]. Nabanco was the developer of the first third-party platform for the processing of giftcards using existing payment infrastructure.

Neiman Marcus and Blockbuster were later followed by the [[Mobil]] gas card which initially offered prepaid phone value provided by [[MCI Inc.|MCI]]. [[Kmart]] was next with the introduction of the Kmart Cash Card which in the early generations provided prepaid phone time with [[AT&amp;T]]. Later this feature was dropped as it was not profitable for both Kmart and Mobil. The Kmart Mags Pangilinan Cash Card was the first replacement for cash returns when a shopper did not have a receipt for a gift. This practice of giving a cash card in place of cash for non-receipted returns is common place today with most merchants. From these early introductions, other retailers began to adapt a giftcard program to replace their gift certificate programs.

==Function and types==
[[File:Gift card assortment.jpg|300px|thumb|right|An assortment of gift cards, many from U.S. national retailers such as [[Best Buy]], [[Target Corporation|Target]] and [[Home Depot]].]]
A gift card may resemble a [[credit card]] or display a specific theme on a plastic card the size of a credit card. The card is identified by a specific number or code, not usually with an individual name, and thus could be used by anybody. They are backed by an on-line electronic system for authorization. Some gift cards can be reloaded by payment and can be used thus multiple times.

Cards may have a [[barcode]] or [[magnetic strip]], which is read by an electronic credit card machine. Many cards have no value until they are sold, at which time the cashier enters the amount which the customer wishes to put on the card. This amount is rarely stored on the card but is instead noted in the store's database, which is crosslinked to the card ID. Gift cards thus are generally not [[stored-value card]]s as used in many public transport systems or library photocopiers, where a simplified system (with no network) stores the value only on the card itself. To thwart counterfeiting, the data is [[encrypted]]. The magnetic strip is also often placed differently than on credit cards, so they cannot be read or written with standard equipment. Other gift cards may have a set value and need to be activated by calling a specific number.

Gift cards can also be custom tailored to meet specific needs. By adding a custom message or name on the front of the card, it can make for an individualized gift or incentive to an employee to show how greatly they are appreciated.

Gift cards are divided into "open loop" or "network" cards and "closed loop" cards. The former are issued by banks or credit card companies and can be redeemed by different establishments, the latter by a specific store or restaurant and can be only redeemed by the issuing provider. The latter, however, tend to have fewer problems with card value decay and fees.&lt;ref name="consumerreports"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consumerreports.org/holiday-shopping/tips-for-giving-gift-cards/|title=Avoid gift card pitfalls|date=December 2007}} accessed 06-16-2008&lt;/ref&gt; In either case the giver would buy the gift card (and may have to pay an additional purchase or activation fee), and the recipient of the card would use the value of the card at a later transaction. A third form is the "hybrid closed loop" card where the issuer has bundled a number of closed loop cards; an example is free gift cards for a specific [[shopping mall|mall]].

Gift cards differ from [[scrip|gift certificate]]s, in that the latter are usually sold as a paper document with an authorized signature by a restaurant, store, or other individual establishment as a [[voucher]] for a future service; there is no electronic authorization. A gift certificate may or may not have an expiration date and generally has no administrative fees.

Bank-issued gift cards may be used in lieu of checks as a way to disburse [[rebate (marketing)|rebate]] funds. Some retailers use the gift card system for refunds in lieu of cash thereby assuring that the customer will spend the funds at their store.

A [[Charity gift card|Charity Gift Card]] allows the gift giver to make a charitable donation, and the gift recipient to choose a charity that will receive the donation.

===Mobile and virtual gift cards===
[[File:App Store Gift Card by Zihexin.jpg|thumb|An [[app store]] gift card display in a shop]]

Mobile gift cards are delivered to mobile phones via [[email]] or [[SMS]] and phone apps allow users to carry only their cell phone. Benefits include tying them to a particular phone number and ease of distribution.

Virtual gift cards are delivered via e-mail to the recipient, the benefits being that they cannot be lost and that the consumer does not have to drive to the bricks and mortar location to purchase a gift card.

Other companies have introduced virtual gift cards that users redeem on their smartphones. As the merchant is not involved in the loop, it is considered a cash transfer rather than a traditional gift card.

==Pitfalls==
It has been argued that holiday giving destroys value due to mismatching gifts.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/07/magazine/07wwln_freak.t.html?ex=1325826000&amp;en=970d53de24147ae4&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss | author=Stephen J. Dubner and Steven D. Levitt | title=The Gift-Card Economy | date=January 7, 2007 | publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most efficient way to keep value in gifting would be to give cash; however, this is socially acceptable only within limits. Gift cards, to a degree, may overcome this problem but have certain pitfalls. Some feel that the absence of the thought of selecting a specific gift makes a gift card a worse choice than a poorly executed but individual gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2006/12/bad_gift.html | title=Bad Gift Better Than Gift Card, Says Philosopher | date=2006-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; New products in the gift card industry are evolving to tackle this "impersonal" pitfall of gift cards. New services launched by some service providers allows for customization and personalization of gift cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_45/b4057049.htm | work=BusinessWeek | title=Gift Cards with a Personal Touch | date=November 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gift cards have been criticized for the ability of the issuer to set rules that are detrimental to the purchaser or card recipient. For example, gift cards may be subject to an expiry date, administrative fees, restrictions on use, and absence of adequate protection in case of fraud or loss.&lt;ref name=consumer/&gt; Over time fees may render the value of a gift card zero. However, these issues have been addressed in recent years in some jurisdictions. In the [[United States]], many jurisdictions limit or prohibit all fees or expiration dates for gift cards. Further, because of the negative impact on sales that such policies can have, most merchants have adopted and even advertise a "no fee, no expiration" policy for their gift cards, whether or not state laws require it. In 2011, an estimated 2.5% of gift cards were subject to an expiration date and 2.7% to post-sale fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scripsmart.com/gift_card_report_2011 |title=ScripSmart 2011 Gift Card Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A quarter of gift card recipients still have not spent gift cards a year after receiving them, according to a Consumer Reports survey. And a majority of people say they end up spending more than the value of the card once they get to the store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97016449 |title=Gift Card Warning: Check Retailer's Health |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=2013-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event of the bankruptcy of the issuing retailer, the outstanding value on gift cards is considered [[unsecured debt]], and as such gift cards may become valueless.&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97016449 | author=Tamara Keith | title=Gift Card Warning: Check Retailer's Health | date=2008-11-17 | publisher=[[NPR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the company intends to continue trading, gift cards may be honoured even in bankruptcy.

Another issue regarding gift cards are the growing concerns from retailers and other businesses about what can be done to prevent gift cards from being exploited by fraudsters. Gift card information can either be stolen from their rightful owners by fraudsters or they can be purchased with stolen credit card information. In recent years, cybercriminals have increased their efforts to take advantage of fraudulent gift cards as they are simple to exploit with automated brute-force bot attacks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.csoonline.com/article/3196035/fraud/what-not-to-get-mom-for-mother-s-day.html | work=CSO Online | title=What Not To Get Mom For Mother's Day | date=May 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The most common form of gift card fraud is committed through the act of stealing card information for activated cards with an existing balance by attacking a retailer’s systems which store gift card data. Once a gift card has been compromised, the fraudster will then check the balance through online customer portals before using the funds or reselling on the secondary gift card market&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2017/03/17/prevent-fraud-brute-force-online-coupon-gift-card-attacks/| work=Digital Commerce 360 from Internet Retailer | title=How to prevent fraud from brute force online coupon and gift card attacks | date=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Redemption rate==
{{main article | breakage }}
Not all gift cards are redeemed. The card may be lost; there may be time decay (expiration and fees) or complex rules of redemption; the recipient may not be interested in the store that accepts the card or be under the false assumption that not using it will save money for the giver. It has been estimated that perhaps 10% of cards are not redeemed, amounting to a gain for retailers of about $8 billion in the United States in 2006.&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt;

In 2012, over $100 billion in gift cards will be purchased in the United States, where over 20% of those gift cards will go unredeemed or unused. This has amassed a large opportunity in the secondary market, similar to the secondary ticket market in the early 2000s. Some companies have created a business in the secondary gift card market that allow consumers to sell their unused gift cards or buy discounted gift cards to their favorite brands. This has helped their users recoup their share of some $55 million per day that goes unredeemed in the United States every year, by turning their unused gift cards into cash.

==Regulations==

=== Canada ===
All Canadian provinces have legislations passed to ban expiry dates and fees collected on gift cards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.financialpost.com/2012/02/27/gift-cards-come-with-regulations/ Gift cards come with regulations]&lt;/ref&gt; However, provincial gift card legislations do not apply to sectors that are regulated under federal laws. For example, gift cards that resemble credit cards (i.e. with Visa, MasterCard or American Express branding) and phone cards are regulated by the federal government. Under the federal ''Prepaid Payment Products Regulations'', effective May 1, 2014, federally regulated gift cards may only charge maintenance fees under certain conditions, and may not set an expiry date for funds on those cards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/Eng/about/news/Pages/News-nouvelles.aspx?itemid=249 Prepaid Payment Products Regulations published in the Canada Gazette]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
In the past, uniform standards concerning gift cards did not exist. This was set to change as an addendum to the [[Credit CARD Act of 2009]] directs the federal government to create consumer-friendly standards pertaining to gift cards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-627 Read The Bill: H.R. 627 [111th]. GovTrack.us. Retrieved on 2011-12-03.&lt;/ref&gt; Most notably, the new regulations prohibit retailers from setting expiration dates unless they are at least 5 years after the card’s date of issue or the date on which funds were last added to the card. In addition, retailers are no longer able to assess dormancy, inactivity, or service fees unless the card has been inactive for at least 12 months, and if fees are added after that period, the details of such fees must be clearly disclosed on the card. Additionally, retailers are unable to levy more than one fee per month. The new provisions took effect on August 22, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wkow.com/Global/story.asp?S=12188430 Fed issues new gift card regulations – WKOW 27: Madison, WI Breaking News, Weather and Sports]. Wkow.com (2010-03-23). Retrieved on 2011-12-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

Open loop cards are governed by rules of the [[Comptroller of the Currency]], however oversight has been criticized.&lt;ref name=consumer/&gt; Closed loop gift cards are subject to rules set by different state regulations, and issuing authorities vary widely in the rules they set for the consumer.&lt;ref name=consumer/&gt; Rules can be changed by the issuer without notifying the consumer.&lt;ref name=consumerreports/&gt;&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt;

The '''Imcheon Seowon''' is a ''[[seowon]]'' located in the neighborhood of Songhyeon-dong of [[Andong]], [[North Gyeongsang Province]], [[South Korea]]. Seowon is a type of local [[academy]] during the [[Joseon Dynasty]] (1392–1897). It was first established  by local [[Confucian]] scholars in 1607, the 40th year of [[Seonjo of Joseon|King Seonjo]]'s reign, to commemorate the scholarly achievement and virtue of the Confucian scholar and politician [[Kim Seong-il]] (金誠一 1538-1593).&lt;ref&gt;{{ko}} [http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=255307&amp;v=44 임천서원 臨川書院] [[Nate (web portal)|Nate]] / [[EncyKorea]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ko}} [http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?i=235142 김성일 金誠一] [[Nate (web portal)|Nate]] / [[EncyKorea]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Indrasnet.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A 3D rendering of Indra's net.]]
'''Indra's net''' (also called '''Indra's jewels''' or '''Indra's pearls''', [[Sanskrit]] ''Indrajāla'') is a [[metaphor]] used to illustrate the concepts of [[Śūnyatā]] (emptiness),{{sfn|Jones|2003|p=16}} [[pratītyasamutpāda]] (dependent origination),&lt;ref name="Lee_2005_473" &gt;{{harvnb|Lee|2005|p=473}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Buddhist_philosophy#Huayan|interpenetration]]&lt;ref name="Odin_1982_17" &gt;{{harvnb|Odin|1982|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Buddhist philosophy]].

The metaphor was developed by the [[Mahayana|Mahayana school]] in the 3rd century ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra]]'' and later by the [[Huayan school]] between the 6th and 8th centuries.{{sfn|Jones|2003|p=16}}

==Avatamsaka Sutra==
[[File:Indras Net-02.png|thumb|right|250px]]
{{Main|Indra|Avatamsaka Sutra|Huayan school}}

"Indra's net" is an infinitely large net of cords owned by the [[Vedic]] [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]] [[Indra]], which hangs over his palace on [[Mount Meru]], the [[axis mundi]] of Buddhist and Hindu cosmology. In this metaphor, Indra's net has a multifaceted jewel at each vertex, and each jewel is reflected in all of the other jewels.{{sfn|Kabat-Zinn|2000|p=225}} 

In the [[Huayan school]] of [[Chinese Buddhism]], which follows the [[Avatamsaka Sutra]], the image of "Indra's net" is used to describe the interconnectedness of the universe.{{sfn|Kabat-Zinn|2000|p=225}} Francis H Cook describes Indra's net thus:

{{quote|Far away in the heavenly abode of the great god Indra, there is a wonderful net which has been hung by some cunning artificer in such a manner that it stretches out infinitely in all directions. In accordance with the extravagant tastes of deities, the artificer has hung a single glittering jewel in each "eye" of the net, and since the net itself is infinite in dimension, the jewels are infinite in number. There hang the jewels, glittering "like" stars in the first magnitude, a wonderful sight to behold. If we now arbitrarily select one of these jewels for inspection and look closely at it, we will discover that in its polished surface there are reflected ''all'' the other jewels in the net, infinite in number. Not only that, but each of the jewels reflected in this one jewel is also reflecting all the other jewels, so that there is an infinite reflecting process occurring.{{sfn|Cook|1977}}}}

The Buddha in the [[Avatamsaka Sutra]]'s 30th book states a similar idea:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:If untold buddha-lands are reduced to atoms,
:In one atom are untold lands,
:And as in one,
:So in each.
:The atoms to which these buddha-lands are reduced in an instant are unspeakable,
:And so are the atoms of continuous reduction moment to moment
:Going on for untold eons;
:These atoms contain lands unspeakably many,
:And the atoms in these lands are even harder to tell of.&lt;ref&gt;Cleary. The Flower Ornament Scripture A Translation of the Avatamsaka Sutra, 1993, page 891-92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Book 30 of the sutra is named "The Incalculable" because it focuses on the idea of the [[infinitude]] of the universe and as Cleary notes, concludes that "the cosmos is unutterably infinite, and hence so is the total scope and detail of knowledge and activity of enlightenment."&lt;ref&gt;Cleary. The Flower Ornament Scripture A Translation of the Avatamsaka Sutra, 1993, page 44&lt;/ref&gt; In another part of the sutra, the Buddhas' knowledge of all phenomena is referred to by this metaphor:

&lt;blockquote&gt;They [Buddhas] know all phenomena come from interdependent origination.
They know all world systems exhaustively. They know all the
different phenomena in all worlds, interrelated in Indra's net.&lt;ref&gt;Cleary. The Flower Ornament Scripture A Translation of the Avatamsaka Sutra, 1993, page 925.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In Huayan texts==
The metaphor of Indra's net of jewels plays an essential role in the Chinese Huayan school,{{sfn||Cook|1977|p=2}} where it is used to describe the interpenetration (Wylie: ''zung-'jug''; Sanskrit: yuganaddha) of microcosmos and macrocosmos.{{sfn|Odin|1982|p=16-17}} The Huayan text entitled "Calming and Contemplation in the Five Teachings of Huayan" (Huayan wujiao zhiguan 華嚴五教止觀, T1867) attributed to the first Huayan patriarch [[Dushun]] (557–640) gives an extended overview of this concept:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The manner in which all dharmas interpenetrate is like an imperial net of
celestial jewels extending in all directions infinitely, without limit. … As for the imperial net of heavenly jewels, it is known as Indra’s Net, a net which is made entirely of jewels. Because of the clarity of the jewels, they are all reflected in and enter into each other, ad infinitum. Within each jewel, simultaneously, is reflected the whole net. Ultimately, nothing comes or goes. If we now turn to the southwest, we can pick one particular jewel and
examine it closely. This individual jewel can immediately reflect the image
of every other jewel. 
As is the case with this jewel, this is furthermore the case with all the rest of the jewels–each and every jewel simultaneously and immediately reflects each and every other jewel, ad infinitum. The image of each of these limitless jewels is within one jewel, appearing brilliantly. None of the other jewels interfere with this. When one sits within one jewel, one is simultaneously sitting in all the infinite jewels in all ten directions. How is this so? Because within each jewel are present all jewels. If all jewels are present within each jewel, it is also the case that if you sit in one jewel you sit in all jewels at the same time. The inverse is also understood in the same way. Just as one goes into one jewel and thus enters every other jewel while never leaving this one jewel, so too one enters any jewel while never leaving this particular jewel.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Alan. The Practice of Huayan Buddhism, http://www.fgu.edu.tw/~cbs/pdf/2013%E8%AB%96%E6%96%87%E9%9B%86/q16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The Huayan Patriarch [[Fazang]] (643–712) used the golden statue of a lion to demonstrate the Huayan vision of interpenetration to empress Wu:{{sfn|Odin|1982|p=17}}

{{quote|In each of the lion's eyes, in its ears, limbs, and so forth, down to each and every single hair, there is a golden lion. All the lions embraced by each and every hair simultaneously and instantaneously enter into one single hair. Thus, in each and every hair there are an infinite number of lions... The progression is infinite, like the jewels of Celestial Lord Indra's Net: a realm-embracing-realm ad infinitum is thus established, and is called the realm of Indra's Net.{{sfn|Odin|1982|p=17}}}}

==Atharva Veda==
According to Rajiv Malhotra, the earliest reference to a net belonging to Indra is in the [[Atharvaveda|Atharva Veda]] (c. 1000 [[BCE]]).{{sfn|Malhotra|2014|p=4-5, 210}} Verse 8.8.6. says: 
{{quote|Vast indeed is the tactical net of great Indra, mighty of action and tempestuous of great speed. By that net, O Indra, pounce upon all the enemies so that none of the enemies may escape the arrest and punishment.{{sfn|Ram|2013|p=910}}}}

And verse 8.8.8. says:
{{quote|This great world is the power net of mighty Indra, greater than the great. By that Indra-net of boundless reach, I hold all those enemies with the dark cover of vision, mind and senses.{{sfn|Ram|2013|p=910-911}}}}

The net was one of the weapons of the sky-god Indra, used to snare and entangle enemies.{{sfn|Beer|2003|p=154}} The net also signifies [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] or [[Maya (illusion)|illusion]].{{sfn|Debroy|2013}} According to Teun Goudriaan, Indra is conceived in the Rg Veda as a great magician, tricking his enemies with their own weapons, thereby continuing human life and prosperity on earth.{{sfn|Goudriaan|1978|p=211}} Indra became associated with earthly magic, as reflected in the term ''indrajalam'', "Indra's Net", the name given to the occult practices magicians.{{sfn|Goudriaan|1978|p=211}} According to Goudriaan, the term ''indrajalam'' seems to originate in verse 8.8.8 from the Atharva Veda, of which Goudriaan gives a different translation:{{sfn|Goudriaan|1978|p=214}}
{{quote|This world was the net of the great Sakra (Indra), of mighty size; by means of this net of Indra I envelop all those people with darkness.{{sfn|Goudriaan|1978|p=214}}}}

According to Goudriaan, the speaker pretends to use a weapon of cosmical size.{{sfn|Goudriaan|1978|p=214}} The net being referred to here 
{{quote|...was characterized there as the ''antariksa-'', the intermediate space between heaven and earth, while the directions of the sky were the net's sticks (''dandah'') by means of which it was fastened to the earth. With this net Indra conquered all his enemies.{{sfn|Goudriaan|1978|p=214}}}}

==Modern &amp; Western references==
[[File:Dewy_spider_web.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dewy_spider_web.jpg|thumb|"Imagine a multidimensional spider's web in the early morning covered with dew drops. And every dew drop contains the reflection of all the other dew drops.  And, in each reflected dew drop, the reflections of all the other dew drops in that reflection. And so ad infinitum. That is the Buddhist conception of the universe in an image." –[[Alan Watts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast|url=http://www.alanwattspodcast.com/index.php?post_id=373289|title=Alan Watts Podcast – Following the Middle Way #3|website=alanwattspodcast.com|date=2008-08-31|accessdate=|accessyear=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===''Gödel, Escher, Bach''===
In ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'' (1979), [[Douglas Hofstadter]] uses Indra's net as a metaphor for the complex interconnected networks formed by relationships between objects in a system—including [[social network]]s, the interactions of particles, and the "[[Symbolic interactionism|symbols]]" that stand for [[idea]]s in a [[brain]] or [[Artificial intelligence|intelligent computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last1 =  Hofstadter| first1 = Douglas R.  | authorlink = Douglas Hofstadter  | title = [[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]  | publisher = Basic Books  | year = 1999  | page = 266  | isbn = 0-465-02656-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Vermeer's Hat''===
In ''[[Vermeer's Hat]]'' (2007), a history book written by [[Timothy Brook]], the author uses the metaphor:
{{quote| Buddhism uses a similar image to describe the interconnectedness of all phenomena. It is called Indra's Net. When Indra fashioned the world, he made it as a web, and at every knot in the web is tied a pearl. Everything that exists, or has ever existed, every idea that can be thought about, every datum that is true—every dharma, in the language of Indian philosophy—is a pearl in Indra's net. Not only is every pearl tied to every other pearl by virtue of the web on which they hang, but on the surface of every pearl  is reflected every other jewel on the net. Everything that exists in Indra's web implies all else that exists.&lt;ref name="VH(p22)"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;!--end quote--&gt;
Writing in ''[[The Spectator]]'', Sarah Burton explains that Brook uses the metaphor, and its interconnectedness, 
{{quote|to help understand the multiplicity of causes and effects producing the way we are and the way we were [...] In the same way, the journeys through Brook's picture-portals intersect with each other, at the same time shedding light on each other.&lt;ref name="Spectator-Burton"&gt;{{cite web | last = Burton | first = Sarah | title = The Net Result | publisher = ''[[The Spectator]]'' | date = 2 August 2008 | url = http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/866241/part_2/the-net-result.thtml | accessdate = 2010-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===''Indra's Net: Defending Hinduism's Philosophical Unity''===
In ''[[Indra's Net (book)|Indra's Net]]'' (2014), [[Rajiv Malhotra]] uses the image of Indra's net as a metaphor for
{{quote|
the profound cosmology and outlook that permeates Hinduism. Indra's Net symbolizes the universe as a web of connections and interdependences [...] I seek to revive it as the foundation for Vedic cosmology and show how it went on to become the central principle of Buddhism, and from there spread into mainstream Western discourse across several disciplines.{{sfn|Malhotra|2014|p=4}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4297">'''Jay Frank Rosenberg''' (April 18, 1942, [[Chicago]] – February 21, 2008, [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]]) was a Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].

==Biography==
Rosenberg was a student of [[Wilfrid Sellars]] and established his reputation with ten books and over 80 articles in metaphysics, epistemology, the philosophy of language, and the history of philosophy (especially [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]). His most commercially successful work, ''The Practice of Philosophy: A Handbook for Beginners'', is a standard text in introductory philosophy courses, and has been translated into German.

Rosenberg's first publication, ''The Impoverished Students' Book of Cookery, Drinkery, and Housekeepery!'', written while an undergraduate at [[Reed College]], has since been republished and is available from the Reed College bookstore.  Also while at Reed, Rosenberg was a keen observer and commenter of the tabletop game ''Empire'', though he never played.

In 1966, Rosenberg appeared as himself on the May 9, 1966 episode of ''[[To Tell The Truth]]'' where he was introduced, along with two imposters as the author ''The Impoverished Students' Book of Cookery, Drinkery, and Housekeepery!''.  [[Tom Poston]] was the only panelist to correctly identify Rosenberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=CBS Television|title=To Tell the Truth|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSxQ3_mqutQ|website=You Tube|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosenberg won almost $50,000 on the television game show ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' in 1986 and returned for the program's [[Jeopardy! Ultimate Tournament of Champions|Ultimate Tournament of Champions]].

[[File:Jean Louis Herrenschneider.jpg|thumb|J.-L.-A. Herrenschneider by Strintz, 1834 (Koch Hall, St.Thomas' Chapter Collection, Strasbourg)]]
'''Jean-Louis-Alexandre Herrenschneider''' (German: '''Johann-Ludwig-Alexander Herrenschneider''')(23 March 1760 – 4 February 1843{{ref label|Alpha|α|Death date as on tomb; in some texts death date is 29 January 1843 (see Gérold}}) was a philosopher, mathematician, astronomer, physicist, meteorologist and lawyer.

==Early life and family==
He was born in [[Gaugrehweiler]] ('Grehweiler' in biographical texts and personal documentation) in the Rhineland [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]] to Marguerite Salomé Walter and [[:de:Johannes Herrenschneider|Jean Herrenschneider]]. His father was a grammar-school principal, then a protestant court pastor and ecclesiastical inspector for [[:de:Carl Magnus von Rheingrafenstein|Carl Magnus von Rheingrafenstein]], the last count of the Gaugrehweiler line. In 1773, in a murder attempt on his father, his ten-year-old sister was shot to death as the family sat to dinner; his father was badly injured; his beloved sister's death, and his father's survival – which he considered miraculous – had a lifelong effect on him. The attacker was later found to be a subordinate of his father, one Pastor Valentin, who later took his own life. It was later suggested during the investigation that his father's authoritarian nature might have been a contributory factor to the crime. Because of this incident, the family moved to [[Ribeauvillé]], in the [[Alsace]] region, where his father again became a pastor. In 1777, the family moved to [[Strasbourg]] where his father became deacon at [[Saint Thomas Church (Strasbourg)|St.Thomas' Church]] and later a pastor at [[Saint Aurelia’s Church, Strasbourg|Saint Aurelia’s Church]]. His uncle, Johann Samuel Herrenschneider, was a professor of mathematics at the [[University of Strasbourg]].

==Career==
Herrenschneider enrolled at the University of Strasbourg and studied mathematics and astronomy under [[:fr:Jean-Jérémie Brackenhoffer|Johann Jeremias Brackenhofer]]. On 26 September, 1782, he gained his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] with the dissertation ''"On Consciousness."'' On the death of his uncle in 1784, he took over his mathematics lectures at the university in October that year. He studied law at his father's behest and became licensed to practise in 1785.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite-web|url=https://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/suche?filter%5B0%5D%5Bfacet_publisher%5D=Lorenzius%20%26amp%3B%20Schulerus&amp;filter%5B1%5D%5Bfacet_creator_personal%5D=Herrenschneider%2C%20Johann%20Ludwig%20Alexander&amp;filter%5B2%5D%5Bfacet_place_publish%5D=Argentorati|last=Herrenschneider|first=Johann Ludwig Alexander|title=

In 1789, he was called to chair of astronomy, taking his recently-deceased former professor Brackenhofer's role.&lt;ref name=Gérold&gt;{{cite book|last=Gérold|first=Charles Thomas|title=La Faculté de théologie et le Séminaire protestant de Strasbourg (1803–1872): une page de l'histoire de l'Alsace|publisher=Librarie Istra|location=Strasbourg|year=1923|url=https://archive.org/stream/lafacultdeth00gruoft/lafacultdeth00gruoft_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt;

His professorship commenced with a tour of European observatories: he met [[William Herschel]], [[Nevil Maskelyne]], [[Dominique, comte de Cassini|Jean-Dominique Cassini]], [[Jérôme Lalande]], [[Jean Sylvain Bailly]] and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]]. On his return to Strasbourg in 1791, the university was closed as a result of the [[French Revolution]]. He taught physics, chemistry and mathematics in various local schools. During the [[Reign of Terror]] he was arrested along with his father, [[:fr:Isaac Haffner|Isaak Haffner]] and [[:fr:Jean Laurent Blessig|Johann Lorenz Blessig]] and others – for refusing to renounce their faith – until the [[9th Thermidor]] and the execution of [[Maximilien Robespierre]]. From 1795 to 1798 he was an examiner for ''l'École centrale des travaux publics'', subsequently ''[[École Polytechnique|L'École polytechnique]]'', a newly-founded centralised organisation, and he was also on the commission for new weights and measures. During 1796 and 1797 he was a member of the Jury of Instruction for the reorganisation of the Central School of the ''département'' of [[Bas-Rhin]]; he became professor of experimental physics and chemistry at the same school in 1800 until its closure three years later.&lt;ref name=Gérold/&gt;&lt;ref name="Leonore"/&gt;

In 1803, he was one of the founding educators at the [[:fr:Séminaire protestant de Strasbourg|Protestant Seminary of Strasbourg]], along with Haffner and Blessig (all former professors of the University of Strasbourg who were still alive became professors at the new Seminary). There, Herrenschneider was initially a professor of philosophy. In 1807, he became a curator of the public library of the town and the seminary. From 1809, he was professor of experimental mathematical physics in the Faculty of Science at the Royal Academy of Strasbourg, a post he held until 1829. In 1808, his teaching of mathematics at the Seminary was challenged by a fellow professor, [[Christian Kramp]], who was teaching science there and regarded Herrenschneider's Academy role as competition and threatened to denounce him to the Seminary director. Herrenschneider decided to restrict himself to the teaching of logic and metaphysics at the Seminary, which he openly admitted were not his strengths: "I believe I have understood Plato and Aristotle, Bacon and Descartes, Locke and Leibnitz, Kant and Jacobi, Fichte and as far as Schelling, but I do not understand anything about Hegel." By 1812, he was vice-director of the Seminary. &lt;ref name="Leonore"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gérold/&gt;

During his career, he collected 40 years of meteorological data, which was published and compared with similar data from Paris, including air pressure, humidity and temperature, magnetic-north direction, wind direction, rainfall, intensity of thunderstorms and the temperature a few metres below ground.&lt;ref name="Sarus Fargeaud"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Bulletin universel des sciences mathématiques, astronomiques, physiques et chimiques|last=Herrenschneider|first=Louis|title=Resumé des observations météorologiques faites à Strasbourg, en 1824 et 1825|volume=3|publisher=M. Le Bon de Férrusac|year=1825|location=|pages=115-116|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1823, he founded a society to help young people freed from prison.&lt;ref name="Sarus Fargeaud"/&gt; He was a much-loved teacher and was celebrated by his students, colleagues and the city burghers for his charitable and philanthropic works. A poem was written for his golden jubilee by [[:fr:Ehrenfried Stoeber|Ehrenfried Stoeber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k9400760g|website=gallica.bnf.fr|last=Stoeber|first=Ehrenfried|title=Eine Blume zur Jubelfeier unsers verehrungswuerdigen Mitbuergers, Herren Professors Herrenschneider|access-date=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A painting by Strintz was commissioned in his honour in 1823.&lt;ref name=Gérold/&gt; He was made a knight of the [[Legion of Honour]] on 29th April 1838.&lt;ref name="Leonore"/&gt; 

From 1839, his health began to fail. In 1843, he died and was buried in a tomb at St.Thomas' Church in Strasbourg. A bust of Herrenschneider stands before it.&lt;ref name=Gérold/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4374">{{For|the German entrepreneur Max Baginski|Leo Maximilian Baginski}}
'''Max Baginski''' (1864&amp;nbsp;– November 24, 1943) was a [[German-American]] [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[revolutionary]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rebal.info/vufind/Author/Home?author=Baginski+%2C+Max Max Baginski  Max Baginski (1864 – November 24, 1943) was a German-American anarchist revolutionary.]&lt;/ref&gt;
==Early life==
Baginski was born in 1864 in [[Bartenstein]] (now [[Bartoszyce]]), a small [[East Prussia]]n town. His father was shoemaker who had been active in the [[1848 revolution]] and was thus shunned by the conservative inhabitants of the village. Under his fathers influence, Baginski read [[Freethought|freethinker]] [[August Specht]]'s writings and ''[[Berliner Freie Presse]]'', [[Johann Most]]'s newspaper, in his youth. After school Baginski became his father's apprentice.

Already a staunch socialist, Baginski moved to [[Berlin]] in 1882. He emigrated to the [[United States|U.S.]] in 1893.

==Professional career==

From 1894 to 1901, he was an editor of the ''[[Chicago Worker]]'' newspaper. He helped publishing the 1906-07 issues of the magazine ''[[Freedom (newspaper)|Freedom]]'' and editorials for the anarchist magazine ''[[Mother Earth (magazine)|Mother Earth]]'' in [[New York City]].
This is a quote from the first issue of Mother Earth Magazine. {{Quotation|The State Socialists love to assert that at present we live in the age of individualism; the truth, however, is that individuality was never valued at so low a rate as to-day. Individual thinking and feeling are incumbrances and not recommendations on the paths of life. Wherever they are found on the market they meet with the word "adaptation." Adapt yourself to the demands of the reigning social powers, act the obedient servant before them, and if you produce something be sure that it does not run against the grain of your "superiors," or say adieu to success, reputation and recompense. Amuse the people, be their clown, give them platitudes about which they can laugh, prejudices which they hold as righteousness and falsehoods which they hold as truths. Paint the whole, crown it with regard for good manners, for society does not like to hear the truth about itself. Praise the men in power as fathers of the people, have the devourers of the common wealth parade along as benefactors of mankind. Of course, the force which humbles humanity in this manner is far from openly declaring itself as force. It is masked, and in the course of time it has learned to step forward with the least possible noise. That diminishes the danger of being recognized. ''Without Government'', By Max Baginski, 1906&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26600/26600-h/26600-h.htm ''Mother Earth Vol 1 No 1 March 1906'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Death==
Baginski died at [[Bellevue Hospital]] in New York on November 24, 1943.

'''Michel Aflaq''' ({{lang-ar|ميشيل عفلق}}&amp;lrm;, {{IPA-ar|miːʃeːl ʕaflaq}}, 9 January 1910 – 23 June 1989) was a Syrian philosopher, [[sociology|sociologist]] and [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalist]]. His ideas played a significant role in the development of [[Ba'athism]] and its political movement; he is considered by several Ba'athists to be the principal founder of Ba'athist thought. He published various books during his lifetime, the most notable being ''[[The Battle for One Destiny]]'' (1958) and ''The Struggle Against Distorting the Movement of Arab Revolution'' (1975).

Born into a middle-class family in [[Damascus]], Syria, Aflaq studied at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], where he met his future political companion [[Salah al-Din al-Bitar]]. He returned to Syria in 1932, and began his political career in [[Communism|communist politics]]. Aflaq became a communist activist, but broke his ties with the communist movement when the [[Syrian–Lebanese Communist Party]] supported France's colonial policies. Later in 1940 Aflaq and al-Bitar established the [[Arab Ihya Movement]] (later renaming itself the ''Arab Ba'ath Movement'', taking the name from [[Zaki al-Arsuzi]]'s group by the [[Arab Ba'ath|same name]]). The movement proved successful, and in 1947 the Arab Ba'ath Movement merged with al-Arsuzi's Arab Ba'ath organisation to establish the [[Ba'ath Party|Arab Ba'ath Party]]. Aflaq was elected to the party's executive committee and was elected "'Amid" (meaning the party's leader).

The Arab Ba'ath Party merged with [[Akram al-Hawrani]]'s [[Arab Socialist Party]] to establish the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party in 1952; Aflaq was elected the party's leader in 1954. During the mid-to-late 1950s the party began developing relations with [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], the [[President of Egypt]], which eventually led to the establishment of the [[United Arab Republic]] (UAR). Nasser forced Aflaq to dissolve the party, which he did, but without consulting with party members. Shortly after the UAR's dissolution, Aflaq was reelected as Secretary General of the National Command of the Ba'ath Party. Following the [[8th of March Revolution]], Aflaq's position within the party was weakened to such an extent that he was forced to resign as the party's leader in 1965. Aflaq was ousted during the [[1966 Syrian coup d'état]], which led to a schism within the Ba'ath Party. He escaped to [[Lebanon]], but later went to Iraq. In 1968 Aflaq was elected Secretary General of the [[Ba'ath Party (Iraqi-led faction)|Iraqi-led Ba'ath Party]]; during his tenure he held no ''de facto'' power. He held the post until his death on 23 June 1989.

Aflaq's theories about society, economics, and politics, which are collectively known as Ba'athism, hold that the [[Arab world]] needs to be unified into one [[Arab Nation]] in order to achieve an advanced state of development. He was critical of both capitalism and communism, and critical of [[Karl Marx]]'s view of [[dialectical materialism]] as the only truth. Ba'athist thought placed much emphasis on liberty and [[Arab socialism]] – a socialism with Arab characteristics, which was not part of the international socialist movement as defined by the West. Aflaq believed in the separation of state and religion, and was a strong believer in secularisation, but was against [[atheism]]. Although a Christian, he believed Islam to be proof of "Arab genius". In the aftermath of the 1966 Ba'ath Party split, the [[Ba'ath Party (Syrian-dominated faction)|Syrian-led Ba'ath Party]] accused Aflaq of stealing al-Arsuzi's ideas, and called him a "thief". The [[Ba'ath Party (Iraqi-dominated faction)|Iraqi-led Ba'ath Party]] rejects this, and does not believe that al-Arsuzi contributed to Ba'athist thought.  Additionally, Saddam Hussein claimed without evidence that prior to his death, Aflaq had secretly converted to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/23/opinion/how-saddam-hussein-gave-us-isis.html|title=How Saddam Hussein Gave Us ISIS|last=Orton|first=Kyle W.|date=December 23, 2015|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 26, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life: 1910–1939 ==
Born on 9 January 1910 in [[Damascus]] to a middle class [[Eastern Orthodoxy in Syria|Greek Orthodox Christian]] family,{{sfn|Helms|1984|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JQ6jPM38qCwC&amp;pg=PA64 64–65]}} his father, Joseph, working as a grain merchant. Aflaq was first educated in the westernized schools of the [[French Mandate of Syria]].{{sfn|Salem|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KZru-kaTZCcC&amp;pg=PA61 61]}} In 1929, he left Syria to study philosophy abroad at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in Paris. During his stay Aflaq was influenced by the works of [[Henri Bergson]], and met his longtime collaborator [[Salah al-Din al-Bitar]], a fellow Syrian nationalist.{{sfn|Benewick|Green|1988|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=qJrCWS4TU1sC&amp;pg=PA4 4]}} Aflaq founded an Arab Student Union at the Sorbonne, and discovered the writings of [[Karl Marx]]. He returned to Syria in 1932, and became active in communist politics, but left the movement when the government of [[Léon Blum]], supported by the [[French Communist Party]] (FCP), continued France's old politics towards its colonies. Aflaq, and others, had believed that the FCP followed pro-independence policies towards the [[French colonies]]. It had not helped that the [[Syrian–Lebanese Communist Party]] (SLCP) supported the FCP's decision. From then on Aflaq saw the communist movement as a tool of the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Ali|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=C8h_VjG4ucsC&amp;pg=PA110 110]}} He was impressed by the organisation and ideology of [[Antun Saadeh]]'s [[Syrian Social Nationalist Party]].{{sfn|Salem|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KZru-kaTZCcC&amp;pg=PA61 61]}}

=== Arab Ba'ath Movement: 1940–1947 ===
[[File:Baath Party founder Michel Aflaq in the late 1930s.jpg|thumb|Aflaq as seen in the late 1930s]]
Upon their return to Syria, Aflaq and al-Bitar became teachers at Tajhiz all'-Ula, "the most prestigious secondary school in Syria". Aflaq taught history, while al-Bitar taught math and physics. By 1940, Aflaq and al-Bitar had managed to set up a student circle, which usually met on Fridays. That year, the [[Arab Ba'ath Movement|Arab Ihya Movement]], a political party, was established by Aflaq and al-Bitar. They used most of their spare time in 1941 to agitate for the party. It was in 1942 that Aflaq showed his skills as "a compelling speaker" who was able to utilize the "theatrical pause" to great effect.{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&amp;pg=PA29 29]}} The party changed its name to ''Arab Ba'ath Movement'' to signify the radical changes which were sweeping the Middle East; [[Rashid Ali al-Gaylani]], the [[Prime Minister of Iraq]], had challenged Britain's domination over Iraq. The replacement of the word "Revival" with "Ba'ath" ({{lang-ar|بعث}}, literally means ''resurrection''/''rebirth'') signified that Arab revival had been replaced ideologically by the need for an Arab rebirth. The change of name led to [[Zaki al-Arsuzi]], leader of the [[Arab Ba'ath Party]], to accuse Aflaq and al-Bitar of stealing his party's name from him. Though both men were promoting a party platform based on an [[Arab nationalist]] stance, Aflaq and al-Arsuzi became bitter rivals.{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&amp;pg=PA30 30]}}

On 24 October 1942, both Aflaq and al-Bitar resigned from their teaching positions, now determined to devote themselves fully to the political struggle.{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&amp;pg=PA29 29]}} In 1941 the [[Syrian Committee to Help Iraq]] was established to support the [[Government of Iraq|Iraqi Government]] led by [[Rashid Ali al-Gaylani]] against the British invasion during the [[Anglo–Iraqi War]].{{sfn|Tucker|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=U05OvsOPeKMC&amp;pg=PA30 30]}} Al-Arsuzi, the leader of the other Arab Ba'ath movement, was skeptical of the new committee, and opposed helping the Iraqis on the ground that they would lose anyway.{{sfn|Curtis || 1971|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=1zxOruujp_IC&amp;pg=PA139 139]}} In 1941 the movement began publishing documents under the name the "Arab Ihya Movement". Later, in 1945, Aflaq and al-Bitar asked the French Mandate authorities to grant the movement a party license. The Arab Ba'ath movement did not become an official party until 1947, when it merged with al-Arsuzi's Arab Ba'ath Movement to found the [[Ba'ath Party|Arab Ba'ath Party]].{{sfn|Rabil|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=M18Jj0bMMl0C&amp;pg=PA17 17]}} The Arab Ba'ath Movement, led by Aflaq and al-Bitar, drew supporters from al-Arsuzi's Ba'ath Movement; during the 1940s, al-Arsuzi started to seclude himself from the public eye, he developed a deep distrust of others and became, according to some of his associates, [[paranoid]].{{sfn|Curtis|1971|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=1zxOruujp_IC&amp;pg=PA138 138–139]}} When the two Ba'ath movements merged and established the Arab Ba'ath Party in 1947, the only subject discussed was how much socialism to include; [[Wahib al-Ghanim]] and [[Jalal al-Sayyid]] from the al-Arsuzi led Ba'ath movement wanted Aflaq and al-Bitar to adopt more radical socialist policies.{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&amp;pg=PA34 34]}}

== Early political career and the UAR: 1947–1963 ==

=== Founding and early years ===
The Arab Ba'ath Party's first congress was held in Damascus in 1947.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=IL-A_YxL2m4C&amp;pg=PA228 228]}} Aflaq took the pre-eminent position of ''Amid'', sometimes translated as 'doyen' or as 'leader';{{sfn|Jabel|1966|[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ix2NAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Aflaq%22+amid&amp;dq=%22Aflaq%22+amid&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qITwTrmYPIP14QTd97jYAQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ 31]}} and was elected to a four-member executive committee. Under the constitution adopted at the congress, this made him effective leader of the party, with sweeping powers within the organisation; al-Bitar was elected Secretary General of the National Command. [[Zaki al-Arsuzi]], the leader of the Arab Ba'ath, was not given any position, or membership in the party.{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&amp;pg=PA34 34]}} Aflaq as ''Amid'' was responsible for ideological affairs and became the party's mentor, while al-Bitar controlled the party's day-to-day management.{{sfn|Moubayed|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sC-xU8QHSooC&amp;pg=PA131 131]}} The merger would prove problematic, several members of the al-Arsuzi-led Ba'ath Party were more left-leaning, and would become, later in Aflaq's tenure as leader, highly critical of his leadership.{{sfn|Abdulghani|1984|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=AgMOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA27 27]}}

In the late 1940s, Aflaq and al-Bitar gave free lessons on Ba'athist thought, and in 1948 they established the newspaper ''[[al-Ba'ath]]'' (English: ''rebirth''/''resurrection''). Aflaq tested the Ba'ath Party's strength during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] after early Syrian defeats – he led several demonstrations against the government led by President [[Shukri al-Quwatli]]. He personally led demonstrations, and claimed that al-Quwatli, a [[landowner]], was a corrupt and capitalistic politician, who was to blame for the Syrians army's defeat. Aflaq called for al-Quwatli's resignation, and wrote several ''al-Ba'ath'' articles criticising his presidency and his prime minister, [[Jamil Mardam Bey]].{{sfn|Moubayed|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sC-xU8QHSooC&amp;pg=PA131 131]}} Aflaq was later arrested on the orders of al-Quwatli's prime minister Bey.{{sfn|Moubayed|2006|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sC-xU8QHSooC&amp;pg=PA131 131–132]}} Al-Quwali's government was brought down in a coup d'état led by military officer [[Husni al-Za'im]]. Al-Za'im banned all parties, claiming that Syria was not ready to establish a [[liberal democracy]] yet. Aflaq, who had been set free, was rearrested during al-Zai'm's presidency and sent to the notorious [[Mezzeh Prison]]. Al-Za'im's rule did not last for long, and in August 1949, he was toppled, and [[Hashim al-Atassi]], who was democratically elected, took his place. Al-Atassi established a [[national unity government]], and Aflaq was appointed to the post of [[Ministry of Education (Syria)|Minister of Education]], the only government post he would ever hold; he held it from August to December 1949.  Al-Attasi's presidency did not last for very long either, and in 1951 [[Adib Shishakli]] took power in a military coup.{{sfn|Moubayed|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sC-xU8QHSooC&amp;pg=PA132 132]}}

Aflaq at first extended his support to the new government, believing that he and the Ba'ath Party could collaborate with Shishakli because they shared the same [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalist]] sentiments. His analysis of Shishakli proved to be wrong, and one of Shishakli's first decisions as ruler was to ban all political parties, including the Ba'ath Party.{{sfn|Moubayed|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sC-xU8QHSooC&amp;pg=PA132 132]}} The Ba'ath Party leadership, and several leading members, escaped to Lebanon in the wake of increased government repression. In Lebanon Aflaq and al-Bitar agreed to a merger of the Arab Ba'ath Party and the [[Arab Socialist Party]] (ASP), led by [[Akram al-Hawrani]], to establish the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party in 1952.{{sfn|George|2003|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dFdbVVcKsSIC&amp;pg=PA66 66–67]}} The newly formed party worked as a base of operation against Shishali's rule – Aflaq and the rest cooperated with non-Ba'athist opposition forces too. Shishakli was toppled in February 1954.{{sfn|Moubayed|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sC-xU8QHSooC&amp;pg=PA132 132]}}

Following the overthrow of al-Shishakli, Syria held its [[Syrian parliamentary election, 1954|first democratic elections]] in five years.

A proof of this was the decision of the Ba'ath Party to collaborate openly with the [[Syrian Communist Party]] (SCP), a move Aflaq opposed.{{sfn|Abdulghani|1984|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=AgMOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA28 28]}} Aflaq was elected the party's Secretary General of the newly established National Command, a title equivalent to 'party leader', by the party's Second National Congress.{{sfn|Benewick|Green|1988|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=qJrCWS4TU1sC&amp;pg=PA4 4]}}

When, under the [[United Arab Republic]] (UAR), Aflaq was forced by Nasser to dissolve the party, he disbanded the party by himself, instead of convening a congress on the matter.{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&amp;pg=PA98 98]}} The UAR proved to be disastrous for the Ba'ath Party – the party was sidelined to a great extent by Nasser's government. The Ba'ath movement, which was on the verge in 1958 of becoming the dominant Arab nationalist movement, found itself in disarray after three years of [[Nasserism|Nasserist]] rule.{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&amp;pg=PA65 65]}} Only a handful of Ba'athists were given public office in the UAR's government, al-Hawrani became Vice President and al-Bitar became Minister of Culture and Guidance.{{sfn|Reich|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3D5FulN2WqQC&amp;pg=PA109 109]}} Several members, mostly young, blamed Aflaq for this situation; it was he who dissolved the party in 1958 without consulting the National Congress. [[Hafez al-Assad]] and [[Salah Jadid]] amongst others, eventually established the Military Committee to save the Syrian Ba'ath movement from annihilation.{{sfn|Seale|1990|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&amp;pg=PA61 61–62]}} The party's Third National Congress in 1959 supported Aflaq's decision to dissolve the party, but a 1960 National Congress, in which Jadid was a delegate representing the then-unknown Military Committee, reversed the decision and called for the Ba'ath Party's reestablishment. The Congress also decided to improve relations with Nasser by democratising the UAR from within. A faction within the party, led by al-Hawrani, called for Syria's secession.{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&amp;pg=PA66 66]}} When the UAR broke up in 1961, some members applauded the dissolution, among them was al-Bitar.{{sfn|Reich|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3D5FulN2WqQC&amp;pg=PA109 109]}}
[[File:Hawrani Aflaq 1957.jpg|thumb|Aflaq (right) with [[Akram al-Hawrani|al-Hawrani]], as seen together in 1957]]
The Ba'ath Party captured 20 seats, down from 22, in the [[Syrian parliamentary election, 1961|1961 election]].{{sfn|Nohlen|Florian|Hartmann|2001|p=221}} In 1962, after four years, Aflaq convened the Fifth Congress in [[Homs]]. Al-Hawrani was not invited; cells that had stayed active and defied Aflaq's orders, and Ba'athists who become Nasserists during the period of the UAR, were not invited to the congress. Aflaq was reelected the National Command's Secretary General, and ordered the reestablishment of the Syrian-regional Ba'ath organisation. During the congress, Aflaq and the Military Committee, through [[Muhammad Umran]], made contact for the first time; the committee asked for permission to initiate a coup d'état; Aflaq supported the conspiracy.{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&amp;pg=PA75 75]}} Following the success of the [[February 1963 Iraqi coup d'état]], led by the Ba'ath Party's [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|Iraqi Regional Branch]], the Military Committee hastily convened to hatch a coup against [[Nazim al-Kudsi]]'s presidency. The [[8th of March Revolution]], a military coup launched in 1963, proved successful, and a Ba'athist government in Syria was established.{{sfn|Seale|1990|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&amp;pg=PA76 76–78]}} The plotters first order was to establish the [[National Council of the Revolutionary Command]] (NCRC), consisting entirely of Ba'athists and Nasserists, and controlled by military personnel rather than civilians from the very beginning.{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&amp;pg=PA78 78]}}

== The struggle: 1963–1968 ==

=== The beginning: 1963–1964 ===
[[File:Michel Aflaq and Salah Jadid in 1963.jpg|thumb|left|Aflaq and [[Salah Jadid]] in 1963, shortly after taking power]]
The relationship between the Ba'athists and the Nasserists were at best, uncomfortable. The Ba'ath Party's rise to power in Iraq and Syria put Nasser, as he put it, "between the hammer and the anvil". The establishment of a union between Iraq and Syria would weaken his credentials as a pan-Arab leader.{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&amp;pg=PA81 81]}} Nasser started launching bitter propaganda attacks against the party; Aflaq was dismissed as an ineffectual theorist who was mocked as a puppet "[[Roman emperor]]" and accused of being a "Cypriot Christian".{{sfn|Seale|1990|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&amp;pg=PA81 81–82]}} In several Ba'ath Party meetings Aflaq responded with pure anger, and became an anti-Nasserist. Because of the position he took, Aflaq had a falling out with al-Bitar who still believed there was a chance to reestablish good ties with Nasser.{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&amp;pg=PA82 82]}}

The break with Nasser weakened the original leaders of the Ba'ath Party, which in turn gave the Military Committee room to expand. After taking power, the Military Committee looked for theoretical guidance, but instead of going to Aflaq to solve problems (which was usual before), they contacted the party's Marxist faction led by [[Hammud al-Shufi]].{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&amp;pg=PA86 86]}} At the Syrian Ba'athist Regional Congress, the Military Committee "proved" that it was rebelling equally against Aflaq and the traditional leadership, as against their moderate social and economic policies. The Military Committee was bent on removing Aflaq from a position of power, believing that he had become old and frail.
At the Sixth National Congress held in October 1963, Aflaq was barely able to hold on to his post as Secretary General – the Marxist factions led by al-Shufi and [[Ali Salih al-Sadi]], in Syria and Iraq respectively, were the majority group. Another problem facing Aflaq was that several of his colleagues were not elected to party office, for instance al-Bitar was not reelected to a seat in the National Command. Instead of the traditional civilian leadership, a new leadership consisting of military officers was gradually growing; Jadid and [[Amin al-Hafiz]] from Syria and [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]] and [[Salih Mahdi Ammash]] from Iraq were elected to the National Command. While the Military Committee was in fact taking control over the Ba'ath Party from the civilian leadership, they were sensitive to such criticism, and stated, in an ideological pamphlet, that civilian-military symbiosis was of major importance, if socialist reconstruction was to be achieved.{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&amp;pg=PA88 88]}} To the outside world Aflaq seemed to be in charge. As the [[Tunisia]]n newspaper ''{{Interlanguage link multi|L'Action tunisienne|fr}}'' put it; "The philosopher who made two coups [Iraqi and Syrian coups] in a month".{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&amp;pg=PA90 90]}}

The Ba'ath movement was not running as smoothly as the rest of the world believed; the Iraqi Regional Branch was already starting to lose membership. The Iraqi military and the party's militant arm, the [[National Guard (Iraq)|National Guard]], detested each other. Al-Sadi, the Regional Secretary of the Iraqi Regional Branch, was eventually exiled to [[Madrid]], Spain on 11 November by several military officers and moderate Ba'athists.{{sfn|Seale|1990|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&amp;pg=PA90 90–91]}} An anxious Aflaq hastily traveled from Syria and dissolved the [[Regional Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|Regional Command]] of the Iraqi Regional Branch, exclaiming that the National Command would rule Iraq in its place until a new Regional Command was elected. This was not greeted warmly by the majority of Iraqi military officers and Ba'athists – the idea that a Christian was to rule over a Muslim country was considered "insensitive".

The situation in Iraq did not improve, [[Abdul Salam Arif]], the [[President of Iraq]] and a Nasserist, plotted a coup against the Ba'ath Party on 18 November, which succeeded. The dream of cornering Nasser's pan-Arab project was over; instead, it was Nasser and the Nasserists who were cornering the Ba'ath movement. On hearing the news, Aflaq and several Ba'athists fled Iraq for Syria.{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&amp;pg=PA91 91]}}

=== The schism: 1964–1965 ===
After a falling out with the Military Committee, of which he was a member, Muhammad Umran told Aflaq about the Committee's secret plans to oust the civilian leadership, led by Aflaq, and take over the Ba'ath Party. Shortly after, Umran was sent into exile as Ambassador to Spain for supporting the Aflaq faction.{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&amp;pg=PA96 96]}} Aflaq responded to the threat posed to his leadership by invoking his office as Secretary General, and calling for the National Command to dissolve the [[Regional Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region|Regional Command]]. He was forced to withdraw his request, when the majority of Ba'ath Party members proved to oppose such a move. A contest for power, between Aflaq and the Military Committee, ensued in the open; but it was a struggle Aflaq was losing.{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&amp;pg=PA96 96]}} It was plain from the very beginning that the initiative lay with the anti-Aflaq forces.{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&amp;pg=PA97 97]}} To counter the military threat, Aflaq invoked party rules and regulations against them. To counter this, the Military Committee befriended a staunchly anti-Aflaq civilian faction calling themselves the "Regionalists" – this group had not dissolved their party organisations as ordered by Aflaq in the 1950s.{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&amp;pg=PA97 97]}}

The Regional Congress of the Syrian Regional Branch, in March 1965, devolved power from the center, the National Command, to the Regional Command. From then on, the Regional Secretary of the Regional Command was considered Syria's ''[[ex officio]]'''s head of state. The Regional Secretary had the power to appoint the Prime Minister, the cabinet, the chief of staff and top military commanders. Aflaq was unsettled by the way things were moving, and in May he convened the Eighth National Congress to get a showdown between his followers and those of the Military Committee. However, this never came to fruition. Several civilian members of the National Command, such as the Lebanese [[Jibran Majdalani]] and the Saudi [[Ali Ghannam]], advised caution, believing that if he pressed the Military Committee too hard the military would take over the Syrian Regional Branch, and then the Ba'ath Party—as had happened in Iraq following the ousting of the Iraqi Regional Branch.
Because of their concerns, Aflaq kept quiet. But to his astonishment, keeping quiet caused him to lose his post as Secretary General – Aflaq was succeeded as Secretary General of the National Command by [[Munif al-Razzaz]], a Jordanian of Syrian origin. However, the power between the two camps was unexpectedly reshuffled when [[Amin al-Hafiz]] defected to Aflaq's camp. In contrast to other military officers al-Hafiz had very little influence within or outside the party.{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&amp;pg=PA99 99]}} Al-Hafiz's defection led to a resurgence of activity within Aflaq's faction, al-Bitar and Umran were brought back from Spain to form a new government.{{sfn|Seale|1990|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&amp;pg=PA100 100–101]}}

=== Downfall: 1966–1968 ===
[[File:Baath Party founder Michel Aflaq with Iraqi President Ahmad Hasan al-Bakr in Baghdad in 1968.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]] (left), the Regional Secretary of the Iraqi Ba'ath branch, shaking hands with Aflaq in 1968]]
Al-Razzaz, Aflaq's successor as Secretary General, came from the pro-Aflaq faction. With the defection of al-Hafez, he ordered that the National Command was the ''de jure'' ruling body of the Ba'ath Party. He appointed al-Bitar Prime Minister, Umran defence minister, [[Mansur al-Atrash]] as Chairman of the [[National Council of the Revolutionary Command]] and al-Hafiz retained his post as [[President of Syria]]. [[Salah Jadid]], the Military Committee's strongman, responded by arresting several Umran supporters. Umran responded by dismissing a handful of pro-Jadid officials. The most important of these dismissals was the removal of [[Ahmad Suwaydani]] from the post of head of the country's military intelligence to head of the Officer Administration.{{sfn|Moubayed|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sC-xU8QHSooC&amp;pg=PA347 347]}} On 23 February a [[1966 Syrian coup d'état|coup d'état]] led by Jadid and [[Hafez al-Assad]] overthrew the Syrian Government and the Ba'ath Party leadership.{{sfn|Moubayed|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sC-xU8QHSooC&amp;pg=PA134 134]}} Aflaq was exiled from Syria, and ordered never to return his homeland. Members of the party's other factions fled; Aflaq was captured and detained, along with other pro-Aflaq supporters, in a government guest house.{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&amp;pg=PA102 102]}} When the new rulers launched a purge in August that year, Aflaq managed to make his escape, with the help of [[Nasim Al Safarjalani]] and [[Malek Bashour]], both closely trusted friends and colleagues, and hence was able to flee to [[Beirut]], Lebanon,{{sfn|Seale|1990|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&amp;pg=PA111 111]}} and later to [[Brazil]].{{sfn|Commins|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_EhACvcqVXkC&amp;pg=PA26 26]}}

Aflaq's downfall caused a split within the Ba'ath Party; the party was ''de facto'' dissolved and two Ba'ath Parties were established, [[Ba'ath Party (Iraq)|one Iraqi-led Ba'ath Party]] and [[Ba'ath Party (Syria)|one Syrian-led Ba'ath Party]]. The Syrian-led party was led by Jadid and his supporters and hailed [[Zaki al-Arsuzi]], the founder of the [[Arab Ba'ath]] in 1940, as the father of [[Ba'athism|Ba'athist thought]], while the Iraqi-led party led by [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]] and [[Saddam Hussein]], still proclaimed Aflaq to be the founder of Ba'athist thought.{{sfn|Bengio|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=9EIx365fH4gC&amp;pg=PA218 218]}} In February 1966 at the Ninth National Congress, held after the coup which ousted the pro-Aflaq faction, the Iraqi delegation split with the Syrian Ba'athists. The Iraqi's held the ''true'' Ninth National Congress in February 1968 in Beirut,{{sfn|Kostiner|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=YQb1Ilj2U7EC&amp;pg=PA36 36]}} and elected Aflaq as Secretary General of the National Command.{{sfn|Moubayed|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sC-xU8QHSooC&amp;pg=PA347 347]}} Aflaq's election to the Secretary Generalship also proved to be his final break with al-Bitar; before the congress convened al-Bitar announced that he had left the Ba'ath Party and given up on the Ba'athist movement as a whole.{{sfn|Reich|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3D5FulN2WqQC&amp;pg=PA110 110]}}

== Iraqi-led Ba'ath Party: 1968–1989 ==
[[File:Baath Party founder Michel Aflaq with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in 1988.jpg|thumb|Michel Aflaq in conversation with [[Saddam Hussein]] in 1988.]]

Aflaq moved to [[Baghdad]] following his reelection to the Secretary Generalship in February 1968. He stayed there until 1970, when [[Black September]] happened, he criticised the Ba'ath leadership of doing too little to help the [[Palestine Liberation Organisation]] during the conflict.{{sfn|Moubayed|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sC-xU8QHSooC&amp;pg=PA347 347]}} During the conflict, Aflaq lobbied extensively for [[Yasser Arafat]] and the PLO. Aflaq wanted Iraqi intervention; al-Bakr, however, refused to get Iraq involved in such a conflict. Because of this, Aflaq returned to Lebanon in self-imposed exile.{{sfn|Moubayed|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sC-xU8QHSooC&amp;pg=PA347 347]}} The government of [[Hafez al-Assad]], the [[President of Syria]], condemned Aflaq to death in absentia in 1971.{{sfn|Tucker|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=U05OvsOPeKMC&amp;pg=PA30 30]}}

=== Until his death ===
After four years of self-imposed exile Aflaq returned to Iraq In 1974, a year before the [[Lebanese Civil War]] broke out.{{sfn|Shair|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=D3kqgioYJisC&amp;pg=PA39 39]}} He refrained from taking part in Iraqi politics. He published several works during this period, the most notable being ''The Struggle Against Distorting the Movement of Arab Revolution'' in 1975. Aflaq regained some of his influence when he befriended [[Saddam Hussein]], President of Iraq from 1979 until 2003. During the [[Iran–Iraq War]] the Iranian leadership accused Hussein of being under the control of a Christian, and Aflaq himself was labelled "a Christian infidel".{{sfn|Moubayed|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sC-xU8QHSooC&amp;pg=PA347 347]}} Effectively, throughout his tenure as Secretary General in Iraq, Aflaq was given all due honour as the founder of the Ba'ath movement, but on policy-making, he was ignored.{{sfn|Shair|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=D3kqgioYJisC&amp;pg=PA39 39]}}

Aflaq died on 23 June 1989 in [[Paris]], after undergoing heart surgery there.{{sfn|Tucker|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=U05OvsOPeKMC&amp;pg=PA30 30]}}

=== Disputed conversion to Islam ===
[[File:Aflaq funeral.jpg|thumbnail|Aflaq's coffin carried by Saddam Hussein and [[Izzat Ibrahim ad-Douri]]]]
Saddam Hussein claimed that Aflaq had converted to Islam prior to his death – according to nameless Western diplomats. This claim was later disputed by nameless members of Aflaq's own family{{sfn|Harris|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=D3kqgioYJisC&amp;pg=PA39 39]}} - although Aflaq's son Iyad confirmed that his father thought about conversion already in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2007/05/07/34221.html#003 alarabiya.net]&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his disputed conversion he had taken the first name of [[Ahmad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Böwering |editor1-first=Gerhard |editor2-last=Crone |editor2-first=Patricia |editor3-last=Mirza |editor3-first=Mahan |title=The Princeton Encyclopedia of Islamic Political Thought |date=2013 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=9780691134840 |page=22 |edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the German orientalists Martin Robbe and Gerhard Höpp the conversion happened before 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Robbe, Gerhard Höpp: ''Welt des Islam – Geschichte und Alltag einer Religion'', page 149.

== Memory and legacy ==

Upon his death in 1989 he was given a state funeral. A large [[tomb]] and [[mausoleum]] were erected to form a [[shrine]] for him. The tomb, widely regarded as a work of great artistic merit, designed by Iraqi architect [[Chadagee]], was located on the western grounds of the [[Ba'ath Party]] Pan-Arab Headquarters, at the intersection of [[Al-Kindi]] [[Al-Kindi street|street]] and the Qādisiyyah Expressway overpass. Although there were rumors and accusations that his tomb was destroyed during the [[2003 Iraq War]], the burial chamber and building above it were left untouched. Its blue-tiled dome can be seen above the concrete T-walls surrounding the Camp's perimeter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mideastweb.org/Middle-East-Encyclopedia/michel_aflaq.htm Michel Aflaq] // Encyclopedia of the Middle East.

The liberty we seek is not opposed to legislative measures to curb the exploitations of feudalists, capitalists and opportunists. It is a new and strict liberty which stands against pressure and confusion. Dictatorship is a precarious, unsuitable and self-contradictory system which does not allow the consciousness of the people to grow." | Aflaq in a speech, talking about one of the key Ba'athist tenets; "freedom will come to the Arabs through unity [the establishment of the Arab Nation]"{{sfn|Hopwood|1988|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=d0YVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA87 87]}}|}}
The [[Ba'ath Party|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party]] slogan "Unity, liberty, socialism" is the key tenet of Aflaq's and Ba'athist thought. Unity meant the unification of the [[Arab people]] into one nation, the [[Arab Nation]]. The creation of an Arab Nation would have direct implications on Arab development. The establishment of this new state would lead to an Arab Ba'ath (literally meaning "[[Renaissance]]").{{sfn|Salem|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KZru-kaTZCcC&amp;pg=PA61 61]}} The Arab nations of his time could only progressively "decline" if not unified; these nations had various ailments – "[[feudalism]], [[sectarianism]], [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalism]], intellectual [[reactionism]]". The only way to "cure" the Arab nations was, according to Aflaq, through a revolutionary movement. Aflaq was influenced by [[Marxism]] in that he saw the need for a [[vanguard party]] to rule the Arab Nation for an indefinite period of time (the period would be a transition from the old to the new).{{sfn|Salem|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KZru-kaTZCcC&amp;pg=PA62 62]}}

The need for [[liberty]] was one of the defining features of Ba'athism,{{sfn|Salem|1994|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KZru-kaTZCcC&amp;pg=PA66 66–67]}} however, liberty not in the sense used by [[Liberal democracy|liberal democracies]].{{sfn|Salem|1994|pp=67–68]}} Aflaq was a strong believer in [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism of thought]],{{sfn|Salem|1994|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KZru-kaTZCcC&amp;pg=PA66 66–67]}} but paradoxically, against pluralism in the form of votes. In theory, the Ba'ath Party would rule, and guide the people, in a transitional period of time without consulting the people{{sfn|Salem|1994|pp=67–68]}} because the party knew what was right.{{sfn|Salem|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KZru-kaTZCcC&amp;pg=PA67 67]}}

The last tenet, 'socialism', did not mean socialism as it is defined in the West, but rather a unique form of Arab socialism. Aflaq coined the word [[Arab socialism]] for his variant of socialism. Socialism, in its original form in the Arab world had, according to Aflaq, first come into being under the rule of [[Muhammad]]. The point of Arab socialism was not to answer questions such as: how much [[State socialism|state control]] was necessary, or economic equality; but instead Arab socialism was a system that freed the Arab people from oppression and enslavement, which in turn created independent individuals.{{sfn|Salem|1994|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KZru-kaTZCcC&amp;pg=PA69 69–70]}}

Aflaq opposed Marx's view that [[dialectical materialism]] was the only truth, but believed that the "importance of material economic conditions in life" was one of the greatest discoveries in modern history.{{sfn|Salem|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KZru-kaTZCcC&amp;pg=PA68 68]}} Even so, Aflaq was critical of both capitalism and communism, and did not want either of the two power blocs to collapse during the [[Cold War]] – believing that the Cold War was a sort of [[check and balance]] on their power.{{sfn|Ginat|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rlxqHiFdFjwC&amp;pg=PA118 118]}}

=== Role of Islam ===

What Aflaq saw in Islam was a revolutionary movement. In contrast to other nationalities, the Arab awakening and expansion was attributed to a religious message. Because of this, Aflaq believed that the Arab's spirituality was directly linked to Islam, therefore, one could never take Islam out of the equation of what is essentially, and essentially is not, Arab. [[Arab nationalism]], just as Islam had been during the lifetime of [[Muhammad]], was a spiritual revolutionary movement,  leading the Arabs towards a new [[renaissance]]: Arab nationalism was the second revolution to appear in the Arab world. All Arab religious communities should, according to Aflaq, respect and worship the spirituality of Islam, even if they did not worship Islam in a religious sense – Aflaq was a Christian who worshipped Islam.{{sfn|Makiya|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=frDO73fi83IC&amp;pg=PA198 198]}} Aflaq did not believe it was necessary to worship Muhammad, but believed that all Arabs should strive to emulate Muhammad. In the words of Aflaq himself, Arabs "belong to the nation that gave birth to a Muhammad; or rather, because this Arab individual is a member of the community which Muhammad put all his efforts into creating […] Muhammad was all the Arabs; let us today make all the Arabs Muhammad." The Muslim of Muhammad's days were, according to Aflaq, synonymous with Arabs – the Arabs were the only ones to preach the message of Islam during Muhammad's lifetime. In contrast to Jesus, who was a religious leader, but not a political leader, Muhammad was both – the first leader of Islam and of the Arab world. Therefore, secularisation could not take the same shape in the Arab world as it did in the West.{{sfn|Makiya|1998|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=frDO73fi83IC&amp;pg=PA198 198–199]}}

Aflaq called on all Arabs, both Muslim and non-Muslim alike, to admire the role Islam had played in creating the Arab character. But his view on Islam was purely spiritual, and Aflaq emphasised that Islam "should not be imposed" on state and society. Time and again Aflaq emphasised that the Ba'ath party was against [[atheism]], but also equally against [[fundamentalism]]. For him, any fundamentalism represented a "shallow, false faith." According to Ba'athist ideology, all religions were equal. Despite his [[Anti-atheist sentiment|anti-atheist]] stance, Aflaq was a strong supporter of secular government, and stated that a Ba'athist state would replace religion with a state "based on a foundation – Arab nationalism, and a moral – freedom."{{sfn|Harris|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=D3kqgioYJisC&amp;pg=PA33 33]}}

== Legacy ==
[[File:Maflaq.jpg|Aflaq's theoretical contributions have been met with mixed reactions|thumb]]
[[Fouad Ajami]] criticised Aflaq for a lack of real substance, stating, "Nearly three hundred pages of text yield no insight, on his part, into what went wrong and what needed to be done; there is only the visible infatuation with words" and "Aflaq summons the party to renounce power and go back to its 'pure essence'". There is some truth in this critique. Aflaq spent much time and energy writing optimistically about the future, and the past, of the Arab Nation, and of how the Arab World could be unified. As Kanan Makiya, the author of ''Republic of Fear: The Politics of Modern Iraq'', notes: for "Aflaq, reality is confined to the inner world of the party." In contrast to other philosophers, such as [[Karl Marx]] or [[John Locke]], Aflaq's ideological view of the world makes no clear stand on the materialistic or socioeconomic behavior of humanity.{{sfn|Makiya|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=frDO73fi83IC&amp;pg=PA201 201]}} While other philosophers make distinctions between what is real and what is not real, that is between prescriptive and descriptive analysis,  Aflaq did not as a rule define what ''is'' and what ''ought'' to be.  In his thought both are molded into the same category: that which is ''attainable''.{{sfn|Makiya|1998|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=frDO73fi83IC&amp;pg=PA201 201–202]}}

In contrast to his longtime friend and colleague [[Salah al-Din al-Bitar]], who was more practical when it came to politics, Aflaq was a "visionary, the dreamer rather unfitted for political life".{{sfn|Hopwood|1988|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=d0YVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA88 88]}} Aflaq was described by his associates as an "[[ascetic]], shy and intense figure living a simple and unpretentious life."{{sfn|Benewick|Green|1988|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=qJrCWS4TU1sC&amp;pg=PA5 5]}} He has been accused of seeking help from other people instead of fulfilling his goal by himself or with others he led; Aflaq collaborated with [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]] and [[Abdul Rahman Arif]] in 1958, to [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]] and Ali Salih al-Sadi in 1963 and finally in the 1970s to [[Saddam Hussein]].{{sfn|Benewick|Green|1988|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=qJrCWS4TU1sC&amp;pg=PA5 5]}} There are several Ba'athists, mostly from the [[Ba'ath Party (Syrian-led faction)|Syrian-led Ba'ath Party]], who believe Aflaq stole Ba'athist ideology from its original founder, [[Zaki al-Arsuzi]]. These individuals have denounced, and labelled, Aflaq as a "thief".{{sfn|Curtis|1971|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=1zxOruujp_IC&amp;pg=PA138 138]}}

In his writings Aflaq had been stridently in favor of [[free speech]] and other human rights and aid for the lower classes. During the Military Committee's gradual take over of power in Syria, Aflaq rallied against what he saw as the establishment of a military dictatorship, instead of the democracy for which Aflaq had planned.{{sfn|Moubayed|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sC-xU8QHSooC&amp;pg=PA134 134]}} These ideals were never realized by the governments that used his ideology. Most scholars see the Assad government in Syria and Saddam Hussein's government in Iraq to have only employed Aflaq's ideology as a pretense for dictatorship.{{sfn|Tucker|Roberts|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=YAd8efHdVzIC&amp;pg=PA183 183]}}

Ordained as a priest in 1955, he completed a Ph.D. in Philosophy in 1958 and was sent to Brazil the same year by the COPAL, the ''Collège pour l'Amérique latine de Louvain'', a Belgian institution created at the instigation of the Holy See to train Belgian missionary priests who would be sent to Latin America to counter Marxist and Protestant influences there.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Caroline Sappia, Olivier Servais, ''Mission et engagement politique après 1945: Afrique, Amérique latine, Europe'', Karthala Editions, 2010, {{ISBN|9782811104085}} pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=0TrbaqAY_uEC&amp;pg=PA53 53] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=0TrbaqAY_uEC&amp;pg=PA58 58]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1998 text marking and commenting the fiftieth anniversary of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], he wrote that "every time that, in the name of this new conception of human rights, "new individual rights" - right to homosexuality, to abortion, to euthanasia, etc. - are suggested, there is a step forward towards the civilian sacralisation of violence".&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-fr|chaque fois qu'au nom de cette nouvelle conception des droits de l'homme on propose de "nouveaux droits" individuels - droit à l'homosexualité, à l'avortement, à l'euthanasie, etc. - on avance d'un cran dans la marche conduisant à la sacralisation civile de la violence}}, in: ''[http://perso.infonie.be/le.feu/ms/divfr/dhdfr.htm Droits de l'homme et démocratie. A propos du cinquantenaire de la Déclaration universelle des droits de l'homme]''&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2010 controversy over Mgr. [[Rino Fisichella|Fisichella]]'s position towards the [[2009 Brazilian girl abortion case]], Mgr. Schooyans played an active role in the radical pro-life Vatican lobby which asked for Fisichella's resignation from the presidency of the [[Pontifical Academy for Life]], saying that he had fallen into the trap of "bogus compassion," in criticizing the public excommunication by the Brazilian bishops of the doctors who had decided to perform an abortion on a nine-year-old girl who had been raped and whose life was at risk.&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Winfield, "[http://archive.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2010/02/22/vatican_official_dismisses_calls_for_resignation/ Vatican official dismisses calls for resignation]", ''Associated Press'', February 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a member of the [[Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences]] of the Vatican, of the [[EGMONT - The Royal Institute for International Relations|Royal Institute of International Relations]] in Brussels, the [[Institut national d'études démographiques|Institute for Demographic Policy]] in Paris, the [[Population Research Institute]] in Washington.

'''Negative utilitarianism''' is a version of the ethical theory [[utilitarianism]] that gives greater priority to reducing [[suffering]] (negative utility or 'disutility') than to increasing [[pleasure|happiness]] (positive utility).&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{harvnb|Leslie|1998|page=12}}: "'Negative utilitarianism' is concerned mainly or entirely with reducing evils rather than with maximizing goods." The example unpleasant experiences is an example based on a hedonistic theory of well-being, according to which pleasant experiences are good for individuals and unpleasant experiences are bad for individuals. But there are other theories of well-being and negative utilitarianism need not adopt a hedonistic theory.&lt;/ref&gt; This differs from classical utilitarianism, which does not claim that reducing suffering is intrinsically more important than increasing happiness. Both versions of utilitarianism hold that morally right and morally wrong actions depend solely on the consequences for overall [[well-being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bykvist|2009|page=19}}: "The whole family of utilitarian theories is captured by the equation: Utilitarianism = Consequentialism (nothing but the values of outcomes matter for the rightness of actions) + Welfarism (nothing but well-being matters for the value of outcomes)."&lt;/ref&gt; 'Well-being' refers to the state of the individual.{{sfn|Bykvist|2009|loc=chpt. 4}} The term 'negative utilitarianism' is used by some authors to denote the theory that reducing negative well-being is the ''only'' thing that ultimately matters morally.{{sfn|Smart|1958}} Others distinguish between 'strong' and 'weak' versions of negative utilitarianism, where strong versions are ''only'' concerned with reducing negative well-being, and weak versions say that ''both'' positive and negative well-being matter but that negative well-being matters more.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=29}} says that strong versions of negative utilitarianism "give all weight to disutility" and weak versions "give some weight to positive utility, but more weight to disutility." {{harvnb|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=115}}: “Our point of departure was the firm intuition that unhappiness and suffering have greater weight than happiness. By taking this stand we revealed ourselves as members of the negative utilitarian family.” {{harvnb|Ord|2013}}: “NU [negative utilitarianism] comes in several flavours, which I will outline later, but the basic thrust is that an act is morally right if and only if it leads to less suffering than any available alternative. Unlike Classical Utilitarianism, positive experiences such as pleasure or happiness are either given no weight, or at least a lot less weight.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Other versions of negative utilitarianism differ in how much weight they give to negative well-being ('disutility') compared to positive well-being (positive utility), as well as the different conceptions of what well-being (utility) is. For example, negative [[preference utilitarianism]] says that the well-being in an outcome depends on [[antifrustrationism|frustrated preferences]]. Negative [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] utilitarianism thinks of well-being in terms of pleasant and unpleasant experiences.{{sfn|Negative Utilitarianism FAQ|2015}} There are many other variations on how negative utilitarianism can be specified.

The term "negative utilitarianism" was introduced by [[Ninian Smart|R. Ninian Smart]] in 1958 in his reply to [[Karl Popper]]'s ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]''. Smart also presented the most famous argument against negative utilitarianism:{{sfn|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=31}} that negative utilitarianism would entail that a ruler who is able to instantly and painlessly destroy the human race would have a duty to do so. Furthermore, every human being would have a moral responsibility to commit suicide, thereby preventing future suffering.  {{sfn|Smart|1958|p=542}} Many authors have endorsed versions of this argument, and some have presented counterarguments against it.

Smart]] in his 1958 reply to [[Karl Popper]]'s book ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', published in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smart|1958|p=542}}: "Professor Popper has proposed a negative formulation of the utilitarian principle, so that we should replace ‘Aim at the greatest amount of happiness for the greatest number’ by ‘The least amount of avoidable suffering for all’. He says: ‘It adds to the clarity of ethics if we formulate our demands negatively, i.e. if we demand the elimination of suffering rather than the promotion of happiness’. However, one may reply to negative utilitarianism..."&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Popper emphasizes the importance of preventing suffering in public policy.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Popper wrote, "I suggest, for this reason, to replace the utilitarian formula ‘Aim at the greatest amount of happiness for the greatest number’, or briefly, ‘Maximize happiness’ by the formula ‘The least amount of avoidable suffering for all’, or briefly, ‘Minimize suffering’. {{cite book |last=Popper|first=Karl|title=The Open Society and Its Enemies|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415610216|page=548}} Popper claimed that "there is, from the ethical point of view, no symmetry between suffering and happiness, or between pain and pleasure... In my opinion human suffering makes a direct moral appeal, namely, the appeal for help, while there is no similar call to increase the happiness of a man who is doing well anyway. A further criticism of the Utilitarian formula "Maximize pleasure" is that it assumes a continuous pleasure-pain scale which allows us to treat degrees of pain as negative degrees of pleasure. But, from the moral point of view, pain cannot be outweighed by pleasure, and especially not one man's pain by another man's pleasure. Instead of the greatest happiness for the greatest number, one should demand, more modestly, the least amount of avoidable suffering for all..." {{cite book |last=Popper|first=Karl|title=The Open Society and Its Enemies: Volume 1: The Spell of Plato|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415237314|pages=284–285}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ideas in negative utilitarianism have similarities with ancient traditions such as [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Contestabile|2014|page=298}}: "Negative utilitarianism and Buddhism share the following intuitions: Negative utilitarianism—understood as an umbrella term—models the asymmetry between suffering and happiness and therefore accords with the Buddhist intuition of universal compassion. The Noble Truths of Buddhism accord with the negative utilitarian intuition that (global) suffering cannot be compensated by happiness. Some forms of Buddhism and negative utilitarianism share the intuition that non-existence is a perfect state." {{harvnb|Goodman|2009|page=101}}: “Negative utilitarianism shares with Buddhism a strong focus on alleviating the suffering of beings.”&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Greek philosopher [[Hegesias of Cyrene]] has been said to be “one of the earliest exponents of NU [Negative Utilitarianism].”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keown|1992|page=175}}: “one of the earliest exponents of NU, Hegesias...”&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent times, ideas similar to negative utilitarianism can be found in the works of 19th century psychologist [[Edmund Gurney]] who wrote:

{{quote|Enough suffering will always remain to make the question of the desirability . . . of their sojourn on earth a question which numbers will answer . . . in the negative. . . . When we forget pain, or underestimate it, or talk about people 'getting used to it', we are really so far losing sight of what the universe, which we wish to conceive adequately, really is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://utilitarianism.com/gurney/index.html|title=Edmund Gurney (1847 - 88)}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Versions of negative utilitarianism ==
Like other kinds of [[utilitarianism]], negative utilitarianism can take many forms depending on what specific claims are taken to constitute the theory. For example, negative [[preference utilitarianism]] says that the utility of an outcome depends on frustrated and satisfied preferences. Negative [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] utilitarianism thinks of utility in terms of hedonic mental states such as suffering and unpleasantness.{{sfn|Negative Utilitarianism FAQ|2015}} Versions of (negative) utilitarianism can also differ based on whether the ''actual'' or ''expected'' consequences matter, and whether the aim is stated in terms of the ''average'' outcome among individuals or the ''total'' net utility (or lack of disutility) among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sinnott-Armstrong|2014}} provides a nice overview of the many ways in which consequentialism can be varied. Since utilitarianism (and negative utilitarianism) is a kind of consequentialism, much of it applies to utilitarianism and negative utilitarianism as well. Section 1. "Classic Utilitarianism" shows the many distinct and variable claims that make up Classic Utilitarianism.&lt;/ref&gt; Negative utilitarianism can aim either to ''optimize'' the value of the outcome or it can be a ''satisficing'' negative utilitarianism, according to which an action ought to be taken if and only if the outcome would be ''sufficiently'' valuable (or have sufficiently low disvalue).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bykvist|2009|page=102}}, states satisficing utilitarianism as follows: "''Satisficing utilitarianism'' An action ought to be done if and only if it would bring about a sufficient level of total well-being."&lt;/ref&gt; A key way in which negative utilitarianisms can differ from one another is with respect to how much weight they give to negative well-being (disutility) compared to positive well-being (positive utility). This is a key area of variation because the key difference between negative utilitarianism and non-negative kinds of utilitarianism is that negative utilitarianism gives more weight to negative well-being.

=== The weight of evil (disutility) ===
Philosophers Gustaf Arrhenius and Krister Bykvist develop a taxonomy of negative utilitarian views based on how the views weigh disutility against positive utility.&lt;ref&gt;They write that they distinguish among kinds of 'negative utilitarianism': "Our point of departure was the firm intuition that unhappiness and suffering have greater weight than happiness. By taking this stand we revealed ourselves as members of the negative utilitarian family. The problem was then to find out which members of this family we want to join, and to spell out why we do not want to be as some of our siblings." {{harvnb|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=115}}. The taxonomy is phrased in terms of 'negativisms,' which appear to be the same as 'negativist' and 'negative' utilitarianisms: "we believe that disutility has greater weight than utility. The overall aim with this part of our essay is to give an account of this weight, which means that we shall try to formulate a welfarist act-consequentialism that takes seriously the weight of disutility. In other words, we are looking for an acceptable negativist utilitarianism." {{harvnb|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In total, they distinguish among 16 kinds of negative utilitarianism.{{sfn|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|pp=30,38}} They first distinguish between ''strong negativism'' and ''weak negativism''. Strong negativism "give all weight to disutility" and weak negativism "give some weight to positive utility, but more weight to disutility."{{sfn|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=29}} The most commonly discussed subtypes are probably two versions of weak negative utilitarianism called 'lexical' and 'lexical threshold' negative utilitarianism. According to 'lexical' negative utilitarianism, positive utility gets weight only when outcomes are equal with respect to disutility. That is, positive utility functions as a tiebreaker in that it determines which outcome is better (or less bad) when the outcomes considered have equal disutility.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=39}}: "The claim that disutility has greater weight can now be expressed by letting the disutilities have greater lexical weight. But still the utility has some weight in the sense that if the disutilities are the same in the alternatives, and hence we cannot minimise the disutility any further, then we ought to maximise the utility. Depending on what kinds of disutilities we choose in establishing this order, we get different lexical negativisms."&lt;/ref&gt; 'Lexical threshold' negative utilitarianism says that there is some disutility, for instance some extreme suffering, such that no positive utility can counterbalance it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ord|2013}}: "''Lexical Threshold NU''
Suffering and happiness both count, but there is some amount of suffering that no amount of happiness can outweigh."&lt;/ref&gt; 'Consent-based' negative utilitarianism is a specification of lexical threshold negative utilitarianism, which specifies where the threshold should be located. It says that if an individual is suffering and would at that moment not "agree to continue the suffering in order to obtain something else in the future" then the suffering cannot be outweighed by any happiness.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Tomasik formulated and advocated consent-based negative utilitarianism. He writes, "would the person-moment suffering agree to continue the suffering in order to obtain something else in the future? If yes, then the suffering doesn't pass the threshold of unbearableness and thus can be outweighed by happiness." {{harvnb|Tomasik|2015}}. See section “Consent-based negative utilitarianism?” The ‘person-moment’ means the person in the moment of suffering, as opposed to before or after the suffering occurred.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other distinctions among versions of negative utilitarianism ===
[[Thomas Metzinger]] proposes the 'principle of negative utilitarianism,' which is the broad idea that suffering should be minimized when possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Metzinger|2003|page=622}}: “In terms of a fundamental solidarity of all suffering beings against suffering, something that almost all of us should be able to agree on is what I will term the “principle of negative utilitarianism”: Whatever else our exact ethical commitments and specific positive goals are, we can and should certainly all agree that, in principle, and whenever possible, the overall amount of conscious suffering in all beings capable of conscious suffering should be minimized. I know that it is impossible to give any truly conclusive argument in favor of this principle. And, of course, there exist all kinds of theoretical complications—for example, individual rights, long-term preferences, and epistemic indeterminacy. But the underlying intuition is something that can be shared by almost everybody: We can all agree that no additional suffering should be created without need. Albert Camus once spoke about the solidarity of all finite beings against death, and in just the same sense there should be a solidarity of all sentient beings capable of suffering against suffering. Out of this solidarity we should not do anything that would increase the overall amount of suffering and confusion in the universe—let alone something that highly ''likely'' will have this effect right from the beginning.”&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mario Bunge]] writes about negative utilitarianism in his ''Treatise on Basic Philosophy'' but in a different sense than most others. In Bunge's sense, negative utilitarianism is about not harming.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bunge|1989|p=230}}: "By recommending passivity it [negative utilitarianism] condones evil. The spectator who watches impassively a hooligan attacking an old woman, and the citizen who does not bother to vote, comply with negative utilitarianism and thereby tolerate evil."&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, most other discussion of negative utilitarianism takes it to imply a duty both not to harm and to help (at least in the sense of reducing negative well-being).&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{harvnb|Pearce|Negative Utilitarianism: Why Be Negative?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The benevolent world-exploder ==
In the 1958 article where [[Ninian Smart|R. N. Smart]] introduced the term ‘negative utilitarianism’ he argued against it, stating that negative utilitarianism would entail that a ruler who is able to instantly and painlessly destroy the human race, "a benevolent world-exploder," would have a duty to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smart|1958|page=542}}: "Suppose that a ruler controls a weapon capable of instantly and painlessly destroying the human race. Now it is empirically certain that there would be some suffering before all those alive on any proposed destruction day were to die in the natural course of events. Consequently the use of the weapon is bound to diminish suffering, and would be the ruler's duty on NU grounds." For his use of the term ‘the benevolent world-exploder’ see page 543.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the most famous argument against negative utilitarianism,{{sfn|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=31}} and it is directed against sufficiently strong versions of negative utilitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;That is, the argument is directed against strong versions of negative utilitarainaism that prescribe only reducing negative well-being, as well as weak versions that are sufficiently close to strong negative utilitarianism. Such weak versions would be those that, although they give weight to both negative and positive well-being, give sufficiently much more the weight to negative well-being, so that they would have the same implications as strong versions in relevant situations.&lt;/ref&gt; Many authors have endorsed this argument,&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{harvnb|Bunge|1989|p=230}}: "Negative utilitarianism ... is open to the following objections.... Fourthly, the most expeditious way of implementing the doctrine would be to exterminate humankind, for then human suffering would cease altogether (R. N. Smart 1958)." {{harvnb|Heyd|1992|p=60}}: "Negative utilitarianism, which seems promising in guiding us in genethics, also urges (at least in its impersonal version) paradoxical (and to some, morally abhorrent) solutions to the miseries of humanity. Primarily it recommends the painless annihilation of all humanity—either by the collective suicide of all actual beings, or by total abstention from procreation by one generation (Smart 1958, 542-543)." {{harvnb|Ord|2013}}: "R. N. Smart wrote a response [3] in which he christened the principle 'Negative Utilitarianism' and showed a major unattractive consequence. A thorough going Negative Utilitarian would support the destruction of the world (even by violent means) as the suffering involved would be small compared to the suffering in everyday life in the world."&lt;/ref&gt; and some have presented counterarguments against it. Below are replies to this argument that have been presented and discussed.

=== Cooperation between different value systems ===
One possible reply to this argument is that only a naive interpretation of negative utilitarianism would endorse world destruction. The conclusion can be mitigated by pointing out the importance of cooperation between different value systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gains from Trade through Compromise – Foundational Research Institute|url = http://foundational-research.org/gains-from-trade-through-compromise/|website = foundational-research.org|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are good consequentialist reasons why one should be cooperative towards other value systems and it is particularly important to avoid doing something harmful to other value systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Reasons to Be Nice to Other Value Systems – Foundational Research Institute|url = http://foundational-research.org/reasons-to-be-nice-to-other-value-systems/|website = foundational-research.org|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction of the world would strongly violate many other value systems and endorsing it would therefore be uncooperative. Since there are many ways to reduce suffering which do not infringe on other value systems, it makes sense for negative utilitarians to focus on these options. In an extended interpretation of negative utilitarianism, cooperation with other value systems is considered and the conclusion is that it is better to reduce suffering without violating other value systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.utilitarianism.com/nu/nufaq.html|title = Negative Utilitarianism FAQ|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eliminating vs. reducing disutility ===
Another reply to the benevolent world-exploder argument is that it does not distinguish between eliminating and reducing negative well-being, and that negative utilitarianism should plausibly be formulated in terms of reducing and not eliminating.&lt;ref&gt;This is essentially [[H. B. Acton]]'s reply. {{harvnb|Acton|Watkins|1963|page=84}}: "Eliminating suffering is not the same thing as reducing it or as arriving at 'the least amount of avoidable suffering for all', and it is the latter, not the former, that might, with some plausibility, be regarded as a possible substitute for the more usual form of utilitarianism. Would not, then, the destroyer imagined by Smart be making a terrible mistake through failing to notice the difference between eliminating and reducing?"&lt;/ref&gt; A counterargument to that reply is that elimination is a form of reduction, similar to how zero is a number.&lt;ref&gt;This is [[J. J. C. Smart]]'s reply to Acton. J. J. C. Smart agrees with his brother R. N. Smart that "if we made the minimization of misery our sole ultimate ethical principle ... we should approve of a tyrannical but benevolent world exploder." {{harvnb|Smart|1973|page=29}} J. J. C. Smart replies to Acton that "surely eliminating is a case of reducing – the best case of all, the negative utilitarian would say. In suggesting that eliminating is not reducing, Acton seems to me to be like a person who says that zero is not a number." {{harvnb|Smart|1989||p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attempting world destruction would be counterproductive ===
Several philosophers have argued that to try to destroy the world (or to kill many people) would be counterproductive from a negative utilitarian perspective. One such argument is provided by [[David Pearce (philosopher)|David Pearce]], who says that "planning and implementing the extinction of all sentient life couldn't be undertaken painlessly. Even contemplating such an enterprise would provoke distress. Thus a negative utilitarian is not compelled to argue for the apocalyptic solution."{{sfn|Pearce|2005}} Instead, Pearce advocates the use of biotechnology to phase out the biology of suffering throughout the living world, and he says that "life-long happiness can be genetically pre-programmed."{{sfn|Pearce|Negative Utilitarianism: Why Be Negative?}} A similar reply to the similar claim that negative utilitarianism would imply that we should kill off the miserable and needy is that we rarely face policy choices and that "anyway there are excellent utilitarian reasons for avoiding such a policy, since people would find out about it and become even more miserable and fearful."&lt;ref&gt;Clark Wolf proposes and defends ‘negative critical level utilitarianism’ in the context of social choice and population choices, which says that "population choices should be guided by an aim to minimize suffering and deprivation" {{harv|Wolf|1996|page=273}}. He brings up the possible objection to his principle that "it might occur to someone that the best way to minimize current suffering and deprivation would be to quietly, secretly, and painlessly kill off all of those who are miserable and needy" {{harv|Wolf|1996|page=278}}. A part of his reply is that "die hard utilitarians could argue that we rarely face such a policy choice, and that anyway there are excellent utilitarian reasons for avoiding such a policy, since people would find out about it and become even more miserable and fearful" {{harv|Wolf|1996|page=278}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Negative Utilitarianism FAQ's answer to question "3.2 Should NUs try to increase extinction risk?" begins with "No, that would very bad even by NU standards."{{sfn|Negative Utilitarianism FAQ|2015}}

=== Life could evolve again in a worse way ===
Some replies to the benevolent world exploder-argument take the form that even if the world were destroyed, that would or might be bad from a negative utilitarian perspective. One such reply provided by [[John W. N. Watkins]] is that even if life were destroyed, life could evolve again, perhaps in a worse way. So the world-exploder would need to destroy the possibility of life, but that is in principle beyond human power.&lt;ref&gt;[[John W. N. Watkins]] describes himself as "a sort of negative utilitarian" {{harv|Acton|Watkins|1963|page=95}}. He replies to R. N. Smart that "even if all life ''were'' destroyed, in due course living matter might emerge from the slime once more, and the evolutionary process start up again—this time accompanied, perhaps, by even more pain than would have accompanied the continued existence of the human race. So the pain minimiser would need to destroy the very ''possibility'' of life. And I like to think that this is something which is ''in principle'' beyond human power" {{harv|Acton|Watkins|1963|page=96}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To this, J. J. C. Smart replies,

{{quote|I am also a little puzzled by Watkin's remark that the pain minimizer would have to destroy the ''very possibility'' of life. If the sentient forms of life were totally destroyed, it might be that the sentient forms would be most unlikely to evolve. This is on the supposition, held by some experts, that the evolution of higher forms of life on earth depended on a lot of lucky accidents. If this is not the case, then the benevolent world destroyer should ensure that ''all'' forms of life are destroyed, even bacteria and plants and insects, but should this be impossible the world destroyer might have at least ensured a pain free globe for hundreds of millions of years to come. In any case my brother's example was of a world ''exploder'', and I think this would ensure the destruction of ''all'' life on earth. Of course there might be sentient life on planets of distant stars. No doubt the world exploder can do nothing about this, even with the resources of a future physics, but his or her negative utilitarian duty would not be to do the impossible, but would be to minimize suffering as much as lies within his or her power.{{sfn|Smart|1989||pp=44-45}}}}

=== Getting killed would be a great evil ===
Another related reply to the world-exploder argument is that getting killed would be a great evil. Erich Kadlec defends negative utilitarianism and replies to the benevolent world-exploder argument (in part) as follows: "He [R. N. Smart] also dispenses with the generally known fact that all people (with a few exceptions in extreme situations) like to live and would consider being killed not a benefit but as the greatest evil done to them."{{sfn|Kadlec|2008|110}}

=== Frustrated preferences ===
Negative [[preference utilitarianism]] has a preferentialist conception of well-being. That is, it is bad for an individual to get his aversions fulfilled (or preferences frustrated), and depending on version of negative utilitarianism, it may also be good for him to get his preferences satisfied. A negative utilitarian with such a conception of well-being, or whose conception of well-being includes such a preferentialist component, could reply to the benevolent world-exploder argument by saying that the explosion would be bad because it would fulfill many individuals' aversions.&lt;ref&gt;"A preferentialist could, for example, claim that most people now living prefer to live, and that these preferences must be counted when elimination is at stake. So, the elimination results in a lot of frustrated preferences, and we must balance the evil ofthis against the evil of the unhappiness in the future of humanity." {{harv|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrhenius and Bykvist provide two criticisms of this reply. First, it could be claimed that frustrated preferences require that someone exists who has the frustrated preference. But if everyone is dead there are no preferences and hence no badness.{{sfn|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=32}} Second, even if a world-explosion would involve frustrated preferences that would be bad from a negative preference utilitarian perspective, such a negative utilitarian should still favor it as the lesser of two evils compared to all the frustrated preferences that would likely exist if the world continued to exist.{{sfn|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=32}}

The Negative Utilitarianism FAQ suggests two replies to Arrhenius and Bykvist's first type of criticism (the criticism that if no one exists anymore then there are no frustrated preferences anymore): The first reply is that past preferences count, even if the individual who held them no longer exists.&lt;ref&gt;"NIPU [negative ideal preference utilitarianism] isn’t about minimizing the amount of unsatisfied preferences that currently exist, but rather about minimizing the total amount of unsatisfied preferences in the (space-time) universe. This includes past preferences." {{harv|Negative Utilitarianism FAQ|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second is that "instead of counting past preferences, one could look at the matter in terms of life-goals. The earlier the death of a person who wants to go on living, the more unfulfilled her life-goal."{{sfn|Negative Utilitarianism FAQ|2015}} The Negative Utilitarianism FAQ also replies to Arrhenius and Bykvist's second type of criticism. The reply is (in part) that the criticism relies on the empirical premise that there would be more frustrated preferences in the future if the world continued to exist than if the world was destroyed. But that negative preference utilitarianism would say that extinction would be better (in theory), assuming that premise, should not count substantially against the theory, because for any view on population ethics that assigns disvalue to something, one can imagine future scenarios such that extinction would be better according to the given view.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Negative Utilitarianism FAQ|2015}}. See section "2.1.5 Back to destroying the world, doesn’t NIPU still imply that extinction would be best, because if there will be a lot of people in the future, their unsatisfied preferences combined are worse than the preferences being thwarted by extinction?"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Combining negative utilitarianism with rights ===
A part of Clark Wolf's response to the benevolent world-exploder objection is that negative utilitarianism can be combined with a theory of rights. He says,

{{quote|A more direct way to address this problem would be to incorporate a theory of rights, stipulating that in general, policy makers simply have no right to make decisions about whether the lives of others are worth living, or whether they should live or die. Since it is clear that policy makers have no right to kill off the miserable and destitute, this response gains support from our moral intuitions.{{sfn|Wolf|1996|p=278}}}}

Negative utilitarianism can be combined, in particular, with Rawls' theory of justice.{{sfn|Contestabile|Negative Utilitarianism and Justice}} Rawls knew Popper’s normative claims{{sfn|Rawls|1958|p=174}} and may have been influenced by his concern for the worst-off.

== Other works ==
[[Toby Ord]] provides a critique of negative utilitarianism in his essay "Why I'm Not a Negative Utilitarian,"{{sfn|Ord|2013}} to which [[David Pearce (philosopher)|David Pearce]] and Bruno Contestabile have replied.{{sfn|Pearce|A response to Toby Ord's essay}}{{sfn|Contestabile|Why I’m (Not) a Negative Utilitarian – A Review of Toby Ord’s Essay}} Other critical views of negative utilitarianism are provided by Thaddeus Metz,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Metz|2012|pages=1–2}}: "Negative utilitarianism is well-known for entailing anti-natalism as well as pro-mortalism, the view that it is often prudent for individuals to kill themselves and often right for them to kill others, even without their consent. It pretty clearly has these implications if one can kill oneself or others painlessly, but probably does so even if there would be terror beforehand; for there would be terror regardless of when death comes, and if death were to come sooner rather than later, then additional bads that would have been expected in the course of a life would be nipped in the bud."&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Belshaw,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Belshaw|2012|page=118}}: "Negative utilitarianism can be plucked from the shelf, but there is no good reason to suppose it true. And were it true, it would take us too far, generating not only anti-natalism but straightaway also its pro-mortalist neighbour."&lt;/ref&gt; and Ingmar Persson.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Persson|2009|page=38}}: “negative utilitarianism seems implausible, as is shown by an argument sketched by McMahan, on the basis of an argument originally put forward by Richard Sikora (1978). This argument turns on the observation that if what would be bad for individuals in life is a reason against conceiving them, but what would be good for them is no reason in favour of conceiving them, then, as far as those individuals are concerned, it is wrong to conceive them, however much good their lives will contain, provided that they will also contain something that is bad for them. This seems clearly absurd.”&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Joseph Mendola develops a modification of utilitarianism, and he says that his principle

{{quote|is a kind of maximin rule.... The principle also resembles a form of utilitarianism which is familiar from the work of Popper and the Smart brothers, negative utilitarianism. That too suggests we should concern ourselves before all else with the elimination of pain.{{sfn|Mendola|1990|p=86}}}} Professor Henry Hiz writes favorably of negative utilitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hiz|1992|page=423}}: "Utilitarianism failed, but what is sometimes called ‘negative utilitarianism’ avoids many of the shortcomings of classical utilitarianism. It is a good candidate for an ethics that expresses the Enlightenment tradition."&lt;/ref&gt; Fabian Fricke published the German article "Verschiedene Versionen des negativen Utilitarismus."{{sfn|Fricke|2002}} In book format, Jonathan Leighton has defended 'negative utilitarianism plus', which holds the reduction of suffering to be of highest importance, while also valuing the continued existence of sentient beings.{{sfn|Leighton|2011}}

'''''Nemo iudex in causa sua''''' (or ''nemo iudex in sua causa'') is a [[Latin]] phrase that means, literally, "no-one should be a judge in his own case." It is a principle of [[natural justice]] that no person can judge a case in which they have an interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legal-glossary.org/nemo-judex-in-sua-causa/ |title=Legal definition of Nemo iudex in causa sua |publisher=legal-glossary.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule is very strictly applied to any appearance of a possible bias, even if there is actually none: "Justice must not only be done, but must be seen to be done".&lt;ref&gt;''[[R v Sussex Justices, ex parte McCarthy]]'', [1924] 1 KB 256, [1923] All ER 233&lt;/ref&gt;

This principle may also be called:
* ''nemo judex idoneus in propria causa est''
* ''nemo judex in parte sua''
* ''nemo judex in re sua''
* ''nemo debet esse judex in propria causa''
* ''in propria causa nemo judex''

The legal effect of a breach of natural justice is normally to stop the proceedings and render any judgment invalid; it should be quashed or appealed, but may be remitted for a valid re-hearing.

The phrase is credited to Sir [[Edward Coke]] in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/show_me_the_money_states_aba_try_to_figure_out_when_campaign_cash_adds_up ABA Journal,] "Show Me the Money: States, ABA Try to Figure Out When Campaign Cash Leads to a Judge’s Recusal", 1 March 2012 (retrieved 28 June 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is also found in ''The Moral Sayings of Publius Syrus, a Roman Slave'' (1856), by Darius Lyman, Jun., A. M.

Both neoteny and progenesis cause the retention in adults of traits previously seen only in the young. Such retention is important in [[evolutionary biology]], [[domestication]] and [[evolutionary developmental biology]].

==History and etymology==
[[File:Heterochrony.svg|thumb|upright=2|Diagram of the six types of shift in [[heterochrony]], a change in the timing or rate of any process in [[embryonic development]]. Predisplacement, hypermorphosis, and acceleration (red) extend development ([[peramorphosis]]); postdisplacement, hypomorphosis, and deceleration (blue) all truncate it (paedomorphosis).]]
The origins of the concept of neoteny have been traced to the Bible (as argued by [[Ashley Montagu]]) and to the poet [[William Wordsworth]]'s "[[My Heart Leaps Up|The Child is the father of the Man]]" (as argued by Barry Bogin). The term itself was invented in 1885 by [[Julius Kollmann]] as he described the [[axolotl]]'s maturation while remaining in a [[tadpole]]-like aquatic stage complete with gills, unlike other adult [[amphibians]] like frogs and toads.&lt;ref name=Bogin1999&gt;{{cite book |last=Bogin |first=Barry |title=Patterns of Human Growth |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ScfPjwF3BngC&amp;pg=PA158 |year=1999 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-56438-0 |pages=157–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''neoteny'' is borrowed from the [[German language|German]] ''Neotenie'', the latter constructed by Kollmann from the [[Greek language|Greek]] νέος (''neos'', "young") and τείνειν (''teínein'', "to stretch, to extend"). The [[adjective]] is either "neotenic" or "neotenous".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/neoteny Neoteny], ''The Free Dictionary''. 2011. Accessed April 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; For the opposite of "neotenic", different authorities use either "gerontomorphic"&lt;ref name="Henke"&gt;Henke, W. (2007). Handbook of paleoanthropology, Volume 1. Springer Books, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hether"&gt;Hetherington, R. (2010). The Climate Connection: Climate Change and Modern Human Evolution. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; or "[[peramorphosis|peramorphic]]".&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;Hall, B.K., Hallgrímsson, B. Monroe, W.S. (2008). Strickberger's evolution: the integration of genes, organisms and populations. Jones and Bartlett Publishers: Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; Bogin points out that Kollmann had intended the meaning to be "retaining youth", but had evidently confused the Greek ''teínein'' with the Latin ''tenere'', which had the meaning he wanted, "to retain", so that the new word would mean "the retaining of youth (into adulthood)".&lt;ref name=Bogin1999/&gt;

In 1926, Louis Bolk described neoteny as the major process in humanization.&lt;ref name="Bogin1999"/&gt; In his 1977 book ''[[Ontogeny and Phylogeny]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gould |first1=Stephen Jay |title=Ontogeny and Phylogeny |date=1977 |publisher=Belknap (Harvard University Press) |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=0-674-63940-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven Jay Gould]] noted that Bolk's account constituted an attempted justification for "scientific" racism and sexism, but acknowledged that Bolk had been right in the core idea that humans differ from other [[primates]] in becoming sexually mature in an infantile stage of body development.&lt;ref name=Bogin1999/&gt;

==In humans==
[[File:Betty Boop colored patent.png|thumb|upright|"The cartoon of [[Betty Boop]] illustrates some human features which are sometimes labeled as neotenous, such as a large head, short arms and legs relative to total height, and clumsy, child–like movements." — [[Barry Bogin]]&lt;ref name=Bogin1999/&gt;]]

{{main|Neoteny in humans}}

Neoteny in humans is the slowing or delaying of body development, compared to non-human [[primates]], resulting in features such as a large head, a flat face, and relatively short arms and legs. These neotenic changes may have been brought about by [[sexual selection in human evolution]]. In turn, they may have permitted the development of human capacities such as emotional communication. However, humans also have relatively large noses and long legs, both [[peramorphic]] (not neotenic) traits. Some evolutionary theorists have proposed that neoteny was a key feature in [[human evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shea |first1=Brian T. |title=Heterochrony in human evolution: The case for neoteny reconsidered |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology |date=1989 |volume=32 |issue=S10 |pages=69–101 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330320505|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.1330320505/pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gould argued that the "evolutionary story" of humans is one where we have been "retaining to adulthood the originally juvenile features of our ancestors".&lt;ref name="Mickey"&gt;Gould, S.J. A Biological Homage to Mickey Mouse.&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. B. S. Haldane]] mirrors Gould's hypothesis by stating a "major evolutionary trend in human beings" is "greater prolongation of childhood and retardation of maturity."&lt;ref name="Montagu" /&gt; [[Del Thiessen|Delbert D. Thiessen]] said that "neoteny becomes more apparent as early primates evolved into later forms" and that primates have been "evolving toward flat face."&lt;ref name="Bitter"&gt;Thiessen, D.D. (1997). Bittersweet destiny: the stormy evolution of human behavior. Transaction Publishers, N.J.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in light of some groups using arguments based around neoteny to support [[racism]], Gould also argued "that the whole enterprise of ranking groups by degree of neoteny is fundamentally unjustified" (Gould, 1996, pg. 150).&lt;ref name=mismeasure&gt;Gould, S.J. (1996). The mismeasure of man. W.W. Norton and Company, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt; Doug Jones argued that human evolution's trend toward neoteny may have been caused by [[sexual selection in human evolution]] for neotenous facial traits in women by men with the resulting neoteny in male faces being a "by-product" of [[sexual selection]] for neotenous female faces.&lt;ref name="DJones"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Jones | first1=D. | display-authors=etal   | year=1995 | title=Sexual selection, physical attractiveness, and facial neoteny: Cross-cultural evidence and implications [and comments and reply] | url=| journal=Current Anthropology | volume=36 | issue=5| pages=723–748 | doi=10.1086/204427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In domestic animals==
{{further|Domestication of animals}}

Neoteny is seen in domesticated animals such as dogs and mice.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Price | first1=E. | year=1999 | title=Behavioral development in animals undergoing domestication | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168159199000878 | journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume=65 | issue=3| pages=245–271 | doi=10.1016/S0168-1591(99)00087-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because there are more resources available, less competition for those resources, and with the lowered competition the animals expend less energy obtaining those resources. This allows them to mature and reproduce more quickly than their wild counterparts.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; The environment that domesticated animals are raised in determines whether or not neoteny is present in those animals. Evolutionary neoteny can arise in a species when those conditions occur, and a species becomes sexually mature ahead of its "normal development". Another explanation for the neoteny in domesticated animals can be the selection for certain behavioral characteristics. Behavior is linked to genetics which therefore means that when a behavioral trait is selected for, a physical trait may also be selected for due to mechanisms like [[linkage disequilibrium]]. Often, juvenile behaviors are selected for in order to domesticate more easily a species; aggressiveness in certain species comes with adulthood when there is a need to compete for resources. If there is no need for competition, then there is no need for aggression. Selecting for juvenile behavioral characteristics can lead to neoteny in physical characteristics because, for example, with the reduced need for behaviors like aggression there is no need for developed traits that would help in that area. Traits that may become neotenized due to decreased aggression may be a shorter muzzle and smaller general size among the domesticated individuals. Some common neotenous physical traits in domesticated animals (mainly dogs, pigs, ferrets, cats, and even foxes) include: floppy ears, changes in reproductive cycle, curly tails, piebald coloration, fewer or shortened vertebra, large eyes, rounded forehead, large ears, and shortened muzzle.&lt;ref name="Bertone, J. 2006"&gt;Bertone, J. (2006). Equine geriatric medicine and surgery. Saunders, MI.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Trut | first1=L.

[[File:Unnatural selection, 2 heads, one species.jpg|thumb|left|Neoteny and reduction in skull size - grey wolf and chihuahua skulls]]

When the role of dogs expanded from just being [[Working Group (dogs)|working dogs]] to also being [[companion dog|companions]], humans started [[selective breeding]] dogs for [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] neoteny, and this selective breeding for "neoteny or paedomorphism" had the effect of enhancing the bond between humans and dogs.&lt;!-- The exact words used for this was "strengthened the human-canine bond".

In 2004, a study that used 310 wolf skulls and over 700 dog skulls representing 100 breeds concluded that the evolution of dog skulls can generally not be described by heterochronic processes such as neoteny although some pedomorphic dog breeds have skulls that resemble the skulls of juvenile wolves.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, Abby Grace, "Evolution and development of the skull morphology of canids: An investigation of morphological integration and heterochrony" (January 1, 2004).

==In other species==

Neoteny has been observed in many other species. It is important to note the difference between partial and full neoteny when looking at other species in order to distinguish between juvenile traits that are only advantageous in the short term and traits that provide a benefit throughout the organism’s life; this might then provide some insight into the cause of neoteny in those species. Partial neoteny is the retention of the larval form beyond the usual age of maturation with the possibility of the development of sexual organs [[progenesis]], but eventually the organism still matures into the adult form; this can be seen in ''[[Lithobates clamitans]]''. Full neoteny is seen in ''[[Ambystoma mexicanum]]'' and some populations of ''[[Ambystoma tigrinum]]'', which remain in their larval form for the duration of their life.&lt;ref name="Swingle, W. 1922 pp.397-421"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Swingle | first1=W. | year=1922 | title=Experiments on the metamorphosis of neotenous amphibians | url=| journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology | volume=36 | issue=4| pages=397–421 | doi=10.1002/jez.1400360402 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amphibiaweb.org/species/3850|title=Ambystoma tigrinum|author=|date=|publisher=Amphibia Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lithobates clamitans'' is partially neotenous: it delays its maturation through the winter season, because it is not advantageous for it to metamorphose into the adult form until there are more resources available: it can find those resources much more easily in the larval form. This would fall under both of the main causes of neoteny; the energy required to survive in the winter as a newly formed adult is too costly, so the organism exhibits neotenous characteristics until a time when it is capable of better survival as an adult. ''Ambystoma tigrinum'' retains its neotenous features for a similar reason, however the retention is permanent due to the lack of resources available throughout its lifetime. This is another example of an environmental cause of neoteny in that the species retains juvenile characteristics because the environment limits the ability of the organism to fully come into its adult form. A few species of birds show partial neoteny. A couple of examples of such species are the manakin birds ''[[Chiroxiphia linearis]]'' and ''[[Chiroxiphia caudata]]''. The males of both species retain their juvenile plumage into adulthood, but they eventually lose it once they are fully mature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Foster | first1=M. | year=1987 | title=Delayed maturation, neoteny, and social system differences in two manakins of genus ''Chiroxyphia'' | url=| journal=Evolution | volume=41 | issue=3| pages=547–558 | doi=10.2307/2409256}}&lt;/ref&gt; In certain species of birds the retention of juvenile plumage is often linked to the molting times within each species. In order to ensure there is no overlap between the molting and mating times, the birds may show partial neoteny in regards to their plumage so that the males do not attain their bright adult plumage before the females are prepared to mate. In this instance, neoteny is present because there is no need for the males to molt early and it would be a waste of energy for them to try to mate while the females are still immature.

Neoteny is commonly seen in flightless insects like the females in the order [[Strepsiptera]]. The flightless trait in insects has evolved many separate times; environments that may have contributed to the separate evolution of this trait are: high altitudes, isolation on islands, and insects that reside in colder climates.&lt;ref name="Barbosa, P. 1989"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Barbosa | first1=P. | display-authors=etal   | year=1989 | title=Life-history traits of forest-inhabiting flightless Lepidoptera | journal=American Midland Naturalist | volume=122 | issue=2| pages=262–274 | jstor=2425912 | doi=10.2307/2425912}}&lt;/ref&gt; These environmental factors may be responsible for the flightless trait, because in these situations it would be disadvantageous to have a population that is more dispersed, so flightlessness would be favored due to the boundaries it poses to dispersal. Also, in cooler temperatures heat is lost more rapidly through wings, thus the circumstance favors flightlessness. Another couple of main points to note about insects are that the females in certain groups become sexually mature without [[metamorphosis|metamorphosing]] into adulthood, and some insects which grow up in certain conditions do not ever develop wings. Flightlessness in some female insects has been linked to higher [[fecundity]], this would increase the fitness of the individual because the female is producing more offspring and therefore passing on more of her genes.&lt;ref name="Barbosa, P. 1989"/&gt; In those instances, neoteny occurs because it is more advantageous for the females to remain flightless in order to conserve energy which thereby increases their [[fecundity]]. [[Aphid]]s are a great example of insects that may never develop wings due to their environmental setting. If resources are abundant there is no need to grow wings and disperse. When the nutrition of a host plant is abundant, aphids may not grow wings, remaining on the host plant for the duration of their lives; however, if the resources become diminished, their offspring may develop wings in order to disperse to other host plants.&lt;ref name=Harrison1980/&gt;

Two common environments that tend to favor neoteny are high-altitude and cool environments because neotenous individuals have a higher fitness than those that metamorphose into the adult form. This is because the energy required for metamorphosis is too costly for the individual’s fitness, also the conditions favor neoteny due to the ability of neotenous individuals to utilize the available resources more easily.&lt;ref name="Snyder, R. 1956"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Snyder | first1=R | year=1956 | title=Comparative Features of the Life Histories of ''Ambystoma gracile'' (Baird) from Populations at Low and High Altitudes | journal=Copeia | volume=1956 | issue=1| pages=41–50 | jstor=1439242 | doi=10.2307/1439242}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend can be seen in the comparison of salamander species of lower and higher altitudes. The neotenous individuals have higher [[survivorship]] as well as higher fecundity than the salamanders that had gone to the adult form in the higher altitude and cooler environment.&lt;ref name="Snyder, R. 1956"/&gt; Insects in cooler environments tend to show neoteny in flight because wings have a high surface area and lose heat quickly, thus it is not advantageous for insects in that environment to metamorphose into adults.&lt;ref name="Barbosa, P. 1989"/&gt;

Many species of salamander, and amphibians in general, are known to have neotenized characteristics because of the environment they live in. [[Axolotl]] and [[olm]] are species of salamander that retains their juvenile aquatic form throughout adulthood, examples of full neoteny. Gills are a common juvenile characteristic in amphibians that are kept after maturation; an example of this would be a comparison of the tiger salamander and the rough-skinned newt, both of which retain gills into adulthood.&lt;ref name="Swingle, W. 1922 pp.397-421"/&gt;

[[Pygmy chimpanzee]]s (bonobos) share many physical characteristics with humans. A prime example is their neotenous skulls.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Shea | first1=B. T. | year=1983 | title=Paedomorphosis and Neoteny in the Pygmy Chimpanzee | journal=Science | volume=222 | issue=4623| pages=521–522 | jstor=1691380 | doi=10.1126/science.6623093 | pmid=6623093}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shape of their skull does not change into adulthood; it only increases in size. This is due to [[sexual dimorphism]] and an evolutionary change in timing of development.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Juveniles became sexually mature before their bodies had fully developed into adulthood, and due to some selective advantage the neotenic structure of the skull remained in later generations.

In some species, energy costs result in neoteny, as in the insect families [[Gerridae]], [[Delphacidae]], and [[Carabidae]]. Many of the species in these families have smaller, neotenous wings or no wings at all.&lt;ref name=Harrison1980&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Harrison | first1=R | year=1980 | title=Dispersal polymorphisms in insects | journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume=11 | issue=| pages=95–118 | jstor=2096904 | doi=10.1146/annurev.es.11.110180.000523}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, some cricket species shed their wings in adulthood,&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Harrison | first1=R | year=1980 | title=Dispersal Polymorphisms in Insects | journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume=11 | issue=| pages=95–118 | jstor=2096904 | doi=10.1146/annurev.es.11.110180.000523}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in beetles of the genus ''[[Ozopemon]]'', the males (thought to be the first example of neoteny in the Coleoptera) are significantly smaller than the females, through [[inbreeding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Jordal | first1=B.

In other species, environmental conditions cause neoteny, as in the [[northwestern salamander]] (''Ambystoma gracile''), where higher altitude is correlated with greater neotenic tendencies, perhaps to help conserve energy as mentioned above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Eagleson | first1=G. | last2=McKeown | first2=B. | year=1978 | title=Changes in thyroid activity of ''Ambystoma gracile'' (Baird) during different larval, transforming, and postmetamorphic phases | url=| journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology | volume=56 | issue=6| pages=1377–1381 | doi=10.1139/z/78-190 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, neoteny is found in a few species of the crustacean family [[Asellota#Classification|Ischnomesidae]], which live in deep ocean waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Brokeland | first1=W. | last2=Brandt | first2=A. | year=2004 | title=Two new species of Ischnomesidae (Crustacea: Isopoda) from the Southern Ocean displaying neoteny | url=| journal=Deep-Sea Research Part II | volume=51 | issue=14-16| pages=1769–1785 | doi=10.1016/j.dsr2.2004.06.034 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter of Poitiers''' ([[Latin]]: ''Petrus Pictaviensis'') was a French [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] theologian,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11773b.htm Peter of Poitiers] - [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] article&lt;/ref&gt; born at [[Poitiers]] or in its neighbourhood about 1130. He died in Paris, probably in 1215 (though Ulrich Rehm dates Peter's death to 1205 in "Bebilderte Vaterunser-Erklärungen des Mittelalters", Baden-Baden 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;62)

==Life==

He studied at the [[University of Paris]], where he became professor of theology and lectured for thirty-eight years. In 1169 he succeeded [[Peter Comestor]] in the chair of scholastic theology. His lectures were inspired the enmity of [[Gauthier de St-Victor]], one of the bitterest opponents of Scholasticism, who ranked him with [[Gilbert de la Porrée]], [[Abelard]], and [[Peter Lombard]] in the pamphlet wherein he tries to throw ridicule on the four doctors, under the name of the ''Four Labyrinths of France''.

As [[Chancellor of the University of Paris|Chancellor]] of the Church of Paris he displayed great zeal on behalf of poor students, and to supply their want of text-books, which were very expensive, he had a kind of synopsis engraved on the walls of the classrooms for their assistance.

In 1191 he was appointed by [[Pope Celestine III]] to settle a dispute between the Abbeys of St-Eloi and St-Victor. He was a constant correspondent of Celestine III and [[Pope Innocent III]]. Certain writers believe that he died [[Bishop of Embrun]]; the ''[[Gallia Christiana Nova]]'' shows that he was only Chancellor of Paris.

==Works==

In 1179 he published five books of sentences which are a synopsis of his lectures. His doctrine is orthodox, but, though containing no condemned proposition, it arguably exhibits more subtlety than theology based on Holy Scripture.

He wrote commentaries, still unedited, on [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Leviticus]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]], and the [[Psalms]]. A chronological and genealogical abridgment of the Bible is attributed to him, but the authorship is uncertain.  His works were published by Dom [[Hugo Mathoud]] with those of [[Robert Pullus]] (Paris, 1855).

'''Phan Châu Trinh''' ({{zh|潘周楨}}, 1871 - 1926), [[courtesy name]] '''Tử Cán''' (梓幹), [[pen name]] '''Tây Hồ''' (西湖) or '''Hi Mã''' (希馬), was an early 20th-century [[Vietnam]]ese [[nationalism|nationalist]]. He sought to end France's colonial occupation of [[Vietnam]]. He opposed both violence and turning to other countries for support, and instead believed in attaining Vietnamese liberation by educating the population and by appealing to French democratic principles.
==Biography==
Phan Châu Trinh was born in [[Tây Lộc]], [[Quảng Nam Province]] in Annam, French Indochina on 9 September 1872. He was the son of a rich land owner and scholar. His father was a fighter in the Scholars' Revolt, but in 1885 he was killed by the other leaders in the revolt who suspected him of being a traitor. This left Trinh an orphan at the age of 13. His older brother educated him in classics. In 1901 he got the highest [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] degree. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In 1905 Trinh resigned from his post in the mandarin bureaucracy. He had become strongly opposed to the monarchy, traditional Chinese Confucian-influenced Vietnamese court and mandarin system. He called for an end to the monarchy and its replacement with a democratic republic. Having earlier met [[Phan Bội Châu]] in 1903, in March/April 1906 he went to [[Hong Kong]] and then to [[Kwangtung]] to meet with him again. He made his way there disguised as a disheveled common laborer. He then went to Japan with Châu as part of the Đông-Du movement. They stayed in [[Yokohama]], where they had set up a two-story Japanese house to teach students, which they called Binh Ngo Hien. In June they went to Tokyo to inspect the Japanese education and political system.

Trinh disagreed with Châu's early ideas of asking for military assistance from Japan, as he didn't trust Japan's militarism. He also had other disagreements with Châu's philosophy. Therefore, they had a friendly argument for a few weeks before he returned to Vietnam. Back in Vietnam he continued to receive letters from Châu arguing about his opposition to the monarchy and his belief that the French could be used. Trinh continued to campaign with slogans like "Up with Democracy, Out with Monarchy", and "Making Use of the French in the Quest for Progress". This made Châu quite upset and worried that the movement was fragmenting and that fundraising efforts would fail.  {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In 1906 he wrote to the French Governor General Paul Beau. He asked the French to live up to their civilising mission. He blamed them for the exploitation of the countryside by Vietnamese collaborators. He called on France to develop modern legal, educational, and economic institutions in Vietnam and industrialise the country, and to remove the remnants of the mandarin system. In 1907 he opened a patriotic modern school for young Vietnamese men and women. The school was called [[Tonkin Free School|Đông Kinh Nghĩa Thục (aka Tonkin Free School)]]. He was a lecturer at the school, and Châu's writings were also used. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The school carefully avoided doing anything illegal. Its ideas attacked the brutality of the French occupation of Vietnam, but also wanted to learn modernisation from the French. The school required scholars to renounce their elitist traditions and learn from the masses. It also offered the peasants a modern education. After peasant tax revolts erupted in 1908, Trinh was arrested, and his school was closed. He was sentenced to death, but it was commuted to life imprisonment after his progressive admirers in France intervened. He was sent to Côn Đảo island. In 1911, after three years, he was pardoned and sentenced to house arrest. He said he would rather return to prison than have partial freedom. So instead he was deported to France, where the French continued to monitor him. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

He went to Paris in 1915 to get the support of progressive French politicians and Vietnamese exiles. There he worked with Hồ Chí Minh, Phan Văn Trường, Nguyễn Thế Truyền, and Nguyễn An Ninh in "The Group of Vietnamese Patriots". The group was based at 6 Villa des Gobelins. There they wrote patriotic articles signed with the name ''Nguyễn Ái Quốc'' which Hồ Chí Minh later used, "on behalf of the Group of Vietnamese Patriots". He worked as a photograph retoucher to support himself while he was in France. He returned to [[Saigon]] in 1925, where he died on 24 March 1926, aged 53. His funeral was attended by 60,000 people and caused big protests across the country demanding the end of French colonial occupation, which would not occur for three more decades. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Debates with other nationalists==

In Tokyo, Trinh told Châu: "The level of their people is so high, and the level of our people is so low! How could we not become slaves? That some students now can enter Japanese schools has been your great achievement. Please stay on in Tokyo to take a quiet rest and devote yourself to writing, and not to making appeals for combat against the French. You should only call for 'popular rights and popular enlightenment.' Once popular rights have been achieved, then we can think about other things."

Châu commented: "Thereafter over more than ten days, he and I debated time and again, and our opinions were diametrically opposed. That is to say, he wished to overthrow the monarchy in order to create a basis for the promotion of popular rights; I, on the contrary, maintained that first the foreign enemy should be driven out, and after our nation's independence was restored we could talk about other things. My plan was to make use of the monarchy, which he opposed absolutely. His plan was to raise up the people to abolish the monarchy, with which I absolutely disagreed. In other words, he and I were pursuing one and the same goal, but our means were considerably different. He wished to start by relying on the French to abolish the monarchy, but I wished to start by driving out the French to restore Vietnam - That was the difference. However, even though his political view was the opposite of mine, he liked me personally a great deal and we roomed together for several weeks. Then all of a sudden he decided to return to our country." {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Legacy==
Most cities in Vietnam have named major streets after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vietnam Country Map|publisher=Periplus Travel Maps|year=2002&amp;ndash;03|isbn=0-7946-0070-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Qalandar Baba Auliya''' ({{lang-ur|قلندر با با اولیا}}) is the title of the [[Sufi]] mystic '''[[Syed]] Muhammad Azeem Barkhiyya''' (1898 &amp;ndash; 27 January 1979), the founder of the [[Azeemiyya]] order of Sufis. He was given the honorifics ''Abdal-i-Haq'' and  ''Hasn-e-Ukhra''.&lt;ref name="Azeemiyya Silsila"&gt;{{cite web|title=Qalandar Baba Auliya |url=http://azeemiasilsila.org/qalandar_baba.php |date= |accessdate=28 August 2015 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811181332/http://azeemiasilsila.org/qalandar_baba.php |archivedate=11 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Life and education==
Qalandar Baba Auliya was born in Khorja, [[Bulandshahr]], which is in the [[Uttar Pradesh|U.P. province of India]] in 1898.

Qalandar Baba Auliya received his primary and religious education in a local school. He went to high school in Bulandshahr. After completing his education in high school, he went to Aligarh Muslim University in [[Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh|Aligarh]], now in India.

During his stay in Aligarh, Qalandar Baba Auliya became inclined towards learning spirituality. He spent a lot of time at the tomb of the Sufi Maulana Kabuli. It was in those times, when he went to visit his maternal grand father, [[Tajuddin Muhammad Badruddin]]. Teacher of the teachers, Knower of Divine Secrets, Baba Tajuddin instructed his grand son to stay with him in Nagpur for Spiritual training. Upon learning his son's intention to learn spiritual knowledge, Qalandar Baba's father came to Nagpur to persuade his son to complete his academic education. Baba Tajuddin replied to his father that if he would receive academic education any more, he would not be useful to him. His father left his son to his own liking.

Qalandar Baba Auliya stayed with Tajuddin Baba Auliya, whom he called grandfather (Nana), for nine years. During this time, he received his spiritual training from him in an arduous manner.

==Family==
When Qalandar Baba's mother died, she left behind six children- of whom he was the second oldest, only to his elder sister. [[Tajuddin Muhammad Badruddin|Tajuddin Baba]] advised him to get married. He married the daughter of one of the followers of Tajuddin Baba Auliya in [[Delhi]]. In 1947, [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] of [[Pakistan]], Qalandar Baba Auliya migrated to [[Karachi]] in Pakistan with his father, siblings and his family. He rented an old house near Lee Market. The Commissioner for Rehabilitation, who was also one of the followers of Tajuddin Baba, requested him to lodge an application with him so that he could be allocate a house to him. He did not take any notice of his suggestion and continued to reside in a rented premise.

Qalandar Baba seldom washed his hands with soap. He washed his hands with lukewarm water until all traces of grease were removed. He was very meticulous and organised in his day-to-day life. He did not sleep for more than two to three hours. He went through phases of silence and [[Religious ecstasy|spiritual ecstasy]] and [[Altruism|selflessness]].

==Occupation==
After marriage, Qalander Baba settled in Delhi. He became a freelance journalist for different newspapers and magazines. He also proofread and corrected the works of the contemporary poets. People who were interested in Tassuvuf (spiritual knowledge or Sufism) approached him and held discussions with him on the subject.

After [[Human migration|migrating]] to Karachi he opted repairing of domestic electrical appliances till he had the job as the sub editor of the daily newspaper Dawn. He also worked for the monthly Naqqad for some time. He edited many magazines, and also published many stories in serial form.

==Initiation==
{{POV section|date=May 2015}}
In 1956 the then master of the [[Suhrawardiyya]] Order, Hazrat Abul Faiz Qalandar Ali Suhrawardi visited Karachi. Qalander Baba Auliya went for an audience with him and requested to be initiated. Hazrat Abul Faiz asked him to come at 3 O' clock in the morning. In the bitter cold of the early morning, he sat on the steps of the Grand Hotel on McLeod Road, Karachi; exactly at 3 O' clock Hazrat Abul Faiz opened the door and asked him to come inside. He instructed Qalandar Baba to sit in front of him and then he blew on Qalandar Baba's forehead 3 times. With the first breath the realm of spirits was revealed. With the second blowing of the breath, angels and the Divine Attributes was revealed and with the third breath the highest realm was revealed to him. Hazrat Abul Faiz Qalandar Ali Soharwardi imparted spiritual training to him in three weeks time.

After that Qalandar Baba's spiritual training was taken over by the soul of Sheikh Najmuddin Kubra. When the training was completed He transferred the spiritual knowledge to him and presented him to the Divine Presence of God.

During this period Qalander Baba Aulia did not sleep for ten days and nights. He prayed and chanted the holy verses all the time.

To spread the teachings of Qalandar Baba Auliya, three books have been written by Silsela-e-Azeemia.  
* Loh-o-Qalum (Pen and the Scripturum), A treasure of divine knowledge of mysteries and secrets of nature.
* Rubaiyat-e-Qalander Baba Auliya, a collection of mystic verses.
* Tazkira-e-Tajuddin Baba (Blessed be he), An work of metaphysical sciences and scientific interpretations of divinations and wonder-workings performed by spiritual people.

Additionally, Qalandar Baba Auliya left maps and diagrams of the visible and invisible realms. He started the publication of the monthly magazine called ''Roohani Digest'', and formed a trust called The Azeemiyya Trust. The trust acquired land and constructed a mausoleum over his resting place in Shadman Town, North Karachi.

==Miracles==
Pigeon that came to life:
I loved pigeons and pigeon keeping was my hobby. Once a dove joined the flock of pigeons and started living with them. The dove was crossed with one of the pigeons. When she laid  and the chicks hatched out they were extraordinary pretty. They had black wings. Rest of the body was pure white. They were so attractive that every one would praise them for their beauty.
One day, one of these pigeons fell prey to a cat. I chased the cat. By the time I reached the cat on the roof, the cat had killed the pigeon and was busy in devouring on the prey. Tears came to my eyes with grief and anger. In that state of shock I came to His Divine Grace Qalander Baba Auliya and in a very hurt tone told him that the cat killed my pigeon, which I adored the most. He calmly commented, "It happens so."

I feeling grieved even more, said, "I am at loss to understand that how a cat could dare to prey on my pigeon in your presence," I was quite desperate, I went to the kitchen with a heavy heart. His divine Grace, Qalandar Baba Auliya called out my name twice. Grief and anger had made me arrogant and I ignored his calls. When I came out of the kitchen, I saw my pigeon pecking in the compound. I couldn't believe my eyes. I ran upstairs and found feathers and blood spots on the roof. I felt ashamed of myself. Came down and fell on the feet of His Divine Grace and apologised for my indecorous behaviour. Before evening I distributed all the pigeons to my friends and decided to stay away from the hobby.

Deaf and Dumb Girl: 
A born deaf and dumb girl was brought to Qalandear Baba Auliya. Those who have been close to Babaji know it well that he was a very cautious person by nature and avoided any performance of wonder working. God knows in what state he was at that time. He addressed the girl and asked her name. The dumb girl naturally remained mute. He asked her again. Now this time more commandingly "Tell, what is your name?" She kept staring in silence. Now he was angry he lifted his hand as if to hit her and said in an enraged tone, "Tell what is your name?"

And to the surprise of all those who were there, she uttered her name and started speaking normally thereafter. She was sixteen or seventeen at that time.

Spiritual Healing of Tumor:
Once a lady visited Qalandar Baba Auliya and told him that there was a tumor preventing her to bear children. She said, "I am otherwise a contented person but due to my inability to bear children my husband is insisting on for second marriage."

And, after saying this all she started crying desperately in sobs. In that fit of crying she drew near to Qalandar Baba Auliya and placed her head on his chest. Tears not only soaked the shirt but affected his heart as well. Getting up, he told her to lie down straight. Recited something and blew upon his index finger and made a cross where the tumor was supposed to be. When the doctors tested her they found that tumor was no more there. Allah, the most exalted also blessed her with children after that.

==Death==
Qalandar Baba Auliya died on 27 January 1979 in Karachi. Every year on this date his Urs is celebrated which is attended by thousands of people from all over the country and abroad. During Urs many seminars and workshops are held. There are organised sessions of meditation under the instruction of the present Master of Silsila Azeemiyya; Khwaja Shamsuddin Azeemi.

Qalandar Baba Auliya left a widow, two sons and two daughters.

One week before his death he told his disciples and friends; "I am a guest here for a maximum of one week". He appointed Khwaja Shamsuddin Azeemi head of the order of the [[Azeemia]] and died, on 27 January 1979. His tomb is in the Shadman Town subdivision of Karachi.&lt;ref name="sufiblog.com"&gt;[http://sufiblog.com/qalandar-baba-auliya.html sufi] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509133131/http://sufiblog.com/qalandar-baba-auliya.html |date=9 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="856">In [[geometry]], the '''Segment Addition Postulate''' states that given 2 [[Point (geometry)|point]]s A and C, a third point B lies on the [[line segment]] AC [[if and only if]] the [[distance]]s between the points satisfy the [[equation]] AB + BC = AC. This is related to the [[triangle inequality]], which states that AB + BC &lt;math&gt;\geq&lt;/math&gt; AC with equality if and only if A, B, and C are [[collinear]] (on the same line). This in turn is equivalent to the proposition that the shortest distance between two points lies on a straight line.

The segment addition postulate is often useful in proving results on the [[Congruence (geometry)|congruence]] of segments.

[[File:Zagraevsky.jpg|thumb|Sergey Zagraevsky]]

==Art==

Zagraevsky's art&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zagraevsky.com/paint_engl.htm Sergey Zagraevsky's pictures]&lt;/ref&gt; does not belong to the classic [[primitive art|primitive]] or [[Naïve art|naïve]] schools, since neither the formal nor actual parameters of primitive art are met. Instead, his style is best described as "[[primitivism]]", a genre which includes the "primitive" paintings of many artists who had an academic apprenticeship and extensive experience in other styles such as [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Mikhail Larionov]], [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Paul Klee]]. 
There are some differences in Zagraevsky's style; his landscape paintings are  "childish" in using a reverse perspective, the absence of [[chiaroscuro]] and the relatively accurate portrayal of parts. Zagraevsky uses predominantly open colours giving his paintings brightness comparable to children's painting. His paintings contain neither humour or violence as this are not normally seen in the art of children.

Since about 2000, Zagraevsky's works have become slightly more generalized and varied while retaining their brightness. Details are drawn less carefully although the works remain "childish", with the hand of an experienced artist visible only in the stability of the stroke, the virtuoso technique of painting and drawing, and the compositional and the color balance. There remain recurring features in his art such as a "flattened" sun, squat trees with huge roots, multi-colored water, "album-styled" flowers and illuminated windows.

In the 1990s [[Bulat Okudzhava]] wrote of Zagraevsky:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zagraevsky.com/poes1_engl.htm Full poem of Bulat Okudzhava]&lt;/ref&gt;

:When he moves on a picture his fist,
:God is at his assist.
:God is with him all his way.
:That is the painter Sergey.

{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
[[File:Toshodaiji Nara Nara pref04s5s4290.jpg|thumb|300px|Part of [[Tōshōdai-ji]]'s ''garan'' (left to right, the ''kondō'', the ''kōdō'', the ''korō'' and the ''raidō'')]]{{nihongo|'''''Shichidō garan'''''}} is a [[Buddhism in Japan|Japanese Buddhist]] term indicating the seven [[Dō (architecture)|halls]] composing the ideal Buddhist temple compound. This compound word is composed by the word {{nihongo|''shichidō''|七堂|}}, literally meaning "seven halls", and {{nihongo|''garan''|伽藍}}, meaning "temple". The term is often shortened to just ''garan''. Which seven halls the term refers to varies, and it is also pointed out that 七堂 is possibly a misinterpretation of {{nihongo|''shitsudō''|悉堂}}, meaning a complete temple.&lt;ref name="kojien"&gt;Iwanami [[Kōjien]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kosetsu"&gt;Kōsetsu Bukkyō Daijiten (広説仏教語大辞典)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Japanese character 七 can also be pronounced ''shitsu''.&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, ''shichidō garan'' often simply means a large temple with many buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Imaizumi | first = Yoshio | title = Nihon Bukkyo Shi Jiten | publisher = Yoshikawa Kobunkan | location = City | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-4-642-01334-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; See below for more details about what are the possible seven buildings included.

==Etymology and history of the term==
{{nihongo|''Garan''|伽藍}}&lt;ref&gt;Also called {{nihongo|sōen|僧園}} {{nihongo|shūen|衆園}} and {{nihongo|shōja|精舎}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Japanese is an abbreviated form of the expression {{nihongo|''sōgya ranma''|僧伽藍摩}}, itself a transliteration of the Sanskrit ''saMghaaraama'' (सँघाराम), literally meaning "garden for monks".&lt;ref name="garan"&gt;JAANUS, ''garan''&lt;/ref&gt; A Japanese ''garan'' was originally just a park where monks gathered together with their teacher, but the term later came to mean "[[Buddhist temples in Japan|Buddhist temple]]". 

The word ''garan'' can be found in a record in [[Nihon Shoki]] dated 552, although no monastery of this time survives, so we don't know what they were like.&lt;ref name="garan"/&gt; 

The compound word {{nihongo|''shichidō garan''|七堂伽藍|seven hall temple}} is found in a much more recent literature of [[Edo period]],&lt;ref name="kosetsu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Nihon Kokugo Daijiten]]&lt;/ref&gt; referring to a complex that had a complete set of buildings forming an ideal Buddhist temple.

== Early ''garan'' layout ==
A record dated 577 in the [[Nihon Shoki]] states that a mission including among others a temple architect and a Buddhist image maker was sent by {{nihongo|[[Seong of Baekje|King Seong of Baekje]]|聖王}} to Japan, with more Buddhist related artisans sent over in the following years.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7007-1605-X"&gt;{{cite book |author=Grayson, James Huntley |title=Korea: a religious history |publisher=RoutledgeCurzon |location=London |year=2002 |pages=33 |isbn=0-7007-1605-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excavations carried out between 1979-1980 on the temple site of [[Jeongnimsa]] in [[Buyeo County|Buyeo]], capital of [[Baekje]] from 538 to 663, revealed that the original temple was laid out in a typical north-to-south style with key buildings put on the center axis,&lt;ref name="urlNational Research Institute of Cultural Heritage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nricp.go.kr/eng/ArchitecturalHeritage/Documentation.jsp|title=National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage|format=|work=|accessdate=2010-06-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727120021/http://www.nricp.go.kr/eng/ArchitecturalHeritage/Documentation.jsp|archivedate=2011-07-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was an arrangement closely adhered to at [[Shitennō-ji]] in [[Ōsaka]].&lt;ref name="garan"/&gt;

==Composition of a ''shichidō garan''==
What is counted in the group of seven buildings, or ''shichidō'', can vary greatly from temple to temple, from sect to sect, and from time to time. As mentioned above, ''shichidō garan'' could mean a complete temple or even simply a large temple complex.

According to a 13th-century text,&lt;ref&gt;[[Shōtoku Taishi]] Denkokonmokurokushō (聖徳太子伝古今目録抄)&lt;/ref&gt; "a garan is a temple with a ''kon-dō'' (main hall), a ''[[tō]]'' (pagoda), a ''kō-dō'' (lecture hall), a ''[[shōrō]]'' (bellfry), a ''jiki-dō'' (refectory), a ''sōbō'' (monks' living quarters), and a ''[[kyōzō]]'' (scriptures deposit, library)."&lt;ref name="kosetsu"/&gt; These are the seven listed as ''shichidō'' elements of a {{nihongo|[[Buddhism_in_Japan#Asuka_and_Nara_Periods|Nanto Rokushū]]|南都六宗|Nara six sects}}&lt;ref&gt;The six Buddhist schools {{nihongo2|南都六宗}}, introduced to Japan during the [[Asuka Period|Asuka]] and [[Nara period]]s&lt;/ref&gt; temple.&lt;ref name="kojien"&gt;Iwanami [[Kōjien]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 15th-century text&lt;ref&gt;{{nihongo|Sekiso Ōrai|尺素往来}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes how [[Zen]] school temples ([[Sōtō]] ({{lang|ja|曹洞}}), [[Rinzai]] ({{lang|ja|臨済}}))&lt;ref&gt;The [[Ōbaku|Ōbaku School]] ({{lang|ja|黃檗}}) arrived in Japan in the 17th century.&lt;/ref&gt; included a ''[[butsuden]]'' or ''butsu-dō'' (main hall), a ''hattō'' (lecture hall), a ''kuin'' (kitchen/office), a ''sō-dō'' (building dedicated to [[Zazen]]), a ''[[sanmon]]'' (main gate), a ''tōsu'' (toilet) and a ''yokushitsu'' (bath).

===Loss of importance of the pagoda within the ''garan''===
[[File:飛鳥寺復元図.jpg|thumb|left|A reconstruction of [[Asuka-dera]]'s original layout with a pagoda at its center]]

Because of the relics they contained, wooden pagodas used to be the centerpiece of the ''garan'', the seven edifices considered indispensable for a temple.&lt;ref name="tamura"&gt;*{{cite book   |last=Tamura   |first=Yoshiro   |title=Japanese Buddhism - A Cultural History   |publisher=Kosei Publishing Company   |location=Tokyo   |year=2000   |edition=First   |pages=40–41 pages   |isbn=4-333-01684-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They gradually lost of importance and were replaced by the ''[[Main Hall (Japanese Buddhism)|kondō]]'' (golden hall), because of the magic powers believed to lie within the images the building housed. This loss of status was so complete that the Zen sects, which arrived late in Japan from China, normally do not build any pagoda at all. The layout of four early temples clearly illustrates this trend: they are in chronological order [[Asuka-dera]], [[Shitennō-ji]], [[Hōryū-ji]], and [[Yakushi-ji]].&lt;ref name="tamura"/&gt; In the first, the pagoda was at the very center of the ''garan'' surrounded by three small ''kondō'' (see the reconstruction of the temple's original layout). In the second, a single ''kondō'' is at the center of the temple and the pagoda lies in front of it. At Hōryū-ji, they are one next to the other. Yakushi-ji has a single, large ''kondō'' at the center with two pagodas on the sides. The same evolution can be observed in Buddhist temples in China.

==Examples of ''garan''==

===Hōryū-ji===
[[File:Plan of Horyuji Temple.jpg|thumb|250 px|Plan of Hōryū-ji's ''shichidō garan'']]

The stories of the rogue sorcerer '''[[Simon Magus]]''' and his consort Helen, which showcased the early battles between [[religion]] and [[Magic (fantasy)|magic]], have often captured the imagination of artists and writers.

==Folklore==
*In [[Irish mythology]], [[Mug Ruith]] is said to have been a student of [[Simon Magus]], who taught him his magic skills and helped him build the flying machine ''roth rámach''. Mug Ruith's daughter [[Tlachtga]] was raped by the three sons of Simon Magus and returned to [[Ireland]] where she gave birth to triplets on the hill that would bear her name.

==Theatre and poetry==
*In Canto XIX of the ''[[Divine Comedy]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' by [[Dante Alighieri]], Simon is in the third ''bolgia'' of the eighth circle of Hell.
* Simon and Helen appear in ''Christus: A Mystery'' and ''Helen of Tyre'' by [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]].

===Faust===
*Many aspects of the life of Simon Magus are echoed in the later [[Faust legend]] of [[Christopher Marlowe]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]. [[Hans Jonas]] writes, "surely few admirers of Marlowe's and Goethe's plays have an inkling that their hero is the descendant of a gnostic sectary, and that the beautiful Helen called up by his art was once the fallen Thought of God through whose raising mankind was to be saved."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jonas | first = Hans | title = The Gnostic Religion | year = 1958 | page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** The presence of [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] of Troy.&lt;ref&gt;Here and below: {{cite encyclopedia |last=Headlam|first=A.C.|author=|authorlink=|editor=[[James Hastings]] |encyclopedia=[[Hastings' Dictionary of the Bible|A Dictionary of the Bible]] |title= Simon Magus and the Faust Legend |year= 1898 |publisher= |volume=IV |location= |id= |isbn= |doi= |page=527 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**The name "Faustus" ("the favored one"), both as a possible appellation of Simon in [[Rome]], and with a person by that name appearing in the [[Clementine literature]]. Later, [[Augustine of Hippo]] became a fierce opponent of a certain [[Faustus the Manichean]].
**The ''[[homunculus]]''.
**Faust is employed by the Emperor, just as Simon is employed by [[Nero]].
**The ascent of Gretchen and Faust past the demons of [[Mephistopheles]] in [[Faust: The First Part of the Tragedy|Faust Part One]] and [[Faust Part Two]], respectively, can be seen as mirroring the descent of the ''Ennoia'' and Simon past the world-creating [[angel]]s. Additionally, the passage wherein Mephistopheles is distracted by the allures of seductive angels has its parallel in the ''Ennoia'' arousing desires in the world-creating angels who prevent her initial ascent.&lt;ref&gt;See also: {{cite book | last = Palmer | first = Philip Mason |author2=Robert Pattison More  | title = The Sources of the Faust Tradition: From Simon Magus to Lessing | year = 1936}}; {{cite book | last = Fradon | first = Ramona | title = The Gnostic Faustus: The Secret Teachings behind the Classic Text | year = 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sosu Seowon''''' is the oldest ''[[seowon]]'', private [[Neo-Confucian]] academy in [[Korea]] which was established during the [[Joseon Dynasty]] period. It was found at the entrance of [[Suksusa]] Temple, in Sunheung-myeon, [[Yeongju City]], [[Gyeongsangbuk-do]] [[South Korea]]. Sosu Seowon was founded by Ju Sebung (주세붕/{{lang|ko|周世鵬}} 1495–1554), who was serving as magistrate of Pungseong county.

Sosu Seowon was the only seowon that survived from the ''Seowon Abolishment'' by [[Heungseon Daewongun#Regent|Heungseon Daewongun Regent]] in 1871. It has been well preserved retaining most of its old structures and is designated as [[National Treasure of South Korea]] No.55

==History==
In 1542, during the 37th year of [[King Jungjong]]'s reign (1506–44) of the [[Joseon Dynasty]], the magistrate of Punggi County and Confucian scholar, Ju Se-bung, built Baekundong Seowon, renamed to Sosu Seowon in 1550, to honor the peaceful times of Goryeo. Also in 1550, during the reign of [[Myeongjong of Joseon|King Myeongjong]] of the Joseon Dynasty, Toegye Yi Hwang established Sosu Seowon as the first legislated private institute of Korea.

Many criticized Ju Se-bung's actions of founding Baekundong (Sosu) Seowon during a time of famine. But be defended himself by quoting [[Zhu Xi]] (1130–1200), the scholar who systematized Neo-Confucianism in [[Song dynasty]]. Like Zhu Xi, Ju Se-bung believed that education was the cardinal virtue of man, and ought to be promoted above all else.

Ju Se-bung was a man ahead of his time. Private academies blossomed across Korea in short order, but because Sosu Seowon was the first, it became one of the richest. After Ju Se-bung departed as magistrate, local scholars continued fund raising campaigns, receiving vast donations of grain, land, and slaves to support the academy. Sosu Seowon grew in prestige because it enshrined [[An Hyang]] (1243 -1306), a local a Confucian scholar who lived during the end of the [[Goryeo Dynasty]] who had brought Neo-Confucianism to Korea from China in the 13th century.

The academy gained even more prestige when [[Toegye]] ([[Yi Hwang]]) (1501–70), the preeminent Neo-Confucian philosopher of Korea, became magistrate of the county. He asked King Myeongjong to grant the academy a royal charter. The king responded favorably, sending a plaque with the name "Sosu Seowon" in the king's own handwriting, along with a generous supply of books. The annals of the king give interesting clues to the relation of the academy to the state. It specifies that the local magistrate cannot interfere in the affairs of the academy, nor disturb the Confucian scholars. The academy was to be promoted as a place where scholars could gather without interference from the monarchy.

About 4,000 scholars, including the pupils of Confucian scholar Toegye Yi Hwang, studied at the institute.

During the Joseon era (1392–1910), [[Korean Buddhism]] suffered heavy persecution. Many temples were closed and renovated for other uses. Because Sosu Seowon originally had been a [[Korean Buddhist temple|Buddhist temple]] and then became a private academy, Sosu Seowon has an unconventional architectural layout compared with later Confucian academies.

==Today==

Sosu Seowon also has Munseonggong Shrine, which was built to enshrine An Hyang, An Bo, An Chuk and Ju Se-bung, where a memorial service takes place on the first day of the third and ninth months of the lunar calendar every year.

The basic principle of Chinese architectural locates the study facilities at the front of the structure and the shrine to the rear, as seen in most Korean Confucian academies. But Sosu Seowon is based on the arrangement of having the study facilities placed in the east and the shrine placed in the west, positioning the greater emphasis on the east.

On the right of the Sosu Seowon entrance is the Okgyesu, a stream of the Nakdong River coming from Mt. Sobaek. Inside Sosu Seowon's auditorium is a 'Sosu Seowon' sign engraved by King Myeongjong. Behind the auditorium there are Jikbangjae, Ilshinjae, Hakgujae and Jirakjae. On the east side are the Seogo, the portrait of Anhyang (National Treasure No.111) painted at the end of Goryeo Dynasty, and the Munseong Tomb where the Daesungjisung King Munseon’s Jeonjwado (National Treasure No.485) is enshrined.

Today, an average of 800,000 tourists visit Sosu Seowon every year. Inside the institute is the Sosu Museum which exhibits a wide range of traditional Confucian cultural assets.

'''Spinozism''' (also spelled '''Spinozaism''') is the [[monism|monist]] [[philosophy|philosophical]] system of [[Benedict de Spinoza]] that defines "[[God]]" as a singular self-subsistent Substance, with both matter and thought being attributes of such.

In a letter to [[Henry Oldenburg]], Spinoza wrote: "as to the view of certain people that I identify god with nature (taken as a kind of mass or corporeal matter), they are quite mistaken".&lt;ref&gt;Correspondence of Benedict de Spinoza, Wilder Publications (March 26, 2009), {{ISBN|1-60459-156-0}}, letter 73&lt;/ref&gt; For Spinoza, our universe (cosmos) is a ''mode'' under two ''attributes'' of [[Thought]] and [[Extension (metaphysics)|Extension]]. God has infinitely many other attributes which are not present in our world. According to German philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]], when Spinoza wrote "''Deus sive Natura''" ("God or Nature") Spinoza meant God was ''[[Natura naturans]]'' not ''[[Natura naturata]]'', that is, "a dynamic nature in action, growing and changing, not a passive or static thing."

==Core doctrine==
In Spinozism, the concept of a personal relationship with God comes from the position that one is a part of an infinite interdependent "organism." Spinoza argued that everything is a derivative of God, interconnected with all of existence. Although humans experience only thought and extension, what happens to one aspect of existence will affect others. Thus, Spinozism teaches a form of [[determinism]] and [[ecology]], and uses these as a basis for morality.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Additionally, a core doctrine of Spinozism is that the universe is essentially [[deterministic]]. All that happens or will happen could not have unfolded in any other way. Spinoza claimed that the third kind of knowledge, [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], is the highest kind. More specifically, he defined intuition as the ability of the human intellect to intuit knowledge based upon its accumulated understanding of the world.

Spinoza's [[metaphysics]] consists of one thing, Substance, and its modifications (modes). Early in ''The Ethics'' Spinoza argues that there is only one Substance, which is absolutely [[Infinity|infinite]], self-caused, and eternal. Substance causes an infinite number of attributes (the intellect perceiving an abstract concept or essence) and modes (things following from attributes and modes). He calls this Substance "[[God]]", or "[[Nature]]". In fact, he takes these two terms to be [[synonymous]] (in the [[Latin]] the phrase he uses is ''"Deus sive Natura"''), but readers often disregard his neutral monism. During his time, this statement was seen as literally equating the existing world with God&amp;nbsp;- for which he was accused of atheism. Spinoza asserted that the whole of the [[natural]] [[universe]] is made of one Substance &amp;ndash; God or Nature &amp;ndash; and its modifications (modes).
{{quote|It cannot be overemphasized how the rest of Spinoza's philosophy, his philosophy of mind, epistemology, psychology, moral philosophy, political philosophy, and philosophy of religion&amp;nbsp;– flows more or less directly from the metaphysical underpinnings in Part I of the ''Ethics''.&lt;ref&gt;Della Rocca, Michael. (2008). ''Spinoza''. Routledge., pg. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
One should, however, remember the neutral monist position. While the natural universe humans experience in the realm of mind and physical reality is part of God, it is only two modes&amp;nbsp;– thought and extension&amp;nbsp;– that are part of infinite modes emanating from God.

Spinoza's doctrine was considered radical at the time he published, and he was widely seen as the most infamous atheist-heretic of Europe. His philosophy was part of the philosophic debate in Europe during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], along with [[Cartesianism]]. Specifically, Spinoza disagreed with Descartes on substance duality, Descartes' views on the will and the intellect, and the subject of free will.&lt;ref&gt;Michael L. Morgan, ed., ''Spinoza: Complete Works'', translated by Samuel Shirley (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing, 2002), 119n6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Substance===
Spinoza defines "Substance" as follows:
{{quote|By substance I understand what is in itself and is conceived through itself, ''i.e.'', that whose concept does not require the concept of another thing, from which it must be formed. (E1D3)&lt;ref name="curley85" &gt;Curley, Edwin M. (1985). The Collected Works of Spinoza. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This means, essentially, that Substance is just whatever can be thought of without relating it to any other idea or thing. For example, if one thinks of a [[particular]] [[Object (philosophy)|object]], one thinks of it as a kind of thing, ''e.g.'', ''x'' is a cat. Substance, on the other hand, is to be conceived of by itself, without understanding it as a particular kind of thing, because it isn't a particular thing.

===Attributes===
Spinoza defines "attribute" as follows:
{{quote|By attribute I understand what the intellect perceives of a substance, as constituting its essence. (E1D4)&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;}}
From this it can be seen that Attributes are related to Substance. It is not clear, however, even from Spinoza's direct definition, whether, a) Attributes are really the way(s) Substance is, or b) Attributes are simply ways to understand Substance, but not necessarily the ways it really is.
Spinoza thinks that there are an ''infinite'' number of Attributes, but there are two Attributes for which Spinoza thinks we can have knowledge. Namely, ''thought'' and ''extension''.&lt;ref name=sep4&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza-attributes/ Stanford.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Thought ====
The attribute of thought is how Substance can be understood to be composed of thoughts, ''i.e.'', thinking things. When we understand a particular thing through the Attribute of thought, we are understanding the mode as an ''idea'' of something (either another idea, or an object).

==== Extension ====
The Attribute of extension is how Substance can be understood to be physically extended in space. Particular things that occupy space are what is meant by ''extended''. It [[Logical consequence|follows from]] this that if Substance and God are identical, in Spinoza's view, and contrary to the traditional conception, [[God]] has extension as one of his Attributes.

===Modes===
Modes are particular modifications of substance, ''i.e.'', particular things in the world. Spinoza gives the following definition:
{{quote|By mode I understand the affections of a substance, ''or'' that which is in another through which it is also conceived. (E1D5)&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;}}

===Substance monism===
The argument for there only being one Substance (or, more colloquially, one kind of stuff) in the universe occurs in the first fourteen propositions of ''The Ethics.'' The following proposition expresses Spinoza's commitment to substance monism:
{{quote|Except God, no substance can be or be conceived. (E1P14)&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;}}
Spinoza takes this proposition to follow directly from everything he says prior to it. Spinoza's [[monism]] is contrasted with Descartes' [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] and Leibniz's [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]]. Thus, Spinoza avoids the unsolvable problem of how mind and body interact, which troubled Descartes in his ''Meditations on First Philosophy.'' Specifically, how can immaterial mind interface with material body, and vice-versa? They exist in wholly different categories.

===Causality and Modality===
The issue of [[causality]] and [[Modal logic|modality]] ([[Logical possibility|possibility]] and [[Metaphysical necessity|necessity]]) in Spinoza's philosophy is contentious.&lt;ref name=sep5&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza-modal/ Stanford.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; Spinoza's philosophy is, in one sense, thoroughly [[determinism|deterministic]] (or necessitarian). This can be seen directly from Axiom 3 of ''The Ethics'':
{{quote|From a given determinate cause the effect follows necessarily; and conversely, if there is no determinate cause, it is impossible for an effect to follow. (E1A3)&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;}}
Yet Spinoza seems to make room for a kind of freedom, especially in the fifth and final section of ''The Ethics'', ''"On the Power of the Intellect, or on Human Freedom"'':
{{quote|I pass now to the remaining Part of the Ethics, which concerns the means or way to Freedom. Here, then, I shall treat of the power of reason, showing what it can do against the affects, and what Freedom of Mind, or blessedness, is. (E5, Preface)&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;}}
So Spinoza certainly has a use for the word 'freedom', but he equates "Freedom of Mind" with "blessedness", a notion which is not traditionally associated with [[Free will|freedom of the will]] at all.

====The principle of sufficient reason (PSR)====
Though the [[Principle of sufficient reason|PSR]] is most commonly associated with [[Gottfried Leibniz]], it is arguably found in its strongest form in Spinoza's philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Della Rocca, Michael. (2008). ''Spinoza'', Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;
Within the context of Spinoza's philosophical system, the PSR can be understood to unify causation and explanation.&lt;ref name="Della Rocca, Spinoza, 2008"&gt;Della Rocca, ''Spinoza'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; What this means is that for Spinoza, questions regarding the ''reason'' why a given phenomenon is the way it is (or exists) are always answerable, and are always answerable in terms of the relevant cause(s). This constitutes a rejection of [[teleology|teleological]], or [[final cause|final causation]], except possibly in a more restricted sense for human beings.&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Della Rocca, Spinoza, 2008"/&gt; Given this, Spinoza's views regarding causality and modality begin to make much more sense.

===Parallelism&lt;!--linked from 'Psychophysical parallelism'--&gt;===
Spinoza's philosophy contains as a key proposition the notion that mental and physical (thought and extension) phenomena occur in parallel, but without causal interaction between them. He expresses this proposition as follows:
{{quote|The order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of things. (E2P7)&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;}}
His proof of this proposition is that:
{{quote|The knowledge of an effect depends on, and involves, the knowledge of its cause. (E1A4)&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;}}
The reason Spinoza thinks [[Psychophysical parallelism|parallelism]] follows from this axiom is that, since the idea we have of each thing requires knowledge of its cause, such a cause must be understood under the same attribute. Further, there is only one substance, so whenever we understand some chain of ideas concerning things, we understand that the way the ideas are causally related must be the same as the way the things themselves are related, since the ideas and the things are the same modes, but understood under different attributes.

==Pantheism controversy==
{{main|Pantheism controversy}}

In 1785, [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]] published a condemnation of Spinoza's [[pantheism]], after [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] was thought to have confessed on his deathbed to being a "Spinozist", which was the equivalent in his time of being called a [[heretic]]. Jacobi claimed that Spinoza's doctrine was pure materialism, because all Nature and God are said to be nothing but extended [[Substance theory|substance]]. This, for Jacobi, was the result of Enlightenment rationalism and it would finally end in absolute [[atheism]]. [[Moses Mendelssohn]] disagreed with Jacobi, saying that there is no actual difference between [[theism]] and pantheism. The entire issue became a major intellectual and religious concern for European civilization at the time, which [[Immanuel Kant]] rejected, as he thought that attempts to conceive of transcendent reality would lead to [[Antinomy|antinomies]] (statements that could be proven both right and wrong) in thought.

The attraction of Spinoza's philosophy to late eighteenth-century Europeans was that it provided an alternative to [[materialism]], atheism, and [[deism]]. Three of Spinoza's ideas strongly appealed to them:
* the unity of all that exists;
* the regularity of all that happens; and
* the identity of spirit and nature.

Spinoza's "God or Nature" [''Deus sive Natura''] provided a living, natural God, in contrast to the [[Newtonian mechanics|Newtonian mechanical]] "[[First Cause]]" or the dead mechanism of the [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie|French "Man Machine]]." Coleridge and Shelley saw in Spinoza's philosophy a ''religion of nature''&lt;ref name=tws908&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spinoza inspired the poet Shelley to write his essay "The Necessity of Atheism."&lt;ref name=tws9912/&gt;

Spinoza was considered to be an atheist because he used the word "God" [Deus] to signify a concept that was different from that of traditional Judeo–Christian monotheism. "Spinoza expressly denies personality and consciousness to God; he has neither intelligence, feeling, nor will; he does not act according to purpose, but everything follows necessarily from his nature, according to law...."&lt;ref&gt;Frank Thilly, ''A History of Philosophy'', § 47, Holt &amp; Co., New York, 1914&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Spinoza's cool, indifferent God differs from the concept of an anthropomorphic, fatherly God who cares about humanity.&lt;ref&gt;"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings.” These words were spoken by Albert Einstein, upon being asked if he believed in God by Rabbi Herbert Goldstein of the Institutional Synagogue, New York, April 24, 1921, published in the New York Times, April 25, 1929; from ''Einstein: The Life and Times'' Ronald W. Clark, New York: World Publishing Co., 1971, p. 413; also cited as a telegram to a Jewish newspaper, 1929, Einstein Archive 33–272, from Alice Calaprice, ed., ''The Expanded Quotable Einstein'', Princeton, NJ: Princeton University&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern interpretations==
German philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]] believed that Spinoza, in his philosophical system, did not mean to say that God and Nature are interchangeable terms, but rather that God's transcendence was attested by his infinitely many attributes, and that two attributes known by humans, namely Thought and Extension, signified God's ''immanence''.&lt;ref name="ts64"&gt;Karl Jaspers, Spinoza (Great Philosophers), Harvest Books (October 23, 1974), {{ISBN|0-15-684730-2}}, Pages: 14 and 95&lt;/ref&gt; Even God under the attributes of thought and extension cannot be identified strictly with our world. That world is of course "divisible"; it has parts. But Spinoza insists that "no attribute of a substance can be truly conceived from which it follows that the substance can be divided" (Which means that one cannot conceive an attribute in a way that leads to division of substance), and that "a substance which is absolutely infinite is indivisible" (''Ethics'', Part I, Propositions 12 and 13).&lt;ref name="ts65"&gt;Genevieve Lloyd, Routledge Philosophy GuideBook to Spinoza and The Ethics (Routledge Philosophy Guidebooks), Routledge; 1 edition (October 2, 1996), {{ISBN|0-415-10782-2}}, Page: 40&lt;/ref&gt; Following this logic, our world should be considered as a mode under two attributes of thought and extension. Therefore, the pantheist formula "One and All" would apply to Spinoza only if the "One" preserves its transcendence and the "All" were not interpreted as the totality of finite things.&lt;ref name=ts64/&gt;

French philosopher [[Martial Guéroult]] suggested the term "[[panentheism]]", rather than "pantheism" to describe Spinoza's view of the relation between God and the world. The world is not God, but it is, in a strong sense, "in" God. Not only do finite things have God as their cause; they cannot be conceived without God.&lt;ref name=ts65/&gt; In other words, the world is a [[subset]] of God. American philosopher [[Charles Hartshorne]], on the other hand, suggested the term "[[Classical Pantheism]]" to describe Spinoza's philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Hartshorne and William Reese, "Philosophers Speak of God," Humanity Books, 1953, ch 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to Eastern philosophies==
Similarities between Spinoza's philosophy and Eastern philosophical traditions have been discussed by many authorities. The 19th-century German Sanskritist [[Theodore Goldstücker]] was one of the early figures to notice the similarities between Spinoza's religious conceptions and the [[Vedanta]] tradition of India, writing that Spinoza's thought was "...&amp;nbsp;a western system of philosophy which occupies a foremost rank amongst the philosophies of all nations and ages, and which is so exact a representation of the ideas of the Vedanta, that we might have suspected its founder to have borrowed the fundamental principles of his system from the Hindus, did his biography not satisfy us that he was wholly unacquainted with their doctrines... We mean the philosophy of Spinoza, a man whose very life is a picture of that moral purity and intellectual indifference to the transitory charms of this world, which is the constant longing of the true Vedanta philosopher... comparing the fundamental ideas of both we should have no difficulty in proving that, had Spinoza been a Hindu, his system would in all probability mark a last phase of the Vedanta philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;Literary Remains of the Late Professor Theodore Goldstucker, W. H. Allen, 1879. p32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Westminster Review, Volumes 78–79, Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy, 1862. p1862&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been said that Spinozism is similar to the [[Hindu]] doctrines of [[Samkhya]] and [[Yoga]]. Though within the various existing Indian traditions there exist many traditions which astonishingly had such similar doctrines from ages, out of which most similar and well known are the [[Kashmiri Shaivism]] and [[Nath]] tradition, apart from already existing Samkhya and Yoga.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eKF4AvtQnXEC&amp;pg=PA133 Disguised and overt Spinozism around 1700&amp;nbsp;– Page 133]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Muller]], in his lectures, noted the striking similarities between Vedanta and the system of Spinoza, saying "the Brahman, as conceived in the Upanishads and defined by Sankara, is clearly the same as Spinoza's 'Substantia'."&lt;ref&gt;Three Lectures on the Vedanta Philosophy. F. Max Muller. Kessinger Publishing, 2003. p123&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helena Blavatsky]], a founder of the [[Theosophical Society]] also compared Spinoza's religious thought to Vedanta, writing in an unfinished essay "As to Spinoza's Deity&amp;nbsp;– natura naturans&amp;nbsp;– conceived in his attributes simply and alone; and the same Deity&amp;nbsp;– as natura naturata or as conceived in the endless series of modifications or correlations, the direct outflowing results from the properties of these attributes, it is the Vedantic Deity pure and simple."&lt;ref&gt;''H.P Blavatsky's Collected Writings'', Volume 13, pages 308–310.

'''Stephen Dean Mumford''' (born 31 July 1965) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[philosopher]], who is currently [[Professor]] of [[Metaphysics]] in the Department of Philosophy &lt;ref&gt;The University of Nottingham: Department of Philosophy - http://nottingham.ac.uk/philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Durham University]]. Mumford is best known for his work in metaphysics on [[disposition (philosophy)|dispositions]] and [[law]]s, but has also made contributions in the philosophy of [[sport]].

==Biography==
Mumford was born in [[Wakefield]], [[West Yorkshire]]. Mumford went on to read Philosophy and History of Ideas with Politics at [[Huddersfield Polytechnic]] (now University of Huddersfield) as his first degree. After Huddersfield, Mumford went on to the [[University of Leeds]] to take an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in Philosophy of Mind. At Leeds, Mumford met [[Robin Le Poidevin]] who was to become his PhD supervisor. Mumford was awarded a PhD in 1994, for his thesis ''Dispositions and Reductionism'', and was awarded a two-year lectureship at Leeds. Mumford left Leeds in 1995 for The University of Nottingham, where he has been [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of the [[University of Nottingham#Faculties and Schools|Faculty of Arts]] from 2011 to 2015.

Prior to his appointment as Dean of the Faculty of Arts in 2011, Mumford was Head of the Department of Philosophy from 2004–2007 and Head of the School of Humanities from 2009-2011.

Mumford is the sole-author of four books: ''Dispositions'' (1998), ''Laws in Nature'' (2004), ''David Armstrong'' (2007), and ''Watching Sport: Aesthetics, Ethics and Emotions'' (2011). Mumford has also edited two books: ''Russell on Metaphysics'' (2003) and George Molnar’s ''Powers: A Study in Metaphysics'' (2003). Most recently, Mumford co-authored, with Rani Lill Anjum, ''Getting Causes from Powers'' (2011).

=="''Powers: A Study in Metaphysics''" (ed. 2003)==

===Background===
:''See main article: [[George Molnar (philosopher)]]
The late philosopher [[George Molnar (philosopher)|George Molnar]] (1934–1999) published only four [[article (publishing)|philosophical papers]] on [[metaphysics]] in his career, but his importance in the field should not be underestimated.  After a return to the field, following a self-imposed absence, he was working on a book ("''[[Powers: A Study in Metaphysics|Powers]]''") and continued up until his sudden and untimely death in August 1999.&lt;ref&gt;"Powers" (ed. 2003) - http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199204175.do&lt;/ref&gt;  The book remained unfinished until Mumford, who had previously been in contact with Molnar, in the summer of 1999, with the intention of giving feedback on the work (nearing completion), was approached to edit the remaining [[manuscript]] into a completed book.&lt;ref&gt;Molnar, G. "Powers: A Study in Metaphysics" (2003): 16&lt;/ref&gt;  Mumford, along with several other figures in the field of metaphysics, including [[David Malet Armstrong|David Armstrong]], were involved collaboratively in providing insight on Molnar's work, and as a person, but the editing was left to Mumford, as was the writing of an introductory chapter to correctly present and establish the material laid out - something which Molnar did not get round to doing before his death.  Armstrong states, "We can be very grateful to Stephen Mumford for making a volume from the much that we have.  His excellent introduction serves in place of the introductory chapter that was left unwritten".&lt;ref&gt;Molnar, G. "Powers: A Study in Metaphysics" (2003): vii&lt;/ref&gt;  Mumford had discussed Molnar at a conference on Australian metaphysics, held in [[Grenoble]] (9–13 December 1999), but the [[:wikt:colloquium|colloquium]] - organised by [[Jean-Maurice Monnoyer]], entitled "The Structure of the World: Objects, Properties and States of Affairs"&lt;ref&gt;Anstey, P. Book Review: "La structure du monde: objets, propriétés, états de choses" (2006); ''[[dialectica]]''., vol. 60, no. 1: 93-96&lt;/ref&gt; - was to be the first official meeting of Mumford and Molnar as well.  Mumford had considered this to be the end of the matter, but, in the spring of 2000, Mumford was contacted again concerning "''[[Powers: A Study in Metaphysics|Powers]]''".  This time, however, it was through mutual friend [[Tony Skillen]] (lecturer in philosophy at the [[University of Kent]]) on behalf of Molnar's former partner Carlotta McIntosh, who had given access to the [[manuscript]] and who shared it with Mumford.  Although the book was, in places, complete and filled with promise, there was much work to be done on the later chapters - Mumford reflects on a conversation between himself and Armstrong on the way to the [[Grenoble]] colloquium, mentioning Molnar's email stating the work was near finished, Armstrong replied: "it was near finished, in his mind".  The main theory of powers survives, and with Mumford's help and editorial contribution is readily accessible.&lt;ref&gt;Molnar, G. "Powers: A Study in Metaphysics" (2003): 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metaphysics of Science==
Mumford was a project leader for The University of Nottingham in the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council|AHRC]] (Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council) funded three-year research project: the metaphysics of science.  Mumford worked alongside [[Alexander Bird]] ([[University of Bristol|Bristol]])&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Bird - http://eis.bris.ac.uk/~plajb/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Bird (Research) - http://eis.bris.ac.uk/~plajb/research/research.html&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Helen Beebee]] ([[University of Birmingham|Birmingham]])&lt;ref&gt;Helen Beebee - http://www.philosophy.bham.ac.uk/staff/beebee.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; within this project with their joint focus on "[[causality|causes]], [[Physical law|laws]], [[Natural kind|kinds]], and dispositions".  The project was described with the following abstract:

{{quote|We naturally think that what happens in the universe is governed by [[Physical law|laws of nature]]. We also think that events are causally related to other events, that things are naturally classified into kinds (physical, chemical and biological kinds, for example), and that at least some natural kinds have distinctive dispositions (for example, the disposition of [[Sodium chloride|NaCl]] to dissolve in water). This project explored how, or whether, all these distinct notions - law, cause, natural kind, disposition - can be made to fit together into a coherent and unified worldview. For example, must two causally related events be such that they are members of kinds that are lawfully related? Must those kinds be natural kinds? Are natural kinds distinguished from one another by the fact that members of different kinds are disposed to behave in different ways?&lt;ref&gt;Metaphysics of Science: Homepage - http://www.bris.ac.uk/metaphysicsofscience/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Research - Department of Philosophy: University of Nottingham - http://nottingham.ac.uk/philosophy/research/projects/intro.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:The unger march.jpg|thumb|''The Hunger March'' in [[China]], 2005]]

'''''The Hunger March''''' is the name of a [[happening]] and a series of [[sculpture]]s made by [[Jens Galschiøt]] in 2001.

== Concept ==

The event was inspired by the 1990 movie ''[[The March (1990 film)|The March]]'', in which a horde of starving people marches towards Europe.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

''The Hunger March'' is a reminder that, if the world's need and distress is not relieved, the desperate victims will some day be knocking on the doors of the affluent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aidoh.dk/new-struct/Happenings-and-Projects/Happenings/Hungermarch/Hungermarch.com/default.html Official website&lt;/ref&gt; To remind people of the issues the world is facing, Galschiøt created 27 sculptures of starving African kids out of bronze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kunstdk.dk/kunstner/jens_galschiot/tekster/cv |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302035857/http://www.kunstdk.dk/kunstner/jens_galschiot/tekster/cv |archivedate=2014-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "kids" have a sad look on their faces. The bronze is darkened to give them a sad, dark look. At the bottom of the sculpture, there is a shining new shoe, made by one of the major shoe companies that is responsible for the use of poor kids in the third world to work for a small payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.labourbehindthelabel.org/campaigns/item/990-in-pictures-made-in-cambodia |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119162541/http://www.labourbehindthelabel.org/campaigns/item/990-in-pictures-made-in-cambodia |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==The first happening==

In May 2001, in the center of [[Odense]], a bronze sculpture of a 12-year-old starved black boy, with a large pair of shining new [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] shoes, was set up so that it appeared to watch the well-fed Danes rushing by. The sculpture stood on a polished black granite pedestal, with the slogan "[[Just Do It|JUST DO IT]]" written on it.

Galschiøt stated "With this sculpture, I'll pinpoint the hypocrisy of companies who in their lifestyle commercials are linking their brands with concepts such as freedom and equality and at the same time are cynically exploiting and 
oppressing the workers who make the products."{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==''The Hunger March'' at the ASEM 4==

During the [[Asia–Europe Meeting|ASEM]] 4 summit in [[Copenhagen]] in September 2002,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aseminfoboard.org/Summits/ASEM4&lt;/ref&gt; 27 "starving boys" were placed in Copenhagen to demonstrate for social justice. The 27 sculptures were supposed to represent the starving people in the [[Third World]] countries that are influenced by the way that the summit  focuses on corporations' profit, instead of poor peoples' interests. The event was arranged in co-operation with Care-Denmark and [[The Salvation Army]]. The latter organization supplied the boys with [[Adidas]], Nike and [[Reebok]] shoes.&lt;ref&gt;http://sculptures.aidoh.dk/index.html?lang=uk&amp;&amp;view=list&amp;order=2&amp;rpp=15&amp;start=0&amp;ID=251&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other happenings with ''The Hunger March''==

In the summer of 2002, a crowd of 27 starving African boys cast in copper started a tour throughout [[Denmark]] to protest against the government's cutback of development aid. 

Galschiøt launched the action in cooperation with the NGO Forum in [[Aarhus]]. Hundreds of volunteers took part in the creation of the sculptures in the artist's workshop, and subsequently in the mobilization of the boys all over the country. 

In March 2003, [[DanChurchAid]] is using the sculptures in their collection to support children who have been left orphans due to [[AIDS]].

==''The Hunger March'' today==
''The Hunger March'' has often appeared as a participant in different demonstrations in Denmark, such as the climate demonstrations. Usually the sculptures are placed on small wagons, where they appear as being a part of the marching crowd.

'''The purpose of a system is what it does''' ('''POSIWID''') is a [[systems thinking]] [[heuristic]] coined by [[Stafford Beer]].

==Origins of term==
[[Stafford Beer]] coined the term POSIWID and used it many times in public addresses. In his address to the [[University of Valladolid]], Spain, in October 2001, he said "According to the [[cybernetician]], the purpose of a system is what it does. This is a basic [[dictum]]. It stands for bald fact, which makes a better starting point in seeking understanding than the familiar attributions of good intention, prejudices about expectations, [[moral judgment]], or sheer ignorance of circumstances."&lt;ref name=Beer2002/&gt;

==Uses of the term==
The term is widely used by [[Systems theory|systems theorists]]. It is generally invoked to counter the notion that the purpose of a system can be read from the intentions of those who [[systems design|design]], operate, or promote it. From a cybernetic perspective [[complex systems]] are not controllable by simple notions of management, and interventions in a system can best be understood by looking at how they affect observed system behavior. When "[[side effect]]s" or "[[unintended consequences]]" reveal that system behavior is poorly understood, then taking the POSIWID perspective allows the more political understandings of system behavior to be balanced by a more straightforwardly [[descriptive]] view.

The term is used in many fields including biology&lt;ref name=Boogerd2007/&gt; and [[management]].&lt;ref name=Ward2003/&gt;

'''Uisang''' (625–702) was one of the most eminent early [[Silla]] Korean scholar-monks, a close friend of [[Wonhyo]] (元曉).

He traveled to [[China]], studying at [[Mount Zhongnan]] as a student of the influential [[Huayan school|Huayan]] master [[Zhiyan]] (智儼) and as a senior colleague of [[Fazang]] (法藏), with whom he established a lifelong correspondence. He became an expert in [[Huayan school|Huayan]] (華嚴) doctrine and was the founder of the Korean [[Hwaeom]] school. Most well-known among his writings is the ''[[Beopseongge]]'' or ''Hwaeom ilseung beopgye do ''(''Diagram of the Avataṃsaka Single Vehicle Dharmadhātu'') (華嚴一乘法界圖). This is a commentary on his [[mandala]]-like diagram ''haein do'' ('Ocean Seal'), which consists of 210 Chinese characters that express the essence of the [[Huayan school|Huayan]] doctrine. A full translation can be found in the appendix to Odin, 1982.

Little is known of his early life other than his father was named Hin-sin and his family name was Kim.

He is famous for his travel to Táng China with his friend, Wonhyo. At one point they were captured by border guards and held for ten days as suspected spies but were subsequently released and expelled. Late, Wonhyo left Uisang, after unknowingly drinking water from a skull in the dark. The shock of this brought about an enlightenment experience such that he felt it was unnecessary to continue to China in search of wisdom.  Dismayed, but nonetheless determined, Uisang continued on his journey eventually reaching China by sea.

A Korean folk story relates how, when he was young, Uisang fell in love with a beautiful girl, Myo Hwa ("Delicate Flower") but she was chosen by the king of Silla to be sent as a gift to the Chinese Emperor thus thwarting their relationship. This turned Uisang to the religious life and he became a monk. Myo Hwa in desperation tried to commit suicide on the journey in China by throwing herself in the river. However, she was rescued and nursed back to health by a family who subsequently adopted her. Many years later she met Uisang on his travels to China but he explained that he was now a monk and could not go back with her to Silla as she wished. However, he said he would visit her when his studies in China were complete. This he did ten years later. Unfortunately, Myo Hwa was not at home so Uisang left her a note and hurried to get his ship back to Silla. Myo Hwa returned and realized she had just missed him and ran down to the sea to try and catch him before he left. The ship however had already left the shore and in desperation she leapt in the water. As she hit the water she was magically transformed into a dragon by the strength of her love and she was able to follow the ship back to Silla. 

Safely arrived in Silla, Uisang went on to found Buseoksa, a temple in the [[Gyeongsangbuk-do]] (North Gyeongsang) mountains. The temple name means "Floating Rock" and is derived from an incident in which Myo Hwa, as a dragon, scares away some bandits by magically raising a bolder into the air. She is said to have transformed herself into a  rock to continue protecting the site and her lover, Uisang.  (Story related by Sunin, 1987).

Uisang is often referred to as the "Temple Builder" because of the number of temples he established or extended during his lifetime.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3965">'''Universal evolution''' is a theory of [[evolution]] formulated by [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] and [[Julian Huxley]] that describes the gradual development of the Universe from subatomic particles to human society, considered by Teilhard as the last stage.

==Vernadsky's and Teilhard's theories==
[[Vladimir Ivanovich Vernadsky]] influenced [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], and the two formulated very similar theories describing the gradual development of the universe from subatomic particles to human society and beyond.  Teilhard's theories are better known in the West (and have also been commented on by [[Julian Huxley]]), and integrate [[Darwinism|Darwinian evolution]] and [[Christianity]],  whilst Vernadsky wrote more purely from a scientific perspective.

Three classic levels are described.  Cosmogenesis (Teilhard) or the formation of inanimate matter (the [[Physiosphere]] of [[Ken Wilber|Wilber]]), culminating in the [[Lithosphere]], [[Earth's atmosphere|Atmosphere]], [[Hydrosphere]], etc. (Teilhard), or collectively, the Geosphere (Vernadsky).  Here progress is ruled by structure and mechanical laws, and matter is primarily of the nature of non-consciousness (Teilhard - the "Without").

This is followed by Biogenesis (Teilhard) and the origin of life or the  [[Biosphere]] (Vernadsky, Teilhard), where there is a greater degree of [[complexity]] and consciousness (Teilhard - the "Within"), [[ecology]] (Vernadsky) comes into play, and progress and development is the result of Darwinian mechanisms of evolution.

Finally there is [[human evolution]] and the rise of thought or [[cognition]] (Vernadsky, Teilhard),  and a further leap in complexity and the interior life  or consciousness (Teilhard), resulting in the birth of the [[Noosphere]] (Vernadsky, Teilhard).  Just as the biosphere transformed the geosphere, so the noosphere (human intervention) transformed the biosphere (Vernadsky).  Here the evolution of human society (socialization) is ruled by psychological, economic, informational and communicative processes.

For Teilhard there is a further stage, one of [[spiritual evolution]], the Christing of the collective noosphere, in which humanity converges in a single divinisation he calls the [[Omega Point]].

==Evolutionary stages==

Nine levels are described {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}, the "classical" biological stages being levels 6, 7 &amp; 8 of the universal evolution. Stages 1 to 5 are grouped into the [[Lithosphere]], also called [[Geosphere]] or [[Physiosphere]], where (the progress of) the structure of the organisms is ruled by structure, mechanical laws and coincidence. Stages 6 to 8 are grouped into the [[Biosphere]], where (the progress of) the structure of the organisms is ruled by genetical mechanisms. The actual stage, stage 9, is called the [[Noosphere]], where (the progress of) the structure of human society (socialization) is ruled by psychological, informational and communicative processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4045">'''Victor Goldschmidt''' (1914 – 25 September 1981) was a French philosopher and historian of philosophy.

Born in [[Germany]], he came to France in 1933. Before the war he studied at the [[Sorbonne]] and at the [[École pratique des hautes études]] under [[Henri Marguerite]].&lt;ref name=Brunschwig/&gt;

Goldschmidt "made his name with the publication of his thesis, ''Les Dialogues de Platon'', in 1947", for which [[Martial Gueroult]] was among the members of his examining committee.&lt;ref name=Brunschwig&gt;Jacques Brunschwig, 'Goldschmidt and Gueroult: Some Facts, Some Enigmas', ''Archiv für Geschichte der Philosophie'', vol. 8, issue 1 (2006), pp.82-106.&lt;/ref&gt; He taught at the [[University of Rennes]] from 1956 to 1966, then at [[Clermont-Ferrand]] from 1966 to 1976 and finally in [[Amiens]] until his death.

The manuscript of Goldschmidt's book on [[Aristotle]]'s views of time was delivered to the editor on the eve of his death.&lt;ref name=Brunschwig/&gt;

A volume was published in his memory as ''Histoire et Structure'' (1985).&lt;ref name="GoldschmidtBrunschwig1985"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Victor Goldschmidt|author2=Jacques Brunschwig|author3=Claude Imbert|author4=Alain Roger|title=Histoire Et Structure: À la Mémoire de Victor Goldschmidt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CLggoJbayKcC|accessdate=21 January 2013|year=1985|publisher=Vrin|isbn=978-2-7116-0883-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Goldschmidt is often considered a disciple of Martial Gueroult, Jacques Brunschwig has reconsidered their relationship, noting that the second edition of Godschmidt's thesis acknowledged a general debt to the "rigor" of [[Émile Bréhier]] rather than Gueroult.&lt;ref name=Brunschwig/&gt;
