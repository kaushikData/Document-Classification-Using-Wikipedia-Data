An '''adverse drug reaction''' ('''ADR''') is an injury caused by taking a [[medication]].&lt;ref name="MEDIA482"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://private.ich.org/LOB/media/MEDIA482.pdf |title=Guideline For Good Clinical Practice |work=International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use |date=10 June 1996 |page=2 |accessdate=12 July 2014 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; ADRs may occur following a single dose or prolonged administration of a [[drug]] or result from the combination of two or more drugs. The meaning of this expression differs from the meaning of "[[side effect]]", as this last expression might also imply that the effects can be beneficial.&lt;ref name="pmid15148066"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nebeker JR, Barach P, Samore MH |title=Clarifying adverse drug events: a clinician's guide to terminology, documentation, and reporting |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=140 |issue=10 |pages=795–801 |year=2004 |pmid=15148066 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-140-10-200405180-00017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The  study of ADRs is the concern of the field known as ''[[pharmacovigilance]]''. An '''adverse drug event''' ('''ADE''') refers to any injury occurring at the time a drug is used, whether or not it is identified as a cause of the injury.&lt;ref name="MEDIA482"/&gt; An ADR is a special type of ADE in which a causative relationship can be shown.
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Classification==
ADRs may be classified by e.g. cause and severity.

===Cause===
*Type A: Augmented pharmacologic effects - dose dependent and predictable
:Type A reactions, which constitute approximately 80% of adverse drug reactions, are usually a consequence of the drug’s primary pharmacological effect (e.g. bleeding when using the anticoagulant [[warfarin]]) or a low [[therapeutic index]] of the drug (e.g. nausea from [[digoxin]]), and they are therefore predictable. They are dose-related and usually mild, although they may be serious or even fatal (e.g. intracranial bleeding from warfarin). Such reactions are usually due to inappropriate dosage, especially when drug elimination is impaired. The term ‘side effects’ is often applied to minor type A reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ritter|first=J M|title=A Textbook of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics|year=2008|location=Great Britain|isbn=978-0-340-90046-8|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Idiosyncratic drug reaction|Type B]]: Idiosyncratic
Types A and B were proposed in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;Rawlins MD, Thompson JW. Pathogenesis of adverse drug reactions. In: Davies DM, ed. Textbook of adverse drug reactions. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1977:10.&lt;/ref&gt; and the other types were proposed subsequently when the first two proved insufficient to classify ADRs.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson JK. Drug therapy. In: Haslett C, Chilvers ER, Boon NA, Colledge NR, Hunter JAA, eds. Davidson's principles and practice of medicine 19th ed. Edinburgh: Elsevier Science, 2002:147-&lt;/ref&gt;

===Severity===
The U.S [[Food and Drug Administration]] defines a serious adverse event as one when the patient outcome is one of the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/report/DESK/advevnt.htm |title=MedWatch - What Is A Serious Adverse Event? |accessdate=2007-09-18 |work=| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070929095423/http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/report/DESK/advevnt.htm| archivedate= 29 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Death
* Life-threatening
* Hospitalization (initial or prolonged)
* Disability - significant, persistent, or permanent change, impairment, damage or disruption in the patient's body function/structure, physical activities or quality of life.
* Congenital anomaly
* Requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage

Severity is a point on an arbitrary scale of intensity of the adverse event in question.  The terms "severe" and "serious" when applied to adverse events are technically very different. They are easily confused but can not be used interchangeably, requiring care in usage.

A headache is severe, if it causes intense pain. There are scales like "visual analog scale" that help clinicians assess the severity. On the other hand, a headache is not usually serious (but may be in case of subarachnoid haemorrhage, subdural bleed, even a migraine may temporally fit criteria), unless it also satisfies the criteria for seriousness listed above.

==Location==
[[Adverse effect]]s may be local, i.e. limited to a certain location, or systemic, where a medication has caused adverse effects throughout the [[systemic circulation]].

For instance, some [[ocular antihypertensive]]s cause systemic effects,&lt;ref name=Rang146&gt;{{cite book |author=Rang, H. P. |title=Pharmacology |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |location=Edinburgh |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-443-07145-4 |oclc= |doi=}} Page 146&lt;/ref&gt; although they are administered locally as [[eye drop]]s, since a fraction escapes to the systemic circulation.

==Mechanisms==
[[Image:Drug-induced hepatitis low mag.jpg|thumb|Adverse drug reaction leading to [[hepatitis]] (drug-induced hepatitis) with [[granulomata]]. Other causes were excluded with extensive investigations. [[Liver]] [[biopsy]]. [[H&amp;E stain]].]]
As research better explains the biochemistry of drug use, fewer ADRs are Type B and more are Type A. Common mechanisms are:
* Abnormal pharmacokinetics due to
** [[Genetics|genetic]] factors
** [[Comorbidity|comorbid]] disease states
* [[Synergistic]] effects between either
** a drug and a disease
** two drugs

===Abnormal pharmacokinetics===
====Comorbid disease states====
Various diseases, especially those that cause [[renal failure|renal]] or [[liver failure|hepatic]] insufficiency, may alter drug metabolism. Resources are available that report changes in a drug's metabolism due to disease states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clinicaldruguse.com/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20071101053341/http://www.clinicaldruguse.com/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-11-01 |title=Clinical Drug Use |accessdate=2007-09-18 |format= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Genetic factors====
Abnormal drug metabolism may be due to inherited factors of either Phase I oxidation or Phase II conjugation.&lt;ref name="pmid11710893"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Phillips KA, Veenstra DL, Oren E, Lee JK, Sadee W |title=Potential role of pharmacogenomics in reducing adverse drug reactions: a systematic review |journal=JAMA |volume=286 |issue=18 |pages=2270–9 |year=2001 |pmid=11710893 |doi=10.1001/jama.286.18.2270}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12571264"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goldstein DB |title=Pharmacogenetics in the laboratory and the clinic |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=348 |issue=6 |pages=553–6 |year=2003 |pmid=12571264 |doi=10.1056/NEJMe020173}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pharmacogenomics]] is the study of the inherited basis for abnormal drug reactions.

=====Phase I reactions=====
Inheriting abnormal [[allele]]s of [[cytochrome]] [[cytochrome P450|P450]] can  alter drug metabolism. Tables are available to check for drug interactions due to P450 interactions.&lt;ref name="Drug-Interactions.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://medicine.iupui.edu/flockhart/ |title=Drug-Interactions.com |accessdate=2007-09-18 |format= |work=| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070830145407/http://medicine.iupui.edu/flockhart/| archivedate= 30 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12571261"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Richard Weinshilboum |title=Inheritance and drug response |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=348 |issue=6 |pages=529–37 |year=2003 |pmid=12571261 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra020021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inheriting abnormal [[Cholinesterase enzyme|butyrylcholinesterase]] ([[Cholinesterase enzyme|pseudocholinesterase]]) may affect metabolism of drugs such as [[succinylcholine]]&lt;ref name="pmid12571262"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Evans WE, McLeod HL |title=Pharmacogenomics--drug disposition, drug targets, and side effects |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=348 |issue=6 |pages=538–49 |year=2003 |pmid=12571262 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra020526}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Phase II reactions=====
Inheriting abnormal [[acetyltransferase|''N''-acetyltransferase]] which conjugated some drugs to facilitate excretion may affect the metabolism of drugs such as [[isoniazid]], [[hydralazine]], and [[procainamide]].&lt;ref name="pmid12571261"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12571262"/&gt;

Inheriting abnormal [[Thiopurine methyltransferase|thiopurine ''S''-methyltransferase]] may affect the metabolism of the [[thiopurine]] drugs [[mercaptopurine]] and [[azathioprine]].&lt;ref name="pmid12571261"/&gt;

====Interactions with other drugs====
The risk of [[drug interaction]]s is increased with [[polypharmacy]].

=====Protein binding=====
These interactions are usually transient and mild until a new steady state is achieved.&lt;ref name="pmid12473961"&gt;{{cite journal |author=DeVane CL |title=Clinical significance of drug binding, protein binding, and binding displacement drug interactions |journal=Psychopharmacology bulletin. |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=5–21 |year=2002 |pmid=12473961 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11907485"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Benet LZ, Hoener BA |title=Changes in plasma protein binding have little clinical relevance |journal=Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=115–21 |year=2002 |pmid=11907485 |doi=10.1067/mcp.2002.121829}}[http://gateway.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=linkout&amp;SEARCH=11907485.ui OVID full text] [http://gateway.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;NEWS=N&amp;PAGE=image&amp;IMAGE=00003098-200203000-00001%7cTT2&amp;D=ovft summary table at OVID]&lt;/ref&gt; These are mainly for drugs without much first-pass liver metabolism. The principal plasma proteins for drug binding are:&lt;ref name="pmid12369572"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sands CD, Chan ES, Welty TE |title=Revisiting the significance of warfarin protein-binding displacement interactions |journal=The Annals of Pharmacotherapy |volume=36 |issue=10 |pages=1642–4 |year=2002 |pmid=12369572 |doi=10.1345/aph.1A208 |url=http://www.theannals.com/cgi/reprint/36/10/1642 |access-date=18 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907073600/http://www.theannals.com/cgi/reprint/36/10/1642 |archive-date=7 September 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[albumin]]
# α1-acid glycoprotein
# lipoproteins
Some drug interactions with [[warfarin]] are due to changes in protein binding.&lt;ref name="pmid12369572"/&gt;

=====Cytochrome P450=====
Patients have abnormal metabolism by [[cytochrome]] [[cytochrome P450|P450]] due to either inheriting abnormal [[allele]]s or due to drug interactions. Tables are available to check for drug interactions due to P450 interactions.&lt;ref name="Drug-Interactions.com"/&gt;

===Synergistic effects===
An example of synergism is two drugs that both prolong the [[QT interval]].

==Assessing causality==
Causality assessment is used to determine the likelihood that a drug caused a suspected ADR. There are a number of different methods used to judge causation, including the [[Naranjo algorithm]], the Venulet algorithm and the WHO causality term assessment criteria. Each have pros and cons associated with their use and most require some level of expert judgement to apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Davies EC |title=An Investigation of Disagreement in Causality Assessment of Adverse Drug Reactions |url=http://adisonline.com/pharmaceuticalmedicine/Fulltext/2011/25010/An_Investigation_of_Disagreement_in_Causality.3.aspx |journal=Pharm Med |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=17–24 |year=2011 |name-list-format=vanc |author2=Rowe PH |author3=James S |display-authors=3 |doi=10.1007/bf03256843 |author4=&lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt; |access-date=2 June 2011 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120701152106/http://adisonline.com/pharmaceuticalmedicine/Fulltext/2011/25010/An_Investigation_of_Disagreement_in_Causality.3.aspx |archive-date=1 July 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
An ADR should not be labeled as 'certain' unless the ADR abates with a [[challenge-dechallenge-rechallenge]] protocol (stopping and starting the agent in question). The chronology of the onset of the suspected ADR is important, as another substance or factor may be implicated as a cause; co-prescribed medications and underlying psychiatric conditions may be factors in the ADR.&lt;ref name="pmid15148066" /&gt;

Assigning causality to a specific agent often proves difficult, unless the event is found during a clinical study or large databases are used. Both methods have difficulties and can be fraught with error. Even in clinical studies some ADRs may be missed as large numbers of test individuals are required to find that adverse drug reaction. Psychiatric ADRs are often missed as they are grouped together in the questionnaires used to assess the population.&lt;ref name="pmid20852483"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holvey|first=C|author2=Connolly, A.|author3= Taylor, D.|title=Psychiatric side effects of non-psychiatric drugs.|journal=British journal of hospital medicine (London, England : 2005)|date=August 2010|volume=71|issue=8|pages=432–6|pmid=20852483|doi=10.12968/hmed.2010.71.8.77664}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid14626141"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Otsubo|first=T|title=[Psychiatric complications of medicines].|journal=Ryoikibetsu shokogun shirizu|year=2003|issue=40|pages=369–73|pmid=14626141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monitoring bodies==
Many countries have official bodies that monitor drug safety and reactions. On an international level, the [[WHO]] runs the [[Uppsala Monitoring Centre]], and the [[European Union]] runs the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMEA). In the [[United States]], the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) is responsible for monitoring post-marketing studies.
In Canada, the Marketed Health Products Directorate of Health Canada is responsible for the surveillance of marketed health products. In [[Australia]], the [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]] (TGA) conducts postmarket monitoring of therapeutic products.  In the UK the [[Yellow Card Scheme]] was established in 1963.

==Epidemiology==
A study by the [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] (AHRQ) found that in 2011, sedatives and hypnotics were a leading source for adverse drug events seen in the hospital setting.  Approximately 2.8% of all ADEs present on admission and 4.4% of ADEs that originated during a hospital stay were caused by a sedative or hypnotic drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Weiss AJ, Elixhauser A|title= Origin of Adverse Drug Events in U.S. Hospitals, 2011|type=HCUP Statistical Brief #158|publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality|location=Rockville, MD|date=July 2013|url=http://hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb158.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A second study by AHRQ found that in 2011, the most common specifically identified causes of adverse drug events that originated during hospital stays in the U.S. were steroids, antibiotics, opiates/narcotics, and anticoagulants. Patients treated in urban teaching hospitals had higher rates of ADEs involving antibiotics and opiates/narcotics compared to those treated in urban nonteaching hospitals.  Those treated in private, nonprofit hospitals had higher rates of most ADE causes compared to patients treated in public or private, for-profit hospitals.&lt;ref name="hcup-us.ahrq.gov"&gt;{{cite web|authors=Weiss A.J., Elixhauser A.|title= Characteristics of Adverse Drug Events Originating During the Hospital Stay, 2011|type=HCUP Statistical Brief #164|date=October 2013|publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality|location=Rockville, MD|url=http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb164.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., females had a higher rate of ADEs involving opiates and narcotics than males in 2011, while male patients had a higher rate of anticoagulant ADEs.  Nearly 8 in 1,000 adults aged 65 years or older experienced one of the four most common ADEs (steroids, antibiotics, opiates/narcotics, and anticoagulants) during hospitalization.&lt;ref name="hcup-us.ahrq.gov"/&gt; A study showed that 48% of patients had an adverse drug reaction to at least one drug, and pharmacist involvement helps to pick up adverse drug reactions.&lt;ref name="Yeung E"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Yeung E | title = Adverse drug reactions: a potential role for pharmacists | journal = British Journal of General Practice | volume = 65| issue = 639 | pages = 511 | year = 2015 | pmid = 26412813 | doi = 10.3399/bjgp15X686821 | url = http://bjgp.org/content/65/639/511.1 | pmc=4582849}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 McKinsey &amp;Co. concluded that the cost of the 35 million preventable adverse drug events would be as high as US$115 billion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gs1.org/docs/healthcare/McKinsey_Healthcare_Report_Strength_in_Unity.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Akorn acquired rival Hi-Tech Pharmacal in 2013.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hitechpharmacal-offer-idUSBRE97Q0EL20130827|author=Reuters Editorial|title=Eye drug maker Akorn to buy rival Hi-Tech Pharmacal for $640 million|website=Reuters|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, it was reported that a hacker was trying to sell an Akorn customer database of more than 50,000 records. Akorn commented that "Although much of the information acquired is publicly available, we are in the process of notifying our valued customers about this incident".&lt;ref name=CSO&gt;{{cite news|title=Akorn Inc. has customer database stolen, records offered to highest bidder|url=http://www.csoonline.com/article/2938032/data-breach/akorn-inc-has-customer-database-stolen-records-offered-to-highest-bidder.html|accessdate=28 June 2015|work=CSO|date=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, Akorn agreed to be acquired by [[Fresenius (company)|Fresenius]] for $4.3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-24/fresenius-agrees-to-buy-akorn-merck-kgaa-biosimilars-business|title=Fresenius Buys Akorn for $4.3 Billion in U.S. Expansion|author=|date=24 April 2017|publisher=|accessdate=23 September 2017|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; These plans were abandoned by Fresenius after Akorn couldn′t meet basic requirements for an acquisition.

In Spain the Foundation focuses its efforts on the development of programs to lighten the precarious situation facing so many Spanish families due to the [[2008–2013 Spanish financial crisis|crisis]], and in this area, the Foundation carries out the following projects:

* LA CASA DE LA PAZ ("PEACE HOME")- is a health care project aimed at children from different countries, affected by serious diseases that have no possibility of treatment in their home countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From Lebanon to Spain: Young Palestine refugee overcomes cancer|url=http://www.unrwa.org/etemplate.php?id=1571|work=17 December 2012|publisher=[[UNRWA]]|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* HOGAR DE ACOGIDA ("HOME FOR THE SICK")- which works to improve the lives of sick people in Spain without resources, usually affected by rare diseases. They are referred to hospitals, offering médical, psychological aid financed through the Foundation.
* COMEDORES SOCIALES ("COMMUNITY KITCHEN")- located in Madrid, where they offer meals prepared and served a significant number of people in need. Fridays they donate food packs for each family, enough to last for the weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=El comedor de la gente sin 'tupper'|url=http://www.elconfidencial.com/sociedad/2012/09/15/el-comedor-de-la-gente-sin-tupper-105480|accessdate=25 March 2013|newspaper=El Confidencial|date=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* COMEDOR INVISIBLE ("INVISIBLE KITCHEN")- is a project for the "shameful poor", this are people not used to asking for help, and are ashamed of their poverty. The Foundation aims to help these people that suffer in silence the consequences of the economic crisis by establishing a grocery bag delivery program, without stigmatizing the recipient of the aid.
* MUJERES EN RIESGO DE EXCLUSIÓN SOCIAL ("WOMEN AT RISK OF SOCIAL EXCLUSION")- The Foundation began a program to help women at risk of social exclusion. Through and agreement with [[Spain]]'s Immigration Head Office, it set up a protocol to help single women, evicted from their homes, in some cases with their children.
The program offers them, free housing, education and counseling. In 2013 [[Community of Madrid]] signs a cooperation agreement with Alberto and Elena Cortina Foundation by which they refer women at risk of social exclusion to the foundation's main care Facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Comunidad firma un convenio para atender a inmigrantes en riesgo de exclusión|url=http://www.abc.es/agencias/noticia.asp?noticia=1498015|accessdate=19 September 2013|newspaper=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]|date=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Passenger Experience Week 2018, Hamburg (1X7A3702).jpg|thumb|Chair for persons with reduced mobility aboard aircraft]]
There are no worldwide uniform standards regulating the provision of '''assistance for airline passengers with disabilities'''. American regulations place the responsibility on the airlines, the European Union's rules make the airport responsible for providing the assistance, whereas in South America there are no regulations at all. The [[International Air Transport Association]] (IATA) is concerned about the difficulties caused by inconsistent regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All Passengers This Way {{!}} Airlines International|url=http://airlines.iata.org/analysis/all-passengers-this-way|website=airlines.iata.org|accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Union==
According to [[EU]] regulation 1107/2006, [[persons with reduced mobility]] have the right to assistance during airline travel. The assistance is mandated for flights on any airline departing from an airport in the EU or flights to an airport in the EU on an aircraft registered in any EU country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Passengers with disabilities and reduced mobility {{!}} UK Civil Aviation Authority|url=https://www.caa.co.uk/Passengers/PRM/Passengers-with-disabilities-and-reduced-mobility/|website=www.caa.co.uk|accessdate=12 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
The [[Air Carrier Access Act]] of 1986 prohibits commercial [[airlines]] from discriminating against passengers with disabilities. The act was passed by the [[U.S. Congress]] in direct response to a narrow interpretation of [[Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act]] of 1973 by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in [[U.S. Department of Transportation]] (DOT) v. [[Paralyzed Veterans of America]] (PVA). In PVA, the Supreme Court held that private, commercial air carriers are not liable under Section 504 because they are not "direct recipients" of [[federal funding]] to [[airports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=United States Department of Transportation v. Paralyzed Veterans of America |vol=477 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=597 |pinpoint= |court= |date=1986 |url=https://openjurist.org/477/us/597 |accessdate=2017-09-25 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==IATA ticket codes==
Specific [[IATA]] codes are used on the flight ticket to indicate the kind of assistance the person needs, such as wheelchair assistance inside the terminal, between the terminal and the plane, climbing up/down to/from the plane, and moving within the plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blind-deaf passengersn (BLND-DEAF)|url=https://www.mobility-service.org/en/blnd-deaf-blind-deaf|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.londoncityairport.com/intheairport/page/reduced-mobility-and-special-assistance|title=PRM &amp; Special Assistance|publisher=London Airport|accessdate=11 October 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317052401/https://www.londoncityairport.com/intheairport/page/reduced-mobility-and-special-assistance|archivedate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2233">The '''Association of Certifying Factory Surgeons''' was founded in 1888 and was based in Manchester, with branches in other cities.

Certifying surgeons were first appointed under the [[Factory Act]] of 1833 which required that a child between the ages of nine and eleven required a certificate from a doctor stating that they were eligible to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive of the Association of Certifying Factory Surgeons|url=http://archives.li.man.ac.uk/ead/search?operation=search&amp;fieldidx1=bath.corporateName&amp;fieldrel1=exact&amp;fieldcont1=association%20of%20certifying%20factory%20surgeons|website=Manchester University|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were required to report on certain accidents and to certify that children appeared to be of a specified age and with normal bodily strength appropriate to that age.  In 1874 the association reported that between 20% and 50% of those presented were rejected as either under age or unfit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Certifying Factory Surgeons|journal=British Medical Journal|date=28 October 1876|page=563|jstor=25243153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archives of the association from 1892 to 1969 are held in The [[University of Manchester]] Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archives of the Association of Certifying Factory Surgeons|url=http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/search-resources/guide-to-special-collections/atoz/association-of-certifying-factory-surgeons/|website=University of Manchester|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1911 Annual General Meeting was held in the Trocadero Restaurant and reported extensively in the [[British Medical Journal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Association of Certifying Factory Surgeons|journal=British Medical Journal|date=16 December 1911|page=1603}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1920 the BMJ reported on the unsuccessful campaign against the reduction of fees for factory surgeons associated with the wartime economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Association of Certifying Factory Surgeons|journal=British Medical Journal|date=6 March 1920|page=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In psychology, '''avoidance/avoidant coping''' or '''escape coping''' is a [[Coping (psychology)#Negative techniques .28maladaptive coping or non-coping.29|maladaptive coping]] mechanism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of coping: theory, research, applications|editor=Moshe Zeidner, Norman S. Endler|publisher=Wiley|year=1995|page=514|isbn=978-0-471-59946-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; characterized by the effort to avoid dealing with a [[stressor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Friedman|first=Howard S. |first2=Roxane Cohen|last2= Silver|title=Foundations of Health Psychology |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|page=124|isbn= 978-0-19-513959-4|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Coping'' refers to behaviors that attempt to protect oneself from psychological damage.&lt;ref name="Pearlin1978"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=649936 |year=1978 |last1=Pearlin |first1=LI |last2=Schooler |first2=C |title=The structure of coping |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=2–21 |journal=Journal of health and social behavior}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatives to avoidance coping include modifying or eliminating the conditions that gave rise to the problem and changing the perception of an experience in a way that neutralizes the problem.&lt;ref name="Pearlin1978" /&gt;

Avoidance coping, including [[social withdrawal]], is an aspect of [[avoidant personality disorder]], but not everyone who displays such behaviors meets the definition of having a [[personality disorder]].

[[Post-traumatic stress disorder]] may include avoidance coping behavior: PTSD sufferers may draw into themselves, avoiding the trauma and partaking in cognitive or behavioral avoidance coping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jts.20185 |title=Coping, symptoms, and functioning outcomes of patients with post-traumatic stress disorder |year=2006 |last1=Tiet |first1=Quyen Q. |last2=Rosen |first2=Craig |last3=Cavella |first3=Steven |last4=Moos |first4=Rudolf H. |last5=Finney |first5=John W. |last6=Yesavage |first6=Jerome |journal=Journal of Traumatic Stress |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=799–811 |pmid=17195979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Therapy==
[[Cognitive behavioral therapy|Cognitive behavioral]] and [[psychoanalytic therapy]] are used to help those coping by avoidance to acknowledge, comprehend, and express their emotions. [[Acceptance and commitment therapy]], a behavioral therapy that focuses on breaking down avoidance coping and showing it to be an unhealthy method for dealing with traumatic experiences, is also sometimes used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tull|first=Dr.Matthew|title=PTSD and Emotional Avoidance|url=http://ptsd.about.com/od/symptomsanddiagnosis/a/emotionalavoid.htm|publisher=About.com Health's Disease and Condition content is reviewed by the Medical Review Board|accessdate=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both active-cognitive and active-behavioral coping are used as replacement techniques for avoidance coping. Active-cognitive coping includes changing one's attitude towards a stressful event and looking for any positive impacts. Active-behavioral coping refers taking positive actions after finding out more about the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00844267 |title=The role of coping responses and social resources in attenuating the stress of life events |year=1981 |last1=Billings |first1=Andrew G. |last2=Moos |first2=Rudolf H. |journal=Journal of Behavioral Medicine |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=139–57 |pmid=7321033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Literature on coping often classifies coping strategies into two broad categories: approach/active coping and avoidance/passive coping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roth|first=S|author2=Cohen, L|title=Approach, avoidance, and coping with stress|journal=American Psychologist|date=1986|volume=41|series=813-819|issue=7|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.41.7.813|pages=813–819}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleinke|first=C|title=What does it mean to cope|date=2007|publisher=The Praeger Handbook on Stress and Coping|location=Westport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approach coping includes behaviors that attempt to reduce stress by alleviating the problem directly, and avoidance coping includes behaviors that reduce stress by distancing oneself from the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carver|first=C|author2=Scheier, M |author3=Weintraub, J |title=Assessing coping strategies: a theoretically based approach|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1989|volume=56|issue=2|pages=267–283|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.56.2.267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, approach coping has been seen as the healthiest and most beneficial way to reduce stress, while avoidance coping has been associated with negative personality traits, potentially harmful activities, and generally poorer outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holahan|first=C|author2=Moos, R|title=Life stress and health: Personality, coping, and family support in stress resistance|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1985|volume=49|issue=3|pages=739–747|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.49.3.739}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, research has shown that some types of avoidance coping have beneficial outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCaul|first=K|author2=Malott, J|title=Distraction and coping with pain|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1984|volume=95|issue=3|pages=516–533|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.95.3.516}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seidman|first=S|author2=Zager, J|title=A study of coping behaviours and teacher burnout|journal=Work and stress|date=1991|volume=5|issue=3|pages=205–216|doi=10.1080/02678379108257019}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Long and Haney found that both jogging and relaxation techniques were equally successful at reducing anxiety and increasing feelings of self-efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Long|first=B|author2=Haney, C|title=Long-term follow-up of stressed working women: a comparison of aerobic exercise and progressive relaxation.|journal=Journal of sport and exercise psychology|date=1988|volume=10|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it seems that positive forms of passive coping such as exercise and meditation have qualitatively different outcomes from negative forms such as binge eating and drug use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lindquist|first=T|author2=Beilin, J |author3=Knuiman, M |title=Influence of lifestyle, coping, and job stress on blood pressure in men and women|journal=Hypertension|date=1997|volume=29|issue=1|pages=1–7|doi=10.1161/01.hyp.29.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These positive forms of passive coping may be particularly beneficial for alleviating stress when the individual does not currently have the resources to eliminate the problem directly, indicating the advantage of flexibility when engaging in coping behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carver|first=C|author2=Connor-Smith, J|title=Personality and coping|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|date=2010|volume=61|pages=679–704|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.093008.100352|pmid=19572784}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3430">A '''bay dog''' (or '''bailer''', in [[Australian English]]) is a dog that is specially trained to find, chase, and then [[Dog communication#Auditory communication|bay]], or howl at from a safe distance from large animals during a [[Hunting|hunt]], such as during a wild [[boar]] hunt. 

Bay dogs chase and circle the boar, keeping it cornered in one place, while barking intensely. This behavior is known as "baying" or keeping the boar "at bay". In Australia the terms "bay-dogs" and "baying" are not in common usage. In Australia these are colloquially referred to as "bailers" and "bailing", respectively.

The vocalizing of the dogs at bay signals the modern firearms hunter to close the distance with the pack and once caught up, to dispatch the boar with a well-placed gunshot. For the primitive weapons hunter the bay signals the hunters to release the "[[catch dog]]s, " that are used to then catch and hold the [[boar]], allowing hunters to hog-tie the boar for relocation or kill the boar with a knife, spear or similar instrument. The dogs used for baying are typically [[cur]]s, [[hound]]s, and various purpose-bred [[Dog hybrids and crossbreeds|crosses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huntingdogos.com/cur_dog_history.asp|title=Cur Dog History|work=huntingdogos.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some crossing has occurred between "bay &amp; catch" dogs, due to being raised together for generations, along with purpose-breeding. So, some "hog dogs" have shared traits and abilities (i.e., bay dogs capable of holding, or, catch dogs hunting by scent). But they are usually kept separate (no crossing), and used according to their own unique abilities.

This technique is also the traditional way to hunt moose in the northern Scandinavian forests using the native spitzer hounds where it allows the hunter to stealthily move close to the animal in the dense forests, only taking a step when the dog barks to cover any sound, sometimes having to move as close as 10 to 30 meters to get a shot through the brush. Very often this is used in conjuncture with a team of hunters using fixed positions to take moose moving away from the baying dog.

'''Brian Leslie Weiss''' (born November 6, 1944) is an American [[psychiatrist]], [[hypnotherapist]], and author who specializes in so-called ''[[past life regression]]'', a field identified as [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/past-life-regression-therapy-encouraging-fantasy/ |title=Past Life Regression Therapy: Encouraging Fantasy |date=2016-07-26 |website=Science-Based Medicine |language=en-US |access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bodkin |first=J.

==Education and medical career==
Weiss studied at  [[Columbia University]],&lt;ref name=nyt10/&gt; and later graduated from the Yale University School of Medicine in 1970, completing an internship in [[internal medicine]] at the [[New York University Medical Center]] then returning to Yale  for a two-year [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] in psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;http://ww2.doh.state.fl.us/irm00Profiling/ProfileEDUC.asp?LicId=16269&amp;ProfNBR=1501&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to become Head of Psychiatry, [[Mount Sinai Medical Center &amp; Miami Heart Institute|Mount Sinai Medical Center]], Miami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Past Lives |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=O8IzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kDIHAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7105,7614788&amp;dq=mount+sinai+dr+brian+weiss&amp;hl=en |publisher=Lodi News-Sentinel |date=Oct 19, 1989 |accessdate=June 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Doctor Details Patient's Past Lives|url= |publisher=Miami Herald |date= May 29, 1989|page=6B |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Past life regression and future life progression==
According to Weiss, in 1980 one of his patients, "Catherine", began discussing past-life experiences under [[hypnosis]]. Weiss did not believe in reincarnation at the time but, after confirming elements of Catherine's stories through public records, came to be convinced of the survival of an element of the human personality after death.&lt;ref name=rl1xxx&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/seen/breakfast/20020805break0805p1.asp Breakfast with Brian Weiss], ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', August 5, 2002, Accessed April 25, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Weiss claims he has regressed more than 4,000 patients since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein-Moser, Edie. [http://wisdom-magazine.com/Article.aspx/478/ "Interview with Brian Weiss"]. ''Wisdom'' magazine. ''Wisdom-Magazine.com''. 2008. Retrieved June 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weiss advocates [[hypnotic regression]] as therapy, claiming that many phobias and ailments are rooted in past-life experiences whose acknowledgment by the patient can have a curative effect. Weiss also writes about [[Mediumship|messages]] received from the "Masters", or "super-evolved, nonphysical souls", he claims to have communicated with through his subjects.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brianweiss.com/about-the-books/messages-from-the-masters/&lt;/ref&gt; Weiss holds workshops and seminars across the United States that explain and teach self-regression mediations techniques. This includes the Hay House I Can Do It one day workshops and the intense experiential workshops at the Omega Institute for Holistic Studies in NY.

==Personal life==
Weiss lives with his wife Carole in [[Miami]], Florida, where he writes and conducts public seminars and workshops on the subject of reincarnation.&lt;ref name=nyt10&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Lisa|title=Remembrances of Lives Past|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/29/fashion/29PastLives.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;|publisher=The New York Times|date=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter Amy E. Weiss is the co-author of his 2012 book ''Miracles Happen: The Transformational Healing Power of Past-Life Memories''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062201220 ''Miracles Happen: The Transformational Healing Power of Past-Life Memories'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Woman relives the spooky experience with past-life regression |publisher=Daily Mail| url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2336088/Immediately-I-saw-body-old-man-long-white-hair-living-Middle-Ages-Woman-relives-spooky-experience-past-life-regression.html|date= 5 June 2013 | accessdate = 2014-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cadbury World''' is a visitor attraction, featuring a self-guided exhibition tour, created and run by the [[Cadbury plc|Cadbury]] [[chocolate]] company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cadburyworld.co.uk/experience |title=The Experience |author=  |publisher=Cadbury |date= |accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Fallingchocs.jpg|thumb|right|180 px|Sign inside "Cadabra", one of Cadbury World's fourteen attractions]] --&gt;

=== Overview ===
Cadbury World was opened on 14 August 1990 by Morgan Anderson on Cadbury's [[Bournville]] manufacturing site, and has expanded and developed its content through 'continuous improvement'.

Cadbury World has gone on to become one of Birmingham's largest leisure attractions - welcoming over 500,000 visitors each year, especially children and delivering a respected education programme (linking back directly to the educational advancements and interests of the company's original founding fathers).

Whilst not a factory tour, Cadbury World offers its visitors the opportunity to explore and discover chocolate's history, and to learn about the origins and story of the Cadbury business, which is part of [[Mondelez]], the world's second largest [[confectionery]] manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.candyindustry.com/2015-Global-Top-100-Part-4 |title=2015 Global Top 100 (25-1) |author=  |publisher=Candy Industry |date= |accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fourteen Zones ===

Cadbury World currently features 14 zones which tell the story of chocolate and the Cadbury business through various static sets, animatronics, video presentations, multi-sensory cinema, interactive displays and activities, and staff demonstrations.

These zones also include "The [[Bournville]] Experience" (Opened in 2007 replacing the Cadbury Collection Museum), which explains the background to the development of the site on which it is located and "4D Chocolate Adventure", constructed in 2014 and replacing "Essence" which in turn replaced "Cadburyland" before it, and which incorporates a 3D cinema.

==Dunedin==
[[File:Cadbury factory dunedin.jpg|thumb|320px|right|Exterior of Cadbury World, Dunedin.]]
===History===
In July 2003 another Cadbury World was opened in [[Dunedin]], [[New Zealand]]. It is located in the [[Cadbury plc|Cadbury]] Factory site at 280 Cumberland St, close to the city centre near [[The Octagon, Dunedin|the Octagon]]. This is one of the largest factories in [[Dunedin]] that also offers tours and has become very popular with [[tourist]]s visiting [[Dunedin]]. In May 2009 renovations were carried out inside the Cadbury World Visitors' Centre. The attractions which had existed since the opening were taken out, and new areas were added, including an [[Aztec]]-themed room and Old England room. Unlike the Cadbury World in Birmingham, it offers guided tours around the manufacturing area of the factory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cadbury.co.nz/cadbury-world/cadbury-world-dunedin-tours/ |title=Cadbury World Dunedin Tours |author=  |publisher=Cadbury |date= |accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 February 2017, Amanda Banfield, Mondelez's area vice-president for Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, confirmed that Cadbury World Dunedin would remain open despite the company's decision to close the Dunedin factory by March 2018. She also confirmed that Mondelez was planning to redevelop the Cadbury World Dunedin site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cadbury World to remain open in Dunedin|url=https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/cadbury-world-remain-open-dunedin|accessdate=16 February 2017|publisher=[[Otago Daily Times]]|date=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In April 2018 Mondelez received permission to move Cadbury World to a separate building close to the factory site in Castle Street in central Dunedin, which would allow for a major expansion of Cadbury World. The new premises, which would include a cafe, retail area, an outdoor playground, and interactive activities, is due to be completed by late 2018, and would be open every day of the year. Expectation is for annual visitor numbers to increase as a result from around 120,000 per year to around 200,000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Approval given for Cadbury World redevelopment|url=https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/approval-given-cadbury-world-redevelopment|accessdate=20 April 2018|publisher=[[Otago Daily Times]]|date=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 May 2018, it was reported that Cadbury World would be closing down to make way for a new NZ$1.4 billion hospital to replace the existing [[Dunedin Public Hospital]]. Mondelez had previously announced last year that while most of the Cumberland Street site would be sold, it would retain the old factory for a redeveloped Cadbudry World. Mondelez vice-president Banfield confirmed that the former Cadbury site had been sold to the [[Ministry of Health (New Zealand)|Ministry of Heath]] for an undisclosed amount. It was reported that the closure of Cadbury World would lead to the loss of 39 jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNeilly|first1=Hamish|title=Popular tourist attraction Cadbury World closing to make way for $1.4 billion Dunedin Hospital|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/103621156/popular-tourist-attraction-cadbury-world-closing-to-make-way-for-14-billion-dunedin-hospital|accessdate=4 May 2018|publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]]|date=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cadbury World to close|url=https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/cadbury-world-close|accessdate=4 May 2018|publisher=''[[Otago Daily Times]]''|date=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dunedin Hospital announcement: What you need to know|url=https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/dunedin-hospital-announcement-what-you-need-know|accessdate=4 May 2018|publisher=''[[Otago Daily Times]]''|date=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Tours===
The Dunedin Cadbury World offers three different tours: the Factory Tour, the Shortened Tour, and the Centre Tour. The Factory Tour takes approximately 75 minutes, and incorporates a ten-minute self-guided tour around the Visitors' Centre before a fully guided tour through several areas of the operational factory. Chocolate samples&amp;mdash;including fresh liquid chocolate&amp;mdash;are given along the way, and the tour culminates in a five-story decommissioned crumb storage silo, inside of which currently is the world's largest chocolate waterfall. The Factory Tour only operates on weekdays; the factory does not work on the weekends. As a result, Shortened Tours are offered on Saturdays and Sundays. These tours do not venture into the factory; instead a DVD is played in which shows weekday operation. The final tour option, the Centre Tour, is purely self-guided around the Visitors' Centre. All tours end up in the Cadbury World retail outlet, which has chocolate at discounted prices compared to supermarkets in Dunedin, and unique, novelty souvenirs.

'''Clinical research''' is a branch of [[healthcare science]] that determines the safety and effectiveness ([[efficacy]]) of [[medications]], [[Medical device|devices]], [[diagnostics|diagnostic products]] and [[medical treatment|treatment regimens]] intended for human use. These may be used for prevention, treatment, diagnosis or for relieving symptoms of a disease. Clinical research is different from clinical practice. In clinical practice established treatments are used, while in clinical research evidence is collected to establish a treatment.

==Overview==
The term "clinical research" refers to the entire bibliography of a drug/device/biologic, in fact any test article from its inception in the lab to its introduction to the consumer market and beyond. Once the promising candidate or the molecule is identified in the lab, it is subjected to pre-clinical studies or animal studies where different aspects of the test article (including its safety [[toxicity]] if applicable and [[efficacy]], if possible at this early stage) are studied.&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, J.W. (2008). Educational research: Planning, conducting, and evaluating quantitative and qualitative research (3rd). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall. 2008, p. 300. {{ISBN|0-13-613550-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchmedics.com/ |title=Professional Medical Writing |accessdate=October 29, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6lcighdfv?url=http://researchmedics.com/ |archivedate=October 29, 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=news1309&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news-medical.net/whitepaper/20130916/Adaptive-Clinical-Trials-for-Overcoming-Research-Challenges.aspx |title=Adaptive Clinical Trials for Overcoming Research Challenges |publisher=News-medical.net |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], when a test article is unapproved or not yet cleared by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] ([[FDA]]), or when an approved or cleared test article is used in a way that may significantly increase the risks (or decreases the acceptability of the risks), the data obtained from the pre-clinical studies or other supporting evidence, case studies of off label use, etc. are submitted in support of an [[Investigational New Drug]] (IND) application&lt;ref&gt;FDA Page last updated 27 October 2014 [http://www.fda.gov/cder/regulatory/applications/ind_page_1.htm Investigational New Drug (IND) Application]&lt;/ref&gt; to the FDA for review prior to conducting studies that involve even one human and a test article if the results are intended to be submitted to or held for inspection by the FDA at any time in the future (in the case of an already approved test article, if intended to submit or hold for inspection by the FDA in support of a change in labeling or advertising). Where devices are concerned the submission to the FDA would be for an [[Investigational Device Exemption]] (IDE) application if the device is a significant risk device or is not in some way exempt from prior submission to the [[FDA]]. In addition, clinical research may require [[Institutional Review Board]] (IRB) or Research Ethics Board (REB) and possibly other institutional committee reviews, Privacy Board, Conflict of Interest Committee, Radiation Safety Committee, Radioactive Drug Research Committee, etc. approval whether or not the research requires prior submission to the FDA. Clinical research review criteria will depend on which federal regulations the research is subject to (e.g., ([[Department of Health and Human Services]] (DHHS) if federally funded, FDA as already discussed) and will depend on which regulations the institutions subscribe to, in addition to any more stringent criteria added by the institution possibly in response to state or local laws/policies or accreditation entity recommendations. This additional layer of review (IRB/REB in particular) is critical to the protection of human subjects especially when you consider that often research subject to the FDA regulation for prior submission is allowed to proceed, by those same FDA regulations, 30 days after submission to the FDA unless specifically notified by the FDA not to initiate the study.

Clinical research is often conducted at academic medical centers and affiliated research study sites. These centers and sites provide the prestige of the academic institution as well as access to larger metropolitan areas, providing a larger pool of medical participants. These academic medical centers often have their internal [[Institutional review board|Institutional Review Boards]] that oversee the ethical conduct of medical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mohamadi|first=Amin|last2=Asghari|first2=Fariba|last3=Rashidian|first3=Arash|date=2014|title=Continuing review of ethics in clinical trials: a surveillance study in Iran|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics and History of Medicine|volume=7|pages=22|pmc=4648212|pmid=26587202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The clinical research ecosystem involves a complex network of sites, pharmaceutical companies and academic research institutions. This has led to a growing field of technologies used for managing the data and operational factors of clinical research. Clinical research management is often aided by [[eClinical]] systems to help automate the management and conducting of [[clinical trials]].

In the [[European Union]], the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) acts in a similar fashion for studies conducted in their region. These human studies are conducted in four phases in research subjects that give [[consent]] to participate in the [[clinical trials]].

==Phases==
{{main|Phases of clinical research}}
Clinical trials involving new drugs are commonly classified into four phases. Each phase of the drug approval process is treated as a separate [[clinical trial]]. The drug-development process will normally proceed through all four phases over many years. If the drug successfully passes through Phases I, II, and III, it will usually be approved by the national regulatory authority for use in the general population. Phase IV are 'post-approval' studies.

Phase I includes 20 to 100 healthy volunteers or individuals with the disease/condition. This study typically lasts several months and its purpose is safety and dosage. Phase II includes larger number of individual participants ranging 100-300, and phase III includes Approximately 1000-3000 participants to collect more data about the drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nih.gov/health-information/nih-clinical-research-trials-you/basics|title=The Basics|website=National Institutes of Health|date=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 70% of drugs advance to the next phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/ForPatients/Approvals/Drugs/ucm405622.htm|title=The Drug Development Process|last=|first=|website=www.fda.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before pharmaceutical companies start clinical trials on a drug, they conduct extensive [[pre-clinical development|pre-clinical studies]].

The '''collapse of compassion''' is a [[psychological]] theory termed as the human tendency to turn away from mass [[suffering]]. This theory was proposed by [[Paul Slovic]] and [[Deborah Small]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coviden|first1=Kaelin|title=The Collapse of Compassion|website=Thoughts of Ascent}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is directly linked to that phenomenon which states if the number of people in need of help increases, the amount of [[compassion]] people would feel toward the people decreases. [[Psychic numbing]] is also directly linked to the collapse of compassion as well. Slovic introduced the concept of psychophysical numbing, which is the diminished sensitivity to the value of life and an inability to appreciate loss.&lt;ref&gt;Slovic, Paul; David Zionts; Andrew K. Woods; Ryan Goodman; Derek Jinks (August 2011). "Psychic numbing and mass atrocity". New York University School of Law: 1–17. SSRN 1809951 Freely accessible.&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers proposed that in the human mind, large groups are almost staggering and therefore they rather participate in regulating their emotions to limit their overwhelming levels of emotions due to their experiences. This is because individuals tend to draw out no emotion regulation compared to that of the groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=CD|first1=Cameron|last2=KD|first2=Payne|title=Escaping affect: how motivated emotion regulation creates insensitivity to mass suffering|date=2011|volume=100|issue=1|pages=1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
The collapse of compassion happens because people actively, perhaps subconsciously, regulate their emotions to withhold the compassion they feel for the groups of people who suffer. It is not because people are less capable of caring about plenty suffering rather than individuals who suffer. This can also be put as withholding our compassion for a wide range of sufferers not being a part of us from birth, rather it is something we do almost actively, in that moment people actively reduce or remove their affection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Liebman|first1=Matthew|title=Mass Animal Suffering and the Collapse of Compassion|website=Animal Legal Defense Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic and political views==

The phenomenon of the collapse of compassion has also been written about in modern journalism and media reports. On 13 January 2015, Mark Hay reported that the massacre carried out by Boko Haram received almost no immediate media attention. However, on 7 January 2015, when 12 satirists from Charlie Hebdo magazine were killed in Paris, "the media erupted (and continues to erupt) with heartfelt outrage and constant coverage."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.good.is/articles/boko-haram-baga-nigeria-charlie-hebdo|title=Why Journalists Don’t Seem to Care About the Tragic Massacre in Nigeria|last=Hay|first=Mark|date=13 January 2015|work=|access-date=22 December 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists like Simon Allison of the [[Daily Maverick]] have clarified bias media coverage as a sign that the media and the world do not mourn deaths in Africa the way they do in the West, this obvious bias in media coverage also points towards a more understated failure in our natural human ability to gather any empathy as the number of victims rise following a mass killing or to see past the fact that numbers of people are not people, but that they are numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coviden|first1=Kaelin|title=The Collapse of Compassion|website=Thoughts of Ascent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic theorists argued that emotions and helping behaviour should track the number of people in need of help, we should respond more strongly when more people are suffering, whatever the context.&lt;ref&gt;Schelling, T. (1968). The life you save may be your own. In S.B. Chase, Jr. (Ed.), Problems in public expenditure analysis (pp. 127-162). Washington, D.C.: The Brookings Institution.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet when psychologists measure actual emotion and helping behaviour, this is not the observed result. People tend to experience strong emotion in response to one individual in need of aid, and this translates into a strong desire to help. But when there are many individuals, people actually feel less emotion and act less charitably.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, E.W., &amp; Ashton-James, C. (2008). On emotional innumeracy: Predicted and actual effective response to grand-scale tragedy. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 44, 692–698.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compassion fatigue===
The collapse of compassion may be linked to that of [[compassion fatigue]] as well. Individuals with a higher capacity or responsibility to empathize with others may be at risk for compassion fatigue or stress, which is related to professionals and individuals who spend a significant amount of time responding to information related to suffering, according to Figley.&lt;ref&gt;Figley, Charles (1995). Compassion Fatigue: Coping With Secondary Traumatic Stress Disorder In Those Who Treat The Traumatized. London: Brunner-Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0876307595}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, newer research by Singer and Ricard suggests that it is lack of suitable distress tolerance which gets people fatigued in compassion activities.&lt;ref&gt;Ricard, Matthieu (2015). "IV". Altruism: The Power of Compassion to Change Yourself and the World. Brown and Company. pp. 56–64. {{ISBN|978-0316208246}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research suggests that practice of nonjudgmental compassion can prevent fatigue and burnout.&lt;ref&gt;Differential pattern of functional brain plasticity after compassion and empathy training, Olga M. Klimecki, Susanne Leiberg, Matthieu Ricard, and Tania Singer, Department of Social Neuroscience, Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experiments==

'''Ka Ho Tam'''

Ka Ho Tam hired 242 undergrad students to participate in his  study, they read stories of people from different parts of the world who shared their experiences (e.g. having a family gathering) or specific to a particular culture (e.g. celebrating an Ethiopian festival). Thereafter participants of 1 to 8 poverty-stricken Ethiopian children, along with a description of how people from that part of Ethiopia are suffering. Lastly, these participants did questionnaires to measure similarity with and compassion toward the Ethiopian children. He found that, the reading of the shared experiences drew out compassion toward a single victim and not multiple victims. This can be further explained by saying that people actively suppress compassion when they think it might be overwhelming; this means that humans respond to the suffering of others based on their own self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tam|first1=K.H|title=The Collapse of Compassion|website=Northeastern University Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''C. Daryl Cameron and B. Keith Payne'''

Cameron and Payne's experiment tested whether removing a source of motivation to regulate would reduce the collapse of compassion.Other researchers like Kogut and Ritov and Small et al. who also did studies included measures of three alternative explanations for the collapse of compassion: psychological distance, [[diffusion of responsibility]], and success in helping the victims. People might experience less emotion toward multiple victims because they feel a greater psychological distance from these victims; because they feel less responsible for helping; or because they feel that their helping will not matter much. If these alternatives were to be eliminated however, these explanations would more support the financial cost as a critical factor in the collapse of compassion.

The nine items measuring compassion were averaged together. A two-way between-subjects analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to examine the effects of help request and number of victims on compassion. There were no significant main effects of help request, or number of victims. However, there was a significant interaction between help request and number of victims. The pattern of means for the interaction between compassion, help request, and number of victims was displayed, this interaction suggests that the difference in compassion toward one versus eight victims depended upon whether participants expected to be asked to help those victims. They probed the interaction by first examining the effect of the help request separately in the one-victim and eight-victim groups. In the one-victim condition, there was not a significant effect of help request on compassion. In the eight-victim condition, by contrast, participants reported significantly greater compassion when they would not be asked to help than when they would be asked to help. They also examined the effect of number of victims separately in the help-request and no-help-request conditions. When help was requested, participants reported numerically greater compassion toward a single victim than toward eight, although this simple effect was not significant. In contrast, when help was not requested, eight victims elicited significantly more compassion than one victim. By removing the expectation that participants would be asked to donate money, they were able to reverse the typical
collapse of compassion pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cameron|first1=Daryl C.|last2=Payne|first2=Keith B.|title=Escaping Affect: How Motivated Emotion Regulation Creates Insensitivity to Mass Suffering|publisher=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Copper deficiency'''  is defined either as insufficient [[copper]] to meet the needs of the body, or as a serum copper level below the normal range.&lt;ref name=scheiber&gt;{{cite book|first1= Ivo |last1= Scheiber|first2= Ralf|last2= Dringen|first3= Julian F. B.|last3= Mercer|first4=|last4=|editor=Astrid Sigel, Helmut Sigel and Roland K. O. Sigel|title=Interrelations between Essential Metal Ions and Human Diseases|series=Metal Ions in Life Sciences|volume=13|year=2013|publisher=Springer|pages=359–387|chapter=Chapter 11. Copper: Effects of Deficiency and Overload|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-7500-8_11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The neurodegenerative syndrome of copper deficiency has been recognized for some time in ruminant animals, in which it is commonly known as "[[swayback]]".&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /&gt; Copper deficiency can manifest in parallel with vitamin B12 and other nutritional deficiencies.&lt;ref name="Half" /&gt;

==Overview==
The most common cause of copper deficiency is a remote gastrointestinal surgery, such as [[gastric bypass surgery]], due to [[malabsorption]] of copper, or [[zinc toxicity]]. On the other hand, [[Menkes disease]] is a genetic disorder of copper deficiency involving a wide variety of symptoms that is often fatal.&lt;ref name="Kodama" /&gt;

Copper is involved in normalized function of many enzymes, such as [[cytochrome c oxidase]], which is complex IV in mitochondrial [[electron transport chain]], [[ceruloplasmin]], Cu/Zn [[superoxide dismutase]], and in [[amine oxidase]]s.&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /&gt;  These enzyme catalyze reactions for [[oxidative phosphorylation]], iron transportation, antioxidant and free radical scavenging and neutralization, and [[neurotransmitter]] synthesis, respectively.&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /&gt; A regular diet contains a variable amount of copper, but may provide 5&amp;nbsp;mg/day, of which only 20-50% is absorbed.&lt;ref name="Half" /&gt; The diet of the elderly may contain a lower copper content than the recommended daily intake.&lt;ref name="Half" /&gt; Dietary copper can be found in [[whole grain]] [[cereal]]s, [[legume]]s, [[oyster]]s, organ meats (particularly [[liver]]), [[cherries]], [[dark chocolate]], [[fruit]]s, leafy green vegetables, [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s, [[poultry]], [[prune]]s, and [[soybean]]s products like [[tofu]].&lt;ref name="Source" /&gt;

The deficiency in copper can cause many hematological manifestations, such as [[myelodysplasia]], [[anemia]], [[leukopenia|low white blood cell count]], and [[neutropenia|low count of neutrophils]](a type of white blood cell that is often called "the first line of defense" for the immune system).&lt;ref name="Half" /&gt; Copper deficiency has long been known for as a cause of myelodysplasia (when a blood profile has indicators of possible future [[leukemia]] development), but it was not until 2001 that copper deficiency was associated with neurological manifestations like [[sensory ataxia]] (irregular coordination due to [[Proprioception|proprioceptive]] loss), spasticity, muscle weakness, and more rarely visual loss due to [[peripheral neuropathy|damage in the peripheral nerves]], [[myelopathy]] (disease of the spinal cord), and rarely [[optic neuropathy]].

==Signs and symptoms==
===Blood symptoms===
[[File:Ring Sideroblast smear 2010-01-13.JPG|thumb|Ring Sideroblast smear 2010-01-13]]
The characteristic hematological (blood) effects of copper deficiency are [[anemia]] (which may be [[microcytic anemia|microcytic]], normocytic or [[macrocytic anemia|macrocytic]]) and [[neutropenia]].&lt;ref name="Klevay" /&gt; [[Thrombocytopenia]] (low blood [[platelets]]) is unusual.&lt;ref name="Half" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt;

The peripheral blood and [[Bone marrow examination|bone marrow aspirate]] findings in copper deficiency can mimic [[myelodysplastic syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Fong" /&gt; [[Bone marrow examination|Bone marrow aspirate]] in both conditions may show [[dysplasia]] of blood cell precursors and the presence of ring sideroblasts ([[erythroblast]]s containing multiple iron granules around the nucleus). Unlike most cases of [[myelodysplastic syndrome]], the bone marrow aspirate in copper deficiency characteristically shows cytoplasmic [[vacuoles]] within red and white cell precursors, and [[karyotyping]] in cases of copper deficiency does not reveal cytogenetic features characteristic of [[myelodysplastic syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Klevay" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt;

Anemia and neutropenia typically resolve within six weeks of copper replacement.&lt;ref name="Fong" /&gt;

===Neurological symptoms===
Copper deficiency can cause a wide variety of neurological problems including, [[myelopathy]], peripheral [[neuropathy]], and [[optic neuropathy]].&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt;

====Myelopathy====
Copper deficiency myelopathy in humans was discovered and first described by Schleper and Stuerenburg in 2001.&lt;ref name="Schleper" /&gt; They described a patient with a history of gastrectomy and partial colonic resection who presented with severe tetraparesis and painful paraesthesias and who was found on imaging to have dorsomedial cervical cord T2 hyperintensity. Upon further analysis, it was found that the patient had decreased levels of serum coeruloplasmin, serum copper, and CSF copper. The patient was treated with parenteral copper and the patient`s paraesthesias did resolve. Since this discovery, there has been heightened and increasing awareness of copper-deficiency myelopathy and its treatment, and this disorder has been reviewed by Kumar.
Sufferers typically present difficulty walking ([[gait]] difficulty) caused by [[sensory ataxia]] (irregular muscle coordination) due to [[dorsal column]] dysfunction&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; or degeneration of the spinal cord ([[myelopathy]]).&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jaiser, similar" /&gt; Patients with ataxic gait have problems balancing and display an unstable wide walk. They often feel tremors in their torso, causing side way jerks and lunges.&lt;ref name="Gait" /&gt;

In brain MRI, there is often an increased [[Magnetic resonance imaging#Contrast|T2]] signalling at the posterior columns of the spinal cord in patients with myelopathy caused by copper deficiency.&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MRI" /&gt; T2 signalling is often an indicator of some kind of neurodegeneration. There are some changes in the spinal cord MRI involving the thoracic cord, the cervical cord or sometimes both.&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; Copper deficiency myelopathy is often compared to [[subacute combined degeneration]] (SCD).&lt;ref name="Jaiser, similar" /&gt; [[Subacute combined degeneration]] is also a degeneration of the spinal cord, but instead [[vitamin B12]] deficiency is the cause of the spinal degeneration.&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /&gt; SCD also has the same high T2 signalling intensities in the posterior column as copper deficient patient in MRI imaging.&lt;ref name="MRI" /&gt;

====Peripheral neuropathy====
Another common symptom of copper deficiency is [[peripheral neuropathy]], which is numbness or tingling that can start in the extremities and can sometimes progress radially inward towards the torso.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pineles" /&gt; In an Advances in Clinical Neuroscience &amp; Rehabilitation (ACNR) published case report, a 69-year-old patient had progressively worsened neurological symptoms.&lt;ref name="Jaiser, masquerade" /&gt; These symptoms included  diminished upper limb reflexes with abnormal lower limb reflexes, sensation to light touch and pin prick was diminished above the waist, vibration sensation was lost in the sternum, and markedly reduced [[proprioception]] or sensation about the self’s orientation.&lt;ref name="Jaiser, masquerade" /&gt; Many people suffering from the neurological effects of copper deficiency complain about very similar or identical symptoms as the patient.&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pineles" /&gt; This numbness and tingling poses danger for the elderly because it increases their risk of falling and injuring themselves. Peripheral [[neuropathy]] can become very disabling leaving some patients dependent on wheel chairs or walking canes for mobility if there is lack of correct diagnosis. Rarely can copper deficiency cause major disabling symptoms. The deficiency will have to be present for an extensive amount of time until such disabling conditions manifest.

====Optic neuropathy====
Some patients suffering from copper deficiency have shown signs of vision and color loss.&lt;ref name="Pineles" /&gt; The vision is usually lost in the peripheral views of the eye.&lt;ref name="Pineles" /&gt; The bilateral vision loss is usually very gradual.&lt;ref name="Pineles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Spinazzi"/&gt; An [[optical coherence tomography]] (OCT) shows some nerve fiber layer loss in most patients, suggesting the vision loss and color vision loss was secondary to [[optic neuropathy]] or neurodegeneration.&lt;ref name="Pineles" /&gt;

== Causes ==
===Surgery===
[[Bariatric surgery]] is a common cause of copper deficiency.&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Klevay" /&gt; Bariatric surgery, such as [[gastric bypass surgery]], is often used for weight control of the morbidly obese. The disruption of the intestines and stomach from the surgery can cause absorption difficulties not only as regards copper, but also for iron and [[vitamin B12]] and many other nutrients.&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /&gt; The symptoms of copper deficiency myelopathy may take a long time to develop, sometimes decades before the [[myelopathy]] symptoms manifest.

===Zinc toxicity===
Increased consumption of [[zinc]] is another cause of copper deficiency.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt;  [[Zinc]] is often used for the prevention or treatment of common colds and [[sinusitis]] (inflammation of sinuses due to an infection), ulcers, [[sickle cell disease]], [[celiac disease]], memory impairment, and acne.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; Zinc is found in many common vitamin supplements and is also found in denture creams.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Spinazzi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hendra" /&gt; Recently, several cases of copper deficiency myeloneuropathy were found to be caused by prolonged use of denture creams containing high quantities of zinc.&lt;ref name="Spinazzi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hendra" /&gt;

Metallic zinc is the core of all United States currency coins, including copper coated pennies. People who ingest a large number of coins will have elevated zinc levels, leading to zinc-toxicity-induced copper deficiency and the associated neurological symptoms. This was the case for a 57-year-old woman diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]]. The woman consumed over 600 coins, and started to show neurological symptoms such as unsteady [[gait]] and mild [[ataxia]].&lt;ref name="Dawn" /&gt;

===Hereditary disorders===
[[File:Menkes disease4.jpg|thumb|Menkes disease showing symptoms of the sparse, steel colored "kinky hair" and paleness]]
[[Menkes disease]] is a congenital disease that is a cause of copper deficiency.&lt;ref name="Kodama" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaler" /&gt; Menkes disease is a hereditary condition caused by a defective gene involved with the metabolism of copper in the body.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; Menkes disease involves a wide variety of symptoms including floppy muscle tone, [[seizures]], abnormally low temperatures, and a peculiar steel color hair that feels very rough.&lt;ref name="Kodama" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaler" /&gt; Menkes disease is usually a fatal disease with most children dying within the first ten years of life.&lt;ref name="Kodama" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaler" /&gt;

===Other===
It is rarely suggested that excess iron supplementation causes copper deficiency [[myelopathy]].&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /&gt;
Another rarer cause of copper deficiency is [[Coeliac disease]], probably due to malabsorption in the intestines.&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /&gt;
Still, a large percentage, around 20%, of cases have unknown causes.&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
Copper functions as a prosthetic group, which permits electron transfers in key enzymatic pathways like the [[electron transport chain]].&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Half" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Katherine E. |last1=Vest|first2=Hayaa F.|last2=Hashemi|first3=Paul A.|last3=Cobine|editor1-first=Lucia (Ed.) |editor1-last=Banci |series=Metal Ions in Life Sciences |volume=12 |chapter= Chapter 13 The Copper Metallome in Eukaryotic Cells|title=Metallomics and the Cell |year=2013 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-007-5560-4|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-5561-10_12}} electronic-book {{ISBN|978-94-007-5561-1}} {{issn|1559-0836}} electronic-{{issn|1868-0402}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copper is integrated in the enzymes [[cytochrome c oxidase]], which is involved in [[cellular respiration]] and [[oxidative phosphorylation]], Cu/Zn dismutase, which is involved in [[antioxidant]] defense, and many more listed in the table below.&lt;ref name="Half" /&gt;

===Neurological===
[[File:Complex IV.svg|thumb|Cytochrome c Oxidase mechanism in mitochondrial membrane]]

====Cytochrome c oxidase====

There have been several hypotheses about the role of copper and some of its neurological manifestations. Some suggest that disruptions in [[cytochrome c oxidase]], also known as Complex IV, of the electron transport chain is responsible for the spinal cord degeneration.&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jaiser, similar" /&gt;

====Methylation cycle====
[[File:Myelinated neuron.jpg|thumb|Myelinated neuron]]
Another hypothesis is that copper deficiency myelopathy is caused by disruptions in the [[methylation]] cycle.&lt;ref name="Jaiser, similar" /&gt; The methylation cycle causes a transfer of a methyl group (-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) from [[methyltetrahydrofolate]] to a range of [[macromolecules]] by the suspected copper dependent enzyme [[methionine synthase]].&lt;ref name="Jaiser, similar" /&gt; This cycle is able to produce [[purines]], which are a component of DNA [[nucleotide bases]], and also [[myelin]] proteins.&lt;ref name="Jaiser, similar" /&gt; The spinal cord is surrounded by a layer of protective protein coating called myelin (see figure). When this methionine synthase enzyme is disrupted, the methylation decreases and myelination of the spinal cord is impaired. This cycle ultimately causes [[myelopathy]].&lt;ref name="Jaiser, similar" /&gt;

===Hematological cause===
====Iron transportation====
The [[anemia]] caused by copper deficiency is thought to be caused by impaired iron transport. [[Hephaestin]] is a copper containing [[ferroxidase]] enzyme located in the duodenal muscosa that oxidizes iron and facilitate its transfer across the basolateral membrane into circulation.&lt;ref name="Klevay" /&gt; Another iron transporting enzyme is [[ceruloplasmin]].&lt;ref name="Klevay" /&gt; This enzyme is required to mobilize iron from the reticuloendothelial cell to plasma.&lt;ref name="Klevay" /&gt;  Ceruloplasmin also oxidizes iron from its ferrous state to the ferric form that is required for iron binding.&lt;ref name="Kodama" /&gt; Impairment in these copper dependent enzymes that transport iron may cause the secondary iron deficiency anemia.&lt;ref name="Klevay" /&gt; Another speculation for the cause of anemia is involving the mitochondrial enzyme [[cytochrome c oxidase]] (complex IV in the electron transport chain). Studies have shown that animal models with impaired cytochrome c oxidase failed to synthesize [[heme]] from [[ferric]] iron at the normal rate.&lt;ref name="Klevay" /&gt; The lower rate of the enzyme might also cause the excess iron to clump, giving the heme an unusual pattern.&lt;ref name="Klevay" /&gt; This unusual pattern is also known as ringed [[sideroblastic]] anemia cells.

====Cell growth halt====
The cause of [[neutropenia]] is still unclear; however, the arrest of maturing [[myelocyte]]s, or [[neutrophil]] precursors, may cause the [[neutrophil]] deficiency.&lt;ref name="Half" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Klevay" /&gt;

====Zinc intoxication====
Zinc intoxication may cause [[anemia]] by blocking the absorption of copper from the stomach and [[duodenum]].&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /&gt; Zinc also upregulates the expression of [[chelator]] [[metallothionein]] in [[enterocytes]], which are the majority of cells in the intestinal epithelium.&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /&gt; Since copper has a higher affinity for metallothionein than zinc, the copper will remain bound inside the enterocyte, which will be later eliminated through the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]].&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /&gt; This mechanism is exploited therapeutically to achieve negative balance in [[Wilson’s disease]], which involves an excess of copper.&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /&gt;

==Diagnosis==
{{Empty section|date=November 2017}}

==Treatment==
Copper deficiency is a very rare disease and is often misdiagnosed several times by physicians before concluding the deficiency of copper through differential diagnosis (copper serum test and [[bone marrow biopsy]] are usually conclusive in diagnosing copper deficiency).  On average, patients are diagnosed with copper deficiency around 1.1 years after their first symptoms are reported to a physician.&lt;ref name="Jaiser, copper myelopathy" /&gt;
Copper deficiency can be treated with either oral copper supplementation or [[intravenous]] copper.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; If zinc intoxication is present, discontinuation of zinc may be sufficient to restore copper levels back to normal, but this usually is a very slow process.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; People who suffer from zinc intoxication will usually have to take copper supplements in addition to ceasing zinc consumption. Hematological manifestations are often quickly restored back to normal.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; The progression of the neurological symptoms will be stopped by appropriate treatment, but often with residual neurological disability.

The most recent study was DAHANCA 10 in 2007. DAHANCA 10 was a multicenter, [[double-blind]], randomized, [[placebo]]-controlled study on [[darbepoetin alpha|darbepoetin-α]] (Aranesp, [[Amgen]]). The data-monitoring committee recommended early termination of this trial as results were suggesting outcomes were more favourable in the control-group compared to patients receiving the drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/CDER/Offices/OODP/whatsnew/darbepoetin_alfa.htm |title=Results from a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study on Aranesp (darbepoetin alfa) |date=2007-02-22 |work=Office of Oncology Drug Products (OODP) |publisher=[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] |accessdate=2008-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007180027/http://www.fda.gov/CDER/Offices/OODP/whatsnew/darbepoetin_alfa.htm |archivedate=October 7, 2008 }}  &lt;/ref&gt;

'''David C. Lewis''' is Professor Emeritus of Medicine and Community Health and the Donald G. Millar Distinguished Professor of Alcohol and Addiction Studies at [[Brown University]].

He is Chairman of the Board of Directors of the [[United States]]' [[National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence]]. He serves on the Executive Committee and is former Executive Director of the [[Association for Medical Education and Research in Substance Abuse]], and is the founder and a member of the Board of Directors of [[Physicians and Lawyers for National Drug Policy]].

==Background==
Lewis earned his bachelor's degree ''[[Latin honors|magna cum laude]]'' from Brown University in 1957 and his medical degree at [[Harvard University]] in 1961. He specialized in internal medicine and later in treatment of alcoholism and addiction to other drugs.

He entered the field of addictions while an internal medicine resident at Boston's [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center|Beth Israel Hospital]], where he collaborated with famed Harvard psychiatrist [[Norman Zinberg]] on seminal work on heroin addiction (Zinberg &amp; Lewis, 1964; Lewis &amp; Zinberg, 1964). He later served from 1963-1964 as a health policy advisor to [[Cleveland]] mayor [[Dennis Kucinich]] and became a leading advocate for legalization of [[heroin maintenance]] programs (Lewis, 1964). From 1972 through 1979 he directed the Washingtonian Center for Addictions. He became Associate Clinical Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School in 1975. In 1976 he joined the Brown University faculty as an Associate Professor of Medicine and director of the Program in Alcoholism and Drug Abuse. He was named the Donald G. Millar Distinguished Scholar in Alcoholism Studies at Brown University in 1979 and chaired the Department of Community Health from 1981 through 1986. In 1982, he founded the Brown University Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies and was designated the Donald G. Millar Distinguished Professor of Alcohol and Addiction Studies as well as Professor of Medicine and Community Health. He directed the alcohol studies center for 18 years prior to his retirement. From 1990 through 1991 he was Scholar-in-Residence in the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]-[[Institute of Medicine]] in [[Washington, DC]].

In 1976, Lewis was one of the founders of the Association for Medical Education and Research in Substance Abuse (AMERSA). He served as President of AMERSA from 1983 through 1985 and became Executive Editor of AMERSA's peer-reviewed, quarterly journal Substance Abuse in 1984. From 1986 through 1995 he was director of AMERSA's National Office, which was located at Brown University.

Lewis and [[David F. Duncan|David Duncan]], in a presentation at the 1996 annual meeting of the [[American Public Health Association]], proposed that an alliance of health professionals could best bring about major reform of America's national drug policies. In 1997, he convened a meeting of 37 of the nation's leading physicians which adopted a policy statement declaring the "war on drugs" to be a failed approach and calling for adoption of an approach to drug abuse based on prevention and treatment rather than law enforcement. The group of physician leaders incorporated as Physician Leadership on National Drug Policy (PLNDP), with Lewis as its Project Director from 1997 through 2003. In 2004, the organization expanded its membership to include a number of leaders of the legal profession and became Physicians and Lawyers for National Drug Policy. Dr, Lewis continues to serve on PLNDP's Board of Directors. Lewis has been a leading spokesperson for harm reduction (Lewis, Duncan &amp; Clifford, 1997) and for the perspective that sees addiction as being a chronic disease like any other (Lewis, 1994; McLellan, Lewis, O'Brien, &amp; Kleber, 2000).

In 1996 Lewis delivered the Norman E. Zinberg Memorial Lecture at Cambridge Hospital/Harvard Medical School. He received the [[American Medical Association]]'s Education and Research Foundation Award in 1997 for outstanding contributions and leadership in championing the inclusion of alcohol and other drug problems into the mainstream of medical practice and medical education.  He received the Distinguished Contributions in the Addictions award from Harvard Medical School in 2002, and in 2004 he received the John P. McGovern Award and Lectureship from the [[American Society of Addiction Medicine]] for his contributions to the treatment of addictive disorders.

Despite the fame, Lewis still loves teaching the best.&lt;ref&gt;''Brown Daily Herald'', October 29, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''facial mask''' is a creamy or thick pasted mask applied to clean or smoothen the face. It often contains [[minerals]], [[vitamins]], and [[fruit extracts]], such as [[cactus]] and [[cucumber]]. There are different kinds of masks for different purposes; some are deep cleansing for cleaning the pores. The perceived effect of a facial mask treatment can be revitalizing, rejuvenating or refreshing.  Facial masks are most commonly used by women but are also used by men.

Some masks are washed off with tepid water, others are peeled off by hand. Duration for wearing a mask depends on type of mask, but can be three minutes to 30 minutes, and sometimes the whole night.

[[Honey]] is a very popular mask because it smooths skin, and cleans pores. A popular [[home remedy]] includes a slice of [[cucumber]] on the eyes.&lt;ref name="Loughran2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joni Loughran|title=Natural Skin Care|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FvAQqf02eHYC&amp;pg=PA113|year=2002|publisher=B.

Facial masks should be selected according to [[skin type]]. [[Clay]] and [[Peloid|mud masks]] suit [[oily skin]]; cream-based masks work best on [[dry skin]] types. Masks should be used after cleansing for better results. Firming masks should not be applied on the eye area because they can cause [[itch]]ing.&lt;ref name="ToedtKoza2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Toedt|author2=Darrell Koza|author3=Kathleen Van Cleef-Toedt|title=Chemical Composition of Everyday Products|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UnjD4aBm9ZcC&amp;pg=PA31|year=2005|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-32579-3|pages=31–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16576">The '''Feldenkrais Method''' is a type of [[exercise therapy]] devised by [[Moshé Feldenkrais]] (1904–1984).  The method is claimed to reorganize connections between the brain and body and so improve body movement and psychological state.&lt;ref name=ehm/&gt;

There is no good [[evidence-based medicine|medical evidence]] that the Feldenkrais method confers any health benefits, and it is not known if it is safe or cost-effective,&lt;ref name=aus17/&gt; even though it is hard to conceive of serious risks.&lt;ref name="Corgi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=S|last2=Ernst|first2=E|title=Trick or Treatment? Alternative Medicine on Trial|date=2009|publisher=Corgi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness and reception==
In 2015, the [[Department of Health (Australia)|Australian Government's Department of Health]] published the results of a review of alternative therapies that sought to determine if any were suitable for being covered by [[health insurance]]; the Feldenkrais Method was one of 17 therapies evaluated for which no clear evidence of effectiveness was found.&lt;ref name=aus17&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/0E9129B3574FCA53CA257BF0001ACD11/$File/Natural%20Therapies%20Overview%20Report%20Final%20with%20copyright%2011%20March.pdf |publisher=Australian Government &amp;ndash; Department of Health |format=PDF |author=Baggoley C |title=Review of the Australian Government Rebate on Natural Therapies for Private Health Insurance |year=2015 |laysummary=https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/australian-review-finds-no-benefit-to-17-natural-therapies |lay-source=Gavura, S. Australian review finds no benefit to 17 natural therapies. Science-Based Medicine. |lay-date=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly in 2017 the Australian government named  the Feldenkrais Method as a practice that would not qualify for insurance subsidy, saying this step would "ensure taxpayer funds are expended appropriately and not directed to therapies lacking evidence".&lt;ref name=nosubsidy&gt;{{cite web |title=Homeopathy, naturopathy struck off private insurance list |author=Paola S |year=17 October 2017 |journal=Australian Journal of Pharmacy |url=https://ajp.com.au/news/homeopathy-naturopathy-struck-off-private-insurance-list/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not known whether the Feldenkrais method is safe or cost-effective,&lt;ref name=aus17/&gt; though according to Ernst and Singh's overview of alternative medicine "there are no conceivable serious risks".&lt;ref name="Corgi"/&gt;

[[David Gorski]] has written that the Method bears similarities to [[faith healing]], is like "glorified [[yoga]]" and that it "borders on [[quackery]]".&lt;ref name=gorski/&gt;

== Description ==
The Feldenkrais Method is a type of alternative exercise therapy that proponents claim can repair impaired connections between the [[motor cortex]] and the body, so benefiting the quality of body movement and improving [[wellbeing]].&lt;ref name=ehm&gt;{{cite book |editors=Stalker D, Glymour C |page=373 |year=1989 |publisher=Prometheus Books |title=Examining Holistic Medicine |isbn=9780879755539 |quote=a system of exercise therapy developed in the 1940s by former judo instructor Moshe Feldenkrais}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Feldenkrais Guild of North America claims that the Feldenkrais method allows people to "rediscover [their] innate capacity for graceful, efficient movement" and that "These improvements will often generalize to enhance functioning in other aspects of [their] life".&lt;ref name=gorski&gt;{{cite web |author=Gorski D |authorlink=David Gorski |publisher=Scienceblogs&amp;mdash;Respectful Insolence |title=M.D. Anderson enters the blogosphere–and goes woo |date=6 August 2009 |url=http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/05/md-anderson-enters-the-blogosphere-and-g/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents claim that the Feldenkrais Method can benefit people with a number of medical conditions, including children with [[autism]], and people with [[multiple sclerosis]].&lt;ref name=autism-claim&gt;{{cite web |title=How the Feldenkrais Method can Benefit Children with Autism |publisher=Feldenkrais Educational Foundation of North America |author=Adams A |date=30 April 2015 |url=http://www.feldenkrais.com/article_content.asp?edition=1&amp;section=9&amp;article=294 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918103015/http://www.feldenkrais.com/article_content.asp?edition=1&amp;section=9&amp;article=294 |archivedate=18 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ms-claim&gt;{{cite web |title=Maintaining Mobility:The Feldenkrais Method and Multiple Sclerosis |date=15 June 2015 |author=Dillon S |url=http://www.feldenkrais.com/article_content.asp?edition=1&amp;section=23&amp;article=44 |publisher=Feldenkrais Educational Foundation of North America |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918085542/http://www.feldenkrais.com/article_content.asp?edition=1&amp;section=23&amp;article=44 |archivedate=18 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a session, a Feldenkrais practitioner directs attention to habitual movement patterns that are thought to be inefficient or strained, and attempts to teach new patterns using gentle, slow, repeated movements.&lt;ref name= "Levine"&gt;{{cite book |last= Levine |first= Andrew |year= 1998 |title= The Bodywork and Massage Sourcebook |publisher= [[Lowell House]] |pages= 249–60 |isbn= 9780737300987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slow repetition is believed to be necessary to impart a new habit and allow it to begin to feel normal.&lt;ref name= "Knaster"&gt;{{cite book |last= Knaster |first= Mirka |year= 1996 |title= Discovering the Body's Wisdom: A Comprehensive Guide to More Than Fifty Mind-Body Practices |publisher= [[Bantam Books|Bantam]] |pages= 232–8 |isbn= 9780307575500}}&lt;/ref&gt; These movements may be passive (performed by the practitioner on the recipient's body) or active (performed by the recipient). The recipient is fully clothed.&lt;ref name=Levine /&gt;

== History ==
Similar to some other somatic methods, such as those started by [[F. Matthias Alexander]], [[Elsa Gindler]], and [[Gerda Alexander]], the Feldenkrais Method originated in the efforts of its founder to work with his own bodily problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Don Hanlon|title=Bone, Breath, and Gesture: Practices of Embodiment|date=1995|publisher=North Atlantic Books|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=1556432011|page=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Moshé Feldenkrais, it was a chronically injured knee.

Feldenkrais first injured his knee while playing soccer in British-controlled Palestine in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=Reese&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reese|first1=Mark|title=Moshe Feldenkrais: A Life in Movement|date=2015|publisher=ReeseKress Somatics Press|location=San Rafael, California|isbn=978-0-9855612-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82}} He reinjured it while negotiating the slippery decks of submarines while working as a scientist at the British Naval station at [[Fairlie, North Ayrshire]], Scotland during the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Doidge|first1=Norman|title=The Brain's Way of Healing|date=2015|publisher=Viking|location=New York|isbn=978-0-14-312837-3|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feldenkrais was by that time a Judo teacher and had mostly completed the work toward a D.Sc. under the guidance of Nobel laureate [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie]].&lt;ref name=Reese/&gt;{{rp|208}} Facing the prospect of a surgery that could leave him with a life-long limp, Feldenkrais decided to apply the knowledge gained from his study of physics, engineering, and martial arts to an intensive self-study of his own movement habits. When his work provided him with relief, allowing him to avoid the knee surgery, he began exploring the methods he developed on himself with a small group of people at Fairlie, including scientific colleague [[John Desmond Bernal]] and [[John Boyd-Orr]], Nobel laureate and first president of the World Academy of Art and Science.&lt;ref name="Elusive Obvious"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feldenkrais|first1=Moshe|title=The Elusive Obvious|date=1981|publisher=Meta Publications|location=Capitola, California|isbn=978-0-916990-09-1|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After serving as head of electronic engineering for the Israeli Army in newly formed Israel from 1951 to 1953, Feldenkrais devoted the rest of his life, from age 50 onward, to developing and teaching self-awareness through movement lessons.&lt;ref name= "Claire"&gt;{{cite book |last= Claire |first= Thomas |year= 1995 |title= Bodywork: What Type of Massage to Get and How to Make the Most of It |publisher= [[William Morrow and Co.]] |pages= 75–88 |isbn= 9781591201656}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Hanna, "Moshe Feldenkrais"'&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hanna|first1=Thomas|title="Moshe Feldenkrais", in ''Explorers of Humankind''|date=1979|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-06-250375-8|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1950s till his death in 1984, he taught continuously in his home city of Tel Aviv. Feldenkrais gained recognition in part through media accounts of his work with prominent individuals, including Israeli Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]].&lt;ref name="Ben Gurion's Personal Trainer"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lori|first1=Aviva|title=Ben Gurion's Personal Trainer|url=http://www.haaretz.com/ben-gurion-s-personal-trainer-1.124885|website=Haaretz.com|publisher=Haaretz|accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feldenkrais Biography-First Chapter"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buckard|first1=Christian|title=Feldenkrais Biography-First Chapter|url=http://www.feldenkrais-biographie.de/buch-news/english/|website=feldenkrais-biographie|accessdate=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the late 1950s, Feldenkrais made trips to teach in Europe and America. Several hundred people became certified Feldenkrais practitioners through trainings he held in San Francisco from 1975 to 1978 and in Amherst, Massachusetts from 1980 to 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keller|first1=Jon|last2=Freer|first2=Bonnie|title=His Methods May Seem Bizarre, But Thousands Swear by Mind-Body Guru Moshe Feldenkrais|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20080162,00.html|website=people.com|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anticipating the need for an institutional structure to carry on his teaching, he helped found the Feldenkrais Guild of North America in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hanna|first1=Thomas|title="Moshe Feldenkrais" in Explorers of Humankind|date=1979|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=San Francisco, California|isbn=0-06-250375-8|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feldenkrais developed the conceptual framework of his method in part through the publication of six books, beginning with ''Body and Mature Behavior'' (1949) and ending with the posthumously published ''The Potent Self'' (1985).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moshe Feldenkrais Bibliography|url=http://www.feldenkraismethod.com/articles/moshe-feldenkrais-bibliography|website=Dr. Moshe Feldenkrais – His Life and Work|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Feldenkrais' death, the international Feldenkrais community has used a guild structure to regulate its activity, with training accreditation boards in the Americas, Europe, and Australasia overseeing guilds and associations in eighteen member countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Member Organizations|url=http://feldenkrais-method.org/iff/member-organizations/|website=International Feldenkrais Federation|accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Feldenkrais Journal'', the annual publication of the Feldenkrais Guild of North America, serves as a forum for the Feldenkrais community to discuss the method and its applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Feldenkrais Journal|url=http://www.feldenkrais.com/the-feldenkrais-journal|website=Feldenkrais Guild of North America|accessdate=4 June 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160524124542/http://www.feldenkrais.com/the-feldenkrais-journal|archivedate=24 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the Feldenkrais Method was influenced by Moshe Feldenkrais's involvement in the martial arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marlock|first1=Gustl|title=The Handbook of Body Psychotherapy and Somatic Psychology|date=2015|publisher=North Atlantic Books|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=9781583948415|page=876|url=https://www.northatlanticbooks.com/shop/the-handbook-of-body-psychotherapy-and-somatic-psychology/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reese/&gt;{{rp|71}} After meeting [[Kano Jigoro]], the founder of Judo, while living in Paris in the 1930s, Feldenkrais transitioned to that practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buchanan|first1=Patricia|title="The Feldenkrais Method® of Somatic Education"|url=http://www.intechopen.com/books/a-compendium-of-essays-on-alternative-therapy/the-feldenkrais-method-of-somatic-education|website=A Compendium of Essays on Alternative Therapy|publisher=InTech|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main influences of judo on the Feldenkrais Method is the differentiation between rote exercise and attentive movement: "the methods of physical exercise in vogue&amp;nbsp;... exert only the muscles without any other goal, and one needs much will to bind oneself unfailingly to one of these methods", wrote Feldenkrais in 1952. "Judo is very different, each movement has a specific goal which is reached after a precise and supple execution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feldenkrais|first1=Moshe|title=A.B.C. du Judo: Jiu-Jitsu|date=1952|publisher=Chiron|location=France}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before he focused on the creation of his own method, Feldenkrais influenced the teaching of martial arts in Western Europe through the publication of five books on jiujitsu and judo, as well as teaching at practice centers in France and Great Britain.&lt;ref name=Reese/&gt;{{rp|211–212}}

Feldenkrais was born into an Hasidic family and community, and he acknowledged the influence of Hasidic Judaism on his method.&lt;ref name=Reese/&gt;{{rp|7}} In his 2007 book, ''Making Connections: Roots and Resonance in the Life of Moshe Feldenkrais'', David Kaetz argued that there are many lines of influence to be found between the Judaism of Feldenkrais's upbringing and the Feldenkrais Method – for instance, the use of paradox as a pedagogical tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaetz|first1=David|title=Making Connections: Roots and Resonance in the Life and Teachings of Moshe Feldenkrais|date=2014|publisher=River Centre Publishing|location=Hornby Island, Canada|isbn=978-0-9784014-2-9|pages=13–15, 27–28|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feldenkrais also acknowledged the influence of the Russian spiritualist [[George Gurdjieff]] on his work, in particular Gurdjieff's teachings on automatism and freedom in embodiment.&lt;ref name=Reese/&gt;{{rp|430–444}}

Feldenkrais earned his doctorate in a program at the Sorbonne intended to bridge theoretical physics and industrial engineering.&lt;ref name=Reese/&gt;{{rp|128–129}} Feldenkrais's biographer, Mark Reese, argues that Feldenkrais brought this emphasis on practical scientific inquiry to the understanding of embodiment expressed through his method: "Feldenkrais was critical of the appropriation of the term 'energy' to express immeasurable phenomena or to label experiences that people had trouble describing", notes Reese. "He was impatient when someone invoked energy in pseudoscientific 'explanations' that masked a lack of understanding. In such cases he urged skepticism and scientific discourse. He encouraged empirical and phenomenological narratives that could lead to insights."&lt;ref name=Reese/&gt;{{rp|117}} Feldenkrais incorporated the views of other scientists into his teaching; for instance, he asked questions of both the neurosurgeon [[Karl H. Pribram]] and the cyberneticist [[Heinz von Foerster]] at trainings in San Francisco in the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feldenkrais|first1=Moshe|title=The Elusive Obvious|date=1981|publisher=Meta Publications|location=Capitola, California|isbn=0-916990-09-5|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reese/&gt;{{rp|329–330}} [[Cybernetics]], also known as dynamic systems theory, continued to influence the Feldenkrais Method in the 1990s through the work of human development researcher [[Esther Thelen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buchanan|first1=Patricia|title=The Feldenkrais Method® of Somatic Education|url=http://www.intechopen.com/books/a-compendium-of-essays-on-alternative-therapy/the-feldenkrais-method-of-somatic-education|website=Intechopen.com|publisher=InTech|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Felix-Kersten-1920.jpg|thumb|right|Felix Kersten ca. 1920.]]
'''Eduard Alexander Felix Kersten''' (30 September 1898 – 16 April 1960) was before and during [[World War II]] the personal [[physical therapy|physical therapist]] of [[Heinrich Himmler]]. Kersten used his contacts with Himmler to help people persecuted by [[Nazi Germany]].

==Early life==
Kersten was born in a [[Baltic German]] family in [[Tartu]] ([[Dorpat]]), [[Imperial Russia]], now called [[Tartu]], in [[Estonia]]. During the [[World War I|First World War]] he fought in the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] and arrived in Finland in April 1918 with the German forces that intervened in the [[Finnish Civil War]]. Kersten served for a while in [[Suojeluskunta]], was granted Finnish citizenship in 1920, and in September 1921 was commissioned as a [[2nd Lieutenant]] (''[[vänrikki]]'') into the [[Finnish Army]].

After his return to civilian life, Kersten remained in [[Helsinki]], where he studied [[therapy]] with the specialist Dr Colander, and after two years was awarded a certificate in physical therapy. He then left for Berlin, where he continued his studies and eventually became the pupil of a notable Chinese therapeutic [[massage|masseur]], Dr Ko,&lt;ref&gt;John H. Waller, ''Felix Kersten and the Secret Plot to Turn Himmler Against Hitler'' (2002), pp.9-10&lt;/ref&gt; whom he had met at a dinner party. In 1925, Ko told Kersten "You have learned all I can teach you."  He then turned his practice over to Kersten and retired to [[Tibet]].

Kersten had a number of influential patients, among them [[Hendrik of the Netherlands|Prince Hendrik of the Netherlands]] (after 1928) and [[Benito Mussolini]]’s son-in-law, the Italian [[Foreign Minister]] [[Galeazzo Ciano|Count Ciano]]. Kersten accepted [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s request to become his personal physical therapist, writing later that he feared for his safety if he had refused.

He was able to alleviate Himmler’s severe stomach pains with his skills and gained his trust. Kersten used this trust to obtain pardons and the release of underground prisoners, labor camp inmates, homosexuals and others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/himmler-s-healer-how-the-ss-chief-physiotherapist-saved-jewish-lives-1.5766993 Himmler's healer: The story of Felix Kersten, [[Haaretz]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the War, Kersten also provided information to the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]], predecessor of the [[CIA]].

Towards the end of the War, Kersten arranged a meeting between Himmler and [[Norbert Masur]], a member of the Swedish branch of the [[World Jewish Congress]], in [[Hartzwalde]], a few miles from [[Ravensbrück concentration camp]]. As a result, Himmler agreed to spare the lives of the remaining 60,000 Jews left in Nazi concentration camps days before their liberation by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].

In December 1945, the World Jewish Congress presented Kersten with a letter thanking him for helping to save Jewish concentration camp victims.

==After the war==
[[File:Felix Kersten (1948).jpg|thumb|Kersten (1948).]]
In his post-war memoirs Kersten takes credit for saving, among others, the whole Dutch people from forced deportation to Nazi-occupied Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name=Ilan&gt;{{cite book | author = Amitzur Ilan | title = Bernadotte in Palestine | year = 1989 | publisher = St Martin's Press | pages = 40–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1950, the Dutch monarchy awarded him the [[Order of Orange-Nassau]] on this account.&lt;ref name=Ilan/&gt; However a later investigation by Dutch historian [[Louis de Jong]] concluded that the mass deportation plan had not existed and that many of Kersten's documents were fabricated.&lt;ref&gt;Louis de Jong, 1972, "Hat Kersten Das Niederlandische Volk Gerretted?". Reprinted in German translation: H-H. Wilhelm and L. de Jong. Zwei Legenden aus dem dritten Reich: quellenkritische Studien, Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt 1974, pp 79–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swedish archives testify that Kersten was intermediary between Himmler and [[Count]] [[Folke Bernadotte]] in the negotiations that led to the rescue operation '[[White Buses|The White Buses]]', saving hundreds of Norwegians and Danes from certain death in the last days of the [[Third Reich]].

Kersten’s claims of being instrumental in saving [[History of the Jews in Finland|Finland’s Jews]] from German hands may be exaggerated, but the Finnish government did use his services in the hope of influencing Himmler.

After the War, Kersten lived in West Germany and Sweden, taking Swedish citizenship in 1953.  He died in [[Hamm]], while visiting Germany, aged 61.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bbld.de/0000000109602890 Kersten, Eduard Alexander Felix.] BBLD – Baltisches Biographisches Lexikon Digital.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kersten's war memoirs were published in English translation in 1947 and a second edition was published in 1956 (''The Kersten memoirs, 1940–1945'', London 1956) with an introduction by [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]].

==In popular culture==
Writer and journalist [[Joseph Kessel]] was the first to write about the life of Felix Kersten, in his book ''The man with the miraculous hands ''(1960).

Felix Kersten is parodied in the [[Woody Allen]] book ''[[Getting Even (Woody Allen)|Getting Even]]'', in the chapter entitled "The Schmeed Memoirs", in which a fictional barber in wartime Germany describes his time as a hair stylist for [[Adolf Hitler]] and other high-ranking [[Nazi]] officers.

Kersten also appears as a character in the film [[Hitler: A Film from Germany|''Hitler: a film from Germany'']], directed by [[Hans-Jürgen Syberberg]] and as the main character in the 2014 novel ''Gods and Devils''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morgan |first=Jason |date=2014 |title=Gods and Devils |url= |location=Australia |publisher=JJ&amp;C Corporation |page= |isbn=978-0-9925468-0-9 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=27 August 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Kersten is played by actor [[Martin Jarvis (actor)|Martin Jarvis]] in the radio play by [[Neville Watchurst]] ''A Vital Flaw'', about his work to help Heinrich Himmler's health. The play was first broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]] on 5 September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00mj27x | title=Neville Watchurst – A Vital Flaw | publisher=BBC | date=June 12, 2011 | accessdate=March 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Flynn effect''' is the substantial and long-sustained increase in both [[fluid and crystallized intelligence]] test scores that was measured in many parts of the world over the [[20th century]].&lt;ref name=baker&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Baker |first=David P. |last2=Eslinger |first2=Paul J. |last3=Benavides |first3=Martin |last4=Peters |first4=Ellen |last5=Dieckmann |first5=Nathan F. |last6=Leon |first6=Juan |date=March 2015 |title=The cognitive impact of the education revolution: A possible cause of the Flynn Effect on population IQ |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0160289615000082 |journal=Intelligence |volume=49 |pages=144–158 |doi=10.1016/j.intell.2015.01.003 |issn=0160-2896}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ) tests are initially [[Standard score#Standardizing in mathematical statistics|standardized]] using a [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] of test-takers, by convention the average of the test results is set to 100 and their [[standard deviation]] is set to 15 or 16 IQ points. When IQ tests are revised, they are again standardized using a new sample of test-takers, usually born more recently than the first. Again, the average result is set to 100. However, when the new test subjects take the older tests, in almost every case their average scores are significantly above 100.

Test score increases have been continuous and approximately linear from the earliest years of testing to the present. For the [[Raven's Progressive Matrices]] test, a study published in the year 2009 found that British children's average scores rose by 14 IQ points from 1942 to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Flynn |first=James R. |date=2009-3 |title=Requiem for nutrition as the cause of IQ gains: Raven's gains in Britain 1938-2008 |journal=Economics and Human Biology |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=18–27 |doi=10.1016/j.ehb.2009.01.009 |issn=1873-6130 |pmid=19251490}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar gains have been observed in many other countries in which IQ testing has long been widely used, including other [[Western Europe]]an countries, [[Japan]], and [[South Korea]].&lt;ref name=baker/&gt;

The Flynn effect is named for [[James Flynn (academic)|James R. Flynn]], who did much to document it and promote awareness of its implications. The term itself was coined by [[Richard Herrnstein]] and [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray]], authors of ''[[The Bell Curve]]''.&lt;ref name=Flynn&gt;{{Cite book|author=Flynn, James R. |title=What Is Intelligence: Beyond the Flynn Effect |edition=expanded paperback |location=Cambridge |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-74147-7 |year=2009 |laysummary=http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/reviews/flynn-beyond/ |laydate=July 18, 2010 |pages=1–2 |quote=The 'Flynn effect' is the name that has become attached to an exciting development, namely, that the twentieth century saw massive IQ gains from one generation to another.

Data from revisions of various intelligence tests in the United States as well as in other countries—extensively analyzed by J.R. Flynn (1984, 1987)—show a pronounced, longterm upward trend in the level of performance required to obtain any given IQ score. The Flynn effect presumably reflects population gains over time in the kinds of cognitive performance that intelligence tests sample. |laysummary=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471419788.html |laydate=10 October 2013 |ref=harv}} {{cite book |last=Wasserman |first=John D. |editor1-last=Weiner |editor1-first=Irving B. |editor2-last=Graham |editor2-first=John R. |editor3-last=Naglieri |editor3-first=Jack A. |title=Handbook of Psychology |volume=Volume 10: Assessment Psychology |url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470891270.html |accessdate=25 November 2013 |chapter=Chapter 18: Assessment of Intellectual Functioning |date=2 October 2012 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-470-89127-8 |page=486 |quote=Both definitions also specify that the intellectual functioning criterion for a diagnosis of intellectual disability is approximately 2 ''SD''s or more below the normative mean, but factors such as test score statistical error (standard error of measurement), test fairness, normative expectations for the population of interest, the Flynn effect, and practice effects from previous testing need to be considered before arriving at any diagnosis. |ref=harv}} {{cite book |last=Chamorro-Premuzic |first=Tomas |authorlink=Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic |title=Personality and Individual Differences |url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP001535.html |accessdate=15 June 2014 |date=13 June 2011|publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-1-4051-9927-8 |page=221 |quote='''Flynn effect''' The finding by sociologist James Flynn that there are generational increases in IQ across nations. |laysummary=|laydate= |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise in IQ==
IQ tests are updated periodically. For example, the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children]] (WISC), originally developed in 1949, was updated in 1974, in 1991, 2003 and again in 2014. The revised versions are [[standardized]] based on the performance of test-takers in standardization samples. A standard score of IQ 100 is defined as the median performance of the standardization sample. Thus one way to see changes in norms over time is to conduct a study in which the same test-takers take both an old and new version of the same test. Doing so confirms IQ gains over time. Some IQ tests, for example tests used for military draftees in [[NATO]] countries in Europe, report raw scores, and those also confirm a trend of rising scores over time. The average rate of increase seems to be about three IQ points per decade in the United States, as scaled by the Wechsler tests. The increasing test performance over time appears on every major test, in every age range, at every ability level, and in every modern industrialized country, although not necessarily at the same rate as in the United States. The increase was continuous and roughly linear from the earliest days of testing to the mid 1990s.&lt;ref name="Neisser97"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Neisser U |title=Rising Scores on Intelligence Tests |journal=American Scientist |volume=85 |issue=5 |pages=440–7 |year=1997 |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/rising-scores-on-intelligence-tests/99999 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104214157/http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/rising-scores-on-intelligence-tests/99999 |archivedate=November 4, 2016 |df=mdy-all |bibcode=1997AmSci..85..440N }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=November 2017}} Though the effect is most associated with IQ increases, a similar effect has been found with increases in attention and of [[Semantic memory|semantic]] and [[episodic memory]].&lt;ref name="Rönnlund"/&gt;

[[Ulric Neisser]] estimated that using the IQ values of 1997, the average IQ of the United States in 1932, according to the first [[Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales]] standardization sample, was 80. Neisser states that "Hardly any of them would have scored 'very superior', but nearly one-quarter would have appeared to be 'deficient.'" He also wrote that "Test scores are certainly going up all over the world, but whether intelligence itself has risen remains controversial."&lt;ref name="Neisser97"/&gt;

Trahan et al. (2014) found that the effect was about 2.93 points per decade, based on both Stanford–Binet and Wechsler tests; they also found no evidence the effect was diminishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trahan|first1=LH|last2=Stuebing|first2=KK|last3=Fletcher|first3=JM|last4=Hiscock|first4=M|title=The Flynn effect: a meta-analysis.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=September 2014|volume=140|issue=5|pages=1332–60|doi=10.1037/a0037173|pmid=24979188|pmc=4152423}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Pietschnig &amp; Voracek (2015) reported, in their meta-analysis of studies involving nearly 4 million participants, that the Flynn effect had decreased in recent decades. They also reported that the magnitude of the effect was different for different types of intelligence ("0.41, 0.30, 0.28, and 0.21 IQ points annually for fluid, spatial, full-scale, and crystallized IQ test performance, respectively"), and that the effect was stronger for adults than for children.&lt;ref name="Pietschnig"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Jakob Pietschnig |last2=Martin Voracek |date=2015-05-01 |title=One Century of Global IQ Gains: A Formal Meta-Analysis of the Flynn Effect (1909–2013) |journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science |language=en |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=282–306 |doi=10.1177/1745691615577701 |pmid=25987509 |issn=1745-6916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raven (2000) found that, as Flynn suggested, data interpreted as showing a decrease in many abilities with increasing age must be re-interpreted as showing that there has been a dramatic increase of these abilities with date of birth. On many tests this occurs at all levels of ability.&lt;ref name=R2000&gt;{{cite journal | author = Raven John | year = 2000 | title = The Raven's Progressive Matrices: Change and Stability over Culture and Time | url = http://eyeonsociety.co.uk/resources/RPMChangeAndStability.pdf | journal = Cognitive Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = 1| pages = 1–48 | doi = 10.1006/cogp.1999.0735 | pmid = 10945921 | bibcode = 1992CogPs..24..535V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies have found the gains of the Flynn effect to be particularly concentrated at the lower end of the distribution. Teasdale and Owen (1989), for example, found the effect primarily reduced the number of low-end scores, resulting in an increased number of moderately high scores, with no increase in very high scores.&lt;ref name=TO1987&gt;{{Cite journal| pmc = | pmid =   | doi = 10.1016/0160-2896(89)90021-4 | last1 = Teasdale | first1 = T. | title = Continuing secular increases in intelligence and a stable prevalence of high intelligence levels | journal = Intelligence | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 255–262 | year = 1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, two large samples of Spanish children were assessed with a 30-year gap. Comparison of the IQ distributions indicated that the mean IQ-scores on the test had increased by 9.7 points (the Flynn effect), the gains were concentrated in the lower half of the distribution and negligible in the top half, and the gains gradually decreased as the IQ of the individuals increased.&lt;ref name="Colom2005"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://synapse.princeton.edu/~brained/chapter15/colom_andres-pueyo05_intelligence_Spanish-schoolchildren-nutrition-hypothesis.pdf | title=The generational intelligence gains are caused by decreasing variance in the lower half of the distribution: Supporting evidence for the nutrition hypothesis |author1=Colom, R. |author2=Lluis-Font, J.M. |author3= Andrés-Pueyo, A. |last-author-amp=yes | journal=Intelligence | year=2005 | volume=33 | issue=1 | pages=83–91 | doi=10.1016/j.intell.2004.07.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have found a reverse Flynn effect with declining scores for those with high IQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dutton Edward |author2=Lynn Richard | year = 2013 | title = A negative Flynn effect in Finland, 1997–2009 | url = | journal = Intelligence | volume = 41 | issue = 6| pages = 817–820 | doi=10.1016/j.intell.2013.05.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pietschnig" /&gt;

In 1987, Flynn took the position that the very large increase indicates that IQ tests do not measure intelligence but only a minor sort of "abstract problem-solving ability" with little practical significance. He argued that if IQ gains do reflect intelligence increases, there would have been consequent changes of our society that have not been observed (a presumed non-occurrence of a "cultural renaissance").&lt;ref name="Neisser97"/&gt; Flynn no longer endorses this view{{clarify|date=March 2017}} of intelligence and has since elaborated and refined his view of what rising IQ scores mean.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

===Precursors to Flynn's publications===

Earlier investigators had discovered rises in raw IQ test scores in some study populations, but had not published general investigations of that issue in particular. Historian Daniel C. Calhoun cited earlier psychology literature on IQ score trends in his book ''The Intelligence of a People'' (1973).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Calhoun |first=Daniel |title=The Intelligence of a People  |date=1973 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-04619-8 |quote= |laysummary=http://www.tcrecord.org/library/abstract.asp?contentid=1297 |laydate=6 October 2013 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; R. L. Thorndike drew attention to rises in Stanford-Binet scores in a 1975 review of the history of intelligence testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Thorndike |first=R. L. |title=Mr. Binet's Test 70 Years Later |journal=Educational Researcher |volume=4 |issue=5 |year=1975 |pages=3–7 |issn=0013-189X |doi=10.3102/0013189X004005003 |jstor=1174855 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intelligence===
{{See also|g factor (psychometrics)|Fluid and crystallized intelligence}}

There is debate about whether the rise in IQ scores also corresponds to a rise in general intelligence, or only a rise in special skills related to taking IQ tests. Because children attend school longer now and have become much more familiar with the testing of school-related material, one might expect the greatest gains to occur on such school content-related tests as [[vocabulary]], [[arithmetic]] or general information. Just the opposite is the case: abilities such as these have experienced relatively small gains and even occasional decreases over the years. Meta-analytic findings indicate that Flynn effects occur for tests assessing both fluid and crystallized abilities. For example, Dutch conscripts gained 21 points during only 30 years, or 7 points per decade, between 1952 and 1982.&lt;ref name="Neisser97"/&gt; But this rise in IQ test scores is not wholly explained by an increase in general intelligence. Studies have shown that while test scores have improved over time, the improvement is not fully correlated with latent factors related to intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Must O, Must A, Raudik V | year = 2003 | title = The secular rise in IQs: In Estonia, the Flynn effect is not a Jensen effect | journal = Intelligence | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | pages = 461–471 | doi = 10.1016/S0160-2896(03)00013-8 | url=http://www.iapsych.com/iqmr/fe/LinkedDocuments/Must2003.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[J.

==Proposed explanations==
{{See also|Impact of health on intelligence}}

A 2017 survey of 75 experts in the field of intelligence research suggested four key causes of the Flynn effect: Better health, better nutrition, more and better education, and rising standards of living. Genetic changes were seen as not important.&lt;ref&gt;Rinderman, et al., 2017. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2016.10.061&lt;/ref&gt; The experts' views agreed with an independently performed&lt;ref&gt;According to Rinderman et al., chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; meta-analysis on published Flynn effect data, except that the latter found [[life history theory|life history speed]] to be the most important factor.&lt;ref&gt;Pietschnig and Voracek, 2015. https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691615577701&lt;/ref&gt;

The expert survey explained the possible end or decline in the Flynn effect by asymmetric fertility by means of genetic effects, migration, asymmetric fertility by means of socialization effects, declines in education, and the influence of media.

===Schooling and test familiarity===
Duration of average schooling has increased steadily. One problem with this explanation is that if in the US comparing older and more recent subjects with similar educational levels, then the IQ gains appear almost undiminished in each such group considered individually.&lt;ref name="Neisser97"/&gt;

Many studies find that children who do not attend school score drastically lower on the tests than their regularly attending peers. During the 1960s, when some [[Virginia]] counties [[Massive resistance|closed their public schools to avoid racial integration]], compensatory private schooling was available only for Caucasian children. On average, the scores of African-American children who received no formal education during that period decreased at a rate of about six IQ points per year.&lt;ref name="Neisser97"/&gt;

Another explanation is an increased familiarity of the general population with tests and testing. For example, children who take the very same IQ test a second time usually gain five or six points. However, this seems to set an upper limit on the effects of test sophistication. One problem with this explanation and others related to schooling is that in the US, the groups with greater test familiarity show smaller IQ increases.&lt;ref name="Neisser97"/&gt;

[[Early intervention]] programs have shown mixed results. Some preschool (ages 3–4) intervention programs like "[[Head Start Program|Head Start]]" do not produce lasting changes of IQ, although they may confer other benefits.{{which|date=July 2014}} The "[[Abecedarian Early Intervention Project]]", an all-day program that provided various forms of [[Environmental enrichment (neural)|environmental enrichment]] to children from infancy onward, showed IQ gains that did not diminish over time. The IQ difference between the groups, although only five points, was still present at age 12. Not all such projects have been successful.&lt;ref name="Neisser97"/&gt; Also, such IQ gains can diminish until age 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Plomin R. |author2=DeFries J.C. |author3=Craig I.W. |author4=McGuffin P. |title=Behavioral genetics in the postgenomic era |year=2003 |edition=4th }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing a high correlation between rising literacy rates and gains in IQ, [[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]] has argued that the Flynn effect is caused by changes in literacy rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2466/pr0.106.3.643-664 |author=David F Marks|title=IQ variations across time, race, and nationality:an artifact of differences in literacy skills|journal=Psychological Reports|volume=106 |issue=3|pages=643–664|year=2010 |pmid=20712152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generally more stimulating environment===
Still another theory is that the general environment today is much more complex and stimulating. One of the most striking 20th century changes of the human intellectual environment has come from the increase of exposure to many types of [[visual media]]. From pictures on the wall to movies to television to video games to computers, each successive generation has been exposed to richer optical displays than the one before and may have become more adept at visual analysis. This would explain why visual tests like the Raven's have shown the greatest increases. An increase only of particular form(s) of intelligence would explain why the Flynn effect has not caused a "cultural renaissance too great to be overlooked."&lt;ref name="Neisser97"/&gt;

In 2001, Dickens and Flynn presented a model for resolving several contradictory findings regarding IQ. They argue that the measure "[[heritability]]" includes both a direct effect of the [[genotype]] on IQ and also indirect effects such that the genotype changes the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]], thereby affecting IQ. That is, those with a greater IQ tend to seek stimulating environments that further increase IQ. These reciprocal effects result in [[gene environment correlation]]. The direct effect could initially have been very small, but [[feedback]] can create large differences of IQ. In their model, an environmental stimulus can have a very great effect on IQ, even for adults, but this effect also decays over time unless the stimulus continues (the model could be adapted to include possible factors, like nutrition during early childhood, that may cause permanent effects). The Flynn effect can be explained by a generally more stimulating environment for all people. The authors suggest that any program designed to increase IQ may produce long-term IQ gains if that program teaches children how to replicate the types of cognitively demanding experiences that produce IQ gains outside the program. To maximize lifetime IQ, the programs should also motivate them to continue searching for cognitively demanding experiences after they have left the program.&lt;ref name=Dickens01&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.2.346 |vauthors=Dickens WT, Flynn JR |title=Heritability estimates versus large environmental effects: The IQ paradox resolved |journal=Psychological Review |volume=108 |issue=2 |pages=346–369 |year=2001 |pmid=11381833 |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/files/u81/Dickens_and_Flynn__2001_.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.139.2436 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Dickens WT, Flynn JR |title=The IQ Paradox: Still Resolved |journal=Psychological Review |volume=109 |issue=4 |year=2002 |url=http://www.brookings.edu/views/papers/dickens/20020205.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1037/0033-295x.109.4.764 |pages=764–771 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319031706/http://www.brookings.edu/views/papers/dickens/20020205.pdf |archivedate=March 19, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flynn in his 2007 book ''[[What Is Intelligence?]]'' further expanded on this theory. Environmental changes resulting from modernization&amp;nbsp;— such as more intellectually demanding work, greater use of technology and smaller families&amp;nbsp;— have meant that a much larger proportion of people are more accustomed to manipulating abstract concepts such as hypotheses and categories than a century ago. Substantial portions of IQ tests deal with these abilities. Flynn gives, as an example, the question 'What do a dog and a rabbit have in common?' A modern respondent might say they are both mammals (an abstract, or ''a priori'' answer, which depends only on the meanings of the words 'dog' and 'rabbit' ), whereas someone a century ago might have said that humans catch rabbits with dogs (a concrete, or ''a posteriori'' answer, which depended on what happened to be the case at that time).

===Nutrition===
Improved nutrition is another possible explanation. Today's average adult from an industrialized nation is taller than a comparable adult of a century ago. That increase of stature, likely the result of general improvements of nutrition and health, has been at a rate of more than a centimeter per decade. Available data suggest that these gains have been accompanied by analogous increases of head size, and by an increase in the average size of the brain.&lt;ref name="Neisser97"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jantz |first=R. |last2=Meadows Jantz |first2=L. |year=2000 |title=Secular change in craniofacial morphology |journal=American Journal of Human Biology |volume=12 |issue= 3|pages=327–338 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1520-6300(200005/06)12:3&lt;327::AID-AJHB3&gt;3.0.CO;2-1 |pmid=11534023}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument had been thought to suffer the difficulty that groups who tend to be of smaller overall body size (e.g. women, or people of Asian ancestry) do not have lower average IQs.&lt;ref name=TO1987/&gt; [[Richard Lynn]], however, claims that while people of East Asian origin may often have smaller bodies, they tend to have larger brains and higher IQs than average whites.&lt;ref name=Lynn&gt;Lynn, Richard (2006). Race Differences in Intelligence. An Evolutionary Analysis. Washington Summit Publishers, Augusta, GA, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 study presented data supporting the nutrition hypothesis, which predicts that gains will occur predominantly at the low end of the IQ distribution, where nutritional deprivation is probably most severe.&lt;ref name="Colom2005"/&gt; An alternative interpretation of [[skewed]] IQ gains could be that improved education has been particularly important for this group.&lt;ref name=TO1987/&gt; [[Richard Lynn]] makes the case for nutrition, arguing that cultural factors cannot typically explain the Flynn effect because its gains are observed even at infant and preschool levels, with rates of IQ test score increase about equal to those of school students and adults. Lynn states that "This rules out improvements in education, greater test sophistication, etc. and most of the other factors that have been proposed to explain the Flynn effect. He proposes that the most probable factor has been improvements in pre-natal and early post-natal nutrition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lynn, Richard |title=What has caused the Flynn effect?

A century ago, [[micronutrient|nutritional]] deficiencies may have limited body and organ functionality, including skull volume. The first two years of life is a critical time for nutrition. The consequences of malnutrition can be irreversible and may include poor cognitive development, educability, and future economic productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Lancet Series on Maternal and Child Undernutrition |year=2008 |url=http://www.thelancet.com/series/maternal-and-child-undernutrition}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Flynn has pointed to 20-point gains on Dutch military ([[Raven's Progressive Matrices|Raven's]] type) IQ tests between 1952, 1962, 1972, and 1982. He observes that the Dutch 18-year-olds of 1962 had a major nutritional handicap. They were either in the womb, or were recently born, during the great [[Dutch famine of 1944]]&amp;nbsp;– when German troops monopolized food and 18,000 people died of starvation.&lt;ref&gt;C. Banning (1946). Food Shortage and Public Health, First Half of 1945. Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science Vol. 245, The Netherlands during German Occupation (May, 1946), pp. 93–110&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, concludes Flynn, "they do not show up even as a blip in the pattern of Dutch IQ gains.

In support of the nutritional hypothesis, it is known that, in the United States, the average height before 1900 was about 10&amp;nbsp;cm (∼4&amp;nbsp;inches) shorter than it is today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Samaras |first1=Thomas T. |last2=Elrick |first2=Harold |date=May 2002 |title=Group Height, body size, and longevity: is smaller better for the human body? |journal=West J Med |volume=176 |issue=3 |pages=206–208 |pmc=1071721 |pmid=12016250 |doi=10.1136/ewjm.176.3.206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly related to the Flynn effect is a similar change of [[cranial vault|skull]] size and shape during the last 150 years. Though the idea that brain size is unrelated to race and intelligence was popularized in the 1980s, studies continue to show significant correlations.&lt;ref name=Lynn /&gt;
A Norwegian study found that height gains were strongly correlated with intelligence gains until the cessation of height gains in military conscript cohorts towards the end of the 1980s.&lt;ref name="doi10.1016/j.intell.2004.06.004"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.intell.2004.06.004| pmc = | pmid =   | last1 = Sundet | first1 = J. | last2 = Barlaug | first2 = D. | last3 = Torjussen | first3 = T. | journal = Intelligence | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 349–362 |title=The end of the Flynn effect?: A study of secular trends in mean intelligence test scores of Norwegian conscripts during half a century| year = 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both height and skull size increases probably result from a combination of [[phenotypic plasticity]] and genetic [[Selection (biology)|selection]] over this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jantz RL, Meadows Jantz L |title=Secular change in craniofacial morphology |journal=Am.

It is well known that [[micronutrient]] deficiencies change the development of intelligence. For instance, one study has found that [[iodine deficiency]] causes a fall, on average, of 12 IQ points in [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Qian M |title=The effects of iodine on intelligence in children: a meta-analysis of studies conducted in China |journal=Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=32–42 |year=2005 |pmid=15734706|author2=Wang D|author3=Watkins WE|display-authors=3|last4=Gebski|first4=V|last5=Yan|first5=YQ|last6=Li|first6=M|last7=Chen|first7=ZP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists James Feyrer, Dimitra Politi, and David N. Weil have found in the U.S. that the proliferation of iodized salt increased IQ by 15 points in some areas. Journalist Max Nisen has stated that, with this type of salt becoming popular, that "the aggregate effect has been extremely positive."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/iodization-effect-on-iq-2013-7#ixzz2ZuFjmyY7&lt;/ref&gt;

Daley et al. (2003) found a significant Flynn effect among children in rural [[Kenya]], and concluded that nutrition was one of the hypothesized explanations that best explained their results (the others were parental literacy and family structure).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Daley|first1=TC|last2=Whaley|first2=SE|last3=Sigman|first3=MD|last4=Espinosa|first4=MP|last5=Neumann|first5=C|title=IQ on the rise: the Flynn effect in rural Kenyan children.|journal=Psychological Science|date=May 2003|volume=14|issue=3|pages=215–9|pmid=12741743|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.02434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infectious diseases===
Eppig, Fincher, and Thornhill (2009) argue that "From an energetics standpoint, a developing human will have difficulty building a brain and fighting off [[infectious disease]]s at the same time, as both are very metabolically costly tasks" and that "the Flynn effect may be caused in part by the decrease in the intensity of infectious diseases as nations develop." They suggest that improvements in [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), education, literacy, and nutrition may have an effect on IQ mainly through reducing the intensity of infectious diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eppig C, Fincher CL, Thornhill R |title=Parasite prevalence and the worldwide distribution of cognitive ability |journal=Proc. Biol. Sci. |volume=277 |issue=1701 |pages=3801–8 |date=December 2010 |pmid=20591860 |pmc=2992705 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2010.0973 |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=20591860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eppig, Fincher, and Thornhill (2011) in a similar study instead looking at different US states found that states with a higher prevalence of infectious diseases had lower average IQ. The effect remained after controlling for the effects of wealth and educational variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Eppig | first1 = C. | last2 = Fincher | first2 = C.

Atheendar Venkataramani (2010) studied the effect of [[malaria]] on IQ in a sample of Mexicans. Exposure during the birth year to malaria eradication was associated with increases in IQ. It also increased the probability of employment in a skilled occupation. The author suggests that this may be one explanation for the Flynn effect and that this may be an important explanation for the link between national malaria burden and economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Venkataramani, Atheendar |title=Early Life Exposure to Malaria and Cognition and Skills in Adulthood: Evidence from Mexico |date=September 18, 2010 |ssrn=1679164}}&lt;/ref&gt; A literature review of 44 papers states that cognitive abilities and school performance were shown to be impaired in sub-groups of patients (with either cerebral malaria or uncomplicated malaria) when compared with healthy controls. Studies comparing cognitive functions before and after treatment for acute malarial illness continued to show significantly impaired school performance and cognitive abilities even after recovery. Malaria [[prophylaxis]] was shown to improve cognitive function and school performance in clinical trials when compared to placebo groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fernando SD, Rodrigo C, Rajapakse S |title=The 'hidden' burden of malaria: cognitive impairment following infection |journal=Malar.

===Heterosis===
[[Heterosis]], or hybrid vigor associated with historical reductions of the levels of inbreeding, has been proposed by Michael Mingroni as an alternative explanation of the Flynn effect. However, James Flynn has pointed out that even if everyone mated with a sibling in 1900, subsequent increases in heterosis would not be a sufficient explanation of the observed IQ gains.&lt;ref&gt;Mackintosh, N.J. (2011). ''IQ and Human Intelligence''. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible end of progression==

Jon Martin Sundet and colleagues (2004) examined scores on intelligence tests given to [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[conscripts]] between the 1950s and 2002. They found that the increase of scores of general intelligence stopped after the mid-1990s and declined in numerical reasoning sub-tests.&lt;ref name="doi10.1016/j.intell.2004.06.004"/&gt;

Teasdale and Owen (2005) examined the results of IQ tests given to [[Denmark|Danish]] male conscripts. Between 1959 and 1979 the gains were 3 points per decade. Between 1979 and 1989 the increase approached 2 IQ points. Between 1989 and 1998 the gain was about 1.3 points. Between 1998 and 2004 IQ declined by about the same amount as it gained between 1989 and 1998. They speculate that "a contributing factor in this recent fall could be a simultaneous decline in proportions of students entering 3-year advanced-level school programs for 16–18-year-olds."&lt;ref name="Teasdale2005"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Teasdale TW, Owen DR|year=2005|title=A long-term rise and recent decline in intelligence test performance: The Flynn Effect in reverse|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=39|issue=4|pages=837–843|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.01.029}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same authors in a more comprehensive 2008 study, again on Danish male conscripts, found that there was a 1.5-point increase between 1988 and 1998, but a 1.5-point decrease between 1998 and 2003/2004. A possible contributing factor to the more recent decline may be changes in the Danish educational system. Another may be the rising proportion of immigrants or their immediate descendants in Denmark. This is supported by data on Danish draftees where first or second generation immigrants with Danish nationality score below average.&lt;ref name = "reversal"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.intell.2007.01.007 |vauthors=Teasdale TW, Owen DR |title=Secular declines in cognitive test scores: A reversal of the Flynn Effect |journal=Intelligence |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=121–6 |year=2008 |url=http://www.iapsych.com/iqmr/fe/LinkedDocuments/teasdale2008.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, the IQ of 6–11 year olds as measured by the [[Raven's Progressive Matrices|Colored Progressive Matrices]] has shown no increase from 1975–2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Cotton | first1= S. M.| last2= Kiely| first2= P. M.|last3= Crewther|first3= D. P.|last4= Thomson, |first4= B.|last5= Laycock|first5= R.|last6= Crewther|first6= S. G. |year=2005|title= A normative and reliability study for the Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices for primary school aged children in Australia|journal= Personality and Individual Differences|volume= 39| issue= 3|pages= 647–660| doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2005.02.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, a study by Flynn (2009) found that tests carried out in 1980 and again in 2008 show that the IQ score of an average 14-year-old dropped by more than two points over the period. For the upper half of the results the performance was even worse. Average IQ scores declined by six points. However, children aged between five and 10 saw their IQs increase by up to half a point a year over the three decades. Flynn argues that the abnormal drop in British teenage IQ could be due to youth culture having “stagnated” or even dumbed down. He also states that the youth culture is more oriented towards computer games than towards reading and holding conversations. Researcher Richard Gray, commenting on the study, also mentions the computer culture diminishing reading books as well as a tendency towards [[teaching to the test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=British teenagers have lower IQs than their counterparts did 30 years ago |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/4548943/British-teenagers-have-lower-IQs-than-their-counterparts-did-30-years-ago.html |publisher=The Telegraph |date=February 7, 2009 | location=London | first=Richard | last=Gray}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="requiem"&gt;{{Cite journal| pmc = | doi = 10.1016/j.ehb.2009.01.009 | pmid =   19251490| last1 = Flynn | first1 = J. R. | title = Requiem for nutrition as the cause of IQ gains: Raven's gains in Britain 1938–2008 | journal = Economics &amp; Human Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 18–27 | year = 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynn and Harvey argued in 2008 that the causes of the above are difficult to interpret since these countries had had significant recent immigration from countries with lower average national IQs. Nevertheless, they expect that similar patterns will occur, or have occurred, first in other developed nations and then in the developing world as there is a limit to how much environmental factors can improve intelligence. Furthermore, during the last century there is a negative correlation between [[fertility and intelligence]] although there is not yet any conclusive evidence of the association between the two. They estimate that there has been a [[dysgenic]] decline in the world's [[genotypic]] IQ (masked by the Flynn effect for the [[phenotype]]) of 0.86 IQ points per decade for the years 1950–2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lynn |first=Richard |last2=Harvey |first2=John |date=March 2008 |title=The decline of the world's IQ |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0160289607000463 |journal=Intelligence |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=112–120 |doi=10.1016/j.intell.2007.03.004 |issn=0160-2896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bratsberg &amp; Rogeberg (2018) present evidence that the Flynn effect in Norway has reversed, and that both the original rise in mean IQ scores and their subsequent decline were caused by environmental factors.&lt;ref name=pnas2018/&gt;

==IQ group differences==
{{see also|Nations and intelligence|Race and intelligence|Sex differences in intelligence}}
If the Flynn effect has ended in developed nations, then this may possibly allow [[Nations and intelligence|national differences in IQ scores]] to diminish if the Flynn effect continues in nations with lower average national IQs.&lt;ref name = "reversal" /&gt;

Also, if the Flynn effect has ended for the majority in developed nations, it may still continue for minorities, especially for groups like immigrants where many may have received poor nutrition during early childhood or have had other disadvantages. A study in the [[Netherlands]] found that children of non-Western immigrants had improvements for ''g'', educational achievements, and work proficiency compared to their parents, although there were still remaining differences compared to ethnic Dutch.&lt;ref name=Nijenhuis04/&gt;

There is a controversy as to whether the [[Race and intelligence|US racial gap in IQ scores]] is diminishing. If that is the case then this may or may not be related to the Flynn effect. Flynn has commented that he never claimed that the Flynn effect has the same causes as the black-white gap, but that it shows that environmental factors can create IQ differences of a magnitude similar to the gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| pmc = | pmid =   | doi = 10.1016/j.intell.2010.05.001 | last1 = Flynn | first1 = J. R. | title = The spectacles through which I see the race and IQ debate| journal = Intelligence | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 363–366 | year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research that has examined whether [[G factor (psychometrics)|g factor]] and IQ gains from the Flynn effect are related have found there is a negative correlation between the two, which may indicate that group differences and the Flynn effect are possibly due to differing causes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.intell.2013.03.001| title = Is the Flynn effect on g?: A meta-analysis| year = 2013| last1 = Nijenhuis | first1 = J.|last2 = van der Flierb | first2 = H.| journal = Intelligence| volume = 41| issue = 6| pages = 802–807 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Flynn effect has also been part of the discussions regarding [[Spearman's hypothesis]], which states that differences in the [[G factor (psychometrics)|g factor]] are the major source of differences between blacks and whites observed in many studies of race and intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.54.1.5| title = Searching for justice: the discovery of IQ gains over time| year = 1999| last1 = Flynn | first1 = J.

'''Generation Scotland''' is a [[Biobank]], a resource of biological samples and information on health and lifestyle from thousands of volunteer donors in [[Scotland]].

The aim of Generation Scotland is to create an ethically sound, family- and population-based infrastructure to identify the genetic basis of common complex diseases.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news|title=Study to follow Scotland's health|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4671078.stm|newspaper=BBC|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Generation Scotland concept has been evolving for several years (see [[Generation Scotland#Timeline|Timeline]]), and now involves three complementary projects, the Scottish Family Health Study GS:SFHS, Genetic Health in the 21st Century GS:21CGH and the Donor DNA Databank GS:3D. Together these projects have recruited a cohort of over 30,000 people.

Generation Scotland is establishing multi-disciplinary skills networks in genetic epidemiology, statistical genetics and health informatics. Social scientists have been involved from the start, conducting a public consultation process&lt;ref name="Public Consultation"&gt;{{cite news|title=Public Consultation|url=http://generationscotland.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=18&amp;Itemid=39|date=2002–2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and addressing ethical, legal and social issues. The output from these projects will be of value to the biomedical, sociomedicolegal, healthcare and bioindustry sectors.

__TOC__

==Background==
The main focus of Generation Scotland is on identifying the inherited factors, or [[genes]], that influence our risk of being affected by a number of common causes of ill health, including [[heart disease]], [[diabetes]], [[mental illness]], [[obesity]], stroke and diseases of the [[bone disease|bones]] and [[arthritis|joints]]. Our genes also influence [[pharmacogenetics|how we respond to different medicines]]. The basic idea behind Generation Scotland is that by comparing the genes in large groups of people (such as patients and healthy people, or people who respond well to a medicine and people who do not) researchers will be able to work out which genetic factors contribute to our chances of becoming unwell or of suffering from drug-related [[adverse effect|side-effects]].

Common disorders such as [[heart disease]] and [[diabetes]] are significant causes of [[chronic (medicine)|chronic ill health]] and death in middle-aged people.&lt;ref name="Lopez"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lopez AD, Mathers CD, Ezzati M, Jamison DT, Murray CJ |title=Global and regional burden of disease and risk factors, 2001: systematic analysis of population health data |journal=Lancet |volume=367 |issue=9524 |pages=1747–57 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16731270 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68770-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adverse reactions to prescription drugs delay recovery and drain healthcare resources.&lt;ref name="Kongkaew"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kongkaew C, Noyce PR, Ashcroft DM |title=Hospital admissions associated with adverse drug reactions: a systematic review of prospective observational studies |journal=The Annals of Pharmacotherapy |volume=42 |issue=7 |pages=1017–25 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18594048 |doi=10.1345/aph.1L037}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generation Scotland is therefore addressing issues of major [[public health]] importance.

Disease risk and drug response are examples of [[complex traits]]. Instead of having a single cause, complex traits typically result from a combination of factors including genes, environment and lifestyle ([[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[tobacco smoking|smoking]] history, [[physical exercise|exercise]] patterns, use of other medicines etc.).&lt;ref name="Lango"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lango H, Weedon MN |title=What will whole genome searches for susceptibility genes for common complex disease offer to clinical practice? |journal=Journal of Internal Medicine |volume=263 |issue=1 |pages=16–27 |date=January 2008 |pmid=18088250 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2796.2007.01895.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until very recently there was no efficient way of systematically searching for the genetic factors that underlie complex diseases. However the completion of the [[Human Genome Project]], coupled with technological advances that allow [[SNP genotyping|rapid comparison of thousands of DNA samples]], means that the necessary methods are now available.&lt;ref name="Lango" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirschhorn"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hirschhorn JN, Daly MJ |title=Genome-wide association studies for common diseases and complex traits |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=95–108 |date=February 2005 |pmid=15716906 |doi=10.1038/nrg1521}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detection of the relevant genetic factors depends on statistical analysis of data obtained by comparing the DNA of people with and without a particular trait (cases and controls, respectively). This is a powerful approach which has already yielded considerable success.&lt;ref name="WTCCC"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Genome-wide association study of 14,000 cases of seven common diseases and 3,000 shared controls |journal=Nature |volume=447 |issue=7145 |pages=661–78 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17554300 |doi=10.1038/nature05911 |pmc= 2719288 |author= The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium }}&lt;/ref&gt; However thousands of individuals must be recruited for such [[case-control studies]] to generate meaningful results and this is often beyond the means of smaller research groups.

Generation Scotland has put in place the considerable infrastructure required to recruit the necessary numbers of participants, to collect, process and securely store the associated biological samples and data, and to make these available to the wider research community. Scientists who are planning research into the causes or treatments of common complex diseases and who have appropriate approval from a [[Institutional Review Board|Research Ethics Committee]] can apply to use the resource in accordance with Generation Scotland's Access Policy. All data generated in this way will be fed back to Generation Scotland and will in turn form part or the resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GENERATION SCOTLAND LEGAL AND ETHICAL ASPECTS Graeme Laurie and Johanna Gibson, September 2003|url=http://www2.law.ed.ac.uk/ahrc/files/71_gslawandethicsfullreport03.pdf|publisher=Edinburgh University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
Generation Scotland is funded by
* a Strategic Research Development Grant of £1.79m from the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (2003)
* a Genetics in Healthcare Initiative grant of £4.4m from the Scottish Government Health Directorates (2004)
* a grant of £170,209 from the Chief Scientist Office Biomedical and Therapeutic Research Committee (now the Experimental and Translational Medicine (ETM) Research Committee) (2004)
* a grant of £3.8m from the Scottish Government Health Directorates (2008)

==Collaborators==

Generation Scotland is a multi-institution, cross-disciplinary collaboration involving
* the people of Scotland
* the Scottish University Medical Schools
** [[University of Aberdeen]]
** [[University of Dundee]]
** [[University of Edinburgh]]
** [[University of Glasgow]]
* the [[Information Services Division]] of [[NHS National Services Scotland]]
* the MRC Human Genetics Unit, Edinburgh
* the MRC Social and Public Health Science Unit, Glasgow
* [[NHS Scotland]]
* the [http://www.sspc.ac.uk/ Scottish School of Primary Care]
* the [http://www.wtcrf.ed.ac.uk/ Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility, Edinburgh]
* [[UK Biobank]]

==Projects==
Generation Scotland involves several disciplines including medicine, science, education and social science. This is reflected by the diversity of projects in the Generation Scotland portfolio:
*[http://www.ed.ac.uk/generation-scotland/using-resources/resources/scottish-family-health-study Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS)]
*[http://www.ed.ac.uk/generation-scotland/using-resources/resources/genetic-health-21st-century Genetic Health in the 21st Century (GS:21CGH)]
*[http://www.ed.ac.uk/generation-scotland/using-resources/resources/donor-dna-databank Donor DNA Databank (GS:3D)]
*Public Consultation

===Public consultation===
Public involvement is essential for the overall success of any [[Biobank]] and therefore one of the first Generation Scotland projects to get underway was a programme of [[public consultation]]. The aim of the programme is to foster a relationship of trust between potential participants and scientists and to understand and explain public reaction to a wide range of relevant issues including genetics in healthcare, the use of bioinformation, and concerns surrounding consent and confidentiality.&lt;ref name="Haddow"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09581590701824086 |title=Generation Scotland: consulting publics and specialists at an early stage in a genetic database's development |year=2008 |author=Haddow, Gill |journal=Critical Public Health |volume=18 |pages=139–149 |last2=Cunningham-Burley |first2=Sarah |last3=Bruce |first3=Ann |last4=Parry |first4=Sarah |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information technology and research infrastructure===
Biobank projects require considerable infrastructure to ensure that samples and data gathered from volunteers at the various recruitment centres are collected efficiently, processed and stored securely, and analysed effectively. Generation Scotland has designed protocols to standardise and integrate all stages of the process from volunteer recruitment to data handling.&lt;ref name="Macleod"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Macleod AK, Liewald DC, McGilchrist MM, Morris AD, Kerr SM, Porteous DJ |title=Some principles and practices of genetic biobanking studies |journal=The European Respiratory Journal |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=419–25 |date=February 2009 |pmid=19181915 |doi=10.1183/09031936.00043508}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a customised [[Laboratory Information Management System]] (LIMS) is being used to track samples as they move from the clinics to the Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility, Edinburgh for processing and storage, and then on to the research laboratories for analysis.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13338">'''Jean-Christophe Lafaille''' (31 March 1965 – 27 January 2006 [presumed]) was a [[France|French]] [[mountaineer]] noted for a number of difficult ascents in the [[Alps]] and [[Himalaya]], and for what has been described as "perhaps the finest self-rescue ever performed in the Himalaya",&lt;ref name="GO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greatoutdoors.com/published/death-on-makalu |title=Death on Makalu|accessdate=2008-04-23 |last=Roberts |first=David |date=16 October 2006 |work=www.greatoutdoors.com |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he was forced to descend the mile-high south face of [[Annapurna]] alone with a broken arm, after his climbing partner had been killed in a fall. He climbed eleven of the fourteen [[Eight-thousander|eight-thousand-metre peaks]], many of them alone or by previously unclimbed routes, but disappeared during a solo attempt to make the first winter ascent of [[Makalu]], the world's fifth highest mountain.
[[File:Lafaille.gif|thumb|right|Jean-Christophe Lafaille and [[David Callaway]] at [[Shishapangma]] base camp]] 

==Early career==
Born in [[Gap, Hautes-Alpes]], Lafaille's background was in [[sport climbing]], and as a teenager he climbed extensively at [[Céüse]] and played a part in turning it into one of the world's best known climbing venues. In 1989 he became the first Frenchman to [[Free solo climbing|solo]] a climb [[Grade (climbing)|graded]] 7c+, and one of the first to climb 8c graded routes.&lt;ref name="Wells"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/jeanchristophe-lafaille-465996.html |title=Jean-Christophe Lafaille |accessdate=2008-04-23 |last=Wells |first=Colin |date=9 February 2006 |work=[[The Independent]] |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421180100/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/jeanchristophe-lafaille-465996.html |archivedate=21 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, Lafaille qualified as a [[mountain guide]] and began mountaineering in the Alps. He made a number of difficult ascents on the [[Mont Blanc]] massif, including the first  solo climb of ''Divine Providence'' on the [[Grand Pilier d'Angle]], one of the hardest routes on the massif.&lt;ref name="MEnet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mounteverest.net/news.php?id=1483 |title=Jean-Christophe Lafaille: Bound to climb |accessdate=2008-04-24 |last= |first= |date=31 January 2006 |work=mounteverest.net |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-rescue on Annapurna==
[[Image:Annapurna South Face.jpg|thumb|right|The South Face of Annapurna]]
On the strength of his climbs in the Alps, Lafaille was invited on an expedition to [[Annapurna]] by [[Pierre Béghin]], one of the leading French climbers of the day. The pair attempted the mountain's vast South Face following the monsoon season in October 1992 in [[Alpine style]], with no [[Sherpa people|Sherpa]] support, pre-stocked campsites or [[fixed rope]]s on the upper mountain. They had reached a height of 7,400 metres when bad weather forced them to descend.&lt;ref name="Wells"/&gt; The pair made a series of [[Abseiling|abseils]] down the face, but due to their lightweight approach they had little [[Climbing equipment#Protection devices|protective equipment]] and were often forced to abseil from a single [[Anchor (climbing)|anchor]] to conserve equipment. On the fourth or fifth abseil, Beghin fell to his death when the single [[Spring-loaded camming device|cam]] he was using as an anchor became dislodged from the rock. Beghin had been carrying most of the pair's technical equipment, including all the ropes, and Lafaille was left alone on the face, a vertical mile above safety.&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7977242_ITM |title=The prisoner of Annapurna.(Jean-Christophe Lafaille)(Biography) |accessdate=2008-04-23 |last=Roberts |first=David |date=1 February 2003 |work=National Geographic Adventure |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503110355/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7977242_ITM |archivedate= 3 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With great difficulty, Lafaille managed to climb down the 75 [[degree (angle)|degree]] face to the pair's last [[Bivouac shelter|bivouac]] site, where he found 20 metres of thin rope, allowing him to make short abseils down some of the hardest parts. With no technical equipment to use as anchors he was forced to entrust his weight to [[tent peg]]s or, on one occasion, a plastic bottle. He finally reached what should have been the relative safety of the top of a fixed rope which he and Beghin had installed on a steep rock band, but almost immediately he was struck by a falling rock, which broke his right arm. Disabled and helpless, he lay on a ledge for two days in the hope that other climbers would rescue him. However, while there was a [[Slovenia]]n team attempting a route on a different part of the South Face, they judged that a rescue attempt would be too dangerous to undertake, so help never came. The cruellest thing about the ordeal, Lafaille said, was being able to see life in the valley below, and by night, the flashbulbs of [[hiking|trekkers']] cameras. In spite of this, he later agreed that the Slovenians had made the right decision in not trying to save him.&lt;ref name="Roberts"/&gt;

Eventually, with all hope of rescue gone, Lafaille resolved to continue down alone. He initially tried to continue [[abseiling]], but unable to control the rope with only one hand and his teeth he reverted to downclimbing one-handed, and was utterly exhausted when he reached the Slovenian team's base camp.&lt;ref name="Roberts"/&gt; By that time the climbers at the base of the mountain had given up hope for him, and his first wife, Véronique, had already been told that he had died.&lt;ref name="Douglas"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/feb/18/guardianobituaries.france |title=Jean-Christophe Lafaille |accessdate=2008-04-23 |last=Douglas |first=Ed |date=18 February 2006 |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reinhold Messner]] later said that the survival instinct he showed was of the sort which defines the best mountaineers.&lt;ref name="Le Monde"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=933158&amp;clef=ARC-TRK-NC_01 |title=Jean-Christophe Lafaille|accessdate=2008-04-23 |last=Buffet |first=Charlie |date=7 February 2006 |work=[[Le Monde]] |publisher=}} English translation available at [http://www.ukclimbing.com/articles/page.php?id=181 http://www.ukclimbing.com/articles/page.php?id=181]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent career==
[[Image:Drus-2006.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Les Drus]], where Lafaille made his hardest Alpine climb]]
After Annapurna, Lafaille resolved never to climb again, but during his long physical and psychological recovery he began [[scrambling]] in the foothills of the Alps, and eventually returned to extreme climbing.&lt;ref name="Roberts"/&gt; In the Alps he carried out an [[enchainment]] of nine north faces in fifteen days, skiing from mountain to mountain,&lt;ref name="Burke"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/magazine/story/0,,1748172,00.html |title=One step beyond |accessdate=2008-04-23 |last=Burke |first=Jason |date=9 April 2006 |work=[[The Observer]] |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made the [[first ascent]] of the ''Lafaille Route'' on the [[Petit Dru]], which at the time was considered the hardest route in the Alps,&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article732020.ece |title=Jean-Christophe Lafaille |accessdate=2008-04-23 |last= |first= |date=18 February 2006 |work=[[The Times]] |publisher= | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; but his most important climbs were in the Himalaya. 

A year after his accident on Annapurna, he climbed [[Cho Oyu]], and then in 1994 he climbed a new route, solo, on the north face of [[Shishapangma]]. It was the first of many solo ascents of 8000 meter peaks, including consecutive ascents of [[Gasherbrum I]] and [[Gasherbrum II]] in four days in 1996, and [[Manaslu]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="Wells"/&gt;

Annapurna remained an obsession for Lafaille, and he would later call his autobiography ''Prisoner of Annapurna''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Prisonnier de l'Annapurna |last=Lafaille |first=Jean-Christophe |authorlink= |author2=Heimermann, Benoit |year=2003 |publisher= Guérin|location= |isbn=978-2-911755-68-2 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the mountain three times. The first time he made a solo attempt on the British line on the South Face, which failed due to poor snow conditions. In 1998 he returned to the same route with a larger team, but the expedition was abandoned when a team member was killed in an [[avalanche]].&lt;ref name="Wells"/&gt; He finally reached the summit in 2002 with [[Alberto Iñurrategi]] ''via'' the long, committing east ridge.&lt;ref name="Roberts"/&gt;

By 2003 Lafaille had decided to try to climb all fourteen 8000-metre peaks; but unlike many of the mountaineers who take on this goal, he had no desire simply to climb them by well established routes, in large expeditions and with bottled oxygen. He preferred to continue trying to achieve new routes or solo ascents, or to climb in the more demanding winter season.&lt;ref name="Wells"/&gt; In 2003 he climbed [[Nanga Parbat]], [[Dhaulagiri]] (solo) and [[Broad Peak]] in a two-month period. The last of these nearly killed him when he fell into a [[crevasse]] and then developed [[high altitude pulmonary edema]].&lt;ref name="Wells"/&gt; He was rescued by [[Ed Viesturs]] and [[Denis Urubko]].&lt;ref name="MEnet"/&gt;

In December 2004 he made a solo ascent of Shishapangma. It was intended to be the first winter ascent of the mountain, but he reached the summit on 11 December which was seen as too early to be classed as a true winter ascent.&lt;ref name="MEnet"/&gt; By this point he had completed eleven of the fourteen peaks, and needed [[Mount Everest|Everest]], [[Kanchenjunga]] and [[Makalu]] to complete his goal.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;

==Death on Makalu==
[[Image:Makalu.jpg|thumb|right|Makalu, scene of Jean-Christophe Lafaille's last climb]]
Lafaille's last climb was one of his boldest. In December 2005 he began a solo attempt to climb [[Makalu]] (8462m), the only 8000-metre peak in [[Nepal]] not to have seen a winter ascent.&lt;ref name="GO"/&gt; It was a goal which would have been considered suicidal a few years previously,&lt;ref name="Wells"/&gt; but for Lafaille the danger was an important part of the experience. He commented

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I find it fascinating that our planet still has areas where no modern technology can save you, where you are reduced to your most basic - and essential - self. This natural space creates demanding situations that can lead to suffering and death, but also generate a wild interior richness. Ultimately, there is no way of reconciling these contradictions. All I can do it&lt;!--sic, in source as "it"--&gt; try to live within their margins, in the narrow boundary between joy and horror. Everything on this earth is a balancing act."&lt;ref name="Wells"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Over four weeks in December and January, he hauled loads up the mountain, entirely alone above his advance base camp at 5300m, but was forced to retreat from the [[Mountain pass|col]] at Makalu La by strong winds, which destroyed his tent and twice blew him into the air. However, after two weeks at base camp the weather improved, and on 24 January he set off up the mountain. His only means of communication was a [[satellite phone]], which he used to speak to his wife several times a day. By the morning of the 27th he was camped on a small ledge around 1000m below the summit, and told his wife that he would try to reach the top that day. He was never heard from again. Alone on the mountain in winter, with no climbers in the world sufficiently [[Acclimatization|acclimatised]] to reach his high camp, there was no possibility of a rescue attempt.&lt;ref name="GO"/&gt; His base camp team gave up hope of him returning alive after he had been missing for a week, and a later helicopter flight over the mountain failed to find any sign of him.&lt;ref name="Wells"/&gt; His body has not been found and his exact fate is unknown.&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt; He left his wife, Katia, and two children.&lt;ref name="Wells"/&gt;

[[File:kittyfelton.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Felton drafted nearly all of the State's early legislation covering welfare and relief.]]

'''Katharine Conway "Kitty" Felton''' (1873–1940) was a head of Associated Charities in [[San Francisco]]  at the turn of the 20th century. 

Felton was born in [[Oakland, California]], on July 7, 1873, the daughter of a prominent San Francisco Bay Area family. Her father John Brooks Felton, was a judge and mayor of Oakland and has the [[Santa Cruz County, California|Santa Cruz County]] town of [[Felton, California]] named for him. She was called "the conscience of the city" because of her dedication to [[social work]] according to History of FSA by Dan Kelly, Director of Planning for the Human Services Agency of San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCKnjvjkg5s&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, at the age of 28, Felton was appointed director of Associated Charities (now the Felton Institute--formerly the [[Family Service Agency of San Francisco]]).

In the crucible of the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] and fire, she became the head of the social service efforts to restore the life of the people of the city and developed innovative solutions that are common practice today. She created the first [[employment agency]] in the United States, developed mental health counseling to deal with the traumatized, became an advocate for foster care, and by combining private and public funds made it possible for widowed and single mothers to remain at home with their children. She also was responsible for emptying the refugee camps and finding placements for the dispossessed, all of which she accomplished within one year.  These innovations became known as the "San Francisco Model" by 1907. 

Felton drafted nearly all of the State's early legislation covering welfare and relief according to the Proceedings of the National Conference of Social Work, Volume 13, 1901. &lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=YOYEBPPdUdMC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=Katharine+Felton&amp;source=web&amp;ots=oyWtHIXZ44&amp;sig=5_VwPZ5-6b7gnzZxpfo0j3EZGc8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1928, with the help of her friend architect [[Bernard Maybeck]], she built what is today the office building of Family Service Agency at 1010 Gough Street in San Francisco.

In 2006, the [[Felton Institute]] for Excellence in Clinical Training  was named for Kitty Felton.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8482">'''Lakeside Healthcare Group''' based in [[Corby]], Northamptonshire is the biggest [[General practice]] in the [[National Health Service]] with 62 partners and more than 100,000 patients.

==Formation==
The original practice, Lakeside Surgery, was one of the largest GP partnerships in England with 47,000 registered patients in 2014, the majority of Corby [[Clinical Commissioning Group]]'s population, and 22 doctors. The practice managing partner Linda Ward joined as practice manager in 1988 and became managing partner, one of the first non-clinical partners in the country. She helped develop and open Corby Urgent Care Centre (later run by separate business 'Lakeside Plus Limited', see below). She retired in July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Linda retires from Lakeside practice|url=http://www.northantstelegraph.co.uk/news/community/community-news/linda-retires-from-lakeside-practice-1-6160975|accessdate=14 July 2014|publisher=Northamptonshire Telegraph|date=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Robert Harris, former national Director of Strategy at [[NHS England]] and NHS National Commissioning Board, was appointed a full-time equity partner of Lakeside Surgeries in July 2014 with a remit to design and roll out its new models of care across a bigger geography.  (see MCP below) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS England strategy director joins GP and urgent care provider|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/primary-care/nhs-england-strategy-director-joins-gp-and-urgent-care-provider/5071376.article#.U8P8_vldUk4|accessdate=14 July 2014|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lakeside Healthcare Group has been appointed by NHS England as one of only 14 Multispecialty Community Providers (MCPs) across the NHS created by the [[Five Year Forward View]] which was published in 2014.  Its intention is to enlarge the scope of general practice into hospitals, urgent care centres and ambulatory care, employing salaried doctors as well as other healthcare professionals - pharmacists, physician associates and healthcare assistants as well as different grades of nurses. It will manage some short-stay community care beds and deliver some services in the community which are now operated in hospital outpatient clinics. The strategic plan of Lakeside Healthcare Group is to be the provider of the majority of care needed by Lakeside patients and also a specialist provider of other services (e.g.urology, ophthalmology, dermatology and several other services) to a wider group of patients.

It describes itself as a "super-practice" and claims to be offering doctors “well above” the average pay for salaried GPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Expanding ‘super-practice’ wants GPs to work across secondary care|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/hsj-local/ccgs/nhs-corby-ccg/expanding-super-practice-wants-gps-to-work-across-secondary-care/5084965.article#.VfWFH25IjDE|accessdate=13 September 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new group was formed in July 2015 by the merger of Lakeside Surgeries with  Headlands Surgery, [[Kettering]]. Initially other local practices that did not fulfill the requirements for full merger were offered 'affiliate' status. However, the preferred operating model is for practices to become fully integrated, sharing a common IT platform, workforce, clinical protocols and corporate governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Expanding ‘super-practice’ wants GPs to work across acute care|url=http://www.lgcplus.com/news/health/social-care/expanding-super-practice-wants-gps-to-work-across-acute-care/5085021.article|accessdate=13 September 2015|publisher=Local Government Chronicle|date=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  St Mary’s Medical Centre, Sheepmarket Surgery and the Little Surgery in [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]] and [[Oundle]] Medical Practice agreed to join the organisation in September 2015 In July 2017, Rushden Medical Centre merged with Lakeside Healthcare Group bringing a further 11,000 patients and 4 further partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Corby and Kettering area GPs merge to create largest practice in NHS|url=http://www.northantstelegraph.co.uk/news/top-stories/corby-and-kettering-area-gps-merge-to-create-largest-practice-in-nhs-1-6951177|accessdate=13 September 2015|publisher=Northants Telegraph|date=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of the organisation has been welcomed by [[Jeremy Hunt]] who was quoted as saying  ‘By integrating services and moving more care closer to people’s homes, we can ensure efficient spending and prevent unnecessary trips to hospital for the frail elderly and people with long-term conditions.’

Dr. Peter Wilczynski, formerly chair of Corby [[Clinical Commissioning Group]] resigned from that position to become Chair with Prof. Robert Harris becoming Chief Executive Officer of the expanded Lakeside Healthcare Group.  The organisation plans to cover 300,000 patients eventually across the East Midlands region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Largest GP practice in the country set to cover 100,000 patients|url=http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/home/finance-and-practice-life-news/largest-gp-practice-in-the-country-set-to-cover-100000-patients/20020076.article#.VfVEpm5IjDE|accessdate=13 September 2015|publisher=Pulse|date=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice applied to move its membership from Corby CCG (where it had 2/3 of the registered population) to Nene CCG in 2015. This plan was not approved because the membership transfer would according to Corby CCG board minutes have destablised that CCG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vanguard 'super practice' bid to switch CCG rejected|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/hsj-local/commissioners/nhs-corby-ccg/exclusive-vanguard-super-practice-bid-to-switch-ccg-rejected/5091626.article|accessdate=12 December 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lakeside Plus Limited==

Lakeside Plus Limited, which is an entirely separately business to Lakeside Healthcare Group with independent management,  was appointed by the three Leicestershire CCGs and University Hospitals Leicester to manage and run a "front door"  service for the A&amp;E Department at the Leicester Royal Infirmary (LRI) site [[University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust]].  The intention is that where patients can use other services, such as primary care, they are directed to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Super practice’ vanguard appointed to run A&amp;E ‘front door’|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/hsj-local/providers/university-hospitals-of-leicester-nhs-trust/super-practice-vanguard-appointed-to-run-ae-front-door/5091772.article|accessdate=13 December 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; LRI is acknowledged to be the busiest A&amp;E department in the country seeing on average over 725 attending patients every day. Lakeside Plus Limited clinicians however already treat well over 200 urgent care patients in every 12-hour shift (pro rated to over 400 patients in a 24-hour period) at the Lakeside Plus flagship Urgent Care Centre in Corby (building owned by Lakeside Healthcare Group hence the shared name) thus making them busier than most hospital A&amp;E departments. Lakeside Plus Limited clinicians had previously been invited into the A&amp;E department of Peterborough &amp; Stamford Hospitals Foundation Trust (December 2014) to assist the trust in coping with winter A&amp;E pressures.

In August 2017 an independent hearing determined that Corby Clinical Commissioning Group had wrongly failed to pay the national NHS tariff rate for services provided since April 2014 and ordered it to increase the rate it was paying for activity by at least 25% and to backdate the increase to 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Serious implications' as CCG ordered to pay full tariff rate to private provider|url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/nhs-corby-ccg/serious-implications-as-ccg-ordered-to-pay-full-tariff-rate-to-private-provider/7020356.article?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTldFMU1XTmlZV1kyTnpNdyIsInQiOiIxSk5XK09SRXR4VjNaTU1oWGhRN2xtdFppejFXbXhtWjRnbGgxVkdMb1RzWkMyRVZUZUZkVDVHRVlHT0xMQWFaOUhIdnpJMUh5djlRVmQ0N3lNU1Z0QWd0dncyOFFDeGJVbU9DeVlCQmtsQ0g5T21tRk4wY0k1Y1ptZCtRUGdXUyJ9|accessdate=3 October 2017|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mayo Foundation v. United States''''', 562 U.S. 44 (2011), is a [[United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court upheld a [[United States Treasury Department|Treasury Department]] regulation on the grounds that the courts should defer to government agencies in tax cases in absence of an unreasonable decision on the part of the agency.

Under the [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act]] (FICA), students and their educational employers are exempted from paying [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] taxes. The Treasury Department issued a regulation in 2004, declaring those who worked more than 40 hours a week were ineligible for such an exemption. The [[Mayo Foundation]] filed suit to challenge the regulation and for a refund of the taxes it had paid on its [[Residency (medicine)|medical residents]]—recently graduated physicians who work more than [[full-time]] providing patient care, but who are still considered [[Medical education#Postgraduate education|trainees]] by the medical profession. The District Court ruled for the Mayo Foundation and struck the regulation, but was reversed by the Court of Appeals.

The Supreme Court ruled unanimously to uphold the regulation as within the Treasury Department's statutory authority to issue and as a reasonable construction of FICA. The Court clarified that the deferential standard of ''[[Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.]]'' (1984) applied, notwithstanding prior Court rulings that had adopted a more stringent standard to tax regulations. Applying ''Chevron'', the Court first found that Congress had left the matter to the agency because the statute was silent on the definition of "student" and its applicability to medical residents specifically. Second, the Court found that the regulation was a reasonable interpretation of the statute, and that its clear line helped distinguish workers who study and students who work, simplified enforcement, and furthered the broad coverage of Social Security.

==Background==
In the first decade of the 21st century, the vast majority of medical residents in the United States were physicians who had recently graduated from a [[medical school in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF |title=Results and Data: 2010 Main Residency Match |edition=2 |author=[[National Resident Matching Program]] |date=April 2010 |accessdate=March 2, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wtKLM50T?url=http://www.nrmp.org/data/resultsanddata2010.pdf |archivedate=March 2, 2011 |url=http://www.nrmp.org/data/resultsanddata2010.pdf |page=9 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While graduating from a medical school provides an individual with a medical degree, a state [[medical license]] is required to practice medicine.

In 1935, the United States Congress passed the [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act]] (FICA), which imposed a [[payroll tax]] on workers. The revenues of the tax were meant to be used to finance [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Wilbur J.|title=The Development of the Social Security Act of 1935: Reflections Some Fifty Years Later.|journal=Minnesota Law Review|volume=68|year=1983|page=379}}&lt;/ref&gt; An amendment to the Act, passed four years later, provided that a "service performed in the employ of... a school, college, or university... if such service is performed by a student enrolled in and regularly attending classes at such school, college, or university" would be exempt.&lt;ref name="NEJM1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Kesselheim | first1 = A.

Until the 1990s, the Act and its application to medical residents were not an issue. Many hospitals assessed and paid FICA taxes on behalf of their employees. The [[University of Minnesota]]'s hospitals did not, however, and in the early 1990s, the [[Social Security Administration]] sued to recover a small portion of those taxes.&lt;ref name="NEJM1" /&gt; An initial administrative review ruled for the Social Security Administration, but the district court reversed. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] affirmed the district court's decision after granting a ''[[De novo review|de novo]]'' review,&lt;ref&gt;''Minnesota v.

However, it also promulgated a new regulation to take effect in April 2005 that stated that any full-time employee, which includes nearly all medical residents, were ineligible to receive the student exemption,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The relevant section of the Treasury's regulation states: "The services of a full-time employee are not incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study. The determination of whether an employee is a full-time employee is based on the employer’s standards and practices, except regardless of the employer’s classification of the employee, an employee whose normal work schedule is 40 hours or more per week is considered a full-time employee. An employee’s normal work schedule is not affected by increases in hours worked caused by work demands unforeseen at the start of an academic term. However, whether an employee is a full-time employee is reevaluated for the remainder of the academic term if the employee changes employment positions with the employer. An employee’s work schedule during academic breaks is not considered in determining whether the employee’s normal work schedule is 40 hours or more per week.

==Lower court proceedings and arguments before the Supreme Court==
The Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota sued in [[United States federal courts|federal court]] to overturn those regulations. The [[United States district court|district court]]s agreed with them, but upon appeal, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] consolidated the two cases into one and reversed the judgments, [[Remand (court procedure)|remanding]] the cases for entry of judgments in favor of the United States.&lt;ref name="Am J. Trial Advoc."&gt;{{cite journal|last=La Fleur|first=Zachary|title=Are Medical Residents Classified as Full-Time or Student Employees Under FICA and IRS Regulations?|journal=American Journal of Trial Advocacy|volume=34|year=2010|page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was at odds with decisions from the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh]], and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|Eleventh]] Circuits, which had all previously ruled that residents may count as students for the purpose of FICA taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=5871dd3c-df68-481e-b7b5-e53a0ddec3c6|title=Supreme Court to hear several cases affecting labor &amp; employment|date=July 19, 2010|accessdate=August 21, 2011|author=Winston &amp; Strawn LLP|publisher=Lexology|quote=In Mayo, the Eighth Circuit held that the IRS regulation exempting residents was a permissible interpretation of FICA.

Trial Advoc." /&gt;

Mayo and Minnesota, supported by [[amicus brief]]s from a number of residency programs and medical organizations, argued that a residency is primarily educational in nature. They asserted that a residency is generally chosen based on academic criteria and that a residency must be completed in order for a physician to be licensed to practice medicine. They also argued that residency training involves not only supervised work, but also an educational curriculum, conferences, and lectures, much like [[Medical school in the United States#Curriculum|clinical years of medical school]].&lt;ref name="NEJM1" /&gt; Mayo's attorney, former [[George W. Bush Administration|Bush Administration]] [[Solicitor General of the United States|Solicitor General]] [[Theodore Olson]],&lt;ref name="AP" /&gt; also argued that the rule was "arbitrary", as the tax would apply to a resident working 40 hours per week but not to a resident working only 39 hours per week. The medical schools proposed that the IRS should base their determination on the primary purpose of a program—providing an education versus providing a livelihood.&lt;ref name="WSJ1" /&gt;

In response, Assistant to the Solicitor General [[Matthew D. Roberts]] argued on behalf of the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2010/11/08/court_seems_divided_on_taxing_medical_residents/ |newspaper=Boston Globe |title=Court seems divided on taxing medical residents |agency=Associated Press |last=Holland |first=Jesse J. |date=November 8, 2010 |accessdate=February 18, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wbbQvcDS?url=http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2010/11/08/court_seems_divided_on_taxing_medical_residents/ |archivedate=February 19, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that patient care and not educational curricula occupies the vast majority of residents' time. He also argued that although the 1939 FICA Amendment had originally specifically exempted [[Internship (medicine)|interns]], residents who had not yet obtained their unrestricted medical license, that exemption was removed in 1965 to allow doctors to begin paying into Social Security earlier so that they could be eligible for certain benefits.&lt;ref name="NEJM1" /&gt;

During oral arguments, Chief Justice [[John Roberts]] noted that the case was a "very familiar situation of an apprentice who is both an employee and a student," and that the only way that one could draw a line between the two "is to have somebody say: This is going to be the line." He was of the opinion that if anyone should draw the line, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] should be the one. Associate Justice [[Sonia Sotomayor]], on the other hand, felt that residents were employees, as evidenced by her statement "You don't think receiving $50,000 or $60,000 a year is enough to make you an employee of someone?" According to ''The Wall Street Journal'', Associate Justice [[Samuel Alito]] appeared to be more favorable to the medical schools, asking the Justice Department's lawyer at one point "in general, why do medical students become residents? Are they enrolled in the program to make money...or do they want additional education?"&lt;ref name="WSJ1"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Vaughan |first1=Martin |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |title=Justices Reluctant to Let Medical Residents Skip Taxes |date=November 8, 2010 |accessdate=January 17, 2011 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703514904575602661426355290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinion of the Court==
In a decision written by Chief Justice Roberts, the Supreme Court unanimously upheld the Eighth Circuit's decision.&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite news|title=Supreme Court says medical residents are considered employees for Social Security tax purposes |agency=Associated Press |last=Holland |first=Jesse J. |newspaper=Star Tribune |url=http://www.startribune.com/local/113273014.html |date=January 11, 2011 |accessdate=January 17, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w4vHOJ4g?url=http://www.startribune.com/local/113273014.html |archivedate=January 28, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Associate Justice [[Elena Kagan]] recused herself from participating in the case, as she had signed the government's brief during her tenure as [[Solicitor General of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/01/12/supreme_court_says_medical_residents_not_students_for_tax_purposes |title=Medical Residents Ruled Employees |publisher=''[[Inside Higher Ed]]'' |last1=Stripling |first1=Jack |date=January 12, 2011 |accessdate=January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Declining to review using a standard set out in ''[[National Muffler Dealers Assn., Inc. v. United States]]'' (1979), the Court instead used a standard set out in ''[[Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.]]'' (1984).&lt;ref name="Fl Tax Rev" /&gt; ''Chevron'', a landmark case regarding deference to government agencies, instituted a two-part test: The job of the reviewing court is to first establish whether Congress has unambiguously spoken about the matter. If so, the court is to follow Congress' intent. If not, it is the job of the court to determine whether the agency's statutory interpretation was a reasonable one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.|vol=467|reporter=U.S.|opinion=837|court=S. Ct.|pinpoint=842–843|date=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''National Muffler'', on the other hand, requires that reviewing courts take into account "whether the regulation harmonizes with the plain language of the statute, its origin, and its purpose" and states that courts may examine a statutory interpretation made years after the passage of the original act on the merits.&lt;ref group="note" name="NatMuf" /&gt; The Mayo Foundation had requested that the Court rule according to the ''National Muffler'' standard, while the United States argued that the Court should use the ''Chevron'' standard, arguing that ''National Muffler'' had been superseded. The Court had in fact cited both cases in opinions since 1984, but agreed with the Government's position, stating that it would not be wise to "carve out an approach to administrative review good for tax law only".&lt;ref name="Mayo Part II"&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Mayo Foundation for Medical Ed. and Research v. United States|vol=562|reporter=U.S.|opinion=___|date=2011|pinpoint=Part II|court=S. Ct.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the Mayo Foundation's arguments otherwise, the Court ruled that "student" was a sufficiently ambiguous term to state that Congress has specifically addressed the issue. The Court also noted that Congress in the past had specifically singled out medical residents when making exemptions available, which in the Court's eyes made the Mayo Foundation's arguments about unambiguity unreasonable.&lt;ref name="Mayo Part II" /&gt; Therefore, according to ''Chevron'', the role of the courts should solely be to determine whether the Treasury Department made a reasonable decision—and the Court concluded that the Treasury did just that.&lt;ref name="Fl Tax Rev" /&gt; In writing for the Court, Roberts stated that "The [Treasury] department certainly did not act irrationally in concluding that these doctors – 'who work long hours, serve as high {{sic}} skilled professionals, and typically share some or all of the terms of employment of career employees' – are the kind of workers that Congress intended to both contribute and benefit from the Social Security system".&lt;ref name="AP" /&gt;

==Impact==
The Mayo Clinic noted that it had been paying the taxes while the case was pending in the courts, so the 15-page opinion would not force them to pay [[back taxes]].&lt;ref name="WSJ2"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kendall |first1=Brent |last2=Vaughan |first2=Martin |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |title=Tax on Medical Residents Upheld by Court |date=January 11, 2011 |accessdate=January 17, 2011 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703791904576075802993814720}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010, while the case was pending before the Supreme Court, the Treasury announced that it would not contest refund claims for taxes paid prior to the April 2005 regulation. It would however assess taxes on salaries paid after that date, which would cost residency programs a total of approximately $700 million annually,&lt;ref name="Chronicle1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Medical Schools Must Pay Social Security Taxes for Residents, Supreme Court Rules |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Medical-Residents-Are-Subject/125916/ |first=Eric |last=Kelderman |newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education |date=January 11, 2011 |accessdate=January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or $3,100 a year for a resident earning $50,000 a year (and equivalent amount for the resident's employer).&lt;ref name="WSJ2" /&gt;

An article in the ''New England Journal of Medicine'' noted that "[r]esidents could find additional support in the Court's unambiguous holding for efforts to enforce other workplace rights, such as unemployment benefits (e.g., after hospital closure) or protection under the [[Family Medical Leave Act]]."&lt;ref name="NEJM1" /&gt;

The Supreme Court's decision to use ''Chevron'' as its test for reviewing the Treasury Department's decision for marked a departure from previous practice; the Court had the courts have previously given less deference to the Internal Revenue Service's statutory interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A New Twist to an On-Going Debate About Securities Self-Regulation: It's Time to End FINRA's Federal Income Tax Exemption |first=Kenneth B.|last=Orenbach|journal=Virginia Tax Review|volume=31|page=135|year=2011}}, citing {{cite journal|title=ABA Section on Taxation, Report of the Task Force on Judicial Deference |ssrn=518663 |volume=57|journal=Tax Lawyer|page=717|year=2004 |first1=Ellen P.|last1=Aprill|first2=Linda|last2=Galler|first3=Irving|last3=Salem}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;According to an article in ''The Federal Circuit Bar Journal'', the Court's application of the ''National Muffler'' standard to "tax regulations promulgated under {{USIRC|7805(a)}}" in the years following ''Chevron'' "created confusion among the lower courts". The ''Mayo Foundation'' decision settled the matter. {{cite journal|journal=The Federal Circuit Bar Journal|title=Who's the (Son of) BOSS?: The Struggle Between the Federal Circuit and Treasury to Define "Omits from Gross Income" in Son of BOSS Tax Shelters and Other Overstatement-of-Basis Tax Cases|last=Wagner|first=Derek|volume=21|page=45|year=2011}}, partially citing {{cite journal|first=Michael E.|last=Berg|title=Judicial Deference to Tax Regulations: A Reconsideration in Light of National Cable, Swallows Holding, and Other Developments|volume=61|journal=Tax Law|pages=481, 498|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an article in the ''Florida Tax Review'', the Court in doing so "unambiguously overruled" its previous decision in the ''National Muffler'' in favor of ''Chevron'', finding that an agency should have leeway in interpreting the statute in question, no matter when or how long ago the statute was placed in effect, how consistent the agency was in interpreting the statute, the importance of the statute or how closely Congress has looked into the agency's decision.&lt;ref name="Fl Tax Rev" /&gt;&lt;ref group="note" name="NatMuf"&gt;''National Muffler'' indicated that the proper standard for judicial review should be the following: "In determining whether a particular regulation carries out the congressional mandate in a proper manner, we look to see whether the regulation harmonizes with the plain language of the statute, its origin, and its purpose. A regulation may have particular force if it is a substantially contemporaneous construction of the statute by those presumed to have been aware of congressional intent. If the regulation dates from a later period, the manner in which it evolved merits inquiry. Other relevant considerations are the length of time the regulation has been in effect, the reliance placed on it, the consistency of the Commissioner's interpretation, and the degree of scrutiny Congress has devoted to the regulation during subsequent re-enactments of the statute." {{cite journal|last1=McMahon|first1=Martin J., Jr.|last2=Shepard|first2=Ira B.|first3=Daniel L.|last3=Simmons|title=Recent Developments in Federal Income Taxation: The Year 2010 |journal=Florida Tax Review|volume=10|year=2011|page=565}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an article in the ''George Washington Law Review'' which advocates for the use of the ''National Muffler'' standard in reviewing retroactive tax regulations ({{USIRC|7805(b)}}) states that ''National Muffler'' may not have been entirely overruled, arguing that the Court implied that ''Chevron'' test is only to be used in "complex questions of statutory interpretation" and that the Court left open the possibility that a future scenario may warrant the use of the ''National Muffler'' test instead of the ''Chevron'' test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Andrew |last=Pruitt |journal=George Washington Law Review |title=Judicial Deference to Retroactive Interpretative Treasury Regulations |url=http://groups.law.gwu.edu/lr/ArticlePDF/79-5-Pruitt.pdf |volume=79 |year=2011 |page=1558 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61zgK8EVG?url=http://groups.law.gwu.edu/lr/ArticlePDF/79-5-Pruitt.pdf |archivedate=September 26, 2011 |format=PDF |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court also overruled ''[[Rowan Cos. v. United States]]'' (1981), and ''[[United States v. Vogel Fertilizer Co.]]'' (1982), stating that the ''Chevron'' test does not depend on whether Congress intended to delegate out general authority over a matter or just specific authority.&lt;ref name="Fl Tax Rev" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayo Part II" /&gt;

'''Men who have sex with men''' ('''MSM'''), also known as '''males who have sex with males''', are [[male]] persons who engage in [[sexual activity]] with members of the same sex, regardless of how they [[Identity (social science)|identify]] themselves; many such men do not [[Sexual identity|sexually identify]] as [[gay]], [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] or [[bisexuality|bisexual]].&lt;ref name="UNAIDS1"&gt;{{cite web|title= UNAIDS: Men who have sex with men|publisher= [[UNAIDS]]|date=2006|accessdate=April 2, 2014|url= http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/dataimport/pub/briefingnote/2006/20060801_policy_brief_msm_en.pdf|archivedate=June 21, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621123530/http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/dataimport/pub/briefingnote/2006/20060801_policy_brief_msm_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''MSM'' was created in the 1990s by [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]] to study the spread of disease among men who have sex with men, regardless of identity.&lt;ref name="UNAIDS1" /&gt; The term ''MSM'' is often used in medical literature and [[social research]] to describe such men as a group for research studies without considering issues of self-identification. It does not describe any specific sexual activity, and which activities are covered by the term depends on context.

== As a constructed behavioral category ==
The term ''MSM'' had been in use in [[public health]] discussions, especially in the context of [[HIV/AIDS]], since 1990 or earlier, but the coining of the [[initialism]] by Glick ''et al.'' in 1994 "signaled the crystallization of a new concept."&lt;ref name="Young Meyer"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Young RM, Meyer IH |title=The trouble with "MSM" and "WSW": erasure of the sexual-minority person in public health discourse |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=95 |issue=7 |pages=1144–1149 |date=July 2005 |pmid=15961753 |pmc=1449332 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2004.046714 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Glick M, Muzyka BC, Salkin LM, Lurie D |title=Necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis: a marker for immune deterioration and a predictor for the diagnosis of AIDS |journal=J. Periodontol. |volume=65 |issue=5 |pages=393–7 |date=May 1994 |pmid=7913962 |doi= 10.1902/jop.1994.65.5.393|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This behavioral concept comes from two distinct academic perspectives. First, it was pursued by [[epidemiologists]] seeking behavioral categories that would offer better analytical concepts for the study of disease-risk than identity-based categories (such as "gay", "[[bisexual]]", or "straight"), because a man who self-identifies as gay or bisexual is not necessarily sexually active with men, and someone who identifies as straight might be sexually active with men. Second, its usage is tied to criticism of [[sexual identity]] terms prevalent in [[social construction]] literature which typically rejected the use of identity-based concepts across cultural and historical contexts. ''[[The Huffington Post]]''  postulates that the term ''MSM'' was created by [[Cleo Manago]], the man who is also credited for coining the term ''[[same gender loving]]'' (SGL).&lt;ref&gt;[[The Huffington Post]], "[[Cleo Manago]]: The Most Dangerous Black Gay Man?" by Irene Monroe, January 1, 2016 [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/irene-monroe/cleo-manago_b_1280272.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

MSM are not limited to small, self-identified, and visible sub-populations. ''MSM'' and ''gay'' refer to different things: behaviors and social identities. ''MSM'' refers to sexual activities between men, regardless of how they identify, whereas ''gay'' can include those activities but is more broadly seen as a cultural identity. ''Homosexuality'' refers to sexual/romantic attraction between members of the same sex and may or may not include romantic relationships. ''Gay'' is a social identity and is generally the preferred social term, whereas ''homosexual'' is used in formal contexts, though the terms are not entirely interchangeable. Men who are [[non-heterosexual]] or [[questioning (sexuality)|questioning]] may identify with all, none, a combination of these, or one of the newer terms indicating a similar sexual, romantic, and cultural identity like ''[[bi-curious]]''.

In their assessment of the knowledge about the sexual networks and behaviors of MSM in Asia, Dowsett, Grierson and McNally concluded that the category of MSM does not correspond to a single social identity in any of the countries they studied.&lt;ref name="review"&gt;A review of knowledge about the sexual networks and behaviors of men who have sex with men in Asia. Dowsett, Grierson and McNally.[http://www.latrobe.edu.au/arcshs/downloads/Reports/Asia%20MSM.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821163524/http://www.latrobe.edu.au/arcshs/downloads/Reports/Asia%20MSM.pdf|date=August 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were no similar traits in all of the MSM population studied, other than them being males and engaging in sex with other men.

In some countries, homosexual relationships may be illegal or taboo, making MSM difficult to reach.&lt;ref name="msmafrica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aidsportal.org/News_Details.aspx?id=5208&amp;nex=5 |title=MSM in Africa: highly stigmatized, vulnerable and in need of urgent HIV prevention |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713125016/http://www.aidsportal.org/News_Details.aspx?ID=5208 |archivedate=July 13, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=India&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infochangeindia.org/200801116825/Agenda/HIV/AIDS-Big-Questions/Criminalising-high-risk-groups-such-as-MSM.html|title= Criminalizing high-risk groups such as MSM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== As applied to transgender individuals ===
The term's precise use and definition has varied with regard to [[trans women]], people born either biologically male or with ambiguous genitalia who self-identify as female.&lt;ref name="MSTSW"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Operario D, Burton J, Underhill K, Sevelius J |title=Men who have sex with transgender women: challenges to category-based HIV prevention |journal=AIDS Behav |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=18–26 |date=January 2008 |pmid=17705095 |doi=10.1007/s10461-007-9303-y |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources consider trans women who have sex with men to be MSM,&lt;ref name="TGHIVINF"&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenwood |first=Cseneca |author2=Mario Ruberte |title=African American Community and HIV (Slide 14 mentions TG women) |publisher=East Bay AIDS Education and Training Center |date=April 9, 2004 |url=http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/African_American_Transgenders_and_HIV.ppt |format=ppt |accessdate=July 24, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910171338/http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/African_American_Transgenders_and_HIV.ppt |archivedate=September 10, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; others consider women who are trans "alongside" MSM,&lt;ref name="UNAIDS1" /&gt; and others are internally inconsistent (defining transgender women to be MSM in one place but referring to "MSM and transgender" in another).&lt;ref name="TGMSMNET"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Operario D, Burton J |title=HIV-related tuberculosis in a transgender network—Baltimore, Maryland, and New York City area, 1998–2000 |journal=MMWR Morb.

== Prevalence ==
Determining the number of men who have ever had sex with another man is difficult.  Worldwide, at least 3% of men, and perhaps as high as 16% of men, have had sex at least once with a man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/vct/sw_toolkit/Between_men_full_version.pdf| title = Between Men – HIV/STI prevention for men who have sex with men| page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These figures include victims of sexual abuse in addition to men who regularly or voluntarily have sex with men.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

In the U.S., among men aged 15 to 44, an estimated 6% have engaged in oral or anal sex with another man at some point in their lives, and about 2.9% have had at least one male sexual partner in the previous 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Mosher| first = William D. |author2=Anjani Chandra |author3=Jo Jones| journal = Advance Data from Vital and Health Statistics| issue = 362| accessdate = May 7, 2012

{{Globalize|section|date=January 2018}}
Since [[LGBT]] people began to organize for their social and legal rights{{Example needed |s|date=March 2018}}, access to equal health care{{clarify|date=January 2018}} has remained an important but often not primary issue. LGBT-specific health organizations have been formed, including charities educating on specific issues, health clinics, and even professional organizations for LGBT people and their allies.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Many of them have advocated for specific changes to various governmental practices, and the ongoing effort{{Update inline|date=January 2018}} to legalize [[same-sex marriage]] often includes examples of LGBT people unable to secure health coverage equivalent to that of their heterosexual counterparts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The United States Department of Health and Human Services announced in 2012 that the [[Affordable Care Act]] (ACA) would offer new protections, including a ban on insurers discriminating against LGBT persons. The ACA also provided funding for community-based preventive health programs and measures to combat HIV-related health disparities.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/the_aca_helps_lgbt_americans.pdf |title=The Affordable Care Act Helps LGBT Americans |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151109191737/https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/the_aca_helps_lgbt_americans.pdf |archivedate=2015-11-09 |accessdate=2017-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=January 2018}}

=== Mental ===
Since medical literature began to describe homosexuality, it has often been approached from a view that assumed or sought to find an inherent psychopathology as the root cause. Much literature on mental health and homosexuals centered on examples of their depression, [[substance abuse]], and suicide. Although these issues exist among non-heterosexuals, discussion about their causes shifted after homosexuality was removed from the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) in 1973. Instead, social ostracism, legal discrimination, internalization of negative stereotypes, and limited support structures were regarded as indications of the issues faced by homosexuals in Western societies in the late 20th century, which often adversely affected their mental health.&lt;ref&gt;Schlager, Neil, ed. (1998). ''Gay &amp; Lesbian Almanac''. St. James Press. {{ISBN|1-55862-358-2}}, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Even in a country with a tolerant climate regarding homosexuality such as Sweden, same-sex married individuals evidence a higher risk for suicide — almost three times higher,  than other married individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Björkenstam|first=Charlotte|last2=Andersson|first2=Gunnar|last3=Dalman|first3=Christina|last4=Cochran|first4=Susan|last5=Kosidou|first5=Kyriaki|date=2016-07-01|title=Suicide in married couples in Sweden: Is the risk greater in same-sex couples?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-016-0154-6|journal=European Journal of Epidemiology|language=en|volume=31|issue=7|pages=685–690|doi=10.1007/s10654-016-0154-6|issn=0393-2990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexually transmitted infections ===
{{Main|Sexually transmitted disease}}

A 2007 study reported that two large population surveys found "the majority of gay men had similar numbers of unprotected sexual partners annually as straight men and women."&lt;ref name=MedicalNews&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/82330.php|title=Sexual Behavior Does Not Explain Varying HIV Rates Among Gay And Straight Men|work=Medical News Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goodreau SM, Golden MR |title=Biological and demographic causes of high HIV and sexually transmitted disease prevalence in men who have sex with men |journal=Sex Transm Infect |volume=83 |issue=6 |pages=458–462 |date=October 2007 |pmid=17855487 |pmc=2598698 |doi=10.1136/sti.2007.025627}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among men who have anal sex with other men, anal sex without use of a condom is considered to be very risky behavior. A person who inserts their penis into an infected partner is at risk because sexually transmitted diseases (STDS/STIs) can enter through the [[urethra]] or through small cuts, abrasions, or open sores on the penis. Also, condoms are more likely to break during anal sex than during vaginal sex. Thus, even with a condom, anal sex can be risky.&lt;ref name="CDC anal sex"&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV Transmission|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC)|accessdate=May 3, 2014|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/transmission.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Werner"&gt;{{cite book |authors=Werner W.

In 2007, the largest estimated proportion of HIV/AIDS diagnoses among adults and adolescents in the U.S. were men who have sex with men (MSM).

{{Main|Hepatitis B|Healthcare and the LGBT community#Hepatitis}}
[[Hepatitis B]] is a disease caused by [[hepatitis B virus]] (HBV) which infects the [[liver]] of [[hominoidea]], including humans, and causes an [[inflammation]] called [[hepatitis]].

Possible forms of transmission include (but are not limited to) [[unprotected sex]]ual contact, [[blood transfusion]]s, [[needle sharing|re-use of contaminated needles]] and syringes, and [[vertical transmission]] from mother to child during childbirth.

== MSM blood donor controversy ==
{{Main|Men who have sex with men blood donor controversy}}
  
Many countries impose restricting on donating blood for men who have (had) sex with men, as well as their female sex partners—see the maps. Most national standards require direct questioning regarding a donor's sexual history, but the length of deferral varies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2637">'''Metabolic advantage''' is a term used in [[nutrition]] to describe the ability of a [[dieting|diet]] to achieve greater weight loss (or less weight gain&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proteinpower.com/drmike/metabolism/overfeeding-and-metabolic-advantage Overfeeding and the Metabolic Advantage.  Protein Power.]&lt;/ref&gt;) than another diet of equivalent calories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Eugene J Fine and Richard D Feinman |title=Thermodynamics of weight loss diets |journal=Nutrition &amp; Metabolism |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=15 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15588283 |doi= 10.1186/1743-7075-1-15|url=http://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/1/1/15 |pmc=543577}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Edwards|first=Patrick|title=Weight loss calories - Maintain the lifestyle |url=http://verdaderagarcinia.com|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a claimed effect of [[low-carbohydrate diet]]s and was popularised by the [[Atkins diet]], but although several mechanisms exist to make it [[biologically plausible]], it has yet to be definitively demonstrated as a significant factor in weight control. Some studies &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=16358395|year=1994|last1=Bandini|first1=LG|last2=Schoeller|first2=DA|last3=Dietz|first3=WH|title=Metabolic differences in response to a high-fat vs. A high-carbohydrate diet|volume=2|issue=4|pages=348–54|journal=Obesity Research|doi=10.1002/j.1550-8528.1994.tb00074.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; that have specifically measured the changes in basal metabolic rate under isocaloric very high-fat and very high-carbohydrate diets have failed to find any statistically significant differences.

==Cause==

The human body obtains the majority of its energy through the [[citric acid cycle]], which can use any of the macronutrients to generate [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) used to transport chemical energy within cells. The chemical processes involved use energy themselves, so variations in the efficiency of these processes will have the same effect as variations in caloric intake.

==Gluconeogenesis==

The human body requires glucose for the brain and nervous system, and a diet that has very few or no dietary carbohydrates forces it to generate this glucose from protein through [[gluconeogenesis]], with an efficiency of approximately 57% (protein and carbohydrate are approximately equal in calorific value; each has about four kilocalories per gram, but gluconeogenesis can produce only 57g of glucose from 100g of protein). This could be a significant contributor to metabolic advantage.

'''National Prostate Health Month''' (NPHM) is observed every September in North America by health experts, health advocates, and individuals concerned with men’s [[prostate]] health.  Designating a month for the issue serves the purpose of:
* Increasing public awareness of the importance of prostate health
* Providing easily accessible prostate health screenings
* Educating about risk factors and symptoms of prostate related diseases and 
* Advocating for further research on prostate health issues.
&lt;br/&gt;

==Origins==
September was first designated [http://www.prostatehealthguide.com/awareness/prostate-health-month/ National Prostate Health Month] by the American Foundation for Urological Disease (AFUD) in 1999. AFUD is now known as the Urology Care Foundation. Originally the aims of observing NPHM were more proscribed, concentrating on making the public better informed about prostate health issues

In 2001, Senate Resolution 138 sponsored by Sen. [[Conrad Burns]] (R-MT) endorsed the week and affirmed that Prostate Health Month would be observed annually.  In a 2003 presidential proclamation, President George W. Bush voiced his support for the month, but instead of designating the month to be for prostate health in general, specifically named the month “National [[Prostate Cancer]] Awareness Month.”

==Related observances==

In 1989, decade before the creation of National Prostate Health Month, the week of September 17 to September 24 was chosen as Prostate Cancer Awareness Week.    After the creation of NPHM, September came to incorporate observances of other related health weeks.  [[Prostatitis]] Awareness Week is observed from September 10 to September 16 and [[Benign prostatic hypertrophy|Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy]] (BPH) Awareness Week is observed from September 24 to September 30.  However, not all men’s health issues are commemorated in September.  [[Testicular Cancer]] Awareness Week, for example, is celebrated during the week of April 1 to April 7.

* 9/10 – 9/16: Prostatitis Week
* 9/17 – 9/24: Prostate Cancer Week
* 9/24 – 9/30: Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy (BPH) Week
* 4/1 – 4/7: Testicular Cancer Awareness Week

==Events==

[[Oncology]] funds, health systems, medical centers and NGOs, such as [[Men’s Health Network]], are just a few of the US organizations that sponsor events during National Prostate Health Month.  Free screenings for prostate-related diseases are offered at hospitals, health centers, and the workplace.  Physicians are sent information on how NPHW can be used as a way to remind their patients about prostate health. The Prostate Cancer Education Council uses the popularity of sports to spread awareness of prostate health effects and resources.  For example, NFL teams dedicate home games to prostate cancer awareness, and golf tournaments and 5k races distribute informational material to audiences and participants in exchange for the incentive of prizes.

Men's Health Network maintains the Prostate Health Month website at http://www.prostatehealthmonth.com and the Prostate Cancer Awareness Month website at http://prostatecancerawarenessmonth.com which lists links to organizations that are actively promoting events and prostate cancer education during that month.

The '''Nekrep Case''' was a [[legal case|court trial]] that followed the death of a 12-year-old boy, Bor Nekrep, due to a misdiagnosis in [[Slovenia]] in March&amp;nbsp;2008. The treating [[pediatrics|pediatrician]] misdiagnosed an [[inborn error of metabolism|inborn defect]] of the [[urea cycle]] (a very rare genetic condition). After the boy had been brought by his parents to the Paediatric Clinic in [[Maribor]], the doctor, among other things, measured the level of [[ammonia]] in his blood and on the basis of a significantly increased level erroneously diagnosed [[Reye syndrome]]. Because of the misdiagnosis and a delay in appropriate treatment, the boy developed [[cerebral oedema]] and died eight days later.

==Diagnosis and treatment==
Before admission to the Maribor paediatric department, the boy was mainly healthy, as confirmed by parents and proved with his school report, except for a "cold". However, he worsened despite taking antibiotics. He was admitted to the emergency department of the Pediatric Clinic in Maribor at 18:00. In an interview published in April 2009, the doctor treating him said that after she had obtained the results of the ordered laboratory tests, among them the level of ammonia, she diagnosed Reye syndrome on the basis of ''[[Waldo Nelson|Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics]]'', and began to treat him. In the morning, after a consultation, the doctors there called the colleagues at the University Clinical Centre in Ljubljana and ordered his transport there. The treating physician did not directly communicate with Ljubljana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.finance.si/245144 |title=Intervju: Nikoli več se ne bi odločila za študij medicine, saj vzame več, kot pa da |language=Slovene |trans-title=Interview: I Would Never Again Opt to Study Medicine, because It Takes More than Gives |newspaper=Finance.si |date=25 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The boy's father stated at a press conference in November 2008 that the doctors in Maribor had not discovered the elevation of ammonia. According to him, the next morning they received precise instructions for treatment by the doctors of the University Clinical Centre in Ljubljana, but did not implement them. They transported the boy, who had lost consciousness during the night, to Ljubljana with a "tourist transport". The boy's mother said that upon arrival at the Ljubljana hospital, the doctors there lowered his ammonia level "only with glucose and salt to a harmless level".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.delo.si/novice/slovenija/druzina-umrlega-bora-kazensko-ovadila-zdravnico.html |title=Družina umrlega Bora kazensko ovadila zdravnico |language=Slovene |trans-title=The Family of the Deceased Bor Presses Criminal Charges against the Doctor |newspaper=Delo.si |date=26 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As confirmed at the trial in September 2011 by the endocrinologist, who admitted the boy to the [[endocrinology]] department in Ljubljana, the boy was unconscious when he arrived. This surprised him, because the Maribor pediatricians told him that his condition had improved. The laboratory tests that he ordered showed a significantly increased level of ammonia. The intern who accompanied the boy during the transport to Ljubljana said that he had already been unconscious in Maribor. The transport took about an hour and a half. The emergency medical service team said that the transport was not urgent and that the transporting van was not equipped for urgent situations. This was also evident from the documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/na-sojenju-v-zadevi-nekrep-bodo-pricali-ljubljanski-pediatri.html |title=Battelino je bil nad slabim Borovim stanjem presenečen |newspaper=24ur.com |language=Slovene |trans-title=Battelino was Surprised Regarding the Poor Bor's Condition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the board for professional and ethical issues at the [[Medical Chamber of Slovenia]], the treatment was appropriate until the receipt of the laboratory results showing the increase of the level of ammonia. Due to the misdiagnosis, additional necessary treatment was begun only in the morning. They noted that the boy should have been transferred to Ljubljana immediately upon the receipt of the laboratory results. According to them, the doctor who ordered the transport to Ljubljana refrained from administering glucose due to an already increased level of blood glucose. They also noted that it was not possible to say whether the boy would have survived with appropriate treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/odvetnik-nekrepovih-prikrivanje-dejstev/97881 |title=Odvetnik Nekrepovih: "Prikrivanje dejstev" |language=Slovene |trans-title=The Nekrep's Lawyer: "A Cover-Up of Facts". |newspaper=MMC RTV Slovenija |date=10 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internal audit and court trial==
An [[internal audit]] was held and the parents sued the doctor. In October 2011, the competent judge found her guilty of [[negligent treatment]]. She received a [[suspended sentence]] of ten months in prison with a two-year [[probation]]. The court established that the correct way of acting would have been to immediately transfer the boy to the endocrinology department of the University Medical Centre in Ljubljana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sloveniatimes.com/guilty-of-negligence |title=Guilty of Negligence |newspaper=The Slovenia Times |date=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Medical Chamber of Slovenia stripped the doctor of her license for four months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://siol.net/novice/slovenija/zdravnik-oproscen-krivde-za-lazno-pricanje-v-primeru-nekrep-408385 |title=Zdravnik oproščen krivde za lažno pričanje v primeru Nekrep |language=Slovene |trans-title=The Physician Found not Guilty of Perjury in the Nekrep Case |newspaper=Siol.net |date=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the prosecutor also filed a criminal charge against the president of the internal audit commission for [[perjury]]. He claimed that the commission's president had witnessed differently in the [[criminal investigation]] than at the trial and that the diagnosis of Reye syndrome did not occur either in the patient's documentation or in the records of the internal audit. The commission's president witnessed at the trial against the doctor that the doctor had mentioned Reye's syndrome to the commission. At the trial, the doctor defended herself with the claim that she did not prescribe the correct therapy because she diagnosed this syndrome. In February 2015, the commission's president was, on the basis of numerous witnesses who all confirmed the president's words, found not guilty. After the prosecutor's appeal, this was reconfirmed by the competent high court in March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.delo.si/novice/kronika/zdravnika-v-dvomu-oprostilo-se-visje-sodisce.html |title=Zdravnika v dvomu oprostilo še višje sodišče |language=Slovene |trans-title=In Doubt, the Physician Found Not Guilty Also by the High Court |newspaper=Delo.si |date=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970''' is a [[US labor law]] governing the [[United States federal law|federal law]] of [[occupational health and safety]] in the private sector and federal government in the [[United States]]. It was enacted by Congress in 1970 and was signed by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]] on December 29, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/dpt.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709205219/http://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/dpt.htm |archivedate=2012-07-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main goal is to ensure that employers provide employees with an environment free from recognized hazards, such as exposure to toxic chemicals, excessive noise levels, mechanical dangers, heat or cold stress, or unsanitary conditions. The Act created the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) and the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH).

The Act can be found in the [[United States Code]] at title 29, chapter 15.

==History of federal workplace safety legislation==
Efforts by the federal government to ensure workplace health and safety were minimal until the passage of OSHA. The American system of mass production encouraged the use of machinery, while the statutory regime did nothing to protect workplace safety. For most employers, it was cheaper to replace a dead or injured worker than it was to introduce safety measures.&lt;ref&gt;Hounshell, David.

''A Prelude to the Welfare State: The Origins of Workers' Compensation.'' New ed. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2000. {{ISBN|0-226-24984-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], some improvements were made through the establishment of state railroad and factory commissions, the adoption of new technology (such as the [[railway air brake]]), and more widespread availability of [[life insurance]].  But the overall impact of these improvements was minimal.&lt;ref name="Aldrich" /&gt;

The first federal safety legislation was enacted in the [[Progressivism in the United States|Progressive period]]. In 1893, Congress passed the [[Safety Appliance Act]], the first federal statute to require safety equipment in the workplace (the law applied only to railroad equipment, however).&lt;ref name="Aldrich" /&gt; In 1910, in response to a series of highly publicized and deadly mine explosions and collapses, Congress established the [[United States Bureau of Mines]] to conduct research into mine safety (although the Bureau had no authority to regulate mine safety).&lt;ref&gt;Graebner, William. ''Coal Mining Safety in the Progressive Period.'' Lexington: University of Kentucky Press, 1976. {{ISBN|0-8131-1339-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Backed by [[trade union]]s, many states also enacted [[workers' compensation]] laws which discouraged employers from permitting unsafe workplaces.&lt;ref name="Fishback" /&gt; These laws, as well as the growing power of labor unions and public anger toward poor workplace safety, led to significant reductions in worker accidents for a time.&lt;ref name="Aldrich" /&gt;

Industrial production increased significantly in the United States during [[World War II]], and industrial accidents soared. Winning the war took precedence over safety, and most labor unions were more concerned with maintaining wages in the face of severe inflation than with workplace health and safety.&lt;ref name="Senate"&gt;Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee.  ''Job Safety and Health Act of 1970.'' Committee Report No. 91-1282 on S. 2193.  91st Congress, 2d Session (October 6, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt; After the war ended, however, workplace accident rates remained high and began to rise.  In the two years preceding OSHA's enactment, 14,000 workers died each year from workplace hazards, and another 2 million were disabled or harmed.&lt;ref&gt;Stender, John H. "Enforcing the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970: The Federal Government as a Catalyst." ''Law and Contemporary Problems.'' 38:4 (Summer/Autumn 1974).&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the "[[History of chemistry|chemical revolution]]" introduced a vast array of new chemical compounds to the manufacturing environment.  The health effects of these chemicals were poorly understood, and workers received few protections against prolonged or high levels of exposure.&lt;ref name="Ashford"&gt;Ashford, Nicholas A.

''Regulating Safety: An Economic and Political Analysis of Occupational Safety and Health Policy.'' Cambridge: MIT Press, 1979. {{ISBN|0-262-13148-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; While a few states, such as California and New York, had enacted workplace safety as well as workplace health legislation, most states had not changed their workplace protection laws since the turn of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Hosey, Andrew D. and Ede, Louise. ''A Review of State Occupational Health Legislation.'' Washington, D.C.: Bureau of Occupational Safety and Health, U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, January 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Passage==
In the mid-1960s, growing awareness of the environmental impact of many chemicals had led to a politically powerful [[environmental movement]]. Some labor leaders seized on the public's growing unease over chemicals in the environment, arguing that the effect of these compounds on worker health was even worse than the low-level exposure plants and animals received in the wild.&lt;ref name="Leopold"&gt;Leopold, Les. ''The Man Who Hated Work and Loved Labor: The Life and Times of Tony Mazzocchi.'' White River Junction, Vt.: Chelsea Green Publishing, 2007. {{ISBN|1-933392-64-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Donnelly"&gt;Donnelly, Patrick G. "The Origins of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970." ''Social Problems.'' 30:1 (October 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; On January 23, 1968, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] submitted a comprehensive occupational health and safety bill to Congress.&lt;ref name="Ashford" /&gt; Led by the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]] and the [[National Association of Manufacturers]], the legislation was widely opposed by business.&lt;ref name="Bitter"&gt;Page, Joseph A. and O'Brien, Mary-Win. ''Bitter Wages.'' New York: Grossman, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Many labor leaders, including the leadership of the [[AFL-CIO]], supported the legislation, including testifying in support at congressional hearings.&lt;ref name="history_osha"&gt;{{cite web|last=MacLaury|first=Judson|title=The Job Safety Law of 1970: Its Passage Was Perilous|url=https://www.dol.gov/general/aboutdol/history/osha|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation died in committee.&lt;ref name="Senate" /&gt;

On April 14, 1969, President Richard Nixon introduced two bills into Congress which would have also protected worker health and safety.&lt;ref name="Senate" /&gt; The Nixon legislation was much less prescriptive than the Johnson bill, and workplace health and safety regulation would be advisory rather than mandatory.&lt;ref name="Ashford" /&gt; However, [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[James G. O'Hara]] and [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Harrison A. Williams]] introduced a much stricter bill similar to the Johnson legislation of the year before.&lt;ref name="Senate" /&gt;

Companion legislation introduced in the House also imposed an all-purpose "general duty" clause on the enforcing agency as well.&lt;ref name="Senate" /&gt; With the stricter approach of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] bill apparently favored by a majority of both chambers,&lt;ref name="Senate" /&gt; and unions now strongly supporting a bill,&lt;ref name="Leopold" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Donnelly" /&gt; [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] introduced a new, competing bill.&lt;ref name="Senate" /&gt; The compromise bill established the independent research and standard-setting board favored by Nixon, while creating a new enforcement agency. The compromise bill also gave the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] the power to litigate on the enforcement agency's behalf (as in the Democratic bill).&lt;ref name="Senate" /&gt; In November 1970, both chambers acted: The House passed the Republican compromise bill, while the Senate passed the stricter Democratic bill (which now included the general duty clause).&lt;ref name="Senate" /&gt;

A [[United States Congress Conference committee|conference committee]] considered the final bill in early December 1970. Union leaders pressured members of the conference committee to place the standard-setting function in the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] rather than an independent board. In return, unions agreed to let an independent review commission have veto power over enforcement actions.&lt;ref name="Bitter" /&gt; Unions also agreed to removal of a provision in the legislation which would have let the Secretary of Labor shut down plants or stop manufacturing procedures which put workers in "imminent danger" of harm.&lt;ref name="Bitter" /&gt; In exchange for a Republican proposal to establish an independent occupational health and safety research agency, Democrats won inclusion of the "general duty" clause and the right for union representatives to accompany a federal inspector during inspections.&lt;ref name="Bitter" /&gt; The conference committee bill passed both chambers on December 17, 1970, and President Nixon signed the bill on December 29, 1970.&lt;ref name="Senate" /&gt; According to the ''New York Times'', labor and environment activist [[Tony Mazzocchi]] was a "principal force behind the legislation".&lt;ref&gt;Greenhouse, Steven.

Retrieved 22 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act went into effect on April 28, 1971 (now celebrated as [[Workers' Memorial Day]] by American labor unions).&lt;ref&gt;MacLaury, Judson.

==Description==
In passing the Act, Congress declared its intent "to assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe and healthful working conditions and to preserve our human resources."&lt;ref&gt;29 USC 651(b).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act created the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA), an agency of the Department of Labor. OSHA was given the authority both to set and enforce workplace health and safety standards.&lt;ref name="Ashford" /&gt; The Act also created the independent [[Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission]] to review enforcement priorities, actions and cases.&lt;ref name="Ashford" /&gt;

The Act also established the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH), an independent research institute in the then Department of Health, Education &amp; Welfare now under-[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control]] and Prevention.&lt;ref name="Ashford" /&gt;

The Act defines an employer to be any "person engaged in a business affecting commerce who has employees, but does not include the United States or any state or political subdivision of a State." The Act applies to employers as diverse as manufacturers, construction companies, law firms, hospitals, charities, labor unions and private schools.

Churches and other religious organizations are covered if they employ workers for secular purposes. The Act excludes the self-employed, family farms, workplaces covered by other federal laws (such as mining, nuclear weapons manufacture, railroads and airlines) and state and local governments (unless state law permits otherwise). The Act covers federal agencies and the [[United States Postal Service]].&lt;ref name="AllAbout"&gt;Occupational Safety and Health Administration. ''All About OSHA.'' OSHA 3302-06N. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of Labor, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 5 of the Act contains the "[[general duty clause]]." The "general duty clause" requires employers to 1) Maintain conditions or adopt practices reasonably necessary and appropriate to protect workers on the job; 2) Be familiar with and comply with standards applicable to their establishments; and 3) Ensure that employees have and use personal protective equipment when required for safety and health.&lt;ref name="AllAbout" /&gt; OSHA has established regulations for when it may act under the "general duty clause." The four criteria are 1) There must be a hazard; 2) The hazard must be a recognized hazard (e.g., the employer knew or should have known about the hazard, the hazard is obvious, or the hazard is a recognized one within the industry); 3) The hazard could cause or is likely to cause serious harm or [[occupational fatality|death]]; and 4) The hazard must be correctable (OSHA recognizes not all hazards are correctable).

Although theoretically a powerful tool against workplace hazards, it is difficult to meet all four criteria. Therefore, OSHA has engaged in extensive regulatory rule-making to meet its obligations under the law.&lt;ref&gt;Schneid, T.D. ''Legal Liability: A Guide for Safety and Loss Prevention Professionals.'' Aspen, Colo.: Aspen Publishers, 1997. {{ISBN|0-8342-0984-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Bill. "Understanding OSHA and Safety and Health Regulations." In ''Effective Environmental, Health, and Safety Management: Using the Team Approach.'' Bill Taylor, ed. Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2005. {{ISBN|0-471-68231-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the difficulty of the rule-making process (which is governed by the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedures Act]]), OSHA has focused on basic mechanical and chemical hazards rather than procedures. Major areas which its standards currently cover are: Toxic substances, harmful physical agents, electrical hazards, fall hazards, hazards associated with trenches and digging, hazardous waste, infectious disease, fire and explosion dangers, dangerous atmospheres, machine hazards, and confined spaces.&lt;ref name="AllAbout" /&gt;

Section 8 of the Act covers reporting requirements. All employers must report to OSHA within eight hours if an employee dies from a work-related incident, or three or more employees are hospitalized as a result of a work-related incident. Additionally, all fatal on-the-job heart attacks must also be reported. Section 8 permits OSHA inspectors to enter, inspect and investigate, during regular working hours, any workplace covered by the Act.&lt;ref name="AllAbout" /&gt; Employers must also communicate with employees about hazards in the workplace. By regulation, OSHA requires that employers keep a record of every non-consumer chemical product used in the workplace. Detailed technical bulletins called [[material safety data sheets]] (MSDSs) must be posted and available for employees to read and use to avoid chemical hazards.&lt;ref&gt;Occupational Safety and Health Administration. ''Hazard Communication Guidelines for Compliance.'' OSHA 3111. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of Labor, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; OSHA also requires employers to report on every injury or job-related illness requiring medical treatment (other than [[first aid]]) on OSHA Form 300, "Log of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses" (known as an "OSHA Log" or "Form 300"). An annual summary is also required and must be posted for three months, and records must be kept for at least five years.&lt;ref&gt;Occupational Safety and Health Administration. ''Small Business Handbook.'' OSHA 2209-02R. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of Labor, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 11(c) of the Act prohibits any employer from [[whistleblower|discharging, retaliating or discriminating]] against any employee because the worker has exercised rights under the Act. These rights include complaining to OSHA and seeking an OSHA inspection, participating in an OSHA inspection, and participating or testifying in any proceeding related to an OSHA inspection.&lt;ref name="AllAbout" /&gt;

Section 18 of the Act permits and encourages states to adopt their own occupational safety and health plans, so long as the state standards and enforcement "are or will be at least as effective in providing safe and healthful employment" as the federal OSH Act. States that have such plans are known as "OSHA States." As of 2007, 22 states and territories operated complete plans and four others had plans that covered only the public sector.&lt;ref name="AllAbout" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3706">'''Patricia Schiller''' (October 27, 1913 - June 29, 2018) was an American lawyer, clinical psychologist and [[sex educator]]. She was a professor in the department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at [[Howard University College of Medicine]] in Washington, DC for 30 years. 

==Early Life and education==
Patricia Schiller was born Pearl Silverman in [[Brooklyn]] as the fourth of four children to Russian-Jewish immigrants.&lt;ref name=lancet&gt;Adam Marcus, Ivan Oransky [DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31706-9 Patricia Schiller Obituary] The Lancet, Volume 392, Issue 10147, p 550, August 18, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; She attended [[Brooklyn Law School]] and received her JD in 1934. In the early 1940s she worked as a legal-aid attorney for the [[National Labor Relations Board]].&lt;ref name=lancet/&gt;

==Career==
Schiller followed an interest in marriage counselling and in 1955 offered courses for the [[Legal Aid Society]]. She helped create the first public school in the U.S. for pregnant girls.&lt;ref name=lancet/&gt;

In 1960, she received a master's degree in clinical psychology from [[American University]] in Washington, DC.
She eventually convinced the Dean of [[Howard University College of Medicine]] in Washington, DC, to hire her at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology.&lt;ref name=lancet/&gt;

In 1967, she founded the [[American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists]] (AASECT),&lt;ref name=lancet/&gt; which was the first U.S. accrediting organization for sex educators.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;Neil Genzlinger [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/11/obituaries/patricia-schiller-a-sex-education-pioneer-dies-at-104.html Patricia Schiller, a Sex-Education Pioneer, Dies at 104] NYT, July 11, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; She collaborated with [[William Masters]] and [[Virginia E. Johnson|Virginia Johnson]] on guidelines and ethical standards for sexual counselors.&lt;ref name=WP/&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1943, she married lawyer Irving Schiller, then a first lieutenant in the Army, two years after they had met. They settled in Washington, and had two children, Louise and Jonathan. The couple had a home on Martha’s Vineyard where she socialised with influential women like Mrs. Robert McNamara, Mrs. W. Willard Wirtz, and Mrs. Arthur Goldberg.&lt;ref name=vine/&gt; The couple moved to Florida permanently in 1990 and her husband died in 2007, while she outlived him another 11 years, becoming 104 years old.&lt;ref name=lancet/&gt; She died of hypertensive cardiovascular disease in [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]] Florida.&lt;ref name=WP&gt;Olesia Plokhii [https://www.heraldnet.com/nation-world/patricia-schiller-prominent-sex-therapist-dies-at-104/ Patricia Schiller, prominent sex therapist, dies at 104] The Washington Post, July 8, 2018 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Schiller published three books, "Creative Approach to Sex Education and Counseling", 1973, which was translated into Spanish and Italian,&lt;ref name=vine&gt;[https://vineyardgazette.com/obituaries/2018/07/03/patricia-schiller-sex-education-pioneer-and-influential-lawyer-professor Patricia Schiller, Sex Education Pioneer and Influential Lawyer, Professor] Vineyard Gazette, July 3, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; "The Sex Profession: What Sex Therapy Can Do", 1981 and "Sex Questions Kids Ask: and How To Answer" in 2009.&lt;ref name=WP/&gt;

== Awards ==
In 1970, she received the "Advanced Pacesetter Award" from the President’s National Advisory Board for founding Webster School, 1963 to 1967, the first U.S. school for pregnant girls which "educated and nurtured them through their high school diplomas". &lt;ref name=vine/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12394">A '''promotora''' is a lay Hispanic/Latino community member who receives specialized training to provide basic health education in the community without being a professional health care worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elder|first=John P.|author2=Ayala, Guadalupe X. |author3=Parra-Medina, Deborah |author4=Talavera, Gregory A. |title=Health Communication in the Latino Community: Issues and Approaches|journal=Annual Review of Public Health|date=January 2009|volume=30|issue=1|pages=227–251|doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.031308.100300}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most of their work entails educating target audiences about health issues affecting their community they also provide guidance in accessing community resources associated with health care. Often promotoras are residents and identified leaders in their community who work for community-based health promotion projects or as part of a research group. Thus, promotoras serve as liaisons between their community,  health professionals, human and social service organizations. As liaisons, they often play the roles of an advocate, educator, mentor, outreach worker, role model, and interpreter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rhodes|first=Scott D.|author2=Foley, Kristie Long |author3=Zometa, Carlos S. |author4=Bloom, Fred R. |title=Lay Health Advisor Interventions Among Hispanics/Latinos|journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine|volume=33|issue=5|pages=418–427|doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2007.07.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 48: Training and Regulations of Promotoras|url=http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/chpr/chw/pubs/HSCChapter48010803.pdf|accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the organizations with which they work, promotoras may volunteer their time, draw a salary or receive a stipend. Promotoras have been predominantly volunteers if they assist only through delivery of educational material. However, since 2004 there has been a significant increase in the number of promotoras who are hired as staff and not only receive reimbursements for costs associated with their job (e.g., mileage reimbursement).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elder|first=John P.|author2=Ayala, Guadalupe X. |author3=Parra-Medina, Deborah |author4=Talavera, Gregory A. |title=Health Communication in the Latino Community: Issues and Approaches|journal=Annual Review of Public Health|volume=30|issue=1|pages=227–251|doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.031308.100300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, promotoras have been Latino women. However, more men are entering the field and the gender-neutral term “promotores” is increasingly being used to be more inclusive.

== History ==
The role of community health workers can be traced back to the 1940s in the [[People’s Republic of China]], where Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] introduced [[barefoot doctors]] to provide medical treatment and education to rural villages within the country.

The use of promotoras began in 1973 in [[Ciudad Juárez]], [[Mexico]], where Salud y Desarrollo Comunitario de Cd. Juárez, A.C. (Health and Community Development of Juárez City), ran by the Federación Mexicana de Asociaciones Privadas (Mexican Federation of Private Associations [FEMAP]), developed the first promotora model to help provide medical care and education to marginalized communities in Juárez. From there, the promotora model spread across Mexico to other Latin American countries and eventually to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = History of Promotoras in Mexico|url=http://www.femap.org.mx/conocenos/02_36años_historia/c2.html|accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the promotora model was in use in Latin American countries since 1960,  it did not gain attention in the United States until the mid-1960s  to the 1970s. It was during those two decades that the United States federal government initiated a support campaign for the outreach to rural, marginalized, and hard-to-reach communities with the intention of improving access to care.  Such model regained attention in the 1990s thanks to efforts from [[Centers for Disease Control]] and [[Health Resources and Services Administration]].

The essence of using promotoras as means of health education dissemination to prevent disease has been used in countries in the continent of Africa for much longer than in the Americas. Third world countries with high mortality rates of preventable and infectious diseases adopted this model to outreach communities that had no access to decent health care. However, by definition, [[community health workers]] model used in other countries is somewhat different than the one of a promotora in the United States.

== Importance ==
Promotoras have gained significant importance in the way that care is delivered in the United States for Latinos in the last two decades. Latinos are the fastest growing ethnic group in the United States and one with some of the largest health disparities.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Census Bureau Facts for Features|url=https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/facts_for_features_special_editions/cb11-ff18.html}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  
Citizenship, language, and familiarity with the health care system are some of the most common barriers to access care for Latinos.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Doty|first=Michelle M.|title=Hispanic Patients' Double Burden: Lack of Health Insurance and Limited English|url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Publications/Fund-Reports/2003/Feb/Hispanic-Patients-Double-Burden--Lack-of-Health-Insurance-and-Limited-English.aspx|publisher=The Commonwealth Fund|accessdate=January 30, 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
These barriers are clearly present for Latino immigrants to the United States, who are two to three times more likely than the rest of the population to be uninsured.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ku|first=Leighton|title=How race/ethnicity, immigration status and language affect health insurance coverage, access to care and quality of care among low-income population|url=http://www.kff.org/uninsured/upload/How-Race-Ethnicity-Immigration-Status-and-Language-Affect-Health-Insurance-Coverage-Access-to-and-Quality-of-Care-Among-the-Low-Income-Population.pdf|publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation|accessdate=January 29, 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
There is evidence that promotoras impact the health outcomes of Latinos via outreach and tracking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krieger|first=J|author2=Collier C |author3=Song L |author4=Martin D |title=Linking community-based blood pressure measurement to clinical care: a randomized controlled trial of outreach and tracking by community health workers|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=June 1999|volume=89|issue=6|pages=856–861|pmc=1508657|pmid=10358675|doi=10.2105/ajph.89.6.856}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Since promotoras are often well-respected and community leaders, it is easier for them to communicate interventions with cultural sensitivity and experiential knowledge of community values, leading to faster rapport with program participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elder|first=John P.|author2=Ayala, Guadalupe X. |author3=Parra-Medina, Deborah |author4=Talavera, Gregory A. |title=Health Communication in the Latino Community: Issues and Approaches|journal=Annual Review of Public Health|volume=30|issue=1|pages=227–251|doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.031308.100300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although promotoras are not professional health workers, they are often tasked with projects of similar stature and importance because areas where they work are often significantly underserved (e.g., case management, referral source). In some cases, promotoras are able to achieve similar results to health professionals at much lower cost, often because they lack credentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ayala|first=G. X.|author2=Vaz, L. |author3=Earp, J. A. |author4=Elder, J. P. |author5=Cherrington, A. |title=Outcome effectiveness of the lay health advisor model among Latinos in the United States: an examination by role|journal=Health Education Research|volume=25|issue=5|pages=815–840|doi=10.1093/her/cyq035|pmc=2948840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the use of promotoras to bridge the gap between community needs and health resources is perceived by researchers as one of the most viable solutions to meeting community health needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eng|first=E.|author2=Parker, E. |author3=Harlan, C. |title=Lay Health Advisor Intervention Strategies: A Continuum from Natural Helping to Paraprofessional Helping|journal=Health Education &amp; Behavior|volume=24|issue=4|pages=413–417|doi=10.1177/109019819702400402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests that the areas of highest health care needs for Latinos in the United States are: 
* Chronic disease management (e.g., diabetes, asthma)
* Lifestyle behavioral change (e.g., smoking cessation, dieting, increased physical activity)
* Cancer prevention/screening
* HIV/AIDS and any other STI prevention
* Injury prevention (especially for farmworkers and those working in construction/ high-injury-risk employment)
* Environmental health (e.g., pesticide education, use of safety measures on the job)
* Mental health

== Impact on different health outcomes ==
An enormous body of research across ethnic groups suggests that early screenings and preventive education reduces poor health outcomes and health expenditures. Studies have shown small and large scale benefits in preventive care for Latinos when promotoras are used as an agent of change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wasserman|first=M. |author2=Bender, D. |author3=Lee, S.-Y. D. |title=Use of Preventive Maternal and Child Health Services by Latina Women: A Review of Published Intervention Studies|journal=Medical Care Research and Review|volume=64|issue=1|pages=4–45|doi=10.1177/1077558706296238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the leading causes of death in Latinos are mostly related to cardiovascular disease, there have been several studies (including randomized clinical trials) that show benefits in the use of promotoras to prevent heart disease and facilitate treatment adherence (W2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brownstein|first=J. Neil|title=Community health workers as interventionists in the prevention and control of heart disease and stroke|journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine|year=2005|volume=29|pages=128–133|doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2005.07.024|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promotoras have also shown to be promising results  among farm workers with diabetes by aiding in the control of glycemic levels and increase social support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ingram|first=M.|author2=Torres, E. |author3=Redondo, F. |author4=Bradford, G. |author5=Wang, C. |author6=O'Toole, M. L. |title=The Impact of Promotoras on Social Support and Glycemic Control Among Members of a Farmworker Community on the US-Mexico Border|journal=The Diabetes Educator|volume=33|issue=Supplement 6|pages=172S–178S|doi=10.1177/0145721707304170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, there has been an effort to address the concern for home pesticide poisoning in the homes of farm working families. A pilot program using promotoras created a comic book to teach children about the risks of chronic pesticide exposure at the same time that they conducted family visits. This particular study showed an increase in knowledge but also one of behavior change to minimize pesticide exposures and poisonings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liebman|first=Amy K.|author2=Juarez, Patricia M. |author3=Leyva, Claudia |author4=Corona, Adriana |title=A Pilot Program Using Promotoras de Salud to Educate Farmworker Families About the Risks from Pesticide Exposure|journal=Journal of Agromedicine|volume=12|issue=2|pages=33–43|doi=10.1300/J096v12n02_04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Training ==

While promotoras are not required to go through extensive and official training they are trained to become health educators on a specific issue. Many promotoras get trained by professional health workers on content areas but are encouraged to develop a plan tailored for their specific community under the supervision of the same or a different health professional. Thus, there are not many entities that “train” promotoras on how to become one but on content specific curriculum. Vision y Compromiso is one of the few entities in Southern California that offers content specific trainings to promotoras.

The '''Secretariat of Health''' ([[Spanish Language|Spanish:]] ''Secretaría de Salud'')
is the [[Ministry (government department)|government department]] in charge of
all social health services in [[Mexico]].
The Secretary of Health is a member of the [[Mexican Executive Cabinet|Executive Cabinet]] and is appointed at the discretion of the [[President of Mexico|President of the Republic]].

In the last years, the Secretariat has played a more restricted role, as many of its functions have been transferred to the corresponding bodies of the States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9061">'''Soy formula''' is a substitute for human [[breast milk]]. It is a commercial product based on the proteins found in soybeans. Soy infant formula uses processed soybeans as its source of protein, and comes in powdered or liquid form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK153456/|title=PROMOTING BREASTFEEDING DURING PREGNANCY – STEP 3|first1=National Center for Biotechnology|last1=Information|first2=U.

Infants who are intolerant of cows’ milk protein may also be intolerant of soy protein. It differs from human breast milk in a number of ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Walker | first = Marsha | title = Breastfeeding management for the clinician : using the evidence | publisher = Jones and Bartlett Publishers | location = Sudbury, Mass | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780763766511 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soy protein inhibits the absorption of iron. The soy-based formulas discussed by the [[World Health Organization]] reports that soy formula is fortified with iron to compensate for this effect.&lt;ref name=whoanemia&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/micronutrients/anaemia_iron_deficiency/9241542497.pdf?ua=1 | publisher = The World Health Organization | title = Preventing and Controlling Iron Defiency Anaemia Through Primary Health Care | date = 1990 | accessdate = 9 August 2017 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170808032740/http://www.jiaci.org/summary/vol27-issue1-num1451 | archivedate = 8 August 2017 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; One naturally occurring plant-based compound found in soy-based infant formula is [[phytic acid]]. It is also a strong inhibitor of iron absorption, though it can be removed in processing. It is not known how many manufacturers of soy-based formula incorporate this practice. China and Vietnam have regulated soy-based infant formulas to include NaFeEDTA (sodium-feric [[ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid]]) to fortify the formula and enhance the absorption of iron by the infant. When iron compounds are added to soy-based infant formula, the iron compound is encapsulated to prevent it from making the formula dark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/guide_food_fortification_micronutrients.pdf?ua=1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808032740/http://www.jiaci.org/summary/vol27-issue1-num1451 |archivedate=2017-08-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constituents==
Genetically modified ingredients may be present in soy-based infant formula. It may also be of lower nutritional value.&lt;ref name=mwalker&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1941406415591208|title=Formula Supplementation of Breastfed Infants: Helpful or Hazardous?|first=Marsha|last=Walker|date=1 August 2015|publisher=|journal=[[ICAN: Infant, Child, &amp; Adolescent Nutrition]]|volume=7|issue=4|pages=198–207|accessdate=9 August 2017|via=Journals|doi=10.1177/1941406415591208|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808032740/http://www.jiaci.org/summary/vol27-issue1-num1451|archivedate=8 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soy-based infant formula can have aluminum, phytates, and [[phytoestrogens]] (isoflavones) that might cause unanticipated effects. Other constituents are amino acids: such as [[taurine]], [[methionine]], and [[carnitine]]. Added minerals are phosphore, calcium, iron, and zinc. SIF also contains soy-isolate that supplies 95% of protein.

==Indications==
Breastfeeding is still the best option for feeding infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1651-2227.2010.02021.x/abstract|title=Soy infant formula: is it that bad?|first1=Yvan|last1=Vandenplas|first2=Elisabeth|last2=De Greef|first3=Thierry|last3=Devreker|first4=Bruno|last4=Hauser|date=1 February 2011|publisher=|journal=Acta Paediatrica|volume=100|issue=2|pages=162–166|accessdate=9 August 2017|via=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1111/j.1651-2227.2010.02021.x|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809132616/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1651-2227.2010.02021.x/abstract|archivedate=9 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are instances when breastfeeding is not possible and the use of formula is appropriate.&lt;ref name= mwalker/&gt;

Indications for the use of soy-based infant formula are [[galactosaemia]] and [[lactase deficiency]]. When a child develops an allergy to cows' milk, soy-based formula is used. SBF is less costly than other breast milk formula substitutes.&lt;ref name=yvan&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1651-2227.2010.02021.x/abstract|title=Soy infant formula: is it that bad?|first1=Yvan|last1=Vandenplas|first2=Elisabeth|last2=De Greef|first3=Thierry|last3=Devreker|first4=Bruno|last4=Hauser|date=1 February 2011|publisher=|journal=Acta Paediatrica|volume=100|issue=2|pages=162–166|accessdate=9 August 2017|via=onlinelibrary.wiley.com|doi=10.1111/j.1651-2227.2010.02021.x|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809132616/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1651-2227.2010.02021.x/abstract|archivedate=9 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = yvan/&gt;

==History==
Past reports of the effects of soy formula have suggested that a constituent of soy formula may affect reproductive functions. However, studies have shown that no correlation exists between the consumption of soy formula and abnormality in reproductive anatomy or function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://jn.nutrition.org/content/145/5/871|title=Compared with Feeding Infants Breast Milk or Cow-Milk Formula, Soy Formula Feeding Does Not Affect Subsequent Reproductive Organ Size at 5 Years of Age|first1=Aline|last1=Andres|first2=Mary B.|last2=Moore|first3=Leann E.|last3=Linam|first4=Patrick H.|last4=Casey|first5=Mario A.|last5=Cleves|first6=Thomas M.|last6=Badger|date=1 May 2015|publisher=|journal=The Journal of Nutrition|volume=145|issue=5|pages=871–875|accessdate=9 August 2017|via=jn.nutrition.org|doi=10.3945/jn.114.206201|pmid=25761499|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822183222/http://jn.nutrition.org/content/145/5/871|archivedate=22 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soy-based infant formula has been used for over the past 100 years. By late 1800s and the early 1900s, supplementation of breastfeeding with formula was acceptable.&lt;ref name= mwalker/&gt; Soy-based formula was used as early as 1909.&lt;ref name = yvan/&gt;

==Allergies and other concerns==
Soy-based infant formula is associated with [[Allergies in children|allergies in infants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674915004303|title=Non–IgE-mediated gastrointestinal food allergy|first1=Anna|last1=Nowak-Węgrzyn|first2=Yitzhak|last2=Katz|first3=Sam Soheil|last3=Mehr|first4=Sibylle|last4=Koletzko|date=1 May 2015|publisher=|journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|volume=135|issue=5|pages=1114–1124|accessdate=9 August 2017|via=ScienceDirect|doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2015.03.025|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808032740/http://www.jiaci.org/summary/vol27-issue1-num1451|archivedate=8 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronic food protein-induced [[enterocolitis]] syndrome (FPIES) has been observed in infants aged younger than three months who were fed with soy formula.&lt;ref name="Nowak-WęgrzynJarocka-Cyrta2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nowak-Węgrzyn|first1=A|last2=Jarocka-Cyrta|first2=E|last3=Moschione Castro|first3=APB|title=Food Protein–Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome|journal=Journal of Investigational Allergology and Clinical Immunology|volume=27|issue=1|year=2017|pages=1–18|issn=1018-9068|url=http://www.jiaci.org/summary/vol27-issue1-num1451|doi=10.18176/jiaci.0135|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808032740/http://www.jiaci.org/summary/vol27-issue1-num1451|archivedate=2017-08-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; France has taken soy-based infant formula off the market. Soy-base formula accounts for about 20% of the infant formula purchased in the US. In New Zealand formula use is around 10%, and in Belgium and the UK and about 5%.&lt;ref name = yvan/&gt;

[[File:Speech Banana no icons.png|thumb|Speech Banana]]
The '''speech banana''' is a region in which all the [[phoneme]]s of the world's languages fall on an [[audiogram]].  An [[audiogram]] is a graphical representation of a person's hearing acuity at a range of frequencies and loudness levels, and it is generally charted with frequency level (in [[Hertz]] on the x-axis and decibel level (dB) on the y-axis.  When the sounds of speech or [[phoneme]]s of all known human languages are plotted on an audiogram, they cluster in a banana-shaped region known as the '''speech banana'''.

People with normal hearing acuity can also hear sounds outside of the '''speech banana'''.   These sounds include ambient natural sounds such as a rustling of leaves in the wind or birds chirping.  Artificial sounds outside of the '''speech banana''' can include music and mechanical noises (e.g., automobiles, lawn mowers).

[[Audiologist]]s are primarily concerned with hearing loss that occurs within the '''speech banana''' because it can slow the development of a child’s language and speech abilities, and this in turn can profoundly interfere with learning. Hearing loss within the '''speech banana''' can also hinder communication capabilities in adults, as in elderly people with age-related hearing loss ([[presbycusis]]).

&lt;!--The chart below contains some English language phonemes and appears courtesy of the American Academy of Audiology.--&gt;

'''Tisleifjorden''' is a Norwegian [[lake]] which lies in [[Nord-Aurdal]] municipality in [[Oppland]] county, as well in [[Gol, Norway|Gol]] and [[Hemsedal]] municipalities in [[Buskerud]] county.  Tisleifjorden is dammed for [[hydroelectric]] power. The height of the lake can vary up to 11 meters. It is {{convert|13.54|km2|abbr=on}} in area and 32.53&amp;nbsp;km around. It has an elevation of 819&amp;nbsp;m above sea level. Tisleifjorden Dam creates a reservoir for the Åbjøra kraftverk hydro-electric power plant at Aurdalsfjord in Oppland. The power plant was built in the years 1949-1951 and was rebuilt in 2002. Åbjøra kraftverk is operated by [[Skagerak Energi]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16989">The '''Tobacco MSA with New York''' is the particular version of the [[Tobacco MSA]] that was signed in [[New York City]], was enabled by means of legislation in New York State, and has been interpreted since then in New York State courts.

==Master settlement agreement==
In 1997, the State, City, and the [[counties of New York]] filed suit against the country's major cigarette manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;See State v. Philip Morris, Inc., 179 Misc. 2d 435, 686 N.Y.S.2d 564 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1998) [http://www.library.ucsf.edu/tobacco/litigation/states/ny]&lt;/ref&gt; The action sought to recover damages related to the costs borne by these various political units of treating smoking-related illnesses and to impose restrictions on the cigarette manufacturers' sales, marketing, advertising, and disclosure practices. Similar actions were brought by 45 other states.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} These lawsuits were settled by execution of the MSA in November 1998.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} The settlement of the New York lawsuit was approved by the [[Supreme Court of New York]] in a consent decree signed on December 23, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;See 179 Misc.2d at 451.&lt;/ref&gt;

The MSA was initially executed by the four dominant (alleged to account for 98% of cigarette sales at the time) cigarette manufacturers, [[Philip Morris International|Philip Morris]], [[Lorillard Tobacco Company|Lorillard Tobacco]], [[Brown &amp; Williamson]], and [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company|R.J. Reynolds]] (the "Original Participating Manufacturers, or "OPMs"), and by forty-six states (including New York), the [[Washington DC|District of Columbia]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Samoa|American Samoa]], [[Guam]], the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], and the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] (the "Settling States"). Thirty-three additional, and smaller, tobacco companies (the "Subsequent Participating Manufacturers" ("SPMs"), or, together with the OPMs, the "Participating Manufacturers ("PMs")) became parties to the MSA.

In general, the MSA imposes numerous restrictions and requirements in connection with the PMs' sales, marketing, advertising, lobbying, research, education, and disclosure practices.&lt;ref&gt;See MSA at 15-37&lt;/ref&gt; It also requires annual payments by the OPMs to the Settling States,&lt;ref&gt;Receipt of settlement payments is allocated among the Settling States pursuant to a protocol set forth in Exhibit U to the MSA.--see MSA at 46-48,&lt;/ref&gt; and releases the PMs from future claims by the Settling States.&lt;ref&gt;see MSA at 11-12, 93-101&lt;/ref&gt; Any non-participating cigarette manufacturer ("Non-Participating Manufacturer," or "NPM") may become a SPM by signing the MSA and making the payments that would have been due had it been a signatory as of the MSA execution date.&lt;ref&gt;MSA at 9, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The OPMs' overall annual payment obligation is specified in the MSA: The nationwide base payments begin at $4.5 billion for the year 2000 and gradually increase to $9 billion in the year 2018 and each year thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;See MSA at 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt; This obligation is allocated among the OPMs in accordance with their relative market shares.&lt;ref&gt;See MSA at 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Annual payments to the Settling States are to be adjusted according to changes in the overall volume of cigarette sales.&lt;ref&gt;See MSA at 48 &amp; Exhibit E.&lt;/ref&gt; A significant reduction in sales will therefore lead to a reduction in payments and state revenue.

===Market share loss provisions===

====By OPMs to other PMs====

In addition to the link between overall cigarette sales and payments to the Settling States noted above, there are provisions for changes in the payments required of particular companies due to changes in their market share. One such provision applies to market share losses by any OPM to other PMs. In general, an OPM losing market share pays less to the states; an OPM gaining market share pays more.&lt;ref&gt;See MSA at 46-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Future payment obligations of SPMs—those arising after the initial payment made upon joining the MSA—occur only if a particular manufacturer's market share rises above the greater of (i) 100% of its 1998 market share, or (ii) 125% of its 1997 market share. Any future payments owed by SPMs are at a rate approximately equal to that paid by the OPMs.&lt;ref&gt;See MSA at 62-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

====By OPMs to NPMs====

Another provision governs the reduction of payments where market share is lost by an OPM to NPMs. This decrease is styled by the MSA as the "Non-Participating Manufacturer Adjustment" (the "NPM Adjustment") and reduces required payments if there are any losses of market share experienced by the OPMs as a result of "disadvantages" arising out of the MSA.&lt;ref&gt;MSA at 49-52.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the contemplated "disadvantages" is price competition from NPMs. Because the NPM Adjustment trebles the decrease in payment obligations when an OPM loses more than 2% due to a "disadvantage,"&lt;ref&gt;see MSA at 49,&lt;/ref&gt; the loss of revenue to the Settling States from an NPM Adjustment is potentially substantial. If the OPM's market share loss exceeds 16⅔%, the decrease in payment obligations is somewhat less than the treble reduction for losses between 2% and 16⅔%.&lt;ref&gt;See MSA at 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New York Escrow Statute==
Under the MSA, the Settling States do not have to sit idly by while their MSA tobacco revenue is reduced over time by competition from NPMs. A Settling State can immunize itself from downward NPM Adjustments by enacting and "diligently enforcing" a form "Escrow Statute"&lt;ref&gt;attached to the MSA, see MSA at 53 &amp; Exhibit B&lt;/ref&gt; requiring any NPM either:
::(i) to join the MSA (becoming a SPM and making future settlement payments accordingly with respect to any increased market share), or
::(ii) on a regular basis to place into a 25-year rolling escrow account funds alleged to be greater than the amount such manufacturer would pay were it a SPM under the MSA.
All of the Settling States have enacted Escrow Statutes.

New York enacted its Escrow Statute on November 27, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;See N.Y. Pub. Health Law § 1399-nn to 1399-pp (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; The Statute provides that any tobacco product manufacturer selling cigarettes directly or indirectly to consumers within New York shall either become a PM under the MSA,&lt;ref&gt;see N.Y. Pub. Health Law § 1399-pp(1)&lt;/ref&gt; or make escrow payments.&lt;ref&gt;see N.Y. Pub. Health Law § 1399-pp(2).  New York's Escrow Statute provides in part as follows:

:::Any tobacco product manufacturer selling cigarettes to consumers within the state (whether directly or through a distributor, retailer or similar intermediary or intermediaries) after the effective date of this article shall do one of the following:
:::::1. become a participating manufacturer (as that term is defined in section II(jj) of the master settlement agreement) and generally perform its financial obligations under the master settlement agreement; or
:::::2. (a) place into a qualified escrow fund by April fifteenth of the year following the year in question the following amounts (as such amounts are adjusted for inflation):
:::::::(i) 1999: $ . 0094241 per unit sold after the effective date of this section;
:::::::(ii) 2000: $ . 0104712 per unit sold;
:::::::(iii) for each of 2001 and 2002: $ . 0136125 per unit sold;
:::::::(iv) for each of 2003 through 2006: $ . 0167539 per unit sold;
:::::::(v) for each of 2007 and each year thereafter: $ . 0188482 per unit sold.
:::::(b) a tobacco product manufacturer that places funds into escrow pursuant to paragraph (a) shall receive the interest or other appreciation on such funds as earned. Such funds themselves shall be released from escrow only under the following circumstances:
:::::::(i) to pay a judgment or settlement on any released claim brought against such tobacco product manufacturer by the state or any releasing party located or residing in the state. Funds shall be released from escrow under this subparagraph: (A) in the order in which they were placed into escrow and (B) only to the extent and at the time necessary to make payments required under such judgment or settlement;
:::::::(ii) to the extent that a tobacco product manufacturer establishes that the amount it was required to place into escrow in a particular year was greater than the state's allocable share of the total payments that such manufacturer would have been required to make in that year under the master settlement agreement (as determined pursuant to section IX(i)(2) of the master settlement agreement, and before any of the adjustments or offsets described in section IX(i)(3) of that agreement other than the inflation adjustment) had it been a participating manufacturer, the excess shall be released from escrow and revert back to such tobacco product manufacturer; or
:::::::(iii) to the extent not released from escrow under subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this paragraph, funds shall be released from escrow and revert back to such tobacco product manufacturer twenty-five years after the date on which they were placed into escrow.
N.Y. Pub. Health Law § 1399-pp (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the statute requires that NPMs who sell cigarettes through a distributor, retailer, or similar intermediary place a per-pack fee into an escrow account that may be recovered by the NPM after twenty years if no obligation to the states has been incurred. The statute thus imposes a per-pack fee on NPM-manufactured cigarettes that adds to the resale price of the product. Although this fee does not expressly require the product to be sold at a particular price, the cost to NPMs of complying with the Escrow Statute is alleged to be higher than the cost to PMs of complying with the MSA.&lt;ref&gt;Freedom Holdings Inc. v. Spitzer, 357 F.3d 205 (2nd Cir. 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==New York's Contraband Statutes==

Effective December 28, 2001, New York passed the [[Contraband]] Statutes. In [[George Pataki|Governor Pataki's]] words, this legislation was needed to "bolster the State's ability to diligently enforce" the Escrow Statute, and thus to "help protect the State from further [NPM] adjustments." To be sold lawfully in New York, cigarette packages need to bear a tax stamp affixed by a New York State [[cigarette tax stamp]] agent. The Contraband Statutes add the requirements of the Escrow Statute to the "gatekeeper" functions already played by tax stamp agents. The Statutes label as contraband any cigarettes made by manufacturers that do not comply with the Escrow Statute. The effect alleged is to impose something analogous to an in rem liability on the cigarettes themselves, rendering them subject to seizure and forfeiture, in contrast to the in personam liability imposed on NPMs by the Escrow Statutes. Twenty-four of the Settling States have passed Contraband Statutes.

The particulars of the Statutes are as follows. Section 480-b requires cigarette manufacturers to certify annually, to the New York State Commissioner of Taxation and Finance, the [[Attorney General of the State of New York]], and the cigarette tax stamp agents (according to appellants, usually wholesalers 6 responsible for affixing New York State cigarette tax stamps on such manufacturer's cigarettes), that such manufacturer is either: (a) a PM making payments under the MSA (i.e. satisfying Section 1399-pp(1) of the Escrow Statute) or (b) in compliance with the escrow requirements of Section 1399-pp(2) of the Escrow Statute.&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Tax Law § 480-b(1).&lt;/ref&gt; Section 480-b also prohibits New York State cigarette tax stamp agents from affixing tax stamps to cigarettes if the relevant manufacturer has not provided the required certification or if the tax stamp agent has been notified by the Commissioner of Public Health that such manufacturer is in violation of the Escrow Statute.&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Tax Law § 480-b(2).
: Section 480-b provides in its entirety as follows:
::::§ 480-b. Prohibition against the stamping of certain cigarettes

::::::1. Every tobacco product manufacturer as defined by section thirteen hundred ninety-nine-oo of the public health law whose cigarettes are sold for consumption in this state shall annually certify under penalty of perjury that, as of the date of such certification, such tobacco product manufacturer: (a) is a participating manufacturer as defined in subdivision one of section thirteen hundred ninety-nine-pp of the public health law; or (b) is in full compliance with subdivision two of section thirteen hundred ninety-nine-pp of the public health law. Such certification shall be executed and delivered to the commissioner, the attorney general and any agent who affixes New York state cigarette tax stamps to cigarettes of such tobacco product manufacturer, no earlier than the sixteenth day of April and no later than the thirtieth day of April of each year, and shall be accompanied by a list setting forth each of the cigarette brands of such tobacco product manufacturer sold for consumption in New York state. Agents shall retain such certifications for a period of five years.
::::::2. An agent may not affix, or cause to be affixed, a New York state cigarette tax stamp to a package of cigarettes if either: (a) the tobacco product manufacturer of such cigarettes has not provided such agent with the certification required by subdivision one of this section; or (b) the commissioner has notified such agent that such tobacco product manufacturer is in violation of section thirteen hundred ninety-nine-pp of the public health law, or has filed a false certification under subdivision one of this section, and such agent has not been notified by the commissioner that such violation has ceased.
::::::3. The commissioner shall prescribe the form of the certification required to be filed pursuant to subdivision one of this section.
N.Y. Tax Law § 480-b (2002).
&lt;/ref&gt; Section 1846 provides for seizure and forfeiture of any cigarettes that are unstamped or have been stamped in violation of Section 480-b.&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Tax Law § 1846(a), (a-1)
:8   Section 1846 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:
:::§ 1846. Seizure and forfeiture of cigarettes
:::::(a) Whenever a police officer designated in section 1.20 of the criminal procedure law or a peace officer designated in subdivision four of section 2.10 of such law, acting pursuant to his or her special duties, shall discover any cigarettes subject to tax provided by article twenty of this chapter or by chapter thirteen of title eleven of the administrative code of the city of New York, and upon which the tax has not been paid or the stamps not affixed as required by such article or such chapter thirteen, they are hereby authorized and empowered forthwith to seize and take possession of such cigarettes, together with any vending machine or receptacle in which they are held for sale. Such cigarettes, vending machine or receptacle seized by a police officer or such peace officer shall be turned over to the commissioner. Such seized cigarettes, vending machine or receptacle, not including money contained in such vending machine or receptacle, shall be forfeited to the state. . . .
:::::(a-1) Whenever a police officer designated in section 1.20 of the criminal procedure law or a peace officer designated in subdivision four of section 2.10 of such law, acting pursuant to his or her special duties, shall discover any cigarettes which have been stamped in violation of section four hundred eighty-b of this chapter, such officer is hereby authorized and empowered forthwith to seize and take possession of such cigarettes, and such cigarettes shall be subject to a forfeiture action pursuant to the procedures provided for in article thirteen-A of the civil practice law and rules, as if such article specifically provided for forfeiture of cigarettes seized pursuant to this section as a preconviction forfeiture crime. Subdivisions (b), (c) and (d) of this section shall not apply to cigarettes seized pursuant to this subdivision.
N.Y. Tax Law § 1846 (2002).
&lt;/ref&gt; Section 481, subdiv. 1(c) authorizes imposition of civil penalties upon any manufacturer or agent violating Section 480-b.&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Tax Law § 481, subdiv. 1(c).
:9   Section 481, subdiv. 1(c) provides as follows:
::: In addition to any other penalties that may be imposed by law, the commissioner may impose a civil penalty not to exceed five thousand dollars against any tobacco product manufacturer or cigarette tax agent who violates the provisions of section four hundred eighty-b of this article, including but not limited to the filing of a false certification, and may seek to suspend or cancel any license which has been issued to such person pursuant to this chapter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9091">The '''Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee''' (TPSAC) is an advisory panel of the [[United States]] [[Food and Drug Administration]] organized to provide advice, information and recommendations to the FDA commissioner on matters related to the regulation of [[tobacco products]].&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/TobaccoProductsScientificAdvisoryCommittee/UCM183978.doc Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ's) about the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tpsac&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/TobaccoProductsScientificAdvisoryCommittee/default.htm Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee]&lt;/ref&gt; It was created in accordance to the [[Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act]], signed into law by President [[Barack Obama]] on June 22, 2009.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/23/us/politics/23obama.html Occasional Smoker, 47, Signs Tobacco Bill], Jeff Zeleny, ''New York Times'', June 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee was inaugurated during its March 30–31, 2010 meeting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/TobaccoProductsScientificAdvisoryCommittee/default.htm Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee] at FDA.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and mission==
TPSAC consists of 12 members, including a chairperson, all of whom are selected by the FDA commissioner from among experts in medicine, medical ethics, science and technology related to the manufacture and use of tobacco products. Nine voting seats are held for academics and practitioners in the field of health care, while three non-voting seats are held for industry representatives. Members serve for overlapping terms of four years.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt; Meetings are held approximately four times per year, with all meetings publicly announced in the ''[[Federal Register]]'' at least 15 days before each meeting.

The Committee's purpose is to review and evaluate safety, dependence, and health issues relating to tobacco products and to provide appropriate advice, information and recommendations to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs on the following topics:&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt;
* The impact of the use of [[menthol cigarettes]] on the public health, including use among children, African Americans, Hispanics and other racial and ethnic minorities
* The nature and impact of the use of [[dissolvable tobacco]] products on the public health, including use by children
* The effects of the alteration of [[nicotine]] levels in tobacco products
* Whether, for any given tobacco product, there is a nicotine level low enough to preclude addiction
* Applications submitted by manufacturers for a [[Modified risk tobacco product]]

==TPSAC Decision on Menthol Cigarettes==
On March 18, 2011 the panel concluded that removing menthol cigarettes from the market would benefit public health in the United States, but stopped short of recommending that the FDA take any specific actions like restricting or banning the additive. A progress report on panel findings is expected in July 2011.&lt;ref name=NYTDuff/&gt;

In March 2011, the tobacco industry released a report to the FDA in response to the TPSAC decision claiming menthol cigarettes are no riskier than regular cigarettes and should not be regulated differently.&lt;ref name=AP&gt;{{cite news|title=Tobacco makers fight menthol rules|url=http://articles.boston.com/2011-03-18/business/29350721_1_menthol-tobacco-industry-tobacco-companies|accessdate=27 July 2011|newspaper=Associated Press|date=18 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427052749/http://articles.boston.com/2011-03-18/business/29350721_1_menthol-tobacco-industry-tobacco-companies|archivedate=27 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. District Court decision from July 21, 2014 ruled that "[[Conflicts of interest]] — whether actual or perceived — undermine the public's confidence in the agency's decision-making process and render its final product suspect",&lt;ref name="JudgeLeon2014" /&gt; blocking the TPSAC report on menthol cigarettes from being used for regulatory purposes.

'''Drinking water supply and sanitation in Ecuador''' is characterized by a number of achievements and challenges. One key achievement is a significant increase in both access to an [[at least basic water source]] (90% in 2000 to 100% in 2015 in urban areas) &lt;ref name="JMP"&gt;https://www.wssinfo.org/documents/?tx_displaycontroller&amp;#x5B;type&amp;#x5D;=country_files&lt;/ref&gt; and [[at least basic sanitation]] (82% in 2000 to 89% in 2015 in urban areas). Significant increases in coverage in urban areas were achieved both by the public utility EMAAP-Q, serving the capital [[Quito]], and the private concessionaire Interagua in the country's largest city [[Guayaquil]]. However, municipalities rely overwhelmingly upon central government investment, rather than recouping the costs at a local level. Another problem is intermittent water supply, which affects half of the urban areas. Also, only 8% of all collected wastewater is being treated. The level of [[non-revenue water]] is estimated at 65%, one of the highest in Latin America. Addressing these challenges is complicated by the atomization of the sector: A multitude of stakeholders&amp;nbsp;– the Ministry of Housing, the Emergency Social Investment Fund, the Solidarity Fund, the [[Central Bank of Ecuador|State Bank]], NGOs, municipalities and others&amp;nbsp;– intervene in the sector. Despite the existence of an Interinstitutional Committee for Water and Sanitation there remains room to improve coordination.

== Access ==
In 2015, around 1.1 million people lacked access to "at least basic" water and around 2.2 million lacked access to [[at least basic sanitation|"at least basic" sanitation]]. (citation needed)


In 2004, water supply coverage (piped on premises) stood at 90% in urban and 67% in rural areas while [[Improved sanitation]] coverage in 2004 was 95% of urban and 79% of rural households.&lt;ref name="JMP2"&gt;[[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]] of [[WHO]]/[[UNICEF]]([http://www.wssinfo.org/ JMP], 2010 estimates for Ecuador&lt;/ref&gt;

Coverage for both water and sanitation services tends to be lower at the coast and in the East than in the sierra. In addition, water supply coverage varies greatly by income, reaching about 90% for the top three income deciles in urban areas compared with levels of only about 60% for the bottom three income deciles.

== Service quality ==
[[Image:Ec-map.png|250px|thumb|right|Map of Ecuador]]
In general, [[Water supply#Service quality|water service quality]] is low in Ecuador. Water supply services are interrupted in 50% of the urban areas. Water pressure is well below standard, particularly in poor outlying areas. In 30% of the urban areas, there is no treatment of drinking water. 92% of wastewater is discharged without any kind of treatment.

According to a study in 2004 about sustainability, 38% of systems in rural zones have collapsed, and 20% are seriously damaged. 29% are somewhat damaged and only 13% are considered sustainable.&lt;ref name="OAS 2005"&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.oas.org/dsd/MinisterialMeeting/CRITERIOS%20Y%20ACCIONES%20EN%20PRO%20CUMPLIMIENTO%20ODM%20AGUA%20Y%20SANEAMIENTO.pdf OAS 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and Recent Developments ==
Between 1965 and 1992, the ''Instituto Ecuatoriano de Obras Sanitarias'' (IEOS) or Ecuadorian Institute for Sanitary Works had been responsible for water supply and sanitation services in Ecuador.

In 1992, the sector was decentralized due to a Decentralization Law and the sector's administration was assigned to MIDUVI, which merged with the IEOS. Many municipalities, in particular small and medium-sized ones, did not dispose of enough capacity for providing water supply and sanitation services. In 2001, the national government began to support those municipalities with technical assistance through PRAGUAS (see below).&lt;ref&gt;For more information about the institutional development of the sector in Ecuador, see {{es icon}} [http://www.eclac.org/DRNI/proyectos/samtac/actividades_nacionales/ecuador/1/taller1.pdf UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibility for water supply and sanitation ==
There are several contradictory policies on allocating the sector's resources within the country. There is no system for information, monitoring and assessment of the sector. Thus, an institutional chaos can be observed which doesn't define limits of responsibility between the institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} Latinosan 2007 - Latinamerican Sanitation Conference: Report about Ecuador, p. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Policy ===
Responsibility for establishing sectoral policy is legally vested in the [http://www.miduvi.gob.ec/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=180&amp;Itemid=142 ''Subsecretaría de Agua Potable y Saneamiento" or Subministry of Potable Water and Sanitation] under the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing. However, there is no clear definition of roles and responsibilities between various national and sub-national actors, nor is there an independent regulator of water supply and sanitation services. Stakeholders in the sector include the [http://www.bancoestado.com Ecuadorian State Bank], the ''Fondo de Inversión Social de Emergencia'' (FISE) or Emergency Social Investment Fund and several governmental ministries at the national, provincial and municipal level, among others.

While [[Ecuador]] has a National Water and Sanitation Policy, [https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:LLrFkxA9RcMJ:www.bvsde.paho.org/bvsacd/curso/Politica.pdf+pol%C3%ADtica+nacional+de+agua+y+saneamiento+ecuador&amp;hl=es&amp;gl=es&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESh6pHSd0X7LwH_4MhuMLBYdMo1NgYLQCOsr7MbIdLsr0AEtWV6YUijYLRjroNMfUzfcf4nOFcv1FRBhu20eF5H9V1tRiz3aEZJuGr4QVaUmjCF-PzfpP3ou9qib5rSHtZb31_RE&amp;sig=AHIEtbSYqrH3wazEDSJuWXeWyldGRPhI5g Política Nacional de Agua y Saneamiento under Executive Decree No. 2766 of 30 July 2002] it is set out in relatively vague terms and avoids a clear position on sensitive issues such as investment subsidies (by national and sub-national governments) and who should receive them.

[[Image:Guayaquil Malecon2000.JPG|right|thumb|350px|Malecón 2000, next to [[Guayas river]]]]
A draft plan for a '''Water and Sanitation Sector Law''' was prepared, but has not yet been presented to Congress, given unstable political conditions.

An Interinstitutional Committee for Water and Sanitation acts as a forum for interchanging experiences in collaboration with MIDUVI.&lt;ref name="Latinamerican Sanitation Conference p. 1"&gt;{{es icon}} Latinosan 2007 - Latinamerican Sanitation Conference: Report about Ecuador, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Service Provision ===
In urban areas, municipalities are directly responsible for delivering the services. They can provide it themselves or through an autonomous municipal utility. In the capital [[Quito]], water and sanitation services in the city itself and the rural parts of the municipality (''canton'') are provided by the metropolitan utility ''Empresa Metropolitana de Alcantarillado y Agua Potable de Quito'' (EMAAP-Q). In Guayaquil, the service was transferred to the private company [http://www.interagua.com.ec/ Interagua] under a concession in 2001. At the same time, the former municipal utility ECAPAG became the regulatory agency for the new private utility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecapag.gob.ec/SoloPortalECAPAG/default.asp?idl=1 Empresa Cantonal de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado de Guayaquil (ECAPAG)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In rural areas, more than 5,000 Potable Water Boards provide the services. Most of them are left to their fate in abandoned conditions, due to very low tariff levels, negligence of care of the water sources and lack of an institution helping water boards since the dissolution of IEOS in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.oas.org/dsd/MinisterialMeeting/CRITERIOS%20Y%20ACCIONES%20EN%20PRO%20CUMPLIMIENTO%20ODM%20AGUA%20Y%20SANEAMIENTO.pdf OAS 2005] and &lt;br&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.eclac.org/DRNI/proyectos/samtac/actividades_nacionales/ecuador/1/taller1.pdf UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Efficiency ==
Potable water supply efficiency is usually measured through [[labour productivity]] and the level of [[Non-revenue water|unaccounted-for water]]. In terms of manpower, the best practices of the region reflect less than 3 employees per 1000 connections. In less populated areas, it can be difficult to determine the number of employees per connection, as services are often bundled by the government with other civic services, but the [[World Bank]] estimates that the number of employees per connection exceeds this in medium-sized towns, with somewhere between 5 and 14 employees assigned per 1000 connections.&lt;ref name=PIDConcept&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/01/06/000104615_20060109102335/Rendered/INDEX/PID060106.txt | title = Project Information Document (PID), Concept Stage | publisher = World Bank | accessdate = 2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Non-revenue water]], which is the difference between produced and invoiced water is also difficult to guess, given low measuring levels in Ecuador. However, at the end of 2001 it was estimated at 65%, one of the highest levels in Latin America.&lt;ref name="OAS 2005" /&gt;

== Financial aspects ==

=== Tariffs, Cost Recovery and Affordability ===

A study commissioned by the government under financing by the [[World Bank]] concluded that nationwide, tariffs covered only about 2/3 of system operation and maintenance costs in 2001. National and sub-national (provincial and municipal) government transfers are required to cover the operation and maintenance gap and to finance coverage expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} ''Plan Nacional de Desarrollo del Sector de Agua Potable y Saneamiento Básico'', G. Yepes, B. Gómez y E. Carvajal, October 2002, realized as part of the first stage of the Adaptable Program Loans of the PRAGUAS project&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning the affordability of tariffs and ability to pay of user, in 1998 households that indicated expenses for water in the national living standards measurement survey, stated that on average they stood at 1.7% of their total expenses. This percentage is higher in urban areas (1.9%) than in rural communities with some basic infrastructure (''rural amanzanado'' - 1.3%) and rural areas with scattered population (''rural disperso'' - 0.9%). Within the poorest decile, this percentage is 1.9% on national average, but 3.3% in urban areas. The expenses include water which is bought from water tankers, but excludes expenses for sanitation.&lt;ref&gt;WHO, "Inequality in Access, Use, and Expenditure in Water in Latin American and the Caribbean: Ecuador" ("Desigualdades en el acceso, uso y gasto con el agua potable en American Latina y el Caribe: Ecuador" (PAHO, February 2001, based on the ECV 1998), p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Investment and financing ===
[[Image:US20-front.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Since [[Dollarization]] in 2000, the US dollar is the official currency of Ecuador]]

Financing for urban and rural water supply investments is provided by a multitude of national and sub-national actors under different terms and conditions. Some favour participation by users and municipalities, but the majority provide assistance without requiring any contributions (''assistencialismo'') in a [[Clientelism|clientelistic]] manner, underestimating the importance of participation to reach sustainability of services.&lt;ref name="Latinamerican Sanitation Conference p. 1"/&gt;

In 2001, an Executive Decree was adopted by the government which created correlation between a tax on telephone calls and government transfers of funds for water and sanitary improvement to municipalities.&lt;ref name=PIDConcept/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Decreto Ejecutivo No. 2562 published on 21 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The level of the transfers is higher for poorer municipalities, and&amp;nbsp;– most notably&amp;nbsp;– higher for those that improve operator performance or choose to delegate service provision to autonomous operators. The system of sub-national transfers thus provides incentives to improve both performance and more sustainable institutional arrangements at the local level.

&lt;/timeline&gt;

From 1990 to 2005, US$409 million were invested in water supply and sanitation at the municipal level. As shown above, the funding reached its peak in 2002, when US$6.1 per capita were spent. However, the average investment p.a. was at only US$2.1&lt;ref&gt;The data were obtained directly from the municipalities, the PRAGUAS program and the ''Fondo de Inversión Social de Emergencia'' (FISE).

== Success stories ==

=== EMAAP-Q, the public enterprise serving Quito ===

The public water and sewer utility of Quito, EMAAP-Q, was turned around between 2000 and 2008, according to its general manager, Juan Neira. In this period water coverage in the city increased from 72% to 98% and sanitation coverage from 68% to 93%. A multistakeholder Fund for Water (FONAG) introduced innovative financing mechanisms to help protect watershed supply regions, promote conservation, and encourage public participation in valuing clean water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pugh|first=Jeff|last2=Sarmiento|first2=Fausto O.|date=2004-07-01|title=Selling the Public on Sustainable Watershed Conservation|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0261-3050.2004.00110.x/abstract|journal=Bulletin of Latin American Research|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=303–318|doi=10.1111/j.0261-3050.2004.00110.x|issn=1470-9856}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company replaced its cumbersome manual billing system with an electronic billing system in 2008 under which an inspector, equipped with a portable computer, visit homes to read water consumption meters and immediately types and delivers the bill to users. [[Non-revenue water]] is said to have been reduced from 47.8% in 2000 to 30% in 2008 through the installation of household meters and the reduction of clandestine water connections.

=== Interagua, the private concessionnaire serving Guayaquil ===

In Guayaquil, the largest port city in Ecuador, the services were transferred to a private operator, Interagua, in 2001. At that time, 50% of the city had only 10 hours service per day. In five years the company brought 24 hours service to all the city and served an additional 55,000 families, mostly low income in the southern part of the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecapag.gob.ec/SoloPortalECAPAG/default.asp?idl=1 ECAPAG La Concesión - Primeros 5 años]&lt;/ref&gt; Access to water supply increased from 64 percent in 2000 to 72 percent in 2003, and access to sewerage has grown from 46 percent to 55 percent during the same period. Families were able to consume twice as much water while paying one fifth of what they paid before, when they bought it from vendors distributing it in tankers and charging $3.50 per cubic meter. Interagua charges only 34 cents per cubic meter for the first 15 cubic meters per month.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Constance, IDB America:[http://www.iadb.org/idbamerica/index.cfm?thisid=2501 A fair price - In Guayaquil, Ecuador, a privatized water service bets that poor consumers will like metered water], November 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

== External support ==
The Ecuadorian government receives external support from several donors in terms of investment and technical assistance in water supply and sanitation.

=== World Bank ===
In recent years, the World Bank has intensely participated in the development of key documents about Ecuadorian policies, including national policy of water and sanitation in 2002 and the innovative decree about transfers to the water supply and sanitation sector of 2005 as well as the draft plan for a Water and Sanitation Sector Law.

The World Bank Group contributed to the PRAGUAS project with a loan of US$48 million, paid by the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]].&lt;ref&gt;

==== Rural and Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Project II (PRAGUAS) ====
Since 2001, the ''Proyecto de Agua Potable y Saneamiento para Comunidades Rurales y Pequeños Municipios'' (PRAGUAS or Rural and Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Project) became the government's primary instrument to face the sector's challenges, influencing key options about policy (see above), extending coverage and giving incentives to improve quality, efficiency and cost recovery of the service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWSS/Resources/ecuador.pdf PRAGUAS Summary] and [http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/main?pagePK=64193027&amp;piPK=64187937&amp;theSitePK=523679&amp;menuPK=64187510&amp;searchMenuPK=64187283&amp;theSitePK=523679&amp;entityID=000094946_00092805302221&amp;searchMenuPK=64187283&amp;theSitePK=523679 PRAGUAS complete documents]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank Water and Sanitation Program Field Note. Lessons from small municipalities in Ecuador-Delegating water and sanitation services to autonomous operators, February 2005, by Franz Drees-Gross, Luis Andrade and Beatriz Schippner, accessed on June 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

To satisfy requirements of quality, efficiency and cost recovery, PRAGUAS offers technical assistance and financial incentives to municipalities which are interested in delegating water supply and sanitation to autonomous operators, such as public or private utilities, cooperatives etc.

Referring to coverage, between 2001 and 2006 PRAGUAS I equipped 252,000 persons with new supply systems and 127,000 people with on-site sanitation (i.e., approximately 5% and 3% of the Ecuadorian rural population of 4.7 million people). In small towns (''cabeceras cantonales''), where water service was interrupted, technical assistance was provided to improve the performance, separating service provision from direct provision by municipalities and increasing operative efficiency, to reach continuous sustainable service of good quality. In view of the fact that designs for more than 600,000 inhabitants (which is 13% of the Ecuadorian rural population) have already been prepared, a fast coverage expansion is expected within PRAGUAS II, which began in 2007 and was to last until 2011.

During PRAGUAS I, among the country's 219 municipalities, 29 have decided to adopt new service models that are different from direct provision by municipalities. 14 have completed the transition process, exceeding the aim of APL-1 (Adaptable Program Loan) of five municipalities, which was established by the World Bank and the national government in 2000. An initial assessment shows that the first group of municipalities, which have delegated their water supply and sanitation services, like [[Cayambe (canton seat)|Cayambe]] (municipal company), [[Pedro Moncayo]] (municipal company, privately operated), [[Pujilí]] (municipal company), [[Guaranda]] (municipal company), [[Caluma]] (mixed company) and [[Echeandía]] (cooperative) have significantly increased their operative efficiency and raised tariffs to at least cover their operation and maintenance costs.

The second stage, called APL-2/PRAGUAS II was approved by the World Bank's board on July 25, 2006. PRAGUAS II is expected to provide the following benefits: i) support for consolidating the framework of incentives for investments in water supply and sanitation, as well as technical assistance to present a Water Law to the congress and the relevant regulations for its application; ii) A group of complementary activities to extend coverage under a demand-driven approach, enhancing hygiene benefits due to the new infrastructure and offering support to water boards aimed at strengthening the system's sustainability; iii) technical assistance and investment financing to improve quality, efficiency and cost recovery of water supply and sanitation services and management of solid waste in small towns; and iv) a communication program to develop support for sector reform.

Until 2011, PRAGUAS II is expected to provide water supply and/or sanitation for 405,000 inhabitants in rural areas, such as the efficient water supply for 220,000 people in small towns and sanitation managed by delegated operators for 120,000 persons. All service provision is done with a demand driven approach, respecting gender, interculturality and environmental care, thus aiming at an effective and sustainable use of the services.

=== Interamerican Development Bank (IDB) ===
The Interamerican Development Bank supported investments in the three largest cities of the country - [[Quito]], [[Guayaquil]] and [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]] - through ten programs with a total amount of US$400 million. In 2006, the IDB approved a new loan in the amount of US$62.25 million for the town of Cuenca.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iadb.org/projects/Project.cfm?project=EC-L1019&amp;Language=English IDB Water Supply and Sanitation Program for Cuenca]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Union ===
PASSE is a program of the Health Ministry for the provinces of the central sierra region, which has received a grant from the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="OAS 2005" /&gt;

=== Belgium ===
Since 2003, the Belgian government has supported the ''Agua Potable para la Sierra Norte'' (APOSINO) or Potable Water for the Northern Sierra region, which is a technical assistance program in the provinces of [[Imbabura Province|Imbabura]] and [[Carchi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.btcctb.org/en/countries/ecuador Belgian Development Agency (BTC)]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International Organization for Migration ===
The [http://www.iom.int/ International Organization for Migration (IOM)] carries out a development program in rural areas and small towns in the northern region of Ecuador, called Northern Border Development Program. The program is financed by [http://www.usaid.gov/ USAID], which has invested US$63m from 2001 to 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iom.int/jahia/Jahia/pid/449#md OIM Northern Border Development Program]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CARE ===
The humanitarian organization [http://www.careinternational.org/ CARE] is working in 15 Ecuadorian provinces, concentrating on rural areas and especially on projects close to the northern and the southern border. CARE works closely with the municipalities. In the last 10 years, CARE has contributed to significantly increasing water coverage under a sustainability-driven approach.&lt;ref&gt;Pedro Carrasco, CARE, Latinosan, November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Small NGOs ===

Numerous small non-governmental organizations (NGOs), such as [http://waterecuador.org/ Water Ecuador] (formerly known as Agua Muisne), [http://yanapuma.org/ Fundacion Yanapuma], and [http://edensrose.org/ Eden's Rose] have addressed the issue of drinking water and sanitation on a local level and have worked with many rural coastal and Andean communities in Ecuador to develop water and sanitation programs where several of the larger organizations listed above have not yet reached.

The '''Weston A. Price Foundation''' (WAPF), co-founded in 1999 by Sally Fallon (Morell) and [[nutritionist]] [[Mary G. Enig]], is a U.S.&amp;nbsp;[[501(c)(3)#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3)]] non-profit organization dedicated to "restoring nutrient-dense foods to the American diet through education, research and activism."&lt;ref name="senate-2005"&gt;{{cite web| last = Fallon | first = Sally |author2=Mary Enig |author3=Bill Sanda| title = Comments to the 2005 U.S. Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee| date = January 16, 2004| url = http://bachlab.balbach.net/wap_senate2005.pdf | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation has been criticized by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for its advocacy of drinking raw milk&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt; and by various nutritionists, including [[Joel Fuhrman]], for its advocacy of the health benefits of animal-based fats.

==Weston Price==
{{Main|Weston Price}}
Price was a dentist from [[Cleveland]], Ohio, whose 1939 book, ''Nutrition and Physical Degeneration'',&lt;ref name="N&amp;PD"&gt;{{cite book| author = Weston A. Price|author2=David Barold |author3=Earnest A. Hooten |author4=William A. Albrecht |author5=Granville F. Knight | title = Nutrition and Physical Degeneration| date = January 2008| isbn = 978-0-916764-20-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the fieldwork he did in the 1920s and 1930s &lt;!-- specific dates? --&gt; among various world cultures, with the original goal of recording and studying the [[oral hygiene|dental health]] and development of pre-industrial populations including tribal Africans and Pacific islanders, Inuit, North and South American natives, and Australian aborigines. The book contains numerous photographs of the people he studied, and includes comparison photographs of the teeth and facial structure of people who lived on their traditional diet and people who had adopted or grown up on [[industrialized food]]. In certain instances it was possible for Price to examine and photograph traditional and industrialized eaters from the same family.&lt;ref name="N&amp;PD" /&gt;

==The Weston A. Price Foundation==
The WAPF has seven board members and numerous honorary board members, most of whom have medical or nutritional qualifications.&lt;ref name="westonaprice.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westonaprice.org/board.html|title=Board of Directors|publisher= The Weston A. Price Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.westonaprice.org/journal/ Wise Traditions in Food, Farming and the Healing Arts]'', Vol.9 No.2 (Summer 2008), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, its membership numbered 13,000 and was growing at an annual rate of 10%, according to ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Black, Jane (2008-08-06) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/05/AR2008080501000.html The Great Divide: Who Says Good Nutrition Means Animal Fats? Weston A. Price.], ''[[Washington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The main sources of support for the Weston A. Price Foundation are the dues and contributions of its members. The Foundation does not receive funding from the government or the food processing and [[agribusiness]] industries. It does accept sponsorships, exhibitors and advertising from small companies by invitation, whose products are in line with WAPF principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westonaprice.org/funding.html|title=WAPF Funding|publisher=The Weston A.

Price Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current sponsors can be seen at the main page of the Foundation's website. The sponsors include grass-fed meat and wild fish producers, as well as health product companies.

The WAPF states it is dedicated to "restoring nutrient-dense foods to the human diet... [and] supporting particular movements that contribute to this objective including accurate nutrition instruction, [[Biodynamic agriculture|biodynamic]] and organic farming, [[cattle feeding#Grass fed|pasture-feeding]] of livestock, [[community-supported agriculture]], honest and informative labelling, prepared parenting and nurturing therapies. Specific goals include establishment of universal access to certified [[raw milk]] and a ban on the use of [[soy]] in [[infant formula]]s. The organization actively lobbies in Washington DC on issues such as government [[food guide pyramid|USDA dietary guidelines]] definition and composition of school lunch programs."&lt;ref&gt;Sally Fallon, Mary Enig PhD., Bill Sanda, ''[http://www.westonaprice.org/federalupdate/testimony/comments_dietaryguidelinesrep.pdf Comments on the Report of the 2005 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee], September 27, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publications===
The WAPF publishes a quarterly journal called ''Wise Traditions in Food, Farming, and the Healing Arts'' in addition to an annual shopping guide which lists products made from organic, non-[[Genetically modified organism|GMO]] ingredients, and are prepared using traditional and artisan methods.

===Sally Fallon Morell===
Sally Fallon Morell is the co-founder and president of The Weston A. Price Foundation. According to the WAPF, she received a B.A. in English from [[Stanford University]] and an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in English from [[UCLA]].&lt;ref name="westonaprice.org"/&gt;

==Dietary recommendations==
{{See also|Diet (nutrition)#Traditional diet|l1=Traditional diet}}

The Foundation's recommendations include the consumption of unprocessed or minimally processed foods including: traditional fats ([[lard|animal]] [[tallow|fats]], [[butter|dairy fats]], olive oil, and [[cod liver oil]], among others), [[organic food|organic]] fruits and vegetables, raw dairy products, soured or [[Lactic acid fermentation|lacto-fermented]] dairy and vegetables (such as [[sauerkraut]]), whole grains (soaked or soured to neutralize their [[phytic acid]]), and [[stock (food)|bone stocks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WAPF: Dietary Guidelines |url=http://www.westonaprice.org/basicnutrition/dietguidelines.html |accessdate=July 25, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715082914/http://westonaprice.org/basicnutrition/dietguidelines.html |archivedate=July 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The WAPF is known for its positive stance towards the consumption of [[saturated fat]]s and [[cholesterol]] from traditional foods,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WAPF: Know Your Fats |url=http://www.westonaprice.org/knowyourfats/index.html |accessdate=July 25, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714112607/http://www.westonaprice.org/knowyourfats/index.html |archivedate=July 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; its support of [[local food]] and farms, and its opposition to veganism and some aspects of vegetarianism.

==Activism==
The Weston A. Price Foundation is a lobbying group that seeks to ban infant soy formula, and advocates a nutrient-dense diet of whole foods, including animal fats. Board of Directors member Kaayla Daniel has released a book titled: 'The Whole Soy Story: The Dark Side of America's Favorite Health Food'.&lt;ref&gt;About The Foundation. [http://list.email.info.westonaprice.org/about-the-foundation.html] Retrieved June 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Campaign for Real Milk===
{{further|United States raw milk debate}}

The Weston A. Price Foundation is a major advocate for the consumption of [[unpasteurized]] milk, or [[raw milk]], in the United States. One of its main goals is to remove health regulations that require the pasteurization of milk products so that raw milk can be legally purchased in all states.  Supporters of this campaign believe the pasteurization process removes or destroys beneficial parts of raw milk, leading to a less healthy product that is associated with numerous diseases such as allergies, cancer, and [[heart disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Real Milk?|url=http://www.realmilk.com/what.html|publisher=The Weston A. Price Foundation|accessdate=July 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control]] and [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] disagree with this assessment, noting that the pasteurization process "does not significantly change the nutritional value of milk" and that consumption of raw milk poses a "severe health risk". They also point out that prior to the widespread use of pasteurization, many diseases were commonly transmitted by raw milk, while they made up less than 1% of food and water contamination disease outbreaks by 2005&lt;ref name="Lejeune &amp; Rajala-Schultz"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lejeune JT, Rajala-Schultz PJ |title=Food safety: unpasteurized milk: a continued public health threat |journal=Clin. Infect. Dis. |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=93–100 |date=January 2009 |pmid=19053805 |doi=10.1086/595007 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/rawmilk/raw-milk-index.html|title=Raw Milk - Food Safety |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The director of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration division of plant- and dairy-food safety, John Sheehan, called the organization's claims on the health benefits and safety of raw milk "false, devoid of scientific support, and misleading to consumers"&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304370304575151663770115120 "A Clash Over Unpasteurized Milk Gets Raw"], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', March 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Farm-to-Consumer Legal Defense Fund===
Established with the help of the Weston A. Price Foundation in July 2007, the Farm-to-Consumer Legal Defense Fund aims to help protect the rights of farmers to provide meat, eggs, raw dairy products, vegetables and other foods directly to consumers. This includes protecting consumers' "freedom of choice to consume raw milk," according to Pete Kennedy, president of the Fund. In the first year of its operation, the Fund raised over $350,000 and receives around three requests for assistance per week from farmers across the United States who are facing legal or bureaucratic challenges, or both in relation to sales of raw milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author = Mary B. Worthington |url=http://farmtoconsumer.org/news/aa-09jul2008.html |title = Fighting For A New Freedom Of Choice |work = [[The Bulletin (newspaper)|The Bulletin]] | date = July 8, 2008 |accessdate =March 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
{{criticism section|date=September 2015}}
[[John Robbins (author)|John Robbins]] has written a critique in which he reviews the history of the Weston Price Foundation and provides evidence that Weston Price had recommended a vegetarian and dairy diet to his own family members as the healthiest diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Robbins | first = John | title = Reflections on the Weston A. Price Foundation | url = http://www.vegsource.com/news/2009/11/reflections-on-the-weston-a-price-foundation.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation has cited Price to the effect that he did not recommend a vegetarian diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westonaprice.org/basics/the-right-price|title=The Right Price|publisher=The Weston A. Price Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-vegetarian and anti-[[soy]] views of the foundation have also been criticized as "myths" in several publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Butler | first = Justine | title = Ignore the anti-soya scaremongers |work=The Guardian |location=London | url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jul/01/anti-soya-brigade-ignore-scaremongering  | date=July 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Oser| first = Marie| title = Soy of Cooking| url = http://www.vegsource.com/talk/soy/messages/126.html | accessdate =July 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also: John Robbins' [http://foodrevolution.org/blog/the-truth-about-soy/ The Truth About Soy]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joel Fuhrman]] has written a series of articles entitled "The truth about the Weston Price Foundation" in which he argues the Foundation is a purveyor of "nutritional myths", largely because they have failed to update their recommendations in light of contradictory evidence.&lt;ref name="Fuhrman"&gt;{{cite web | last = Fuhrman| first = Joel| title = The Truth About the Weston Price Foundation| url = http://www.vegsource.com/articles2/fuhrman_dietary_myths.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quackwatch]] describes the Foundation as promoting "questionable dietary strategies" and Price's core assumptions as contrary to contemporary medical understanding.&lt;ref name="Quackwatch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/holisticdent.html|author=Stephen Barrett, M.D|title=Stay Away from 'Holistic Dentistry'|accessdate=February 11, 2007|publisher=Quackwatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Science-Based Medicine]] evaluated the medical and nutritional claims of the Weston Price Foundation and concludes the website is "one of the worst on the internet" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/sbm-weston-prices-appalling-legacy/|title=Weston Price’s Appalling Legacy|first=Harriet|last= Hall |authorlink=Harriet A.
