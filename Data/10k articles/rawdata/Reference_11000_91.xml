'''''A Dictionary of Arts and Sciences''''' was published in London in 1806-7. It was originally supposed to be edited by Dr. [[George Gregory (British writer)|George Gregory]], [[Prebendary|Prebendary of St. Paul's]]. However, Gregory was too involved in his clerical affairs, so most of the material was written by an anonymous hack writer, [[Jeremiah Joyce]]. As it would turn out, another encyclopedia meant to compete with the ''Dictionary'', the [[British Encyclopaedia]] which was supposedly edited by [[William Nicholson (chemist)|William Nicholson]], was also written mostly by an anonymous hack writer, who turned out to be the same man.&lt;ref&gt;Collison, Robert Lewis. ''Encyclopaedias: their history throughout the ages; a bibliographical guide with extensive historical notes to the general encyclopaedias issued throughout the world from 350 B.C. to the present day.'' New York, Hafner, 1966 pp.175-7&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Dictionary'' itself was published in response to the ''[[Pantologia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Collison p.176&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Munch - Aslak Bolts Jordebog.djvu|thumb|right|200 px|Title page of [[Peter Andreas Munch|P. A. Munch]]'s printed edition of ''Aslak Bolts jordebog'' from 1852.]]
'''''Aslak Bolt's cadastre''''' ({{lang-no|Aslak Bolts jordebog}}; written 1432&amp;ndash;1433) is a Norwegian [[cadastre]], a detailed register of properties and incomes of the [[Archdiocese of Nidaros]].
[[File:Aslak Bolts jordebok.jpg|thumb|left| Aslak Bolts jordebok]]

==History==
Aslak Bolt's cadastre was  a register of land ownership with the Archdiocese of Nidaros. The cadastre comprises more than 3000 farms, with information about scope and volume of income.
The document is originally written on the instruction of archbishop [[Aslak Bolt]] (c. 1380 – 1450), Archbishop of the[[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros| Diocese of Nidaros]]. It was probably completed in [[1432 in Norway|1432]] and 1433, with later supplements and corrections. The properties of the archdiocese included several thousand farms. The records in the land register are arranged topographically by counties within the diocese.  The cadastre is regarded as an important primary historical source, both for historical economic research, and for research of [[place name]]s.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Aslak Bolts jordebok |first= |last= |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |editor-last=Godal | editor-first=Anne Marit | editor-link=Anne Marit Godal |publisher=Norsk nettleksikon |location=Oslo |url=http://snl.no/Aslak_Bolts_jordebok |language=Norwegian|accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Aslak Harniktsson Bolt |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Audun |last=Dybdahl |authorlink= |editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Aslak_Harniktsson_Bolt/utdypning |language=Norwegian |accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|accessdate=September 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original document was  written on [[parchment|pergament]] and is now deposited at the [[National Archives of Norway]]  (''Riksarkivet'').
The information contained in the cadastre  was published by historian [[Peter Andreas Munch]]  (1810 – 1863) in 1852. It was later published in 1997 by the  National Archives of Norway. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =  https://snl.no/Peter_Andreas_Munch_-_historiker|title=  Peter Andreas Munch - historian

'''Attorney-General v Barker Bros Ltd''' [1976] 2 NZLR 495 is a cited New Zealand case regarding the legal concept of certainty regarding contract formation.&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page={{page needed|date=January 2014}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Contract |edition=4th |last1=Walker |first1=Campbell |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71770-X|year=2004 |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reinforces in NZ case law the English case of [[G Scammell &amp; Nephew Ltd v Ouston]] [1941] AC 251.

==Background==
The crown leased an [[airstrip]] in Te Hapupu, [[Chatham Islands]] from Barker Bros for a term of 5 years, with the lease giving the crown a right of renewal. Clause 2 stated "The terms and conditions of any such renewal renewed lease shall be as agreed upon the parties at the time, but the [renewed] rent shall not be less than the amount payable hereunder". Unfortunately, the lease gave no explicit method to calculate the new rent if the lease was later renewed.

However, clause 18, was an [[arbitration]] clause which said "In the case of any difference or dispute arising as to any clause, matter or thing herein contained or implied, or by arising in any way in respect of this deed such difference or dispute shall be decided by ... [arbitration]".

When the crown later tried to renew the lease, Barker Bros tried to substantially increase the rent from $6,750 per year, to $13,000, which the crown found was excessive and refused to pay. Barker Bros, then argued the lease had now ended, whilst the crown argued the dispute should be referred to arbitration, as per clause 18 of the lease agreement.

As a result, the crown sought a declaration from the court to have the matter referred to arbitration, which Barker Bros defended (successfully) that the lease renewal clause lacked certainty i.e. a mechanism to set the new rent, making it an incomplete contract and thus legally unenforceable.

The crown appealed.

==Held==
The Court of Appeal ruled that the contract could be renewed, as the new rental could be set via arbitration, as per the lease's arbitration clause. Barker's previous declaration was set aside.

'''''Church 2011''''' is a [[memorandum]] promulgated by [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[theology]] [[professor]]s, primarily from [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]].  The memorandum, whose full [[German language|German]] title is ''Kirche 2011: Ein notwendiger Aufbruch'', was started in Germany in January 2011. The memorandum is a general demand for reform of the Roman Catholic Church in response to the [[Catholic sex abuse cases#Post-War Germany|sexual abuse scandal among German priests]].

==Description==
The memorandum demands:
# Structures of participation: more participation of all people in the Catholic Church, particularly through election of bishops and priests;
# Parish community: more help for Catholic communities, with a more explicit sharing of responsibilities. [[Celibacy|Married]] priests and [[Ordination of women|women as priests]] should be allowed;
# Legal culture: the Catholic Church should initiate a church jurisdiction;
# Freedom of conscience: respect for individual [[conscience]], particularly for divorced people, who want to marry again, and for homosexual [[civil union]]s;
# Reconciliation: greater reconciliation of the church to her own history; and
# Worship: reform of the Roman Catholic [[liturgy]] (with greater modern influence, and more influence from the cultural life of countries).

{{As of|February 2011}}, over 300 Catholic professors, theologians and other religious scientists from across the world had signed the memorandum.

The '''dakhanavar''' is a [[vampire]] in [[Culture of Armenia|Armenian folklore]] who protected the valley from intruders, first reported by Baron [[August von Haxthausen]] in his mid-19th century account of [[Armenia]] and [[Caucasus Viceroyalty (1801–1917)|Russian Transcaucasia]], the book “Transcaucasia: Sketches of the Nations and Races Between the Black Sea and the Caspian,”.&lt;ref name="haxthausen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Haxthausen|first=Baron August von|authorlink=August von Haxthausen|translator=John Edward Taylor|others=Introduction by Pietro A. Shakarian. Foreword by [[Dominic Lieven]]|title =Transcaucasia and the Tribes of the Caucasus|publisher=[[Gomidas Institute]]|place=London|date=2016|orig-year=1854–55|p=140|isbn=978-1-909382-31-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Dakhanavar follows travelers until they stop for a rest, stalking their every move.  When they finally stop, the vampire attacks them in their sleep, typically going for their feet.&lt;ref name="Jonathan_Maberry"&gt;Maberry, Jonathan. ''Vampire Universe: The Dark World of Supernatural Beings that Haunt Us, Hunt Us and Hunger For Us'', p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt;  The local legend would often attack travelers in the night, sucking [[blood]] from their feet.  In one legend, he was outsmarted by two men who had already heard of the vampire's habits and slept with their feet under the other's head.  The vampire, thinking that they were one being with two heads and no feet, ran from the valley and was never heard from again.&lt;ref name="J._Gordon_Melton"&gt;Melton, J. Gordon (1999). "The Vampire Book", p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Montague_Summers"&gt;Summers, Montague. "The Vampire in Europe", p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The story of the Dakhanavar as documented by Haxthausen ==
{{Quote|text=There once dwelt in a cavern in this country a vampire, called Dakhanavar, who could not endure anyone to penetrate into these mountains or count their valleys. Everyone who attempted this had in the night his blood sucked by the monster, from the soles of his feet, until he died. The vampire was however at last outwitted by two cunning fellows: they began to count the valleys and when night came on they lay down to sleep, taking care to place themselves with the feet of the one under the head of the other. In the night the monster came, felt as usual and found a head: then he felt at the other end, and found a head there also. “Well,” he cried. “I have gone through the whole 366 Valleys of these mountains, and have sucked the blood of people without end, but never yet did I find any one with two heads and no feet!” So saying he ran away and was never more seen in that country; but ever after the people have known that the mountain has 366 Valleys.''&lt;ref name="haxthausen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ianyanmag"&gt;{{cite news|last=Aghajanian|first=Liana|title=Dakhanavar: The Armenian Vampire|url=http://www.ianyanmag.com/dakhanavar-the-armenian-vampire/|work=IANYAN Magazine|date=24 August 2009|accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Jonathan Maberry’s“Vampire Universe: The Dark World of Supernatural Beings That Haunt Us, Hunt Us and Hunger for Us”:

“The Dakhanavar is ferociously territorial and will assault anyone who tries to make a map of its lands, or even count the hills and valleys in the region, correctly fearing that a thorough knowledge of the landscape would reveal all of its secret hiding places.
Even today some travelers in Armenia, particularly those going into the region of Mount Ararat, generally take precautions against evil beings such as Dakhanvar. Often, they put small cloves of raw garlic in various pockets or mash it up and rub the paste on their shoes. At night, if camping out of doors, these travelers build a large fire and toss garlic bulbs into the flames. The combination of garlic aroma and a blazing fire will drive almost all of the world’s many species of vampires away.”

'''Dippy''' is a [[plaster cast]] replica of the fossilised bones of the [[type specimen]] of ''[[Diplodocus|Diplodocus carnegii]]''.  The {{convert|21.3|m|ft|sing=on}} long cast was displayed from 1979 to 2017 in the Hintze Hall, the central entrance hall of the [[Natural History Museum]], in London.

==Background==
The genus ''[[Diplodocus]]'' was first described in 1878 by [[Othniel Charles Marsh]].  The fossilised skeleton from which Dippy was cast was discovered in Wyoming in 1898, and acquired by the Scottish-American industrialist [[Andrew Carnegie]] for his newly-founded [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History]] in [[Pittsburgh]].  The bones were soon recognised as a new species, and named ''Diplodocus carnegii''.

King [[Edward VII]], then a keen trustee of the [[British Museum]], saw a sketch of the bones at Carnegie's Scottish home, [[Skibo Castle]], in 1902, and Carnegie agreed to donate a cast to the Natural History Museum as a gift.  Carnegie paid £2,000 for the casting in [[plaster of paris]], copying the original fossil bones held by the Carnegie Museum (not mounted until 1907, as a new museum building was still being constructed to house it).

==Cast displayed in London==

[[File:A Short History of the World, p0047.jpg|thumb|1922 illustration, with trailing tail]]

The 292 cast pieces of the skeleton &lt;!--another source says 324 bones from three specimens--&gt; were sent to London in 36 crates, and the {{convert|21.3|m|}} long exhibit was unveiled on 12 May 1905, to great public and media interest, with speeches from the museum director Professor [[Ray Lankester]], Andrew Carnegie, [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|Lord Avebury]] on behalf of the trustees, the director of the Carnegie Museum [[William Jacob Holland]], and finally the geologist Sir [[Archibald Geikie]].  The cast was mounted in the museum's Reptile Gallery to the left of the main hall (now the gallery of Human Biology) as it was too large to display in the Fossil Reptile Gallery (to the right of the main hall; now the gallery of Creepy Crawlies).  

Carnegie paid to have additional casts made for display in many European capitals - including Berlin, Paris, Vienna, Bologna, St Petersburg and Madrid; one sent to Munich was never erected – as well as Mexico City and La Plata in Argentina, making Dippy the most-viewed dinosaur skeleton in the world. The cast in London quickly became an iconic representation of the museum, and has featured in many cartoons and other media, including the 1975 Disney comedy ''[[One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing]]''.  

Dippy was taken to pieces and stored in the museum's basement during the Second World War to protect it from [[the Blitz|bomb damage]], and reinstalled in the Reptile Gallery after the war.  The original presentation of the cast was altered several times to reflect changes in scientific opinion on the animal's stance.  The head and neck were originally posed in a downwards position, and were later moved to a more horizontal position in the 1960s.

==Move to Hintze Hall==
Dippy was removed from the Reptile Gallery in 1979 and repositioned as the centrepiece of the main central hall of the museum, later renamed the Hintze Hall in recognition of a large donation by [[Michael Hintze]].  Dippy replaced a mounted [[African elephant]], nicknamed George, which had been on display as the central exhibit in the main hall since 1907, with various other animal specimens.  The elephant had itself replaced the skeleton of a [[sperm whale]] which was the first significant exhibit in the hall and had been on display since at least 1895: earlier, the hall had been left largely empty.

Dippy was originally displayed alongside a cast of a ''[[Triceratops]]'' skeleton, which was removed around 1993.  The tail of the Diplodocus cast was also lifted to waft over the heads of visitors; originally it drooped to trail along the floor.

After 112 years on display at the museum, the dinosaur replica was removed in early 2017 to be replaced by the {{convert|25|m}} long skeleton of a young [[blue whale]], dubbed "Hope".  The whale had been [[whale stranding|stranded]] on sandbanks at the mouth of [[Wexford Harbour]], Ireland in March 1891.  Its skeleton was acquired by the museum and had been displayed in the Large Mammals Hall (originally the New Whale Hall) since 1934.

==Removal and tour==
[[File:Dippy the Diplodocus carnegii on tour at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery in 2018.jpg|thumb|Dippy at [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]], for Dippy on Tour in 2018]]
The work involved in removing Dippy and replacing it with the whale skeleton was documented in a [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] Television special, ''[[Horizon (UK TV series)|Horizon]]: Dippy and the Whale'', narrated by [[David Attenborough]], which was first broadcast on [[BBC Two]] on 13 July 2017, the day before the whale skeleton was unveiled for public display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Dippy_and_the_Whale|title=Dippy and the Whale|publisher=DocuWiki|date=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14765">'''Ecomorphology''' or '''ecological morphology''' is the study of the relationship between the [[ecological|ecological role]] of an individual and its [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ecomorphology|url=http://animals.about.com/od/e/g/ecomorphology.htm|publisher=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "morphological" here is in the [[anatomical]] context. Both the morphology and [[ecology]] exhibited by an organism are directly or indirectly influenced by their environment, and ecomorphology aims to identify the differences &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Norton|first=Stephen|title=The role of ecomorphological studies in the comparative biology of fishes|url=http://core.ecu.edu/biol/luczkovichj/publications/ebof_44_287-304.pdf|publisher=University of South Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Current research places emphasis on linking morphology and [[ecological niche]] by measuring the performance of traits (i.e. sprint speed, bite force, etc.) associated behaviours, and [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] outcomes of the relationships.

Current ecomorphological research focuses on a functional approach and application to the science. A broadening of this field welcomes further research in the debate regarding differences between both the ecological and morphological makeup of an [[organism]].

==Development of ecomorphology==

The roots of ecomorphology date back to the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=BOCKREV&gt;Bock, W. J. 1994. Concepts and methods in ecomorphology. Journal of Biosciences 19:403–413.  [https://link.springer.com/10.1007/BF02703177]&lt;/ref&gt;  Then, description and comparison of morphological form, primarily for use in [[Bird|avian]] [[Classification (biology)|classification]], was focal point of morphological research. However, during the 1930s and 40s morphology as a field shrank. This was likely due to the emergence of new areas of biological inquiry enabled by new techniques. The 1950s brought about not only a change in the approach of morphological studies, resulting in the development of evolutionary morphology in the form of theoretical questions, and a resurgence of interest in the field.&lt;ref name=DEBEER&gt;Beer, G. 1954. Archaeopteryx and evolution. The Advancement of Science 11: 160–170. [https://scholar.google.ca/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=Archaeopteryx+and+evolution+de+beer&amp;btnG=&amp;as_sdt=1%2C5&amp;as_sdtp=#0]&lt;/ref&gt; [[High-speed photography|High-speed cinematography]] and x-ray cinematography began to allow for observations of movements of parts while [[electromyography]]  allowed for observation of the integration of muscle activities. Together, these methodologies allowed morphologists to better delve into the intricacies of their study.  It was then, in the 1950s and 60s, that ecologists began to use morphological measures to study evolutionary and ecological questions. This culminated in Karr and James coining the term "ecomorphology" in 1975.&lt;ref name=KarrJames&gt;Karr, J.R. and James, F.C. 1975. Eco-morphological configurations and convergent evolution of species and communities; in Ecology and Evolution of Communities (eds). M.L. Cody and J.M. Diamond. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. 258–291&lt;/ref&gt; The following year the links between [[vertebrate]] morphology and [[ecology]] were finally established creating the foundations of modern ecomorphology.&lt;ref name=BOCK1977&gt;[https://scholar.google.ca/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=Toward+an+ecological+morphology&amp;btnG=&amp;as_sdt=1%2C5&amp;as_sdtp=#0 Bock, W. 1977. Toward an ecological morphology. Vogelwarte 29: 127–135]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leisler1977&gt;Leisler, B. 1977. Morphological Aspects of Ecological Specializations in Bird Genera. American Zoologist 19(3): 1014–1014.[http://apps.isiknowledge.com/full_record.do?product=UA&amp;search_mode=GeneralSearch&amp;qid=7&amp;SID=4Aj2vqk3NJ1gG7yFnPh&amp;page=1&amp;doc=1]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecomorphology==

===Ecomorphology and functional morphology===

[[File:Pomoxis nigromaculatus1.jpg|thumb|alt=[[Black crappie]] (''P. nigromaculatus'')| Ecomorphological relationships have been demonstrated between jaw structure and the feeding biology of [[Centrarchidae|sunfish]].]]

Functional morphology differs from ecomorphology in that it deals with the features arising from form at varying levels of [[Biological organisation|organisation]].&lt;ref name=BOCKVAN&gt;Bock, W. Van Walhert, J. 1965. The role of adaptive mechanisms in the origin of higher levels of [[Biological organisation|organisation]]. Systematic Biology 14(4): 272–287. [http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/content/14/4/272.short]&lt;/ref&gt; Ecomorphology, on the other hand, refers to those features which can be shown to derive from the ecology surrounding the species. In other words, functional morphology focuses heavily on the relationship between form and function whereas ecomorphology is interested in the form and the influences from which it arises. Functional morphology studies often investigate relationships between the form of [[Skeletal muscle]] and physical properties such as force generation and joint mobility.&lt;ref name=BOCK28&gt;Bock, W., G. Lanzavecchia, and R. Valvassori. 1991. Levels of complexity and organismal organization. Selected Symposia and Monographs UZI. Vol 5 181–212. [https://scholar.google.ca/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=Levels+of+complexity+and+organismal+organization&amp;btnG=&amp;as_sdt=1%2C5&amp;as_sdtp=#0]&lt;/ref&gt; This means that functional morphology experiments may be done under laboratory conditions whereas ecomorphological experiments may not. Moreover, studies of functional morphology themselves provide insufficient data upon which to make conclusions regarding environmental adaptations of a species. The data provided from these studies can, however, support and enrich the understanding of a species' ecomorphological adaptations.&lt;ref name="BOCKREV"/&gt; For instance, the relationship between the organization of the jaw lever-arm system, mouth size, and jaw muscle force generation and the feeding behaviour of sunfish has been investigated.&lt;ref name=sunfish&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Wainwright|first1=P. C.|title= Ecological Explanation through Functional Morphology: The Feeding Biology of Sunfishes|journal= Ecology|volume= 77|issue= 5|year= 1996|pages= 1336–1343|doi= 10.2307/2265531|jstor= 2265531}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work of this variety lends scientific support to seemingly intuitive concepts. For instance, increases in mouth size correspond to an increase in prey size. However, less obvious trends also exist. The prey-size of fish does not seem to correlate so much to body size as to the characteristics of the feeding apparatus.

===Behavioural studies===
The work above is just one example of an ecomorphology based behavioural study. Studies of this variety are becoming increasingly important in the field.  Behavioural studies interrelate functional and eco-morphology.  Features such as [[Animal locomotion|locomotory]] ability in foraging birds have been shown to affect dietary preferences by studies of this type.&lt;ref name=birds1&gt;Moermond, T., and J. Denslow. 1983. Fruit choice in neotropical birds: effects of fruit type and accessibility on selectivity. The Journal of Animal Ecology 52(2): 407–420. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4562]&lt;/ref&gt; Behavioural studies are particularly common in [[fisheries]] and in studying birds.&lt;ref name=x&gt;Sibbing, F., L. Nagelkerke, and J. Osse. 1994. Ecomorphology as a tool in fisheries-Identification and ecotyping of Lake Tana Barbs (Barbus-Intermedius COmplex), Ethiopia. Netherlands Journal of Agricultural Science 42:77–85. Royal Netherlands Soc Agr Sci.[https://apps.webofknowledge.com/full_record.do?product=UA&amp;search_mode=GeneralSearch&amp;qid=2&amp;SID=2CEw5lSyOMvH9HLdDQz&amp;page=1&amp;doc=7]&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies attempt to relate ecomorphological findings with the dietary habits of species. Griffen and Mosblack (2011) investigated differences in diet and consumption rate as a function of [[Gastrointestinal tract|gut]] ecomorphology.&lt;ref name=gut&gt;Griffen, B. D., and H. Mosblack. 2011. Predicting diet and consumption rate differences between and within species using gut ecomorphology. The Journal of animal ecology 80:854–63.[https://apps.webofknowledge.com/full_record.do?product=UA&amp;search_mode=GeneralSearch&amp;qid=14&amp;SID=4Aj2vqk3NJ1gG7yFnPh&amp;page=6&amp;doc=58]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, gut volume was found to correlate positively to increasing metabolic rate. Ecomorphological studies can often be used to determine to presence of parasites in a given temporospatial context as [[Parasitism|parasite]] presence can alter host [[habitat]] use.&lt;ref name=disease&gt;Goodman, B. A., and P. T. J. Johnson. 2011. Ecomorphology and disease: cryptic effects of parasitism on host habitat use, thermoregulation, and predator avoidance. Ecology 92:542–548.[https://apps.webofknowledge.com/full_record.do?product=UA&amp;search_mode=GeneralSearch&amp;qid=14&amp;SID=4Aj2vqk3NJ1gG7yFnPh&amp;page=7&amp;doc=61]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other current work within ecomorphology focuses on broadening the knowledge base to allow for ecomorphological studies to incorporate a wider range of [[habitat]]s, [[Taxon|taxa]], and systems. Much current work also focuses on the integration of ecomorphology with other comparative fields such as [[phylogenetics]] and [[Ontogeny|ontogenetics]] to better understand evolutionary morphology.&lt;ref name="Norton"&gt;Norton, S. F., J. J. Luczkovich, and P. J. Motta. 1995. The role of ecomorphological studies in the comparative biology of fishes. Environmental Biology of Fishes 44:287–304.[https://link.springer.com/10.1007/BF00005921]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications of ecomorphology==
[[File:Ecological niche.png|alt=Simplified representation of an ecological niche.|thumb|Simplified representation of an ecological niche where A and B  show the fundamental niches of species 1 and species 2 respectively. Z the realised niche of species 2 and X the niche overlap, where competition occurs among species.]]
An understanding of ecomorphology is necessary when investigating both the origins of and reasons for [[biodiversity]] within a [[species]]. Ecomorphology is fundamental for understanding changes in the [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] of a [[species]] in which subsets occupy different [[ecological niche]]s, demonstrate different reproductive techniques, and have various sensory modalities.&lt;ref name="Norton"/&gt;  Studies conducted on [[species]] with high [[biodiversity]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;frequently investigate the extent to which species morphology is influenced by their ecology. [[Bony fishes]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; are often used to study ecomorphology due to their long evolutionary history, high [[biodiversity]], and multi-stage life cycle.&lt;ref name="Norton"/&gt; Studies on the morphological diversity of African [[cichlid]]s conducted by Fryer and Iles were some of the first to demonstrate ecomorphology, . This is largely due to cichlids having great [[biodiversity]], wide distribution, the ability to occupy various ecological niches, and obvious morphological differences.&lt;ref name="frye"&gt;Fryer, G. T. and Iles, T. D. The cichlid fishes of the great lakes of Africa: their biology and evolution. 1972. Oliver and Boyd, Cornell University.[https://www.amazon.ca/Cichlid-Fishes-Great-Lakes-Africa/dp/0876660308 ]&lt;/ref&gt; Ecomorphology is also often used to study the [[paleohabitat]] of a species and/or its evolutionary morphology.

===Paleohabitat determination from ecomorphology===

The history of how a species has undergone morphological adaptations to better suit its ecological role can be used to draw conclusions about its [[paleohabitat]].  The morphologies of paleo-species found at a location help to make inferences about the previous appearance and properties of that habitat. Research using this approach has been widely conducted using [[Bovidae|bovid]] [[fossil]]s due to their large skeletons and extensive [[Adaptive radiation|species radiation]].&lt;ref name=Scott&gt;Scott, R. S., and W. A. Barr. 2014. Ecomorphology and phylogenetic risk: Implications for habitat reconstruction using fossil bovids. Journal of human evolution 73:47–57 [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047248414001511]&lt;/ref&gt; Plummer and Bishop conducted a study using extant African bovids to investigate the animal’s paleoenvironment based on their habitat preference.&lt;ref name=Plummer&gt;Plummer, T. W., Bishop, L. C., Hertel, F. 2008. Habitat preference of extant African bovids based on astragalus morphology: operationalizing ecomorphology for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. Journal of Archaeological Science 35(11): 3016–3027 [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440308001453]&lt;/ref&gt; The strong correlation found between bovid [[phylogeny]] and habitat preference suggests that linking morphology and habitat is [[taxon]] dependent. Evidence also suggests that further study of the ecomorphology of previously existing habitats may be useful in determining the phylogenetic risk associated with species living in a specific habitat.&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt;

===Evolutionary morphology===
The study of evolutionary morphology concerns changes in species morphology over time in order to become better suited to their environment.&lt;ref name="BOCKREV"/&gt; These studies are conducted by comparing the features of species groups to provide a historical narrative of the changes in morphology observed with changes in habitat. A background history of a species features and [[Homology (biology)|homology]] must first be known before a history of evolutionary morphology can be observed. This area of biology serves only to provide a nominal explanation of evolutionary biology, as a more in depth explanation of species history is required to provide a thorough explanation of evolution within a species.

===Ecomorphology versus habitat preference===
Suggestions have been made that the correlations between species biodiversity and particular environments may not necessarily be due to ecomorphology, but rather a conscious decision made by species to relocate to an ecosystem to which their morphologies are better suited. However, there are currently no studies that provide concrete evidence to support this theory. Studies have been conducted to predict fish habitat preference based on body morphology, but no definitive distinction could be made between correlation and causation of fish habitat preference.&lt;ref name=chan&gt;Chan, M. D. 2001. Fish ecomorphology: predicting habitat preferences of stream fishes from their body shape. Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.[http://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/27867]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[Government of Ukraine]] has branded the ECM as an extremist anti-Ukrainian organization, convicted of a string of [[vandalism]] offenses and banned it in [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2005/poland.htm|title=Annual report on Antisemitism and Racism, Poland 2005|work=[[Tel Aviv University]]|date=2005|accessdate=July 4, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502185931/http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2005/poland.htm|archivedate=May 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideology ==
According to some observers, the ECM was created as a reaction to the [[Orange Revolution]] in Ukraine and the role the younger generation played in it. It is suggested that ECM represents an opposition to a Ukrainian youth organization [[PORA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Okara|first=Andrey|url=http://www.zn.ua/1000/1550/49482/|script-title=ru:Новая украинская опричнина, или Что общего между 'Порой', неоевразийцами, Иваном Грозным и Юлией Тимошенко?|trans-title=The new Ukrainian 'oprichnina', or What do 'Pora', Neo-Eurasians, Ivan the Terrible and Yulia Tymoshenko have in common?|language=ru|date=March 2005|website=[[Zerkalo Nedeli]]|location=Moscow|volume=9|issue=537|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927194411/http://www.zn.ua/1000/1550/49482/|archivedate=September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early-20th century [[Eurasianism|Eurasianist]] ideology of a part of the Russian emigration and modern [[neo-Eurasianism]] developed by [[Aleksandr Dugin]] has been declared the main ideology of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laruelle|first=Marlène|author-link=Marlene Laruelle|url=http://www.cacianalyst.org/?q=node/4928|title=Neo-Eurasianist Alexander Dugin on the Russia-Georgia Conflict|publisher=Central Asia-Caucasus Institute Analyst|date=September 3, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912174620/http://www.cacianalyst.org/?q=node/4928|archivedate=September 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its ideology also features prominently [[Russian nationalism]] and [[Russian imperialism|imperialism]], calls for the creation of a new Eurasian empire centered on Russia. On its website, the movement declared the West and in particular the United States as its main opponent and termed it as the "main evil": {{quote|Our Union has one absolute enemy. It is the USA. This is the beginning and the end of our hatred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rossia3.ru/katehizis.html|script-title=ru:Катехизис члена Евразийского Союза Молодежи - Евразийство: Глобальный аспект: Наш враг|trans-title=The catechism of a member of the Eurasian Youth Union - Eurasianism: The global aspect: Our enemy|language=ru|publisher=Rossia3.ru|accessdate=September 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In its internal policy, the ECM supports the current government of Russia and in particular its President [[Vladimir Putin]]. Some also claim that the movement receives taciturn support from the Russian government eager to see a movement opposed to a possibility of an Orange Revolution happening in Russia.&lt;ref name="Zerkalo1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Umland|first=Andreas|author-link=Andreas Umland|url=http://www.zn.ua/1000/1600/55389/|script-title=ru:'Неоевразийство', вопрос о русском фашизме и российский политический дискурс|trans-title='Neo-Eurasianism', the question of Russian fascism and Russian political discourse|language=ru|website=Zerkalo Nedeli|date=December 2006|volume=48|issue=627|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706005109/http://www.zn.ua/1000/1600/55389/|archivedate=July 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
In Russia, the ECM has allied itself with organizations like the [[National Bolshevik Front]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rossia3.ru/quotes/1243 |script-title=ru:НБФ станет нам дружественной и братской организацией |trans-title=The National Bolshevik Front will become our friendly and fraternal organization |language=ru |publisher=Rossia3.ru |date=August 31, 2006 |accessdate=September 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Movement Against Illegal Immigration]]{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} and other groups of that type. It organizes and takes part in the annual [[2006 Russian march|Russian marches]] in Russia and other countries of [[Eastern Europe]]. Very often these marches are accompanied by violence, especially in Ukraine.&lt;ref name="Rus"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gorskiy|first=Yuriy|url=http://pzrk.ru/publication/145|script-title=ru:Русский Правый Марш -2005.

After Ukraine's Orange Revolution in 2004, the ECM set up branches in several Ukrainian cities and voiced its sharp criticism of the pro-Western Ukrainian government. The ECM was responsible for a string of attacks on property and organizations they deemed pro-Western. It organised attacks on several [[Ukrainian Security Service]] branches, monuments to [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|Ukrainan Insurgent Army]] veterans and [[Security hacker|hacker]] attacks on the website of the [[President of Ukraine]]. The most prominent of these attacks that received nationwide attention was the desecration of Ukrainian state symbols on Mount [[Hoverla]] in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://novynar.com.ua/politics/10834|script-title=uk:Євразійський Союз Молоді знищив Герб України на вершині Говерли|trans-title=The Eurasian Youth Union destroyed the Ukrainian Coat of Arms on the peak of Hoverla|language=uk|website=[[Novynar]]|date=October 18, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021032436/http://novynar.com.ua/politics/10834|archivedate=October 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://novynar.com.ua/politics/10949|script-title=uk:СБУ встановила людей, які знищили Герб на Говерлі (оновлено)|trans-title=The Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) has identified the people who destroyed the Coat of Arms on Hoverla (updated)|language=uk|website=Novynar|date=October 20, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022040150/http://novynar.com.ua/politics/10949|archivedate=October 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other attack on Ukrainian targets was in Moscow, where several ECM members trashed an exhibition devoted to the [[Holodomor]] (1932–1933), a man-made [[famine]] that targeted Ukrainians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2007/11/17/66997.htm|script-title=uk:Після Говерли 'євразійці' розгромили виставку про Голодомор|trans-title=After Hoverla, 'Eurasians' smashed an exhibition on the Holodomor|language=uk|newspaper=[[Ukrainska Pravda]]|date=November 17, 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204231306/http://www.pravda.com.ua:80/news/2007/11/17/66997.htm|archivedate=February 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the relatively high profile of these attacks the Ukrainian police asked for assistance from Russia in finding people responsible for them, but no suspects have been apprehended yet.
   
The organization's vandalism and sharp anti-governmental stance received wide condemnation among Ukrainian media and provoked a response from different Ukrainian organizations of the opposite orientation. Several threats were made against the organization and its members and an arson attack was reciprocated on the ECM's offices in [[Moscow]].

== Bans ==
In 2011, a Ukrainian court banned the ECM and its leaders Dugin and Zarifullin were declared [[personae non grata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.liga.net/ua/news/politics/566684-sud_l_kv_duvav_vraz_yskiy_soyuz_molod.htm|script-title=uk:Суд ліквідував Євразійський союз молоді|trans-title=The court has liquidated the Eurasian Youth Union|language=uk|website=Liga.net|date=November 25, 2011|accessdate=September 24, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073600/http://news.liga.net/ua/news/politics/566684-sud_l_kv_duvav_vraz_yskiy_soyuz_molod.htm|archivedate=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015, Canada added the organization to its list of [[International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis|sanctioned]] entities.&lt;ref name=CA150629&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pm.gc.ca/eng/news/2015/06/29/expanded-sanctions-list|title=Expanded Sanctions List|location=Ottawa, Ontario|publisher=pm.gc.ca|date=June 29, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150820173127/http://pm.gc.ca/eng/news/2015/06/29/expanded-sanctions-list|archivedate=August 20, 2015|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Briefly, the deceased left a will stipulating that her adopted son would inherit her estate in the event of her death. The will added, however, that, if he predeceased her, her mother would inherit the estate.

The deceased and her son subsequently died in a plane crash, and the Registrar sought an order declaring that they had died simultaneously. This order was granted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="109187">'''''Fleuve Noir Anticipation''''' was a [[science fiction]] [[Imprint (trade name)|imprint]] and [[Collection (publishing)|collection]] of the French publisher [[Fleuve noir]], which encompassed 2001 novels published from 1951 to 1997. Aimed at a broad audience, ''Fleuve Noir Anticipation'' focused on [[space opera]] and topics of popular interest.

The imprint exerted great influence on [[French science fiction]] and launched the career of several noted French writers including [[Stefan Wul]], [[Kurt Steiner]], Louis Thirion, Doris and Jean-Louis Le May, [[Richard Bessière]], [[Jimmy Guieu]] and B. R. Bruss.

==History==
''Fleuve Noir Anticipation'' was launched in September 1951.&lt;ref name=Versins52&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopédie de l’utopie, des voyages extraordinaires et de la science-fiction|publisher=L'Âge d'Homme|year=1972|isbn=2-82512-965-8|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of paperback books sold at a low price but distinguished by sophisticated cover art by [[René Brantonne]].&lt;ref name="Slusser"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Foreword|title=The Anticipation Novelists of 1950s French Science Fiction|first=George Edgar|last=Slusser|publisher=McFarland|year=2010|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topics followed the tastes of the period, with more than half of the titles published in the 1950s and 60s belonging to the space opera genre.&lt;ref name=EssaiRCW&gt;{{cite journal|first=Roland C.|last=Wagner|title=Les Chroniques de la Grande Séparation|journal=Essais sur la science-fiction|year=2009|publisher=In Libro Veritas|url=http://www.inlibroveritas.net/lire/oeuvre26324.html#page_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleuve noir cultivated mostly "house writers", notably [[Jimmy Guieu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=The extremist|title=The Anticipation Novelists of 1950s French Science Fiction|first=Bradford|last=Lyau|publisher=McFarland|year=2010|pages=76–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[F. Richard-Bessière]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=The Moderates|title=The Anticipation Novelists of 1950s French Science Fiction|first=Bradford|last=Lyau|publisher=McFarland|year=2010|pages=31–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; But it also recruited young French-language authors, and motivated thriller writers to try writing science fiction, such as [[Georges-Jean Arnaud]], who published his first genre texts in the series. According to [[George Edgar Slusser]], ''Fleuve Noir Anticipation'' was where the leading French science fiction authors of the 1970s published their first novels.&lt;ref name=Slusser/&gt;

==List of novels==
Numbering the books published under the ''Fleuve Noir Anticipation'' imprint is complicated because some were republished and some were initially published ''hors série'', outside of the series. Lists of the entire series were compiled by [[Roland C. Wagner]] in the last volume of the collection and by [[Alain Douilly]].

'''''The Life of Gargantua and of Pantagruel''''' ({{lang-fr|La vie de Gargantua et de Pantagruel}}) is a [[pentalogy]] of novels written in the 16th century by [[François Rabelais]], which tells of the adventures of two [[giant (mythology)|giants]], Gargantua ({{IPAc-en|g|ɑːr|ˈ|g|æ|n|tj|u|ə}}; {{IPA-fr|ɡaʁɡɑ̃tya|lang}}) and his son Pantagruel ({{IPAc-en|p|æ|n|ˈ|t|æ|g|r|u|ɛ|l|,_|-|əl|,_|ˌ|p|æ|n|t|ə|ˈ|g|r|uː|əl}}; {{IPA-fr|pɑ̃taɡʁyɛl|lang}}). The text is written in an amusing, extravagant, and [[satire|satirical]] vein, and features much crudity, [[scatological humor]], and violence (lists of explicit or vulgar insults fill several chapters).

The censors of the [[Collège de la Sorbonne]] stigmatized it as obscene,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. | publication-place = Chicago, USA | title = Rabelais | publication-date = 1952 | first1 = François | last1 = Rabelais | series = Great Books of the Western World | volume = 24 | others = Robert Maynard Hutchins (editor-in-chief), Mortimer J. Adler (associate editor), Sir Thomas Urquhart (translator), Peter Motteux (translator) | chapter = Biographical Note }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a social climate of increasing [[religious oppression]] in a lead up to the [[French Wars of Religion]], it was treated with suspicion, and contemporaries avoided mentioning it.&lt;ref name="LeCadet09"&gt;Le Cadet, Nicolas (2009) ''[http://crm.revues.org/index11852.html Marcel De Grève, La réception de Rabelais en Europe du XVIe au XVIIIe siècle]'', Cahiers de recherches médiévales et humanistes, Comptes rendus (par année de publication des ouvrages), 2009, [En ligne], mis en ligne le 20 avril 2010. Consulté le 22 novembre 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rabelais, the philosophy of his giant Pantagruel, "Pantagruelism", is rooted in "a certain gaiety of mind pickled in the scorn of fortuitous things" (French: ''une certaine gaîté d'esprit confite dans le mépris des choses fortuites'').

Rabelais had studied [[Ancient Greek]] and he applied it in inventing hundreds of new words in the text, some of which became part of the French language.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, Mikhail. ''Rabelais and his World''. Bloomington: Indiana UP, 1984. p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Wordplay and risqué humor abound in his writing.

==Initial publication==
Although different editions divide the work into a varying number of tomes, the original book is a single novel consisting of five volumes.

==Plot summary==
===''Pantagruel''===
{{Wikisource|Pantagruel|''Pantagruel''}}
The full [[modern English]] title for the work commonly known as '''''Pantagruel''''' is '''''The Horrible and Terrifying Deeds and Words of the Very Renowned Pantagruel King of the Dipsodes, Son of the Great Giant Gargantua''''' and in French, ''Les horribles et épouvantables faits et prouesses du très renommé Pantagruel Roi des Dipsodes, fils du Grand Géant Gargantua''. The original title of the work was ''Pantagruel roy des dipsodes restitué à son naturel avec ses faictz et prouesses espoventables''.&lt;ref name=Boulenger1033&gt;{{cite book | last = Rabelais | first = François | authorlink = François Rabelais |author2=Jacques Boulenger | title = Rabelais Oeuvres Complètes | publisher = Gallimard | year = 1955 | location = France | pages = 1033 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most modern editions of Rabelais's work place Pantagruel as the second volume of a series, it was actually published first, around 1532 under the [[pen name]] "Alcofribas Nasier",&lt;ref name=Boulenger1033 /&gt; an [[anagram]] of ''François Rabelais''.

''Pantagruel'' was a sequel to an anonymous book entitled ''The Great Chronicles of the Great and Enormous Giant Gargantua'' (in French, ''Les Grandes Chroniques du Grand et Enorme Géant Gargantua''). This early ''Gargantua'' text enjoyed great popularity, despite its rather poor construction. Rabelais's giants are not described as being of any fixed height, as in the first two books of ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', but vary in size from chapter to chapter. For example, in one chapter Pantagruel is able to fit into a courtroom to argue a case, but in another the narrator resides inside Pantagruel's mouth for 6 months and discovers an entire nation living around his teeth.

At the beginning of this book, Gargantua's wife dies giving birth to Pantagruel, who grows to be as giant and scholarly as his father. Rabelais gives a catalog of his reading, mostly humorously-titled books, and judgements in nonsensical legal cases. "The lion's share of ''Pantagruel''{{'}}s seventh chapter consists of a concluding catalog attributed to the Abbey of Saint-Victor," states Bodemer in his essay, "Rabelais and the Abbey of Saint-Victor Revisited".&lt;ref&gt;Brett Bodemer. "Rabelais and the Abbey of Saint-Victor Revisited." ''Information &amp; Culture: A Journal of History'' 47.1 (2012): 4–17&lt;/ref&gt;

He befriends hard-partying jokester [[Panurge]]. Together with a group of friends, they intoxicate an army of invading giants, burn their camp, and drown survivors in urine. Epistemon, decapitated in the fray, recovers when Panurge sews his head back to his body. He reports that souls in hell are poorly paid and work bad jobs, but that's the extent of their torments. Another battle is missed by the narrator, who is exploring the civilization in Pantagruel's mouth at the time.

[[File:Gustave Doré - Gargantua.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Gargantua]] and "Pilgrims eaten in salads'', illustration [[Gustave Doré]], 1873.]]
After the success of ''Pantagruel'', Rabelais revisited and revised his source material. He produced an improved narrative of the life and acts of Pantagruel's father in '''''The Very Horrific Life of Great Gargantua, Father of Pantagruel''''' (in French, ''La vie très horrifique du grand Gargantua, père de Pantagruel''), commonly known as '''''Gargantua'''''. This volume begins with the miraculous birth of Gargantua after an 11-month pregnancy.

The labor is so difficult, his mother threatens to castrate his father, Lord [[Grandgousier]]. The giant Gargantua emerges at his mother's left ear, calling for ale, while 17,913 cows were required for the provision of his daily milk. His first garment featured a codpiece whose "exiture, outjecting or outstanding ... was of the length of a yard",&lt;ref&gt;Gargantua and Pantagruel, Rabelais, Urquhart translation, Chapters 1.VII and VIII&lt;/ref&gt; its contents providing so much delight that his three nurses squabble over claims to it.&lt;ref&gt;Urquhart, Chapter 1.XI&lt;/ref&gt; After some indifferent education at home, he is sent to Paris where the crowds so annoy him that he drowns thousands of them in a flood of urine (the survivors laugh so much, the city is renamed "Par Ris").

He steals the bells of St. Anthony, but gives them back after a sophist makes ludicrously self-centered appeals for their return. While he studies diligently in Paris, the neighboring Lord [[Picrochole]]'s bakers are insulted and attacked by Grandgousier's shepherds. A massive retaliatory strike against Grandgousier's lands is finally halted at Seville by the merciless Friar John. Grandgousier sues for peace, but Picrochole arrogantly rebuffs him. Gargantua and Friar John rally the troops and (after Gargantua nearly swallows 6 pilgrims who accidentally fell in his salad) they win a great battle, drive Picrochole back to his city, then overthrow it. As a reward he gives Le Coudray to Gymnaste, Montpensier to Eudemon, Le Rivau to Tolmere, [[Château de Montsoreau|Montsoreau]] to Ithybole, and [[Candes-Saint-Martin|Candes]] to Acamas.

Also as a reward, Friar John is given funds to establish the "anti-church" [[Abbey of Thélème]], which has become one of the most notable parables in Western philosophy. It can be considered a point-by-point critique of the educational practices of the age, or a call for free schooling, or a defense of all sorts of notions on human nature.

===''The Third Book''===
{{Wikisource|The Third Book|''The Third Book''}}
Rabelais then returned to the story of Pantagruel himself in the last three books. In '''''The Third Book of Pantagruel''''' (in French, ''Le tiers-livre de Pantagruel''; the original title is ''Le tiers livre des faicts et dicts héroïques du bon Pantagruel''&lt;ref name=Boulenger1033 /&gt;), the narrative style changes to a parody of the philosophical dialogue, where the earthy [[Panurge]] gets the last word. He sermonizes against moral restraint and in favor of indebtedness, yet accepts Pantagruel's offer to repay all of his creditors.

Now financially solvent for the first time, Panurge stops wearing his long codpiece and seeks advice about whom to marry. Various auguries (opening Virgil to a random page, inducing prophetic dream through half-hearted fasting) and councillors – the Sibyl of Panzoust, the mute Goatnose, the old poet Raminagrobis, Friar John, a group of learned doctors and lawyers, and a fool – all agree that if he marries, his wife will cheat on him, beat him, and rob him. But he egregiously reinterprets their prophecies in a more favorable light.

In a brief interlude, Pantagruel defends Judge Brindlegoose, who has pronounced sentence by rolling dice for 40 years, on the grounds that he is an old idiot and therefore favored by Fortune. As a last attempt to settle the question of marriage, Pantagruel and Panurge take a sea voyage to consult the Oracle of Bacbuc ("Divine Bottle"). Their ship is well-provisioned with the phallic herb Pantagruelion, for which Rabelais gives a ribald natural history.

===''The Fourth Book''===
{{Wikisource|The Fourth Book|''The Fourth Book''}}
[[File:Dingdong and Panurge.jpg|thumb|left|Dingdong and Panurge]]

The sea voyage continues for the whole of '''''The Fourth Book of Pantagruel''''' (in French, ''Le quart-livre de Pantagruel''; the original title is ''Le quart livre des faicts et dicts héroïques du bon Pantagruel''&lt;ref name=Boulenger1033 /&gt;). The whole book can be seen as a comical retelling of the [[Odyssey]], or of the story of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]]. In ''The Fourth Book'', perhaps his most satirical, Rabelais criticizes the arrogance and wealth of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the political figures of the time, and popular superstitions, and he addresses several religious, political, linguistic, and philosophical issues.

The group sails to East Asia and buys many exotic animals. Panurge quarrels with the sheep merchant Dingdong, and takes his revenge by drowning him and his flock. They pass by the islands of the Bailiffs, whose peasants charge to be beaten. During a terrible storm at sea, Panurge is paralyzed with fear but feigns insufferable bravura afterwards. After slaying a sea-monster and being informed of the death of the giant Lent, they arrive at Wild Island, where the half-sausage inhabitants (called [[Chitterlings]]) mistake Pantagruel for their enemy Lent and attack.

The battle is stopped by a divine winged pig, who excretes mustard on the battlefield. They proceed to Ruach, whose people eat air, to barren Pope-Figland where a farmer and his wife outwit the devil, and to the arrogantly Catholic Papimania, where the people worship the Pope and his [[Decretal]]s. After sailing through a cloud of frozen words and sounds, they come to an island that worships Gaster, the god of food. The book ends when Pantagruel fires a salute at the island of the Muses, and Panurge befouls himself for fear of the sound, and of the "celebrated cat Rodilardus".

===''The Fifth Book''===
{{Wikisource|The Fifth Book|''The Fifth Book''}}
'''''The Fifth Book of Pantagruel''''' (in French, ''Le cinquième-livre de Pantagruel''; the original title is ''Le cinquiesme et dernier livre des faicts et dicts héroïques du bon Pantagruel''&lt;ref name=Boulenger1033 /&gt;) was published posthumously around 1564, and chronicles the further journeyings of Pantagruel and his friends. At Ringing Island, the company find birds living in the same hierarchy as the Catholic Church.

On Tool Island, the people are so fat they slit their skin to allow the fat to puff out. At the next island they are imprisoned by Furred Law-Cats, and escape only by answering a riddle. Nearby, they find an island of lawyers who nourish themselves on protracted court cases. In the Queendom of Whims, they uncomprehendingly watch a living-figure chess match with the miracle-working and prolix Queen Quintessence.

Passing by the abbey of the sexually prolific Semiquavers, and the Elephants and monstrous Hearsay of Satin Island, they come to the realms of darkness. Led by a guide from Lanternland, they go deep below the earth to the oracle of Bacbuc. After much admiring of the architecture and many religious ceremonies, they come to the sacred bottle itself. It utters the one word "trinc". After drinking liquid text from a book of interpretation, Panurge concludes wine inspires him to right action, and he forthwith vows to marry as quickly and as often as possible.

The last volume's attribution to Rabelais is debatable. The Fifth Book was not published until nine years after his death and includes much material that is clearly borrowed (such as from [[Lucian]]'s ''[[True History]]'' and [[Francesco Colonna]]'s ''[[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]]''&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Francon, "Francesco Colonna's 'Poliphili Hypnerotomachia' and Rabelais", ''The Modern Language Review'', Vol. 50, No. 1 (January 1955), pp. 52–55&lt;/ref&gt;) or of lesser quality than the previous books. In the notes to his translation of ''Gargantua and Pantagruel'', [[Donald M. Frame]] proposes that the Fifth Book may have been formed from unfinished material that a publisher later patched together. This interpretation has been largely supported by Mireille Huchon in "Rabelais Grammairien",&lt;ref&gt;"Rabelais grammairien. De l'histoire du texte aux problèmes d'authenticité", Mirelle Huchon, in Etudes Rabelaisiennes XVI, Geneva, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; the first book to provide a rigorous grammatical analysis of the matter.

J. M. Cohen, in his Introduction to the [[Penguin Classics]] edition, states that chapters 17–48 were written by another hand using notes left by Rabelais and the general drift of what Rabelais had written of the Fifth Book.

==Analysis==
===Bakhtin's analysis of Rabelais===

&lt;div class="thumbcaption"&gt;An example of the giants' shift in body size, above where people are the size of Pantagruel's foot, and below where Gargantua is hardly twice the height of a human.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
[[Mikhail Bakhtin]]'s book ''[[Rabelais and His World]]'' explores Gargantua and Pantagruel and is considered a classic of Renaissance studies.&lt;ref&gt;Clark and Holquist, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; Bakhtin declares that for centuries Rabelais' book had been misunderstood. Throughout ''Rabelais and His World'', Bakhtin attempts two things. First, to recover sections of Gargantua and Pantagruel that in the past were either ignored or suppressed. Secondly, to conduct an analysis of the Renaissance [[Social structure|social system]] in order to discover the balance between language that was permitted and language which was not.&lt;ref name="Clark and Holquist, pp. 297–299"&gt;Clark and Holquist, pp. 297–299&lt;/ref&gt;

Through this analysis, Bakhtin pinpoints two important subtexts in Rabelais' work: the first is [[carnivalesque]] which Bakhtin describes as a social institution, and the second is [[grotesque body|grotesque realism]], which is defined as a literary mode. Thus, in ''Rabelais and His World'', Bakhtin studies the interaction between the social and the literary, as well as the meaning of the body.&lt;ref name="Clark and Holquist, pp. 297–299"/&gt;

Bakhtin explains that ''carnival'' in Rabelais' work and age is associated with the collectivity, for those attending a [[carnival]] do not merely constitute a crowd. Rather the people are seen as a whole, organized in a way that defies socioeconomic and political organization.&lt;ref name=CH302&gt;Clark and Holquist, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bakhtin, "[A]ll were considered equal during carnival. Here, in the town square, a special form of free and familiar contact reigned among people who were usually divided by the barriers of caste, property, profession, and age".&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

At carnival time, the unique [[sense of time]] and space causes the individual to feel he is a part of the collectivity, at which point he ceases to be himself. It is at this point that, through costume and mask, an individual exchanges bodies and is renewed. At the same time there arises a heightened awareness of one's sensual, material, bodily unity and community.&lt;ref name=CH302 /&gt;

Bakhtin says also that in Rabelais the notion of carnival is connected with that of the grotesque. The collectivity partaking in the carnival is aware of its unity in time as well as its historic immortality associated with its continual death and renewal. According to Bakhtin, the body is in need of a type of clock if it is to be aware of its timelessness. The grotesque is the term used by Bakhtin to describe the emphasis of bodily changes through eating, evacuation, and sex: it is used as a [[Measuring instrument|measuring device]].&lt;ref&gt;Clark and Holquist, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translations==
[[Thomas Urquhart]] first translated the work into English in the mid-17th century, although his translation was incomplete, and [[Peter Anthony Motteux]] completed the translation of the fourth and fifth books. The Urquhart/Motteux version is far from literal, but Urquhart's work was described by [[J. M. Cohen]] in the preface to his 1955 translation as "more like a brilliant recasting and expansion than a translation", although Motteux's contribution was criticised as "no better than competent hackwork... [W]here Urquhart often enriches, he invariably impoverishes". The Urquhart/Motteaux translation is out of copyright, and so it has been used for many reprinted editions, including that of Britannica's ''[[Great Books of the Western World]]''.

William Francis Smith (1842–1919) made a new translation in 1893, trying to match Rabelais' sentence forms exactly, which renders the English obscure in places. For example, the convent prior exclaims against Friar John when the latter bursts into the chapel,

&lt;blockquote&gt;What will this drunken Fellow do here? Let one take me him to prison. Thus to disturb divine Service!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Smith's version includes copious notes. 

Also well annotated is an abridged but vivid translation of 1946 by Samuel Putnam, which appears in a Viking Portable edition that was still in print as late as 1968. Putnam omitted sections he believed of lesser interest to modern readers, including the entirety of the fifth book.  The annotations occur every few pages, explain obscure references, and fill the reader in as to  original content by him excised.  

John Michael Cohen's modern translation, first published in 1955 by Penguin, "admirably preserves the frankness and vitality of the original", according to its back cover, although it provides limited explanation of Rabelais' word-plays and allusions.

Penguin published a translation by [[M. A. Screech]] in 2006 with an explanatory section preceding each chapter and brief footnotes explaining some of the allusions and puns used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Rabelais |first= François |title=Gargantua and Pantagruel |others= Translated by M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6082">The '''Gold Blend couple''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[television advertising]] campaign for [[Nescafé]] Gold Blend [[instant coffee]]. The original campaign ran for twelve 45-second instalments between [[1987 in television|1987]] and [[1993 in television|1993]]. It starred [[Anthony Head]] and [[Sharon Maughan]] as Tony and Sharon, a couple who begin a slow-burning romance over a cup of the advertised coffee. The ads were in a [[serial (radio and television)|serial]] format, with each ad ending on a [[cliffhanger]]. The commercials were extremely popular, and as time went on, the appearance of a new instalment would merit considerable media attention. The ads were developed by [[McCann Erickson]]. They are one of the most famous examples of serialized advertising.

Beginning in 1990, new versions of the ads were produced for the [[United States|American]] market, where Gold Blend was called "Taster's Choice," and the ads were referred to as the "Taster's Choice saga". Head and Maughan reprised their roles, but used American accents in the reshot ads. After the first two nearly identical ads, the American ads diverged into their own storyline.

The campaign was a remarkable success, producing various tie-in products, including a novelization entitled ''Love Over Gold'' by [[Susan Moody]], a video compilation of the ads, and two music CDs. The ads had a notable effect on sales, increasing them over 50% in the UK alone. They have been heralded as a premier example of [[positioning (marketing)|positioning]], creating an atmosphere of sophistication while remaining relatable. They were frequently compared to a [[soap opera]], even sometimes favorably compared to their contemporaries, such as ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'', ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]'', or ''[[thirtysomething (TV series)|thirtysomething]]''. Famously, Head and Maughan appeared on the cover of ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' after their campaign concluded and the two characters confessed their love for each other.

In later years, there were two additional series of ads starring new couples. The second series starred [[Louise Hunt]] and [[Mark Aiken]] and focused on a younger, more career-oriented woman, running for six instalments until 1997. In 1998, a new version with [[Simone Bendix]] and [[Neil Roberts (actor)|Neil Roberts]] began, but the campaign was discontinued after only one ad.

In 2005, the campaign ranked at number 20 on "[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s Best Ever Ads".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thinkbox.tv/server/show/nav.943 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305130459/http://thinkbox.tv/server/show/nav.943 |archivedate=2009-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It had ranked at number 31 in a [[100 Greatest (UK TV series)|similar list]] compiled in 2000 aired on [[Channel 4]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uktvadverts.com/facts/?list=ch4&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13030">The '''''grande commande''''' was a commission ordered by [[Louis XIV]] for statues intended to decorate the ''parterre d’eau'' of the [[Gardens of Versailles|gardens]] of the [[Palace of Versailles]], as initially conceived in 1672. The commission, which included 24 statues and four groups,&lt;ref&gt;All but the "Abduction of Coronis by Neptune" were completed.&lt;/ref&gt; was ordered in 1674. Designed by [[Charles Le Brun]] from [[Cesare Ripa|Cesare Ripa’s]] ''Iconologia'', the statues were executed by the foremost sculptors of the day (Blunt, 1980; Friedman, 1988, 1993; Nolhac, 1913; Thompson, 2006; Verlet, 1985).

Owing to concerns of the effects of the vertical lines of the statues in relations to the garden façade of the château, the statues of the '''''grande commande''''' were transferred to other locations in the gardens in 1684 (Berger, 1985; Blunt, 1980; Friedman, 1988, 1993; Marie, 1968; Nolhac, 1901, 1913; Thompson, 2006; Verlet, 1985; Weber, 1993).

'''Han-Han Dae Sajeon''' is the generic term for [[Korean language|Korean]] [[hanja]]-to-[[hangul]] dictionaries. There are several such dictionaries from different publishers. The most comprehensive one, published by [[Dankook University]] Publishing, contains 53,667 [[Chinese characters]] and 420,269 compound words. This dictionary was a project of the [[Dankook University]] Institute of Oriental Studies, which started in June 1977 and was completed 28 October 2008, and cost 31 billion [[South Korean Won|KRW]], or US$25 million.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Mair, [http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=695 Who Has the Biggest Dictionary?], 9 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hhds"&gt;[http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2008/01/09/2008010961022.html World’s Biggest Chinese Dictionary Completed – Digital Chosunilbo (English Edition)]&lt;/ref&gt; The dictionary comprises 16 volumes (including an index volume) totalling over 20,000 pages.

In addition to the Han-Han Daesajeon, in 1966, Dankook University completed the "Dictionary of Korean Chinese Characters." Composed of 4 volumes with more than 4,410 pages, this dictionary "catalogs Chinese characters made and used only by our Korean ancestors (182 characters) as well as examples of Chinese words with Korean usages (84,000 words)."&lt;ref name="hhds"/&gt;

==History==
With no Chinese dictionaries with Korean translations, most Korean scholars were resigned to relying on Chinese dictionaries in foreign languages to interpret original Chinese texts. Dr. Choong-sik Chang, the president of Dankook University, brought Lee Hee-seung, the leading authority on Korean literature, to head Dankook's Institute of Oriental Studies. Scholars were invited as advisers in 1977 and as editors to start compilation in 1978. Initially, the university foundation turned down the project after financial difficulties, and concerned senior scholars tried to dissuade Chang from compiling the dictionary. In 2009, Dankook University presented the first complete edition of the Han-Han Daesajeon, or the "Great Chinese-Korean Dictionary". 200,000 people worked on the dictionary for 132,800 days, and scholars at Dankook continue to revise and add footnotes to the dictionary. The scale of the existing large Chinese character dictionaries of other countries is as follows: (Dankook University News cross reference)

* ''China's Comprehensive Dictionary of Chinese Words'': 23,000 characters, 380,000 words
* ''Taiwan's Encyclopedic Dictionary of the Chinese Language'': 50,000 characters, 400,000 words&lt;ref name="hhds"/&gt;

==Others==
Classical Chinese character dictionaries are an essential tool for accessing and understanding traditional humanities with a foundation in Chinese literature, not only in Chinese-speaking world but also in Korea, Japan and Vietnam. The first notable effort to compile a comprehensive classical Chinese character dictionary was made by [[Tetsuji Morohashi]] (1883–1982), a Japanese scholar. Tetsuji recognized the need and grew determined to compile a Chinese–Japanese Dictionary while studying abroad in China. Despite his manuscripts being burned in a fire during [[World War II]], his publisher going bankrupt, and numerous other setbacks, after 32 years of collaborative work, the ''[[Dai Kan-Wa Jiten]]'' or "Great Chinese–Japanese Dictionary" was finally completed. Taiwan's Defense Committee followed suit with a 10-year effort, along with the [[Academia Sinica]], to complete the ''[[Zhongwen Da Cidian]]'', or "Encyclopedic Dictionary of the Chinese Language." In 1975, China also made the compilation of a Chinese character dictionary a national project. Collaboration attracted the participation of 43 universities, as well as numerous research centers and scholars nationwide, yielding the 12 volume ''[[Hanyu Da Cidian]]'' or "Comprehensive Dictionary of Chinese Words" in 1993.&lt;ref name="hhds"/&gt;

The '''''Happy List''''' is a list of 100 people in the [[United Kingdom]] "who give back, volunteer, and who make Britain a better balanced, happier country." It has been published annually in April by the ''[[Independent on Sunday]]'', a British national Sunday [[newspaper]], since 2008.

The BBC welcomed the first Happy List as "an [[antidote]]" to the [[Sunday Times Rich List]], a longer-standing institution which is published on the same day.&lt;ref name=bbc2008&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7369452.stm UK's super-rich 'getting richer'], BBC News, 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Following widespread comment in the UK and abroad, the ''Independent'' announced a week later that it would make the Happy List an annual fixture.&lt;ref name=fixture&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/the-ios-happy-list-will-now-be-an-annual-fixture-820870.html The IoS happy list will now be an annual fixture], ''IoS'', 4 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' floated the idea of a Happy List for the United States,&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/wealth/2008/04/28/should-rich-lists-be-replaced-by-happy-lists/tab/article/ Should Rich Lists Be Replaced by Happy Lists?], "The Wealth Report", WSJ, 28 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; but this was not taken up.&lt;ref name=fixture/&gt;

The newspaper accepts that the list is an artificial exercise, but seeks to celebrate people representing much-needed [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], in the hope that they will be seen as [[role model]]s.&lt;ref name=list2009&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/the-iiosi-happy-list-2009--the-100-1671055.html The IoS Happy List 2009 - the 100]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The first Happy List==
The first list included [[Tim Berners-Lee]], the inventor of the [[World Wide Web]], cricketer and fundraiser [[Ian Botham]], and author and philanthropist [[J. K. Rowling]].&lt;ref name=bbc2008/&gt;

Notably, the first happy list also included the character Tinky Winky from ''[[Teletubbies]]'', a popular British children's show.

The ''WSJ'' noted that the list included wealthy individuals such as [[Duncan Bannatyne]], quoting his opinion that "Britain’s rich don’t do enough for good causes."&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt;

It also included ten less well-known people who had featured in [[Gordon Brown]]'s 2007 book, co-authored with [[Community Links]], with a somewhat similar aim, ''[[Britain's Everyday Heroes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.community-links.org/linksuk/?p=28 Independent on Sunday "Happy List"], Community Links, 28 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection criteria==
The Happy List 2010 was published as a supplement in the ''Independent on Sunday'' on 25 April 2010.&lt;ref name=list2010&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/the-iiosi-happy-list-2010--the-100-1953745.html The IoS Happy List 2010 - the 100], 25 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The selection reflected the newspaper's own research, nominations from the public, and recommendations from national organisations including [[Heritage Lottery Fund]], [[Barnardo's]], [[Christian Aid]], [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], [[Save the Children]], [[National Council for Voluntary Organisations|NCVO]] and [[Amnesty International]]. The compilers took care to include some people working only at a local level, as representative examples of [[volunteering|volunteers]] around the country.

They avoided repeating people from previous years' lists unless they had made an exceptional contribution in the preceding 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/the-iiosi-happy-list-2010-1953746.html The IoS Happy List 2010], introductory article, ''IoS'', 25 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Camila Batmanghelidjh]] was included in 2008 and 2009. [[Peter Kay]] made the list in 2009 as "simply Britain's best comedian",&lt;ref name=list2009/&gt; and again in 2010 for also raising funds for [[Children in Need]].

As it would be invidious to attempt to [[ranking|rank]] the individuals, the lists are generally presented alphabetically.&lt;ref name=list2009/&gt; However, six exceptional individuals headed the 2010 list: [[Heather Brooke]], who broke the [[United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal|MPs' expenses scandal]]; [[Brian Cox (physicist)|Brian Cox]] for making science "[[Cool (aesthetic)|cool]]"; [[Kate Humble]], wildlife enthusiast; playwright [[Kwame Kwei-Armah]], bringing wider attention to [[Black British|Britain's black community]]; [[Jasvinder Sanghera]], campaigner against [[forced marriage]]; and Archbishop [[John Sentamu]], "thoughtful and provocative contributor to national debate".&lt;ref name=list2010/&gt;

The 100 in 2010 were not all adults, but include duos, a child, an [[RNLI]] team and a few other organisations.&lt;ref name=list2010/&gt; The 2008 list included fictional character [[Tinky Winky]], followed by [[Thomas the Tank Engine]] in 2009. The second list also included Simba, a [[therapy dog]].&lt;ref name=list2009/&gt;

Relocated from [[New Dorp]].&lt;ref name="map" /&gt;]]'''Historic Richmond Town''' is an authentic town and farm museum complex in the neighborhood of [[Richmondtown]], [[Staten Island]], in [[New York City]]. It is located near the geographical center of the island, at the junction of Richmond Road and Arthur Kill Road.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://www.historicrichmondtown.org&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Staten Island Historical Society]] and Historic Richmond Town are two different names for the same organization, reflecting its long history and evolution.

The original settlement of Richmond Town was known as Cocclestown in the 1690s due to an abundace of oyster shells. The town was later named Richmond Town in the early 18th century when it was formerly a county seat and commercial center, having contained the former courthouse of [[Richmond County, New York|Richmond County]], and is coterminous with the borough of Staten Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of New York|last=Jackson|first=Kenneth|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=51|quote=|via=ProQuest ebrary}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who lived in Richmond Town were mostly of Dutch, English, or French descent, and the most common jobs were those of blacksmiths, shoemakers, and other craftsman types. British troops were stationed in Richmond Town during the [[American Revolution]].

Historic Richmond Town consists of more than 30 historic buildings and sites dating from the late 17th to the early 20th centuries. Decker Farm, located about one mile from the center of Historic Richmond Town, features a farm stand and seasonal activities such as pumpkin picking. The site also contains other former commercial and government buildings, as well as farm buildings and homes, some of which were relocated from other parts of Staten Island.   

==History==
[[File:Former Staten Island Railway station in New Dorp, Staten Island, now located in Historic Richmond Town.jpg|225px|thumb|right|The original New Dorp Staten Island Railway station, which was also relocated from New Dorp.]]
The creation of the museum site at Historic Richmond Town was the result of efforts by many Staten Islanders, led by local historians and preservationists: [[Loring McMillen]], [[William T. Davis]] and local banker David L. Decker. Fueled by the same depression-era passion for historic preservation which resulted in the creation of [[Colonial Williamsburg]], these men wanted to create a testament to Staten Island's rich history in an era of rapid development and [[urban sprawl]].

Established in 1958, Historic Richmond Town is a joint project of the [[Staten Island Historical Society]], an independent nonprofit cultural organization, and the City of New York, which owns the land and the buildings and supports part of its operations with public funds from the Department of Cultural Affairs. 

==Current setting==

The main campus of Historic Richmond Town occupies {{convert|25|acre|m2}} of a {{convert|100|acre|km2|sing=on}} site with 15 restored buildings, offering the opportunity to experience the lifestyle of a 300-year-old community. The two churches located outside the museum site are [[St. Andrew's Church (Staten Island, New York)|St. Andrew's Episcopal]] and [[St. Patrick's Church (Staten Island, New York)|St. Patrick's RC]]. A third church, the [[Reformed Dutch Church of Richmond (Staten Island, New York)|Reformed Dutch Church of Richmond]], was [[Demolished churches in New York City#1800s construction|demolished]]. Mount Richmond Cemetery, operated by the [[Hebrew Free Burial Association]], is also adjacent to the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carse|first1=Kathryn|title=At Mount Richmond Cemetery, Hebrew Free Burial Association maintains dignity in death|url=http://www.silive.com/healthfit/index.ssf/2014/11/at_mount_richmond_cemetery_hebrew_free_burial_association_maintains_dignity_in_death.html|website=SILive.com|publisher=Staten Island Advance|accessdate=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibits==

The purpose of this museum village is to make visitors feel as if they are living in the 19th century. Visitors are able to have a first-hand experience of what Historic Richmond Town once was.

Visitors may take a guided tour of various homes and shops that are fully furnished and restored to specific periods of interpretation; other buildings are in the process of being restored and are not yet open to the public. While Historic Richmond Town is no longer a year-round [[living history museum]] (as it was briefly in the 1980s), demonstrations of historic trades, crafts, and basic household activities by costumed museum interpreters take place during certain special events throughout the year and on a regular basis by reservation for visiting school groups. Special events that are open to the public include the Richmond County Fair, quilting classes, [http://www.facebook.com/tavernconcerts?sk=info Tavern Concerts], Pumpkin Picking at Decker Farm (October), English Country Dancing, Old Home Day, Candlelight Tours, Traditional Dinners, and the Summer Apprenticeship Program.

The [[Voorlezer's House]], dating to c. 1695, is the oldest exhibit as well as the oldest standing [[elementary school]] in the United States. Another exhibit to see is the [[Guyon-Lake-Tysen House]], a Dutch Colonial farmhouse dating to c. 1740.  [[The Christopher House]], a restoration-in-progress which dates to c. 1720, features the only functioning jambless fireplace in New York City. Among the many structures are outstanding examples of Dutch Colonial and Greek revival architecture, such as [[The Stephens-Black House]], the [[John Bennett House]], [[The Britton Cottage]], the [[Crocheron House]], the [[Boehm House]], the Basket Maker's House and the [[Treasure House]].&lt;ref name="map" /&gt;

==In popular culture==

Historic Richmond Town is featured prominently in the documentary ''A Walk Around Staten Island with [[David Hartman (TV personality)|David Hartman]] and Barry Lewis'', which profiles the history and culture of Staten Island. It premiered on December 3, 2007, on [[PBS]] member station [[WNET]], and can be seen in its entirety on the companion website [http://www.thirteen.org/statenisland].

Richmond Town was featured in the third season of the television series [[Boardwalk Empire]]. A 1920s diner and gas station were constructed and shot on location. These sets were shown in the shows third season, which aired in fall of 2012 on [[HBO]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

==Access==

Visitors can reach Richmond Town via public transportation by taking the [http://www.mta.info/nyct/service/bus/sisch.htm S74 Arthur Kill Road bus] from the St. George Ferry Terminal. The ride from the ferry terminal takes about 37 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;http://mta.info/&lt;/ref&gt; The S54 Manor Road bus also provides local service on weekdays.

The '''International Slavery Museum''' is a museum located in [[Liverpool]], England that focuses on the history and legacy of the [[transatlantic slave trade]]. The museum which forms part of the [[Merseyside Maritime Museum]], consists of three main galleries which focus on the lives of people in West Africa, their eventual enslavement, and their continued fight for freedom. Additionally the museum discusses [[contemporary slavery|slavery in the modern day]] as well as topics on [[racism]] and [[discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/ism/about/index.aspx|title=About the International Slavery Museum|last=|first=|date=|website=International Slavery Museum|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally part of the [[Merseyside Maritime Museum]] which opened in 1980, the history of the slave trade was originally discussed as part of the city's maritime history shortly before a dedicated Transatlantic Slavery gallery was created in 1994 to better explore Liverpool's historic role in the slave trade. By the early 2000s international interest in the exhibition and a high volume of visitors led to the decision for a museum specially dedicated to the history of slavery to be set up so as to better explain slavery and its legacy.

The new museum opened on 23 August 2007, the date of the annual [[International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition]] marking the beginning of the slave uprising in [[Santo Domingo]]. The year 2007 was particularly significant as it was the bicentenary of the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom's]] [[Slave Trade Act 1807|Slave Trade Act of 1807]], which abolished the slave trade (though not [[slavery]] itself) inside the British Empire. The [[Merseyside Maritime Museum]] used to house a Transatlantic Slavery Gallery. Phase 1 of the International Slavery Museum involved relocating current exhibitions to the third floor of the museum and adding new displays, which doubled the space dedicated to the subject.  
{{Slavery}}
New displays incorporate the latest historical research but also cover wider issues of the legacy of transatlantic slavery, and its contemporary relevance. Topics such as freedom and identity, social justice and human rights, underdevelopment in Africa and the Caribbean, racial discrimination and injustice and the transformation of British and other cultures are covered.

The East Gallery features approximately 400 annotated songs pertaining to the experience of slavery and the music of Africa and the slave-descended African diaspora.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 2007, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

National Museums Liverpool say the new gallery focuses on the experience of individuals, using the [[Slave narrative|narratives of enslaved]] and those involved in the trade. They include a shrine to the ancestors of the enslaved as a quiet area for contemplation and reflection.

The second phase planned is the development of a new visitor-focused resource centre with an events programme of performance, public lectures and debate. The centre will have a research facility for visiting scholars to work and access to National Museums Liverpool's archive collections. A digital archive of material related to the transatlantic slave trade will be available.

To enable phase two of the project National Museums Liverpool has acquired the former Dock Traffic Office, which adjoins the Maritime Museum. The two buildings are to be linked.  The Dock Traffic building was formerly occupied by ITV's [[Granada Television]].

The museum was awarded £50,000 in March 2018 to buy and restore the painting 'Am Not I A Man and a Brother'. The painting dates from around 1800 and is based upon a design commissioned by the [[Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade]]. The image is considered to be one of the first instances of a logo designed for a political cause, and was used on the pottery of [[Josiah Wedgwood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum awarded £50k - National Museums Liverpool, Liverpool museums, Liverpool museums|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/about/mediacentre/2018/museum-awarded-50k.aspx|website=www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
There is a section about life and culture in West Africa before the [[transatlantic slave trade]], the [[history of slavery]] and also displays and special exhibitions about the legacies of slavery and current human rights issues.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3507">The '''Kaluli creation myth''' is a traditional [[creation myth]] of the [[Kaluli]] people of [[Papua New Guinea]].  In the version as was recorded by anthropologist and ethnographer [[Edward L. Shieffelin]] whose first contact with them took place in the late 1960s. The story begins in a time the Kaluli call ''hena madaliaki'', which translates "when the land came into form." During the time of ''hena madaliaki'' people covered the earth but there was nothing else: no trees or plants, no animals, and no streams.  With nothing to use for food or shelter, the people became cold and hungry.  Then one man among them (alternative accounts give two) gathered everyone together and delegated different tasks.  He directed one group to become trees and they did.  He directed another to become [[sago]], yet another to be fish, another banana and so forth until the world was brimming with animals, food, streams, mountains and all other natural features.  There were only a few people left and they became the ancestors of present-day human beings.&lt;ref name=els&gt;{{cite book |title=The sorrow of the lonely and the burning of the dancers |first=Edward L. |last=Shieffelin |publisher=Macmillan |year=2005 |isbn= 1-4039-6606-0 |edition=2nd, illustrated |pages=93–94 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SAJ&gt;{{cite book |title=Religion, Myth, and Magic: The Anthropology of Religion-a Course Guide |last=Johnston |first=Susan A. |publisher=[[Recorded Books]], LLC |isbn=978-1-4407-2603-3 |year=2009 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kaluli describe this story as "the time when everything ''alə bano ane''" which means roughly "the time when everything divided".  This concept of all world phenomena as a result of a "splitting" has many echos in Kaluli thought and cultural practices.  In the Kaluli world view, all of existence is made from people who differentiated into different forms.  Animals, plants, streams and people are all the same except in the form they have assumed following this great split.  Death is another splitting.  The Kaluli have no concept of a transcendent, sacred domain that is spiritual or in any fundamental way distinct from the natural, material world; instead death is another event that divides beings through the acquisition of new forms which are unrecognizable to the living.&lt;ref name=els&gt;{{cite book |title=The sorrow of the lonely and the burning of the dancers |first=Edward L. |last=Shieffelin |publisher=Macmillan |year=2005 |isbn= 1-4039-6606-0 |edition=2nd, illustrated |pages=93–94 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SAJ/&gt;

The Kaluli are an indigenous people whose first contact with contemporary western civilization began in the 1940s.  Following extensive [[Christian missionary]] efforts in the region, variants of the traditional creation story have adopted a few Christian elements.  Prior to contact, the Kaluli story described creation as a pragmatic solution to problems of cold and hunger, and the efforts were initiated by one or two ordinary and unnamed men rather than any deity or deities. The Kaluli have since tended to identify one or both of them as "Godeyo" ([[God]]) and "Yesu" ([[Jesus Christ]]).&lt;ref name=els&gt;{{cite book |title=The sorrow of the lonely and the burning of the dancers |first=Edward L. |last=Shieffelin |publisher=Macmillan |year=2005 |isbn= 1-4039-6606-0 |edition=2nd, illustrated |pages=93–94 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SAJ/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2868">In [[mathematics]], the '''[[Lefschetz]] [[zeta function|zeta-function]]''' is a tool used in topological periodic and [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] theory, and [[dynamical systems]]. Given a [[continuous map]] &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to X&lt;/math&gt;, the zeta-function is defined as the formal series

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta_f(z) = \exp \left( \sum_{n=1}^\infty L(f^n) \frac{z^n}{n} \right), &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;L(f^n)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lefschetz number]] of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th [[iterated function|iterate]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. This zeta-function is of note in topological periodic point theory because it is a single invariant containing information about all iterates of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==
The identity map on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; has Lefschetz zeta function

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{(1-t)^{\chi(X)}},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\chi(X)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Euler characteristic]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the Lefschetz number of the identity map.

For a less trivial example, let &lt;math&gt;X = S^1&lt;/math&gt; be the [[unit circle]], and let &lt;math&gt;f\colon S^1\to S^1&lt;/math&gt; be reflection in the ''x''-axis, that is, &lt;math&gt;f(\theta) = -\theta&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has Lefschetz number 2, while &lt;math&gt;f^2&lt;/math&gt; is the identity map, which has Lefschetz number 0. Likewise, all odd iterates have Lefschetz number 2, while all even iterates have Lefschetz number 0. Therefore, the zeta function of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\zeta_f(t) &amp; = \exp \left( \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{2t^{2n+1}}{2n+1} \right) \\
&amp;=\exp \left( \left\{2\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{t^n}{n}\right\} -\left \{2 \sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{t^{2n}}{2n}\right\} \right) \\
&amp;=\exp \left(-2\log(1-t)+\log(1-t^2)\right)\\
&amp;=\frac{1-t^2}{(1-t)^2} \\
&amp;=\frac{1+t}{1-t}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== Formula ==
If ''f'' is a continuous map on a compact manifold ''X'' of dimension ''n'' (or more generally any compact polyhedron), the zeta function is given by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta_f(t)=\prod_{i=0}^{n}\det(1-t f_\ast|H_i(X,\mathbf{Q}))^{(-1)^{i+1}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus it is a rational function. The polynomials occurring in the numerator and denominator are essentially the characteristic polynomials of the map induced by ''f'' on the various homology spaces.

==Connections ==
This generating function is essentially an [[algebra]]ic form of the [[Artin–Mazur zeta function]], which gives [[geometry|geometric]] information about the fixed and periodic points of ''f''.

A '''legal release''' is a [[legal instrument]] that acts to terminate any legal [[legal liability|liability]] between the releasor and the releasee(s), signed by the releasor. A release may also be made orally in some circumstances.  Releases are routinely used by [[photographer]]s, in [[film production]], by [[Documentary film|documentary]] [[filmmaker]]s, or by [[radio]] and [[music]] [[Record producer|producer]]s when they photograph, film, video or record the voice or performance of individuals to be sure that the person consents or will not later object to the material being used for whatever purpose the release (or anyone they may assign the release rights to) wishes, i.e. that the [[wikt:release|release]] wishes to use the images, sounds or any other rendering that is a result of the recording made of the releasor (or property owned by the releasor for which the releasor may claim some other right such as [[industrial design rights]], [[trademark]] or [[trade dress]] rights). This will help in insuring the [[copyright]] owner has a clean [[chain of title]] for any work if it is later published, broadcast, shown in a public cinema or otherwise made public.

Releases are very often used to ensure that [[litigation]] is terminated when a settlement or [[compromise]] between the [[plaintiff]](s) and [[defendant]](s) is reached.  A general release may release any claims known or unknown that the releasor may have against the releasee.  The release may also be very specific, i.e. dealing with specific acts between the parties and not applying to any other acts.

Generally a release is of the form: 

::''For good and valuable [[consideration]], the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, I, the releasor, release the releasee for any and all claims I may have against the releasee up to the date of the signing of this release [relating to or arising from _____________].''



::::/signed/

However, most releases are much more detailed in the recitation of what is being released and the extent of the release (where it is valid, when it become valid if there are conditions on its validity, the amount of consideration if it is substantial) and they are either copied and modified as necessary from various form books or drafting manuals used by lawyers or are preprinted forms that are purchased from legal form publishers.

Releases should be drafted by a [[lawyer]], [[solicitor]] or [[civil law notary]] (not in the United States), except perhaps in the most routine of situations; if the release is not correctly drafted or does not recite any necessary limitations the releasee may find out later that the release did not cover all circumstances, and the releasor may find that the release was too general and released some claim, right or entitlement that the releasor should have retained.

== Examples ==
*[[Current TV]] has a number of release forms for viewer created content. [http://current.com/producerResources.htm]
*[[English Wikipedia]] provides a template for users wishing to release all rights to their images. [[Template:No rights reserved]]

The success of a film is assessed by trade publications (such as [[Box Office Mojo]] and ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'') primarily by its theatrical box office earnings. Although several other revenue streams also generate revenue (such as theatrical exhibition, [[home video]], television broadcast rights and merchandising) theatrical box office earnings take prominence, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. The success at the box office is measured in a number of ways, and these look at both the total gross as well as the speed with which that gross is attained. This list focuses on the latter. Included on this list are charts showing the films that reached certain milestones in the fastest time. All charts are ranked first by the number of days they took to reach the milestone, and second by their total gross on the day they exceeded the milestone. The charts are not adjusted for inflation, which does erode the achievements of earlier films.

==Fastest-grossing films – worldwide==
===Fastest to $500&amp;nbsp;million===
By 1980, ''[[Star Wars]]'' became the first movie to reach a $500 million worldwide gross (not adjusting for inflation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ro/books?id=aD1EBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA173&amp;lpg=PA173#v=onepage&amp;q=500%20million&amp;f=false|title=Contemporary American Cinema|last=Ruth|first=Williams , Linda|last2=Michael|first2=Hammond|date=2006-05-01|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (UK)|isbn=9780335228430|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=4th August 2010 |url=http://www.moviemuser.co.uk/2010/08/04/what-films-have-held-the-highest-grossing-movie-ever-record-movie-a-day-et-the-extra-terrestrial/ |title=What Films Have Held The Highest Grossing Movie Ever Record? - Movie-A-Day: ET: The Extra Terrestrial |publisher=Movie Muser |date=2010-08-04 |accessdate=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, close to 200 films have grossed over $500&amp;nbsp;million worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/world/?pagenum=2&amp;p=.htm|title=All Time Worldwide Box Office Grosses|website=www.boxofficemojo.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list below is restricted to the 10 movies that passed the threshold the fastest, not taking into account early, single-show premieres.

==Fastest-grossing films – US and Canada==
&lt;!--Note that films have a "close date" at Box Office Mojo.--&gt;
&lt;!--When updating grosses, please update the access date in the reference!--&gt;

Figures listed here don't take into account dates for limited-release premieres, but they do take into account the grosses from the "midnight showings" that occur the day before the "official opening day".{{efn|For example, ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' premiered on December 14, 2015 at three locations.&lt;ref name=premiere&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/star-wars-premiere-preparation-1201659677/|title='Star Wars' Premiere: Fans, Security to Bring the Force|last1=Rainey|first1=James|last2=Sage|first2=Alyssa|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=December 11, 2015|accessdate=December 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it officially opened in North America on Friday, December 18.  However, "midnight" shows occurred late on Thursday, and they totaled up to $57M.}}

On this series of charts, films are ranked first by the number of days they took to reach the milestone, and second by their total gross on the day they exceeded the milestone. The milestones used by trade publications such as [[Box Office Mojo]] or [[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]], are multiples of $50&amp;nbsp;million. Therefore, the charts below reflect these milestones. Note that in the case of a tie, the highest-grossing film is listed as the fastest-grossing film.

The actual figure is hard to calculate because the film was distributed on a "states' rights" basis in which licenses to show the film were sold outright. The actual cash generated by The Birth of a Nation may have been as much as $50 million to $100 million, an almost inconceivable amount for such an early film.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' is the first film to definitively gross over $50 million in the United States, taking its lifetime total to $58.3 million with its 1954 re-release.{{sfn|Block|Wilson|2010|page=518}} More than 1,500 films have grossed over $50&amp;nbsp;million, of which 37 did so during their opening day (including midnight previews).&lt;ref group="#" name="Fast050"/&gt; The list below is restricted to the biggest 10 during their opening day.

[[File:Android Samsung Smartphones.jpg|thumb|250px|Android [[Android Marshmallow|Marshmallow]], [[Android Nougat|Nougat]] and [[Android Oreo|Oreo]]]]
This is a '''list of features in the [[Android OS|Android]] [[operating system]]'''.&lt;ref name="WhatIsAndroid"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://developer.android.com/guide/basics/what-is-android.html |title=What is Android? |date=July 21, 2009 |work=Android Developers |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EnSDK"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.engadget.com/2007/11/12/googles-android-os-early-look-sdk-now-available/ |title=Google's Android OS early look SDK now available |last=Topolsky |first=Joshua |work=[[Engadget]] |date=November 12, 2007 |accessdate=2012-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mediaformats"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/media-formats.html |title=Android Supported Media Formats |work=Android Developers |accessdate=2012-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General==
; Messaging: [[SMS]] and [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]] are available forms of messaging, including threaded [[text messaging]] and Android Cloud To Device Messaging (C2DM) and now enhanced version of C2DM, Android Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) is also a part of Android Push Messaging services. Android phones also have the ability to send and receive [[Rich Communication Services|RCS]] via the messages app (if supported by the carrier).

; Auto Correction and Dictionary: Android Operating System has an interesting feature called Auto Correction. When any word is misspelled, then Android recommends the meaningful and correct words matching the words that are available in Dictionary. Users can add, edit and remove words from Dictionary as per their wish&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Tech Mirages|title=How To Add or Remove Words From Android Dictionary|date=2016-10-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4DxlSyb9Lg|accessdate=2017-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

;{{anchor|AndroidBrowser}}Web browser: The web browser available in Android is based on the open-source [[Blink (layout engine)|Blink]] (previously [[WebKit]]) layout engine, coupled with [[Google Chromium|Chromium]]'s [[V8 JavaScript engine]]. Then the WebKit-using Android Browser scored 100/100 on the [[Acid3#Mobile browsers|Acid3]] test on Android 4.0 &lt;abbr title="Ice Cream Sandwich"&gt;ICS&lt;/abbr&gt;; the Blink-based browser currently has better standards support. The old web browser is variably known as 'Android Browser', '[[Android Open Source Project|AOSP]] browser', 'stock browser', 'native browser', and 'default browser' (from the time it was always the default). Starting with Android 4.4 KitKat, Google has began licensing [[Google Chrome]] (a proprietary software) separately from Android, but usually bundled with (what most device vendors did). &lt;!-- unclear what this is source for: &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.exploringwiz.com/7-reason-android-better-iphone/|title=7 reason android better iphone |access-date=2017-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; Since Android 5.0 Lollipop, the WebView browser that apps can use to display web content without leaving the app has been separated from the rest of the Android firmware in order to facilitate separate security updates by Google.
; Voice-based features: Google search through voice has been available since initial release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://developer.android.com/resources/articles/speech-input.html |title=Speech Input for Google Search |work=Android Developers |accessdate=2012-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112141941/https://developer.android.com/resources/articles/speech-input.html |archivedate=2010-11-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Voice actions for calling, texting, navigation, etc. are supported on Android 2.2 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/mobile/voice-actions/ |title=Voice Actions for Android |work=google.com |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of Android 4.1, Google has expanded Voice Actions with  ability to talk back and read answers from Google's Knowledge Graph when queried with specific commands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) Voice Actions explained | url=https://www.geek.com/articles/mobile/googles-new-jelly-bean-voice-actions-20120627/ |publisher=Geek.com|accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ability to control hardware has not yet been implemented.
; Multi-touch: Android has native support for [[multi-touch]] which was initially made available in handsets such as the [[HTC Hero]]. The feature was originally disabled at the kernel level (possibly to avoid infringing Apple's patents on touch-screen technology at the time).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/report-apple-nixed-androids-multitouch/ |work=[[CNET News]] |title=Report: Apple nixed Android's multitouch |date=February 11, 2009 |first=Steven |last=Musil |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google has since released an update for the [[Nexus One]] and the [[Motorola Droid]] which enables multi-touch natively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/02/02/nexus-one-gets-a-software-update-enables-multitouch/ |title=Nexus One gets a software update, enables multitouch |work=[[Engadget]] |first=Chris |last=Ziegler |date=February 2, 2010 |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Multitasking: Multitasking of applications, with unique handling of memory allocation, is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://android-developers.blogspot.com/2010/04/multitasking-android-way.html |title=Multitasking the Android Way |work=Android Developers |last=Bray |first=Tim |date=April 28, 2010 |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Screen capture: Android supports capturing a [[screenshot]] by pressing the power and home-screen buttons at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/242128/samsung_google_unveil_latest_android_os_phone.html |title=Samsung, Google Unveil Latest Android OS, Phone |publisher=PCWorld |author=Nancy Gohring |date=October 19, 2011 |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Android 4.0, the only methods of capturing a screenshot were through manufacturer and third-party customizations (apps), or otherwise by using a PC connection (DDMS developer's tool). These alternative methods are still available with the latest Android.
; TV recording: Android TV supports capturing [[video]] and replaying it. &lt;ref name="android-N-highlights"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://developer.android.com/preview/features/tv-recording-api.html|title=TV recording&amp;#124;Android Developers|publisher=Google |date=March 9, 2016|accessdate=March 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Video calling: Android does not support native video calling, but some handsets have a customized version of the operating system that supports it, either via the [[UMTS]] network (like the [[Samsung Galaxy S]]) or over IP. Video calling through Google Talk is available in Android 2.3.4 (Gingerbread) and later. Gingerbread allows [[Nexus S]] to place Internet calls with a SIP account. This allows for enhanced VoIP dialing to other SIP accounts and even phone numbers. Skype 2.1 offers video calling in Android 2.3, including front camera support. Users with the [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.plus&amp;hl=en Google+ Android app] can perform video chat with other Google+ users through [https://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/ Hangouts].
; Multiple language support: Android supports multiple languages.&lt;ref name="gingerbread-highlights"&gt;{{cite web |date=December 6, 2010 |url=https://developer.android.com/sdk/android-2.3-highlights.html |title=Android 2.3 Platform Highlights |work=Android Developers |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Accessibility: Built-in text-to-speech is provided by ''TalkBack'' for people with low or no vision. Enhancements for people with hearing difficulties are available, as are other aids.

==Connectivity==
; Connectivity: Android supports connectivity technologies including [[GSM]]/[[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]], [[Bluetooth]], [[LTE Advanced|LTE]], [[Code division multiple access|CDMA]], [[Evolution-Data Optimized|EV-DO]], [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]], [[Near field communication|NFC]], [[Integrated Digital Enhanced Network|IDEN]] and [[WiMAX]].
; Bluetooth: Supports voice dialing and sending contacts between phones, playing music, sending files ([[Object Push Profile|OPP]]), accessing the phone book ([[Bluetooth profile#Phone Book Access Profile (PBAP, PBA)|PBAP]]), [[A2DP]] and [[AVRCP]]. Keyboard, mouse and joystick ([[Bluetooth profile#Human Interface Device Profile (HID)|HID]]) support is available in Android 3.1+, and in earlier versions through manufacturer customizations and third-party applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://developer.android.com/sdk/android-3.1-highlights.html#UserFeatures |title=Android 3.1 Platform Highlights |work=Android Developers |accessdate=2012-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216215130/https://developer.android.com/sdk/android-3.1-highlights.html#UserFeatures |archivedate=2012-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Tethering: Android supports [[tethering]], which allows a phone to be used as a wireless/wired [[Wi-Fi hotspot]]. Before Android 2.2 this was supported by third-party applications or manufacturer customizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/190265/use_your_android_phone_as_a_wireless_modem.html |title=Use Your Android Phone as a Wireless Modem |publisher=PCWorld |author=JR Raphael |date=May 6, 2010 |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
; Streaming media support: RTP/RTSP streaming 3GPP PSS, [[Internet Streaming Media Alliance|ISMA]]), HTML progressive download ([[HTML5 video|HTML5 &lt;video&gt; tag]]). Adobe Flash Streaming (RTMP) and HTTP Dynamic Streaming are supported by the [[Adobe Flash Player#Mobile platforms|Flash plugin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://kb2.adobe.com/cps/860/cpsid_86018.html |title=Flash Flayer 10.1 for Android 2.2 Release Notes |work=Adobe Knowledgebase |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple HTTP Live Streaming is supported by [[RealPlayer for Android]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press |url=https://www.realnetworks.com/press/releases/2010/RealPlayer-for-Mobile-Delivers-HTTP-Live-Content-to-Android.aspx |title=RealNetworks Gives Handset and Tablet OEMs Ability to Deliver HTTP Live Content to Android Users |work=realnetworks.com |date=September 10, 2010 |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the operating system since Android 3.0 (Honeycomb).&lt;ref name="honeycomb-highlights"&gt;{{cite web|title=Android 3.0 Platform Highlights |url=https://developer.android.com/sdk/android-3.0-highlights.html |work=Google: Android SDK |accessdate=2012-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216200154/https://developer.android.com/sdk/android-3.0-highlights.html |archivedate=2011-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Media support: Android supports the following audio/video/still media formats: [[WebM]], [[H.263]], [[H.264]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]], [[HE-AAC]] (in [[3GP]] or [[MP4]] [[container format (digital)|container]]), [[MPEG-4 Part 2|MPEG-4 SP]], [[Adaptive multi-rate compression|AMR]], [[AMR-WB]] (in 3GP container), [[MP3]], [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]], [[Vorbis|Ogg Vorbis]], [[Free Lossless Audio Codec|FLAC]], [[WAV]], [[JPEG]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]], [[BMP file format|BMP]], and [[WebP]].&lt;ref name="mediaformats"/&gt;
; External storage: Most Android devices include microSD card slots and can read microSD cards formatted with the [[FAT32]], [[Ext3]] or [[Ext4]] file systems. To allow use of external storage media such as [[USB flash drive]]s and [[USB HDD]]s, some Android devices are packaged with [[USB-OTG]] cables. Storage formatted with [[FAT32]] is handled by the [[Linux Kernel]] vFAT driver, while 3rd party solutions are required to handle some other file systems such as [[NTFS]], [[HFS+|HFS Plus]] and [[exFAT]]. 

==Hardware support==
Android devices can include still/video cameras, [[touchscreen]]s, [[Global Positioning System|GPS]], [[accelerometer]]s, [[gyroscope]]s, [[barometer]]s, [[magnetometer]]s, dedicated gaming controls, [[proximity sensor|proximity]] and [[pressure sensor]]s, [[thermometer]]s, accelerated 2D [[bit blit]]s (with hardware orientation, scaling, pixel format conversion) and accelerated 3D graphics.

==Other==
; Java support: While most Android applications are written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], there is no [[Java Virtual Machine]] in the platform and Java byte code is not executed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="62779">The lists of '''Merriam-Webster's Words of the Year''' (for each year) are ten-word lists published annually by the American dictionary-publishing company [[Merriam-Webster]], Inc., which feature the ten [[Word of the Year|words of the year]] from the English language. These word lists started in 2003 and have been published at the end of each year. At first, Merriam-Webster determined its contents by analyzing [[Hit (internet)|page hits]] and popular searches on its [[website]]. Since 2006, the list has been determined by an [[Open access poll#Online poll|online poll]] and by suggestions from visitors to the website.&lt;ref name="CNET"&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.news.com/8301-10784_3-6138377-7.html
 | title = Merriam-Webster launches 'Word of the Year' online poll
 | publisher=[[CNET]] | date=2007-11-27 | accessdate=2007-12-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Words of the Year usually reflect events that happened during the years the lists were published. For example, the Word of the Year for 2005, 'integrity', showed that the general public had an immense interest in defining this word amid ethics scandals in the United States government, corporations, and sports.&lt;ref name="solomon05" /&gt; The Word of the Year for 2004, 'blog', was looked up on the Online Dictionary the most as [[blog]]s began to influence mainstream media.&lt;ref name="BBCblog" /&gt; In 2006, Merriam-Webster received a lot of publicity as 'truthiness', a word coined by [[Stephen Colbert]] on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', topped the list.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

==Selection process==
When the Word of the Year was started in 2003, Merriam-Webster determined which words would appear on the list by analyzing page hits and popular searches to its website.&lt;ref name="CNET" /&gt; For example, the 2003 and 2004 lists were determined by online hits to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary and Online Thesaurus and to Merriam-WebsterCollegiate.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Merriam-Webster Announces 2004 Words of the Year |first=Christopher |last=Simmons |work=Publishers Newswire |date=2004-11-30 |url=http://www.publishersnewswire.com/internet/pnw_0082.shtml |accessdate=2008-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516101557/http://www.publishersnewswire.com/internet/pnw_0082.shtml |archivedate=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WriteNews"&gt;{{cite news |title=Merriam-Webster Announces 2003 Words of the Year |work=The Write News |publisher=Writers Write |date=2004-01-23 |url=http://www.writenews.com/2004/012304_words_2003.htm |accessdate=2008-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 and 2007, Merriam-Webster changed this practice, and the list was determined by an [[Open access poll#Online poll|online poll]] among words that were suggested by visitors to the site.&lt;ref name="CNET" /&gt; Visitors were requested to vote for one entry out of a list of twenty words and phrases. The list consisted of the words and phrases that were frequently looked-up on the site and those that were submitted by many readers.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; From 2008 onwards, however, user submissions have not been a deciding factor, and the list has been composed only of the words which were looked up most frequently that year. Merriam-Webster said that the reason for the change was that otherwise ordinary words were receiving so many hits that their significance could not be ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Reitz |first=Stephanie |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2008/11/26/bailout_named_word_of_the_year/ |title='Bailout' named word of the year |work=Boston Globe |date=November 26, 2008 |accessdate=February 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Morse, president of Merriam-Webster, pointed out that "the most frequently looked up words are not the newest words, not the latest high-tech terms, not the cool new slang."&lt;ref name="WriteNews" /&gt; Instead, these top ten words correlated to breaking news stories and world events in 2003. The top word ''democracy'' correlated to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] and the overthrow of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Word of the Year |first=Scott |last=Bakalar |work=Word of Mouth |date=2007-12-19 |url=http://thewomblog.com/?p=1110 |accessdate=2008-06-04 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080103085941/http://thewomblog.com/?p=1110 |archivedate=2008-01-03 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''quarantine'' to a [[SARS epidemic]], and ''matrix'' to the film ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]''.&lt;ref name="WriteNews" /&gt;

In 2004, blogs were becoming highly popular and began to influence mainstream media. During the twelve-month period that decides the word of the year, the term ''blog'' had the most requests for a definition or explanation, so a new entry was placed in Merriam-Webster's printed dictionary for 2005. The other words on this list, such as ''incumbent'', ''electoral'', and ''partisan'', were associated with major news events, such as the [[United States presidential election, 2004|United States presidential election of 2004]] or natural disasters that hit the US.&lt;ref name="BBCblog"&gt;{{cite web

For 2005, ''integrity'' was the most looked-up word in Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The words that made 2005 |first=Ruth |last=Walker |work=The Christian Science Monitor |date=2006-01-04 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to John Morse, President of Merriam-Webster, the word ''integrity'' slowly moved up the list to first place in 2005 because ethics scandals emerged around the United States regarding corporations, government, and sports,&lt;ref name="solomon05" /&gt; such as the [[CIA]] leak investigations, scandals in Congress, and disgraced athletes.&lt;ref name="Miller05"&gt;{{cite news |title=Why 'integrity' was such a sought-after word this year ; It beat 'refugee' and 'contempt' as the most looked-up word of 2005, according to Merriam-Webster's online dictionary |first=Sara |last=Miller |work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date=2005-12-20 |page=02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hurricane Katrina]], the [[Avian influenza|bird flu]], and the death of [[Pope John Paul II]] renewed public interest in words such as ''refugee,'' ''tsunami,'' ''pandemic,'' ''conclave,'' and ''levee.'' The word ''refugee'' was also a candidate for the [[American Dialect Society]]'s [[Word of the Year]]; according to Morse, the term gained notoriety as the entire country debated with how to describe people affected by Hurricane Katrina.&lt;ref name="solomon05" /&gt; The debate, over whether ''refugee'' was the proper term to describe displaced residents or whether the term was pejorative, summoned several Americans to look up the word in their dictionaries to form their own opinion. The word ''refugee'' received more queries in one month than most words in an entire year.&lt;ref name="Miller05" /&gt; The word ''insipid'' made the Top 10 list after [[Simon Cowell]] described [[Anthony Fedorov]]'s performance in ''[[American Idol]]'' as "pleasant, safe, and a little insipid."&lt;ref name="solomon05"&gt;{{cite news |first=Wendy |last= Solomon |title=The Nation; 'Integrity' Often Questioned in '05; The most-checked word in Webster's online and slang like 'infosnacking' catch linguists' eyes. |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2005-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At number 10 is ''inept'', a word that received a lot of attention after the days when [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W.

''Austerity'' was the most searched-for word of 2010. Interest in the word reached its highest point around May 1,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/trend-watch/2010/05/01/ |title=Austerity |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=February 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the day the Greek government announced a series of austerity measures, but its popularity remained strong throughout the year. Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster editor-at-large, said: "''Austerity'' clearly resonates with many people. We often hear it used in the context of government measures, but we also apply it to our own personal finances and what is sometimes called the new normal." [[Barack Obama]] used the word ''shellacking'' in November 2010, when acknowledging his party's losses in the [[United States elections, 2010|US mid-term elections]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/trend-watch/2010/11/03/ |title=Shellacking |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=February 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lookups of ''ebullient'' peaked in October, as [[2010 Copiapó mining accident|thirty-three Chilean miners]] were successfully rescued after 69 days trapped underground.&lt;ref name=mw12/&gt;

The word ''pragmatic'' was looked up on Merriam-Webster's website an unprecedented number of times in 2011.&lt;ref name=mw11/&gt; Although the popularity of the word wasn't linked to any specific event, it received the greatest amount of interest in the latter half of the year, as the [[United States Congress]] introduced the [[Budget Control Act of 2011|Budget Control Act]], and its [[Supercommittee]] began to craft deficit-reduction plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Reitz |first=Stephanie |url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/scene/article.aspx?subjectid=67&amp;articleid=20111226_13_D6_Whenth344892 |title=Merriam-Webster picks 'Pragmatic' as Word of Year |work=Tulsa World |date=December 26, 2011 |accessdate=February 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ambivalence'' was also a popular word throughout the year; John Moore, President of Merriam-Webster, remarked: "We think it reflects the public attitude toward a wide range of issues, including the economy, the ongoing debates in Washington, the presidential election, and most recently the race for the Republican Party nomination." The term ''vitriol'' was used frequently in the wake of the January 2011 [[2011 Tucson shooting|Tucson shooting]], which led to a national debate about political rhetoric.&lt;ref name=mw11/&gt;

In November 2011, political commentator [[David Gergen]] rounded off a CNN article (entitled "Have they gone nuts in Washington?") with the phrase "après moi, le déluge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gergen |first=David |url=http://www.cnn.co.uk/2011/11/21/opinion/gergen-reckless-congress/index.html |title=Have they gone nuts in Washington? |publisher=CNN |date=November 21, 2011 |accessdate=February 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expression, attributed to [[Louis XV]], typifies the attitude of those who don't care about the future, because they won't be around to face the consequences of their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/trend-watch/2011/11/23/ |title=Après moi le déluge |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=February 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of many of the words on Merriam-Webster's 2012 list were influenced by the commentary and debate that surrounded that year's [[United States presidential election, 2012|US presidential election]]. ''Socialism'' and ''capitalism'' were frequently referred to during the party conventions and the televised debates; interest in ''socialism'' spiked on the day of the election – November 6, 2012.&lt;ref name=mw12/&gt; The word ''malarkey'' was used several times by [[Joe Biden]] during his [[United States vice-presidential debate, 2012|vice-presidential debate]] with [[Paul Ryan]] on October 11,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/trend-watch/2012/10/11/ |title=Malarkey |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=February 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''meme'' captured the public imagination after a remark made by [[Mitt Romney]] about "[[binders full of women]]", on October 16, went viral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/trend-watch/2012/10/18/ |title=Meme |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=February 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Touché'' remained a popular word throughout the year. This was partly as a result of a new technology of the same name being announced by [[Disney Research]]; however, John Morse, President of Merriam-Webster, suggested that ''touché'' was "simply a word enjoying a period of increased popular use, perhaps as a byproduct of the growing amount of verbal jousting in our culture, especially through social media".&lt;ref name=mw12/&gt;

The popularity of the word [[science]] in 2013 was driven by debates around [[climate change]] and science in education.  Further debates around [[pseudoscience]] and whether science can answer all of life's questions further drove its popularity.

The suffix ''-ism'' goes all the way back to Ancient Greek, and was used in Latin and medieval French on its way to English. Originally, it turned a verb into a noun: think of ''baptize'' and ''baptism, criticize'' and ''criticism,'' or ''plagiarize'' and ''plagiarism.'' It has since acquired many other uses, including identifying a religion or practice (''Calvinism, vegetarianism''), a prejudice based on a specific quality (''sexism, ageism''), an adherence to a system (''stoicism, altruism''), a condition based on excess of something (''alcoholism''), or a characteristic feature or trait (''colloquialism'').&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Monte Vettore''' (from latin ''Vector'', "winner") is a [[mountain]] of the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]]. It is the highest peak of the [[Sibillini mountains|Cyblings massif]].

== Geography ==
The southwestern side of Cyblings massif, Vector, is included in [[Parco Nazionale dei Monti Sibillini|Sibillini Mountains National Park]]. Below the summit of Vector lies [[Lago di Pilato|a small glacial lake]] in a small enclosed valley between [[Cima del Redentore (Sibillini Mountains)|Redeemer Peak]].&lt;ref&gt;[htqtp://utenti.lycos.it/umbriadascoprire/castelluccio.htm Umbria :Castelluccio di Norcia].&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Sibillla Appenninica di Adolfo de Carolis.jpg|thumb|'''Apennine Sibyl''' by [[Adolfo de Carolis]].]]
The local medieval tradition was that the '''Apennine Sibyl''', a mysterious prophetess not counted among the [[Sibyl]]s of [[Classical Antiquity]], was condemned by God to dwell in a mountain cavern and await [[Last Judgement|Judgement Day]], having rebelled at the news that she had ''not'' been chosen [[Mother of God]], but that some humble Judaean virgin had been favored. The peak of Monte Vettore, surrounded by reddish cliffs was recognized as the crown of ''Regina Sibilla.''
[[Image:Monte Vettore - summit view of gran sasso3.JPG|thumb|Monte Vettore summit view with Maile]]
Less stringently Christian legend set her in an underworld paradise entered through a grotto in the mountains of Norcia. Nearby the magical lake is fed by water from the cavern. Whoever stayed longer than a year could no longer leave, but remained deathless and ageless, feasting in abundance, amid revelry and voluptuous delights. 

== In popular culture ==
In ''[[Il Guerrin Meschino]]'', written by [[Andrea da Barberino]] about 1410, the central episode of the sixth part (Canto V) contains the "prodigious adventures" of Guerrino with this enchantress, the "Fata" Alcina, whom he seeks out, against all advice. He locates her cavern in the mountains of central Italy with the aid of Macco, a [[Serpent (mythology)|speaking serpent]]. She shows him the delights and horrors of her cavern, where sinners have been changed to the appropriate animals, but where sin is the only path to the knowledge of his real parents that he seeks, and Guerrin has to flee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lfb.it/fff/enc/guerimes5.htm Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

The long informative captions in the maps of [[Ortelius]]' 16th-century atlas, ''Cartographia Neerlandica'', offer some detail about this Apennine Sybil:
{{quote|The Mountain Apennine here looms over the country with exceedingly high cragged tops, in which one finds that huge cave called Sibylla's cave, (in their language Grotta de la Sibylla) and which the poets would have the Elysian Fields. For the common people dream about a certain Sibylla [supposed] to be in this cave, who [is claimed to] possess a large kingdom full of gorgeous buildings and Princely palaces, covered with pleasant gardens, abounding with many fine lecherous wenches and all kinds of pleasures and delights. All of these she will bestow on those who through this cave (which is always open) will come to her.
And after they have been there for the period of one whole year, they have the freedom and liberty given to them by Sibylla to depart (if they please) and from that moment, having returned to us, they state that they live a most blessed and happy life ever after. This cave is also known to our countrymen by the name of &lt;small&gt;VROU VENUS BERGH&lt;/small&gt;, that is, The Lady Venus mount.&lt;ref&gt;Compare the legend of the [[Venusberg (mythology)|Venusberg]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Locally the Sibilla was in some sense a beneficent ''[[Fairy|fata]]'' whose retinue would descend from her mountain at times to teach the village girls all the secrets of spinning and weaving (see [[Weaving (mythology)]] for other European weaving goddesses), and perhaps to dance the [[saltarello]] with the best of the young men. But if they were not back in their mountain fastness by sunrise, they would be denied access and would become mere mortals. On one occasion, what with dancing and pleasure, the ''faterelle'' had not noticed the approach of dawn. Scrambling up the Vettore, their goatlike feet crushed the rock to fragments. They reached the safety of their grotto just before dawn, but the long slope of [[Scree|talus]] is still pointed out as the ''Path of the Fata''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1199">"Mullard Circuits for Audio Amplifiers" is a famous book by the Technical Services Department of [[Mullard]] Ltd, a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[vacuum tube|valve]] manufacturing company. First published in 1959 and then reprinted several times it contained a number of designs by Mullard engineers for high quality audio amplifiers, which were to be used by [[amateur]] constructors as well as by manufacturers as the basis for many products that formed part of the [[high fidelity]] audio movement in Britain in the 1960s.

Particularly iconic designs were the [[Mullard 5-10]] and the [[Mullard 5-20]], ten and twenty [[watt]] [[power amplifier]]s.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.hificollective.co.uk/books/bk2005.html Hi Fi collective - description]&lt;/ref&gt; Circuits for preamplifiers with tone controls and tape recorder amplifiers were also included, along with information regarding record and tape equalisation standards.

The '''Museu Picasso''' ({{IPA-ca|muˈzɛw piˈkasu}}, "Picasso Museum"), located in [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]], houses one of the most extensive collections of artworks by the 20th-century Spanish artist [[Pablo Picasso]]. With 4,251 works exhibited by the painter, the museum has one of the most complete permanent collections of works. The museum is housed in five adjoining medieval palaces in Barcelona's [[La Ribera]] and is located on Montcada Street in the (Bank District) of Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=AADD|title=Museums and Cultural Heritage in Catalonia|year=2010|publisher=Department of Culture of the Generalitat of Catalonia|location=New York|isbn=84-393-5437-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It opened to the public on 9 March 1963,&lt;ref name=museussingulars&gt;{{cite book|last=DDAA|title=Singular Museum of Catalonia Chapter of the Picasso Museum|year=1979|publisher=Editorial DIAFORA|location=New York|isbn=84-85205-33-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the first museum dedicated to Picasso's work and the only one created during the artist's life. It has since been declared a museum of national interest by the [[Government of Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Government of Catalonia|title=The Museum of National Interest}}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 March 2007--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Highlights of the collection include two of his first major works, ''[[The First Communion (Picasso)|The First Communion]]'' (1896), and ''[[Science and Charity (Picasso)|Science and Charity]]'' (1897). In particular, the Museu Picasso reveals Picasso's relationship with the city of Barcelona, a relationship that was shaped in his youth and adolescence and continued until his death.

The original idea for the museum came from Picasso’s lifelong friend and secretary, [[Jaime Sabartes|Jaume Sabartés]], whom Picasso had given many paintings, drawings, and prints since meeting in 1899. Originally, Sabartés intended to found the museum in [[Málaga]], Picasso’s birthplace. It was Picasso himself who suggested that Barcelona would be more appropriate, given his long standing connections with the city.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

On 27 July 1960, Sabartés signed an agreement with the city of Barcelona to found the museum. The museum opened in 1963, with the collection established through Sabartés' donation of 574 works from his personal collection. Other items included works that Picasso had given to the city of Barcelona, such as ''Harlequin'', works previously in the possession of the city’s museum of modern art, and other gifts from Picasso’s friends and collectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |language=Catalan |url=http://www.bcn.cat/museupicasso/ca/colleccio/cronologia.html |title=Timeline of the collection site to the Picasso Museum |year=2007 |accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The museum opened under the name of the Sabartés Collection, because of Picasso’s strong opposition to Franco’s regime. In the end, Barcelona mayor Josep Porcioles went against the wishes of the central government in order to open the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bolanos |first=Maria |title=History museums in Spain |year=2008 |publisher=Elsevier Trea |isbn= 978-84-9704-352-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it opened, the museum was located in Palau Aguilar on Montcada Street. In this era, the collection consisted mainly of the personal collection Sabartés, some [[Lithography|lithograph]]s, and posters. Other donations during the museum's first year included a book of [[engraving]]s made by Picasso of [[Ovid|Ovid's]] ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', donated by [[Salvador Dalí]], as well as a [[collage]] given by [[Gala Dalí]], titled ''No,'' 1913. In subsequent years, the collection was expanded with donations, including 7-drawings dated between 1899 and 1904 given by Junyer Sebastian Vidal.

===Expansion===
After Sabartés death in 1968, in 1970 Picasso made his last personal donation to the museum. The donation was made up of 920 varied works, including items from his early work that his family had been keeping for him ever since the time he first settled in France. These included school books, academic pieces and paintings from [[Picasso's Blue Period]]. Sabartés himself bequested a number of works upon his death, including a series of 58 paintings on ''[[Las Meninas (Picasso)|Las Meninas]]''. In December 1970, the museum underwent its first expansion, adding the [[Palau del Baró de Castellet]], which is attached to the original museum building, Palau Aguilar.

As years passed, the museum grew in importance as more substantial donations were made. During the early 1980s the collection was expanded with several donations from individuals and various art galleries, as well as through acquisitions. In 1982, Picasso's widow Jacqueline Roque gave 41 pieces to the museum. (In 1983), the Louise Leiris Gallery made a donation of 117 engravings.  Some notable donations include those from [[Carles Domingo]] and the [[Editorial Gustavo Gili]], among others.&lt;ref Name="museussingulars"/&gt; In 1985, the museum's physical space expanded again with the addition of Palau Mecca.

During the 1990s donations included (women ''bust'' or ''[[Man sitting (Picasso)|Man sitting]]''). The museum also acquired works such as ''Portrait of Jacqueline with tape,'' among others. In the late 1990s the museum expanded yet again with the acquisition of Casa Mauri and Palau Windows, both on the same street and adjacent to the museum. Opened in 1999, this new extension added 3,400 square meters to the museum, serving as a space for temporary exhibitions, an auditorium, and additional services. The extension was opened with the temporary exhibition ''Picasso: Interior and Exterior Landscape'', with more than 200 works by the artist created between 1917 and 1970.

===21st century===
In 2003, the museum's interior was remodeled and the artworks rearranged. Two years later, The [[Government of Catalonia]] declared the institution a museum of national interest.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

In 2006, Maite Ocaña, the museum's director since 1983, resigned in order to direct the [[National Art Museum of Catalonia]]. Pepe Serra was appointed director of the Picasso in the same year. In 2008, the Museu Picasso rearranged the permanent collection and opened new rooms dedicated to engraving, including one dedicated to Sabartés.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://paper.avui.cat/article/cultura/118734/museu/picasso/compra/fa/canvis.html |title=The Picasso Museum is free and changes |language=Catalan |last=Frisach |first=Montse |date=03.04.2008 |editor=[[Avui]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120629073858/http://paper.avui.cat/article/cultura/118734/museu/picasso/compra/fa/canvis.html |archivedate=29 June 2012 |accessdate=6 November 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Serra has since established a network of organizations associated with Picasso, including the City of [[Gósol]], the Centre Picasso of [[Horta de Sant Joan]] and [[Palau Foundation]] in [[Caldes d'Estrac]], with the central aim of promoting the position of the artist by the Catalan territory.  In 2009, the museum was listed as one of the 40 most visited art museums in the world by ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

In 2010 the museum began a project to improve its active presence in [[social networks]] such as [[Twitter]], [[Flickr]], and [[Facebook]]. The museum's efforts resulted in the Museums &amp; the Web 2010 Best of the Web award for social media.&lt;ref name=MW2010&gt;{{cite web|title=Congratulations to the MW2010 Best of the Web Winners! |url=http://conference.archimuse.com/forum/congratulations_mw2010_best_web_winners |work=Archimuse |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120708174632/http://www.museumsandtheweb.com/forum/congratulations_mw2010_best_web_winners |archivedate=8 July 2012 |accessdate=6 November 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museumsetc.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/MuseuPicasso.pdf |title=Twitter for Museums: Strategies and Tactics for Success }} {{ISBN|978-0-95619436-7}}. {{dead link|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum's social media projects promote participatory discussion around the institution's research and knowledge.

More recently, the museum has built a new building in Sabartés square, behind Montcada Street. This expansion helped alleviate the overcrowding at the entry of the museum.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The building was designed by the architect [[Jordi Garcés]], who had completed the previous expansion of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |language=Catalan |url=http://w110.bcn.cat/fitxers/icub/museupicasso/dossierpremsa.950.pdf |title=The Picasso Museum: research and knowledge, new acquisitions and new building |publisher=Picasso Museum |accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
The Museu Picasso occupies five large houses or palaces of the [[Carrer de Montcada]] Barcelona, dating from the 13th century and 14th century, occupying a total area of 10,628 sqm. The buildings follow the style of [[Catalan Gothic|Gothic civil Catalan]]. Each of the 5 buildings are built following a similar pattern, around a courtyard equipped with an exterior staircase that allows access to the main floors. The buildings that house the collection of Picasso's works also have their own history.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Palau Aguilar===
[[File:Palau Aguilar- Foyer planta baixa-1.JPG|thumb|left|Palau Aguilar]]
The Palau Aguilar (Montcada, 15) was the first building occupied by the museum. The building was probably built on the residence of James Ses sources, an important character in the life of Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;XIII (DDAA, 1984) p.15)&lt;/ref&gt; The building dates from the 13th century but underwent significant alterations between the 15th and 18th centuries.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Between the 13th and 14th centuries the building belonged to various nobles of the Court of Aragon. It was purchased in 1386 by the bourgeois family Corominas-Desplà, who then sold it fourteen years later to Berenguer Aguilar, from which the palace is named. Later owners included several members of the Catalan bourgeoisie prior to the building's purchase by the [[City Council]] on 3 November 1953.&lt;ref&gt;DDAA, ''Guide to the Museum of Catalonia.'' Barcelona. 2001. {{ISBN|84-393-5437-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a restoration made in 1960, the remains of a 13th-century painting were discovered while removing plaster from one of the rooms. Today this work is exhibited in the [[National Art Museum of Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Online Catalogue MNAC Reference Cjt-071 447]&lt;/ref&gt; A large fresco representing the [[conquest of Majorca]] in 1229, the work is made up of cauldrons and roses, which suggest that the palace belonged to the lineage Caldes and Desvalls. It depicts the central courtyard of the building during the 15th century, with an open staircase and a pointed [[Gothic architecture|Gotchic arch]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Palau Baró de Castellet===
[[File:Palau del Baró de Castellet Montcada, 17.jpg|thumb|Palau Baró de Castellet]]
The Palau Baró de Castellet (Montcada, 17) is a palace from the medieval period. Built during the 13th century, it was owned by the Gerona family during the 15th century. Since then it has changed hands between the bourgeois and aristocratic families of Barcelona, having been remodeled during the 18th century. In 1797, the then owner (Mariano Alegre Aparici Amat) received the noble title of Baron ''Castle'' at the hands of [[Charles IV of Spain|King Charles IV]], prompting the palace to receive its name. Upon the death of the Baron, the building was bequeathed to the [[Holy Cross Hospital in Barcelona|Hospital of the Holy Cross]], who rented it to different tenants until they sold it to the Rivers family. The City Council then purchased the building in the 1950s. The palace was built around a central courtyard and includes on its facade a relief from the 16th century that depicts religious themes. The interior's main floor is in the [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] style of the mid-18th century, including elements of [[marble]] and polychrome reliefs.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Palau Meca===
[[File:Museu Picasso- Placa 1982.JPG|thumb|Palau Meca 1982]]

The Palau Meca (Montcada, 19) was built between the 13th and 14th centuries and also underwent restoration during the 18th century. Similar to the other palaces, it contains a central courtyard. Highlights include the medieval polychrome coffered ceilings of the main floor as well as unique ceilings from the 19th century. In 1349, the property was owned by James Knight, then Minister of the City Council. Under the ownership of his grandson, Ramon Desplà Knight, it became the largest palace on the block. The building later became the property of the family of Cassador (or Hunter), Marquis of Ciutadilla. The first owner, Joseph Mecca Hunter gave the palace its current name. The next family to own it, the Milans, restored the building after it was badly damaged during the [[War of Spanish Succession]]. In 1901, the building was given to the Brothers of Christian Doctrine and (was installed Montepío of [[Santa Madrona]].) Over time the Montepío integrated with a bank, who gave the building to the City Council on 5 December 1977. The Palace was reopened as part of the museum on 11 January 1982.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Casa Mauri===
[[File:Casa Mauri i palau Finestres - baixos.jpg|thumb|Casa Mauri]]

Casa Mauri (Montcada, 21) includes some structures that date from Roman times, when the space was occupied by the suburbs of [[Barcelona|Barcino]]. Of note is the unique wood facade, one of the few examples in Barcelona of the locking system typical of the 18th century. Between 1378 and 1516 the building was owned by the Rocha family and in 1716 it was owned by F. Casamada. During the 19th century several renovations were made. Under the owner Josep Vidal Torrents, the building was made to have industrial uses until it was bought by Mauri bakeries in 1943, the company that gave the building its name. In 1999 the building was acquired by Museu Picasso.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Palau Finestres===
[[File:Museu Picasso- Palau Finestres - Entrada temporals.JPG|thumb|Palau Finestres, temporals entry]]

The Palau Finestres (Montcada, 23) was built on the foundations of a building dating to the 13th century and occupies a former Roman [[necropolis]]. Between 1363 and 1516 the area belonged to the Marimon family. In 1872, the owner of Casa Mauri, Jose Vidal Torres, bought the building in order to annex it to his home. The City acquired the building in 1970. There are arcades on the ground floor, added during the reforms of the fifteenth and 17th centuries. On the main floor, a coffered ceiling from the end of the 13th century have been restored. The building is currently used as exhibition space.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Knowledge and Research Center===
The Knowledge and Research Center was opened on 17 February, a new building located in Plaza Sabartés that was designed by architect [[Jordi Garcés]]. The site aims to become an international landmark in the study of Picasso and his artistic and social context. Director Pepe Sierra explained that the space would be used for discussion, dialogue, and debate, rather than as a place of consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avui.cat/noticia/article/5-cultura/19-cultura/371808-of-the-brain-picasso.html |title=The brain Picasso |last=Palau |first=Maria |publisher=Daily Today |date=2011-02-18 |language=Catalan |accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The organization responsible for this is Silvia Domenech, commissioned between 1997 and 2007 of the [[Photographic Archive of Barcelona]].)

[[Jordi Garcés]], who already performed the previous expansion of the museum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://w3.bcn.es/fitxers/icub/museupicasso/dossierpremsa.950.pdf |title=Presentation Press Building |publisher=Picasso Museum |format=PDF |accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed the 1500 square meter building with a transparent glass facade protected by a cantilever. The building houses an educational center on the ground floor, with 4 multi-purpose spaces aimed at providing educational service for the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paper.avui.cat/article/cultura/158989/repensar/picasso.html |language=Catalan |title=Rethinking Picasso |last=Frisach |first=Montse |date=2009-03-25 |work=Daily Today |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120629073858/http://paper.avui.cat/article/cultura/158989/repensar/picasso.html |archivedate=29 June 2012 |accessdate=6 November 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first floor is devoted to the library, documentation center, and archives of the museum. The basement is devoted to visitor services. The construction began on 10 July 2009 and ended on 16 February 2011, costing 6.7 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcn.cat/museupicasso/ca/museu/dossier.pdf |title=Press release presenting the new building |date=2011-02-17 |publisher=City Council |accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The permanent collection==
The permanent collection is organized into three sections: painting and drawing, engraving, and ceramics. These cover principally the early years of Picasso’s artistic life, such as his Blue Period from 1901 to 1904, but Picasso, his family, and his friends would bequest or loan other later pieces as well. There are now more than 3,500 works making up the permanent collection of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.secrethotels.eu/visiting-barcelona-on-a-budget/ |title= Visiting Barcelona on a Budget |publisher=secrethotels.eu |date=|accessdate=2013-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection is organized into areas that include the early years (Málaga, Corunna and Barcelona, 1890–97), the training period (Barcelona, Horta de San Juan and Madrid, 1897–1901), the Blue Period (1901–04), works in Barcelona from 1917, and the entire ''Las Meninas'' (1957) series. Most of the paintings on display at the museum are from the period between 1890 and 1917, an important collection in regard to that portion of Picasso's life. The museum has very few paintings after 1917, with the exception of the ''[[Las Meninas (Picasso)|Las Meninas]]'', painted in 1957. The collection of [[Lithography|lithograph]]s comprises the years 1962 and 1982. Picasso himself gave the museum a copy of each of his works produced after the death of Sabartés in 1968. The collection also includes illustrations made by the artist for various books, as well as ceramics gifted to the museum by Picasso's widow, Jacqueline.

Between 2009 and 2010 the museum began making information on the permanent collection public on their website. As of October 2010, over 65% of the museum's collection was available to view online.

==Exhibitions==
The Picasso Museum has carried out dozens of exhibitions since it opened. Often, these exposures are related to the figure of the painter or topics related to their environment, trying to research and review the work and studies of the painter from Málaga. We have also held exhibitions on the relationship between Picasso and other artists as Picasso vs. Rusiñol held in 2010. Sometimes also organized a traveling exhibition, and Bullfighting. Paintings, drawings and prints in the collection of the Museu Picasso which could be seen at the Casa Lis in Salamanca in 2010. Also made small exhibition focused on one topic, called displays, such as analyzing the painting Science and Charity, the results of studies showing radiographic and reflectologia or another that analyzes a statement that was made about Picasso in Barcelona 1936, Room Esteva. Picasso Exhibition, 1936.

The Museu Picasso frequently hosts special exhibitions presenting artworks by Picasso and other artists. From time to time, the museum also organizes [[seminar]]s and lectures on subjects related to Picasso or on museological issues of interest given by specialists from throughout the world.

==Services==

===Library===
[[File:Museu Picasso- Biblioteca.JPG|thumb|Library]]

The museum has a free public library of over 6,000 references, located on the third floor of the Palau Aguilar. It is a space for consultation with a documentary on the life and work of the artist and his artistic context, covering virtually every pictorial movements of the 20th century . To access it needed to make an appointment in advance.
The library can be found from catalogs of exhibitions of Picasso to bibliophile editions. There are also collections of some of the journals of the avant-garde Catalan of the early 20th century, where Picasso collaborated and appeared often. Also available with restricted access, a collection of artist's books with illustrations by Picasso himself or by other renowned artists.

===Educational activities===
One of the other aspects of the Picasso Museum is to highlight the number of services and training proposals and entertainment for families and schools. The museum has a specific department and a section on the website where you can download specific resources to carry out educational activities during the visit, aimed at both primary school teachers as secondary or high school. [24] organizes guided tours for both adults, such as dynamic visits adapted to the different educational levels, both in the permanent collection and temporary exhibitions. The museum also organizes conferences and seminars and activities in collaboration with other institutions such as the UOC, the Grec Festival, the San Juan de Dios Hospital, the Pompeu Fabra University and the School Tool, among others.

===Preventive conservation and restoration===
The museum has its own team of preventive conservation and restoration, to ensure that the works of our own collection are in the best possible conditions for future generations. From this department studied and documented both the work and materials that Picasso used in order to improve understanding of his work.
In this department also establishes the most appropriate measures of environmental protection and establishing the most appropriate security protocols.

He is a former [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship|NWA World Heavyweight Champion]], and was recognized as the first NWA World Heavyweight Champion in 1948. Brown's professional wrestling career ended on November 1, 1949, when he suffered severe injuries in an automobile accident.&lt;ref name=titles/&gt;&lt;ref name=race/&gt;

== Biography ==
Brown was born on March 10, 1908. He grew up on a small farm in [[Sharon, Kansas]]. Brown worked on the farm during the mornings before walking several miles to school in [[Kiowa, Kansas]]. He only attended one year of school due to financial reasons.&lt;ref name=titles/&gt;&lt;ref name=race/&gt;

== Professional wrestling career ==
Brown was noticed by Ernest Brown, a former manager of amateur and professional wrestlers, in the late 1920s, who was convinced that he might have a future as a wrestler and agreed to work with Brown at the local high school in Kiowa, Kansas. After training, Brown was undefeated for 71 matches. He gained enough notoriety in western Kansas that the promoter in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] put him on the preliminary of the weekly matches there.&lt;ref name=titles/&gt;&lt;ref name=race/&gt;

A well-known wrestler named [[Abe Coleman]] saw Brown wrestle and recommended him to the promoter in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], Tom Packs.&lt;ref name=titles/&gt;&lt;ref name=race/&gt;
	
Brown impressed many people with his wrestling skills in matches against former [[Professional wrestling championship#World championships|world heavyweight champions]] [[Jim Londos]] and [[Ed Lewis (wrestler)|Ed "Strangler" Lewis]]. He quickly won the Kansas Heavyweight Championship. Brown went on to become the Kansas-based [[Midwest Wrestling Association]] (MWA) World Heavyweight Champion for a record of 11 times from 1940 to 1948. Brown won the title by beating wrestlers such as Bobby Bruns, Lee Wyckoff, Tom Zaharias, Swedish Angel, Roy Graham and Tug Carlson.&lt;ref name=titles/&gt;&lt;ref name=race/&gt;
	
In 1948, promoter Pinkie George, along with other promoters, recognized Brown as the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship|World Heavyweight Champion]] in the newly formed [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA). Brown began the NWA's project of unifying the various world heavyweight championships contested at that time with the NWA version. A significant unification match took place against [[Frank Sexton]] on March 15, 1949. Sexton held the American Wrestling Alliance Heavyweight Championship, the second most important championship in the country at that time, which he had previously unified with the Maryland version of the World Heavyweight Championship.&lt;ref name=titles/&gt;&lt;ref name=race/&gt;
	
Brown held the World Heavyweight Championship until he was forced to retire in November 1949 due to injuries he suffered on November 1, 1949 in a car accident.&lt;ref name=NWAHornbaker/&gt; He was scheduled to participate in a unification match against [[Lou Thesz]] on November 25, 1949.&lt;ref name=NWAHornbaker/&gt; Thesz was awarded the title as Brown was unable to compete.&lt;ref name=titles/&gt;&lt;ref name=race/&gt;
	
After retiring, Brown became a promoter in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. He promoted the [[Heart of America Sports Attractions|Midwest Wrestling Association]] (MWA) from the founding of the NWA in 1948 until 1958, when the promotion was taken over by [[Bob Geigel]].&lt;ref name=titles/&gt;&lt;ref name=race/&gt;

== Personal life ==
Brown married Grace Charlotte on October 13, 1927.&lt;ref name=NWAHornbaker/&gt; Their marriage lasted until his death in 1981. Their son Richard also became a wrestler.&lt;ref name=titles/&gt;&lt;ref name=race/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19588">[[File:Arnoud van Halen - Panpoeticon Batavum.jpg|thumb|Two plates of the Pan Poëticon Batavum on show in the [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam]]]]
The '''Pan Poëticon Batavum''' was a collection of small portraits of poets mounted on plates that were kept in a curiosity cabinet by the 18th-century Dutch painter [[Arnoud van Halen]].

==History of the collection==
Van Halen began assembling his collection around 1700 by painting miniature portraits himself that he copied from engravings. For contemporary poets he enlisted the help of friends and colleagues. Before he died he managed to collect 346 portraits, of which 80 are now in the collection of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. His cabinet was very popular and several books mentioned it or had it as a subject, including Houbraken in his ''[[Schouburgh]]'' when he claimed it held portraits of over 100 people (Houbraken was writing in 1712).&lt;ref name=Houbraken&gt;{{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}} [http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/houb005groo01_01/houb005groo01_01_0289.htm Arnoud van Halen's "Kabinet" mentioned] in ''De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen'' (1718) by [[Arnold Houbraken]], courtesy of the [[Digital library for Dutch literature]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the book==
The most notable book was published by the man who purchased his collection after Van Halen died in 1732, Michiel de Roode. De Roode published the book in 1773 as a member of Leiden's learned society ‘Kunst wordt door arbeid verkreegen’ (art is accomplished by work) which paid for the edition. That the book was popular is attested by the fact that in 1808 the [[Teylers Museum|Teyler's Stichting]] gave [[Wybrand Hendriks]] the request to purchase it for up to 500 guilders at auction, and Hendriks bought it for 200 guilders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teylersmuseum.eu/teylersuniversum/index.php?m=narratio&amp;id=33 Teylers Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714165146/http://www.teylersmuseum.eu/teylersuniversum/index.php?m=narratio&amp;id=33 |date=2014-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6922">'''PerfKit Benchmarker''' is an open source benchmarking tool used to measure and compare cloud offerings. PerfKit Benchmarker is licensed under the [[Apache License|Apache 2 license]] terms. PerfKit Benchmarker is a community effort involving over 500 participants including researchers, academic institutions and companies together with the originator, [[Google]].

== General ==
PerfKit Benchmarker (PKB) is a community effort to deliver a repeatable, consistent, and open way of measuring Cloud Performance.  It supports a growing list of cloud providers including: [[Alibaba Cloud]], [[Amazon Web Services]], [[CloudStack]], [[DigitalOcean]], [[Google Cloud Platform]], [[Kubernetes]], [[Microsoft Azure]], [[OpenStack]], [[Rackspace]], [[IBM Bluemix|IBM Bluemix (Softlayer)]].  In addition to Cloud Providers to supports container orchestration including [[Kubernetes]] [http://kubernetes.io/] and [[Apache Mesos|Mesos]] [http://mesos.apache.org/] and [[local "static" workstations and clusters of computers]] [https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/PerfKitBenchmarker/wiki/Can-I-run-PerfKitBenchmarker-on-my-local-machine-or-data-center%3F].

The goal is to create an open source living benchmark [framework] that represents how Cloud developers are building applications, evaluating Cloud alternatives, learning how to architect applications for each cloud. Living because it will change and morph quickly as developers change.

PerfKit Benchmarker measures the end to end time to provision resources in the cloud, in addition to reporting on the most standard metrics of peak performance, e.g.: latency, throughput, time-to-complete, IOPS. PerfKit Benchmarker reduces the complexity in running benchmarks on supported cloud providers by unified and simple commands. It's designed to operate via vendor provided command line tools.

PerfKit Benchmarker contains a canonical set of public benchmarks. All benchmarks are running with default/initial state and configuration (Not tuned to in favor of any providers). This provides a way to benchmark across cloud platforms, while getting a transparent view of application throughput, latency, variance, and overhead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.com/2015/02/new-open-source-tools-for-measuring-cloud-performance.html  Google Cloud Platform Blog Post for PerfKit Benchmarker]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
PerfKit Benchmarker (PKB) was started by Anthony F. Voellm, Alain Hamel, and Eric Hankland at Google in 2014.  Once an initial "alpha" was in place Anthony F. Voellm and Ivan Santa Maria Filho built a community including ARM, Broadcom, Canonical, CenturyLink, Cisco, CloudHarmony, CloudSpectator, EcoCloud@EPFL, Intel, Mellanox, Microsoft, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., Rackspace, Red Hat, Tradeworx Inc., and Thesys Technologies LLC.

This community worked together behind the scenes in a private GitHub project to create an open way to measure cloud performance. This community released the first public "beta" was released on February 11, 2015 and announced in a [http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.com/2015/02/new-open-source-tools-for-measuring-cloud-performance.html blog post] at which point the [https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/PerfKitBenchmarker GitHub project] was open to everyone.  After almost a year and with large adaption (600+ participants on GitHub) the [http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.com/2015/12/measuring-cloud-performance-just-got-easier-and-better.html V1.0.0 was released along with a detailed architectural design] on December 10, 2015.

Many members have made significant contributions for which the PKB community is very appreciative. In particular Carlos Torres from Rackspace and Mateusz Blaszkowski from Intel made such significant contributions they became the first members outside Google to have "committer" rights.

You can find out more about the [https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/PerfKitBenchmarker/wiki PKB community on GitHub and how to participate.]

== Industry Participants ==
Since [[Google]] open sourced the PerfKitBenchmarker, it became a community effort from over 30 leading researchers, academic schools and industry companies. Those organizations include: [[ARM Holdings|ARM]], [[Broadcom]], [[Canonical Ltd.|Canonical]], [[CenturyLink]], [[Cisco]], [https://cloudharmony.com/  CloudHarmony], [http://cloudspectator.com/ Cloud Spectator], [http://ecocloud.ch EcoCloud]@[[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne|EPFL]], [[Intel]], [[Mellanox]], [[Microsoft]], [[Qualcomm Technologies]], [[Rackspace]], [[Red Hat]], and [http://www.thesystech.com/ Thesys Technologies]. In addition, [[Stanford]] and [[MIT]] are leading quarterly discussions on default benchmarks and settings proposed by the community. [http://ecocloud.ch EcoCloud]@[[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne|EPFL]] is integrating [http://cloudsuite.ch/ CloudSuite] into PerfKit Benchmarker.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1261">In '''''S v Lavhengwa''''', an important case in [[South African criminal law]], it was held that the right created in section 35(3)(a) of the Constitution, which provides that the right to a fair trial includes the right to be informed of the charge with sufficient detail to answer it, implies that the criminal charge itself must be clear and unambiguous. This, according to the court, would only be the case if the nature of the crime is sufficiently clear and unambiguous to comply with the constitutional right to be sufficiently informed of the charge.

It was further held that, in order to comply with the requirement of sufficient clarity, one should bear in mind

* that absolute clarity is not required, reasonable clarity being sufficient; and
* that a court, in deciding whether a provision is clear or vague, should approach the legislation on the basis that it is dealing with reasonable people, not foolish or capricious ones....

'''''Salted: A Manifesto on the World's Most Essential Mineral, with Recipes''''' ([[Ten Speed Press]], 2010) is a reference book and cookbook written by food writer [[Mark Bitterman]]. In May 2011 ''Salted'' won the [[James Beard Foundation Award]] for Reference and Scholarship Cookbook. It has also been nominated for the [[International Association of Culinary Professionals]] Cookbook Awards for the Food &amp; Beverage Reference/Technical category and First Book: The Julia Child Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fernandez |first1=Jenny |title=James Beard and IACP Award Nominee: Salted by Mark Bitterman |url=http://www.therecipeclub.net/2011/05/05/james-beard-and-iacp-award-nominee-salted-by-mark-bitterman |deadurl=y|website=The Recipe Club |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110530202134/http://www.therecipeclub.net/2011/05/05/james-beard-and-iacp-award-nominee-salted-by-mark-bitterman |archivedate=May 30, 2011 |date=May 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is available both in hardcover and on the [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]].

==Background==
Bitterman's fascination with salt started at age 20 when, on a motorcycle trip across Europe, he stopped at a provincial French truck stop and had a grilled steak finished with a locally harvested ''[[fleur de sel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Salted: A Manifesto on the World's Most Essential Mineral, With Recipes |last=Bitterman |first=Mark |year=2010 |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location= |isbn=978-1-58008-262-4 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years Bitterman continued to travel the world while collecting artisan-made salts. He eventually went on to open a store with his wife called The Meadow, where they sell a variety of finishing salts as well as [[chocolate|dark chocolates]], [[bitters]], wine, and flowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Salted: A Manifesto on the World's Most Essential Mineral, With Recipes |last=Bitterman |first=Mark |year=2010 |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location= |isbn=978-1-58008-262-4 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Meadow was started in Portland, Oregon and has since expanded to the [[West Village]] in New York. ''Salted'' was released in October 2010.

==Contents==
The book is divided into three sections.
*"The Life of Salt" – This section treats the history of salt from its supposed first use by humans for preservation approximately 12,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Salted: A Manifesto on the World's Most Essential Mineral, With Recipes |last=Bitterman |first=Mark |year=2010 |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location= |isbn=978-1-58008-262-4 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salt took on increasing importance in the Neolithic period as humans developed agriculture and domestication of wild plants and animals. Salt-preserved foods and treated animal hides enabled wider travel and the construction of empires; salt is written about in ancient religious scriptures and has played a large part in the development of some economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Salted: A Manifesto on the World's Most Essential Mineral, With Recipes |last=Bitterman |first=Mark |year=2010 |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location= |isbn=978-1-58008-262-4 |pages=18–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Saltmaking was an artisanal craft up until the industrial revolution, when mechanization allowed production to increase rapidly. More recently, this industrially produced salt has come to be used in chemical manufacturing as well as for clearing wide stretches of icy roads and freeways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Salted: A Manifesto on the World's Most Essential Mineral, With Recipes |last=Bitterman |first=Mark |year=2010 |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location= |isbn=978-1-58008-262-4 |pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:In this section Bitterman goes on to detail salt's role in biochemistry and addresses the controversy it has provoked in the public health sector. Lastly, he discusses the taxonomy of salt and his take on how to describe a salt.

*"Salt Guide" – This chapter contains a chart of over 150 salts. Each has a [[macro photography|macro photograph]] of its crystals as well as columns for description, application (finishing, cooking, [[brining]], etc.), flavor, and recommended food uses. This is followed by a section of longer entries on 80 salts wherein one can find more in-depth descriptions and information on a salt's alternate names and producers.
*"Salting" – Here Bitterman lays out his suggestions for "strategic salting"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Daley |first1=Bill |title=Rules of strategic salting from a 'selmelier' |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/dining/recipes/ct-food-0323-salt-add-20110323-story.html |work=Chicago Tribune |date=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some pointers on key salts for the kitchen and important salting techniques. He then provides recipes for using salts in various cooking techniques (raw, curing, grilling, baking, etc.) as well as recipes utilizing Himalayan salt blocks for serving and cooking food.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9800">The '''James Simpson-Roosevelt Asiatic Expedition''' was a 1925 expedition sponsored by the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] and organized by [[Kermit Roosevelt]] and his brother [[Theodore Roosevelt, Jr]].

==Finance and organization==
{{quotation|In 1924, the Roosevelts decided they wanted to organize an expedition through Asia for the purposes of scientific achievement. They gained the interest of Field Museum President Stanley Field and Director Davies who were able to secure funding from science enthusiast James Simpson for their trip focusing on exploring the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamirs]], [[Turkestan]] and the [[Tian Shan|Tian Shan Mountains]]. ... The Roosevelts would be the first to procure a collection of the wildlife in this region for an American museum. At the end of their journey they had collected over two thousand specimens of small mammals, birds and reptiles, along with seventy large mammals, including [[Marco Polo sheep|''Ovis Poli'']], the great wild sheep.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fieldmuseum.org/theodore-and-kermit-roosevelt Theodore and Kermit Roosevelt, The Field Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

James Simpson (1874–1939),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Simpson, James|journal=The Book of Chicagoans: A Biographical Dictionary of Leading Living Men and Women of the City of Chicago|year=1917|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015013310340;view=1up;seq=644}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=James Simpsons, Utilities Chief, Dies|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=26 November 1939|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1939/11/26/page/1/article/james-simpson-utilities-chief-dies}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Field Museum trustee who had first been elected to that position in 1921,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Annual Report of the Director to the Board of Trustees for 1921|publisher=Field Museum of Natural History|date=January 1922|page=12|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000052861871;view=1up;seq=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; financed the expedition but remained in Chicago. The expedition's main participants were the two Roosevelt brothers, the naturalist [[George Kruck Cherrie|George K. Cherrie]], the photographer C. Suydam Cutting,&lt;ref&gt;[http://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_arc_296615 Charles Suydam Cutting (1889–1972), Smithsonian Institution Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; two experienced hunters from [[Bandipur]] and several other Hindustani-speaking men who joined the expedition in [[Srinagar]]. The Roosevelts secured permission from the Chinese government to cross the Himalayas into Chinese territory.

==Itinerary and results==
George Cherrie went by freighter with the expedition's equipment, along with four cougar hounds, to [[Karachi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roosevelt, T.|author2=Roosevelt, K.|title=East of the sun and west of the moon|year=1926|page=17|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015027068892;view=1up;seq=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theodore and Kermit Roosevelt with Suydam Cutting departed from New York City on 11 April 1925 aboard [[SS Leviathan]]. In England they secured, with the help of the Soviet envoy [[Christian Rakovsky|Rakovsky]], permission to enter the Russian Pamirs. Stopping in Paris to buy presents for Asians they might encounter, the three Americans went by rail to Marseilles and then by ship to Bombay, arriving on May 11th. On May 19th the expedition left Srinagar with a caravan of 60 ponies. Via the [[Zoji Pass]] they reached [[Leh]] about June 1st and then collected several specimens of the [[barhal]] and the [[Tibetan antelope]]. For more than 2 weeks, the expedition journeyed through the high Himalayas and lost 14 of their 60 ponies, before reaching [[Sanju Pass|Sanju Bazaar]] in eastern Turkestan on July 5th. A few days later the party reached [[Yarkant (town)|Yarkand]], where they split up. Cutting went northwest to [[Kashgar]]; Cherrie collected birds, small mammals and reptiles in central Turkestan; the Roosevelts with the two Bandipur [[wiktionary:shikari|shikari]]s went to the Tian Shan Mountains for big game hunting.&lt;ref name=AnnualReport1925&gt;{{cite journal|title=Zoology|journal=Annual Report of the Director to the Board of Trustees for 1925|publisher=Field Museum of Natural History|date=January 1926|pages=431–434|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000052861871;view=1up;seq=583}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Tian Shan range, the Roosevelts shot and collected specimens of [[Altai wapiti]], [[argali|Tian Shan sheep]], [[Siberian roe deer]], Asiatic brown bear, and a comprehensive museum group of Tian Shan ibex. After departing the Tian Shan Mountains, the Roosevelts arrived in Kashgar on September 28th and then in the Russian Pamirs successfully shot and collected a museum group  of [[Marco Polo sheep]]. The Roosevelts returned to British India via the [[Khunjerab Pass]] and arrived in Kashmir on November 3rd.&lt;ref name=AnnualReport1925/&gt;

Cherrie and Cutting met in the Tian Shan region on September 7th.

{{quotation|Further collecting of birds and small mammals was done there and then they returned to Kashgar whence they started home via Russian Turkestan and Constantinople, carrying with them practically the entire collection made by the expedition. This included some 21 skins, skulls and bones of large game, 700 to 1,000 skins of birds and small mammals, and tanks of reptiles or amphibians preserved in alcohol or formaldehyde. They journeyed overland northwest and crossed the Russian border at [[Irkeshtam|Irkeshtan]], November 6th. Ten days later they reached the railhead at [[Andijan]] and there arranged for railway transport of themselves and their collections to [[Batum]] on the Black Sea.&lt;ref name=AnnualReport1925/&gt;}}

Cutting returned directly to the United States and after some difficulty and delays Cherrie managed the successful return of the baggage to the United States.&lt;ref name=AnnualReport1925/&gt;

The Roosevelt brothers met their wives in Srinagar in early November&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roosevelt, T.|author2=Roosevelt, K.|title=East of the sun and west of the moon|year=1926|page=274|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015027068892;view=1up;seq=298}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then after some more shooting and collecting of specimens in British India, the party returned to the United States.

==Discovery and earlier collections==
On this expedition a new species of [[skink]], ''[[Eutropis allapallensis]]'', was discovered; [[Karl Patterson Schmidt|Karl P. Schmidt]] described the expedition's preserved skink specimen, which was collected in the [[Allapalli#Allapalli Forest|Allapalli Forest]], and named the new species ''Mabuya allapallensis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://archive.org/details/amphibiansreptil1213schm|author=Schmidt, K. P.|year=1926|title=Amphibians and Reptiles of the James Simpson-Roosevelt Asiatic Expedition|journal=Fieldiana Zoology|volume=12|issue=13|pages=167-173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|The region in which the expedition worked had previously been visited by several naturalists. The foremost collections are those made in the early seventies of the last century by the two Yarkand Missions under [[Thomas Douglas Forsyth|T. D. Forsyth]], whose ornithological results were reported upon by Henderson and [[Allan Octavian Hume|Hume]], Scully, and [[Richard Bowdler Sharpe|Sharpe]]. Other contributions to the ornithology of the [[Tarim Basin|Tarim basin]] are due to [[Mikhail Aleksandrovich Menzbier|Menzbier]], [[Nikolay Przhevalsky|Przewalski]], and [[Herman_Schalow|Schalow]], while [[William Louis Abbott|Dr. W. L. Abbott]]'s travels added considerably to our knowledge of the bird-life of the western Himalayas and Eastern Turkestan. In the Tian Shan Mountains, Severtzow,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Brief obituary notice of N. A.

'''Stephan Scott Grundy''' (born 1967 in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]], United States), commonly known as '''Stephan Grundy''', and also known by the pen-name '''Kveldulf Gundarsson''', is an [[American literature|American author]], scholar, [[goði]] and proponent of [[Germanic Neopaganism|Asatru]]. Grundy grew up in [[Dallas]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]]. He now lives in [[Shinrone]], [[County Offaly]], [[Ireland]]. He has over two dozen published books and a number of published papers. He is best known for his modern adaptations of legendary [[Norse saga|sagas]] and also a non-fiction writer on [[Norse mythology|Germanic mythology]], [[Germanic paganism]], and [[Germanic neopaganism]].

==Novels==

===Rhinegold===
Grundy began working on his first complete [[novel]] during his first year at [[Southern Methodist University]] in Dallas, where he was studying English and German [[philology]]. Originally, the novel was intended to be based on the [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] [[epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Beowulf]]'', but Grundy was convinced by his professor [[Stephen Flowers|Dr.&amp;nbsp;Stephen Flowers]] (author of numerous widely respected works about Germanic history and [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]) that the [[Nibelung]] legend would be a more appropriate basis for a first novel.

Grundy wrote most of the novel in a [[dormitory]] at the [[University of St Andrews]], Scotland, where he spent one year as an [[student exchange program|exchange student]]. He also spent a year as an exchange student in [[Bonn]], Germany - virtually at the foot of the ''Drachenberg'' - spending some of his time on research for his novel (which also led him all across [[Scandinavia]]). ''Rhinegold'' — a retelling of the entire [[Sigurð]] cycle&lt;ref&gt;John Clute and John Grant, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', New York: St. Martin's, 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mfjAjibERF0C&amp;pg=PA692&amp;dq=%22Stephan+Grundy%22&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=21#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Stephan%20Grundy%22&amp;f=false p. 692].&lt;/ref&gt; [[dedication|dedicated]] to, among others, [[Richard Wagner]] and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] — came out in 1994, and quickly developed into an international [[bestseller|best-seller]].&lt;ref&gt;Like Wagner, Grundy used the Scandinavian version of the story. The German translation proved more popular than the English original. Winder McConnell, ''A companion to the Nibelungenlied'', Columbia, South Carolina: Camden House, 1998, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wu0B6_XO3boC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=%22Stephan+Grundy%22&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Stephan%20Grundy%22&amp;f=false p. 140].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Grundy received his PhD from the [[Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic, University of Cambridge]] with a dissertation on [[Odin]]: "The Cult of Óðinn: God of Death?".&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Scott Grundy, 'The Cult of Óðinn: God of Death?' (unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, Cambridge University, 1995); the thesis was accompanied by a self-published book, Stephan Grundy, ''Miscellaneous Studies Towards the Cult of Odinn'' (Everett, WA: Vikar, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terri Windling]] identified ''Rhinegold'' as one of the best fantasy debuts of 1994, describing it as "both scholarly and entertaining".&lt;ref&gt;"Summation 1994: Fantasy," ''[[The Year's Best Fantasy and Horror]]: Eighth Annual Collection'', p.xviii&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attila’s Treasure===
Two years later, 1996, Grundy completed ''Attila’s Treasure'', focused less on [[Attila the Hun]] than on Grundy’s favorite legendary figure, [[Hagen (legend)|Hagen]]. This novel, too, was an international success, but to a lesser degree than the forerunner novel ''Rhinegold.''

===Gilgamesh===
This was followed in 1999 by ''Gilgamesh,'' a modern adaptation of the [[Sumer]]ian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' that attempts to address directly the homosexual nature of the original text largely ignored by modern scholars. This was less well received than the two earlier novels. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===Falcon Dreams Series===
With Melodi Lammond-Grundy, Grundy has since published the Falcon Dreams series, a trilogy first published in German and available in English in e-book format: ''Falcon’s Flight'' (2000), ''Eagle and Falcon'' (2002), and ''Falcon’s Night'' (2002).

==Non-fiction works as Kveldulf Gundarsson and influence in Germanic neopaganism==

Before publishing his first novel, Grundy published, as Kveldulf Gundarsson, two books on [[Germanic neopaganism]] and Germanic [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. He has since edited and co-written both editions of the handbook of [[The Troth]], ''Our Troth'', and written other works on ancient and modern [[Germanic paganism]] and Germanic [[culture]].

Grundy was previously Lore Warden and Master of the Elder Training Program for the Ring of Troth (now known simply as The Troth) and carried on the organization's tradition of being based in scholarship, started by [[Stephen Flowers|Edred Thorsson]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Jeffrey, "Chapter Nine: The Reconstruction of the Ásatrú and Odinist Traditions" in Lewis, James R.

The '''''Synopsis Chronike''''' ({{lang-el|Σύνοψις Χρονικὴ}}) is a 13th-century [[universal chronicle]], from the [[Genesis creation narrative|Creation]] until the [[Alexios Strategopoulos|recapture]] of [[Constantinople]] by the [[Byzantine Greeks|Greeks]] in 1261. A. Heisenberg has shown it was written by the Bishop of [[Cyzicus]], [[Theodore Skoutariotes]], and this identification has been generally accepted since. 

The chronicle comprises two parts, the first, ranging from the Creation to the accession of [[Alexios I Komnenos]] in 1081, being a typical chronicle, while the second, from 1081 to 1261, is a detailed historical account. A portion of the second part consists of excerpts from [[Niketas Choniates]] and [[George Akropolites]], but the material derived from Akropolites includes much additional information, which [[George Ostrogorsky]] wrote "give the chronicle its real value as a source."&lt;ref&gt;Ostrogorsky, ''History of the Byzantine State'', translated by Joan Hussey (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1957), p. 371&lt;/ref&gt; The chronicle was first edited and published by the Greek scholar [[Konstantinos Sathas]] in 1894 in his ''Medieval Library'' (Μεσαιωνική Βιβλιοθήκη) series, and is hence sometimes known as the '''''Synopsis Sathas'''''.

The '''Green Book''' is a training and induction manual issued by the [[Irish Republican Army]] to new volunteers. It was used by the post-[[Irish Civil War]] [[Irish Republican Army (1922–1969)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) and [[Cumann na mBan]], (''"League of Women"''), along with later incarnations such as the [[Provisional IRA]] (PIRA). It includes a statement of military objectives, tactics and conditions for military victory against the [[British government]]. This military victory was to be achieved as part of ''"the ongoing liberation of Ireland from foreign occupiers"''. The Green Book has acted as a manual of conduct and induction to the organisation since at least the 1950s.

==History ==
Because the IRA and later republican groupings have been identified as illegal organisations (the PIRA, IRA &amp; [[Cumann na mBan]] have been proscribed - declared illegal - in the UK, the Republic of Ireland and a number of other countries)&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100402185442/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/ukpga_20000011_en_12#sch2 The National Archives], [[Terrorism Act 2000]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/509003/20160318proscription.pdf List of proscribed terrorist groups]] updated by the [[Home Office]] in 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/0828/66937-mcdowellm/ Report of statement outlining legal status of the IRA] in the Republic of Ireland by former [[Minister for Justice and Equality]], [[Michael McDowell (politician)|Michael McDowell]] in 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/45323.pdf Country Reports on Terrorism 2004] [[US Department of State]] report to [[US Congress]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Green Book has been distributed and published secretly. It is published at unknown printing presses and distributed to or shared with IRA volunteers as they are accepted for active duty. Due to this secrecy only two editions of the Green Book have so far been released into the public domain. The first, published in 1956, appears to be intact. The second, publication date unknown but dating to the 1977 detention of then IRA Chief of Staff [[Seamus Twomey]], has only been released in three parts (referred to here as the 1977 edition). With the beginning of the latest IRA ceasefire and the 2005 ending of their campaign, it seems unlikely that a new edition of the manual will have been issued in recent years by the IRA. However, it is possible that known/unknown groupings have issued a more recent version.

==Volunteers' treatment of the Green Book==
The Green Book is issued to IRA volunteers as part of their training and is considered a secret document which should not be revealed to, or discussed with non-IRA members. In order to protect the organisation, disclosure of its training material and any other training documents, including the Green Book, would most likely carry stiff penalties up to and including Court Martial. Once issued, each volunteer is expected to study and learn from his/her copy of the manual, to apply the rules given in it, and to apply lessons learnt from it. While the manual is clearly not all the training a volunteer could expect, it gave a broad overview meant to go some way to preparing the volunteer for active duty with the organisation.

==1977 and 1956 editions==
Both known issues of the Green Book were in existence while the IRA, (in the case of the 1956 edition), and the PIRA, (in the case of the 1977 edition), were engaged in a military campaign. In 1956, this was the [[Border Campaign (IRA)|Border Campaign]], in the 1970s it was the terrorist [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969-1997]].

Commonalities and differences exist between the two documents. This demonstrates that the Green Book is a living document updated periodically. These updates are made to reflect changes in:

*political policy and social structure
*military strategy and tactics of the organisation
*military strength of the organisation
*the technology/tactics of the organisation's enemies

While splits in the IRA since 1922 up to the 1950s do not appear to be noted in the 1956 document, developments in the fields of insurgency and counter-insurgency are. Both [[T. E. Lawrence]] and Field Marshal Sir [[William Slim]] are quoted.&lt;ref&gt;[[T. E. Lawrence]] is mis-quoted slightly, the quote used is from "Evolution of a Revolt" available [http://www-cgsc.army.mil/carl/resources/csi/Lawrence/lawrence.asp here] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614010151/http://www-cgsc.army.mil/carl/resources/csi/Lawrence/lawrence.asp |date=2006-06-14 }}, the misquote takes place in a section describing the guerrilla as leaving as small a footprint on the battlefield as possible. Lawrence is quoted as saying, ''"the smallest force in the quickest time at the farthest place."'' The quote from British Chief of the General Staff and Commander of the 14th
Army, Field Marshal Sir William Slim used in the Green Book appears on [http://www.hqusareur.army.mil/STRATCOM%20Messages/Documents/Serving%20a%20Nation%20at%20War.pdf this] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060621062539/http://www.hqusareur.army.mil/STRATCOM%20Messages/Documents/Serving%20a%20Nation%20at%20War.pdf |date=2006-06-21 }} Official US Army strategy PDF document page 15&lt;/ref&gt; The 1977 edition appears to have been more heavily influenced by the work of Brigadier General [[Frank Kitson]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;Kitson had been publishing books on counter-insurgency since the 1960s, with the support of his peers in the British military &amp; Intelligence services. It is clear the IRA were aware of his work - they had seen it used on the ground by their enemies in Africa, and Asia during the 1950s &amp; 1960s before it was fully introduced to [[Northern Ireland]]. For a review of Kitson's "Low intensity operations: subversion, insurgency, peacekeeping (1971)" see [http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/27/054.html here.] A knowledge of Brigadier General Kitson is key to understanding most of the military and strategic decisions taken by the IRA during the period.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; &lt;!-- A real citation is needed, not merely an assertion of fact. --&gt;

By the 1977 edition, the document had increased in scope, with length remaining around the same. Some doctrinal sections from the 1956 edition were still appearing, while new sections aimed at combating the counter-insurgency efforts of the British Army and RUC had appeared. Notably the 1977 edition would have existed alongside the IRA's change in tactics towards the entirely self-reliant cell structure. The 1956 edition on the other hand discusses the use of the [[IRA flying column]] - en masse attacks by large groups of volunteers against concentrations of the enemy. Another notable facet of the 1977 edition is the attention paid to the mental preparation of IRA Volunteers, this being the time of the IRA's ''"Long War"'' strategy. Readers of the 1977 edition are warned:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Army as an organisation claims and expects your total allegiance without reservation. It enters into every aspect of your life. It invades the privacy of your home life, it fragments your family and friends, in other words claims your total allegiance. All potential volunteers must realise that the threat of capture and of long jail sentences are a very real danger and a shadow which hangs over every volunteer..."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Another important aspect all potential volunteers should think about is their ability to obey orders from a superior officer. All volunteers must obey orders issued to them by a superior officer regardless of whether they like the particular officer or not".&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The 1956 edition contains no such warning, but appeals to the "guerrilla code." In 'Chapter Five - Organisation and Arms', the reader is advised:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Leadership will not come so much by appointment as by the trust the guerrillas place in their commander. He must be worthy of that trust if he is to succeed. Instead of discipline of the regular army type there will be a more stern battle discipline: agreement on the job to be done, and the need to do it, and obedience to the guerrilla code, these take the place of the unthinking army type discipline. Breaches of the guerrilla code — desertion, betrayal, breach of confidence in any way — must be severely dealt with on the spot".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Contents of the Green Book==
The book contains information on: 

*political philosophy of the IRA
*Irish history in terms of struggle against the occupation of Ireland
*the military objectives of the organisation
*the military strategy for [[guerrilla]] fighters
*the military equipment and tools that can be used by guerrilla fighters
*the military equipment and training for tools available to the IRA
*propaganda techniques within the theatre of operations
*interrogation techniques and how to resist them

The book has also included references to the training, development, and tactics employed by Regular &amp; Irregular/Specialist forces in modern armies - particularly those of the [[British Army]].

==Green Book historical context==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:1974election.jpg|thumb|100px|right|PIRA poster from 1974 attempting to establish a lineage between the 1916 Rebellion and present day.]] --&gt;
The 1956 document couches the violence and occupation of the island of Ireland in a long history of armed resistance to occupation. The first chapter is entirely taken up with providing this history from the viewpoint of the organisation. It provides information on the [[rapparee|Kerne]], the [[battle of the Yellow Ford]], [[Owen Roe O'Neill]], the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 Rebellion]] and [[United Irishmen]], [[James Fintan Lalor]], and the ''"[[Irish War of Independence|Tan War]]"''. All are described as being within the context of legitimate resistance to the occupation of Ireland. This discussion is largely romanticised and aimed at demonstrating a lineage of ''"armed struggle"'' from which the IRA assumes its legitimacy in the fight against ''"occupying forces in Ireland"''. One entry in this discussion is the fact that the efforts of [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] guerrillas were the direct cause in ending the British occupation of the 26 counties of Ireland—the territory that would become the [[Irish Free State]], and later the [[Republic of Ireland]]. The 1956 manual also implies that the bulk of the IRA's work in "freeing Ireland from occupation" is over. This indicates both a "southern" perspective on Irish independence and an underestimation of the resistance they would encounter during the [[Border Campaign (IRA)|Border Campaign]], that was aimed at the end of British rule in [[Northern Ireland]]. With the publication of the 1977 edition this assumption of an easy victory in ending partition had been dropped and the "[[Provisional Irish Republican Army#The .22Long War.22|Long War]]" strategy adopted.

The 1956 edition summarises the result of the violence during the 1919-1921 [[Irish War of Independence]] (referred to by republicans, who considered independence as having been only partially achieved, as the [[Black and Tans|Tan War]]) with this passage:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The hammer blows of the guerrillas destroyed the British administration. The guerrillas acted in small numbers in the right localities and compelled the British to disperse to find them. Then as the British searched, they hit them at will by means of the ambush. Communications were systematically destroyed and even the British army's transport system in the country was disorganised."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The enemy's intelligence service was completely dislocated. The [[Royal Irish Constabulary|R.I.C.]]- the eyes and ears of British rule- was demoralised. British justice courts could not operate--for the people ignored them. The British gradually were forced to evacuate the smaller, more isolated garrisons. They concentrated in the larger towns. The areas evacuated came under sole control of The Republic. The next step was to isolate the larger centres and keep cutting communications and constantly hitting the enemy. In time these would have been evacuated too. Thus ended the last great phase of guerrilla operations against British rule in Ireland."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Compare to the [[Marxist]] intrepretation in the 1977 edition, published during a new campaign and new conditions of waging war. The ''"struggle"'' is couched in more socio-economic terms, terms which would have made more sense to a generation living through unemployment and economic hardship in post industrial revolution Northern Ireland (referred to here as the "six counties"). It is also an indication of the influence of [[Marxist Philosophy]] that permeated the IRA in the late 1970s:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The objective of the 800 years of oppression 'is economic exploitation with the unjustly partitioned 6 counties remaining Britain's directly controlled old-style colony' and the South under the 'continuing social, cultural and economic domination of London'. This last led to Irish savings being invested in England 'for a higher interest rate' and many hundreds of thousands of boys and girls from this country had to emigrate to England to seek the employment which those exported saving created."&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Another aspect of economic imperialism at work is the export of raw, unprocessed materials: live cattle on the hoof - mineral wealth, fish caught by foreign trawlers, etc. Further, from 1956 on, the Free State abandoned all attempts to secure an independent economy, and brought in foreign multi-national companies to create jobs instead of buying their skills and then sending them home gradually. Africanisation' is the word for this process elsewhere. Control of our affairs in all of Ireland lies more than ever since 1921 outside the hands of the Irish people. The logical outcome of all this was full immersion in the [[European Economic Community|E.E.C.]] in the 1970s. The Republican Movement opposed this North and South in 1972 and 1975 and continues to do so. It is against such political economic power blocks East and West and military alliances such as [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]]."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While the 1956 edition does not engage in any legitimisation of the struggle beyond the historical context of resistance to occupation, the 1977 edition does - claiming direct legitimacy from the members of the [[Second Dáil]] who transferred their authority to the IRA in 1938 after the takeover of the IRA Army Council by [[Seán Russell]]. This had always been the official ideology of the IRA, however after the split between the [[Provisional IRA]] and the [[Official IRA]] in 1969 it was probably deemed necessary to lay more of a claim to the historical struggle than the pre-split IRA had felt necessary. The 1956 edition would have also been published for use during a period when the failed [[S-Plan]] or Sabotage campaign was within living memory of younger IRA volunteers. Newer volunteers needed to be reminded of previous IRA activity in the ''"struggle for liberation"'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The moral position of the Irish Republican Army, its right to engage in warfare, is based on: 
:*(a) the right to resist foreign aggression;
:*(b) the right to revolt against tyranny and oppression; and
:*(c) the direct lineal succession with the Provisional Government of 1916, the first Dáil of 1919 and the second Dáil of 1921".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In 1938 the seven surviving faithful Republican Deputies delegated executive powers to the Army Council of the I.R.A. per the 1921 resolution. In 1969 the sole surviving Deputy, Joseph Clarke, reaffirmed publicly that the then Provisional Army Council and its successors were the inheritors of the first and second Dáil as a Provisional Government."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In November 2003, during testimony to the [[Bloody Sunday Inquiry|Saville Inquiry]] on the events of [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]], [[Martin McGuinness]], the alleged former Chief of Staff of the IRA, denied that he had ever read such a book before reputedly leaving the IRA in 1974. McGuinness reportedly said: "When I was in the IRA there was no such book, I don't know when it came into existence." When asked what the phrase "green book" meant, he stated: "I think it means the book was green."&lt;ref&gt;''McGuinness risks jail for not naming IRA comrades'' The Guardian November 6, 2003 [https://www.theguardian.com/bloodysunday/article/0,,1078801,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1977 edition of the Green Book is very much focused on the mental strength of the volunteer. The manual is eager to draw a clear distinction between volunteer and his enemy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A member of the I.R.A. is such by his own choice, his convictions being the only factor which compels him to volunteer, his objectives the political freedom and social and economic justice for his people. Apart from the few minutes in the career of the average Brit that he comes under attack, the Brit has no freedom or personal initiative. He is told when to sleep, where to sleep, when to get up, where to spend his free time etc."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 1977 edition, the term guerrilla is dropped in favour of "volunteer"; the new edition also stresses that this volunteer is part of a movement with common aims and objectives. From the PIRA's point of view, this would have been necessary to combating competing interpretations encountered in the community and the propaganda efforts of the enemy they faced:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Before we go on the offensive politically or militarily we take the greatest defensive precautions possible to ensure success, e.g. we do not advocate a United Ireland without being able to justify our right to such a state as opposed to partition; we do not employ revolutionary violence as our means without being able to illustrate that we have no recourse to any other means. Or in more everyday simple terms: we do not claim that we are going to escalate the war if we cannot do just that; we do not mount an operation without first having ensured that we have taken the necessary defensive precautions of accurate intelligence, security, that weapons are in proper working order with proper ammunition and that the volunteers involved know how to handle interrogations in the event of their capture etc, and of course that the operation itself enhances rather than alienates our supporters."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 1956 edition on the other hand stresses the physical aspects of IRA operations:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Outside of the support he [the guerrilla] gets from the people among whom he operates-and this support must never be underestimated for it is vital to his eventual success-he fights alone. He is part of an independent formation that is in effect an army by itself. He must be self-contained. If necessary he must act alone and fight alone with the weapons at his disposal- and these very often will not be of the best. He must find his own supplies. His endurance has to be great: and for this he needs a fit body and an alert mind. Above all he must know what he is fighting for- and why."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Military objectives in the Green Book== &lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:PIRA-longwar.gif|thumb|100px|right|An insight into PIRA strategic thinking as presented to PIRA volunteers of the late 1970's.]] --&gt;

The 1977 edition describes the military objectives of the IRA as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The position of the Irish Republican Army since its foundation in 1916 has been one of sustained resistance and implacable hostility to the forces of imperialism, always keeping in the forefront of the most advanced revolutionary thinking and the latest guerrilla warfare techniques in the world."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The enemy is described as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The establishment is all those who have a vested interest in maintaining the present status quo in politicians, media, judiciary, certain business elements and the Brit war machine comprising, the [[British Army|Brit Army]], the [[Ulster Defence Regiment|U.D.R.]], [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|R.U.C.]] (r) [reserve], [[Northern Ireland Prison Service|Screws]], Civilian Searchers. The cure for these armed branches of the establishment is well known and documented. But with the possible exceptions of the Brit Ministers in the 'Northern Ireland Office' and certain members of the judiciary, the overtly unarmed branches of the establishment are not so clearly identifiable to the people as our enemies as say armed Brits or R.U.C."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The military objects of the IRA in 1977 are presented as closely tied to the political objectives of politicising the citizenry. Rather than the tactic of surgical strike, the tactic of continuous escalation or the strategy of what has been called the [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969–1997#Libyan_arms_and_the_.22Tet_Offensive.22|PIRA's Tet offensive]] is preferred:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"By now it is clear that our task is not only to kill as many enemy personnel as possible but of equal importance to create support which will carry us not only through a war of liberation which could last another decade but which will support us past the 'Brits Out' stage to the ultimate aim of a Democratic Socialist Republic."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Strategy is: 
# A war of attrition against enemy personnel which is aimed at causing as many casualties and deaths as possible so as to create a demand from their people at home for their withdrawal.
# A bombing campaign aimed at making the enemy's financial interest in our country unprofitable while at the same time curbing long term financial investment in our country.
# To make the Six Counties as at present and for the past several years ungovernable except by colonial military rule.
# To sustain the war and gain support for its ends by National and International propaganda and publicity campaigns.
# By defending the war of liberation by punishing criminals, collaborators and informers."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 1956 edition stresses military objectives and barely mentions political objectives. It contains a lot of practical advice on operating as a guerrilla fighter and how to inflict damage on targets. No mention is made of the establishment of ''"a Democratic Socialist Republic"''. This can probably been seen in the context of the IRA keeping pace with social changes and the material aspirations of Irish men and women living within the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. At the time of the Border Campaign the communities the IRA came to rely on were not politicised to the same degree as those in 1977.  A lack of support within their host community is commonly given as the reason for the failure of the Border Campaign. This edition of the Green Book even goes so far as to announce the aim of restoring the [[Irish language]] as the national language, an aim not mentioned in the earlier edition.

==Military equipment in the Green Book==

The 1977 edition of the Green Book makes little mention of arms and equipment available to the volunteer. The one entry that does appear deals only with the issue of tactics as affected by lack of weaponry:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Tactics are dictated by the existing conditions. Here again the logic is quite simple. Without support Volunteers, Dumps, Weapons, Finance, etc., we cannot mount an operation, much less a campaign. In September 1969 the existing conditions dictated that the Brits were not to be shot, but after the Falls curfew all Brits were to the people acceptable targets. The existing conditions had been changed."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 1956 edition goes into a lot of detail on arms that the volunteer can expect to encounter and how to use them. Explosives are detailed alongside what the guerrilla should know about handling &amp; preparing them. The sabotage techniques and weaponry available at the time had mostly ceased to be commonly used by the late 1970s, namely:

:*[[Gelignite]], [[Nobel 808|808]], [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]], [[Ammonal]], [[nitrocellulose|Wet gun cotton]], [[Plastic explosive|Plastic]], and 822.

Detonators are also detailed with physical descriptions, handling instructions, and burning rates. Detonators covered include: [[Cordtex]] and FID.

Small arms listed range from the [[revolver]], to the [[shotgun]] and [[submachine gun]] up to the [[flame thrower]], which was almost never used, except for an attack on British soldiers of the [[King's Own Scottish Borderers]]. It can be assumed that the use of these weapons, or at least supplies of them, had been diminished when the 1977 edition was published. Given that the organisation was having troubles with internal security, it may have also been considered a security risk for the IRA to detail its available weaponry too closely.

A generation earlier, IRA units operating during the [[S-Plan|S-Plan / Sabotage campaign]] did not have access to the above material, with the exception of Gelignite. IRA explosive devices of the 1930s and 1940s were prepared using materials such as [[Potassium chlorate]], [[Carbide]], [[Saxonite]], [[Iron Oxide]], [[Aluminium]], [[sulfuric acid]] etc. By the time of the [[Northern Campaign (IRA)]] c. 1942, [[IRA Eastern Command]], in cooperation with [[IRA Western Command]] could raise 12 tons of weapons and explosives at short notice. This was excluding the tons of weapons and explosives seized during the S-Plan campaign.

When the IRA split in the early 1970s into the [[Official IRA]] and Provisional IRA, they divided the arms held in IRA weapons dumps. The Provisional IRA obtained the majority of these weapons. For details on the types of arms recently decommissioned by the IRA as part of their permanent cessation of violence see the article on the [[Independent International Commission on Decommissioning]] and a breakdown of the [[Provisional IRA arms importation|PIRA's weapons]] before decommissioning took place in September 2005.

==Propaganda techniques in the Green Book ==

The 1977 edition stresses that the volunteer is ultimately responsible within the framework of the movement for ensuring the formulation, dissemination and efficiency of propaganda. This process was to begin within the mind of the volunteer himself:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A new recruit's immediate obstacle is the removal of his (her) ignorance about how to handle weapons, military tactics, security, interrogations etc. An O.C.'s [Commanding Officer] might be how to put a unit on a military footing; an I.O.'s [Intelligence Officer] how to create an effective intelligence network; a Cumann na mBan Chairman's how best to mount a campaign on a given issue, e.g. H Blocks etc., and for all members of the movement regardless of which branch we belong to, to enhance our commitment to and participation in the struggle through gaining as comprehensive an understanding as possible of our present society and the proposed Republican alternative through self and group education."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The stated war objectives of the IRA within the 1977 document included the success of national and international propaganda as a war objective:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We exploit these mistakes [mistakes by the British Army] by propagating the facts. So it was with their murderous mistakes of the [[Falls Curfew|Falls Road curfew]], [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]] and [[internment]], which were exploited to our advantage support- wise as was the murder of John Boyle in Dunloy."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 1956 edition is a lot more practical, suggesting a more limited, less well oiled organisational machine of the IRA then than today:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The main channels of information available to the guerrillas are newspapers, leaflets, radio, word of mouth. Other methods may be worked out and new ones invented. For example: 
Painting of slogans, proclamations and manifestoes and so on. All the means of winning the confidence of the people must be utilised. The ideas of the movement must be so popularised that no one is in doubt-least of all the enemy-that it will win eventually."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"This information service must function continuously to get maximum results. Among the things it must do are:
*Show weakness of enemy position and propaganda used to bolster that position.''
*Show what is wrong with political and social order.
*Suggest remedies and how they can be brought about.
*Be in touch all the times with thinking of the people."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The world must know and understand what is being done, what the enemy is trying to destroy and why, and the way these things can be ended and peace restored and freedom won. The use of regular bulletins for foreign newspapers and news-agencies becomes a necessity. The bulletin should be of the documentary type: no room for emotional pleas or the like. Just the facts."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While IRA volunteers also engaged in the above efforts, the techniques are not described in the 1977 Green Book.

==Interrogation techniques==
The 1956 edition contains no details on how to react to internment, capture, [[interrogation]], or interrogation techniques. This was no doubt an oversight on the part of the IRA, one which they came to regret with the successful interrogation of IRA volunteers captured by their enemies.

By 1977, with the launching of the IRA's campaign in Northern Ireland in 1969, the technical capabilities &amp; anti-insurgency apparatus of the RUC, as well as the Regular and Specialist forces of the British Army had advanced. Coupled with this were technical advances in the intelligence gathering and interrogation techniques of those forces. The combination of these factors alongside political determination to capture and kill IRA forces and subdue the nationalist population of Northern Ireland led to changes in the Green Book. 

Much more stress was placed on resisting interrogation in what has been called The Green Book II.&lt;ref&gt;T.P. Coogan discusses the stress the PIRA placed on Interrogations in his history of the IRA. See [http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/organ/docs/coogan/coogan93.htm here].&lt;/ref&gt; If captured, the PIRA volunteer is warned to remain mentally implacable:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
#"The most important thing to bear in mind when arrested is that you are a volunteer of a revolutionary Army, that you have been captured by an enemy force, that your cause is a just one, that you are right and that the enemy is wrong and that as a soldier you have taken the chance expected of a soldier and that there is nothing to be ashamed of in being captured.
#You must bear in mind that the treatment meted out to you is designed to break you and so bleed you of all the information you may have with regard to the organisation to which you belong.
#They will attempt to intimidate you by sheer numbers and by brutality. Volunteers who may feel disappointed are entering the first dangerous threshold because the police will act upon this disappointment to the detriment of the volunteer and to the furtherment of their own ends. Volunteers must condition themselves that they can be arrested and if and when arrested they should expect the worse and be prepared for it."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A series of tactics employed by interrogators are listed along with the stages the interrogation process the volunteer should expect to go through: physical torture, subtle psychological torture, and humiliation.

The remainder of the document persists in a similar vein, constantly stressing the dangers of submitting to interrogation techniques. This highlights the increasing threat the PIRA realised interrogations were having against the organisation. Most likely this was a result of experience gained throughout the 1970s and during the Border Campaign when arrest and imprisonment of IRA/PIRA volunteers seriously impacted the operational effectiveness of the respective organizations.

'''''The Simpsons Game''''' is an [[action game|action]] [[platform game|platformer]] [[video game]] based on the animated [[television series]] ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and loosely on ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', made for the [[Nintendo DS]], [[Wii]], [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation Portable]]. The game was developed, published, and distributed by [[Electronic Arts]]. It was released in North America in October 2007 and worldwide in November 2007. It features an original storyline written by ''The Simpsons'' writers [[Tim Long]], [[Matt Selman]], and [[Matt Warburton]]. In the [[meta-joke|self-referential]] plot, the family discovers that they are forced to participate in another ''The Simpsons'' video game. Similar to the show, the game pokes fun at [[popular culture]], other video games, and Electronic Arts, its publisher.

The game follows the five Simpson family members—[[Homer Simpson|Homer]], [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] (with [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]), [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]]—who learn they are part of a video game and are given superpowers to resolve several situations. Eventually, they must save their [[history of video game consoles (third generation)|8-bit]] predecessors from [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]], and the creator of their video game character selves, [[Matt Groening]]. The Simpson family travels to four scenarios in parodies of other games to collect key cards used to infiltrate their creator's mansion and ultimately to save their predecessors from destruction.

The game was met with mixed reception from video game critics. They praised its visuals and writing, which included many parodies of other video games, while they criticized its short length and poor [[camera system]], which did not always function properly. ''The Simpsons Game'' received the Best Game Based on a Movie or TV Show award at the 2007 [[Spike Video Game Awards]] and was nominated for Best Video Game Writing at the [[Writers Guild of America Awards 2007|2007]] [[Writers Guild of America Award]]s. As of January 31, 2008, four million copies of the game have been sold worldwide.

==Gameplay==
Players of ''The Simpsons Game'' are able to control the [[Simpson family]] (except [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]), each with their own unique abilities.&lt;ref name="ign" /&gt; Two different family members are playable in each level,&lt;ref name="mtv1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="edge"/&gt; aside from the [[tutorial]] level, "The Land of Chocolate", in which only [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] is playable, and the final level, "Game Over", where all members of the family are playable.&lt;ref name="1UPpreview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3162659&amp;sec=PREVIEWS|title=The Simpsons Game Preview|last=Lee|first=Garnett|date=October 10, 2007|publisher=1UP|accessdate=2008-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game contains sixteen levels, called episodes,&lt;ref name="edge"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.next-gen.biz/news/ea-reveals-new-simpsons-title|title=EA Reveals New Simpsons Title|date=May 10, 2007|work=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]|accessdate=2008-12-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523193451/http://www.edge-online.com/news/ea-reveals-new-simpsons-title|archivedate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and each requires specific powers to complete. For example, in the fourth episode, "Lisa the Tree Hugger", the player is required to use [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]]'s "Hand of Buddha" power to move large objects, and [[Bart Simpson|Bart]]'s slingshot to shut down machines. Enemies unique to each episode are featured, with the exception of the final level, in which enemies that have already been defeated are [[Palette swap|"recycled" with different colors]].&lt;ref name="walkthrough" /&gt;

Several challenges are made available after all episodes are completed. These include finding all the collectibles for each character,&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt;  finding all the video game clichés,&lt;ref name="mtv2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1565589/20070726/index.jhtml?rsspartner=rssMozilla|title='Simpsons' Video Game Loaded With Inside Jokes; Mocks EA, Gamestop, 'GTA' Protesters|last=Totilo|first=Stephen|date=July 26, 2007 |publisher=MTV News|accessdate=2008-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]], and [[Nintendo DS]] versions, completing a certain task related to each episode's plot in a [[time trial]].&lt;ref name="manual"&gt;{{cite book| year=2007| title=The Simpsons Game Instruction Booklet| publisher=Nintendo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nintendoofficial"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/y5OK7OUGr353nxxeHz1fjvyFSMWu9LCj|title=The Simpsons Game|publisher=Nintendo|accessdate=2008-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Simpsons Game''{{'}}s [[HUD (video gaming)|head-up display]] features [[health (game mechanic)|health meters]] for both characters in each level, and an attack meter and special power meter for the character currently controlled by the player.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt; The game features a two player [[co-op mode]], which has a [[split screen (computer graphics)|split screen]] and allows each player to control one of the two characters featured on that level.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt;&lt;ref name="edge"/&gt;

The DS version of the game was developed separately from its console counterparts and is a side scrolling adventure. It also offers several features that are not available in the other versions. Several [[minigame]]s are available to unlock and play, most which are updated versions of arcade games such as ''[[Frogger]]'' and ''[[Space Invaders]]'', the latter which references the aliens [[Kang and Kodos]] from the ''[[Treehouse of Horror (series)|Simpsons Treehouse of Horror]]'' episodes. A [[digital pet|virtual pet]] is also accessible, called "Pet Homer", which allows players to feed, entertain, and save Homer from threats such as choking and heart attacks.&lt;ref name=1up-ds /&gt;

==Plot==
The game begins with Homer having a [[Burns Verkaufen der Kraftwerk|candy-induced fantasy about a world of chocolate]] where he tries to catch and eat a white chocolate rabbit; upon waking up he is upset to find that it was all a dream.

Bart goes to the video game store and coerces the clerk to let him buy the new and violent ''Grand Theft Scratchy'' game, only to have it confiscated by Marge. While Bart mopes, a video game manual falls down from the sky in front of him. Reading through the manual, Bart discovers that he and the rest of his family have special powers. Later, Bart uses his Bartman powers to stop [[Jimbo Jones|Jimbo]], [[Kearney Zzyzwicz|Kearney]], and [[Dolph (The Simpsons)|Dolph]] from stealing from the Natural History Museum, Homer uses his ability to become a huge ball and win an eating contest, Lisa uses her powers of meditation to stop a [[deforestation]] project, and Marge uses her powers to influence crowds to stop the release of ''Grand Theft Scratchy'' in [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]], although Lisa points out it is ironic she used violence to stop a violent game.&lt;ref name=walkthrough /&gt;

During dinner, the family is euphoric with their new powers. However, it leads to an argument about what they should be doing with them. Aliens [[Kang and Kodos]] decide to strike Earth, and an [[alien invasion]] unfolds. Realizing none of their powers are strong enough to defeat the aliens, Bart and Lisa visit [[Professor Frink]]. They visit his house to find him not there, but they stumble upon a portal that sends them to a place called the [[game engine]] where all video games are made. After saving him from a [[Donkey Kong (character)|giant gorilla]], Frink gives them ''The Simpsons Game''{{'}}s player's guide to teach them how to better use their powers as well as gain new ones, and the Simpson family soon sets out to try and stop the alien invasion. First, Bart and Lisa aid [[Captain McCallister]] in beating back mind-controlled dolphins that are attacking the city aquarium. Then, Bart and Homer defeat the Lard Lad statue which has come to life. Finally, they save the Springfield Mall and [[Cletus Spuckler|Cletus]] from the aliens.&lt;ref name=walkthrough /&gt;

In order to find out the truth, the family turns to the Internet to discover more about the powers they have in the game, but are accidentally sent to the game engine when Homer spills beer over the keyboard. There, they discover [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]], who is destroying copies of an old [[History of video game consoles (third generation)|8-bit]] ''The Simpsons'' game and its characters. The family manages to save their 8-bit predecessors before they are destroyed by Wright, and discover that they will also become obsolete when the next ''The Simpsons'' game is released. The only way to prevent this is to talk to the creator of the games and convince him not to destroy them. In order to access his mansion, the family needs to acquire four key cards from four upcoming ''Simpsons'' games. First, Homer and Marge defeat a two-headed dragon whose heads are those of Patty and Selma in the ''Neverquest'' game. Marge and Lisa then travel to ''Grand Theft Scratchy'', eliminating all offensive material and replacing it with more family-friendly material. Next, Homer and Bart travel to [[Nazi-occupied France|France]] during [[World War II]] to thwart Mr. Burns' plan to steal priceless French paintings, in the ''Medal of Homer'' game. Lisa and Homer then travel to ancient Japan to defeat the evil Mr. Dirt and his "Sparklemon" in the ''Big Super Happy Fun Fun Game''.&lt;ref name=walkthrough /&gt;

Once they have all four key cards, Bart and Homer infiltrate the creator's mansion. They are greeted by [[Matt Groening]], who sends ''[[Futurama]]'' characters [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] and [[Dr. Zoidberg]] after them. The family manages to defeat them, however, and Groening admits that he is only creating new games for the money, and destroys the game engine. The Simpsons, along with several other characters from the games, escape to Springfield, where the aliens are still attacking. Lisa uses her power to create a stairway to heaven in order for the family to ask God for advice. After he is defeated in a game of ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'', God reveals that the video game that they're in is a mini-game in another video game about Earth. He dropped the video game manual by accident, thus endowing the family with superpowers. Realizing his misdemeanor, he promises to restore Springfield, let them keep their powers, and to improve the working conditions of all video game characters. He also gives Homer three wishes. Lisa asks if God ever wonders if he himself is a character in a video game. As God nervously scoffs at this theory, it turns out that [[Ralph Wiggum]] is playing the entire game before he looks at the screen, wondering who was looking at him.&lt;ref name=walkthrough&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2008-12-14 |url=http://guides.ign.com/guides/780082/page_19.html |title=The Simpsons Game Walkthrough |publisher=IGN }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
[[File:EA Building RedwoodShores.JPG|left|220px|thumb|Electronic Arts' Redwood Shores team, based in [[Redwood City, California|Redwood City]], [[California]], developed ''The Simpsons Game'', and Electronic Arts published and distributed it.]]
The game's storyline was written by [[Tim Long]], [[Matt Selman]], and [[Matt Warburton]], who are all regular writers on ''The Simpsons''. They wanted to create something that appealed to the fans of the show, and was, in its own right, "a great new game".&lt;ref name=gamespotq&amp;a /&gt; [[Matt Groening]] and the writers had continuous feedback on the game's content, from its "look and feel" to its puzzles and gameplay. The game's [[executive producer]], Scot Amos, said it was an amazing partnership between the writers and the developers.&lt;ref name="gamespotq&amp;a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps3/action/thesimpsons/news.html?sid=6180098|title= The Simpsons Game Executive Producer Q&amp;A |date=September 28, 2007|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=2008-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selman, the head writer, says the reason they decided to call it ''The Simpsons Game'' and not add a subtitle was because they felt it was a restart of "the 'Simpsons' gaming franchise [...] a big, new, fresh game that takes on video games and hilarious things of all time".&lt;ref name="mtv1"/&gt;

[[File:Matt Selman by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|Matt Selman was the head writer of ''The Simpsons Game''.]]
''The Simpsons Game'' was published by [[Electronic Arts]] and developed by its subsidiary, [[Visceral Games|EA Redwood Shores]]; the company had signed a contract for the video game rights to ''The Simpsons'' in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117932141.html|title=EA signs 'Simpsons'|date=2005-11-02|accessdate=2008-12-15|work=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's lead designer, Greg Rizzer, said that when he asked his bosses if they could parody some Electronic Arts games including ''[[Medal of Honor (video game series)|Medal of Honor]]'', they were enthusiastic about it.&lt;ref name="onm interview" /&gt; ''The Simpsons Game'', which parodies video games from 30 years prior to 2007, was forced to have some of its content removed after several video game companies complained about it. Rizzer, however, was still pleased with the amount of parody in the game and considered ''The Simpsons'' the "perfect vehicle to poke fun at the games industry".&lt;ref name=cvg-upsets /&gt; At the 2007 [[Games Convention]] in [[Leipzig, Germany|Leipzig]], [[Germany]], a poster for "Grand Theft Scratchy", one of the levels in ''The Simpsons Game'' and a parody of ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'', was asked to be taken down by an employee of [[Rockstar Games]], the company that develops the ''Grand Theft Auto'' series of video games. Several companies, however, embraced the game's parody of their video games, including developers from [[Harmonix]], who were pleased with the game's "Sitar Hero", a parody of Harmonix's ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' video game.&lt;ref name=cvg-upsets&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-12-13|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=173102|title=EA upsets games companies with The Simpsons |work=Computer and Video Games |date=2007-10-04 |author=Bishop, Stuart }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to game parodies, ''The Simpsons Game'' also features several cameos with satirical spins, including Matt Groening as himself and Will Wright as an antagonist.&lt;ref name=ign /&gt;

The graphics for the game's characters are [[cel-shaded animation|cel-shaded]], and an implemented technique helps flatten the character models from any angle that the camera views them from, in order to recreate the 2D, hand-drawn look seen in the show.&lt;ref name=gamespot-firstlook&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2008-12-15 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps3/action/thesimpsons/news.html?sid=6170311 |title=The Simpsons First Look |publisher=GameSpot |date=2007-05-09 |author=Shoemaker, Brad }}&lt;/ref&gt; The development team found it particularly difficult to render Lisa's spiky hair as 2D in the game's 3D environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2008-12-15 |url=http://www.shacknews.com/featuredarticle.x?id=331 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120911095914/http://www.shacknews.com/featuredarticle.x?id=331 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-11 |title=The Simpsons Game Preview |publisher=Shacknews |date=2007-05-11 |author=Remo, Chris }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wii version has lower-quality graphics than the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions due to the console's inferior hardware.

The game received mixed reception, receiving an aggregated score of 71% on [[Metacritic]] for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 version of the game.&lt;ref name=metacritic /&gt; Praise focused on the game's visuals and writing, which lampooned the gaming industry and the show itself.

The game's use of ''The Simpsons''-style humor received a mixed reception. Both [[GameSpot]] and [[GameTrailers]] said that the game delivered more than enough laughs to make it worth playing through at least once.&lt;ref name=gamespot /&gt;&lt;ref name=gametrailers /&gt; It was considered enjoyable for both hardcore and casual ''The Simpsons'' fans by [[IGN]] and [[GameDaily]], who also called it a particularly appealing game for diehard fans.&lt;ref name=ign-psp /&gt;&lt;ref name=gamedaily /&gt; Despite the few problems that the game had, [[GameSpy]] said that it was worth it to see the humorous parodies.&lt;ref name=gamespy /&gt; [[Eurogamer]]'s Tom Bramwell, however, believed that the game's humor could only carry it so far, and suggested that those interested in ''The Simpsons'' humor should purchase a [[box set]] of one of the television series' seasons instead.&lt;ref name=eurogamer /&gt; Joe Juba of ''[[Game Informer]]'' called the game an average experience. He elaborated that the game would appeal primarily to fans of the television series, but would not be worth playing for people unfamiliar with it.&lt;ref name=gameinformer /&gt;

Eurogamer praised the involvement of people from ''The Simpsons'' television series with the game's development&lt;ref name=eurogamer /&gt; and GameZone enjoyed the two-character mechanics of the game and had fun collecting unlockable items.&lt;ref name=gamezone /&gt; GameTrailers thought the graphics and animations looked great and appreciated the hand-drawn appearances, even though they found it obvious that the characters were "never really meant to jump into the third dimension" because of their second-dimension roots.&lt;ref name=gametrailers /&gt;

Criticism of the game focused on its short, uninspiring gameplay and troublesome [[camera system]]. GameSpot considered the gameplay "nothing special"&lt;ref name=gamespot-wii /&gt; while GameZone called it a "pretty shallow" game that depended too much on repetitive jumping puzzles and a weak combat system.&lt;ref name=gamezone /&gt; The game disappointed IGN because it did not include an online feature and it was deemed too short.&lt;ref name=ign-psp /&gt; The camera system was found to be problematic by both GameZone and GameSpy, who called it "a pain" and a "busted" feature;&lt;ref name=gamezone /&gt;&lt;ref name=gamespy /&gt; GameDaily also found it bothersome because it often got stuck.&lt;ref name=gamedaily /&gt;

The DS version of the game, which was significantly different from the other versions, received praise for its unique gameplay, but criticism for its short length. IGN lauded the DS version's unique gameplay experience&lt;ref name=ign-ds /&gt; and GameSpot proclaimed that it was satisfying from start to finish.&lt;ref name=gamespot-ds /&gt; GameSpot and GameZone, however, were both disappointed that the game was extremely brief.&lt;ref name=gamezone-ds /&gt;&lt;ref name=gamespot-ds /&gt; 1UP found that even though ''The Simpsons Game'' parodied numerous 2D platform game conventions, it used them anyway, making it a pointless endeavor.&lt;ref name=1up-ds /&gt;

==Cancelled sequel==
Electronic Arts planned to produce a sequel to the game, entitled ''The Simpsons Game 2'', along with a [[Nintendo Wii]] version of ''[[Dead Space 2]]'', but both were cancelled in 2011 because the studio decided to make room for other projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2011/04/05/electronic-arts-cancels-dead-space-2-wii-the-simpsons-game-2/?xrs=share_twitter|title=Electronic Arts Cancels 'Dead Space 2' Wii, 'The Simpsons Game 2'|work=[[MTV]]|date=2011-04-05|author=Rosenberg, Adam|accessdate=2011-04-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204033431/http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2011/04/05/electronic-arts-cancels-dead-space-2-wii-the-simpsons-game-2/?xrs=share_twitter|archivedate=2012-02-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2014">'''Theodorus Marinus Roest''' (14 April 1832, [[Dongen]] &amp;ndash; 2 September 1898 [[Baden-Baden]]) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[numismatist]] and [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]] of the [[Teylers Coin and Medal Room|numismatic collection]] of the [[Teylers Museum]].

In 1872 he was appointed ''associé étranger'' of the ''Sociéte royale de numismatique'', and became publisher of ''Reveu de la numismatique belge''. He became an authority on [[numismatics]]. In 1876 he became director of the Academisch Penningkabinet in [[Leiden]]. In 1881 he resigned when that cabinet was absorbed into the ''[[:File:Voormalig Koninklijk Penningkabinet.jpg|Royal cabinet of medals]]'' (which today is part of the [[:nl:Geldmuseum]] in Utrecht).  

Through the efforts of the archivist of the city of Haarlem [[Adriaan Justus Enschedé]], Roest was hired to catalog the collection of the Teylers Museum. Enschedé had been a member [[Teylers Tweede Genootschap]] since 1876 and was a coin collector himself. In 1886 Roest was named conservator, and in 1889 he published his ''"Catalogue du cabinet numismatique de la Fondation Teyler à Harlem"''. 

In 1893 he published the work ''"De munten van het Graafschap en Hertogdom GELRE"'' (Coins of [[Gelre]], or the [[Gelderse Mint]]), and later he left his collection of Gelderse coins to the museum.

'''Urban plans in Iran''' are based on approximately 40&amp;nbsp;years experience. All of these variable plans have been executed based on comprehensive planning. According to a census conducted in February 1999, 304&amp;nbsp;master plans (including national, regional, urban, and new-cities plans) had been approved; that figure has climbed to 350&amp;nbsp;plans. The [[industrial revolution]] was considered as a turning point for great changes in cities but this change belongs mostly to western cities that existed prior to the 20th&amp;nbsp;century. The fast development and prosperity of [[urban planning]] discussed here refers to the first years of 20th&amp;nbsp;century.

==Approaches to urban planning==
In recent years, exacerbation of urban problems has formed two views on urban planning [[Iran]].

===Comprehensive and rational===
This approach asserts that there are not suitable conditions and enough infrastructure to use acceptable new tools in urban planning and states that planners have to follow their traditional way in urban plans.

===Strategic and structural===
Thinkers of this approach believe that qualitative changes during the time, insufficient pattern in urban development plans to cater for the demands of society, globalization, and the necessity of adapting to changes with urban plans, necessitate the use of a new pattern in society.

It recognizes the limitations and problems in these plans in the context of Iran and offers a systematic approach as a transition tool from comprehensive approach to strategic approach in the urban planning system.

==Master development plans==
This pattern was formed by [[Patrick Geddes]], who established urban planning, and his student [[Lewis Mumford]]. They were biologists who could use the methods of [[ecology]] and [[biology]] to discuss organic theory in urban planning. Master development plans have been created by combining this theory with new urban functionalism theory over half a century.

==Systematic approach in urban planning==
Twenty-five years experience of urban planning after the war &lt;!-- which war? --&gt; demonstrated the difficulties of a master plan in Europe. Along with these problems there was increasingly critical opinion about the fundamental theory. During the 1960s and 1970s, theories and experience of urban planning in [[Western Europe]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Japan]] led to a systematic approach. Final goals of the systematic approach are:

# Far from master and rational plans &lt;!-- what does this mean? --&gt;
# Follow economic, social, and cultural goals
# Combine planning and management
# Completion of approaches and methods in urban planning in framework plans

==Strategic approach in urban planning==
Specifications of strategic-structural plans shows they are better than comprehensive plans. The most important specifics of these plans are:
# Cyclical process of preparation of these plans
# Flexibility and envisaging probable failures and the possibility of reviewing the perspective, general objectives, and strategies
# Possibility of participation of people in preparation, approval, implementation, and review of these plans

Iranian managers are supporting comprehensive plans despite the fact that such plans were proven outdated in other countries over four decades ago. Support extended by Iranian officials to comprehensive plans is the main challenge facing strategic-structural ones.

The high capacity of strategic-structural plans to adapt to complicated and changeable social and economic conditions has been proven. But implementation of these plans needs at least a basic foundation in science, theory, economics, law, finance, and administration. Until such preconditions materialize, implementation of a plan with a strategic stance is impossible.

'''V-by-One HS''' is an electrical digital signaling standard that can run at faster speeds over inexpensive twisted-pair copper cables than [[Low-voltage differential signaling]], or LVDS. It was originally developed by [[THine Electronics]], Inc. in 2007 for [[high-definition televisions]] but since 2010 V-by-One HS has been widely adopted in various markets such as document processing, automotive infotainment systems, industrial cameras and [[machine vision]], robotics and amusement equipments.

While high-definition televisions had generally used LVDS to transmit pixel data, timing-skew problems among conductors appeared by increasing data rate based on requirements of higher-resolution and more color-depth. V-by-One HS, by its [[SerDes]] and CDR([[Clock recovery]]) technology, achieves the high speed of 3.75 Gbit/s for each pair of conductors, decreasing the number of conductors, therefore reducing the total costs including cables and connectors. This solves skew problems and reduces [[electromagnetic interference]] (or EMI) and power consumption.

==Outline of V-by-One HS==
Historically flat panel televisions used LVDS as its internal interface to transmit pixel data but, in accordance with televisions’ higher resolution and expansion in color depth, televisions had to face problems such as increasing numbers of twisted-pair cables and tangible skews problems among cables. V-by-One HS is a standard of a high-speed SerDes, introducing CDR specification and equalizer, that achieves 3.75 Gbit/s (giga bits per second), solves skew problems, and reduces the power consumption and EMI. On behalf of such features, V-by-One HS enables to reduce total costs of interface systems, including costs of cables and connectors. V-by-One HS standard is an open standard and its specification has been delivered by [[THine Electronics]].

==Equalizer and CDR technology==
Equalizer of V-by-One HS improves data transmitting quality compared with LVDS interface. Because of this specification, it enables to expand data transmission between longer distances.
 
In addition, clock data recovery or CDR solves the skew problems that were more tangible in LVDS interface than ever. CDR technology eliminates any clock cables that LVDS requires with particular fixed frequency clock, resulted in lowering EMI noises. V-by-One HS supports wide range speed from 600 Mbit/s up to 3.75 Gbit/s, enabling lower energy consumption than interface with fixed rate.

LVDS adopters can switch smoothly from LVDS to V-by-One HS without significant changes in products designed.

==Development of V-by-One HS Technology==
V-by-One HS has been originally developed to replace internal interfaces of digital pixel displays.

LCDs, different from cathode ray tube (CRT) displays, have to use digital signaling to show each pixel. While notebook PCs started replacing CRT displays to LCDs, pixel data were transmitted as parallel data, interface systems found the problem that more than 20 cables were required to transmit data with 18 bits color depth for each 6-bit RGB color as well as lack of space for cables and difficulty of adjusting skews.

In order to solve these problems [[FPD-Link]] which uses low-voltage differential signaling, or LVDS, were adopted into LCDs. LVDS, defined by the ANSI/TIA/EIA-644-A standard, is a differential signaling system that can run at high speed. LVDS works in serial data transmission. As the main applications had 18 bits color depth in early adoption of FPD-Link, a 7-bit wide differential cable pair for each of 3 channels with another channel for clock became used. By this adoption of FPD-Link, internal interface systems of LCDs could reduce the 22 pair cables into 8 pairs with high-speed serial transmission. The Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) adopted this as a video standard specification and FPD-Link has penetrated wider as LCD interface.

However, in accordance with the fact that LCDs required much higher definition and more color depth as well as more frame rate, FPD-Link faced problems that input pixel data for LCDs increased exponentially and the number of LVDS cables soared as well. For example, full HD television (1920 x 1080 pixels) with a 10-bit color depth and double frame rate requires 24 FPD-Link differential pairs. Such a case has to adjust skews at the level of several hundreds of picoseconds because of much higher-speed clock and data rate. In addition, since LVDS requires a fixed clock frequency that concentrates spectrums, the interface systems have to minimize electromagnetic interference.

Furthermore, since FPD-Link mainly uses electrical digital signaling between zero volts (the ground level) and 1.2 volts based on its standard, it became a significant constraint of designing higher density LSIs. Under such circumstances, many substitutable interfaces such as [[DVI]], [[HDMI]], [[DisplayPort]], and V-by-One HS are offered and adopted widely.

DVI and HDMI have widely penetrated as external interfaces between equipments since DVI and HDMI can adjust skews. HDMI also requires hardware implementation of [[HDCP]], a content protection scheme. On the other hand, they had not been adopted as internal interfaces to replace FPD-Link because they require license fees, have functions that are not needed for internal data transmission, and their high voltage differential signals make chip design and manufacturing more difficult. DisplayPort, standardized by VESA to replace FPD-Link, is expecting to penetrate widely. DisplayPort has a similar specification of bias to PCI Express and is expected to have small barriers to design. However, DisplayPort has additional complexity because it is designed to allow one source device to drive multiple monitors, so it uses standardized link speeds and packetized data transfer. This requires DisplayPort sink devices to have circuitry needed to discard packets targeted at other sink devices and to extract data from packets targeted at themselves, and have a memory buffer in order to deal with the speed mismatch between the standardized link speed and the speed the display requires. Multiple monitors might need data at the same time as each other, but DisplayPort can only transmit one micro-packet to one monitor on one differential pair at a time. This is solved by having some micro-packets sent earlier to the monitors before they are needed and having their data buffered at the target monitors until each monitor's display controller needs the data.

Under such circumstances, V-by-One HS has been developed. The largest differences by V-by-One HS from the other interfaces can be seen in its equalizer and clock/data recovery (CDR) technology. V-by-One HS uses an equalizer in the receiver to help the receiver clean up an incoming signal and therefore helps boost signal integrity. This boost in signal integrity allows V-by-One HS achieve a speed of 3.75 Gbit/s which is higher than what FPD-Link permits. In addition, Its CDR technology solves the skew problems in FPD-Link and eliminates the need for a separate clock signal that generates more electromagnetic interference.

Because of its higher-speed data transmitting ability, V-by-One HS is expected to reduce the numbers of cables, connectors, their related spaces within the equipments and finally the total costs. For example, Ultra-high definition panels (UHD panel, 3840 × 2160 pixels) requires only 16-pair cables with V-by-One HS technology while it needs 96 pairs of general LVDS cables. V-by-One HS supports wide range of transmitting speeds. Engineers of set makers can adopt it smoothly without significant changes from the existing LVDS interface.

==Application==
* Flat panel displays, including tablets and televisions
* Document processing and multi-functional printers
* Automotive infotainment systems
* Industrial cameras and machine vision
* Robotics
* Amusement equipments

==Standards==
The V-by-One HS Standard is open and delivered by [[THine Electronics]]. As of June 30, 2012, the most updated version is “V-by-One HS Standard Version 1.4.”

==See also==
* [[FPD-Link]] - often mistakenly called LVDS. It is the standard V-by-One HS is trying to replace.
* [[DisplayPort]] - Internal DisplayPort (iDP) is an adaptation of DisplayPort for internal use in flat screen televisions. It is a contemporary competitor to V-by-One HS that is promoted by the [[Video Electronics Standards Association]]. It removes all DRM, the auxiliary data channel, allows the designer to use more lanes than regular DisplayPort to deal with higher bandwidth needs, and requires one signaling speed, 3.24&amp;nbsp;GHz, instead of a clock speed that is tied to the incoming pixel rate. This interface allows the designer to use one to an unlimited number of lanes unlike regular DisplayPort which is restricted to 4 lanes maximum. Each iDP lane runs at 3.24&amp;nbsp;GHz. Due to 8b/10b overhead which enables clock recovery without a separate clock signal lane, each lane carries 2.592 gigabits per second after the overhead is removed. Padding is used to deal with the difference between the throughput supplied by iDP and the raw video throughput.

'''''Verbrüderungsbuch''''' ([[codex]] of fraternisation) is the [[German language|German]] name for registers from [[Monastery|monasteries]] in the [[Middle Ages]]. They contained lists with the names of sponsors and benefactors, as well as persons in close spiritual contact with a monastery, so that they were actively remembered in the prayers of the monks. In many cases these books were established as early as the 8th century and continued up to the 13th century. So-called ''[[Jahrtagsbuch|Jahrtagsbücher]]'' (year books) are in many ways their successors.

''Verbrüderungsbücher'' are a rich source for [[prosopography]] and [[historical linguistics]] of the early Middle Ages.

The '''''Virginia Argus and Hampshire Advertiser''''', often referred to simply as the '''''Virginia Argus''''', was a weekly newspaper published between July 1850 and August 1861 in [[Romney, West Virginia|Romney]], [[Virginia]] (now [[West Virginia]]). The paper's circulation of 800 copies was the second-highest in [[Hampshire County, West Virginia|Hampshire County]], after the ''South Branch Intelligencer'''s. The ''Virginia Argus'' ceased publication following its closure by the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]], after which it was not revived.

The ''Virginia Argus'' documented the pursuit of [[fugitive slave]] Jacob Green by the Parsons family of Romney in 1856, and the ensuing dispute between the Parsons family and [[Charles J. Faulkner|Charles James Faulkner]] over legal fees in 1857. At the time of the dispute, Faulkner was a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from [[Virginia's 8th congressional district]]; he later served as the [[United States Ambassador to France|United States Minister to France]], and again as a member of the United States House of Representatives from [[West Virginia's 2nd congressional district]].

Among the newspaper's proprietors was [[Alexander W. Monroe]], a prominent Romney lawyer who had previously served as a member of the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] (1850–1851). Monroe and co-owner Job N. Cookus left the newspaper to serve in the [[Confederate States Army]] during the American Civil War. Following the war, Monroe represented Hampshire County in the [[West Virginia House of Delegates]] (1875–1877 and 1879–1883). During the 1875–1877 [[legislative session]], he was the [[List of Speakers of the West Virginia House of Delegates|Speaker of the West Virginia House of Delegates]].

==Jacob Green affair==
[[File:Charles J. Faulkner 1806-1884 - Brady-Handy.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Charles J. Faulkner|Charles James Faulkner]]]]
In a series of articles published in the May 14 and 21, 1857 issues of the ''Virginia Argus'', Romney resident Col. [[Isaac Parsons (American military officer)|Isaac Parsons]] chronicled the 1855 arrest of his nephew, James Parsons, for attempting to capture Col. Parsons' [[fugitive slave]], Jacob Green, and the resulting dispute between the Parsons family and [[Charles J. Faulkner|Charles James Faulkner]] over legal fees in 1857.&lt;ref name = "HH1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HH2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.historichampshire.org/black/JGreen.htm | title = Jacob Green, Runaway Slave: The Pursuit of Jacob Green by the Parsons Family and the Problem of Free States | work = Historic Hampshire County, West Virginia: West Virginia's Oldest County | publisher = Charles C.

In August 1855, Green escaped from Parsons' [[Wappocomo (Romney, West Virginia)|Wappocomo]] plantation with four other slaves from neighboring plantations.&lt;ref name = "HH2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "NPS1"/&gt; In October of that year, he returned to Col. Parsons' plantation in Romney, and persuaded four or five slaves from neighboring farms owned by Parsons family relatives to escape with him to Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name = "HH2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "NPS1"/&gt;

A party of eight to ten men, including Col. Parsons and two of his nephews, James Parsons and a Mr. Stump, went north in pursuit of the escapees. In the course of the pursuit, they captured two of Stump's escaped slaves, who were sent back to Hampshire County.&lt;ref name = "HH2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "NPS1"/&gt;  With information obtained from the two recaptured slaves, Col. Parsons went to [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania|Johnstown]], James Parsons to Hollidaysburg, and Stump to [[Altoona, Pennsylvania|Altoona]], where they hoped to intercept Green as he headed west on the [[Allegheny Portage Railroad]] and [[Main Line of Public Works|Main Line Canal]] toward [[Pittsburgh]].&lt;ref name = "NPS1"/&gt; James Parsons intercepted Green at Hollidaysburg, but local [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] thwarted his attempt to capture Green, and he was arrested and arraigned for kidnapping.&lt;ref name = "HH2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "NPS1"/&gt;
[[File:John Randolph Tucker 1823-1897 - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|150px|[[John Randolph Tucker (politician)|John Randolph Tucker]]]]
Upon learning of James Parsons' arrest, Col. Parsons sought the assistance of [[Charles J. Faulkner|Charles James Faulkner]], a prominent [[Martinsburg, West Virginia|Martinsburg]] lawyer and [[United States House of Representatives|United States House Representative]] from [[Virginia's 8th congressional district]], and of [[James Murray Mason]], a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from Virginia.&lt;ref name = "HH2"/&gt; Faulkner and Mason both offered their legal services for James Parsons' defense.&lt;ref name = "HH2"/&gt; The [[Virginia General Assembly]] pledged its support to Parsons and to Virginia's slaveowners in defending their constitutional rights and to protect them from prosecution.&lt;ref name = "HH2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "VHD1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Virginia House of Delegates|1856|p=246.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Governor of Virginia|Virginia Governor]] [[Henry A. Wise]] appointed [[John Randolph Tucker (politician)|John Randolph Tucker]] to attend Parsons' trial as a "special commissioner" of Virginia.&lt;ref name = "HH2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "NPS1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "VHD2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Virginia House of Delegates|1856|p=454.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dispute between Virginia and Pennsylvania escalated, and on January 31, 1856, an article published in the ''[[New York Herald]]'' read "Threatened Civil War between Virginia and Pennsylvania."&lt;ref name = "NPS1"/&gt;

Col. Parsons, Faulkner, and Tucker traveled to Hollidaysburg for James Parsons' trial.&lt;ref name = "HH2"/&gt; Faulkner provided for Parsons' legal defense, leading to his acquittal as having acted legally under the provisions of the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]].&lt;ref name="NPS1"/&gt;

In September 1856, Faulkner billed Col. Parsons $150 for his legal services. Parsons disputed the charge. In a series of articles in the ''Virginia Argus'', he declared that Faulkner had originally offered his services at no cost; that he had been lauded publicly for his generosity in doing so without ever denying that he had been working ''[[pro bono]]''; and that he was practicing "duplicity and deception" in trying to win a reputation in his district through "specious acts of munificence".&lt;ref name = "HH2"/&gt;

Faulkner later served as [[United States Ambassador to France|United States Minister to France]]; following the American Civil War, he again served as a member of the United States House of Representatives, from [[West Virginia's 2nd congressional district]]. James Parsons and his brother William Miller Parsons were later proprietors of the ''Virginia Argus''.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "LOC1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "MacCabe1"/&gt;

'''Web server benchmarking''' is the process of estimating a [[web server]] performance in order to find if the server can serve sufficiently high workload.

==Key parameters==
The performance is usually measured in terms of:
*Number of requests that can be served per second (depending on the type of request, etc.);
*Latency response time in milliseconds for each new connection or request;
*Throughput in bytes per second (depending on file size, cached or not cached content, available network bandwidth, etc.).

The measurements must be performed under a varying load of clients and requests per client.

==Tools for benchmarking==
[[Load testing]] (stress/performance testing) a web server can be performed using automation/analysis tools such as:
*[[Apache JMeter]], an open-source [[Java (programming language)|Java]] load testing tool
*[[ApacheBench]] (or ab), a command line program bundled with [[Apache HTTP Server]]
*[[Httperf]], a command line program originally developed at [[HP Labs]]
*[[Siege (software)|Siege]], an open-source web-server load testing and benchmarking tool
*[[Curl-loader]], a [[software performance testing]] open-source tool
*[[OpenSTA]], a GUI-based utility for [[Microsoft Windows]]-based operating systems

==Web application benchmarks==
Web application benchmarks measure the performance of [[application server]]s and database servers used to host [[web application]]s. [[TPC-W]] was a common benchmark emulating an online bookstore with synthetic workload generation.

The [[United States|American]] '''Widener family''' of [[Peter Arrell Brown Widener]] (1834&amp;ndash;1915) and his wife Hannah Josephine Dunton (1836&amp;ndash;1896) were from [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], and were one of the wealthiest families in the United States. In 1883 Widener was part of the founding partnership of the [[Philadelphia Traction Company]] and used the great wealth accumulated from that business to become a founding organizer of [[U.S. Steel]] and the [[American Tobacco Company]].{{citation needed|date = March 2012}}

The legacy of Peter and Hannah Widener includes the [[Widener Library]] at [[Harvard University]] but even more important was the implanting of a social conscience in their children that has been passed down from generation to generation. While the family fortune dwindled over time through [[Estate tax in the United States|estate taxes]] and the natural division and redivision by inheritors, many of their 21st century descendants continue to be involved in charitable works. [[Widener University]] in [[Chester, Pennsylvania]], is named after the Wideners as a result of a very large contribution the family made when the college was transitioning from an all-male military college to a co-educational civilian university.{{citation needed|date = March 2012}}

Peter and Hannah Widener built [[Lynnewood Hall]] in [[Elkins Park, Pennsylvania]], a 110-room [[Georgian architecture|Georgian-style]] mansion designed by [[Horace Trumbauer]] where they assembled one of the most valuable [[art]] collections in the country. Left a vast fortune, their offspring became one of the most prominent factors in American [[Thoroughbred horse race|Thoroughbred horse racing]] history as well as founding benefactors of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Widener University]] in [[Chester, Pennsylvania]], and the [[Widener School for Crippled Children]].{{citation needed|date = March 2012}}

The descendants of Peter Arrell Brown Widener and Hannah Josephine Dunton include:
* [[George Dunton Widener]] (1861-1912)
* [[Joseph E. Widener]] (1871-1943)
* [[Harry Elkins Widener]] (1885-1912)
